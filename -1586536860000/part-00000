Defenders of either position cite advantages ranging from aesthetics, hospitality, and cleanliness to paper conservation, ease of detaching sheets, and compatibility with pets. Some writers have proposed connections to age, sex, or political philosophy, and survey evidence has shown a correlation with socioeconomic status.<ref>For pros and cons, including RVs and cats, see [[#Arguments|Arguments]]; for celebrities and experts, including Ann Landers, see [[#Noted preferences|Noted preferences]]; for theories, see [[#Themes|Themes]].</ref> \n\nSolutions where the views of household members differ include using separate dispensers or separate bathrooms and ignoring the issue. One man advocates a plan under which his country will standardize on a single forced orientation, and at least one inventor hopes to popularize a new kind of toilet roll holder which swivels from one orientation to the other.<ref>The enthusiast, Bill Jarrett, and the inventor, Curtis Batts, are described in [[#Solutions|Solutions]].</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Motivations for study}}Context and relevance==\nIn the article \"Bathroom Politics: Introducing Students to Sociological Thinking from the Bottom Up\",{{sfn|Burns|2003}} [[Eastern Institute of Technology]] [[sociology]] professor Edgar Alan Burns describes some reasons toilet paper politics is worthy of examination. On the first day of Burns' introductory course in sociology, he asks his students, \"Which way do you think a roll of toilet paper should hang?\"{{sfn|Burns|2003|p=111}} In the following fifty minutes, the students examine why they picked their answers, exploring the [[social construction]] of \"rules and practices which they have never consciously thought about before\".{{sfn|Burns|2003|p=113}}\n\nBurns' activity has been adopted by a [[social psychology]] course at the [[University of Notre Dame]], where it is used to illustrate the principles of [[Peter L. Berger|Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann|Luckmann]]'s 1966 classic ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]''.{{sfn|Collett|2008}}\n\n[[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Christopher Peterson]], a professor of psychology at the [[University of Michigan]], classifies the choice of toilet paper orientation under \"tastes, preferences, and interests\" as opposed to either [[value (personal and cultural)|values]] or \"attitudes, traits, norms, and needs\". Other personal interests include one's favorite cola or baseball team. Interests are an important part of [[identity (social science)|identity]]; one expects and prefers that different people have different interests, which serves one's \"sense of uniqueness\". Differences in interests usually lead at most to teasing and gentle chiding. For most people, interests don't cause the serious divisions caused by conflicts of values; a possible exception is what Peterson calls \"the 'get a life' folks among us\" who elevate interests into moral issues.{{sfn|Peterson|2006|pp=173\u2013175}}\n\n[[Morton Ann Gernsbacher]], a professor of psychology at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], compares the orientation of toilet paper to the orientation of cutlery in a dishwasher, the choice of which drawer in a [[chest of drawers]] to place one's socks, and the order of shampooing one's hair and lathering one's body in the shower. In each choice, there is a prototypical solution chosen by the majority, and it is tempting to offer simplistic explanations of how the minority must be different. She warns that [[neuroimaging]] experiments\u2014which as of 2007 were beginning to probe behaviors from [[mental rotation]] and [[facial expression]]s to grocery shopping and [[tickling]]\u2014must strive to avoid such [[cultural bias]] and [[stereotype]]s.{{sfn|Gernsbacher|2007}}\n\nIn his book ''[[Conversational Capital]]'', Bertrand Cesvet gives toilet paper placement as an example of [[ritual]]ized behavior\u2014one of the ways designers and marketers can create a memorable experience around a product that leads to [[word-of-mouth]] momentum. Cesvet's other examples include shaking a box of [[Tic Tac]]s and dissecting [[Oreo]] cookies.{{sfn|Cesvet|Babinski|Alper|2008|p=68}}\n\nBroadcaster [[Jim Bohannon]] has said that such issues are good for [[talk radio]]: \"It is an interactive medium, a certain kind of clash, it doesn't have to be a violent clash, but at least a disagreement would certainly be at the top of the list. It has to be something that's of general interest.\"{{sfn|Voice of America|2004}}\n\nThere are two choices of orientation when using a holder with a [[horizontal plane|horizontal]] [[axle]] [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the [[wall]]: the toilet paper may hang ''over'' or ''under'' the roll. The choice is largely a matter of personal preference, dictated by [[habit (psychology)|habit]]. In surveys of [[United States|American]] consumers and of bath and kitchen specialists, 60-70% of respondents prefer ''over''.  This is said to exhibit [[Endianness#Etymology|Endianness]], which applies not only to [[Egg as food|eggs]], but to [[toilet paper]].  Most Americans think it should go over the top, like a [[waterfall]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.maxim.com/news/toilet-paper-direction-2016-4 |title=What the Direction Your Toilet Paper Hangs Says About You According to Science: Under or over? |first1=Zeynep |last1=Yenisey |date=April 5, 2016 |work=[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]] |accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Arguments==\n[[File:Toilet paper in Hotel Monasterio.jpg|thumb|Folded and sealed toilet paper with cover, [[Hotel Monasterio]] 2009]]\n[[File:ToiletPaper Boo WrongWay.jpg|thumb|Paper mounted ''under'' with upside-down images and text]]\nThe main reasons given by people to explain why they hang their toilet paper a given way are ease of grabbing and habit.{{sfn|Progressive Grocer|2010}} Some particular advantages cited for each orientation include:\n* ''Over'' reduces the risk of accidentally brushing the wall or cabinet with one's knuckles, potentially transferring grime and germs.<ref>{{harvnb|Ode|2010}}: \"The Kimberly-Clark company cites three advantages for rolling over: perforation control, viewing advantage and wall avoidance.\"; {{harvnb|Garton|2005}}; {{harvnb|Jarski|Jarski|2007}}.</ref>\n* ''Over'' makes it easier to visually locate and to grasp the loose end.<ref>{{harvnb|Ode|2010}}; {{harvnb|Elliott|2006}}</ref>\n* ''Over'' gives hotels, cruise ships, office buildings, public places and homeowners with guest bathrooms the option [[hotel toilet paper folding|to fold over the last sheet]] to show that the room has been cleaned.<ref>{{harvnb|Lind|1992}}; \"The Grand Princess cruise ship replaces its toilet paper with the leading edge over the front, so that it can be folded as is done in five-star hotels.

The question: \"What is the correct and only way to hang the toilet paper \u2013 under or over?\"{{sfn|Stark|1993}} ''Over'' won 59 percent of the vote, 1,826 to 1,256 respondents.{{sfn|Toronto Star staff and news services|1993}} American Standard spokeswoman Nora Monroe observed, \"The bathroom is a territorial place.

A reader of the ''[[Annie's Mailbox]]'' column recommends using a holder large enough to fit two rolls, noting that the roll mounted ''over'' is more popular.

Defenders of either position cite advantages ranging from aesthetics, hospitality, and cleanliness to paper conservation, ease of detaching sheets, and compatibility with pets. Some writers have proposed connections to age, sex, or political philosophy, and survey evidence has shown a correlation with socioeconomic status.<ref>For pros and cons, including RVs and cats, see [[#Arguments|Arguments]]; for celebrities and experts, including Ann Landers, see [[#Noted preferences|Noted preferences]]; for theories, see [[#Themes|Themes]].</ref> \n\nSolutions where the views of household members differ include using separate dispensers or separate bathrooms and ignoring the issue. One man advocates a plan under which his country will standardize on a single forced orientation, and at least one inventor hopes to popularize a new kind of toilet roll holder which swivels from one orientation to the other.<ref>The enthusiast, Bill Jarrett, and the inventor, Curtis Batts, are described in [[#Solutions|Solutions]].</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Motivations for study}}Context and relevance==\nIn the article \"Bathroom Politics: Introducing Students to Sociological Thinking from the Bottom Up\",{{sfn|Burns|2003}} [[Eastern Institute of Technology]] [[sociology]] professor Edgar Alan Burns describes some reasons toilet paper politics is worthy of examination. On the first day of Burns' introductory course in sociology, he asks his students, \"Which way do you think a roll of toilet paper should hang?\"{{sfn|Burns|2003|p=111}} In the following fifty minutes, the students examine why they picked their answers, exploring the [[social construction]] of \"rules and practices which they have never consciously thought about before\".{{sfn|Burns|2003|p=113}}\n\nBurns' activity has been adopted by a [[social psychology]] course at the [[University of Notre Dame]], where it is used to illustrate the principles of [[Peter L. Berger|Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann|Luckmann]]'s 1966 classic ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]''.{{sfn|Collett|2008}}\n\n[[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Christopher Peterson]], a professor of psychology at the [[University of Michigan]], classifies the choice of toilet paper orientation under \"tastes, preferences, and interests\" as opposed to either [[value (personal and cultural)|values]] or \"attitudes, traits, norms, and needs\". Other personal interests include one's favorite cola or baseball team. Interests are an important part of [[identity (social science)|identity]]; one expects and prefers that different people have different interests, which serves one's \"sense of uniqueness\". Differences in interests usually lead at most to teasing and gentle chiding. For most people, interests don't cause the serious divisions caused by conflicts of values; a possible exception is what Peterson calls \"the 'get a life' folks among us\" who elevate interests into moral issues.{{sfn|Peterson|2006|pp=173\u2013175}}\n\n[[Morton Ann Gernsbacher]], a professor of psychology at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], compares the orientation of toilet paper to the orientation of cutlery in a dishwasher, the choice of which drawer in a [[chest of drawers]] to place one's socks, and the order of shampooing one's hair and lathering one's body in the shower. In each choice, there is a prototypical solution chosen by the majority, and it is tempting to offer simplistic explanations of how the minority must be different. She warns that [[neuroimaging]] experiments\u2014which as of 2007 were beginning to probe behaviors from [[mental rotation]] and [[facial expression]]s to grocery shopping and [[tickling]]\u2014must strive to avoid such [[cultural bias]] and [[stereotype]]s.{{sfn|Gernsbacher|2007}}\n\nIn his book ''[[Conversational Capital]]'', Bertrand Cesvet gives toilet paper placement as an example of [[ritual]]ized behavior\u2014one of the ways designers and marketers can create a memorable experience around a product that leads to [[word-of-mouth]] momentum. Cesvet's other examples include shaking a box of [[Tic Tac]]s and dissecting [[Oreo]] cookies.{{sfn|Cesvet|Babinski|Alper|2008|p=68}}\n\nBroadcaster [[Jim Bohannon]] has said that such issues are good for [[talk radio]]: \"It is an interactive medium, a certain kind of clash, it doesn't have to be a violent clash, but at least a disagreement would certainly be at the top of the list. It has to be something that's of general interest.\"{{sfn|Voice of America|2004}}\n\nThere are two choices of orientation when using a holder with a [[horizontal plane|horizontal]] [[axle]] [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the [[wall]]: the toilet paper may hang ''over'' or ''under'' the roll. The choice is largely a matter of personal preference, dictated by [[habit (psychology)|habit]]. In surveys of [[United States|American]] consumers and of bath and kitchen specialists, 60-70% of respondents prefer ''over''.  This is said to exhibit [[Endianness#Etymology|Endianness]], which applies not only to [[eggs]], but to [[toilet paper]].  Most Americans think it should go over the top, like a [[waterfall]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.maxim.com/news/toilet-paper-direction-2016-4 |title=What the Direction Your Toilet Paper Hangs Says About You According to Science: Under or over? |first1=Zeynep |last1=Yenisey |date=April 5, 2016 |work=[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]] |accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Arguments==\n[[File:Toilet paper in Hotel Monasterio.jpg|thumb|Folded and sealed toilet paper with cover, [[Hotel Monasterio]] 2009]]\n[[File:ToiletPaper Boo WrongWay.jpg|thumb|Paper mounted ''under'' with upside-down images and text]]\nThe main reasons given by people to explain why they hang their toilet paper a given way are ease of grabbing and habit.{{sfn|Progressive Grocer|2010}} Some particular advantages cited for each orientation include:\n* ''Over'' reduces the risk of accidentally brushing the wall or cabinet with one's knuckles, potentially transferring grime and germs.<ref>{{harvnb|Ode|2010}}: \"The Kimberly-Clark company cites three advantages for rolling over: perforation control, viewing advantage and wall avoidance.\"; {{harvnb|Garton|2005}}; {{harvnb|Jarski|Jarski|2007}}.</ref>\n* ''Over'' makes it easier to visually locate and to grasp the loose end.<ref>{{harvnb|Ode|2010}}; {{harvnb|Elliott|2006}}</ref>\n* ''Over'' gives hotels, cruise ships, office buildings, public places and homeowners with guest bathrooms the option [[hotel toilet paper folding|to fold over the last sheet]] to show that the room has been cleaned.<ref>{{harvnb|Lind|1992}}; \"The Grand Princess cruise ship replaces its toilet paper with the leading edge over the front, so that it can be folded as is done in five-star hotels.

The toilet paper hangs over the top.\"{{sfn|Landers|2002}} Her published commentary on the issue has even continued after her death. 2005 saw the premiere of a one-woman play written by [[David Rambo]]: a character study of Ann Landers titled ''The Lady with All the Answers''. Toilet paper comes up once again, and the actress surveys the audience for their opinions.<ref>{{harvnb|Welsh|2005}}; {{harvnb|Rawson|2008}}.</ref>\n\nIn his article in ''Teaching Sociology'', Burns writes that the toilet paper hanging exercise is valuable in part because \"[the] subject matter is familiar to everybody; everyone is an expert, and everyone has an opinion.\"{{sfn|Burns|2003|p=116}} Many entertainers, celebrities and businesspeople have publicized their opinion on the topic.\n\n[[image:Toilet-paper-roll-patent-US465588-0.png|thumb|Seth Wheeler's original (''[[circa|c.]]'' 1891) U.S. Patent illustration.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Maybelle |last1=Morgan|title=Over or under?

During the six-month-long [[polar night]], a few dozen residents are stuck living together, and while many of the headaches of modern life are far away, food and hygiene are not. Despite the challenges posed by the hostile [[Antarctic climate]], \"It is in the more mundane trials of everyday life that personality clashes are revealed.\"{{sfn|Daily Express|1999|p=39}}\n\n==Solutions==\n\nSome of the proposed solutions to this problem involve more or better technology, while others concentrate on human behavior.\n\n===Mechanical===\nThe Tilt-A-Roll is a swiveling toilet paper dispenser invented by Curtis Batts in 1996, a [[Dallas]]-native [[industrial engineer]].{{sfn|Floyd|1999}} His patents on the invention, summarize its design as \"An adjustable angle coupling secures the yoke to the mounting assembly and permits rotation of the yoke about an axis directed orthogonally through the spindle such that the paper roll can be oriented to unroll paper either from over or from under the roll as desired.\"<ref>{{patent|US|5588615}} and {{patent|US|5690302}}</ref> An inventor named Rocky Hutson demonstrated a similar device he called the T.P. Swivel to the producers of the television program ''[[PitchMen]]'' in late 2009. {{sfn|Zayas|2009}}\n\nAnother solution is to install two toilet paper dispensers. A reader of the ''[[Annie's Mailbox]]'' column recommends using a holder large enough to fit two rolls, noting that the roll mounted ''over'' is more popular. Another reader sidesteps the issue by foregoing the holder, instead piling five or six rolls in a big wicker basket.{{sfn|Mitchell|Sugar|2005b}} Even using separate bathrooms can help.<ref>{{harvnb|Arkins|1994}}; {{harvnb|Jarski|Jarski|2007}}.</ref> Other solutions include vertical holders.\n\n===Behavioral===\nToilet paper orientation has been used rhetorically as the ultimate issue that government has no business dictating, in letters to the editor protesting the regulation of [[noise pollution]]{{sfn|Ratzlaff|2009}} and stricter requirements to get a divorce.{{sfn|Wuthrich|2006}} In 2006, protesting [[New Hampshire]]'s [[List of smoking bans in the United States#New Hampshire|ban on smoking]] in restaurants and bars, representative Ralph Boehm ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]\u2013[[Litchfield, New Hampshire|Litchfield]]) asked \"Will we soon be told which direction the toilet paper must hang from the roll?\"{{sfn|Saunders|2006}}\n\nDavid O'Connor's 2005 book ''Henderson's House Rules: The Official Guide to Replacing the Toilet Paper and Other Domestic Topics of Great Dispute'' aims to solve disagreements with a minimum of debate or compromise by offering authoritative, reasonable rules.{{sfn|O'Connor|2005|pp=2\u20133}} The \"House Rule\" for toilet paper is ''over and out'', and a full page is dedicated to a diagram of this orientation. But O'Connor writes that \"if a female household member has a strong preference for the toilet paper to hang over and in, against the wall, that preference prevails. It is admittedly an odd preference, but women use toilet paper far more often than men\u2014hence the rule.\"<ref>{{harvnb|O'Connor|2005|pp=63\u201364}}; {{harvnb|Davis|2006}}.</ref>\n\n==Notes and references==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n===References===\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{Citation |author=Answer Fella |date=January 2007 |title=Famous Birthdays, Girlfriend Advice & a Brief History of Toilet Paper |work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] |volume=147 |issue=1 |page=52 |url=http://www.esquire.com/style/answer-fella/ESQ0107toiletpaper |accessdate=11 July 2010}}\n* {{Citation |last=Arkins |first=Diane C. |title=Consider Fallout of New Bath |date=7 October 1994|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |page=22N |id={{Factiva|chi0000020011028dqa700wzz}}}}\n* {{Citation |title=W.

Despite a purchase offer from the [[private equity]] firm Najafi Companies, Borders was not able to find a buyer acceptable to its creditors before its July bidding deadline, so it began liquidating its remaining 399 retail outlets, with the last remaining stores closing their doors in September.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/Borders?sk=app_205521576149308|title=Log In or Sign Up to View|website=www.facebook.com}}</ref> The Chapter 11 case was ultimately converted to [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Ovide|first=Shira|title=Bookstore Chain Borders Is Dead|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2011/07/18/its-almost-official-borders-is-dead|accessdate=July 28, 2011|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=July 18, 2011}}</ref> Rival bookseller [[Barnes & Noble]] acquired Borders' trademarks and customer list.\n\nBy the end of December 2010, Borders employed an estimated 1,150 across its U.K. stores, which went into bankruptcy administration before the end of 2010.<ref>[http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/business/news/4786083.Borders_on_brink Oxford Mail]</ref> All stores were closed by December 31, 2010.

Baking soda offered an alternative, but its popularity declined for a time When  imported high-gluten flours became available. Brown soda bread (served with smoked salmon) reappeared on luxury hotel menus in the 1960s. Modern varieties can be found at Irish cafes and bakeries, some made with [[Guinness]], treacle, [[walnut]]s, and herbs, but the sweetened version with [[caraway]] and [[raisins]] is rarely seen anymore. Soda bread made with raisins is colloquially called \"Spotted Dog\" or \"Spotted Dick\".<ref name=bbc/>\n\nIn [[Ireland]], the flour is typically made from [[soft wheat]], so soda bread is best made with a cake or pastry flour (made from soft wheat), which has lower levels of [[gluten]] than a bread flour. In some recipes, the buttermilk is replaced by live [[yogurt]] or even [[stout]]. Because the leavening action starts immediately (compared to the time taken for yeast bread to rise), bakers recommend the minimum amount of mixing of the ingredients before baking; the dough should not be kneaded.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nVarious forms of soda bread are popular throughout Ireland. Soda breads are made using wholemeal, white flour, or both. In [[Ulster]], the wholemeal variety is usually known as ''wheaten bread'' and is normally sweetened, while the term \"soda bread\" is restricted to the white savoury form. In the southern provinces of Ireland, the wholemeal variety is usually known as ''brown bread'' and is almost identical to the Ulster wheaten. In some parts of [[Fermanagh]], the white flour form of the bread is described as ''fadge''.<ref name=\"FermanaghGoldThread\">{{cite web|title=Fermanagh Gold Thread|url=http://www.archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/FERMANAGH-GOLD/2008-11/1225976149/}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"IrishBlessingsTours\">{{cite web|title=Irish Blessings Tours |url=http://www.irishblessingstours.com/blog/an-authentic-slice-of-ireland/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714134748/http://www.irishblessingstours.com/blog/an-authentic-slice-of-ireland/ |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe \"griddle cakes\", \"griddle bread\" (or ''soda [[farl]]s'' in Ulster) take a more rounded shape and have a cross cut in the top to allow the bread to expand.

It also acts as a layer of protection for the hands during these processes. It is usually supplied as a long strip of perforated paper wrapped around a [[paperboard]] core for storage in a dispenser near a toilet. Most modern toilet paper in the developed world is designed to decompose in [[septic tank]]s, whereas some other bathroom and [[facial tissue]]s are not. Toilet paper comes in various numbers of [[Ply (layer)|plies]] (layers of thickness), from one- to six-ply, with more back-to-back plies providing greater strength and absorbency.\n\nThe use of paper for [[hygiene]] has been recorded in [[China]] in the 6th century AD, with specifically manufactured toilet paper being mass-produced in the 14th century.<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 1 123\"/> Modern commercial toilet paper originated in the 19th century, with a patent for roll-based dispensers being made in 1883.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|List of Chinese inventions}}\n[[File:Nara period toilet paper.jpg|thumb|upright|Anal cleansing instruments known as ''[[shit stick#Chou or Ch\u016b|ch\u016bgi]]'' from the [[Nara period]] (710 to 784) in [[Japan]].

Larger sizes remain available.\n\n===Materials===\nToilet paper products vary greatly in the distinguishing technical factors, such as size, weight, roughness, softness, chemical residues, \"finger-breakthrough\" resistance, water-absorption, etc. The larger companies have very detailed, scientific market surveys to determine which marketing sectors require or demand which of the many technical qualities. Modern toilet paper may have a light coating of aloe or lotion or wax worked into the paper to reduce roughness.\n\nQuality is usually determined by the number of plies (stacked sheets), coarseness, and durability. Low grade institutional toilet paper is typically of the lowest grade of paper, has only one or two plies, is very coarse and sometimes contains small amounts of embedded unbleached/unpulped paper.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/minor-british-institutions-izal-toilet-paper-1727294.html|title=Minor British Institutions: Izal toilet paper|work=The Independent|accessdate=30 May 2015}}</ref> A brand disinfected with [[Carbolic Acid|carbolic acid]] was manufactured in [[Sheffield]] under the Izal brand name by [[Newton, Chambers & Co.|Newton Chambers]] until 1981.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://s10probus.co.uk/the-history-of-izal-joan-jones-7th-march-2016/|title=The History of Izal \u2013 Joan Jones \u2013 7th March 2016 {{!}}|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> Mid-grade two ply is somewhat textured to provide some softness and is somewhat stronger. Premium toilet paper may have lotion and wax and has two to four plies of very finely pulped paper. If it is marketed as \"luxury\", it may be quilted or rippled (embossed), perfumed, colored or patterned, medicated (with anti-bacterial chemicals), or treated with [[aloe]] or other perfumes.\n\nIn order to advance decomposition of the paper in [[septic tank]]s or drainage, the paper used has shorter fibres than facial tissue or writing paper. The manufacturer tries to reach an optimal balance between rapid decomposition (which requires shorter fibres) and sturdiness (which requires longer fibres).  Compaction of toilet paper in drain lines, such as in a clog, prevents fibre dispersion and largely halts the breakdown process.\n\nA German quip says that the toilet paper of [[Nazi Germany]] was so rough and scratchy that it was almost unusable, so many people used old issues of the ''[[V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter]]'' instead, because the paper was softer.<ref>Read, Anthony and Fisher, David ''The Fall of Berlin'' London: Pimlico, 1993.</ref>\n\n===Color and design===\nColored toilet paper in colors such as pink, [[Lavender (color)|lavender]], light blue, light green, purple, green, and light yellow (so that one could choose a color of toilet paper that matched or complemented the color of one's bathroom) was commonly sold in the United States from the 1960s. Up until 2004, [[Scott Paper Company|Scott]] was one of the last remaining U.S. manufacturers to still produce toilet paper in beige, blue, and pink. However, the company has since cut production of colored paper altogether.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/10653941/The-unpalatable-truth-the-colour-has-drained-from-our-bathrooms.html|title=The unpalatable truth: the colour has drained from our bathrooms?|newspaper=The Telegraph|accessdate=23 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nToday, in the United States, plain unpatterned colored toilet paper has been mostly replaced by patterned toilet paper, normally white, with embossed decorative patterns or designs in various colors and different sizes depending on the brand.

Modern toilet paper may have a light coating of aloe or lotion or wax worked into the paper to reduce roughness.\n\nQuality is usually determined by the number of plies (stacked sheets), coarseness, and durability. Low grade institutional toilet paper is typically of the lowest grade of paper, has only one or two plies, is very coarse and sometimes contains small amounts of embedded unbleached/unpulped paper.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/minor-british-institutions-izal-toilet-paper-1727294.html|title=Minor British Institutions: Izal toilet paper|work=The Independent|accessdate=30 May 2015}}</ref> A brand disinfected with [[Carbolic Acid|carbolic acid]] was manufactured in [[Sheffield]] under the Izal brand name by [[Newton, Chambers & Co.|Newton Chambers]] until 1981.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://s10probus.co.uk/the-history-of-izal-joan-jones-7th-march-2016/|title=The History of Izal \u2013 Joan Jones \u2013 7th March 2016 {{!}}|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> Mid-grade two ply is somewhat textured to provide some softness and is somewhat stronger.

If it is marketed as \"luxury\", it may be quilted or rippled (embossed), perfumed, colored or patterned, medicated (with anti-bacterial chemicals), or treated with [[aloe]] or other perfumes.\n\nIn order to advance decomposition of the paper in [[septic tank]]s or drainage, the paper used has shorter fibres than facial tissue or writing paper. The manufacturer tries to reach an optimal balance between rapid decomposition (which requires shorter fibres) and sturdiness (which requires longer fibres).  Compaction of toilet paper in drain lines, such as in a clog, prevents fibre dispersion and largely halts the breakdown process.\n\nA German quip says that the toilet paper of [[Nazi Germany]] was so rough and scratchy that it was almost unusable, so many people used old issues of the ''[[V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter]]'' instead, because the paper was softer.<ref>Read, Anthony and Fisher, David ''The Fall of Berlin'' London: Pimlico, 1993.</ref>\n\n===Color and design===\nColored toilet paper in colors such as pink, [[Lavender (color)|lavender]], light blue, light green, purple, green, and light yellow (so that one could choose a color of toilet paper that matched or complemented the color of one's bathroom) was commonly sold in the United States from the 1960s. Up until 2004, [[Scott Paper Company|Scott]] was one of the last remaining U.S. manufacturers to still produce toilet paper in beige, blue, and pink. However, the company has since cut production of colored paper altogether.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/10653941/The-unpalatable-truth-the-colour-has-drained-from-our-bathrooms.html|title=The unpalatable truth: the colour has drained from our bathrooms?|newspaper=The Telegraph|accessdate=23 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nToday, in the United States, plain unpatterned colored toilet paper has been mostly replaced by patterned toilet paper, normally white, with embossed decorative patterns or designs in various colors and different sizes depending on the brand. Colored toilet paper remains commonly available in some European countries.\n\n==Installation==\n[[File:Toilet tissue roll on seat.jpg|thumb|Toilet paper is also used for spreading on seat before sitting]]\n===Dispensers===\n{{main|Toilet roll holder}}\nA toilet roll holder, also known as a toilet paper dispenser, is an item that holds a roll of toilet paper. There are at least seven types of holders:\n# A horizontal piece of wire mounted on a hinge, hanging from a door or wall.\n# A horizontal axle recessed in the wall.\n# A vertical axle recessed in the wall\n# A horizontal axle mounted on a freestanding frame.\n# A freestanding vertical pole on a base.\n# A wall mounted dispensing unit, usually containing more than one roll. This is used in the commercial / away-from-home marketplace.\n# A wall mounted dispensing unit with tissue interfolded in a \"S\" type leave so the user can extract the tissue one sheet at a time.\n\nSome commercial or institutional toilet paper is wrapped around a cylinder to many times the thickness of a standard toilet paper roll.\n\n===Orientation===\n{{main|Toilet paper orientation}}\nThere are two choices of orientation when using a holder with a [[horizontal plane|horizontal]] [[axle]] [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the [[wall]]: the toilet paper may hang ''over'' or ''under'' the roll. The choice is largely a matter of personal preference, dictated by [[habit (psychology)|habit]]. In surveys of [[United States|American]] consumers and of bath and kitchen specialists, 60-70% of respondents prefer ''over''.  This is said to exhibit [[Endianness#Etymology|Endianness]], which applies not only to [[eggs]], but to [[toilet paper]].  Most Americans think it should go over the top, like a [[waterfall]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.maxim.com/news/toilet-paper-direction-2016-4 |title=What the Direction Your Toilet Paper Hangs Says About You According to Science: Under or over? |first1=Zeynep |last1=Yenisey |date=April 5, 2016 |work=[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]] |accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Decoration===\n{{main|Hotel toilet paper folding}}\n''Toilegami'' refers to toilet paper [[origami]].

The bay, the only deep sea port between Adelaide and Melbourne, offers a sheltered anchorage against the often wild weather of [[Bass Strait]].\n\nBy the early 19th century, whalers and sealers were working the treacherous waters of Bass Strait, and Portland Bay provided good shelter and fresh water, which enabled them to establish the first white settlement in the area. Whaling captain [[William Dutton (captain)|William Dutton]] is known to have been resident in the Portland Bay area when the Henty clan arrived, and is said to have provided seed potatoes for the Henty garden.\n \nIn 1834, [[Edward Henty]] and his family, who had migrated from England to [[Western Australia]] in 1829, and then moved to [[Van Diemen's Land]], ferried some of their stock across the Strait in search of the fine grazing land of the [[Western District, Victoria|Western District]].\n\nAfter a voyage of 34 days, the Thistle arrived at Portland Bay on 19 November 1834.

This tug called \"Towalong\", was restored in Portland.]] -->\nThrough the 19th century Portland developed to become an important fishing port providing for the town and later, with the connection of the railway, to the region as far afield as Ballarat and eventually Melbourne. [[Barracouta]], [[Australian salmon]] and crayfish (now [[southern rock lobster]]) were the main catches with many fishermen working the bay, around the [[Lawrence Rocks]] and in the season, [[Cape Bridgewater|Bridgewater Bay]].\n\nPortland harbour enabled the development of the woolgrowing industry of the Western District, but has eventually it lost its primacy to facilities at [[Geelong]]. Even in western Victoria, Portland fell behind [[Warrnambool, Victoria|Warrnambool]] as the main commercial centre. In the 20th century Portland's role as a port revived, and its economy was also boosted by the tourism industry and an [[aluminium]] smelter.\n\nThe port of Portland was sold in 1996 by the State Government to a group including the listed New Zealand company Infratil & the Scott Corporation (owned by [[Allan Scott (businessman)|Allan Scott]]), the first privatisation of port facilities in Australia. Since then, it has been traded a number of times and is now owned by two institutional investors \u2013 the publicly listed Australian Infrastructure Fund and Utilities Trust of Australia, a private infrastructure fund \u2013 both of which are managed by Hastings Funds Management.\n\nAs new [[supertanker]]s have emerged, Portland, along with [[Hastings, Victoria|Hastings]] in [[Western Port]] Bay was proposed as an alternative to the controversial plans for deepening of Melbourne's shallower [[Port Phillip]].  The plans are aimed at maintaining Victoria's shipping status (since Melbourne has become Australia's busiest port, the Victorian economy relies heavily on the import and export of goods). Due to environmental reasons, the plan to deepen Port Phillip has been heavily criticised, whereas Portland offers some of the necessary infrastructure with minimum environmental impact.\n\nThe Port of Portland has received major assistance through public funding of an A$18 million overpass which gives better access to the port for heavy traffic The Glenelg Shire Council has recently adopted<ref>[http://www.glenelg.vic.gov.au/Files/FinalReportPortlandCoastalInfrastructurePlan.pdf]</ref> a plan for the redesign and development of the foreshore precinct including a new multi purpose marina in the north-west corner of the harbour.\n\n=== Portland Aluminium ===\n{{Main|Portland aluminium smelter}}\n\n[[Alcoa]] is Victoria's largest exporter.

The bay, the only deep sea port between Adelaide and Melbourne, offers a sheltered anchorage against the often wild weather of [[Bass Strait]].\n\nBy the early 19th century, whalers and sealers were working the treacherous waters of Bass Strait, and Portland Bay provided good shelter and fresh water, which enabled them to establish the first white settlement in the area. Whaling captain [[William Dutton (captain)|William Dutton]] is known to have been resident in the Portland Bay area when the Henty clan arrived, and is said to have provided seed potatoes for the Henty garden.\n \nIn 1834, [[Edward Henty]] and his family, who had migrated from England to [[Western Australia]] in 1829, and then moved to [[Van Diemen's Land]], ferried some of their stock across the Strait in search of the fine grazing land of the [[Western District, Victoria|Western District]].\n\nAfter a voyage of 34 days, the Thistle arrived at Portland Bay on 19 November 1834.

They were present when the early commercial sealers like William Dutton arrived and when the Henty family created what would become Victoria's first permanent European settlement. It has been argued whether Dutton was first, but he was considered to be somewhat itinerant by the establishment of the era and not the discoverer of this deepwater bay and fertile hinterland. Henty sowed the first Victorian wheat crop on cliff top land, known today as 'The Ploughed Field'.\n\nOne highly notable incident called the [[Convincing Ground massacre]] occurred in Portland Bay in 1833 or 1834 in a dispute about a [[Beached whale]] between whalers and the ''Kilcarer gundidj'' clan of the [[Gunditjmara]] people.<ref name=\"clark\">''Scars on the Landscape: A Register of Massacre sites in Western Victoria 1803\u20131859'' by Ian D.

Its postcode is 3305.\n\n==Economy==\n\n===Port===\n[[File:Marina portland early morning.png|right|thumb|upright|Boat marina in Portland Harbour, facing west.]]\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Towalong.png|right|thumb|Portland harbour. This tug called \"Towalong\", was restored in Portland.]] -->\nThrough the 19th century Portland developed to become an important fishing port providing for the town and later, with the connection of the railway, to the region as far afield as Ballarat and eventually Melbourne. [[Barracouta]], [[Australian salmon]] and crayfish (now [[southern rock lobster]]) were the main catches with many fishermen working the bay, around the [[Lawrence Rocks]] and in the season, [[Cape Bridgewater|Bridgewater Bay]].\n\nPortland harbour enabled the development of the woolgrowing industry of the Western District, but has eventually it lost its primacy to facilities at [[Geelong]]. Even in western Victoria, Portland fell behind [[Warrnambool, Victoria|Warrnambool]] as the main commercial centre. In the 20th century Portland's role as a port revived, and its economy was also boosted by the tourism industry and an [[aluminium]] smelter.\n\nThe port of Portland was sold in 1996 by the State Government to a group including the listed New Zealand company Infratil & the Scott Corporation (owned by [[Allan Scott (businessman)|Allan Scott]]), the first privatisation of port facilities in Australia. Since then, it has been traded a number of times and is now owned by two institutional investors \u2013 the publicly listed Australian Infrastructure Fund and Utilities Trust of Australia, a private infrastructure fund \u2013 both of which are managed by Hastings Funds Management.\n\nAs new [[supertanker]]s have emerged, Portland, along with [[Hastings, Victoria|Hastings]] in [[Western Port]] Bay was proposed as an alternative to the controversial plans for deepening of Melbourne's shallower [[Port Phillip]].  The plans are aimed at maintaining Victoria's shipping status (since Melbourne has become Australia's busiest port, the Victorian economy relies heavily on the import and export of goods). Due to environmental reasons, the plan to deepen Port Phillip has been heavily criticised, whereas Portland offers some of the necessary infrastructure with minimum environmental impact.\n\nThe Port of Portland has received major assistance through public funding of an A$18 million overpass which gives better access to the port for heavy traffic The Glenelg Shire Council has recently adopted<ref>[http://www.glenelg.vic.gov.au/Files/FinalReportPortlandCoastalInfrastructurePlan.pdf]</ref> a plan for the redesign and development of the foreshore precinct including a new multi purpose marina in the north-west corner of the harbour.\n\n=== Portland Aluminium ===\n{{Main|Portland aluminium smelter}}\n\n[[Alcoa]] is Victoria's largest exporter.

The name \"Targa\" came from the [[Targa Florio]] sports car road race in [[Sicily]], Italy in which Porsche had several victories until 1973. The last win in the subsequently discontinued event was scored with a 911 Carrera RS against prototypes entered by [[Ferrari]] and [[Alfa Romeo]].

The overall length of the car did not change, but the rear wheels were relocated further back. Fuel injection arrived for the 911S (901/10 engine) and for a new middle model, 911E (901/09 engine).\n\nThe D series was produced from Aug. 1970 to July 1971.\nThe 2.2-litre 911E (C and D series) had lower power output of the 911/01 engine ({{convert|155|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} at 6,200&nbsp;rpm) compared to the 911S's Type 911/02 ({{convert|180|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} at 6,500&nbsp;rpm), but 911E was quicker in acceleration up to {{convert|160|km/h|mph|0}}.\n\nThe E series for 1972\u20131973 model years (August 1971 to July 1972 production) consisted of the same models, but with a new, larger {{cvt|2341|cc|L|1|abbr=on}} engine. This is known as the \"2.4&nbsp;L\" engine, despite its displacement being closer to 2.3 litres.\nThe 911E (Type 911/52 engine) and 911S (Type 911/53) used Bosch mechanical [[fuel injection]] (MFI) in all markets. For 1972 the 911T (Type 911/57) was [[carburettor|carbureted]], except in the US and some Asian markets where the 911T also came with (MFI) mechanical fuel injection (Type 911/51 engine) with power increase over European models (130&nbsp;hp) to 140&nbsp;hp commonly known as a 911T/E.\n\nWith power and torque increase, the 2.4-litre cars also got a newer, stronger transmission, identified by its Porsche type number 915. Derived from the transmission in the [[Porsche 908|908]] race car, the 915 did away with the 901 transmission's \"dog-leg\" style first gear arrangement, opting for a traditional H pattern with first gear up to the left, second gear underneath first, etc. The E series had the unusual oil filler behind the right side door, with the dry sump oil tank relocated from behind the right rear wheel to the front of it in an attempt to move the center of gravity slightly forward for better handling. An extra oil filler/inspection flap was located on the rear wing, for this reason it became known as an \"Oil Klapper\", \"\u00d6lklappe\" or \"Vierte T\u00fcr (4th door)\".\n\nThe F series (August 1972 to July 1973 production) moved the oil tank back to the original behind-the-wheel location. This change was in response to complaints that gas-station attendants often filled gasoline into the oil tank. In January 1973, US 911Ts were switched to the new [[Jetronic|K-Jetronic]] CIS (Continuous Fuel Injection) system from [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] on Type 911/91 engine.\n\n911S models also gained a small [[Spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]] under the front bumper to improve high-speed stability. The cars weighed {{convert|1050|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The 911 ST was produced in small numbers for racing (the production run for the ST lasted from 1970 to 1971). The cars were available with engines of either {{cvt|3987|cc|L|1|abbr=on}} or {{cvt|3404|cc|L|1|abbr=on}} displacement, having a power output of {{convert|270|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} at 8,000&nbsp;rpm. Weight was down to {{convert|960|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The cars had success at the Daytona 6 Hours, the [[Sebring 12 Hours]], the [[1000 km N\u00fcrburgring]], and the [[Targa Florio]].\n\n===911 Carrera RS (1973 and 1974)===\n[[File:1973 Porsche 911 RS Carrera (35097626702).jpg|thumb|1973 Porsche 911 Carrera RS]]\n[[File:Paris - RM auctions - 20150204 - Porsche 911 Carrera RS 2.7 Touring - 1973 - 005.jpg|thumb|Porsche 911 Carrera RS 2.7 touring]]\n\nRS stands for ''Rennsport'' in German, meaning ''race sport''. The [[Porsche Carrera|Carrera]] name was reintroduced from the 356 Carrera which had itself been named after Porsche's class victories in the [[Carrera Panamericana]] races in Mexico in the 1950s. The RS was developed to meet [[Homologation (motorsport)|motorsport homologation]] requirements. Compared to a standard 911S, the Carrera 2.7 RS had a larger engine (2,687&nbsp;cc) developing {{convert|210|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} with Bosch ([[Kugelfischer]]) mechanical fuel injection, revised and stiffened suspension, a \"ducktail\" rear spoiler, larger brakes, wider rear wheels and rear fenders, to fit 185/70VR15 & 215/60VR15 Pirelli Cinturato CN36 tyres. In RS Touring form it weighed {{convert|1075|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, in Sport Lightweight form it was about {{convert|100|kg|lb|abbr=on}} lighter, the saving coming from thin gauge steel used for parts of the body shell and also the use of thinner glass. In total, 1,580 units were made, and qualified for the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]] class. 49 Carrera RS cars were built with {{cvt|2808|cc|L|1|abbr=on}} engines rated at {{convert|300|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[File:Porsche 911 RSR LM24.jpg|thumb|The 911 RSR]]\n\nFor the 1974 IROC Championship (which started in December 1973), 1973 Carrera RSR models were fitted with the 3.0 engine and a flat \"whale tail\" in place of the ducktail spoiler along with wide body panels and large tyres.\n\nIn 1974, Porsche developed the Carrera RS 3.0 with mechanical fuel injection rated at {{convert|230|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. Its price was almost twice that of the 2.7 RS, but it offered racing capability. The chassis was largely similar to that of the 1973 Carrera RSR and the braking system was from the [[Porsche 917|917]] racing car. The use of thinner metal plate panels and a minimalist interior enabled its weight to be reduced to around {{convert|900|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe Carrera RSR 3.0 was sold to racing teams and scored wins in several major sports car races of the mid-1970s. Also, a prototype Carrera RSR Turbo (with 2.1-litre engine due to a 1.4x equivalency formula) came second at the [[1974 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans in 1974]] and won several major races, a significant event in that its engine would form the basis of many future Porsche attempts in sports car racing. This, and the earlier 917, was Porsche's commitment to [[turbocharger]] applications in its cars.\n\n===911 and 911S 2.7 (1973\u20131977)===\n\nModel year 1974 (G Series August 1973 to July 1974 production) saw three significant changes. First, the engine size was increased to 2,687&nbsp;cc achieving higher torque. Second, new impact [[Bumper (automobile)|bumpers]] conformed with low-speed protection requirements of US regulations. Thirdly, the use of K-Jetronic CIS Bosch fuel injection in two of the three models in the line up&mdash; the 911 and 911S models, retaining the narrow rear arches of the old 2.4, now had a 2.7-litre engine rated at {{convert|150|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|175|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}, respectively. The standard 911 version, received an increase to {{convert|165|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} for Model Year 1976, which meant that starting from MY 1976, there was only a difference in power of 10&nbsp;hp between the 911 and the 911S. The engine remained a K-Jetronic 2.7-litre. The 911S 2.7 engine was rated during the entire lifespan at {{convert|175|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Carrera 2.7 MFI and CIS (1974\u20131976)===\nThe Carrera 2.7 model built for all markets, except for the United States, used the {{convert|210|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} RS 911/83 engine with Bosch mechanical fuel injection pump from the 1973 Carrera RS. These Carrera 2.7 MFI models were built from 1974 until 1976 and were mechanically identical to the 1973 Carrera RS. The Carrera 2.7 model produced for the North American markets, often referred to as the Carrera 2.7 CIS, was powered by the same 2.7-litre engine as the 911S which produced {{convert|175|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. The initial Carrera 2.7 models had the same welded-on rear RS flares, before switching to the SC stamped style rear flares during the middle of the 1974 production year. The Carrera 2.7 coup\u00e9s weighed in at {{convert|1075|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, the same weight as the 1973 Carrera RS Touring.\n\nFor the 1974 model year, the Carrera 2.7 was available with the \"ducktail\" rear spoiler first introduced with the 1973 Carrera RS. In the North American markets the ducktail was standard equipment for the Carrera. All other markets the ducktail was optional, except for the home German market where the ducktail had been outlawed by the T\u00dcV road homologation department. This led to the introduction of the whale tail rear spoiler, available as an option on the 1974-75 Carrera 2.7 models, as well as the newly introduced 930 Turbo.\n\nThe Carrera 2.7 was replaced by the Carrera 3.0 for the 1976 model year, except for a special run of 113 1976 Carrera 2.7 MFI coup\u00e9s were built for the German market featuring the 911/83 RS engine, with an additional 20 narrow-bodied 1976 Carrera MFI 2.7 Targas being supplied to the Belgian Gendarmerie. The 1976 Carrera 2.7 MFI Sondermodells were the last mechanically fuel injected 911 produced by Porsche, and still featured the 1973 RS engine.\n\n===912E (1976)===\n\nFor the 1976 model year, the 912E was produced for the U.S. market. This was 4-cylinder version of the 911 in the same manner as the 912 that had last been produced in 1969. It used the I-series chassis powered by the [[Volkswagen]] 2.0 engine also used in the [[Porsche 914]] for 1973 through 1975 model years. 2,099 units were produced. The 912E was replaced by the front-engine [[Porsche 924]] for the 1977 model year.\n\n===Carrera 3.0 (1976\u20131977)===\n\n[[File:Porsche 911 Carrera 3.0.JPG|thumbnail|left|Porsche 911 Carrera 3.0]]\n[[File:Porsche 911 Carrera 3.0 1976.JPG|thumbnail|right|Porsche 911 Carrera 3.0]]\n\nFor the 1976 model year, Porsche introduced the Carrera 3.0 with wide rear flares, optional whaletail, and a variety of other luxury options. It was available in all markets except North America. The Carrera 3.0 was fitted with a variation of the 930 Turbo's 2994&nbsp;cc engine (minus the [[turbocharger]]). The engine (dubbed the 930/02) featured K-Jetronic CIS. It developed {{convert|200|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} in contrast to the older Carrera 2.7 MFI model's {{convert|210|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. The crankcase and gearbox housing were made of aluminium rather than magnesium for improved reliability. Magnesium cases were renown for thermal expansion/contraction issues as engines grew in displacement and heat generation also increased.\n\nThe new engine, which featured bigger intake and exhaust valves, produced greater torque allowing the Carrera 3.0 to achieve the same performance as the previous Carrera 2.7, {{convert|0|\u2013|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in 6.1 seconds and {{convert|0|\u2013|200|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in 27 seconds. Both versions boasted a top speed of approximately {{convert|236|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.\n\nWeight increased marginally by {{convert|45|kg|lb|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1120|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe 911 Carrera 3.0 was produced in both targa (1,125 examples produced) and coup\u00e9 (2,566) versions. The Carrera 3.0 was available with manual gearbox (type 915) with 4 or 5 speeds as well as 3-speed automatic transmission (called the Sportomatic). Production totals were 3,691 manual cars and 58 Sportomatic cars.\n\n===930 Turbo and Turbo Carrera 3.0-litre (1975\u20131977)===\n{{Main|Porsche 930}}\n[[File:Nationale oldtimerdag Zandvoort 2010, Red Porsche.JPG|thumb|Porsche 911 Turbo (930)]]\nFor the 1975 model year, Porsche introduced the first production [[turbocharged]] 911. Although called the 930 Turbo (930 being its internal type number) in Europe, it was marketed as the 930 Turbo Carrera in North America. The body shape incorporated wide wheel-arches to accommodate the wide 205/50R15 & 225/50R15 Pirelli P7 tyres, and a large rear spoiler often known as a \"[[Whale tail (automotive spoiler)|whale tail]]\" on the early cars (modified from the original 1974 IROC design). They were initially fitted with a 3.0-litre engine {{convert|260|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} and four-speed manual transmission.\n\n[[File:Porsche 934 Turbo (9224976479).jpg|thumb|The Porsche 934, one of the first racing versions of the 930 Turbo]]\n[[File:1979 Porsche 935 (20202549045).jpg|thumb|The Porsche 935 known for its signature \"slant nose\" front]]\n\nProduction of the first 400 units qualified the 930 for FIA Group 4 competition. With the racing version called the [[Porsche 934]] of 1976 participating at the [[Le Mans 24 Hours|24 Hours of Le Mans]] and other races including battles with the [[BMW E9|BMW 3.0 CSL \"Batmobile\"]]. The [[Group 5 (racing)|FIA Group 5]] version called [[Porsche 935]] evolved from the 934. Fitted with a slope nose or \"slant nose\", the 500+ PS car was campaigned in 1976 by the factory, winning the world championship title. Private teams went on to win many races, like Le Mans in 1979, and continued to compete successfully with the car well into the 1980s until the FIA and IMSA rules were changed.\n\n===930 Turbo 3.3-litre (1978\u20131989)===\n{{Main|Porsche 930}}\n[[File:12-01-03-autostadtl-by-RalfR-81.jpg|thumb|Porsche 930 3.3-litre, distinguished by its raised \"whale-tail\" rear wing]]\n\nFor the 1978 model year, Porsche revised the 930 with a larger 3.3-litre [[turbocharged]] engine with intercooler rated at {{convert|300|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. To fit the intercooler a newly designed \"tea-tray\" tail spoiler replaced the earlier whale tail spoiler. Porsche dropped the \"Carrera\" nomenclature for the North American markets and the car was simply called the Porsche 911 Turbo worldwide. The larger engine helped reduce some of the turbo lag inherent in the earlier models.\n\nIn 1989, a 5-speed manual transmission became available for the 930. The 930 was replaced in 1990 with the [[Porsche 964|964]] turbo featuring the same 3.3-litre engine. There have been turbocharged variants of each subsequent generation of 911 since then.\n\n===911SC (1978\u20131983)===\n\n[[File:1983Porsche911SC.JPG|thumb|1983 Porsche 911 Super Carrera, the last production year of the Super Carrera]]\n[[File:1000pistestoivonen84.jpg|thumb|[[Henri Toivonen]] at ''rallye des 1000 pistes'' in 1984 on a Porsche 911 SC RS]]\n\nIn 1978, Porsche introduced the new version of the 911, called the '911SC'. Porsche reintroduced the SC designation for the first time since the 356SC (as distinguished from the race engined 356 Carrera). There was no Carrera version of the 911SC. The \"SC\" stands for \"Super Carrera\". It featured a 3.0-litre aluminum engine with Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection and a 5-speed 915 transmission. Originally power output was {{convert|180|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}, later {{convert|191|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} and then in 1981 it was increased to {{convert|204|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. The move to an aluminum engine was to regain case reliability, something missing for many years with magnesium. In 1981 a Cabriolet concept car was introduced at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]]. The [[convertible]] body design also featured [[four-wheel drive]], although this was dropped in the production version. The first 911 Cabriolet debuted in late 1982, as a 1983 model. This was Porsche's first cabriolet since the [[Porsche 356|356]] of the mid-1960s. A total of 4,214 were sold in its introductory year, despite its premium price relative to the open-top targa.<ref name=Seventy>P. 77 Paternie, P (2000). Porsche 911 Red Book 1965\u20131999 Motorbooks International. {{ISBN|0-7603-0723-7}}</ref> Cabriolet versions of the 911 have been offered ever since.\n\nIn 1979, Porsche had made plans to replace the 911 with their new [[Porsche 928|928]] company [[halo car|flagship]]. Sales of the 911 remained so strong however, that Porsche revised its strategy and decided to inject new life into the 911 editions. 911 SC sales totaled 58,914 cars.<ref name=Seventy/>\n\n[[Peter W. Schutz]] (CEO Porsche AG 1981\u20131987) wrote: {{quotation|\nThe decision to keep the 911 in the product line occurred one afternoon in the office of Dr. Helmuth Bott [[:de:Helmuth Bott]], the Porsche operating board member responsible for all engineering and development. I noticed a chart on the wall of Professor Bott's office. It depicted the ongoing development schedules for the three primary Porsche product lines: [[Porsche 944|944]], 928 and 911. Two of them stretched far into the future, but the 911 program stopped at the end of 1981. I remember rising from my chair, walking over to the chart, taking a black marker pen, and extending the 911 program bar clean off the chart. I am sure I heard a silent cheer from Professor Bott, and I knew I had done the right thing. The Porsche 911, the company icon, had been saved, and I believe the company was saved with it.<ref>Corlett, p. 6</ref>}}\n\n===Carrera 3.2 (1984\u20131989)===\n\n[[File:1987 911carrera Jubi Targa und TLcabrio.jpg|thumb|right|1987 Porsche 911 ''Carrera Cabriolet'' and \"Carrera Targa\"]]\n\nThe replacement for the SC series came in 1984 as the 911 3.2 Carrera, reviving the Carrera name for the first time since 1977. This was the last iteration in the original 911 series, with all subsequent models featuring new body styling and new brake, electronic, and suspension technologies.\n\nA new higher-displacement engine, a 3.2-litre horizontally opposed flat 6-cylinder unit, was utilized. At the time Porsche claimed it was 80% new.<ref>Corlett, p. 13</ref> The new swept volume of 3,164 cc was achieved using the {{convert|95|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} bore (from the previous SC model) combined with the 1978 Turbo 3.3 crankshaft's {{convert|74.4|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} stroke. In addition, higher domed pistons increased the compression ratio from 9.8 to 10.3:1 (9.5:1 for the US market). New inlet manifold and exhaust systems were fitted. The 915 transmission was carried over from the SC series for the first three model years. In 1987, the Carrera got a new five-speed gearbox sourced from [[Getrag]], model number G50 with proven [[BorgWarner]] synchronizers. This slightly heavier version also featured a hydraulically operated clutch.\n\nWith the new engine, power was increased to {{convert|207|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} (at 5,900&nbsp;rpm) for North American-delivered cars and to {{convert|237|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} (at 5,900&nbsp;rpm) for most other markets. This version of the 911 accelerated {{convert|0|\u2013|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} in 5.4 seconds and had a top speed of {{convert|150|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} as measured by ''[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]]''. Factory figures were more modest: 0\u201360&nbsp;mph time of 6.3 seconds for the US version and 6.1 seconds for cars outside the American market.\n\nThe brake discs were increased in size to aid in more effective heat dissipation and improved oil-fed chain tensioners were fitted to the engine. To improve oil cooling, a finned cooler replaced the serpentine lines in the front passenger fender well. This was further improved in 1987, with the addition of a thermostatically controlled fan.\n\nDriving refinement and motor reliability were improved with an upgrade of the fuel and [[Ignition system|ignition]] control components to an [[Jetronic|L-Jetronic]] with Bosch Motronics 2 DME (Digital Motor Electronics system). An improvement in fuel-efficiency was due to the DME providing a petrol cut-off on the overrun. Changes in the fuel map and chip programming from October 1986 further improved the power to {{convert|217|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} (at 5,900&nbsp;rpm) for North American delivered cars as well as for other markets mandating low emissions, like Germany.\n\nThree basic models were available \u2013 coup\u00e9, targa and cabriolet. The Carrera is almost indistinguishable from the SC with the external clue being the front fog lights that were integrated into the front valance. Only cosmetic changes were made during the production of the Carrera, with a redesigned dashboard featuring larger air conditioning vents appearing in 1986.\n\nIn 1984, Porsche also introduced the M491 option. Officially called the Supersport in the UK, it was commonly known as the \"Turbo-look\".{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} It was a style that resembled the 930 Turbo with wide wheel arches and the distinctive \"tea tray\" tail. It featured the stiffer suspension shared with the turbo and the superior turbo braking system as well as the wider turbo wheels. Sales of the Supersport were high for its first two years in the United States because the desirable 930 was not available.\n\n[[File:Porsche Carrera CS registered August 1988 3164cc.jpg|thumb|right|1988 Porsche Carrera CS]]\n\nIn 1985, Porsche introduced the first Carrera Club Sport prototype with the identification number WP0ZZZ91ZF100848. Later on in that year, a 911 Club Sport Row (Rest Of World) with the identification number WP0ZZZ91ZFS101166 was special ordered for a Porsche driver that was particularly inspired by the CS prototype on the track. From 1987 to September 1989, Porsche decided to produced 340 units for their customers that wanted a track inspired road car, The 911 Carrera Club Sport (CS) (option M637), is a reduced weight version of the standard Carrera purposely built for club racing, it gained engine and suspension modifications. The CS had a blueprinted engine with hollow intake valves and a higher rev limit, deletion of: all power options, sunroof (except one unit), air conditioning (except two units), radio, rear seat, undercoating, sound insulation, rear wiper, door pocket lids, fog lamps, front hood locking mechanism, engine and luggage compartment lights, lockable wheel nuts and even the rear lid \"Carrera\" logo, all in order to save an estimated {{convert|70|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in weight. With the exception of CS cars delivered to the UK, all are identifiable by the \"CS Club Sport\" decal on the left front fender and came in a variety of colors, some special ordered. Some U.S. CS cars did not have the decal installed by the dealer; however, all have a \"SP\" stamp on the crankcase and cylinder head. The UK cars were all finished \"Grand Prix White\" with a red \"Carrera CS\" decal on each side of the car and red wheels. Although the CS was well received by the club racers, because it cost more than the standard 911, but had fewer comfort features. According to Porsche Club of America and Porsche Club Great Britain CS Registers, 21 are documented as delivered to the U.S. in 1988 with 7 in 1989, one to Canada in 1988 and 53 to the United Kingdom from 1987 to 1989.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn 1988, Porsche produced 875 examples of the CE or Commemorative Edition 911 Carrera in coupe, targa and cabriolet variants to mark the production of the 250,000th 911. Distinguishing features include special diamond blue metallic paint with color-matched Fuchs wheels, front and rear spoilers, and interior carpets and leather. These cars also featured Dr. Ferdinand Porsche's signature embroidered on the seats in the headrest area. Of the 875 examples produced, only 300 were imported to the US (120 coupes, 100 cabrios and 80 Targas),  250 were sold in Germany, 50 went to the UK, and the remainder to other countries.\n\nFor 1989, Porsche produced the 25th Anniversary Special Edition model to mark the 25th year of 911 production. The 1989 Porsche brochure lists production of 500 U.S. market cars, of which 300 were coup\u00e9s (240 in silver metallic paint and 60 in satin black metallic, and 200 cabriolet models (160 in silver and 40 in black). All had \"silk grey\" leather with black accent piping and silk grey velour carpeting. Included were body color Fuchs wheels in 6x16 (front) and 8x16 (rear), stitched leather console with an outside temperature gauge and a CD or cassette holder, a limited slip differential, and a short shifting gear lever, as well as small bronze \"25th Anniversary Special Edition\" badges\n\n[[File:Porsche-32-speedster.jpg|thumb|Porsche 911 Carrera 3.2 Speedster]]\n\nThe 911 Speedster (option M503), a low-roof version of the Cabriolet which was evocative of the 356 Speedster of the 1950s, was produced in limited numbers (2,104 units) starting in January 1989 until July 1989 as both a narrow body car and a Turbo-look. The narrow version production was 171 units. The Speedster started as a design under Helmuth Bott<!-- [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmuth_Bott] --> in 1983 but was not manufactured until six years later. It was a two-seat convertible that featured a low swept windshield.<ref>Corlett, p. 45</ref>\n\nTotal production of the 911 3.2 Carrera series was 76,473 cars (35,670 coup\u00e9, 19,987 cabrio, 18,468 targa).<ref>Corlett, p. 74</ref>\n\nAccording to the manufacturer, around 150,000 of the 911 cars from the model years 1964 to 1989 are still on the road today.<ref>{{cite press release |url= http://newsroom.porsche.com/en/products/a-fountain-of-youth-for-classic-cars-10719.html |title= A fountain of youth |publisher= newsroom.porsche |date= 27 June 2014 |accessdate= 27 June 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150626152858/http://newsroom.porsche.com/en/products/a-fountain-of-youth-for-classic-cars-10719.html |archive-date= 26 June 2015 |url-status= live |df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n===964 Series (1989\u20131993)===\n{{Main|Porsche 964}}\n[[File:1990 Porsche 911 Carrera 2 (803367948).jpg|thumb|1990 Porsche 911 ''Carrera 2'']]\n\nIn late 1989, the 911 underwent a major evolution with the introduction of the Type 964. With technologies from the [[Porsche 959|959]] flagship model, this would be an important car for Porsche, since the world economy was undergoing [[recession]] and the company could not rely on its image alone. It was launched as the Carrera 4, the \"4\" indicating [[four-wheel-drive]], demonstrating the company's commitment to engineering. [[Drag coefficient]] was down to 0.32. A rear spoiler deployed at high speed, preserving the purity of design when the vehicle was at rest. The chassis was redesigned overall. Coil springs, [[ABS brakes]] and [[power steering]] made their debut. The engine was increased in size to 3,600&nbsp;cc and was rated at 250&nbsp;PS (184&nbsp;kW). The [[rear-wheel-drive]] version, the Carrera 2, arrived a year later.\n\nThe [[Porsche 911#964 Turbo (1990\u20131994)|964 incarnation of the 911 Turbo]] returned in 1990 after an absence from the price lists. At first it used a refined version of the 3.3&nbsp;L engine of the previous Turbo, but two years later a turbocharged engine based on the 3.6&nbsp;L engine of the other 964 models was introduced.\n\nIn 1990, Porsche introduced the ahead-of-its-time [[Tiptronic]] automatic transmission in the 964 Carrera 2, featuring adaptive electronic management and full manual control. The 964 was one of the first cars in the world offered with dual [[airbags]] standard (from 1991), the first being the [[Porsche 944 Turbo|944 Turbo]] (from 1987).\n\n[[File:Porsche Carrera RS - Flickr - Alexandre Pr\u00e9vot.jpg|thumb|Porsche 964 Carrera RS]]\n\nIn 1992, Porsche re-introduced a limited-edition RS model, inspired by the 1973 Carrera RS and emissions-legal in Europe only. In 1993, appeals from American customers resulted in Porsche developing the RS America of which 701 units were built. In 1994, the RS America returned with rear seats. A total of 84 RS America cars were made in 1994. However, while European RS was a homologation special, RS America was an option delete variant of the regular model. The RS 3.8 of 1993 had Turbo-style bodywork, a larger fixed whale tail in place of the electrictronically operated rear spoiler, and a 300&nbsp;PS (221&nbsp;kW) {{cvt|3746|cc|L|1|abbr=on}} engine.\n\nSince the RS/RS America was intended as a no-compromise, higher performance version of the 964, there were four factory options available: a [[limited-slip differential]], AM/FM [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] stereo, air conditioning, and a sunroof. The interior was more basic than a standard 911 as well; for example the interior door panels lacked the armrests and door pockets and had a simple pull strap for the opening mechanism.\n\n====964 Turbo (1990\u20131994)====\n[[File:Porsche 911-964 turbo 1990-1993 frontright 2009-10-04 U.jpg|thumb|left|Porsche 964 Turbo]]\n\nIn 1990 Porsche introduced a [[1991-1992 Porsche 964 Turbo Technical Data|Turbocharged version]] of the 964 series. This car is sometimes mistakenly called 965 (this type number actually referred to a [[Porsche 969|stillborn project]] that would have been a hi-tech turbocharged car in the vein of the 959). For the 1991 through 1993 model years, Porsche produced the 964 Turbo with the 930's proven 3.3&nbsp;L engine, improved to have a power output of 320&nbsp;PS (235&nbsp;kW). 1994 brought the Carrera 2/4's 3.6&nbsp;L engine, now in turbocharged form and sending a staggering {{convert|360|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} to the rear wheels. With the 993 on the way, this car was produced through 1994 and remains rather rare.\n\n===993 Series (1994\u2013mid 1998)===\n{{Main|Porsche 993}}\n[[File:1996 Porsche 911 993 GT2 - Flickr - The Car Spy (4).jpg|thumb|right|The mid-nineties Type 993 had sleeker bodywork. This is the high-performance GT2 variant]]\n\nThe 911 was again revised for model year 1994 under the internal name Type 993. This car was significant as it was the final incarnation of the [[air-cooled]] 911 first introduced in 1964.  Most enthusiasts and collectors consider the 993 to be the best of the air-cooled 911 series.  As Car & Driver noted, \"Porsche's version of the Goldilocks tale is the 993-generation 911, the one many Porschephiles agree that the company got just right,\" with an \"ideal blend of technology and classic 911 air-cooled heritage.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=1995\u201398 Porsche 911 Carrera Buyer's Guide [Econo-Exotics] |url=http://blog.caranddriver.com/1995-98-porsche-911-carrera-buyers-guide-econo-exotics/ |date=2 May 2013 |first=James |last=Tate |work=Car and Driver |accessdate=24 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319183643/http://blog.caranddriver.com/1995-98-porsche-911-carrera-buyers-guide-econo-exotics/ |archive-date=19 March 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  Porsche itself refers to the 993 as \"a significant advance, not just from a technical, but also a visual perspective.\"<ref>http://www.porsche.com/usa/accessoriesand services/classic/models/993/993/</ref> \"993s especially [are] widely regarded as the best the 911 ever got.\"<ref>James Edition, 28 April 2015, \"The Classic Porsche 911 Market Continues to Surprise.\"</ref>\n\nThe exterior featured all-new front and rear ends. The revised bodywork was smoother, having a noticeably more aerodynamic front end somewhat reminiscent of the [[Porsche 959|959]]. Styling was by Englishman Tony Hatter under the supervision of design chief [[Harm Lagaay]] and was completed in 1991.\n\nAlong with the revised bodywork, mechanically the 993 also featured an all-new multilink rear suspension that improved the car's ride and handling. This rear suspension was largely derived from the stillborn [[Porsche 989]]'s rear multilink design, and served to rectify the problems with earlier models' tendency to oversteer if the throttle or brakes were applied mid-corner. These modifications also reduced previous 911's lift-off oversteer problems to a much more moderate degree.\n\n[[File:Porsche 993 RS Clubsport (3).jpg|thumb|The Porsche 993 Carrera RS continued the tradition of a light weight and minimalist 911 beginning with the 1973 Carrera RS]]\n\nThe new suspension, along with chassis refinements, enabled the car to keep up dynamically with the competition. Engine capacity remained at 3.6&nbsp;L, but power rose to 272&nbsp;PS (200&nbsp;kW / 268&nbsp;hp) due to better engine management and exhaust design, and beginning with model year 1996 to 286&nbsp;PS (210&nbsp;kW / 281&nbsp;hp). The 993 was the first Porsche to debut variable-length intake runners with the \"Varioram\" system on 1996 models. This addressed the inherent compromise between high-rpm power production and low-rpm torque production, and was one of the first of its kind to be employed on production vehicles. However, the Varioram version with its OBD II had issues with carbon deposits, resulting in failed smog tests. This caused expensive repairs, and made comparisons with the 1995 car (with OBD I and just 12&nbsp;hp less) inevitable. Meanwhile, a new four-wheel-drive system was introduced as an option in the form of the Carrera 4, the [[rear-wheel drive|rear-wheel-drive]] versions simply being called Carrera or C2. A lightweight RS variant had a 3.8&nbsp;L engine rated at 300&nbsp;PS (221&nbsp;kW / 296&nbsp;hp), and was only rear-wheel drive.\n\n[[File:Porsche, Techno-Classica 2018, Essen (IMG 9738).jpg|thumb|right|The Porsche 993 Targa had a departure from the classic Targa design, incorporating an expensive glass sliding roof mechanism]]\n\nThe Targa open-topped model also made a return, this time with a large glass roof that slid under the rear window. The expensive air-cooled 993 Targa had a limited production run between 1996 and 1998.

The similarity in specification and in performance levels inspired several comparison road tests with the 959.<ref>(f.e. [[Car and Driver]], July 1997, p. 63)</ref> The 3.6&nbsp;L twin-turbocharged M64/60 engine is rated at 408&nbsp;PS (300&nbsp;kW / 402&nbsp;hp). The performance was outstanding at the time, as 0 to 97&nbsp;km/h (60&nbsp;mph) has been measured at 3.2 seconds, and the braking was even more impressive in 2.3 seconds from the same speed. The car's top speed was measured at {{cvt|200|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} at 7,000 rpm. The differences were striking - the 959 had a much smaller engine, sequential turbocharging and a computer controlled all wheel drive system. The 993 turbo had parallel turbochargers, 3.6 litres of displacement, and a viscous coupling for the center differential in the AWD drivetrain. The turbo was only produced in 1996 and 1997 model years. The main difference was that the ECU in the 1996 model year could not be flashed for an upgrade, while the 1997 could. Additionally, the 1996 year had Porsche crested centre caps on the wheels, while the 1997 had turbo inscribed. Another difference is the motion sensor and map lights above the interior rear view mirror on the 1997 while the 1996 had no such devices.\n\nIn 1997, Porsche introduced a limited run of 183 units of the Sport version of the 993 turbo dubbed the turbo S. With 24&nbsp;PS (17.7&nbsp;kW) over the regular Turbo's 408&nbsp;PS (300&nbsp;kW), features include a scoop on the side right behind the doors for engine cooling and vents on the whale tail rear spoiler. Aside from an upgraded ECU mapping, a centre oil cooler behind the centre air intake at the front bumper was added.\n\n==Water-cooled engines (1998\u2013present)==\n\n===996 (1998/9\u20132004)===\n{{Main|Porsche 996}}\n\n[[File:2002 911C4S.JPG|thumb|right|2002 [[Porsche 996|996]] Carrera 4S]]\nThe Type 996 introduced in 1998 represented two major changes for the venerable 911 lineage: a [[water-cooled]] flat-6 engine replaced the popular air-cooled engine used in the 911 for 34&nbsp;years, and the body shell received its first major re-design. Changing to a water-cooled engine was controversial with Porsche traditionalists, who noted this as the end of the 'true' 911.\n\nThe 996 styling shared its front end with Porsche's mid engine entry-level [[Porsche Boxster|Boxster]]. Pinky Lai's work on the exterior won international design awards between 1997 and 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.designnstyling.com/|title=::Design & Styling|work=designnstyling.com|accessdate=24 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150129123936/http://www.designnstyling.com/|archive-date=29 January 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Carrera variant had a 0.30 [[coefficient of drag]]. The interior was criticized for its plainness and its lack of relationship to prior 911 interiors, although this came largely from owners of older 911s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport911.com/porsche911.html|title=AutoSport911|publisher=autosport911.com|accessdate=26 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127201500/http://www.autosport911.com/porsche911.html|archive-date=27 November 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Type 996 spawned over a dozen variations, including an all-wheel-drive Carrera 4 and Carrera 4S (the latter which had a 'Turbo look' in facelift form) models, the club racing-oriented [[Porsche 911 GT3|GT3]] and GT3 RS instead of a Carrera RS variant and the [[turbocharging|forced-induction]] 996 Turbo and [[Porsche 911 GT2|GT2]]. The Turbo, which was four-wheel-drive and had a  [[twin-turbocharged]] engine, often made appearances in magazines' lists of the best cars on sale.\n\nThe Carrera and Carrera 4 underwent revisions for 2002 model year, receiving clear lens front and rear indicator lights which were first seen on the Turbo version two years earlier. This allowed the 911 to be more distinguishable from the Boxster. A mildly revised front fascia was also introduced, though the basic architecture remained.\n\nEngine displacement was 3.4&nbsp;L and power \noutput was {{convert|300|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} featuring a change to an \"integrated dry sump\" design and variable valve timing. The displacement was increased in 2002 to 3.6&nbsp;L and power received an increase to 320&nbsp;PS (235&nbsp;kW).\n\nThe folding roof mechanism on the convertible variants required 19 seconds for operation. An electronically adjustable rear spoiler was installed that raised at speeds over 120&nbsp;km/h (75&nbsp;mph). It could also be raised manually by means of an electric switch.\n\nStarting from the models with water-cooled engines, all variants of the 911 Carrera do not come with rear [[limited-slip differential]], except the 40th Anniversary 911, GT2, GT3 and Turbo. The exception would be for MY1999 where the limited-slip differential was available as option code 220.{{citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=June 2012}}\n\n====996 GT3 (1999\u20132004)====\n[[File:Porsche 996 GT3 - Flickr - Alexandre Pr\u00e9vot (3).jpg|thumb|left|996 GT3]]\n[[File:Porsche exhibition at Oca, Parque do Ibirapuera 2018 057.jpg|thumb|right|996 GT3 RS]]\n\nPorsche introduced a road legal GT3 version of the 996 series which was derived from the company's racing car used in the GT3 class racing. Simply called GT3, the car featured lightweight materials including thinner windows and deletion of the rear seats. The GT3 was a lighter and more focused design with the emphasis on handling and performance, a concept that dates back to the 1973 Carrera RS. The suspension ride height was lowered and tuned for responsiveness over compliance and comfort. These revisions improved handling and steering. Of more significance was the engine used in the GT3. Instead of using a version of the water-cooled units found in other 996 models, the naturally aspirated engine was derived from the [[Porsche 911 GT1#1998|911 GT1 '98]] sports-prototype racing car and featured lightweight materials which enabled the engine to have higher rpm.\n\nThe engine used was a naturally aspirated {{cvt|3600|cc|L|1|abbr=on}} flat-six rather than the engine from the pre-facelift and revised Carrera. It is rated at {{convert|365|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at first and later improved to {{convert|386|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at the end of the 996 series' revision.\n\n====996 Turbo (2001\u20132005)====\n[[File:Porsche 996 Turbo - Flickr - Alexandre Pr\u00e9vot (15).jpg|thumb|996 Turbo]]\n\n[[File:Techno Classica 2018, Essen (IMG 0015).jpg|thumb|right|996 Turbo S]]\n\nIn 2000, Porsche launched the turbocharged version of the Type 996 for the 2001 model year. Like the GT3, the Turbo's engine was derived from the engine used in the 911 GT1 and, like its predecessor, featured twin-turbos and now had a power output of {{cvt|420|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Two/> Also like its predecessor, the new Turbo was only available with all-wheel drive. In 2002, the X50 package was available that increased the engine output to {{cvt|450|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} with {{cvt|620|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque across a wide section of the power band. With the X50 package, the car could accelerate from 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (0\u201362&nbsp;mph) in 3.91&nbsp;seconds. Later on toward the end of the 996 life cycle, the Turbo S nameplate also returned with the debut of the cabriolet variant as well. The Turbo S boasted even more power&mdash; 450&nbsp;PS (331&nbsp;kW) and 620&nbsp;N\u00b7m (457&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft<sub>f</sub>)&mdash; than the standard Turbo courtesy of the X50 package being standard. The Turbo S was limited to 1,500 units worldwide. The Turbo can attain a top speed of {{convert|189|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}}.<ref name=Two>Paternie, p. 92</ref>\n\nThe styling was more individual than the previous generations of the Turbo. Along with the traditional wider rear wing, the 996 Turbo had different front lights and bumpers when compared to the Carrera and Carrera 4. The rear bumper had air vents reminiscent of those on the 959 and there were large vents on the front bumper.\n\n===997 (2005\u20132012)===\n{{Main|Porsche 997}}\n[[File:Porsche 911 (997) Carrera - Flickr - The Car Spy (11).jpg|thumb|right|997 Carrera]]\n[[File:Porsche Carrera 4S front 20080519.jpg|thumb|right|997 Carrera S]]\n[[File:Porsche 911 Carrera 4S 997.jpg|thumb|997 Carrera 4S]]\n\nThe [[Porsche 996|996]] was replaced with the [[Porsche 997|997]] in 2005. It retains the 996's basic profile, with an even lower 0.28 drag coefficient, but draws on the 993 for detailing. In addition, the new headlights revert to the original bug-eye design from the teardrop scheme of the 996. Its interior is also similarly revised, with strong links to the earlier 911 interiors while at the same time looking fresh and modern. The 997 shares less than a third of its parts with the outgoing 996, but is still technically similar to it.\n\nInitially, two versions of the 997 were introduced&mdash; the rear-wheel-drive Carrera and Carrera S. While the base 997 Carrera had a power output of 325&nbsp;PS (239&nbsp;kW) from its 3.6&nbsp;L Flat 6, a more powerful 3.8&nbsp;L 355&nbsp;PS (261&nbsp;kW) Flat 6 powers the Carrera S. Besides a more powerful engine, the Carrera S also comes standard with 19&nbsp;inch (48&nbsp;cm) \"Lobster Fork\" style wheels, more powerful and larger brakes (with red calipers), lowered suspension with PASM (Porsche Active Suspension Management: dynamically adjustable dampers), Xenon headlamps, and a sports steering wheel.\n\nIn late 2005, Porsche introduced the all-wheel-drive versions to the 997 lineup. Carrera 4 models (both Carrera 4 and Carrera 4S) were announced as 2006 models. Both Carrera 4 models are wider than their rear-wheel-drive counterparts by 1.76&nbsp;inches (32&nbsp;mm) <!-- more precisely, 32.004 mm... was that measure in mm to begin with? --> to cover wider rear tyres. The 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (62&nbsp;mph) acceleration time for the Carrera 4S with the {{convert|355|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} engine equipped with a manual transmission was reported at 4.8&nbsp;seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.carsguide.com.au/car-reviews/porsche-perfection-8935|title=Porsche 911 Carrera 4 2005 Review|date=11 November 2005|accessdate=25 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425183625/https://www.carsguide.com.au/car-reviews/porsche-perfection-8935|archive-date=25 April 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (62&nbsp;mph) acceleration for the Carrera S with the {{convert|355|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} was noted to be as fast as 4.2&nbsp;seconds in a ''[[Motor Trend]]'' comparison, and ''[[Road & Track]]'' has timed it at 3.8&nbsp;seconds. The 997 lineup includes both 2- and 4-wheel-drive variants, named Carrera and Carrera 4 respectively.

It has VTG ([[variable geometry turbocharger|variable turbine geometry]]), that combines the low-rev boost and quick responses of a small turbocharger with the high-rev power of a larger turbocharger. It also offers higher fuel efficiency compared to the 996 Turbo.\nThe 997 Turbo features a new [[all-wheel-drive]] system, similar to the one found on the [[Porsche Cayenne|Cayenne]]. The new PTM (Porsche Traction Management) system incorporates a clutch-based system which varies the amount of torque to the wheels to avoid tire slippage. According to Porsche, redirecting torque to control oversteer or understeer results in neutral handling as well as greatly improved performance in all weather conditions.\n\nFor the face lifted 2010 model year 911 Turbo, known internally as the 997.2 (as opposed to the 997.1 2007-2009 model years), launched in August 2009,<ref name=\"autocar1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/News/NewsArticle/AllCars/242347/ |title=Frankfurt motor show: Porsche 911 Turbo |publisher=Autocar.co.uk |date=15 September 2009 |accessdate=2011-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809124956/http://www.autocar.co.uk/News/NewsArticle/AllCars/242347/ |archive-date=9 August 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> the PTM system was tweaked to give a more rearward power bias.

The variable-vane twin turbochargers have also been reworked to increase responsiveness, and the intercooler and fuel system were uprated. The engine has a power output of  {{convert|493|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} which is 20&nbsp;hp more than the outgoing model.<ref name=\"autocar1\"/> The steering wheel also houses a display showing when Sport, Sport Plus and launch control have been selected through the optional Sport Chrono package.<ref name=\"autocar1\"/> Porsche claimed that the new 911 turbo will accelerate from {{convert|0|to|100|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} in 3.4 seconds, or 0&ndash;60&nbsp;mph in 3.2 seconds and could attain a top-speed of {{convert|312|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nAs with the 996 Turbo, the car featured distinctive styling cues over the Carrera models including front LED driving/parking/indicator lights mounted on a horizontal bar across the air intakes. The traditional rear wing is a variation of the 996 bi-plane unit.\n\nA new 911 Turbo S was set for production in 2010. It is a fully optioned Porsche 911 Turbo with a PDK gearbox and sports exhaust as standard. It also comes with re engineered turbo chargers to give an extra 30 horsepower increase to a total of {{convert|523|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n====997 GT3====\n[[File:BRRacing Porsche 997 GT3 front.jpg|thumb|right|997 GT3]]\n\nThe [[Porsche 997 GT3|911 GT3]] was added to the 997 lineage on 23 February 2006.

Unlike the GT3, the RS is built on the body and chassis of the 911 Carrera 4 and Turbo, and accordingly has a wider rear track for better cornering characteristics on the track.\n\nVisually, the RS is distinguished by its distinctive colour scheme \u2013 bright orange or green with black accents, which traces its roots to the iconic Carrera RS of 1973.  The plastic rear deck lid is topped by a wide carbon-fibre rear wing.  The front airdam has been fitted with an aero splitter to improve front downforce and provide more cooling air through the radiator.\n\nThe European version of the RS is fitted with lightweight plexiglass rear windows and a factory-installed roll cage.\n\nProduction of the first generation 997 GT3 RS ended in 2009. An estimated 413 units were delivered to the US and the worldwide production run is estimated to be under 2,000 vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gt3rsregistry.com/docs/HowMany.htm|title=GT3 RS Registry|publisher=GT3 RS Registry|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404121248/http://www.gt3rsregistry.com/docs/HowMany.htm|archivedate=4 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2009, Porsche announced the second generation of the 997 GT3 RS with an enlarged 3.8-litre engine having a power output of {{convert|450|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, a modified suspension, dynamic engine mounts, new titanium sport exhaust, and modified lightweight bodywork.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automoblog.net/2009/08/19/new-porsche-911-gt3-rs/|title=New Porsche 911 GT3 RS|publisher=Automoblog.net|access-date=19 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606040140/http://www.automoblog.net/2009/08/19/new-porsche-911-gt3-rs/|archive-date=6 June 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2011, Porsche announced the third generation of the 997 GT3 RS with an enlarged 4.0-litre engine having a power output of {{convert|500|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, Porsche designed the GT3 RS 4.0 using lightweight components such as bucket seats, carbon-fibre bonnet and front wings, and poly carbonate plastic rear windows for weight reduction, while using suspension components from the racing version.

Designed as a drivers car, the GTS was more powerful than the S, better handling via a bespoke suspension design, and positioned as a more street friendly alternative to the GT3, Porsche's track-focused 911 variant. The GTS featured race-inspired Center Lock Wheels, unique styling including a Sport Design front bumper, special rear bumper, blackout trim, side skirts borrowed from the GT2 model, brushed stainless steel \"Carrera GTS\" door sills and Alcantara trim. Many GTS' were ordered with the Alcantara delete, instead being built with leather.  The GTS was very rare in that is was a rear wheel drive Wide-Body design (44&nbsp;mm wider than a standard 911), 20&nbsp;mm lower and offered 408 HP (versus 385 HP for the S)  like the similar, limited volume Sport Classic and the Speedster.  Porsche built approximately 2,265 total GTS models for the world market, as well as a handful  designated as 2012 models.  The enthusiastic reception the GTS model received from both the motoring press and consumers, convinced Porsche to make the GTS a staple of the 911 line beginning in 2015, with the \"type 991\" 911 successor.\n\n====Speedster====\n[[File:Porsche 911 Speedster (5828928863).jpg|thumb|right|997 Speedster]]\nIn 2011, Porsche added a new 911 Speedster in a limited series of only 356 units to the 997 lineage, the number of cars produced recalling [[Porsche 356|the iconic car of the 1950s]]. It was the third 911 Speedster produced, the other two being from the [[Porsche 930|930]] and [[Porsche 964|964]] generations. The Speedster was powered by the same engine of the Carrera GTS which is rated at {{convert|414|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. It accelerated from 0 to {{convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} in 4.2 seconds and attained a top speed of around {{convert|190|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Only two colours were offered, Pure Blue (which was developed specifically for the Speedster) and Carrara White. (Paint To Sample versions were produced in very limited numbers and upon special request from \"loyal customers\".)\n\nThe Speedster featured a windscreen 70mm shorter than the standard 997 cabriolet while maintaining the same rake angle.\n\n===991 Series (2012 \u2013 2019)===\n{{Main|Porsche 991}}\n\n[[File:2013 Porsche 911 Carrera 4S (991) (9626546987).jpg|thumb|991 Carrera S]]\nThe [[Porsche 991|991]] introduced in 2012 is an entirely new platform, only the third since [[Porsche 911 classic|the original 911]].

The Carrera S features a 3.8-litre engine rated at {{cvt|406|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. A Power Kit (option X51) is available for the Carrera S, increasing power output to {{cvt|436|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. The new 991's overall length grows by {{cvt|2.2|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} and wheelbase grows by {{cvt|3.9|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} (now 96.5 in.) Overhangs are trimmed and the rear axle moves rearward at roughly {{cvt|3|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} towards the engine (made possible by new 3-shaft transmissions whose output flanges are moved closer to the engine). There is a wider front track ({{cvt|2|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} wider for the Carrera S). The design team for the 991 was headed by Michael Mauer.\n\nAt the front, the new 991 has wide-set headlights that are more three-dimensional. The front fender peaks are a bit more prominent, and wedgy directionals now appear to float above the intakes for the twin coolant radiators. The stretched rear 3/4 view has changed the most, with a slightly more voluminous form and thin taillights capped with the protruding lip of the bodywork. The biggest and main change in the interior is the center console, inspired by the [[Porsche Carrera GT|Carrera GT]] and adopted by the [[Porsche Panamera|Panamera]].\n\nThe 991 is the first 911 to use a predominantly [[aluminium]] construction. This means that even though the car is larger than the outgoing model, it is still up to {{convert|50|kg|lb}} lighter. The reduced weight and increased power means that both the Carrera and Carrera S are appreciably faster than the outgoing models. The 0\u201397&nbsp;km/h (60&nbsp;mph) acceleration time for the manual transmission cars are 4.6 seconds for the Carrera and 4.3 seconds for the Carrera S. When equipped with the PDK transmission, the two 991 models can accelerate from 0\u201397&nbsp;km/h in 4.4 seconds and 4.1 seconds. With the optional sports chrono package, available for the cars with the PDK transmission, the 991 Carrera can accelerate from 0\u201397&nbsp;km/h in as little as 4.2 seconds<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.porsche.com/usa/models/911/911-carrera/featuresandspecs/ |title=Technical Specs - 911 Carrera - All 911 Models |publisher=Porsche.com |accessdate=2012-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213191654/http://www.porsche.com/usa/models/911/911-carrera/featuresandspecs/ |archive-date=13 February 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and the Carrera S can do the same in 3.9 seconds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.porsche.com/usa/models/911/911-carrera-s/featuresandspecs/ |title=Technical Specs - 911 Carrera S - All 911 Models |publisher=Porsche.com |accessdate=2012-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213192340/http://www.porsche.com/usa/models/911/911-carrera-s/featuresandspecs/ |archive-date=13 February 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nApart from the reworked PDK transmission, the new 991 is also equipped with an industry-first 7-speed manual transmission. On vehicles produced in late 2012 (2013 model year) Rev Matching is available on the 7 speed manual transmission when equipped with the Sport Chrono package. Rev-Matching is a new feature with the manual transmission that blips the throttle during downshifts (if in Sport Plus mode). Also, the 7th gear cannot be engaged unless the car is already in 5th or 6th gear.\n\nOne of Porsche's primary objectives with the new model was to improve fuel economy as well as increase performance. In order to meet these objectives, Porsche introduced a number of new technologies in the 911. One of the most controversial of these is the introduction of electromechanical power steering instead of the previous hydraulic steering. This steering helps reduce fuel consumption, but some enthusiasts feel that the precise steering feedback for which the 911 is famous is reduced with the new system.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The cars also feature an engine stop/start system which turns the engine off at red lights, as well as a coasting system which allows the engine to idle while maintaining speed on downhill gradients on highways. This allows for up to 16% reduction in fuel consumption and emissions over the outgoing models.\n\nThe new cars also have a number of technologies aimed at improving handling. The cars include a torque vectoring system (standard on the Carrera S and optional on the Carrera) which brakes the inner wheel of the car when going into turns. This helps the car to turn in quicker and with more precision. The cars also feature hydraulic engine mounts (which help reduce the inertia of the engine when going into turns) as part of the optional sports chrono package. Active suspension management is standard on the Carrera S and optional on the Carrera. This helps improve ride quality on straights, while stiffening the suspension during aggressive driving. The new 991 is also equipped with a new feature called Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC). Porsche claims that this new feature alone has shaved 4 seconds off the standard car's lap time around the N\u00fcrburgring. PDCC helps the car corner flat and is said to improve high-speed directional stability and outright lateral body control, but according to several reviews, the car is more prone to understeer when equipped with this new technology.\n\nIn January 2013, Porsche introduced the all-wheel-drive variants of the Carrera models. The '4' and '4S' models are distinguishable by wider tyres, marginally wider rear body-work and a red-reflector strip that sits in between the tail-lights. In terms of technology, the 4 and 4S models are equipped with an all-new variable all-wheel-drive system that sends power to the front wheels only when needed, giving the driver a sense of being in a rear-wheel-drive 911.\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:FoS20162016 0624 132727AA (27886350045).jpg|991 Turbo S\n</gallery>\n\nIn May 2013, Porsche announced changes to the model year 2014 911 Turbo and Turbo S models, increasing their power to {{cvt|520|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} on the 'Turbo', and {{cvt|560|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} on the 'Turbo S', giving them a 0&ndash;97&nbsp;km/h acceleration time of 3.2 and 2.9 seconds, respectively. A [[Four-wheel steering|rear-wheel steering]] system has also been incorporated on the Turbo models that steers the rear wheels in the opposite direction at low speeds or the same direction at high speeds to improve handling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.automoblog.net/2013/05/06/turbo-terror-the-new-porsche-911-turbo-announced/ |title=Turbo Terror: New Porsche 911 Turbo Announced |publisher=Automoblog.net |date=6 May 2013 |accessdate=2013-05-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508120143/http://www.automoblog.net/2013/05/06/turbo-terror-the-new-porsche-911-turbo-announced/ |archive-date=8 May 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> During low-speed maneuvers, this has the virtual effect of shortening the wheelbase, while at high speeds, it is virtually extending the wheelbase for higher driving stability and agility.\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Festival automobile international 2015 - Porsche 911 Targa - 003.jpg|The 991 Targa features an all-new electronically operated roof mechanism which allows it to have the original Targa design\n</gallery>\n\nIn January 2014, Porsche introduced the new model year 2015 Targa 4 and Targa 4S models.

Extensive changes were made to the engine allowing a 9,000 rpm redline from the 4.0 litre flat-six engine. Porsche's focus was on reducing internal friction to improve throttle response. Compared to the 991.1, the rear spoiler is higher and located further back to be more effective. There is a new front spoiler and changes to the rear suspension. The 991.2 GT3 brought back the choice between a manual transmission or PDK dual clutch transmission. A touring version was also introduced which comes standard with the comfort package and the manual transmission along with the deletion of the fixed rear wing and employing an electronically operated rear wing instead.\n\n====911 GT3 RS====\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Geneva International Motor Show 2018, Le Grand-Saconnex (1X7A0083).jpg|991 GT3 RS\n</gallery>\nPorsche launched the ''Renn Sport'' version of the 911 GT3 at the [[Geneva Motor Show#2015|Geneva Motor Show]] in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topspeed.com/cars/porsche/2016-porsche-911-gt3-rs-ar115711.html#main|title=2016 Porsche 911 GT3 RS}}</ref> Compared to the 911 GT3, the front fenders are now equipped with louvers above the wheels and the rear fenders now include Turbo-like intakes, rather than an intake below the rear wing. The roof is made from magnesium. The interior includes full bucket seats (based on the carbon seats of the 918 Spyder), carbon-fibre inserts, lightweight door handles and the Club Sport Package as standard (a bolted-on roll cage behind the front seats, preparation for a battery master switch, and a six-point safety harness for the driver and fire extinguisher with mounting bracket). The 3.8-litre unit found in the previous 997 GT3 is replaced with a 4.0-litre unit that has a power output of {{cvt|500|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and 460&nbsp;Nm (339&nbsp;lbft) of torque. The transmission is PDK only. The car accelerates from 0&ndash;100&nbsp;km/h (62&nbsp;mph) in 3.4 seconds (0.6 seconds quicker than the 997 GT3 RS 4.0) and 0&ndash;200&nbsp;km/h (124&nbsp;mph) in 10.9 seconds. The 991 GT3 RS also comes with functions such as declutching by \"paddle neutral\" \u2014 comparable to pressing the clutch with a conventional manual gearbox \u2013 and a Pit Speed limiter button. As with the 911 GT3, a rear-axle steering and Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus with fully variable rear axle differential lock are available as standard.\n\nIn February 2018, Porsche introduced a facelifted GT3 RS model to continue their updates for the 991 generation of the 911. Changes include a new engine similar to the GT3 and RSR models with a 9,000 rpm redline and a {{convert|20|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|10|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} increase over the outgoing model, NACA ducts for brake cooling, modified front fascia (similar to the 991.2 GT3), side skits and rear wing (similar to the [[Porsche 911 GT2#Road cars|GT2 RS]]) for increased downforce, ball joints on all suspension links, front helper springs, lightweight glass for the rear and rear-side windows and a newly developed tyre compound.

In order to qualify for GT racing, 25 road-going models were built to achieve type homologation. The engine in the GT1 is rated at {{convert|608|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} ({{cvt|544|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} for the road version) and accelerated from 0\u201397&nbsp;km/h in 3.3 seconds.

Both the road and race cars carried the same [[twin-turbocharged]] engine as used in the [[Porsche 962|962]], and the race car was a match for the then dominant [[McLaren F1 GTR]]s. A redeveloped version of the 911 GT1 race car was later built, winning outright at the [[1998 24 Hours of Le Mans]]. The car is not considered to be a real 911{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}, as it is derived from the 962 with the 993 and later the 996 911's front section.

A four or five-speed \"Type 901\" [[manual transmission]] was available. The styling was largely penned by Ferdinand \"Butzi\" Porsche, son of [[Ferdinand Anton Ernst Porsche|Ferdinand \"Ferry\" Porsche]]. Butzi Porsche initially came up with a notchback design with proper space for seating two rear passengers but Ferry Porsche insisted that the 356's successor was to use its fastback styling. 7 prototypes were built based on Butzi Porsche's original design and were internally called the Porsche 754 T7.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-ca/autos/autosclassics/the-porsche-754-t7-prototype-is-the-911s-missing-link/ar-BBUXxos|title=The Porsche 754 T7 Prototype Is The 911's Missing Link|date=2019-03-18|first=Tyler|last=Heatley|publisher=MSN|accessdate=2019-05-24}}</ref> [[Erwin Komenda]], the leader of the Porsche car body construction department who initially objected, was also involved later in the design.\n\n[[File:Bonhams - The Paris Sale 2012 - Porsche 912 'SWB' Coup\u00e9 - 1967 - 014.jpg|thumb|The 911-based 912, powered by a [[flat-4]] engine (1967)]]\n\nProduction of the 356 ended in 1965, but there was still a market for a [[Flat-4|4-cylinder]] car, particularly in the US. The [[Porsche 912|912]], introduced in the same year, served as a direct replacement, offering the de-tuned version of 356 SC's 4-cylinder, {{cvt|1582|cc|L|1|abbr=on}}, {{convert|90|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} boxer four Type 616/36 engine inside the 911 bodywork with Type 901 four-speed manual transmission (a 5-speed manual transmission was optional).\n\nIn 1966, Porsche introduced the more powerful 911S with Type 901/02 engine having a power output of {{convert|160|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. Forged aluminum [[alloy wheel]]s from [[Fuchs Petrolub|Fuchs]], with a 5-spoke design, were offered for the first time.

The [[Targa top|Targa]] (meaning \"plate\" in Italian<ref>Paternie, Red Book, p. 9</ref>) version was introduced. The Targa had a [[stainless steel]]-clad roll bar, as automakers believed that proposed rollover safety requirements by the US [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) would make it difficult for fully open [[convertible (car)|convertible]]s to meet regulations for sale in the US, an important market for the 911. The name \"Targa\" came from the [[Targa Florio]] sports car road race in [[Sicily]], Italy in which Porsche had several victories until 1973. The last win in the subsequently discontinued event was scored with a 911 Carrera RS against prototypes entered by [[Ferrari]] and [[Alfa Romeo]]. The road going Targa was equipped with a removable roof panel and a removable plastic rear window (although a fixed glass version was offered from 1968).\n\n[[File:Porsche 911 2.0 Coupe IMG 0819.jpg|thumb|[[Porsche 911 classic|Porsche 911 2.0 Coupe]] (1964) at the [[Porsche Museum, Stuttgart|Porsche Museum]] in [[Stuttgart]]]]\n\n[[File:1967 Porsche 911R - Flickr - exfordy.jpg|thumb|The 911 R (1967)]]\n\nThe {{convert|110|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} 911T was also launched in 1967 with Type 901/03 engine. The {{convert|130|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} model was renamed the 911L with Type 901/06 engine and ventilated front disc brakes. The brakes had been introduced on the previous 911S. The 911R with 901/22 engine had a limited production (20 in all), as this was a lightweight racing version with thin fiberglass reinforced plastic doors, a [[magnesium]] crankcase, twin overhead camshafts, and a power output of {{convert|210|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}.\n\nA [[Semi-automatic transmission|semi-automatic]] ''Sportomatic''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportomatic.org|title=Website for Sportomatic Porsche models|publisher=Sportomatic.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728044851/http://www.sportomatic.org/|archivedate=28 July 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=2011-10-23}}</ref> model, composed of a [[torque converter]], an [[automatic transmission|automatic clutch]], and the four-speed transmission was added in Autumn 1967.

The wheelbase for all 911 and 912 models was increased from {{convert|2211-2268|mm|in|abbr=on}}, to help as a remedy to the car's nervous handling at the limit. The overall length of the car did not change, but the rear wheels were relocated further back. Fuel injection arrived for the 911S (901/10 engine) and for a new middle model, 911E (901/09 engine).\n\nThe D series was produced from Aug. 1970 to July 1971.\nThe 2.2-litre 911E (C and D series) had lower power output of the 911/01 engine ({{convert|155|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} at 6,200&nbsp;rpm) compared to the 911S's Type 911/02 ({{convert|180|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} at 6,500&nbsp;rpm), but 911E was quicker in acceleration up to {{convert|160|km/h|mph|0}}.\n\nThe E series for 1972\u20131973 model years (August 1971 to July 1972 production) consisted of the same models, but with a new, larger {{cvt|2341|cc|L|1|abbr=on}} engine. This is known as the \"2.4&nbsp;L\" engine, despite its displacement being closer to 2.3 litres.\nThe 911E (Type 911/52 engine) and 911S (Type 911/53) used Bosch mechanical [[fuel injection]] (MFI) in all markets. For 1972 the 911T (Type 911/57) was [[carburettor|carbureted]], except in the US and some Asian markets where the 911T also came with (MFI) mechanical fuel injection (Type 911/51 engine) with power increase over European models (130&nbsp;hp) to 140&nbsp;hp commonly known as a 911T/E.\n\nWith power and torque increase, the 2.4-litre cars also got a newer, stronger transmission, identified by its Porsche type number 915. Derived from the transmission in the [[Porsche 908|908]] race car, the 915 did away with the 901 transmission's \"dog-leg\" style first gear arrangement, opting for a traditional H pattern with first gear up to the left, second gear underneath first, etc. The E series had the unusual oil filler behind the right side door, with the dry sump oil tank relocated from behind the right rear wheel to the front of it in an attempt to move the center of gravity slightly forward for better handling. An extra oil filler/inspection flap was located on the rear wing, for this reason it became known as an \"Oil Klapper\", \"\u00d6lklappe\" or \"Vierte T\u00fcr (4th door)\".\n\nThe F series (August 1972 to July 1973 production) moved the oil tank back to the original behind-the-wheel location. This change was in response to complaints that gas-station attendants often filled gasoline into the oil tank. In January 1973, US 911Ts were switched to the new [[Jetronic|K-Jetronic]] CIS (Continuous Fuel Injection) system from [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] on Type 911/91 engine.\n\n911S models also gained a small [[Spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]] under the front bumper to improve high-speed stability. The cars weighed {{convert|1050|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The 911 ST was produced in small numbers for racing (the production run for the ST lasted from 1970 to 1971). The cars were available with engines of either {{cvt|3987|cc|L|1|abbr=on}} or {{cvt|3404|cc|L|1|abbr=on}} displacement, having a power output of {{convert|270|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} at 8,000&nbsp;rpm. Weight was down to {{convert|960|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The cars had success at the Daytona 6 Hours, the [[Sebring 12 Hours]], the [[1000 km N\u00fcrburgring]], and the [[Targa Florio]].\n\n===911 Carrera RS (1973 and 1974)===\n[[File:1973 Porsche 911 RS Carrera (35097626702).jpg|thumb|1973 Porsche 911 Carrera RS]]\n[[File:Paris - RM auctions - 20150204 - Porsche 911 Carrera RS 2.7 Touring - 1973 - 005.jpg|thumb|Porsche 911 Carrera RS 2.7 touring]]\n\nRS stands for ''Rennsport'' in German, meaning ''race sport''. The [[Porsche Carrera|Carrera]] name was reintroduced from the 356 Carrera which had itself been named after Porsche's class victories in the [[Carrera Panamericana]] races in Mexico in the 1950s. The RS was developed to meet [[Homologation (motorsport)|motorsport homologation]] requirements. Compared to a standard 911S, the Carrera 2.7 RS had a larger engine (2,687&nbsp;cc) developing {{convert|210|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} with Bosch ([[Kugelfischer]]) mechanical fuel injection, revised and stiffened suspension, a \"ducktail\" rear spoiler, larger brakes, wider rear wheels and rear fenders, to fit 185/70VR15 & 215/60VR15 Pirelli Cinturato CN36 tyres. In RS Touring form it weighed {{convert|1075|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, in Sport Lightweight form it was about {{convert|100|kg|lb|abbr=on}} lighter, the saving coming from thin gauge steel used for parts of the body shell and also the use of thinner glass. In total, 1,580 units were made, and qualified for the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]] class. 49 Carrera RS cars were built with {{cvt|2808|cc|L|1|abbr=on}} engines rated at {{convert|300|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[File:Porsche 911 RSR LM24.jpg|thumb|The 911 RSR]]\n\nFor the 1974 IROC Championship (which started in December 1973), 1973 Carrera RSR models were fitted with the 3.0 engine and a flat \"whale tail\" in place of the ducktail spoiler along with wide body panels and large tyres.\n\nIn 1974, Porsche developed the Carrera RS 3.0 with mechanical fuel injection rated at {{convert|230|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. Its price was almost twice that of the 2.7 RS, but it offered racing capability. The chassis was largely similar to that of the 1973 Carrera RSR and the braking system was from the [[Porsche 917|917]] racing car. The use of thinner metal plate panels and a minimalist interior enabled its weight to be reduced to around {{convert|900|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe Carrera RSR 3.0 was sold to racing teams and scored wins in several major sports car races of the mid-1970s. Also, a prototype Carrera RSR Turbo (with 2.1-litre engine due to a 1.4x equivalency formula) came second at the [[1974 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans in 1974]] and won several major races, a significant event in that its engine would form the basis of many future Porsche attempts in sports car racing. This, and the earlier 917, was Porsche's commitment to [[turbocharger]] applications in its cars.\n\n===911 and 911S 2.7 (1973\u20131977)===\n\nModel year 1974 (G Series August 1973 to July 1974 production) saw three significant changes. First, the engine size was increased to 2,687&nbsp;cc achieving higher torque. Second, new impact [[Bumper (automobile)|bumpers]] conformed with low-speed protection requirements of US regulations. Thirdly, the use of K-Jetronic CIS Bosch fuel injection in two of the three models in the line up&mdash; the 911 and 911S models, retaining the narrow rear arches of the old 2.4, now had a 2.7-litre engine rated at {{convert|150|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|175|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}, respectively. The standard 911 version, received an increase to {{convert|165|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} for Model Year 1976, which meant that starting from MY 1976, there was only a difference in power of 10&nbsp;hp between the 911 and the 911S. The engine remained a K-Jetronic 2.7-litre. The 911S 2.7 engine was rated during the entire lifespan at {{convert|175|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Carrera 2.7 MFI and CIS (1974\u20131976)===\nThe Carrera 2.7 model built for all markets, except for the United States, used the {{convert|210|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} RS 911/83 engine with Bosch mechanical fuel injection pump from the 1973 Carrera RS. These Carrera 2.7 MFI models were built from 1974 until 1976 and were mechanically identical to the 1973 Carrera RS. The Carrera 2.7 model produced for the North American markets, often referred to as the Carrera 2.7 CIS, was powered by the same 2.7-litre engine as the 911S which produced {{convert|175|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. The initial Carrera 2.7 models had the same welded-on rear RS flares, before switching to the SC stamped style rear flares during the middle of the 1974 production year. The Carrera 2.7 coup\u00e9s weighed in at {{convert|1075|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, the same weight as the 1973 Carrera RS Touring.\n\nFor the 1974 model year, the Carrera 2.7 was available with the \"ducktail\" rear spoiler first introduced with the 1973 Carrera RS. In the North American markets the ducktail was standard equipment for the Carrera. All other markets the ducktail was optional, except for the home German market where the ducktail had been outlawed by the T\u00dcV road homologation department. This led to the introduction of the whale tail rear spoiler, available as an option on the 1974-75 Carrera 2.7 models, as well as the newly introduced 930 Turbo.\n\nThe Carrera 2.7 was replaced by the Carrera 3.0 for the 1976 model year, except for a special run of 113 1976 Carrera 2.7 MFI coup\u00e9s were built for the German market featuring the 911/83 RS engine, with an additional 20 narrow-bodied 1976 Carrera MFI 2.7 Targas being supplied to the Belgian Gendarmerie. The 1976 Carrera 2.7 MFI Sondermodells were the last mechanically fuel injected 911 produced by Porsche, and still featured the 1973 RS engine.\n\n===912E (1976)===\n\nFor the 1976 model year, the 912E was produced for the U.S. market. This was 4-cylinder version of the 911 in the same manner as the 912 that had last been produced in 1969. It used the I-series chassis powered by the [[Volkswagen]] 2.0 engine also used in the [[Porsche 914]] for 1973 through 1975 model years. 2,099 units were produced. The 912E was replaced by the front-engine [[Porsche 924]] for the 1977 model year.\n\n===Carrera 3.0 (1976\u20131977)===\n\n[[File:Porsche 911 Carrera 3.0.JPG|thumbnail|left|Porsche 911 Carrera 3.0]]\n[[File:Porsche 911 Carrera 3.0 1976.JPG|thumbnail|right|Porsche 911 Carrera 3.0]]\n\nFor the 1976 model year, Porsche introduced the Carrera 3.0 with wide rear flares, optional whaletail, and a variety of other luxury options. It was available in all markets except North America. The Carrera 3.0 was fitted with a variation of the 930 Turbo's 2994&nbsp;cc engine (minus the [[turbocharger]]). The engine (dubbed the 930/02) featured K-Jetronic CIS. It developed {{convert|200|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} in contrast to the older Carrera 2.7 MFI model's {{convert|210|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. The crankcase and gearbox housing were made of aluminium rather than magnesium for improved reliability. Magnesium cases were renown for thermal expansion/contraction issues as engines grew in displacement and heat generation also increased.\n\nThe new engine, which featured bigger intake and exhaust valves, produced greater torque allowing the Carrera 3.0 to achieve the same performance as the previous Carrera 2.7, {{convert|0|\u2013|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in 6.1 seconds and {{convert|0|\u2013|200|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in 27 seconds. Both versions boasted a top speed of approximately {{convert|236|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.\n\nWeight increased marginally by {{convert|45|kg|lb|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1120|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe 911 Carrera 3.0 was produced in both targa (1,125 examples produced) and coup\u00e9 (2,566) versions. The Carrera 3.0 was available with manual gearbox (type 915) with 4 or 5 speeds as well as 3-speed automatic transmission (called the Sportomatic). Production totals were 3,691 manual cars and 58 Sportomatic cars.\n\n===930 Turbo and Turbo Carrera 3.0-litre (1975\u20131977)===\n{{Main|Porsche 930}}\n[[File:Nationale oldtimerdag Zandvoort 2010, Red Porsche.JPG|thumb|Porsche 911 Turbo (930)]]\nFor the 1975 model year, Porsche introduced the first production [[turbocharged]] 911. Although called the 930 Turbo (930 being its internal type number) in Europe, it was marketed as the 930 Turbo Carrera in North America. The body shape incorporated wide wheel-arches to accommodate the wide 205/50R15 & 225/50R15 Pirelli P7 tyres, and a large rear spoiler often known as a \"[[Whale tail (automotive spoiler)|whale tail]]\" on the early cars (modified from the original 1974 IROC design). They were initially fitted with a 3.0-litre engine {{convert|260|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} and four-speed manual transmission.\n\n[[File:Porsche 934 Turbo (9224976479).jpg|thumb|The Porsche 934, one of the first racing versions of the 930 Turbo]]\n[[File:1979 Porsche 935 (20202549045).jpg|thumb|The Porsche 935 known for its signature \"slant nose\" front]]\n\nProduction of the first 400 units qualified the 930 for FIA Group 4 competition. With the racing version called the [[Porsche 934]] of 1976 participating at the [[Le Mans 24 Hours|24 Hours of Le Mans]] and other races including battles with the [[BMW E9|BMW 3.0 CSL \"Batmobile\"]]. The [[Group 5 (racing)|FIA Group 5]] version called [[Porsche 935]] evolved from the 934. Fitted with a slope nose or \"slant nose\", the 500+ PS car was campaigned in 1976 by the factory, winning the world championship title. Private teams went on to win many races, like Le Mans in 1979, and continued to compete successfully with the car well into the 1980s until the FIA and IMSA rules were changed.\n\n===930 Turbo 3.3-litre (1978\u20131989)===\n{{Main|Porsche 930}}\n[[File:12-01-03-autostadtl-by-RalfR-81.jpg|thumb|Porsche 930 3.3-litre, distinguished by its raised \"whale-tail\" rear wing]]\n\nFor the 1978 model year, Porsche revised the 930 with a larger 3.3-litre [[turbocharged]] engine with intercooler rated at {{convert|300|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. To fit the intercooler a newly designed \"tea-tray\" tail spoiler replaced the earlier whale tail spoiler. Porsche dropped the \"Carrera\" nomenclature for the North American markets and the car was simply called the Porsche 911 Turbo worldwide. The larger engine helped reduce some of the turbo lag inherent in the earlier models.\n\nIn 1989, a 5-speed manual transmission became available for the 930. The 930 was replaced in 1990 with the [[Porsche 964|964]] turbo featuring the same 3.3-litre engine. There have been turbocharged variants of each subsequent generation of 911 since then.\n\n===911SC (1978\u20131983)===\n\n[[File:1983Porsche911SC.JPG|thumb|1983 Porsche 911 Super Carrera, the last production year of the Super Carrera]]\n[[File:1000pistestoivonen84.jpg|thumb|[[Henri Toivonen]] at ''rallye des 1000 pistes'' in 1984 on a Porsche 911 SC RS]]\n\nIn 1978, Porsche introduced the new version of the 911, called the '911SC'. Porsche reintroduced the SC designation for the first time since the 356SC (as distinguished from the race engined 356 Carrera). There was no Carrera version of the 911SC. The \"SC\" stands for \"Super Carrera\". It featured a 3.0-litre aluminum engine with Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection and a 5-speed 915 transmission. Originally power output was {{convert|180|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}, later {{convert|191|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} and then in 1981 it was increased to {{convert|204|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. The move to an aluminum engine was to regain case reliability, something missing for many years with magnesium. In 1981 a Cabriolet concept car was introduced at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]]. The [[convertible]] body design also featured [[four-wheel drive]], although this was dropped in the production version. The first 911 Cabriolet debuted in late 1982, as a 1983 model. This was Porsche's first cabriolet since the [[Porsche 356|356]] of the mid-1960s. A total of 4,214 were sold in its introductory year, despite its premium price relative to the open-top targa.<ref name=Seventy>P. 77 Paternie, P (2000).

Sales of the 911 remained so strong however, that Porsche revised its strategy and decided to inject new life into the 911 editions. 911 SC sales totaled 58,914 cars.<ref name=Seventy/>\n\n[[Peter W. Schutz]] (CEO Porsche AG 1981\u20131987) wrote: {{quotation|\nThe decision to keep the 911 in the product line occurred one afternoon in the office of Dr. Helmuth Bott [[:de:Helmuth Bott]], the Porsche operating board member responsible for all engineering and development. I noticed a chart on the wall of Professor Bott's office. It depicted the ongoing development schedules for the three primary Porsche product lines: [[Porsche 944|944]], 928 and 911. Two of them stretched far into the future, but the 911 program stopped at the end of 1981. I remember rising from my chair, walking over to the chart, taking a black marker pen, and extending the 911 program bar clean off the chart. I am sure I heard a silent cheer from Professor Bott, and I knew I had done the right thing. The Porsche 911, the company icon, had been saved, and I believe the company was saved with it.<ref>Corlett, p. 6</ref>}}\n\n===Carrera 3.2 (1984\u20131989)===\n\n[[File:1987 911carrera Jubi Targa und TLcabrio.jpg|thumb|right|1987 Porsche 911 ''Carrera Cabriolet'' and \"Carrera Targa\"]]\n\nThe replacement for the SC series came in 1984 as the 911 3.2 Carrera, reviving the Carrera name for the first time since 1977. This was the last iteration in the original 911 series, with all subsequent models featuring new body styling and new brake, electronic, and suspension technologies.\n\nA new higher-displacement engine, a 3.2-litre horizontally opposed flat 6-cylinder unit, was utilized. At the time Porsche claimed it was 80% new.<ref>Corlett, p. 13</ref> The new swept volume of 3,164 cc was achieved using the {{convert|95|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} bore (from the previous SC model) combined with the 1978 Turbo 3.3 crankshaft's {{convert|74.4|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} stroke. In addition, higher domed pistons increased the compression ratio from 9.8 to 10.3:1 (9.5:1 for the US market). New inlet manifold and exhaust systems were fitted. The 915 transmission was carried over from the SC series for the first three model years. In 1987, the Carrera got a new five-speed gearbox sourced from [[Getrag]], model number G50 with proven [[BorgWarner]] synchronizers. This slightly heavier version also featured a hydraulically operated clutch.\n\nWith the new engine, power was increased to {{convert|207|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} (at 5,900&nbsp;rpm) for North American-delivered cars and to {{convert|237|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} (at 5,900&nbsp;rpm) for most other markets. This version of the 911 accelerated {{convert|0|\u2013|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} in 5.4 seconds and had a top speed of {{convert|150|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} as measured by ''[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]]''. Factory figures were more modest: 0\u201360&nbsp;mph time of 6.3 seconds for the US version and 6.1 seconds for cars outside the American market.\n\nThe brake discs were increased in size to aid in more effective heat dissipation and improved oil-fed chain tensioners were fitted to the engine. To improve oil cooling, a finned cooler replaced the serpentine lines in the front passenger fender well. This was further improved in 1987, with the addition of a thermostatically controlled fan.\n\nDriving refinement and motor reliability were improved with an upgrade of the fuel and [[Ignition system|ignition]] control components to an [[Jetronic|L-Jetronic]] with Bosch Motronics 2 DME (Digital Motor Electronics system). An improvement in fuel-efficiency was due to the DME providing a petrol cut-off on the overrun. Changes in the fuel map and chip programming from October 1986 further improved the power to {{convert|217|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} (at 5,900&nbsp;rpm) for North American delivered cars as well as for other markets mandating low emissions, like Germany.\n\nThree basic models were available \u2013 coup\u00e9, targa and cabriolet. The Carrera is almost indistinguishable from the SC with the external clue being the front fog lights that were integrated into the front valance. Only cosmetic changes were made during the production of the Carrera, with a redesigned dashboard featuring larger air conditioning vents appearing in 1986.\n\nIn 1984, Porsche also introduced the M491 option. Officially called the Supersport in the UK, it was commonly known as the \"Turbo-look\".{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} It was a style that resembled the 930 Turbo with wide wheel arches and the distinctive \"tea tray\" tail. It featured the stiffer suspension shared with the turbo and the superior turbo braking system as well as the wider turbo wheels. Sales of the Supersport were high for its first two years in the United States because the desirable 930 was not available.\n\n[[File:Porsche Carrera CS registered August 1988 3164cc.jpg|thumb|right|1988 Porsche Carrera CS]]\n\nIn 1985, Porsche introduced the first Carrera Club Sport prototype with the identification number WP0ZZZ91ZF100848. Later on in that year, a 911 Club Sport Row (Rest Of World) with the identification number WP0ZZZ91ZFS101166 was special ordered for a Porsche driver that was particularly inspired by the CS prototype on the track. From 1987 to September 1989, Porsche decided to produced 340 units for their customers that wanted a track inspired road car, The 911 Carrera Club Sport (CS) (option M637), is a reduced weight version of the standard Carrera purposely built for club racing, it gained engine and suspension modifications. The CS had a blueprinted engine with hollow intake valves and a higher rev limit, deletion of: all power options, sunroof (except one unit), air conditioning (except two units), radio, rear seat, undercoating, sound insulation, rear wiper, door pocket lids, fog lamps, front hood locking mechanism, engine and luggage compartment lights, lockable wheel nuts and even the rear lid \"Carrera\" logo, all in order to save an estimated {{convert|70|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in weight. With the exception of CS cars delivered to the UK, all are identifiable by the \"CS Club Sport\" decal on the left front fender and came in a variety of colors, some special ordered. Some U.S. CS cars did not have the decal installed by the dealer; however, all have a \"SP\" stamp on the crankcase and cylinder head. The UK cars were all finished \"Grand Prix White\" with a red \"Carrera CS\" decal on each side of the car and red wheels. Although the CS was well received by the club racers, because it cost more than the standard 911, but had fewer comfort features. According to Porsche Club of America and Porsche Club Great Britain CS Registers, 21 are documented as delivered to the U.S. in 1988 with 7 in 1989, one to Canada in 1988 and 53 to the United Kingdom from 1987 to 1989.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn 1988, Porsche produced 875 examples of the CE or Commemorative Edition 911 Carrera in coupe, targa and cabriolet variants to mark the production of the 250,000th 911. Distinguishing features include special diamond blue metallic paint with color-matched Fuchs wheels, front and rear spoilers, and interior carpets and leather. These cars also featured Dr. Ferdinand Porsche's signature embroidered on the seats in the headrest area. Of the 875 examples produced, only 300 were imported to the US (120 coupes, 100 cabrios and 80 Targas),  250 were sold in Germany, 50 went to the UK, and the remainder to other countries.\n\nFor 1989, Porsche produced the 25th Anniversary Special Edition model to mark the 25th year of 911 production. The 1989 Porsche brochure lists production of 500 U.S. market cars, of which 300 were coup\u00e9s (240 in silver metallic paint and 60 in satin black metallic, and 200 cabriolet models (160 in silver and 40 in black). All had \"silk grey\" leather with black accent piping and silk grey velour carpeting. Included were body color Fuchs wheels in 6x16 (front) and 8x16 (rear), stitched leather console with an outside temperature gauge and a CD or cassette holder, a limited slip differential, and a short shifting gear lever, as well as small bronze \"25th Anniversary Special Edition\" badges\n\n[[File:Porsche-32-speedster.jpg|thumb|Porsche 911 Carrera 3.2 Speedster]]\n\nThe 911 Speedster (option M503), a low-roof version of the Cabriolet which was evocative of the 356 Speedster of the 1950s, was produced in limited numbers (2,104 units) starting in January 1989 until July 1989 as both a narrow body car and a Turbo-look. The narrow version production was 171 units. The Speedster started as a design under Helmuth Bott<!-- [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmuth_Bott] --> in 1983 but was not manufactured until six years later. It was a two-seat convertible that featured a low swept windshield.<ref>Corlett, p. 45</ref>\n\nTotal production of the 911 3.2 Carrera series was 76,473 cars (35,670 coup\u00e9, 19,987 cabrio, 18,468 targa).<ref>Corlett, p. 74</ref>\n\nAccording to the manufacturer, around 150,000 of the 911 cars from the model years 1964 to 1989 are still on the road today.<ref>{{cite press release |url= http://newsroom.porsche.com/en/products/a-fountain-of-youth-for-classic-cars-10719.html |title= A fountain of youth |publisher= newsroom.porsche |date= 27 June 2014 |accessdate= 27 June 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150626152858/http://newsroom.porsche.com/en/products/a-fountain-of-youth-for-classic-cars-10719.html |archive-date= 26 June 2015 |url-status= live |df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n===964 Series (1989\u20131993)===\n{{Main|Porsche 964}}\n[[File:1990 Porsche 911 Carrera 2 (803367948).jpg|thumb|1990 Porsche 911 ''Carrera 2'']]\n\nIn late 1989, the 911 underwent a major evolution with the introduction of the Type 964. With technologies from the [[Porsche 959|959]] flagship model, this would be an important car for Porsche, since the world economy was undergoing [[recession]] and the company could not rely on its image alone. It was launched as the Carrera 4, the \"4\" indicating [[four-wheel-drive]], demonstrating the company's commitment to engineering. [[Drag coefficient]] was down to 0.32. A rear spoiler deployed at high speed, preserving the purity of design when the vehicle was at rest. The chassis was redesigned overall. Coil springs, [[ABS brakes]] and [[power steering]] made their debut. The engine was increased in size to 3,600&nbsp;cc and was rated at 250&nbsp;PS (184&nbsp;kW). The [[rear-wheel-drive]] version, the Carrera 2, arrived a year later.\n\nThe [[Porsche 911#964 Turbo (1990\u20131994)|964 incarnation of the 911 Turbo]] returned in 1990 after an absence from the price lists. At first it used a refined version of the 3.3&nbsp;L engine of the previous Turbo, but two years later a turbocharged engine based on the 3.6&nbsp;L engine of the other 964 models was introduced.\n\nIn 1990, Porsche introduced the ahead-of-its-time [[Tiptronic]] automatic transmission in the 964 Carrera 2, featuring adaptive electronic management and full manual control. The 964 was one of the first cars in the world offered with dual [[airbags]] standard (from 1991), the first being the [[Porsche 944 Turbo|944 Turbo]] (from 1987).\n\n[[File:Porsche Carrera RS - Flickr - Alexandre Pr\u00e9vot.jpg|thumb|Porsche 964 Carrera RS]]\n\nIn 1992, Porsche re-introduced a limited-edition RS model, inspired by the 1973 Carrera RS and emissions-legal in Europe only. In 1993, appeals from American customers resulted in Porsche developing the RS America of which 701 units were built. In 1994, the RS America returned with rear seats. A total of 84 RS America cars were made in 1994. However, while European RS was a homologation special, RS America was an option delete variant of the regular model. The RS 3.8 of 1993 had Turbo-style bodywork, a larger fixed whale tail in place of the electrictronically operated rear spoiler, and a 300&nbsp;PS (221&nbsp;kW) {{cvt|3746|cc|L|1|abbr=on}} engine.\n\nSince the RS/RS America was intended as a no-compromise, higher performance version of the 964, there were four factory options available: a [[limited-slip differential]], AM/FM [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] stereo, air conditioning, and a sunroof. The interior was more basic than a standard 911 as well; for example the interior door panels lacked the armrests and door pockets and had a simple pull strap for the opening mechanism.\n\n====964 Turbo (1990\u20131994)====\n[[File:Porsche 911-964 turbo 1990-1993 frontright 2009-10-04 U.jpg|thumb|left|Porsche 964 Turbo]]\n\nIn 1990 Porsche introduced a [[1991-1992 Porsche 964 Turbo Technical Data|Turbocharged version]] of the 964 series. This car is sometimes mistakenly called 965 (this type number actually referred to a [[Porsche 969|stillborn project]] that would have been a hi-tech turbocharged car in the vein of the 959). For the 1991 through 1993 model years, Porsche produced the 964 Turbo with the 930's proven 3.3&nbsp;L engine, improved to have a power output of 320&nbsp;PS (235&nbsp;kW). 1994 brought the Carrera 2/4's 3.6&nbsp;L engine, now in turbocharged form and sending a staggering {{convert|360|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} to the rear wheels. With the 993 on the way, this car was produced through 1994 and remains rather rare.\n\n===993 Series (1994\u2013mid 1998)===\n{{Main|Porsche 993}}\n[[File:1996 Porsche 911 993 GT2 - Flickr - The Car Spy (4).jpg|thumb|right|The mid-nineties Type 993 had sleeker bodywork. This is the high-performance GT2 variant]]\n\nThe 911 was again revised for model year 1994 under the internal name Type 993. This car was significant as it was the final incarnation of the [[air-cooled]] 911 first introduced in 1964.  Most enthusiasts and collectors consider the 993 to be the best of the air-cooled 911 series.  As Car & Driver noted, \"Porsche's version of the Goldilocks tale is the 993-generation 911, the one many Porschephiles agree that the company got just right,\" with an \"ideal blend of technology and classic 911 air-cooled heritage.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=1995\u201398 Porsche 911 Carrera Buyer's Guide [Econo-Exotics] |url=http://blog.caranddriver.com/1995-98-porsche-911-carrera-buyers-guide-econo-exotics/ |date=2 May 2013 |first=James |last=Tate |work=Car and Driver |accessdate=24 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319183643/http://blog.caranddriver.com/1995-98-porsche-911-carrera-buyers-guide-econo-exotics/ |archive-date=19 March 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  Porsche itself refers to the 993 as \"a significant advance, not just from a technical, but also a visual perspective.\"<ref>http://www.porsche.com/usa/accessoriesand services/classic/models/993/993/</ref> \"993s especially [are] widely regarded as the best the 911 ever got.\"<ref>James Edition, 28 April 2015, \"The Classic Porsche 911 Market Continues to Surprise.\"</ref>\n\nThe exterior featured all-new front and rear ends. The revised bodywork was smoother, having a noticeably more aerodynamic front end somewhat reminiscent of the [[Porsche 959|959]]. Styling was by Englishman Tony Hatter under the supervision of design chief [[Harm Lagaay]] and was completed in 1991.\n\nAlong with the revised bodywork, mechanically the 993 also featured an all-new multilink rear suspension that improved the car's ride and handling. This rear suspension was largely derived from the stillborn [[Porsche 989]]'s rear multilink design, and served to rectify the problems with earlier models' tendency to oversteer if the throttle or brakes were applied mid-corner. These modifications also reduced previous 911's lift-off oversteer problems to a much more moderate degree.\n\n[[File:Porsche 993 RS Clubsport (3).jpg|thumb|The Porsche 993 Carrera RS continued the tradition of a light weight and minimalist 911 beginning with the 1973 Carrera RS]]\n\nThe new suspension, along with chassis refinements, enabled the car to keep up dynamically with the competition. Engine capacity remained at 3.6&nbsp;L, but power rose to 272&nbsp;PS (200&nbsp;kW / 268&nbsp;hp) due to better engine management and exhaust design, and beginning with model year 1996 to 286&nbsp;PS (210&nbsp;kW / 281&nbsp;hp). The 993 was the first Porsche to debut variable-length intake runners with the \"Varioram\" system on 1996 models. This addressed the inherent compromise between high-rpm power production and low-rpm torque production, and was one of the first of its kind to be employed on production vehicles. However, the Varioram version with its OBD II had issues with carbon deposits, resulting in failed smog tests. This caused expensive repairs, and made comparisons with the 1995 car (with OBD I and just 12&nbsp;hp less) inevitable. Meanwhile, a new four-wheel-drive system was introduced as an option in the form of the Carrera 4, the [[rear-wheel drive|rear-wheel-drive]] versions simply being called Carrera or C2. A lightweight RS variant had a 3.8&nbsp;L engine rated at 300&nbsp;PS (221&nbsp;kW / 296&nbsp;hp), and was only rear-wheel drive.\n\n[[File:Porsche, Techno-Classica 2018, Essen (IMG 9738).jpg|thumb|right|The Porsche 993 Targa had a departure from the classic Targa design, incorporating an expensive glass sliding roof mechanism]]\n\nThe Targa open-topped model also made a return, this time with a large glass roof that slid under the rear window.

The similarity in specification and in performance levels inspired several comparison road tests with the 959.<ref>(f.e. [[Car and Driver]], July 1997, p. 63)</ref> The 3.6&nbsp;L twin-turbocharged M64/60 engine is rated at 408&nbsp;PS (300&nbsp;kW / 402&nbsp;hp). The performance was outstanding at the time, as 0 to 97&nbsp;km/h (60&nbsp;mph) has been measured at 3.2 seconds, and the braking was even more impressive in 2.3 seconds from the same speed. The car's top speed was measured at {{cvt|200|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} at 7,000 rpm. The differences were striking - the 959 had a much smaller engine, sequential turbocharging and a computer controlled all wheel drive system. The 993 turbo had parallel turbochargers, 3.6 litres of displacement, and a viscous coupling for the center differential in the AWD drivetrain. The turbo was only produced in 1996 and 1997 model years. The main difference was that the ECU in the 1996 model year could not be flashed for an upgrade, while the 1997 could. Additionally, the 1996 year had Porsche crested centre caps on the wheels, while the 1997 had turbo inscribed. Another difference is the motion sensor and map lights above the interior rear view mirror on the 1997 while the 1996 had no such devices.\n\nIn 1997, Porsche introduced a limited run of 183 units of the Sport version of the 993 turbo dubbed the turbo S. With 24&nbsp;PS (17.7&nbsp;kW) over the regular Turbo's 408&nbsp;PS (300&nbsp;kW), features include a scoop on the side right behind the doors for engine cooling and vents on the whale tail rear spoiler. Aside from an upgraded ECU mapping, a centre oil cooler behind the centre air intake at the front bumper was added.\n\n==Water-cooled engines (1998\u2013present)==\n\n===996 (1998/9\u20132004)===\n{{Main|Porsche 996}}\n\n[[File:2002 911C4S.JPG|thumb|right|2002 [[Porsche 996|996]] Carrera 4S]]\nThe Type 996 introduced in 1998 represented two major changes for the venerable 911 lineage: a [[water-cooled]] flat-6 engine replaced the popular air-cooled engine used in the 911 for 34&nbsp;years, and the body shell received its first major re-design. Changing to a water-cooled engine was controversial with Porsche traditionalists, who noted this as the end of the 'true' 911.\n\nThe 996 styling shared its front end with Porsche's mid engine entry-level [[Porsche Boxster|Boxster]]. Pinky Lai's work on the exterior won international design awards between 1997 and 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.designnstyling.com/|title=::Design & Styling|work=designnstyling.com|accessdate=24 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150129123936/http://www.designnstyling.com/|archive-date=29 January 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Carrera variant had a 0.30 [[coefficient of drag]]. The interior was criticized for its plainness and its lack of relationship to prior 911 interiors, although this came largely from owners of older 911s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport911.com/porsche911.html|title=AutoSport911|publisher=autosport911.com|accessdate=26 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127201500/http://www.autosport911.com/porsche911.html|archive-date=27 November 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Type 996 spawned over a dozen variations, including an all-wheel-drive Carrera 4 and Carrera 4S (the latter which had a 'Turbo look' in facelift form) models, the club racing-oriented [[Porsche 911 GT3|GT3]] and GT3 RS instead of a Carrera RS variant and the [[turbocharging|forced-induction]] 996 Turbo and [[Porsche 911 GT2|GT2]]. The Turbo, which was four-wheel-drive and had a  [[twin-turbocharged]] engine, often made appearances in magazines' lists of the best cars on sale.\n\nThe Carrera and Carrera 4 underwent revisions for 2002 model year, receiving clear lens front and rear indicator lights which were first seen on the Turbo version two years earlier. This allowed the 911 to be more distinguishable from the Boxster. A mildly revised front fascia was also introduced, though the basic architecture remained.\n\nEngine displacement was 3.4&nbsp;L and power \noutput was {{convert|300|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} featuring a change to an \"integrated dry sump\" design and variable valve timing. The displacement was increased in 2002 to 3.6&nbsp;L and power received an increase to 320&nbsp;PS (235&nbsp;kW).\n\nThe folding roof mechanism on the convertible variants required 19 seconds for operation. An electronically adjustable rear spoiler was installed that raised at speeds over 120&nbsp;km/h (75&nbsp;mph). It could also be raised manually by means of an electric switch.\n\nStarting from the models with water-cooled engines, all variants of the 911 Carrera do not come with rear [[limited-slip differential]], except the 40th Anniversary 911, GT2, GT3 and Turbo. The exception would be for MY1999 where the limited-slip differential was available as option code 220.{{citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=June 2012}}\n\n====996 GT3 (1999\u20132004)====\n[[File:Porsche 996 GT3 - Flickr - Alexandre Pr\u00e9vot (3).jpg|thumb|left|996 GT3]]\n[[File:Porsche exhibition at Oca, Parque do Ibirapuera 2018 057.jpg|thumb|right|996 GT3 RS]]\n\nPorsche introduced a road legal GT3 version of the 996 series which was derived from the company's racing car used in the GT3 class racing. Simply called GT3, the car featured lightweight materials including thinner windows and deletion of the rear seats. The GT3 was a lighter and more focused design with the emphasis on handling and performance, a concept that dates back to the 1973 Carrera RS. The suspension ride height was lowered and tuned for responsiveness over compliance and comfort. These revisions improved handling and steering. Of more significance was the engine used in the GT3. Instead of using a version of the water-cooled units found in other 996 models, the naturally aspirated engine was derived from the [[Porsche 911 GT1#1998|911 GT1 '98]] sports-prototype racing car and featured lightweight materials which enabled the engine to have higher rpm.\n\nThe engine used was a naturally aspirated {{cvt|3600|cc|L|1|abbr=on}} flat-six rather than the engine from the pre-facelift and revised Carrera. It is rated at {{convert|365|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at first and later improved to {{convert|386|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at the end of the 996 series' revision.\n\n====996 Turbo (2001\u20132005)====\n[[File:Porsche 996 Turbo - Flickr - Alexandre Pr\u00e9vot (15).jpg|thumb|996 Turbo]]\n\n[[File:Techno Classica 2018, Essen (IMG 0015).jpg|thumb|right|996 Turbo S]]\n\nIn 2000, Porsche launched the turbocharged version of the Type 996 for the 2001 model year. Like the GT3, the Turbo's engine was derived from the engine used in the 911 GT1 and, like its predecessor, featured twin-turbos and now had a power output of {{cvt|420|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Two/> Also like its predecessor, the new Turbo was only available with all-wheel drive. In 2002, the X50 package was available that increased the engine output to {{cvt|450|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} with {{cvt|620|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque across a wide section of the power band. With the X50 package, the car could accelerate from 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (0\u201362&nbsp;mph) in 3.91&nbsp;seconds. Later on toward the end of the 996 life cycle, the Turbo S nameplate also returned with the debut of the cabriolet variant as well. The Turbo S boasted even more power&mdash; 450&nbsp;PS (331&nbsp;kW) and 620&nbsp;N\u00b7m (457&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft<sub>f</sub>)&mdash; than the standard Turbo courtesy of the X50 package being standard. The Turbo S was limited to 1,500 units worldwide. The Turbo can attain a top speed of {{convert|189|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}}.<ref name=Two>Paternie, p. 92</ref>\n\nThe styling was more individual than the previous generations of the Turbo. Along with the traditional wider rear wing, the 996 Turbo had different front lights and bumpers when compared to the Carrera and Carrera 4. The rear bumper had air vents reminiscent of those on the 959 and there were large vents on the front bumper.\n\n===997 (2005\u20132012)===\n{{Main|Porsche 997}}\n[[File:Porsche 911 (997) Carrera - Flickr - The Car Spy (11).jpg|thumb|right|997 Carrera]]\n[[File:Porsche Carrera 4S front 20080519.jpg|thumb|right|997 Carrera S]]\n[[File:Porsche 911 Carrera 4S 997.jpg|thumb|997 Carrera 4S]]\n\nThe [[Porsche 996|996]] was replaced with the [[Porsche 997|997]] in 2005. It retains the 996's basic profile, with an even lower 0.28 drag coefficient, but draws on the 993 for detailing. In addition, the new headlights revert to the original bug-eye design from the teardrop scheme of the 996. Its interior is also similarly revised, with strong links to the earlier 911 interiors while at the same time looking fresh and modern. The 997 shares less than a third of its parts with the outgoing 996, but is still technically similar to it.\n\nInitially, two versions of the 997 were introduced&mdash; the rear-wheel-drive Carrera and Carrera S. While the base 997 Carrera had a power output of 325&nbsp;PS (239&nbsp;kW) from its 3.6&nbsp;L Flat 6, a more powerful 3.8&nbsp;L 355&nbsp;PS (261&nbsp;kW) Flat 6 powers the Carrera S. Besides a more powerful engine, the Carrera S also comes standard with 19&nbsp;inch (48&nbsp;cm) \"Lobster Fork\" style wheels, more powerful and larger brakes (with red calipers), lowered suspension with PASM (Porsche Active Suspension Management: dynamically adjustable dampers), Xenon headlamps, and a sports steering wheel.\n\nIn late 2005, Porsche introduced the all-wheel-drive versions to the 997 lineup. Carrera 4 models (both Carrera 4 and Carrera 4S) were announced as 2006 models. Both Carrera 4 models are wider than their rear-wheel-drive counterparts by 1.76&nbsp;inches (32&nbsp;mm) <!-- more precisely, 32.004 mm... was that measure in mm to begin with? --> to cover wider rear tyres. The 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (62&nbsp;mph) acceleration time for the Carrera 4S with the {{convert|355|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} engine equipped with a manual transmission was reported at 4.8&nbsp;seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.carsguide.com.au/car-reviews/porsche-perfection-8935|title=Porsche 911 Carrera 4 2005 Review|date=11 November 2005|accessdate=25 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425183625/https://www.carsguide.com.au/car-reviews/porsche-perfection-8935|archive-date=25 April 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (62&nbsp;mph) acceleration for the Carrera S with the {{convert|355|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} was noted to be as fast as 4.2&nbsp;seconds in a ''[[Motor Trend]]'' comparison, and ''[[Road & Track]]'' has timed it at 3.8&nbsp;seconds. The 997 lineup includes both 2- and 4-wheel-drive variants, named Carrera and Carrera 4 respectively. The Targas (4 and 4S), released in November 2006, are 4-wheel-drive versions that divide the difference between the coup\u00e9s and the cabriolets with their dual, sliding glass tops.\n\n[[File:2010 Porsche 997 Carrera GTS coupe 4105x2737.jpg|thumb|right|Porsche 997 GTS]]\n\nThe 997 received a larger air intake in the front bumper, new headlights, new rear taillights, new clean-sheet design [[gasoline direct injection|direct fuel injection]] engines, and the introduction of a [[dual-clutch gearbox]] called PDK for the 2009 model year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jalopnik.com/tag/2009-porsche-911/|title=2009 Porsche 911 Details Leaked!|publisher=Jalopnik|date=25 April 2008|access-date=25 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429224741/http://jalopnik.com/tag/2009-porsche-911/|archive-date=29 April 2008|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evo.co.uk/videos/planetevovideos/223848/porsche-911.html/|title=Porsche 911|publisher=EVO|date=20 June 2008|access-date=20 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622144156/http://www.evo.co.uk/videos/planetevovideos/223848/porsche-911.html|archive-date=22 June 2008|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> They were also equipped with [[Bluetooth]] support.\n\nThe change to the 7th generation (991) took place in the middle of the 2012 model year.

It has VTG ([[variable geometry turbocharger|variable turbine geometry]]), that combines the low-rev boost and quick responses of a small turbocharger with the high-rev power of a larger turbocharger. It also offers higher fuel efficiency compared to the 996 Turbo.\nThe 997 Turbo features a new [[all-wheel-drive]] system, similar to the one found on the [[Porsche Cayenne|Cayenne]]. The new PTM (Porsche Traction Management) system incorporates a clutch-based system which varies the amount of torque to the wheels to avoid tire slippage. According to Porsche, redirecting torque to control oversteer or understeer results in neutral handling as well as greatly improved performance in all weather conditions.\n\nFor the face lifted 2010 model year 911 Turbo, known internally as the 997.2 (as opposed to the 997.1 2007-2009 model years), launched in August 2009,<ref name=\"autocar1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/News/NewsArticle/AllCars/242347/ |title=Frankfurt motor show: Porsche 911 Turbo |publisher=Autocar.co.uk |date=15 September 2009 |accessdate=2011-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809124956/http://www.autocar.co.uk/News/NewsArticle/AllCars/242347/ |archive-date=9 August 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> the PTM system was tweaked to give a more rearward power bias.

The previous water-cooled turbo models (996 and 997) measured 3,600cc. This new engine measures 3,800cc (3.8 litres) and was first developed for the Carrera that was launched in 2008. The variable-vane twin turbochargers have also been reworked to increase responsiveness, and the intercooler and fuel system were uprated. The engine has a power output of  {{convert|493|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} which is 20&nbsp;hp more than the outgoing model.<ref name=\"autocar1\"/> The steering wheel also houses a display showing when Sport, Sport Plus and launch control have been selected through the optional Sport Chrono package.<ref name=\"autocar1\"/> Porsche claimed that the new 911 turbo will accelerate from {{convert|0|to|100|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} in 3.4 seconds, or 0&ndash;60&nbsp;mph in 3.2 seconds and could attain a top-speed of {{convert|312|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nAs with the 996 Turbo, the car featured distinctive styling cues over the Carrera models including front LED driving/parking/indicator lights mounted on a horizontal bar across the air intakes. The traditional rear wing is a variation of the 996 bi-plane unit.\n\nA new 911 Turbo S was set for production in 2010. It is a fully optioned Porsche 911 Turbo with a PDK gearbox and sports exhaust as standard. It also comes with re engineered turbo chargers to give an extra 30 horsepower increase to a total of {{convert|523|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n====997 GT3====\n[[File:BRRacing Porsche 997 GT3 front.jpg|thumb|right|997 GT3]]\n\nThe [[Porsche 997 GT3|911 GT3]] was added to the 997 lineage on 23 February 2006.

Unlike the GT3, the RS is built on the body and chassis of the 911 Carrera 4 and Turbo, and accordingly has a wider rear track for better cornering characteristics on the track.\n\nVisually, the RS is distinguished by its distinctive colour scheme \u2013 bright orange or green with black accents, which traces its roots to the iconic Carrera RS of 1973.  The plastic rear deck lid is topped by a wide carbon-fibre rear wing.  The front airdam has been fitted with an aero splitter to improve front downforce and provide more cooling air through the radiator.\n\nThe European version of the RS is fitted with lightweight plexiglass rear windows and a factory-installed roll cage.\n\nProduction of the first generation 997 GT3 RS ended in 2009.

The engine is rated at {{convert|408|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} via newly developed resonance intake manifold with 6 vacuum-controlled switching flaps. It includes 6-speed manual transmission, double-dome roof, {{convert|44|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} wider rear fenders, SportDesign front apron with a spoiler lip and a fixed 'duck tail' rear wing (similar to the one found on the 1973 Carrera RS 2.7), PCCB Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, {{convert|20|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} lower PASM sports suspension, mechanical rear axle differential, 19-inch black fuchs wheels, Porsche Exclusive woven leather seats and door panels, dashboard with Espresso Nature natural leather upholstery, and a specially developed Sport Classic Grey body colour.\n\n====Carrera GTS====\nFor the 2011 model year, Porsche introduced the first ever GTS model for the 911. Designed as a drivers car, the GTS was more powerful than the S, better handling via a bespoke suspension design, and positioned as a more street friendly alternative to the GT3, Porsche's track-focused 911 variant. The GTS featured race-inspired Center Lock Wheels, unique styling including a Sport Design front bumper, special rear bumper, blackout trim, side skirts borrowed from the GT2 model, brushed stainless steel \"Carrera GTS\" door sills and Alcantara trim. Many GTS' were ordered with the Alcantara delete, instead being built with leather.  The GTS was very rare in that is was a rear wheel drive Wide-Body design (44&nbsp;mm wider than a standard 911), 20&nbsp;mm lower and offered 408 HP (versus 385 HP for the S)  like the similar, limited volume Sport Classic and the Speedster.  Porsche built approximately 2,265 total GTS models for the world market, as well as a handful  designated as 2012 models.  The enthusiastic reception the GTS model received from both the motoring press and consumers, convinced Porsche to make the GTS a staple of the 911 line beginning in 2015, with the \"type 991\" 911 successor.\n\n====Speedster====\n[[File:Porsche 911 Speedster (5828928863).jpg|thumb|right|997 Speedster]]\nIn 2011, Porsche added a new 911 Speedster in a limited series of only 356 units to the 997 lineage, the number of cars produced recalling [[Porsche 356|the iconic car of the 1950s]]. It was the third 911 Speedster produced, the other two being from the [[Porsche 930|930]] and [[Porsche 964|964]] generations. The Speedster was powered by the same engine of the Carrera GTS which is rated at {{convert|414|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. It accelerated from 0 to {{convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} in 4.2 seconds and attained a top speed of around {{convert|190|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Only two colours were offered, Pure Blue (which was developed specifically for the Speedster) and Carrara White. (Paint To Sample versions were produced in very limited numbers and upon special request from \"loyal customers\".)\n\nThe Speedster featured a windscreen 70mm shorter than the standard 997 cabriolet while maintaining the same rake angle.\n\n===991 Series (2012 \u2013 2019)===\n{{Main|Porsche 991}}\n\n[[File:2013 Porsche 911 Carrera 4S (991) (9626546987).jpg|thumb|991 Carrera S]]\nThe [[Porsche 991|991]] introduced in 2012 is an entirely new platform, only the third since [[Porsche 911 classic|the original 911]]. Porsche revealed basic information on the new Carrera and Carrera S models on 23 August 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ausmotive.com/2011/08/23/official-991-porsche-911-revealed.html |title=Official: 2012 Porsche 911 (991) revealed |publisher=AUSmotive.com |accessdate=23 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920230930/http://www.ausmotive.com/2011/08/23/official-991-porsche-911-revealed.html |archive-date=20 September 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Carrera is powered by a {{cvt|355|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} 3.4-litre engine. The Carrera S features a 3.8-litre engine rated at {{cvt|406|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. A Power Kit (option X51) is available for the Carrera S, increasing power output to {{cvt|436|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. The new 991's overall length grows by {{cvt|2.2|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} and wheelbase grows by {{cvt|3.9|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} (now 96.5 in.) Overhangs are trimmed and the rear axle moves rearward at roughly {{cvt|3|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} towards the engine (made possible by new 3-shaft transmissions whose output flanges are moved closer to the engine). There is a wider front track ({{cvt|2|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} wider for the Carrera S). The design team for the 991 was headed by Michael Mauer.\n\nAt the front, the new 991 has wide-set headlights that are more three-dimensional. The front fender peaks are a bit more prominent, and wedgy directionals now appear to float above the intakes for the twin coolant radiators. The stretched rear 3/4 view has changed the most, with a slightly more voluminous form and thin taillights capped with the protruding lip of the bodywork. The biggest and main change in the interior is the center console, inspired by the [[Porsche Carrera GT|Carrera GT]] and adopted by the [[Porsche Panamera|Panamera]].\n\nThe 991 is the first 911 to use a predominantly [[aluminium]] construction. This means that even though the car is larger than the outgoing model, it is still up to {{convert|50|kg|lb}} lighter. The reduced weight and increased power means that both the Carrera and Carrera S are appreciably faster than the outgoing models. The 0\u201397&nbsp;km/h (60&nbsp;mph) acceleration time for the manual transmission cars are 4.6 seconds for the Carrera and 4.3 seconds for the Carrera S. When equipped with the PDK transmission, the two 991 models can accelerate from 0\u201397&nbsp;km/h in 4.4 seconds and 4.1 seconds. With the optional sports chrono package, available for the cars with the PDK transmission, the 991 Carrera can accelerate from 0\u201397&nbsp;km/h in as little as 4.2 seconds<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.porsche.com/usa/models/911/911-carrera/featuresandspecs/ |title=Technical Specs - 911 Carrera - All 911 Models |publisher=Porsche.com |accessdate=2012-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213191654/http://www.porsche.com/usa/models/911/911-carrera/featuresandspecs/ |archive-date=13 February 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and the Carrera S can do the same in 3.9 seconds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.porsche.com/usa/models/911/911-carrera-s/featuresandspecs/ |title=Technical Specs - 911 Carrera S - All 911 Models |publisher=Porsche.com |accessdate=2012-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213192340/http://www.porsche.com/usa/models/911/911-carrera-s/featuresandspecs/ |archive-date=13 February 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nApart from the reworked PDK transmission, the new 991 is also equipped with an industry-first 7-speed manual transmission. On vehicles produced in late 2012 (2013 model year) Rev Matching is available on the 7 speed manual transmission when equipped with the Sport Chrono package. Rev-Matching is a new feature with the manual transmission that blips the throttle during downshifts (if in Sport Plus mode). Also, the 7th gear cannot be engaged unless the car is already in 5th or 6th gear.\n\nOne of Porsche's primary objectives with the new model was to improve fuel economy as well as increase performance. In order to meet these objectives, Porsche introduced a number of new technologies in the 911. One of the most controversial of these is the introduction of electromechanical power steering instead of the previous hydraulic steering. This steering helps reduce fuel consumption, but some enthusiasts feel that the precise steering feedback for which the 911 is famous is reduced with the new system.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The cars also feature an engine stop/start system which turns the engine off at red lights, as well as a coasting system which allows the engine to idle while maintaining speed on downhill gradients on highways. This allows for up to 16% reduction in fuel consumption and emissions over the outgoing models.\n\nThe new cars also have a number of technologies aimed at improving handling. The cars include a torque vectoring system (standard on the Carrera S and optional on the Carrera) which brakes the inner wheel of the car when going into turns. This helps the car to turn in quicker and with more precision. The cars also feature hydraulic engine mounts (which help reduce the inertia of the engine when going into turns) as part of the optional sports chrono package. Active suspension management is standard on the Carrera S and optional on the Carrera. This helps improve ride quality on straights, while stiffening the suspension during aggressive driving. The new 991 is also equipped with a new feature called Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC). Porsche claims that this new feature alone has shaved 4 seconds off the standard car's lap time around the N\u00fcrburgring. PDCC helps the car corner flat and is said to improve high-speed directional stability and outright lateral body control, but according to several reviews, the car is more prone to understeer when equipped with this new technology.\n\nIn January 2013, Porsche introduced the all-wheel-drive variants of the Carrera models. The '4' and '4S' models are distinguishable by wider tyres, marginally wider rear body-work and a red-reflector strip that sits in between the tail-lights. In terms of technology, the 4 and 4S models are equipped with an all-new variable all-wheel-drive system that sends power to the front wheels only when needed, giving the driver a sense of being in a rear-wheel-drive 911.\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:FoS20162016 0624 132727AA (27886350045).jpg|991 Turbo S\n</gallery>\n\nIn May 2013, Porsche announced changes to the model year 2014 911 Turbo and Turbo S models, increasing their power to {{cvt|520|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} on the 'Turbo', and {{cvt|560|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} on the 'Turbo S', giving them a 0&ndash;97&nbsp;km/h acceleration time of 3.2 and 2.9 seconds, respectively. A [[Four-wheel steering|rear-wheel steering]] system has also been incorporated on the Turbo models that steers the rear wheels in the opposite direction at low speeds or the same direction at high speeds to improve handling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.automoblog.net/2013/05/06/turbo-terror-the-new-porsche-911-turbo-announced/ |title=Turbo Terror: New Porsche 911 Turbo Announced |publisher=Automoblog.net |date=6 May 2013 |accessdate=2013-05-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508120143/http://www.automoblog.net/2013/05/06/turbo-terror-the-new-porsche-911-turbo-announced/ |archive-date=8 May 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> During low-speed maneuvers, this has the virtual effect of shortening the wheelbase, while at high speeds, it is virtually extending the wheelbase for higher driving stability and agility.\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Festival automobile international 2015 - Porsche 911 Targa - 003.jpg|The 991 Targa features an all-new electronically operated roof mechanism which allows it to have the original Targa design\n</gallery>\n\nIn January 2014, Porsche introduced the new model year 2015 Targa 4 and Targa 4S models.

The 3.8-litre unit found in the previous 997 GT3 is replaced with a 4.0-litre unit that has a power output of {{cvt|500|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and 460&nbsp;Nm (339&nbsp;lbft) of torque. The transmission is PDK only. The car accelerates from 0&ndash;100&nbsp;km/h (62&nbsp;mph) in 3.4 seconds (0.6 seconds quicker than the 997 GT3 RS 4.0) and 0&ndash;200&nbsp;km/h (124&nbsp;mph) in 10.9 seconds. The 991 GT3 RS also comes with functions such as declutching by \"paddle neutral\" \u2014 comparable to pressing the clutch with a conventional manual gearbox \u2013 and a Pit Speed limiter button. As with the 911 GT3, a rear-axle steering and Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus with fully variable rear axle differential lock are available as standard.\n\nIn February 2018, Porsche introduced a facelifted GT3 RS model to continue their updates for the 991 generation of the 911. Changes include a new engine similar to the GT3 and RSR models with a 9,000 rpm redline and a {{convert|20|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|10|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} increase over the outgoing model, NACA ducts for brake cooling, modified front fascia (similar to the 991.2 GT3), side skits and rear wing (similar to the [[Porsche 911 GT2#Road cars|GT2 RS]]) for increased downforce, ball joints on all suspension links, front helper springs, lightweight glass for the rear and rear-side windows and a newly developed tyre compound. A Weissach package was available that included additional carbon fibre body and interior parts as well as magnesium wheels and stiffer suspension settings is available as an option.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://press.porsche.com/news/release.php?id=1063|title=Born from racing: the new 2019 Porsche 911 GT3 RS|work=[[Porsche]]|accessdate=20 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221100409/http://press.porsche.com/news/release.php?id=1063|archive-date=21 February 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n====911 R====\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:FoS20162016 0624 132640AA (27608366620).jpg|911 R\n</gallery>\nIn 2016, Porsche unveiled a limited production 911 R based on the GT3 RS.

It was initially unveiled at the 2017 E3 along with the announcement of the ''[[Forza Motorsport 7]]'' video game.\nThe car was officially launched by Porsche at the 2017 [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]] along with the introduction of the 911 Turbo S Exclusive Series. The 991 GT2 RS is powered by a 3.8&nbsp;L twin-turbocharged flat-6 engine that produces a maximum power of {{convert|700|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,000 rpm and {{convert|750|N\u00b7m|lb\u00b7ft|abbr=on}} of torque, making it the most powerful 911 ever built.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Unlike the previous GT2 versions, this car is fitted with a 7-speed [[Dual-clutch transmission|PDK]] transmission to handle the excessive torque produced from the engine. Porsche claims that this car will accelerate from 0 to 60&nbsp;mph (97&nbsp;km/h) in 2.7&nbsp;seconds, and has a top speed of {{convert|340|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe car has a roof made of magnesium, front lid, front and rear spoilers and boot lid made of carbon, front and rear apron made of lightweight polyurethane, rear and side windows made of polycarbonate and features a titanium exhaust system. Porsche claims that the car will have a wet weight of {{cvt|1470|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nA Weissach package option is available, which reduces the weight by {{cvt|30|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, through the use of additional carbon-fiber and titanium parts. These include the roof, the anti-roll bars and the coupling rods on both axles made out of carbon-fiber while the package also includes a set of light-weight [[magnesium]] wheels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carscoops.com/2017/06/700hp-2018-porsche-911-gt2-rs-is-most.html|title=700HP 2018 Porsche 911 GT2 RS Is The Most Powerful 911 Of All Time - Carscoops|date=30 June 2017|website=carscoops.com|access-date=25 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111155233/http://www.carscoops.com/2017/06/700hp-2018-porsche-911-gt2-rs-is-most.html|archive-date=11 January 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Speedster (2019)====\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Porsche 911 Speedster Concept, Paris Motor Show 2018, IMG 0433.jpg|Porsche 911 Speedster Concept\nFile:Porsche 911 Speedster Concept, Paris Motor Show 2018, IMG 0434.jpg|Porsche 911 Speedster Concept\n</gallery>\n\nAt the 2018 [[Paris Motor Show]] held in October on the occasion of the 70th anniversary celebration of the marque, Porsche unveiled the Speedster variant of the 991 generation for the 911, as a concept.

In order to qualify for GT racing, 25 road-going models were built to achieve type homologation. The engine in the GT1 is rated at {{convert|608|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} ({{cvt|544|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} for the road version) and accelerated from 0\u201397&nbsp;km/h in 3.3 seconds. The top speed stood at {{convert|205|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Both the road and race cars carried the same [[twin-turbocharged]] engine as used in the [[Porsche 962|962]], and the race car was a match for the then dominant [[McLaren F1 GTR]]s. A redeveloped version of the 911 GT1 race car was later built, winning outright at the [[1998 24 Hours of Le Mans]]. The car is not considered to be a real 911{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}, as it is derived from the 962 with the 993 and later the 996 911's front section. It was the most powerful and fastest road-going Porsche until the introduction of the [[Porsche Carrera GT|Carrera GT]] in 2004 and later the [[Porsche 918|918 Spyder]] in 2013.\n\n==Awards==\nIn 1999, the 911 placed fifth in the  Global Automotive Elections Foundation's [[Car of the Century]] competition, trailing mass market cars: [[Ford Model T]], BMC [[Mini]], [[Citro\u00ebn DS]], and [[Volkswagen Beetle]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/press/date/19991216/press004615.html |title=Porsche 911 Nominated as 'Car of the Century' Award Finalist |publisher=Theautochannel.com |date=17 December 1999 |accessdate=2015-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402102144/http://www.theautochannel.com/news/press/date/19991216/press004615.html |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/chocolatey-f1-cars-tweaked-luxury-taxes-and-the-car-of-the-century-car-news |title=Chocolatey F1 Cars, Tweaked Luxury Taxes, and the Car of the Century |magazine=Car and Driver |date=March 2000 |accessdate=2015-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402091422/http://www.caranddriver.com/news/chocolatey-f1-cars-tweaked-luxury-taxes-and-the-car-of-the-century-car-news |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, ''[[Sports Car International]]'' named the 911 number three on the list of [[Sports Car International Top Sports Cars|Top Sports Cars of the 1960s]], the Carrera RS number seven on the list of [[Sports Car International Top Sports Cars|Top Sports Cars of the 1970s]], and the 911 Carrera number seven on the list of [[Sports Car International Top Sports Cars|Top Sports Cars of the 1980s]].

Midas Interactive Entertainment is based on the outskirts of [[Braintree, Essex|Braintree]] in [[Essex]], [[England]] .\n\nMost of the [[video game console|console]] games published by Midas are \"budget\" releases sold at a lower price than the majority of new titles, and are often localised [[Japan]]ese titles - many of which were also released at a budget price in Japan.\n\n==History==\nMidas was originally founded as a Netherlands-based company called '''Midas Interactive Entertainment BV''' in 1998 by Paul Share. Unlike with other budget publishers, Share wanted his company to offer original titles and sell them inexpensively worldwide instead of buying games from other publishers and selling them cheaply. The company introduced their first labels: ''Reality'' and ''Arena Games''. Midas during this time focused exclusively on publishing games for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Macintosh]].\n\nIn January 1999, Midas launched their ''Pocket Price Games'' label, alongside the compilation labels ''2 in 1'' and ''All in One Packs''. A UK subsidiary known as '''Midas Interactive Entertainment Ltd.''' was founded in February of that year. Midas also acquired the [[Greenwich]] based game developer Interactive Entertainment Ltd. the same year, who would became a fully owned subsidiary of Midas. The company started to release games on the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in January 2000.\n\nIn 2001, Midas Interactive Entertainment Ltd. became the Corporate Headquarters for the Midas Interactive Entertainment Group. The original Netherlands-based office remains in operation for the bulk of International sales plus central European manufacturing, warehousing & distribution.\n\nIn 2002 Share founded Phoenix Games which took control over their movie publishing on PlayStation and Playstation 2.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dingopictures.fandom.com/wiki/Phoenix_Games|title=Phoenix Games|website=The Dingo Pictures Wiki|language=en|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, Midas formed a sister company called [[Ghostlight]], who would take control of localising Japanese titles for the European market from Midas.

Midas Interactive Entertainment is based on the outskirts of [[Braintree, Essex|Braintree]] in [[Essex]], [[England]] .\n\nMost of the [[video game console|console]] games published by Midas are \"budget\" releases sold at a lower price than the majority of new titles, and are often localised [[Japan]]ese titles - many of which were also released at a budget price in Japan.\n\n==History==\nMidas was originally founded as a Netherlands-based company called '''Midas Interactive Entertainment BV''' in 1998 by Paul Share. Unlike with other budget publishers, Share wanted his company to offer original titles and sell them inexpensively worldwide instead of buying games from other publishers and selling them cheaply. The company introduced their first labels: ''Reality'' and ''Arena Games''. Midas during this time focused exclusively on publishing games for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Macintosh]].\n\nIn January 1999, Midas launched their ''Pocket Price Games'' label, alongside the compilation labels ''2 in 1'' and ''All in One Packs''. A UK subsidiary known as '''Midas Interactive Entertainment Ltd.''' was founded in February of that year. Midas also acquired the [[Greenwich]] based game developer Interactive Entertainment Ltd. the same year, who would became a fully owned subsidiary of Midas. The company started to release games on the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in January 2000.\n\nIn 2001, Midas Interactive Entertainment Ltd. became the Corporate Headquarters for the Midas Interactive Entertainment Group. The original Netherlands-based office remains in operation for the bulk of International sales plus central European manufacturing, warehousing & distribution.\n\nIn 2005, Midas formed a sister company called [[Ghostlight]], who would take control of localising Japanese titles for the European market from Midas. Both companies, alongside [[Laughing Jackal]] became part of holding company Majesty House Group.\n\nAs of 2012, Midas no longer releases new titles, and has since been focusing on re-releasing older titles on the [[PlayStation Network]], mainly localised [[Simple Series]] titles that [[Agetec]] released in the United States.\n\n== Games published by Midas ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

This, as well as lackluster promotion by the nearly broke label, caused the album to sell poorly, finishing well out of the ''Billboard'' Top 100. Soon after the third album's eventual release, Tetragrammaton went out of business, leaving the band with no money and an uncertain future. (Tetragrammaton's assets were assumed by [[Warner Bros.
