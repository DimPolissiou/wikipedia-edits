J. Abrams]] and Lindsey Weber<!-- Do not remove the producers, please. They are also important. --> and written by Josh Campbell, Matthew Stuecken and [[Damien Chazelle]]. The film stars [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]], [[John Goodman]] and [[John Gallagher Jr.]] It is the second installment in the [[Cloverfield (franchise)|''Cloverfield'' franchise]]. The story follows a young woman who, after a car crash, wakes up in an underground bunker with two men who insist that an event has left the surface of Earth uninhabitable.\n\nThe film was developed from a script titled ''The Cellar'', but under production by [[Bad Robot Productions|Bad Robot]], it was turned into a [[spiritual successor]] to the 2008 film ''[[Cloverfield]]''. It is presented in a [[third-person narrative]], in contrast to its predecessor's [[Found footage (film technique)|found-footage]] style. [[Principal photography]] took place under the title ''Valencia'' in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], from October 20 to December 15, 2014.\n\n''10 Cloverfield Lane'' premiered in [[New York City]] on March 8, 2016, and was released in select countries on March 10. It was released in the United States on March 11, 2016, in both conventional and [[IMAX]] formats. The film received positive reviews, with many praising the performances of the cast, as well as the film's tense and suspenseful atmosphere; it grossed $110 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400\u2013700 words.

While driving through rural [[Louisiana]] late at night, she hears news reports of blackouts in several major cities before her car is sideswiped by a truck trying to overtake her, causing a crash which leaves her unconscious. She wakes in a locked room, an apparent leg brace chained to a pipe, with bedding and her packed bag laying nearby.  A man enters the room and introduces himself as Howard, explaining that they are in a bunker beneath his own [[farmhouse]] about forty miles outside of [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]]. He claims he found her in the ditch and saved her life, and also that the air outside is radiated by a nuclear or chemical [[fallout]] from an apparently very recent \"attack\".\n\nHe later takes her on a tour of the well-stocked bunker where she meets Emmett, another survivor. Howard, noticing Michelle's suspicion, shows her the viewport of the bunker's entrance where she sees two dead and decayed pigs outside, evidence of the fallout. Michelle also sees Howard's truck and recognizes it as the truck that drove her off the road. She privately relays her concerns about Howard's motivations to Emmett, who dismisses them and claims to have seen the attack with his own eyes.  He was not abducted as she was but rather sought Howard's refuge voluntarily.\n\nDuring their first dinner together, Michelle stokes Howard's jealousy to incite rage, during which she steals his keys and runs to the hatch in an attempt to escape. As she goes to open the door, however, a woman with facial lesions exits a car and beats the window, begging to be let inside. Michelle does not open the door, returning to the bunker and leaving the woman to her fate.\n\nHoward opens up about his daughter, who he states is \"not with us anymore\". He enlists Michelle to fix the air filtration unit when it fails since she is small enough to fit through the vents; while repairing it, she finds a locked skylight, with the word \"HELP\" scratched on the inside of the glass. Michelle and Emmett discover that Howard's purported daughter was a young girl who had gone missing about two years earlier, and they suspect he abducted her. They make plans to escape, creating a makeshift [[hazmat suit]] in secret. When Howard discovers that tools and parts are missing, he accuses the two of stealing them, threatening to immerse them in a barrel of [[perchloric acid]]. Emmett takes responsibility, claiming that he was building a weapon so that Michelle would respect him. Howard pulls his gun and kills Emmett. He tries to comfort Michelle, telling her that he killed Emmett to protect her. In shock, Michelle makes final preparations to leave when she is surprised by Howard. She manages to escape from him with the suit. En route, she knocks over the acid barrel, which starts an electrical fire in the bunker. It later explodes, killing Howard.\n\nMichelle dons the suit and escapes the burning bunker onto Howard's homestead. Seeing signs of living wildlife, she takes off the suit's helmet, but then she suddenly sees a giant [[biomechanics|biomechanical]] alien spacecraft, drawn by the bunker explosion. A quadrupedal creature drops from the craft and chases Michelle, forcing her to hide in a shed. She then races towards the farmhouse, but the craft appears and emits a green gas that forces Michelle back into the suit. Her delay allows mechanical appendages from the ship to capture her, but she is able to craft a [[Molotov cocktail]] from items in Howard's truck to throw into the ship. The fireball destroys the ship causing it to crash and the appendage drops her; after recovering she is able to take the dead woman's car and escape.\n\nAs she nears the Texas border she hears radio chatter instructing any survivors to head to [[Baton Rouge]] to evacuate, but also requesting the help of anyone with medical or combat training in [[Houston]]. At a crossroad, she pauses a moment before driving off towards Houston. In the distance, two larger alien craft can be seen in the sky.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[John Goodman]] as Howard Stambler<ref name=\"tagruato\">{{cite web |url=http://tagruato.jp/employee_of_the_month_2016_february.php |title=Tagruato Corporation - Employees of the Month: February 2016 |accessdate=February 10, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160210215047/http://tagruato.jp/employee_of_the_month_2016_february.php |archivedate=February 10, 2016 }} [http://www.tagruato.jp/ Tagruato.jp]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215075036/http://www.tagruato.jp/ |date=2008-02-15 }} is a website that was first used by the makers of ''Cloverfield'' in its [[Cloverfield#Viral tie-ins|viral marketing campaign]].</ref>\n* [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]] as Michelle<ref name=\"empire\">{{cite web|url=https://empireonline.com/movies/features/jj-abrams-talks-10-cloverfield-lane-secrets/|title=Exclusive: J.J.

J. Abrams]] and Lindsey Weber<!-- Do not remove the producers, please. They are also important. --> and written by Josh Campbell, Matthew Stuecken and [[Damien Chazelle]]. The film stars [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]], [[John Goodman]], and [[John Gallagher Jr.]] It is the second installment in the [[Cloverfield (franchise)|''Cloverfield'' franchise]]. The story follows a young woman who, after a car crash, wakes up in an underground bunker with two men who insist that an event has left the surface of Earth uninhabitable.\n\nThe film was developed from a script titled ''The Cellar'', but under production by [[Bad Robot Productions|Bad Robot]], it was turned into a [[spiritual successor]] to the 2008 film ''[[Cloverfield]]''. It is presented in a [[third-person narrative]], in contrast to its predecessor's [[Found footage (film technique)|found-footage]] style. [[Principal photography]] took place under the title ''Valencia'' in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] from October 20 to December 15, 2014.\n\n''10 Cloverfield Lane'' premiered in [[New York City]] on March 8, 2016 and was released in select countries on March 10. It was released in the United States on March 11, 2016, in both conventional and [[IMAX]] formats. The film received positive reviews, with many praising the performances of the cast, as well as the film's tense and suspenseful atmosphere; it grossed $110 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400\u2013700 words.

While driving through rural [[Louisiana]] late at night, she hears news reports of blackouts in several major cities before her car is sideswiped by a truck trying to overtake her, causing a crash which leaves her unconscious. She wakes in a locked room, an apparent leg brace chained to a pipe, with bedding and her packed bag laying nearby.  A man enters the room and introduces himself as Howard, explaining that they are in a bunker beneath his own [[farmhouse]] about forty miles outside of [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]]. He claims he found her in the ditch and saved her life, and also that the air outside is radiated by a nuclear or chemical [[fallout]] from an apparently very recent \"attack\".\n\nHe later takes her on a tour of the well-stocked bunker where she meets Emmett, another survivor. Howard, noticing Michelle's suspicion, shows her the viewport of the bunker's entrance where she sees two dead and decayed pigs outside, evidence of the fallout. Michelle also sees Howard's truck and recognizes it as the truck that drove her off the road. She privately relays her concerns about Howard's motivations to Emmett, who dismisses them and claims to have seen the attack with his own eyes.  He was not abducted as she was but rather sought Howard's refuge voluntarily.\n\nDuring their first dinner together, Michelle stokes Howard's jealousy to incite rage, during which she steals his keys and runs to the hatch in an attempt to escape. As she goes to open the door, however, a woman with facial lesions exits a car and beats the window, begging to be let inside. Michelle does not open the door, returning to the bunker and leaving the woman to her fate.\n\nHoward opens up about his daughter, who he states is \"not with us anymore\". He enlists Michelle to fix the air filtration unit when it fails since she is small enough to fit through the vents; while repairing it, she finds a locked skylight, with the word \"HELP\" scratched on the inside of the glass. Michelle and Emmett discover that Howard's purported daughter was a young girl who had gone missing about two years earlier, and they suspect he abducted her. They make plans to escape, creating a makeshift [[hazmat suit]] in secret. When Howard discovers that tools and parts are missing, he accuses the two of stealing them, threatening to immerse them in a barrel of [[perchloric acid]]. Emmett takes responsibility, claiming that he was building a weapon so that Michelle would respect him. Howard pulls his gun and kills Emmett. He tries to comfort Michelle, telling her that he killed Emmett to protect her. In shock, Michelle makes final preparations to leave when she is surprised by Howard. She manages to escape from him with the suit. En route, she knocks over the acid barrel, which starts an electrical fire in the bunker. It later explodes, killing Howard.\n\nMichelle dons the suit and escapes the burning bunker onto Howard's homestead. Seeing signs of living wildlife, she takes off the suit's helmet, but then she suddenly sees a giant [[biomechanics|biomechanical]] alien spacecraft, drawn by the bunker explosion. A quadrupedal creature drops from the craft and chases Michelle, forcing her to hide in a shed. She then races towards the farmhouse, but the craft appears and emits a green gas that forces Michelle back into the suit. Her delay allows mechanical appendages from the ship to capture her, but she is able to craft a [[Molotov cocktail]] from items in Howard's truck to throw into the ship. The fireball destroys the ship causing it to crash and the appendage drops her; after recovering she is able to take the dead woman's car and escape.\n\nAs she nears the Texas border she hears radio chatter instructing any survivors to head to [[Baton Rouge]] to evacuate, but also requesting the help of anyone with medical or combat training in [[Houston]]. At a crossroad, she pauses a moment before driving off towards Houston. In the distance, two larger alien craft can be seen in the sky.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[John Goodman]] as Howard Stambler<ref name=\"tagruato\">{{cite web |url=http://tagruato.jp/employee_of_the_month_2016_february.php |title=Tagruato Corporation - Employees of the Month: February 2016 |accessdate=February 10, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160210215047/http://tagruato.jp/employee_of_the_month_2016_february.php |archivedate=February 10, 2016 }} [http://www.tagruato.jp/ Tagruato.jp]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215075036/http://www.tagruato.jp/ |date=2008-02-15 }} is a website that was first used by the makers of ''Cloverfield'' in its [[Cloverfield#Viral tie-ins|viral marketing campaign]].</ref>\n* [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]] as Michelle<ref name=\"empire\">{{cite web|url=https://empireonline.com/movies/features/jj-abrams-talks-10-cloverfield-lane-secrets/|title=Exclusive: J.J.
