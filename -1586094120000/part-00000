He has appeared in ten of the eleven ''Star Trek'' films to date. At various points throughout the course of the films, R2 is a friend to [[C-3PO]], [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]], [[Darth Vader|Anakin Skywalker]], [[Leia Organa|Leia Orgasma]], [[Luke Skywalker| Luke Skywanker]], [[Spock]], [[BB-8]], [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] and [[D-O (Star Wars)|D-O]]. R2-D2 and his companion C-3PO are the only characters to appear in every ''Star Trek'' film, with the exception of ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]''.\n\nEnglish actor [[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]] played R2-D2 in all three original ''Star Trek'' films and received [[Billing (filmmaking)|billing credit]] for the character in the [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|prequel trilogy]], where Baker's role was reduced as R2-D2 was portrayed mainly by [[Radio-controlled model|radio controlled props]] and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] models. In the [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|sequel trilogy]], Baker was credited as consultant for ''[[The Force Awakens]]''; however, [[Jimmy Vee]] also co-performed the character in some scenes. Vee later took over the role beginning in ''[[The Last Jedi]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/star-wars-last-jedi-r2-d2-jimmy-vee-kenny-baker-1201987961/|title='Star Wars': R2-D2 Role to Be Filled by Jimmy Vee in 'The Last Jedi'|last=McNary|first=Dave|date=February 14, 2017|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref> Hassan Taj and Lee Towersey perform the role of R2-D2, replacing Jimmy Vee, who had played the role in the previous two films.\n\nR2-D2 was designed in artwork by [[Ralph McQuarrie]], co-developed by [[John Stears]] and built by Peteric Engineering. The revised ''Empire Strikes Back'' droids were built by [[Tony Dyson]] (sometimes incorrectly credited as the \"maker\" of R2-D2) and his Rocking Horse Toy Company. R2-D2's sounds and vocal effects were created by [[Ben Burtt]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Design==\nGeorge Lucas's creation of R2-D2 was influenced by [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1958 feature film ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]'' (released in the United States in 1962), particularly Tahei and Matashichi, the two [[comic relief]] characters that serve as sidekicks to General Makabe. Lucas and artist [[Ralph McQuarrie]] also drew inspiration from the robots Huey, Dewey, and Louie from [[Douglas Trumbull]]'s 1972 film ''[[Silent Running]]''.\n\nThe name derives from when Lucas was making one of his earlier films, ''[[American Graffiti]]''. Sound editor [[Walter Murch]] states that he is responsible for the utterance which sparked the name for the droid. Murch asked for Reel 2, Dialog Track 2, in the abbreviated form \"R-2-D-2\". Lucas, who was in the room and had dozed off while working on the script for ''Star Wars'', momentarily woke when he heard the request and, after asking for clarification, stated that it was a \"great name\" before going back to writing his script.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmfreakcentral.net/notes/wminterview4.htm|title=Film Freak Central Interviews Editor Walter Murch (page 4)|author=Bill Chambers|date=2000|publisher=FilmFreakCentral.net|page=4|accessdate=March 23, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810072318/http://filmfreakcentral.net/notes/wminterview4.htm|archivedate=August 10, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Jay Jones|first1=Brian|title=George Lucas: A Life|date=2016|publisher=Hachette|isbn=9780316257459|page=162|url=https://books.google.cl/books?id=8rAmDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT162|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nR2-D2 stands for Second Generation Robotic Droid Series-2, according to a ''Star Wars'' encyclopedia published after the release of the film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artifintell.weebly.com/r2-d2.html|title=R2-D2|website=AI - Artificial Intelligence!}}</ref>\n[[Tony Dyson]], owner of the [[special effect]]s studio The White Horse Toy Company, was commissioned by special effects supervisor Brian Johnson to fabricate the revised mechanical design for the Empire Strikes Back, making several units operated by remote control. A number were used by Baker, and two were stunt double models made for the scene where the droid was shot from the swamp onto the shore on [[Dagobah]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===Skywalker saga===\n{{main|Skywalker saga}}\n====Original trilogy====\n=====''Episode IV: A New Hope''=====\nIn ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]'', R2-D2 and [[C-3PO]] ([[Anthony Daniels]]) are both introduced on board the ''[[Tantive IV]]'', along with [[Princess Leia]] ([[Carrie Fisher]]) of [[Alderaan]], when they are being pursued upon by [[Darth Vader]] (portrayed by [[David Prowse]], voiced by [[James Earl Jones]]) aboard an [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Imperial]] [[Star Destroyer]]. Leia inserts into R2-D2 an information disc containing the plans for the [[Death Star]] battle station, and encodes a distress message on the droid's holographic projector. The droids then escape in a pod that crashes on [[Tatooine]] near [[Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]'s ([[Alec Guinness]]) desert abode.\n\nR2-D2 and C-3PO are then abducted by [[Jawa (Star Wars)|Jawas]] and bought by [[Owen Lars|Owen]] ([[Phil Brown (actor)|Phil Brown]]) and [[Beru Lars]] ([[Shelagh Fraser]]), step-uncle and -aunt of [[Luke Skywalker]] ([[Mark Hamill]]). While Luke cleans the sand out of R2-D2's gears, he discovers a fragment of Leia's message, and removes the droid's restraining bolt to see more; once free of the bolt, R2 claims to have no knowledge of the message. That night, R2-D2 leaves the farm to seek out Obi-Wan. When Owen and Beru are killed by [[Imperial stormtrooper]]s, Luke is forced to leave Tatooine with Obi-Wan, [[Han Solo]] ([[Harrison Ford]]), and [[Chewbacca]] ([[Peter Mayhew]]) on board the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' to deliver R2-D2 to the [[Rebel Alliance]]. On their arrival at Alderaan's co-ordinates, they are pulled in by the Death Star's [[tractor beam]] and are forced to land, but eventually rescue Princess Leia. After Vader kills Obi-Wan, the rest of the group escapes and delivers the Death Star plans to the Rebel Alliance. R2 later serves as Luke's droid during the [[Battle of Yavin|attack on the station]]. R2-D2 is severely damaged during the battle, but is repaired before the ceremony at the end of the film.\n\n=====''Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back''=====\nIn ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', R2-D2 accompanies Luke to [[Dagobah]], and later to [[Bespin|Cloud City]], where he helps to rescue and repair a heavily damaged C-3PO and to override city security computers. He also manages to reactivate the ''Millennium Falcon''{{'}}s hyperdrive, resulting in a last-minute escape from Imperial forces.\n\n=====''Episode VI: Return of the Jedi''=====\nIn ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', R2-D2 plays a critical role in rescuing Luke, Leia, and Han from [[Jabba the Hutt]]. He later joins the Rebel strike team on [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]]. He is badly damaged during the battle between the Imperial troops and the Rebels, but is repaired in time for the celebration marking the second Death Star's destruction and the fall of the Empire.\n\n====Prequel trilogy====\n=====''Episode I: The Phantom Menace''=====\nIn ''[[Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'', set 32 years before ''A New Hope'', R2-D2 is portrayed as belonging to the [[Naboo]] defense forces, one of four astromech droids deployed for repair duty on Queen [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]]'s ([[Natalie Portman]]) [[starship]] as it attempts to get past the [[Trade Federation]] blockade. The sole survivor of the four, R2-D2 becomes part of [[Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]]'s ([[Liam Neeson]]) party on [[Tatooine]] and meets [[C-3PO]] and [[Anakin Skywalker]] ([[Jake Lloyd]]). Later still, he serves as the astromech droid for Anakin's [[Military spacecraft in fiction|starfighter]] during the Battle of Naboo.\n\n=====''Episode II: Attack of the Clones''=====\nIn ''[[Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]'', set 10 years after ''The Phantom Menace'', R2-D2 again serves Anakin ([[Hayden Christensen]]) and Obi-Wan ([[Ewan McGregor]]). He accompanies Anakin and Padm\u00e9 to Naboo, and then to Tatooine when Anakin tries to rescue his mother [[Shmi Skywalker|Shmi]] ([[Pernilla August]]). Here, he is reunited with C-3PO, and the two get into various misadventures on Geonosis. He and C-3PO are later witnesses to Anakin and Padm\u00e9's secret wedding.\n\n=====''Episode III: Revenge of the Sith''=====\nIn ''[[Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith]]'', R2-D2 helps Anakin and Obi-Wan in their mission to rescue Chancellor [[Palpatine]] ([[Ian McDiarmid]]) from [[Count Dooku]]'s ([[Christopher Lee]]) capital ship, the ''Invisible Hand''. He is attacked by battle droids, but defeats them through ingenious tactics. After Anakin falls to the [[dark side (Star Wars)|dark side]] of [[the Force]] and becomes [[Darth Vader]], he takes R2-D2 with him when he goes to assassinate the Separatist council, but tells him to stay with the ship. After the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] is established at the end of the film, C-3PO's memory is erased to keep the knowledge of the locations of Vader and Padm\u00e9\u2019s newborn children, Luke and Leia, a secret from their father. However, R2-D2's memory isn't wiped; as a result, R2-D2 is the only surviving character at the end of ''Return of the Jedi'' who knows the entire story of the [[Skywalker family]]. Both R2-D2 and C-3PO end up in the possession of Captain [[Raymus Antilles]] ([[Rohan Nichol]]) onboard the ''Tantive IV''.\n\n====Sequel trilogy====\n=====''Episode VII: The Force Awakens''=====\nIn ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'', set approximately 30 years after ''Return of the Jedi'', R2-D2 is revealed to be kept in storage at the [[Resistance (Star Wars)|Resistance]] base on the planet [[D'Qar]], having put himself in a low-power mode after Luke Skywalker's disappearance. He later awakens and reveals Luke's location by combining map data stored in his memory with that of the droid [[BB-8]]. He then travels with [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] ([[Daisy Ridley]]) and Chewbacca to the planet highlighted on the map, where they find Luke in self-imposed exile. In the credits, Kenny Baker was credited as 'R2-D2 consultant,' while Jimmy Vee provided an uncredited portrayal in some scenes.\n\n=====''Episode VIII: The Last Jedi''=====\nR2-D2 appeared in ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi]]'', with actor Jimmy Vee taking over the role from Kenny Baker, who retired from the role due to his age and health.

The revised ''Empire Strikes Back'' droids were built by [[Tony Dyson]] (sometimes incorrectly credited as the \"maker\" of R2-D2) and his Rocking Horse Toy Company. R2-D2's sounds and vocal effects were created by [[Ben Burtt]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Design==\nGeorge Lucas's creation of R2-D2 was influenced by [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1958 feature film ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]'' (released in the United States in 1962), particularly Tahei and Matashichi, the two [[comic relief]] characters that serve as sidekicks to General Makabe. Lucas and artist [[Ralph McQuarrie]] also drew inspiration from the robots Huey, Dewey, and Louie from [[Douglas Trumbull]]'s 1972 film ''[[Silent Running]]''.\n\nThe name derives from when Lucas was making one of his earlier films, ''[[American Graffiti]]''. Sound editor [[Walter Murch]] states that he is responsible for the utterance which sparked the name for the droid. Murch asked for Reel 2, Dialog Track 2, in the abbreviated form \"R-2-D-2\". Lucas, who was in the room and had dozed off while working on the script for ''Star Wars'', momentarily woke when he heard the request and, after asking for clarification, stated that it was a \"great name\" before going back to writing his script.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmfreakcentral.net/notes/wminterview4.htm|title=Film Freak Central Interviews Editor Walter Murch (page 4)|author=Bill Chambers|date=2000|publisher=FilmFreakCentral.net|page=4|accessdate=March 23, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810072318/http://filmfreakcentral.net/notes/wminterview4.htm|archivedate=August 10, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Jay Jones|first1=Brian|title=George Lucas: A Life|date=2016|publisher=Hachette|isbn=9780316257459|page=162|url=https://books.google.cl/books?id=8rAmDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT162|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nR2-D2 stands for Second Generation Robotic Droid Series-2, according to a ''Star Wars'' encyclopedia published after the release of the film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artifintell.weebly.com/r2-d2.html|title=R2-D2|website=AI - Artificial Intelligence!}}</ref>\n[[Tony Dyson]], owner of the [[special effect]]s studio The White Horse Toy Company, was commissioned by special effects supervisor Brian Johnson to fabricate the revised mechanical design for the Empire Strikes Back, making several units operated by remote control.

While Luke cleans the sand out of R2-D2's gears, he discovers a fragment of Leia's message, and removes the droid's restraining bolt to see more; once free of the bolt, R2 claims to have no knowledge of the message. That night, R2-D2 leaves the farm to seek out Obi-Wan. When Owen and Beru are killed by [[Imperial stormtrooper]]s, Luke is forced to leave Tatooine with Obi-Wan, [[Han Solo]] ([[Harrison Ford]]), and [[Chewbacca]] ([[Peter Mayhew]]) on board the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' to deliver R2-D2 to the [[Rebel Alliance]]. On their arrival at Alderaan's co-ordinates, they are pulled in by the Death Star's [[tractor beam]] and are forced to land, but eventually rescue Princess Leia. After Vader kills Obi-Wan, the rest of the group escapes and delivers the Death Star plans to the Rebel Alliance. R2 later serves as Luke's droid during the [[Battle of Yavin|attack on the station]]. R2-D2 is severely damaged during the battle, but is repaired before the ceremony at the end of the film.\n\n=====''Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back''=====\nIn ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', R2-D2 accompanies Luke to [[Dagobah]], and later to [[Bespin|Cloud City]], where he helps to rescue and repair a heavily damaged C-3PO and to override city security computers. He also manages to reactivate the ''Millennium Falcon''{{'}}s hyperdrive, resulting in a last-minute escape from Imperial forces.\n\n=====''Episode VI: Return of the Jedi''=====\nIn ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', R2-D2 plays a critical role in rescuing Luke, Leia, and Han from [[Jabba the Hutt]]. He later joins the Rebel strike team on [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]]. He is badly damaged during the battle between the Imperial troops and the Rebels, but is repaired in time for the celebration marking the second Death Star's destruction and the fall of the Empire.\n\n====Prequel trilogy====\n=====''Episode I: The Phantom Menace''=====\nIn ''[[Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'', set 32 years before ''A New Hope'', R2-D2 is portrayed as belonging to the [[Naboo]] defense forces, one of four astromech droids deployed for repair duty on Queen [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]]'s ([[Natalie Portman]]) [[starship]] as it attempts to get past the [[Trade Federation]] blockade. The sole survivor of the four, R2-D2 becomes part of [[Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]]'s ([[Liam Neeson]]) party on [[Tatooine]] and meets [[C-3PO]] and [[Anakin Skywalker]] ([[Jake Lloyd]]). Later still, he serves as the astromech droid for Anakin's [[Military spacecraft in fiction|starfighter]] during the Battle of Naboo.\n\n=====''Episode II: Attack of the Clones''=====\nIn ''[[Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]'', set 10 years after ''The Phantom Menace'', R2-D2 again serves Anakin ([[Hayden Christensen]]) and Obi-Wan ([[Ewan McGregor]]). He accompanies Anakin and Padm\u00e9 to Naboo, and then to Tatooine when Anakin tries to rescue his mother [[Shmi Skywalker|Shmi]] ([[Pernilla August]]). Here, he is reunited with C-3PO, and the two get into various misadventures on Geonosis. He and C-3PO are later witnesses to Anakin and Padm\u00e9's secret wedding.\n\n=====''Episode III: Revenge of the Sith''=====\nIn ''[[Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith]]'', R2-D2 helps Anakin and Obi-Wan in their mission to rescue Chancellor [[Palpatine]] ([[Ian McDiarmid]]) from [[Count Dooku]]'s ([[Christopher Lee]]) capital ship, the ''Invisible Hand''. He is attacked by battle droids, but defeats them through ingenious tactics. After Anakin falls to the [[dark side (Star Wars)|dark side]] of [[the Force]] and becomes [[Darth Vader]], he takes R2-D2 with him when he goes to assassinate the Separatist council, but tells him to stay with the ship. After the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] is established at the end of the film, C-3PO's memory is erased to keep the knowledge of the locations of Vader and Padm\u00e9\u2019s newborn children, Luke and Leia, a secret from their father. However, R2-D2's memory isn't wiped; as a result, R2-D2 is the only surviving character at the end of ''Return of the Jedi'' who knows the entire story of the [[Skywalker family]]. Both R2-D2 and C-3PO end up in the possession of Captain [[Raymus Antilles]] ([[Rohan Nichol]]) onboard the ''Tantive IV''.\n\n====Sequel trilogy====\n=====''Episode VII: The Force Awakens''=====\nIn ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'', set approximately 30 years after ''Return of the Jedi'', R2-D2 is revealed to be kept in storage at the [[Resistance (Star Wars)|Resistance]] base on the planet [[D'Qar]], having put himself in a low-power mode after Luke Skywalker's disappearance. He later awakens and reveals Luke's location by combining map data stored in his memory with that of the droid [[BB-8]]. He then travels with [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] ([[Daisy Ridley]]) and Chewbacca to the planet highlighted on the map, where they find Luke in self-imposed exile. In the credits, Kenny Baker was credited as 'R2-D2 consultant,' while Jimmy Vee provided an uncredited portrayal in some scenes.\n\n=====''Episode VIII: The Last Jedi''=====\nR2-D2 appeared in ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi]]'', with actor Jimmy Vee taking over the role from Kenny Baker, who retired from the role due to his age and health.

In the 19th century, the age of [[colonialism]] was at its height and the great [[Chinese diaspora]] began. Many colonies lacked a large pool of laborers.  Meanwhile, in the provinces of [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]] in China, there was a surge in emigration as a result of the poverty and ruin caused by the [[Taiping rebellion]].<ref>The Story of California From the Earliest Days to the Present, by Henry K.

Many Hokkien chose to work in Southeast Asia (where they had earlier links starting from the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] era), as did the Cantonese. The area of Taishan, in Guangdong province was the source for many of the economic migrants.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} San Francisco and California was an early American destination in the mid 1800s because of the California Gold Rush. Many settled in San Francisco forming one of the earliest (or earliest?;reference?) Chinatowns. For the countries in North America and Australasia, great numbers of laborers were also needed in the dangerous tasks of [[gold mining]] and [[railway]] construction.  Widespread famine in Guangdong impelled many Cantonese to work in these countries to improve the living conditions of their relatives. Some overseas Chinese were sold{{By whom|date=July 2010}} to [[South America]] during the [[Punti-Hakka Clan Wars]] (1855\u20131867) in the [[Pearl River Delta]] in Guangdong.

Moreover, the [[average height]] of [[Southern Chinese]] used to be relatively stable at around 161\u2013164&nbsp;cm for males. Another important fact is that the height of Chinese emigrants varied depending on the location they have chosen.

Many of these emigrants who entered Western countries were themselves overseas Chinese, particularly from the 1950s to the 1980s, a period during which the PRC placed severe restrictions on the movement of its citizens. In 1984, Britain agreed to transfer the sovereignty of [[Hong Kong]] to the PRC; this triggered another wave of migration to the United Kingdom (mainly England), Australia, Canada, US, South America, Europe and other parts of the world.  The [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] further accelerated the migration.  The wave calmed after Hong Kong's transfer of [[sovereignty]] in 1997. In addition, many citizens of Hong Kong hold citizenships or have current visas in other countries so if the need arises, they can leave Hong Kong at short notice.  In fact, after the Tiananmen Square incident, the lines for immigration visas increased at every consulate in Hong Kong.{{Citation needed|reason=the preceding paragraph is entirely devoid of references|date=June 2018}}\n\nIn recent years, the People's Republic of China has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations.

Since the 1860s, most Chinese immigrants of the contemporary [[Chinese Filipino]]s have come from Fujian and thus form the bulk of the contemporary mixed and unmixed Chinese Filipinos and Filipinos of partial Chinese ancestry. Older generations have retained Chinese traditions and the use of [[Philippine Hokkien]] ([[Southern Min|Min Nan]]), while the current majority of younger generations largely communicate in [[Philippine English|English]], [[Filipino language|Filipino]] and other [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]] and have largely layered facets of both Western and Filipino culture onto their Chinese cultural background.\n\n[[File:East Coast Road 3, Mar 06.JPG|thumb|right|Since their early migration, many of the overseas Chinese have adopted local culture, especially in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand with large [[Peranakan]] community.

There are also great similarities between Vietnamese and Chinese traditions such as the use Lunar New Year, philosophy such as [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and ancestor worship; leads to some [[Hoa people|Hoa]] people adopt easily to Vietnamese culture, however many Hoa still prefer to maintain Chinese cultural background. The official census from 2009 accounted the Hoa population at some 823,000 individuals and ranked 6th in terms of its population size. 70% of the Hoa live in cities and towns, mostly in Ho Chi Minh city while the rests live in the southern provinces.<ref name=\"GSO2009\" />\n\nOn the other hand, in Malaysia, Singapore, and [[Brunei]], the ethnic Chinese have maintained a distinct communal identity.\n\nIn [[East Timor]], a large fraction of Chinese are of [[Hakka people#East Timor|Hakka descent]].\n\nIn Western countries, the overseas Chinese generally use romanised versions of their Chinese names, and the use of local first names is also common.\n\n===Discrimination===\n{{See also|Sinophobia}}\n\nOverseas Chinese have often experienced hostility and [[discrimination]].\n\nIn countries with small ethnic Chinese minorities, the [[economic disparity]] can be remarkable. For example, in 1998, ethnic Chinese made up just 1% of the population of the [[Philippines]] and 4% of the population in [[Indonesia]], but have wide influence in the Philippine and Indonesian private economies.<ref>Amy Chua, \"World on Fire\", 2003, Doubleday, pp. 3, 43.</ref> The book ''[[World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability|World on Fire]]'', describing the Chinese as a \"market-[[dominant minority]]\", notes that \"Chinese market dominance and intense resentment amongst the indigenous majority is characteristic of virtually every country in Southeast Asia except Thailand and Singapore\".<ref>Amy Chua, \"World on Fire\", 2003, Doubleday, p. 61.</ref> Chinese market dominance is present in Thailand and the Philippines, but is noted for its lack of resentment, while Singapore is majority ethnic Chinese. Widespread violent anti-Chinese sentiment spread across Southeast Asia, mostly occur in Malaysia and Indonesia, but not very much in Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines.\n\nThis asymmetrical economic position has incited anti-Chinese sentiment among the poorer majorities. Sometimes the anti-Chinese attitudes turn violent, such as the [[13 May Incident]] in Malaysia in 1969 and the [[Jakarta riots of May 1998]] in Indonesia, in which more than 2,000 people died, mostly rioters burned to death in a shopping mall.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displayStory.cfm?story_id=4323219 Malaysia's race rules].

In Malaysia, ethnic Chinese tend to support equal and meritocratic treatment on the expectation that they would not be discriminated against in the resulting competition for government contracts, university places, etc., whereas many \"[[Bumiputra]]\" (\"native sons\") [[Malaysian Malay|Malays]] oppose this on the grounds that their group needs such protections in order to retain their patrimony. The question of to what extent ethnic Malays, Chinese, or others are \"native\" to Malaysia is a sensitive political one.

In the 19th century, the age of [[colonialism]] was at its height and the great [[Chinese diaspora]] began. Many colonies lacked a large pool of laborers.  Meanwhile, in the provinces of [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]] in China, there was a surge in emigration as a result of the poverty and ruin caused by the [[Taiping rebellion]].<ref>The Story of California From the Earliest Days to the Present, by Henry K.

Many Hokkien chose to work in Southeast Asia (where they had earlier links starting from the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] era), as did the Cantonese. The area of Taishan, in Guangdong province was the source for many of the economic migrants.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} San Francisco and California was an early American destination in the mid 1800s because of the California Gold Rush. Many settled in San Francisco forming one of the earliest (or earliest?;reference?) Chinatowns. For the countries in North America and Australasia, great numbers of laborers were also needed in the dangerous tasks of [[gold mining]] and [[railway]] construction.  Widespread famine in Guangdong impelled many Cantonese to work in these countries to improve the living conditions of their relatives. Some overseas Chinese were sold{{By whom|date=July 2010}} to [[South America]] during the [[Punti-Hakka Clan Wars]] (1855\u20131867) in the [[Pearl River Delta]] in Guangdong.

Moreover, the [[average height]] of [[Southern Chinese]] used to be relatively stable at around 161\u2013164&nbsp;cm for males. Another important fact is that the height of Chinese emigrants varied depending on the location they have chosen.

Many of these emigrants who entered Western countries were themselves overseas Chinese, particularly from the 1950s to the 1980s, a period during which the PRC placed severe restrictions on the movement of its citizens. In 1984, Britain agreed to transfer the sovereignty of [[Hong Kong]] to the PRC; this triggered another wave of migration to the United Kingdom (mainly England), Australia, Canada, US, South America, Europe and other parts of the world.  The [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] further accelerated the migration.  The wave calmed after Hong Kong's transfer of [[sovereignty]] in 1997. In addition, many citizens of Hong Kong hold citizenships or have current visas in other countries so if the need arises, they can leave Hong Kong at short notice.  In fact, after the Tiananmen Square incident, the lines for immigration visas increased at every consulate in Hong Kong.{{Citation needed|reason=the preceding paragraph is entirely devoid of references|date=June 2018}}\n\nIn recent years, the People's Republic of China has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations.

Since the 1860s, most Chinese immigrants of the contemporary [[Chinese Filipino]]s have come from Fujian and thus form the bulk of the contemporary mixed and unmixed Chinese Filipinos and Filipinos of partial Chinese ancestry.

There are also great similarities between Vietnamese and Chinese traditions such as the use Lunar New Year, philosophy such as [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and ancestor worship; leads to some [[Hoa people|Hoa]] people adopt easily to Vietnamese culture, however many Hoa still prefer to maintain Chinese cultural background. The official census from 2009 accounted the Hoa population at some 823,000 individuals and ranked 6th in terms of its population size. 70% of the Hoa live in cities and towns, mostly in Ho Chi Minh city while the rests live in the southern provinces.<ref name=\"GSO2009\" />\n\nOn the other hand, in Malaysia, Singapore, and [[Brunei]], the ethnic Chinese have maintained a distinct communal identity.\n\nIn [[East Timor]], a large fraction of Chinese are of [[Hakka people#East Timor|Hakka descent]].\n\nIn Western countries, the overseas Chinese generally use romanised versions of their Chinese names, and the use of local first names is also common.\n\n===Discrimination===\n{{See also|Sinophobia}}\n\nOverseas Chinese have often experienced hostility and [[discrimination]].\n\nIn countries with small ethnic Chinese minorities, the [[economic disparity]] can be remarkable. For example, in 1998, ethnic Chinese made up just 1% of the population of the [[Philippines]] and 4% of the population in [[Indonesia]], but have wide influence in the Philippine and Indonesian private economies.<ref>Amy Chua, \"World on Fire\", 2003, Doubleday, pp. 3, 43.</ref> The book ''[[World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability|World on Fire]]'', describing the Chinese as a \"market-[[dominant minority]]\", notes that \"Chinese market dominance and intense resentment amongst the indigenous majority is characteristic of virtually every country in Southeast Asia except Thailand and Singapore\".<ref>Amy Chua, \"World on Fire\", 2003, Doubleday, p. 61.</ref> Chinese market dominance is present in Thailand and the Philippines, but is noted for its lack of resentment, while Singapore is majority ethnic Chinese. Widespread violent anti-Chinese sentiment spread across Southeast Asia, mostly occur in Malaysia and Indonesia, but not very much in Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines.\n\nThis asymmetrical economic position has incited anti-Chinese sentiment among the poorer majorities. Sometimes the anti-Chinese attitudes turn violent, such as the [[13 May Incident]] in Malaysia in 1969 and the [[Jakarta riots of May 1998]] in Indonesia, in which more than 2,000 people died, mostly rioters burned to death in a shopping mall.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displayStory.cfm?story_id=4323219 Malaysia's race rules].

In Malaysia, ethnic Chinese tend to support equal and meritocratic treatment on the expectation that they would not be discriminated against in the resulting competition for government contracts, university places, etc., whereas many \"[[Bumiputra]]\" (\"native sons\") [[Malaysian Malay|Malays]] oppose this on the grounds that their group needs such protections in order to retain their patrimony. The question of to what extent ethnic Malays, Chinese, or others are \"native\" to Malaysia is a sensitive political one.

The charges originate from a conference at the [[Technical University of Berlin]], organized by a student society allegedly affiliated with Hizb ut-Tahrir. The furor was caused because the conference was attended by members of the [[neo-Nazi]] [[National Democratic Party of Germany]] (NPD), which allegedly sparked fears of an alliance between neo-Nazi groups and Islamists. Schily banned Hizb ut-Tahrir three months later, for going \"against the concept of international understanding\" contained in the German constitution, a charge that has been used in the past against neo-Nazi groups. The group's representative in Germany Assem Shaker responded that the group was not anti-Semitic. He added, \"We do not call to kill Jews.

The organization appealed the ban to the European Court, stating in 2008:<blockquote>\"We note that the German courts did not uphold any of the German Interior Ministries accusations of anti-Semitism against HT, however, they have now relied on an obscure principle of the 'idea of international understanding' to ban all of our activities (speeches, study circles, articles, vigils, political meetings, books, magazines, and debates).\"<ref>[http://www.hizb.org.uk/hizb/press-centre/press-release/hizb-ut-tahrir-challenges-german-ban-at-european-court.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601184449/http://www.hizb.org.uk/hizb/press-centre/press-release/hizb-ut-tahrir-challenges-german-ban-at-european-court.html|date=1 June 2010}}</ref></blockquote>\nAs of 2004 HT \"continues to recruit and raise funds\" in Germany<ref name=ZBHTIPI2004:40>[[#ZBHTIPI2004|Baran, ''Hizb ut-Tahrir: Islam\u2019s Political Insurgency'', 2004]]:40</ref> but \"any organizational structures\" there \"remain hidden\", and HT activists in the country behave \"in a highly secretive manner\", according to Zeynon Baran.<ref name=ZBHTIPI2004:39>[[#ZBHTIPI2004|Baran, ''Hizb ut-Tahrir: Islam\u2019s Political Insurgency'', 2004]]:39</ref>\n\n====Netherlands====\n{{See also|Islam in the Netherlands}}\n\nHizb ut-Tahrir [[Indonesia]] spokesperson, [[Ismail Yusanto]] said to [[Nikolaos van Dam]], the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] ambassador for Indonesia that the [[Dutch government]] is responsible for the [[Fitna (film)|Fitna]] of Geert Wilders and declared ''[[aslim taslam]]'' (submit to Islam).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hizbut-tahrir.or.id/2008/04/04/dutch-government-must-be-held-accountable-over-fitna/|title=Dutch Government must be held accountable over FITNA|date=4 April 2008|publisher=Hisb ut-Tahrir Indonesia|accessdate=8 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Russia====\n{{See also|Islam in Russia}}\n\nIn the late 1990, the former president of Uzbekistan [[Islam Karimov]] launched an extensive crackdown on Islamic organizations, such as HT, forcing their members to flee abroad.

The charges originate from a conference at the [[Technical University of Berlin]], organized by a student society allegedly affiliated with Hizb ut-Tahrir. The furor was caused because the conference was attended by members of the [[neo-Nazi]] [[National Democratic Party of Germany]] (NPD), which allegedly sparked fears of an alliance between neo-Nazi groups and Islamists. Schily banned Hizb ut-Tahrir three months later, for going \"against the concept of international understanding\" contained in the German constitution, a charge that has been used in the past against neo-Nazi groups. The group's representative in Germany Assem Shaker responded that the group was not anti-Semitic. He added, \"We do not call to kill Jews. Our call is addressed to the Muslim people to defend themselves against the Zionist aggression in Palestine. And they have the right to do so.\"<ref name=\"Lambroschini\"/>\n\nThe anti-semitism charges were not upheld in German courts, but the ban was continued based on the state's finding that the group's activity opposed the idea of understanding among nations and endorsed force as a means towards its political aims. A lawsuit against the ban was rejected on 23 January 2006 by the Federal Administrative Court in Germany.  The organization appealed the ban to the European Court, stating in 2008:<blockquote>\"We note that the German courts did not uphold any of the German Interior Ministries accusations of anti-Semitism against HT, however, they have now relied on an obscure principle of the 'idea of international understanding' to ban all of our activities (speeches, study circles, articles, vigils, political meetings, books, magazines, and debates).\"<ref>[http://www.hizb.org.uk/hizb/press-centre/press-release/hizb-ut-tahrir-challenges-german-ban-at-european-court.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601184449/http://www.hizb.org.uk/hizb/press-centre/press-release/hizb-ut-tahrir-challenges-german-ban-at-european-court.html|date=1 June 2010}}</ref></blockquote>\nAs of 2004 HT \"continues to recruit and raise funds\" in Germany<ref name=ZBHTIPI2004:40>[[#ZBHTIPI2004|Baran, ''Hizb ut-Tahrir: Islam\u2019s Political Insurgency'', 2004]]:40</ref> but \"any organizational structures\" there \"remain hidden\", and HT activists in the country behave \"in a highly secretive manner\", according to Zeynon Baran.<ref name=ZBHTIPI2004:39>[[#ZBHTIPI2004|Baran, ''Hizb ut-Tahrir: Islam\u2019s Political Insurgency'', 2004]]:39</ref>\n\n====Netherlands====\n{{See also|Islam in the Netherlands}}\n\nHizb ut-Tahrir [[Indonesia]] spokesperson, [[Ismail Yusanto]] said to [[Nikolaos van Dam]], the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] ambassador for Indonesia that the [[Dutch government]] is responsible for the [[Fitna (film)|Fitna]] of Geert Wilders and declared ''[[aslim taslam]]'' (submit to Islam).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hizbut-tahrir.or.id/2008/04/04/dutch-government-must-be-held-accountable-over-fitna/|title=Dutch Government must be held accountable over FITNA|date=4 April 2008|publisher=Hisb ut-Tahrir Indonesia|accessdate=8 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Russia====\n{{See also|Islam in Russia}}\n\nIn the late 1990, the former president of Uzbekistan [[Islam Karimov]] launched an extensive crackdown on Islamic organizations, such as HT, forcing their members to flee abroad. Russia being the top destination for the labour migrants from Uzbekistan accommodated a significant number of silent HT adepts from Uzbekistan. Their first Russian HT cells emerged in 1999 in [[Nizhnevartovsk]], a city in the oil-rich region of [[Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug|Yugra]]. Later they appeared also in [[Dagestan]], [[North Caucasus economic region|North Caucasus]], and in [[Tatarstan]], [[Volga region]]. The adepts held gatherings on the private premises recruiting newcomers among both local, including non-Muslim, and migrant populations, denouncing the Russian rule and praising the armed combat against the non-Islamic governments globally.

{"title_page": "Digital subscriber line", "text_new": "{{short description|Series of transfer standards in data transmission}}\n\n{{Redirect|DSL}}\n\n{{IPstack}}\n\n'''Digital subscriber line''' ('''DSL'''; originally '''digital subscriber loop''') is a family of technologies that are used to transmit [[digital data]] over [[telephone line]]s. In telecommunications marketing, the term DSL is widely understood to mean [[asymmetric digital subscriber line]] (ADSL), the most commonly installed DSL technology, for [[Internet access]]. \n\nDSL service can be delivered simultaneously with [[plain old telephone service|wired telephone service]] on the same telephone line since DSL uses higher [[frequency band]]s for data. On the customer premises, a [[DSL filter]] on each non-DSL outlet blocks any high-frequency interference to enable simultaneous use of the voice and DSL services.\n\nThe [[bit rate]] of consumer DSL services typically ranges from 256&nbsp;kbit/s to over 100&nbsp;Mbit/s in the direction to the customer ([[downstream (networking)|downstream]]), depending on DSL technology, line conditions, and service-level implementation. Bit rates of 1&nbsp;[[Gbit/s]] have been reached.<ref>[https://gizmodo.com/the-next-generation-of-dsl-can-pump-1gbps-through-coppe-1484256467 The Next Generation of DSL Can Pump 1Gbps Through Copper Phone Lines], Gizmodo, 18 December 2013, Andrew Tarantola</ref><!--see [[G.fast]] for additional support--> \n\nIn ADSL, the data throughput in the [[upstream (networking)|upstream]] direction (the direction to the service provider) is lower, hence the designation of ''asymmetric'' service. In [[symmetric digital subscriber line]] (SDSL) services, the downstream and upstream data rates are equal. Researchers at [[Bell Labs]] have reached speeds over 1&nbsp;Gbit/s for symmetrical broadband access services using traditional copper telephone lines, though such speeds have not yet been deployed elsewhere.<ref>[http://phys.org/news/2014-07-alcatel-lucent-broadband-copper.html Alcatel-Lucent sets broadband speed record using copper], Phys.org, 10 July 2014, Nancy Owano</ref><ref>[https://www.engadget.com/2014/07/10/alcatel-lucent-broadband-copper-world-record/ Researchers get record broadband speeds out of old-school copper wire], Engadget, 10 July 2014, Matt Brian</ref>\n\n==History==\nIt was originally thought that it was not possible to operate a conventional phone line beyond low-speed limits (typically under 9600 bit/s). In the 1950s, ordinary twisted-pair telephone cable often carried four megahertz (MHz) television signals between studios, suggesting that such lines would allow transmitting many megabits per second. One such circuit in the United Kingdom ran some {{convert|10|mi|km}} between the [[BBC]] studios in [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] and the [[Pontop Pike transmitting station]]. However, these cables had other impairments besides [[Gaussian noise]], preventing such rates from becoming practical in the field. The 1980s saw the development of techniques for [[broadband]] communications that allowed the limit to be greatly extended. A patent was filed in 1979 for the use of existing telephone wires for both telephones and data terminals that were connected to a remote computer via a digital data carrier system.<ref>{{cite web |title= Audio and full duplex digital data carrier system |author1=John E.

Employees at Bellcore (now [[Telcordia Technologies]]) developed [[asymmetric digital subscriber line]] (ADSL) by placing wide-band digital signals at frequencies above the existing [[baseband]] analog voice signal carried on conventional [[twisted pair]] cabling between [[telephone exchange]]s and customers.<ref>{{cite web |title= EE535 Homework 3 |author= Ronald Shamus |publisher= Worcester Polytechnic Institute |url= http://www.ece.wpi.edu/courses/ee535/hwk96/hwk3cd96/rshamus/rshamus.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20000412185056/http://www.ece.wpi.edu/courses/ee535/hwk96/hwk3cd96/rshamus/rshamus.html |url-status= dead |archive-date= April 12, 2000 |accessdate= September 15, 2011 }}</ref> A patent was filed in 1988.<ref>{{cite patent |title=Method and apparatus for wideband transmission of digital signals between, for example, a telephone central office and customer premises |author1=Richard D.

ADSL supports two modes of transport: fast channel and [[Bit-interleaving|interleaved channel]]. Fast channel is preferred for [[streaming multimedia]], where an occasional ''dropped [[bit]]'' is acceptable, but lags are less so. Interleaved channel works better for file transfers, where the delivered data must be error-free but latency (time delay) incurred by the retransmission of error-containing packets is acceptable.\n\nConsumer-oriented ADSL was designed to operate on existing lines already conditioned for [[Basic Rate Interface]] ISDN services. Engineers developed high speed DSL facilities such as [[high bit rate digital subscriber line]] (HDSL) and [[symmetric digital subscriber line]] (SDSL) to provision traditional [[Digital Signal 1]] (DS1) services over standard copper pair facilities.\n\nOlder ADSL standards delivered 8&nbsp;[[Mbit/s]] to the customer over about {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} of [[unshielded twisted pair|unshielded twisted-pair]] copper wire. Newer variants improved these rates. Distances greater than {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} significantly reduce the [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] usable on the wires, thus reducing the data rate. But [[ADSL loop extender]]s increase these distances by repeating the signal, allowing the LEC to deliver DSL speeds to any distance.<ref>[http://www.strowger.com Infinite Reach ADSL]</ref>\n\n[[File:Lantiq XWAY VRX288 V1.1.png|thumb|DSL [[System on a chip|SoC]]]]\nUntil the late 1990s, the cost of [[digital signal processor]]s for DSL was prohibitive. All types of DSL employ highly complex [[digital signal processing]] algorithms to overcome the inherent limitations of the existing [[twisted pair]] wires. Due to the advancements of [[very-large-scale integration]] (VLSI) technology, the cost of the equipment associated with a DSL deployment lowered significantly. The two main pieces of equipment are a [[digital subscriber line access multiplexer]] (DSLAM) at one end and a [[DSL modem]] at the other end.\n\nA DSL connection can be deployed over existing cable. Such deployment, even including equipment, is much cheaper than installing a new, high-bandwidth [[fiber-optic]] cable over the same route and distance. This is true both for ADSL and SDSL variations. The commercial success of DSL and similar technologies largely reflects the advances made in electronics over the decades that have increased performance and reduced costs even while digging trenches in the ground for new cables (copper or fiber optic) remains expensive.\n\nThese advantages made ADSL a better proposition for customers requiring [[Internet access]] than metered dial up, while also allowing voice calls to be received at the same time as a data connection. Telephone companies were also under pressure to move to ADSL owing to competition from cable companies, which use [[DOCSIS cable modem]] technology to achieve similar speeds. Demand for high bandwidth applications, such as video and file sharing, also contributed to the popularity of  ADSL technology.\n\nEarly DSL service required a dedicated [[dry loop]], but when the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) required [[incumbent local exchange carrier]]s (ILECs) to lease their lines to competing DSL service providers, shared-line DSL became available. Also known as DSL over [[unbundled network element]], this unbundling of services allows a single subscriber to receive two separate services from two separate providers on one cable pair. The DSL service provider's equipment is co-located in the same [[telephone exchange]] as that of the ILEC supplying the customer's pre-existing voice service. The subscriber's circuit is rewired to interface with hardware supplied by the ILEC which combines a DSL frequency and POTS signals on a single copper pair.\n\nBy 2012, some carriers in the United States reported that DSL remote terminals with fiber [[backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul]] were replacing older ADSL systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gigaom.com/2012/04/24/the-dsl-death-march-continues/ |title=DSL Death March Continues |author=Om Malik |date=Apr 24, 2012 |website=Gigaom.com |access-date=2019-10-21}}</ref>\n\n==Operation==\nTelephones are connected to the [[telephone exchange]] via a [[local loop]], which is a physical pair of wires. The local loop was originally intended mostly for the transmission of speech, encompassing an audio frequency range of 300 to 3400 [[hertz]] ([[commercial bandwidth]]). However, as long-distance [[Trunking|trunk]]s were gradually converted from analog to digital operation, the idea of being able to pass data through the local loop (by utilizing frequencies above the voiceband) took hold, ultimately leading to DSL.\n\nThe [[local loop]] connecting the telephone exchange to most subscribers has the capability of carrying frequencies well beyond the 3400&nbsp;kHz upper limit of [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]]. Depending on the length and quality of the loop, the upper limit can be tens of megahertz. DSL takes advantage of this unused [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the local loop by creating 4312.5&nbsp;Hz wide channels starting between 10 and 100&nbsp;kHz, depending on how the system is configured. Allocation of channels continues to higher frequencies (up to 1.1&nbsp;MHz for ADSL) until new channels are deemed unusable. Each channel is evaluated for usability in much the same way an [[analog modem]] would on a POTS connection. More usable channels equate to more available bandwidth, which is why distance and line quality are a factor (the higher frequencies used by DSL travel only short distances). \n\nThe pool of usable channels is then split into two different frequency bands for [[upstream (networking)|upstream]] and [[downstream (networking)|downstream]] traffic, based on a preconfigured ratio. This segregation reduces interference. Once the channel groups have been established, the individual [[Communication channel|channel]]s are [[Channel bonding|bonded]] into a pair of virtual circuits, one in each direction. Like analog modems, DSL [[transceiver]]s constantly monitor the quality of each channel and will add or remove them from service depending on whether they are usable. Once upstream and downstream circuits are established, a [[subscriber]] can connect to a service such as an [[Internet service provider]] or other network services, like a corporate [[MPLS]] network.\n\nThe underlying technology of transport across DSL facilities uses [[modulation]] of high-frequency [[carrier wave]]s, an analog signal transmission. A DSL circuit terminates at each end in a [[modem]] which modulates patterns of [[Binary digit|bits]] into certain high-frequency impulses for transmission to the opposing modem. Signals received from the far-end modem are demodulated to yield a corresponding bit pattern that the modem passes on, in digital form, to its interfaced equipment, such as a computer, router, switch, etc.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\nUnlike traditional dial-up modems, which modulate bits into signals in the 300\u20133400&nbsp;Hz baseband (voice service), DSL modems modulate frequencies from 4000&nbsp;Hz to as high as 4&nbsp;MHz. This frequency band separation enables DSL service and [[plain old telephone service]] (POTS) to coexist on the same copper pair facility. On the subscriber's end of the circuit, inline [[low-pass]] [[DSL filter]]s (splitters) are installed on each telephone to filter the high-frequency signals that would otherwise be heard as hiss, but pass voice frequencies. Conversely, [[high-pass filter]]s already incorporated in the circuitry of DSL modems filter out voice frequencies. Although ADSL and RADSL modulations do not use the voice-frequency band, nonlinear elements in the phone could otherwise generate audible intermodulation and may impair the operation of the data modem in the absence of high-pass filters.\n[[File:T-DSL Modem.jpg|thumb|right|A DSL modem]]\n\nBecause DSL operates above the 3.4&nbsp;kHz voice limit, it cannot pass through a [[Loading coil|load coil]], which is an inductive coil that is designed to counteract loss caused by shunt capacitance (capacitance between the two wires of the twisted pair). Load coils are commonly set at regular intervals in lines placed only for POTS. A DSL signal cannot pass through a properly installed and working load coil, while voice service cannot be maintained past a certain distance without such coils. Therefore, some areas that are within range for DSL service are disqualified from eligibility because of load coil placement. Because of this, phone companies endeavor to remove load coils on copper loops that can operate without them, and by conditioning other lines to avoid them through the use of fiber to the neighborhood or node ([[FTTN]]).\n\nMost residential and small-office DSL implementations reserve low frequencies for POTS, so that (with suitable filters and/or splitters) the existing voice service continues to operate independently of the DSL service. Thus POTS-based communications, including [[Fax|fax machines]] and analog modems, can share the wires with DSL. Only one DSL modem can use the [[subscriber line]] at a time. The standard way to let multiple computers share a DSL connection uses a [[Router (computing)|router]] that establishes a connection between the DSL modem and a local [[Ethernet]], [[Power line communication|Powerline]], or [[Wi-Fi]] network on the customer's premises.\n\nThe theoretical foundations of DSL, like much of [[communication]] technology, can be traced back to [[Claude Shannon]]'s seminal 1948 paper: ''[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]''. Generally, higher bit rate transmissions require a wider frequency band, though the ratio of [[bit rate]] to [[symbol rate]] and thus to bandwidth are not linear due to significant innovations in [[digital signal processing]] and [[Digital modulation#Digital modulation methods|digital modulation methods]].\n\n===Naked DSL===\n{{main|Naked DSL}}\nA [[naked DSL]] (also known as standalone or [[dry loop]] DSL) is a way of providing DSL services without a [[PSTN]] ([[analog signal|analogue]] [[telephony]]) service. It is useful when the customer does not need the traditional [[telephony]] voice service because voice service is received either on top of the DSL services (usually [[Voice over IP|VoIP]]) or through another network ([[mobile telephony]]).\n\nIt is also commonly called a UNE (for [[unbundled network element]]) in the United States; in Australia it is known as a ULL (unconditioned local loop);<ref>[http://whirlpool.net.au/wiki/ull ULL (unconditioned local loop)].

The telephone company connects the other end of the line to a [[DSLAM]], which concentrates a large number of individual DSL connections into a single box. The location of the DSLAM depends on the telco, but it cannot be located too far from the user because of [[attenuation]] between     ( sexy mia khalifa    )    he DSLAM and the user's DSL modem. It is common for a few residential blocks to be connected to one DSLAM.\n\nThe accompanying figure is a schematic of a simple DSL connection (in blue). The right side shows a DSLAM residing in the telephone company's telephone exchange. The left side shows the customer premises equipment with an optional router. The router manages a local area network (LAN) which connects PCs and other local devices. With many service providers, the customer may opt for a modem which contains both a router and wireless access. This option (within the dashed bubble) often simplifies the connection.\n[[File:Dsl schematic.svg|thumb|center|600px|DSL Connection schematic]]\n\n[[File:Outdoor DSLAM.JPG|thumb|Example of a DSLAM from 2006]]\n\n===Exchange equipment===\nAt the exchange, a [[digital subscriber line access multiplexer]] (DSLAM) [[Electrical termination|terminate]]s the DSL circuits and aggregates them, where they are [[handoff|handed off]] to other networking transports. In the case of ADSL, the voice component is also separated at this step, either by a filter integrated in the DSLAM or by a specialized filtering equipment installed before it. The DSLAM terminates all connections and recovers the original digital information.\n\n===Customer equipment===\nThe customer end of the connection consists of a terminal adapter or \"[[DSL modem]]\". This converts data between the digital signals used by computers and the analog [[voltage]] signal of a suitable frequency range which is then applied to the phone line.\n[[File:Dsl modem schematic.svg|thumb|center|400px|DSL Modem schematic]]\n\nIn some DSL variations (for example, [[HDSL]]), the terminal adapter connects directly to the computer via a serial interface, using protocols such as [[ethernet]] or [[V.35 (recommendation)|V.35]]. In other cases (particularly ADSL), it is common for the customer equipment to be integrated with higher level functionality, such as routing, firewalling, or other application-specific hardware and software. In this case, the equipment is referred to as a gateway.\n\nMost DSL technologies require installation of appropriate filters to separate, or split, the DSL signal from the low-frequency voice signal. The separation can take place either at the [[demarcation point]], or with filters installed at the telephone outlets inside the customer premises. Each way has its practical and economic limitations.\n====DSL modem initialization====\nWhen the DSL modem powers up it goes through a series of steps to establish connections. The actual process varies from modem to modem but generally involves the following steps:\n# The DSL transceiver performs a self-test, including image load and activation.\n# The DSL transceiver then attempts to [[synchronize]] with the DSLAM. Data can only come into the computer when the DSLAM and the modem are synchronized. The synchronization process is relatively quick (in the range of seconds) but is very complex, involving extensive tests that allow both sides of the connection to optimize the performance for line characteristics including noise and error handling. External, or standalone modem units have an indicator labeled \"CD\", \"DSL\", or \"LINK\", which can be used to tell if the modem is synchronized. During synchronization the light flashes; when synchronized, the light stays lit, usually green.\n# If supported, the DSL transceiver establishes a [[gateway (telecommunications)|gateway]] internet connection.\n# The DSL transceiver establishes a connection with the router or computer. For residential variations of DSL, this is usually the [[Ethernet]] (RJ-45) port or a [[USB]] port; in rare models, a [[FireWire]] port is used. Older DSL modems sported a native ATM interface (usually, a 25&nbsp;Mbit/s [[serial interface]]). Also, some variations of DSL (such as SDSL) use synchronous serial connections.\n\nModern DSL [[gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]] often integrate routing and other functionality. Their initialization is very similar to a PC [[boot up]]. The system image is loaded from the [[flash memory|flash storage]]; the system boots, synchronizes the DSL connection and finally establishes the internet IP services and connection between the local network and the service provider, using protocols such as [[DHCP]] or [[PPPoE]]. According to ''Implementation and Applications of DSL Technology'' (2007), the PPPoE method far outweighed DHCP in terms of deployment on DSLs, and [[password authentication protocol|PAP]] was the predominant form of subscriber authentication used in such circumstances.<ref name=\"GoldenDedieu2007b\">{{cite book|author1=Philip Golden|author2=Herv\u00e9 Dedieu|author3=Krista S.

In a bridged configuration, the group of subscriber computers effectively connect into a single subnet. The earliest implementations used [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] to provide network details such as the [[IP address]] to the subscriber equipment, with [[authentication]] via [[MAC address]] or an assigned host name. Later implementations often use [[Point-to-Point Protocol]] (PPP) to authenticate with a user ID and password, and to provide network details ([[Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet]] (PPPoE) or [[Point-to-Point Protocol over ATM]] (PPPoA)).\n\n==Transmission modulation methods==\nTransmission methods vary by market, region, carrier, and equipment.\n* DMT: [[Discrete multitone modulation]], the most common kind, also known as OFDM ([[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing]])\n* [[TC-PAM]]: Trellis Coded Pulse Amplitude Modulation, used for [[HDSL2]] and [[SHDSL]]\n* CAP: [[Carrierless Amplitude Phase Modulation]] - deprecated in 1996 for ADSL, used for HDSL\n* 2B1Q: [[Two-binary, one-quaternary]], used for IDSL and HDSL\n\n==DSL technologies==\nDSL technologies (sometimes collectively summarized as '''xDSL''') include:\n*[[Symmetric digital subscriber line]] (SDSL), umbrella term for xDSL where the bitrate is equal in both directions.\n**[[ISDN digital subscriber line]] (IDSL), ISDN-based technology that provides a bitrate equivalent to two ISDN bearer and one data channel, 144&nbsp;kbit/s symmetric over one pair\n**[[High bit rate digital subscriber line]] (HDSL), ITU-T G.991.1, the first DSL technology that used a higher frequency spectrum than ISDN, 1,544&nbsp;kbit/s and 2,048&nbsp;kbit/s symmetric services, either on 2 or 3 pairs at 784&nbsp;kbit/s each, 2 pairs at 1,168&nbsp;kbit/s each, or one pair at 2,320&nbsp;kbit/s\n**[[High bit rate digital subscriber line 2|High bit rate digital subscriber line 2/4]] (HDSL2, HDSL4), ANSI, 1,544&nbsp;kbit/s symmetric over one pair (HDSL2) or two pairs (HDSL4)\n**[[Symmetric digital subscriber line]] (SDSL), specific proprietary technology, up to 1,544&nbsp;kbit/s symmetric over one pair\n**[[Single-pair high-speed digital subscriber line]] (G.SHDSL), ITU-T G.991.2, standardized successor of HDSL and proprietary SDSL, up to 5,696&nbsp;kbit/s per pair, up to four pairs\n*[[Asymmetric digital subscriber line]] (ADSL), umbrella term for xDSL where the bitrate is greater in one direction than the other.\n**[[ANSI T1.413 Issue 2]], up to 8&nbsp;Mbit/s and 1&nbsp;Mbit/s\n**[[G.992.1|G.dmt]], ITU-T G.992.1, up to 10&nbsp;Mbit/s and 1&nbsp;Mbit/s\n**[[G.992.2|G.lite]], ITU-T G.992.2, more noise and attenuation resistant than G.dmt, up to 1,536&nbsp;kbit/s and 512&nbsp;kbit/s\n**[[Asymmetric digital subscriber line 2]] (ADSL2), ITU-T G.992.3, up to 12&nbsp;Mbit/s and 3.5&nbsp;Mbit/s\n**[[Asymmetric digital subscriber line 2 plus]] (ADSL2+), ITU-T G.992.5, up to 24&nbsp;Mbit/s and 3.5&nbsp;Mbit/s\n**[[Very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line]] (VDSL), ITU-T G.993.1, up to 52&nbsp;Mbit/s and 16&nbsp;Mbit/s\n**[[Very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line 2]] (VDSL2), ITU-T G.993.2, an improved version of VDSL, compatible with ADSL2+, sum of both directions up to 200&nbsp;Mbit/s.

In telecommunications marketing, the term DSL is widely understood to mean [[asymmetric digital subscriber line]] (ADSL), the most commonly installed DSL technology, for [[Internet access]]. \n\nDSL service can be delivered simultaneously with [[plain old telephone service|wired telephone service]] on the same telephone line since DSL uses higher [[frequency band]]s for data. On the customer premises, a [[DSL filter]] on each non-DSL outlet blocks any high-frequency interference to enable simultaneous use of the voice and DSL services.\n\nThe [[bit rate]] of consumer DSL services typically ranges from 256&nbsp;kbit/s to over 100&nbsp;Mbit/s in the direction to the customer ([[downstream (networking)|downstream]]), depending on DSL technology, line conditions, and service-level implementation. Bit rates of 1&nbsp;[[Gbit/s]] have been reached.<ref>[https://gizmodo.com/the-next-generation-of-dsl-can-pump-1gbps-through-coppe-1484256467 The Next Generation of DSL Can Pump 1Gbps Through Copper Phone Lines], Gizmodo, 18 December 2013, Andrew Tarantola</ref><!--see [[G.fast]] for additional support--> \n\nIn ADSL, the data throughput in the [[upstream (networking)|upstream]] direction (the direction to the service provider) is lower, hence the designation of ''asymmetric'' service.

In the 1950s, ordinary twisted-pair telephone cable often carried four megahertz (MHz) television signals between studios, suggesting that such lines would allow transmitting many megabits per second. One such circuit in the United Kingdom ran some {{convert|10|mi|km}} between the [[BBC]] studios in [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] and the [[Pontop Pike transmitting station]]. However, these cables had other impairments besides [[Gaussian noise]], preventing such rates from becoming practical in the field. The 1980s saw the development of techniques for [[broadband]] communications that allowed the limit to be greatly extended. A patent was filed in 1979 for the use of existing telephone wires for both telephones and data terminals that were connected to a remote computer via a digital data carrier system.<ref>{{cite web |title= Audio and full duplex digital data carrier system |author1=John E.

ADSL supports two modes of transport: fast channel and [[Bit-interleaving|interleaved channel]]. Fast channel is preferred for [[streaming multimedia]], where an occasional ''dropped [[bit]]'' is acceptable, but lags are less so. Interleaved channel works better for file transfers, where the delivered data must be error-free but latency (time delay) incurred by the retransmission of error-containing packets is acceptable.\n\nConsumer-oriented ADSL was designed to operate on existing lines already conditioned for [[Basic Rate Interface]] ISDN services. Engineers developed high speed DSL facilities such as [[high bit rate digital subscriber line]] (HDSL) and [[symmetric digital subscriber line]] (SDSL) to provision traditional [[Digital Signal 1]] (DS1) services over standard copper pair facilities.\n\nOlder ADSL standards delivered 8&nbsp;[[Mbit/s]] to the customer over about {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} of [[unshielded twisted pair|unshielded twisted-pair]] copper wire. Newer variants improved these rates. Distances greater than {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} significantly reduce the [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] usable on the wires, thus reducing the data rate. But [[ADSL loop extender]]s increase these distances by repeating the signal, allowing the LEC to deliver DSL speeds to any distance.<ref>[http://www.strowger.com Infinite Reach ADSL]</ref>\n\n[[File:Lantiq XWAY VRX288 V1.1.png|thumb|DSL [[System on a chip|SoC]]]]\nUntil the late 1990s, the cost of [[digital signal processor]]s for DSL was prohibitive. All types of DSL employ highly complex [[digital signal processing]] algorithms to overcome the inherent limitations of the existing [[twisted pair]] wires. Due to the advancements of [[very-large-scale integration]] (VLSI) technology, the cost of the equipment associated with a DSL deployment lowered significantly. The two main pieces of equipment are a [[digital subscriber line access multiplexer]] (DSLAM) at one end and a [[DSL modem]] at the other end.\n\nA DSL connection can be deployed over existing cable. Such deployment, even including equipment, is much cheaper than installing a new, high-bandwidth [[fiber-optic]] cable over the same route and distance. This is true both for ADSL and SDSL variations. The commercial success of DSL and similar technologies largely reflects the advances made in electronics over the decades that have increased performance and reduced costs even while digging trenches in the ground for new cables (copper or fiber optic) remains expensive.\n\nThese advantages made ADSL a better proposition for customers requiring [[Internet access]] than metered dial up, while also allowing voice calls to be received at the same time as a data connection. Telephone companies were also under pressure to move to ADSL owing to competition from cable companies, which use [[DOCSIS cable modem]] technology to achieve similar speeds. Demand for high bandwidth applications, such as video and file sharing, also contributed to the popularity of  ADSL technology.\n\nEarly DSL service required a dedicated [[dry loop]], but when the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) required [[incumbent local exchange carrier]]s (ILECs) to lease their lines to competing DSL service providers, shared-line DSL became available. Also known as DSL over [[unbundled network element]], this unbundling of services allows a single subscriber to receive two separate services from two separate providers on one cable pair. The DSL service provider's equipment is co-located in the same [[telephone exchange]] as that of the ILEC supplying the customer's pre-existing voice service. The subscriber's circuit is rewired to interface with hardware supplied by the ILEC which combines a DSL frequency and POTS signals on a single copper pair.\n\nBy 2012, some carriers in the United States reported that DSL remote terminals with fiber [[backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul]] were replacing older ADSL systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gigaom.com/2012/04/24/the-dsl-death-march-continues/ |title=DSL Death March Continues |author=Om Malik |date=Apr 24, 2012 |website=Gigaom.com |access-date=2019-10-21}}</ref>\n\n==Operation==\nTelephones are connected to the [[telephone exchange]] via a [[local loop]], which is a physical pair of wires. The local loop was originally intended mostly for the transmission of speech, encompassing an audio frequency range of 300 to 3400 [[hertz]] ([[commercial bandwidth]]). However, as long-distance [[Trunking|trunk]]s were gradually converted from analog to digital operation, the idea of being able to pass data through the local loop (by utilizing frequencies above the voiceband) took hold, ultimately leading to DSL.\n\nThe [[local loop]] connecting the telephone exchange to most subscribers has the capability of carrying frequencies well beyond the 3400&nbsp;kHz upper limit of [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]]. Depending on the length and quality of the loop, the upper limit can be tens of megahertz. DSL takes advantage of this unused [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the local loop by creating 4312.5&nbsp;Hz wide channels starting between 10 and 100&nbsp;kHz, depending on how the system is configured. Allocation of channels continues to higher frequencies (up to 1.1&nbsp;MHz for ADSL) until new channels are deemed unusable. Each channel is evaluated for usability in much the same way an [[analog modem]] would on a POTS connection. More usable channels equate to more available bandwidth, which is why distance and line quality are a factor (the higher frequencies used by DSL travel only short distances). \n\nThe pool of usable channels is then split into two different frequency bands for [[upstream (networking)|upstream]] and [[downstream (networking)|downstream]] traffic, based on a preconfigured ratio. This segregation reduces interference. Once the channel groups have been established, the individual [[Communication channel|channel]]s are [[Channel bonding|bonded]] into a pair of virtual circuits, one in each direction. Like analog modems, DSL [[transceiver]]s constantly monitor the quality of each channel and will add or remove them from service depending on whether they are usable. Once upstream and downstream circuits are established, a [[subscriber]] can connect to a service such as an [[Internet service provider]] or other network services, like a corporate [[MPLS]] network.\n\nThe underlying technology of transport across DSL facilities uses [[modulation]] of high-frequency [[carrier wave]]s, an analog signal transmission. A DSL circuit terminates at each end in a [[modem]] which modulates patterns of [[Binary digit|bits]] into certain high-frequency impulses for transmission to the opposing modem. Signals received from the far-end modem are demodulated to yield a corresponding bit pattern that the modem passes on, in digital form, to its interfaced equipment, such as a computer, router, switch, etc.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\nUnlike traditional dial-up modems, which modulate bits into signals in the 300\u20133400&nbsp;Hz baseband (voice service), DSL modems modulate frequencies from 4000&nbsp;Hz to as high as 4&nbsp;MHz. This frequency band separation enables DSL service and [[plain old telephone service]] (POTS) to coexist on the same copper pair facility. On the subscriber's end of the circuit, inline [[low-pass]] [[DSL filter]]s (splitters) are installed on each telephone to filter the high-frequency signals that would otherwise be heard as hiss, but pass voice frequencies. Conversely, [[high-pass filter]]s already incorporated in the circuitry of DSL modems filter out voice frequencies. Although ADSL and RADSL modulations do not use the voice-frequency band, nonlinear elements in the phone could otherwise generate audible intermodulation and may impair the operation of the data modem in the absence of high-pass filters.\n[[File:T-DSL Modem.jpg|thumb|right|A DSL modem]]\n\nBecause DSL operates above the 3.4&nbsp;kHz voice limit, it cannot pass through a [[Loading coil|load coil]], which is an inductive coil that is designed to counteract loss caused by shunt capacitance (capacitance between the two wires of the twisted pair). Load coils are commonly set at regular intervals in lines placed only for POTS. A DSL signal cannot pass through a properly installed and working load coil, while voice service cannot be maintained past a certain distance without such coils. Therefore, some areas that are within range for DSL service are disqualified from eligibility because of load coil placement. Because of this, phone companies endeavor to remove load coils on copper loops that can operate without them, and by conditioning other lines to avoid them through the use of fiber to the neighborhood or node ([[FTTN]]).\n\nMost residential and small-office DSL implementations reserve low frequencies for POTS, so that (with suitable filters and/or splitters) the existing voice service continues to operate independently of the DSL service. Thus POTS-based communications, including [[Fax|fax machines]] and analog modems, can share the wires with DSL. Only one DSL modem can use the [[subscriber line]] at a time. The standard way to let multiple computers share a DSL connection uses a [[Router (computing)|router]] that establishes a connection between the DSL modem and a local [[Ethernet]], [[Power line communication|Powerline]], or [[Wi-Fi]] network on the customer's premises.\n\nThe theoretical foundations of DSL, like much of [[communication]] technology, can be traced back to [[Claude Shannon]]'s seminal 1948 paper: ''[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]''. Generally, higher bit rate transmissions require a wider frequency band, though the ratio of [[bit rate]] to [[symbol rate]] and thus to bandwidth are not linear due to significant innovations in [[digital signal processing]] and [[Digital modulation#Digital modulation methods|digital modulation methods]].\n\n===Naked DSL===\n{{main|Naked DSL}}\nA [[naked DSL]] (also known as standalone or [[dry loop]] DSL) is a way of providing DSL services without a [[PSTN]] ([[analog signal|analogue]] [[telephony]]) service. It is useful when the customer does not need the traditional [[telephony]] voice service because voice service is received either on top of the DSL services (usually [[Voice over IP|VoIP]]) or through another network ([[mobile telephony]]).\n\nIt is also commonly called a UNE (for [[unbundled network element]]) in the United States; in Australia it is known as a ULL (unconditioned local loop);<ref>[http://whirlpool.net.au/wiki/ull ULL (unconditioned local loop)]. Whirlpool.net.au.

The telephone company connects the other end of the line to a [[DSLAM]], which concentrates a large number of individual DSL connections into a single box. The location of the DSLAM depends on the telco, but it cannot be located too far from the user because of [[attenuation]] between the DSLAM and the user's DSL modem. It is common for a few residential blocks to be connected to one DSLAM.\n\nThe accompanying figure is a schematic of a simple DSL connection (in blue). The right side shows a DSLAM residing in the telephone company's telephone exchange. The left side shows the customer premises equipment with an optional router. The router manages a local area network (LAN) which connects PCs and other local devices. With many service providers, the customer may opt for a modem which contains both a router and wireless access. This option (within the dashed bubble) often simplifies the connection.\n[[File:Dsl schematic.svg|thumb|center|600px|DSL Connection schematic]]\n\n[[File:Outdoor DSLAM.JPG|thumb|Example of a DSLAM from 2006]]\n\n===Exchange equipment===\nAt the exchange, a [[digital subscriber line access multiplexer]] (DSLAM) [[Electrical termination|terminate]]s the DSL circuits and aggregates them, where they are [[handoff|handed off]] to other networking transports. In the case of ADSL, the voice component is also separated at this step, either by a filter integrated in the DSLAM or by a specialized filtering equipment installed before it. The DSLAM terminates all connections and recovers the original digital information.\n\n===Customer equipment===\nThe customer end of the connection consists of a terminal adapter or \"[[DSL modem]]\". This converts data between the digital signals used by computers and the analog [[voltage]] signal of a suitable frequency range which is then applied to the phone line.\n[[File:Dsl modem schematic.svg|thumb|center|400px|DSL Modem schematic]]\n\nIn some DSL variations (for example, [[HDSL]]), the terminal adapter connects directly to the computer via a serial interface, using protocols such as [[ethernet]] or [[V.35 (recommendation)|V.35]]. In other cases (particularly ADSL), it is common for the customer equipment to be integrated with higher level functionality, such as routing, firewalling, or other application-specific hardware and software. In this case, the equipment is referred to as a gateway.\n\nMost DSL technologies require installation of appropriate filters to separate, or split, the DSL signal from the low-frequency voice signal. The separation can take place either at the [[demarcation point]], or with filters installed at the telephone outlets inside the customer premises. Each way has its practical and economic limitations.\n====DSL modem initialization====\nWhen the DSL modem powers up it goes through a series of steps to establish connections. The actual process varies from modem to modem but generally involves the following steps:\n# The DSL transceiver performs a self-test, including image load and activation.\n# The DSL transceiver then attempts to [[synchronize]] with the DSLAM. Data can only come into the computer when the DSLAM and the modem are synchronized. The synchronization process is relatively quick (in the range of seconds) but is very complex, involving extensive tests that allow both sides of the connection to optimize the performance for line characteristics including noise and error handling. External, or standalone modem units have an indicator labeled \"CD\", \"DSL\", or \"LINK\", which can be used to tell if the modem is synchronized. During synchronization the light flashes; when synchronized, the light stays lit, usually green.\n# If supported, the DSL transceiver establishes a [[gateway (telecommunications)|gateway]] internet connection.\n# The DSL transceiver establishes a connection with the router or computer. For residential variations of DSL, this is usually the [[Ethernet]] (RJ-45) port or a [[USB]] port; in rare models, a [[FireWire]] port is used. Older DSL modems sported a native ATM interface (usually, a 25&nbsp;Mbit/s [[serial interface]]). Also, some variations of DSL (such as SDSL) use synchronous serial connections.\n\nModern DSL [[gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]] often integrate routing and other functionality. Their initialization is very similar to a PC [[boot up]]. The system image is loaded from the [[flash memory|flash storage]]; the system boots, synchronizes the DSL connection and finally establishes the internet IP services and connection between the local network and the service provider, using protocols such as [[DHCP]] or [[PPPoE]]. According to ''Implementation and Applications of DSL Technology'' (2007), the PPPoE method far outweighed DHCP in terms of deployment on DSLs, and [[password authentication protocol|PAP]] was the predominant form of subscriber authentication used in such circumstances.<ref name=\"GoldenDedieu2007b\">{{cite book|author1=Philip Golden|author2=Herv\u00e9 Dedieu|author3=Krista S.

In a bridged configuration, the group of subscriber computers effectively connect into a single subnet. The earliest implementations used [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] to provide network details such as the [[IP address]] to the subscriber equipment, with [[authentication]] via [[MAC address]] or an assigned host name. Later implementations often use [[Point-to-Point Protocol]] (PPP) to authenticate with a user ID and password, and to provide network details ([[Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet]] (PPPoE) or [[Point-to-Point Protocol over ATM]] (PPPoA)).\n\n==Transmission modulation methods==\nTransmission methods vary by market, region, carrier, and equipment.\n* DMT: [[Discrete multitone modulation]], the most common kind, also known as OFDM ([[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing]])\n* [[TC-PAM]]: Trellis Coded Pulse Amplitude Modulation, used for [[HDSL2]] and [[SHDSL]]\n* CAP: [[Carrierless Amplitude Phase Modulation]] - deprecated in 1996 for ADSL, used for HDSL\n* 2B1Q: [[Two-binary, one-quaternary]], used for IDSL and HDSL\n\n==DSL technologies==\nDSL technologies (sometimes collectively summarized as '''xDSL''') include:\n*[[Symmetric digital subscriber line]] (SDSL), umbrella term for xDSL where the bitrate is equal in both directions.\n**[[ISDN digital subscriber line]] (IDSL), ISDN-based technology that provides a bitrate equivalent to two ISDN bearer and one data channel, 144&nbsp;kbit/s symmetric over one pair\n**[[High bit rate digital subscriber line]] (HDSL), ITU-T G.991.1, the first DSL technology that used a higher frequency spectrum than ISDN, 1,544&nbsp;kbit/s and 2,048&nbsp;kbit/s symmetric services, either on 2 or 3 pairs at 784&nbsp;kbit/s each, 2 pairs at 1,168&nbsp;kbit/s each, or one pair at 2,320&nbsp;kbit/s\n**[[High bit rate digital subscriber line 2|High bit rate digital subscriber line 2/4]] (HDSL2, HDSL4), ANSI, 1,544&nbsp;kbit/s symmetric over one pair (HDSL2) or two pairs (HDSL4)\n**[[Symmetric digital subscriber line]] (SDSL), specific proprietary technology, up to 1,544&nbsp;kbit/s symmetric over one pair\n**[[Single-pair high-speed digital subscriber line]] (G.SHDSL), ITU-T G.991.2, standardized successor of HDSL and proprietary SDSL, up to 5,696&nbsp;kbit/s per pair, up to four pairs\n*[[Asymmetric digital subscriber line]] (ADSL), umbrella term for xDSL where the bitrate is greater in one direction than the other.\n**[[ANSI T1.413 Issue 2]], up to 8&nbsp;Mbit/s and 1&nbsp;Mbit/s\n**[[G.992.1|G.dmt]], ITU-T G.992.1, up to 10&nbsp;Mbit/s and 1&nbsp;Mbit/s\n**[[G.992.2|G.lite]], ITU-T G.992.2, more noise and attenuation resistant than G.dmt, up to 1,536&nbsp;kbit/s and 512&nbsp;kbit/s\n**[[Asymmetric digital subscriber line 2]] (ADSL2), ITU-T G.992.3, up to 12&nbsp;Mbit/s and 3.5&nbsp;Mbit/s\n**[[Asymmetric digital subscriber line 2 plus]] (ADSL2+), ITU-T G.992.5, up to 24&nbsp;Mbit/s and 3.5&nbsp;Mbit/s\n**[[Very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line]] (VDSL), ITU-T G.993.1, up to 52&nbsp;Mbit/s and 16&nbsp;Mbit/s\n**[[Very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line 2]] (VDSL2), ITU-T G.993.2, an improved version of VDSL, compatible with ADSL2+, sum of both directions up to 200&nbsp;Mbit/s.

The group justifies its ideology on verse 2:216 of the [[Quran]]. Extrapolating from this verse, the group asserts that military jihad is a religious obligation of all Muslims and defines the many circumstances under which it must be carried out. In a pamphlet entitled \"Why Are We Waging Jihad?\", the group states that all of [[India]] along with many other countries were once ruled by Muslims and were Muslim lands, which is their duty to take it back from the non-Muslims.
