The cars replaced all remaining [[R42 (New York City Subway car)|R42s]] and are expected to replace all remaining [[R32 (New York City Subway car)|R32s]].\n\nOriginally, the R179 order was supposed to contain 208 cars that were each {{convert|75|ft|m}} long. In the 2010\u20132014 Capital Program, the order was changed to 290 cars that were {{convert|60|ft|m}} long, similar to the car lengths of the [[R143 (New York City Subway car)|R143]] and [[R160 (New York City Subway car)|R160]] orders, with options for up to 130 more cars. The majority of the R179s were supposed to be in {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} five-car sets because the R179s would be replacing the 75-foot-long [[R44 (New York City Subway car)|R44s]], which were arranged in 300-foot-long four-car sets. A minority of the R179s were to be arranged in {{convert|240|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} four-car sets. In 2011, the order was reduced to 300 60-foot-long cars with no additional option orders. Because of the R44s' earlier than planned retirement and the R32s and R42s assigned to services utilizing eight-car trains at the time, the setup was reversed, with the majority of the R179s being arranged in four-car sets.\n\nThe $599 million contract for the R179s' construction was awarded to Bombardier in 2012. At the time, the first R179 train was set to be delivered in December 2014 and the last train would be delivered in July 2017. Because of manufacturing defects during the construction process, the timeline for delivery was pushed back two years, and the cost of the contract rose to $735 million. The first R179 cars were delivered in September 2016, and the first test train of eight cars was placed in service in November 2017. The test train passed its 30-day in-service test in December 2017, which allowed the remaining R179s to be gradually placed in service. All cars were expected to be delivered by early 2019. However, starting in December 2018, several cars had to be withdrawn from service due to defects, and in January 2019, deliveries were temporarily halted while these defects were being fixed. In January 2020, the R179s were experiencing door problems, leading to the entire fleet being pulled from revenue service for a short period.\n\nIn January 2018, sixteen more cars were added to the order as part of a settlement so that there would be 24 five-car sets instead of the 8 originally projected and 49 four-car sets instead of the original 65. In January 2019, two more cars were added to the order as a part of a settlement for further damages. All cars were delivered by December 2019, and had entered service by March 2020.\n\n==Description==\nThe R179s are numbered 3010-3327. Cars numbered 3010-3049 & 3238-3327 are configured into five-car sets, which are assigned to the [[A (New York City Subway service)|A]] and  based out of [[Pitkin Yard]]. Cars numbered 3050-3237 are configured into four-car sets, which are split between the [[J/Z (New York City Subway service)|J and Z]] (based out of [[East New York Yard]]) and the [[C (New York City Subway service)|C]] (based out of [[207th Street Yard]]).\n\n===Features===\n[[File:From the J Train 05 - R179.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The FIND screen of the R179]]\nThe R179 cars are equipped with updated control systems, [[HVAC]] and public address systems. They are visually very similar to the [[R160 (New York City Subway car)|R160s]], but the two car types are not interoperable with each other due to electrical incompatibilities between them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/160523_1030_Transit.pdf|title=Transit & Bus Committee Meeting May 2016|date=May 2016|website=mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|access-date=September 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe R179s, like the R160s, employ an advanced alternative to electronic strip maps called the [[New Technology Train#FIND displays|\"Flexible Information and Notice Display\"]] (\"FIND\"), which are manufactured by Axion Technologies Ltd. This includes an [[LCD]] screen displaying the route, route information, and advertisements, as well as a dynamic red, yellow, and green LED strip map that displays the next ten stations, plus five consecutive \"further stops\" to riders.<ref>https://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?149991</ref> There are three of these in every car. The display updates the stations at every stop, also giving the number of stops to each station listed. This allows for instant route or line changes with the correct information, which includes, but is not limited to, omitting certain stops (displayed as \"Will not stop\" in red). However, the LCD displays on the R179s that show the route are slightly larger than those on the R160s. Additionally, if the FIND has gone blank, the R179 FIND displays \"Route change: this map is not in use\", as opposed to the R160 FIND, which displays \"Listen to train crew for announcement.\"<ref name=\"Metro-NYCS-NTT-Dec2006\">{{cite news|url=http://www.metro-magazine.com/rail/article/210993/new-york-city-bringing-rail-into-the-21st-century|title=New York City Bringing Rail Into the 21st Century|date=December 6, 2006|work=[[Metro Magazine]]|last1=Seaton|first1=Charles|accessdate=January 27, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"MTA-CapitalOversight-Jan2016\">{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/160125_1345_CPOC.pdf|title=MTA Capital Program Oversight Meeting January 2016|date=January 2016|website=mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|access-date=January 23, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129071849/http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/160125_1345_CPOC.pdf|archivedate=January 29, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"NYTimes-NYCSPromiseInfo-Nov20052\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/30/nyregion/30car.html|title=New Subway Cars Promise All Kinds of Information|last=Chan|first=Sewell|date=November 30, 2005|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|authorlink=Sewell Chan|accessdate=October 27, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?149990|title=Showing Image 149990|website=www.nycsubway.org|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> In addition, the R179s utilize the older door closing chimes used on the R142s and R142As, as opposed to the newer door chimes used on the R143s, R160s and R188s.

The cars replaced all remaining [[R42 (New York City Subway car)|R42s]] and are expected to replace some remaining [[R32 (New York City Subway car)|R32s]].\n\nOriginally, the R179 order was supposed to contain 208 cars that were each {{convert|75|ft|m}} long. In the 2010\u20132014 Capital Program, the order was changed to 290 cars that were {{convert|60|ft|m}} long, similar to the car lengths of the [[R143 (New York City Subway car)|R143]] and [[R160 (New York City Subway car)|R160]] orders, with options for up to 130 more cars. The majority of the R179s were supposed to be in {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} five-car sets because the R179s would be replacing the 75-foot-long [[R44 (New York City Subway car)|R44s]], which were arranged in 300-foot-long four-car sets. A minority of the R179s were to be arranged in {{convert|240|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} four-car sets. In 2011, the order was reduced to 300 60-foot-long cars with no additional option orders. Because of the R44s' earlier than planned retirement and the R32s and R42s assigned to services utilizing eight-car trains at the time, the setup was reversed, with the majority of the R179s being arranged in four-car sets.\n\nThe $599 million contract for the R179s' construction was awarded to Bombardier in 2012. At the time, the first R179 train was set to be delivered in December 2014 and the last train would be delivered in July 2017. Because of manufacturing defects during the construction process, the timeline for delivery was pushed back two years, and the cost of the contract rose to $735 million. The first R179 cars were delivered in September 2016, and the first test train of eight cars was placed in service in November 2017. The test train passed its 30-day in-service test in December 2017, which allowed the remaining R179s to be gradually placed in service. All cars were expected to be delivered by early 2019. However, starting in December 2018, several cars had to be withdrawn from service due to defects, and in January 2019, deliveries were temporarily halted while these defects were being fixed. In January 2020, the R179s were experiencing door problems, leading to the entire fleet being pulled from revenue service for a short period.\n\nIn January 2018, sixteen more cars were added to the order as part of a settlement so that there would be 24 five-car sets instead of the 8 originally projected and 49 four-car sets instead of the original 65. In January 2019, two more cars were added to the order as a part of a settlement for further damages. All cars were delivered by December 2019, and had entered service by March 2020.\n\n==Description==\nThe R179s are numbered 3010-3327. Cars numbered 3010-3049 & 3238-3327 are configured into five-car sets, which are assigned to the [[A (New York City Subway service)|A]] and  based out of [[Pitkin Yard]]. Cars numbered 3050-3237 are configured into four-car sets, which are split between the [[J/Z (New York City Subway service)|J and Z]] (based out of [[East New York Yard]]) and the [[C (New York City Subway service)|C]] (based out of [[207th Street Yard]]).\n\n===Features===\n[[File:From the J Train 05 - R179.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The FIND screen of the R179]]\nThe R179 cars are equipped with updated control systems, [[HVAC]] and public address systems. They are visually very similar to the [[R160 (New York City Subway car)|R160s]], but the two car types are not interoperable with each other due to electrical incompatibilities between them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/mta/news/books/pdf/160523_1030_Transit.pdf|title=Transit & Bus Committee Meeting May 2016|date=May 2016|website=mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|access-date=September 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe R179s, like the R160s, employ an advanced alternative to electronic strip maps called the [[New Technology Train#FIND displays|\"Flexible Information and Notice Display\"]] (\"FIND\"), which are manufactured by Axion Technologies Ltd. This includes an [[LCD]] screen displaying the route, route information, and advertisements, as well as a dynamic red, yellow, and green LED strip map that displays the next ten stations, plus five consecutive \"further stops\" to riders.<ref>https://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?149991</ref> There are three of these in every car.

The common name refers to their bell-like call. 'Miner' is an old alternative spelling of '[[myna]]', and is shared with other members of the genus ''[[Manorina]]''.<ref>For the derivation of 'miner' from 'myna', see comment at Common Indian Myna [http://fennerschool-associated.anu.edu.au/myna/] Retrieved 12 September 2013</ref>  The birds feed almost exclusively on the dome-like coverings, referred to as 'bell lerps', of certain [[psyllid]] bugs that feed on [[eucalyptus]] sap from the leaves. The psyllids make these bell lerps from their own honeydew secretions in order to protect themselves from predators and the environment.\n\nBell miners live in large, complex, social groups.  Within each group, there are subgroups consisting of several breeding pairs, but also including a number of birds that are not currently breeding.  The nonbreeders help in providing food for the young in all the nests within the subgroup, even though they are not necessarily closely related to them.<ref name=\"Ethology\">{{cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = M.

They do this in order to protect their territory from other insect-eating birds that would eat the bell lerps on which they feed.  Whenever the local forests die back, due to increased lerp psyllid infestations, bell miners undergo a population boom.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe bell miner (''Manorina melanophrys'') belongs to the family of [[honeyeater]]s and Australian chats ([[Meliphagidae]]), which is part of the superfamily [[Meliphagoidea]] that also comprises the Australian warblers, scrubwrens, and thornbills ([[Acanthizidae]]); bristlebirds ([[Dasyornithidae]]); fairy-wrens ([[Maluridae]]); and pardalotes ([[Pardalotidae]]).<ref name=\"Phylogeny\">{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Janet L.|last2=Trueman|first2=John W.H.|last3=Ebert|first3=Daniel|last4=Joseph|first4=Leo|last5=Magrath|first5=Robert D.|title=Phylogeny and evolution of the Meliphagoidea, the largest radiation of Australasian songbirds|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|date=June 2010|volume=55|issue=3|pages=1087\u20131102|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005|pmid=20152917}}</ref>\nBell miners share the genus ''[[Manorina]]'' with three other endemic Australian miners: the [[noisy miner]] (''M. melanocephala''), the [[yellow-throated miner]] (''M. flavigula''), and the endangered [[black-eared miner]] (''M. melanotis''). The three other miners were previously classified in the genus ''Myzantha'', which is still sometimes listed as a subgenus for those species. The closest related genus to ''[[Manorina]]'' has been genetically found to be the New Guinea and New Britain ''[[Melidectes]]'' honeyeaters.

The common name refers to their bell-like call. 'Miner' is an old alternative spelling of '[[myna]]', and is shared with other members of the genus ''[[Manorina]]''.<ref>For the derivation of 'miner' from 'myna', see comment at Common Indian Myna [http://fennerschool-associated.anu.edu.au/myna/] Retrieved 12 September 2013</ref>  The birds feed almost exclusively on the dome-like coverings, referred to as 'bell lerps', of certain [[psyllid]] bugs that feed on [[eucalyptus]] sap from the leaves. The psyllids make these bell lerps from their own honeydew secretions in order to protect themselves from predators and the environment.\n\nBell miners live in large, complex, social groups.  Within each group, there are subgroups consisting of several breeding pairs, but also including a number of birds that are not currently breeding.  The nonbreeders help in providing food for the young in all the nests within the subgroup, even though they are not necessarily closely related to them.<ref name=\"Ethology\">{{cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = M.

The style is often used in [[Erotica|erotic]] [[manga]], [[anime]] ({{lang|ja-Latn|[[hentai]]}}), and [[video game]]s ({{lang|ja-Latn|[[Eroge|erog\u0113]]}}).\n\n== History ==\nAlso known as the O-Face, the term {{lang|ja-Latn|ahegao}} dates at least as far back as 1994 in the manga \u756a\u5916\u5730\u8cac, which roughly translates to Pan Outside Ground Responsibility. Pornographic magazines used the word to describe the facial expressions of female live-action [[Pornography|porn]] actresses during [[orgasm]]. In the same context, {{lang|ja-Latn|ahegao}} was used in some postings at ''[[2Channel]]'' and its sister community for adult content, ''BBSPink'', as well as in pornographic videos at adult [[e-commerce]] platforms in the early 2000s.<ref name=\"Media\">{{Cite news|title=TAKE A LOOK AT THE JAPANESE ORGASM FACE SWEEPING SOCIAL MEDIA|url=https://www.inkedmag.com/original-news/ahegao|last=Preston|first=Devon|date=April 3, 2019|work=Inked Magazine}}</ref><ref name=\"What\"/><ref name=\"Sankaku\" />\n\n\nIn the midst of the 2000s, use of the term increased, and the drawing style became rather conventionalized and started spreading throughout the {{lang|ja-Latn|[[otaku]]}} culture.
