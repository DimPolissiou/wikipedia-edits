Zeitlin, who participated in the conferences, moved to New York in 1981, and, in 1983, became the President of the New York City Chapter of the New York Folklore Society.''\u00a0'' City Lore\u2019s first program was a tribute to late anthropologist [[Barbara Myerhoff]] in September, 1985.\u00a0 In 1986 moved into offices at 72 E. First Street on the Lower East Side.\u00a0 In 1986, the organization held the first City Lore Festival in [[Central Park]] staged in tandem with the first [[Central Park Summerstage]].\n\n== Approach to Folklore ==\n[[File:1477 0004im 2006-12-07.jpg|thumb|City Lore founder Steve Zeitlin]]\nCity Lore's Founder Dr. Steve Zeitlin has said that City Lore has: an \"open mission to document and present New York City and America's living cultural heritage. ''Living cultural heritage'' used by folklorists to suggest the documentation, interpretation, and presentation of traditions within living memory, as opposed to events that predate living memory, and are, in a sense, ''purely historical.''\u00a0 The original impetus for the discipline of folklore in the 19th century was the notion of collecting myths and legends as \"survivals\" from an earlier age, but City Lore is very present oriented. It's not only about capturing the past, it's about using an arts perspective to look at life itself. And to see the present in a slightly more vivid and interested and compelling way by looking at the artistic impulse in everyday life. Folklorists distinguish themselves from historians and from cultural anthropologists, because of the attention they pay to the aesthetic dimensions of history and culture.\"<sup>[2]\u00a0</sup>\n\nAccording to Zeitlin, City Lore is \u201ctradition inspired but not tradition bound, and we are all about the redemptive power of grassroots creativity.\"  Working across so many arenas of life, the organization has been described as a \u201cfull court press\u201d on what became the tag line for the organization: the art of everyday life.  \n\nIn a formal evaluation by the Artography initiative of [http://www.lincnet.net/ Leveraging Investments in Creativity (LINC)] \u00a0funded by the Ford Foundation, Dr. William Westerman writes:\n\n''\"It\u2019s hard to understand what City Lore does in terms of art-making without first understanding how folklorists think of the concept of art. It is as if in Western society what is seen as the arts is equivalent to the visible light in the spectrum, whereas folklorists see the art across the whole spectrum, from ultraviolet to infrared. That full range of creative expression is what concerns the mission of City Lore, and it\u00a0 includes history and memory, language and religion, food and gardens, lace and place.\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gateway.lincnet.net/1753/www.citylore.org|title=City Lore - LINC|website=www.gateway.lincnet.net|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>\n\n''The difference between City Lore and other arts programs is not simply that the arts presented are folk and traditional arts, but that City Lore\u2019s arts are traditional and modern, and a great deal of the artmaking takes place in the collaborations of different cultural organizations and artists, and in the ties between the traditional and the way that contemporary New Yorkers use and adapt their traditions in their current work, whether they are professionals or schoolchildren. In this way, musical and poetic forms that build on traditional genres \u2013 including hip-hop, mambo,and spoken word \u2013 are part of a continuum of artistic practice that recognizes and builds upon deep genealogical connections to the past without being bound by them. It is in this way that City Lore\u2019s work gets far beyond nostalgia, because the thrust is always forward-looking, not referring to what once was and could never be again, but building creatively with respect for the cultural foundations that exist.\"''<sup>[3]</sup>\n\n== Programs and Series ==\nCity Lore works in four cultural domains: urban folklore and history, preservation, arts in education, and grassroots poetry traditions.\u00a0 In addition, City Lore undertakes special projects in keeping with its mission, and serves as a fiscal sponsor for filmmakers and other cultural specialists.\n\n=== Urban folklore ===\nThe City Lore archives at 56 E.

The People\u2019s Poetry Project grew out of the ''People\u2019s Poetry Gathering'', held in 1999, 2001, 2003 with Poets House, and in 2006 with [[Bowery Poetry Club|Bowery Arts + Science]], to bring together folk, ethnic, inner city, and literary poets. During these festivals in 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2006, Lower Manhattan was transformed into a poetry village for three days.\u00a0 The ''People\u2019s Poetry Gathering'' was one of the highest profile poetry events in the United States and had an average audience of 10,000.\u00a0 In 2003, Poet Laureate, Billy Collins, wrote an insightful essay on the ballad for ''The New York Times'' on the festival\u2019s opening day; and City Lore hosted a special conference and concert honoring [[Alan Lomax]] for his contribution to folk music and poetry. \u00a0''[[Beowulf]]'' and ''[[Epic of Sundiata|Sundiata]]'' were among the works featured.\n\nIn the aftermath of [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]] attacks, City Lore found and collected anonymous poems and other writings that had been left at memorials, hospitals and gathering places throughout the city.

''Living cultural heritage'' used by folklorists to suggest the documentation, interpretation, and presentation of traditions within living memory, as opposed to events that predate living memory, and are, in a sense, ''purely historical.''\u00a0 The original impetus for the discipline of folklore in the 19th century was the notion of collecting myths and legends as \"survivals\" from an earlier age, but City Lore is very present oriented. It's not only about capturing the past, it's about using an arts perspective to look at life itself. And to see the present in a slightly more vivid and interested and compelling way by looking at the artistic impulse in everyday life. Folklorists distinguish themselves from historians and from cultural anthropologists, because of the attention they pay to the aesthetic dimensions of history and culture.\"<sup>[2]\u00a0</sup>\n\nAccording to Zeitlin, City Lore is \u201ctradition inspired but not tradition bound, and we are all about the redemptive power of grassroots creativity.\"  Working across so many arenas of life, the organization has been described as a \u201cfull court press\u201d on what became the tag line for the organization: the art of everyday life.  \n\nIn a formal evaluation by the Artography initiative of [http://www.lincnet.net/ Leveraging Investments in Creativity (LINC)] \u00a0funded by the Ford Foundation, Dr. William Westerman writes:\n\n''\"It\u2019s hard to understand what City Lore does in terms of art-making without first understanding how folklorists think of the concept of art. It is as if in Western society what is seen as the arts is equivalent to the visible light in the spectrum, whereas folklorists see the art across the whole spectrum, from ultraviolet to infrared. That full range of creative expression is what concerns the mission of City Lore, and it\u00a0 includes history and memory, language and religion, food and gardens, lace and place.\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gateway.lincnet.net/1753/www.citylore.org|title=City Lore - LINC|website=www.gateway.lincnet.net|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>\n\n''The difference between City Lore and other arts programs is not simply that the arts presented are folk and traditional arts, but that City Lore\u2019s arts are traditional and modern, and a great deal of the artmaking takes place in the collaborations of different cultural organizations and artists, and in the ties between the traditional and the way that contemporary New Yorkers use and adapt their traditions in their current work, whether they are professionals or schoolchildren. In this way, musical and poetic forms that build on traditional genres \u2013 including hip-hop, mambo,and spoken word \u2013 are part of a continuum of artistic practice that recognizes and builds upon deep genealogical connections to the past without being bound by them. It is in this way that City Lore\u2019s work gets far beyond nostalgia, because the thrust is always forward-looking, not referring to what once was and could never be again, but building creatively with respect for the cultural foundations that exist.\"''<sup>[3]</sup>\n\n== Programs and Series ==\nCity Lore works in four cultural domains: urban folklore and history, preservation, arts in education, and grassroots poetry traditions.\u00a0 In addition, City Lore undertakes special projects in keeping with its mission, and serves as a fiscal sponsor for filmmakers and other cultural specialists.\n\n=== Urban folklore ===\nThe City Lore archives at 56 E.

And their own heritage is valuable, not only because it is their own, but also because of the importance of a strong indigenous culture to the coherence of community life.''\n\nCity Lore\u2019s teaching artists mirror the diversity of New York City\u2019s public schools, and the organization works with partner schools `to customize arts residencies so that they relate the schools\u2019 populations and integrate with their curricula.\u00a0 City Lore\u2019s arts programs have brought [[Mexicans|Mexican]], [[Ecuadorians|Ecuadorian]], [[Egyptians|Egyptian]], [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire|Ivorian]], [[Cubans|Cuban]], [[Haitians|Haitian]], [[Peruvians|Peruvian]], [[South Africa]]n, and [[Brazilians|Brazilian]] artists into the schools.\n\nRecent initiatives include:\n\n* ''Roots, Routes, & Rhythms'', an initiative that engages students in grades 3 through 8 from five [[Queens]] partner schools in exploring the roots of music and dance traditions in their boroughs and neighborhoods.\n* ''From Homer to Hip Hop: Oral Traditions as a Gateway to Literature and Literacy,'' a new program which introduces students in grades 3 and 8 in two elementary and two middle schools in Queens to world poetry traditions, including sung poetry.\n* ''Urban Explorers'', a year-round after school program, including Saturdays and summer, that engages 26 youth in grades 6 to 12 in multi-media storytelling about and advocating for New York City\u2019s grassroots cultures, while supporting their in-school education.\n* ''KickFlip,'' an interest-driven, connected learning program implemented 2013-2015 designed to engage teen skateboarders and help them develop filmmaking, game design and coding skills to develop projects relating to their sport.\n* City Lore\u2019s education programs also have a national outreach.\u00a0 The organization helped organize a national conference in 1993 at the National Endowment for the Arts, and served as the sponsor and incubator for Local Learning: the National Network for Folk Arts in Education.\u00a0City Lore cosponsored the newsletter ''CARTS (Cultural Arts Resources for Teachers and Students) Newsletter.'' City Lore contributes regularly to Local Learning's publication, ''Journal of Folk Arts in Education''.\n\n=== Grassroots Poetry ===\n\nPoetry plays a key role in New York\u2019s ethnic and cultural communities.\u00a0 For many immigrant communities, poetry is the most accessible and profound way for people to express themselves.\u00a0 Every community in New York City has its poets.\u00a0 City Lore is committed to finding ways to give these poets voice, finding the venues and formats for them to convey their artistry to their own communities and to the city at large, often finding new and innovative ways to communicate across languages. \n\nCity Lore was inspired to create the People\u2019s Poetry initiative because, while some groups are dedicated to traditional music and many to literary poetry, no other organization was systematically presenting the diverse [[oral poetry]] traditions of New York City, the U.S. and beyond. The People\u2019s Poetry Project grew out of the ''People\u2019s Poetry Gathering'', held in 1999, 2001, 2003 with Poets House, and in 2006 with [[Bowery Poetry Club|Bowery Arts + Science]], to bring together folk, ethnic, inner city, and literary poets. During these festivals in 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2006, Lower Manhattan was transformed into a poetry village for three days.\u00a0 The ''People\u2019s Poetry Gathering'' was one of the highest profile poetry events in the United States and had an average audience of 10,000.\u00a0 In 2003, Poet Laureate, Billy Collins, wrote an insightful essay on the ballad for ''The New York Times'' on the festival\u2019s opening day; and City Lore hosted a special conference and concert honoring [[Alan Lomax]] for his contribution to folk music and poetry. \u00a0''[[Beowulf]]'' and ''[[Epic of Sundiata|Sundiata]]'' were among the works featured.\n\nIn the aftermath of [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]] attacks, City Lore found and collected anonymous poems and other writings that had been left at memorials, hospitals and gathering places throughout the city. Through these actions, City Lore played a major role in documenting the shrines and memorials that cropped up after 9/11. A selection of these anonymous poems was published in the book, ''Words In Your Face: A Guided Tour Through Twenty Years of the New York City Poetry Slam''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Words in your face : a guided tour through twenty years of the New York City Poetry Slam|last=Aptowicz, Cristin O'Keefe.|date=2008|publisher=Soft Skull|isbn=978-1-933368-82-5|location=New York|oclc=165956969|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/wordsinyourfaceg0000apto}}</ref> and appeared in Steve Zeitlin's essay, \"Oh Did You See the Ashes Come Thickly Falling Down.<ref>{{Citation|last=Zeitlin|first=Steve|chapter=Oh Did You See the Ashes Come Thickly Falling Down?

This inspired Bob Holman and Steve Zeitlin to begin work on a tribute to the world\u2019s endangered languages, a world \u201ccento\u201d (stitched together) poem in which each line came from a different endangered language.\u00a0In 2013, the Festival of American Folklife in Washington DC hosted ''[http://citylore.org/grassroots-poetry/khonsay-2/ Khonsay: Poem of Many Tongues]'' as an exhibit. The poem and subsequent film with Bob Holman would go on to serve as the subject of a tribute and call to action to preserve the worlds endangered languages, which premiered at the [[Margaret Mead Film Festival|Margaret Meade Film Festival,]] and can be viewed online with extensive background information and a call for language preservation.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4LVjx8dmnc][[File:Dancing Yiddish POMO.jpg|thumb|The City Lore PoeMobile in action]]\nIn 2010, City Lore and Bowery Arts + Science received a grant from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] to launch the POEMobile that projects poems onto walls and building in tandem with live readings in New York City Neighborhoods.

City Lore served as first fiscal sponsor for Puerto Rican Bomba and Plena band, Los Pleneros de la 21, whose director Juan Guti\u00e9rrez won a [[National Heritage Fellowship|National Heritage Award]] from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] in 1996. \n\nIn 2006, City Lore completed the documentary film ''[https://www.folkstreams.net/film-detail.php?id=444 From Mambo to Hip Hop],'' which won an Alma Award for Best Documentary that same year.\u00a0 In 2016, the organization sponsored Mathew Rodriguez Warrens\u2019 doc, ''We Like It Like That: the Story of Latin Boogaloo.\u00a0'' Elena Martinez coproduced both films, and was tapped by WHEDco (Women\u2019s Housing and Urban Development) to spearhead along with Grammy-nominated bandleader Bobby Sanabria, the Bronx Music Heritage Lab and the new cultural center, The Bronx Music Heritage Center, opening in 2020.\n\nIn 1995, City Lore, working with folklorist Ray Allen,  completed the Grassroots Gospel Initiative, recording acapella gospel quartet music in the borough's and releasing an LP.\u00a0 In 2006, Funds were raised by City Lore to support Peter Siegel's project to restore and issue tapes he made in the 1960s of folk music concerts by [[Mississippi John Hurt]], [[Carter Family|The Carter Family]], [[Jesse Fuller]], [[Bill Monroe]], and others. The recordings became the box set ''Friends of Old Time Music'' released by Smithsonian Folkways. <sup>[10] \u00a0</sup> The box set was named one of the 10 best box sets of 2006 by The New York Times.\n\n=== Urban Culture Exhibitions ===\n\nBeginning with the opening of the exhibit ''City Play'' at the Museum of the City of New York (MCNY) in 1988, City Lore has developed public exhibitions about New York City \u2013 and America\u2019s \u2013 folk culture.\u00a0 In 1993, City Lore curated the exhibit ''Welcome to Your Second Home: New York City\u2019s Ethnic Social Clubs'' at MCNY.\n\nIn 2002, City Lore researched and curated ''Missing: Streetscape of a City in Mourning'' about the shrines and memorials that cropped up on New York City Streets after September 11.\u00a0 In 2005, City Lore developed the traveling exhibit and accompanying book, ''Weavings of War'': ''Fabrics of Memory'' which featured the work of women textile artists from Central Asia, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and South Africa featured at The Puffin Gallery'''.'''<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Welsh|first=Mary Sue|date=2017-04-20|title=War Stories|journal=University of Illinois Press|volume=1|doi=10.5406/illinois/9780252037368.003.0015}}</ref>\u00a0 In 2012, City Lore curated the outdoor exhibit, ''Your Guide to the Lower East Side''.\u00a0\n[[File:1122 0001im 2006-03-09.jpg|thumb|The House under the Roller Coaster, made famous by Woody Allen in Annie Hall, demolished in 2000.

In 1991, folklorist Steve Zeitlin suggested to Dick Zigun at Coney Island USA that, rather than trying performance art, they should bring a traditional old time sideshow, which Zeitlin had brought to the Smithsonian\u2019s Folklife Festival a few years earlier, to Coney.

This island was chosen because of information that syphilis was more prevalent there than on [[Borneo]] or [[Sumatra]]. Participants included his wife and at least one of his trainees, Gustav Baermann. According to Neisser, at any one time they had 10-20 orang-utans, imported from Borneo, 20-30 [[Gibbon|gibbons]] and 600-800 monkeys (mainly macaques) in captivity. Many also died, not of pneumonia as in Breslau, but of gastroenteritis. Apes were more easily infected with syphilis than monkeys. The incubation period typically was 3-5 weeks. To test for the dissemination of the pathogen, tissue was taken from various organs of infected animals and inserted into healthy ones. It was found that marrow and, secondly, spleen were the most consistent sites of the pathogen. Blood was never infectious. Although secondary lesions occurred only in apes, it was demonstrated that unresponsiveness did not indicate lack of dissemination in monkeys. While they were in Java in 1905, [[Fritz Schaudinn|Fritz Schaudinnn]] (1871-1906) and [[Erich Hoffmann]] (1868-1959) in Berlin discovered the ''[[Spirochaeta]] pallida'', the pathogen of [[syphilis]]. How Neisser learned of this discovery is uncertain, but he at once attempted to verify the finding. This was successful in humans, as well as in a few apes and monkeys. \n\nNeisser credited most of this work to Baermann. A government-funded second expedition to Java was made in 1906-07. In this, in addition to continuing the experiments with primates and monkeys, attempts were made to transmit syphilis to other mammals and chickens. Success occurred only in guinea pigs, but thereby introduced a more practical animal for syphilis experimentation. This investigation, to which [[Rudolf P\u00fcrckhauer]] was assigned, continued in Breslau until 1909.\n\nIt is not clear if Baermann remained in the far-east or spent the intervening years in Breslau, however in the 1920s, he worked in Indonesia.\n\nBaermann later remarried Nina Marie Victorine Wetter (1896-1972) and they lived in Deli-Medan, Indonesia (former Dutch East Indies) raising a family of three children. While in Indonesia (former [[Dutch East Indies]]) he published a number of works on public health<ref>Baermann, G. and Eckersdorff, O. (1913) Atlas Tropischer Darmkrankheiten. Leipzig, Barth.</ref>, parasitic disease and he was active in trying to improve medical facilities in [[Medan|Deli-Medan]]. He returned to Germany in the early 1930s setting up a medical practice.  German telephone books list him from 1932 as a general practice doctor in Munich, which continue until 1947. He died in 1950.\n[[File:Baermann_atlas.jpg|thumb|B\u00e4rmann [SIC], G.; Eckersdorff, O.

(1917) Eine einfache Methode zur Auffindung von Ankylostomum- (Nematoden) Larven in Erdproben. Weltevreden, Batavia, Geneesk. Lab. Feestbundel: 41-47. In English: A simple method for the detection of Ankylostomum (nematode) larvae in soil tests. https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19182900349</ref> involves taking a glass funnel (size depending on sample size) and affixing rubber tubing to the bottom end and closing with a Mohr or Bunsen clip. The funnel is then filled with sterilised water.  A sample is held within a gauze and tied with string and suspended from a retort ring so that the sample touches the surface of the water.  A light can be set up above the apparatus (in this way similar to the [[Tullgren funnel|Tullgren-Berlese]] funnel).\n\nLiquor from the bottom of the apparatus is removed periodically by opening the clip into a small beaker and drops from this examined under the microscope. Eggs can be enumerated using a [[Hemocytometer|haemocyctometer]] or [[Coulter counter]].  The extraction is a partial extraction with some estimates of approximately 50% of total sample content.  If the sample is too dry, nematodes may find mobility within the sample difficult and if the sample is too wet, the sample will migrate into the water contaminating the extract.  Typically a sample of 100 to 200g is used of a paste-like consistency.\nThe method has been evaluated by Todd et al. (1970)<ref>Todd, K.S. JR., Levine, N.D.; and Andersen, F.L.

This island was chosen because of information that syphilis was more prevalent there than on [[Borneo]] or [[Sumatra]]. Participants included his wife and at least one of his trainees, Gustav Baermann. According to Neisser, at any one time they had 10-20 orang-utans, imported from Borneo, 20-30 [[Gibbon|gibbons]] and 600-800 monkeys (mainly macaques) in captivity. Many also died, not of pneumonia as in Breslau, but of gastroenteritis. Apes were more easily infected with syphilis than monkeys. The incubation period typically was 3-5 weeks. To test for the dissemination of the pathogen, tissue was taken from various organs of infected animals and inserted into healthy ones. It was found that marrow and, secondly, spleen were the most consistent sites of the pathogen. Blood was never infectious. Although secondary lesions occurred only in apes, it was demonstrated that unresponsiveness did not indicate lack of dissemination in monkeys. While they were in Java in 1905, [[Fritz Schaudinn|Fritz Schaudinnn]] (1871-1906) and [[Erich Hoffmann]] (1868-1959) in Berlin discovered the ''[[Spirochaeta]] pallida'', the pathogen of [[syphilis]].
