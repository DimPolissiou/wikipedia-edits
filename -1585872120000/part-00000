The seeds need {{convert|2|to|5|\u00b0C}} for emergence, an optimum of {{convert|20|-|30|\u00b0C}} is suggested. Cumin is vulnerable to frost damage, especially at flowering and early seed formation stages.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> Methods to reduce frost damage are spraying with [[sulfuric acid]] (0.1%), irrigating the crop prior to frost incidence, setting up [[windbreak]]s, or creating an early-morning smoke cover.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> The seedlings of cumin are rather small and their vigor is low. Soaking the seeds for 8 hours before sowing enhances germination.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> For an optimal plant population, a sowing density of {{convert|12|-|15|kg/ha}} is recommended.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> Fertile, sandy, loamy soils with good aeration, proper drainage, and high oxygen availability are preferred. The pH optimum of the soil ranges from 6.8 to 8.3.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> Cumin seedlings are sensitive to salinity{{cn|date=November 2019}}  and emergence from heavy soils is rather difficult. Therefore, a proper seedbed preparation (smooth bed) is crucial for optimal establishment of cumin.\n\nTwo sowing methods are used for cumin, broadcasting and line sowing.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> For broadcast sowing, the field is divided into beds and the seeds are uniformly broadcast in this bed. Afterwards, they are covered with soil using a rake. For line sowing, shallow furrows are prepared with hooks at a distance of {{convert|20|to|25|cm|0|abbr=on}}. The seeds are then placed in these furrows and covered with soil. Line sowing offers advantages for intercultural operations such as weeding, hoeing, or spraying.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> The recommended sowing depth is 1\u20132&nbsp;cm and the recommended sowing density is around 120 plants per m<sup>2</sup>. The water requirements of cumin are lower than those of many other species.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> Despite this, cumin is often irrigated after sowing to be sure that enough moisture is available for seedling development. The amount and frequency of irrigation depends on the climate conditions.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" />\n\n=== Cultivation management ===\nThe relative humidity in the center of origin of cumin is rather low. High relative humidity (i.e. wet years) favours fungal diseases. Cumin is especially sensitive to ''[[Alternaria]]'' blight and ''[[Fusarium]]'' wilt. Early-sown crops exhibit stronger disease effects than late sown crops. The most important disease is ''Fusarium'' wilt, resulting in yield losses up to 80%.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> ''Fusarium'' is seed- or soil-borne and it requires distinct soil temperatures for development of epidemics.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> Inadequate fertilization might favour ''Fusarium'' epidemics.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" />  Cumin blight (''Alternaria'') appears in the form of dark brown spots on leaves and stems.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> When the weather is cloudy after flowering, the incidence of the disease is increased.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> Another, but less important, disease is powdery mildew. Incidence of powdery mildew in early development can cause drastic yield losses because no seeds are formed.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> Later in development, powdery mildew causes discoloured, small seeds.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" />\n\nPathogens can lead to high reductions in crop yield. Cumin can be attacked by aphids (''[[Myzus persicae]]'') at the flowering stage. They suck the sap of the plant from tender parts and flowers. The plant becomes yellow, the seed formation is reduced (yield reduction), and the quality of the harvested product decreases. Heavily infested plant parts should be removed. Other important pests are the mites (''Petrobia latens'') which frequently attack the crop. Since the mites mostly feed on young leaves, the infestation is more severe on young inflorescences.\n\nThe open canopy of cumin is another problem. Only a low proportion of the incoming light is absorbed. The [[leaf area index]] of cumin is low (about 1.5). This might be a problem because weeds can compete with cumin for essential resources such as water and light and thereby lower yield. The slow growth and a short stature of cumin favours weed competition additionally.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> Two hoeing and weeding sessions (30 and 60 days after sowing) are needed for the control of weeds. During the first weeding session (30 days after sowing), thinning should be done, as well, to remove excess plants. The use of preplant or pre-emergence herbicides is very effective in India,<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> but this kind of herbicide application requires soil moisture for a successful weed control.\n<!-- how-to, not encyclopedic \n'''Fertilization recommendations in India<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" />'''\n* {{convert|20|kg/ha|abbr=on}} of phosphate (sowing)\n* {{convert|30|kg/ha|abbr=on}} of nitrogen, either\n**single dose (30 days after sowing) or\n**two doses (30 and 60 days after sowing)\n[[File:CuminEssOil.png|thumb|upright|Cumin essential oil in clear glass vial]]\n\n'''Fertilization recommendations in Syria<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" />'''\n* {{convert|50|kg|abbr=on}}{{clarify|date=March 2014}} of triple super phosphate (at planting)\n* 50&nbsp;kg of  urea (at planting) -->\n\n{{Nutritional value\n| name            = Cumin seed\n| image           = \n| caption         = \n| serving_size    = 100 g\n| kJ              = 1567\n| carbs           = 44.24 g\n| starch          = \n| sugars          = 2.25 g\n| fibre           = 10.5 g\n| fat             = 22.27 g\n| satfat          = 1.535 g\n| transfat        = \n| monofat         = 14.04 g\n| polyfat         = 3.279 g\n| omega3fat       = \n| omega6fat       = \n| protein         = 17.81 g\n| water           = 8.06 g\n| vitA_ug         = 64\n| vitA_iu         = 1270\n| betacarotene_ug = 762\n| lutein_ug       = \n| thiamin_mg      = 0.628\n| riboflavin_mg   = 0.327\n| niacin_mg       = 4.579\n| pantothenic_mg  = \n| vitB6_mg        = 0.435\n| folate_ug       = 10\n| vitB12_ug       = 0\n| choline_mg      = 24.7\n| vitC_mg         = 7.7\n| vitD_ug         = 0\n| vitD_iu         = 0\n| vitE_mg         = 3.33\n| vitK_ug         = 5.4\n| calcium_mg      = 931\n| iron_mg         = 66.36\n| magnesium_mg    = 931\n| manganese_mg    = 3.333\n| phosphorus_mg   = 499\n| potassium_mg    = 1788\n| sodium_mg       = 168\n| zinc_mg         = 4.8\n| note            = Reference<ref name=USDA>{{cite web|title=Cumin Seed|url=https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list?qlookup=02014&format=|publisher=National Nutrient Database, United States Department of Agriculture|date=2017|accessdate=24 February 2018}}</ref>\n| source          = \n| source_usda     = 1\n| noRDA           = \n| float           = \n}}\n\n== Breeding ==\nCumin is a diploid species with 14 chromosomes (i.e. 2n = 14). The chromosomes of the different varieties have morphological similarities with no distinct variation in length and volume. Most of the varieties available today are selections.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> The variabilities of yield and yield components are high. Varieties are developed by sib mating in enclosed chambers<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> or by biotechnology.\nCumin is a cross-pollinator, i.e. the breeds are already hybrids. Therefore, methods used for breeding are ''in vitro'' regenerations, DNA technologies, and gene transfers. The ''[[in vitro]]'' cultivation of cumin allows the production of genetically identical plants. The main sources for the explants used ''in vitro'' regenerations are embryos, hypocotyl, shoot internodes, leaves, and cotyledons.\nOne goal of cumin breeding is to improve its resistance to biotic (fungal diseases) and abiotic (cold, drought, salinity) stresses. The potential genetic variability for conventional breeding of cumin is limited and research about cumin genetics is scarce.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ebrahimie E, Habashi AA, Ghareyazie B, Ghannadha M, Mohammadie M | title = A rapid and efficient method for regeneration of plantlets from embryo explants of cumin (Cuminum cyminum) | journal = Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture | year = 2003 | volume = 75 | pages = 19\u201325 }}</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\n\nCumin seed is used as a spice for its distinctive flavour and aroma.<ref name=eb/><ref name=nabhan/> Cumin can be found in some cheeses, such as [[Leyden cheese]], and in some traditional breads from France.

The seeds need {{convert|2|to|5|\u00b0C}} for emergence, an optimum of {{convert|20|-|30|\u00b0C}} is suggested. Cumin is vulnerable to frost damage, especially at flowering and early seed formation stages.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> Methods to reduce frost damage are spraying with [[sulfuric acid]] (0.1%), irrigating the crop prior to frost incidence, setting up [[windbreak]]s, or creating an early-morning smoke cover.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> The seedlings of cumin are rather small and their vigor is low. Soaking the seeds for 8 hours before sowing enhances germination.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> For an optimal plant population, a sowing density of {{convert|12|-|15|kg/ha}} is recommended.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> Fertile, sandy, loamy soils with good aeration, proper drainage, and high oxygen availability are preferred. The pH optimum of the soil ranges from 6.8 to 8.3.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> Cumin seedlings are sensitive to salinity{{cn|date=November 2019}}  and emergence from heavy soils is rather difficult. Therefore, a proper seedbed preparation (smooth bed) is crucial for optimal establishment of cumin.\n\nTwo sowing methods are used for cumin, broadcasting and line sowing.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> For broadcast sowing, the field is divided into beds and the seeds are uniformly broadcast in this bed. Afterwards, they are covered with soil using a rake. For line sowing, shallow furrows are prepared with hooks at a distance of {{convert|20|to|25|cm|0|abbr=on}}. The seeds are then placed in these furrows and covered with soil. Line sowing offers advantages for intercultural operations such as weeding, hoeing, or spraying.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> The recommended sowing depth is 1\u20132&nbsp;cm and the recommended sowing density is around 120 plants per m<sup>2</sup>. The water requirements of cumin are lower than those of many other species.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> Despite this, cumin is often irrigated after sowing to be sure that enough moisture is available for seedling development. The amount and frequency of irrigation depends on the climate conditions.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" />\n\n=== Cultivation management ===\nThe relative humidity in the center of origin of cumin is rather low. High relative humidity (i.e. wet years) favours fungal diseases. Cumin is especially sensitive to ''[[Alternaria]]'' blight and ''[[Fusarium]]'' wilt. Early-sown crops exhibit stronger disease effects than late sown crops. The most important disease is ''Fusarium'' wilt, resulting in yield losses up to 80%.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> ''Fusarium'' is seed- or soil-borne and it requires distinct soil temperatures for development of epidemics.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> Inadequate fertilization might favour ''Fusarium'' epidemics.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" />  Cumin blight (''Alternaria'') appears in the form of dark brown spots on leaves and stems.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> When the weather is cloudy after flowering, the incidence of the disease is increased.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> Another, but less important, disease is powdery mildew. Incidence of powdery mildew in early development can cause drastic yield losses because no seeds are formed.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> Later in development, powdery mildew causes discoloured, small seeds.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" />\n\nPathogens can lead to high reductions in crop yield. Cumin can be attacked by aphids (''[[Myzus persicae]]'') at the flowering stage. They suck the sap of the plant from tender parts and flowers. The plant becomes yellow, the seed formation is reduced (yield reduction), and the quality of the harvested product decreases. Heavily infested plant parts should be removed. Other important pests are the mites (''Petrobia latens'') which frequently attack the crop. Since the mites mostly feed on young leaves, the infestation is more severe on young inflorescences.\n\nThe open canopy of cumin is another problem. Only a low proportion of the incoming light is absorbed. The [[leaf area index]] of cumin is low (about 1.5). This might be a problem because weeds can compete with cumin for essential resources such as water and light and thereby lower yield. The slow growth and a short stature of cumin favours weed competition additionally.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> Two hoeing and weeding sessions (30 and 60 days after sowing) are needed for the control of weeds. During the first weeding session (30 days after sowing), thinning should be done, as well, to remove excess plants. The use of preplant or pre-emergence herbicides is very effective in India,<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> but this kind of herbicide application requires soil moisture for a successful weed control.\n<!-- how-to, not encyclopedic \n'''Fertilization recommendations in India<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" />'''\n* {{convert|20|kg/ha|abbr=on}} of phosphate (sowing)\n* {{convert|30|kg/ha|abbr=on}} of nitrogen, either\n**single dose (30 days after sowing) or\n**two doses (30 and 60 days after sowing)\n[[File:CuminEssOil.png|thumb|upright|Cumin essential oil in clear glass vial]]\n\n'''Fertilization recommendations in Syria<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" />'''\n* {{convert|50|kg|abbr=on}}{{clarify|date=March 2014}} of triple super phosphate (at planting)\n* 50&nbsp;kg of  urea (at planting) -->\n\n{{Nutritional value\n| name            = Cumin seed\n| image           = \n| caption         = \n| serving_size    = 100 g\n| kJ              = 1567\n| carbs           = 44.24 g\n| starch          = \n| sugars          = 2.25 g\n| fibre           = 10.5 g\n| fat             = 22.27 g\n| satfat          = 1.535 g\n| transfat        = \n| monofat         = 14.04 g\n| polyfat         = 3.279 g\n| omega3fat       = \n| omega6fat       = \n| protein         = 17.81 g\n| water           = 8.06 g\n| vitA_ug         = 64\n| vitA_iu         = 1270\n| betacarotene_ug = 762\n| lutein_ug       = \n| thiamin_mg      = 0.628\n| riboflavin_mg   = 0.327\n| niacin_mg       = 4.579\n| pantothenic_mg  = \n| vitB6_mg        = 0.435\n| folate_ug       = 10\n| vitB12_ug       = 0\n| choline_mg      = 24.7\n| vitC_mg         = 7.7\n| vitD_ug         = 0\n| vitD_iu         = 0\n| vitE_mg         = 3.33\n| vitK_ug         = 5.4\n| calcium_mg      = 931\n| iron_mg         = 66.36\n| magnesium_mg    = 931\n| manganese_mg    = 3.333\n| phosphorus_mg   = 499\n| potassium_mg    = 1788\n| sodium_mg       = 168\n| zinc_mg         = 4.8\n| note            = Reference<ref name=USDA>{{cite web|title=Cumin Seed|url=https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list?qlookup=02014&format=|publisher=National Nutrient Database, United States Department of Agriculture|date=2017|accessdate=24 February 2018}}</ref>\n| source          = \n| source_usda     = 1\n| noRDA           = \n| float           = \n}}\n\n== Breeding ==\nCumin is a diploid species with 14 chromosomes (i.e. 2n = 14). The chromosomes of the different varieties have morphological similarities with no distinct variation in length and volume. Most of the varieties available today are selections.<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> The variabilities of yield and yield components are high. Varieties are developed by sib mating in enclosed chambers<ref name=\"Sastry_Anandaraj\" /> or by biotechnology.\nCumin is a cross-pollinator, i.e. the breeds are already hybrids. Therefore, methods used for breeding are ''in vitro'' regenerations, DNA technologies, and gene transfers. The ''[[in vitro]]'' cultivation of cumin allows the production of genetically identical plants. The main sources for the explants used ''in vitro'' regenerations are embryos, hypocotyl, shoot internodes, leaves, and cotyledons.\nOne goal of cumin breeding is to improve its resistance to biotic (fungal diseases) and abiotic (cold, drought, salinity) stresses. The potential genetic variability for conventional breeding of cumin is limited and research about cumin genetics is scarce.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ebrahimie E, Habashi AA, Ghareyazie B, Ghannadha M, Mohammadie M | title = A rapid and efficient method for regeneration of plantlets from embryo explants of cumin (Cuminum cyminum) | journal = Plant Cell, Tissue and Organ Culture | year = 2003 | volume = 75 | pages = 19\u201325 }}</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\n\nCumin seed is used as a spice for its distinctive flavour and aroma.<ref name=eb/><ref name=nabhan/> Cumin can be found in some cheeses, such as [[Leyden cheese]], and in some traditional breads from France.
