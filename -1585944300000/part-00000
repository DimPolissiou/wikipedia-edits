It stars [[Ben Affleck]],  [[Kate Beckinsale]], [[Josh Hartnett]], [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]], [[Tom Sizemore]], [[Jon Voight]], [[Colm Feore]], and [[Alec Baldwin]]. The film presented a heavily fictionalized version of the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, focusing on a love story set amidst the lead up to the attack, its aftermath, and the [[Doolittle Raid]].\n\nThe film was a box office success, earning $59 million in its opening weekend and, in the end, nearly $450 million worldwide,<ref name=\"BOM\" /> but received generally negative reviews from critics, who criticized the direction, story, screenplay and dialogue, pacing, performances and historical inaccuracies; the bombing sequence, musical score and visual effects were praised.  It was nominated for four [[Academy Awards]], winning in the category of [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]]. However, it was also nominated for six [[Golden Raspberry Awards]], including [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]]. This marked the first occurrence of a Worst Picture-nominated film winning an Academy Award.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1923 [[Tennessee]], two best friends, Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker, play together in the back of an old [[biplane]], pretending to be soldiers fighting the [[German Empire]] in [[World War I]]. When Danny's drunk father comes and attacks Danny, Rafe defends him and calls Danny's father a \"dirty German\", in which he reveals that he fought the Germans in France during World War I and prays the boys never encounter the horrors he saw.\n\nIn January 1941, with [[World War II]] raging, Danny and Rafe are both First Lieutenants under the command of Major [[Jimmy Doolittle]]. Doolittle informs Rafe that he has been accepted into the [[Eagle Squadron]], a [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] outfit for American pilots during the [[Battle of Britain]]. Rafe meets a nurse named Evelyn, who passes his medical exam despite his [[dyslexia]]. That night, Rafe and Evelyn enjoy an evening of dancing at a nightclub and later, a jaunt in the New York harbor in a borrowed police boat. Rafe shocks Evelyn by saying that he has joined the Eagle Squadron and is leaving the next day. During a mission to intercept a [[Luftwaffe]] bombing raid, Rafe is shot down over the English Channel and is presumed killed in action. A mourning Evelyn finds comfort in Danny, leading to a romance between the two, and they take a romantic night in an army plane up in the clouds, and a romantic swim at the beach. Meanwhile, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] begins to plot a surprise attack on the Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor after the US had cut off their oil supply. They send in spies to survey the naval ships and airfields, modify aerial torpedoes for the shallow harbor, and send a series of confusing messages that expressing a hope for peace.\n\nOn the night of December 6, Evelyn is shocked to discover Rafe standing outside her door, having survived his downing and been picked up by a French fishing boat and spending the ensuing months trapped in Nazi-occupied France. Rafe, in turn, discovers Danny's romance with Evelyn and leaves for the Hula bar feeling betrayed, where he is welcomed back by his overjoyed fellow pilots. Danny finds a drunken Rafe in the bar with the intention of making things right, but the two get into a fight. They drive away, avoiding being put in the brig when the military police arrive at the Hula bar.\n\nThe next morning, on December 7, the Imperial Japanese Navy begins its [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The US Pacific Fleet suffers severe damage in the surprise attack, and most of the defending airfields are obliterated before they are able to launch fighters to defend the harbor. Rafe and Danny manage to take off in [[P-40]] fighter planes, and are able to shoot down several of the attacking planes. They later assist in the rescue of the crew of the capsized {{USS|Oklahoma|BB-37|6}}, but are too late to save the crew of the sinking {{USS|Arizona|BB-39|6}}. Meanwhile, Evelyn and the other medical staff are overwhelmed with the amount of wounded and dying patients and one of her fellow nurses, Betty, is listed among the casualties.\n\nThe next day, President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] delivers his [[Infamy Speech|Day of Infamy Speech]] to the nation and requests the US Congress declare a state of war with the [[Empire of Japan]]. Later, Danny and Rafe are both assigned to travel stateside under newly promoted Lt. Colonel Doolittle for a secret mission. Before they leave, Evelyn reveals to Rafe that she is pregnant with Danny's child, and intends to stay with Danny even though she will always love him deep down.\n\nUpon their arrival in California, Danny and Rafe are both promoted to Captain and awarded the [[Silver Star]] for their bravery while shooting down the enemy planes, and volunteer for a secret mission under Doolittle. During the next three months, Rafe, Danny and other pilots train with specially modified [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25 Mitchell]] bombers. In April, the raiders are sent towards Japan aboard the {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|6}}. Their mission: [[Doolittle raid|bomb Tokyo]] and land in [[Nationalist Government|allied China]] after. The mission is successful, and Rafe and Danny crash-land into a rice field in China where [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese]] soldiers are present. Danny is shot in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|crossfire]]. Rafe reveals Evelyn's pregnancy to the dying Danny who tells Rafe that he will have to be the father. After the war, Rafe and Evelyn, now a couple, visit Danny's grave with Danny and Evelyn's son, also named Danny, at Rafe's father's old farm house. Rafe then asks his stepson if he would like to go flying, and they fly off into the sunset in the old biplane that he and his father once had.\n\n==Cast==\n\n=== Fictional characters ===\n{{div col}}\n*[[Ben Affleck]] as the [[First lieutenant|First Lieutenant]] (later Captain) Rafe McCawley, a [[United States Army Air Corps|USAAC]] combat pilot and one of the three protagonists.\n**[[Jesse James (actor)|Jesse James]] as young Rafe McCawley\n*[[Josh Hartnett]] as First Lieutenant (later Captain) Daniel \"Danny\" Walker, a [[United States Army Air Corps|USAAC]]  combat pilot and Rafe's lifelong best friend, one of the three protagonists.\n**[[Reiley McClendon]] as young Danny Walker\n*[[Kate Beckinsale]] as [[Lieutenant]] Evelyn Johnson, a nurse and Rafe and Danny's mutual love interest, one of the three protagonists.\n*[[Tom Sizemore]] as [[Sergeant]] Earl Sistern, the lead aircraft [[mechanic]] at [[Wheeler Army Airfield|Wheeler Airfield]].\n*[[Jaime King]] as Betty Bayer, a nurse at [[Tripler Army Medical Center|Tripler Army Hospital]] and colleague of Evelyn's.\n*[[Catherine Kellner]] as Barbara, a nurse at [[Tripler Army Medical Center|Tripler Army Hospital]] and colleague of Evelyn's.\n*[[Jennifer Garner]] as Sandra, a nurse at [[Tripler Army Medical Center|Tripler Army Hospital]] and colleague of Evelyn's.\n*[[William Lee Scott]] as [[First lieutenant#United States|First Lieutenant]] Billy Thompson, a [[United States Army Air Corps|USAAC]]  combat pilot stationed at [[Wheeler Army Airfield|Wheeler Airfield]].\n*[[Ewen Bremner]] as First Lieutenant Red Winkle, a [[United States Army Air Corps|USAAC]]  combat pilot stationed at [[Wheeler Army Airfield|Wheeler Airfield]].\n*Greg Zola as First Lieutenant Anthony Fusco, a [[United States Army Air Corps|USAAC]] combat pilot stationed at [[Wheeler Army Airfield|Wheeler Airfield]].\n*[[Michael Shannon]] as First Lieutenant Gooz Wood, a [[United States Army Air Corps|USAAC]] combat pilot stationed at [[Wheeler Army Airfield|Wheeler Airfield]].\n*[[Matthew Davis|Matt Davis]] as Second Lieutenant Joe McKinnon, a [[United States Army Air Corps|USAAC]] combat pilot stationed at [[Wheeler Army Airfield|Wheeler Airfield]].\n*[[Dan Aykroyd]] as Captain Harold Thurman, a [[US Naval Intelligence]] officer overseeing the monitoring of Japanese espionage efforts.

Also controversial was the effort to change the film's rating from R to PG-13. Bay wanted to graphically portray the horrors of war and was not interested in primarily marketing the final product to a teen and young adult audience. Budget fights continued throughout the planning of the film, with Bay \"walking\" on several occasions. Dick Cook, chairman of Disney at the time, said \"I think ''Pearl Harbor'' was one of the most difficult shoots of modern history.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.gq.com/story/michael-bay-oral-history|title=An Oral History of Transformers Director Michael Bay|last=Fennessey|first=Sean|date=June 27, 2011|work=GQ|access-date=September 24, 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn order to recreate the atmosphere of pre-war Pearl Harbor, the producers staged the film in Hawaii and used current naval facilities. Many active duty military members stationed in Hawaii and members of the local population served as extras during the filming. The set at [[Rosarito Beach]] in the [[Mexican state]] of [[Baja California]] was used for scale model work as required. Formerly the set of ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997), Rosarito was the ideal location to recreate the death throes of the battleships in the Pearl Harbor attack. A large-scale model of the bow section of {{USS|Oklahoma|BB-37|6}} mounted on the world's largest [[gimbal]] produced an authentic rolling and submerging of the doomed battleship. Production Engineer [[Nigel Phelps]] stated that the sequence of the ship rolling out of the water and slapping down would involve one of the \"biggest set elements\" to be staged. Matched with computer generated imagery, the action had to reflect precision and accuracy throughout.<ref>Sunshine and Felix 2001, p. 135.</ref>\n\nThe vessel most seen in the movie was [[USS Lexington (CV-16)|USS Lexington]], representing both USS ''Hornet'' and a Japanese carrier. All aircraft take-offs during the movie were filmed on board the ''Lexington'', a [[museum ship]] in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]]. The aircraft on display were removed for filming and were replaced with film aircraft as well as World War II anti-aircraft turrets. Other ships used in filler scenes included {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|6}},<ref name=Heines>Heines, vienne.

Filming was also done on board the museum battleship {{USS|Texas|BB-35|6}} located near Houston, Texas.\n\n==Release==\n\n===Marketing===\nThe first [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]] was released in 2000 and was shown alongside screenings of ''[[Cast Away]]'' and ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'', with another trailer released in Spring 2001, shown before ''[[Pok\u00e9mon 3: The Movie]]''.\n\nDisney chose to premiere the film inside Pearl Harbor itself, aboard the active nuclear aircraft carrier [[USS John C.

In actuality, the Doolittle raiders had to launch 650 miles off the Japanese coast and after being spotted by only one Japanese patrol boat. In the film, the only raiders shown in the raid are depicted as dropping their bombs on Tokyo, with some of the bomb blasts obliterating entire buildings. In actuality, the Doolittle raiders did bomb Tokyo but also targeted three other industrial cities, and the damage inflicted was minimal.

In the beginning of the movie, a newsreel of 1940 is presented with combat footage in Europe, showing a [[M-26 Pershing]] tank fighting in the city of [[Cologne]], which did not happen until March 1945.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.warhistoryonline.com/war-articles/battlecrete.html|title=The Battle of Crete|first=Russell|last=Hughes|date=December 29, 2015}}</ref> Earlier, a newsreel of the Battle of Britain in 1940 shows a [[Focke Wulf 190]], which did not see active service until 1941.\n\nActor [[Michael Milhoan]] is seen as an army major advising Admiral Kimmel about island air defenses on Oahu. On the morning of the attack, he is seen commanding a radar station. While playing chess he is addressed as \"lieutenant\" but, in a further inconsistency, is seen wearing the insignia of an army captain.\n\nFour {{sclass-|Spruance|destroyer|0}} destroyers tied abreast of each other at their pier are seen being bombed by the Japanese planes, although this class of ship only entered service with the US Navy in the 1970s. The retired ''Iowa''-class battleship USS ''Missouri'' was used to represent USS ''West Virginia'' for [[Doris Miller|Dorie Miller]]'s boxing match. ''West Virginia'' did not have the modernized World War II-era bridge and masts found on newer U.S. battleships until her reconstruction was finished in 1943, while the ''Iowa'' class did not enter service until 1943 onwards. In one shot, the USS ''Arizona'' memorial is briefly visible in the background during a scene taking place several months before the attack. Miller is shown as a Petty Officer Second Class; but he was actually a Petty Officer Third Class.\n\nCountless other technical lapses rankled film critics, such as Bay's decision to paint the Japanese Zero fighters green (most of the aircraft in the attack were painted light gray/white), even though he knew that was historically inaccurate, because he liked the way the aircraft looked and because it would help audiences differentiate the \"good guys from the bad guys\".<ref name=\"Cagle p. 51\">Cagle 2001, p. 51.</ref>\n\nOne of Doolittle's trophies in a display case depicts a model of an [[F-86 Sabre]], which was not flown until 1947.\n\nLate production models of the [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25J]] were used instead of the early B-25B.\n\nSeveral shots of the aircraft carrier {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|6}} depicted it as having an angled flight deck, a technology that was not implemented until after the war, although no U.S. straight flight deck carriers exist anymore. While ''Hornet'' was portrayed by a World War II-era vessel ({{USS|Lexington|CV-16|6}}), ''Hornet'' was a {{sclass-|Yorktown|aircraft carrier|2}} (two members of the ''Yorktown''-class were lost in the war and the survivor was scrapped), whereas ''Lexington'' was a modernized {{sclass-|Essex|aircraft carrier|2}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.military.com/|title=Military and Veteran Benefits, News, Veteran Jobs|website=www.military.com}}</ref> The takeoff sequences for the [[Doolittle Raid]] were filmed on {{USS|Constellation|CV-64|6}}, a {{sclass-|Kitty Hawk|aircraft carrier|2}} which did not enter service until 1961. As a supercarrier, ''Constellation'' has a much longer flight deck than the ''Yorktown'' or ''Essex''-class carriers, giving the B-25s a substantially longer (and safer) takeoff run.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.moviemistakes.com/film964|title=Pearl Harbor (2001) movie mistakes, goofs and bloopers|website=www.moviemistakes.com}}</ref> The Japanese carriers are portrayed more correctly by comparison&mdash;, {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Akagi||2}} and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiry\u016b||2}} did have their bridge/conning tower superstructure on the port side rather than the more common starboard configuration. In the movie it was done by maneuvering an ''Essex''-class aircraft carrier backwards to act as ''Akagi''.\n\nAn establishing shot of the [[US Department of War]] building is clearly a shot of the exterior of the [[US Capitol Building]]. In 1941, the War Department was housed in the War Department Building in Washington's [[Foggy Bottom]] neighborhood (renamed the [[Harry S Truman Building]] in 2000) and in the [[Munitions Building]] on the [[National Mall]]. Neither structure bears any architectural resemblance to the building shown in the film.\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe soundtrack for the 2004 film ''[[Team America: World Police]]'' contains a song entitled \"End of an Act\". The song's chorus recounts, \"''Pearl Harbor'' sucked, and I miss you\" equating the singer's longing for his girlfriend to how much \"Michael Bay missed the mark when he made ''Pearl Harbor''\" which is \"an awful lot, girl\". The ballad contains other common criticisms of the film, concluding with the [[rhetorical question]] \"Why does Michael Bay get to keep on making movies?\"<ref>[http://www.lyricsbox.com/team-america-lyrics-pearl-harbor-qq12chv.html \"Team America: End of an act lyrics.\"] ''lyricsbox.com''.

It stars [[Ben Affleck]],  [[Kate Beckinsale]], [[Josh Hartnett]], [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]], [[Tom Sizemore]], [[Jon Voight]], [[Colm Feore]], and [[Alec Baldwin]]. The film presented a heavily fictionalized version of the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, focusing on a love story set amidst the lead up to the attack, its aftermath, and the [[Doolittle Raid]].\n\nThe film was a box office success, earning $59 million in its opening weekend and, in the end, nearly $450 million worldwide,<ref name=\"BOM\" /> but received generally negative reviews from critics, who criticized the story, screenplay and dialogue, pacing, performances and historical inaccuracies. It was nominated for four [[Academy Awards]], winning in the category of [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]]. However, it was also nominated for six [[Golden Raspberry Awards]], including [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]]. This marked the first occurrence of a Worst Picture-nominated film winning an Academy Award.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1923 [[Tennessee]], two best friends, Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker, play together in the back of an old [[biplane]], pretending to be soldiers fighting the [[German Empire]] in [[World War I]]. When Danny's drunk father comes and attacks Danny, Rafe defends him and calls Danny's father a \"dirty German\", in which he reveals that he fought the Germans in France during World War I and prays the boys never encounter the horrors he saw.\n\nIn January 1941, with [[World War II]] raging, Danny and Rafe are both First Lieutenants under the command of Major [[Jimmy Doolittle]]. Doolittle informs Rafe that he has been accepted into the [[Eagle Squadron]], a [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] outfit for American pilots during the [[Battle of Britain]]. Rafe meets a nurse named Evelyn, who passes his medical exam despite his [[dyslexia]]. That night, Rafe and Evelyn enjoy an evening of dancing at a nightclub and later, a jaunt in the New York harbor in a borrowed police boat. Rafe shocks Evelyn by saying that he has joined the Eagle Squadron and is leaving the next day. During a mission to intercept a [[Luftwaffe]] bombing raid, Rafe is shot down over the English Channel and is presumed killed in action. A mourning Evelyn finds comfort in Danny, leading to a romance between the two, and they take a romantic night in an army plane up in the clouds, and a romantic swim at the beach. Meanwhile, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] begins to plot a surprise attack on the Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor after the US had cut off their oil supply. They send in spies to survey the naval ships and airfields, modify aerial torpedoes for the shallow harbor, and send a series of confusing messages that expressing a hope for peace.\n\nOn the night of December 6, Evelyn is shocked to discover Rafe standing outside her door, having survived his downing and been picked up by a French fishing boat and spending the ensuing months trapped in Nazi-occupied France. Rafe, in turn, discovers Danny's romance with Evelyn and leaves for the Hula bar feeling betrayed, where he is welcomed back by his overjoyed fellow pilots. Danny finds a drunken Rafe in the bar with the intention of making things right, but the two get into a fight. They drive away, avoiding being put in the brig when the military police arrive at the Hula bar.\n\nThe next morning, on December 7, the Imperial Japanese Navy begins its [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The US Pacific Fleet suffers severe damage in the surprise attack, and most of the defending airfields are obliterated before they are able to launch fighters to defend the harbor. Rafe and Danny manage to take off in [[P-40]] fighter planes, and are able to shoot down several of the attacking planes. They later assist in the rescue of the crew of the capsized {{USS|Oklahoma|BB-37|6}}, but are too late to save the crew of the sinking {{USS|Arizona|BB-39|6}}. Meanwhile, Evelyn and the other medical staff are overwhelmed with the amount of wounded and dying patients and one of her fellow nurses, Betty, is listed among the casualties.\n\nThe next day, President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] delivers his [[Infamy Speech|Day of Infamy Speech]] to the nation and requests the US Congress declare a state of war with the [[Empire of Japan]]. Later, Danny and Rafe are both assigned to travel stateside under newly promoted Lt. Colonel Doolittle for a secret mission. Before they leave, Evelyn reveals to Rafe that she is pregnant with Danny's child, and intends to stay with Danny even though she will always love him deep down.\n\nUpon their arrival in California, Danny and Rafe are both promoted to Captain and awarded the [[Silver Star]] for their bravery while shooting down the enemy planes, and volunteer for a secret mission under Doolittle. During the next three months, Rafe, Danny and other pilots train with specially modified [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25 Mitchell]] bombers. In April, the raiders are sent towards Japan aboard the {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|6}}. Their mission: [[Doolittle raid|bomb Tokyo]] and land in [[Nationalist Government|allied China]] after. The mission is successful, and Rafe and Danny crash-land into a rice field in China where [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese]] soldiers are present. Danny is shot in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|crossfire]]. Rafe reveals Evelyn's pregnancy to the dying Danny who tells Rafe that he will have to be the father. After the war, Rafe and Evelyn, now a couple, visit Danny's grave with Danny and Evelyn's son, also named Danny, at Rafe's father's old farm house. Rafe then asks his stepson if he would like to go flying, and they fly off into the sunset in the old biplane that he and his father once had.\n\n==Cast==\n\n=== Fictional characters ===\n{{div col}}\n*[[Ben Affleck]] as the [[First lieutenant|First Lieutenant]] (later Captain) Rafe McCawley, a [[United States Army Air Corps|USAAC]] combat pilot and one of the three protagonists.\n**[[Jesse James (actor)|Jesse James]] as young Rafe McCawley\n*[[Josh Hartnett]] as First Lieutenant (later Captain) Daniel \"Danny\" Walker, a [[United States Army Air Corps|USAAC]]  combat pilot and Rafe's lifelong best friend, one of the three protagonists.\n**[[Reiley McClendon]] as young Danny Walker\n*[[Kate Beckinsale]] as [[Lieutenant]] Evelyn Johnson, a nurse and Rafe and Danny's mutual love interest, one of the three protagonists.\n*[[Tom Sizemore]] as [[Sergeant]] Earl Sistern, the lead aircraft [[mechanic]] at [[Wheeler Army Airfield|Wheeler Airfield]].\n*[[Jaime King]] as Betty Bayer, a nurse at [[Tripler Army Medical Center|Tripler Army Hospital]] and colleague of Evelyn's.\n*[[Catherine Kellner]] as Barbara, a nurse at [[Tripler Army Medical Center|Tripler Army Hospital]] and colleague of Evelyn's.\n*[[Jennifer Garner]] as Sandra, a nurse at [[Tripler Army Medical Center|Tripler Army Hospital]] and colleague of Evelyn's.\n*[[William Lee Scott]] as [[First lieutenant#United States|First Lieutenant]] Billy Thompson, a [[United States Army Air Corps|USAAC]]  combat pilot stationed at [[Wheeler Army Airfield|Wheeler Airfield]].\n*[[Ewen Bremner]] as First Lieutenant Red Winkle, a [[United States Army Air Corps|USAAC]]  combat pilot stationed at [[Wheeler Army Airfield|Wheeler Airfield]].\n*Greg Zola as First Lieutenant Anthony Fusco, a [[United States Army Air Corps|USAAC]] combat pilot stationed at [[Wheeler Army Airfield|Wheeler Airfield]].\n*[[Michael Shannon]] as First Lieutenant Gooz Wood, a [[United States Army Air Corps|USAAC]] combat pilot stationed at [[Wheeler Army Airfield|Wheeler Airfield]].\n*[[Matthew Davis|Matt Davis]] as Second Lieutenant Joe McKinnon, a [[United States Army Air Corps|USAAC]] combat pilot stationed at [[Wheeler Army Airfield|Wheeler Airfield]].\n*[[Dan Aykroyd]] as Captain Harold Thurman, a [[US Naval Intelligence]] officer overseeing the monitoring of Japanese espionage efforts.

Also controversial was the effort to change the film's rating from R to PG-13. Bay wanted to graphically portray the horrors of war and was not interested in primarily marketing the final product to a teen and young adult audience. Budget fights continued throughout the planning of the film, with Bay \"walking\" on several occasions. Dick Cook, chairman of Disney at the time, said \"I think ''Pearl Harbor'' was one of the most difficult shoots of modern history.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.gq.com/story/michael-bay-oral-history|title=An Oral History of Transformers Director Michael Bay|last=Fennessey|first=Sean|date=June 27, 2011|work=GQ|access-date=September 24, 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn order to recreate the atmosphere of pre-war Pearl Harbor, the producers staged the film in Hawaii and used current naval facilities. Many active duty military members stationed in Hawaii and members of the local population served as extras during the filming. The set at [[Rosarito Beach]] in the [[Mexican state]] of [[Baja California]] was used for scale model work as required. Formerly the set of ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997), Rosarito was the ideal location to recreate the death throes of the battleships in the Pearl Harbor attack. A large-scale model of the bow section of {{USS|Oklahoma|BB-37|6}} mounted on the world's largest [[gimbal]] produced an authentic rolling and submerging of the doomed battleship. Production Engineer [[Nigel Phelps]] stated that the sequence of the ship rolling out of the water and slapping down would involve one of the \"biggest set elements\" to be staged. Matched with computer generated imagery, the action had to reflect precision and accuracy throughout.<ref>Sunshine and Felix 2001, p. 135.</ref>\n\nThe vessel most seen in the movie was [[USS Lexington (CV-16)|USS Lexington]], representing both USS ''Hornet'' and a Japanese carrier. All aircraft take-offs during the movie were filmed on board the ''Lexington'', a [[museum ship]] in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]]. The aircraft on display were removed for filming and were replaced with film aircraft as well as World War II anti-aircraft turrets. Other ships used in filler scenes included {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|6}},<ref name=Heines>Heines, vienne.

In actuality, the Doolittle raiders had to launch 650 miles off the Japanese coast and after being spotted by only one Japanese patrol boat. In the film, the only raiders shown in the raid are depicted as dropping their bombs on Tokyo, with some of the bomb blasts obliterating entire buildings. In actuality, the Doolittle raiders did bomb Tokyo but also targeted three other industrial cities, and the damage inflicted was minimal.

In the beginning of the movie, a newsreel of 1940 is presented with combat footage in Europe, showing a [[M-26 Pershing]] tank fighting in the city of [[Cologne]], which did not happen until March 1945.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.warhistoryonline.com/war-articles/battlecrete.html|title=The Battle of Crete|first=Russell|last=Hughes|date=December 29, 2015}}</ref> Earlier, a newsreel of the Battle of Britain in 1940 shows a [[Focke Wulf 190]], which did not see active service until 1941.\n\nActor [[Michael Milhoan]] is seen as an army major advising Admiral Kimmel about island air defenses on Oahu. On the morning of the attack, he is seen commanding a radar station. While playing chess he is addressed as \"lieutenant\" but, in a further inconsistency, is seen wearing the insignia of an army captain.\n\nFour {{sclass-|Spruance|destroyer|0}} destroyers tied abreast of each other at their pier are seen being bombed by the Japanese planes, although this class of ship only entered service with the US Navy in the 1970s. The retired ''Iowa''-class battleship USS ''Missouri'' was used to represent USS ''West Virginia'' for [[Doris Miller|Dorie Miller]]'s boxing match. ''West Virginia'' did not have the modernized World War II-era bridge and masts found on newer U.S. battleships until her reconstruction was finished in 1943, while the ''Iowa'' class did not enter service until 1943 onwards. In one shot, the USS ''Arizona'' memorial is briefly visible in the background during a scene taking place several months before the attack. Miller is shown as a Petty Officer Second Class; but he was actually a Petty Officer Third Class.\n\nCountless other technical lapses rankled film critics, such as Bay's decision to paint the Japanese Zero fighters green (most of the aircraft in the attack were painted light gray/white), even though he knew that was historically inaccurate, because he liked the way the aircraft looked and because it would help audiences differentiate the \"good guys from the bad guys\".<ref name=\"Cagle p. 51\">Cagle 2001, p. 51.</ref>\n\nOne of Doolittle's trophies in a display case depicts a model of an [[F-86 Sabre]], which was not flown until 1947.\n\nLate production models of the [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25J]] were used instead of the early B-25B.\n\nSeveral shots of the aircraft carrier {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|6}} depicted it as having an angled flight deck, a technology that was not implemented until after the war, although no U.S. straight flight deck carriers exist anymore. While ''Hornet'' was portrayed by a World War II-era vessel ({{USS|Lexington|CV-16|6}}), ''Hornet'' was a {{sclass-|Yorktown|aircraft carrier|2}} (two members of the ''Yorktown''-class were lost in the war and the survivor was scrapped), whereas ''Lexington'' was a modernized {{sclass-|Essex|aircraft carrier|2}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.military.com/|title=Military and Veteran Benefits, News, Veteran Jobs|website=www.military.com}}</ref> The takeoff sequences for the [[Doolittle Raid]] were filmed on {{USS|Constellation|CV-64|6}}, a {{sclass-|Kitty Hawk|aircraft carrier|2}} which did not enter service until 1961. As a supercarrier, ''Constellation'' has a much longer flight deck than the ''Yorktown'' or ''Essex''-class carriers, giving the B-25s a substantially longer (and safer) takeoff run.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.moviemistakes.com/film964|title=Pearl Harbor (2001) movie mistakes, goofs and bloopers|website=www.moviemistakes.com}}</ref> The Japanese carriers are portrayed more correctly by comparison&mdash;, {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Akagi||2}} and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiry\u016b||2}} did have their bridge/conning tower superstructure on the port side rather than the more common starboard configuration. In the movie it was done by maneuvering an ''Essex''-class aircraft carrier backwards to act as ''Akagi''.\n\nAn establishing shot of the [[US Department of War]] building is clearly a shot of the exterior of the [[US Capitol Building]]. In 1941, the War Department was housed in the War Department Building in Washington's [[Foggy Bottom]] neighborhood (renamed the [[Harry S Truman Building]] in 2000) and in the [[Munitions Building]] on the [[National Mall]]. Neither structure bears any architectural resemblance to the building shown in the film.\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe soundtrack for the 2004 film ''[[Team America: World Police]]'' contains a song entitled \"End of an Act\". The song's chorus recounts, \"''Pearl Harbor'' sucked, and I miss you\" equating the singer's longing for his girlfriend to how much \"Michael Bay missed the mark when he made ''Pearl Harbor''\" which is \"an awful lot, girl\". The ballad contains other common criticisms of the film, concluding with the [[rhetorical question]] \"Why does Michael Bay get to keep on making movies?\"<ref>[http://www.lyricsbox.com/team-america-lyrics-pearl-harbor-qq12chv.html \"Team America: End of an act lyrics.\"] ''lyricsbox.com''.

It is one of the oldest suburbs in Kuala Lumpur and consists mainly of historic worship places and schools. Sentul is a mere 10-minute drive to [[Mont Kiara]], [[Wangsa Maju]], [[Kepong]], and downtown [[Kuala Lumpur]] through the [[Duta\u2013Ulu Klang Expressway]] (DUKE) or inner-city roads. \n\n=History=\n\nSentul is a former railway hub famous for its old-world charm, historical temples and prewar shops. In 1904, the Federated Malay States Railway began building a complex of railway maintenance works at Sentul known as the Central Railway Workshops, the largest in Malaya. Here railway carriages were assembled and serviced and the majority of the parts needed were manufactured in the foundry, sawmills and workshops located on this site. In their heyday, the works employed 2,500 people. In 1945, just weeks before the end of World War 2, the workshops were heavily bombed by British B-29 bombers because it was seen as a vital rail complex for the Japanese occupiers. After the war, the workshops were partially rebuilt but never regained their former prominence and many of the former colonial railway buildings were left as hollow shells or ruins.\n\nMost of the early residents in Sentul were Indians working in the train depot and central workshop built by the British, dating back to 1896. The older and larger of the two depots there, known as the Sentul Works, has been operational since 1905. Sprawled over 5.2ha, the railway hub was Malaysia\u2019s largest train depot consisting of numerous brick buildings and metal sheds used for storage. Most of these have been demolished, the western-most brick train shed is retained as the Kuala Lumpur Performing Arts Centre.\n\nSentul was once home to thousands of railway workers, the majority of whom were Indians. They worked in Sentul Works, one of the largest industrial businesses in Malaya. Most of the historical structures in the area have been demolished but a few remain, including the Sentul Cinema, schools and prewar shops. \n\nIn 2002, YTL Land & Development Berhad rolled out its Sentul regeneration plan and has extensively transformed the rundown railway town. Since then, the new Sentul is demarcated into Sentul East, Sentul West and Bandar Baru Sentul. \n\n==Commerce==\nSentul Raya Boulevard serves as the main commercial hub in the heart of Sentul which consists of many banks, eateries, and offices. In Sentul East, there are D6 and D7 offices developed by YTL, which encompasses a more contemporary commercial concept. \n\nSentul Market (a.k.a. Pasar Sentul) is one of the oldest wet markets in the city of [[Kuala Lumpur]]. It is situated at Jalan Sentul Pasar, and it consists of more than 100 stores. The HGH Convention Centre in Sentul is one of the biggest ballrooms in Kuala Lumpur which could accommodate banquets with 2,000 seats or 66 exhibition booths. In Bandar Baru Sentul, there is UTC Sentul to provide public amenities and services for better convenience. \n\nKuala Lumpur Performing Arts Centre (KLPAC) is a multi-award winning space that serves as the main hub for contemporary art in Malaysia. As the only fully-integrated arts centre in Malaysia, it boasts end to end facilities including a 504-seater proscenium theatre, a 200-seater experimental black box theatre, and an academy with 9 studios. Next to KLPAC, there is Sentul Park which is a lush 35-acre private gated community park just off Jalan Ipoh in Kuala Lumpur. In 2019, YTL has opened yet another 200,000 sqft of exhibition space called Sentul Depot that was originally a unique 110-year old colonial Malayan architectural building.\n\n==Education==\n===Primary schools=== \n\n* Chi Man Primary Chinese School \n* St Joseph Tamil Primary School \n* Sekolah Kebangsaan Sentul 1\n* Sekolah Kebangsaan Sentul 2\n* Sekolah Kebangsaan Seri Perak Sentul\n* SJK (C) Peng Ming \n* SJK (C) Sentul Kuala Lumpur \n* SJK (T) Sentul Kuala Lumpur \n* SJK (T) Thamboosamy Pillai \n\n===Secondary schools===\n\n* Convent Sentul Secondary School \n* Methodist Boy School Sentul (MBS Sentul) \n* Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Bandar Baru Sentul\n* Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Maxwell\n* Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan La Selle \n* Sekolah Menengah Sains Seri Puteri\n* Sekolah Menengah Persendirian Chong Hwa\n* Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan (SMK) Sentul Utama \n* Wesley Methodist School Kuala Lumpur \n\n==Places of Worship== \n\nSentul is home to many historic churches, mosques, and Hindu temples in [[Kuala Lumpur]].\n\n===Churches===\n\n* Church of St. Joseph Sentul\n* Grace Methodist Church\n* Ipoh Road Chinese Methodist church\n* Pentecostal Church Malaysia \n* Miracle Chapel\n* St. James' Church Sentul \n\n===Hindu Temples===\n\n* Athi Eeswaran Temple \n* Dewei Sree Karumariamman Temple\n* Sri Muniswaran Temple\n* Sri Jayanti Temple\n* Maha Kaliamman Temple\n\n===Mosques===\n\n* Masjid Al-Hidayah Sentul\n* Masjid Amru Ibni Al'-As Sentul \n* Masjid Pakistan Sentul\n\n==Residential== \n\nThere are many high-rise apartments and condominiums situated around Sentul. \n===YTL Sentul Residences===\n\n* The Capers\n* The Fennel \n* The Maple \n* The Saffron\n* The Tamarind \n\n===High-rise Condominiums===\n\n* 1 Sentul Condomium \n* M Arisa\n* M Centura\n* Maxim Citylights \n* Minest Residence\n* One Maxim \n* Rafflesia Condominum\n* Rica Residence\n* Residensi Sentulmas\n* Sang Suria Condominium \n* Sentul Point\n* Sentul Village\n* SkyAwani 1 Residence\n* SkyMeridien Residence\n* Vista Sentul Residence\n\n==Accessibility==\n\nSentul is easily accessible via the Middle Ring Road 2 (MRR2), Duta-Ulu Kelang Expressway (DUKE), Sultan Iskandar Highway, Jalan Duta-Segambut Highway, and Sentul Link, as well as through arterial roads such as Jalan Pahang, Jalan Ipoh, Jalan Kuching, and Jalan Kepong.
