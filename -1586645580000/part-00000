Sometime in 1918, while Ukraine was under German occupation, the [[rabbi]]s of [[Odessa]] pronounced herem against Trotsky, Zinoviev, and other Jewish [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] leaders in the synagogue.<ref>Zinoviev cynically referred to this in his eulogy of Uritsky (the chief of the Petrograd Cheka, assassinated on August 30, 1918):{{quote|When we read that in Odessa, under [[Skoropadsky family|Skoropadsky]], the rabbis assembled in special council, and there these representatives of the rich Jews, officially, before the entire world, excommunicated from the Jewish community such Jews as Trotsky and me, your obedient servant, and others - no single hair of any of us has turned gray because of grief\"|Zinoviev, Sochineniia, 16:224, quoted in Bezbozhnik [The godless], no. 20 (12 September 1938).}}</ref>\n\n== Summary ==\n\nAlthough developed from the [[Bible|Biblical]] ban, excommunication, as employed by the rabbis during [[Talmud|Talmudic times]] and during the Middle Ages, became a rabbinic institution, the object of which was to preserve Jewish solidarity. A system of laws was gradually developed by rabbis, by means of which this power was limited, so that it became one of the modes of legal punishment by rabbinic courts. While it did not entirely lose its arbitrary character, since individuals were allowed to pronounce the ban of excommunication on particular occasions, it became chiefly a legal measure resorted to by a judicial court for certain prescribed offenses.\n\n== Etymology and cognate terms ==\n\nThe three terms ''herem'' \"censure, excommunication\", [[herem (war or property)|the devotion of enemies by annihilation]]\" in the [[Tanakh]], and [[herem (priestly gift)|the devotion of property]] to a [[kohen]], are all three variant English [[transliteration]]s of the same Hebrew noun. This noun comes from the [[semitic root]] [[\u1e24-R-M]].\n\nThere is also a [[homonym]] ''herem'' \"fisherman's net\", which appears nine times in the [[Masoretic Text]] of the Tanakh, that has no etymological connection to ''herem''.<ref>[[Brown Driver Briggs]] ''Hebrew Lexicon,'' entries ''herem'' 1, ''herem'' 2</ref>\n\nThe Talmudic usage of ''herem'' for excommunication can be distinguished from the usage of ''herem'' described in the Tanakh in the time of [[Joshua]] and the early Hebrew monarchy, which was the practice of consecration by total annihilation<ref>https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124494788&ps=cprs</ref> at the command of God carried out against peoples such as the [[Midian]]ites, the [[Amalek#Amalekites in the Hebrew Bible|Amalekites]], and the entire population of [[Jericho]]. The neglect of [[Saul]] to carry out such a command as delivered by [[Samuel]] resulted in the selection of [[David]] as his replacement.\n\n== Offenses ==\nThe Talmud speaks of twenty-four offenses that, in theory, were punishable by a form of ''[[Niddah#Etymology and usage|niddui]]'' or temporary excommunication. [[Maimonides]] (as well as later authorities) enumerates the twenty-four as follows:<ref>http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/910980/jewish/Talmud-Torah-Chapter-Six.htm</ref>\n# insulting a learned man, even after his death;\n# insulting a messenger of the court;\n# calling a fellow Jew a \"slave\";\n# refusing to appear before the court at the appointed time;\n# dealing lightly with any of the [[Rabbinic Judaism|rabbinic]] or Mosaic precepts;\n# refusing to abide by a decision of the court;\n# keeping in one's possession an animal or an object that may prove injurious to others, such as a savage dog or a broken ladder;\n# selling one's real estate to a non-Jew without assuming the responsibility for any injury that the non-Jew may cause his neighbors;\n# testifying against one's Jewish neighbor in a non-Jewish court, and thereby causing that neighbor to lose money which he would not have lost had the case been decided in a Jewish court;\n# a kohen [[shechita|shochet]] (butcher)<ref>[[Eliezer ben Joel HaLevi|Raaviah]] to Chullin chap. 1225, [[Meir of Rothenburg]] responsa 7 (mossad horav kook vol. 2 p. 11</ref> who refuses to give the [[foreleg, cheeks and maw]] of [[kashrut|kosher-slaughtered]] livestock to another kohen;\n# violating the second day of a holiday, even though its observance is only a custom;\n# performing work on the afternoon of the day preceding Passover;\n# taking the name of God in vain;\n# causing others to profane the name of God;\n# causing others to eat holy meat outside of Jerusalem;\n# making calculations for the calendar, and establishing festivals accordingly, outside of Israel;\n# putting a stumbling-block in the way of the blind, that is to say, tempting another to sin ([[Lifnei iver]]);\n# preventing the community from performing some religious act;\n# selling forbidden (\"[[terefah]]\") meat as permitted meat (\"kosher\");\n# failure by a shochet to show his knife to the rabbi for examination;\n# purposely bringing oneself to erection;\n# engaging in business with one's divorced wife that will lead them to come into contact with each other;\n# being made the subject of scandal (in the case of a rabbi);\n# declaring an unjustified excommunication.\n\n== The niddui ==\n\nThe ''[[niddui]]'' ({{Lang-he|\u05e0\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5\u05d9}}) ban was usually imposed for a period of seven days (in Israel thirty days). If inflicted on account of money matters, the offender was first publicly warned (\"hatra'ah\") three times, on Monday, Thursday, and Monday successively, at the regular service in the synagogue. During the period of niddui, no one except the members of his immediate household was permitted to associate with the offender, or to sit within four cubits of him, or to eat in his company. He was expected to go into mourning and to refrain from bathing, cutting his hair, and wearing shoes, and he had to observe all the laws that pertained to a mourner. He could not be counted in the [[minyan|quorum for the performance of a public religious function]]. If he died, a stone was placed on his hearse, and the relatives were not obliged to observe the ceremonies customary at the death of a kinsman, such as the tearing of garments, [[Bereavement in Judaism|etc.]].\n\nIt was in the power of the court to lessen or increase the severity of the niddui. The court might even reduce or increase the number of days, forbid all intercourse with the offender, and exclude his children from the schools and his wife from the synagogue, until he became humbled and willing to repent and obey the court's mandates. According to one opinion, the apprehension that the offender might leave the Jewish fold on account of the severity of the excommunication did not prevent the court from adding [[rigor]] to its punishments so as to maintain its dignity and authority ([[Shulkhan Arukh]], [[Yoreh De'ah]], 334, 1, [[Moses Isserles|Rama's]] [[Gloss (transliteration)|gloss]], citing ''[[Alexander Susslein|Sefer Agudah]]''). This opinion is vehemently contested by the [[David HaLevi Segal|Taz]] (ibid.), who cites earlier authorities of the same opinion ([[Solomon Luria|Maharshal]]; [[Meir of Rothenburg|Maharam]]; [[Judah ben Eliezer ha-Levi Minz|Mahari Mintz]]) and presents proof of his position from the Talmud. Additionally, the Taz notes that his edition of the ''Sefer Agudah'' does not contain the cited position.\n\n== The herem ==\n\nIf the offense was in reference to monetary matters, or if the punishment was inflicted by an individual, the laws were more lenient, the chief punishment being that men might not associate with the offender. At the expiration of the period the ban was raised by the court. If, however, the excommunicate showed no sign of penitence or remorse, the niddui might be renewed once and again, and finally the \"herem,\" the most rigorous form of excommunication, might be pronounced. This extended for an indefinite period, and no one was permitted to teach the offender or work for him, or benefit him in any way, except when he was in need of the bare necessities of life.\n\n== The nezifah ==\n\nA milder form than either niddui or herem was the \"nezifah\" ban. (In modern Hebrew, \"nezifah\" generally means \"a dressing-down\" or \"reading (someone) the riot act\", i.e., a stern verbal rebuke.) This ban generally only lasted one day. During this time the offender dared not appear before him whom he had displeased. He had to retire to his house, speak little, refrain from business and pleasure, and manifest his regret and remorse. He was not required, however, to separate himself from society, nor was he obliged to apologize to the man whom he had insulted; for his conduct on the day of nezifah was sufficient apology. But when a scholar or prominent man actually pronounced the formal niddui on one who had slighted him, all the laws of niddui applied. This procedure was, however, much discouraged by the sages, so that it was a matter of proper pride for a rabbi to be able to say that he had never pronounced the ban of excommunication. Maimonides concludes with these words the chapter on the laws of excommunication:(''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', Talmud Torah, vii. 13).\n\n: \"Although the power is given to the scholar to excommunicate a man who has slighted him, it is not praiseworthy for him to employ this means too frequently. He should rather shut his ears to the words of the ignorant and pay no attention to them, as Solomon, in his wisdom, said, 'Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken' (Eccl. vii. 21). This was the custom of the early pious men, who would not answer when they heard themselves insulted, but would forgive the insolent. . . . But this humility should be practised only when the insult occurs in private; when the scholar is publicly insulted, he dares not forgive; and if he forgive he should be punished, for then it is an insult to the Torah that he must revenge until the offender humbly apologizes\"\n\n== Since the Jewish Enlightenment ==\nExcept in rare cases in the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] and Hasidic communities, ''herem'' stopped existing after the [[Haskalah]], when local Jewish communities lost their political autonomy, and Jews were integrated into the gentile nations in which they lived.<ref>{{cite newspaper |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]\n|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/books/review/steven-weisman-chosen-wars.html\n|title=American Jews Face a Choice: Create Meaning or Fade Away\n|author=Gal Beckerman |date=November 12, 2018}}</ref>\n* In 1918, the Rabbinical Council of [[Odessa]], declared ''herem'' on [[Leon Trotsky]] and several other Jewish [[Bolsheviks]].<ref>{{cite newspaper\n |newspaper=[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|The Jewish Journal]]\n |url=https://jewishjournal.org/2019/04/04/letter-a-time-to-excommunicate\n |title=Letter: A time to excommunicate\n |quote=in 1918 the Odessa rabbis excommunicated Leon Trotsky\n |date=April 4, 2019}}</ref>\n* In 1945, rabbi [[Mordecai Kaplan]], the founder of [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] (a Jewish religious movement that seeks to divorce Judaism from belief in a personal deity), was formally excommunicated by the Haredi [[Union of Orthodox Rabbis]] (''Agudath HaRabonim'').<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.jta.org/1945/06/14/archive/prof-mordecai-m-kaplan-excommunicated-by-orthodox-rabbis-his-prayer-book-burned\n |title=Prof. Mordecai M.

Sometime in 1918, while Ukraine was under German occupation, the [[rabbi]]s of [[Odessa]] pronounced herem against Trotsky, Zinoviev, and other Jewish [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] leaders in the synagogue.<ref>Zinoviev cynically referred to this in his eulogy of Uritsky (the chief of the Petrograd Cheka, assassinated on August 30, 1918):{{quote|When we read that in Odessa, under [[Skoropadsky family|Skoropadsky]], the rabbis assembled in special council, and there these representatives of the rich Jews, officially, before the entire world, excommunicated from the Jewish community such Jews as Trotsky and me, your obedient servant, and others - no single hair of any of us has turned gray because of grief\"|Zinoviev, Sochineniia, 16:224, quoted in Bezbozhnik [The godless], no. 20 (12 September 1938).}}</ref>\n\n== Summary ==\n\nAlthough developed from the [[Bible|Biblical]] ban, excommunication, as employed by the rabbis during [[Talmud|Talmudic times]] and during the Middle Ages, became a rabbinic institution, the object of which was to preserve Jewish solidarity. A system of laws was gradually developed by rabbis, by means of which this power was limited, so that it became one of the modes of legal punishment by rabbinic courts. While it did not entirely lose its arbitrary character, since individuals were allowed to pronounce the ban of excommunication on particular occasions, it became chiefly a legal measure resorted to by a judicial court for certain prescribed offenses.\n\n== Etymology and cognate terms ==\n\nThe three terms ''herem'' \"censure, excommunication\", [[herem (war or property)|the devotion of enemies by annihilation]]\" in the [[Tanakh]], and [[herem (priestly gift)|the devotion of property]] to a [[kohen]], are all three variant English [[transliteration]]s of the same Hebrew noun. This noun comes from the [[semitic root]] [[\u1e24-R-M]].\n\nThere is also a [[homonym]] ''herem'' \"fisherman's net\", which appears nine times in the [[Masoretic Text]] of the Tanakh, that has no etymological connection to ''herem''.<ref>[[Brown Driver Briggs]] ''Hebrew Lexicon,'' entries ''herem'' 1, ''herem'' 2</ref>\n\nThe Talmudic usage of ''herem'' for excommunication can be distinguished from the usage of ''herem'' described in the Tanakh in the time of [[Joshua]] and the early Hebrew monarchy, which was the practice of consecration by total annihilation<ref>https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124494788&ps=cprs</ref> at the command of God carried out against peoples such as the [[Midian]]ites, the [[Amalek#Amalekites in the Hebrew Bible|Amalekites]], and the entire population of [[Jericho]]. The neglect of [[Saul]] to carry out such a command as delivered by [[Samuel]] resulted in the selection of [[David]] as his replacement.\n\n== Offenses ==\nThe Talmud speaks of twenty-four offenses that, in theory, were punishable by a form of ''[[Niddah#Etymology and usage|niddui]]'' or temporary excommunication. [[Maimonides]] (as well as later authorities) enumerates the twenty-four as follows:<ref>http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/910980/jewish/Talmud-Torah-Chapter-Six.htm</ref>\n# insulting a learned man, even after his death;\n# insulting a messenger of the court;\n# calling a fellow Jew a \"slave\";\n# refusing to appear before the court at the appointed time;\n# dealing lightly with any of the [[Rabbinic Judaism|rabbinic]] or Mosaic precepts;\n# refusing to abide by a decision of the court;\n# keeping in one's possession an animal or an object that may prove injurious to others, such as a savage dog or a broken ladder;\n# selling one's real estate to a non-Jew without assuming the responsibility for any injury that the non-Jew may cause his neighbors;\n# testifying against one's Jewish neighbor in a non-Jewish court, and thereby causing that neighbor to lose money which he would not have lost had the case been decided in a Jewish court;\n# a kohen [[shechita|shochet]] (butcher)<ref>[[Eliezer ben Joel HaLevi|Raaviah]] to Chullin chap. 1225, [[Meir of Rothenburg]] responsa 7 (mossad horav kook vol. 2 p. 11</ref> who refuses to give the [[foreleg, cheeks and maw]] of [[kashrut|kosher-slaughtered]] livestock to another kohen;\n# violating the second day of a holiday, even though its observance is only a custom;\n# performing work on the afternoon of the day preceding Passover;\n# taking the name of God in vain;\n# causing others to profane the name of God;\n# causing others to eat holy meat outside of Jerusalem;\n# making calculations for the calendar, and establishing festivals accordingly, outside of Israel;\n# putting a stumbling-block in the way of the blind, that is to say, tempting another to sin ([[Lifnei iver]]);\n# preventing the community from performing some religious act;\n# selling forbidden (\"[[terefah]]\") meat as permitted meat (\"kosher\");\n# failure by a shochet to show his knife to the rabbi for examination;\n# purposely bringing oneself to erection;\n# engaging in business with one's divorced wife that will lead them to come into contact with each other;\n# being made the subject of scandal (in the case of a rabbi);\n# declaring an unjustified excommunication.\n\n== The niddui ==\n\nThe ''[[niddui]]'' ({{Lang-he|\u05e0\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5\u05d9}}) ban was usually imposed for a period of seven days (in Israel thirty days). If inflicted on account of money matters, the offender was first publicly warned (\"hatra'ah\") three times, on Monday, Thursday, and Monday successively, at the regular service in the synagogue. During the period of niddui, no one except the members of his immediate household was permitted to associate with the offender, or to sit within four cubits of him, or to eat in his company. He was expected to go into mourning and to refrain from bathing, cutting his hair, and wearing shoes, and he had to observe all the laws that pertained to a mourner. He could not be counted in the [[minyan|quorum for the performance of a public religious function]]. If he died, a stone was placed on his hearse, and the relatives were not obliged to observe the ceremonies customary at the death of a kinsman, such as the tearing of garments, [[Bereavement in Judaism|etc.]].\n\nIt was in the power of the court to lessen or increase the severity of the niddui. The court might even reduce or increase the number of days, forbid all intercourse with the offender, and exclude his children from the schools and his wife from the synagogue, until he became humbled and willing to repent and obey the court's mandates. According to one opinion, the apprehension that the offender might leave the Jewish fold on account of the severity of the excommunication did not prevent the court from adding [[rigor]] to its punishments so as to maintain its dignity and authority ([[Shulkhan Arukh]], [[Yoreh De'ah]], 334, 1, [[Moses Isserles|Rama's]] [[Gloss (transliteration)|gloss]], citing ''[[Alexander Susslein|Sefer Agudah]]''). This opinion is vehemently contested by the [[David HaLevi Segal|Taz]] (ibid.), who cites earlier authorities of the same opinion ([[Solomon Luria|Maharshal]]; [[Meir of Rothenburg|Maharam]]; [[Judah ben Eliezer ha-Levi Minz|Mahari Mintz]]) and presents proof of his position from the Talmud. Additionally, the Taz notes that his edition of the ''Sefer Agudah'' does not contain the cited position.\n\n== The herem ==\n\nIf the offense was in reference to monetary matters, or if the punishment was inflicted by an individual, the laws were more lenient, the chief punishment being that men might not associate with the offender. At the expiration of the period the ban was raised by the court. If, however, the excommunicate showed no sign of penitence or remorse, the niddui might be renewed once and again, and finally the \"herem,\" the most rigorous form of excommunication, might be pronounced. This extended for an indefinite period, and no one was permitted to teach the offender or work for him, or benefit him in any way, except when he was in need of the bare necessities of life.\n\n== The nezifah ==\n\nA milder form than either niddui or herem was the \"nezifah\" ban. (In modern Hebrew, \"nezifah\" generally means \"a dressing-down\" or \"reading (someone) the riot act\", i.e., a stern verbal rebuke.) This ban generally only lasted one day. During this time the offender dared not appear before him whom he had displeased. He had to retire to his house, speak little, refrain from business and pleasure, and manifest his regret and remorse. He was not required, however, to separate himself from society, nor was he obliged to apologize to the man whom he had insulted; for his conduct on the day of nezifah was sufficient apology. But when a scholar or prominent man actually pronounced the formal niddui on one who had slighted him, all the laws of niddui applied. This procedure was, however, much discouraged by the sages, so that it was a matter of proper pride for a rabbi to be able to say that he had never pronounced the ban of excommunication. Maimonides concludes with these words the chapter on the laws of excommunication:(''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', Talmud Torah, vii. 13).\n\n: \"Although the power is given to the scholar to excommunicate a man who has slighted him, it is not praiseworthy for him to employ this means too frequently. He should rather shut his ears to the words of the ignorant and pay no attention to them, as Solomon, in his wisdom, said, 'Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken' (Eccl. vii. 21). This was the custom of the early pious men, who would not answer when they heard themselves insulted, but would forgive the insolent. . . . But this humility should be practised only when the insult occurs in private; when the scholar is publicly insulted, he dares not forgive; and if he forgive he should be punished, for then it is an insult to the Torah that he must revenge until the offender humbly apologizes\"\n\n== Since the Jewish Enlightenment ==\nExcept in rare cases in the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] and Hasidic communities, ''herem'' stopped existing after the [[Haskalah]], when local Jewish communities lost their political autonomy, and Jews were integrated into the gentile nations in which they lived.<ref>{{cite newspaper |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]\n|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/books/review/steven-weisman-chosen-wars.html\n|title=American Jews Face a Choice: Create Meaning or Fade Away\n|author=Gal Beckerman |date=November 12, 2018}}</ref>\n* In 1918, the Rabbinical Council of [[Odessa]], declared ''herem'' on [[Leon Trotsky]] and several other Jewish [[Bolsheviks]].<ref>{{cite newspaper\n |newspaper=[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|The Jewish Journal]]\n |url=https://jewishjournal.org/2019/04/04/letter-a-time-to-excommunicate\n |title=Letter: A time to excommunicate\n |quote=in 1918 the Odessa rabbis excommunicated Leon Trotsky\n |date=April 4, 2019}}</ref>\n* In 1945, rabbi [[Mordecai Kaplan]], the founder of [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] (a Jewish religious movement that seeks to divorce Judaism from belief in a personal deity), was formally excommunicated by the Haredi [[Union of Orthodox Rabbis]] (''Agudath HaRabonim'').<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.jta.org/1945/06/14/archive/prof-mordecai-m-kaplan-excommunicated-by-orthodox-rabbis-his-prayer-book-burned\n |title=Prof. Mordecai M.

The [[Pileus (mycology)|pileus]] is {{convert|5|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter and has a convex shape, sporting a raised central region (an [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]]).  The pale [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] appears yellowish in the amber, and is smooth and glossy, changing to striate and slightly translucent towards the margin. The pileus margin is striated and slightly flared.  The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] on the underside of the pileus are broadly attached ([[wikt:adnate|adnate]]) to the top of the [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]], and distantly spaced\u2014between six and eight gills extend completely from the pileus margin to the [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]].

The stipe lacks a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] and [[rhizoids]].  The mushroom is preserved with a small liquid and gas-filled bubble, possibly originating from the mushroom itself, which indicates the amber to be very solid and well-sealed.<ref name=\"Hibbettal1997\"/>\n\nIn Hibbett and colleagues' 1997 publication, ''Protomycena'' was placed in the subfamily ''Myceneae'', which at the time was considered part of the family [[Tricholomataceae]];<ref name=\"Kirk2001\"/> ''Mycena'' is currently classified in the family [[Mycenaceae]].<ref name=\"Kirk2008\"/><ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Mycena\"/> The placement was based solely on the visible structures, or [[morphology (biology)|macromorphology]] of the fruit body.  Many of the features which are typically used to [[classification (biology)|classify]] species into fungal [[family (biology)|families]] and subfamilies are based on microscopic features not visible or preserved in the amber specimen. Consequently, the assignment to ''Mycena'' is provisional (the authors also note certain similarities with extant members of ''[[Marasmius]]''), and the describing authors leave open the option of treating the genus placement as ''[[incertae sedis]]'' (uncertain placement) within the [[Agaricales]].

The [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] of the fungus has a convex [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] that is {{convert|5|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, with distantly spaced [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] on the underside. The curved [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is smooth and cylindrical, measuring {{convert|0.75|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick by {{convert|10|mm|in|abbr=on}} long, and lacks a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]]. It resembles [[wikt:extant|extant]] (currently living) species of the genus ''[[Mycena]]''. ''Protomycena'' is one of only five known agaric fungus species known in the fossil record and the second to be described from Dominican amber.<ref name=\"Hibbettal1997\"/><ref name=\"Hibbettal2003\"/>\n\n==Discovery and classification==\nThe genus is known only from the [[holotype]] specimen, a single [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] ([[mushroom]]) currently residing in the private collection owned by Ettore Morone of [[Turin, Italy]].<ref name=\"Hibbettal1997\"/><ref name=\"Engel1995\"/> The specimen was collected in one of the amber mines in the [[Cordillera Septentrional]] area of the island of [[Hispaniola]], in the [[Dominican Republic]]. The amber is believed to date from the [[Miocene]] [[Burdigalian]] stage, about 20 to 16 million years before the present.<ref name=\"IVMcP1996\"/> It was first studied by a group of researchers consisting of [[David S. Hibbett|David Hibbett]] and [[Michael J. Donoghue|Michael Donoghue]] from [[Harvard University]], with [[David Grimaldi (entomologist)|David Grimaldi]] of the [[American Museum of Natural History]].  Hibbett and colleagues published their 1997 [[Type (biology)|type description]] in the ''[[American Journal of Botany]]''.<ref name=\"Hibbettal1997\"/>  The generic name ''Protomycena'' is noted as \"first\", and \"''[[Mycena]]''\", a modern genus that it resembles. The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''electra'' was coined by the authors from the Latin or Greek word for \"amber\", in reference to the mode of preservation.<ref name=\"Hibbettal1997\"/>\n\nWhen it was reported, ''Protomycena electra'' was the third species of fossil agaric fungus to be described.  The two species ''[[Coprinites|Coprinites dominicana]]'' and ''[[Aureofungus|Aureofungus yaniguaensis]]'' are also known from the amber mines of the Dominican Republic, while the fourth species ''[[Archaeomarasmius|Archaeomarasmius leggeti]]'' is from the older, [[Cretaceous]] age [[New Jersey Amber]].<ref name=\"Hibbettal1997\"/><ref name=\"Hibbettal2003\"/>  With the 2007 publication of a fifth extinct agaric species, ''[[Palaeoagaracites|Palaeoagaracites antiquus]]'', the minimum age for the [[Agaricales]] order was pushed back to the [[Albian]] (approximately 100 [[Mya (unit)|Ma]]).<ref name=\"Poinar2007\"/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Mycena adscendens 79019.jpg|thumb|180px|right|''Protomycena'' is similar in appearance to modern ''Mycena'' species, such as ''[[Mycena adscendens|M.&nbsp;adscendens]]'' shown here.]]\nThe holotype of ''Protomycena'' is a single fruit body without any associated structures, preserved in a piece of clear light yellow polished amber approximately {{convert|4.5|\u2013|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide.  The [[Pileus (mycology)|pileus]] is {{convert|5|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter and has a convex shape, sporting a raised central region (an [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]]).  The pale [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] appears yellowish in the amber, and is smooth and glossy, changing to striate and slightly translucent towards the margin. The pileus margin is striated and slightly flared.  The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] on the underside of the pileus are broadly attached ([[wikt:adnate|adnate]]) to the top of the [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]], and distantly spaced\u2014between six and eight gills extend completely from the pileus margin to the [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]]. These full-length gills are [[anastomosis|anastomosed]] with lamellulae (short gills which do not reach the edge of the stipe from the pileus margin) of varying lengths.<ref name=\"Hibbettal2003\"/>  The pileus is centered on the curved stipe, which is smooth and cylindrical, measuring {{convert|0.75|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick by {{convert|10|mm|in|abbr=on}} long. The stipe lacks a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] and [[rhizoids]].  The mushroom is preserved with a small liquid and gas-filled bubble, possibly originating from the mushroom itself, which indicates the amber to be very solid and well-sealed.<ref name=\"Hibbettal1997\"/>\n\nIn Hibbett and colleagues' 1997 publication, ''Protomycena'' was placed in the subfamily ''Myceneae'', which at the time was considered part of the [[Tricholomataceae]] family;<ref name=\"Kirk2001\"/> ''Mycena'' is currently classified in the [[Mycenaceae]] family.<ref name=\"Kirk2008\"/><ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Mycena\"/> The placement was based solely on the visible structures, or [[morphology (biology)|macromorphology]] of the fruit body.  Many of the features which are typically used to [[classification (biology)|classify]] species into fungal [[family (biology)|families]] and subfamilies are based on microscopic features not visible or preserved in the amber specimen. Consequently, the assignment to ''Mycena'' is provisional (the authors also note certain similarities with extant members of ''[[Marasmius]]''), and the describing authors leave open the option of treating the genus placement as ''[[incertae sedis]]'' (uncertain placement) within the [[Agaricales]]. ''Protomycena'' is distinct from other amber-preserved mushroom taxa such as ''[[Coprinites]]'', in the grooved surface of its pileus and its [[wikt:anastomosing|anastomosing]] gills.<ref name=\"Hibbettal1997\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Engel1995\">{{cite journal |author=Engel MS. |year=1995 |title=New Augochlorine bees (Hymenoptera: Halictidae) in Dominican Amber, with a brief review of fossil Halictidae |journal=Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society |volume=69 |issue=4 |pages=334\u2013349 |jstor=25085728}} {{subscription}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Hibbettal1997\">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Hibbett DS, Grimaldi DS, Donoghue MJ |year=1997 |title=Fossil mushrooms from Miocene and Cretaceous ambers and the evolution of Homobasidiomycetes |journal=American Journal of Botany |volume=84 |issue=8 |pages=981\u2013991 |url=http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/reprint/84/7/981 |format=PDF |doi=10.2307/2446289|jstor=2446289 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Hibbettal2003\">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Hibbett DS, Grimaldi D, Donoghue MJ |year=2003 |title=Another fossil agaric from Dominican Amber |journal=Mycologia |volume=95 |issue=4 |pages=685\u2013687 |doi=10.2307/3761943 |jstor=3761943 |pmid=21148976}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"IVMcP1996\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Iturralde-Vinent MA, ((MacPhee RDE)) |year=1996 |title=Age and paleogeographical origin of Dominican Amber |journal=Science |volume=273 |pages=1850\u20131852 |doi=10.1126/science.273.5283.1850 |issue=5283}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Kirk2001\">{{cite book |vauthors=Kirk PM, Cannon PF, David JC, Stalpers JA|title=Ainsworth & Bisby's Dictionary of the Fungi |edition=9th |publisher=CABI Bioscience |location=Oxon, UK |year=2001 |page=337 |isbn=0-85199-377-X}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Kirk2008\">{{cite book |vauthors=Kirk PM, Cannon PF, Minter DW, Stalpers JA |title=Dictionary of the Fungi |edition=10th |publisher=CABI |location=Wallingford, UK |year=2008 |page=445 |isbn=978-0-85199-826-8}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Poinar2007\">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Poinar GO, Buckley R |year=2007 |title=Evidence of mycoparasitism and hypermycoparasitism in Early Cretaceous amber |journal=Mycological Research |volume=111 |issue=4 |pages=503\u2013506 |doi=10.1016/j.mycres.2007.02.004 |pmid=17512712}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Mycena\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mycobank.org/MycoTaxo.aspx?Link=T&Rec=18084 |title=''Mycena'' (Pers.)

The Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 also transformed the Austrian Navy into the Austro-Hungarian Navy.\n\nLargely neglected by the Empire in its early years, the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine grew throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries to become one of the largest navies in the [[Adriatic]] and [[Mediterranean]] Seas. By 1914 the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine had a peacetime strength of 20,000 personnel.{{sfn|Sokol|p=164}} The k.u.k. Kriegsmarine saw action in the [[Boxer Rebellion]], and the first shots of World War I were fired by the Austrian [[River monitor|monitor]] [[Yugoslav monitor Sava|''Bodrog'']], which bombarded [[Belgrade]] on 29 July 1914, the day after Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia.\n\nParticipating in both surface and [[submarine warfare]] in the Adriatic and Mediterranean Seas during the war, the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine achieved notable victories during the [[Bombardment of Ancona]] and the [[Battle of the Strait of Otranto (1917)|Battle of the Strait of Otranto]] in 1917. However, the [[Otranto Barrage]] - established first by [[Third French Republic|France]] and eventually maintained by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]] - largely prevented the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine from participating in many naval engagements after 1915. Largely tasked with defending Austria-Hungary's {{convert|1130|nmi|lk=in}} of coastline and {{convert|2172.4|nmi|lk=in}} of island seaboard for the duration of the war, the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine chose to rely more on [[List of Austro-Hungarian U-boats|Austria-Hungary's U-boats]] to engage in offensive naval operations rather than risk the destruction of [[List of battleships of Austria-Hungary|Austria-Hungary's battleships]], [[List of cruisers of Austria-Hungary|cruisers]], and other surface vessels. In June 1918, the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine attempted to break the Otranto Barrage with a massive naval attack which included four dreadnought battleships, three pre-dreadnoughts, four cruisers, four destroyers, four torpedo boats, and numerous submarines and airplanes, but the attack was called off after the battleship {{SMS|Szent Istv\u00e1n||2}} was sunk by an Italian torpedo boat on 10 June.\n\nFive months later, with the Austro-Hungarian Empire facing collapse and defeat in the war, the Empire decided to transfer most of its navy to the newly-declared [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] on 31 October, effectively bringing the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine to an end. Three days later, the Empire's military authorities signed the [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]], pulling the rapidly disintegrating empire out of the war. With the signing of the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] and the [[Treaty of Trianon]], the [[First Austrian Republic]] and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] were treated as the successors to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, whereas the independence of the [[West Slavs]] and [[South Slavs]] of the Empire as the [[First Czechoslovak Republic]], the [[Second Polish Republic]] and the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], respectively, and most of the territorial demands of the [[Kingdom of Romania]] were also recognized by the victorious Allies in 1920. As a result, both Austria and Hungary were deprived of their coasts, and the former Empire's most important ports such as [[Trieste]], [[Pula|Pola]], [[Rijeka|Fiume]], and [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], were annexed into [[Italy]] and Yugoslavia.\n\nThe k.u.k. Kriegsmarine's main ships meanwhile were turned over to the Allies where most of them were scrapped throughout the 1920s, though some of its ships remained in use through the 1930s and beyond, such as the ''[[Yugoslav monitor Sava|Bodrog]]'', which remained in the service of multiple countries until the 1960s and is presently being converted into a [[museum ship]].\n\n== History ==\n===Origins===\n[[Image:Adriatic Sea map.png|right|thumb|300px|An overview of Adriatic ports today]]\n\nThe  k.u.k. Kriegsmarine was not formally established until the 18th century, but its origins can be traced back to 1382, with the incorporation of Trieste into the [[Duchy of Austria]]. During the 13th and 14th centuries, Trieste became a maritime trade rival to the [[Republic of Venice]] which occupied the Adriatic port city for intermittent periods between 1283 and 1372. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Turin (1381)|Peace of Turin]] in 1381, Venice renounced its claim to Trieste and the leading citizens of Trieste petitioned [[Leopold III, Duke of Austria]], to make Trieste part of his domains. The agreement incorporating Trieste into the Duchy of Austria was signed at the [[Schlossberg (Graz)|castle of Graz]] on 30 September 1382.{{sfn|Thaller|2009|p=191}}{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=3}}\n\nWhile Austria had a port with the incorporation of Trieste, the city was granted a large degree of autonomy and successive Dukes of Austria paid little attention to the port or the idea of deploying a navy to protect it. Until the end of the 18th century, there were only limited attempts to establish an Austrian navy.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=3}} During the [[Thirty Years War]], [[Generalissimo]] [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]] was awarded the Duchies of [[Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg-Schwerin]] and [[Mecklenburg-G\u00fcstrow]] as well as given the title  \"Admiral of the North and Baltic Seas\" by [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] in 1628 after scoring several military victories against [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] in northern Germany.{{sfn|Wedgwood|2005|p=219}} However, Wallenstein failed to capture [[Stralsund]], which resisted the [[Capitulation of Franzburg]] and the [[Battle of Stralsund (1628)|subsequent siege]] with assistance of Danish, Scottish and [[Sweden|Swedish]] troops, a blow that denied him access to the Baltic and the chance of challenging the naval power of the [[Scandinavia]]n kingdoms and of the [[Netherlands]].{{sfn|Wedgwood|2005|p=220}} Wallenstein's assassination at the hands of his own officers in 1634 prevented the development of any Austrian navy in either the [[North Sea|North]] or [[Baltic Sea]]s.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=3}}\n\nThe next incursion Austria took into naval affairs occurred on the [[Danube]] River rather than at sea. During the [[Great Turkish War]], [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] employed a small flotilla of ships along the Danube to fight the Ottoman Empire, a practice which the [[House of Habsburg]] had employed previously during the 16th and 17th centuries to fight during [[Ottoman\u2013Habsburg wars|Austria's numerous wars with the Ottomans]]. These river flotillas were largely manned by crews who came from Austria's coastal ports, and played a significant role in transporting troops across the Danube as well as denying Turkish control over the strategically important river.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=3}}\n\nAustria remained without a proper seagoing navy however, even after the need for one became apparent with the [[French Navy]] bombardment of the port of Trieste during the [[War of Spanish Succession]]. Lacking any sea power, Austria was unable to protect its coastal cities or project power into the Adriatic or Mediterranean Seas.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=3}} The war ended with the treaties of [[Treaty of Utrecht|Utrecht]], [[Treaty of Rastatt|Rastatt]], and [[Treaty of Baden (1714)|Baden]]. Under the terms of the Treaty of Rastatt, Austria gained the [[Spanish Netherlands]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], and the [[Duchy of Milan]].{{sfn|Frey|1995|pp=374-375}} While Austria's control over Sardinia and Naples was cut short by their loss to Spain in 1734 during the War of Polish Succession,{{sfn|Anderson|1995|pp=7-11}} these territories as well as the new [[Austrian Netherlands]] gave Austria greater access to the sea than ever before.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=3-4}}\n\nFollowing the War of Spanish Succession, Austria once again developed interest in establishing a proper navy in order to protect its now numerous coastal possessions. This coincided with the majority of European nations' growing interest in [[mercantilism]], the founding and development of [[colonies]], and the chartering of overseas trading companies during the early 18th century. Austria's largest obstacle in engaging in overseas trade and naval enterprises however lay in the country's geography. Despite Austria having a lengthy coastline along the Adriatic Sea, the major ports it possessed along its main coastline were isolated from [[Vienna]] by the large [[Austrian Alps]]. Furthermore, there were no major rivers linking Austria's Adriatic ports to the interior of the country. Austria also enjoyed three major navigable rivers which flowed through the country, the [[Elbe]], the [[Oder]], and the Danube. However, the Elbe and the Oder flowed through the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] before emptying into the North and Baltic Sea respectively, while the mouth of the Danube lay within the territory of the Ottoman Empire. Both of these nations remained major rivals of Austria throughout the 18th century, preventing the Austrians from using its major rivers to gain access to the sea.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=4}}\n\n====The Ostend Company====\n{{main|Ostend Company}}\n\nFollowing the War of Spanish Succession, Austria's greatest outlet to the sea lay in the newly-acquired Austrian Netherlands. While non-contiguous with the rest of Austria, the Austrian Netherlands lay within the boundaries of the Habsburg-dominated [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The territory also possessed numerous ports with easy access to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], such as [[Ghent]], [[Antwerp]], [[Bruges]], and [[Ostend]]. However, the economy of the Austrian Netherlands was very disconnected from the rest of Austria, and most Habsburg rulers paid little attention to the province.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=4}} Even Prince Eugene of Savoy, upon being appointed Governor-General of the Austrian Netherlands in June 1716, chose to remain in Vienna and direct policy through his chosen representative, [[Hercule-Louis Turinetti, marquis of Pri\u00e9]].{{sfn|McKay|1977|p=180}}\n\nThe success of the [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch]], [[East India Company|British]] and [[French East India Company|French]] East India Companies throughout the 17th and early 18th centuries however led the merchants and shipowners of Ostend to want to establish direct commercial relations with the [[East Indies]].{{sfn|Butel|1997|p=197}} In December 1722, Charles VI granted a 30-year charter to the [[Ostend Company]] to conduct trade with the East and [[West Indies]], as well as [[Africa]].{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=6}} The Ostend Company proved to be immensely profitable, and between 1724 and 1732, 21 company vessels were sent out to conduct trade in the [[Caribbean]], Africa, and especially [[Asia]]. The most profitable voyages of the Ostend Company were to [[Guangzhou|Canton]], as rising tea prices resulted in high profits for ships conducting trade with [[China]]. Between 1719 and 1728, the Ostend Company transported 7&nbsp;million pounds of tea from China, roughly half of the total amount brought to western Europe at the time, placing the company on par in the tea trade with the British East India Company.{{sfn|Butel|1997|p=198}} The Ostend Company proved to be short lived however. In the face of British pressure to end the trading company's competition with the British East India Company, and in order to secure British recognition of the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]], Charles VI suspended the charter of the company following the [[Treaty of Vienna (1731)|Treaty of Vienna]] and it ceased operations in 1731.{{sfn|Butel|1997|p=198}}{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=6}}\n\n====Charles VI and Maria Theresa====\n{{main|Austrian East India Company}}\n[[File:Europe 1740 en.png|thumb|left|300px|Europe in 1740, just before the War of Austrian Succession]]\nBelieving that \"Navigation and commerce are the foremost pillars of the state,\"{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=4}} Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] engaged in other projects beyond the establishment of the Ostend Company in order to increase Austria's merchant marine and establish a proper navy to protect it. This included constructing a new road through the [[Semmering Pass]] in order to link Vienna to Trieste, and declaring Trieste and [[Fiume]] [[free port]]s in 1719.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=4}} In order to help protect Austrian merchants from piracy in the Adriatic and Mediterranean, Charles VI also purchased the three-decker 80-gun [[third rate]] [[ship of the line]] [[HMS Cumberland (1695)|''Cumberland'']] from the United Kingdom in 1720. The ship was renamed ''San Carlos'' and stationed out of [[Naples]].{{sfn|Lavery|1983|p=130}}\n\nOn the Adriatic, Charles VI constructed even more ships, usually employing Italian and Spanish officers to man them. This Adriatic fleet consisted of three ships of the line, one frigate, and several [[galleys]]. In total, this Adriatic fleet had 500 guns and a crew of 8,000 men. Following the end of the Ostend Company however, a committee was set up in 1738 by the Emperor to examine the status of Austria's Adriatic fleet. Its report concluded that the fleet \"had little usefulness, caused great expense, and stood in danger of being defeated in case of attack\".{{snf|Sokol|1968|p=6}} This report eventually led to Charles VI scrapping his Adriatic fleet and transferring most of officers and crew members to Austria's Danube Flotilla.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=6}}\n\nUpon the death of Charles VI on 19 October 1740, [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]], and [[Kingdom of France|France]] all repudiated the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 which had paved the way for Charles' daughter [[Maria Theresa]] to succeed him.{{sfn|Anderson|1995|pp=7-9}} [[Frederick II of Prussia]] almost immediately invaded Austria in December 1740 and took the affluent Habsburg province of [[Silesia]] in the seven-year conflict known as the [[War of the Austrian Succession]].{{sfn|Anderson|1995|p=59}} This conflict proved to be primarily a land-based war for Austria, which led to naval affairs being neglected by the newly crowned Maria Theresa, who spent the entirety of the war preoccupied with securing her inheritance of the throne of Austria as opposed to rebuilding her father's former fleet in the Adriatic.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=6}}\n\nBy the time the [[Seven Years' War]] began in 1756, Austria still lacked a proper navy. English pirates and privateers, as well as [[Barbary corsairs]] severely hampered Austria's merchant marine, to the point that most of Austria's sea trade had to be conducted in foreign ships. The lack of any naval force to protect Austria's shipping led [[Count Kaunitz]] to push for the creation of a small force of [[frigates]] to protect the Adriatic Sea. However, the Seven Years' War forced Vienna to pay much more attention to Austria's land border with Prussia and its coastline along the Adriatic Sea, preventing Kaunitz's program from achieving success.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=6}}\n\nIn 1775, another attempt to formulate an overseas trading company was undertaken with the establishment of the [[Austrian East India Company]]. Headed by [[William Bolts]], the company's first voyage to India began on 24 September 1776 with Bolts sailing aboard the [[Indiaman]] ''Giuseppe e Teresa'' from [[Livorno]] in the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], which was ruled by Maria Theresa's son [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold]]. Bolts was also granted a 10-year charter to trade under the flag of the Holy Roman Empire with Persia, India, China and Africa.{{sfn|Bolts|1787|pp=45-49}}\n\nThe Austrian East India Company marked the [[Austrian colonial policy|first attempt by Austria to establish overseas colonies]]. Within the next two years, Bolts established [[Factory (trading post)|factories]] on the [[Malabar Coast]], on the southeastern African coast at [[Maputo Bay|Delagoa Bay]], and at the [[Nicobar Islands]].{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=6}}  These ventures ultimately failed however due to pressure from pressure from other colonial powers such as Portugal and Denmark-Norway, both of which forcefully evicted Bolts and his colonists from Africa and the Bay of Bengal respectively. Furthermore, the Austrian government did not wish to provoke other foreign powers after having to fight two major continental wars in the span of just 20 years. Vienna was also unwilling to lend much monetary support to either the company or towards the creation of a navy sufficiently large enough to protect its interests. This was partially because the Austrian government expected the ports of Trieste and Fiume to bear the cost of constructing and maintaining a fleet.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=6}}\n\n===Establishment of the Austrian Navy===\n[[File:Kircher.png|thumb|right|300px|''The Ships of the Line Laharpe, Stengel and Beyrand'' by [[Alexander Kircher]], depicting three Austrian ships of the line after their capture at Ancona]]\nThe Austrian Navy was finally established in 1786, with [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] purchasing two [[Cutter (boat)|cutters]] in Ostend, each armed with 20 guns, and sending them to Trieste. Joseph II also introduced Austria's [[Naval Ensign]], which consisted of a red-white-red standard with the crown of the [[Archduchy of Austria]] on the left. Prior to this, Austrian ships flew the yellow and black [[flag of the Habsburg Monarchy]]. Joseph II's ''Marineflagge'' remained the naval ensign of Austria, and later Austria-Hungary, until the middle of World War I.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=7}}\n\nThe onset of the [[French Revolution]] in 1789 and the subsequent [[French Revolutionary Wars]] greatly changed the political face of Europe and resulted in the largest expansion of the Austrian Navy up to that point in time. Under Joseph II's successor, [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]], the Austrian Navy was formally located out of the port of Trieste. In 1797 with the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] between France and Austria which ended the [[War of the First Coalition]], Austria ceded to France the Austrian Netherlands and certain islands in the Mediterranean, including [[Corfu]] and some Venetian-held islands in the Adriatic. The Republic of Venice and its territories were divided between the two states, and Austria received the city of [[Venice]] along with [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]]. Venice's naval forces and facilities were also handed over to Austria and became the basis of the formation of the future Austrian Navy.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=7, 9}}\n\nThe Treaty of Campo Formio resulted in Austria becoming the largest, and indeed the only, naval power in the Adriatic. Prior to the incorporation of the remnants of the [[Venetian navy]], the Austrian Navy only consisted of the two cutters purchased in 1786, as well as several armed merchant vessels and gunboats. While Venice had suffered under French occupation, and the ships Austria acquired from the city's annexation allowed the Austrian Navy to grow to some 37 vessels by the start of the [[War of the Second Coalition]] in 1799. These ships mostly consisted of small coastal craft, with some 111 guns and 787 crew members between them. This still remained a very small naval force, which with an average of just three guns and 21 crew members per ship, was largely unable to project power outside of the Adriatic or protect Austrian shipping in the Mediterranean. When the [[Imperial and Royal Army during the Napoleonic Wars|Austrian Army]] took [[Ancona]] in 1799, three former Venetian ships of the line, ''Laharpe'', ''Stengel'' and ''Beyrand'', were seized by the Austrians. Despite having 74 guns per-ship, far more than any other vessels in the Adriatic, the Austrian government chose to sell the ships for breaking rather than incorporate them into the Navy.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=9}}\n\nAt the end of the 18th century, several new regulations were also imposed regarding naval activity. These included instructing officers to refrain from excessive shouting when giving sailing commands, directing the captains of each ship in the navy not to conduct business transactions on their own behalf, and ordering surgeons to [[Fumigation|fumigate]] their ships several times a day in order to prevent the outbreak of any disease. The most notable regulation imposed directed naval officers to learn German. At the time, most Austrian naval officers were Italian or Spanish, and Italian remained the main language of the officer corps until 1848. This policy change however reflected Austria's desire to re-order its multi-ethnic Empire more towards the [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire|German states of the Holy Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=9-10}}\n\n====The Napoleonic Wars====\n[[File:Austrian Empire (1812).svg|thumb|left|200px|The Austrian Empire following the Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn, which left Austria landlocked and without a navy]]\nOn 17 March 1802, [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles of Austria]], acting in his role as \"Inspector General of the Navy\" ordered the formation of Imperial and Royal Naval Cadet School in [[Venice]], (German: ''k.u.k. Marine-Kadettenschule'').{{sfn|Salcher|1902|p=8}} This school eventually moved to [[Trieste]] in 1848 and changed its name to the \"Imperial and Royal Naval Academy\" (German: ''k.u.k. Marine-Akademie'').{{sfn|Salcher|1902|pp=18-22}}\n\nAustria again fought against France during the [[War of the Second Coalition|Second]] and [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalitions]], when after meeting a crushing defeat at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], Holy Roman Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] had to agree to the [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]], weakening the [[Austrian Empire]] and reorganizing Germany under a Napoleonic imprint known as the [[Confederation of the Rhine]].\n\nBelieving his position as Holy Roman Emperor to be untenable, Francis abdicated the throne of the Holy Roman Empire on 6 August 1806, and [[Dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire|declared the Holy Roman Empire to be dissolved]] in the same declaration. This was a political move to impair the legitimacy of the Confederation of the Rhine. Two years earlier, as a reaction to [[Napoleon]] making himself an [[Emperor of the French]], Francis had [[Austrian Empire|raised Austria to the status of an empire]].  Hence, after 1806, he reigned as Francis I, Emperor of Austria.{{sfn|Reich|1905|p=622}} This move meant that the naval forces under the banner of the Holy Roman Empire were now reconstituted as solely being a part of the Austrian Navy.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=10}}\n\nThree years later Austria again declared war on France, beginning the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]]. Following Austria's defeat at the [[Battle of Wagram]], the Empire sued for peace. The resulting [[Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn]] imposed harsh terms on Austria. Austria had to hand over the [[Duchy of Salzburg]] to the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] and lost its access to the [[Adriatic Sea]] by ceding the [[Austrian Littoral|Littoral]] territories of [[Gorizia and Gradisca]] and the [[Imperial Free City of Trieste]], together with [[Duchy of Carniola|Carniola]], the [[March of Istria]], western [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] with [[East Tyrol]], and the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatia]]n lands southwest of the river [[Sava]] to the French Empire. [[West Galicia]] was ceded to the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], and [[Tarnopol]] was given to the [[Russian Empire]]. These terms eliminated Austria's coastline along the Adriatic, thus destroying the Austrian Navy, with its warships being handed over to the French to guard the newly formed the [[Illyrian provinces]]. Between 1809 and 1814, there was no Austrian coastline and subsequently no navy to defend it.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=10}}\n\n===Modernising the Navy===\n[[File:Giovanni Passi 001.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Austrian frigates ''Augusta'' and ''Austria'' in the port of Trieste prior to the voyage of Maria Leopoldina to Brazil]]\n\nFollowing the [[Congress of Vienna]] and the 1815 [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris]], Austria's coastline was restored. Under the conditions of the Congress of Vienna, the former Austrian Netherlands were transferred to the newly created [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], while Austria received [[Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia|Lombardy-Venetia]] as compensation. These territorial changes gave Austria five ships of the line, two frigates, one [[corvette]], and several smaller ships which had been left in Venice by the French during the Napoleonic Wars. The decades of warfare Austria had participated in since 1789 however had left the Empire on the verge of bankruptcy, and most of these ships were sold or abandoned for financial reasons.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=10}}\n\nBy the end of the decade however, the Austrian Navy began to be rebuilt. The growth of the Austrian Navy in the years following the Congress of Vienna were largely driven by political necessities, as well economic conditions. The marriage between Archduchess [[Maria Leopoldina of Austria|Maria Leopoldina]] and Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil]] in 1817 marked the first time a ship from the Austrian Navy crossed the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the Americas, with the Archduchess traveling with the frigates ''Augusta'' and ''Austria'' to [[Rio de Janeiro]].{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=10}} Three years later, the frigate ''Carolina'' escorted Austria's ambassador to Brazil across the Atlantic, before sailing on to China, marking the first time a ship from the Austrian Navy had traveled to [[East Asia]]. During the 1820s and early 1830s, Austrian trade along the Danube and within the Mediterranean grew rapidly. In 1830, the Austrian Danube Steam Navigation Company was founded and in 1834, its [[steamship]] ''Marie Dorothee'' became the first of its kind to travel the Mediterranean on a voyage between Trieste and Constantinople. In 1836, the [[\u00d6sterreichischer Lloyd|Austrian Lloyd]] (German: ''\u00d6sterreichischer Lloyd'') was established. While Austria's merchant marine grew throughout the 1820s and 1830s, the Austrian Navy grew alongside it in order to provide protection on the high seas.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=10-11}}\n\n[[File:Friedrich Ferdinand Leopold 1821 1847 lith1841.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Archduke Friedrich Leopold became the youngest Commander-in-Chief of the Austrian Navy in history when he was appointed to the office at the age of 23.]]\n\nDuring the [[Greek War of Independence]], the Austrian Navy engaged Greek pirates who routinely attempted to attack Austrian shipping in order to help fund the Greek rebellion against Ottoman rule. During the same time period, Barbary corsairs continued to prey upon Austrian shipping in the Western Mediterranean. These two threats greatly stretched the resources of Austria's naval forces, which were still rebuilding after the Napoleonic Wars.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=12}} In 1829, two Austrian corvettes, a [[brig]], and a [[schooner]] under Lieutenant Commander (German: ''[[Korvettenkapit\u00e4n]]'') Franz Bandiera sailed Morocco's Atlantic coast to obtain the release of an Austrian merchant ship which had been captured by pirates.{{sfn|Sondhaus|2002|p=7}} While the mission resulted in the return of the ship's crew, the Moroccans refused to return the ship, resulting in the Austrian bombardment of [[Larache]]. This action resulted in Morocco returning the captured Austrian ship, as well as pay damages to Vienna. The bombardment of Larache resulted in the end of North African pirates raiding Austrian shipping in the Mediterranean Sea.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=12}}\n\nBy the 1830s, an attempt to modernize the Navy had begun. The Austrian government granted new funding for the construction of additional ships and the purchasing of new equipment. The most notable change which was undertaken was the incorporation of steamships, with the first such ship in the Austrian Navy, the {{convert|500|t|LT|0|adj=on}} [[paddle steamer]] ''Maria Anna'', being constructed in Fiume. ''Maria Anna''{{'}}s first trials took place in 1836.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=12-13}} In 1837, [[Friedrich Ferdinand Leopold of Austria|Archduke Friedrich Leopold]] enlisted into the Navy. The third son of Archduke Charles, a famous veteran of the Napoleonic Wars, Friedrich's decision to join the Navy greatly enhanced its prestige among the Austrian nobility and public. During his time in the Navy, Friedrich introduced many modernizing reforms, aiming to make the Austrian Navy less \"Venetian\" in character and more \"Austrian\".{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=13}}\n\n====Oriental Crisis of 1840====\n{{main|Oriental Crisis of 1840}}\nFriedrich and the Austrian Navy had their first major military encounter during the [[Oriental Crisis of 1840]]. After his victory over the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the [[Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1831\u201333)|First Egyptian-Ottoman War]], [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] conquered large parts of [[Syria Vilayet|Syria]]. In 1839, the Ottomans attempted to reclaim these territories but after a decisive defeat at the [[Battle of Nezib]], the Ottoman Empire appeared on the verge of collapse.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=14}} Through the [[Convention of London (1840)|Convention of London]], the United Kingdom, Austria, Prussia, and Russia intervened to save the Ottoman Empire. The Convention offered Muhammad Ali hereditary rule of Egypt while nominally remaining part of the Ottoman Empire if he withdrew from most of Syria. Muhammad Ali hesitated to accept the offer however and in September 1840 the European powers moved to engage Muhammad Ali's forces.\n\nThe British and Austrian navies subsequently blockaded the [[Nile Delta]] and bombarded [[Beirut]] on 11 September 1840. On 26 September, Friedrich, commanding the Austrian frigate ''Guerriera'', bombarded the port of [[Sidon]] with British support. The Austrians and British landed in the city and stormed its coastal fortifications, capturing it on 28 September. After capturing Sidon, Austria's naval squadron sailed on to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] which bombarded the city in November, destroying its coastal fortifications and silencing the city's guns. During the storming of the city, Friedrich personally led the Austro-British landing party and hoisted the Ottoman, British, and Austrian flags over the Acre's citadel upon its capture.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=14-15}} For his leadership during the campaign, Archduke Friedrich was awarded the [[Military Order of Maria Theresa|''Knight of the Military Order of Maria Theresa'']]. In 1844, Archduke Friedrich was promoted to the rank of [[Vice-Admiral]] and become Commander-in-Chief of the Navy at the age of 23, but his tenure as the head of the Austrian Navy ended just three years after his appointment when he died in Venice at the age of 26.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=15}}\n\n===Revolutions of 1848===\n{{main|Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire}}\n[[File:Europe 1848 map en.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Map of Europe in 1848\u20131849 depicting the main revolutionary centers, important counter-revolutionary troop movements and states with abdications]]\nAfter a successful [[French Revolution of 1848|revolution in France]] in February 1848 toppled King [[Louis Philippe I]] and established a [[Second French Republic]], [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary fervor broke out across Europe]]. In Vienna, [[List of Ministers-President of Austria|Austrian Chancellor]] [[Klemens von Metternich]] resigned his post and leave in exile to London while Emperor [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand I]] was forced to abdicate the throne in favor of his nephew, Franz Joseph. Across the Austrian Empire, [[nationalist]] sentiments among Austria's various ethnic groups led to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|revolutions in Austria]] to take several different forms. Liberal sentiments prevailed extensively among the German Austrians, which were further complicated by the [[German revolutions of 1848\u201349|simultaneous events in the German states]]. The Hungarians within the Empire largely sought to establish their own independent kingdom or republic, which resulted in a [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|revolution in Hungary]]. Italians within the Austrian Empire likewise sought to unify with the other Italian-speaking states of the Italian Peninsula to form a \"Kingdom of Italy\".{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=17}}\n\nThe revolution in Vienna sparked anti-Habsburg riots in Milan and Venice. Field Marshal Joseph Radetzky was unable to defeat the [[Republic of San Marco|Venetian]] and [[Five Days of Milan|Milanese]] insurgents in Lombardy-Venetia, and had to order his forces to evacuate western Italy, pulling his forces back to a chain of defensive fortresses between Milan and Venice known as the [[Quadrilatero]]. With [[Vienna Uprising|Vienna itself in the middle of an uprising]] against the Habsburg Monarchy, the Austrian Empire appeared on the brink of collapse. On 23 March 1848, just one day after Radetzky was forced to retreat from Milan, The Kingdom of Sardinia declared war on the Austrian Empire, sparking the [[First Italian War of Independence]].{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=18-19}}\n\n====First War of Italian Independence====\n{{main|First War of Italian Independence}}\n[[File:Blockade of Venice.png|thumb|left|300px|''Blockade of Venice'' by Alexander Kircher, depicting the Austrian Navy blockading the revolutionary [[Republic of San Marco]] in 1849]]\nVenice was at the time one of Austria's largest and most important ports, and the revolution which began there nearly led to the disintegration of the Austrian Navy. The Austrian commander of the Venetian Naval Yard was beaten to death by his own men, while the head of the city's Marine Guard was unable to provide any aid to suppress the uprising as most of the men under his command deserted. Vice-Admiral Anton von Martini, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, attempted to put an end to the rebellion but was betrayed by his officers, the majority of whom were Venetians, and subsequently captured and held prisoner.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=19}} By the end of March, the Austrian troops in Venice were forced from the city and the Austrian Navy appeared to be collapsing as many of the Austrian sailors and officers were of Italian descent. Fearing mutinies, Austrian officers ultimately relieved of these Italian sailors of their duty and permitted them to return home. While this action left the Navy drastically undermanned, it prevented any wide-scale disintegration within the Navy which the Austrian Army had repeatedly suffered from in Italy.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=19}}\n\nThe loss of so many Italian crew members and officers meant that the remaining ships which did not fall into rebel hands in Venice were lacking many crews. Out of roughly 5,000 men who were members of the Austrian Navy prior to the revolution, only 72 officers and 665 sailors remained. Further complicating matters for the Austrian Navy was the loss of Venice's naval dockyards, warehouses, its arsenal, as well as three corvettes and several smaller vessels to the Venetian rebels.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=19}} The loss of Vice-Admiral Martini was also a blow to Austrians, as the Navy had gone through no less than four Commanders-in-Chief within three months of the death of Archduke Friedrich in late 1847. Martini's capture left the Navy without a commander for the fifth time in as many months.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=19}} In the aftermath of the loss of Venice, the Austrian Navy reorganized itself under the temporary command of General Count [[Franz Gyulai]]. Gyulai recalled every Austrian ship in the Mediterranean, the Adriatic, and in the Levant. Due to Trieste's close location to the parts of Italy revolting against Austrian rule at the time, Gyulai also chose the small port of Pola as the new base for the Austrian Navy. This marked the first time the city had been used as an Austrian naval base, and from 1848 onwards the city continued to serve as a base for Austrian warships until the end of World War I.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=19-20}} In late April, this fleet began a blockade of Venice in order to assist Austria's army currently fighting the Italian nationalists who had seized the city.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=20}}\n\nMeanwhile, fortunes continued to fade for the Austrians. The [[Papal States]] and the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] both joined the war on the side of Sardinia,{{sfn|Giglio|1948|p=179}}{{sfn|Pieri|1962|p=451}} the later sending a naval force into the Adriatic in cooperation with Sardinia to help size Venice. This Italian fleet consisted of five frigates and several smaller vessels acquired by the Italian nationalists in Venice. Against this force, the Austrian Navy counted three frigates of 44 to 50 guns, two corvettes of 18 and 20 guns, eight brigs of six to 16 guns, 34 gunboats with three guns each, and two steamers of two guns. Despite its relatively large size for navies in the Adriatic, the Austrian Navy lacked experience against the combined Italian forces and Gyulai decided to withdraw his ships to Pola.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=20}} After the Austrians moved back to Trieste due to the fact that Pola's small and undeveloped dockyards could not handle the size of the Austrian fleet, a stalemate ensued in the Adriatic. The Austrian fleet was too small to go on the offensive against the Italians, while the Italian naval commander, Rear Admiral [[Giovanbattista Albini]], was under orders not to attack the port of Trieste as its location within the [[German Confederation]] may draw in other powers in [[central Europe]] against Sardinia.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=20-21}} Austrian efforts to purchase additional warships from the United Kingdom, Russia, the Ottoman Empire, and from Egypt, all ended in failure as the funds to purchase the ships were instead used to fight Austria's many land battles with Hungarian and Italian nationalists, as well as the war with Sardinia. Early experimentation on the use of a self-propelled explosive device\u2014forerunner to the torpedo\u2014to attack the Italian ships also failure due to the technological constraints of the time. Additional proposals to break the Italian fleet by using [[fire ship]]s was rejected as an \"inhumane\" way of fighting.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=21}}{{efn|name=Torpedo}}\n\n[[File:Assedio Venezia Chiesa San Geremia (1849).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Venice under Austrian bombardment, 1849]]\n\nThe stalemate in the Adriatic came to an end as the Papal States and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies pulled out of the war.{{sfn|Giglio|1948|p=179}}{{sfn|Pieri|1962|p=451}} Austrian reinforcements bolstered Radetzky's forces in the Italian peninsula and following the [[Battle of Custoza (1848)|Battle of Custoza]] in July 1848, the tide of the war turned turned in Austria's favor.{{sfn|Pieri|1962|pp=246\u2013247}} On 9 August, an armistice was signed between Sardinia and Austria, and a month later, Admiral Martini was released in a prisoner exchange and returned as head of the Navy. While Martini unsuccessfully lobbied for the purchase of new steam ships to re-establish a blockade of Venice, Sardinia resumed the war with Austria on 12 March 1849. This led to the disastrous Sardinian defeat at the [[Battle of Novara (1849)|Battle of Novara]] ten days later. The decisive defeat forced King [[Charles Albert of Sardinia]] to abdicate the throne of Sardinia in favor of his son Victor Emmanuel II and brought the First War of Italian Independence to an end in August 1849.{{sfn|Clark|2013|p=55}} Venice was the last Italian nationalist holdout to fall on 27 August 1849.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=23}}{{efn|name=Venice1849}}\n\n====Aftermath and effects on the Navy====\nThe Revolutions of 1848 marked a turning point in the history of the Austrian Navy. Up until that time, the Navy had been dominated by the Italian language, customs, and traditions. Prior to the revolution, the Austrian Navy was mostly made up of Italian crew members, the Italian language was the primary language, and even Italian ship names were used over German ones, such as ''Lipsia'' rather than ''Leipzig''. Indeed, in the years before 1848, the Navy was largely considered to be a \"local affair of Venice\".{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=19}} In the years after 1848, most of the navy's officers corps hailed from the German-speaking parts of the Empire, while most of the sailors came from Istria and the Dalmatian Coast, leading to Croats, Germans, and even Hungarians to begin to be represented among the ranks of the Austrian Navy.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=19}}\n\nAfter retaking Venice, the Austrians acquired several warships which were under construction or already seaworthy. Most of these ships were added to the strength of the Austrian Navy, increasing the size and strength of the Navy considerably by the year 1850.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=23}} In Venice the naval shipyard was retained. Here the Austrian  screw-driven gunboat ''Kerka'' (crew: 100) was launched in 1860 (in service until 1908).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"4\" |Naval strength of the Austrian Empire, January 1850{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=23}}\n|-\n|Type\n|Number\n|Guns\n|Tonnage\n|-\n|Frigates\n|4\n|32\u201342\n|{{convert|1200|t|LT|0}}\n|-\n|Corvettes\n|6\n|20\n|{{convert|800-900|t|LT|0}}\n|-\n|Brigs\n|7\n|16\n|{{convert|500|t|LT|0}}\n|-\n|Miscellaneous sailing ships \n|10\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|-\n|Steamers\n|4\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|}\n\nIn the final months of the blockade of Venice, the Danish-born [[Dane Hans von Dahlerup]] was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Austrian Navy. Emperor Franz Joseph I selected Dahlerup due to his desire to replace Italian influence within the Navy. Dahlerup introduced many personal reforms, such as reorganizing the command structure of the Navy, establishing new service regulations, and setting up a school for naval officers. He also began the process of replacing Italian with German as the spoken de facto language of the Austrian Navy. However, Dahlerup's command style clashed heavily with the prevailing culture within the Austrian Navy and he resigned after just over two years.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=25-26}}\n\n===The Ferdinand Max era===\n{{see also|Maximilian I of Mexico}}\n[[File:Maximilian by Winterhalter extrait.jpg|thumb|left|Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian of Austria served as Commander-in-Chief of the Austrian Navy throughout the 1850s and early 1860s.]]\n\nAfter a two-year interim period in which Lieutenant General Count [[Franz Wimpffen]] commanded the Navy, in September 1854 Emperor Franz Joseph I promoted his younger brother, [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian]] (commonly referred to as Ferdinand Max), to the rank of Rear Admiral and named him Commander-in-Chief of the Austrian Navy. At the age of 22, Ferdinand Max became the youngest ''Oberkommandant'' in the history of the Austrian Navy, being a year younger than when Archduke Friedrich of Austria assumed command of the navy ten years earlier.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1989|pp=180\u2013181}}\n\nDespite his age, the fact that he had only been in the Navy for four years, and his lack of experience in battle or command on the high seas, Ferdinand Max proved to be among the most effective and successful commanders of the Austrian Navy in history. He was described by Lawrence Sondhaus in his book ''The Habsburg Empire and the Sea: Austrian Naval Policy, 1797\u20131866'' as \"the most gifted leader the navy had ever had, or ever would have\".{{sfn|Sondhaus|1989|p=181}} Anthony Sokol describes Ferdinand Max in his book ''The Imperial and Royal Austro-Hungarian Navy'' as \"one of the most talented of the Habsburg princes...He used his prestige, youthful enthusiasm, and love of the Service to promote it in every way possible.\"{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=26}}\n\nFerdinand Max worked hard to separate the Austrian Navy from its dependence upon the Austrian Army, which had nominal control over its affairs. On 14 January 1862, Franz Joseph I agreed to establish the Ministry of Marine, which oversaw the affairs of both the Austrian Navy, and the Austrian merchant marine, and named Count [[Matthais von Wickenburg]] its head. Under this new system, Ferdinand Max continued to be the ''Oberkommandant'', but he was no longer responsible for the political management of the fleet.{{sfn|Wagner|1961|pp=29, 32}} In addition to obtaining support for the creation of Ministry of Marine, Ferdinand Max was given great freedom by the Emperor to manage the navy as he saw fit, especially with respect to the construction and acquisition of new warships.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1989|p=182}}\n\n====Development of the Austrian Navy: 1854\u20131860====\nFerdinand Max immediately went to work expanding the Austrian Navy. Fears of over-dependence upon foreign shipyards to supply Austrian warships enabled him to convince his brother to authorize the construction of a new drydock at [[Pula|Pola]], and the expansion of existing shipyards in Trieste. Furthermore, Ferdinand Max initiated an ambitious construction program in the ports of Pola, Trieste, and Venice, the largest the Adriatic had seen since the Napoleonic Wars.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1989|p=182}} Pola in particular saw a considerable amount of attention as its natural harbor and strategic location along the Adriatic coastline of Austria enabled ships docked there to provide protection for Trieste as well as the Dalmatian Coast. While it had been used as a base for the Navy during the Revolutions of 1848, the small dockyards and port facilities, coupled with surrounding swampland had hindered its development. In addition to Pola's new drydock, Ferdinand Max had the swamps drained and constructed a new arsenal for the city.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=26}}\n\nBy 1855, a screw-powered ship-of-the-line was under construction in Pola after failed bids to construct the ship with British and American shipbuilding firms,{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=114}} while two screw-frigates and two screw-corvettes were being built in Trieste and Venice respectively.{{sfn|Handel-Mazzetti|Sokol|1952|pp=14\u201315, 217\u2013219}} Within a year of Ferdinand Max's promotion to ''Oberkommandant'', the Austrian Navy consisted of four frigates, four corvettes, and two paddle steamers in active service in the Mediterranean Sea. Ferdinand Max followed up on this progress however by purchasing the steam frigate {{SMS|Radetzky|1854|2}} from the United Kingdom in 1856. Her design was used for the construction of future ships of the Navy, and marked the beginning of Austria's modern shipbuilding industry. From 1856 onward, a majority of Austria's ships were constructed by domestic shipyards.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=26}} Ferdinand Max's next construction project was the last Austrian ship-of-the-line, {{SMS|Kaiser|1858|2}}. She was commissioned into the Austrian Navy in 1859 after being constructed at the newly-built [[Pola Navy Yard]] between 1855 and 1858.{{sfn|Gardiner|1979|p=270}}\n\nAs a result of these construction projects, the Austrian Navy grew to its largest size since the War of Austrian Succession over 100 years prior. Despite these efforts however, the Navy was still considerably smaller than its French, British, or Sardinian counterparts.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1989|p=184}} Indeed, the Austrian Navy was still attempting to catch up to the technological developments which had emerged during the first half of the 19th century with respect to steam power, when the emergence of the French iron-platted floating battery ''D\u00e9vastation'' gained international attention following its use during the [[Crimean War]] in October 1855. ''D\u00e9vastation'' signalled the beginning of the emergence of ironclad warships over the course of the next decade.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=44\u201345}}{{sfn|Baratelli|1983|p=41}}\n\nIndeed, the French Navy's technological and numerical edge proved to be decisive in driving the Austrian Navy to port shortly after the outbreak of the [[Second War of Italian Independence]].{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=26-27}} After the failure of the First Italian War of Independence, Sardinia began the search for potential allies. Sardinian Prime Minister [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour]], found [[French Emperor]] [[Napoleon III]] supportive of an alliance with Sardinia following the Crimean War, in which France and Sardinia were allies against the Russian Empire. After the [[Plombi\u00e8res Agreement]] of 1858,{{sfn|Trevelyan|1909|p=76-77}} Napoleon III and Cavour signed a secret treaty of alliance against Austria whereby France would assist Sardinia in return for [[Nice]] and [[Savoy]] being ceded to France.{{sfn|Trevelyan|1909|p=169}} During the first half of 1859, the Franco-Sardinian forces quickly defeated the Austrians on land, culminating in the [[Battle of Solferino]], while the French Navy blockaded the Adriatic Sea and forced the Austrian Navy to remain in port, preventing its use for the duration of the war.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=27}} After the defeat at Solferino, Austria ceded most of Lombardy and the city of Milan to France under the [[Treaty of Z\u00fcrich]], who transferred it to Sardinia in exchange for Savoy and Nice.{{sfn|Trevelyan|1909|pp=108\u2013110}}{{sfn|Sondhaus|1989|p=201}}\n\nIn response to Austria's quick defeat during the Second War of Italian Independence, Ferdinand Max proposed an even larger naval construction program than the one he had initiated upon his appointment as ''Oberkommandant''. This fleet would be large enough not only to show the Austrian flag around the world, but also to protect its merchant marine as well as thwart any Adriatic ambitions from the growing Kingdom of Sardinia. However, constitutional reforms enacted in Austria after the defeat, as well as the recent introduction of [[ironclad]]s into the navies of the world, made the proposal more expensive than he had initially intended.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1989|p=200}} While the Archduke had previously been given free rein over naval affairs, and had enjoyed an unprecedented allocation of new funds to complete his various expansion and modernization projects,{{sfn|Sondhaus|1989|pp=185\u2013186}} Austria's recent military defeats and financial difficulties in the immediate aftermath of the war stalled his plans for further construction projects.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1989|p=200}} Despite these obstacles, the initiation of the Italian ironclad program between 1860 and 1861, coupled with Austrian fears of an Italian invasion or seaborne landing directed against Venice, Trieste, Istria, and the Dalmatian Coast,{{sfn|Ordovini|Petronio|Sullivan|2014|p=328}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1979|p=335}} necessitated an Austrian naval response to counter the growing strength of the Italian Regia Marina.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1989|pp=200, 206}}\n\n====The Austro-Italian ironclad arms race====\n{{main|Austro-Italian ironclad arms race}}\n[[File:SMS Drache NH 87015.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Austrian ironclad ''Drache'', lead ship of the ''Drache'' class.

As a member of the Allied nations, Austria sent two training ships and the cruisers {{SMS|Kaiserin und K\u00f6nigin Maria Theresia}}, {{SMS|Kaiserin Elisabeth}}, {{SMS|Aspern}}, and {{SMS|Zenta}} and a company of marines to the North China coast in April 1900, based at the Russia concession of [[L\u00fcshunkou|Port Arthur]].\n\nIn June they helped hold the [[Tianjin]] railway against [[Righteous Harmony Society|Boxer]] forces, and also fired upon several armed [[Junk (ship)|junks]] on the [[Hai River]] near [[Tongzhou District, Beijing|Tong-Tcheou]]. They also took part in the seizure of the [[Taku Forts]] commanding the approaches to Tianjin, and the boarding and capture of four Chinese [[destroyers]] by [[Roger Keyes, 1st Baron Keyes|Capt. Roger Keyes]] of {{HMS|Fame|1896|6}}. In all k.u.k. forces suffered few casualties during the rebellion.\n\nAfter the uprising a cruiser was maintained permanently on the China station, and a detachment of marines was deployed at the embassy in [[Peking]].\n\nLieutenant [[Georg Ludwig von Trapp]], who served as a submarine commander during World War I and became famous in the musical ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' after World War II, was decorated for bravery aboard {{SMS|Kaiserin und K\u00f6nigin Maria Theresia}} during the Rebellion.\n\n====Montenegro====\n{{main|First Balkan War}}\nDuring the [[First Balkan War]] Austria-Hungary joined [[German Empire|Germany]], [[French Third Republic|France]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] in blockading the seaport town of [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] (Antivari) in the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]].\n\n====European naval arms race====\n[[Image:Klasa radetzky.png|right|thumb|Scale drawing of a ''Radetzky''-class semi-dreadnought.]]\nAmong the many factors giving rise to World War I was the naval [[arms race]] between the [[British Empire]] and [[Imperial Germany]]. Germany enhanced her naval infrastructure, building new [[dry dock]]s, and enlarging the [[Kiel Canal]] to enable larger vessels to navigate it. However, that was not the only European naval arms race. Imperial Russia too had commenced building a new modern navy<ref>Greger, Ren\u00e9; & Watts, A. J. (1972). ''The Russian fleet, 1914-1917''.

Like other imperial naval enthusiasts before him, Franz Ferdinand had a keen private interest in the fleet and was an energetic campaigner for naval matters.\n\n====The dreadnought era====\nIn 1906 Britain completed the battleship {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}, and it was so advanced that some argued that this rendered all previous battleships obsolete, although Britain and other countries kept pre-dreadnoughts in service.\n[[File:Tegetthoff.jpg|right|thumb|Dreadnought SMS ''Tegetthoff'', named after Admiral von Tegetthoff]]\nAustria-Hungary's [[Naval architecture|naval architects]], aware of the inevitable dominance of all big gun dreadnought type designs, then presented their case to the ''Marinesektion des Reichskriegsministeriums'' (Naval Section at the War Ministry) in [[Vienna]], which on 5 October 1908 ordered the construction of their own dreadnought, the first contract being awarded to 'Werft das [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT)', the naval weaponry to be provided by the [[\u0160koda Works]] in [[Plze\u0148|Pilsen]]. The Marine budget for 1910 was substantially enlarged to permit major refits of the existing fleet and more dreadnoughts. The battleships {{SMS|Tegetthoff|1912|6}} and {{SMS|Viribus Unitis}} were both launched by the [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] at Trieste, amongst great rejoicing, on 24 June 1911, and 21 March 1912 respectively. They were followed by {{SMS|Prinz Eugen}}, and {{SMS|Szent Istv\u00e1n}}. These battleships, constructed later than many of the earlier British and German dreadnoughts, were considerably ahead in some aspects of design, especially of both the French and Italian navies, and were constructed with [[Marconi wireless]] rooms as well as anti-aircraft armaments. It has been claimed they were the first battleships in the world equipped with torpedo launchers built into their bows.<ref name=\"Wagner\">Wagner, Walter, & Gabriel, Erich, ''Die 'Tegetthoff' Klasse'', Vienna, January 1979.</ref>\n\nBetween 22 and 28 May 1914 ''Tegetthoff'', accompanied by ''Viribus Unitis'', made a courtesy visit to the British Mediterranean fleet in [[Malta]].<ref name=\"Wagner\" />\n\n====Submarine fleet====\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:SM U-3 (Austria-Hungary).jpg|thumb|right|Both members of the ''U-3'' class, {{SMS|U-3|Austria-Hungary|6|sub=y}} (''front'') and {{SMS|U-4|Austria-Hungary|6|sub=y}} (''right rear''), are seen here in this undated photograph.]] -->\n\n{{main|Austro-Hungarian U-boats}}\nIn 1904, after allowing the navies of other countries to pioneer submarine developments, the Austro-Hungarian Navy ordered the Austrian Naval Technical Committee (MTK) to produce a submarine design. The January 1905 design developed by the MTK and other designs submitted by the public as part of a design competition were all rejected by the Navy as impracticable. They instead opted to order two submarines each of designs by [[Simon Lake]], [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Germaniawerft]], and [[John Philip Holland]] for a competitive evaluation. The two Germaniawerft submarines comprised the ''U-3'' class.<ref name=Con-340>Gardiner, p. 340.</ref> The Navy authorized two boats, ''U-3'' and ''U-4'', from the Germaniawerft in 1906.<ref name=Gib-384>Gibson and Prendergast, p. 384.</ref>\n\nThe ''U-3''-class was an improved version of Germaniawerft's design for the [[Imperial German Navy]]'s first U-boat, {{SMU|U-1|Germany|2}},<ref name=Gib-384 /> and featured a double [[submarine hull|hull]] with internal [[saddle tank (submarine)|saddle tank]]s.

Following the Italian declaration of war [[Fleet in being|the mere fact of its existence]] tied up the [[Italian Navy]] and the [[French Navy]] in the Mediterranean for the duration of the war.\n\nFollowing the declaration of war in August 1914 the French and Montenegrin forces attempted to cause havoc at [[Kotor|Cattaro]], KuK Kriegsmarine's southernmost base in the Adriatic. Throughout September, October and November 1914 the navy bombarded the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] forces resulting in a decisive defeat for the latter, and again in January 1916 in what was called the [[Battle of Lov\u0107en]], which was instrumental in [[Montenegro]] being knocked out of the war early.\n[[File:SMU-5 Trapp.jpg|thumb|left|[[Linienschiffsleutnant]] [[Georg von Trapp|von Trapp]] on the bridge of [[SM U-5 (Austria-Hungary)|''U-5'']]]]\n\nOn 23 May 1915, when Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary, the Austro-Hungarian navy left their harbors in [[Pula|Pola (today Pula, Croatia)]], [[\u0160ibenik|Sebenico (today \u0160ibenik, Croatia)]] and [[Kotor|Cattaro (today Kotor, Montenegro)]]  to bombard the eastern Italian coast between Venice and [[Barletta]]. Main targets were the cities of [[Ancona]], [[Rimini]], [[Vieste]], [[Manfredonia]], Barletta and bridges and railway tracks along the coast. Until 1917 the Austro-Hungarian fleet was as yet largely undamaged.\n\nThe presence of three Allied navies in the Mediterranean made any measures of their co-ordination and common doctrine extraordinarily difficult. The Mediterranean was divided into eleven zones, of which the British naval authorities were responsible for four, the French for four, and the Italians for three. Differing command structures, national pride and the language barrier all contributed to a lack of cohesion in the application of Allied sea power, producing a situation in which German and Austro-Hungarian U-boat attacks on shipping flourished. An example of the lack of co-ordination was the sinking of the Italian troop transport ''Minas'' bound from Italy to [[Salonika]], which was torpedoed in one of the British zones in February 1917 with the loss of 870 lives, a British escort not understanding a message and failing to relieve the Italian destroyer, which turned around at the zone barrier.\n\n====Battle at Durazzo====\n{{main|Battle of Durazzo (1915)}}\n\nIn December 1915 a k.u.k. Kriegsmarine cruiser squadron attempted to make a raid on the [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbian]] troops evacuating [[Principality of Albania|Albania]]. After sinking a French submarine and bombarding the town of [[Durr\u00ebs|Durazzo]] the squadron ran into a minefield, sinking one destroyer and damaging another. The next day the group ran into a squadron of British, French, and Italian cruisers and destroyers. The resulting battle left two Austrian destroyers sunk and light damage to another, while dealing only minor damage to the Allied warships and others.\n\nA three-power conference on 28 April 1917, at [[Corfu]], discussed a more offensive strategy in the Adriatic, but the Italians were not prepared to consider any big ship operations, considering the size of the Austro-Hungarian fleet. The British and French seemed reluctant to move alone against the Austro-Hungarians, especially if it meant a full-scale battle. But the Austrians were not inactive either, and even as the Allied conference was in session they were planning an offensive operation against the Otranto Barrage.\n\n====Battle of the Otranto Straits====\n{{Main|Battle of the Strait of Otranto (1917)}}\n[[Image:Novaral.jpg|right|thumb|{{SMS|Novara|1912|6}} after the Battle of Otranto Straits]]\n[[File:Spomenik u utvrdi na Prevlaci.JPG|thumb|Monument for the \"Heroes of Otranto Battle\" on the [[Prevlaka]] in Croatia]]\n\nThroughout 1917 the Adriatic remained the key to the U-boat war on shipping in the Mediterranean. Cattaro, some 140 miles above the narrow Straits of Otranto, was the main U-boat base from which almost the entire threat to Mediterranean shipping came.\n\nThe [[Otranto Barrage]], constructed by the Allies with up to 120 [[naval drifter]]s, used to deploy and patrol submarine nets, and 30 motor launches, all equipped with depth charges, was designed to stop the passage of U-boats from Cattaro. However, this failed to do so, and from its inception in 1916, the barrage had caught only two U-boats, the Austrian {{SMS|U-6|Austria-Hungary|2|sub=y}} and the German {{SMU|UB-44||2}} out of hundreds of possible passages.\n\nHowever, the barrage effectively meant that the Austro-Hungarian surface fleet could not leave the [[Adriatic Sea]] unless it was willing to give battle to the blocking forces. This, and as the war drew on bringing supply difficulties especially coal, plus a fear of mines, limited the Austro-Hungarian navy to shelling the Italian and Serbian coastlines.\n\nThere had already been four small-scale Austro-Hungarian attacks on the barrage, on 11 March, 21 and 25 April and 5 May 1917, but none of them amounted to anything. Now greater preparations were made, with two U-boats despatched to lay mines off [[Brindisi]] with a third patrolling the exits in case Anglo-Italian forces were drawn out during the attack. The whole operation was timed for the night of 14/15 May, which led to the biggest battle of the Austro-Hungarian navy in World War I, the Battle of the Otranto Straits.\n\nThe first Austro-Hungarian warships to strike were the two [[destroyer]]s, {{SMS|Csepel}} and {{SMS|Balaton}}. An Italian convoy of three ships, escorted by the destroyer {{ship|Italian destroyer|Borea|1902|2}}, was approaching [[Vlor\u00eb|Valona]], when, out of the darkness, the Austrians fell upon them. ''Borea'' was left sinking. Of the three merchant ships, one loaded with ammunition was hit and blown up, a second set on fire, and the third hit. The two Austrian destroyers then steamed off northward.\n\nMeanwhile, three Austro-Hungarian [[cruiser]]s under the overall command of Captain [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]], {{SMS|Novara|1912|6}}, {{SMS|Saida}}, and {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|6}}, had actually passed a patrol of four French destroyers north of the barrage, and thought to be friendly ships passed unchallenged. They then sailed through the barrage before turning back to attack it. Each Austrian cruiser took one-third of the line and began slowly and systematically to destroy the barrage with their {{convert|4|in|cm|adj=on|order=flip}} guns, urging all Allies on board to abandon their ships first.\n\nDuring this battle the Allies lost two destroyers, 14 [[Naval drifter|drifters]] and one [[glider aircraft|glider]] while the Austro-Hungarian navy suffered only minor damage (''Novara''{{'}}s steam supply pipes were damaged by a shell) and few losses. The Austro-Hungarian navy returned to its bases up north in order to repair and re-supply, and the allies had to rebuild the blockade.\n\n====Cattaro Mutiny====\n{{main|Cattaro Mutiny}}\nIn February 1918 a mutiny started in the 5th Fleet stationed at the [[Gulf of Cattaro]] naval base. Sailors on up to 40 ships joined the mutiny over demands for better treatment and a call to end the war.\n\nThe mutiny failed to spread beyond Cattaro, and within three days a loyal naval squadron had arrived. Together with [[coastal artillery]] the squadron fired several shells into a few of the rebel's ships, and then assaulted them with [[k.u.k. Marine Infantry]] in a short and successful skirmish. About 800 sailors were imprisoned, dozens were court-martialed, and four seamen were executed, including the leader of the uprising, Franz Rasch, a [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemian]]. Given the huge crews required in naval vessels of that time this is an indication that the mutiny was limited to a minority.\n\n====Late World War I====\n[[File:Admiral Horthy, WW1 postcard.jpg|right|thumb|Admiral [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]]]]\nA second attempt to force the blockade took place in June 1918 under the command of Rear-Admiral [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy|Horthy]]. A surprise attack was planned, but the mission was doomed when the fleet was by chance spotted by an Italian [[MAS boat]] patrol, commanded by [[Luigi Rizzo]] that had already sunk, at anchor, the 25 year-old battleship {{SMS|Wien}} (5,785 tons) the year before. Rizzo's [[MAS boat]] launched two torpedoes, hitting one of the four Austrian [[dreadnought]]s, the {{SMS|Szent Istv\u00e1n}} which had already slowed down due to engine problems. The element of surprise lost, Horthy broke off his attack. Huge efforts were made by the crew to save ''Szent Istv\u00e1n'', which had been hit below the water-line, and the dreadnought battleship ''Tegetthoff'' took her in tow until a tug arrived. However just after 6 a.m., the [[pumps]] being unequal to the task, the ship, now listing badly, had to be abandoned. ''Szent Istv\u00e1n'' sank soon afterwards, taking 89 crewmen with her. The event was filmed from a sister ship.<ref name=\"Wagner\" />\n\nIn 1918, in order to avoid having to give the fleet to the victors, the Austrian Emperor handed down the entire Austro-Hungarian Navy and merchant fleet, with all harbours, arsenals and shore fortifications to the new [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]]. The state of SCS was proclaimed officially on 29 October 1918 but never recognized by other countries. Diplomatic notes were sent to the governments of France, the United Kingdom, Italy, the [[United States]] and Russia, to notify them that the State of SCS was not at war with any of them and that the Council had taken over the entire Austro-Hungarian fleet; no response was provided, and for all practical purposes the war went on unchanged. Austria asked for an armistice on 29 October; after a few days' negotiation and the signatures, the armistice entered into force on 4 November.\n\nOn 1 November 1918 two sailors of the Italian ''[[Regia Marina]]'', [[Raffaele Paolucci]] and [[Raffaele Rossetti]], rode a primitive manned torpedo (nicknamed the ''Mignatta'' or \"leech\") into the Austro-Hungarian naval base at Pola. Using [[limpet mine]]s, they then sank the anchored ''Viribus Unitis'', with considerable loss of life, as well as the freighter ''Wien''.<ref name=\"Warhola\">\n{{cite web\n| last = Warhola\n| first = Brian\n| date = January 1998\n| title = Assault on the Viribus Unitis\n| publisher = Old News\n| url = http://www.worldwar1.com/sfvu.htm\n| accessdate = 23 April 2010\n}}\n</ref> The French navy commandeered the new dreadnought {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}, which they took to France and later used it for target practice in the Atlantic, where it was destroyed.<ref name=\"Wagner\" />\n\n==== Ships lost ====\n*Ships lost in World War I:<ref>Dario Petkovi\u0107: Ratna mornarica austro-ugarske monarhije, Pula 2004, Page 86, {{ISBN|953-6250-80-2}}</ref>\n** 1914: {{SMS|Kaiserin Elisabeth}} ([[Siege of Tsingtao]], 1914), {{SMS|Zenta}}, {{SMS|Flamingo}} (TB. 26)\n** 1915: {{SMS|U-12|Austria-Hungary|sub=y|6}}, {{SMS|U-3|Austria-Hungary|sub=y|6}}, {{SMS|Lika}}, {{SMS|Triglav}}\n** 1916: {{SMS|U-6|Austria-Hungary|sub=y|6}}, {{SMS|U-16|Austria-Hungary|sub=y|6}}\n** 1917: {{SMS|U-30|Austria-Hungary|sub=y|6}}, {{SMS|Wildfang}}, {{SMS|Wien}}, {{SMS|TB.XII}}, {{SMS|Inn}} (sunk by a Romanian mine)<ref>Angus Konstam, ''Gunboats of World War I'', p. 29</ref><ref>Ren\u00e9 Greger, ''Austro-Hungarian warships of World War I'', p. 142</ref><ref>Mark Axworthy, Cornel I.

They were first assigned for tours aboard the {{sclass-|Tegetthoff|battleship|2}}s. Later, the k.u.k.

They also had airfields at [[Podgorica]] in [[Montenegro]].\n*'''Flik 1''' - Igalo from June - November 1918\n*'''Flik 6''' - Igalo from November 1915 - January 1916\n**- Scutari from January 1916 - June 1917\n**- Tirana from July 1917 - June 1918\n**- Banja from June - July 1918\n**- Tirana from July - September 1918\n**- Podgorica from September - November 1918\n*'''Flik 13''' - Berat from August - September 1918\n**- Kavaja from September - October 1918\nThe following Austrian squadrons served at [[Feltre]] also:\n*'''Flik 11''' - from February 1918\n*'''Flik 14''' - from June 1918 to November 1918\n*'''Flik 16''' - from November 1917 - October 1918\n*'''Flik 31''' - from June - July 1918\n*'''Flik 36''' - from June - July 1918\n*'''Flik 39''' - from January - May 1918\n*'''Flik 45''' - during April 1918\n*'''Flik 56''' - during December 1917\n*'''Flik 60J''' - from March - September 1918\n*'''Flik 66''' - from January 1918 - November 1918\n*'''Flik 101''' - during May 1918\nFeltre was captured by Austrian forces on 12 November 1917 after the [[Battle of Caporetto]]. There were two other military airfields nearby, at [[Arsie]] and [[Fonzaso]]. It was the main station for the Austrian naval aviators in that area. The k.u.k. Seeflugwesen used mostly modified German aircraft, but produced several variations of its own. Notable aircraft for the service were the following:\n* [[Fokker A.III]]\n* [[Fokker E.III]]\n* [[Hansa-Brandenburg B.I]]\n* [[Hansa-Brandenburg D.I]]\n* [[Aviatik D.I]]\n* [[Albatros W.4]]\n* [[Ph\u00f6nix D.I]]\n* [[Fokker D.VII]]\n* [[Lohner L]]\n\n==Problems affecting the navy==\nWhen it came to its financial and political position within the Empire, the  Austrian (and later Austro-Hungarian) Navy was a bit of an afterthought for most of the time it existed.\n\nOne reason was that sea power was never a priority of the Austrian foreign policy and that the Navy itself was relatively little known and supported by the public. Activities such as open days and naval clubs were unable to change the sentiment that the Navy was just something \"''expensive but far away''\". Another point was that naval expenditures were for most of the time overseen by the Austrian War Ministry, which was largely controlled by the [[Military history of Austria|Army]], the only exception being the  period before the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Battle of Lissa]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\nThe Navy was only able to draw significant public attention and funds during the three short periods it was actively supported by a member of the [[House of Habsburg|Imperial Family]]. The Archdukes [[Friedrich Ferdinand Leopold of Austria|Friedrich (1821\u20131847)]], [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Ferdinand Maximilian (1832\u20131867)]] and [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand (1863\u20131914)]] each a keen private interest in the fleet, held senior naval ranks and were energetic campaigners for naval matters. However, none lasted long as, Archduke Friedrich died early, Ferdinand Maximilian left Austria to become [[Emperor of Mexico]] and Franz Ferdinand was assassinated before he acceded the throne.\n\nThe Navy's problems were further exacerbated by the ten [[ethnic groups]] having more than 5% of the population comprising the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Officers had to speak at least four of the languages found in the Empire. [[Germans]] and [[Czechs]] generally were in signals and engine room duties, [[Hungarians]] became gunners, while [[Croats]] and [[Italians]] were seamen or stokers. The [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]] aimed to calm political dissatisfaction by creating the [[Dual Monarchy]], in which the [[Emperor of Austria]] was also the [[King of Hungary]]. This constitutional change was also reflected in the navy's title, which changed to \"Imperial and Royal Navy\" (kaiserlich und k\u00f6nigliche Kriegsmarine, short form K. u K. Kriegsmarine).\n\nBesides problems stemming from the difficulty of communicating efficiently within such a multilingual military, the Empire's battleship designs were generally a smaller tonnage than those of other European powers.\n\n==Notable personnel==\n* [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], Admiral.

The flag, formally adopted as ''Marineflagge'' (naval ensign) was based on the colours of the Archduchy of Austria. It served as the official flag also after the ''Ausgleich'' in 1867, when the Austrian navy became the Austro-Hungarian Navy.<ref>Alfred Freiherr von Koudelka: ''Unsere Kriegs-Marine.'' Vienna, 1899, pp.60-2</ref> During World War I, [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor Franz Joseph]] approved of a new design, which also contained the Hungarian arms. This flag, officially instituted in 1915, was however little used, and ships continued displaying the old Ensign until the end of the war. Photographs of Austro-Hungarian ships flying the post-1915 form of the Naval Ensign are therefore relatively rare.\n\n==See also ==\n* [[The Adriatic Campaign of World War I]]\n* [[List of ships of the Austro-Hungarian Navy]]\n* [[Mediterranean naval engagements during World War I]]\n\n==Notes==\n===Footnotes===\n{{notes\n| notes =\n\n{{efn\n| name = Torpedo\n|16 years later, the torpedo was invented by former Austrian naval officer [[Giovanni Luppis]] and British engineer [[Robert Whitehead]].\n}}\n\n{{efn\n| name = Venice1849\n|The first attempt in history to conduct an [[aerial bomb]]ardment took place during the siege of Venice.

({{lang-de|[[Kaiserlich und k\u00f6niglich|kaiserliche und k\u00f6nigliche]] Kriegsmarine}} sometimes shortened to '''''k.u.k. Kriegsmarine''''', {{lang-hu|Cs\u00e1sz\u00e1ri \u00e9s Kir\u00e1lyi Haditenger\u00e9szet}}) was the [[navy|naval force]] of [[Austria-Hungary]]. Ships of the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine were designated ''SMS'', for ''[[Seiner Majest\u00e4t Schiff]]'' (His Majesty's Ship). Existing between 1867 and 1918, the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine came into being after the formation of Austria-Hungary in 1867, and ceased to exist upon the Empire's defeat and subsequent collapse at the end of [[World War I]].\n\nPrior to the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], the Navy was referred to as the '''Imperial Austrian Navy''' or simply the '''Austrian Navy'''. It saw action in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[Second Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War]], the [[First Italian War of Independence|First]] and [[Second Italian War of Independence|Second]] Wars of Italian Independence, the [[Second Schleswig War]], and the [[Seven Weeks War]] as well as the simultaneous [[Third War of Italian Independence]]. Following Austria's defeat by Prussia and Italy during the Seven Weeks War, [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|the Empire reformed itself into a dual monarchy]] with the Habsburg monarch ruling as Emperor of Austria over the western and northern half of the country that was the Austrian Empire, and as King of Hungary over the Kingdom of Hungary. The Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 also transformed the Austrian Navy into the Austro-Hungarian Navy.\n\nLargely neglected by the Empire in its early years, the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine grew throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries to become one of the largest navies in the [[Adriatic]] and [[Mediterranean]] Seas. By 1914 the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine had a peacetime strength of 20,000 personnel.{{sfn|Sokol|p=164}} The k.u.k. Kriegsmarine saw action in the [[Boxer Rebellion]], and the first shots of World War I were fired by the Austrian [[River monitor|monitor]] [[Yugoslav monitor Sava|''Bodrog'']], which bombarded [[Belgrade]] on 29 July 1914, the day after Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia.\n\nParticipating in both surface and [[submarine warfare]] in the Adriatic and Mediterranean Seas during the war, the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine achieved notable victories during the [[Bombardment of Ancona]] and the [[Battle of the Strait of Otranto (1917)|Battle of the Strait of Otranto]] in 1917. However, the [[Otranto Barrage]] - established first by [[Third French Republic|France]] and eventually maintained by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]] - largely prevented the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine from participating in many naval engagements after 1915. Largely tasked with defending Austria-Hungary's {{convert|1130|nmi|lk=in}} of coastline and {{convert|2172.4|nmi|lk=in}} of island seaboard for the duration of the war, the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine chose to rely more on [[List of Austro-Hungarian U-boats|Austria-Hungary's U-boats]] to engage in offensive naval operations rather than risk the destruction of [[List of battleships of Austria-Hungary|Austria-Hungary's battleships]], [[List of cruisers of Austria-Hungary|cruisers]], and other surface vessels. In June 1918, the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine attempted to break the Otranto Barrage with a massive naval attack which included four dreadnought battleships, three pre-dreadnoughts, four cruisers, four destroyers, four torpedo boats, and numerous submarines and airplanes, but the attack was called off after the battleship {{SMS|Szent Istv\u00e1n||2}} was sunk by an Italian torpedo boat on 10 June.\n\nFive months later, with the Austro-Hungarian Empire facing collapse and defeat in the war, the Empire decided to transfer most of its navy to the newly-declared [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] on 31 October, effectively bringing the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine to an end. Three days later, the Empire's military authorities signed the [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]], pulling the rapidly disintegrating empire out of the war. With the signing of the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] and the [[Treaty of Trianon]], the [[First Austrian Republic]] and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] were treated as the successors to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, whereas the independence of the [[West Slavs]] and [[South Slavs]] of the Empire as the [[First Czechoslovak Republic]], the [[Second Polish Republic]] and the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], respectively, and most of the territorial demands of the [[Kingdom of Romania]] were also recognized by the victorious Allies in 1920. As a result, both Austria and Hungary were deprived of their coasts, and the former Empire's most important ports such as [[Trieste]], [[Pula|Pola]], [[Rijeka|Fiume]], and [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], were annexed into [[Italy]] and Yugoslavia.\n\nThe k.u.k. Kriegsmarine's main ships meanwhile were turned over to the Allies where most of them were scrapped throughout the 1920s, though some of its ships remained in use through the 1930s and beyond, such as the ''[[Yugoslav monitor Sava|Bodrog]]'', which remained in the service of multiple countries until the 1960s and is presently being converted into a [[museum ship]].\n\n== History ==\n===Origins===\n[[Image:Adriatic Sea map.png|right|thumb|300px|An overview of Adriatic ports today]]\n\nThe  k.u.k. Kriegsmarine was not formally established until the 18th century, but its origins can be traced back to 1382, with the incorporation of Trieste into the [[Duchy of Austria]]. During the 13th and 14th centuries, Trieste became a maritime trade rival to the [[Republic of Venice]] which occupied the Adriatic port city for intermittent periods between 1283 and 1372. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Turin (1381)|Peace of Turin]] in 1381, Venice renounced its claim to Trieste and the leading citizens of Trieste petitioned [[Leopold III, Duke of Austria]], to make Trieste part of his domains. The agreement incorporating Trieste into the Duchy of Austria was signed at the [[Schlossberg (Graz)|castle of Graz]] on 30 September 1382.{{sfn|Thaller|2009|p=191}}{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=3}}\n\nWhile Austria had a port with the incorporation of Trieste, the city was granted a large degree of autonomy and successive Dukes of Austria paid little attention to the port or the idea of deploying a navy to protect it. Until the end of the 18th century, there were only limited attempts to establish an Austrian navy.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=3}} During the [[Thirty Years War]], [[Generalissimo]] [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]] was awarded the Duchies of [[Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg-Schwerin]] and [[Mecklenburg-G\u00fcstrow]] as well as given the title  \"Admiral of the North and Baltic Seas\" by [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] in 1628 after scoring several military victories against [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] in northern Germany.{{sfn|Wedgwood|2005|p=219}} However, Wallenstein failed to capture [[Stralsund]], which resisted the [[Capitulation of Franzburg]] and the [[Battle of Stralsund (1628)|subsequent siege]] with assistance of Danish, Scottish and [[Sweden|Swedish]] troops, a blow that denied him access to the Baltic and the chance of challenging the naval power of the [[Scandinavia]]n kingdoms and of the [[Netherlands]].{{sfn|Wedgwood|2005|p=220}} Wallenstein's assassination at the hands of his own officers in 1634 prevented the development of any Austrian navy in either the [[North Sea|North]] or [[Baltic Sea]]s.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=3}}\n\nThe next incursion Austria took into naval affairs occurred on the [[Danube]] River rather than at sea. During the [[Great Turkish War]], [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] employed a small flotilla of ships along the Danube to fight the Ottoman Empire, a practice which the [[House of Habsburg]] had employed previously during the 16th and 17th centuries to fight during [[Ottoman\u2013Habsburg wars|Austria's numerous wars with the Ottomans]]. These river flotillas were largely manned by crews who came from Austria's coastal ports, and played a significant role in transporting troops across the Danube as well as denying Turkish control over the strategically important river.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=3}}\n\nAustria remained without a proper seagoing navy however, even after the need for one became apparent with the [[French Navy]] bombardment of the port of Trieste during the [[War of Spanish Succession]]. Lacking any sea power, Austria was unable to protect its coastal cities or project power into the Adriatic or Mediterranean Seas.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=3}} The war ended with the treaties of [[Treaty of Utrecht|Utrecht]], [[Treaty of Rastatt|Rastatt]], and [[Treaty of Baden (1714)|Baden]]. Under the terms of the Treaty of Rastatt, Austria gained the [[Spanish Netherlands]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], and the [[Duchy of Milan]].{{sfn|Frey|1995|pp=374-375}} While Austria's control over Sardinia and Naples was cut short by their loss to Spain in 1734 during the War of Polish Succession,{{sfn|Anderson|1995|pp=7-11}} these territories as well as the new [[Austrian Netherlands]] gave Austria greater access to the sea than ever before.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=3-4}}\n\nFollowing the War of Spanish Succession, Austria once again developed interest in establishing a proper navy in order to protect its now numerous coastal possessions. This coincided with the majority of European nations' growing interest in [[mercantilism]], the founding and development of [[colonies]], and the chartering of overseas trading companies during the early 18th century. Austria's largest obstacle in engaging in overseas trade and naval enterprises however lay in the country's geography. Despite Austria having a lengthy coastline along the Adriatic Sea, the major ports it possessed along its main coastline were isolated from [[Vienna]] by the large [[Austrian Alps]]. Furthermore, there were no major rivers linking Austria's Adriatic ports to the interior of the country. Austria also enjoyed three major navigable rivers which flowed through the country, the [[Elbe]], the [[Oder]], and the Danube. However, the Elbe and the Oder flowed through the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] before emptying into the North and Baltic Sea respectively, while the mouth of the Danube lay within the territory of the Ottoman Empire. Both of these nations remained major rivals of Austria throughout the 18th century, preventing the Austrians from using its major rivers to gain access to the sea.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=4}}\n\n====The Ostend Company====\n{{main|Ostend Company}}\n\nFollowing the War of Spanish Succession, Austria's greatest outlet to the sea lay in the newly-acquired Austrian Netherlands. While non-contiguous with the rest of Austria, the Austrian Netherlands lay within the boundaries of the Habsburg-dominated [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The territory also possessed numerous ports with easy access to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], such as [[Ghent]], [[Antwerp]], [[Bruges]], and [[Ostend]]. However, the economy of the Austrian Netherlands was very disconnected from the rest of Austria, and most Habsburg rulers paid little attention to the province.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=4}} Even Prince Eugene of Savoy, upon being appointed Governor-General of the Austrian Netherlands in June 1716, chose to remain in Vienna and direct policy through his chosen representative, [[Hercule-Louis Turinetti, marquis of Pri\u00e9]].{{sfn|McKay|1977|p=180}}\n\nThe success of the [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch]], [[East India Company|British]] and [[French East India Company|French]] East India Companies throughout the 17th and early 18th centuries however led the merchants and shipowners of Ostend to want to establish direct commercial relations with the [[East Indies]].{{sfn|Butel|1997|p=197}} In December 1722, Charles VI granted a 30-year charter to the [[Ostend Company]] to conduct trade with the East and [[West Indies]], as well as [[Africa]].{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=6}} The Ostend Company proved to be immensely profitable, and between 1724 and 1732, 21 company vessels were sent out to conduct trade in the [[Caribbean]], Africa, and especially [[Asia]]. The most profitable voyages of the Ostend Company were to [[Guangzhou|Canton]], as rising tea prices resulted in high profits for ships conducting trade with [[China]]. Between 1719 and 1728, the Ostend Company transported 7 million pounds of tea from China, roughly half of the total amount brought to western Europe at the time, placing the company on par in the tea trade with the British East India Company.{{sfn|Butel|1997|p=198}} The Ostend Company proved to be short lived however. In the face of British pressure to end the trading company's competition with the British East India Company, and in order to secure British recognition of the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]], Charles VI suspended the charter of the company following the [[Treaty of Vienna (1731)|Treaty of Vienna]] and it ceased operations in 1731.{{sfn|Butel|1997|p=198}}{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=6}}\n\n====Charles VI and Maria Theresa====\n{{main|Austrian East India Company}}\n[[File:Europe 1740 en.png|thumb|left|300px|Europe in 1740, just before the War of Austrian Succession]]\nBelieving that \"Navigation and commerce are the foremost pillars of the state,\"{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=4}} Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] engaged in other projects beyond the establishment of the Ostend Company in order to increase Austria's merchant marine and establish a proper navy to protect it. This included constructing a new road through the [[Semmering Pass]] in order to link Vienna to Trieste, and declaring Trieste and [[Fiume]] [[free port]]s in 1719.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=4}} In order to help protect Austrian merchants from piracy in the Adriatic and Mediterranean, Charles VI also purchased the three-decker 80-gun [[third rate]] [[ship of the line]] [[HMS Cumberland (1695)|''Cumberland'']] from the United Kingdom in 1720. The ship was renamed ''San Carlos'' and stationed out of [[Naples]].{{sfn|Lavery|1983|p=130}}\n\nOn the Adriatic, Charles VI constructed even more ships, usually employing Italian and Spanish officers to man them. This Adriatic fleet consisted of three ships of the line, one frigate, and several [[galleys]]. In total, this Adriatic fleet had 500 guns and a crew of 8,000 men. Following the end of the Ostend Company however, a committee was set up in 1738 by the Emperor to examine the status of Austria's Adriatic fleet. Its report concluded that the fleet \"had little usefulness, caused great expense, and stood in danger of being defeated in case of attack\".{{snf|Sokol|1968|p=6}} This report eventually led to Charles VI scrapping his Adriatic fleet and transferring most of officers and crew members to Austria's Danube Flotilla.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=6}}\n\nUpon the death of Charles VI on 19 October 1740, [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]], and [[Kingdom of France|France]] all repudiated the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 which had paved the way for Charles' daughter [[Maria Theresa]] to succeed him.{{sfn|Anderson|1995|pp=7-9}} [[Frederick II of Prussia]] almost immediately invaded Austria in December 1740 and took the affluent Habsburg province of [[Silesia]] in the seven-year conflict known as the [[War of the Austrian Succession]].{{sfn|Anderson|1995|p=59}} This conflict proved to be primarily a land-based war for Austria, which led to naval affairs being neglected by the newly crowned Maria Theresa, who spent the entirety of the war preoccupied with securing her inheritance of the throne of Austria as opposed to rebuilding her father's former fleet in the Adriatic.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=6}}\n\nBy the time the [[Seven Years' War]] began in 1756, Austria still lacked a proper navy. English pirates and privateers, as well as [[Barbary corsairs]] severely hampered Austria's merchant marine, to the point that most of Austria's sea trade had to be conducted in foreign ships. The lack of any naval force to protect Austria's shipping led [[Count Kaunitz]] to push for the creation of a small force of [[frigates]] to protect the Adriatic Sea. However, the Seven Years' War forced Vienna to pay much more attention to Austria's land border with Prussia and its coastline along the Adriatic Sea, preventing Kaunitz's program from achieving success.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=6}}\n\nIn 1775, another attempt to formulate an overseas trading company was undertaken with the establishment of the [[Austrian East India Company]]. Headed by [[William Bolts]], the company's first voyage to India began on 24 September 1776 with Bolts sailing aboard the [[Indiaman]] ''Giuseppe e Teresa'' from [[Livorno]] in the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], which was ruled by Maria Theresa's son [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold]]. Bolts was also granted a 10-year charter to trade under the flag of the Holy Roman Empire with Persia, India, China and Africa.{{sfn|Bolts|1787|pp=45-49}}\n\nThe Austrian East India Company marked the [[Austrian colonial policy|first attempt by Austria to establish overseas colonies]]. Within the next two years, Bolts established [[Factory (trading post)|factories]] on the [[Malabar Coast]], on the southeastern African coast at [[Maputo Bay|Delagoa Bay]], and at the [[Nicobar Islands]].{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=6}}  These ventures ultimately failed however due to pressure from pressure from other colonial powers such as Portugal and Denmark-Norway, both of which forcefully evicted Bolts and his colonists from Africa and the Bay of Bengal respectively. Furthermore, the Austrian government did not wish to provoke other foreign powers after having to fight two major continental wars in the span of just 20 years. Vienna was also unwilling to lend much monetary support to either the company or towards the creation of a navy sufficiently large enough to protect its interests. This was partially because the Austrian government expected the ports of Trieste and Fiume to bear the cost of constructing and maintaining a fleet.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=6}}\n\n===Establishment of the Austrian Navy===\n[[File:Kircher.png|thumb|right|300px|''The Ships of the Line Laharpe, Stengel and Beyrand'' by [[Alexander Kircher]], depicting three Austrian ships of the line after their capture at Ancona]]\nThe Austrian Navy was finally established in 1786, with [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] purchasing two [[Cutter (boat)|cutters]] in Ostend, each armed with 20 guns, and sending them to Trieste. Joseph II also introduced Austria's [[Naval Ensign]], which consisted of a red-white-red standard with the crown of the [[Archduchy of Austria]] on the left. Prior to this, Austrian ships flew the yellow and black [[flag of the Habsburg Monarchy]]. Joseph II's ''Marineflagge'' remained the naval ensign of Austria, and later Austria-Hungary, until the middle of World War I.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=7}}\n\nThe onset of the [[French Revolution]] in 1789 and the subsequent [[French Revolutionary Wars]] greatly changed the political face of Europe and resulted in the largest expansion of the Austrian Navy up to that point in time. Under Joseph II's successor, [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]], the Austrian Navy was formally located out of the port of Trieste. In 1797 with the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] between France and Austria which ended the [[War of the First Coalition]], Austria ceded to France the Austrian Netherlands and certain islands in the Mediterranean, including [[Corfu]] and some Venetian-held islands in the Adriatic. The Republic of Venice and its territories were divided between the two states, and Austria received the city of [[Venice]] along with [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]]. Venice's naval forces and facilities were also handed over to Austria and became the basis of the formation of the future Austrian Navy.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=7, 9}}\n\nThe Treaty of Campo Formio resulted in Austria becoming the largest, and indeed the only, naval power in the Adriatic. Prior to the incorporation of the remnants of the [[Venetian navy]], the Austrian Navy only consisted of the two cutters purchased in 1786, as well as several armed merchant vessels and gunboats. While Venice had suffered under French occupation, and the ships Austria acquired from the city's annexation allowed the Austrian Navy to grow to some 37 vessels by the start of the [[War of the Second Coalition]] in 1799. These ships mostly consisted of small coastal craft, with some 111 guns and 787 crew members between them. This still remained a very small naval force, which with an average of just three guns and 21 crew members per ship, was largely unable to project power outside of the Adriatic or protect Austrian shipping in the Mediterranean. When the [[Imperial and Royal Army during the Napoleonic Wars|Austrian Army]] took [[Ancona]] in 1799, three former Venetian ships of the line, ''Laharpe'', ''Stengel'' and ''Beyrand'', were seized by the Austrians. Despite having 74 guns per-ship, far more than any other vessels in the Adriatic, the Austrian government chose to sell the ships for breaking rather than incorporate them into the Navy.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=9}}\n\nAt the end of the 18th century, several new regulations were also imposed regarding naval activity. These included instructing officers to refrain from excessive shouting when giving sailing commands, directing the captains of each ship in the navy not to conduct business transactions on their own behalf, and ordering surgeons to [[Fumigation|fumigate]] their ships several times a day in order to prevent the outbreak of any disease. The most notable regulation imposed directed naval officers to learn German. At the time, most Austrian naval officers were Italian or Spanish, and Italian remained the main language of the officer corps until 1848. This policy change however reflected Austria's desire to re-order its multi-ethnic Empire more towards the [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire|German states of the Holy Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=9-10}}\n\n====The Napoleonic Wars====\n[[File:Austrian Empire (1812).svg|thumb|left|200px|The Austrian Empire following the Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn, which left Austria landlocked and without a navy]]\nOn 17 March 1802, [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles of Austria]], acting in his role as \"Inspector General of the Navy\" ordered the formation of Imperial and Royal Naval Cadet School in [[Venice]], (German: ''k.u.k. Marine-Kadettenschule'').{{sfn|Salcher|1902|p=8}} This school eventually moved to [[Trieste]] in 1848 and changed its name to the \"Imperial and Royal Naval Academy\" (German: ''k.u.k. Marine-Akademie'').{{sfn|Salcher|1902|pp=18-22}}\n\nAustria again fought against France during the [[War of the Second Coalition|Second]] and [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalitions]], when after meeting a crushing defeat at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], Holy Roman Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] had to agree to the [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]], weakening the [[Austrian Empire]] and reorganizing Germany under a Napoleonic imprint known as the [[Confederation of the Rhine]].\n\nBelieving his position as Holy Roman Emperor to be untenable, Francis abdicated the throne of the Holy Roman Empire on 6 August 1806, and [[Dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire|declared the Holy Roman Empire to be dissolved]] in the same declaration. This was a political move to impair the legitimacy of the Confederation of the Rhine. Two years earlier, as a reaction to [[Napoleon]] making himself an [[Emperor of the French]], Francis had [[Austrian Empire|raised Austria to the status of an empire]].  Hence, after 1806, he reigned as Francis I, Emperor of Austria.{{sfn|Reich|1905|p=622}} This move meant that the naval forces under the banner of the Holy Roman Empire were now reconstituted as solely being a part of the Austrian Navy.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=10}}\n\nThree years later Austria again declared war on France, beginning the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]]. Following Austria's defeat at the [[Battle of Wagram]], the Empire sued for peace. The resulting [[Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn]] imposed harsh terms on Austria. Austria had to hand over the [[Duchy of Salzburg]] to the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] and lost its access to the [[Adriatic Sea]] by ceding the [[Austrian Littoral|Littoral]] territories of [[Gorizia and Gradisca]] and the [[Imperial Free City of Trieste]], together with [[Duchy of Carniola|Carniola]], the [[March of Istria]], western [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] with [[East Tyrol]], and the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatia]]n lands southwest of the river [[Sava]] to the French Empire. [[West Galicia]] was ceded to the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], and [[Tarnopol]] was given to the [[Russian Empire]]. These terms eliminated Austria's coastline along the Adriatic, thus destroying the Austrian Navy, with its warships being handed over to the French to guard the newly formed the [[Illyrian provinces]]. Between 1809 and 1814, there was no Austrian coastline and subsequently no navy to defend it.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=10}}\n\n===Modernising the Navy===\n[[File:Giovanni Passi 001.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Austrian frigates ''Augusta'' and ''Austria'' in the port of Trieste prior to the voyage of Maria Leopoldina to Brazil]]\n\nFollowing the [[Congress of Vienna]] and the 1815 [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris]], Austria's coastline was restored. Under the conditions of the Congress of Vienna, the former Austrian Netherlands were transferred to the newly created [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], while Austria received [[Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia|Lombardy-Venetia]] as compensation. These territorial changes gave Austria five ships of the line, two frigates, one [[corvette]], and several smaller ships which had been left in Venice by the French during the Napoleonic Wars. The decades of warfare Austria had participated in since 1789 however had left the Empire on the verge of bankruptcy, and most of these ships were sold or abandoned for financial reasons.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=10}}\n\nBy the end of the decade however, the Austrian Navy began to be rebuilt. The growth of the Austrian Navy in the years following the Congress of Vienna were largely driven by political necessities, as well economic conditions. The marriage between Archduchess [[Maria Leopoldina of Austria|Maria Leopoldina]] and Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil]] in 1817 marked the first time a ship from the Austrian Navy crossed the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the Americas, with the Archduchess traveling with the frigates ''Augusta'' and ''Austria'' to [[Rio de Janeiro]].{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=10}} Three years later, the frigate ''Carolina'' escorted Austria's ambassador to Brazil across the Atlantic, before sailing on to China, marking the first time a ship from the Austrian Navy had traveled to [[East Asia]]. During the 1820s and early 1830s, Austrian trade along the Danube and within the Mediterranean grew rapidly. In 1830, the Austrian Danube Steam Navigation Company was founded and in 1834, its [[steamship]] ''Marie Dorothee'' became the first of its kind to travel the Mediterranean on a voyage between Trieste and Constantinople. In 1836, the [[\u00d6sterreichischer Lloyd|Austrian Lloyd]] (German: ''\u00d6sterreichischer Lloyd'') was established. While Austria's merchant marine grew throughout the 1820s and 1830s, the Austrian Navy grew alongside it in order to provide protection on the high seas.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=10-11}}\n\n[[File:Friedrich Ferdinand Leopold 1821 1847 lith1841.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Archduke Friedrich Leopold became the youngest Commander-in-Chief of the Austrian Navy in history when he was appointed to the office at the age of 23.]]\n\nDuring the [[Greek War of Independence]], the Austrian Navy engaged Greek pirates who routinely attempted to attack Austrian shipping in order to help fund the Greek rebellion against Ottoman rule. During the same time period, Barbary corsairs continued to prey upon Austrian shipping in the Western Mediterranean. These two threats greatly stretched the resources of Austria's naval forces, which were still rebuilding after the Napoleonic Wars.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=12}} In 1829, two Austrian corvettes, a [[brig]], and a [[schooner]] under Lieutenant Commander (German: ''[[Korvettenkapit\u00e4n]]'') Franz Bandiera sailed Morocco's Atlantic coast to obtain the release of an Austrian merchant ship which had been captured by pirates.{{sfn|Sondhaus|2002|p=7}} While the mission resulted in the return of the ship's crew, the Moroccans refused to return the ship, resulting in the Austrian bombardment of [[Larache]]. This action resulted in Morocco returning the captured Austrian ship, as well as pay damages to Vienna. The bombardment of Larache resulted in the end of North African pirates raiding Austrian shipping in the Mediterranean Sea.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=12}}\n\nBy the 1830s, an attempt to modernize the Navy had begun. The Austrian government granted new funding for the construction of additional ships and the purchasing of new equipment. The most notable change which was undertaken was the incorporation of steamships, with the first such ship in the Austrian Navy, the {{convert|500|t|LT|0|adj=on}} [[paddle steamer]] ''Maria Anna'', being constructed in Fiume. ''Maria Anna''{{'}}s first trials took place in 1836.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=12-13}} In 1837, [[Friedrich Ferdinand Leopold of Austria|Archduke Friedrich Leopold]] enlisted into the Navy. The third son of Archduke Charles, a famous veteran of the Napoleonic Wars, Friedrich's decision to join the Navy greatly enhanced its prestige among the Austrian nobility and public. During his time in the Navy, Friedrich introduced many modernizing reforms, aiming to make the Austrian Navy less \"Venetian\" in character and more \"Austrian\".{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=13}}\n\n====Oriental Crisis of 1840====\n{{main|Oriental Crisis of 1840}}\nFriedrich and the Austrian Navy had their first major military encounter during the [[Oriental Crisis of 1840]]. After his victory over the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the [[Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1831\u201333)|First Egyptian-Ottoman War]], [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] conquered large parts of [[Syria Vilayet|Syria]]. In 1839, the Ottomans attempted to reclaim these territories but after a decisive defeat at the [[Battle of Nezib]], the Ottoman Empire appeared on the verge of collapse.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=14}} Through the [[Convention of London (1840)|Convention of London]], the United Kingdom, Austria, Prussia, and Russia intervened to save the Ottoman Empire. The Convention offered Muhammad Ali hereditary rule of Egypt while nominally remaining part of the Ottoman Empire if he withdrew from most of Syria. Muhammad Ali hesitated to accept the offer however and in September 1840 the European powers moved to engage Muhammad Ali's forces.\n\nThe British and Austrian navies subsequently blockaded the [[Nile Delta]] and bombarded [[Beirut]] on 11 September 1840. On 26 September, Friedrich, commanding the Austrian frigate ''Guerriera'', bombarded the port of [[Sidon]] with British support. The Austrians and British landed in the city and stormed its coastal fortifications, capturing it on 28 September. After capturing Sidon, Austria's naval squadron sailed on to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] which bombarded the city in November, destroying its coastal fortifications and silencing the city's guns. During the storming of the city, Friedrich personally led the Austro-British landing party and hoisted the Ottoman, British, and Austrian flags over the Acre's citadel upon its capture.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=14-15}} For his leadership during the campaign, Archduke Friedrich was awarded the [[Military Order of Maria Theresa|''Knight of the Military Order of Maria Theresa'']]. In 1844, Archduke Friedrich was promoted to the rank of [[Vice-Admiral]] and become Commander-in-Chief of the Navy at the age of 23, but his tenure as the head of the Austrian Navy ended just three years after his appointment when he died in Venice at the age of 26.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=15}}\n\n===Revolutions of 1848===\n{{main|Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire}}\n[[File:Europe 1848 map en.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Map of Europe in 1848\u20131849 depicting the main revolutionary centers, important counter-revolutionary troop movements and states with abdications]]\nAfter a successful [[French Revolution of 1848|revolution in France]] in February 1848 toppled King [[Louis Philippe I]] and established a [[Second French Republic]], [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary fervor broke out across Europe]]. In Vienna, [[List of Ministers-President of Austria|Austrian Chancellor]] [[Klemens von Metternich]] resigned his post and leave in exile to London while Emperor [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand I]] was forced to abdicate the throne in favor of his nephew, Franz Joseph. Across the Austrian Empire, [[nationalist]] sentiments among Austria's various ethnic groups led to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|revolutions in Austria]] to take several different forms. Liberal sentiments prevailed extensively among the German Austrians, which were further complicated by the [[German revolutions of 1848\u201349|simultaneous events in the German states]]. The Hungarians within the Empire largely sought to establish their own independent kingdom or republic, which resulted in a [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|revolution in Hungary]]. Italians within the Austrian Empire likewise sought to unify with the other Italian-speaking states of the Italian Peninsula to form a \"Kingdom of Italy\".{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=17}}\n\nThe revolution in Vienna sparked anti-Habsburg riots in Milan and Venice. Field Marshal Joseph Radetzky was unable to defeat the [[Republic of San Marco|Venetian]] and [[Five Days of Milan|Milanese]] insurgents in Lombardy-Venetia, and had to order his forces to evacuate western Italy, pulling his forces back to a chain of defensive fortresses between Milan and Venice known as the [[Quadrilatero]]. With [[Vienna Uprising|Vienna itself in the middle of an uprising]] against the Habsburg Monarchy, the Austrian Empire appeared on the brink of collapse. On 23 March 1848, just one day after Radetzky was forced to retreat from Milan, The Kingdom of Sardinia declared war on the Austrian Empire, sparking the [[First Italian War of Independence]].{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=18-19}}\n\n====First War of Italian Independence====\n{{main|First War of Italian Independence}}\n[[File:Blockade of Venice.png|thumb|left|300px|''Blockade of Venice'' by Alexander Kircher, depicting the Austrian Navy blockading the revolutionary [[Republic of San Marco]] in 1849]]\nVenice was at the time one of Austria's largest and most important ports, and the revolution which began there nearly led to the disintegration of the Austrian Navy. The Austrian commander of the Venetian Naval Yard was beaten to death by his own men, while the head of the city's Marine Guard was unable to provide any aid to suppress the uprising as most of the men under his command deserted. Vice-Admiral Anton von Martini, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, attempted to put an end to the rebellion but was betrayed by his officers, the majority of whom were Venetians, and subsequently captured and held prisoner.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=19}} By the end of March, the Austrian troops in Venice were forced from the city and the Austrian Navy appeared to be collapsing as many of the Austrian sailors and officers were of Italian descent. Fearing mutinies, Austrian officers ultimately relieved of these Italian sailors of their duty and permitted them to return home. While this action left the Navy drastically undermanned, it prevented any wide-scale disintegration within the Navy which the Austrian Army had repeatedly suffered from in Italy.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=19}}\n\nThe loss of so many Italian crew members and officers meant that the remaining ships which did not fall into rebel hands in Venice were lacking many crews. Out of roughly 5,000 men who were members of the Austrian Navy prior to the revolution, only 72 officers and 665 sailors remained. Further complicating matters for the Austrian Navy was the loss of Venice's naval dockyards, warehouses, its arsenal, as well as three corvettes and several smaller vessels to the Venetian rebels.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=19}} The loss of Vice-Admiral Martini was also a blow to Austrians, as the Navy had gone through no less than four Commanders-in-Chief within three months of the death of Archduke Friedrich in late 1847. Martini's capture left the Navy without a commander for the fifth time in as many months.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=19}} In the aftermath of the loss of Venice, the Austrian Navy reorganized itself under the temporary command of General Count [[Franz Gyulai]]. Gyulai recalled every Austrian ship in the Mediterranean, the Adriatic, and in the Levant. Due to Trieste's close location to the parts of Italy revolting against Austrian rule at the time, Gyulai also chose the small port of Pola as the new base for the Austrian Navy. This marked the first time the city had been used as an Austrian naval base, and from 1848 onwards the city continued to serve as a base for Austrian warships until the end of World War I.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=19-20}} In late April, this fleet began a blockade of Venice in order to assist Austria's army currently fighting the Italian nationalists who had seized the city.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=20}}\n\nMeanwhile, fortunes continued to fade for the Austrians. The [[Papal States]] and the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] both joined the war on the side of Sardinia,{{sfn|Giglio|1948|p=179}}{{sfn|Pieri|1962|p=451}} the later sending a naval force into the Adriatic in cooperation with Sardinia to help size Venice. This Italian fleet consisted of five frigates and several smaller vessels acquired by the Italian nationalists in Venice. Against this force, the Austrian Navy counted three frigates of 44 to 50 guns, two corvettes of 18 and 20 guns, eight brigs of six to 16 guns, 34 gunboats with three guns each, and two steamers of two guns. Despite its relatively large size for navies in the Adriatic, the Austrian Navy lacked experience against the combined Italian forces and Gyulai decided to withdraw his ships to Pola.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=20}} After the Austrians moved back to Trieste due to the fact that Pola's small and undeveloped dockyards could not handle the size of the Austrian fleet, a stalemate ensued in the Adriatic. The Austrian fleet was too small to go on the offensive against the Italians, while the Italian naval commander, Rear Admiral [[Giovanbattista Albini]], was under orders not to attack the port of Trieste as its location within the [[German Confederation]] may draw in other powers in [[central Europe]] against Sardinia.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=20-21}} Austrian efforts to purchase additional warships from the United Kingdom, Russia, the Ottoman Empire, and from Egypt, all ended in failure as the funds to purchase the ships were instead used to fight Austria's many land battles with Hungarian and Italian nationalists, as well as the war with Sardinia. Early experimentation on the use of a self-propelled explosive device\u2014forerunner to the torpedo\u2014to attack the Italian ships also failure due to the technological constraints of the time. Additional proposals to break the Italian fleet by using [[fire ship]]s was rejected as an \"inhumane\" way of fighting.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=21}}{{efn|name=Torpedo}}\n\n[[File:Assedio Venezia Chiesa San Geremia (1849).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Venice under Austrian bombardment, 1849]]\n\nThe stalemate in the Adriatic came to an end as the Papal States and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies pulled out of the war.{{sfn|Giglio|1948|p=179}}{{sfn|Pieri|1962|p=451}} Austrian reinforcements bolstered Radetzky's forces in the Italian peninsula and following the [[Battle of Custoza (1848)|Battle of Custoza]] in July 1848, the tide of the war turned turned in Austria's favor.{{sfn|Pieri|1962|pp=246\u2013247}} On 9 August, an armistice was signed between Sardinia and Austria, and a month later, Admiral Martini was released in a prisoner exchange and returned as head of the Navy. While Martini unsuccessfully lobbied for the purchase of new steam ships to re-establish a blockade of Venice, Sardinia resumed the war with Austria on 12 March 1849. This led to the disastrous Sardinian defeat at the [[Battle of Novara (1849)|Battle of Novara]] ten days later. The decisive defeat forced King [[Charles Albert of Sardinia]] to abdicate the throne of Sardinia in favor of his son Victor Emmanuel II and brought the First War of Italian Independence to an end in August 1849.{{sfn|Clark|2013|p=55}} Venice was the last Italian nationalist holdout to fall on 27 August 1849.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=23}}{{efn|name=Venice1849}}\n\n====Aftermath and effects on the Navy====\nThe Revolutions of 1848 marked a turning point in the history of the Austrian Navy. Up until that time, the Navy had been dominated by the Italian language, customs, and traditions. Prior to the revolution, the Austrian Navy was mostly made up of Italian crew members, the Italian language was the primary language, and even Italian ship names were used over German ones, such as ''Lipsia'' rather than ''Leipzig''. Indeed, in the years before 1848, the Navy was largely considered to be a \"local affair of Venice\".{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=19}} In the years after 1848, most of the navy's officers corps hailed from the German-speaking parts of the Empire, while most of the sailors came from Istria and the Dalmatian Coast, leading to Croats, Germans, and even Hungarians to begin to be represented among the ranks of the Austrian Navy.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=19}}\n\nAfter retaking Venice, the Austrians acquired several warships which were under construction or already seaworthy. Most of these ships were added to the strength of the Austrian Navy, increasing the size and strength of the Navy considerably by the year 1850.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=23}} In Venice the naval shipyard was retained. Here the Austrian  screw-driven gunboat ''Kerka'' (crew: 100) was launched in 1860 (in service until 1908).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"4\" |Naval strength of the Austrian Empire, January 1850{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=23}}\n|-\n|Type\n|Number\n|Guns\n|Tonnage\n|-\n|Frigates\n|4\n|32\u201342\n|{{convert|1200|t|LT|0}}\n|-\n|Corvettes\n|6\n|20\n|{{convert|800-900|t|LT|0}}\n|-\n|Brigs\n|7\n|16\n|{{convert|500|t|LT|0}}\n|-\n|Miscellaneous sailing ships \n|10\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|-\n|Steamers\n|4\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|}\n\nIn the final months of the blockade of Venice, the Danish-born [[Dane Hans von Dahlerup]] was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Austrian Navy. Emperor Franz Joseph I selected Dahlerup due to his desire to replace Italian influence within the Navy. Dahlerup introduced many personal reforms, such as reorganizing the command structure of the Navy, establishing new service regulations, and setting up a school for naval officers. He also began the process of replacing Italian with German as the spoken de facto language of the Austrian Navy. However, Dahlerup's command style clashed heavily with the prevailing culture within the Austrian Navy and he resigned after just over two years.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=25-26}}\n\n===The Ferdinand Max era===\n{{see also|Maximilian I of Mexico}}\n[[File:Maximilian by Winterhalter extrait.jpg|thumb|left|Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian of Austria served as Commander-in-Chief of the Austrian Navy throughout the 1850s and early 1860s.]]\n\nAfter a two-year interim period in which Lieutenant General Count [[Franz Wimpffen]] commanded the Navy, in September 1854 Emperor Franz Joseph I promoted his younger brother, [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian]] (commonly referred to as Ferdinand Max), to the rank of Rear Admiral and named him Commander-in-Chief of the Austrian Navy. At the age of 22, Ferdinand Max became the youngest ''Oberkommandant'' in the history of the Austrian Navy, being a year younger than when Archduke Friedrich of Austria assumed command of the navy ten years earlier.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1989|pp=180\u2013181}}\n\nDespite his age, the fact that he had only been in the Navy for four years, and his lack of experience in battle or command on the high seas, Ferdinand Max proved to be among the most effective and successful commanders of the Austrian Navy in history. He was described by Lawrence Sondhaus in his book ''The Habsburg Empire and the Sea: Austrian Naval Policy, 1797\u20131866'' as \"the most gifted leader the navy had ever had, or ever would have\".{{sfn|Sondhaus|1989|p=181}} Anthony Sokol describes Ferdinand Max in his book ''The Imperial and Royal Austro-Hungarian Navy'' as \"one of the most talented of the Habsburg princes...He used his prestige, youthful enthusiasm, and love of the Service to promote it in every way possible.\"{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=26}}\n\nFerdinand Max worked hard to separate the Austrian Navy from its dependence upon the Austrian Army, which had nominal control over its affairs. On 14 January 1862, Franz Joseph I agreed to establish the Ministry of Marine, which oversaw the affairs of both the Austrian Navy, and the Austrian merchant marine, and named Count [[Matthais von Wickenburg]] its head. Under this new system, Ferdinand Max continued to be the ''Oberkommandant'', but he was no longer responsible for the political management of the fleet.{{sfn|Wagner|1961|pp=29, 32}} In addition to obtaining support for the creation of Ministry of Marine, Ferdinand Max was given great freedom by the Emperor to manage the navy as he saw fit, especially with respect to the construction and acquisition of new warships.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1989|p=182}}\n\n====Development of the Austrian Navy: 1854\u20131860====\nFerdinand Max immediately went to work expanding the Austrian Navy. Fears of over-dependence upon foreign shipyards to supply Austrian warships enabled him to convince his brother to authorize the construction of a new drydock at [[Pula|Pola]], and the expansion of existing shipyards in Trieste. Furthermore, Ferdinand Max initiated an ambitious construction program in the ports of Pola, Trieste, and Venice, the largest the Adriatic had seen since the Napoleonic Wars.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1989|p=182}} Pola in particular saw a considerable amount of attention as its natural harbor and strategic location along the Adriatic coastline of Austria enabled ships docked there to provide protection for Trieste as well as the Dalmatian Coast. While it had been used as a base for the Navy during the Revolutions of 1848, the small dockyards and port facilities, coupled with surrounding swampland had hindered its development. In addition to Pola's new drydock, Ferdinand Max had the swamps drained and constructed a new arsenal for the city.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=26}}\n\nBy 1855, a screw-powered ship-of-the-line was under construction in Pola after failed bids to construct the ship with British and American shipbuilding firms,{{sfn|Lambert|1984|p=114}} while two screw-frigates and two screw-corvettes were being built in Trieste and Venice respectively.{{sfn|Handel-Mazzetti|Sokol|1952|pp=14\u201315, 217\u2013219}} Within a year of Ferdinand Max's promotion to ''Oberkommandant'', the Austrian Navy consisted of four frigates, four corvettes, and two paddle steamers in active service in the Mediterranean Sea. Ferdinand Max followed up on this progress however by purchasing the steam frigate {{SMS|Radetzky|1854|2}} from the United Kingdom in 1856. Her design was used for the construction of future ships of the Navy, and marked the beginning of Austria's modern shipbuilding industry. From 1856 onward, a majority of Austria's ships were constructed by domestic shipyards.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=26}} Ferdinand Max's next construction project was the last Austrian ship-of-the-line, {{SMS|Kaiser|1858|2}}. She was commissioned into the Austrian Navy in 1859 after being constructed at the newly-built [[Pola Navy Yard]] between 1855 and 1858.{{sfn|Gardiner|1979|p=270}}\n\nAs a result of these construction projects, the Austrian Navy grew to its largest size since the War of Austrian Succession over 100 years prior. Despite these efforts however, the Navy was still considerably smaller than its French, British, or Sardinian counterparts.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1989|p=184}} Indeed, the Austrian Navy was still attempting to catch up to the technological developments which had emerged during the first half of the 19th century with respect to steam power, when the emergence of the French iron-platted floating battery ''D\u00e9vastation'' gained international attention following its use during the [[Crimean War]] in October 1855. ''D\u00e9vastation'' signalled the beginning of the emergence of ironclad warships over the course of the next decade.{{sfn|Lambert|1984|pp=44\u201345}}{{sfn|Baratelli|1983|p=41}}\n\nIndeed, the French Navy's technological and numerical edge proved to be decisive in driving the Austrian Navy to port shortly after the outbreak of the [[Second War of Italian Independence]].{{sfn|Sokol|1968|pp=26-27}} After the failure of the First Italian War of Independence, Sardinia began the search for potential allies. Sardinian Prime Minister [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour]], found [[French Emperor]] [[Napoleon III]] supportive of an alliance with Sardinia following the Crimean War, in which France and Sardinia were allies against the Russian Empire. After the [[Plombi\u00e8res Agreement]] of 1858,{{sfn|Trevelyan|1909|p=76-77}} Napoleon III and Cavour signed a secret treaty of alliance against Austria whereby France would assist Sardinia in return for [[Nice]] and [[Savoy]] being ceded to France.{{sfn|Trevelyan|1909|p=169}} During the first half of 1859, the Franco-Sardinian forces quickly defeated the Austrians on land, culminating in the [[Battle of Solferino]], while the French Navy blockaded the Adriatic Sea and forced the Austrian Navy to remain in port, preventing its use for the duration of the war.{{sfn|Sokol|1968|p=27}} After the defeat at Solferino, Austria ceded most of Lombardy and the city of Milan to France under the [[Treaty of Z\u00fcrich]], who transferred it to Sardinia in exchange for Savoy and Nice.{{sfn|Trevelyan|1909|pp=108\u2013110}}{{sfn|Sondhaus|1989|p=201}}\n\nIn response to Austria's quick defeat during the Second War of Italian Independence, Ferdinand Max proposed an even larger naval construction program than the one he had initiated upon his appointment as ''Oberkommandant''. This fleet would be large enough not only to show the Austrian flag around the world, but also to protect its merchant marine as well as thwart any Adriatic ambitions from the growing Kingdom of Sardinia. However, constitutional reforms enacted in Austria after the defeat, as well as the recent introduction of [[ironclad]]s into the navies of the world, made the proposal more expensive than he had initially intended.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1989|p=200}} While the Archduke had previously been given free rein over naval affairs, and had enjoyed an unprecedented allocation of new funds to complete his various expansion and modernization projects,{{sfn|Sondhaus|1989|pp=185\u2013186}} Austria's recent military defeats and financial difficulties in the immediate aftermath of the war stalled his plans for further construction projects.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1989|p=200}} Despite these obstacles, the initiation of the Italian ironclad program between 1860 and 1861, coupled with Austrian fears of an Italian invasion or seaborne landing directed against Venice, Trieste, Istria, and the Dalmatian Coast,{{sfn|Ordovini|Petronio|Sullivan|2014|p=328}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1979|p=335}} necessitated an Austrian naval response to counter the growing strength of the Italian Regia Marina.{{sfn|Sondhaus|1989|pp=200, 206}}\n\n====The Austro-Italian ironclad arms race====\n{{main|Austro-Italian ironclad arms race}}\n[[File:SMS Drache NH 87015.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Austrian ironclad ''Drache'', lead ship of the ''Drache'' class.

It was also the last significant naval action fought by squadrons of wooden ships and the last significant naval action involving Denmark.\n\n[[Image:Anton Romako 001.jpg|thumb|Tegetthoff (centre) at the Battle of Lissa, painting by [[Anton Romako]], 1880]]\n\n====Third Italian War of Independence====\n{{main|Battle of Lissa (1866)}}\n[[File:Erzherzog Friedrich.jpg|thumb|right|Screw-driven corvette ''Erzherzog Friedrich'' in 1868, a veteran of the Battle of Lissa]]\nOn 20 July 1866, near the island of [[Vis (island)|Vis]] (Lissa) in the [[Adriatic]], the Austrian fleet, under the command of Rear-Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, made its name in the modern era at the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Battle of Lissa]] during the [[Third Italian War of Independence]]. The battle pitted Austrian naval forces against the [[Regia Marina|naval forces]] of the newly created [[Kingdom of Italy]]. It was a decisive victory for an outnumbered Austrian over a superior Italian force, and was the first major European sea battle involving ships using iron and steam, and one of the last to involve large wooden battleships and deliberate ramming.\n\n====Peacetime====\nIn 1873 the new sail and steam frigate {{SMS|Laudon}} (crew 480) was added to the fleet, which took part in the International Naval Review off [[Gru\u017e]] in 1880.<ref name=\"Hubmann\" />\n\nDuring peacetime Austrian ships visited Asia, North America, South America, and the [[Pacific Ocean]].\n\nIn 1869 Emperor Franz Joseph travelled on board the screw-driven corvette SMS ''Viribus Unitis'' (not to be confused with the later [[SMS Viribus Unitis|battleship of the same name]]) to the opening of the [[Suez Canal]]. The ship had been named after his personal motto.<ref name=\"Wagner\" />\n\n====Polar Expedition====\n{{main|Austro-Hungarian North Pole Expedition}}\nAustro-Hungarian ships and naval personnel were also involved in [[Arctic]] exploration, discovering [[Franz Josef Land]] during an expedition which lasted from 1872 to 1874.\n\nLed by the naval officer [[Karl Weyprecht]] and the infantry officer and landscape artist [[Julius von Payer|Julius Payer]], the custom-built [[schooner]] ''Tegetthoff'' left [[Troms\u00f8]] in July 1872. At the end of August she got locked in pack-ice north of [[Novaya Zemlya]] and drifted to hitherto unknown polar regions. It was on this drift when the explorers discovered an archipelago which they named after [[Emperor]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]].\n\nIn May 1874 Payer decided to abandon the ice-locked ship and try to return by sledges and boats. On 14 August 1874 the expedition reached the open sea and on 3 September finally set foot on [[Russian Empire|Russia]]n mainland.\n\n===Between the centuries===\n====Crete Rebellion====\n{{main|Greco-Turkish War (1897)}}\nIn late 1896 a rebellion broke out on [[Ottoman Crete|Crete]], and on 21 January 1897 a [[Greece|Greek]] army landed in Crete to liberate the island from the [[Ottoman Empire]] and unite it with [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]]. The European powers, including [[Austria-Hungary]], intervened, and proclaimed Crete an [[Cretan State|international protectorate]]. Warships of the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine patrolled the waters off Crete in blockade of Ottoman naval forces. Crete remained in an anomalous position until finally ceded to Greece in 1913.\n\n====The Boxer Rebellion====\n{{main|Boxer Rebellion}}\nAustria-Hungary was part of the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in [[Qing Empire|China]] (1899\u20131901). As a member of the Allied nations, Austria sent two training ships and the cruisers {{SMS|Kaiserin und K\u00f6nigin Maria Theresia}}, {{SMS|Kaiserin Elisabeth}}, {{SMS|Aspern}}, and {{SMS|Zenta}} and a company of marines to the North China coast in April 1900, based at the Russia concession of [[L\u00fcshunkou|Port Arthur]].\n\nIn June they helped hold the [[Tianjin]] railway against [[Righteous Harmony Society|Boxer]] forces, and also fired upon several armed [[Junk (ship)|junks]] on the [[Hai River]] near [[Tongzhou District, Beijing|Tong-Tcheou]]. They also took part in the seizure of the [[Taku Forts]] commanding the approaches to Tianjin, and the boarding and capture of four Chinese [[destroyers]] by [[Roger Keyes, 1st Baron Keyes|Capt. Roger Keyes]] of {{HMS|Fame|1896|6}}. In all k.u.k. forces suffered few casualties during the rebellion.\n\nAfter the uprising a cruiser was maintained permanently on the China station, and a detachment of marines was deployed at the embassy in [[Peking]].\n\nLieutenant [[Georg Ludwig von Trapp]], who served as a submarine commander during World War I and became famous in the musical ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' after World War II, was decorated for bravery aboard {{SMS|Kaiserin und K\u00f6nigin Maria Theresia}} during the Rebellion.\n\n====Montenegro====\n{{main|First Balkan War}}\nDuring the [[First Balkan War]] Austria-Hungary joined [[German Empire|Germany]], [[French Third Republic|France]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] in blockading the seaport town of [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] (Antivari) in the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]].\n\n====European naval arms race====\n[[Image:Klasa radetzky.png|right|thumb|Scale drawing of a ''Radetzky''-class semi-dreadnought.]]\nAmong the many factors giving rise to World War I was the naval [[arms race]] between the [[British Empire]] and [[Imperial Germany]]. Germany enhanced her naval infrastructure, building new [[dry dock]]s, and enlarging the [[Kiel Canal]] to enable larger vessels to navigate it. However, that was not the only European naval arms race. Imperial Russia too had commenced building a new modern navy<ref>Greger, Ren\u00e9; & Watts, A. J. (1972). ''The Russian fleet, 1914-1917''.

Kriegsmarine had another prominent supporter at that time in the face of the [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]]. Like other imperial naval enthusiasts before him, Franz Ferdinand had a keen private interest in the fleet and was an energetic campaigner for naval matters.\n\n====The dreadnought era====\nIn 1906 Britain completed the battleship {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}, and it was so advanced that some argued that this rendered all previous battleships obsolete, although Britain and other countries kept pre-dreadnoughts in service.\n[[File:Tegetthoff.jpg|right|thumb|Dreadnought SMS ''Tegetthoff'', named after Admiral von Tegetthoff]]\nAustria-Hungary's [[Naval architecture|naval architects]], aware of the inevitable dominance of all big gun dreadnought type designs, then presented their case to the ''Marinesektion des Reichskriegsministeriums'' (Naval Section at the War Ministry) in [[Vienna]], which on 5 October 1908 ordered the construction of their own dreadnought, the first contract being awarded to 'Werft das [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] (STT)', the naval weaponry to be provided by the [[\u0160koda Works]] in [[Plze\u0148|Pilsen]]. The Marine budget for 1910 was substantially enlarged to permit major refits of the existing fleet and more dreadnoughts. The battleships {{SMS|Tegetthoff|1912|6}} and {{SMS|Viribus Unitis}} were both launched by the [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] at Trieste, amongst great rejoicing, on 24 June 1911, and 21 March 1912 respectively. They were followed by {{SMS|Prinz Eugen}}, and {{SMS|Szent Istv\u00e1n}}. These battleships, constructed later than many of the earlier British and German dreadnoughts, were considerably ahead in some aspects of design, especially of both the French and Italian navies, and were constructed with [[Marconi wireless]] rooms as well as anti-aircraft armaments. It has been claimed they were the first battleships in the world equipped with torpedo launchers built into their bows.<ref name=\"Wagner\">Wagner, Walter, & Gabriel, Erich, ''Die 'Tegetthoff' Klasse'', Vienna, January 1979.</ref>\n\nBetween 22 and 28 May 1914 ''Tegetthoff'', accompanied by ''Viribus Unitis'', made a courtesy visit to the British Mediterranean fleet in [[Malta]].<ref name=\"Wagner\" />\n\n====Submarine fleet====\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:SM U-3 (Austria-Hungary).jpg|thumb|right|Both members of the ''U-3'' class, {{SMS|U-3|Austria-Hungary|6|sub=y}} (''front'') and {{SMS|U-4|Austria-Hungary|6|sub=y}} (''right rear''), are seen here in this undated photograph.]] -->\n\n{{main|Austro-Hungarian U-boats}}\nIn 1904, after allowing the navies of other countries to pioneer submarine developments, the Austro-Hungarian Navy ordered the Austrian Naval Technical Committee (MTK) to produce a submarine design. The January 1905 design developed by the MTK and other designs submitted by the public as part of a design competition were all rejected by the Navy as impracticable. They instead opted to order two submarines each of designs by [[Simon Lake]], [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Germaniawerft]], and [[John Philip Holland]] for a competitive evaluation. The two Germaniawerft submarines comprised the ''U-3'' class.<ref name=Con-340>Gardiner, p. 340.</ref> The Navy authorized two boats, ''U-3'' and ''U-4'', from the Germaniawerft in 1906.<ref name=Gib-384>Gibson and Prendergast, p. 384.</ref>\n\nThe ''U-3''-class was an improved version of Germaniawerft's design for the [[Imperial German Navy]]'s first U-boat, {{SMU|U-1|Germany|2}},<ref name=Gib-384 /> and featured a double [[submarine hull|hull]] with internal [[saddle tank (submarine)|saddle tank]]s.

Following the Italian declaration of war [[Fleet in being|the mere fact of its existence]] tied up the [[Italian Navy]] and the [[French Navy]] in the Mediterranean for the duration of the war.\n\nFollowing the declaration of war in August 1914 the French and Montenegrin forces attempted to cause havoc at [[Kotor|Cattaro]], KuK Kriegsmarine's southernmost base in the Adriatic. Throughout September, October and November 1914 the navy bombarded the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] forces resulting in a decisive defeat for the latter, and again in January 1916 in what was called the [[Battle of Lov\u0107en]], which was instrumental in [[Montenegro]] being knocked out of the war early.\n[[File:SMU-5 Trapp.jpg|thumb|left|[[Linienschiffsleutnant]] [[Georg von Trapp|von Trapp]] on the bridge of [[SM U-5 (Austria-Hungary)|''U-5'']]]]\n\nOn 23 May 1915, when Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary, the Austro-Hungarian navy left their harbors in [[Pula|Pola (today Pula, Croatia)]], [[\u0160ibenik|Sebenico (today \u0160ibenik, Croatia)]] and [[Kotor|Cattaro (today Kotor, Montenegro)]]  to bombard the eastern Italian coast between Venice and [[Barletta]]. Main targets were the cities of [[Ancona]], [[Rimini]], [[Vieste]], [[Manfredonia]], Barletta and bridges and railway tracks along the coast. Until 1917 the Austro-Hungarian fleet was as yet largely undamaged.\n\nThe presence of three Allied navies in the Mediterranean made any measures of their co-ordination and common doctrine extraordinarily difficult. The Mediterranean was divided into eleven zones, of which the British naval authorities were responsible for four, the French for four, and the Italians for three. Differing command structures, national pride and the language barrier all contributed to a lack of cohesion in the application of Allied sea power, producing a situation in which German and Austro-Hungarian U-boat attacks on shipping flourished. An example of the lack of co-ordination was the sinking of the Italian troop transport ''Minas'' bound from Italy to [[Salonika]], which was torpedoed in one of the British zones in February 1917 with the loss of 870 lives, a British escort not understanding a message and failing to relieve the Italian destroyer, which turned around at the zone barrier.\n\n====Battle at Durazzo====\n{{main|Battle of Durazzo (1915)}}\n\nIn December 1915 a k.u.k. Kriegsmarine cruiser squadron attempted to make a raid on the [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbian]] troops evacuating [[Principality of Albania|Albania]]. After sinking a French submarine and bombarding the town of [[Durr\u00ebs|Durazzo]] the squadron ran into a minefield, sinking one destroyer and damaging another. The next day the group ran into a squadron of British, French, and Italian cruisers and destroyers. The resulting battle left two Austrian destroyers sunk and light damage to another, while dealing only minor damage to the Allied warships and others.\n\nA three-power conference on 28 April 1917, at [[Corfu]], discussed a more offensive strategy in the Adriatic, but the Italians were not prepared to consider any big ship operations, considering the size of the Austro-Hungarian fleet. The British and French seemed reluctant to move alone against the Austro-Hungarians, especially if it meant a full-scale battle. But the Austrians were not inactive either, and even as the Allied conference was in session they were planning an offensive operation against the Otranto Barrage.\n\n====Battle of the Otranto Straits====\n{{Main|Battle of the Strait of Otranto (1917)}}\n[[Image:Novaral.jpg|right|thumb|{{SMS|Novara|1912|6}} after the Battle of Otranto Straits]]\n[[File:Spomenik u utvrdi na Prevlaci.JPG|thumb|Monument for the \"Heroes of Otranto Battle\" on the [[Prevlaka]] in Croatia]]\n\nThroughout 1917 the Adriatic remained the key to the U-boat war on shipping in the Mediterranean. Cattaro, some 140 miles above the narrow Straits of Otranto, was the main U-boat base from which almost the entire threat to Mediterranean shipping came.\n\nThe [[Otranto Barrage]], constructed by the Allies with up to 120 [[naval drifter]]s, used to deploy and patrol submarine nets, and 30 motor launches, all equipped with depth charges, was designed to stop the passage of U-boats from Cattaro. However, this failed to do so, and from its inception in 1916, the barrage had caught only two U-boats, the Austrian {{SMS|U-6|Austria-Hungary|2|sub=y}} and the German {{SMU|UB-44||2}} out of hundreds of possible passages.\n\nHowever, the barrage effectively meant that the Austro-Hungarian surface fleet could not leave the [[Adriatic Sea]] unless it was willing to give battle to the blocking forces. This, and as the war drew on bringing supply difficulties especially coal, plus a fear of mines, limited the Austro-Hungarian navy to shelling the Italian and Serbian coastlines.\n\nThere had already been four small-scale Austro-Hungarian attacks on the barrage, on 11 March, 21 and 25 April and 5 May 1917, but none of them amounted to anything. Now greater preparations were made, with two U-boats despatched to lay mines off [[Brindisi]] with a third patrolling the exits in case Anglo-Italian forces were drawn out during the attack. The whole operation was timed for the night of 14/15 May, which led to the biggest battle of the Austro-Hungarian navy in World War I, the Battle of the Otranto Straits.\n\nThe first Austro-Hungarian warships to strike were the two [[destroyer]]s, {{SMS|Csepel}} and {{SMS|Balaton}}. An Italian convoy of three ships, escorted by the destroyer {{ship|Italian destroyer|Borea|1902|2}}, was approaching [[Vlor\u00eb|Valona]], when, out of the darkness, the Austrians fell upon them. ''Borea'' was left sinking. Of the three merchant ships, one loaded with ammunition was hit and blown up, a second set on fire, and the third hit. The two Austrian destroyers then steamed off northward.\n\nMeanwhile, three Austro-Hungarian [[cruiser]]s under the overall command of Captain [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]], {{SMS|Novara|1912|6}}, {{SMS|Saida}}, and {{SMS|Helgoland|1912|6}}, had actually passed a patrol of four French destroyers north of the barrage, and thought to be friendly ships passed unchallenged. They then sailed through the barrage before turning back to attack it. Each Austrian cruiser took one-third of the line and began slowly and systematically to destroy the barrage with their {{convert|4|in|cm|adj=on|order=flip}} guns, urging all Allies on board to abandon their ships first.\n\nDuring this battle the Allies lost two destroyers, 14 [[Naval drifter|drifters]] and one [[glider aircraft|glider]] while the Austro-Hungarian navy suffered only minor damage (''Novara''{{'}}s steam supply pipes were damaged by a shell) and few losses. The Austro-Hungarian navy returned to its bases up north in order to repair and re-supply, and the allies had to rebuild the blockade.\n\n====Cattaro Mutiny====\n{{main|Cattaro Mutiny}}\nIn February 1918 a mutiny started in the 5th Fleet stationed at the [[Gulf of Cattaro]] naval base. Sailors on up to 40 ships joined the mutiny over demands for better treatment and a call to end the war.\n\nThe mutiny failed to spread beyond Cattaro, and within three days a loyal naval squadron had arrived. Together with [[coastal artillery]] the squadron fired several shells into a few of the rebel's ships, and then assaulted them with [[k.u.k. Marine Infantry]] in a short and successful skirmish. About 800 sailors were imprisoned, dozens were court-martialed, and four seamen were executed, including the leader of the uprising, Franz Rasch, a [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemian]]. Given the huge crews required in naval vessels of that time this is an indication that the mutiny was limited to a minority.\n\n====Late World War I====\n[[File:Admiral Horthy, WW1 postcard.jpg|right|thumb|Admiral [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]]]]\nA second attempt to force the blockade took place in June 1918 under the command of Rear-Admiral [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy|Horthy]]. A surprise attack was planned, but the mission was doomed when the fleet was by chance spotted by an Italian [[MAS boat]] patrol, commanded by [[Luigi Rizzo]] that had already sunk, at anchor, the 25 year-old battleship {{SMS|Wien}} (5,785 tons) the year before. Rizzo's [[MAS boat]] launched two torpedoes, hitting one of the four Austrian [[dreadnought]]s, the {{SMS|Szent Istv\u00e1n}} which had already slowed down due to engine problems. The element of surprise lost, Horthy broke off his attack. Huge efforts were made by the crew to save ''Szent Istv\u00e1n'', which had been hit below the water-line, and the dreadnought battleship ''Tegetthoff'' took her in tow until a tug arrived. However just after 6 a.m., the [[pumps]] being unequal to the task, the ship, now listing badly, had to be abandoned. ''Szent Istv\u00e1n'' sank soon afterwards, taking 89 crewmen with her. The event was filmed from a sister ship.<ref name=\"Wagner\" />\n\nIn 1918, in order to avoid having to give the fleet to the victors, the Austrian Emperor handed down the entire Austro-Hungarian Navy and merchant fleet, with all harbours, arsenals and shore fortifications to the new [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]]. The state of SCS was proclaimed officially on 29 October 1918 but never recognized by other countries. Diplomatic notes were sent to the governments of France, the United Kingdom, Italy, the [[United States]] and Russia, to notify them that the State of SCS was not at war with any of them and that the Council had taken over the entire Austro-Hungarian fleet; no response was provided, and for all practical purposes the war went on unchanged. Austria asked for an armistice on 29 October; after a few days' negotiation and the signatures, the armistice entered into force on 4 November.\n\nOn 1 November 1918 two sailors of the Italian ''[[Regia Marina]]'', [[Raffaele Paolucci]] and [[Raffaele Rossetti]], rode a primitive manned torpedo (nicknamed the ''Mignatta'' or \"leech\") into the Austro-Hungarian naval base at Pola. Using [[limpet mine]]s, they then sank the anchored ''Viribus Unitis'', with considerable loss of life, as well as the freighter ''Wien''.<ref name=\"Warhola\">\n{{cite web\n| last = Warhola\n| first = Brian\n| date = January 1998\n| title = Assault on the Viribus Unitis\n| publisher = Old News\n| url = http://www.worldwar1.com/sfvu.htm\n| accessdate = 23 April 2010\n}}\n</ref> The French navy commandeered the new dreadnought {{ship|SMS|Prinz Eugen|1912|2}}, which they took to France and later used it for target practice in the Atlantic, where it was destroyed.<ref name=\"Wagner\" />\n\n==== Ships lost ====\n*Ships lost in World War I:<ref>Dario Petkovi\u0107: Ratna mornarica austro-ugarske monarhije, Pula 2004, Page 86, {{ISBN|953-6250-80-2}}</ref>\n** 1914: {{SMS|Kaiserin Elisabeth}} ([[Siege of Tsingtao]], 1914), {{SMS|Zenta}}, {{SMS|Flamingo}} (TB. 26)\n** 1915: {{SMS|U-12|Austria-Hungary|sub=y|6}}, {{SMS|U-3|Austria-Hungary|sub=y|6}}, {{SMS|Lika}}, {{SMS|Triglav}}\n** 1916: {{SMS|U-6|Austria-Hungary|sub=y|6}}, {{SMS|U-16|Austria-Hungary|sub=y|6}}\n** 1917: {{SMS|U-30|Austria-Hungary|sub=y|6}}, {{SMS|Wildfang}}, {{SMS|Wien}}, {{SMS|TB.XII}}, {{SMS|Inn}} (sunk by a Romanian mine)<ref>Angus Konstam, ''Gunboats of World War I'', p. 29</ref><ref>Ren\u00e9 Greger, ''Austro-Hungarian warships of World War I'', p. 142</ref><ref>Mark Axworthy, Cornel I.

Both Trieste and Pola had major shipbuilding facilities.<ref name=\"Hubmann\">Hubmann, Franz, & Wheatcroft, Andrew (editor), ''The Habsburg Empire, 1840\u20131916'', London, 1972, {{ISBN|0-7100-7230-9}}</ref> Pola's naval installations contained one of the largest floating [[drydock]]s in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. The city of Pola was also the site of the central church of the navy \"Stella Maris\" (''k.u.k. Marinekirche \"Stella Maris\"''), of the Austro-Hungarian Naval Observatory and the empire's naval [[military cemetery]] (''k.u.k. Marinefriedhof'').<ref>[http://www.pulainfo.hr/c1602/naval_cemetery_-_a_walk_through_the_history_of_pula/ Naval cemetery - a walk through the history of Pula]</ref> In 1990, the cemetery was restored after decades of neglect by the communist regime in Yugoslavia. The Austro-Hungarian Naval Academy (''k.u.k. Marine-Akademie'') was located in Fiume (now [[Rijeka]], Croatia).\n\nTrieste was also the headquarters of the merchant line [[\u00d6sterreichischer Lloyd]] (founded in 1836 and, later, Lloyd Triestino; now [[Italia Marittima]]), whose headquarters stood at the corner of the Piazza Grande and Sanita. By 1913, \u00d6sterreichischer Lloyd had a fleet of 62 ships comprising a total of 236,000 tons.<ref name=\"Hubmann\" />\n\n==Naval aviation: the k.u.k. Seefliegerkorps==\n[[File:The civil government at Grado Redenta (1917) (14780330784).jpg|thumb|300px|k.u.k hydroaircraft salvaged at [[Grado, Italy]]]]\nIn August 1916, the Imperial and Royal Naval Air Corps or k.u.k. Seeflugwesen was established. In 1917 it was rechristened the k.u.k. Seefliegerkorps. Its first aviators were naval officers who received their initial pilot training at the airfields of [[Wiener Neustadt]] in [[Lower Austria]], where the [[Theresian Military Academy]] is also located. They were first assigned for tours aboard the {{sclass-|Tegetthoff|battleship|2}}s. Later, the k.u.k. Seefliegerkorps also served at the following airfields in Albania and southern [[Dalmatia]]: [[Berat]], [[Kavaja]], [[Tirana]], [[Shkod\u00ebr|Scutari]] and [[Igalo]]. They also had airfields at [[Podgorica]] in [[Montenegro]].\n*'''Flik 1''' - Igalo from June - November 1918\n*'''Flik 6''' - Igalo from November 1915 - January 1916\n**- Scutari from January 1916 - June 1917\n**- Tirana from July 1917 - June 1918\n**- Banja from June - July 1918\n**- Tirana from July - September 1918\n**- Podgorica from September - November 1918\n*'''Flik 13''' - Berat from August - September 1918\n**- Kavaja from September - October 1918\nThe following Austrian squadrons served at [[Feltre]] also:\n*'''Flik 11''' - from February 1918\n*'''Flik 14''' - from June 1918 to November 1918\n*'''Flik 16''' - from November 1917 - October 1918\n*'''Flik 31''' - from June - July 1918\n*'''Flik 36''' - from June - July 1918\n*'''Flik 39''' - from January - May 1918\n*'''Flik 45''' - during April 1918\n*'''Flik 56''' - during December 1917\n*'''Flik 60J''' - from March - September 1918\n*'''Flik 66''' - from January 1918 - November 1918\n*'''Flik 101''' - during May 1918\nFeltre was captured by Austrian forces on 12 November 1917 after the [[Battle of Caporetto]]. There were two other military airfields nearby, at [[Arsie]] and [[Fonzaso]]. It was the main station for the Austrian naval aviators in that area. The k.u.k. Seeflugwesen used mostly modified German aircraft, but produced several variations of its own. Notable aircraft for the service were the following:\n* [[Fokker A.III]]\n* [[Fokker E.III]]\n* [[Hansa-Brandenburg B.I]]\n* [[Hansa-Brandenburg D.I]]\n* [[Aviatik D.I]]\n* [[Albatros W.4]]\n* [[Ph\u00f6nix D.I]]\n* [[Fokker D.VII]]\n* [[Lohner L]]\n\n==Problems affecting the navy==\nWhen it came to its financial and political position within the Empire, the  Austrian (and later Austro-Hungarian) Navy was a bit of an afterthought for most of the time it existed.\n\nOne reason was that sea power was never a priority of the Austrian foreign policy and that the Navy itself was relatively little known and supported by the public. Activities such as open days and naval clubs were unable to change the sentiment that the Navy was just something \"''expensive but far away''\". Another point was that naval expenditures were for most of the time overseen by the Austrian War Ministry, which was largely controlled by the [[Military history of Austria|Army]], the only exception being the  period before the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Battle of Lissa]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\nThe Navy was only able to draw significant public attention and funds during the three short periods it was actively supported by a member of the [[House of Habsburg|Imperial Family]]. The Archdukes [[Friedrich Ferdinand Leopold of Austria|Friedrich (1821\u20131847)]], [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Ferdinand Maximilian (1832\u20131867)]] and [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand (1863\u20131914)]] each a keen private interest in the fleet, held senior naval ranks and were energetic campaigners for naval matters. However, none lasted long as, Archduke Friedrich died early, Ferdinand Maximilian left Austria to become [[Emperor of Mexico]] and Franz Ferdinand was assassinated before he acceded the throne.\n\nThe Navy's problems were further exacerbated by the ten [[ethnic groups]] having more than 5% of the population comprising the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Officers had to speak at least four of the languages found in the Empire. [[Germans]] and [[Czechs]] generally were in signals and engine room duties, [[Hungarians]] became gunners, while [[Croats]] and [[Italians]] were seamen or stokers. The [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]] aimed to calm political dissatisfaction by creating the [[Dual Monarchy]], in which the [[Emperor of Austria]] was also the [[King of Hungary]]. This constitutional change was also reflected in the navy's title, which changed to \"Imperial and Royal Navy\" (kaiserlich und k\u00f6nigliche Kriegsmarine, short form K. u K. Kriegsmarine).\n\nBesides problems stemming from the difficulty of communicating efficiently within such a multilingual military, the Empire's battleship designs were generally a smaller tonnage than those of other European powers.\n\n==Notable personnel==\n* [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], Admiral.

The flag, formally adopted as ''Marineflagge'' (naval ensign) was based on the colours of the Archduchy of Austria. It served as the official flag also after the ''Ausgleich'' in 1867, when the Austrian navy became the Austro-Hungarian Navy.<ref>Alfred Freiherr von Koudelka: ''Unsere Kriegs-Marine.'' Vienna, 1899, pp.60-2</ref> During World War I, [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor Franz Joseph]] approved of a new design, which also contained the Hungarian arms. This flag, officially instituted in 1915, was however little used, and ships continued displaying the old Ensign until the end of the war. Photographs of Austro-Hungarian ships flying the post-1915 form of the Naval Ensign are therefore relatively rare.\n\n==See also ==\n\n* [[List of ships of the Austro-Hungarian Navy]]\n* [[List of Austro-Hungarian U-boats]]\n* [[The Adriatic Campaign of World War I]]\n* [[Mediterranean naval engagements during World War I]]\n\n==Notes==\n===Footnotes===\n{{notes\n| notes =\n\n{{efn\n| name = Torpedo\n|16 years later, the torpedo was invented by former Austrian naval officer [[Giovanni Luppis]] and British engineer [[Robert Whitehead]].\n}}\n\n{{efn\n| name = Venice1849\n|The first attempt in history to conduct an [[aerial bomb]]ardment took place during the siege of Venice.
