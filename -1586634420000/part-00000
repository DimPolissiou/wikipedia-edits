However, these are not [[evolution]]ary lineages; change of belly colour and increase of [[melanin]] have occurred independently several times in the wagtails, and the  colour patterns which actually indicate relationships are more subtle.\n\n[[mtDNA]] [[cytochrome b|cytochrome ''b'']] and [[NADH dehydrogenase]] [[Protein subunit|subunit]] 2 [[DNA sequence|sequence]] data (Voelker, 2002) is of limited use: the suspicion that there is a [[superspecies]] of probably 3 white-bellied, black-throated wagtails is confirmed. Also, there is another superspecies in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], three white-throated species with a black breast-band. The remaining five species are highly variable morphologically and their relationships with each other and with the two [[clade]]s have not yet been satisfactorily explained.\n\nThe origin of the genus appears to be in the general area of Eastern [[Siberia]]/Mongolia. Wagtails spread rapidly across Eurasia and dispersed to [[Africa]] in the [[Zanclean]] (Early [[Pliocene]])<ref>\nThe date of 4.5 [[mya (unit)|mya]] in Voelker (2002) is dubious as it does not rely upon hard data but is merely an estimate based on average values now known to be often wrong.</ref>\nwhere the sub-Saharan lineage was later isolated. The [[African pied wagtail]] (and possibly the [[Mekong wagtail]]) diverged prior to the massive radiation of the white-bellied black-throated and most yellow-bellied forms, all of which took place during the late [[Piacenzian]] (early Late Pliocene), c. 3 mya.\n\nThree species are poly- or paraphyletic in the present [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomical]] arrangement and either [[subspecies]] need to be reassigned and/or species split up. The [[western yellow wagtail|blue-headed wagtail]] (AKA yellow wagtail and many other names), especially, has always been a taxonomical nightmare with over a dozen currently accepted subspecies and many more invalid ones. The two remaining \"[[monochrome]]\" species, [[Mekong wagtail|Mekong]] and [[African pied wagtail]] may be closely related, or a most striking example of [[convergent evolution]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nPrehistoric wagtails known from [[fossils]] are ''Motacilla humata'' and ''Motacilla major''.\n\n==Characteristics==\nWagtails are slender, often colourful, ground-feeding [[insectivore]]s of open country in the [[Old World]]. Species of wagtail breed in Africa, Europe and Asia, some of which are fully or partially migratory.  Two species also breed in Alaska, and wintering birds may reach Australia.\n\nThey are ground nesters, laying up to six speckled [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s at a time.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Among their most conspicuous behaviours is a near constant tail wagging, a trait that has given the birds their common name. In spite of the ubiquity of the behaviour and observations of it, the reasons for it are poorly understood. It has been suggested that it may flush up prey, or that it may signal submissiveness to other wagtails. Recent studies have suggested instead that it is a signal of vigilance<ref>Randler, C (2006). \"Is tail wagging in white wagtails, ''Motacilla alba'', an honest signal of vigilance?\" ''Animal Behaviour'' '''71''' (5): 1089-1093</ref> that may aid to deter potential predators.<ref>Hasson, O.

However, these are not [[evolution]]ary lineages; change of belly colour and increase of [[melanin]] have occurred independently several times in the wagtails, and the  colour patterns which actually indicate relationships are more subtle.\n\n[[mtDNA]] [[cytochrome b|cytochrome ''b'']] and [[NADH dehydrogenase]] [[Protein subunit|subunit]] 2 [[DNA sequence|sequence]] data (Voelker, 2002) is of limited use: the suspicion that there is a [[superspecies]] of probably 3 white-bellied, black-throated wagtails is confirmed. Also, there is another superspecies in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], three white-throated species with a black breast-band. The remaining five species are highly variable morphologically and their relationships with each other and with the two [[clade]]s have not yet been satisfactorily explained.\n\nThe origin of the genus appears to be in the general area of Eastern [[Siberia]]/Mongolia. Wagtails spread rapidly across Eurasia and dispersed to [[Africa]] in the [[Zanclean]] (Early [[Pliocene]])<ref>\nThe date of 4.5 [[mya (unit)|mya]] in Voelker (2002) is dubious as it does not rely upon hard data but is merely an estimate based on average values now known to be often wrong.</ref>\nwhere the sub-Saharan lineage was later isolated. The [[African pied wagtail]] (and possibly the [[Mekong wagtail]]) diverged prior to the massive radiation of the white-bellied black-throated and most yellow-bellied forms, all of which took place during the late [[Piacenzian]] (early Late Pliocene), c. 3 mya.\n\nThree species are poly- or paraphyletic in the present [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomical]] arrangement and either [[subspecies]] need to be reassigned and/or species split up. The [[western yellow wagtail|blue-headed wagtail]] (AKA yellow wagtail and many other names), especially, has always been a taxonomical nightmare with over a dozen currently accepted subspecies and many more invalid ones. The two remaining \"[[monochrome]]\" species, [[Mekong wagtail|Mekong]] and [[African pied wagtail]] may be closely related, or a most striking example of [[convergent evolution]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nPrehistoric wagtails known from [[fossils]] are ''Motacilla humata'' and ''Motacilla major''.\n\n==Characteristics==\nWagtails are slender, often colourful, ground-feeding [[insectivore]]s of open country in the [[Old World]]. Species of wagtail breed in Africa, Europe and Asia, some of which are fully or partially migratory.  Two species also breed in Alaska, and wintering birds may reach Australia.\n\nThey are ground nesters, laying up to six speckled [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s at a time.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Among their most conspicuous behaviours is a near constant tail wagging, a trait that has given the birds their common name. In spite of the ubiquity of the behaviour and observations of it, the reasons for it are poorly understood. It has been suggested that it may flush up prey, or that it may signal submissiveness to other wagtails. Recent studies have suggested instead that it is a signal of vigilance<ref>Randler, C (2006). \"Is tail wagging in white wagtails, ''Motacilla alba'', an honest signal of vigilance?\" ''Animal Behaviour'' '''71''' (5): 1089-1093</ref> that may aid to deter potential predators.<ref>Hasson, O.

Lavoisier defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down into a simpler substance by a chemical reaction.<ref>Lavoisier with Robert Kerr, trans. (1790) ''Elements of Chemistry''. Edinburgh, Scotland: William Creech. [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=gri.ark:/13960/t5v735k9h;view=1up;seq=30 From p. xxiv:] \"I shall therefore only add upon this subject, that if, by the term ''elements'', we mean to express those simple and indivisible atoms of which matter is composed, it is extremely probable we know nothing at all about them; but, if we apply the term ''elements'', or ''principles of bodies'', to express our idea of the last point which analysis is capable of reaching, we must admit, as elements, all substances into which we are capable, by any means, to reduce bodies by decomposition. Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these substances we consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater number of principles; but, since these principles cannot be separated, or rather since we have not hitherto discovered means of separating them, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought never to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has proved them to be so.\"</ref> This simple definition served for a century and lasted until the discovery of [[subatomic particle]]s. Lavoisier's book contained a list of \"simple substances\" that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]] and [[sulfur]], which formed the basis for the modern list of elements. Lavoisier's list also included '[[light]]' and '[[Caloric theory|caloric]]', which at the time were believed to be material substances. He classified these substances into metals and non metals. While many leading [[chemist]]s refused to believe Lavoisier's new revelations, the ''Elementary Treatise'' was written well enough to convince the younger generation.

According to him, if the atomic weights were plotted as ordinates (i.e. vertically) and the atomic volumes as abscissae (i.e. horizontally)\u2014the curve obtained a series of maximums and minimums\u2014the most [[electropositive]] elements would appear at the peaks of the curve in the order of their atomic weights. In 1864, a book of his was published; it contained an early version of the periodic table containing 28 elements, and classified elements into six families by their [[valence (chemistry)|valence]]\u2014for the first time, elements had been grouped according to their valence. Works on organizing the elements by atomic weight had until then been stymied by inaccurate measurements of the atomic weights.<ref name=\"Meyer table\" /> In 1868, he revised his table, but this revision was published as a draft only after his death. In a paper dated December 1869 which appeared early in 1870, Meyer published a new periodic table of 55 elements, in which the series of periods are properly ended by an element of the alkaline earth metal group. The paper also included a line chart of relative atomic volumes, which illustrated periodic relationships of physical characteristics of the elements, and which assisted Meyer in deciding where elements should appear in his periodic table. By this time he had already seen the publication of Mendeleev's first periodic table, but his work appears to have been largely independent.<ref name=scerri06/>\n\nRussian chemist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] arranged the elements by [[atomic mass]], corresponding to relative [[molar mass]].

Mendeleev also figured some spots in his ordering had no element to match, and he left gaps on account of future discoveries of these elements, using the elements before and after those missing ones to predict their properties.

Although [[helium]] was discovered in 1868, its chemistry was not investigated at that time. In 1895, [[William Ramsay]] and [[Lord Rayleigh]] isolated [[argon]] from air and determined that it was a new element. Following this discovery, Ramsay noted that an entire group of gases, the [[noble gases]], was missing from the periodic table. Using [[fractional distillation]] to separate air, Ramsay discovered three more noble gases in 1898: [[neon]], [[krypton]], and [[xenon]]. Although Mendeleev's table predicted several undiscovered elements, it did not predict the existence of noble gases. Mendeleev added them to the table as Group 0 in 1902, without disturbing the basic concept of the periodic table.\n\nIn addition to the predictions of scandium, gallium, and germanium that were quickly realized, Mendeleev's 1871 table left many more spaces for undiscovered elements, though he did not provide detailed predictions of their properties. In total, he predicted eighteen elements, though only half corresponded to elements that were later discovered.<ref name=pastfuture/> He observed that an entire row of his table appeared to be missing between [[cerium]] and [[tantalum]], attributing this anomaly to the presumed nature of these elements.

However, Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nMoseley was determined to test Broek's hypothesis.<ref name=moseley2010/> After a year of investigation of the [[Fraunhofer lines]] of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray [[wavelength]] of an element and its atomic number.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=H.G.J.|title=The high-frequency spectra of the elements|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1914|volume=27|pages=703\u2013713|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002266051;view=1up;seq=731|series=6th series|doi=10.1080/14786440408635141}}</ref> With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table. Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical peroperties. For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place [[argon]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) before [[potassium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;19), [[cobalt]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;27) before [[nickel]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28), as well as [[tellurium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52) before [[iodine]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;53), in line with [[periodic trends]]. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nSwedish physicist [[Karl Siegbahn]] continued Moseley's work for elements heavier than gold (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;79), and found that the heaviest known element at the time, [[uranium]], had atomic number 92.

Many agreed that the next noble gas after radon would most likely have the atomic number 118, from which it followed that the transition series in the [[period 7 element|seventh period]] should resemble those in the [[period 6 element|sixth]]. Although it was thought that these transition series would include a series analogous to the rare earth elements, characterized by filling of the 5f shell, it was unknown where this series began. Predictions ranged from atomic number 90 (thorium) to 99, many of which proposed a beginning beyond the known elements (at or beyond atomic number 93).

In 1864, a book of his was published; it contained an early version of the periodic table containing 28 elements, and classified elements into six families by their [[valence (chemistry)|valence]]\u2014for the first time, elements had been grouped according to their valence. Works on organizing the elements by atomic weight had until then been stymied by inaccurate measurements of the atomic weights.<ref name=\"Meyer table\" /> In 1868, he revised his table, but this revision was published as a draft only after his death. In a paper dated December 1869 which appeared early in 1870, Meyer published a new periodic table of 55 elements, in which the series of periods are properly ended by an element of the alkaline earth metal group. The paper also included a line chart of relative atomic volumes, which illustrated periodic relationships of physical characteristics of the elements, and which assisted Meyer in deciding where elements should appear in his periodic table. By this time he had already seen the publication of Mendeleev's first periodic table, but his work appears to have been largely independent.<ref name=scerri06/>\n\nRussian chemist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] arranged the elements by [[atomic mass]], corresponding to relative [[molar mass]].

Mendeleev also figured some spots in his ordering had no element to match, and he left gaps on account of future discoveries of these elements, using the elements before and after those missing ones to predict their properties.

Although [[helium]] was discovered in 1868, its chemistry was not investigated at that time. In 1895, [[William Ramsay]] and [[Lord Rayleigh]] isolated [[argon]] from air and determined that it was a new element. Following this discovery, Ramsay noted that an entire group of gases, the [[noble gases]], was missing from the periodic table. Using [[fractional distillation]] to separate air, Ramsay discovered three more noble gases in 1898: [[neon]], [[krypton]], and [[xenon]]. Although Mendeleev's table predicted several undiscovered elements, it did not predict the existence of noble gases. Mendeleev added them to the table as Group 0 in 1902, without disturbing the basic concept of the periodic table.\n\nIn addition to the predictions of scandium, gallium, and germanium that were quickly realized, Mendeleev's 1871 table left many more spaces for undiscovered elements, though he did not provide detailed predictions of their properties. In total, he predicted eighteen elements, though only half corresponded to elements that were later discovered.<ref name=pastfuture/> He observed that an entire row of his table appeared to be missing between [[cerium]] and [[tantalum]], attributing this anomaly to the presumed nature of these elements.

For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place [[argon]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) before [[potassium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;19), [[cobalt]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;27) before [[nickel]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28), as well as [[tellurium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52) before [[iodine]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;53), in line with [[periodic trends]]. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nSwedish physicist [[Karl Siegbahn]] continued Moseley's work for elements heavier than gold (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;79), and found that the heaviest known element at the time, [[uranium]], had atomic number 92. In determining the largest identified atomic number, gaps in the atomic number sequence were conclusively determined where an atomic number had no known corresponding element; the gaps occurred at atomic numbers 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nIn the 1910s and 1920s, pioneering research into [[quantum mechanics]] led to new developments in atomic theory and small changes to the periodic table. The [[Bohr model]] was developed during this time, and championed the idea of [[electron configuration]]s that determine chemical properties. Bohr proposed that elements in the same group behaved similarly because they have similar electron configurations, and that noble gases had filled [[valence (chemistry)|valence]] shells;<ref name=scerri98>{{cite journal |last1=Scerri |first1=E.R. |title=The Evolution of the Periodic System |journal=Scientific American |date=1998 |volume=279 |issue=3 |pages=78\u201383 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0998-78 |url=https://mipt.ru/dasr/upload/62f/f_brx2-arphh81ii9w.pdf}}</ref> this forms the basis of the modern [[octet rule]].

Instead, the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] was developed. This states that no electrons can coexist in the same quantum state, and showed, in conjunction with empirical observations, the existence of four [[quantum number]]s and the consequence on the order of shell filling.<ref name=scerri98/> This determines the order in which [[electron shell]]s are filled and explains the periodicity of the periodic table.\n\nBritish chemist Charles Bury is credited with the first use of the term ''transition metal'' in 1921 to refer to elements between the [[main-group element]]s of groups II and III. He explained the chemical properties of transition elements as a consequence of the filling of an inner subshell rather than the valence shell. This proposition, based upon the work of American chemist [[Gilbert N. Lewis]], suggested the appearance of the ''d'' subshell in period&nbsp;4 and the ''f''-subshell in period&nbsp;6, lengthening the periods from 8 to 18 and then 18 to 32 elements.<ref name=Jensen>{{cite journal |journal = Journal of Chemical Education |volume = 80 |issue = 8 |year = 2003 |url = http://www.uv.es/~borrasj/ingenieria_web/temas/tema_1/lecturas_comp/p952.pdf |title = The Place of Zinc, Cadmium, and Mercury in the Periodic Table |first = William B. |last = Jensen |pages=952\u2013961 |doi = 10.1021/ed080p952 |bibcode = 2003JChEd..80..952J }}</ref>\n\n==Looking for expansions and the end of the periodic table==\nAs early as 1913, Bohr's research on [[electronic structure]] led physicists such as [[Johannes Rydberg]] to extrapolate the properties of undiscovered elements heavier than uranium. Many agreed that the next noble gas after radon would most likely have the atomic number 118, from which it followed that the transition series in the [[period 7 element|seventh period]] should resemble those in the [[period 6 element|sixth]]. Although it was thought that these transition series would include a series analogous to the rare earth elements, characterized by filling of the 5f shell, it was unknown where this series began. Predictions ranged from atomic number 90 (thorium) to 99, many of which proposed a beginning beyond the known elements (at or beyond atomic number 93). The elements from [[actinium]] to uranium were instead believed to form part of a fourth series of transition metals because of their high [[oxidation state]]s; accordingly, they were placed in groups 3 through 6.<ref name=seaborg2>{{cite book |last=Seaborg |first=G. |title=Lanthanides/Actinides: Chemistry |chapter=Origin of the Actinide Concept |series=Handbook on the Physics and Chemistry of Rare Earths |volume=18 |edition=1 |date=1994 |isbn=9780444536648 |id=LBL-31179 |chapter-url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt7cz371hx/qt7cz371hx.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, [[neptunium]] and [[plutonium]] were the first [[transuranic element]]s to be discovered; they were placed in sequence beneath [[rhenium]] and [[osmium]], respectively. However, preliminary investigations of their chemistry suggested a greater similarity to uranium than to lighter transition metals, challenging their placement in the periodic table.<ref name=clark/> During his [[Manhattan Project]] research in 1943, [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] experienced unexpected difficulties in isolating the elements [[americium]] and [[curium]], as they were believed to be part of a fourth series of transition metals.

The actinide series is the second row of the f-block (5f series), and comprises the elements from [[actinium]] to [[lawrencium]]. In both the actinide and lanthanide series, an inner [[electron shell]] is being filled.\n\nSeaborg's subsequent elaborations of the actinide concept theorized a series of [[Transuranium element|superheavy elements]] in a [[transactinide]] series comprising elements from [[Rutherfordium|104]] to [[Unbiunium|121]] and a [[superactinide]] series of elements from [[Unbibium|122]] to 153.<ref name=clark /> He proposed an [[extended periodic table]] with an additional period of 50&nbsp;elements (thus reaching element&nbsp;168); this eighth period was derived from an extrapolation of the [[Aufbau principle]] and placed elements&nbsp;121 to&nbsp;138 in a g-block, in which a new g subshell would be filled.<ref name=transu1>{{cite book |last=Hoffman |first=D.C |last2=Ghiorso |first2=A. |last3=Seaborg |first3=G.T. |title=The Transuranium People: The Inside Story |publisher=Imperial College Press |date=2000 |isbn=978-1-86094-087-3 |page=435\u2013436}}</ref> Seaborg's model, however, did not take into account [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]] resulting from high atomic number and electron orbital speed.

It is now thought that because of relativistic effects, such an extension will feature elements that break the periodicity in known elements, thus posing another hurdle to future periodic table constructs.<ref name=PT172/>\n\nThe discovery of [[tennessine]] in 2010 filled the last remaining gap in the seventh period. Any newly discovered elements will thus be placed in an eighth period.\n\nDespite the completion of the seventh period, experimental chemistry of some transactinides has been shown to be inconsistent with the periodic law. In the 1990s, Ken Czerwinski at [[University of California, Berkeley]] observed similarities between rutherfordium and plutonium and dubnium and protactinium, rather than a clear continuation of periodicity in groups&nbsp;4 and&nbsp;5. More recent experiments on [[copernicium]] and [[flerovium]] have yielded inconsistent results, some of which suggest that these elements behave more like the noble gas [[radon]] rather than mercury and lead, their respective [[congener (chemistry)|congener]]s. As such, the chemistry of many superheavy elements has yet to be well-characterized, and it remains unclear whether the periodic law can still be used to extrapolate the properties of undiscovered elements.<ref name=\"NYT-20190827\">{{cite news |last=Roberts |first=Siobhan |title=Is It Time to Upend the Periodic Table? - The iconic chart of elements has served chemistry well for 150 years.
