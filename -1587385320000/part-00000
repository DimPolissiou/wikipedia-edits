In [[Atlanta]] and New York City the marches were called ''Gay Liberation Marches'', and the day of celebration was called \"Gay Liberation Day\"; in Los Angeles and San Francisco they became known as 'Gay Freedom Marches' and the day was called \"Gay Freedom Day\". As more cities and even smaller towns began holding their own celebrations, these names spread. The rooted ideology behind the parades is a critique of space which has been produced to seem [[heteronormative]] and 'straight', and therefore any act appearing to be homosexual is considered dissident by society. The Parade brings this homosexual behaviour into the space.\n\nIn the 1980s, there was a cultural shift in the gay movement.

The variation is largely dependent upon the political, economic, and religious settings of the area. However, in more accepting cities, the parades take on a festive or even [[Mardi Gras]]-like character, whereby the political stage is built on notions of celebration. Large parades often involve floats, dancers, [[drag queen]]s and amplified music; but even such celebratory parades usually include political and educational contingents, such as local politicians and marching groups from LGBT institutions of various kinds. Other typical parade participants include local LGBT-friendly churches such as [[Metropolitan Community Church]]es, [[United Church of Christ]], and [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] Churches, [[PFLAG]], and LGBT employee associations from large businesses.\n\nEven the most festive parades usually offer some aspect dedicated to remembering victims of [[AIDS]] and anti-LGBT violence. Some particularly important pride parades are funded by governments and [[corporate sponsorship|corporate sponsors]] and promoted as major [[tourist attraction]]s for the cities that host them. In some countries, some pride parades are now also called Pride Festivals. Some of these festivals provide a carnival-like atmosphere in a nearby park or city-provided closed-off street, with information booths, music concerts, barbecues, beer stands, contests, sports, and games. The 'dividing line' between onlookers and those marching in the parade can be hard to establish in some events, however, in cases where the event is received with hostility, such a separation becomes very obvious. There have been studies considering how the relationship between participants and onlookers is affected by the divide, and how space is used to critique the heteronormative nature of society.\n\nThough the reality was that the Stonewall riots themselves, as well as the immediate and the ongoing political organizing that occurred following them, were events fully participated in by lesbian women, bisexual people, and transgender people, as well as by gay men of all races and backgrounds, historically these events were first named ''Gay'', the word at that time being used in a more generic sense to cover the entire spectrum of what is now variously called the 'queer' or LGBT community.<ref>{{cite web|title=Obituary for Sylvia Rae Rivera|url=http://www.sylviasplace.org/sylvia_obituary.htm|publisher=Sylvia's Place|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928113130/http://www.sylviasplace.org/sylvia_obituary.htm|archivedate=September 28, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://gender.org/remember/people/marshajohnson.html |title=Marsha P.

The language has become more accurate and inclusive, though these changes met with initial resistance from some in their own communities who were unaware of the historical events.<ref>[http://www.nyabn.org/Pages/WhoWeR/OurHistory.html New York Area Bisexual Network: A Brief History of NYC's Bisexual Community].

In 1996, 1997 and 1998 large and significant marches were organized and produced by Reachout AIDS Foundation, all of which were held in Malate, Manila, Philippines. In 1998, the year of the centennial commemoration of the Republic of the Philippines, a Gay and Lesbian Pride March was incorporated in the mammoth \"citizens' parade\" which was part of the official centennial celebration. That parade culminated in \"marching by\" the President of the Philippines, His Excellency Joseph Estrada, at the Quirino Grandstand in Luneta Park in Manila.\n\nIn 1999, Task Force Pride Philippines (TFP), a network of LGBT and LGBT-friendly groups and individuals seeking to promote positive visibility for the LGBT community was born.

Concerned that the prevailing economic and political crisis in the country at the time presented threats to freedoms and liberties of all Filipinos, including sexual and gender minorities, LGBT individuals and groups, non-government organizations and members of various communities and sectors organized the LGBT Freedom March calling for systemic and structural change. At historic Plaza Miranda, in front of Quiapo Church, despite the pouring rain, a program with performances and speeches depicting LGBT pride was held soon after the march.\nOn December 6, 2014, Philippines will be celebrating the 20th anniversary of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150709154531/http://metromanilapride.org/ Metro Manila Pride] March with the theme: Come Out For Love ''Kasi Pag-ibig Pa Rin'' (Come Out For Love Because It's Still All About Love). The theme is a reminder of the love and passion that started and sustained 20 years of taking to the streets for the recognition and respect of LGBT lives as human lives. It is also a celebration of and an invitation for families, friends, and supporters of LGBT people to claim Metro Manila Pride as a safe space to voice their support for the community, for the LGBT human rights advocacy, and for the people they love and march with every year.\n\nThe 21st Metro Manila Pride March in 2015, entitled Fight For Love, was held on the 25th of July.

Out of all ex-[[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] states, at that time only [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] had a tradition of organising Pride events, whereas the attempt to organize such an event in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]] in 2001, ended in a bloody showdown between the police and the counter-protesters, with the participants heavily beaten up. This manifestation was held in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]] from June 22\u201325, 2006 and brought together representatives of those Eastern European and [[Balkans|Southeastern European]] countries where the sociopolitical climate is not ripe for the organization of Prides, or where such a manifestation is expressly forbidden by the authorities. From 13 countries that participated, only [[Poland]], [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Romania]] and [[Latvia]] have been organizing Prides. [[Slovakia]] also hosted the pride, but encountered many problems with Slovak extremists from [[Slovenska pospolitost]] (the pride did not cross the centre of the city). [[Republic of Macedonia|North Macedonia]] and [[Albania]] also host Pride Parades with no major issues arising, mainly due to the protection from police. [[Lithuania]] has never had Prides before. There were also representatives from [[Kosovo]], that participated apart from Serbia. It was the very first Pride organized jointly with other states and nations, which only ten years ago have been at war with each other. Weak cultural, political and social cooperation exists among these states, with an obvious lack of public encouragement for solidarity, which organizers hoped to initiate through that regional Pride event. The host and the initiator of The Internationale LGBT Pride was [[Zagreb Pride]], which has been held since 2002.\n\n====Bosnia and Herzegovina====\nThe first Pride parade in Bosnia and Herzegovina was held on 8 September 2019 in Sarajevo under the slogan ''Ima Iza\u0107' '' (Coming Out). Around 4000 people, including foreign diplomats, members of the local government and celebrities participated amidst a strong police presence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ba.n1info.com/Vijesti/a376875/Bez-ijednog-incidenta-Zavrsena-prva-Bh.-povorka-ponosa-u-Sarajevu.html|title=Bez ijednog incidenta: Zavr\u0161ena prva Bh. povorka ponosa u Sarajevu|publisher=N1}}</ref> \n\n====Bulgaria====\nLike the other countries from the [[Balkan]]s, Bulgaria's population is very conservative when it comes to issues like [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]]. Although homosexuality was decriminalized in 1968, people with different sexual orientations and identities are still not well accepted in society. In 2003 the country enacted several laws protecting the [[LGBT]] community and individuals from discrimination. In 2008, Bulgaria organized its first ever pride parade. The almost 200 people who had gathered were attacked by [[skinhead]]s, but police managed to prevent any injuries. The 2009 pride parade, with the motto \"Rainbow Friendship\" attracted more than 300 participants from [[Bulgaria]] and tourists from [[Greece]] and [[UK|Great Britain]]. There were no disruptions and the parade continued as planned. A third Pride parade took place successfully in 2010, with close to 800 participants and an outdoor concert event.\n\n====Croatia====\n{{see also|LGBT rights in Croatia#LGBT prides and other marches}}\nFirst pride parade in Croatia was held on 29 June 2002 in [[Zagreb Pride|Zagreb]] and has been held annually ever since.

In its current format, it has been held every year since 1996, where Copenhagen hosted EuroPride. Before 1994 the national LGBT association organised demonstration-like freedom marches. Copenhagen Pride is a colourful and festive occasion, combining political issues with concerts, films and a parade. The focal point is the [[City Hall Square, Copenhagen|City Hall Square]] in the city centre. It usually opens on the Wednesday of Pride Week, culminating on the Saturday with a parade and Denmark's Mr Gay contest. In 2017, some 25,000 people took part in the parade with [[float (parade)|floats]] and flags, and about 300,000 were out in the streets to experience it.<ref>{{cite web |title=K\u00e6mpe-optog: 300.000 f\u00f8lger Pride gennem K\u00f8benhavn|url=https://www.avisen.dk/300000-foelger-farverigt-optog-i-hovedstadens-gader_458063.aspx|publisher=avisen.dk |date=19 August 2017|accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe smaller [[Aarhus Pride]] in held every year in June in the [[Jutland]]ic city of [[Aarhus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://good-evening-europe.dk/2017/06/06/video-aarhus-pride-2017-parade-prisuddeling-og-underholdning-topklasse/ |title=Aarhus Pride 2017 \u2013 Parade, prisuddeling og underholdning i topklasse! |publisher=good-evening-europe.dk |language=Danish |date=6 June 2017 |accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Estonia====\n\nThe [[Baltic Pride]] event was held in Tallinn in 2011, 2014 and 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://balticpride.org/about/|title=About|website=balticpride.org|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-19}}</ref>\n\n====Finland====\nThe [[Helsinki Pride]] was first time organized in 1975 and called ''Freedom Day''.

Independent media estimated that more than 200,000 visitors came from foreign countries to join in the festivities. Madrid gay district [[Chueca]], the biggest gay district in Europe, was the centre of the celebrations. The event was supported by the city, regional and national government and private sector which also ensured that the event was financially successful.

In [[Atlanta]] and New York City the marches were called ''Gay Liberation Marches'', and the day of celebration was called \"Gay Liberation Day\"; in Los Angeles and San Francisco they became known as 'Gay Freedom Marches' and the day was called \"Gay Freedom Day\". As more cities and even smaller towns began holding their own celebrations, these names spread. The rooted ideology behind the parades is a critique of space which has been produced to seem [[heteronormative]] and 'straight', and therefore any act appearing to be homosexual is considered dissident by society. The Parade brings this homosexual behaviour into the space.\n\nIn the 1980s, there was a cultural shift in the gay movement.

The variation is largely dependent upon the political, economic, and religious settings of the area. However, in more accepting cities, the parades take on a festive or even [[Mardi Gras]]-like character, whereby the political stage is built on notions of celebration. Large parades often involve floats, dancers, [[drag queen]]s and amplified music; but even such celebratory parades usually include political and educational contingents, such as local politicians and marching groups from LGBT institutions of various kinds. Other typical parade participants include local LGBT-friendly churches such as [[Metropolitan Community Church]]es, [[United Church of Christ]], and [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] Churches, [[PFLAG]], and LGBT employee associations from large businesses.\n\nEven the most festive parades usually offer some aspect dedicated to remembering victims of [[AIDS]] and anti-LGBT violence. Some particularly important pride parades are funded by governments and [[corporate sponsorship|corporate sponsors]] and promoted as major [[tourist attraction]]s for the cities that host them. In some countries, some pride parades are now also called Pride Festivals. Some of these festivals provide a carnival-like atmosphere in a nearby park or city-provided closed-off street, with information booths, music concerts, barbecues, beer stands, contests, sports, and games. The 'dividing line' between onlookers and those marching in the parade can be hard to establish in some events, however, in cases where the event is received with hostility, such a separation becomes very obvious. There have been studies considering how the relationship between participants and onlookers is affected by the divide, and how space is used to critique the heteronormative nature of society.\n\nThough the reality was that the Stonewall riots themselves, as well as the immediate and the ongoing political organizing that occurred following them, were events fully participated in by lesbian women, bisexual people, and transgender people, as well as by gay men of all races and backgrounds, historically these events were first named ''Gay'', the word at that time being used in a more generic sense to cover the entire spectrum of what is now variously called the 'queer' or LGBT community.<ref>{{cite web|title=Obituary for Sylvia Rae Rivera|url=http://www.sylviasplace.org/sylvia_obituary.htm|publisher=Sylvia's Place|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928113130/http://www.sylviasplace.org/sylvia_obituary.htm|archivedate=September 28, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://gender.org/remember/people/marshajohnson.html |title=Marsha P.

The language has become more accurate and inclusive, though these changes met with initial resistance from some in their own communities who were unaware of the historical events.<ref>[http://www.nyabn.org/Pages/WhoWeR/OurHistory.html New York Area Bisexual Network: A Brief History of NYC's Bisexual Community].

In 1996, 1997 and 1998 large and significant marches were organized and produced by Reachout AIDS Foundation, all of which were held in Malate, Manila, Philippines. In 1998, the year of the centennial commemoration of the Republic of the Philippines, a Gay and Lesbian Pride March was incorporated in the mammoth \"citizens' parade\" which was part of the official centennial celebration.

Concerned that the prevailing economic and political crisis in the country at the time presented threats to freedoms and liberties of all Filipinos, including sexual and gender minorities, LGBT individuals and groups, non-government organizations and members of various communities and sectors organized the LGBT Freedom March calling for systemic and structural change. At historic Plaza Miranda, in front of Quiapo Church, despite the pouring rain, a program with performances and speeches depicting LGBT pride was held soon after the march.\nOn December 6, 2014, Philippines will be celebrating the 20th anniversary of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150709154531/http://metromanilapride.org/ Metro Manila Pride] March with the theme: Come Out For Love ''Kasi Pag-ibig Pa Rin'' (Come Out For Love Because It's Still All About Love). The theme is a reminder of the love and passion that started and sustained 20 years of taking to the streets for the recognition and respect of LGBT lives as human lives. It is also a celebration of and an invitation for families, friends, and supporters of LGBT people to claim Metro Manila Pride as a safe space to voice their support for the community, for the LGBT human rights advocacy, and for the people they love and march with every year.\n\nThe 21st Metro Manila Pride March in 2015, entitled Fight For Love, was held on the 25th of July.

Out of all ex-[[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] states, at that time only [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] had a tradition of organising Pride events, whereas the attempt to organize such an event in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]] in 2001, ended in a bloody showdown between the police and the counter-protesters, with the participants heavily beaten up. This manifestation was held in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]] from June 22\u201325, 2006 and brought together representatives of those Eastern European and [[Balkans|Southeastern European]] countries where the sociopolitical climate is not ripe for the organization of Prides, or where such a manifestation is expressly forbidden by the authorities. From 13 countries that participated, only [[Poland]], [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Romania]] and [[Latvia]] have been organizing Prides. [[Slovakia]] also hosted the pride, but encountered many problems with Slovak extremists from [[Slovenska pospolitost]] (the pride did not cross the centre of the city). [[Republic of Macedonia|North Macedonia]] and [[Albania]] also host Pride Parades with no major issues arising, mainly due to the protection from police. [[Lithuania]] has never had Prides before. There were also representatives from [[Kosovo]], that participated apart from Serbia. It was the very first Pride organized jointly with other states and nations, which only ten years ago have been at war with each other. Weak cultural, political and social cooperation exists among these states, with an obvious lack of public encouragement for solidarity, which organizers hoped to initiate through that regional Pride event. The host and the initiator of The Internationale LGBT Pride was [[Zagreb Pride]], which has been held since 2002.\n\n====Bosnia and Herzegovina====\nThe first Pride parade in Bosnia and Herzegovina was held on 8 September 2019 in Sarajevo under the slogan ''Ima Iza\u0107' '' (Coming Out). Around 4000 people, including foreign diplomats, members of the local government and celebrities participated amidst a strong police presence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ba.n1info.com/Vijesti/a376875/Bez-ijednog-incidenta-Zavrsena-prva-Bh.-povorka-ponosa-u-Sarajevu.html|title=Bez ijednog incidenta: Zavr\u0161ena prva Bh. povorka ponosa u Sarajevu|publisher=N1}}</ref> \n\n====Bulgaria====\nLike the other countries from the [[Balkan]]s, Bulgaria's population is very conservative when it comes to issues like [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]]. Although homosexuality was decriminalized in 1968, people with different sexual orientations and identities are still not well accepted in society. In 2003 the country enacted several laws protecting the [[LGBT]] community and individuals from discrimination. In 2008, Bulgaria organized its first ever pride parade. The almost 200 people who had gathered were attacked by [[skinhead]]s, but police managed to prevent any injuries. The 2009 pride parade, with the motto \"Rainbow Friendship\" attracted more than 300 participants from [[Bulgaria]] and tourists from [[Greece]] and [[UK|Great Britain]]. There were no disruptions and the parade continued as planned. A third Pride parade took place successfully in 2010, with close to 800 participants and an outdoor concert event.\n\n====Croatia====\n{{see also|LGBT rights in Croatia#LGBT prides and other marches}}\nFirst pride parade in Croatia was held on 29 June 2002 in [[Zagreb Pride|Zagreb]] and has been held annually ever since.

In its current format, it has been held every year since 1996, where Copenhagen hosted EuroPride. Before 1994 the national LGBT association organised demonstration-like freedom marches. Copenhagen Pride is a colourful and festive occasion, combining political issues with concerts, films and a parade. The focal point is the [[City Hall Square, Copenhagen|City Hall Square]] in the city centre. It usually opens on the Wednesday of Pride Week, culminating on the Saturday with a parade and Denmark's Mr Gay contest. In 2017, some 25,000 people took part in the parade with [[float (parade)|floats]] and flags, and about 300,000 were out in the streets to experience it.<ref>{{cite web |title=K\u00e6mpe-optog: 300.000 f\u00f8lger Pride gennem K\u00f8benhavn|url=https://www.avisen.dk/300000-foelger-farverigt-optog-i-hovedstadens-gader_458063.aspx|publisher=avisen.dk |date=19 August 2017|accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe smaller [[Aarhus Pride]] in held every year in June in the [[Jutland]]ic city of [[Aarhus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://good-evening-europe.dk/2017/06/06/video-aarhus-pride-2017-parade-prisuddeling-og-underholdning-topklasse/ |title=Aarhus Pride 2017 \u2013 Parade, prisuddeling og underholdning i topklasse! |publisher=good-evening-europe.dk |language=Danish |date=6 June 2017 |accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Estonia====\n\nThe [[Baltic Pride]] event was held in Tallinn in 2011, 2014 and 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://balticpride.org/about/|title=About|website=balticpride.org|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-19}}</ref>\n\n====Finland====\nThe [[Helsinki Pride]] was first time organized in 1975 and called ''Freedom Day''.

They used the reward-cost matrices from the [[Game theory|Game Theory]] and discovered some clues of individuals\u2019 interdependence such as the power of a party over each other. Also known as the \u201ccorrespondence\u201d versus \u201cnoncorrespondence\u201d of outcomes. Additionally, they suggest that an individual can unilaterally affect her or his own outcomes in a relationship through chosen behaviors. They could predict the possible course of a social interaction through the analysis of aspects of power in an encounter. They also experimented on how the outcomes received in a relationship could define a person's attractions to relationships.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Homans ====\nHomans based his theory on concepts of equilibration, expectancy and distribute justice in dyadic exchange. With this, he tries to explain the social interaction in small groups and the rewards received proportional to their costs and investments. Homans summarizes the system in three propositions: success, stimulus, and deprivation\u2013satiation proposition,<ref name=Emerson /> described below.\n\n#Success proposition: When one finds they are rewarded for their actions, they tend to repeat the action.\n#Stimulus proposition: The more often a particular stimulus has resulted in a reward in the past, the more likely it is that a person will respond to it.\n#Deprivation\u2013satiation proposition: The more often in the recent past a person has received a particular reward, the less valuable any further unit of that reward becomes.\n\n==== Blau ====\nBlau's theory is very similar to Homans\u2019. However, he uses more economics terms and it is based principally on emergent social structure in social exchange patterns in small groups.<ref name=\":0\" /> His theory analyzes the development of exchange theory in economics without emphasizing on the psychological assumptions. He contributed to the idea of distinguishing between social and economic exchanges and exchange and power.

He focused on the interaction and relationship between individuals and parties. His view of social exchange theory emphasizes the resource availability, power, and dependence as primary dynamics.\u00a0 He thought that relations were organized in different manners, and they could differ depending on the type and amour of the resources exchanged.

The elements of relational life include:\n\n'''Costs''' are the elements of relational life that have negative value to a person, such as the effort put into a relationship and the negatives of a partner.<ref>{{cite book\n | last=West | first=Richard\n | last2=Turner | first2=Lynn\n | year=2007\n | title=Introducing Communication Theory\n | pages=186\u20137\n | publisher=McGraw Hill}}</ref> (Costs can be time, money, effort etc.)\n\n'''Rewards''' are the elements of a relationship that have positive value. (Rewards can be sense of acceptance, support, and companionship etc.)\n\nAs with everything dealing with the social exchange theory, it has as its outcome satisfaction and dependence of relationships. The social-exchange perspective argues that people calculate the overall worth of a particular relationship by subtracting its costs from the rewards it provides.<ref>{{cite book\n | last=P.R. | first=Monge\n | last2=N. | first2=Contractor\n | year=2003\n | title=Theories of communication networks\n | publisher=Oxford University Press}}{{page needed|date=October 2014}}</ref>\n\n:{{math|Worth {{=}} Rewards \u2212 Costs}}\n\nIf worth is a positive number, it is a positive relationship. On the contrary, a negative number indicates a negative relationship. The worth of a relationship influences its outcome, or whether people will continue with a relationship or terminate it. Positive relationships are expected to endure, whereas negative relationships will probably terminate. In a mutually beneficial exchange, each party supplies the wants of the other party at lower cost to self than the value of the resources the other party provides. In such a model, mutual relationship satisfaction ensures relationship stability.<ref name=\"georgetown2005\"/>\n\n:{{math|Outcome {{=}} Rewards \u2212 Costs}}\nHomans based his theory on [[behaviorism]] to conclude that people pursue rewards to minimize costs.  The \"satisfactory-ness\" of the rewards that a party gains from an exchange relationship is judged relative to some standard, which may vary from party to party.<ref name=\"Lambe, C. Jay 2001\"/>\n\n=== Reciprocity Norm ===\nSummarized by Gouldner, the [[Reciprocity norm (negotiation)|reciprocity norm]] states that a benefit should be returned and the one who gives the benefit should not be harmed. This is used to stabilize relationships and to identify the egoism. This norm suggests the independence in relationships and invite the individual to consider more than one's self-interest.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/estappliedpsyc/reciprocity_norm/0|title=Encyclopedia of Applied Psychology|last=Spielberger|first=Charles Donald|date=2004|access-date=2018-12-08}}</ref>\n\n=== The Social Penetration Theory ===\n\nI. Altman and D. Taylor's: They introduce the [[social penetration theory]], which states the nature and quality of social exchange and close bonds. It suggests once the individuals start to give more of themselves to one another, relationships progress progressively from exchanging superficial goods to others more meaningful. It progresses to the point called \u201cself-disclosure\u201d, where the individuals share innermost thoughts and feelings with one another.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Equity and inequity ===\nIn this process, the individuals will compare their rewards with others\u2019 in relation to their costs. Equity can be defined as the balance between a person's inputs and outcomes on the job. Some examples of inputs can be qualifications, promotions, interest on the job and how hard one works. Some outcomes can be pay, fringe benefits, and power status. The individual will mainly expect an equitable input-outcome ratio. Inequity happens when the individual apperceives an unbalanced ratio of their outcomes and other's outcomes. This can occur in a direct exchange of the two parties, or there can be a third party involved. An individual's point of view of equity or inequity can differ depending on the individual.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Aging ==\nThe basis of social exchange theory is to explain social change and stability as a process of negotiating exchanges between parties. These changes can occur over a person's life course through the various relationships, opportunities, and means of support. An example of this is the convoy model of support, this model uses concentric circles to describe relationships around an individual with the strongest relationships in the closet circle. As a person ages, these relationships form a convoy that moves along with the person and exchanges in support and assistance through different circumstances that occur.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Antonucci|first=T.

Within this model, there are different types of support ([[Social support]]) a person can receive, those being intangible, tangible, instrumental, and informational. Intangible support can either be social or emotional and can be love, friendship and appreciation that comes with valuable relationships. Tangible support are physical gifts given to someone such as land, gifts, money, transportation, food, and completing chores. Instrumental support are services given to someone in a relationship. Finally, informational support is the delivering of information that is helpful to an individual.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.med.upenn.edu/hbhe4/part3-ch9-key-constructs-social-support.shtml|title=Health Behavior and Health Education {{!}} Part Three, Chapter Nine: Key Constructs Social Support|website=www.med.upenn.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref>\n\n==Theoretical propositions==\n\nIvan Nye came up with twelve theoretical propositions that aid in understanding the exchange theory.<ref name=\"McDonell, J 2006\"/>\n\n# Individuals choose those alternatives from which they expect the most profit.\n# Cost being equal, they choose alternatives from which they anticipate the greatest rewards.\n# Rewards being equal, they choose alternatives from which they anticipate the fewest costs.\n# Immediate outcomes being equal, they choose those alternatives that promise better long-  term outcomes.\n# Long-term outcomes being perceived as equal, they choose alternatives providing better immediate outcomes.\n# Costs and other rewards being equal, individuals choose the alternatives that supply or can be expected to supply the most social approval (or those that promise the least social disapproval).\n# Costs and other rewards being equal, individuals choose statuses and relationships that provide the most autonomy.\n# Other rewards and costs equal, individuals choose alternatives characterized by the least ambiguity in terms of expected future events and outcomes.\n# Other costs and rewards equal, they choose alternatives that offer the most security for them.\n# Other rewards and costs equal, they choose to associate with, marry, and form other relationships with those whose values and opinions generally are in agreement with their own and reject or avoid those with whom they chronically disagree.\n# Other rewards and costs equal, they are more likely to associate with, marry, and form other relationships with their equals, than those above or below them. (Equality here is viewed as the sum of abilities, performances, characteristics, and statuses that determine one's desirability in the social marketplace.)\n# In industrial societies, other costs and rewards equal, individuals choose alternatives that promise the greatest financial gains for the least financial expenditures.\n\nIn his article published in 1978, Nye originally proposed seven propositions that were common in all types of relationship, A few years later he would expand the propositions to a total of twelve. The first five propositions listed are classified as general propositions and are substance free-meaning, the propositions themselves can stand alone within the theory. Proposition number six has been identified by scholars as a notion that there is a general assumption of a need for social approval as a reward and can therefore act as a drive force behind actions. Proposition seven will only work if the individual has the freedom to be excluded from outside factors while in a social exchange relationship. The twelfth and final proposition is directed towards the way our society has a heightened value placed on monetary funds.<ref>Nye, F. I. (1978). Is Choice and Exchange Theory the Key?. ''Journal Of Marriage & Family'', ''40''(2), 219-232.</ref>\n\n===Homans===\nEven though Homans took an [[individualistic]] approach, a major goal of his work was to explicate the micro-foundations of social structures and social exchange.  By studying such forms of behavior he hoped to illuminate the informal sub-institutional bases of more complex social behavior, typically more formal and often institutionalized.<ref name=Cook/> According to Homans, [[social structures]] emerge from elementary forms of behavior. His vision of the underpinnings of social structure and institutional forms is linked to the actions of individuals, for example to their responses to rewarding and punishment circumstances.<ref>{{cite journal |jstor=2083448 |doi=10.1146/annurev.so.18.080192.000545|title=Two Approaches to Social Structure: Exchange Theory and Network Analysis|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=18|pages=109\u2013127|year=1992|last1=Cook|first1=K. S.|last2=Whitmeyer|first2=J. M.}}</ref>\n\nHomans developed five key propositions that assist in structuring individuals' behaviors based on rewards and costs. This set of theoretical ideas represents the core of Homans's version of social exchange theory.<ref name=Cook/>\n*The first proposition: the Success Proposition states that behavior that creates positive outcomes is likely to be repeated.\n* The second proposition: the Stimulus Proposition believes that if an individual's behavior is rewarded in the past, the individual will continue the previous behavior.\n*The third proposition: the Value proposition believes that if the result of a behavioral action is considered valuable to the individual, it is more likely for that behavior to occur.\n*The fourth proposition: the Deprivation-satiation proposition believes that if an individual has received the same reward several times, the value of that reward will diminish.\n*The fifth proposition discusses when emotions occur due to different reward situations. Those who receive more than they expect or do not receive anticipated punishment will be happy and will behave approvingly.<ref name=Cook/>\n\n=== Frazer ===\nBased on economics, Frazer's theory about social exchange emphasizes the importance of power and status differentiations in social exchange. Frazer's theory had a particular interest in the cross-cousin marriage.\n\n=== Malinowski ===\nWith his Kula exchange, Malinowski drew a sharp differentiation between economic exchange and social exchange. Using his Kula exchange, Malinowski states that the motives of exchange can be mainly social and psychological.\n\n=== Mauss ===\nMauss's theory tries to identify the role played by morality and religion in the social exchange. Mauss argues the exchange found in the society is influenced by social behaviors, while morality and religion influence all aspects of life.\n\n=== Bohannan ===\nBohannan focuses his theory on economic problems such as multicentrism, and modes of exchange. He contributed to the social exchange theory finding the role and function of markets in tribal subsistence economies, makes a distinction of economic redistribution and market exchange from social relationships.\n\n=== Polanyi ===\nHe proposes three principles to create a new idea for socioeconomic change, transforming traditional economies, and political economic development. These principles are: reciprocity, redistribution and marketing.\n\n=== Sahlins ===\nHe presents the idea that the economy is a category of behavior instead of just a simple category of culture.\n\n==Assumptions==\nSocial exchange theory is not one theory but a frame of reference within which many theories can speak to another, whether in argument or mutual support.<ref name=Emerson/> All these theories are built upon several assumptions about human nature and the nature of relationships. Thibaut and Kelley have based their theory on two conceptualizations: one that focuses on the nature of individuals and one that describes the relationships between two people. Thus, the assumptions they make also fall into these categories.\nThe assumptions that social exchange theory makes about human nature include the following:<ref name=\"West 2007 188\">{{cite book\n | last=West | first=Richard\n | last2=Turner | first2=Lynn\n | year=2007\n | title=Introducing Communication Theory\n | page=188\n | publisher=McGraw Hill}}</ref>\n\n*Humans seek rewards and avoid punishments.\n*Humans are rational beings.\n*The standards that humans use to evaluate costs and rewards vary over time and from person to person.\n\nThe assumptions social exchange theory makes about the nature of relationships include the following:<ref name=\"West 2007 188\"/>\n\n*Relationships are interdependent.\n*Relational life is a process.\n\nThe [[prisoner's dilemma]] is a widely used example in game theory that attempts to illustrate why or how two individuals may not cooperate with each other, even if it is in their best interest to do so. It demonstrates that while cooperation would give the best outcome, people might nevertheless act selfishly.<ref>{{cite book\n | last=Thibaut | first=N.\n | last2=Kelley | first2=H.\n | year=1959\n | title= The social psychology of groups\n | url=https://archive.org/details/socialpsychology00thib | publisher=New York Wiley}}{{page needed|date=October 2014}}</ref>\nAll relationships involve exchanges although the balance of this exchange is not always equal. We cannot achieve our goals alone so as humans sometimes we have to become actors. In the world today we see actors as unemotional people but that is not the case once we reach our goals in the end.\n\n==Comparison levels==\nSocial exchange includes \"both a notion of a relationship, and some notion of a shared obligation in which both parties perceive responsibilities to each other\".<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0149206307307635|title=Taking a Multifoci Approach to the Study of Justice, Social Exchange, and Citizenship Behavior: The Target Similarity Model |journal=Journal of Management|volume=33|issue=6|pages=841\u2013866|year=2007|last1=Lavelle|first1=J. J.|last2=Rupp|first2=D. E.|last3=Brockner|first3=J.}}</ref> [[John Thibaut]] and [[Harold Kelley]] proposed two comparison standards to differentiate between relationship satisfaction and relationship stability. This evaluation rests on two types of comparisons: '''Comparison Level''' and '''Comparison Level for Alternative'''. According to Thibaut and Kelley, the Comparison Level (CL) is a standard representing what people feel they should receive in the way of rewards and costs from a particular relationship. An individual's comparison level can be considered the standard by which an outcome seems to satisfy the individual.<ref name=\"Griffin\">{{cite book |editor1-last=Griffin |editor1-first=Em |title=A First Look at Communication Theory |first1=John |last1=Thibaut |first2=Harold |last2=Kelley |chapter=Social Exchange Theory |pages=196\u2013205 |chapterurl=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0073385026/228359/socialexchange.pdf |publisher=McGraw Hill |isbn=978-0-07-338502-0 |year=2008}}</ref>  The Comparison Level for Alternative (CLalt) refers to \"the lowest level of relational rewards a person is willing to accept given available rewards from alternative relationships or being alone\".<ref>{{cite book\n | last=Roloff| first=Michael\n | year=1981\n | title=Interpersonal communication: The social exchange approach\n | page=48\n | publisher=Beverly Hills}}</ref> In other words, when using this evaluation tool, an individual will consider other alternative payoffs or rewards outside of the current relationship or exchange.<ref name=\"Griffin\"/> CLalt provides a measure of stability rather than satisfaction. If people see no alternative and fear being alone more than being in the relationship, social exchange theory predicts they will stay.<ref>{{cite book | last=West | first=Richard | last2=Turner | first2=Lynn | year=2007 | title=Introducing Communication Theory | page=191 | publisher=McGraw Hill}}</ref>\n\n==Modes of exchange==\nAccording to Kelley and Thibaut, people engage in Behavioral Sequence, or a series of actions designed to achieve their goal. This is congruent with their assumption that human beings are [[rational]].<ref name=\"West 2007 193\">{{cite book\n | last=West | first=Richard\n | last2=Turner | first2=Lynn\n | year=2007\n | title=Introducing Communication Theory\n | page=193\n | publisher=McGraw Hill}}</ref> When people engage in these behavioral sequences, they are dependent to some extent on their relational partner. In order for behavioral sequences to lead to social exchange, two conditions must be achieved: \"It must be oriented towards ends that can only be achieved through interaction with other persons, and it must seek to adapt means to further the achievement of these ends\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Blau|first=Peter M.|title=Exchange & Power in Social Life|year=1964|publisher=Transaction| isbn = 9780887386282}}</ref> The concept of reciprocity also derives from this pattern. The reciprocity principle refers to the mutual reinforcement by two parties of each other's actions.<ref>Ekeh, Peter P.. Social exchange theory: the two traditions. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1974.{{page needed|date=October 2014}}</ref> The process begins when at least one participant makes a \"move\", and if the other reciprocates, new rounds of exchange initiate. Once the process is in motion, each consequence can create a self-reinforcing cycle. Even though the norm of reciprocity may be a universally accepted principle, the degree to which people and cultures apply this concept varies.<ref name=Zafirovski />\n\n===Power dependence relations===\nSeveral definitions of power have been offered by exchange theorists. For instance, some theorists view power as distinct from exchanges, some view it as a kind of exchange and others believe power is a medium of exchange.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Baldwin|first=David|title=Power and Social Exchange|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=72|issue=4|pages=1229\u20131242|jstor=1954536|doi=10.2307/1954536|year=1978}}</ref> However, the most useful definition of power is that proposed by Emerson,<ref name=\"Befu1977\">{{cite journal |last=Befu |first=H. |year=1977 |title=Social Exchange |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |volume=6 |issue= |pages=255\u201381 |jstor=2949333 |doi=10.1146/annurev.an.06.100177.001351}}</ref> who developed a theory of power-dependence relations.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Auld |first=C. |last2=Case |first2=A. |title=Social exchange processes in leisure and non-leisure settings: A review and exploratory investigation |journal=Journal of Leisure Research |year=1997 |volume=29 |issue=2 |page=183 |doi= 10.1080/00222216.1997.11949793|url=http://js.sagamorepub.com/jlr/article/view/810 }}</ref> According to this theory, the dependence a person has on another brings up the concept of power.<ref name=\"West 2007 188\" /> Power differentiation affects social structures by causing inequalities between members of different groups, such as an individual having superiority over another.<ref name=Zafirovski>{{cite journal |last=Zafirovski |first=Milan |title=Social Exchange Theory Under Scrutiny: A Positive Critique of its Economic-Behaviorist Formulations |journal=Electronic Journal of Sociology |year=2005 |url=http://www.sociology.org/content/2005/tier2/SETheory.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924103311/http://www.sociology.org/content/2005/tier2/SETheory.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 }}</ref> Power within the theory is governed by two variables : the structure of power in exchange networks and strategic use.<ref name=\"Zafirovski\" /> Experimental data show that the position an actor occupies in a social exchange network determines relative dependence and therefore power.<ref>(Stolte and Emerson, 1976)</ref>\n\nAccording to Thibaut and Kelley, there are two types of power: fate control and behavior control. Fate control is the ability to affect a partner's outcomes.<ref name=\"West 2007 188\"/> Behavior control is the power to cause another's behavior to change by changing one's own behavior.<ref name=\"West 2007 188\"/>\n\n===Matrices===\nPeople develop patterns of exchange to cope with power differentials and to deal with the costs associated with exercising power.<ref name=\"West 2007 188\"/> These patterns describe behavioral rules or norms that indicate how people trade resources in an attempt to maximize rewards and minimize costs. Three different matrices have been described by Thibaut and Kelley to illustrate the patterns people develop. These are given matrix, the effective matrix and the dispositional matrix.<ref>{{cite book\n | last=West | first=Richard\n | last2=Turner | first2=Lynn\n | year=2007\n | title=Introducing Communication Theory\n | page=194\n | publisher=McGraw Hill}}</ref>\n\n*The given matrix represents the behavioral choices and outcomes that are determined by a combination of external factors (environment) and internal factors (the specific skills each interactant possesses).<ref name=\"West 2007 193\"/>\n*The effective matrix \"which represents an expansion of alternative behaviors and/or outcomes which ultimately determines the behavioral choices in social exchange\"<ref>{{cite book\n | last=Roloff| first=Michael\n | year=1981\n | title=Interpersonal communication: The social exchange approach\n | page=51\n | publisher=Beverly Hills}}</ref>\n*The dispositional matrix represents the way two people believe that rewards ought to be exchanged between them.<ref>{{cite book\n | last=West | first=Richard\n | last2=Turner | first2=Lynn\n | year=2007\n | title=Introducing Communication Theory\n | page=195\n | publisher=McGraw Hill}}</ref>\n\nThere are three forms within these matrices: [[Norm of reciprocity|Reciprocity]], Generalized Exchange, and Productive Exchange. In a direct exchange, reciprocation is confined to the two actors. One social actor provides value to another one and the other reciprocates. There are three different types of reciprocity:<ref name = Cropanzano>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0149206305279602|title=Social Exchange Theory: An Interdisciplinary Review|journal=Journal of Management|volume=31|issue=6|pages=874\u2013900|year=2005|last1=Cropanzano|first1=R.|last2=Mitchell|first2=M. S.}}</ref>\n#Reciprocity as a transactional pattern of interdependent exchanges\n#Reciprocity as a folk belief\n#Reciprocity as a moral norm\n\nA generalized exchange involves indirect reciprocity between three or more individuals.<ref name=\"Trust and Transitions\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0190272509359616|year=2010|title=The Contentious Social Interactionism of Charles Tilly|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|volume=73|pages=5\u201310|last1=Collins|first1=R.}}</ref> For example, one person gives to another and the recipient responds by giving to another person other than the first person. Productive exchange means that both actors have to contribute for either one of them to benefit. Both people incur benefits and costs simultaneously.\n\nAnother common form of exchange is negotiated exchange which focuses on the negotiation of rules in order for both parties to reach a beneficial agreement.<ref name=Cropanzano /> Reciprocal exchanges and negotiated exchanges are often analyzed and compared to discover their essential differences. One major difference between the two exchanges is the level of risks associated with the exchange and the uncertainty these risks create (ref). Negotiated exchange can consist of binding and non-binding negotiations. When comparing the levels of risk within these exchanges, reciprocal exchange has the highest level of risk which in result produces the most uncertainty.<ref name=\"Trust and Transitions\"/> An example of a risk that could occur during the reciprocal exchange is the factor that the second party could end up not returning the favor and completing the reciprocal exchange. Binding negotiated exchanges involve the least amount of risks which will result the individuals feeling low levels of uncertainty. Whereas non-binding negotiated exchanges and their level of risks and uncertainty fall in between the amount of risks associated with reciprocal and binding negotiated exchanges.<ref name=\"Trust and Transitions\"/> Since there is not a binding agreement involved, one party involved in the exchange could decide to not cooperate with the agreement.\n\n==Critiques==\n\nKatherine Miller outlines several major objections to or problems with the social exchange theory as developed from early seminal works<ref>{{cite book\n | last=Katherine| first=Miller\n | year=2005\n | title=Communication Theories\n | publisher=McGraw Hill\n | location= New York }}{{page needed|date=October 2014}}</ref>\n*The theory reduces human interaction to a purely rational process that arises from economic theory.\n*The theory favors openness as it was developed in the 1970s when ideas of freedom and openness were preferred, but there may be times when openness isn't the best option in a relationship.\n*The theory assumes that the ultimate goal of a relationship is intimacy when this might not always be the case.\n*The theory places relationships in a linear structure, when some relationships might skip steps or go backwards in terms of intimacy.\n\nRussell Cropanzano and Marie S. Mitchell discuss how one of the major issues within the social exchange theory is the lack of information within studies on the various exchange rules.<ref name = Cropanzano/> Reciprocity is a major exchange rule discussed but, Cropanzano and Mitchell write that the theory would be better understood if more research programs discussed a variety of exchange rules such as [[altruism]], group gain, status consistency and competition.<ref name = Cropanzano/> Meeker points out that within the exchange process, each unit takes into account at least the following elements: reciprocity, rationality, altruism (social responsibility), group gain, status, consistency, and competition (rivalry).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Walczak | first1 = D | year = 2015 | title = The process of exchange, solidarity and sustainable development in building a community of responsibility | url = | journal = Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences | volume = 6 | issue = 1S1 | page = 507 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Meeker | first1 = B.

Specifically, Rosenfeld looked at the limitations of interracial couples and the application of social exchange theory. His analysis suggest that in modern society, there is less of a gap between interracial partners education level, socioeconomic status, and social class level which in turn, makes the previously understood application of social exchange moot.<ref>Rosenfeld, M. J. (2005). A Critique of Exchange Theory in Mate Selection. ''American Journal Of Sociology'', ''110''(5), 1284-1325. doi:10.1086/428441</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2010}}\n\nThe most extensive application of social exchange has been in the area of interpersonal relationships.<ref name=\"georgetown2005\"/> However, social exchange theory materializes in many different situations with the same idea of the exchange of resources.  Self-Interest can encourage individuals to make decisions that will benefit themselves overall. Homans once summarized the theory by stating:\n\n:Social behavior is an exchange of goods, material goods but also non-material ones, such as the symbols of approval or prestige. Persons that give much to others try to get much from them, and persons that get much from others are under pressure to give much to them. This process of influence tends to work out at equilibrium to a balance in the exchanges. For a person in an exchange, what he gives may be a cost to him, just as what he gets may be a reward, and his behavior changes less as the difference of the two, profit, tends to a maximum (\"Theories Used in Research\").\n\n===Anthropology===\nOther applications that developed the idea of exchange include field of [[anthropology]] as evidenced in an article by Harumi Befu, which discusses cultural ideas and [[social norm|norms]].  L\u00e9vi-Strauss is considered as one of the major contributors to the anthropology of exchange. Within this field, self-interest, human sentiment and motivational process are not considered.<ref name=\"Befu1977\" /> L\u00e9vi\u2013Strauss uses a [[collectivist]] approach to explain exchanges. To L\u00e9vi-Strauss, a social exchange is defined as a regulated form of behavior in the context of societal rules and norms.  This contrasts with psychological studies of exchange in which behaviors are studied ignoring the culture. Social exchanges from the anthropological perspective have been analyzed using the gift-giving phenomena. The concept of reciprocity under this perspective states that individuals can directly reward his benefactor or another person in the social exchange process.<ref>{{cite journal |jstor=256704 |doi=10.2307/256704|pmid=10134637|title=Citizenship Behavior and Social Exchange|journal=Academy of Management Journal|volume=37|issue=3|pages=656\u201369|year=1994|last1=Konovsky|first1=M. A.|last2=Pugh|first2=S. D.}}</ref> L\u00e9vi-Strauss developed the theory of cousin marriage based on the pervasiveness of gift-giving in primitive societies. The basis of this theory is the distinction between restricted exchanges, which is only capable of connecting pairs of social groups, and generalize exchange, which integrates indefinite numbers of groups.<ref name=\"Befu1977\" />\n\n===Relationships===\nThroughout the theory, one can also end up losing relationships that were already established because the feeling of no longer being beneficial. One feels as if there is not longer a need for a relationship or communication due to lack of rewards. Once this happens, the process of looking for new partners and resources occurs. This allows a continuation of networking. One may go through this process quite frequently. A study applied this theory to new media (online dating). The study discovers the different factors involved when an individual decides to establish an online relationship.<ref name=\"online dating\">{{cite journal |doi=10.5964/ijpr.v3isupp2.74|title=Factors Related to Initiating Interpersonal Contacts on Internet Dating Sites: A View from the Social Exchange Theory|journal=Interpersona: An International Journal on Personal Relationships|volume=3|pages=19\u201337|year=2009|last1=Shtatfeld|first1=Rivka|last2=Barak|first2=Azy|doi-access=free}}</ref> Overall the study followed the social exchange theory's idea, \"people are attracted to those who grant them rewards\".<ref name=\"online dating\"/>\n\nAnother example is Berg's study about development of friendship between roommates. The research found how social exchange processes changed during the year by measuring [[Self-disclosure|self disclosure]]. According to the study, the amount one person rewards another and the comparison levels for alternatives become the most important factors in determining liking and satisfaction.<ref name=\"Auld, C.

They use the concept of reciprocity to understand their findings. The study concluded that meeting new people is often given as a major reason for participation in leisure activities, and meeting new people may be conceptualized as an exercise of reciprocity. In this case, reciprocity is perceived as a starting mechanism for new social relationships because people are willing to be helped by others, expecting that the help will eventually be returned.<ref name=\"Auld, C. J. 1997\"/> A study conducted by Paul, G., called Exchange and access in field work tries to understand the relationships between the researchers and subjects. This study concludes that [[Bargaining]] helps to satisfy the more specific needs of the parties because greater risks are taken to obtain more information.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gray |first1=Paul S. |year=1980 |title=Exchange and Access in Field Work |journal=Journal of Contemporary Ethnography |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=309\u2013331 |doi=10.1177/089124168000900303}}</ref> This study also introduces the concept of [[trust (social sciences)]] to determine the duration of relationships.\n\n===Interracial marriage===\nPatterns of [[interracial marriage]] have been explained using social exchange theory. Kalmijn <ref name=\"Kalmijn\">{{cite journal |jstor=2580162 |doi=10.1093/sf/72.1.119|title=Trends in Black/White Intermarriage|journal=Social Forces|volume=72|issue=1|pages=119\u2013146|year=1993|last1=Kalmijn|first1=M.}}</ref> suggests that ethnic status is offset against educational or financial resources. This process has been used to explain why there are more marriages between black men and white women than between white men and black women. This asymmetry in marriage patterns has been used to support the idea of a racial hierarchy. Lewis,<ref name=\"Lewis\">{{cite journal |pmid=22347504 |pmc=3276508|bibcode=2012PLoSO...731703L|title=A Facial Attractiveness Account of Gender Asymmetries in Interracial Marriage|journal=PLOS One|volume=7|issue=2|pages=31703|last1=Lewis|first1=Michael B.|year=2012|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0031703}}</ref> however, explains that the same patterns of marriage can be accounted for in terms of simple facial attractiveness patterns of the different gender by race groupings. Recent changes have seen an increase in black women marrying white men and a decrease in raw prevalence of interracial marriages when it comes to black women. There has also been a shift in the concentration of interracial marriage from mostly being between those with low education levels to those with higher levels of education.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fryer|first=Roland G|date=Spring 2007|title=Guess Who's Been Coming to Dinner?

It has contributed to the study of organization-stakeholder relationships and [[relationship marketing]]. The investment model proposed by [[Caryl Rusbult]] is a useful version of social exchange theory. According to this model, investments serve to stabilize relationships. The greater the nontransferable investments a person has in a given relationship, the more stable the relationship is likely to be. The same investment concept is applied in relationship marketing. Databases are the major instrument to build differentiated relationships between organizations and customers. Through the information process, companies identify the customer's own individual needs. From this perspective, a client becomes an investment. If a customer decides to choose another competitor, the investment will be lost.<ref name=\"georgetown2005\"/> When people find they have invested too much to quit a relationship or enterprise, they pour additional resources into the relationship to salvage their initial investment. Exchange has been a central research thrust in business-to-business relational exchange.<ref name=\"Lambe, C. Jay 2001\"/> According to the study conducted by Lambe, C. Jay, C. Michael Wittmann, and Robert E. Spekman firms evaluate economic and social outcomes from each transaction and compare them to what they feel they deserve. Firms also look for additional benefits provided by other potential exchange partners. The initial transaction between companies is crucial to determine if their relationship will expand, remain the same or will dissolve.<ref name=\"Lambe, C. Jay 2001\"/>\n\n===Work settings===\nA study conducted by A. Saks serves as an example to explain engagement of employees in organizations. This study uses one of the tenets of social exchange theory to explain that obligations are generated through a series of interactions between parties who are in a state of reciprocal interdependence. The research identified that when individuals receive economic and socioemotional resources from their organization, they feel obliged to respond in kind and repay the organization. This is a description of engagement as a two-way relationship between the employer and employee. One way for individuals to repay their organization is through their level of engagement. The more engaged the employee are to their work, the greater amounts of cognitive, emotional, and physical resources they will devote to perform their job duties. When the organization fails to provide economic or emotional resources, the employees are more likely to withdraw and disengage themselves from their roles.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Antecedents and consequences of employee engagement|last = Saks|first = A.M.|date = 2006|journal = Journal of Managerial Psychology  |volume=21 |issue=7 |pages=600\u201319 |doi=10.1108/02683940610690169}}</ref>\n\n===Citizenship behavior===\nSocial exchange theory is a theoretical explanation for [[organizational citizenship behavior]]. This study examines a model of clear leadership and relational building between head and teachers as antecedents, and organizational citizenship behavior as a consequence of teacher\u2013school exchange.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/13603124.2010.524250|title=Social exchange theory as an explanation of organizational citizenship behaviour among teachers|journal=International Journal of Leadership in Education|volume=14|issue=4|pages=405\u2013421|year=2011|last1=Elstad|first1=Eyvind|last2=Christophersen|first2=Knut Andreas|last3=Turmo|first3=Are}}</ref> Citizenship behavior can also be shown with employees and their employers.This is shown through organizational identification which plays an important role in organizational citizenship behavior.

Formalized by Lawler (2001), the affect theory examines the structural conditions of exchange that produce emotions and feelings and then identifies how individuals attribute these emotions to different social units (exchange partners, groups, or networks).<ref name=\"Lawler\">{{cite journal |jstor=10.1086/324071 |doi=10.1086/324071|title=An Affect Theory of Social Exchange|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=107|issue=2|pages=321\u2013352|year=2001|last1=Lawler|first1=Edward J.|url=https://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1661&context=articles}}</ref> These attributions of emotion, in turn, dictate how strongly individuals feel attached to their partners or groups, which drives collectively oriented behavior and commitment to the relationship.\n\n===Assumptions===\n\nMost social exchange models have three basic assumptions in common: behavior in a social sense is based on exchanges, if an individual allows someone to receives a reward the person then feels the need to reciprocate due to social pressure and individuals will try to minimize their cost while gaining the most from the reward.<ref>Sprecher, S., (1998). Social exchange theories and sexuality. Journal of Sex Research, 35(1), 32\u201343.</ref> The affect theory of social exchange is based on assumptions that stem from social exchange theory and [[affect theory]]:\n\n*There are three or more individuals who have the opportunity to make exchanges with one another. These actors are able to make decisions about whether to exchange, with whom to exchange, and under what terms to execute an exchange.\n*Social exchange produces emotions that are positive to negative\n*Emotions can be construed as reward or punishment (i.e. feeling good has a positive value and feeling bad has a negative value).\n*Individuals try to avoid negative emotions and to reproduce positive emotions in social exchange.\n*Individuals will try to understand the source or cause of feelings produced by social exchange. In this way, emotions become attributed to the object that caused them.\n*Individuals interpret and exchange their feelings with respect to social relationships (e.g. partners, groups, networks). Positive emotions produced by exchange will increase solidarity in these relationships, while negative emotions will decrease solidarity.\n\n===Theoretical propositions===\n\nAffect theory of social exchange shows how the conditions of exchanges promote interpersonal and group relationships through emotions and affective processes. The theoretical arguments center on the following five claims:\n\n'''Emotions produced by exchange are involuntary, internal responses'''\n\nIndividuals experience emotions (general feelings of pleasantness or unpleasantness) depending on whether their exchange is successful.  These emotions are construed as a reward (or punishment) and individuals strive to repeat actions that reproduce positive emotions or avoid negative emotions.\n\n'''Individuals attempt to understand what in a social exchange situation produces emotions'''\n\nIndividuals will use the exchange task to understand the source (partners, groups, or networks) of their emotions. Individuals are more likely to attribute their emotions to their exchange partners or groups when the task can only be completed with one or more partners, when the task requires interdependent (nonseparable) contributions, and when there is a shared sense of responsibility for the success or failure of the exchange.\n\n'''The mode of exchange determines the features of the exchange task and influences the attribution of the emotion produced'''\n\nThe [[Social exchange theory#Comparison levels|mode of exchange]] (productive, negotiated, reciprocal, or generalized) provides a description of the exchange task. The task features are defined by the degree of interdependence (separability of tasks) and shared responsibility between partners to complete the task. These features influence the strength of the emotion felt. Productive exchanges are interdependent and this high degree of nonseparability generates the strongest emotions. Reciprocal exchanges are separable which reduces the perceptions of shared responsibility. The exchange produces little emotional response, but individuals instead express emotions in response to the asymmetrical transaction. Generalized exchanges do not occur directly, but interdependence is still high and coordination between partners is difficult. Because there is no direct emotional foundation, emotions produced are low. Negotiated exchanges may produce conflicting emotions due to the mixed-motive nature of negotiations; even when transactions are successful, individuals may feel like they had the ability to do better, creating emotional ambivalence. Overall, productive exchanges produce the strongest attributions of emotions, generalized (indirect) exchange the weakest, with negotiated and reciprocal exchanges in between.\n\n'''The attribution of emotions resulting from different exchange modes impact the solidarity felt with partners or groups'''\n\nThe different types of exchange (productive, reciprocal, and generalized) also impact the solidarity or identification that an individual will feel with their exchange partners or group. The different exchange types help dictate the target of felt emotions and influences an individual's attachment. Affective attachment occurs when a social unit (partner or group) is the target of positive feelings from exchange; affective detachment (alienation) occurs when a social unit is the target of negative feelings from failure to exchange.<ref name=\"Lawler\" /> Affective attachment increases solidarity. Similar to the attribution of emotion, productive exchange produces the strongest affective attachments, generalized exchange the weakest, and negotiated and reciprocal exchange are in between.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nOne condition for how social (partner or group) attributions can increase solidarity is by reducing self-serving attributions of credit or blame for the success or failure of the exchange. When individuals have group attributions for positive emotions stemming from success, this eliminates any [[self-serving bias]]es and enhances both pride in the self and gratitude to the partner. However, group attributions for negative emotions stemming from failure do not eliminate self-serving biases, resulting in more anger toward the partner or group than shame in the self.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nLawler also proposes that the persistence (stability) and ability to control acts by the exchange partner (controllability) provide conditions for affective attachment by attributing credit or blame for the success or failure of the exchange.<ref name=\"Lawler\" /> Following Weiner (1985)<ref name=\"Weiner\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.92.4.548|pmid=3903815|title=An attributional theory of achievement motivation and emotion|journal=Psychological Review|volume=92|issue=4|pages=548\u201373|year=1985|last1=Weiner|first1=Bernard}}</ref> affect theory of social exchange extrapolates that the combinations of stability and uncontrollability elicit different emotions. In social exchange, social connections can be sources of stability and controllability. For example, if an exchange partner is perceived as a stable source of positive feelings, and the exchange partner has control in the acts that elicit those positive feelings, this will strengthen affective attachment. Therefore, affect theory of social exchange proposes that stable and controllable sources of positive feelings (i.e. pleasantness, pride, gratitude) will elicit affective attachments while stable and uncontrollable sources of negative feelings (i.e. unpleasantness, shame, anger) will elicit affective detachment.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n'''Through these emotional processes, networks can develop group properties'''\n\nRepeated exchanges allow a network to evolve into a group. Affect theory highlights the contributions of emotions in producing group properties. Successful interactions generate positive feelings for the involved individuals, which motivates them to interact with the same partners in the future. As exchanges repeat, the strong relationships become visible to other parties, making salient their role as a group and helping to generate a group identity that continues to bind the partners together in a network. Affect theory predicts that networks of negotiated and reciprocal exchange will tend to promote stronger relational ties within partners; productive or generalized exchange will promote stronger network or group-level ties.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Complexity science]]\n* [[Equity theory]]\n* [[Institutional]]\n* [[Interdependence]]\n* [[Open innovation]]\n* [[Predicted outcome value theory]]\n* [[Rational agent]]\n* [[Social action]]\n* [[Social good]]\n* [[Social interaction]]\n* [[Social networks]]\n* [[Value conversion]]\n* [[Value (economics)]]\n* [[Value network]]\n* [[Value network analysis]]\n* [[Vulnerability and care theory of love]]\n}}<ref>Stolte, John F. and Emerson, Richard M.

They used the reward-cost matrices from the [[Game theory|Game Theory]] and discovered some clues of individuals\u2019 interdependence such as the power of a party over each other. Also known as the \u201ccorrespondence\u201d versus \u201cnoncorrespondence\u201d of outcomes. Additionally, they suggest that an individual can unilaterally affect her or his own outcomes in a relationship through chosen behaviors. They could predict the possible course of a social interaction through the analysis of aspects of power in an encounter. They also experimented on how the outcomes received in a relationship could define a person's attractions to relationships. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Homans ====\nHomans based his theory on concepts of equilibration, expectancy and distribute justice in dyadic exchange. With this, he tries to explain the social interaction in small groups and the rewards received proportional to their costs and investments. Homans summarizes the system in three propositions: success, stimulus, and deprivation\u2013satiation proposition<ref name=Emerson />, described below.\n\n#Success proposition: When one finds they are rewarded for their actions, they tend to repeat the action.\n#Stimulus proposition: The more often a particular stimulus has resulted in a reward in the past, the more likely it is that a person will respond to it.\n#Deprivation\u2013satiation proposition: The more often in the recent past a person has received a particular reward, the less valuable any further unit of that reward becomes.\n\n==== Blau ====\nBlau's theory is very similar to Homans\u2019. However, he uses more economics terms and it is based principally on emergent social structure in social exchange patterns in small groups.<ref name=\":0\" /> His theory analyzes the development of exchange theory in economics without emphasizing on the psychological assumptions. He contributed to the idea of distinguishing between social and economic exchanges and exchange and power. The goal of his theory was to identify complex and simple processes without ignoring emergent properties.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/routsocial/social_exchange_theory/0|title=Reader's Guide to the Social Sciences|last=Michie|first=Jonathan|date=2001|access-date=2018-12-08}}</ref>. Blau's utilitarian focus encouraged the theorist to look forward, as in what they anticipated the reward would be in regards to their next social interaction.<ref name = Cook /> Blau felt that if individuals focused too much on the psychological concepts within the theory, they would refrain from learning the developing aspects of social exchange.<ref name=Emerson /> Blau emphasized technical economic analysis whereas Homans concentrated more on the psychology of instrumental behavior.<ref name=Emerson/>\n\n==== Emerson ====\nEmerson was inspired by Homans and Blau's ideas. He focused on the interaction and relationship between individuals and parties. His view of social exchange theory emphasizes the resource availability, power, and dependence as primary dynamics.\u00a0 He thought that relations were organized in different manners, and they could differ depending on the type and amour of the resources exchanged. He poses the idea that power and dependence are the main aspects that define a relationship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/worldsocs/emerson_richard_marc_1982/0|title=World of Sociology, Gale|last=Palmisano|first=Joseph M.|date=2002|access-date=2018-12-08}}</ref>.

Web. 2 Nov. 2013. <http://www.credoreference.com/entry/sagepr/social_exchange_theory>.</ref> According to Stafford, social exchanges involve a connection with another person; involve trust and not legal obligations; are more flexible; and rarely involve explicit bargaining.<ref>{{cite book\n | last=Stafford | first=Laura\n | year=2008\n | chapter=Social Exchange Theories |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWLXu63TQWQC&pg=PA377 |editor1-first=Leslie A. |editor1-last=Baxter |editor2-first=Dawn O. |editor2-last=Braithwaite |title=Engaging theories in interpersonal communication:Multiple perspectives |pages=377\u201389\n | publisher=Thousand Oaks}}</ref>\n\n===Cost and rewards===\nSimple social exchange models assume that rewards and costs drive relationship decisions.<ref name=\"georgetown2005\"/> Both parties in a social exchange take responsibility for one another and depend on each other. The elements of relational life include:\n\n'''Costs''' are the elements of relational life that have negative value to a person, such as the effort put into a relationship and the negatives of a partner.<ref>{{cite book\n | last=West | first=Richard\n | last2=Turner | first2=Lynn\n | year=2007\n | title=Introducing Communication Theory\n | pages=186\u20137\n | publisher=McGraw Hill}}</ref> (Costs can be time, money, effort etc.)\n\n'''Rewards''' are the elements of a relationship that have positive value. (Rewards can be sense of acceptance, support, and companionship etc.)\n\nAs with everything dealing with the social exchange theory, it has as its outcome satisfaction and dependence of relationships. The social-exchange perspective argues that people calculate the overall worth of a particular relationship by subtracting its costs from the rewards it provides.<ref>{{cite book\n | last=P.R. | first=Monge\n | last2=N. | first2=Contractor\n | year=2003\n | title=Theories of communication networks\n | publisher=Oxford University Press}}{{page needed|date=October 2014}}</ref>\n\n:{{math|Worth {{=}} Rewards \u2212 Costs}}\n\nIf worth is a positive number, it is a positive relationship. On the contrary, a negative number indicates a negative relationship. The worth of a relationship influences its outcome, or whether people will continue with a relationship or terminate it. Positive relationships are expected to endure, whereas negative relationships will probably terminate. In a mutually beneficial exchange, each party supplies the wants of the other party at lower cost to self than the value of the resources the other party provides. In such a model, mutual relationship satisfaction ensures relationship stability.<ref name=\"georgetown2005\"/>\n\n:{{math|Outcome {{=}} Rewards \u2212 Costs}}\nHomans based his theory on [[behaviorism]] to conclude that people pursue rewards to minimize costs.  The \"satisfactory-ness\" of the rewards that a party gains from an exchange relationship is judged relative to some standard, which may vary from party to party.<ref name=\"Lambe, C. Jay 2001\"/>\n\n=== Reciprocity Norm ===\nSummarized by Gouldner, the [[Reciprocity norm (negotiation)|reciprocity norm]] states that a benefit should be returned and the one who gives the benefit should not be harmed. This is used to stabilize relationships and to identify the egoism. This norm suggests the independence in relationships and invite the individual to consider more than one's self-interest. <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/estappliedpsyc/reciprocity_norm/0|title=Encyclopedia of Applied Psychology|last=Spielberger|first=Charles Donald|date=2004|access-date=2018-12-08}}</ref>\n\n=== The Social Penetration Theory ===\n\nI. Altman and D. Taylor's: They introduce the [[social penetration theory]], which states the nature and quality of social exchange and close bonds. It suggests once the individuals start to give more of themselves to one another, relationships progress progressively from exchanging superficial goods to others more meaningful. It progresses to the point called \u201cself-disclosure\u201d, where the individuals share innermost thoughts and feelings with one another. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Equity and inequity ===\nIn this process, the individuals will compare their rewards with others\u2019 in relation to their costs. Equity can be defined as the balance between a person's inputs and outcomes on the job. Some examples of inputs can be qualifications, promotions, interest on the job and how hard one works. Some outcomes can be pay, fringe benefits, and power status. The individual will mainly expect an equitable input-outcome ratio. Inequity happens when the individual apperceives an unbalanced ratio of their outcomes and other's outcomes. This can occur in a direct exchange of the two parties, or there can be a third party involved. An individual's point of view of equity or inequity can differ depending on the individual.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n\n== Aging ==\nThe basis of social exchange theory is to explain social change and stability as a process of negotiating exchanges between parties. These changes can occur over a person's life course through the various relationships, opportunities, and means of support. An example of this is the convoy model of support, this model uses concentric circles to describe relationships around an individual with the strongest relationships in the closet circle. As a person ages, these relationships form a convoy that moves along with the person and exchanges in support and assistance through different circumstances that occur.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Antonucci|first=T.

Within this model, there are different types of support ([[Social support]]) a person can receive, those being intangible, tangible, instrumental, and informational. Intangible support can either be social or emotional and can be love, friendship and appreciation that comes with valuable relationships. Tangible support are physical gifts given to someone such as land, gifts, money, transportation, food, and completing chores. Instrumental support are services given to someone in a relationship. Finally, informational support is the delivering of information that is helpful to an individual. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.med.upenn.edu/hbhe4/part3-ch9-key-constructs-social-support.shtml|title=Health Behavior and Health Education {{!}} Part Three, Chapter Nine: Key Constructs Social Support|website=www.med.upenn.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref>\n\n==Theoretical propositions==\n\nIvan Nye came up with twelve theoretical propositions that aid in understanding the exchange theory.<ref name=\"McDonell, J 2006\"/>\n\n# Individuals choose those alternatives from which they expect the most profit.\n# Cost being equal, they choose alternatives from which they anticipate the greatest rewards.\n# Rewards being equal, they choose alternatives from which they anticipate the fewest costs.\n# Immediate outcomes being equal, they choose those alternatives that promise better long-  term outcomes.\n# Long-term outcomes being perceived as equal, they choose alternatives providing better immediate outcomes.\n# Costs and other rewards being equal, individuals choose the alternatives that supply or can be expected to supply the most social approval (or those that promise the least social disapproval).\n# Costs and other rewards being equal, individuals choose statuses and relationships that provide the most autonomy.\n# Other rewards and costs equal, individuals choose alternatives characterized by the least ambiguity in terms of expected future events and outcomes.\n# Other costs and rewards equal, they choose alternatives that offer the most security for them.\n# Other rewards and costs equal, they choose to associate with, marry, and form other relationships with those whose values and opinions generally are in agreement with their own and reject or avoid those with whom they chronically disagree.\n# Other rewards and costs equal, they are more likely to associate with, marry, and form other relationships with their equals, than those above or below them. (Equality here is viewed as the sum of abilities, performances, characteristics, and statuses that determine one's desirability in the social marketplace.)\n# In industrial societies, other costs and rewards equal, individuals choose alternatives that promise the greatest financial gains for the least financial expenditures.\n\nIn his article published in 1978, Nye originally proposed seven propositions that were common in all types of relationship, A few years later he would expand the propositions to a total of twelve. The first five propositions listed are classified as general propositions and are substance free-meaning, the propositions themselves can stand alone within the theory. Proposition number six has been identified by scholars as a notion that there is a general assumption of a need for social approval as a reward and can therefor act as a drive force behind actions. Proposition seven will only work if the individual has the freedom to be excluded from outside factors while in a social exchange relationship. The twelfth and final proposition is directed towards the way our society has a heightened value placed on monetary funds. <ref>Nye, F. I. (1978). Is Choice and Exchange Theory the Key?. ''Journal Of Marriage & Family'', ''40''(2), 219-232.</ref>\n\n===Homans===\nEven though Homans took an [[individualistic]] approach, a major goal of his work was to explicate the micro-foundations of social structures and social exchange.  By studying such forms of behavior he hoped to illuminate the informal sub-institutional bases of more complex social behavior, typically more formal and often institutionalized.<ref name=Cook/> According to Homans, [[social structures]] emerge from elementary forms of behavior. His vision of the underpinnings of social structure and institutional forms is linked to the actions of individuals, for example to their responses to rewarding and punishment circumstances.<ref>{{cite journal |jstor=2083448 |doi=10.1146/annurev.so.18.080192.000545|title=Two Approaches to Social Structure: Exchange Theory and Network Analysis|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=18|pages=109\u2013127|year=1992|last1=Cook|first1=K. S.|last2=Whitmeyer|first2=J. M.}}</ref>\n\nHomans developed five key propositions that assist in structuring individuals' behaviors based on rewards and costs. This set of theoretical ideas represents the core of Homans's version of social exchange theory.<ref name=Cook/>\n*The first proposition: the Success Proposition states that behavior that creates positive outcomes is likely to be repeated.\n* The second proposition: the Stimulus Proposition believes that if an individual's behavior is rewarded in the past, the individual will continue the previous behavior.\n*The third proposition: the Value proposition believes that if the result of a behavioral action is considered valuable to the individual, it is more likely for that behavior to occur.\n*The fourth proposition: the Deprivation-satiation proposition believes that if an individual has received the same reward several times, the value of that reward will diminish.\n*The fifth proposition discusses when emotions occur due to different reward situations. Those who receive more than they expect or do not receive anticipated punishment will be happy and will behave approvingly.<ref name=Cook/>\n\n=== Frazer ===\nBased on economics, Frazer's theory about social exchange emphasizes the importance of power and status differentiations in social exchange. Frazer's theory had a particular interest in the cross-cousin marriage. \n\n=== Malinowski ===\nWith his Kula exchange, Malinowski drew a sharp differentiation between economic exchange and social exchange. Using his Kula exchange, Malinowski states that the motives of exchange can be mainly social and psychological.\n\n=== Mauss ===\nMauss's theory tries to identify the role played by morality and religion in the social exchange. Mauss argues the exchange found in the society is influenced by social behaviors, while morality and religion influence all aspects of life. \n\n=== Bohannan ===\nBohannan focuses his theory on economic problems such as multicentrism, and modes of exchange. He contributed to the social exchange theory finding the role and function of markets in tribal subsistence economies, makes a distinction of economic redistribution and market exchange from social relationships. \n\n=== Polanyi ===\nHe proposes three principles to create a new idea for socioeconomic change, transforming traditional economies, and political economic development. These principles are: reciprocity, redistribution and marketing.\n\n=== Sahlins ===\nHe presents the idea that the economy is a category of behavior instead of just a simple category of culture. \n\n==Assumptions==\nSocial exchange theory is not one theory but a frame of reference within which many theories can speak to another, whether in argument or mutual support.<ref name=Emerson/> All these theories are built upon several assumptions about human nature and the nature of relationships. Thibaut and Kelley have based their theory on two conceptualizations: one that focuses on the nature of individuals and one that describes the relationships between two people. Thus, the assumptions they make also fall into these categories.\nThe assumptions that social exchange theory makes about human nature include the following:<ref name=\"West 2007 188\">{{cite book\n | last=West | first=Richard\n | last2=Turner | first2=Lynn\n | year=2007\n | title=Introducing Communication Theory\n | page=188\n | publisher=McGraw Hill}}</ref>\n\n*Humans seek rewards and avoid punishments.\n*Humans are rational beings.\n*The standards that humans use to evaluate costs and rewards vary over time and from person to person.\n\nThe assumptions social exchange theory makes about the nature of relationships include the following:<ref name=\"West 2007 188\"/>\n\n*Relationships are interdependent.\n*Relational life is a process.\n\nThe [[prisoner's dilemma]] is a widely used example in game theory that attempts to illustrate why or how two individuals may not cooperate with each other, even if it is in their best interest to do so. It demonstrates that while cooperation would give the best outcome, people might nevertheless act selfishly.<ref>{{cite book\n | last=Thibaut | first=N.\n | last2=Kelley | first2=H.\n | year=1959\n | title= The social psychology of groups\n | url=https://archive.org/details/socialpsychology00thib | publisher=New York Wiley}}{{page needed|date=October 2014}}</ref>\nAll relationships involve exchanges although the balance of this exchange is not always equal. We cannot achieve our goals alone so as humans sometimes we have to become actors. In the world today we see actors as unemotional people but that is not the case once we reach our goals in the end.\n\n==Comparison levels==\nSocial exchange includes \"both a notion of a relationship, and some notion of a shared obligation in which both parties perceive responsibilities to each other\".<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0149206307307635|title=Taking a Multifoci Approach to the Study of Justice, Social Exchange, and Citizenship Behavior: The Target Similarity Model |journal=Journal of Management|volume=33|issue=6|pages=841\u2013866|year=2007|last1=Lavelle|first1=J. J.|last2=Rupp|first2=D. E.|last3=Brockner|first3=J.}}</ref> [[John Thibaut]] and [[Harold Kelley]] proposed two comparison standards to differentiate between relationship satisfaction and relationship stability. This evaluation rests on two types of comparisons: '''Comparison Level''' and '''Comparison Level for Alternative'''. According to Thibaut and Kelley, the Comparison Level (CL) is a standard representing what people feel they should receive in the way of rewards and costs from a particular relationship. An individual's comparison level can be considered the standard by which an outcome seems to satisfy the individual.<ref name=\"Griffin\">{{cite book |editor1-last=Griffin |editor1-first=Em |title=A First Look at Communication Theory |first1=John |last1=Thibaut |first2=Harold |last2=Kelley |chapter=Social Exchange Theory |pages=196\u2013205 |chapterurl=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0073385026/228359/socialexchange.pdf |publisher=McGraw Hill |isbn=978-0-07-338502-0 |year=2008}}</ref>  The Comparison Level for Alternative (CLalt) refers to \"the lowest level of relational rewards a person is willing to accept given available rewards from alternative relationships or being alone\".<ref>{{cite book\n | last=Roloff| first=Michael\n | year=1981\n | title=Interpersonal communication: The social exchange approach\n | page=48\n | publisher=Beverly Hills}}</ref> In other words, when using this evaluation tool, an individual will consider other alternative payoffs or rewards outside of the current relationship or exchange.<ref name=\"Griffin\"/> CLalt provides a measure of stability rather than satisfaction. If people see no alternative and fear being alone more than being in the relationship, social exchange theory predicts they will stay.<ref>{{cite book | last=West | first=Richard | last2=Turner | first2=Lynn | year=2007 | title=Introducing Communication Theory | page=191 | publisher=McGraw Hill}}</ref>\n\n==Modes of exchange==\nAccording to Kelley and Thibaut, people engage in Behavioral Sequence, or a series of actions designed to achieve their goal. This is congruent with their assumption that human beings are [[rational]].<ref name=\"West 2007 193\">{{cite book\n | last=West | first=Richard\n | last2=Turner | first2=Lynn\n | year=2007\n | title=Introducing Communication Theory\n | page=193\n | publisher=McGraw Hill}}</ref> When people engage in these behavioral sequences, they are dependent to some extent on their relational partner. In order for behavioral sequences to lead to social exchange, two conditions must be achieved: \"It must be oriented towards ends that can only be achieved through interaction with other persons, and it must seek to adapt means to further the achievement of these ends\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Blau|first=Peter M.|title=Exchange & Power in Social Life|year=1964|publisher=Transaction| isbn = 9780887386282}}</ref> The concept of reciprocity also derives from this pattern. The reciprocity principle refers to the mutual reinforcement by two parties of each other's actions.<ref>Ekeh, Peter P.. Social exchange theory: the two traditions. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1974.{{page needed|date=October 2014}}</ref> The process begins when at least one participant makes a \"move\", and if the other reciprocates, new rounds of exchange initiate. Once the process is in motion, each consequence can create a self-reinforcing cycle. Even though the norm of reciprocity may be a universally accepted principle, the degree to which people and cultures apply this concept varies.<ref name=Zafirovski />\n\n===Power dependence relations===\nSeveral definitions of power have been offered by exchange theorists. For instance, some theorists view power as distinct from exchanges, some view it as a kind of exchange and others believe power is a medium of exchange.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Baldwin|first=David|title=Power and Social Exchange|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=72|issue=4|pages=1229\u20131242|jstor=1954536|doi=10.2307/1954536|year=1978}}</ref> However, the most useful definition of power is that proposed by Emerson,<ref name=\"Befu1977\">{{cite journal |last=Befu |first=H. |year=1977 |title=Social Exchange |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |volume=6 |issue= |pages=255\u201381 |jstor=2949333 |doi=10.1146/annurev.an.06.100177.001351}}</ref> who developed a theory of power-dependence relations.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Auld |first=C. |last2=Case |first2=A. |title=Social exchange processes in leisure and non-leisure settings: A review and exploratory investigation |journal=Journal of Leisure Research |year=1997 |volume=29 |issue=2 |page=183 |doi= 10.1080/00222216.1997.11949793|url=http://js.sagamorepub.com/jlr/article/view/810 }}</ref> According to this theory, the dependence a person has on another brings up the concept of power.<ref name=\"West 2007 188\" /> Power differentiation affects social structures by causing inequalities between members of different groups, such as an individual having superiority over another.<ref name=Zafirovski>{{cite journal |last=Zafirovski |first=Milan |title=Social Exchange Theory Under Scrutiny: A Positive Critique of its Economic-Behaviorist Formulations |journal=Electronic Journal of Sociology |year=2005 |url=http://www.sociology.org/content/2005/tier2/SETheory.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924103311/http://www.sociology.org/content/2005/tier2/SETheory.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 }}</ref> Power within the theory is governed by two variables : the structure of power in exchange networks and strategic use.<ref name=\"Zafirovski\" /> Experimental data show that the position an actor occupies in a social exchange network determines relative dependence and therefore power.<ref>(Stolte and Emerson, 1976)</ref>\n\nAccording to Thibaut and Kelley, there are two types of power: fate control and behavior control. Fate control is the ability to affect a partner's outcomes.<ref name=\"West 2007 188\"/> Behavior control is the power to cause another's behavior to change by changing one's own behavior.<ref name=\"West 2007 188\"/>\n\n===Matrices===\nPeople develop patterns of exchange to cope with power differentials and to deal with the costs associated with exercising power.<ref name=\"West 2007 188\"/> These patterns describe behavioral rules or norms that indicate how people trade resources in an attempt to maximize rewards and minimize costs. Three different matrices have been described by Thibaut and Kelley to illustrate the patterns people develop. These are given matrix, the effective matrix and the dispositional matrix.<ref>{{cite book\n | last=West | first=Richard\n | last2=Turner | first2=Lynn\n | year=2007\n | title=Introducing Communication Theory\n | page=194\n | publisher=McGraw Hill}}</ref>\n\n*The given matrix represents the behavioral choices and outcomes that are determined by a combination of external factors (environment) and internal factors (the specific skills each interactant possesses).<ref name=\"West 2007 193\"/>\n*The effective matrix \"which represents an expansion of alternative behaviors and/or outcomes which ultimately determines the behavioral choices in social exchange\"<ref>{{cite book\n | last=Roloff| first=Michael\n | year=1981\n | title=Interpersonal communication: The social exchange approach\n | page=51\n | publisher=Beverly Hills}}</ref>\n*The dispositional matrix represents the way two people believe that rewards ought to be exchanged between them.<ref>{{cite book\n | last=West | first=Richard\n | last2=Turner | first2=Lynn\n | year=2007\n | title=Introducing Communication Theory\n | page=195\n | publisher=McGraw Hill}}</ref>\n\nThere are three forms within these matrices: [[Norm of reciprocity|Reciprocity]], Generalized Exchange, and Productive Exchange. In a direct exchange, reciprocation is confined to the two actors. One social actor provides value to another one and the other reciprocates. There are three different types of reciprocity:<ref name = Cropanzano>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0149206305279602|title=Social Exchange Theory: An Interdisciplinary Review|journal=Journal of Management|volume=31|issue=6|pages=874\u2013900|year=2005|last1=Cropanzano|first1=R.|last2=Mitchell|first2=M. S.}}</ref>\n#Reciprocity as a transactional pattern of interdependent exchanges\n#Reciprocity as a folk belief\n#Reciprocity as a moral norm\n\nA generalized exchange involves indirect reciprocity between three or more individuals.<ref name=\"Trust and Transitions\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0190272509359616|year=2010|title=The Contentious Social Interactionism of Charles Tilly|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|volume=73|pages=5\u201310|last1=Collins|first1=R.}}</ref> For example, one person gives to another and the recipient responds by giving to another person other than the first person. Productive exchange means that both actors have to contribute for either one of them to benefit. Both people incur benefits and costs simultaneously.\n\nAnother common form of exchange is negotiated exchange which focuses on the negotiation of rules in order for both parties to reach a beneficial agreement.<ref name=Cropanzano /> Reciprocal exchanges and negotiated exchanges are often analyzed and compared to discover their essential differences. One major difference between the two exchanges is the level of risks associated with the exchange and the uncertainty these risks create (ref). Negotiated exchange can consist of binding and non-binding negotiations. When comparing the levels of risk within these exchanges, reciprocal exchange has the highest level of risk which in result produces the most uncertainty.<ref name=\"Trust and Transitions\"/> An example of a risk that could occur during the reciprocal exchange is the factor that the second party could end up not returning the favor and completing the reciprocal exchange. Binding negotiated exchanges involve the least amount of risks which will result the individuals feeling low levels of uncertainty. Whereas non-binding negotiated exchanges and their level of risks and uncertainty fall in between the amount of risks associated with reciprocal and binding negotiated exchanges.<ref name=\"Trust and Transitions\"/> Since there is not a binding agreement involved, one party involved in the exchange could decide to not cooperate with the agreement.\n\n==Critiques==\n\nKatherine Miller outlines several major objections to or problems with the social exchange theory as developed from early seminal works<ref>{{cite book\n | last=Katherine| first=Miller\n | year=2005\n | title=Communication Theories\n | publisher=McGraw Hill\n | location= New York }}{{page needed|date=October 2014}}</ref>\n*The theory reduces human interaction to a purely rational process that arises from economic theory.\n*The theory favors openness as it was developed in the 1970s when ideas of freedom and openness were preferred, but there may be times when openness isn't the best option in a relationship.\n*The theory assumes that the ultimate goal of a relationship is intimacy when this might not always be the case.\n*The theory places relationships in a linear structure, when some relationships might skip steps or go backwards in terms of intimacy.\n\nRussell Cropanzano and Marie S. Mitchell discuss how one of the major issues within the social exchange theory is the lack of information within studies on the various exchange rules.<ref name = Cropanzano/> Reciprocity is a major exchange rule discussed but, Cropanzano and Mitchell write that the theory would be better understood if more research programs discussed a variety of exchange rules such as [[altruism]], group gain, status consistency and competition.<ref name = Cropanzano/> Meeker points out that within the exchange process, each unit takes into account at least the following elements: reciprocity, rationality, altruism (social responsibility), group gain, status, consistency, and competition (rivalry).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Walczak | first1 = D | year = 2015 | title = The process of exchange, solidarity and sustainable development in building a community of responsibility | url = | journal = Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences | volume = 6 | issue = 1S1 | page = 507 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Meeker | first1 = B.

Specifically, Rosenfeld looked at the limitations of interracial couples and the application of social exchange theory. His analysis suggest that in modern society, there is less of a gap between interracial partners education level, socioeconomic status, and social class level which in turn, makes the previously understood application of social exchange moot.<ref>Rosenfeld, M. J. (2005). A Critique of Exchange Theory in Mate Selection. ''American Journal Of Sociology'', ''110''(5), 1284-1325. doi:10.1086/428441</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2010}}\n\nThe most extensive application of social exchange has been in the area of interpersonal relationships.<ref name=\"georgetown2005\"/> However, social exchange theory materializes in many different situations with the same idea of the exchange of resources.  Self-Interest can encourage individuals to make decisions that will benefit themselves overall. Homans once summarized the theory by stating:\n\n:Social behavior is an exchange of goods, material goods but also non-material ones, such as the symbols of approval or prestige. Persons that give much to others try to get much from them, and persons that get much from others are under pressure to give much to them. This process of influence tends to work out at equilibrium to a balance in the exchanges. For a person in an exchange, what he gives may be a cost to him, just as what he gets may be a reward, and his behavior changes less as the difference of the two, profit, tends to a maximum (\"Theories Used in Research\").\n\n===Anthropology===\nOther applications that developed the idea of exchange include field of [[anthropology]] as evidenced in an article by Harumi Befu, which discusses cultural ideas and [[social norm|norms]].  L\u00e9vi-Strauss is considered as one of the major contributors to the anthropology of exchange. Within this field, self-interest, human sentiment and motivational process are not considered.<ref name=\"Befu1977\" /> L\u00e9vi\u2013Strauss uses a [[collectivist]] approach to explain exchanges. To L\u00e9vi-Strauss, a social exchange is defined as a regulated form of behavior in the context of societal rules and norms.  This contrasts with psychological studies of exchange in which behaviors are studied ignoring the culture. Social exchanges from the anthropological perspective have been analyzed using the gift-giving phenomena. The concept of reciprocity under this perspective states that individuals can directly reward his benefactor or another person in the social exchange process.<ref>{{cite journal |jstor=256704 |doi=10.2307/256704|pmid=10134637|title=Citizenship Behavior and Social Exchange|journal=Academy of Management Journal|volume=37|issue=3|pages=656\u201369|year=1994|last1=Konovsky|first1=M. A.|last2=Pugh|first2=S. D.}}</ref> L\u00e9vi-Strauss developed the theory of cousin marriage based on the pervasiveness of gift-giving in primitive societies. The basis of this theory is the distinction between restricted exchanges, which is only capable of connecting pairs of social groups, and generalize exchange, which integrates indefinite numbers of groups.<ref name=\"Befu1977\" />\n\n===Relationships===\nThroughout the theory, one can also end up losing relationships that were already established because the feeling of no longer being beneficial. One feels as if there is not longer a need for a relationship or communication due to lack of rewards. Once this happens, the process of looking for new partners and resources occurs. This allows a continuation of networking. One may go through this process quite frequently. A study applied this theory to new media (online dating).

It has contributed to the study of organization-stakeholder relationships and [[relationship marketing]]. The investment model proposed by [[Caryl Rusbult]] is a useful version of social exchange theory. According to this model, investments serve to stabilize relationships. The greater the nontransferable investments a person has in a given relationship, the more stable the relationship is likely to be. The same investment concept is applied in relationship marketing. Databases are the major instrument to build differentiated relationships between organizations and customers. Through the information process, companies identify the customer's own individual needs. From this perspective, a client becomes an investment. If a customer decides to choose another competitor, the investment will be lost.<ref name=\"georgetown2005\"/> When people find they have invested too much to quit a relationship or enterprise, they pour additional resources into the relationship to salvage their initial investment. Exchange has been a central research thrust in business-to-business relational exchange.<ref name=\"Lambe, C. Jay 2001\"/> According to the study conducted by Lambe, C. Jay, C. Michael Wittmann, and Robert E. Spekman firms evaluate economic and social outcomes from each transaction and compare them to what they feel they deserve. Firms also look for additional benefits provided by other potential exchange partners. The initial transaction between companies is crucial to determine if their relationship will expand, remain the same or will dissolve.<ref name=\"Lambe, C. Jay 2001\"/>\n\n===Work settings===\nA study conducted by A. Saks serves as an example to explain engagement of employees in organizations. This study uses one of the tenets of social exchange theory to explain that obligations are generated through a series of interactions between parties who are in a state of reciprocal interdependence. The research identified that when individuals receive economic and socioemotional resources from their organization, they feel obliged to respond in kind and repay the organization. This is a description of engagement as a two-way relationship between the employer and employee. One way for individuals to repay their organization is through their level of engagement. The more engaged the employee are to their work, the greater amounts of cognitive, emotional, and physical resources they will devote to perform their job duties. When the organization fails to provide economic or emotional resources, the employees are more likely to withdraw and disengage themselves from their roles.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Antecedents and consequences of employee engagement|last = Saks|first = A.M.|date = 2006|journal = Journal of Managerial Psychology  |volume=21 |issue=7 |pages=600\u201319 |doi=10.1108/02683940610690169}}</ref>\n\n===Citizenship behavior===\nSocial exchange theory is a theoretical explanation for [[organizational citizenship behavior]].

Formalized by Lawler (2001), the affect theory examines the structural conditions of exchange that produce emotions and feelings and then identifies how individuals attribute these emotions to different social units (exchange partners, groups, or networks).<ref name=\"Lawler\">{{cite journal |jstor=10.1086/324071 |doi=10.1086/324071|title=An Affect Theory of Social Exchange|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=107|issue=2|pages=321\u2013352|year=2001|last1=Lawler|first1=Edward J.|url=https://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1661&context=articles}}</ref> These attributions of emotion, in turn, dictate how strongly individuals feel attached to their partners or groups, which drives collectively oriented behavior and commitment to the relationship.\n\n===Assumptions===\n\nMost social exchange models have three basic assumptions in common: behavior in a social sense is based on exchanges, if an individual allows someone to receives a reward the person then feels the need to reciprocate due to social pressure and individuals will try to minimize their cost while gaining the most from the reward.<ref>Sprecher, S., (1998). Social exchange theories and sexuality. Journal of Sex Research, 35(1), 32\u201343.</ref> The affect theory of social exchange is based on assumptions that stem from social exchange theory and [[affect theory]]:\n\n*There are three or more individuals who have the opportunity to make exchanges with one another. These actors are able to make decisions about whether to exchange, with whom to exchange, and under what terms to execute an exchange.\n*Social exchange produces emotions that are positive to negative\n*Emotions can be construed as reward or punishment (i.e. feeling good has a positive value and feeling bad has a negative value).\n*Individuals try to avoid negative emotions and to reproduce positive emotions in social exchange.\n*Individuals will try to understand the source or cause of feelings produced by social exchange. In this way, emotions become attributed to the object that caused them.\n*Individuals interpret and exchange their feelings with respect to social relationships (e.g. partners, groups, networks). Positive emotions produced by exchange will increase solidarity in these relationships, while negative emotions will decrease solidarity.\n\n===Theoretical propositions===\n\nAffect theory of social exchange shows how the conditions of exchanges promote interpersonal and group relationships through emotions and affective processes. The theoretical arguments center on the following five claims:\n\n'''Emotions produced by exchange are involuntary, internal responses'''\n\nIndividuals experience emotions (general feelings of pleasantness or unpleasantness) depending on whether their exchange is successful.  These emotions are construed as a reward (or punishment) and individuals strive to repeat actions that reproduce positive emotions or avoid negative emotions.\n\n'''Individuals attempt to understand what in a social exchange situation produces emotions'''\n\nIndividuals will use the exchange task to understand the source (partners, groups, or networks) of their emotions. Individuals are more likely to attribute their emotions to their exchange partners or groups when the task can only be completed with one or more partners, when the task requires interdependent (nonseparable) contributions, and when there is a shared sense of responsibility for the success or failure of the exchange.\n\n'''The mode of exchange determines the features of the exchange task and influences the attribution of the emotion produced'''\n\nThe [[Social exchange theory#Comparison levels|mode of exchange]] (productive, negotiated, reciprocal, or generalized) provides a description of the exchange task. The task features are defined by the degree of interdependence (separability of tasks) and shared responsibility between partners to complete the task. These features influence the strength of the emotion felt. Productive exchanges are interdependent and this high degree of nonseparability generates the strongest emotions. Reciprocal exchanges are separable which reduces the perceptions of shared responsibility. The exchange produces little emotional response, but individuals instead express emotions in response to the asymmetrical transaction. Generalized exchanges do not occur directly, but interdependence is still high and coordination between partners is difficult. Because there is no direct emotional foundation, emotions produced are low. Negotiated exchanges may produce conflicting emotions due to the mixed-motive nature of negotiations; even when transactions are successful, individuals may feel like they had the ability to do better, creating emotional ambivalence. Overall, productive exchanges produce the strongest attributions of emotions, generalized (indirect) exchange the weakest, with negotiated and reciprocal exchanges in between.\n\n'''The attribution of emotions resulting from different exchange modes impact the solidarity felt with partners or groups'''\n\nThe different types of exchange (productive, reciprocal, and generalized) also impact the solidarity or identification that an individual will feel with their exchange partners or group. The different exchange types help dictate the target of felt emotions and influences an individual's attachment. Affective attachment occurs when a social unit (partner or group) is the target of positive feelings from exchange; affective detachment (alienation) occurs when a social unit is the target of negative feelings from failure to exchange.<ref name=\"Lawler\" /> Affective attachment increases solidarity. Similar to the attribution of emotion, productive exchange produces the strongest affective attachments, generalized exchange the weakest, and negotiated and reciprocal exchange are in between.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nOne condition for how social (partner or group) attributions can increase solidarity is by reducing self-serving attributions of credit or blame for the success or failure of the exchange. When individuals have group attributions for positive emotions stemming from success, this eliminates any [[self-serving bias]]es and enhances both pride in the self and gratitude to the partner. However, group attributions for negative emotions stemming from failure do not eliminate self-serving biases, resulting in more anger toward the partner or group than shame in the self.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nLawler also proposes that the persistence (stability) and ability to control acts by the exchange partner (controllability) provide conditions for affective attachment by attributing credit or blame for the success or failure of the exchange.<ref name=\"Lawler\" /> Following Weiner (1985)<ref name=\"Weiner\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.92.4.548|pmid=3903815|title=An attributional theory of achievement motivation and emotion|journal=Psychological Review|volume=92|issue=4|pages=548\u201373|year=1985|last1=Weiner|first1=Bernard}}</ref> affect theory of social exchange extrapolates that the combinations of stability and uncontrollability elicit different emotions. In social exchange, social connections can be sources of stability and controllability. For example, if an exchange partner is perceived as a stable source of positive feelings, and the exchange partner has control in the acts that elicit those positive feelings, this will strengthen affective attachment. Therefore, affect theory of social exchange proposes that stable and controllable sources of positive feelings (i.e. pleasantness, pride, gratitude) will elicit affective attachments while stable and uncontrollable sources of negative feelings (i.e. unpleasantness, shame, anger) will elicit affective detachment.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n'''Through these emotional processes, networks can develop group properties'''\n\nRepeated exchanges allow a network to evolve into a group. Affect theory highlights the contributions of emotions in producing group properties. Successful interactions generate positive feelings for the involved individuals, which motivates them to interact with the same partners in the future. As exchanges repeat, the strong relationships become visible to other parties, making salient their role as a group and helping to generate a group identity that continues to bind the partners together in a network. Affect theory predicts that networks of negotiated and reciprocal exchange will tend to promote stronger relational ties within partners; productive or generalized exchange will promote stronger network or group-level ties.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Complexity science]]\n* [[Equity theory]]\n* [[Institutional]]\n* [[Interdependence]]\n* [[Open innovation]]\n* [[Predicted outcome value theory]]\n* [[Rational agent]]\n* [[Social action]]\n* [[Social good]]\n* [[Social interaction]]\n* [[Social networks]]\n* [[Value conversion]]\n* [[Value (economics)]]\n* [[Value network]]\n* [[Value network analysis]]\n* [[Vulnerability and care theory of love]]\n}}<ref>Stolte, John F. and Emerson, Richard M.

England won the final by four [[Wicket#Winning by number of wickets|wickets]], clinching their third World Cup title and their first outside England.

[[Nicky Shaw]], one of England's bowlers, took a career-best four wickets for 34 runs. In their response, England built an opening [[Partnership (cricket)|partnership]] of 74 runs and continued to score steadily. Despite regularly losing wickets, they reached the winning total with 23 [[Delivery (cricket)|balls]] to spare, earning England their first World Cup title for 16 years. Shaw, who had initially not been included in the England team, was named [[Player of the Match awards (cricket)|player of the match]] having replaced the injured [[Jenny Gunn]] just minutes before the game started.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[2009 Women's Cricket World Cup]] was the ninth edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]], and the first to be organised by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC).<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802230336/http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/the-icc/pepsi_icc_development_programme/woman_cricket.php |title=Women's Cricket |publisher=[[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) |url=http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/the-icc/pepsi_icc_development_programme/woman_cricket.php |url-status=dead |archivedate=2 August 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>{{efn|The ICC took over administration of the women's game in 2005, when it merged with the [[International Women's Cricket Council]] (IWCC).<ref>{{cite book |title=Routledge Handbook of Global Sport |editor1-last=Nauright |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Zipp |editor2-first=Sarah |year=2020 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon]] |p=202 |isbn=978-1-138-88723-7}}</ref>}} The first had been [[1973 Women's Cricket World Cup|held in 1973]], pre-dating the first [[Cricket World Cup|men's Cricket World Cup]] by two years.<ref name=\"icc-hist\">{{cite web |url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/womens-world-cup/history |title=ICC Women's World Cup History |publisher=[[International Cricket Council]] |accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref> The 2009 tournament included eight teams; six of which ([[Australia women's national cricket team|Australia]], [[England women's cricket team|England]], [[India women's national cricket team|India]], [[New Zealand women's national cricket team|New Zealand]], [[Sri Lanka women's national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] and the [[West Indies women's cricket team|West Indies]]) qualified automatically due to finishing as the top six teams at the [[2005 Women's Cricket World Cup]], while the other two (Pakistan and South Africa) qualified through the [[2008 Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Women's Cricket and Global Processes: The Emergence and Development of Women's Cricket as a Global Game |last=Velija |first=Philippa |year=2015 |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |location=[[Basingstoke]] |p=102 |isbn=978-1-137-32351-4}}</ref> Matches took place at various cricket grounds in Australia between 7 and 22 March, featuring 25 matches over 16 days.<ref name=\"matches\">{{cite web |url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/scores/series/8584/season/2009/icc-womens-world-cup |title=ICC Women's World Cup 2009 \u2013 Fixtures and Results |website=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the ICC had successfully developed and expanded the women's game, from 15 member countries in 2005 to 42 in 2007, there was still a growing gap between the top four teams\u2014Australia, England, India and New Zealand\u2014and the rest.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TIAnBwAAQBAJ |title=Cricket and Globalization |editor1-last=Rumford |editor1-first=Chris |editor2-last=Wagg |editor2-first=Stephen |year=2010 |publisher=[[Cambridge Scholars Publishing]] |location=[[Newcastle upon Tyne]] |isbn=978-1-4438-2370-8 |chapter=Women at the Wicket: The Development of Women's Cricket in England and Overseas |last1=Velija |first1=Philippa |last2=Ratna |first2=Aarti |last3=Flintoff |first3=Anne |pages=115\u2013116}}</ref> In 2008, England, and then Australia, became the first teams to introduce contracts for some of their women's players;<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/22864609/australia-women-handed-contracts |title=Australia women handed contracts |last=Roesler |first=Jenny |work=ESPNcricinfo |date=30 June 2008 |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref> [[Charlotte Edwards]], England's [[Captain (cricket)|captain]], said that this allowed the players to \"commit to training without worrying about our jobs outside cricket.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BcOkAwAAQBAJ |title=Young Wisden: A New Fan's Guide to Cricket |last1=de Lisle |first1=Tim |last2=Booth |first2=Lawrence |publisher=John Wisden & Co |location=London |year=2011 |orig-year=2007 |page=40 |isbn=978-1-4081-2463-5}}</ref> Before the competition, Jenny Roesler of ''[[ESPNcricinfo|Cricinfo]]'' suggested England and New Zealand, along with Australia, as the favourites to win the competition.<ref name=\"three-way\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wwc2009/content/story/393395.html |title=A three-way battle to stand on top of the world |last=Roesler |first=Jenny |website=ESPNcricinfo |date=6 March 2009 |accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> [[Haidee Tiffen]], the captain of New Zealand, said that she thought \"Australia, New Zealand, England and India are of equal strength and any team can beat the other on its day.

It is unlikely Plato was the first in this field (Vlastos, p. 52).</ref>\n\nAs for discovering the real-life Socrates, the difficulty is that ancient sources are mostly philosophical or dramatic texts, apart from Xenophon. There are no straightforward histories, contemporary with Socrates, that dealt with his own time and place. A corollary of this is that sources that do mention Socrates do not necessarily claim to be historically accurate, and are often partisan. For instance, those who prosecuted and convicted Socrates have left no testament. Historians, therefore, face the challenge of reconciling the various evidence from the extant texts in order to attempt an accurate and consistent account of Socrates's life and work. The result of such an effort is not necessarily realistic, even if consistent.\n\nTwo factors emerge from all sources pertaining to the character of Socrates: that he was ugly (at least as an older man), and had a brilliant intellect.<ref name=\"D.R.

Also, Xenophon, being a historian, is a more reliable witness to the historical Socrates. It is a matter of much debate over which Socrates it is who Plato is describing at any given point\u2014the historical figure, or Plato's fictionalization. As British philosopher [[Martin Cohen (philosopher)|Martin Cohen]] has put it, \"Plato, the idealist, offers an idol, a master figure, for philosophy. A Saint, a prophet of 'the Sun-God', a teacher condemned for his teachings as a heretic.\"<ref>Cohen, M., [https://books.google.com/books?id=yhUg7xHDggIC ''Philosophical Tales: Being an Alternative History Revealing the Characters, the Plots, and the Hidden Scenes That Make Up the True Story of Philosophy''], John Wiley & Sons, 2008, p. 5, {{ISBN|1-4051-4037-2}}.</ref>\n\nIt is also clear from other writings and historical artifacts, that Socrates was not simply a character, nor an invention, of Plato.

However, in ''The Clouds'', Aristophanes portrays Socrates as running a [[Sophist]] school with [[Chaerephon]]. Also, in Plato's ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'' and ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', as well as in Xenophon's accounts, Socrates explicitly denies accepting payment for teaching. More specifically, in the ''Apology'', Socrates cites his poverty as proof that he is not a teacher.\n[[File:Regnault Socrates Tears Alcibiades from the Embrace of Sensual Pleasure.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Socrates Tears Alcibiades from the Embrace of Sensual Pleasure by [[Jean-Baptiste Regnault]] (1791)]]\n\nTwo fragments are extant of the writings by the [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] philosopher [[Timon of Phlius]] pertaining to Socrates.<ref name=\"R Bett (S Ahbel-Rappe \u2013 Associate Professor of Greek and Latin at the University of Michigan, R Kamtekar \u2013 Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of Arizona) \">{{cite book |last=Bett |first=R. |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WwpZVuylPgYC&pg=PA299 |title=A Companion to Socrates |pages=299\u201330 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-1-4051-9260-6 |date=11 May 2009}} (A translation of one fragment reads: \"But from them the sculptor, blatherer on the lawful, turned away.

Socrates appears to have been a critic of democracy,<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=W. |title=The Apology of Socrates, the Crito, and Part of the Phaedo: With Notes from Stallbaum, Schleiermacher's Introductions, A Life of Socrates, and Schleiermacher's Essay on the Worth of Socrates as a Philosopher |url=https://archive.org/details/apologyofsocrat00plat |publisher=Taylor Walton and Maberly |year=1852 |page=ciii note 1}}</ref> and some scholars interpret his trial as an expression of political infighting.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Emily R. |title=The Death of Socrates |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2007 |page=55}}</ref>\n\n[[File:David - The Death of Socrates.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|''[[The Death of Socrates]]'', by [[Jacques-Louis David]] (1787)]]\nClaiming loyalty to his city, Socrates clashed with the current course of Athenian politics and society.<ref>Here it is telling to refer to [[Thucydides]] ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Thuc.+3.82.8 3.82.8] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221130537/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Thuc.+3.82.8 |date=21 December 2007 }}): \"Reckless audacity came to be considered the courage of a loyal ally; prudent hesitation, specious cowardice; moderation was held to be a cloak for unmanliness; ability to see all sides of a question inaptness to act on any. Frantic violence, became the attribute of manliness; cautious plotting, a justifiable means of self-defense. The advocate of extreme measures was always trustworthy; his opponent a man to be suspected.\"</ref> He praised Sparta, archrival to Athens, directly and indirectly in various dialogues. One of Socrates' purported offences to the city was his position as a social and moral critic. Rather than upholding a status quo and accepting the development of what he perceived as immorality within his region, Socrates questioned the collective notion of \"might makes right\" that he felt was common in Greece during this period. Plato refers to Socrates as the \"[[Social gadfly|gadfly]]\" of the state (as the gadfly stings the horse into action, so Socrates stung various Athenians), insofar as he irritated some people with considerations of justice and the pursuit of goodness.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book |last=Waterfield |first=Robin |title=Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths |location=New York |publisher=W.W. Norton and Company |year=2009}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Plato's ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'', Socrates's life as the \"gadfly\" of Athens began when his friend Chaerephon asked the [[Pythia|Oracle at Delphi]] if anyone were wiser than Socrates; the Oracle responded that no one was wiser. Socrates believed the Oracle's response was not correct, because he believed he possessed no wisdom whatsoever. He proceeded to test the riddle by approaching men considered wise by the people of Athens\u2014statesmen, poets, and artisans\u2014in order to refute the Oracle's pronouncement. Questioning them, however, Socrates concluded: while each man thought he knew a great deal and was wise, in fact, they knew very little and were not wise at all. So Socrates interpreted the meaning of the Oracle thus: while so-called wise men thought themselves wise and yet were not, he himself knew he was not wise at all, which, paradoxically, made him the wiser one since he was the only person aware of his own ignorance. Socrates's paradoxical wisdom made the prominent Athenians he publicly questioned look foolish, turning them against him and leading to accusations of wrongdoing. Socrates defended his role as a gadfly until the end: at his trial when Socrates was asked to propose his own punishment, he suggested a wage paid by the government and free dinners for the rest of his life instead, to finance the time he spent as Athens's benefactor.<ref>Brun (1978).</ref>\n\n[[Robin Waterfield]] suggests that Socrates was a voluntary scapegoat; his death was the purifying remedy for Athens's misfortunes. In this view, the token of appreciation for [[Asclepius]] (the Greek god for curing illness) \u2013 the cockerel that he speaks of to [[Crito]] \u2013 would represent a cure for Athens's ailments.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> However, because a cockerel was a common thanks-offering and of no great value, this interpretation has been disputed; Socrates may only have been asking Crito to remember to fulfill a vow taken for the sake of an (unnamed) friend who had recovered from illness.\n\n==== Trial ====\n{{Main|Trial of Socrates}}\nIn 399&nbsp;BC, Socrates went on trial<ref>[[Myles Burnyeat|M.F.

It was first described by Plato in the ''Socratic Dialogues''. To solve a problem, it would be broken down into a series of questions, the answers to which gradually distill the answer a person would seek. The development and practice of this method is one of Socrates's most enduring contributions, and is a key factor in earning his mantle as the father of [[political philosophy]], [[ethics]] or moral philosophy, and as a figurehead of all the central themes in [[Western philosophy]]. The [[Socratic method]] has often been considered as a defining element of American legal education.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/nebklr78&div=12&id=&page= |title=The Decline of the Socratic Method at Harvard 78 Nebraska Law Review 1999 |website=heinonline.org|access-date=26 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020025451/http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals%2Fnebklr78&div=12&id=&page=|archive-date=20 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nTo illustrate the use of the Socratic method, a series of [[question]]s are posed to help a person or group to determine their underlying [[belief]]s and the extent of their knowledge. The Socratic method is a ''negative'' method of [[hypothesis]] elimination, in that better hypotheses are found by steadily identifying and eliminating those that lead to [[contradiction]]s. It was designed to force one to examine one's own beliefs and the validity of such beliefs.\n\nAn alternative interpretation of the dialectic is that it is a method for direct perception of the Form of the Good. Philosopher [[Karl Popper]] describes the dialectic as \"the art of intellectual intuition, of visualising the divine originals, the Forms or Ideas, of unveiling the Great Mystery behind the common man's everyday world of appearances.\"<ref>Popper, K. (1962) The Open Society and its Enemies, Volume 1 Plato, London, Routledge & Kegan Paul, p133.</ref> In a similar vein, French philosopher [[Pierre Hadot]] suggests that the dialogues are a type of spiritual exercise. Hadot writes that \"in Plato's view, every dialectical exercise, precisely because it is an exercise of pure thought, subject to the demands of the [[Logos]], turns the soul away from the sensible world, and allows it to convert itself towards the Good.\"<ref>Hadot, P. (1995) Philosophy as a Way of Life, Oxford, Blackwells, p. 93.</ref>\n\n=== Beliefs ===\nThe beliefs of Socrates, as distinct from those of Plato, are difficult to discern. Little in the way of concrete evidence exists to demarcate the two. The lengthy presentation of ideas given in most of the dialogues may be the ideas of Socrates himself, but which have been subsequently deformed or changed by Plato, and some scholars think Plato so adapted the Socratic style as to make the literary character and the philosopher himself impossible to distinguish. Others argue that he did have his own theories and beliefs.<ref name=\"Cohn2001\">{{cite journal |last1=Cohn |first1=Dorrit |title=Does Socrates Speak for Plato? Reflections on an Open Question |journal=New Literary History |volume=32 |issue=3 |year=2001 |pages=485\u2013500 |issn=1080-661X |doi=10.1353/nlh.2001.0030}}</ref> There is a degree of controversy inherent in the identifying of what these might have been, owing to the difficulty of separating Socrates from Plato and the difficulty of interpreting even the dramatic writings concerning Socrates. Consequently, distinguishing the philosophical beliefs of Socrates from those of Plato and Xenophon has not proven easy, so it must be remembered that what is attributed to Socrates might actually be more the specific concerns of these two thinkers instead.\n\nThe matter is complicated because the historical Socrates seems to have been notorious for asking questions but not answering, claiming to lack wisdom concerning the subjects about which he questioned others.<ref>Plato, ''Republic'' 336c and 337a, ''Theaetetus'' 150c, ''Apology'' 23a; Xenophon, ''Memorabilia'' 4.4.9; Aristotle, ''Sophistical Refutations'' 183b7.</ref>\n\nIf anything in general can be said about the philosophical beliefs of Socrates, it is that he was morally, intellectually, and politically at odds with many of his fellow Athenians. When he is on trial for heresy and corrupting the minds of the youth of Athens, he uses his method of ''elenchos'' to demonstrate to the jurors that their moral values are wrong-headed. He tells them they are concerned with their families, careers, and political responsibilities when they ought to be worried about the \"welfare of their souls\". Socrates's assertion that the gods had singled him out as a divine emissary seemed to provoke irritation, if not outright ridicule. Socrates also questioned the Sophistic doctrine that arete (virtue) can be taught. He liked to observe that successful fathers (such as the prominent military general [[Pericles]]) did not produce sons of their own quality. Socrates argued that moral excellence was more a matter of divine bequest than parental nurture. This belief may have contributed to his lack of anxiety about the future of his own sons.\n\nAlso, according to A. A. Long, \"There should be no doubt that, despite his claim to know only that he knew nothing, Socrates had strong beliefs about the divine\", and, citing Xenophon's ''Memorabilia'', 1.4, 4.3,:\n<blockquote> According to Xenophon, he was a [[Teleology|teleologist]] who held that god arranges everything for the best.<ref>Long, AA., in {{cite book |last=Ahbel-Rappe |first=S. |last2=Kamtekar |first2=R. |title=A Companion to Socrates |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2009 |page=59 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WwpZVuylPgYC&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=companion+socrates+teleologist#v=onepage&q=companion%20socrates%20teleologist&f=false |isbn=978-1-4051-9260-6}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nSocrates frequently says his ideas are not his own, but his teachers'. He mentions several influences: [[Prodicus]] the [[rhetor]] and [[Anaxagoras]] the philosopher. Perhaps surprisingly, Socrates claims to have been deeply influenced by two women besides his mother: he says that [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]] (cf. Plato's ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]''), a witch and priestess from [[Mantinea]], taught him all he knows about ''[[eros (love)|eros]]'', or [[love]]; and that [[Aspasia]], the mistress of [[Pericles]], taught him the art of rhetoric.<ref>Plato, ''Menexenus 235e''</ref> [[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]] argued that his principal teacher was the Anaxagorean [[Archelaus (philosopher)|Archelaus]] but his ideas were as Plato described them; [[Eric A. Havelock]], on the other hand, did not accept the view that Socrates's view was identical with that of Archelaus, in large part due to the reason of such anomalies ''and'' contradictions that have surfaced and \"post-dated his death.\"{{clarify|date=May 2019|reason=What does \"post-dated his death\" mean here?

On the one hand, he drew a clear line between human ignorance and ideal knowledge; on the other, Plato's ''Symposium'' (Diotima's Speech) and ''Republic'' (Allegory of the Cave) describe a method for ascending to wisdom.\n\nIn Plato's ''Theaetetus'' (150a), Socrates compares his treatment of the young people who come to him for philosophical advice to the way midwives treat their patients, and the way matrimonial matchmakers act. He says that he himself is a true matchmaker (\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ''promnestik\u00f3s'') in that he matches the young man to the best philosopher for his particular mind. However, he carefully distinguishes himself from a [[panderer]] (\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u1fb0\u03b3\u03c9\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 ''proagogos'') or procurer. This distinction is echoed in Xenophon's ''Symposium'' (3.20), when Socrates jokes about his certainty of being able to make a fortune, if he chose to practice the art of pandering. For his part as a philosophical interlocutor, he leads his respondent to a clearer conception of wisdom, although he claims he is not himself a teacher (''Apology''). His role, he claims, is more properly to be understood as analogous to a ''[[midwife]]'' (\u03bc\u03b1\u1fd6\u03b1 ''maia'').<ref>Boys-Stones, G., Rowe, C., [https://books.google.com/books?id=ec9NAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA173&dq=Theaetetus+Socrates+matchmaker&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7KY8VbqiBMbbate_gAg&ved=0CDMQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=Theaetetus%20Socrates%20matchmaker&f=false The Circle of Socrates: Readings in the First-Generation Socratics], Hackett Publishing, 2013, pp. 173\u201375.</ref><ref>Vander Waerdt, PA., [https://books.google.com/books?id=Etrz2pkeZvwC&pg=PA201&dq=Theaetetus+Socrates+matchmaker&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7KY8VbqiBMbbate_gAg&ved=0CDoQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=Theaetetus%20Socrates%20matchmaker&f=false The Socratic Movement], Cornell University Press, 1994, pp. 200\u201302.</ref>\n\nIn the ''Theaetetus'', Socrates explains that he is himself barren of theories, but knows how to bring the theories of others to birth and determine whether they are worthy or mere \"[[cock egg|wind eggs]]\" (\u1f00\u03bd\u03b5\u03bc\u03b9\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd ''anemiaion''). Perhaps significantly, he points out that midwives are barren due to age, and women who have never given birth are unable to become midwives; they would have no experience or knowledge of birth and would be unable to separate the worthy infants from those that should be left on the hillside to be exposed. To judge this, the midwife must have experience and knowledge of what she is judging.<ref>Plato, [https://books.google.com/books?id=g74pOFTqwcYC&dq=Theaetetus+Socrates+wind+egg&q=%22barren+midwife%22#v=snippet&q=%22barren%20midwife%22&f=false ''Theaetetus''].</ref><ref>Guthrie, WKC., [https://books.google.com/books?id=a-h35nyFR7IC&dq=socrates+midwives&q=%22other+midwives%22#v=onepage&q=%22wind-egg%22&f=false Socrates], Cambridge University Press, 1971, p. 126.</ref>\n\n=== Virtue ===\n[[File:Palermsoc.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.7|Bust of Socrates in the Palermo Archaeological Museum]]\nSocrates believed the best way for people to live was to focus on the pursuit of virtue rather than the pursuit, for instance, of material wealth.<ref>{{cite book |last=Brickhouse |first=TC. |last2=Smith |first2=N.D. |title=Socrates on Trial |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1990 |page=165}}</ref> He always invited others to try to concentrate more on friendships and a sense of true community, for Socrates felt this was the best way for people to grow together as a populace.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nichols |first=M.P. |title=Socrates and the Political Community: An Ancient Debate |publisher=SUNY Press |year=1987 |page=67}}</ref> His actions lived up to this standard: in the end, Socrates accepted his death sentence when most thought he would simply leave Athens, as he felt he could not run away from or go against the will of his community; as mentioned above, his reputation for valor on the battlefield was without reproach.\n\nThe idea that there are certain virtues formed a common thread in Socrates's teachings. These virtues represented the most important qualities for a person to have, foremost of which were the philosophical or intellectual virtues. Socrates stressed that \"[[the unexamined life is not worth living]] [and] ethical virtue is the only thing that matters.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Duignan |first=B. |title=The 100 Most Influential Philosophers of All Time |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |year=2009 |page=33}}</ref>\n\n=== Politics ===\nIt is argued that Socrates believed \"ideals belong in a world only the wise man can understand\",<ref>Attributed to \"Solomon\" in {{cite book |title=100 Most Influential People of All Times for Smartphones and Mobile Devices |publisher=Mobile Reference |year=2007}}</ref> making the philosopher the only type of person suitable to govern others. In Plato's dialogue the ''Republic'', Socrates openly objected to the [[democracy]] that ran Athens during his adult life. It was not only Athenian democracy: Socrates found short of ideal any government that did not conform to his presentation of a perfect regime led by philosophers, and Athenian government was far from that. It is, however, possible that the Socrates of Plato's ''Republic'' is colored by Plato's own views. During the last years of Socrates's life, Athens was in continual flux due to political upheaval. Democracy was at last overthrown by a [[Military dictatorship|junta]] known as the [[Thirty Tyrants]], led by Plato's relative, [[Critias]], who had once been a student and friend of Socrates. The Tyrants ruled for about a year before the Athenian democracy was reinstated, at which point it declared an [[amnesty]] for all recent events.\n\nSocrates's opposition to democracy is often denied, and the question is one of the biggest philosophical debates when trying to determine exactly what Socrates believed. The strongest argument of those who claim Socrates did not actually believe in the idea of philosopher kings is that the view is expressed no earlier than Plato's ''Republic'', which is widely considered one of Plato's \"Middle\" dialogues and not representative of the historical Socrates's views. Furthermore, according to Plato's ''Apology of Socrates'', an \"early\" dialogue, Socrates refused to pursue conventional politics; he often stated he could not look into other's matters or tell people how to live their lives when he did not yet understand how to live his own. He believed he was a philosopher engaged in the pursuit of Truth, and did not claim to know it fully. Socrates's acceptance of his death sentence after his conviction can also be seen to support this view. It is often claimed much of the anti-democratic leanings are from Plato, who was never able to overcome his disgust at what was done to his teacher. In any case, it is clear Socrates thought the rule of the Thirty Tyrants was also objectionable; when called before them to assist in the arrest of a fellow Athenian, Socrates refused and narrowly escaped death before the Tyrants were overthrown. He did, however, fulfill his duty to serve as ''[[Prytanis]]'' when a trial of a group of Generals who presided over a disastrous naval campaign were judged; even then, he maintained an uncompromizing attitude, being one of those who refused to proceed in a manner not supported by the laws, despite intense pressure.<ref>Kagen (1978).</ref> Judging by his actions, he considered the rule of the Thirty Tyrants less legitimate than the Democratic Senate that sentenced him to death.\n\nSocrates's apparent respect for democracy is one of the themes emphasized in the 2008 play ''[[Socrates on Trial (play)|Socrates on Trial]]'' by [[Andrew David Irvine]]. Irvine argues that it was because of his loyalty to Athenian democracy that Socrates was willing to accept the verdict of his fellow citizens. As Irvine puts it, \"During a time of war and great social and intellectual upheaval, Socrates felt compelled to express his views openly, regardless of the consequences. As a result, he is remembered today, not only for his sharp wit and high ethical standards, but also for his loyalty to the view that in a democracy the best way for a man to serve himself, his friends, and his city\u2014even during times of war\u2014is by being loyal to, and by speaking publicly about, the truth.\"<ref>Irvine, Andrew D. \"Introduction,\" ''Socrates on Trial,'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2008, p. 19.</ref>\n\n=== Covertness ===\nIn the Dialogues of Plato, though Socrates sometimes seems to support a [[mystical]] side, discussing [[reincarnation]] and the [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religions]], this is generally attributed to Plato.<ref>{{cite book |last=McPherran |first=M.L. |title=The Religion of Socrates |publisher=Penn State Press |year=1998 |page=268}}</ref> Regardless, this view of Socrates cannot be dismissed out of hand, as we cannot be sure of the differences between the views of Plato and Socrates; in addition, there seem to be some corollaries in the works of Xenophon. In the culmination of the philosophic path as discussed in Plato's ''Symposium'', one comes to the [[Sea of Beauty]] or to the sight of \"the beautiful itself\" (211C); only then can one become wise. (In the ''Symposium'', Socrates credits his speech on the philosophic path to his teacher, the priestess [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]], who is not even sure if Socrates is capable of reaching the highest mysteries.) In the ''Meno'', he refers to the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], telling Meno he would understand Socrates's answers better if only he could stay for the initiations next week. Further confusions result from the nature of these sources, insofar as the Platonic Dialogues are arguably the work of an artist-philosopher, whose meaning does not volunteer itself to the passive reader nor again the lifelong scholar. According to [[Olympiodorus the Younger]] in his ''Life of Plato'',<ref>Olympiodorus the Younger, ''Life of Plato'', in ''The Works of Plato: A New and Literal Version Chiefly from the Text of Stallbaum'', p. 234, Bohm, 1854.</ref> Plato himself \"received instruction from the writers of tragedy\" before taking up the study of philosophy. His works are, indeed, dialogues; Plato's choice of this, the medium of Sophocles, Euripides, and the fictions of theatre, may reflect the ever-interpretable nature of his writings, as he has been called a \"dramatist of reason\". What is more, the first word of nearly all Plato's works is a significant term for that respective dialogue, and is used with its many connotations in mind. Finally, the ''Phaedrus'' and the ''Symposium'' each allude to Socrates's coy delivery of philosophic truths in conversation; the Socrates of the ''Phaedrus'' goes so far as to demand such dissembling and mystery in all writing. The covertness we often find in Plato, appearing here and there couched in some enigmatic use of symbol and/or irony, may be at odds with the mysticism Plato's Socrates expounds in some other dialogues. These indirect methods may fail to satisfy some readers.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting facet of this is Socrates's reliance on what the Greeks called his \"[[Daemon (classical mythology)#Socrates|daim\u014dnic]] sign\", an averting (\u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ''apotreptikos'') inner voice Socrates heard only when he was about to make a mistake. It was this ''sign'' that prevented Socrates from entering into politics. In the ''Phaedrus'', we are told Socrates considered this to be a form of \"divine madness\", the sort of [[insanity]] that is a gift from the gods and gives us [[poetry]], [[mysticism]], [[love]], and even [[philosophy]] itself. Alternately, the ''sign'' is often taken to be what we would call \"intuition\"; however, Socrates's characterization of the phenomenon as ''daim\u014dnic'' may suggest that its origin is divine, mysterious, and independent of his own thoughts.\n\nSocrates practiced and advocated [[Greek divination|divination]].<ref name=\"J.

Mikalson\" />\n\n== Satirical playwrights ==\n\nHe was prominently lampooned in [[Aristophanes]]'s [[comedy]] ''[[The Clouds]]'', produced when Socrates was in his mid-forties; he said at his trial (according to Plato) that the laughter of the [[theatre]] was a harder task to answer than the arguments of his accusers. [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] believed this play was a more accurate representation of Socrates than those of his students. In the play, Socrates is ridiculed for his dirtiness, which is associated with the [[Laconophile|Laconizing]] fad; also in plays by [[Callias (Comic Poet)|Callias]], [[Eupolis]], and [[Telecleides]]. Other comic poets who lampooned Socrates include [[Mnesimachus]] and [[Ameipsias]]. In all of these, Socrates and the [[Sophist]]s were criticized for \"the moral dangers inherent in contemporary thought and literature\".\n\n== Prose sources ==\nPlato, Xenophon, and Aristotle are the main sources for the historical Socrates; however, Xenophon and Plato were students of Socrates, and they may idealize him; however, they wrote the only extended descriptions of Socrates that have come down to us in their complete form. Aristotle refers frequently, but in passing, to Socrates in his writings. Almost all of Plato's works center on Socrates. However, Plato's later works appear to be more his own philosophy put into the mouth of his mentor.\n\n=== The Socratic dialogues ===\n{{Main|Socratic dialogue}}\n[[File:Socrates Botanic Gardens 1.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Socrates in the [[Irish National Botanic Gardens]]]]\nThe ''Socratic Dialogues'' are a series of [[dialogue]]s written by Plato and Xenophon in the form of discussions between Socrates and other persons of his time, or as discussions between Socrates's followers over his concepts. Plato's ''[[Phaedo]]'' is an example of this latter category. Although his ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'' is a monologue delivered by Socrates, it is usually grouped with the Dialogues.\n\nThe ''Apology'' professes to be a record of the actual speech Socrates delivered in his own defence at the trial. In the Athenian jury system, an \"apology\" is composed of three parts: a speech, followed by a counter-assessment, then some final words. \"Apology\" is an anglicized [[transliteration]], not a [[translation]], of the Greek ''apologia'', meaning \"defense\"; in this sense it is not apologetic according to our contemporary use of the term.\n\nPlato generally does not place his own ideas in the mouth of a specific speaker; he lets ideas emerge via the [[Socratic Method]], under the guidance of Socrates. Most of the dialogues present Socrates applying this method to some extent, but nowhere as completely as in the ''[[Euthyphro]]''. In this dialogue, Socrates and [[Euthyphro (prophet)|Euthyphro]] go through several iterations of refining the answer to Socrates's question, \"...What is the pious, and what the impious?\"\n\nIn Plato's Dialogues, learning appears as a process of remembering. The [[soul]], before its incarnation in the body, was in the realm of [[Idea]]s (very similar to the Platonic \"Forms\"). There, it saw things the way they truly are, rather than the pale shadows or copies we experience on earth. By a process of questioning, the soul can be brought to remember the ideas in their pure form, thus bringing [[wisdom]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Khan |first=C.H. |title=Plato and the Socratic Dialogue: The Philosophical Use of a Literary Form |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998}}</ref>\n\nEspecially for Plato's writings referring to Socrates, it is not always clear which ideas brought forward by Socrates (or his friends) actually belonged to Socrates and which of these may have been new additions or elaborations by Plato\u2014this is known as the [[Socratic Problem]]. Generally, the early works of Plato are considered to be close to the spirit of Socrates, whereas the later works\u2014including ''[[Phaedo]]'' and ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''\u2014are considered to be possibly products of Plato's elaborations.<ref>{{cite book |last=Morrison |first=D.R. |title=The Cambridge Companion to Socrates |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |chapter=1}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n=== Immediate influence ===\n\n{{See also|Cyrenaics}}\nImmediately, the students of Socrates set to work both on exercising their perceptions of his teachings in politics and also on developing many new philosophical schools of thought. Some of Athens' controversial and anti-democratic [[tyrant]]s were contemporary or posthumous students of Socrates including [[Alcibiades]] and [[Critias]]. Critias's cousin Plato would go on to found the [[Academy]] in 385&nbsp;BC, which gained so much renown that \"Academy\" became the standard word for educational institutions in later European languages such as English, French, and Italian.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ahbel-Rappe |first=S. |last2=Kamtekar |first2=R. |title=A Companion to Socrates |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2009 |pages=306\u201309}}</ref> Plato's [[prot\u00e9g\u00e9]], another important figure of the Classical era, [[Aristotle]] went on to tutor [[Alexander the Great]] and also to found his own school in 335&nbsp;BC\u2014the [[Lyceum]]\u2014whose name also now means an educational institution.<ref>{{cite book |last=Magee |first=B |title=The Great Philosophers: An Introduction to Western Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |page=34}}</ref>\n\nWhile \"Socrates dealt with moral matters and took no notice at all of nature in general\",<ref>{{cite book |last=Carruccio |first=E. |title=Mathematics And Logic in History And in Contemporary Thought |publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2006 |page=44}}</ref> in his Dialogues, Plato would emphasize mathematics with metaphysical overtones mirroring that of [[Pythagoras]]\u2014the former who would dominate Western thought well into the [[Renaissance]]. Aristotle himself was as much of a philosopher as he was a scientist with extensive work in the fields of [[biology]] and [[physics]].\n\nSocratic thought which challenged conventions, especially in stressing a simplistic way of living, became divorced from Plato's more detached and philosophical pursuits. This idea was inherited by one of Socrates's older students, [[Antisthenes]], who became the originator of another philosophy in the years after Socrates's death: [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]].\n\nThe idea of [[asceticism]] being hand in hand with an ethical life or one with piety, ignored by Plato and Aristotle and somewhat dealt with by the Cynics, formed the core of another philosophy in 281&nbsp;BC\u2014[[Stoicism]] when [[Zeno of Citium]] would discover Socrates's works and then learn from [[Crates of Thebes|Crates]], a Cynic philosopher.<ref>{{cite book |last=Long |first=A.A. |title=Stoic Studies |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |pages=31\u201332}}</ref>\n\n=== Later historical influence ===\n[[File:Sughrat.jpg|right|thumb|Depiction of Socrates by 13th century [[Sultanate of Rum|Seljuk]] illustrator ]]\n\nWhile some of the later contributions of Socrates to [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic Era]] culture and philosophy as well as the [[Roman Era]] have been lost to time, his teachings began a resurgence in both [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] and the [[Muslim history#Early Caliphate|Islamic Middle East]] alongside those of Aristotle and Stoicism.

There were a number of paintings about his life including ''Socrates Tears Alcibiades from the Embrace of Sensual Pleasure'' by [[Jean-Baptiste Regnault]] and ''The Death of Socrates'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]] in the later 18th century.\n\nTo this day, different versions of the [[Socratic method]] are still used in classroom and law school discourse to expose underlying issues in both subject and the speaker. He has been recognized with accolades ranging from frequent mentions in pop culture (such as the movie ''[[Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'' and a Greek rock band called [[Socrates Drank the Conium]]) to numerous busts in academic institutions in recognition of his contribution to education.\n\nOver the past century, numerous plays about Socrates have also focused on Socrates's life and influence. One of the most recent has been ''[[Socrates on Trial]]'', a play based on Aristophanes's ''Clouds'' and Plato's ''Apology'', ''Crito'', and ''Phaedo'', all adapted for modern performance.\n\n=== Criticism ===\nEvaluation of and reaction to Socrates has been undertaken by both historians and philosophers from the time of his death to the present day with a multitude of conclusions and perspectives. Although he was not directly prosecuted for his connection to Critias, leader of the Spartan-backed [[Thirty Tyrants]], and \"showed considerable personal courage in refusing to submit to [them]\", he was seen by some as a figure who mentored oligarchs who became abusive tyrants, and undermined Athenian democracy. The Sophistic movement that he railed at in life survived him, but by the 3rd century BC, was rapidly overtaken by the many philosophical schools of thought that Socrates influenced.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=E.R. |title=The Death of Socrates: Hero, Villain, Chatterbox, Saint |publisher=Profile Books |year=2007 |pages=61\u201362}}</ref>\n\nSocrates's death is considered iconic, and his status as a martyr of philosophy overshadows most contemporary and posthumous criticism. However, Xenophon mentions Socrates's \"arrogance\" and that he was \"an expert in the art of pimping\" or \"self-presentation\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Danzig |first=G. |title=Apologizing for Socrates: How Plato and Xenophon Created Our Socrates |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2010 |pages=66\u201367}}</ref> Direct criticism of Socrates the man almost disappears after this time, but there is a noticeable preference for Plato or Aristotle over the elements of Socratic philosophy distinct from those of his students, even into the Middle Ages.\n\nSome modern scholarship holds that, with so much of his own thought obscured and possibly altered by Plato, it is impossible to gain a clear picture of Socrates amid all the contradictory evidence. That both [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]] and [[Stoicism]], which carried heavy influence from Socratic thought, were unlike or even contrary to [[Platonism]] further illustrates this. The ambiguity and lack of reliability serves as the modern basis of criticism\u2014that it is nearly impossible to know the real Socrates.

It is unlikely Plato was the first in this field (Vlastos, p. 52).</ref>\n\nAs for discovering the real-life Socrates, the difficulty is that ancient sources are mostly philosophical or dramatic texts, apart from Xenophon. There are no straightforward histories, contemporary with Socrates, that dealt with his own time and place. A corollary of this is that sources that do mention Socrates do not necessarily claim to be historically accurate, and are often partisan. For instance, those who prosecuted and convicted Socrates have left no testament. Historians, therefore, face the challenge of reconciling the various evidence from the extant texts in order to attempt an accurate and consistent account of Socrates's life and work. The result of such an effort is not necessarily realistic, even if consistent.\n\nTwo factors emerge from all sources pertaining to the character of Socrates: that he was ugly (at least as an older man), and had a brilliant intellect.<ref name=\"D.R.

Also, Xenophon, being a historian, is a more reliable witness to the historical Socrates. It is a matter of much debate over which Socrates it is who Plato is describing at any given point\u2014the historical figure, or Plato's fictionalization. As British philosopher [[Martin Cohen (philosopher)|Martin Cohen]] has put it, \"Plato, the idealist, offers an idol, a master figure, for philosophy.

Also, in Plato's ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'' and ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', as well as in Xenophon's accounts, Socrates explicitly denies accepting payment for teaching.

Frantic violence, became the attribute of manliness; cautious plotting, a justifiable means of self-defense. The advocate of extreme measures was always trustworthy; his opponent a man to be suspected.\"</ref> He praised Sparta, archrival to Athens, directly and indirectly in various dialogues. One of Socrates' purported offences to the city was his position as a social and moral critic. Rather than upholding a status quo and accepting the development of what he perceived as immorality within his region, Socrates questioned the collective notion of \"might makes right\" that he felt was common in Greece during this period. Plato refers to Socrates as the \"[[Social gadfly|gadfly]]\" of the state (as the gadfly stings the horse into action, so Socrates stung various Athenians), insofar as he irritated some people with considerations of justice and the pursuit of goodness.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book |last=Waterfield |first=Robin |title=Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths |location=New York |publisher=W.W. Norton and Company |year=2009}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Plato's ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'', Socrates's life as the \"gadfly\" of Athens began when his friend Chaerephon asked the [[Pythia|Oracle at Delphi]] if anyone were wiser than Socrates; the Oracle responded that no one was wiser. Socrates believed the Oracle's response was not correct, because he believed he possessed no wisdom whatsoever. He proceeded to test the riddle by approaching men considered wise by the people of Athens\u2014statesmen, poets, and artisans\u2014in order to refute the Oracle's pronouncement. Questioning them, however, Socrates concluded: while each man thought he knew a great deal and was wise, in fact, they knew very little and were not wise at all. So Socrates interpreted the meaning of the Oracle thus: while so-called wise men thought themselves wise and yet were not, he himself knew he was not wise at all, which, paradoxically, made him the wiser one since he was the only person aware of his own ignorance. Socrates's paradoxical wisdom made the prominent Athenians he publicly questioned look foolish, turning them against him and leading to accusations of wrongdoing. Socrates defended his role as a gadfly until the end: at his trial when Socrates was asked to propose his own punishment, he suggested a wage paid by the government and free dinners for the rest of his life instead, to finance the time he spent as Athens's benefactor.<ref>Brun (1978).</ref>\n\n[[Robin Waterfield]] suggests that Socrates was a voluntary scapegoat; his death was the purifying remedy for Athens's misfortunes. In this view, the token of appreciation for [[Asclepius]] (the Greek god for curing illness) \u2013 the cockerel that he speaks of to [[Crito]] \u2013 would represent a cure for Athens's ailments.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> However, because a cockerel was a common thanks-offering and of no great value, this interpretation has been disputed; Socrates may only have been asking Crito to remember to fulfill a vow taken for the sake of an (unnamed) friend who had recovered from illness.\n\n==== Trial ====\n{{Main|Trial of Socrates}}\nIn 399&nbsp;BC, Socrates went on trial<ref>[[Myles Burnyeat|M.F.

It was first described by Plato in the ''Socratic Dialogues''. To solve a problem, it would be broken down into a series of questions, the answers to which gradually distill the answer a person would seek. The development and practice of this method is one of Socrates's most enduring contributions, and is a key factor in earning his mantle as the father of [[political philosophy]], [[ethics]] or moral philosophy, and as a figurehead of all the central themes in [[Western philosophy]]. The [[Socratic method]] has often been considered as a defining element of American legal education.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/nebklr78&div=12&id=&page= |title=The Decline of the Socratic Method at Harvard 78 Nebraska Law Review 1999 |website=heinonline.org|access-date=26 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020025451/http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals%2Fnebklr78&div=12&id=&page=|archive-date=20 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nTo illustrate the use of the Socratic method, a series of [[question]]s are posed to help a person or group to determine their underlying [[belief]]s and the extent of their knowledge. The Socratic method is a ''negative'' method of [[hypothesis]] elimination, in that better hypotheses are found by steadily identifying and eliminating those that lead to [[contradiction]]s. It was designed to force one to examine one's own beliefs and the validity of such beliefs.\n\nAn alternative interpretation of the dialectic is that it is a method for direct perception of the Form of the Good. Philosopher [[Karl Popper]] describes the dialectic as \"the art of intellectual intuition, of visualising the divine originals, the Forms or Ideas, of unveiling the Great Mystery behind the common man's everyday world of appearances.\"<ref>Popper, K. (1962) The Open Society and its Enemies, Volume 1 Plato, London, Routledge & Kegan Paul, p133.</ref> In a similar vein, French philosopher [[Pierre Hadot]] suggests that the dialogues are a type of spiritual exercise. Hadot writes that \"in Plato's view, every dialectical exercise, precisely because it is an exercise of pure thought, subject to the demands of the [[Logos]], turns the soul away from the sensible world, and allows it to convert itself towards the Good.\"<ref>Hadot, P. (1995) Philosophy as a Way of Life, Oxford, Blackwells, p. 93.</ref>\n\n=== Beliefs ===\nThe beliefs of Socrates, as distinct from those of Plato, are difficult to discern. Little in the way of concrete evidence exists to demarcate the two. The lengthy presentation of ideas given in most of the dialogues may be the ideas of Socrates himself, but which have been subsequently deformed or changed by Plato, and some scholars think Plato so adapted the Socratic style as to make the literary character and the philosopher himself impossible to distinguish. Others argue that he did have his own theories and beliefs.<ref name=\"Cohn2001\">{{cite journal |last1=Cohn |first1=Dorrit |title=Does Socrates Speak for Plato?

Consequently, distinguishing the philosophical beliefs of Socrates from those of Plato and Xenophon has not proven easy, so it must be remembered that what is attributed to Socrates might actually be more the specific concerns of these two thinkers instead.\n\nThe matter is complicated because the historical Socrates seems to have been notorious for asking questions but not answering, claiming to lack wisdom concerning the subjects about which he questioned others.<ref>Plato, ''Republic'' 336c and 337a, ''Theaetetus'' 150c, ''Apology'' 23a; Xenophon, ''Memorabilia'' 4.4.9; Aristotle, ''Sophistical Refutations'' 183b7.</ref>\n\nIf anything in general can be said about the philosophical beliefs of Socrates, it is that he was morally, intellectually, and politically at odds with many of his fellow Athenians. When he is on trial for heresy and corrupting the minds of the youth of Athens, he uses his method of ''elenchos'' to demonstrate to the jurors that their moral values are wrong-headed. He tells them they are concerned with their families, careers, and political responsibilities when they ought to be worried about the \"welfare of their souls\". Socrates's assertion that the gods had singled him out as a divine emissary seemed to provoke irritation, if not outright ridicule. Socrates also questioned the Sophistic doctrine that arete (virtue) can be taught. He liked to observe that successful fathers (such as the prominent military general [[Pericles]]) did not produce sons of their own quality. Socrates argued that moral excellence was more a matter of divine bequest than parental nurture. This belief may have contributed to his lack of anxiety about the future of his own sons.\n\nAlso, according to A. A. Long, \"There should be no doubt that, despite his claim to know only that he knew nothing, Socrates had strong beliefs about the divine\", and, citing Xenophon's ''Memorabilia'', 1.4, 4.3,:\n<blockquote> According to Xenophon, he was a [[Teleology|teleologist]] who held that god arranges everything for the best.<ref>Long, AA., in {{cite book |last=Ahbel-Rappe |first=S. |last2=Kamtekar |first2=R. |title=A Companion to Socrates |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2009 |page=59 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WwpZVuylPgYC&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=companion+socrates+teleologist#v=onepage&q=companion%20socrates%20teleologist&f=false |isbn=978-1-4051-9260-6}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nSocrates frequently says his ideas are not his own, but his teachers'. He mentions several influences: [[Prodicus]] the [[rhetor]] and [[Anaxagoras]] the philosopher. Perhaps surprisingly, Socrates claims to have been deeply influenced by two women besides his mother: he says that [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]] (cf. Plato's ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]''), a witch and priestess from [[Mantinea]], taught him all he knows about ''[[eros (love)|eros]]'', or [[love]]; and that [[Aspasia]], the mistress of [[Pericles]], taught him the art of rhetoric.<ref>Plato, ''Menexenus 235e''</ref> [[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]] argued that his principal teacher was the Anaxagorean [[Archelaus (philosopher)|Archelaus]] but his ideas were as Plato described them; [[Eric A. Havelock]], on the other hand, did not accept the view that Socrates's view was identical with that of Archelaus, in large part due to the reason of such anomalies ''and'' contradictions that have surfaced and \"post-dated his death.\"{{clarify|date=May 2019|reason=What does \"post-dated his death\" mean here?

On the one hand, he drew a clear line between human ignorance and ideal knowledge; on the other, Plato's ''Symposium'' (Diotima's Speech) and ''Republic'' (Allegory of the Cave) describe a method for ascending to wisdom.\n\nIn Plato's ''Theaetetus'' (150a), Socrates compares his treatment of the young people who come to him for philosophical advice to the way midwives treat their patients, and the way matrimonial matchmakers act. He says that he himself is a true matchmaker (\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ''promnestik\u00f3s'') in that he matches the young man to the best philosopher for his particular mind. However, he carefully distinguishes himself from a [[panderer]] (\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u1fb0\u03b3\u03c9\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 ''proagogos'') or procurer. This distinction is echoed in Xenophon's ''Symposium'' (3.20), when Socrates jokes about his certainty of being able to make a fortune, if he chose to practice the art of pandering. For his part as a philosophical interlocutor, he leads his respondent to a clearer conception of wisdom, although he claims he is not himself a teacher (''Apology''). His role, he claims, is more properly to be understood as analogous to a ''[[midwife]]'' (\u03bc\u03b1\u1fd6\u03b1 ''maia'').<ref>Boys-Stones, G., Rowe, C., [https://books.google.com/books?id=ec9NAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA173&dq=Theaetetus+Socrates+matchmaker&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7KY8VbqiBMbbate_gAg&ved=0CDMQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=Theaetetus%20Socrates%20matchmaker&f=false The Circle of Socrates: Readings in the First-Generation Socratics], Hackett Publishing, 2013, pp. 173\u201375.</ref><ref>Vander Waerdt, PA., [https://books.google.com/books?id=Etrz2pkeZvwC&pg=PA201&dq=Theaetetus+Socrates+matchmaker&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7KY8VbqiBMbbate_gAg&ved=0CDoQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=Theaetetus%20Socrates%20matchmaker&f=false The Socratic Movement], Cornell University Press, 1994, pp. 200\u201302.</ref>\n\nIn the ''Theaetetus'', Socrates explains that he is himself barren of theories, but knows how to bring the theories of others to birth and determine whether they are worthy or mere \"[[cock egg|wind eggs]]\" (\u1f00\u03bd\u03b5\u03bc\u03b9\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd ''anemiaion''). Perhaps significantly, he points out that midwives are barren due to age, and women who have never given birth are unable to become midwives; they would have no experience or knowledge of birth and would be unable to separate the worthy infants from those that should be left on the hillside to be exposed. To judge this, the midwife must have experience and knowledge of what she is judging.<ref>Plato, [https://books.google.com/books?id=g74pOFTqwcYC&dq=Theaetetus+Socrates+wind+egg&q=%22barren+midwife%22#v=snippet&q=%22barren%20midwife%22&f=false ''Theaetetus''].</ref><ref>Guthrie, WKC., [https://books.google.com/books?id=a-h35nyFR7IC&dq=socrates+midwives&q=%22other+midwives%22#v=onepage&q=%22wind-egg%22&f=false Socrates], Cambridge University Press, 1971, p. 126.</ref>\n\n=== Virtue ===\n[[File:Palermsoc.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.7|Bust of Socrates in the Palermo Archaeological Museum]]\nSocrates believed the best way for people to live was to focus on the pursuit of virtue rather than the pursuit, for instance, of material wealth.<ref>{{cite book |last=Brickhouse |first=TC. |last2=Smith |first2=N.D. |title=Socrates on Trial |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1990 |page=165}}</ref> He always invited others to try to concentrate more on friendships and a sense of true community, for Socrates felt this was the best way for people to grow together as a populace.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nichols |first=M.P. |title=Socrates and the Political Community: An Ancient Debate |publisher=SUNY Press |year=1987 |page=67}}</ref> His actions lived up to this standard: in the end, Socrates accepted his death sentence when most thought he would simply leave Athens, as he felt he could not run away from or go against the will of his community; as mentioned above, his reputation for valor on the battlefield was without reproach.\n\nThe idea that there are certain virtues formed a common thread in Socrates's teachings. These virtues represented the most important qualities for a person to have, foremost of which were the philosophical or intellectual virtues. Socrates stressed that \"[[the unexamined life is not worth living]] [and] ethical virtue is the only thing that matters.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Duignan |first=B. |title=The 100 Most Influential Philosophers of All Time |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |year=2009 |page=33}}</ref>\n\n=== Politics ===\nIt is argued that Socrates believed \"ideals belong in a world only the wise man can understand\",<ref>Attributed to \"Solomon\" in {{cite book |title=100 Most Influential People of All Times for Smartphones and Mobile Devices |publisher=Mobile Reference |year=2007}}</ref> making the philosopher the only type of person suitable to govern others. In Plato's dialogue the ''Republic'', Socrates openly objected to the [[democracy]] that ran Athens during his adult life. It was not only Athenian democracy: Socrates found short of ideal any government that did not conform to his presentation of a perfect regime led by philosophers, and Athenian government was far from that. It is, however, possible that the Socrates of Plato's ''Republic'' is colored by Plato's own views. During the last years of Socrates's life, Athens was in continual flux due to political upheaval. Democracy was at last overthrown by a [[Military dictatorship|junta]] known as the [[Thirty Tyrants]], led by Plato's relative, [[Critias]], who had once been a student and friend of Socrates. The Tyrants ruled for about a year before the Athenian democracy was reinstated, at which point it declared an [[amnesty]] for all recent events.\n\nSocrates's opposition to democracy is often denied, and the question is one of the biggest philosophical debates when trying to determine exactly what Socrates believed. The strongest argument of those who claim Socrates did not actually believe in the idea of philosopher kings is that the view is expressed no earlier than Plato's ''Republic'', which is widely considered one of Plato's \"Middle\" dialogues and not representative of the historical Socrates's views. Furthermore, according to Plato's ''Apology of Socrates'', an \"early\" dialogue, Socrates refused to pursue conventional politics; he often stated he could not look into other's matters or tell people how to live their lives when he did not yet understand how to live his own. He believed he was a philosopher engaged in the pursuit of Truth, and did not claim to know it fully. Socrates's acceptance of his death sentence after his conviction can also be seen to support this view. It is often claimed much of the anti-democratic leanings are from Plato, who was never able to overcome his disgust at what was done to his teacher. In any case, it is clear Socrates thought the rule of the Thirty Tyrants was also objectionable; when called before them to assist in the arrest of a fellow Athenian, Socrates refused and narrowly escaped death before the Tyrants were overthrown. He did, however, fulfill his duty to serve as ''[[Prytanis]]'' when a trial of a group of Generals who presided over a disastrous naval campaign were judged; even then, he maintained an uncompromizing attitude, being one of those who refused to proceed in a manner not supported by the laws, despite intense pressure.<ref>Kagen (1978).</ref> Judging by his actions, he considered the rule of the Thirty Tyrants less legitimate than the Democratic Senate that sentenced him to death.\n\nSocrates's apparent respect for democracy is one of the themes emphasized in the 2008 play ''[[Socrates on Trial (play)|Socrates on Trial]]'' by [[Andrew David Irvine]]. Irvine argues that it was because of his loyalty to Athenian democracy that Socrates was willing to accept the verdict of his fellow citizens. As Irvine puts it, \"During a time of war and great social and intellectual upheaval, Socrates felt compelled to express his views openly, regardless of the consequences. As a result, he is remembered today, not only for his sharp wit and high ethical standards, but also for his loyalty to the view that in a democracy the best way for a man to serve himself, his friends, and his city\u2014even during times of war\u2014is by being loyal to, and by speaking publicly about, the truth.\"<ref>Irvine, Andrew D. \"Introduction,\" ''Socrates on Trial,'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2008, p. 19.</ref>\n\n=== Covertness ===\nIn the Dialogues of Plato, though Socrates sometimes seems to support a [[mystical]] side, discussing [[reincarnation]] and the [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religions]], this is generally attributed to Plato.<ref>{{cite book |last=McPherran |first=M.L. |title=The Religion of Socrates |publisher=Penn State Press |year=1998 |page=268}}</ref> Regardless, this view of Socrates cannot be dismissed out of hand, as we cannot be sure of the differences between the views of Plato and Socrates; in addition, there seem to be some corollaries in the works of Xenophon. In the culmination of the philosophic path as discussed in Plato's ''Symposium'', one comes to the [[Sea of Beauty]] or to the sight of \"the beautiful itself\" (211C); only then can one become wise. (In the ''Symposium'', Socrates credits his speech on the philosophic path to his teacher, the priestess [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]], who is not even sure if Socrates is capable of reaching the highest mysteries.) In the ''Meno'', he refers to the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], telling Meno he would understand Socrates's answers better if only he could stay for the initiations next week. Further confusions result from the nature of these sources, insofar as the Platonic Dialogues are arguably the work of an artist-philosopher, whose meaning does not volunteer itself to the passive reader nor again the lifelong scholar. According to [[Olympiodorus the Younger]] in his ''Life of Plato'',<ref>Olympiodorus the Younger, ''Life of Plato'', in ''The Works of Plato: A New and Literal Version Chiefly from the Text of Stallbaum'', p. 234, Bohm, 1854.</ref> Plato himself \"received instruction from the writers of tragedy\" before taking up the study of philosophy. His works are, indeed, dialogues; Plato's choice of this, the medium of Sophocles, Euripides, and the fictions of theatre, may reflect the ever-interpretable nature of his writings, as he has been called a \"dramatist of reason\". What is more, the first word of nearly all Plato's works is a significant term for that respective dialogue, and is used with its many connotations in mind. Finally, the ''Phaedrus'' and the ''Symposium'' each allude to Socrates's coy delivery of philosophic truths in conversation; the Socrates of the ''Phaedrus'' goes so far as to demand such dissembling and mystery in all writing. The covertness we often find in Plato, appearing here and there couched in some enigmatic use of symbol and/or irony, may be at odds with the mysticism Plato's Socrates expounds in some other dialogues. These indirect methods may fail to satisfy some readers.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting facet of this is Socrates's reliance on what the Greeks called his \"[[Daemon (classical mythology)#Socrates|daim\u014dnic]] sign\", an averting (\u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ''apotreptikos'') inner voice Socrates heard only when he was about to make a mistake. It was this ''sign'' that prevented Socrates from entering into politics. In the ''Phaedrus'', we are told Socrates considered this to be a form of \"divine madness\", the sort of [[insanity]] that is a gift from the gods and gives us [[poetry]], [[mysticism]], [[love]], and even [[philosophy]] itself. Alternately, the ''sign'' is often taken to be what we would call \"intuition\"; however, Socrates's characterization of the phenomenon as ''daim\u014dnic'' may suggest that its origin is divine, mysterious, and independent of his own thoughts.\n\nSocrates practiced and advocated [[Greek divination|divination]].<ref name=\"J. Mikalson\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VsSDBu3pG4gC&pg=PP123 |author=J.

Mikalson\" />\n\n== Satirical playwrights ==\n\nHe was prominently lampooned in [[Aristophanes]]'s [[comedy]] ''[[The Clouds]]'', produced when Socrates was in his mid-forties; he said at his trial (according to Plato) that the laughter of the [[theatre]] was a harder task to answer than the arguments of his accusers. [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] believed this play was a more accurate representation of Socrates than those of his students. In the play, Socrates is ridiculed for his dirtiness, which is associated with the [[Laconophile|Laconizing]] fad; also in plays by [[Callias (Comic Poet)|Callias]], [[Eupolis]], and [[Telecleides]]. Other comic poets who lampooned Socrates include [[Mnesimachus]] and [[Ameipsias]]. In all of these, Socrates and the [[Sophist]]s were criticized for \"the moral dangers inherent in contemporary thought and literature\".\n\n== Prose sources ==\nPlato, Xenophon, and Aristotle are the main sources for the historical Socrates; however, Xenophon and Plato were students of Socrates, and they may idealize him; however, they wrote the only extended descriptions of Socrates that have come down to us in their complete form. Aristotle refers frequently, but in passing, to Socrates in his writings. Almost all of Plato's works center on Socrates. However, Plato's later works appear to be more his own philosophy put into the mouth of his mentor.\n\n=== The Socratic dialogues ===\n{{Main|Socratic dialogue}}\n[[File:Socrates Botanic Gardens 1.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Socrates in the [[Irish National Botanic Gardens]]]]\nThe ''Socratic Dialogues'' are a series of [[dialogue]]s written by Plato and Xenophon in the form of discussions between Socrates and other persons of his time, or as discussions between Socrates's followers over his concepts. Plato's ''[[Phaedo]]'' is an example of this latter category. Although his ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'' is a monologue delivered by Socrates, it is usually grouped with the Dialogues.\n\nThe ''Apology'' professes to be a record of the actual speech Socrates delivered in his own defence at the trial. In the Athenian jury system, an \"apology\" is composed of three parts: a speech, followed by a counter-assessment, then some final words. \"Apology\" is an anglicized [[transliteration]], not a [[translation]], of the Greek ''apologia'', meaning \"defense\"; in this sense it is not apologetic according to our contemporary use of the term.\n\nPlato generally does not place his own ideas in the mouth of a specific speaker; he lets ideas emerge via the [[Socratic Method]], under the guidance of Socrates. Most of the dialogues present Socrates applying this method to some extent, but nowhere as completely as in the ''[[Euthyphro]]''. In this dialogue, Socrates and [[Euthyphro (prophet)|Euthyphro]] go through several iterations of refining the answer to Socrates's question, \"...What is the pious, and what the impious?\"\n\nIn Plato's Dialogues, learning appears as a process of remembering. The [[soul]], before its incarnation in the body, was in the realm of [[Idea]]s (very similar to the Platonic \"Forms\"). There, it saw things the way they truly are, rather than the pale shadows or copies we experience on earth. By a process of questioning, the soul can be brought to remember the ideas in their pure form, thus bringing [[wisdom]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Khan |first=C.H. |title=Plato and the Socratic Dialogue: The Philosophical Use of a Literary Form |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998}}</ref>\n\nEspecially for Plato's writings referring to Socrates, it is not always clear which ideas brought forward by Socrates (or his friends) actually belonged to Socrates and which of these may have been new additions or elaborations by Plato\u2014this is known as the [[Socratic Problem]]. Generally, the early works of Plato are considered to be close to the spirit of Socrates, whereas the later works\u2014including ''[[Phaedo]]'' and ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''\u2014are considered to be possibly products of Plato's elaborations.<ref>{{cite book |last=Morrison |first=D.R. |title=The Cambridge Companion to Socrates |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |chapter=1}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n=== Immediate influence ===\n\n{{See also|Cyrenaics}}\nImmediately, the students of Socrates set to work both on exercising their perceptions of his teachings in politics and also on developing many new philosophical schools of thought. Some of Athens' controversial and anti-democratic [[tyrant]]s were contemporary or posthumous students of Socrates including [[Alcibiades]] and [[Critias]]. Critias's cousin Plato would go on to found the [[Academy]] in 385&nbsp;BC, which gained so much renown that \"Academy\" became the standard word for educational institutions in later European languages such as English, French, and Italian.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ahbel-Rappe |first=S. |last2=Kamtekar |first2=R. |title=A Companion to Socrates |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2009 |pages=306\u201309}}</ref> Plato's [[prot\u00e9g\u00e9]], another important figure of the Classical era, [[Aristotle]] went on to tutor [[Alexander the Great]] and also to found his own school in 335&nbsp;BC\u2014the [[Lyceum]]\u2014whose name also now means an educational institution.<ref>{{cite book |last=Magee |first=B |title=The Great Philosophers: An Introduction to Western Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |page=34}}</ref>\n\nWhile \"Socrates dealt with moral matters and took no notice at all of nature in general\",<ref>{{cite book |last=Carruccio |first=E. |title=Mathematics And Logic in History And in Contemporary Thought |publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2006 |page=44}}</ref> in his Dialogues, Plato would emphasize mathematics with metaphysical overtones mirroring that of [[Pythagoras]]\u2014the former who would dominate Western thought well into the [[Renaissance]]. Aristotle himself was as much of a philosopher as he was a scientist with extensive work in the fields of [[biology]] and [[physics]].\n\nSocratic thought which challenged conventions, especially in stressing a simplistic way of living, became divorced from Plato's more detached and philosophical pursuits. This idea was inherited by one of Socrates's older students, [[Antisthenes]], who became the originator of another philosophy in the years after Socrates's death: [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]].\n\nThe idea of [[asceticism]] being hand in hand with an ethical life or one with piety, ignored by Plato and Aristotle and somewhat dealt with by the Cynics, formed the core of another philosophy in 281&nbsp;BC\u2014[[Stoicism]] when [[Zeno of Citium]] would discover Socrates's works and then learn from [[Crates of Thebes|Crates]], a Cynic philosopher.<ref>{{cite book |last=Long |first=A.A. |title=Stoic Studies |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |pages=31\u201332}}</ref>\n\n=== Later historical influence ===\n[[File:Sughrat.jpg|right|thumb|Depiction of Socrates by 13th century [[Sultanate of Rum|Seljuk]] illustrator ]]\n\nWhile some of the later contributions of Socrates to [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic Era]] culture and philosophy as well as the [[Roman Era]] have been lost to time, his teachings began a resurgence in both [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] and the [[Muslim history#Early Caliphate|Islamic Middle East]] alongside those of Aristotle and Stoicism. Socrates is mentioned in the dialogue [[Kuzari]] by Jewish philosopher and rabbi [[Yehuda Halevi]] in which a Jew instructs the [[Khazar]] king about Judaism.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hughes |first=Bettany |authorlink=Bettany Hughes |title=The Hemlock Cup: Socrates, Athens and the Search for the Good Life |publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group |year=2011|title-link=The Hemlock Cup: Socrates, Athens and the Search for the Good Life}}</ref> [[Al-Kindi]], a well-known Arabic philosopher, introduced and tried to reconcile Socrates and Hellenistic philosophy to an Islamic audience,<ref>{{cite book |last=von Dehsen |first=C. |title=Philosophers and Religious Leaders |publisher=Routledge |year=2013}}</ref> referring to him by the name 'Suqrat'.\n\nSocrates influence grew in Western Europe during the fourteenth century as Plato's dialogues were made available in Latin by [[Marsilio Ficino]] and Xenophon's Socratic writings were translated by [[Basilios Bessarion]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Ahbel-Rappe |first=S. |last2=Kamtekar |first2=R. |title=A Companion to Socrates |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2009 |pages=xix\u2013xx}}</ref> [[Voltaire]] even went so far as to write a [[Voltaire's Socrates (play)|satirical play]] about the [[trial of Socrates]]. There were a number of paintings about his life including ''Socrates Tears Alcibiades from the Embrace of Sensual Pleasure'' by [[Jean-Baptiste Regnault]] and ''The Death of Socrates'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]] in the later 18th century.\n\nTo this day, different versions of the [[Socratic method]] are still used in classroom and law school discourse to expose underlying issues in both subject and the speaker. He has been recognized with accolades ranging from frequent mentions in pop culture (such as the movie ''[[Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'' and a Greek rock band called [[Socrates Drank the Conium]]) to numerous busts in academic institutions in recognition of his contribution to education.\n\nOver the past century, numerous plays about Socrates have also focused on Socrates's life and influence. One of the most recent has been ''[[Socrates on Trial]]'', a play based on Aristophanes's ''Clouds'' and Plato's ''Apology'', ''Crito'', and ''Phaedo'', all adapted for modern performance.\n\n=== Criticism ===\nEvaluation of and reaction to Socrates has been undertaken by both historians and philosophers from the time of his death to the present day with a multitude of conclusions and perspectives. Although he was not directly prosecuted for his connection to Critias, leader of the Spartan-backed [[Thirty Tyrants]], and \"showed considerable personal courage in refusing to submit to [them]\", he was seen by some as a figure who mentored oligarchs who became abusive tyrants, and undermined Athenian democracy. The Sophistic movement that he railed at in life survived him, but by the 3rd century BC, was rapidly overtaken by the many philosophical schools of thought that Socrates influenced.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=E.R. |title=The Death of Socrates: Hero, Villain, Chatterbox, Saint |publisher=Profile Books |year=2007 |pages=61\u201362}}</ref>\n\nSocrates's death is considered iconic, and his status as a martyr of philosophy overshadows most contemporary and posthumous criticism. However, Xenophon mentions Socrates's \"arrogance\" and that he was \"an expert in the art of pimping\" or \"self-presentation\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Danzig |first=G. |title=Apologizing for Socrates: How Plato and Xenophon Created Our Socrates |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2010 |pages=66\u201367}}</ref> Direct criticism of Socrates the man almost disappears after this time, but there is a noticeable preference for Plato or Aristotle over the elements of Socratic philosophy distinct from those of his students, even into the Middle Ages.\n\nSome modern scholarship holds that, with so much of his own thought obscured and possibly altered by Plato, it is impossible to gain a clear picture of Socrates amid all the contradictory evidence. That both [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]] and [[Stoicism]], which carried heavy influence from Socratic thought, were unlike or even contrary to [[Platonism]] further illustrates this. The ambiguity and lack of reliability serves as the modern basis of criticism\u2014that it is nearly impossible to know the real Socrates. Some controversy also exists about Socrates's attitude towards [[homosexuality]]<ref>[[W. K. C.

Female Sri Lanka junglefowl are very similar to those of the grey junglefowl. Like the green junglefowl, Sri Lankan junglefowl are island species that have evolved side by side with their similarly stranded island predators and competitors. Uniquely complex anti-predator behaviors and foraging strategies are integral components in the long evolutionary story of the Sri Lankan junglefowl.\n\n==Behaviour==\nAs with other jungle fowl, Sri Lankan jungle fowl are primarily terrestrial. They spend most of their time foraging for food by scratching the ground for various [[seed]]s, fallen [[fruit]], and [[insect]]s.\n\nFemales lay two to four [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s in a nest, either on the forest floor in steep hill country or in the abandoned nests of other birds and squirrels. Like the grey and green junglefowl, male Sri Lankan junglefowl play an active role in nest protection and chick rearing.\n\n==Reproduction==\n[[File:Gallus lafayettii MHNT.ZOO.2010.11.9.31.jpg|thumb| ''Gallus lafayettii'' - [[MHNT]]]]\n[[File:Gallus lafayetii.jpg|thumb]]\nThe reproductive strategy of this species is best described as facultative [[polyandry]], in that a single female is typically linked with two or three males that form a pride of sorts. These males are likely to be siblings. The female pairs with the alpha male of the pride and nests high off the ground.\n\nHer eggs are highly variable in colour, but generally are cream with a yellow or pink tint. Purple or brownish spots are common.\n\nOccasionally, a female produces red eggs or blotched eggs.\n\nThe hen incubates her eggs, while the alpha male guards her nest from a nearby perch during the nesting season. The beta males remain in close proximity, and guard the nesting territory from intruders or potential predators, such as rival males, or snakes and mongooses. Sri Lankan junglefowl are unique amongst the junglefowl in the brevity of their incubation, which may be as short as 20 days as contrasted with the 21\u201326 days of the green junglefowl.\n\nThe chicks require a constant diet of live food, usually insects and isopods such as [[sowbug]]s and [[pillbug]]s. In particular, the juveniles of [[land crab]]s are also highly important to the growth and survivability of the juvenile and subadult Sri Lankan junglefowl. In captivity, this species is particularly vulnerable to a poultry disease caused by the bacteria ''[[Salmonella]] pullorum'' and other bacterial diseases common in domestic poultry.\nThe chicks, and to a slightly lesser extent the adults, are incapable of using vegetable-based proteins and fats.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Their dietary requirements cannot be met with commercial processed food materials.
