built-in schedulers==\n\n* [[Cron]]: Unix built in scheduler\n* [[Systemd]] timers: Most modern Linux distributions\n* [[Windows Task Scheduler]]\n\n==Descriptions of the features==\n\n=== Version ===\nThe information in this table is regarding this product version.\n\n=== Company size ===\n* Large : the company has many products\n* Dedicated : the company's job scheduling product is their primary product\n\n=== Script storage ===\n* Some products are only capable of starting a script or executable which is already present on the target system. Eventually some environment variables are set prior to the script run.\n* Some products are able to store scripts in their repository. When the job runs, its script is first transferred to the target system and then executed. This gives the batch job designer a central point of development.\n\n=== Event driven ===\n* Most modern job schedulers are event driven: jobs that run in sequence have no wait time.\n* The opposite is time driven, like Windows' Scheduled tasks or Unix' crontab: a job runs at some time, and the next job is scheduled the expected runtime later plus some spare time.\n\n=== Agents ===\n* An agentless job scheduler makes use of RSH, or more secure, of SSH.\n* An agent is a piece of software that is installed on every host, and is usually continuously connected to the central job scheduler. This causes more functionality to the agents, like a file trigger.\n* A drawback of agents is that they must be upgraded from time to time, which can cause downtime during upgrades.\n\n=== Platforms ===\nAll kinds of Unix flavours mentioned by the vendors are notes as \"Unix\". The same goes for \"Linux\" and \"Windows\" and Mac.\n\n=== Any OS account ===\nCan the agent run a job as any OS-account on the target system? The agent of some products can only run a job as the user the agent runs as, which most likely must have a lot of privileges, which in turn might be a security issue.\n\n=== stdout/err transfer ===\nCan you inspect the standard output and/or standard error of the executed job on your viewer? Some systems even immediately transfer both to the central scheduler, which might give extra network load.\n\n=== File events ===\nCan the job scheduler react (start a job) on the appearance of a file? With this you don't have to poll for the file.\n\n=== File transfer ===\nSome vendors deliver a file transfer utility. The standard command-line FTP on e.g. Unix is not good enough for batch usage: a file might be failed to transfer, yet the 'bye' command went well so the exit status will be ok. The file that may link both the servers will give a proper scheduler procedure in the process.\n\n=== ERP support ===\nThe list of [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] packages supported.\n\n=== SAP XBP version ===\nThe SAP XBP interface comes in 2 versions: 2 and 3. Version 2 has an intercept table, while version 3 has for intercept an include and an exclude table. This is important when you want all SAP-jobs but a few being intercepted and routed through your scheduling system. Some SAP-jobs won't work well when intercepted.\n\n=== Role-based security ===\nIs it possible to grant privileges through roles to the users of your scheduling system? Think of developers, operators and administrators. Some products use LDAP or the Windows system AD.\n\n=== Auditing ===\nSome companies demand recording of all user actions (compliance), but if not it is still handy to backtrace who did some action, just to ask him why he did so.\n\n=== Design lifecycle ===\nDoes the job scheduling system support the transfer of batch designs along development, test, approve and production repositories? Most products have an export- and import-feature, and some products have the transfer mechanism all built-in.\n\n=== User Interfaces ===\nLists what kind of user interfaces are available to access the job Scheduler.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Quartz (scheduler)|Quartz]] - open-source job scheduling service, for Java. It exists also as a port to .NET.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Job scheduling|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=June 2018}}\n\nThis is a list of notable '''job scheduler software'''.

built-in schedulers==\n\n* [[Cron]]: Unix built in scheduler\n* [[Systemd]] timers: Most modern Linux distributions\n* [[Windows Task Scheduler]]\n\n==Descriptions of the features==\n\n=== Version ===\nThe information in this table is regarding this product version.\n\n=== Company size ===\n* Large : the company has many products\n* Dedicated : the company's job scheduling product is their primary product\n\n=== Script storage ===\n* Some products are only capable of starting a script or executable which is already present on the target system. Eventually some environment variables are set prior to the script run.\n* Some products are able to store scripts in their repository. When the job runs, its script is first transferred to the target system and then executed. This gives the batch job designer a central point of development.\n\n=== Event driven ===\n* Most modern job schedulers are event driven: jobs that run in sequence have no wait time.\n* The opposite is time driven, like Windows' Scheduled tasks or Unix' crontab: a job runs at some time, and the next job is scheduled the expected runtime later plus some spare time.\n\n=== Agents ===\n* An agentless job scheduler makes use of RSH, or more secure, of SSH.\n* An agent is a piece of software that is installed on every host, and is usually continuously connected to the central job scheduler. This causes more functionality to the agents, like a file trigger.\n* A drawback of agents is that they must be upgraded from time to time, which can cause downtime during upgrades.\n\n=== Platforms ===\nAll kinds of Unix flavours mentioned by the vendors are notes as \"Unix\". The same goes for \"Linux\" and \"Windows\" and Mac.\n\n=== Any OS account ===\nCan the agent run a job as any OS-account on the target system? The agent of some products can only run a job as the user the agent runs as, which most likely must have a lot of privileges, which in turn might be a security issue.\n\n=== stdout/err transfer ===\nCan you inspect the standard output and/or standard error of the executed job on your viewer? Some systems even immediately transfer both to the central scheduler, which might give extra network load.\n\n=== File events ===\nCan the job scheduler react (start a job) on the appearance of a file? With this you don't have to poll for the file.\n\n=== File transfer ===\nSome vendors deliver a file transfer utility. The standard command-line FTP on e.g. Unix is not good enough for batch usage: a file might be failed to transfer, yet the 'bye' command went well so the exit status will be ok. The file that may link both the servers will give a proper scheduler procedure in the process.\n\n=== ERP support ===\nThe list of [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] packages supported.\n\n=== SAP XBP version ===\nThe SAP XBP interface comes in 2 versions: 2 and 3. Version 2 has an intercept table, while version 3 has for intercept an include and an exclude table. This is important when you want all SAP-jobs but a few being intercepted and routed through your scheduling system. Some SAP-jobs won't work well when intercepted.\n\n=== Role-based security ===\nIs it possible to grant privileges through roles to the users of your scheduling system? Think of developers, operators and administrators. Some products use LDAP or the Windows system AD.\n\n=== Auditing ===\nSome companies demand recording of all user actions (compliance), but if not it is still handy to backtrace who did some action, just to ask him why he did so.\n\n=== Design lifecycle ===\nDoes the job scheduling system support the transfer of batch designs along development, test, approve and production repositories? Most products have an export- and import-feature, and some products have the transfer mechanism all built-in.\n\n=== User Interfaces ===\nLists what kind of user interfaces are available to access the job Scheduler.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Quartz (scheduler)|Quartz]] - open-source job scheduling service, for Java. It exists also as a port to .NET.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Job scheduling|*]]\n", "name_user": "Atgenautomation", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eJob scheduling products with ERP support", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_job_scheduler_software"}

It is familiar to English speakers as the 'th' in ''think''. Though rather rare as a phoneme in the world's inventory of languages, it is encountered in some of the most widespread and influential (see below). The symbol in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] that represents this sound is {{angbr IPA|\u03b8}}, and the equivalent [[X-SAMPA]] symbol is <code>T</code>. The IPA symbol is the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letter [[theta]], which is used for this sound in post-classical [[Greek language|Greek]], and the sound is thus often referred to as \"'''theta'''\".\n\nThe dental non-sibilant fricatives are often called \"[[interdental consonant|interdental]]\" because they are often produced with the tongue between the upper and lower [[teeth]], and not just against the back of the upper or lower teeth, as they are with other [[dental consonant]]s.\n\nThis sound and its [[Voiced dental fricative|voiced counterpart]] are rare phonemes occurring in 4% of languages in a phonological analysis of 2,155 languages.<ref>Phoible.org. (2018). PHOIBLE Online - Segments. [online] Available at: http://phoible.org/parameters.</ref>  Among the more than 60 languages with over 10 million speakers, only [[English language|English]], various [[Varieties of Arabic|dialects of Arabic]], Standard European [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]] (in words derived from Arabic), [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and [[Greek language|Greek]] have the voiceless dental non-sibilant fricative.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}  Speakers of languages and dialects without the sound sometimes have difficulty producing or distinguishing it from similar sounds, especially if they have had no chance to acquire it in childhood, and typically replace it with a [[voiceless alveolar fricative]] ({{IPA|/s/}}) (as in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]), [[voiceless dental stop]] ({{IPA|/t/}}), or a [[voiceless labiodental fricative]] ({{IPA|/f/}}); known respectively as [[th-alveolarization]], [[th-stopping]],<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1982|pp=565\u201366, 635}}</ref> and [[th-fronting]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1982|pp=96\u201397, 328\u201330, 498, 500, 553, 557\u201358, 635}}</ref>\n\nThe sound is known to have disappeared from a number of languages, e.g. from most of the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] languages or dialects, where it is retained only in [[Scots language|Scots]], [[English language|English]], [[Elfdalian]], and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], but it is [[Voiceless alveolar fricative#Voiceless alveolar non-sibilant fricative|alveolar]] in the last of these.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|P\u00e9tursson|1971|p=?}}, cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=145}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|pp=144\u2013145}}</ref> Among non-Germanic [[Indo-European languages]] as a whole, the sound was also once much more widespread, but is today preserved in a few languages including the [[Brythonic languages]], [[Peninsular Spanish]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Venetian language|Venetian]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], few [[Occitan language|Occitan]] dialects and [[Greek language|Greek]].

It is familiar to English speakers as the 'th' in ''think''. Though rather rare as a phoneme in the world's inventory of languages, it is encountered in some of the most widespread and influential (see below). The symbol in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] that represents this sound is {{angbr IPA|\u03b8}}, and the equivalent [[X-SAMPA]] symbol is <code>T</code>. The IPA symbol is the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letter [[theta]], which is used for this sound in post-classical [[Greek language|Greek]], and the sound is thus often referred to as \"'''theta'''\".\n\nThe dental non-sibilant fricatives are often called \"[[interdental consonant|interdental]]\" because they are often produced with the tongue between the upper and lower [[teeth]], and not just against the back of the upper or lower teeth, as they are with other [[dental consonant]]s.\n\nThis sound and its [[Voiced dental fricative|voiced counterpart]] are rare phonemes occurring in 4% of languages in a phonological analysis of 2,155 languages.<ref>Phoible.org. (2018). PHOIBLE Online - Segments. [online] Available at: http://phoible.org/parameters.</ref>  Among the more than 60 languages with over 10 million speakers, only [[English language|English]], various [[Varieties of Arabic|dialects of Arabic]], Standard European [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]] (in words derived from Arabic), [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and [[Greek language|Greek]] have the voiceless dental non-sibilant fricative.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}  Speakers of languages and dialects without the sound sometimes have difficulty producing or distinguishing it from similar sounds, especially if they have had no chance to acquire it in childhood, and typically replace it with a [[voiceless alveolar fricative]] ({{IPA|/s/}}) (as in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]), [[voiceless dental stop]] ({{IPA|/t/}}), or a [[voiceless labiodental fricative]] ({{IPA|/f/}}); known respectively as [[th-alveolarization]], [[th-stopping]],<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1982|pp=565\u201366, 635}}</ref> and [[th-fronting]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1982|pp=96\u201397, 328\u201330, 498, 500, 553, 557\u201358, 635}}</ref>\n\nThe sound is known to have disappeared from a number of languages, e.g. from most of the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] languages or dialects, where it is retained only in [[Scots language|Scots]], [[English language|English]], [[Elfdalian]], and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], but it is [[Voiceless alveolar fricative#Voiceless alveolar non-sibilant fricative|alveolar]] in the last of these.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|P\u00e9tursson|1971|p=?}}, cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=145}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|pp=144\u2013145}}</ref> Among non-Germanic [[Indo-European languages]] as a whole, the sound was also once much more widespread, but is today preserved in a few languages including the [[Brythonic languages]], [[Peninsular Spanish]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Venetian language|Venetian]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], few [[Occitan language|Occitan]] dialects and [[Greek language|Greek]]. It has likewise disappeared from many [[Semitic languages]], such as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] (excluding [[Yemenite Hebrew]]) and many modern [[varieties of Arabic]] (excluding [[Tunisian Arabic|Tunisian]], [[Mesopotamian Arabic]] and various dialects in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] which still include it).\n\n==Features==\nFeatures of the voiceless dental non-sibilant fricative:\n\n{{fricative}} It does not have the grooved tongue and directed airflow, or the high frequencies, of a [[sibilant]].\n{{dental}}\n{{voiceless}}\n{{oral}}\n{{central articulation}}\n{{pulmonic}}\n\n==Occurrence==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=2| Language !!

The Harrisons are among four families to have two presidents in their number with the same surname; the others are the [[Adams political family|Adams]], [[Roosevelt family|Roosevelt]], and [[Bush family|Bush]] families.{{efn|While presidents [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] share a surname, no familial connection is known.}} The family's lineage also includes state governors, legislators, mayors, and professionals.\n\nThe Virginia Harrison family consists primarily of two branches with origins in northern England. One  branch, led by Benjamin Harrison I, journeyed by way of Bermuda to [[Virginia]] before 1633 and settled on the [[James River]]; they are often referred to as the James River Harrisons. Successive generations of this branch served in the legislature of the [[Colony of Virginia]], including Benjamin V, who was a signatory of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and later governor of the commonwealth. This family branch produced President William Henry Harrison, Benjamin V's son, and President Benjamin Harrison, William Henry's grandson, as well as another [[List of Governors of Virginia|Virginia governor]], [[Albertis Harrison]]; the family also includes two Chicago mayors and members of the U. S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe second branch of the Virginia Harrisons emigrated from Britain to New England in 1687 and settled in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] of Virginia 50 years later; they were led by Isaiah Harrison. This branch most likely descended from an interim chaplain of the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown Colony]], Rev. Thomas Harrison, who was kindred to the James River Harrisons but who returned to England. President Abraham Lincoln descended from the Shenandoah Valley family, which also includes the founders of [[Harrisonburg, Virginia|Harrisonburg]] and [[Dayton, Virginia|Dayton]]. This branch as well produced local officials, educators, and physicians, who made contributions in the areas of linguistics, women's advocacy, and groundbreaking transplant surgery.\n\n==English origin==\nSome genealogists indicate that the first Harrisons were [[Viking]] warriors of Norse origin, and that they arrived in England with [[Cnut the Great]]; others say that they are of Norman, Irish, and Scottish descent.  Harrisons settled in [[Northumberland]], [[Yorkshire]], and [[County Durham|Durham]], all in the north of England. Some in their number used the older spelling \"Harryson\" (\"son of Harry\"), although this mostly ended with their arrival in the New World.<ref>Harrison, J. Houston, pp. 77\u201378.</ref>\n\nThe two Virginia Harrison lines share similar coats of arms, both issued in [[English heraldry]]. They feature helmets and shields emblazoned by gold eagles on a dark field with supporters. The arms of William Henry Harrison (1773\u20131841) of the James River Harrisons depict three eagles and are mentioned in the arms of \"Harrison of the North\", granted in England in 1574, as well as those of \"Harrison of London\", granted in 1613 with a pedigree dating from 1374. They are often referred to as the \"Yorkshire arms\".<ref>Harrison, J. Houston, pp. 78\u201380.</ref>\n\nThe \"Durham arms\" were used by Daniel Harrison of the Shenandoah Valley Harrisons, featuring one eagle and sourced to Harrisons descended from Durham. Included is the crest shoulder ''gules'' (red) signaling strength or martyrdom. These arms were first established by the pedigree of Robert Harrison in 1630, showing him to be the grandson of Rowland Harrison of [[Barnard Castle (castle)|Barnard Castle]] in Durham.<ref>Harrison, J. Houston, pp. 80\u201383.</ref>\n\n==James River family==\n[[File:Berkeley plantation harrison home.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Berkeley Plantation]],<br/>homestead of the James River Harrisons]]\nThe history of the James River Harrisons in the [[Colony of Virginia]] began in 1630 when Benjamin Harrison I left England for America by way of Bermuda.<ref name=Smith>Smith</ref>  Author J. Houston Harrison references the tradition, supported by other writers, that Benjamin had four brothers: Thomas, who also ended up in the south, Richard and Nathaniel who were in the north, and Edward who remained in England.<ref>Harrison, J.

He led a parish at [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]] at age 21, and was appointed by Governor [[William Berkeley (governor)|William Berkeley]] as an acting chaplain of the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown Colony]].<ref>Harrison, J. Houston, pp. 88.</ref>\n\n===Rev. Thomas Harrison===\nThomas earned his B.A. from [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]] in 1638, then sailed to Virginia in 1640.<ref name=Cambridge/> He became a Puritan and left his parishes and his chaplaincy at Jamestown following the 1644 Indian Massacre there. He moved to Boston near his brothers, married Dorothy Symonds, and later repatriated to England. In 1650, he had a parish at St. Dunstan-in-the-East, London, and joined the English Puritans. In 1655, then a widower, he became the Chaplain for [[Henry Cromwell]], accompanied him to Ireland, and there resided with the Governor and his family.<ref name=\"Harrison, Francis Burton\"/>\n\nThomas also formed a close friendship with famed author and cleric, Bishop [[Jeremy Taylor]]. Taylor biographer [[Edmund Gosse]] indicated that Thomas \"was rewarded by Governor Cromwell's confidence, and his advice was often asked for and acted upon. When in 1658 he published his extremely popular manual of piety, ''Topica Sacra'', he was the most popular divine in Ireland.\"<ref name=\"Harrison, Francis Burton\"/> ''Topica Sacra'' publicized Thomas as a robust and forceful cleric of his time. In an age of piety, the book invokes [[Job (biblical figure)|Job's]] insistence upon God's answers. Thomas was likewise notably confrontational in his prayers and, according to Gosse, was willing to \"catechize\" God for insight into His words. Thomas\u2019 work was dedicated to Cromwell and was reprinted on its centennial.<ref name=\"Harrison, Francis Burton\"/>\n \nIn 1659, he married Katherine Bradshaw and resided in [[Chester, England]]. He later settled in Dublin and probably fathered a son named Isaiah in 1666, who was the patriarch of the Virginia Harrisons of the Shenandoah Valley. Thomas died in Dublin in 1682.<ref>Harrison, J. Houston, pp. 101\u2013105.</ref>\n\nJ. Houston Harrison cites historian John Peyton who contended that the Valley Harrisons instead descended from Major General [[Thomas Harrison (soldier)|Thomas Harrison]] (1616\u20131660) who was born in the same year as the Reverend and whose wife was also named Katherine. The General participated in the [[List of regicides of Charles I|regicide]] of King [[Charles I of England]], and was therefore [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] in 1660. The Reverend's position as a non-conformist{{dub|a minster of Church of England, even after the Restoration|date=April 2020}} would have made them allies concerning the monarchy, which adds to the confusion of their identities. But no record is found at the [[College of Arms|Herald's College]] showing a pedigree and succeeding coat of arms for the General's family, as in the case of the Reverend. Also, no other lineage to the General has been adequately shown, and the notion is therefore discredited.<ref name=Harrison10>Harrison, J.

Thomas' use of the name Isaiah for his son was highly atypical\u2014the name is otherwise non-existent in family records to that time. However the name was quite in keeping with Puritan and non-conformist beliefs with which Thomas identified.<ref>Harrison, J. Houston, pp. 99.</ref>{{efn|Though Thomas' last will and testament of 1682 makes no mention of Isaiah, it omits as well his eldest son Thomas, born in Chester in 1661.<ref name=\"Harrison, Francis Burton\"/>}}\n\nIsaiah may well have sailed from Dublin for New York in 1687, on the ship ''The Spotted Calf''. His departure, following his father's death, was also a timely consequence of his father's position as a non-conformist. Isaiah Harrison is definitively shown at [[Oyster Bay (town), New York|Oyster Bay]] on Long Island in 1687\u2014this is the very same area from which his father Thomas had departed on his return to England forty years earlier.<ref>Harrison, J. Houston, pp. 89\u201393.</ref> The family of Richard Harrison lived just across [[Long Island Sound]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. Richard arrived in Connecticut in 1644 and was Isaiah's uncle. John Harrison is shown in [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]] in 1685, and Samuel at [[Gloucester County, New York|Gloucester, New York]] in 1688.<ref name=Harrison10/> There are records in Dublin which show Thomas' consistent and very unique spelling of Harrison with the double \"s\", not otherwise found in Ireland or England. Isaiah and his children utilized this same spelling in their American court records.<ref>Harrison, J.

Wife Elizabeth died shortly after the birth of her youngest. Isaiah married Abigail Smith in 1700 and they had five  children:{{efn|J.

The family lived at Oyster Bay for 14 years, then moved to [[Smithtown, New York]] near the [[Nissequogue River]] on Long Island, and remained for 19 years. They moved to [[Sussex County, Delaware]] in 1721, where Isaiah acquired the Maiden Plantation near the town of [[Lewes, Delaware|Lewes]], and daughter Abigail married Alexander Herring (1708\u20131780).<ref>Harrison, J.

The Harrisons are among four families to have two presidents in their number with the same surname; the others are the [[Adams political family|Adams]], [[Roosevelt family|Roosevelt]], and [[Bush family|Bush]] families.{{efn|While presidents [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] share a surname, no familial connection is known.}} The family's lineage also includes state governors, legislators, mayors, and professionals.\n\nThe Virginia Harrison family consists primarily of two branches with origins in northern England. One  branch, led by Benjamin Harrison I, journeyed by way of Bermuda to [[Virginia]] before 1633 and settled on the [[James River]]; they are often referred to as the James River Harrisons. Successive generations of this branch served in the legislature of the [[Colony of Virginia]], including Benjamin V, who was a signatory of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and later governor of the commonwealth. This family branch produced President William Henry Harrison, Benjamin V's son, and President Benjamin Harrison, William Henry's grandson, as well as another [[List of Governors of Virginia|Virginia governor]], [[Albertis Harrison]]; the family also includes two Chicago mayors and members of the U. S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe second branch of the Virginia Harrisons emigrated from Britain to New England in 1687 and settled in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] of Virginia 50 years later; they were led by Isaiah Harrison. This branch most likely descended from an interim chaplain of the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown Colony]], Rev. Thomas Harrison, who was kindred to the James River Harrisons but who returned to England. President Abraham Lincoln descended from the Shenandoah Valley family, which also includes the founders of [[Harrisonburg, Virginia|Harrisonburg]] and [[Dayton, Virginia|Dayton]]. This branch as well produced local officials, educators, and physicians, who made contributions in the areas of linguistics, women's advocacy, and groundbreaking transplant surgery.\n\n==English origin==\nSome genealogists indicate that the first Harrisons were [[Viking]] warriors of Norse origin, and that they arrived in England with [[Cnut the Great]]; others say that they are of Norman, Irish, and Scottish descent.  Harrisons settled in [[Northumberland]], [[Yorkshire]], and [[County Durham|Durham]], all in the northernmost region of England. Some in their number used the older spelling \"Harryson\" (\"son of Harry\"), although this mostly ended with their arrival in the New World.<ref>Harrison, J. Houston, pp. 77\u201378.</ref>\n\nThe two Virginia Harrison lines share similar coats of arms, both issued in [[English heraldry]]. They feature helmets and shields emblazoned by gold eagles on a dark field with supporters. The arms of William Henry Harrison (1773\u20131841) of the James River Harrisons depict three eagles and are mentioned in the arms of \"Harrison of the North\", granted in England in 1574, as well as those of \"Harrison of London\", granted in 1613 with a pedigree dating from 1374. They are often referred to as the \"Yorkshire arms\".<ref>Harrison, J. Houston, pp. 78\u201380.</ref>\n\nThe \"Durham arms\" were used by Daniel Harrison of the Shenandoah Valley Harrisons, featuring one eagle and sourced to Harrisons descended from Durham. Included is the crest shoulder ''gules'' (red) signaling strength or martyrdom. These arms were first established by the pedigree of Robert Harrison in 1630, showing him to be the grandson of Rowland Harrison of [[Barnard Castle (castle)|Barnard Castle]] in Durham.<ref>Harrison, J. Houston, pp. 80\u201383.</ref>\n\n==James River family==\n[[File:Berkeley plantation harrison home.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Berkeley Plantation]],<br/>homestead of the James River Harrisons]]\nThe history of the James River Harrisons in the [[Colony of Virginia]] began in 1630 when Benjamin Harrison I left England for America by way of Bermuda.<ref name=Smith>Smith</ref>  Author J.

Genealogist McConathy states that the father might have been Richard Harrison, who descended from Rowland Harrison of Durham.<ref>McConathy</ref> McConathy's work also allows that the brothers could have been the sons of Thomas Harrison, Lord of Gobion's Manor (1568\u20131625), and wife Elizabeth Bernard (1569\u20131643) of St. Giles, [[Nottinghamshire, England]].<ref>Harrison, J.

He most likely was the ancestor of Harrison emigrants to the Shenandoah Valley.<ref>Harrison, J.

Rush related that, just before signing the Declaration, Harrison turned to the diminutive [[Elbridge Gerry]] of Massachusetts and said, \"I shall have a great advantage over you, Mr. Gerry, when we are all hung for what we are now doing.

He moved to Boston near his brothers, married Dorothy Symonds, and later repatriated to England. In 1650, he had a parish at St. Dunstan-in-the-East, London, and joined the English Puritans. In 1655, then a widower, he became the Chaplain for [[Henry Cromwell]], accompanied him to Ireland, and there resided with the Governor and his family.<ref name=\"Harrison, Francis Burton\"/>\n\nThomas also formed a close friendship with famed author and cleric, Bishop [[Jeremy Taylor]]. Taylor biographer [[Edmund Gosse]] indicated that Thomas \"was rewarded by Governor Cromwell's confidence, and his advice was often asked for and acted upon. When in 1658 he published his extremely popular manual of piety, ''Topica Sacra'', he was the most popular divine in Ireland.\"<ref name=\"Harrison, Francis Burton\"/> ''Topica Sacra'' publicized Thomas as a robust and forceful cleric of his time. In an age of piety, the book invokes [[Job (biblical figure)|Job's]] insistence upon God's answers. Thomas was likewise notably confrontational in his prayers and, according to Gosse, was willing to \"catechize\" God for insight into His words. Thomas\u2019 work was dedicated to Cromwell and was reprinted on its centennial.<ref name=\"Harrison, Francis Burton\"/>\n \nIn 1659, he married Katherine Bradshaw and resided in [[Chester, England]]. He later settled in Dublin and probably fathered a son named Isaiah in 1666, who was the patriarch of the Virginia Harrisons of the Shenandoah Valley. Thomas died in Dublin in 1682.<ref>Harrison, J. Houston, pp. 101\u2013105.</ref>\n\nJ. Houston Harrison cites historian John Peyton who contended that the Valley Harrisons instead descended from Major General [[Thomas Harrison (soldier)|Thomas Harrison]] (1616\u20131660) who was born in the same year as the Reverend and whose wife was also named Katherine. The General participated in the [[List of regicides of Charles I|regicide]] of King [[Charles I of England]], and was therefore [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] in 1660. The Reverend's position as a non-conformist{{dub|a minster of Church of England, even after the Restoration|date=April 2020}} would have made them allies concerning the monarchy, which adds to the confusion of their identities. But no record is found at the [[College of Arms|Herald's College]] showing a pedigree and succeeding coat of arms for the General's family, as in the case of the Reverend. Also, no other lineage to the General has been adequately shown, and the notion is therefore discredited.<ref name=Harrison10>Harrison, J. Houston, pp. 10\u201315.</ref>\n\n===Isaiah and another president===\n[[File:Daniel Harrison House in Dayton.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Daniel Harrison House]], homestead of Daniel Harrison in Dayton, Virginia]]\n\nThe strongest evidence (though circumstantial for lack of a birth record) is that Reverend Thomas Harrison was the father of Isaiah Harrison (1666\u20131738), who was born in Dublin at the time of Thomas' residence and marriage there. Thomas' use of the name Isaiah for his son was highly atypical\u2014the name is otherwise non-existent in family records to that time. However the name was quite in keeping with Puritan and non-conformist beliefs with which Thomas identified.<ref>Harrison, J. Houston, pp. 99.</ref>{{efn|Though Thomas' last will and testament of 1682 makes no mention of Isaiah, it omits as well his eldest son Thomas, born in Chester in 1661.<ref name=\"Harrison, Francis Burton\"/>}}\n\nIsaiah may well have sailed from Dublin for New York in 1687, on the ship ''The Spotted Calf''. His departure, following his father's death, was also a timely consequence of his father's position as a non-conformist. Isaiah Harrison is definitively shown at [[Oyster Bay (town), New York|Oyster Bay]] on Long Island in 1687\u2014this is the very same area from which his father Thomas had departed on his return to England forty years earlier.<ref>Harrison, J. Houston, pp. 89\u201393.</ref> The family of Richard Harrison lived just across [[Long Island Sound]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. Richard arrived in Connecticut in 1644 and was Isaiah's uncle. John Harrison is shown in [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]] in 1685, and Samuel at [[Gloucester County, New York|Gloucester, New York]] in 1688.<ref name=Harrison10/> There are records in Dublin which show Thomas' consistent and very unique spelling of Harrison with the double \"s\", not otherwise found in Ireland or England. Isaiah and his children utilized this same spelling in their American court records.<ref>Harrison, J. Houston, p. 99.</ref><ref>Hood, p. 449.</ref>\n\n[[File:Abraham Lincoln O-55, 1861-crop.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Harrison descendant, President [[Abraham Lincoln]]]]\n\nIsaiah's first wife was Elizabeth Wright, with whom he had five children: Isaiah (b.1689), John (1691\u20131771), Gideon (1694\u20131729), Mary (1696\u20131781), and Elizabeth (b.1698). Wife Elizabeth died shortly after the birth of her youngest. Isaiah married Abigail Smith in 1700 and they had five  children:{{efn|J. Houston Harrison's reference to Abigail's maiden name of Smith indicates an uncertainty but no detail is offered.}} Daniel (1701\u20131770), Thomas (1704\u20131785), Jeremiah (1707\u20131777), Abigail (1710\u20131780), and Samuel (1712\u20131790). The family lived at Oyster Bay for 14 years, then moved to [[Smithtown, New York]] near the [[Nissequogue River]] on Long Island, and remained for 19 years. They moved to [[Sussex County, Delaware]] in 1721, where Isaiah acquired the Maiden Plantation near the town of [[Lewes, Delaware|Lewes]], and daughter Abigail married Alexander Herring (1708\u20131780).<ref>Harrison, J.

Isaiah died in 1738 and was buried on the banks of the [[Shenandoah River]]. Son Daniel made the family's first Virginia land acquisition in 1739 in [[Rockingham County, Virginia|Rockingham County]], and he and brother Thomas founded the towns of [[Dayton, Virginia|Dayton]] and [[Harrisonburg, Virginia|Harrisonburg]] respectively.<ref name=Harrison10/> Brother John settled at Great Spring, and Samuel settled at nearby [[Linville, Virginia|Linville]].

Their daughter Bathsheba (1742\u20131836) married Captain [[Abraham Lincoln (captain)|Abraham Lincoln]] (1744\u20131786), also of Linville, and they had son Thomas (1778\u20131851) who married Nancy Hanks (1783\u20131818).<ref name=Wayland>Wayland, John W., pp. 24\u201357.</ref><ref name=HarrisonAL>Harrison, J.

He was highly regarded in the classics and linguistics, and served as faculty chairman. The devout Gessner is also remembered for declining [[Thomas Jefferson]]\u2019s invitation to Sunday dinner at [[Monticello]], saying it would represent a desecration of the sabbath.
