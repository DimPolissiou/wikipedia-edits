Their roles, pay, and obligations differ according to their [[military branch]] ([[army]], [[navy]], [[marines]], [[air force]], [[space force]], and sometimes [[coast guard]]), [[Military rank|rank]] ([[Officer (armed forces)|officer]], [[non-commissioned officer]], or [[Enlisted rank|enlisted recruit]]), and their military task when [[Military deployment|deployed]] on [[Combat operation|operations]] and on [[Military exercise|exercise]].\n\n==Overview==\nThose who serve in a typical large land force are [[soldier]]s, making up an [[army]]. Those who serve in seagoing forces are seamen or [[sailors]], and their branch is a [[navy]] or [[coast guard]]. [[Marine (military)|Marines]] serve in a [[marine corps]]. In the 20th century, the development of powered flight aircraft prompted the development of air forces, serviced by [[airmen|airmen and women]].\n\nDesignated leaders of military personnel are [[officer (armed forces)|officers]]. These include [[commissioned officers]], [[warrant officer]]s and [[non-commissioned officer]]s (NCOs). For naval forces, non-commissioned officers are referred to as [[petty officer]]s.\n\nOrganizations other than state armed forces include military personnel, such as [[Paramilitary|paramilitary organizations]] and [[Violent non-state actor|non-state armed groups]].\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Main|Military recruitment}}\nMost personnel at the start of their military career are young adults.

Those who serve in seagoing forces are seamen or [[sailors]], and their branch is a [[navy]] or [[coast guard]]. [[Marine (military)|Marines]] serve in a [[marine corps]].

'''''mestiza''''') is a term historically used in [[Spain]] and [[Hispanic America]] that originally referred to a person of combined [[European colonization of the Americas|European]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American]] descent, regardless of where the person was born. The term was used as an ethnic/racial category for mixed-race ''[[casta]]s'' that evolved during the [[Spanish Empire]]. Although broadly speaking, ''mestizo'' means someone of mixed European/indigenous heritage, the term did not have a fixed meaning in the colonial period. It was a formal label for individuals in official documentation, such as censuses, parish registers, Inquisition trials, and other matters. Individuals were labeled by priests and royal officials as mestizos, but the term was also used for self identification.<ref>Rappaport, ''The Disappearing Mestizo'', p. 4</ref>\n\nIn the modern era, particularly in [[Hispanic America]], ''mestizo'' has become more of a cultural term, with the term '''Indian''' being reserved exclusively for people who have maintained a separate indigenous ethnic identity, [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|language]], tribal affiliation, etc. In late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Peru, for instance, ''mestizos'' were ethno-racial \"mixed\" peoples with access (usually monetary access, but not always) to secondary educational institutions. This conception changed by the 1920s with the national and spiritual ascension of ''[[Indigenismo#Indigenism_in_Peru|indigenismo]]''.\n\nThe term '''[[casta#mestizaje|mestizaje]]''' \u2013 taking as its root ''mestizo'' or mixed \u2013 came from the Latin word ''mixtus'', meaning mixed. It is the modern Spanish word coined in the twentieth century for race mixture or [[miscegenation]], the general process of mixing ancestries.<ref>Rappaport, Joanne, ''The Disappearing Mestizo'', p. 247.</ref>\n\nTo avoid confusion with the original usage of the term {{lang|es|mestizo}}, mixed people started to be referred to collectively as {{lang|es|castas}}. In some Latin American countries, such as [[Mexico]], the concept of the mestizo became central to the formation of a new independent identity that was neither wholly Spanish nor wholly indigenous, and the word ''mestizo'' acquired its current meaning, it being used by the government to refer to all Mexicans who do not speak [[Languages of Mexico|indigenous languages]],<ref name=\"EL MESTIZAJE Y LAS CULTURAS REGIONALES\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nacionmulticultural.unam.mx/Portal/Izquierdo/BANCO/Mxmulticultural/Elmestizajeylasculturas-elmestizaje.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823015618/http://www.nacionmulticultural.unam.mx/Portal/Izquierdo/BANCO/Mxmulticultural/Elmestizajeylasculturas-elmestizaje.html|url-status=dead|title=en el censo de 1930 el gobierno mexicano dej\u00f3 de clasificar a la poblaci\u00f3n del pa\u00eds en tres categor\u00edas raciales, blanco, mestizo e ind\u00edgena, y adopt\u00f3 una nueva clasificaci\u00f3n \u00e9tnica que distingu\u00eda a los hablantes de lenguas ind\u00edgenas del resto de la poblaci\u00f3n, es decir de los hablantes de espa\u00f1ol.|archivedate=23 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book |last=Bartolom\u00e9 |first=Miguel Alberto |year=1996 |chapter=Pluralismo cultural y redefinicion del estado en M\u00e9xico |title=Coloquio sobre derechos ind\u00edgenas |location=Oaxaca |publisher=IOC |isbn=978-968-6951-31-8 |chapterurl=http://courses.cit.cornell.edu/iard4010/documents/Pluralismo_cultural_y_redefinicion_del_estado_en_Mexico.pdf |page=5}}</ref> including people of complete European or indigenous descent as well as [[Asian Mexicans|Asians]] and [[Afro-Mexicans|Africans]].<ref name=\"Knight 1990:73\">{{cite book |last=Knight |first=Alan |year=1990 |chapter=Racism, Revolution and ''indigenismo'': Mexico 1910\u20131940 |title=The Idea of Race in Latin America, 1870\u20131940 |editor-first=Richard |editor-last=Graham |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ideaofraceinlat000grah/page/73 73] |location=Austin |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=978-0-292-73856-0 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/ideaofraceinlat000grah/page/73 }}</ref> While the caste system and racial classifications were officially abandoned once Mexico achieved its [[Independence of Mexico|independence]], the label mestizo was still used in academic circles: now to refer to all the people who were [[mixed race]]. It was in those academic circles that the \"Mestizaje\" or \"[[La Raza C\u00f3smica|Cosmic Race]]\" ideology was created, the ideology asserted that Mestizos are the result of the mixing of all the races. After the [[Mexican Revolution]] the government, on its attempts to create an unified Mexican identity with no racial distinctions adopted and actively promoted the \"Mestizaje\" ideology.<ref name=\"EL MESTIZAJE Y LAS CULTURAS REGIONALES\"/>\n\nThe [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] [[cognate]], ''[[mesti\u00e7o]]'', historically referred to any mixture of Portuguese and local populations in the [[Portuguese colonies]]. In [[colonial Brazil]] most of the non-enslaved population was initially ''[[caboclo|mesti\u00e7o de indio]]'', i.e. mixed Portuguese and native Brazilian. There was no descent-based casta system, and children of upper class Portuguese landlord males and enslaved females would enjoy privileges higher than the ones given to the lower classes, such as formal education, though such cases were not so common and they tended to not inherit property, generally given to the children of free women, who tended to be legitimate offspring in cases of concubinage (also a common practice, inherited from Amerindian and African customs).\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], which was a colony of Spain, the term [[Filipino mestizo|''mestizo'']] came to refer to a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] with any foreign ancestry, and usually shortened as ''[[Tisoy]]''.\n\nIn [[Indonesia]], the term mestizo refers to ethnicity which is a mixture of [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]]s and [[native Indonesian]]; they are usually referred to as the [[Indo people]].\n\nIn [[Ontario]] and western [[Canada]], the [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] people are a distinct community composed of the descendants of Europeans (usually French or Scottish, sometimes English) involved in the fur trade and Canadian First Nations peoples (especially [[Cree]] and [[Anishinaabe]]; it does not include people of mixed European and Inuit ancestry). As used in [[Quebec]], however, the term refers to anyone of mixed European (usually French) and First Nations ancestry.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe Spanish word {{lang|es|mestizo}} is from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''mixticius'', meaning mixed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mestizo |title=mestizo |year=2008 |work=Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated |quote=a person of mixed blood; specifically: a person of mixed European and American Indian indigenous ancestry}}</ref><ref name=\"dictionary.reference.com\">{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mestizo |title=Mestizo \u2013 Define Mestizo at Dictionary.com |work=Dictionary.com |accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref> Its usage has been documented as early as 1275, to refer to the offspring of an [[Egypt|Egyptian/Afro/Hamite]] and a [[Semitic people|Semite]]/Afro Asiatic.<ref name=\"AlfonsoX-p261R\">{{cite book |author=Alfonso X |title=General Estoria.

It is related to the particular racial identity of historical Amerindian-descended [[Hispanic and Latino American]] communities in an American context.\n\nIn English-speaking Canada, [[M\u00e9tis (Canada)|Canadian M\u00e9tis]] (with upper-case), as a loanword from French, refers to persons of mixed French and Indigenous ancestry. French-speaking Canadians, when using the word m\u00e9tis, are referring to [[M\u00e9tis (Canada)|Canadian M\u00e9tis]] ethnicity, and all persons of mixed Amerindian and European ancestry, rather than the broader concept of mixed people in general ({{lang|fr|m\u00e9tis}} with lowercase), present in all other French-speaking countries, as would speakers of Spanish; the usual term to refer to mixed-ethnicity people in general is thus \"mul\u00e2tre\", which is considered elsewhere pejorative. In the United States, [[M\u00e9tis people (United States)|M\u00e9tis Americans]] and [[Mestizos in the United States|Mestizo Americans]] are two distinct racial and [[racial identity|ethno-racial identities]], as reflected in the use of French and Spanish loanwords, respectively.\n\nIn the Philippines, the word ''mestizo'' usually refers to a Filipino with combined [[Ethnic groups in the Philippines|Indigenous]] and European ancestry, but occasionally it will be used for a Filipino with apparent Chinese ancestry, who will also be referred to as 'chinito'. The latter was officially listed as a \"mestizo de sangley\" in birth records of the 19th century, with 'sangley' as a reference to the [[Hokkienese]] word for business, 'seng-li'.\n\nIn the Portuguese-speaking world, the contemporary sense has been the closest to the historical usage from the Middle Ages, because of important linguistic differences, so that {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}} (mixed, mixed-ethnicity, miscegenation, etc.) is separated altogether from {{lang|pt|pardo}} (any kind of brown people) and {{lang|pt|caboclo}} (brown people originally of European\u2013Amerindian admixture or assimilated Amerindians), in which {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7os}} can be also fully African or East Asian in their full definition (thus not brown) and one does not need to be a {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}} to be a part of the latter two categories.\n\nIn Brazil specifically, at least in modern times all non-Indigenous people are part of a single ethnicity ({{lang|pt|os brasileiros}}; lines between ethnic groups are historically fluid), the {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}} ({{IPA-pt|me\u0283\u02c8t(\u0283)isu}}, {{IPA-pt|mi\u0283\u02c8t(\u0283)isu|}}) group is by far the largest among the free people since the earliest decades of the colony.

Throughout the territories of [[Spanish Empire]] in the Americas, ways of differentiating individuals in a racial hierarchy, often called in the modern era the ''sistema de castas'' or the ''sociedad de castas'' developed where society was divided based on color, ''calidad'' (status) and other factors.  The main divisions were as follows:\n\n# ''Espa\u00f1ol'' (fem. espa\u00f1ola), i.e. [[Spaniards|Spaniard]] \u2013 person of Spanish or other European ancestry; a blanket term, subdivided into ''Peninsulares'' and ''Criollos''\n#*''[[Peninsulars|Peninsular]]'' \u2013 a European born in Spain who later settled in the Americas;\n#* ''[[Criollo people|Criollo]]'' (fem. criolla)&nbsp;\u2013 a Spanish or other European descent born in the Americas;\n# ''[[Castizo]]'' (fem. castiza) \u2013 a person with primarily European and some Amerindian ancestry born into a mixed family; the offspring of a castizo and an espa\u00f1ol was considered espa\u00f1ol. Offspring of a castizo/a of an Espa\u00f1ol/a returned to Espa\u00f1ol/a.\n# ''Mestizo'' (fem. mestiza) \u2013 a person of extended mixed European and Amerindian ancestry;\n# ''[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indio]]'' (fem. India) \u2013 a person of pure Amerindian ancestry;\n# ''[[Pardo]]'' (fem. parda) \u2013 a person of mixed White, Amerindian and African ancestry; sometimes a polite term for a black person;\n# ''[[Mulatto|Mulato]]'' (fem. mulata) \u2013 a person of mixed White, and African ancestry;\n# ''[[Zambo]]'' \u2013 a person of mixed African and Amerindian ancestry;\n# ''[[Negro]]'' (fem. negra)&nbsp;\u2013 a person of [[Atlantic slave trade|African]] descent, primarily former enslaved Africans and their descendants.\n\nIn theory, and as depicted in eighteenth-century Mexican casta paintings, ''espa\u00f1ol'' status could also be restored to the offspring of a Castizo/a [mixed Spanish - Mestizo] and an Espa\u00f1ol/a.<ref>M\u00f6rner, ''Race Mixture'', p.58.</ref>\n\n'''Racial labels in a set of eighteenth-century Mexican casta paintings by [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]]''':\n*'''De Espa\u00f1ol e India, nace Mestiza'''\n*'''De Espa\u00f1ol y Mestiza, nace Castiza'''\n*De Castizo y Espa\u00f1ola, nace Espa\u00f1ola\n*De Espa\u00f1ol y Negra, nace Mulata\n*De Espa\u00f1ol y Mulata, nace Morisca\n*De Espa\u00f1ol y Morisca, nace Albino\n*De Espa\u00f1ol y Albina, nace [[Torna atr\u00e1s]]\n*De Espa\u00f1ol y Torna atr\u00e1s, \"Tente en el ayre\"\n*De Negro y India, Chino Cambuja\n*De Chino Cambujo y India, [[Lobo (racial category)|Loba]]\n*De Lobo y India, Albarazado\n*'''De Albarazado y Mestiza, Barcino'''\n*De Indio y Barcina, Zambaiga\n*'''De Castizo y Mestiza, Chamizo'''\n*Indios Gentiles (Barbarian [[Chichimeca|Meco Indians]])\n\nIn the early colonial period, the offspring of Espa\u00f1oles and Indias were raised either in the Hispanic world, if the father recognized the offspring as his natural child; or the child was raised in the indigenous world of the mother if he did not.  As early as 1533, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] mandated the high court ([[Real Audiencia|Audiencia]]) to take the children of Spanish men and indigenous women from their mothers and educate them in the Spanish sphere.<ref name=\"auto1\">M\u00f6rner, ''Race Mixture'', p. 55.</ref> This mixed group born out of Christian wedlock increased in numbers, generally living in their mother's indigenous communities.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nMestizos were the first group in the colonial era to be designated as a separate category from European whites (Espa\u00f1oles) and enslaved African blacks (''Negros'') and were included in designation of \"vagabonds\" (''vagabundos'') in 1543 in Mexico. Although mestizos were often classified as ''castas'', they had a higher standing than any mixed-race person since they did not have to pay tribute, the men could be ordained as priests, and they could be licensed to carry weapons, in contrast to ''negros'', mulattoes, and other castas.  Unlike blacks and mulattoes, mestizos had no enslaved ancestors.<ref>Lewis, Laura A. ''Hall of Mirrors: Power, Witchcraft, and Caste in Colonial Mexico''. Durham: Duke University Press 2003, p. 84.</ref> Intermarriage between Espa\u00f1oles and mestizos resulted in offspring designated ''[[castizo]]s'' (\"three-quarters white\"), and the marriage of a castizo/a to an Espa\u00f1ol/a resulted in the restoration of Espa\u00f1ol/a status to the offspring. Don Alonso O\u2019Crouley observed in Mexico (1774), \"If the mixed-blood is the offspring of a Spaniard and an Indian, the stigma [of race mixture] disappears at the third step in descent because it is held as systematic that a Spaniard and an Indian produce a mestizo; a mestizo and a Spaniard, a castizo; and a castizo and a Spaniard, a Spaniard. The admixture of Indian blood should not indeed be regarded as a blemish, since the provisions&nbsp; of law give the&nbsp; Indian all&nbsp; that he could wish for,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Philip II granted to mestizos the privilege of becoming priests. On this consideration is based&nbsp;the&nbsp;common estimation of&nbsp; descent&nbsp; from a&nbsp; union of&nbsp; Indian and European or creole Spaniard.\"<ref>Sr. Don Pedro Alonso O\u2019Crouley, ''A Description of the Kingdom of New Spain'' (1774),trans. and ed.

Indians were free vassals of the crown, whose commoners paid tribute while indigenous elites were considered nobles and tribute exempt, as were mestizos. Indians were nominally protected by the crown, with non-Indians\u2014mestizos, blacks, and mulattoes\u2014forbidden to live in indigenous communities. Mestizos and Indians in Mexico habitually held each other in mutual antipathy. This was particularly the case with commoner Indians against mestizos, some of whom infiltrated their communities and became part of the ruling elite. Spanish authorities turned a blind eye to the mestizos' presence, since they collected commoners' tribute for the crown and came to hold offices. They were useful intermediaries for the colonial state between the Republic of Spaniards and the Republic of Indians.<ref>Lewis, ''Hall of Mirrors'', pp. 86-91.</ref>\n\nA person's legal racial classification in colonial Spanish America was closely tied to social status, wealth, culture and language use. Wealthy people paid to change or obscure their actual ancestry.

Other ethnic groups known to live in Costa Rica include Nicaraguan, Colombians,Venezuelans, Peruvian, Brazilians, Portuguese, [[Palestinians]], Caribbeans, Turks, Armenians and Georgians.\n\nMany of the first Spanish colonists in Costa Rica may have been Jewish converts to [[Christianity]] who were expelled from Spain in 1492 and fled to colonial backwaters to avoid the Inquisition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/dje/articles2/costarica.htm|title=The Jewish Community in Costa Rica|accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref> The first sizable group of self-identified Jews immigrated from Poland, beginning in 1929.

It was a first attempt by the [[Spaniards]] to establish a permanent settlement in El Salvador. The city was abandoned after Native repeatedly attacked and then resettled again in 1528, then completely abandoned and dismantled in 1545 and moved to modern day [[San Salvador]] City. The settlement resembles more of a fortified military base rather than a city. The historic census indicates that the city contained male Spaniards with many Mestizo children with Native American indigenous wives]]\n\nIn [[Central America]], intermarriage by European men with the Native American Indigenous [[Lenca]], [[Cacaopera people|Cacaopera]] and [[Pipil people|Pipil]] women of what is now [[El Salvador]] happened almost immediately after the arrival of the European [[Spaniards]] led by [[Pedro de Alvarado]]. Other indigenous groups in the country such as [[Maya peoples|Maya]] [[Poqomam people]], [[Maya peoples|Maya]] [[Ch'orti' people]], [[Alaguilac]], [[Xinca people]], [[Mixe]] and [[Mangue language]] people became culturally extinct due to the Mestizo process or diseases brought by the Spaniards. Mestizo culture quickly became the most successful and dominant culture in El Salvador. The majority of Salvadorans in modern El Salvador identify themselves as 86.3% Mestizo roots.<ref>[http://www.digestyc.gob.sv/servers/redatam/htdocs/CPV2007S/Docs/RESULTADOS_FINALES.pdf Ethnic Groups -2007 official Census]. Page 13, Digestyc.gob.sv</ref>\n\nIn 1932, ruthless dictator [[Maximiliano Hernandez Martinez]] was responsible for La Matanza (\"The Slaughter\"), known as the [[1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre]] in which the Native American indigenous people were murdered in an effort to wipe out the indigenous people in El Salvador during the 1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising. Indigenous peoples, mostly of Lenca, Cacaopera and Pipil descent are still present in El Salvador in several communities, conserving their languages, customs, and traditions.\n\nThere is a significant Arab population (of about 100,000), mostly from [[Palestinian Salvadoran|Palestine]] (especially from the area of Bethlehem), but also from Lebanon. Salvadorans of Palestinian descent numbered around 70,000 individuals, while Salvadorans of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] descent is around 27,000. There is also a small community of Jews who came to El Salvador from France, Germany, Morocco, Tunisia, and Turkey. Many of these Arab groups naturally mixed and contributed into the modern Salvadoran Mestizo population.\n\n[[Pardo]] is the term that was used in colonial El Salvador to describe a tri-racial Afro-Mestizo person of Indigenous, European, and African descent. El Salvador is the only country in Central America that does not have a significant African population due to many factors including El Salvador not having a Caribbean coast, and because of president [[Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez]], who passed racial laws to keep Afros and other peoples out of El Salvador, though [[Afro-Salvadoran|Salvadorans with African ancestry]], called Pardos, were already present in El Salvador, the majority are tri-racial Pardo Salvadorans who largely cluster with the Mestizo population. They have been mixed into and were naturally bred out by the general Mestizo population, which is a combination of a Mestizo majority and the minority of Pardo people, both of whom are racially mixed populations. A total of only 10,000 enslaved Africans were brought to El Salvador over the span of 75 years, starting around 1548, about 25 years after El Salvador's colonization. The enslaved Africans that were brought to El Salvador during the colonial times, eventually came to mix and merged into the much larger and vaster Mestizo mixed European Spanish/Native Indigenous population creating Pardo or Afromestizos who cluster with Mestizo people, contributing into the modern day Mestizo population in El Salvador, thus, there remains no significant extremes of African physiognomy among Salvadorans like there is in the other countries of Central America.\n\nToday, Salvadorans who are racially European, especially Mediterranean, as well as Native American indigenous people in El Salvador who do not speak indigenous languages nor have an indigenous culture, also tri-racial Pardo Salvadorans, and Salvadoran of Arab descent, also identify themselves as culturally Salvadoran Mestizo by absorption.\n\n====Guatemala====\n{{See also|Demographics of Guatemala}}\nThe Ladino population in [[Guatemala]] is officially recognized as a distinct ethnic group, and the Ministry of Education of Guatemala uses the following definition: \n<blockquote>\"The ladino population has been characterized as a heterogeneous population which expresses itself in the Spanish language as a maternal language, which possesses specific cultural traits of Hispanic origin mixed with indigenous cultural elements, and dresses in a style commonly considered as western.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.minedoc.gob.gt/administracion/dependencias/centrales/ccre/ccre_interculturalidad.htm |title=Reflexiones sobre el mestizaje y la identidad nacional en Centroam\u00e9rica: de la colonia a las R\u00e9publicas liberales |access-date=28 July 2008 |author=Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n (MINEDUC) |authorlink= |year=2008 |website= |pages= |language=Spanish |doi= |quote= }}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Spanish-speaking South America==\n\n===Argentina and Uruguay===\n{{main|Argentine people|Uruguayan people}}\nInitially colonial [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]] had a predominately mestizo population like the rest of the Spanish colonies, but due to a flood of European migration in the 19th century and the repeated intermarriage with Europeans the mestizo population became a so-called {{lang|es|castizo}} population. With more Europeans arriving in the early 20th century, the majority of these immigrants coming from [[Spain]] and [[Italy]], the face of Argentina and Uruguay has overwhelmingly become European in culture and tradition. Because of this, the term mestizo has fallen into disuse.

In Southern Chile, the Mapuche, were one of the only Amerindian tribes in the Americas that were in continuous conflict with the [[Spanish Empire]] and did not submit to a European power.\n\nA public health book from the [[University of Chile]] states that 30% of the population is of White origin; mestizos are estimated to amount to a total of 65%, while Native Americans (Amerindians) comprise the remaining 5%. A genetic study by the same university showed that the average Chilean's genes in the mestizo segment are 60% European and 40% Amerindian.\n\n===Colombia===\n{{Main|Mestizo Colombian}}\n[[Colombia]] whose land was named after explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] is the product of the interacting and mixing of the European [[conquistador]]s and colonist with the different Amerindian peoples of Colombia. Later the African element was introduced into the coastal parts of Colombia as enslaved people.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nOver time Colombia has become a primarily Mestizo country due to limited immigration from Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries, with the minorities being: the [[Mulatto]]es and [[Pardo]]s living primarily in the coastal areas; and pockets of Amerindians living around the rural areas and the Amazonian Basin regions of the country.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nAn extraofficial estimate considers that the 49% of the Colombian population is [[Mestizo Colombian|Mestizo]] or of mixed European and Amerindian ancestry. Approximately 37% is of [[White Colombian|European]] ancestry (predominantly [[Spaniards|Spanish]], and a part of [[Italians|Italian]], [[French people|French]], and [[Germans|German]]) and of [[Arab diaspora in Colombia|Middle Eastern]] ancestry. 10.6% is of [[Afro-Colombian|African]] ancestry. [[Indigenous peoples in Colombia|Indigenous Amerindians]] comprise 3.4% of the population. 0.01% of the population are [[Romani people|Roma]].<ref name=\"The Society and Its Environment\">Bushnell, David & Rex A.

With the passage of time these Spanish conquerors and succeeding Spanish colonists sired offspring with the local Amerindian population, since Spanish immigration did not initially include many White females to the colonies. In a couple of generations a predominately mestizo population emerged in Ecuador with a drastically declining Amerindian Population due to European diseases and wars.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n[[Afro-Ecuadorians]] ([[Zambos]] and [[Mulatto]]es), who are a minority in the country, can be found mostly in the [[Esmeraldas Province]], in the [[Valle del Chota]] of the [[Imbabura Province]], and as small communities of Afro-Ecuadorians living along the coastal areas as minorities.\n\nMestizos are by far the largest of all the ethnic groups, and comprise 71.9% of the current population. The next 28% of the population is comprised by four ethnic groups with about 7% each, the Montubios, Afro-Ecuadorian, Amerindian (Indigenous) and White.\n\n===Paraguay===\n{{main|Paraguayan people}}\nDuring the reign of [[Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Rodr\u00edguez de Francia]], the first consul of [[Paraguay]] from 1811 to 1840, he imposed a law that no Spaniard may intermarry with another Spaniard, and that they may only wed mestizos or Indians.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} This was introduced to eliminate any sense of racial superiority, and also to end the predominantly Spanish influence in Paraguay. De Francia himself was not a mestizo (although his paternal grandfather was [[Afro-Brazilian]]), but feared that racial superiority would create [[class division]] which would threaten his [[Autocracy|absolute rule]].\n\nAs a result of this, today 90% of Paraguay's population are mestizo, and the main language is the native [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]], spoken by 60% of the population as a first language, with Spanish spoken as a first language by 40% of the population, and fluently spoken by 75%, making Paraguay one of the most bilingual countries in the world. Although it did not had the exposition to [[miscegenation]] as de Francia wanted, after the tremendous decline of male population as a result of the [[War of the Triple Alliance]], European male worker \u00e9migr\u00e9s mixed with the female mestizo population so as that pushed a middle class of mestizo background largely accepted as a configuration of the country.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Peru===\n[[File:Mestizo.

The Mixed Ethnicty Day, or Mestizo Day (Dia do Mesti\u00e7o), on 27 June, is official event in States of Amazonas, Roraima e Para\u00edba and a holyday in two cities.\n\nOne of the most notorious group is the {{lang|pt|pardo}} (brown people), also informally known as {{lang|pt|moreno}} (tan skinned people; given its euphemism-like nature, it may be interpreted as offensive). They include mostly those of non-white skin color. Nevertheless, not all {{lang|pt|pardos}} are {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7os}}. For example, an Amerindian (initially and most often {{lang|pt|\u00edndio}}, often more formally {{lang|pt|ind\u00edgena}}, rarely {{lang|pt|amer\u00edndio}}, an East Indian ({{lang|pt|indiano}})) or a Filipino may be initially described as {{lang|pt|pardo/parda}} (in opposition to {{lang|pt|branco}}, white, {{lang|pt|negro}}, Afro, and {{lang|pt|amarelo}}, yellow) if his or her ethnicity is unknown, and it is testified by the initial discovery reports of Portuguese navigators. In the same way, {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}}, a term used to describe anyone with any degree of [[miscegenation]] in one's blood line, may apply to all said groups (that in Portugal and its ex-colonies, always depended solely on phenotype, meaning a brown person may have a full sibling of all other basic phenotypes and thus ethnic groups).\n\nImportant {{lang|pt|pardo}} groups in Brazil are the {{lang|pt|caboclos}} (largely contemporary usage) or {{lang|pt|mamelucos}} (largely archaic usage), the {{lang|pt|mulatos}}, and the {{lang|pt|cafuzos}}. The first group is composed of the culturally assimilated Amerindians as well as the ''brown-skinned'' descendants or children of both white or {{lang|pt|moreno}} (swarthy) people of otherwise White phenotype and Amerindians. They are an important group in the Northern (Amazon Basin) region, but also relatively numerous on the Northeastern and Center-Western ones. Then, those, neither Afro- nor fair-skinned, whose origins come from the admixture between White or {{lang|pt|morenos}} and Afros or {{lang|pt|cafuzos}}. The last group is composed of descendants of Amerindians or {{lang|pt|caboclos}} and Afros or other {{lang|pt|cafuzos}}. Finally, those whose origins possess a notorious level of European ancestry and in which neither Amerindian nor African phenotypical traces are much more present than each other are sometimes known as {{lang|pt|ju\u00e7aras}}.\n\n[[File:Ronaldo-14-05-2013.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Brazilian footballer [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]]]]\nThere are, however, important groups who are {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7os}} but not necessarily {{lang|pt|pardos}}. People of East Asian and non-Asian descent combined are known as {{lang|pt|ainokos}}, from the Japanese \"love (ai) child (ko)\" (also used for all children of illegitimate birth.  Mixed children are now largely referred to as \"half\" or [[h\u0101fu]]), though often, for those without contact with the term, {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o de}} [East Asian nationality/ethnicity] may also be used. {{lang|pt|[[Sarar\u00e1]]s}} differ from {{lang|pt|mulatos}} at being fair-skinned (rather than brown-skinned), and having non-straight [[blond]] or [[red hair]].\n\nOther people who are not brown (and thus not {{lang|pt|pardo}}), but also their phenotypes by anything other than skin, hair and eye color do not match white ones but rather those of people of color may be just referred to as {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}}, without specification to skin color with an identitarian connotation (there are the distinctions, though, of {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o claro}}, for the fair-skinned ones, and {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o moreno}}, for those of olive skin tones). In Brazilian censuses, those people may choose to identify mostly with {{lang|pt|branco}} (White) or {{lang|pt|pardo}} (brown) or leave the question on ethnic/color blank.\n\n===Lusophone Africa===\n\n====Angolan mesti\u00e7o====\nThe {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}} are primarily of mixed European, [[Jus soli|native]] born [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Precolonial history of Angola|Angolan]] or other [[Sub-Saharan Africans#Sub-Saharan Africa|indigenous African]] lineages. They tend to be Portuguese culturally and to have full Portuguese names.\n\nAlthough they make up about two percent of the population, they are the socially elite and racially privileged group in the country. Historically, {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7os}} formed social and cultural allegiances with [[Colonial history of Angola|Portuguese colonists]] subsequently identifying with the Portuguese over and above their indigenous identities. Despite their loyalty, the ethnic group faced economic and political adversity at hands of the white population during times of economic hardship for whites. These actions lead to ostracizing Mesti\u00e7os from their inherited economic benefits which sparked the group to take a new sociopolitical direction.\n\nAcross the 500 year Portuguese presence in the country, the Mesti\u00e7o have retained their position of entitlement which is highly evident in the political, economic and [[Culture of Angola#Mesti\u00e7o|cultural]] hierarchy in present-day [[Angola]]. Their [[phenotype]] range is broad with a number of members possessing physical characteristics that are close to others within the indigenous Afro [[Demographics of Angola|non-mixed]] population. Since the Mesti\u00e7os are generally better educated than the rest of the indigenous Afro population, they exercise influence in government disproportionate to their numbers.\n\n====Bissau-Guinean mesti\u00e7o====\n1% of the population is of mixed African and Portuguese descent, [[Tamahaq language|Tamahaq]], and Arabic genetic influence ignored.\n\n====Mozambican mesti\u00e7o====\nA minority population of Mozambicans of mixed Bantu and Portuguese heritage.\n\n====Mesti\u00e7os of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe====\nMesti\u00e7os of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe are descendants of Portuguese colonists and enslaved Africans brought to the islands during the early years of settlement from Benin, Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Angola (these people also are known as {{lang|pt|filhos da terra}} or \"children of the land\").\n\n===Lusophone Asia===\n\n====Sri Lankan mesti\u00e7o====\nIn [[Sri Lanka]], the names [[Mesti\u00e7os (Sri Lanka)|''mesti\u00e7os'']] (Portuguese for \"mixed ethniicity\") or ''casados'' (\"married ones\") were applied to people of mixed Portuguese and Sri Lankan ([[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] and [[Tamil people|Tamil]]) descent, starting in the 16th century.\n\n==French-speaking North America==\n\n===M\u00e9tis of Canada===\n{{Main|M\u00e9tis (Canada)|Indian Act}}\n[[File:Louis Riel.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.55|[[Louis Riel]], Canadian M\u00e9tis.]]\nA [[French colonial empire|French Colonial empire]] in Canada, the M\u00e9tis are regarded as an independent ethnic group.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} This community of descent consists of individuals descended from marriages of [[First Nation]] women, specifically [[Cree]], [[Ojibwa]]y, and [[Saulteaux]] with Europeans, usually [[French Canadian|French]], [[English Canadian|English]], and [[Scottish Canadian|Scottish]] [[Engag\u00e9|laborers]] or merchants employed in the [[Fur Trade|North American Fur Trade]].{{citation needed|date=July 2010}} Their history dates to the mid 17th century, and they have been recognized as a distinct people since the early 18th century.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nTraditionally, the M\u00e9tis spoke a mixed language called [[Michif]] (with various regional dialects).

''The Disappearing Mestizo'', p. 247.</ref> In the modern era, it is used to denote the positive unity of race mixtures in modern Latin America. This ideological stance is in contrast to the term [[miscegenation]], which usually has negative connotations.<ref>Lewis, Stephen. \"Mestizaje\" in ''The Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 840.</ref>  The main ideological advocate of mestizaje was [[Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos]] (1882\u20131959), the Mexican Minister of Education in the 1920s. The term was in circulation in Mexico in the late nineteenth century, along with similar terms, ''cruzamiento'' (\"crossing\") and ''mestizaci\u00f3n'' (process of \"mestizo-izing\"). In Spanish America, the colonial-era system of castas sought to differentiate between individuals and groups on the basis of a hierarchical classification by ancestry, skin color, and status (''calidad''), giving separate labels to the perceived categorical differences and privileging whiteness. In contrast, the idea of modern ''mestizaje'' is the positive unity of a nation's citizenry based on racial mixture. \"Mestizaje placed greater emphasis [than the casta system] on commonality and hybridity to engineer order and unity\u2026 [it] operated within the context of the nation-state and sought to derive meaning from Latin America\u2019s own internal experiences rather than the dictates and necessities of empire... ultimately [it] embraced racial mixture.\"<ref>Vinson, Ben III. ''Before Mestizaje''. New York: Cambridge University Press 2018, pp. 61-2.</ref>\n\n===Mestizaje as an ideology in modern Mexico===\nAt independence in Mexico, the casta classifications were abolished, but discrimination based on skin color and socioeconomic status continued.  Liberal intellectuals grappled with the \u201cIndian Problem,\u201d that is the Indians\u2019 lack of cultural assimilation to Mexican national life as citizens of the nation rather than members of their indigenous communities. Urban elites spurned mixed-race urban plebeians and Indians along with their traditional popular culture. In the late nineteenth century during the rule of [[Porfiriato|Porfirio D\u00edaz]], elites\u2019 sought to be, act, and look like modern Europeans, that is, different from the majority of the Mexican population.  D\u00edaz was mixed race himself, but powdered his dark skin to hide his Mixtec indigenous ancestry.   At the end of the nineteenth century, however, as social and economic tensions increased in Mexico, two major works by Mexican intellectuals sought to rehabilitate the assessment of the mestizo. D\u00edaz\u2019s Minister of Education, [[Justo Sierra]] published ''The Political Evolution of the Mexican People'' (1902), which situated Mexican identity in the mixing of European whites and Indians. Mexicans are \"the sons of two peoples, of two races. [This fact] dominates our whole history; to this we owe our soul.\"<ref>Sierra, Justo. ''The Political Evolution of the Mexican People\u2019\u2019. Trans. Charles Ramsdell. Austin: University of Texas Press.  P. xvii.</ref>  Intellectual [[Andr\u00e9s Molina Enr\u00edquez]] also took a revisionist stance on mestizos in his work ''Los grandes problemas nacionales'' (The Great National Problems) (1909).  \n\nThe Mexican state after the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910\u201320) embraced the ideology of mestizaje as a nation-building tool, aimed at integrating Indians culturally and politically in the construction of national identity. As such it has meant a systematic effort to eliminate indigenous culture, in the name of integrating them into a supposedly inclusive mestizo identity.  For [[Afro-Mexicans]],  the ideology has denied their historical contributions to Mexico and their current place in Mexican political life. Mexican politicians and reformers such as [[Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos]] and [[Manuel Gamio]] were instrumental in building a Mexican national identity on the concept of \"mestizaje\" (the process of ethnic homogenization).<ref>{{cite book |last=Wade |first=Peter |year=1997 |title=Race and Ethnicity in Latin America |location=Chicago |publisher=Pluto Press |isbn=978-0-7453-0987-3 |page=32 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Knight |first=Alan |year=1990 |chapter=Racism, Revolution and ''indigenismo'': Mexico 1910\u20131940 |title=The Idea of Race in Latin America, 1870\u20131940 |editor-first=Richard |editor-last=Graham |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ideaofraceinlat000grah/page/78 78\u201385] |location=Austin |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=978-0-292-73856-0 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/ideaofraceinlat000grah/page/78 }}</ref>\n\nCultural policies in early post-revolutionary Mexico were paternalistic towards the indigenous people, with efforts designed to \"help\" indigenous peoples achieve the same level of progress as the Mestizo society, eventually assimilating indigenous peoples completely to mainstream Mexican culture, working toward the goal of eventually solving the \"Indian problem\" by transforming indigenous communities into Mestizo communities.<ref name=\"auto\"/>  \n\nIn recent years, mestizos\u2019 sole claim to Mexican national identity has begun to erode, at least rhetorically.\"<ref>Lewis, \"Mestizaje', p. 841.</ref>  A constitutional changes to Article 4 that now says that the \"Mexican Nation has a pluricultural composition, originally based on its indigenous peoples.

'''''mestiza''''') is a term historically used in [[Spain]] and [[Hispanic America]] that originally referred to a person of combined [[European colonization of the Americas|European]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American]] descent, regardless of where the person was born. The term was used as an ethnic/racial category for mixed-race ''[[casta]]s'' that evolved during the [[Spanish Empire]]. Although broadly speaking, ''mestizo'' means someone of mixed European/indigenous heritage, the term did not have a fixed meaning in the colonial period. It was a formal label for individuals in official documentation, such as censuses, parish registers, Inquisition trials, and other matters. Individuals were labeled by priests and royal officials as mestizos, but the term was also used for self identification.<ref>Rappaport, ''The Disappearing Mestizo'', p. 4</ref>\n\nIn the modern era, particularly in [[Hispanic America]], ''mestizo'' has become more of a cultural term, with the term '''Indian''' being reserved exclusively for people who have maintained a separate indigenous ethnic identity, [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|language]], tribal affiliation, etc. In late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Peru, for instance, ''mestizos'' were ethno-racial \"mixed\" peoples with access (usually monetary access, but not always) to secondary educational institutions. This conception changed by the 1920s with the national and spiritual ascension of ''[[Indigenismo#Indigenism_in_Peru|indigenismo]]''.\n\nThe term '''[[casta#mestizaje|mestizaje]]''' \u2013 taking as its root ''mestizo'' or mixed \u2013 came from the Latin word ''mixtus'', meaning mixed. It is the modern Spanish word coined in the twentieth century for race mixture or [[miscegenation]], the general process of mixing ancestries.<ref>Rappaport, Joanne, ''The Disappearing Mestizo'', p. 247.</ref>\n\nTo avoid confusion with the original usage of the term {{lang|es|mestizo}}, mixed people started to be referred to collectively as {{lang|es|castas}}. In some Latin American countries, such as [[Mexico]], the concept of the mestizo became central to the formation of a new independent identity that was neither wholly Spanish nor wholly indigenous, and the word ''mestizo'' acquired its current meaning, it being used by the government to refer to all Mexicans who do not speak [[Languages of Mexico|indigenous languages]],<ref name=\"EL MESTIZAJE Y LAS CULTURAS REGIONALES\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nacionmulticultural.unam.mx/Portal/Izquierdo/BANCO/Mxmulticultural/Elmestizajeylasculturas-elmestizaje.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823015618/http://www.nacionmulticultural.unam.mx/Portal/Izquierdo/BANCO/Mxmulticultural/Elmestizajeylasculturas-elmestizaje.html|url-status=dead|title=en el censo de 1930 el gobierno mexicano dej\u00f3 de clasificar a la poblaci\u00f3n del pa\u00eds en tres categor\u00edas raciales, blanco, mestizo e ind\u00edgena, y adopt\u00f3 una nueva clasificaci\u00f3n \u00e9tnica que distingu\u00eda a los hablantes de lenguas ind\u00edgenas del resto de la poblaci\u00f3n, es decir de los hablantes de espa\u00f1ol.|archivedate=23 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book |last=Bartolom\u00e9 |first=Miguel Alberto |year=1996 |chapter=Pluralismo cultural y redefinicion del estado en M\u00e9xico |title=Coloquio sobre derechos ind\u00edgenas |location=Oaxaca |publisher=IOC |isbn=978-968-6951-31-8 |chapterurl=http://courses.cit.cornell.edu/iard4010/documents/Pluralismo_cultural_y_redefinicion_del_estado_en_Mexico.pdf |page=5}}</ref> including people of complete European or indigenous descent as well as [[Asian Mexicans|Asians]] and [[Afro-Mexicans|Africans]].<ref name=\"Knight 1990:73\">{{cite book |last=Knight |first=Alan |year=1990 |chapter=Racism, Revolution and ''indigenismo'': Mexico 1910\u20131940 |title=The Idea of Race in Latin America, 1870\u20131940 |editor-first=Richard |editor-last=Graham |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ideaofraceinlat000grah/page/73 73] |location=Austin |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=978-0-292-73856-0 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/ideaofraceinlat000grah/page/73 }}</ref> While the caste system and racial classifications were officially abandoned once Mexico achieved its [[Independence of Mexico|independence]], the label mestizo was still used in academic circles: now to refer to all the people who were [[mixed race]]. It was in those academic circles that the \"Mestizaje\" or \"[[La Raza C\u00f3smica|Cosmic Race]]\" ideology was created, the ideology asserted that Mestizos are the result of the mixing of all the races. After the [[Mexican Revolution]] the government, on its attempts to create an unified Mexican identity with no racial distinctions adopted and actively promoted the \"Mestizaje\" ideology.<ref name=\"EL MESTIZAJE Y LAS CULTURAS REGIONALES\"/>\n\nThe [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] [[cognate]], ''[[mesti\u00e7o]]'', historically referred to any mixture of Portuguese and local populations in the [[Portuguese colonies]]. In [[colonial Brazil]] most of the non-enslaved population was initially ''[[caboclo|mesti\u00e7o de indio]]'', i.e. mixed Portuguese and native Brazilian. There was no descent-based casta system, and children of upper class Portuguese landlord males and enslaved females would enjoy privileges higher than the ones given to the lower classes, such as formal education, though such cases were not so common and they tended to not inherit property, generally given to the children of free women, who tended to be legitimate offspring in cases of concubinage (also a common practice, inherited from Amerindian and African customs).\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], which was a colony of Spain, the term [[Filipino mestizo|''mestizo'']] came to refer to a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] with any foreign ancestry, and usually shortened as ''[[Tisoy]]''.\n\nIn [[Indonesia]], the term mestizo refers to ethnicity which is a mixture of [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]]s and [[native Indonesian]]; they are usually referred to as the [[Indo people]].\n\nIn [[Ontario]] and western [[Canada]], the [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] people are a distinct community composed of the descendants of Europeans (usually French or Scottish, sometimes English) involved in the fur trade and Canadian First Nations peoples (especially [[Cree]] and [[Anishinaabe]]; it does not include people of mixed European and Inuit ancestry). As used in [[Quebec]], however, the term refers to anyone of mixed European (usually French) and First Nations ancestry.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe Spanish word {{lang|es|mestizo}} is from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''mixticius'', meaning mixed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mestizo |title=mestizo |year=2008 |work=Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated |quote=a person of mixed blood; specifically: a person of mixed European and American Indian indigenous ancestry}}</ref><ref name=\"dictionary.reference.com\">{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mestizo |title=Mestizo \u2013 Define Mestizo at Dictionary.com |work=Dictionary.com |accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref> Its usage has been documented as early as 1275, to refer to the offspring of an [[Egypt|Egyptian/Afro/Hamite]] and a [[Semitic people|Semite]]/Afro Asiatic.<ref name=\"AlfonsoX-p261R\">{{cite book |author=Alfonso X |title=General Estoria.

It is related to the particular racial identity of historical Amerindian-descended [[Hispanic and Latino American]] communities in an American context.\n\nIn English-speaking Canada, [[M\u00e9tis (Canada)|Canadian M\u00e9tis]] (with upper-case), as a loanword from French, refers to persons of mixed French and Indigenous ancestry. French-speaking Canadians, when using the word m\u00e9tis, are referring to [[M\u00e9tis (Canada)|Canadian M\u00e9tis]] ethnicity, and all persons of mixed Amerindian and European ancestry, rather than the broader concept of mixed people in general ({{lang|fr|m\u00e9tis}} with lowercase), present in all other French-speaking countries, as would speakers of Spanish; the usual term to refer to mixed-ethnicity people in general is thus \"mul\u00e2tre\", which is considered elsewhere pejorative. In the United States, [[M\u00e9tis people (United States)|M\u00e9tis Americans]] and [[Mestizos in the United States|Mestizo Americans]] are two distinct racial and [[racial identity|ethno-racial identities]], as reflected in the use of French and Spanish loanwords, respectively.\n\nIn the Philippines, the word ''mestizo'' usually refers to a Filipino with combined [[Ethnic groups in the Philippines|Indigenous]] and European ancestry, but occasionally it will be used for a Filipino with apparent Chinese ancestry, who will also be referred to as 'chinito'. The latter was officially listed as a \"mestizo de sangley\" in birth records of the 19th century, with 'sangley' as a reference to the [[Hokkienese]] word for business, 'seng-li'.\n\nIn the Portuguese-speaking world, the contemporary sense has been the closest to the historical usage from the Middle Ages, because of important linguistic differences, so that {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}} (mixed, mixed-ethnicity, miscegenation, etc.) is separated altogether from {{lang|pt|pardo}} (any kind of brown people) and {{lang|pt|caboclo}} (brown people originally of European\u2013Amerindian admixture or assimilated Amerindians), in which {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7os}} can be also fully African or East Asian in their full definition (thus not brown) and one does not need to be a {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}} to be a part of the latter two categories.\n\nIn Brazil specifically, at least in modern times all non-Indigenous people are part of a single ethnicity ({{lang|pt|os brasileiros}}; lines between ethnic groups are historically fluid), the {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}} ({{IPA-pt|me\u0283\u02c8t(\u0283)isu}}, {{IPA-pt|mi\u0283\u02c8t(\u0283)isu|}}) group is by far the largest among the free people since the earliest decades of the colony. As explained above, the concept of {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}} should not in any way be confused with the mestizo as used in either the Spanish-speaking world or the English-speaking one, as it relates no special relation to being of Amerindian extraction, and also should not be confused with {{lang|pt|pardo}}, literally \"brown people\" (there are {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7os}} among all major groups of the country, Indigenous, Asian, {{lang|pt|pardo}} and African, and they are likely the majority in the three latter ones).\n\nIn [[Saint Barth\u00e9lemy]], the term ''mestizo'' refers to people of mixed European (usually French) and East Asian ancestry.<ref name=SaintBarts1>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tb.html |title=Saint Barthelemy: People and Society |date=13 September 2012|work=The World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Cognates===\n{{lang|es|Mestizo}} ({{IPA-es|mes\u02c8ti\u03b8o|lang}} <small>or</small> {{IPA-es|mes\u02c8tiso|}}), {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}} ({{IPA-pt|m\u0268\u0283\u02c8tisu|lang}}, {{IPA-pt|mes\u02c8t(\u0283)isu|}} <small>or</small> {{IPA-pt|mi\u0283\u02c8t(\u0283)isu|}}), {{lang|fr|m\u00e9tis}} ({{IPA-fr|me\u02c8tis|lang}}), {{lang|ca|mest\u00eds}} ({{IPA-ca|m\u0259s\u02c8tis|lang}}), {{lang|de|Mischling}} ({{IPA-de|m\u026a\u0283\u02c8l\u026a\u014b\u0261|lang}}), {{lang|it|meticcio}} ({{IPA-it|me\u02c8titt\u0283o|lang}}), {{lang|nl|mestiezen}} ({{IPA-nl|m\u025bs\u02c8tiz\u0259(n)|lang}}), ''mestee'' ({{IPA-all|m\u0259s\u02c8ti\u02d0|Middle English:}}), and mixed (English) are all [[cognates]] of the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''mixticius''.\n\n==Mestizo as a colonial-era category==\n{{Main|Casta}}\n[[File:Castas 01mestiza max.jpg|thumb|From Spaniard and Indian woman, Mestiza.

Throughout the territories of [[Spanish Empire]] in the Americas, ways of differentiating individuals in a racial hierarchy, often called in the modern era the ''sistema de castas'' or the ''sociedad de castas'' developed where society was divided based on color, ''calidad'' (status) and other factors.  The main divisions were as follows:\n\n# ''Espa\u00f1ol'' (fem. espa\u00f1ola), i.e. [[Spaniards|Spaniard]] \u2013 person of Spanish or other European ancestry; a blanket term, subdivided into ''Peninsulares'' and ''Criollos''\n#*''[[Peninsulars|Peninsular]]'' \u2013 a European born in Spain who later settled in the Americas;\n#* ''[[Criollo people|Criollo]]'' (fem. criolla)&nbsp;\u2013 a Spanish or other European descent born in the Americas;\n# ''[[Castizo]]'' (fem. castiza) \u2013 a person with primarily European and some Amerindian ancestry born into a mixed family; the offspring of a castizo and an espa\u00f1ol was considered espa\u00f1ol. Offspring of a castizo/a of an Espa\u00f1ol/a returned to Espa\u00f1ol/a.\n# ''Mestizo'' (fem. mestiza) \u2013 a person of extended mixed European and Amerindian ancestry;\n# ''[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indio]]'' (fem. India) \u2013 a person of pure Amerindian ancestry;\n# ''[[Pardo]]'' (fem. parda) \u2013 a person of mixed White, Amerindian and African ancestry; sometimes a polite term for a black person;\n# ''[[Mulatto|Mulato]]'' (fem. mulata) \u2013 a person of mixed White, and African ancestry;\n# ''[[Zambo]]'' \u2013 a person of mixed African and Amerindian ancestry;\n# ''[[Negro]]'' (fem. negra)&nbsp;\u2013 a person of [[Atlantic slave trade|African]] descent, primarily former enslaved Africans and their descendants.\n\nIn theory, and as depicted in eighteenth-century Mexican casta paintings, ''espa\u00f1ol'' status could also be restored to the offspring of a Castizo/a [mixed Spanish - Mestizo] and an Espa\u00f1ol/a.<ref>M\u00f6rner, ''Race Mixture'', p.58.</ref>\n\n'''Racial labels in a set of eighteenth-century Mexican casta paintings by [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]]''':\n*'''De Espa\u00f1ol e India, nace Mestiza'''\n*'''De Espa\u00f1ol y Mestiza, nace Castiza'''\n*De Castizo y Espa\u00f1ola, nace Espa\u00f1ola\n*De Espa\u00f1ol y Negra, nace Mulata\n*De Espa\u00f1ol y Mulata, nace Morisca\n*De Espa\u00f1ol y Morisca, nace Albino\n*De Espa\u00f1ol y Albina, nace [[Torna atr\u00e1s]]\n*De Espa\u00f1ol y Torna atr\u00e1s, \"Tente en el ayre\"\n*De Negro y India, Chino Cambuja\n*De Chino Cambujo y India, [[Lobo (racial category)|Loba]]\n*De Lobo y India, Albarazado\n*'''De Albarazado y Mestiza, Barcino'''\n*De Indio y Barcina, Zambaiga\n*'''De Castizo y Mestiza, Chamizo'''\n*Indios Gentiles (Barbarian [[Chichimeca|Meco Indians]])\n\nIn the early colonial period, the offspring of Espa\u00f1oles and Indias were raised either in the Hispanic world, if the father recognized the offspring as his natural child; or the child was raised in the indigenous world of the mother if he did not.  As early as 1533, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] mandated the high court ([[Real Audiencia|Audiencia]]) to take the children of Spanish men and indigenous women from their mothers and educate them in the Spanish sphere.<ref name=\"auto1\">M\u00f6rner, ''Race Mixture'', p. 55.</ref> This mixed group born out of Christian wedlock increased in numbers, generally living in their mother's indigenous communities.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nMestizos were the first group in the colonial era to be designated as a separate category from European whites (Espa\u00f1oles) and enslaved African blacks (''Negros'') and were included in designation of \"vagabonds\" (''vagabundos'') in 1543 in Mexico. Although mestizos were often classified as ''castas'', they had a higher standing than any mixed-race person since they did not have to pay tribute, the men could be ordained as priests, and they could be licensed to carry weapons, in contrast to ''negros'', mulattoes, and other castas.  Unlike blacks and mulattoes, mestizos had no enslaved ancestors.<ref>Lewis, Laura A. ''Hall of Mirrors: Power, Witchcraft, and Caste in Colonial Mexico''. Durham: Duke University Press 2003, p. 84.</ref> Intermarriage between Espa\u00f1oles and mestizos resulted in offspring designated ''[[castizo]]s'' (\"three-quarters white\"), and the marriage of a castizo/a to an Espa\u00f1ol/a resulted in the restoration of Espa\u00f1ol/a status to the offspring. Don Alonso O\u2019Crouley observed in Mexico (1774), \"If the mixed-blood is the offspring of a Spaniard and an Indian, the stigma [of race mixture] disappears at the third step in descent because it is held as systematic that a Spaniard and an Indian produce a mestizo; a mestizo and a Spaniard, a castizo; and a castizo and a Spaniard, a Spaniard. The admixture of Indian blood should not indeed be regarded as a blemish, since the provisions&nbsp; of law give the&nbsp; Indian all&nbsp; that he could wish for,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Philip II granted to mestizos the privilege of becoming priests. On this consideration is based&nbsp;the&nbsp;common estimation of&nbsp; descent&nbsp; from a&nbsp; union of&nbsp; Indian and European or creole Spaniard.\"<ref>Sr. Don Pedro Alonso O\u2019Crouley, ''A Description of the Kingdom of New Spain'' (1774),trans. and ed. Sean Galvin. San Francisco: John Howell Books, 1972, 20</ref>&nbsp; O\u2019Crouley states that the same process of restoration of racial purity does not occur over generations for European-African offspring marrying whites. \u201cFrom the union of a Spaniard and a Negro the mixed-blood&nbsp; retains&nbsp; the stigma for generations without losing the original quality of a mulato.\"<ref>O\u2019Crouley, \u201cA Description of the Kingdom of New Spain\u2019\u2019, p. 20</ref>\n\nThe Spanish colonial regime divided groups into two basic legal categories, the Republic of Indians (''Rep\u00fablica de Indios'') and the Republic of Spaniards (''Rep\u00fablica de Espa\u00f1oles'') comprised European whites (Espa\u00f1oles) and all other non-Indians.  Indians were free vassals of the crown, whose commoners paid tribute while indigenous elites were considered nobles and tribute exempt, as were mestizos. Indians were nominally protected by the crown, with non-Indians\u2014mestizos, blacks, and mulattoes\u2014forbidden to live in indigenous communities. Mestizos and Indians in Mexico habitually held each other in mutual antipathy. This was particularly the case with commoner Indians against mestizos, some of whom infiltrated their communities and became part of the ruling elite. Spanish authorities turned a blind eye to the mestizos' presence, since they collected commoners' tribute for the crown and came to hold offices. They were useful intermediaries for the colonial state between the Republic of Spaniards and the Republic of Indians.<ref>Lewis, ''Hall of Mirrors'', pp. 86-91.</ref>\n\nA person's legal racial classification in colonial Spanish America was closely tied to social status, wealth, culture and language use. Wealthy people paid to change or obscure their actual ancestry.

The city was abandoned after Native repeatedly attacked and then resettled again in 1528, then completely abandoned and dismantled in 1545 and moved to modern day [[San Salvador]] City. The settlement resembles more of a fortified military base rather than a city. The historic census indicates that the city contained male Spaniards with many Mestizo children with Native American indigenous wives]]\n\nIn [[Central America]], intermarriage by European men with the Native American Indigenous [[Lenca]], [[Cacaopera people|Cacaopera]] and [[Pipil people|Pipil]] women of what is now [[El Salvador]] happened almost immediately after the arrival of the European [[Spaniards]] led by [[Pedro de Alvarado]]. Other indigenous groups in the country such as [[Maya peoples|Maya]] [[Poqomam people]], [[Maya peoples|Maya]] [[Ch'orti' people]], [[Alaguilac]], [[Xinca people]], [[Mixe]] and [[Mangue language]] people became culturally extinct due to the Mestizo process or diseases brought by the Spaniards. Mestizo culture quickly became the most successful and dominant culture in El Salvador. The majority of Salvadorans in modern El Salvador identify themselves as 86.3% Mestizo roots.<ref>[http://www.digestyc.gob.sv/servers/redatam/htdocs/CPV2007S/Docs/RESULTADOS_FINALES.pdf Ethnic Groups -2007 official Census]. Page 13, Digestyc.gob.sv</ref>\n\nIn 1932, ruthless dictator [[Maximiliano Hernandez Martinez]] was responsible for La Matanza (\"The Slaughter\"), known as the [[1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre]] in which the Native American indigenous people were murdered in an effort to wipe out the indigenous people in El Salvador during the 1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising. Indigenous peoples, mostly of Lenca, Cacaopera and Pipil descent are still present in El Salvador in several communities, conserving their languages, customs, and traditions.\n\nThere is a significant Arab population (of about 100,000), mostly from [[Palestinian Salvadoran|Palestine]] (especially from the area of Bethlehem), but also from Lebanon. Salvadorans of Palestinian descent numbered around 70,000 individuals, while Salvadorans of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] descent is around 27,000. There is also a small community of Jews who came to El Salvador from France, Germany, Morocco, Tunisia, and Turkey. Many of these Arab groups naturally mixed and contributed into the modern Salvadoran Mestizo population.\n\n[[Pardo]] is the term that was used in colonial El Salvador to describe a tri-racial Afro-Mestizo person of Indigenous, European, and African descent. El Salvador is the only country in Central America that does not have a significant African population due to many factors including El Salvador not having a Caribbean coast, and because of president [[Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez]], who passed racial laws to keep Afros and other peoples out of El Salvador, though [[Afro-Salvadoran|Salvadorans with African ancestry]], called Pardos, were already present in El Salvador, the majority are tri-racial Pardo Salvadorans who largely cluster with the Mestizo population. They have been mixed into and were naturally bred out by the general Mestizo population, which is a combination of a Mestizo majority and the minority of Pardo people, both of whom are racially mixed populations. A total of only 10,000 enslaved Africans were brought to El Salvador over the span of 75 years, starting around 1548, about 25 years after El Salvador's colonization. The enslaved Africans that were brought to El Salvador during the colonial times, eventually came to mix and merged into the much larger and vaster Mestizo mixed European Spanish/Native Indigenous population creating Pardo or Afromestizos who cluster with Mestizo people, contributing into the modern day Mestizo population in El Salvador, thus, there remains no significant extremes of African physiognomy among Salvadorans like there is in the other countries of Central America.\n\nToday, Salvadorans who are racially European, especially Mediterranean, as well as Native American indigenous people in El Salvador who do not speak indigenous languages nor have an indigenous culture, also tri-racial Pardo Salvadorans, and Salvadoran of Arab descent, also identify themselves as culturally Salvadoran Mestizo by absorption.\n\n====Guatemala====\n{{See also|Demographics of Guatemala}}\nThe Ladino population in [[Guatemala]] is officially recognized as a distinct ethnic group, and the Ministry of Education of Guatemala uses the following definition: \n<blockquote>\"The ladino population has been characterized as a heterogeneous population which expresses itself in the Spanish language as a maternal language, which possesses specific cultural traits of Hispanic origin mixed with indigenous cultural elements, and dresses in a style commonly considered as western.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.minedoc.gob.gt/administracion/dependencias/centrales/ccre/ccre_interculturalidad.htm |title=Reflexiones sobre el mestizaje y la identidad nacional en Centroam\u00e9rica: de la colonia a las R\u00e9publicas liberales |access-date=28 July 2008 |author=Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n (MINEDUC) |authorlink= |year=2008 |website= |pages= |language=Spanish |doi= |quote= }}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Spanish-speaking South America==\n\n===Argentina and Uruguay===\n{{main|Argentine people|Uruguayan people}}\nInitially colonial [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]] had a predominately mestizo population like the rest of the Spanish colonies, but due to a flood of European migration in the 19th century and the repeated intermarriage with Europeans the mestizo population became a so-called {{lang|es|castizo}} population.

In Southern Chile, the Mapuche, were one of the only Amerindian tribes in the Americas that were in continuous conflict with the [[Spanish Empire]] and did not submit to a European power.\n\nA public health book from the [[University of Chile]] states that 30% of the population is of White origin; mestizos are estimated to amount to a total of 65%, while Native Americans (Amerindians) comprise the remaining 5%.

With the passage of time these Spanish conquerors and succeeding Spanish colonists sired offspring with the local Amerindian population, since Spanish immigration did not initially include many White females to the colonies. In a couple of generations a predominately mestizo population emerged in Ecuador with a drastically declining Amerindian Population due to European diseases and wars.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n[[Afro-Ecuadorians]] ([[Zambos]] and [[Mulatto]]es), who are a minority in the country, can be found mostly in the [[Esmeraldas Province]], in the [[Valle del Chota]] of the [[Imbabura Province]], and as small communities of Afro-Ecuadorians living along the coastal areas as minorities.\n\nMestizos are by far the largest of all the ethnic groups, and comprise 71.9% of the current population. The next 28% of the population is comprised by four ethnic groups with about 7% each, the Montubios, Afro-Ecuadorian, Amerindian (Indigenous) and White.\n\n===Paraguay===\n{{main|Paraguayan people}}\nDuring the reign of [[Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Rodr\u00edguez de Francia]], the first consul of [[Paraguay]] from 1811 to 1840, he imposed a law that no Spaniard may intermarry with another Spaniard, and that they may only wed mestizos or Indians.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} This was introduced to eliminate any sense of racial superiority, and also to end the predominantly Spanish influence in Paraguay. De Francia himself was not a mestizo (although his paternal grandfather was [[Afro-Brazilian]]), but feared that racial superiority would create [[class division]] which would threaten his [[Autocracy|absolute rule]].\n\nAs a result of this, today 90% of Paraguay's population are mestizo, and the main language is the native [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]], spoken by 60% of the population as a first language, with Spanish spoken as a first language by 40% of the population, and fluently spoken by 75%, making Paraguay one of the most bilingual countries in the world. Although it did not had the exposition to [[miscegenation]] as de Francia wanted, after the tremendous decline of male population as a result of the [[War of the Triple Alliance]], European male worker \u00e9migr\u00e9s mixed with the female mestizo population so as that pushed a middle class of mestizo background largely accepted as a configuration of the country.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Peru===\n[[File:Mestizo.

The Mixed Ethnicty Day, or Mestizo Day (Dia do Mesti\u00e7o), on 27 June, is official event in States of Amazonas, Roraima e Para\u00edba and a holyday in two cities.\n\nOne of the most notorious group is the {{lang|pt|pardo}} (brown people), also informally known as {{lang|pt|moreno}} (tan skinned people; given its euphemism-like nature, it may be interpreted as offensive). They include mostly those of non-white skin color. Nevertheless, not all {{lang|pt|pardos}} are {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7os}}. For example, an Amerindian (initially and most often {{lang|pt|\u00edndio}}, often more formally {{lang|pt|ind\u00edgena}}, rarely {{lang|pt|amer\u00edndio}}, an East Indian ({{lang|pt|indiano}})) or a Filipino may be initially described as {{lang|pt|pardo/parda}} (in opposition to {{lang|pt|branco}}, white, {{lang|pt|negro}}, Afro, and {{lang|pt|amarelo}}, yellow) if his or her ethnicity is unknown, and it is testified by the initial discovery reports of Portuguese navigators. In the same way, {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}}, a term used to describe anyone with any degree of [[miscegenation]] in one's blood line, may apply to all said groups (that in Portugal and its ex-colonies, always depended solely on phenotype, meaning a brown person may have a full sibling of all other basic phenotypes and thus ethnic groups).\n\nImportant {{lang|pt|pardo}} groups in Brazil are the {{lang|pt|caboclos}} (largely contemporary usage) or {{lang|pt|mamelucos}} (largely archaic usage), the {{lang|pt|mulatos}}, and the {{lang|pt|cafuzos}}. The first group is composed of the culturally assimilated Amerindians as well as the ''brown-skinned'' descendants or children of both white or {{lang|pt|moreno}} (swarthy) people of otherwise White phenotype and Amerindians. They are an important group in the Northern (Amazon Basin) region, but also relatively numerous on the Northeastern and Center-Western ones. Then, those, neither Afro- nor fair-skinned, whose origins come from the admixture between White or {{lang|pt|morenos}} and Afros or {{lang|pt|cafuzos}}. The last group is composed of descendants of Amerindians or {{lang|pt|caboclos}} and Afros or other {{lang|pt|cafuzos}}. Finally, those whose origins possess a notorious level of European ancestry and in which neither Amerindian nor African phenotypical traces are much more present than each other are sometimes known as {{lang|pt|ju\u00e7aras}}.\n\n[[File:Ronaldo-14-05-2013.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Brazilian footballer [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]]]]\nThere are, however, important groups who are {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7os}} but not necessarily {{lang|pt|pardos}}. People of East Asian and non-Asian descent combined are known as {{lang|pt|ainokos}}, from the Japanese \"love (ai) child (ko)\" (also used for all children of illegitimate birth.  Mixed children are now largely referred to as \"half\" or [[h\u0101fu]]), though often, for those without contact with the term, {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o de}} [East Asian nationality/ethnicity] may also be used. {{lang|pt|[[Sarar\u00e1]]s}} differ from {{lang|pt|mulatos}} at being fair-skinned (rather than brown-skinned), and having non-straight [[blond]] or [[red hair]].\n\nOther people who are not brown (and thus not {{lang|pt|pardo}}), but also their phenotypes by anything other than skin, hair and eye color do not match white ones but rather those of people of color may be just referred to as {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}}, without specification to skin color with an identitarian connotation (there are the distinctions, though, of {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o claro}}, for the fair-skinned ones, and {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o moreno}}, for those of olive skin tones). In Brazilian censuses, those people may choose to identify mostly with {{lang|pt|branco}} (White) or {{lang|pt|pardo}} (brown) or leave the question on ethnic/color blank.\n\n===Lusophone Africa===\n\n====Angolan mesti\u00e7o====\nThe {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7o}} are primarily of mixed European, [[Jus soli|native]] born [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Precolonial history of Angola|Angolan]] or other [[Sub-Saharan Africans#Sub-Saharan Africa|indigenous African]] lineages. They tend to be Portuguese culturally and to have full Portuguese names.\n\nAlthough they make up about two percent of the population, they are the socially elite and racially privileged group in the country. Historically, {{lang|pt|mesti\u00e7os}} formed social and cultural allegiances with [[Colonial history of Angola|Portuguese colonists]] subsequently identifying with the Portuguese over and above their indigenous identities. Despite their loyalty, the ethnic group faced economic and political adversity at hands of the white population during times of economic hardship for whites. These actions lead to ostracizing Mesti\u00e7os from their inherited economic benefits which sparked the group to take a new sociopolitical direction.\n\nAcross the 500 year Portuguese presence in the country, the Mesti\u00e7o have retained their position of entitlement which is highly evident in the political, economic and [[Culture of Angola#Mesti\u00e7o|cultural]] hierarchy in present-day [[Angola]]. Their [[phenotype]] range is broad with a number of members possessing physical characteristics that are close to others within the indigenous Afro [[Demographics of Angola|non-mixed]] population. Since the Mesti\u00e7os are generally better educated than the rest of the indigenous Afro population, they exercise influence in government disproportionate to their numbers.\n\n====Bissau-Guinean mesti\u00e7o====\n1% of the population is of mixed African and Portuguese descent, [[Tamahaq language|Tamahaq]], and Arabic genetic influence ignored.\n\n====Mozambican mesti\u00e7o====\nA minority population of Mozambicans of mixed Bantu and Portuguese heritage.\n\n====Mesti\u00e7os of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe====\nMesti\u00e7os of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe are descendants of Portuguese colonists and enslaved Africans brought to the islands during the early years of settlement from Benin, Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Angola (these people also are known as {{lang|pt|filhos da terra}} or \"children of the land\").\n\n===Lusophone Asia===\n\n====Sri Lankan mesti\u00e7o====\nIn [[Sri Lanka]], the names [[Mesti\u00e7os (Sri Lanka)|''mesti\u00e7os'']] (Portuguese for \"mixed ethniicity\") or ''casados'' (\"married ones\") were applied to people of mixed Portuguese and Sri Lankan ([[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] and [[Tamil people|Tamil]]) descent, starting in the 16th century.\n\n==French-speaking North America==\n\n===M\u00e9tis of Canada===\n{{Main|M\u00e9tis (Canada)|Indian Act}}\n[[File:Louis Riel.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.55|[[Louis Riel]], Canadian M\u00e9tis.]]\nA [[French colonial empire|French Colonial empire]] in Canada, the M\u00e9tis are regarded as an independent ethnic group.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} This community of descent consists of individuals descended from marriages of [[First Nation]] women, specifically [[Cree]], [[Ojibwa]]y, and [[Saulteaux]] with Europeans, usually [[French Canadian|French]], [[English Canadian|English]], and [[Scottish Canadian|Scottish]] [[Engag\u00e9|laborers]] or merchants employed in the [[Fur Trade|North American Fur Trade]].{{citation needed|date=July 2010}} Their history dates to the mid 17th century, and they have been recognized as a distinct people since the early 18th century.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nTraditionally, the M\u00e9tis spoke a mixed language called [[Michif]] (with various regional dialects).

''The Disappearing Mestizo'', p. 247.</ref> In the modern era, it is used to denote the positive unity of race mixtures in modern Latin America. This ideological stance is in contrast to the term [[miscegenation]], which usually has negative connotations.<ref>Lewis, Stephen. \"Mestizaje\" in ''The Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 840.</ref>  The main ideological advocate of mestizaje was [[Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos]] (1882\u20131959), the Mexican Minister of Education in the 1920s. The term was in circulation in Mexico in the late nineteenth century, along with similar terms, ''cruzamiento'' (\"crossing\") and ''mestizaci\u00f3n'' (process of \"mestizo-izing\"). In Spanish America, the colonial-era system of castas sought to differentiate between individuals and groups on the basis of a hierarchical classification by ancestry, skin color, and status (''calidad''), giving separate labels to the perceived categorical differences and privileging whiteness. In contrast, the idea of modern ''mestizaje'' is the positive unity of a nation's citizenry based on racial mixture. \"Mestizaje placed greater emphasis [than the casta system] on commonality and hybridity to engineer order and unity\u2026 [it] operated within the context of the nation-state and sought to derive meaning from Latin America\u2019s own internal experiences rather than the dictates and necessities of empire... ultimately [it] embraced racial mixture.\"<ref>Vinson, Ben III. ''Before Mestizaje''. New York: Cambridge University Press 2018, pp. 61-2.</ref>\n\n===Mestizaje as an ideology in modern Mexico===\nAt independence in Mexico, the casta classifications were abolished, but discrimination based on skin color and socioeconomic status continued.  Liberal intellectuals grappled with the \u201cIndian Problem,\u201d that is the Indians\u2019 lack of cultural assimilation to Mexican national life as citizens of the nation rather than members of their indigenous communities. Urban elites spurned mixed-race urban plebeians and Indians along with their traditional popular culture. In the late nineteenth century during the rule of [[Porfiriato|Porfirio D\u00edaz]], elites\u2019 sought to be, act, and look like modern Europeans, that is, different from the majority of the Mexican population.  D\u00edaz was mixed race himself, but powdered his dark skin to hide his Mixtec indigenous ancestry.   At the end of the nineteenth century, however, as social and economic tensions increased in Mexico, two major works by Mexican intellectuals sought to rehabilitate the assessment of the mestizo. D\u00edaz\u2019s Minister of Education, [[Justo Sierra]] published ''The Political Evolution of the Mexican People'' (1902), which situated Mexican identity in the mixing of European whites and Indians. Mexicans are \"the sons of two peoples, of two races. [This fact] dominates our whole history; to this we owe our soul.\"<ref>Sierra, Justo. ''The Political Evolution of the Mexican People\u2019\u2019. Trans. Charles Ramsdell. Austin: University of Texas Press.  P. xvii.</ref>  Intellectual [[Andr\u00e9s Molina Enr\u00edquez]] also took a revisionist stance on mestizos in his work ''Los grandes problemas nacionales'' (The Great National Problems) (1909).  \n\nThe Mexican state after the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910\u201320) embraced the ideology of mestizaje as a nation-building tool, aimed at integrating Indians culturally and politically in the construction of national identity. As such it has meant a systematic effort to eliminate indigenous culture, in the name of integrating them into a supposedly inclusive mestizo identity.  For [[Afro-Mexicans]],  the ideology has denied their historical contributions to Mexico and their current place in Mexican political life. Mexican politicians and reformers such as [[Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos]] and [[Manuel Gamio]] were instrumental in building a Mexican national identity on the concept of \"mestizaje\" (the process of ethnic homogenization).<ref>{{cite book |last=Wade |first=Peter |year=1997 |title=Race and Ethnicity in Latin America |location=Chicago |publisher=Pluto Press |isbn=978-0-7453-0987-3 |page=32 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Knight |first=Alan |year=1990 |chapter=Racism, Revolution and ''indigenismo'': Mexico 1910\u20131940 |title=The Idea of Race in Latin America, 1870\u20131940 |editor-first=Richard |editor-last=Graham |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ideaofraceinlat000grah/page/78 78\u201385] |location=Austin |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=978-0-292-73856-0 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/ideaofraceinlat000grah/page/78 }}</ref>\n\nCultural policies in early post-revolutionary Mexico were paternalistic towards the indigenous people, with efforts designed to \"help\" indigenous peoples achieve the same level of progress as the Mestizo society, eventually assimilating indigenous peoples completely to mainstream Mexican culture, working toward the goal of eventually solving the \"Indian problem\" by transforming indigenous communities into Mestizo communities.<ref name=\"auto\"/>  \n\nIn recent years, mestizos\u2019 sole claim to Mexican national identity has begun to erode, at least rhetorically.\"<ref>Lewis, \"Mestizaje', p. 841.</ref>  A constitutional changes to Article 4 that now says that the \"Mexican Nation has a pluricultural composition, originally based on its indigenous peoples.
