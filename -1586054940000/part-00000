Kissinger was an international citizen. Nixon very much a classic American. Kissinger had a worldview and a facility for adjusting it to meet the times, Nixon had pragmatism and a strategic vision that provided the foundations for their policies.

In that period, he extended the policy of ''[[d\u00e9tente]]''. This policy led to a significant relaxation in US\u2013Soviet tensions and played a crucial role in 1971 talks with Chinese Premier [[Zhou Enlai]]. The talks concluded with a [[rapprochement]] between the United States and the People's Republic of China, and the formation of a new strategic anti-Soviet Sino-American alignment.

One such years-long backchannel was conducted through the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, [[Anatoly Dobrynin]]. One historian argues that Kissinger formed such a strong \"bond of affection, trust, and mutual interest\" with the ambassador that he came to see U.S.-Soviet relations as holding exaggerated significance.

By promising to continue the peace talks which Johnson began in May 1968 in Paris Nixon admitted that he had ruled out \"a military victory\" in Vietnam..{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=582}} Nixon wanted a diplomatic settlement similar to the armistice of Panmunjom that ended the Korean War and frequently stated in private he had no intention of being \"the first president of the United States to lose a war\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=582}} To force the North Vietnamese to sign an armistice, Nixon favored a two-pronged approach of the \"madman theory\" of seeking to act rashly to intimidate the North Vietnamese while at the same time trying using the strategy of \"linkage\" to improve relations with the Soviet Union and China in order to persuade both these nations to stop sending arms to North Vietnam..{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=582\u2013583}}  In office, and assisted by Kissinger, Nixon implemented a policy of [[Vietnamization]] that aimed to gradually withdraw U.S. troops while expanding the combat role of the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|South Vietnamese Army]] so that it would be capable of independently defending its government against the [[Viet Cong|National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam]], a Communist guerrilla organization, and the North Vietnamese army ([[Vietnam People's Army]] or PAVN).\n\nIn an article published in ''Foreign Affairs'' in January 1969, Kissinger criticized General William Westmoreland's attrition strategy because the Vietnamese Communists were willing to accept far higher losses on the battlefield than the United States and could therefore \"win\" as long as they did not \"lose\" by merely keeping the war going.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=588}} In the same article, he argued that losses endured by the Vietnamese Communists in the Tet Offensive were meaningless as the Tet Offensive had turned American public opinion against the war, ruling out the possibility of a military solution, and the best that could be done now was to negotiate the most favorable peace settlement at the Paris peace talks.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=587}} Kissinger, when he came into office in 1969 favored a negotiating strategy under which the United States and North Vietnam would sign an armistice and agreed to pull their troops out of South Vietnam while the South Vietnamese government and the Viet Cong were to agree to a coalition government.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=588}} Kissinger had doubts about Nixon's theory of \"linkage\", believing that this would give the Soviet Union leverage over the United States and unlike Nixon was less concerned about the ultimate fate of South Vietnam.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=588\u2013589}} One of Kissinger's first acts as National Security Adviser in early 1969 was to seek opinions of the Vietnam experts within the CIA, the military and the State Department.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=589}} The lengthy volume that emerged contained a diverse collection of opinions with some stating the South Vietnamese were making \"rapid strides\" while others doubted that the government in Saigon would \"ever constitute an effective political or military counter to the Vietcong\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=589}} The \"bulls\" estimated that American troops would need to fight on in Vietnam for 8.3 years before the South Vietnamese would be able to fight on their own while the \"bears\" estimated it take 13.4 years of American troops fighting in Vietnam before the South Vietnamese would be able to fight on their own.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=589}} Kissinger passed the volume on to Nixon with the comment that there was no consensus within the expert community with the implied conclusion that he should be free on his own without consulting the experts.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=589}}\n\nIn early 1969, Kissinger was opposed to the plans for [[Operation Menu]], the bombing of Cambodia, fearing that Nixon was acting rashly with no plans for the diplomatic fall-out, but on 16 March 1969 Nixon at a meeting at the White House attended by Kissinger announced the bombing would start the next day.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=591}} As Congress was unlikely to grant approval to bombing Cambodia, Nixon decided to go ahead without Congressional approval and keep the bombings secret, a decision that several constitutional law experts argued was illegal.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=592}} In May 1969, the bombing was leaked to [[William M. Beecher]] of the ''New York Times'' who published an article about it, which infuriated Kissinger.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=592}} At the time, Kissinger told the FBI director J.E. Hoover \"we will destroy whoever did this\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=592}} As a result, the phones of 13 members of Kissinger's staff were taped by the FBI without a warrant.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=592}} At the time, Kissinger portrayed himself to his friends at Harvard as a moderating force who was working to remove the United States from Vietnam, saying he did not want to end up like his predecessor W.W. Rostow, whose actions as National Security Adviser had caused him to be ostracized by the liberal American intelligentsia.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}}\n\nAs part of the \"linkage\" concept, Kissinger in March 1969 sent [[Cyrus Vance]] to Moscow with the message that if the Soviet Union pressured North Vietnam into a diplomatic settlement favorable to the United States, the reward would be concessions on the talks on limiting the nuclear arms race.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=592\u2013593}} At the same time, Kissinger met with the Soviet ambassador [[Anatoly Dobrynin]] to warn him that Nixon was a dangerous man who wanted to escalate the Vietnam war.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=593}} Nixon and Kissinger played a \"good cop-bad cop\" routine with Dobrynin with Nixon acting the part of the petulant president at the end of his patience with North Vietnam while Kissinger acted as the reasonable diplomat anxious to improve relations with the Soviet Union, saying to Dobrynin in May 1969 that Nixon would \"escalate the war\" if the Soviet Union \"didn't produce a settlement\" in Vietnam.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=595}} At another meeting in 1969, Kissinger warned Dobrynin that \"the train has just left the station and is now headed down the track\", saying the Soviet Union better start pressuring North Vietnam now before Nixon did something truly reckless and dangerous.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=593}} The attempt at \"linkage\" failed as the Soviet Union did not pressure North Vietnam and instead Dobrynin told Kissinger that the Soviets wanted better relations with the United States regardless of the Vietnam war.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=593}} After the failure of the \"linkage\" attempt, Nixon became more open to the alternative strategy suggested by the Defense Secretary [[Melvin Laird]] who argued that the burden of the war should be shifted to the South Vietnamese, which was initially called \"de-Americanization\" and which Laird renamed Vietnamization because it sounded better.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=594}}\n\nOn 4 August 1969, Kissinger met secretly with [[Xu\u00e2n Th\u1ee7y]] at the Paris apartment of [[Jean Sainteny]] to discuss peace.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=597}} Kissinger repeated the American offer of \"mutual withdrawal\" of U.S and North Vietnamese forces from South Vietnam which Th\u1ee7y rejected while Th\u1ee7y demanded a new government in Saigon which Kissinger rejected.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=597}} &nbsp;Kissinger had a low opinion of North Vietnam, saying \"I can't believe that a fourth-rate power like North Vietnam doesn't have a breaking point\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}} Kissinger was opposed to the strategy of Vietnamization, expressing some doubt about the ability of the ARVN (Army of the Republic of Vietnam-i.e. the South Vietnamese Army) to hold the field, causing much tension with Defense Secretary Laird who was deeply committed to Vietnamization.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}}  In September 1969, Kissinger in a memo advised Nixon against \"de-escalation\", saying that keeping U.S troops fighting in Vietnam \"remains one of our few bargaining weapons\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}} In the same memo, Kissinger stated he was \"deeply disturbed\" that Nixon had started pulling out U.S. troops, saying that withdrawing the troops was like \"salted peanuts\" to the American people, \"the more U.S troops come home, the more will be demanded\", giving the advantage to the enemy who merely had to \"wait us out\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}} Instead, he recommenced that the United States resume bombing North Vietnam and mine the coast.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}} Later in September 1969, Kissinger proposed a plan for what he called a \"savage, punishing\" blow against North Vietnam code-named [[Duck Hook]] to Nixon, arguing that this was the best way to force North Vietnam to agree to peace on American terms.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}} Laird was strongly opposed to Duck Hook, warning Nixon that the use of nuclear weapons to kill a massive number of North Vietnamese civilians would alienate American public opinion from the administration and persuaded Nixon to reject it.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}} Reflecting his background as a Harvard professor of political science who belonged to the ''Primat der Aussenpolitik'' school which saw foreign policy as belonging only to a small elite, Kissinger was less sensitive to public opinion than Laird, a former Republican congressman who constantly advised Nixon to keep American public opinion in mind.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}}\n\nKissinger played a key role in [[Operation Menu|bombing Cambodia]] to disrupt PAVN and Viet Cong units launching raids into South Vietnam from within Cambodia's borders and resupplying their forces by using the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]] and other routes, as well as the 1970 [[Cambodian Incursion]] and subsequent widespread bombing of [[Khmer Rouge]] targets in Cambodia. The Paris peace talks had become stalemated by late 1969 owing to the obstructionism of the South Vietnamese delegation who wanted the talks to fail.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=624}} The South Vietnamese President [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u]] did not want the United States to withdraw from Vietnam, and out of frustration with him, Kissinger decided to begin secret peace talks in Paris parallel to the official talks that the South Vietnamese were unaware of.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=623}} On 21 February 1970, Kissinger secretly met in a modest house in a Paris suburb [[L\u00ea \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1ecd]], the North Vietnamese diplomat who was to become his most tenacious adversary.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=623}} In 1981, Kissinger told the journalist [[Stanley Karnow]]: \"I don't look back on our meetings with any great joy, yet he was a person of substance and discipline who defended the position he represented with dedication\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=623}} Not until February 1971 were Rogers and Laird first informed of the parallel peace talks in Paris.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=623}} Kissinger was to meet Tho three times between February-April 1970, and the North Vietnamese first sensed a softening of the American position during these talks as Kissinger slightly altered the \"mutual withdrawal formula\" that the Americans had previously held to.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=625}}&nbsp;Nixon was gravely disappointed that the secret talks in Paris did not have the prompt results he wanted.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=607}} Kissinger wrote in his memoirs that \"historians rarely do justice to the psychological stress on a policy-maker\", noting that by early 1970 Nixon was feeling very much besieged and inclined to lash out against a world he was believed was plotting his downfall.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=606}} Nixon had become obsessed with the film ''Patton'', seeing how the film presented Patton as a solitary and misunderstood genius whom the world did not appreciate a parallel to himself and kept watching the film over and over again.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=607}}\n\nOn 18 March 1970, the Prime Minister of Cambodia, [[Lon Nol]] carried out a coup against King Sihanouk and ultimately declared Cambodia a republic.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=604\u2013605}} Out of fury with Lon Nol, the king went to Beijing where he allied himself to his former enemies, the Khmer Rouge, calling upon the Khmer people to \"liberate our motherland\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=606}} As the most of the Khmer peasantry regarded the king as a god-like figure, the royal endorsement of the Khmer Rouge had immediate results. Cambodia had descended into chaos by late March 1970 as Lon Nol regime to prove its nationalist credibility organized pogroms against the Vietnamese minority, leading the North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong to attack and defeat Cambodia's weak army.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=606}} Nixon believed in the situation in Cambodia offered the chance for him to be like Patton by doing something bold and risky.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=606\u2013607}} Kissinger was initially ambivalent about Nixon's plans to invade Cambodia, but as he saw the president was committed, he became more and more supportive.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=608}} On 23 April 1970, Nixon in a memo to Kissinger declared \"we need a bold move in Cambodia to show that we stand with Lon Nol\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=608}}\n\nOn 26 April 1970, Nixon decided to \"go for broke\" by invading Cambodia with U.S troops.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=608}} When Nixon's speech-writer [[William Safire]] pointed out that the use of U.S. troops violated the Nixon Doctrine that America's Asian allies should do the fighting, Kissinger snapped at him: \"We wrote the goddamn doctrine, we can change it!\"{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=609}} Kissinger was under immense strain as several of his aides were planning to resign to protest the invasion of Cambodia, his liberal friends from Harvard were pressuring him to resign as well while Nixon was all for more belligerence.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=609}} Kissinger received a phone call from Nixon and his best friend, [[Bebe Rebozo|Charles \"Bebe\" Rebozo]], who both sounded very drunk; Nixon began the call and then handed the phone to Rebozo who said: \"The President wants you to know if this doesn't work, Henry, it's your ass\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=609}} On 30 April 1970, the United States invaded Cambodia which Nixon announced in a television address that Kissinger contemptuously called \"vintage Nixon\" because of his overblown rhetoric.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=609}} At the time, Nixon was seen as recklessly escalating the war and in early May 1970 the largest protests ever against the Vietnam war took place.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=611}} Four of Kissinger's aides resigned in protest while the Cambodian \"incursion\" ended several of Kissinger's friendships with colleagues from Harvard when he chose not to resign.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=611}} Nixon in his memoirs claimed that Kissinger \"took a particularly hard line\" with regards to the \"Cambodian incursion\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=611}} Roger Morris, one of Kissinger's aides later recalled that he was frightened by the huge anti-war demonstrations, comparing the antiwar movement to Nazis.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=611}} Kissinger was haunted by memories of his youth in Germany, and had a deep distrust of mass movements of either the left or the right, favoring the Primat der Aussenpolitik school of foreign-policy making by an elite with the masses excluded. In his interview with Karnow, Kissinger maintained he felt torn about where he stood and blamed Nixon for his failure to find \"the language of respect and compassion that might have created a bridge at least to the more reasonable elements of the antiwar movement\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=611}}\n\nThe Cambodian \"incursion\" saw American and South Vietnamese take the areas of eastern Cambodia that American commanders called the Fish Hook and Parrot's Beak and captured an impressive haul of arms originating from China and the Soviet Union.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=609\u2013610}} But the majority of Vietnamese Communist forces had withdrawn deeper into Cambodia before the invasion with only a small number left behind to wage a fighting retreat to avoid charges of cowardice.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=609\u2013610}} In June 1970, the Americans pulled out of Cambodia and the Vietnamese Communists returned, through the loss of weapons greatly hindered their operations in the Saigon area for the rest of 1970.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=610 & 625}} Having committed itself to supporting Lon Nol, the United States now had two allies instead of one to support in Southeast Asia.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=612}}\n\nThe bombing campaign in Cambodia contributed to the chaos of the [[Cambodian Civil War]], which saw the forces of leader [[Lon Nol]] unable to retain foreign support to combat the growing Khmer Rouge insurgency that would overthrow him in 1975.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Totten |first1=Samuel |last2=Parsons |first2=William S. |last3=Charny |first3=Israel W. |title=Century of Genocide: Critical Essays and Eyewitness Accounts |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2004 |page=349 |isbn=978-0-415-94430-4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5Ef8Hrx8Cd0C&pg=PA349 |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Smyth |first1=Marie |last2=Robinson |first2=Gillian |title=Researching Violently Divided Societies: Ethical and Methodological Issues |publisher=[[United Nations University Press]] |year=2001 |page=93 |isbn=978-92-808-1065-3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZWqNwsv6AIQC&pg=PA93 |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}</ref> Documents uncovered from the Soviet archives after 1991 reveal that the North Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1970 was launched at the explicit request of the Khmer Rouge and negotiated by [[Pol Pot]]'s then second in command, [[Nuon Chea]].<ref>Dmitry Mosyakov, \"The Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese Communists: A History of Their Relations as Told in the Soviet Archives\", in Susan E.

The ARVN invaded Laos on 8 February 1971 and were stopped decisively by the North Vietnamese.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=629\u2013630}} In March, Kissinger sent his deputy Haig to inspect the situation personally, leading him to report that the ARVN officers lacked courage and did not want to fight, making retreat the only option.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=630}}&nbsp;The retreat when it began turned into a rout.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=630}} Kissinger wrote Lam Son had fallen \"far short of our expectations\", which he blamed on bad American planning, poor South Vietnamese tactics and Nixon's leadership style, leading Karnow to write he blamed \"everyone, characteristically, except himself\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=631}}\n\nIn late May 1971, Kissinger returned to Paris to fruitlessly meet again with Tho.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} The North Vietnamese demand that Thi\u1ec7u step down proved to the main obstacle.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} Kissinger did not want a repeat of the prolonged bout of political instability that characterized South Vietnam from 1963 to 1967 and believed Thi\u1ec7u was a force for order.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} Tho suggested to Kissinger that Americans \"stop supporting\"  Thi\u1ec7u who was running for the reelection in a ballot scheduled for 3 October 1971.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} Tho claimed that Thi\u1ec7u's opponents, Air Marshal [[Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3]] and General [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh]] aka \"Big Minh\", were both open to a coalition government with the Viet Cong and had if either men were elected president, the war would be over by late 1971.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} Thi\u1ec7u used a legal technicality to disqualify K\u1ef3 while Minh dropped out when it was clear the election was rigged.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} In the 1971 election, the CIA donated money for Thi\u1ec7u's reelection campaign while the Americans did not pressure Thi\u1ec7u to stop rigging the election.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}} Through Kissinger did not regard South Vietnam as important in its own right, he believed it was necessary to support South Vietnam to maintain the United States as a global power, believing that none of America's allies would trust the United States if South Vietnam were abandoned too quickly.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} Kissinger also believed that if South Vietnam were to collapse, it \"leave deep scars on our society, feeling impulses for recrimination\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} As a Jew who had grown up in Nazi Germany, Kissinger was haunted by how the ''Dolchsto\u00dflegende'' had used by the German right to delegitimatize the Weimar Republic, and believed that something similar would happen in the United States should it lose the Vietnam War, fueling the rise of right-wing extremism.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}}\n\nIn June 1971, Kissinger supported Nixon's effort to ban the [[Pentagon Papers]] saying the \"hemorrhage of state secrets\" to the media was making diplomacy impossible.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=633}} [[Daniel Ellsberg]], the man who leaked the Pentagon Papers to the ''New York Times'' had been consulted by Kissinger for ideas about Vietnam in late 1968-early 1969, but when he leaked the papers, Kissinger told Nixon that he was a left-wing \"fanatic\" and a \"drug abuser\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=633}} Kissinger depicted Ellsberg to Nixon as a drug-crazed degenerate of questionable mental stability out to ruin his administration. Reflecting his increasingly frustration with the war, Nixon often talked to Kissinger in a bloodthirsty manner about a \"fantasy holocaust\" in which he would have U.S. forces kill every living thing in North Vietnam and then pull out, leading the latter appalled by his own account.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}}\n\nBy early 1972, Nixon boosted that he had pulled out 400, 000 U.S soldiers from Vietnam since July 1969, and battle deaths had fallen from an average of 200 per week in 1969 down to an average of 10 per week in 1972.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}} The policy of Vietnamization had, as Laird predicted it would, tamed the antiwar movement as most Americans objected not to war in Vietnam per se, only to Americans dying in it.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}} With the antiwar movement in decline by 1972, Nixon believed his chances of reelection were good, but Kissinger kept complaining that he was losing \"negotiating assets\" in his talks with Tho every time a withdrawal of American forces was announced.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}}  Likewise, Kissinger noted that the major reason why Congress despite the antiwar feelings of many of its members kept voting to fund the war was because the argument it was patriotic to support \"our boys in the field\"; as more Americans were pulled out, Congress was less inclined to vote to fund keeping South Vietnamese \"boys in the field\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}} However, the imperatives of being re-elected was far more important to Nixon than with giving Kissinger \"negotiating assets\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}} In early 1972, Nixon publicly revealed that Kissinger had secretly negotiating with Tho since 1970 to prove that he was really was committed to peace in Vietnam despite what the antiwar movement had been saying about him for the last three years.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}} Reflecting Kissinger's weakening hand in his talks with Tho, Nixon had increasingly come by 1971\u201372 to believe that \"linkage\" concept of improving relations with the Soviet Union and China in exchange for those nations cutting off the supply of weapons to North Vietnam offered his best chance of a favorable peace deal.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}}\n\nOn 21 February 1972 was in Nixon's words \"the week that changed the world\" as he landed in Beijing to meet [[Mao Zedong]].{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=638}} Kissinger who accompanied Nixon to China spent much time talking to the suave Chinese Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] about Vietnam, pressing him to end the supply of arms to North Vietnam.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=638}} The talks went nowhere as Zhou told Kissinger that the North Vietnamese played off China against the Soviet Union, and to cut off North Vietnam would allow it to fall into the Soviet sphere of influence.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=638}} As the Chinese People's Liberation Army had badly bloodied by the Red Army in a border war in 1969, Zhou stated that to face a two-front war with Chinese forces facing North Vietnam in the south and the Soviet Union in the north was not acceptable to his government.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=638}} Zhou offered Kissinger only the vague message that China supported efforts to find peace in Vietnam while refusing to make any promises, though Kissinger also noted that Zhou declined to endorse North Vietnam's demands.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=638}} Despite Nixon's coming visit, in late 1971 the Chinese drastically increased their military aid to North Vietnam and continued to send a massive amount of weapons south even as Nixon and Kissinger exchanged pleasantries with Mao and Zhou in Beijing.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=639}}&nbsp;As usual, when the Chinese increased their supply of arms to North Vietnam, the Soviet Union did likewise as both Communist states competed with one another for influence in Hanoi by tying to be the biggest supplier of weapons.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=639}} On 30 March 1972, the PAVN launched the [[Easter Offensive]] that overran several provinces in South Vietnam while pushing the ARVN to the brink of collapse.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=640\u2013642}}\n\nAt the time of the Easter Offensive, Kissinger was deeply involved in planning for Nixon's visit to Moscow in May 1972. The offensive brought to the fore the differences between Nixon and Kissinger. Nixon threatened to cancel his summit with [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in Moscow if the Soviet Union did not force North Vietnam to end the Easter Offensive at once, saying: \"Whatever else happens, we cannot lose this war. The summit isn't worth a damn if the price for it is losing in Vietnam\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=644}} Nixon in his instructions to Kissinger stated that he viewed the relations with the Soviet Union through the prism of the Vietnam war and if the Soviets were not prepared to help, Kissinger \"should just pack up and come home\"..{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=644}} Kissinger for his part believed that Nixon was massively exaggerating Soviet influence in North Vietnam and not longer believed if he ever did in Nixon's \"linkage\" concept.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=644}} Kissinger feared that Nixon was obsessed with Vietnam and damaging relations with the Soviet Union over Vietnam would destabilize the international power balance by increasing American-Soviet tensions.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=644}} On 20 April 1972, Kissinger arrived in Moscow without informing the U.S. ambassador [[Jacob D. Beam]], and then went to have tea with Brezhnev in the Kremlin.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=644}} Nixon as usual when under stress departed for a marathon drinking session with Rebozo at Camp David, and via Haig kept sending messages to Kissinger to be tough with Brezhnev.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=644}} As no American president had ever visited Moscow before, Kissinger got the impression that Brezhnev wanted the planned summit to happen \"at almost any cost\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=644}} Kissinger's implemented Nixon's emphasis on building an amicable personal relationship with Brezhnev.<ref>Barbara Keys,  \"Nixon/Kissinger and Brezhnev.\" ''Diplomatic History'' 42.4 (2018): 548-551.</ref>  Upon his return to Washington, Kissinger reported that Brezhnev would not cancel the summit and was keen to sign the SALT I Treaty.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} Kissinger went to Paris on 3 May to meet Tho with orders from Nixon that North Vietnam must \"Settle or else!\"{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} Nixon complained that Kissinger was \"obsessed\" with the need for a peace treaty while he charged that he now wished he followed his instincts to bomb North Vietnam in 1970, saying if he had done so, the war would have been over by now.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} On 2 May 1972, the PAVN had captured Quangtri, an important provincial city in South Vietnam, and as a result of this victory, Tho was in no mood for a compromise.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} Through Kissinger in general shared Nixon's determination to be tough, he was afraid that the president would overreact and destroy the budding d\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union and China by striking too hard at North Vietnam.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} Moreover, after the rupture caused by the Cambodian incursion, Kissigner was trying hard to rebuilt his relations with the liberal American intelligentsia, saying he did want to become \"this administration's Walt Rostow\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} Kissinger's predecessor, Rostow had once being a professor at Harvard, Oxford the MIT, and Cambridge, but serving as the National Security Adviser had shunned by the Ivy League universities and ended up at the lowly University of Texas, a fate that Kissinger was determined to avoid.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} On 5 May 1972, Nixon ordered the U.S. Air Force to start bombing Hanoi and Haiphong and on 8 May ordered the U.S Navy to mine the coast of North Vietnam.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} As the bombings and mining of North Vietnam, Nixon and even more so Kissinger waited anxiously for the Soviet reaction, and much to their relief received only the standard statement decrying the American action and a diplomatic note complaining that American aircraft had bombed a Soviet freighter in Haiphong harbor.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=646}} The Moscow summit was not canceled.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=646}}\n\nOn 24 July 1972, Congress passed an act calling for the total withdraw of all American forces from Vietnam once all of the American POWs in North Vietnam were released, causing Kissinger to say the North Vietnamese only had to wait until \"Congress voted us of the war\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=646}} However, the sight of Nixon and Kissinger posing for photographs with Brezhnev and Mao deeply worried the North Vietnamese who were afraid of being \"sold out\" by either China and/or the Soviet Union, causing some flexibility in their negotiating tactics.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=646}} The Eastern Offensive had not caused the collapse of the South Vietnamese government, but it increased the amount of territory under Communist control.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=647}} The North Vietnamese were moving towards taking up the \"standstill ceasefire\" offer and ordered the Viet Cong to seize as much territory as possible in preparation for a \"leopard's spot\" ceasefire (so called because the patchwork of territories controlled by the Viet Cong and the Saigon government resembled the spots on a leopard's fur).{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=647}} On 1 August 1972, Kissinger met Tho again in Paris, and for first time, he seemed willing to compromise, saying that political and military terms of an armistice could be treated separately and hinted that his government was no longer willing to make the overthrow of Thi\u1ec7u a precondition.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=647}}\n\nOn the evening of 8 October 1972 at a secret meeting of Kissinger and Tho in a house in the Paris suburb of Gif-sur-Yvette once owned by the painter Fernard L\u00e9ger&nbsp;came the decisive breakthrough in the talks.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=647\u2013648}} Tho believed that Kissinger was as he later it put \"in a rush\"&nbsp;for a peace deal before the presidential election, and began with he called \"a very realistic and very simple proposal\" for a ceasefire that would see the Americans pull all their forces out of Vietnam in exchange for the release of all the POWs in North Vietnam.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}} As for the ultimate fate of South Vietnam, Tho proposed the creation of a \"council of national reconciliation\" that would govern the nation, but in the meantime Thi\u1ec7u could stay in power until the council was formed while a \"leopard's spot\" ceasefire would come into effect with the Viet Cong and the Saigon government controlling whatever territories they were had at the time of the ceasefire.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}} The \"mutual withdrawal formula\" was to be disregarded with PAVN forces to stay in South Vietnam with Tho giving Kissinger a vague promise that no more supplies would be sent down the Ho Chi Minh Trail.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}} Kissinger accepted Tho's offer as the most best deal possible, saying that the \"mutual withdrawal formula\" had to be abandoned as it been \"unobtainable through ten years of war...We could not make it a condition for a final settlement. We had long passed that threshold\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}} Several of Kissinger's own staff, most notably [[John Negroponte]], were strongly opposed to him accepting this offer, saying Kissinger had given away more than he had obtained.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}} In response to Negronponte's objections, Kissinger exploded in rage, accusing him of \"nit-picking\" and screamed at the top of his voice: \"You don't understand. I want to meet their terms. I want to reach an agreement. I want to end this war before the election. It can be done and it will be done...What do you want us to do? Stay there forever?\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}}\n\nReflecting the \"leopard's spot\" ceasefire, Kissinger sent Thi\u1ec7u a message saying he should \"seize as much territory as possible\" before the ceasefire came into effect while the United States launched Operation Enhance Plus to give South Vietnam as many weapons as possible.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=648\u2013649}} Over the course of six weeks in the fall of 1972, South Vietnam ended up with the world's fourth largest air force as the Americans provided as war planes as possibly could.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=649}} However, neither Kissinger nor Nixon appreciated that for Thi\u1ec7u any sort of peace deal calling for withdrawal of American forces was unacceptable and he saw the draft peace agreement that Kissinger signed in Paris on 18 October 1972 as a betrayal.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=650}} On 21 October Kissinger together with the American ambassador Ellsworth Bunker arrived at the Gia Long Palace in Saigon to show Thi\u1ec7u the peace agreement.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=650}} The meeting went extremely badly with Thi\u1ec7u engaged that Kissinger did not take the time to translate the draft peace treaty into Vietnamese, bringing with him only an English language copy.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=650}}&nbsp;The meeting went from bad to worse with Thi\u1ec7u having a meltdown as he broke down in tears and hysterically accused Kissinger of plotting with the Soviet Union and China to betray him, saying he could never accept this peace agreement.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=650}} Thi\u1ec7u refused to sign the peace agreement and demanded very extensive amendments that Kissinger reported to Nixon \"verge on insanity\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=650}} Nixon ordered Kissinger to \"push Thi\u1ec7u as far as possible\", but Thi\u1ec7u refused to sign the peace agreement.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=650}} As Kissinger returned to Washington, one of his aides recalled \"In twenty-four hours, the bottom fell out\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}}\n\nThrough Nixon had initially supported Kissinger against Thi\u1ec7u, but two of his most influential advisers, namely his Chief of Staff, [[H.R. Haldeman]] and the Domestic Affairs Adviser [[John Ehrlichman]] urged him to reconsider, arguing that Kissinger had given away too much and Thi\u1ec7u's objections had merit.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} As Thi\u1ec7u sensed Nixon's changing mood, on 24 October 1972 he called a press conference to denounce the draft agreement as a betrayal and stated the Viet Cong \"must be wiped out quickly and mercilessly\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} On October 26, North Vietnam published the draft agreement and accused the United States of tying to \"sabotage\" it by backing Thi\u1ec7u.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} On the same day, Kissinger who until then had never spoken to the media called a press conference at the White House to say: \"We believe peace is at hand. We believe an agreement is within sight\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} Kissinger later admitted that this statement was a major mistake as it inflated hopes for peace while enraging Nixon who saw it as weakness.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} Nixon came very close to disavowed Kissinger as he declared the draft peace agreement had \"differences that must be resolved\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} Taking up Thi\u1ec7u's cause as his own, Nixon wanted 69 amendments to the draft peace agreement included in the final treaty and ordered Kissinger back to Paris to force Tho to accept them.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} Kissinger regarded Nixons' 69 amendments as \"preposterous\" as he knew Tho would never accept them.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} By this point, Kissinger's relations with Nixon were tense while Nixon's \"German shepherds\" Haldeman and Ehrlichman intrigued against him.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}}\n\nAs expected, Tho refused to consider any of the 69 amendments and on 13 December 1972 left Paris for Hanoi after he accused the Americans of negotiating in bad faith.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=652}} Kissinger by this stage was worked up into a state of fury after Tho walked out of the Paris talks and told Nixon: \"They're just a bunch of shits. Tawdry, filthy shits\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=652}} The National Security Adviser now advised Nixon to bomb North Vietnam to make them \"talk seriously\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=652}} On 14 December 1972, Nixon sent an ultimatum demanding that Tho return to Paris to negotiate seriously\" within the 72 hours or else he would bomb North Vietnam without limit.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=652}} Kissinger told the media that the peace agreement was \"99 percent completed\" but \"we will not be blackmailed into an agreement. We will not be stampeded into an agreement and, if I may say so, we will not be charmed into an agreement until its conditions are right\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=652}}  At the same time, Nixon ordered Admiral [[Thomas Hinman Moorer]], the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff: \"I don't want any more of this crap about the fact that we couldn't hit this target or that one. This is your chance to use military power to win this war, and if you don't, I'll hold you responsible\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=652}} Following the rejection of Nixon's ultimatum, on 18 December, [[Operation Linebacker II]] was launched, the so-called Christmas Bombings that lasted until 29 December 1972.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=652\u2013654}} During these 11 days that consisted of the heaviest bombing of the entire war, B-52 bombers flew 3, 000 sorties and dropped 40, 000 tons of bombs on Hanoi and Haiphong.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=652\u2013653}}\n\nOn 26 December, in a press statement Hanoi indicated a willingness to resume the Paris peace talks provided that the bombing stopped.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=652\u2013653}} On 8 January 1973, Kissinger and Tho met again in Paris and the next day reached an agreement, which in main points was essentially the same as the one Nixon had rejected in October with only cosmetic concessions to the Americans.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=652\u2013653}} Thi\u1ec7u once again rejected the peace agreement, only to receive an ultimatum from Nixon: \"You must decide now whether you desire to continue our alliance or whether you want me to seek a settlement with the enemy which serves U.S. interests alone\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=654}} Nixon's threat served its purpose and Thi\u1ec7u reluctantly accepted the peace agreement.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=654}} On 27 January 1973, Kissinger and Tho signed a peace agreement in Paris that called for the complete withdrawal of all U.S forces from Vietnam by March in exchange for North Vietnam freeing all the U.S POWs.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=654}} On 29 March 1973, the withdrawal of the Americans from Vietnam was complete and on 1 April 1973, the last POWs were freed.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=686}} The peace agreement put into effect the \"leopard's spot\" ceasefire with the Viet Cong being allowed to rule whatever parts of South Vietnam they held at the time of the ceasefire and all of the North Vietnamese troops in South Vietnam were allowed to stay, putting the Communists in a strong position to eventually take over South Vietnam.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=654}}\n\nOn 15 March 1973, Nixon had implied during a speech that the United States might go back into Vietnam should the Communists violate the ceasefire, and as a result Congress began debating a bill to limit American funding for military operations in Southeast Asia.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=656}} In April, the CIA estimated the total number of PAVN troops in South Vietnam at 150, 000 (about the same as in 1972) whereas Kissinger accused North Vietnam of moving more troops down the Ho Chi Minh Trail.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=657}} That month, Kissinger met with Tho in Paris to reaffirm their commitment to the Paris peace agreement and to pressure him to stop the Khmer Rouge from overrunning Cambodia.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=657}} Tho told Kissinger that the Khmer Rouge's leader, [[Pol Pot]], was a Vietnamphobe and North Vietnam had very limited influence over him.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=657}}  At the same time, Kissinger reported to Nixon that \"only a miracle\" could save South Vietnam now as Thi\u1ec7u showed no signs of making the necessary reforms to allow the ARVN to fight.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=657}} His assessment of Cambodia was even more bleaker as the Lon Nol regime had lost control of much of the countryside by the spring of 1973 and only American air strikes prevented the Khmer Rouge from taking Phnom Penh.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=657}} On 4 June 1973, the Senate passed a bill that already cleared the House of Representatives to block funding for any American military operations in Indochina and Kissinger spent much of the summer of 1973 lobbying Congress to extent the deadline to 15 August in order to keep bombing Cambodia.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=657}} The Lon Nol regime was saved in 1973 due to heavy American bombing, but the cutoff in funding ended the possibility of an American return to Southeast Asia.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=657}}\n\nThe PAVN had taken heavy losses in the Easter Offensive, but North Vietnamese were rebuilding their strength for a new offensive.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=658}} By the spring of 1973, Nixon was caught up in the Watergate scandal and was losing interest in foreign affairs.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=656}} Thi\u1ec7u's government was still receiving massive amounts of military aid, and his regime controlled 75% of South Vietnam's territory and 85% of the population at the time of the ceasefire.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=657}} But Thi\u1ec7u's unwillingness to crackdown on corruption and end the system under which ARVN officers were promoted for political loyalty instead of military merit were structural weaknesses that spelled long term problems for his regime.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=658}} South Vietnam's economy's had heavily dependent upon the hundreds of millions brought in by spending by the U.S. military and the withdraw of American forces threw the economy into recession. Even more damaging was the Arab oil shock of 1973\u201374 which destabilized South Vietnam's economy and by the summer of 1974 90% of the ARVN's soldiers were not receiving enough pay to support themselves and their families.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=660\u2013661}}\n\nAlong with [[North Vietnamese]] Politburo Member [[Le Duc Tho]], Kissinger was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on December 10, 1973, for their work in negotiating the ceasefires contained in the [[Paris Peace Accords]] on \"Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Vietnam\", signed the previous January.<ref name=\"ceasefire\">{{cite web |title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1973 |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]] |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1973/press.html |accessdate=December 31, 2006}}</ref> According to [[Irwin Abrams]], this prize was the most controversial to date.

Negotiations about strategic disarmament were originally supposed to start under the Johnson Administration but were postponed in protest upon the [[Prague Spring|invasion by Warsaw Pact troops of Czechoslovakia]] in August 1968.\n\nNixon felt his administration had neglected relations with the Western European states in his first term and in September 1972 decided that if he was reelected that 1973 would be the \"Year of Europe\" as the United States would focus on relations with the states of the European Economic Community (EEC) which had emerged as a serious economic rival by 1970.<ref>{{cite book|last=Robb|first=Thomas|title=A strained partnership?: US\u2013UK relations in the era of d\u00e9tente, 1969\u201377|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2013|pp=75\u201376|isbn=978-1-5261-2938-3}}</ref> Applying his favorite \"linkage\" concept, Nixon intended henceforward economic relations with Europe would not be severed from security relations, and if the EEC states wanted changes in American tariff and monetary policies, the price would be defense spending on their part.<ref>{{cite book|last=Robb|first=Thomas|title=A strained partnership?: US\u2013UK relations in the era of d\u00e9tente, 1969\u201377|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2013|pp=75\u201376|isbn=978-1-5261-2938-3}}</ref> Kissinger in particular as part of the \"Year of Europe\" wanted to \"revitalize\" NATO, which he called a \"decaying\" alliance as he believed that there was nothing at present to stop the Red Army from overrunning Western Europe in a conventional forces conflict.<ref>{{cite book|last=Robb|first=Thomas|title=A strained partnership?: US\u2013UK relations in the era of d\u00e9tente, 1969\u201377|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2013|pp=75\u201376|isbn=978-1-5261-2938-3}}</ref> The \"linkage\" concept more applied to the question of security as Kissinger noted that the United States was going to sacrifice NATO for the sake of \"citrus fruits\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Robb|first=Thomas|title=A strained partnership?: US\u2013UK relations in the era of d\u00e9tente, 1969\u201377|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2013|p=78|isbn=978-1-5261-2938-3}}</ref>\n\n===Israeli policy and Soviet Jewry===\n\n[[File:President Nixon, Henry Kissinger and Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir, meeting in the Oval Office 1973.gif|thumb|right|Kissinger sits in the Oval Office with President Nixon and Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir, 1973]]\n\nAccording to notes taken by [[H.R.

In conversation with Nixon shortly after a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] on March 1, 1973, Kissinger stated, \"The emigration of Jews from the Soviet Union is not an objective of American foreign policy, and if they put Jews into gas chambers in the Soviet Union, it is not an American concern. Maybe a humanitarian concern.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Nagourney |first=Adam |title=In Tapes, Nixon Rails About Jews and Blacks |work=The New York Times |date= December 10, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/11/us/politics/11nixon.html }}</ref> Kissinger argued, however:\n\n{{quote|That emigration existed at all was due to the actions of \"realists\" in the White House. Jewish emigration rose from 700 a year in 1969 to near 40,000 in 1972. The total in Nixon's first term was more than 100,000. To maintain this flow by quiet diplomacy, we never used these figures for political purposes.&nbsp;... The issue became public because of the success of our Middle East policy when Egypt evicted Soviet advisers. To restore its relations with Cairo, the Soviet Union put a tax on Jewish emigration. There was no Jackson\u2013Vanik Amendment until there was a successful emigration effort. Sen. Henry Jackson, for whom I had, and continue to have, high regard, sought to remove the tax with his amendment. We thought the continuation of our previous approach of quiet diplomacy was the wiser course.&nbsp;... Events proved our judgment correct. Jewish emigration fell to about a third of its previous high.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kissinger|first=Henry|date=December 26, 2010|url=http://www.henryakissinger.com/articles/wp122610.html|title=Putting The Nixon Tape In Context|work=The Washington Post|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411030809/http://www.henryakissinger.com/articles/wp122610.html|archive-date=April 11, 2012}}</ref>}}\n\n===The Arab-Israeli dispute===\n{{Main|Yom Kippur War}}\nIn 1970, President Nasser of Egypt died and was succeeded by [[Anwar Sadat]], a man whom even more than Kissinger believed in the diplomacy of surprise, in engaging in sudden moves to upset the diplomatic equilibrium. Sadat's liked to say that his favorite game was backgammon, a game where skill and persistence was rewarded, but was best won by sudden gambles, making an analogy between how he played backgammon and conducted his diplomacy.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=393}} Under Nasser, Egypt and Saudi Arabia had engaged what was known as the [[Arab Cold War]], but Sadat got along very well with King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]], forming an alliance between the most populous Arab state and the most wealthiest Arab state. Kissinger later admitted that he was engrossed with the Paris peace talks to end Vietnam war that he and others in Washington missed the significance of the Egyptian-Saudi alliance. At the same that Sadat moved closer to Saudi Arabia, he also wanted a rapprochement with the United States and to move Egypt away from its alliance with the Soviet Union. In July 1972, Sadat expelled all 16, 000 of the Soviet military personnel in Egypt in a signal that he wanted better relations with the United States. Kissinger was taken completely by surprise by Sadat's move, saying: \"Why has he done me this favor? Why didn't he demand all sorts of concessions first?\"{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=393}}\n\nSadat expected as a reward that the United States would respond by pressuring Israel to return the Sinai to Egypt, but after his anti-Soviet move prompted no response from the United States, by November 1972 Sadat moved again closer to the Soviet Union, buying a massive amount of Soviet arms for a war he planned to launch against Israel in 1973. For Sadat, cost was no object as the money to buy Soviet arms came from Saudi Arabia.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=393\u2013394}} At the same time, Faisal promised Sadat that if it should come to war, Saudi Arabia would embargo oil to the West. In April 1973, the Saudi Oil Minister [[Ahmed Zaki Yamani]] visited Washington to meet Kissinger and told him that King Faisal was becoming more and more unhappy with the United States, saying he wanted America to pressure Israel to return all the lands captured in the Six Day War of 1967.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=398\u2013399}} In a later interview, Yamani accused Kissinger of not taking his warning seriously, saying all he did was to ask him not to speak anymore of this threat.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=399}} Angry at Kissinger, Yamani in an interview with the ''Washington Post'' on 19 April 1973 warned that King Faisal was considering an oil embargo.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=399}} At the time, the general feeling in Washington was the Saudis were bluffing and nothing would come of their threat to impose an oil embargo.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=400\u2013401}}&nbsp;The fact that Faisal's ineffectual half brother King Saud had imposed a cripplingly oil embargo on Britain and France during the Suez War of 1956 was not considered an important precedent. The CEOs of four of America's oil companies had after speaking to Faisal arrived in Washington in May 1973 with the warning that Faisal was considerably more tougher, intelligent and ruthless than his half-brother Saud whom he had deposed in 1964, and his threats were serious.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=401\u2013402}} Kissinger declined to meet the four CEOs.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=402}}\n\nIn 1970, American oil production peaked and the United States began to import more and more oil as oil imports rose by 52% between 1969\u20131972.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=415}} Of American oil imports, by 1972 83% were coming from the Middle East.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=415}} Throughout the 1960s, the price for a barrel of oil remained at $1.80, meaning that with the effects of inflation considered the price of oil in real terms got progressively lower and lower throughout the decade with Americans paying less for oil in 1969 than they had in 1959.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=414\u2013415}}Even after a price for a barrel of oil rose to $2.00 in 1971, adjusted for inflation, people in the Western nations were paying less for oil in 1971 than they had in 1958.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=414\u2013415}} The extremely low price of oil served as the basis for the \"long summer\" of prosperity and mass affluence that began in 1945.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=414\u2013415}}\n\nIn an assessment done by Kissinger and his staff about the Middle East in the summer of 1973, the repeated statements by Sadat about waging &nbsp;''jihad'' against Israel were dismissed as empty talk while the warnings from King Faisal were likewise regarded as inconsequential.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=402}}  In September 1973, Nixon fired Rogers as Secretary of State and replaced him with Kissinger. Kissinger was later to state he had not given been enough time to know the Middle East as he settled into the State Department's office at Foggy Bottom as Egypt and Syria attacked Israel on 6 October 1973.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=402}}\n\nDocuments show that Kissinger delayed telling President Richard Nixon about the start of the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973 to keep him from interfering.

The Egyptians broke through the gigantic sand banks of the Bar Lev Line through the simple device of water cannons, and within two hours were Egyptians soldiers were in the Sinai for the first time since 1967.

Kissinger commented: \"Only in the Middle East is it conceivable that a belligerent would ask its adversary's approval for engaging in an act of war against it\".<ref name=Karsh/>\n\nKissinger promised the Israeli Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] the United States would replace its losses in equipment after the war, but sought initially to delay arm shipments to Israel as believed it would improve the odds of making peace along the lines of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242]] calling for a \"land for peace\" deal if an armistice was signed with Egypt and Syria gaining some territory in the Sinai and the Golan Heights respectively.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=408}} The Arab concept of the \"peace of the brave\" (i.e. a victorious leader being magnanimous to his defeated opponents) meant there was a possibility that Sadat at least would make peace with Israel provided that the war ended in such a way that Egypt was not perceived to be defeated. Likewise, Kissinger regarded Meir as being rather arrogant and believed that an armistice that ended the war in a manner that was not an unambiguous Israeli victory would make her more humble.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=408}} As both Syria and Egypt lost much equipment during the fighting, the Soviet Union began to fly new equipment in starting on 12 October, and the Soviet flights to Syria and Egypt were recorded by the British radar stations in Cyprus.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=408}} Through the Soviets were flying in an average of 60 flights per day, exaggerated accounts appeared in Western newspapers speaking of \"one hundred flights per day\".{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=408\u2013409}} At this point, both Nixon and Kissinger began to see the October War more in terms of the Cold War rather than Middle Eastern politics, both seeing the Soviet arms lifts to Egypt and Syria as a Soviet power play that required an American answer.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=408\u2013409}}\n\nIsrael took heavy losses in men and material during the fighting against Egypt and Syria, and on 18 October 1973 Meir requested $850 million worth of American arms and equipment to replace its material losses.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=409\u2013410}} Nixon decided characteristically to act on an epic scale and instead of the $850 million worth of arms requested sent some $2 billion worth of arms to Israel as he boasted that the U.S. Air Force flew more sorties to Israel in October 1973 than it had during the Berlin Airlift of 1948\u201349.<ref>Arnon Gutfeld  and Boaz Vanetik. \"\u2018A Situation That Had to Be Manipulated\u2019: The American Airlift to Israel During the Yom Kippur War.\" ''Middle Eastern Studies'' 52.3 (2016): 419-447.</ref>  In an interview with the British historian [[Robert Lacey]] in 1981, Kissinger later admitted about the arms lift to Israel: \"I made a mistake. In retrospect it was not the best considered decision we made\".{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=411}} The arms lift enraged King Faisal of Saudi Arabia and he retaliated on 20 October 1973 by placing a total embargo on oil shipments to the United States, to be joined by all of the other oil-producing Arab states except Iraq and Libya.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=411\u2013412}} The Arab oil embargo ended the long period of prosperity in the West that had begun in 1945, throwing the world's economy into the steepest economic contraction since the Great Depression.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=414\u2013415}} Lacey wrote about the impact of the Arab oil embargo of 1973\u201374 that for people in the West life suddenly become \"slower, darker and chiller\" as gasoline was rationed, the lights were turned off in Times Square, the \"gas guzzler\" automobiles stopped selling, speed limits became common and restrictions were placed on weekend driving in a bid to conserve fuel.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=415}} As the American automobile industry specialized in producing heavy \"gas guzzler\" vehicles, there was an immediate shift on the part of consumers to the lighter and more fuel efficient vehicles produced by the Japanese and West German automobile industries, sending the American automobile industry into decline. The years from 1945 to 1973 had been a period of unprecedented prosperity in the West, a \"long summer\" that many believed would never end, and its abrupt end in 1973 as the oil embargo which increased the price of oil by 400% within a matter of days threw the world's economy into a sharp recession with unemployment mounting and inflation raging came as a profound shock.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=414\u2013416}} The end of what the French called the ''Trente Glorieuses'' (\"Glorious Thirty\") led to a mood of widespread pessimism in the West with the ''Financial Times'' running a famous headline in late 1973 saying \"The Future will be subject to Delay\".{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=416\u2013417}}\n\nIn the midst of the war, in what journalist Elizabeth Drew called \u201cStrangelove Day,\u201d Kissinger put U.S. military forces on [[DEFCON]] 3 late in the evening of October 24, in what a historian argues is \"best understood as an emotional response to a misunderstanding\" with Soviet ambassador to the United States [[Anatoly Dobrynin]].<ref name=\"Barbara Keys 2011\"/>\n\nIsrael regained the territory it lost in the early fighting and gained new territories from Syria and Egypt, including land in Syria east of the previously captured [[Golan Heights]], and additionally on the western bank of the [[Suez Canal]], although they did lose some territory on the eastern side of the Suez Canal that had been in Israeli hands since the end of the [[Six-Day War]]. During a summit in Cairo on 6 November, Kissinger asked Sadat what Faisal was like and was told: \"Well, Dr. Henry, he will probably go on with you about Communism and the Jews\".{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=417}} King Faisal's two great hatreds were Communism and Zionism as he believed that the Soviet Union and Israel were plotting together against Islam.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=385\u2013386}} When King Faisal was shown a translation into Arabic of ''The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion'', he instantly believed in the authenticity of ''The Protocols'' and therefore talked to anyone who would listen about what he had learned, despite the fact that ''The Protocols'' had been exposed as a forgery in 1921.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=385\u2013386}} On 7 November 1973, Kissinger flew to Riyadh to meet King Faisal and ask him to end the oil embargo in exchange for promising to be \"evenhanded\" with the Arab-Israeli dispute.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=417}} As the plane carrying him prepared to land in Riyadh, Kissinger was clearly nervous at the prospect of negotiating with the stern Wahhabi Faisal who had a marked dislike of Jews.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=417}} Kissinger discovered that King Faisal was a worthy companion to [[L\u00ea \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1ecd]] in terms of stubbornness as the king accused the United States of being biased in favor of Israel, instead engaging in a long rant about the balefulness of \"Jewish Communists\" in Russia and Israel, and despite all of Kissinger's efforts to charm him, refused to end the oil embargo.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=418\u2013419}} In February 1974, King Faisal chaired the second summit of Islamic states (which unlike the first summit Faisal had chaired in 1969 was not boycotted by Iraq and Syria), where he was acclaimed as a conquering hero who humiliated and humbled the West by wrecking its economy, and henceforward Kissinger had to face a bloc of Muslim states who were far more assertive and self-confident than before.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=419\u2013420}}\n\nOnly on 19 March 1974 did the king end the oil embargo after Sadat, whom he trusted, reported to him that the United States was being more \"evenhanded\" and after Kissinger had promised to sell Saudi Arabia weapons that it had previously denied under the grounds that they might be used against Israel.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=420\u2013421}} More importantly, Saudi Arabia had billions of dollars invested in Western banks, and the massive bout of inflation set off by the oil embargo was a threat to this fortune as inflation eroded the value of the money, giving Faisal a vested interest in helping to contain the damage he himself inflicted on the economies of the West.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=421}}\n\nKissinger pressured the Israelis to [[cede]] some of the newly captured land back to its Arab neighbors, contributing to the first phases of Israeli\u2013Egyptian non-aggression. In 1973\u201374, Kissinger engaged in \"shuttle diplomacy\" flying between Tel Avi, Cairo and Damascus in a bid to make the armistice the basis of a preferment peace. Based on his talks with President [[Hafez al Assad]] of Syria, Kissinger concluded the \"Syrians considered Palestine part of a 'greater Syria'\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Pipes|first=Daniel|title=Greater Syria: The History of an Ambition|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1990|p=144|isbn=0195060229}}</ref> Kissinger's first meeting Assad lasted 6 hours and 30 minutes, causing the press to believe for a moment that he had been kidnapped by the Syrians.<ref name=Wright>{{cite news|last=Wright|first=Robin|title=The Assad Family: Nemesis to 9 U.S. Presidents|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=11 April 2017|url= https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-assad-family-nemesis-of-nine-u-s-presidents?verso=true|accessdate=2019-10-30}}</ref> Kissinger called negotiating with Assad \"time-consuming, nerve-racking, and bizarre\".<ref name=Wright/> In his memoirs, Kissinger described during the course of his 28 meetings in Damascus in 1973\u201374 how Assad \"negotiated tenaciously and daringly like a riverboat gambler to make sure he had exacted the last sliver of available concessions\".<ref name=Wright/> Kissinger further described how with Assad: \"His tactic was to open with a statement of the most extreme position to test what the traffic would bear. He might then allow himself to be driven back to the attainable, fighting a dogged rear guard action that made clear that concessions could be exacted only at a heavy price and that discouraged excessive expectations of them. (His negotiating style was in this respect not so different from that of the Israelis, much as both of them would hate the comparison.)\"<ref>{{cite news|last=MacFarquhar|first=Neill|title=Hafez al-Assad, Who Turned Syria Into a Power in the Middle East, Dies at 69|newspaper=The New York Times|date=11 June 2000|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/11/world/hafez-al-assad-who-turned-syria-into-a-power-in-the-middle-east-dies-at-69.html|accessdate=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\nBy contrast, Kissinger's negotiations with Sadat, through not without difficulties, were more fruitful. The move saw a warming in [[Foreign relations of Egypt#United States|U.S.\u2013Egyptian relations]], bitter since the 1950s, as the country moved away from its former independent stance and into a close partnership with the United States. The peace was finalized in 1978 when U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] mediated the [[Camp David Accords (1978)|Camp David Accords]], during which Israel returned the [[Sinai Peninsula]] in exchange for an Egyptian peace agreement that included the recognition of the state of Israel.\n\n===The Persian Gulf===\nA major concern for Kissinger was the possibility of Soviet influence in the oil-rich region of the Persian Gulf. Iraq had been ruled by the Baath Party since 1968, and in April 1969 came into conflict with Iran when Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] renounced the 1937 treaty governing the Shatt-al-Arab river.

In a way, they complemented each other perfectly. Kissinger was the charming and worldly Mr. Outside who provided the grace and intellectual-establishment respectability that Nixon lacked, disdained and aspired to. Kissinger was an international citizen. Nixon very much a classic American. Kissinger had a worldview and a facility for adjusting it to meet the times, Nixon had pragmatism and a strategic vision that provided the foundations for their policies. Kissinger would, of course, say that he was not political like Nixon\u2014but in fact he was just as political as Nixon, just as calculating, just as relentlessly ambitious....these self-made men were driven as much by their need for approval and their neuroses as by their strengths.<ref>David Rothkopf, ''Running the world: the inside story of the National Security Council and the architects of American foreign policy'' (2004), pp. 111\u201312.</ref>\n\nA proponent of ''[[Realpolitik]]'', Kissinger played a dominant role in [[United States foreign policy]] between 1969 and 1977. In that period, he extended the policy of ''[[d\u00e9tente]]''. This policy led to a significant relaxation in US\u2013Soviet tensions and played a crucial role in 1971 talks with Chinese Premier [[Zhou Enlai]]. The talks concluded with a [[rapprochement]] between the United States and the People's Republic of China, and the formation of a new strategic anti-Soviet Sino-American alignment. He was jointly awarded the 1973 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] with [[L\u00ea \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1ecd]] for helping to establish a [[ceasefire]] and U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam.

As National Security Advisor, in 1974 Kissinger directed the much-debated [[National Security Study Memorandum 200]].\n\nKissinger and Nixon shared a penchant for secrecy and conducted numerous \"backchannel\" negotiations that excluded State Department experts. One such years-long backchannel was conducted through the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, [[Anatoly Dobrynin]]. One historian argues that Kissinger formed such a strong \"bond of affection, trust, and mutual interest\" with the ambassador that he came to see U.S.-Soviet relations as holding exaggerated significance. He typically met with or talked to Dobrynin about four times a week, and they had a direct line to each other's offices.<ref name=\"Barbara Keys 2011\">Barbara Keys, \"Henry Kissinger: The Emotional Statesman,\" Diplomatic History 35, no. 4 (September 2011): 587\u2013609.</ref>\n===Arrival in Washington===\nNixon gave Kissinger the freedom to assemble his own team in 1969 in order to \"revitalize\" the National Security Council.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=587}} Kissinger's team consisted of Colonel [[Alexander Haig]], [[Morton Halperin]], and [[Anthony Lake]].{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=587}} Right from the start, Kissinger started to exclude both the Secretary of State [[William P.

By promising to continue the peace talks which Johnson began in May 1968 in Paris Nixon admitted that he had ruled out \"a military victory\" in Vietnam..{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=582}} Nixon wanted a diplomatic settlement similar to the armistice of Panmunjom that ended the Korean War and frequently stated in private he had no intention of being \"the first president of the United States to lose a war\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=582}} To force the North Vietnamese to sign an armistice, Nixon favored a two-pronged approach of the \"madman theory\" of seeking to act rashly to intidimate the North Vietnamese while at the same time trying using the strategy of \"linkage\" to improve relations with the Soviet Union and China in order to persuade both these nations to stop sending arms to North Vietnam..{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=582\u2013583}}  In office, and assisted by Kissinger, Nixon implemented a policy of [[Vietnamization]] that aimed to gradually withdraw U.S. troops while expanding the combat role of the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|South Vietnamese Army]] so that it would be capable of independently defending its government against the [[Viet Cong|National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam]], a Communist guerrilla organization, and the North Vietnamese army ([[Vietnam People's Army]] or PAVN).\n\nIn an article published in ''Foreign Affairs'' in January 1969, Kissinger criticized General William Westmoreland's attrition strategy because the Vietnamese Communists were willing to accept far higher losses on the battlefield than the United States and could therefore \"win\" as long as they did not \"lose\" by merely keeping the war going.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=588}} In the same article, he argued that losses endured by the Vietnamese Communists in the Tet Offensive were meaningless as the Tet Offensive had turned American public opinion against the war, ruling out the possibility of a military solution, and the best that could be done now was to negotiate the most favorable peace settlement at the Paris peace talks.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=587}} Kissinger, when he came into office in 1969 favored a negotiating strategy under which the United States and North Vietnam would sign an armistice and agreed to pull their troops out of South Vietnam while the South Vietnamese government and the Viet Cong were to agree to a coalition government.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=588}} Kissinger had doubts about Nixon's theory of \"linkage\", believing that this would give the Soviet Union leverage over the United States and unlike Nixon was less concerned about the ultimate fate of South Vietnam.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=588\u2013589}} One of Kissinger's first acts as National Security Adviser in early 1969 was to seek opinions of the Vietnam experts within the CIA, the military and the State Department.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=589}} The lengthy volume that emerged contained a diverse collection of opinions with some stating the South Vietnamese were making \"rapid strides\" while others doubted that the government in Saigon would \"ever constitute an effective political or military counter to the Vietcong\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=589}} The \"bulls\" estimated that American troops would need to fight on in Vietnam for 8.3 years before the South Vietnamese would be able to fight on their own while the \"bears\" estimated it take 13.4 years of American troops fighting in Vietnam before the South Vietnamese would be able to fight on their own.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=589}} Kissinger passed the volume on to Nixon with the comment that there was no consensus within the expert community with the implied conclusion that he should be free on his own without consulting the experts.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=589}}\n\nIn early 1969, Kissinger was opposed to the plans for [[Operation Menu]], the bombing of Cambodia, fearing that Nixon was acting rashly with no plans for the diplomatic fall-out, but on 16 March 1969 Nixon at a meeting at the White House attended by Kissinger announced the bombing would start the next day.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=591}} As Congress was unlikely to grant approval to bombing Cambodia, Nixon decided to go ahead without Congressional approval and keep the bombings secret, a decision that several constitutional law experts argued was illegal.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=592}} In May 1969, the bombing was leaked to [[William M. Beecher]] of the ''New York Times'' who published an article about it, which infuriated Kissinger.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=592}} At the time, Kissinger told the FBI director J.E. Hoover \"we will destroy whoever did this\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=592}} As a result, the phones of 13 members of Kissinger's staff were taped by the FBI without a warrant.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=592}} At the time, Kissinger portrayed himself to his friends at Harvard as a moderating force who was working to remove the United States from Vietnam, saying he did not want to end up like his predecessor W.W. Rostow, whose actions as National Security Adviser had caused him to be ostracized by the liberal American intelligentsia.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}}\n\nAs part of the \"linkage\" concept, Kissinger in March 1969 sent [[Cyrus Vance]] to Moscow with the message that if the Soviet Union pressured North Vietnam into a diplomatic settlement favorable to the United States, the reward would be concessions on the talks on limiting the nuclear arms race.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=592\u2013593}} At the same time, Kissinger met with the Soviet ambassador [[Anatoly Dobrynin]] to warn him that Nixon was a dangerous man who wanted to escalate the Vietnam war.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=593}} Nixon and Kissinger played a \"good cop-bad cop\" routine with Dobrynin with Nixon acting the part of the petulant president at the end of his patience with North Vietnam while Kissinger acted as the reasonable diplomat anxious to improve relations with the Soviet Union, saying to Dobrynin in May 1969 that Nixon would \"escalate the war\" if the Soviet Union \"didn't produce a settlement\" in Vietnam.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=595}} At another meeting in 1969, Kissinger warned Dobrynin that \"the train has just left the station and is now headed down the track\", saying the Soviet Union better start pressuring North Vietnam now before Nixon did something truly reckless and dangerous.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=593}} The attempt at \"linkage\" failed as the Soviet Union did not pressure North Vietnam and instead Dobrynin told Kissinger that the Soviets wanted better relations with the United States regardless of the Vietnam war.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=593}} After the failure of the \"linkage\" attempt, Nixon became more open to the alternative strategy suggested by the Defense Secretary [[Melvin Laird]] who argued that the burden of the war should be shifted to the South Vietnamese, which was initially called \"de-Americanization\" and which Laird renamed Vietnamization because it sounded better.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=594}}\n\nOn 4 August 1969, Kissinger met secretly with [[Xu\u00e2n Th\u1ee7y]] at the Paris apartment of [[Jean Sainteny]] to discuss peace.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=597}} Kissinger repeated the American offer of \"mutual withdrawal\" of U.S and North Vietnamese forces from South Vietnam which Th\u1ee7y rejected while Th\u1ee7y demanded a new government in Saigon which Kissinger rejected.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=597}} &nbsp;Kissinger had a low opinion of North Vietnam, saying \"I can't believe that a fourth-rate power like North Vietnam doesn't have a breaking point\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}} Kissinger was opposed to the strategy of Vietnamization, expressing some doubt about the ability of the ARVN (Army of the Republic of Vietnam-i.e. the South Vietnamese Army) to hold the field, causing much tension with Defense Secretary Laird who was deeply committed to Vietnamization.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}}  In September 1969, Kissinger in a memo advised Nixon against \"de-escalation\", saying that keeping U.S troops fighting in Vietnam \"remains one of our few bargaining weapons\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}} In the same memo, Kissinger stated he was \"deeply disturbed\" that Nixon had started pulling out U.S. troops, saying that withdrawing the troops was like \"salted peanuts\" to the American people, \"the more U.S troops come home, the more will be demanded\", giving the advantage to the enemy who merely had to \"wait us out\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}} Instead, he recommenced that the United States resume bombing North Vietnam and mine the coast.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}} Later in September 1969, Kissinger proposed a plan for what he called a \"savage, punishing\" blow against North Vietnam code-named [[Duck Hook]] to Nixon, arguing that this was the best way to force North Vietnam to agree to peace on American terms.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}} Laird was strongly opposed to Duck Hook, warning Nixon that the use of nuclear weapons to kill a massive number of North Vietnamese civilians would alienate American public opinion from the administration and persuaded Nixon to reject it.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}} Reflecting his background as a Harvard professor of political science who belonged to the ''Primat der Aussenpolitik'' school which saw foreign policy as belonging only to a small elite, Kissinger was less sensitive to public opinion than Laird, a former Republican congressman who constantly advised Nixon to keep American public opinion in mind.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=596}}\n\nKissinger played a key role in [[Operation Menu|bombing Cambodia]] to disrupt PAVN and Viet Cong units launching raids into South Vietnam from within Cambodia's borders and resupplying their forces by using the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]] and other routes, as well as the 1970 [[Cambodian Incursion]] and subsequent widespread bombing of [[Khmer Rouge]] targets in Cambodia. The Paris peace talks had become stalemated by late 1969 owing to the obstructionism of the South Vietnamese delegation who wanted the talks to fail.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=624}} The South Vietnamese President [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u]] did not want the United States to withdraw from Vietnam, and out of frustration with him, Kissinger decided to begin secret peace talks in Paris parallel to the official talks that the South Vietnamese were unaware of.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=623}} On 21 February 1970, Kissinger secretly met in a modest house in a Paris suburb [[L\u00ea \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1ecd]], the North Vietnamese diplomat who was to become his most tenacious adversary.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=623}} In 1981, Kissinger told the journalist [[Stanley Karnow]]: \"I don't look back on our meetings with any great joy, yet he was a person of substance and discipline who defended the position he represented with dedication\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=623}} Not until February 1971 were Rogers and Laird first informed of the parallel peace talks in Paris.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=623}} Kissinger was to meet Tho three times between February-April 1970, and the North Vietnamese first sensed a softening of the American position during these talks as Kissinger slightly altered the \"mutual withdrawal formula\" that the Americans had previously held to.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=625}}&nbsp;Nixon was gravely disappointed that the secret talks in Paris did not have the prompt results he wanted.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=607}} Kissinger wrote in his memoirs that \"historians rarely do justice to the psychological stress on a policy-maker\", noting that by early 1970 Nixon was feeling very much besieged and inclined to lash out against a world he was believed was plotting his downfall.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=606}} Nixon had become obsessed with the film ''Patton'', seeing how the film presented Patton as a solitary and misunderstood genius whom the world did not appreciate a parallel to himself and kept watching the film over and over again.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=607}}\n\nOn 18 March 1970, the Prime Minister of Cambodia, [[Lon Nol]] carried out a coup against King Sihanouk and ultimately declared Cambodia a republic.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=604\u2013605}} Out of fury with Lon Nol, the king went to Beijing where he allied himself to his former enemies, the Khmer Rouge, calling upon the Khmer people to \"liberate our motherland\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=606}} As the most of the Khmer peasantry regarded the king as a god-like figure, the royal endorsement of the Khmer Rouge had immediate results. Cambodia had descended into chaos by late March 1970 as Lon Nol regime to prove its nationalist credibility organized pogroms against the Vietnamese minority, leading the North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong to attack and defeat Cambodia's weak army.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=606}} Nixon believed in the situation in Cambodia offered the chance for him to be like Patton by doing something bold and risky.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=606\u2013607}} Kissinger was initially ambivalent about Nixon's plans to invade Cambodia, but as he saw the president was committed, he became more and more supportive.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=608}} On 23 April 1970, Nixon in a memo to Kissinger declared \"we need a bold move in Cambodia to show that we stand with Lon Nol\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=608}}\n\nOn 26 April 1970, Nixon decided to \"go for broke\" by invading Cambodia with U.S troops.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=608}} When Nixon's speech-writer [[William Safire]] pointed out that the use of U.S. troops violated the Nixon Doctrine that America's Asian allies should do the fighting, Kissinger snapped at him: \"We wrote the goddamn doctrine, we can change it!\"{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=609}} Kissinger was under immense strain as several of his aides were planning to resign to protest the invasion of Cambodia, his liberal friends from Harvard were pressuring him to resign as well while Nixon was all for more belligerence.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=609}} Kissinger received a phone call from Nixon and his best friend, [[Bebe Rebozo|Charles \"Bebe\" Rebozo]], who both sounded very drunk; Nixon began the call and then handed the phone to Rebozo who said: \"The President wants you to know if this doesn't work, Henry, it's your ass\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=609}} On 30 April 1970, the United States invaded Cambodia which Nixon announced in a television address that Kissinger contemptuously called \"vintage Nixon\" because of his overblown rhetoric.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=609}} At the time, Nixon was seen as recklessly escalating the war and in early May 1970 the largest protests ever against the Vietnam war took place.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=611}} Four of Kissinger's aides resigned in protest while the Cambodian \"incursion\" ended several of Kissinger's friendships with colleagues from Harvard when he chose not to resign.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=611}} Nixon in his memoirs claimed that Kissinger \"took a particularly hard line\" with regards to the \"Cambodian incursion\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=611}} Roger Morris, one of Kissinger's aides later recalled that he was frightened by the huge anti-war demonstrations, comparing the antiwar movement to Nazis.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=611}} Kissinger was haunted by memories of his youth in Germany, and had a deep distrust of mass movements of either the left or the right, favoring the Primat der Aussenpolitik school of foreign-policy making by an elite with the masses excluded. In his interview with Karnow, Kissinger maintained he felt torn about where he stood and blamed Nixon for his failure to find \"the language of respect and compassion that might have created a bridge at least to the more reasonable elements of the antiwar movement\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=611}}\n\nThe Cambodian \"incursion\" saw American and South Vietnamese take the areas of eastern Cambodia that American commanders called the Fish Hook and Parrot's Beak and captured an impressive haul of arms originating from China and the Soviet Union.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=609\u2013610}} But the majority of Vietnamese Communist forces had withdrawn deeper into Cambodia before the invasion with only a small number left behind to wage a fighting retreat to avoid charges of cowardice.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=609\u2013610}} In June 1970, the Americans pulled out of Cambodia and the Vietnamese Communists returned, through the loss of weapons greatly hindered their operations in the Saigon area for the rest of 1970.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=610 & 625}} Having committed itself to supporting Lon Nol, the United States now had two allies instead of one to support in Southeast Asia.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=612}}\n\nThe bombing campaign in Cambodia contributed to the chaos of the [[Cambodian Civil War]], which saw the forces of leader [[Lon Nol]] unable to retain foreign support to combat the growing Khmer Rouge insurgency that would overthrow him in 1975.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Totten |first1=Samuel |last2=Parsons |first2=William S. |last3=Charny |first3=Israel W. |title=Century of Genocide: Critical Essays and Eyewitness Accounts |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2004 |page=349 |isbn=978-0-415-94430-4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5Ef8Hrx8Cd0C&pg=PA349 |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Smyth |first1=Marie |last2=Robinson |first2=Gillian |title=Researching Violently Divided Societies: Ethical and Methodological Issues |publisher=[[United Nations University Press]] |year=2001 |page=93 |isbn=978-92-808-1065-3 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZWqNwsv6AIQC&pg=PA93 |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}</ref> Documents uncovered from the Soviet archives after 1991 reveal that the North Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1970 was launched at the explicit request of the Khmer Rouge and negotiated by [[Pol Pot]]'s then second in command, [[Nuon Chea]].<ref>Dmitry Mosyakov, \"The Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese Communists: A History of Their Relations as Told in the Soviet Archives\", in Susan E.

The ARVN invaded Laos on 8 February 1971 and were stopped decisively by the North Vietnamese.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=629\u2013630}} In March, Kissinger sent his deputy Haig to inspect the situation personally, leading him to report that the ARVN officers lacked courage and did not want to fight, making retreat the only option.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=630}}&nbsp;The retreat when it began turned into a rout.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=630}} Kissinger wrote Lam Son had fallen \"far short of our expectations\", which he blamed on bad American planning, poor South Vietnamese tactics and Nixon's leadership style, leading Karnow to write he blamed \"everyone, characteristically, except himself\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=631}}\n\nIn late May 1971, Kissinger returned to Paris to fruitlessly meet again with Tho.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} The North Vietnamese demand that Thi\u1ec7u step down proved to the main obstacle.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} Kissinger did not want a repeat of the prolonged bout of political instability that characterized South Vietnam from 1963 to 1967 and believed Thi\u1ec7u was a force for order.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} Tho suggested to Kissinger that Americans \"stop supporting\"  Thi\u1ec7u who was running for the reelection in a ballot scheduled for 3 October 1971.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} Tho claimed that Thi\u1ec7u's opponents, Air Marshal [[Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3]] and General [[D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u0103n Minh]] aka \"Big Minh\", were both open to a coalition government with the Viet Cong and had if either men were elected president, the war would be over by late 1971.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} Thi\u1ec7u used a legal technicality to disqualify K\u1ef3 while Minh dropped out when it was clear the election was rigged.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} In the 1971 election, the CIA donated money for Thi\u1ec7u's reelection campaign while the Americans did not pressure Thi\u1ec7u to stop rigging the election.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}} Through Kissinger did not regard South Vietnam as important in its own right, he believed it was necessary to support South Vietnam to maintain the United States as a global power, believing that none of America's allies would trust the United States if South Vietnam were abandoned too quickly.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} Kissinger also believed that if South Vietnam were to collapse, it \"leave deep scars on our society, feeling impulses for recrimination\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}} As a Jew who had grown up in Nazi Germany, Kissinger was haunted by how the ''Dolchsto\u00dflegende'' had used by the German right to delegitimatize the Weimar Republic, and believed that something similar would happen in the United States should it lose the Vietnam War, fueling the rise of right-wing extremism.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}}\n\nIn June 1971, Kissinger supported Nixon's effort to ban the [[Pentagon Papers]] saying the \"hemorrhage of state secrets\" to the media was making diplomacy impossible.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=633}} [[Daniel Ellsberg]], the man who leaked the Pentagon Papers to the ''New York Times'' had been consulted by Kissinger for ideas about Vietnam in late 1968-early 1969, but when he leaked the papers, Kissinger told Nixon that he was a left-wing \"fanatic\" and a \"drug abuser\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=633}} Kissinger depicted Ellsberg to Nixon as a drug-crazed degenerate of questionable mental stability out to ruin his administration. Reflecting his increasingly frustration with the war, Nixon often talked to Kissinger in a bloodthirsty manner about a \"fantasy holocaust\" in which he would have U.S. forces kill every living thing in North Vietnam and then pull out, leading the latter appalled by his own account.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=635}}\n\nBy early 1972, Nixon boosted that he had pulled out 400, 000 U.S soldiers from Vietnam since July 1969, and battle deaths had fallen from an average of 200 per week in 1969 down to an average of 10 per week in 1972.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}} The policy of Vietnamization had, as Laird predicted it would, tamed the antiwar movement as most Americans objected not to war in Vietnam per se, only to Americans dying in it.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}} With the antiwar movement in decline by 1972, Nixon believed his chances of reelection were good, but Kissinger kept complaining that he was losing \"negotiating assets\" in his talks with Tho every time a withdrawal of American forces was announced.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}}  Likewise, Kissinger noted that the major reason why Congress despite the antiwar feelings of many of its members kept voting to fund the war was because the argument it was patriotic to support \"our boys in the field\"; as more Americans were pulled out, Congress was less inclined to vote to fund keeping South Vietnamese \"boys in the field\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}} However, the imperatives of being re-elected was far more important to Nixon than with giving Kissinger \"negotiating assets\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}} In early 1972, Nixon publicly revealed that Kissinger had secretly negotiating with Tho since 1970 to prove that he was really was committed to peace in Vietnam despite what the antiwar movement had been saying about him for the last three years.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}} Reflecting Kissinger's weakening hand in his talks with Tho, Nixon had increasingly come by 1971\u201372 to believe that \"linkage\" concept of improving relations with the Soviet Union and China in exchange for those nations cutting off the supply of weapons to North Vietnam offered his best chance of a favorable peace deal.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=636}}\n\nOn 21 February 1972 was in Nixon's words \"the week that changed the world\" as he landed in Beijing to meet [[Mao Zedong]].{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=638}} Kissinger who accompanied Nixon to China spent much time talking to the suave Chinese Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] about Vietnam, pressing him to end the supply of arms to North Vietnam.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=638}} The talks went nowhere as Zhou told Kissinger that the North Vietnamese played off China against the Soviet Union, and to cut off North Vietnam would allow it to fall into the Soviet sphere of influence.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=638}} As the Chinese People's Liberation Army had badly bloodied by the Red Army in a border war in 1969, Zhou stated that to face a two-front war with Chinese forces facing North Vietnam in the south and the Soviet Union in the north was not acceptable to his government.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=638}} Zhou offered Kissinger only the vague message that China supported efforts to find peace in Vietnam while refusing to make any promises, though Kissinger also noted that Zhou declined to endorse North Vietnam's demands.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=638}} Despite Nixon's coming visit, in late 1971 the Chinese drastically increased their military aid to North Vietnam and continued to send a massive amount of weapons south even as Nixon and Kissinger exchanged pleasantries with Mao and Zhou in Beijing.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=639}}&nbsp;As usual, when the Chinese increased their supply of arms to North Vietnam, the Soviet Union did likewise as both Communist states competed with one another for influence in Hanoi by tying to be the biggest supplier of weapons.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=639}} On 30 March 1972, the PAVN launched the [[Easter Offensive]] that overran several provinces in South Vietnam while pushing the ARVN to the brink of collapse.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=640\u2013642}}\n\nAt the time of the Easter Offensive, Kissinger was deeply involved in planning for Nixon's visit to Moscow in May 1972. The offensive brought to the fore the differences between Nixon and Kissinger. Nixon threatened to cancel his summit with [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in Moscow if the Soviet Union did not force North Vietnam to end the Easter Offensive at once, saying: \"Whatever else happens, we cannot lose this war. The summit isn't worth a damn if the price for it is losing in Vietnam\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=644}} Nixon in his instructions to Kissinger stated that he viewed the relations with the Soviet Union through the prism of the Vietnam war and if the Soviets were not prepared to help, Kissinger \"should just pack up and come home\"..{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=644}} Kissinger for his part believed that Nixon was massively exaggerating Soviet influence in North Vietnam and not longer believed if he ever did in Nixon's \"linkage\" concept.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=644}} Kissinger feared that Nixon was obsessed with Vietnam and damaging relations with the Soviet Union over Vietnam would destabilize the international power balance by increasing American-Soviet tensions.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=644}} On 20 April 1972, Kissinger arrived in Moscow without informing the U.S. ambassador [[Jacob D. Beam]], and then went to have tea with Brezhnev in the Kremlin.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=644}} Nixon as usual when under stress departed for a marathon drinking session with Rebozo at Camp David, and via Haig kept sending messages to Kissinger to be tough with Brezhnev.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=644}} As no American president had ever visited Moscow before, Kissinger got the impression that Brezhnev wanted the planned summit to happen \"at almost any cost\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=644}} Kissinger's implemented Nixon's emphasis on building an amicable personal relationship with Brezhnev.<ref>Barbara Keys,  \"Nixon/Kissinger and Brezhnev.\" ''Diplomatic History'' 42.4 (2018): 548-551.</ref>  Upon his return to Washington, Kissinger reported that Brezhnev would not cancel the summit and was keen to sign the SALT I Treaty.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} Kissinger went to Paris on 3 May to meet Tho with orders from Nixon that North Vietnam must \"Settle or else!\"{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} Nixon complained that Kissinger was \"obsessed\" with the need for a peace treaty while he charged that he now wished he followed his instincts to bomb North Vietnam in 1970, saying if he had done so, the war would have been over by now.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} On 2 May 1972, the PAVN had captured Quangtri, an important provincial city in South Vietnam, and as a result of this victory, Tho was in no mood for a compromise.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} Through Kissinger in general shared Nixon's determination to be tough, he was afraid that the president would overreact and destroy the budding d\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union and China by striking too hard at North Vietnam.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} Moreover, after the rupture caused by the Cambodian incursion, Kissigner was trying hard to rebuilt his relations with the liberal American intelligentsia, saying he did want to become \"this administration's Walt Rostow\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} Kissinger's predecessor, Rostow had once being a professor at Harvard, Oxford the MIT, and Cambridge, but serving as the National Security Adviser had shunned by the Ivy League universities and ended up at the lowly University of Texas, a fate that Kissinger was determined to avoid.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} On 5 May 1972, Nixon ordered the U.S. Air Force to start bombing Hanoi and Haiphong and on 8 May ordered the U.S Navy to mine the coast of North Vietnam.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=645}} As the bombings and mining of North Vietnam, Nixon and even more so Kissinger waited anxiously for the Soviet reaction, and much to their relief received only the standard statement decrying the American action and a diplomatic note complaining that American aircraft had bombed a Soviet freighter in Haiphong harbor.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=646}} The Moscow summit was not canceled.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=646}}\n\nOn 24 July 1972, Congress passed an act calling for the total withdraw of all American forces from Vietnam once all of the American POWs in North Vietnam were released, causing Kissinger to say the North Vietnamese only had to wait until \"Congress voted us of the war\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=646}} However, the sight of Nixon and Kissinger posing for photographs with Brezhnev and Mao deeply worried the North Vietnamese who were afraid of being \"sold out\" by either China and/or the Soviet Union, causing some flexibility in their negotiating tactics.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=646}} The Eastern Offensive had not caused the collapse of the South Vietnamese government, but it increased the amount of territory under Communist control.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=647}} The North Vietnamese were moving towards taking up the \"standstill ceasefire\" offer and ordered the Viet Cong to seize as much territory as possible in preparation for a \"leopard's spot\" ceasefire (so called because the patchwork of territories controlled by the Viet Cong and the Saigon government resembled the spots on a leopard's fur).{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=647}} On 1 August 1972, Kissinger met Tho again in Paris, and for first time, he seemed willing to compromise, saying that political and military terms of an armistice could be treated separately and hinted that his government was no longer willing to make the overthrow of Thi\u1ec7u a precondition.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=647}}\n\nOn the evening of 8 October 1972 at a secret meeting of Kissinger and Tho in a house in the Paris suburb of Gif-sur-Yvette once owned by the painter Fernard L\u00e9ger&nbsp;came the decisive breakthrough in the talks.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=647\u2013648}} Tho believed that Kissinger was as he later it put \"in a rush\"&nbsp;for a peace deal before the presidential election, and began with he called \"a very realistic and very simple proposal\" for a ceasefire that would see the Americans pull all their forces out of Vietnam in exchange for the release of all the POWs in North Vietnam.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}} As for the ultimate fate of South Vietnam, Tho proposed the creation of a \"council of national reconciliation\" that would govern the nation, but in the meantime Thi\u1ec7u could stay in power until the council was formed while a \"leopard's spot\" ceasefire would come into effect with the Viet Cong and the Saigon government controlling whatever territories they were had at the time of the ceasefire.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}} The \"mutual withdrawal formula\" was to be disregarded with PAVN forces to stay in South Vietnam with Tho giving Kissinger a vague promise that no more supplies would be sent down the Ho Chi Minh Trail.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}} Kissinger accepted Tho's offer as the most best deal possible, saying that the \"mutual withdrawal formula\" had to be abandoned as it been \"unobtainable through ten years of war...We could not make it a condition for a final settlement. We had long passed that threshold\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}} Several of Kissinger's own staff, most notably [[John Negroponte]], were strongly opposed to him accepting this offer, saying Kissinger had given away more than he had obtained.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}} In response to Negronponte's objections, Kissinger exploded in rage, accusing him of \"nit-picking\" and screamed at the top of his voice: \"You don't understand. I want to meet their terms. I want to reach an agreement. I want to end this war before the election. It can be done and it will be done...What do you want us to do? Stay there forever?\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}}\n\nReflecting the \"leopard's spot\" ceasefire, Kissinger sent Thi\u1ec7u a message saying he should \"seize as much territory as possible\" before the ceasefire came into effect while the United States launched Operation Enhance Plus to give South Vietnam as many weapons as possible.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=648\u2013649}} Over the course of six weeks in the fall of 1972, South Vietnam ended up with the world's fourth largest air force as the Americans provided as war planes as possibly could.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=649}} However, neither Kissinger nor Nixon appreciated that for Thi\u1ec7u any sort of peace deal calling for withdrawal of American forces was unacceptable and he saw the draft peace agreement that Kissinger signed in Paris on 18 October 1972 as a betrayal.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=650}} On 21 October Kissinger together with the American ambassador Ellsworth Bunker arrived at the Gia Long Palace in Saigon to show Thi\u1ec7u the peace agreement.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=650}} The meeting went extremely badly with Thi\u1ec7u engaged that Kissinger did not take the time to translate the draft peace treaty into Vietnamese, bringing with him only an English language copy.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=650}}&nbsp;The meeting went from bad to worse with Thi\u1ec7u having a meltdown as he broke down in tears and hysterically accused Kissinger of plotting with the Soviet Union and China to betray him, saying he could never accept this peace agreement.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=650}} Thi\u1ec7u refused to sign the peace agreement and demanded very extensive amendments that Kissinger reported to Nixon \"verge on insanity\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=650}} Nixon ordered Kissinger to \"push Thi\u1ec7u as far as possible\", but Thi\u1ec7u refused to sign the peace agreement.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=650}} As Kissinger returned to Washington, one of his aides recalled \"In twenty-four hours, the bottom fell out\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=648}}\n\nThrough Nixon had initially supported Kissinger against Thi\u1ec7u, but two of his most influential advisers, namely his Chief of Staff, [[H.R. Haldeman]] and the Domestic Affairs Adviser [[John Ehrlichman]] urged him to reconsider, arguing that Kissinger had given away too much and Thi\u1ec7u's objections had merit.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} As Thi\u1ec7u sensed Nixon's changing mood, on 24 October 1972 he called a press conference to denounce the draft agreement as a betrayal and stated the Viet Cong \"must be wiped out quickly and mercilessly\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} On October 26, North Vietnam published the draft agreement and accused the United States of tying to \"sabotage\" it by backing Thi\u1ec7u.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} On the same day, Kissinger who until then had never spoken to the media called a press conference at the White House to say: \"We believe peace is at hand. We believe an agreement is within sight\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} Kissinger later admitted that this statement was a major mistake as it inflated hopes for peace while enraging Nixon who saw it as weakness.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} Nixon came very close to disavowed Kissinger as he declared the draft peace agreement had \"differences that must be resolved\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} Taking up Thi\u1ec7u's cause as his own, Nixon wanted 69 amendments to the draft peace agreement included in the final treaty and ordered Kissinger back to Paris to force Tho to accept them.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} Kissinger regarded Nixons' 69 amendments as \"preposterous\" as he knew Tho would never accept them.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}} By this point, Kissinger's relations with Nixon were tense while Nixon's \"German shepherds\" Haldeman and Ehrlichman intrigued against him.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=651}}\n\nAs expected, Tho refused to consider any of the 69 amendments and on 13 December 1972 left Paris for Hanoi after he accused the Americans of negotiating in bad faith.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=652}} Kissinger by this stage was worked up into a state of fury after Tho walked out of the Paris talks and told Nixon: \"They're just a bunch of shits. Tawdry, filthy shits\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=652}} The National Security Adviser now advised Nixon to bomb North Vietnam to make them \"talk seriously\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=652}} On 14 December 1972, Nixon sent an ultimatum demanding that Tho return to Paris to negotiate seriously\" within the 72 hours or else he would bomb North Vietnam without limit.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=652}} Kissinger told the media that the peace agreement was \"99 percent completed\" but \"we will not be blackmailed into an agreement. We will not be stampeded into an agreement and, if I may say so, we will not be charmed into an agreement until its conditions are right\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=652}}  At the same time, Nixon ordered Admiral [[Thomas Hinman Moorer]], the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff: \"I don't want any more of this crap about the fact that we couldn't hit this target or that one. This is your chance to use military power to win this war, and if you don't, I'll hold you responsible\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=652}} Following the rejection of Nixon's ultimatum, on 18 December, [[Operation Linebacker II]] was launched, the so-called Christmas Bombings that lasted until 29 December 1972.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=652\u2013654}} During these 11 days that consisted of the heaviest bombing of the entire war, B-52 bombers flew 3, 000 sorties and dropped 40, 000 tons of bombs on Hanoi and Haiphong.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=652\u2013653}}\n\nOn 26 December, in a press statement Hanoi indicated a willingness to resume the Paris peace talks provided that the bombing stopped.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=652\u2013653}} On 8 January 1973, Kissinger and Tho met again in Paris and the next day reached an agreement, which in main points was essentially the same as the one Nixon had rejected in October with only cosmetic concessions to the Americans.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=652\u2013653}} Thi\u1ec7u once again rejected the peace agreement, only to receive an ultimatum from Nixon: \"You must decide now whether you desire to continue our alliance or whether you want me to seek a settlement with the enemy which serves U.S. interests alone\".{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=654}} Nixon's threat served its purpose and Thi\u1ec7u reluctantly accepted the peace agreement.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=654}} On 27 January 1973, Kissinger and Tho signed a peace agreement in Paris that called for the complete withdrawal of all U.S forces from Vietnam by March in exchange for North Vietnam freeing all the U.S POWs.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=654}} On 29 March 1973, the withdrawal of the Americans from Vietnam was complete and on 1 April 1973, the last POWs were freed.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=686}} The peace agreement put into effect the \"leopard's spot\" ceasefire with the Viet Cong being allowed to rule whatever parts of South Vietnam they held at the time of the ceasefire and all of the North Vietnamese troops in South Vietnam were allowed to stay, putting the Communists in a strong position to eventually take over South Vietnam.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=654}}\n\nOn 15 March 1973, Nixon had implied during a speech that the United States might go back into Vietnam should the Communists violate the ceasefire, and as a result Congress began debating a bill to limit American funding for military operations in Southeast Asia.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=656}} In April, the CIA estimated the total number of PAVN troops in South Vietnam at 150, 000 (about the same as in 1972) whereas Kissinger accused North Vietnam of moving more troops down the Ho Chi Minh Trail.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=657}} That month, Kissinger met with Tho in Paris to reaffirm their commitment to the Paris peace agreement and to pressure him to stop the Khmer Rouge from overrunning Cambodia.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=657}} Tho told Kissinger that the Khmer Rouge's leader, [[Pol Pot]], was a Vietnamphobe and North Vietnam had very limited influence over him.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=657}}  At the same time, Kissinger reported to Nixon that \"only a miracle\" could save South Vietnam now as Thi\u1ec7u showed no signs of making the necessary reforms to allow the ARVN to fight.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=657}} His assessment of Cambodia was even more bleaker as the Lon Nol regime had lost control of much of the countryside by the spring of 1973 and only American air strikes prevented the Khmer Rouge from taking Phnom Penh.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=657}} On 4 June 1973, the Senate passed a bill that already cleared the House of Representatives to block funding for any American military operations in Indochina and Kissinger spent much of the summer of 1973 lobbying Congress to extent the deadline to 15 August in order to keep bombing Cambodia.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=657}} The Lon Nol regime was saved in 1973 due to heavy American bombing, but the cutoff in funding ended the possibility of an American return to Southeast Asia.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=657}}\n\nThe PAVN had taken heavy losses in the Easter Offensive, but North Vietnamese were rebuilding their strength for a new offensive.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=658}} By the spring of 1973, Nixon was caught up in the Watergate scandal and was losing interest in foreign affairs.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=656}} Thi\u1ec7u's government was still receiving massive amounts of military aid, and his regime controlled 75% of South Vietnam's territory and 85% of the population at the time of the ceasefire.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=657}} But Thi\u1ec7u's unwillingness to crackdown on corruption and end the system under which ARVN officers were promoted for political loyalty instead of military merit were structural weaknesses that spelled long term problems for his regime.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|p=658}} South Vietnam's economy's had heavily dependent upon the hundreds of millions brought in by spending by the U.S. military and the withdraw of American forces threw the economy into recession. Even more damaging was the Arab oil shock of 1973\u201374 which destabilized South Vietnam's economy and by the summer of 1974 90% of the ARVN's soldiers were not receiving enough pay to support themselves and their families.{{sfnp|Karnow|1983|pp=660\u2013661}}\n\nAlong with [[North Vietnamese]] Politburo Member [[Le Duc Tho]], Kissinger was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on December 10, 1973, for their work in negotiating the ceasefires contained in the [[Paris Peace Accords]] on \"Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Vietnam\", signed the previous January.<ref name=\"ceasefire\">{{cite web |title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1973 |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]] |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1973/press.html |accessdate=December 31, 2006}}</ref> According to [[Irwin Abrams]], this prize was the most controversial to date.

Negotiations about strategic disarmament were originally supposed to start under the Johnson Administration but were postponed in protest upon the [[Prague Spring|invasion by Warsaw Pact troops of Czechoslovakia]] in August 1968.\n\nNixon felt his administration had neglected relations with the Western European states in his first term and in September 1972 decided that if he was reelected that 1973 would be the \"Year of Europe\" as the United States would focus on relations with the states of the European Economic Community (EEC) which had emerged as a serious economic rival by 1970.<ref>{{cite book|last=Robb|first=Thomas|title=A strained partnership?: US\u2013UK relations in the era of d\u00e9tente, 1969\u201377|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2013|pp=75\u201376|isbn=978-1-5261-2938-3}}</ref> Applying his favorite \"linkage\" concept, Nixon intended henceforward economic relations with Europe would not be severed from security relations, and if the EEC states wanted changes in American tariff and monetary policies, the price would be defense spending on their part.<ref>{{cite book|last=Robb|first=Thomas|title=A strained partnership?: US\u2013UK relations in the era of d\u00e9tente, 1969\u201377|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2013|pp=75\u201376|isbn=978-1-5261-2938-3}}</ref> Kissinger in particular as part of the \"Year of Europe\" wanted to \"revitalize\" NATO, which he called a \"decaying\" alliance as he believed that there was nothing at present to stop the Red Army from overrunning Western Europe in a conventional forces conflict.<ref>{{cite book|last=Robb|first=Thomas|title=A strained partnership?: US\u2013UK relations in the era of d\u00e9tente, 1969\u201377|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2013|pp=75\u201376|isbn=978-1-5261-2938-3}}</ref> The \"linkage\" concept more applied to the question of security as Kissinger noted that the United States was going to sacrifice NATO for the sake of \"citrus fruits\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Robb|first=Thomas|title=A strained partnership?: US\u2013UK relations in the era of d\u00e9tente, 1969\u201377|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2013|p=78|isbn=978-1-5261-2938-3}}</ref>\n\n===Israeli policy and Soviet Jewry===\n\n[[File:President Nixon, Henry Kissinger and Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir, meeting in the Oval Office 1973.gif|thumb|right|Kissinger sits in the Oval Office with President Nixon and Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir, 1973]]\n\nAccording to notes taken by [[H.R.

In conversation with Nixon shortly after a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] on March 1, 1973, Kissinger stated, \"The emigration of Jews from the Soviet Union is not an objective of American foreign policy, and if they put Jews into gas chambers in the Soviet Union, it is not an American concern. Maybe a humanitarian concern.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Nagourney |first=Adam |title=In Tapes, Nixon Rails About Jews and Blacks |work=The New York Times |date= December 10, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/11/us/politics/11nixon.html }}</ref> Kissinger argued, however:\n\n{{quote|That emigration existed at all was due to the actions of \"realists\" in the White House. Jewish emigration rose from 700 a year in 1969 to near 40,000 in 1972. The total in Nixon's first term was more than 100,000. To maintain this flow by quiet diplomacy, we never used these figures for political purposes.&nbsp;... The issue became public because of the success of our Middle East policy when Egypt evicted Soviet advisers. To restore its relations with Cairo, the Soviet Union put a tax on Jewish emigration. There was no Jackson\u2013Vanik Amendment until there was a successful emigration effort. Sen. Henry Jackson, for whom I had, and continue to have, high regard, sought to remove the tax with his amendment. We thought the continuation of our previous approach of quiet diplomacy was the wiser course.&nbsp;... Events proved our judgment correct. Jewish emigration fell to about a third of its previous high.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kissinger|first=Henry|date=December 26, 2010|url=http://www.henryakissinger.com/articles/wp122610.html|title=Putting The Nixon Tape In Context|work=The Washington Post|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411030809/http://www.henryakissinger.com/articles/wp122610.html|archive-date=April 11, 2012}}</ref>}}\n\n===The Arab-Israeli dispute===\n{{Main|Yom Kippur War}}\nIn 1970, President Nasser of Egypt died and was succeeded by [[Anwar Sadat]], a man whom even more than Kissinger believed in the diplomacy of surprise, in engaging in sudden moves to upset the diplomatic equilibrium. Sadat's liked to say that his favorite game was backgammon, a game where skill and persistence was rewarded, but was best won by sudden gambles, making an analogy between how he played backgammon and conducted his diplomacy.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=393}} Under Nasser, Egypt and Saudi Arabia had engaged what was known as the [[Arab Cold War]], but Sadat got along very well with King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]], forming an alliance between the most populous Arab state and the most wealthiest Arab state. Kissinger later admitted that he was engrossed with the Paris peace talks to end Vietnam war that he and others in Washington missed the significance of the Egyptian-Saudi alliance. At the same that Sadat moved closer to Saudi Arabia, he also wanted a rapprochement with the United States and to move Egypt away from its alliance with the Soviet Union. In July 1972, Sadat expelled all 16, 000 of the Soviet military personnel in Egypt in a signal that he wanted better relations with the United States. Kissinger was taken completely by surprise by Sadat's move, saying: \"Why has he done me this favor? Why didn't he demand all sorts of concessions first?\"{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=393}}\n\nSadat expected as a reward that the United States would respond by pressuring Israel to return the Sinai to Egypt, but after his anti-Soviet move prompted no response from the United States, by November 1972 Sadat moved again closer to the Soviet Union, buying a massive amount of Soviet arms for a war he planned to launch against Israel in 1973. For Sadat, cost was no object as the money to buy Soviet arms came from Saudi Arabia.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=393\u2013394}} At the same time, Faisal promised Sadat that if it should come to war, Saudi Arabia would embargo oil to the West. In April 1973, the Saudi Oil Minister [[Ahmed Zaki Yamani]] visited Washington to meet Kissinger and told him that King Faisal was becoming more and more unhappy with the United States, saying he wanted America to pressure Israel to return all the lands captured in the Six Day War of 1967.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=398\u2013399}} In a later interview, Yamani accused Kissinger of not taking his warning seriously, saying all he did was to ask him not to speak anymore of this threat.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=399}} Angry at Kissinger, Yamani in an interview with the ''Washington Post'' on 19 April 1973 warned that King Faisal was considering an oil embargo.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=399}} At the time, the general feeling in Washington was the Saudis were bluffing and nothing would come of their threat to impose an oil embargo.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=400\u2013401}}&nbsp;The fact that Faisal's ineffectual half brother King Saud had imposed a cripplingly oil embargo on Britain and France during the Suez War of 1956 was not considered an important precedent. The CEOs of four of America's oil companies had after speaking to Faisal arrived in Washington in May 1973 with the warning that Faisal was considerably more tougher, intelligent and ruthless than his half-brother Saud whom he had deposed in 1964, and his threats were serious.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=401\u2013402}} Kissinger declined to meet the four CEOs.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=402}}\n\nIn 1970, American oil production peaked and the United States began to import more and more oil as oil imports rose by 52% between 1969\u20131972.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=415}} Of American oil imports, by 1972 83% were coming from the Middle East.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=415}} Throughout the 1960s, the price for a barrel of oil remained at $1.80, meaning that with the effects of inflation considered the price of oil in real terms got progressively lower and lower throughout the decade with Americans paying less for oil in 1969 than they had in 1959.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=414\u2013415}}Even after a price for a barrel of oil rose to $2.00 in 1971, adjusted for inflation, people in the Western nations were paying less for oil in 1971 than they had in 1958.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=414\u2013415}} The extremely low price of oil served as the basis for the \"long summer\" of prosperity and mass affluence that began in 1945.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=414\u2013415}}\n\nIn an assessment done by Kissinger and his staff about the Middle East in the summer of 1973, the repeated statements by Sadat about waging &nbsp;''jihad'' against Israel were dismissed as empty talk while the warnings from King Faisal were likewise regarded as inconsequential.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=402}}  In September 1973, Nixon fired Rogers as Secretary of State and replaced him with Kissinger. Kissinger was later to state he had not given been enough time to know the Middle East as he settled into the State Department's office at Foggy Bottom as Egypt and Syria attacked Israel on 6 October 1973.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=402}}\n\nDocuments show that Kissinger delayed telling President Richard Nixon about the start of the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973 to keep him from interfering.

The Egyptians broke through the gigantic sand banks of the Bar Lev Line through the simple device of water cannons, and within two hours were Egyptians soldiers were in the Sinai for the first time since 1967.

Kissinger commented: \"Only in the Middle East is it conceivable that a belligerent would ask its adversary's approval for engaging in an act of war against it\".<ref name=Karsh/>\n\nKissinger promised the Israeli Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] the United States would replace its losses in equipment after the war, but sought initially to delay arm shipments to Israel as believed it would improve the odds of making peace along the lines of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242]] calling for a \"land for peace\" deal if an armistice was signed with Egypt and Syria gaining some territory in the Sinai and the Golan Heights respectively.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=408}} The Arab concept of the \"peace of the brave\" (i.e. a victorious leader being magnanimous to his defeated opponents) meant there was a possibility that Sadat at least would make peace with Israel provided that the war ended in such a way that Egypt was not perceived to be defeated. Likewise, Kissinger regarded Meir as being rather arrogant and believed that an armistice that ended the war in a manner that was not an unambiguous Israeli victory would make her more humble.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=408}} As both Syria and Egypt lost much equipment during the fighting, the Soviet Union began to fly new equipment in starting on 12 October, and the Soviet flights to Syria and Egypt were recorded by the British radar stations in Cyprus.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=408}} Through the Soviets were flying in an average of 60 flights per day, exaggerated accounts appeared in Western newspapers speaking of \"one hundred flights per day\".{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=408\u2013409}} At this point, both Nixon and Kissinger began to see the October War more in terms of the Cold War rather than Middle Eastern politics, both seeing the Soviet arms lifts to Egypt and Syria as a Soviet power play that required an American answer.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=408\u2013409}}\n\nIsrael took heavy losses in men and material during the fighting against Egypt and Syria, and on 18 October 1973 Meir requested $850 million worth of American arms and equipment to replace its material losses.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=409\u2013410}} Nixon decided characteristically to act on an epic scale and instead of the $850 million worth of arms requested sent some $2 billion worth of arms to Israel as he boasted that the U.S. Air Force flew more sorties to Israel in October 1973 than it had during the Berlin Airlift of 1948\u201349.<ref>Arnon Gutfeld  and Boaz Vanetik. \"\u2018A Situation That Had to Be Manipulated\u2019: The American Airlift to Israel During the Yom Kippur War.\" ''Middle Eastern Studies'' 52.3 (2016): 419-447.</ref>  In an interview with the British historian [[Robert Lacey]] in 1981, Kissinger later admitted about the arms lift to Israel: \"I made a mistake. In retrospect it was not the best considered decision we made\".{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=411}} The arms lift enraged King Faisal of Saudi Arabia and he retaliated on 20 October 1973 by placing a total embargo on oil shipments to the United States, to be joined by all of the other oil-producing Arab states except Iraq and Libya.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=411\u2013412}} The Arab oil embargo ended the long period of prosperity in the West that had begun in 1945, throwing the world's economy into the steepest economic contraction since the Great Depression.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=414\u2013415}} Lacey wrote about the impact of the Arab oil embargo of 1973\u201374 that for people in the West life suddenly become \"slower, darker and chiller\" as gasoline was rationed, the lights were turned off in Times Square, the \"gas guzzler\" automobiles stopped selling, speed limits became common and restrictions were placed on weekend driving in a bid to conserve fuel.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=415}} As the American automobile industry specialized in producing heavy \"gas guzzler\" vehicles, there was an immediate shift on the part of consumers to the lighter and more fuel efficient vehicles produced by the Japanese and West German automobile industries, sending the American automobile industry into decline. The years from 1945 to 1973 had been a period of unprecedented prosperity in the West, a \"long summer\" that many believed would never end, and its abrupt end in 1973 as the oil embargo which increased the price of oil by 400% within a matter of days threw the world's economy into a sharp recession with unemployment mounting and inflation raging came as a profound shock.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=414\u2013416}} The end of what the French called the ''Trente Glorieuses'' (\"Glorious Thirty\") led to a mood of widespread pessimism in the West with the ''Financial Times'' running a famous headline in late 1973 saying \"The Future will be subject to Delay\".{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=416\u2013417}}\n\nIn the midst of the war, in what journalist Elizabeth Drew called \u201cStrangelove Day,\u201d Kissinger put U.S. military forces on [[DEFCON]] 3 late in the evening of October 24, in what a historian argues is \"best understood as an emotional response to a misunderstanding\" with Soviet ambassador to the United States [[Anatoly Dobrynin]].<ref name=\"Barbara Keys 2011\"/>\n\nIsrael regained the territory it lost in the early fighting and gained new territories from Syria and Egypt, including land in Syria east of the previously captured [[Golan Heights]], and additionally on the western bank of the [[Suez Canal]], although they did lose some territory on the eastern side of the Suez Canal that had been in Israeli hands since the end of the [[Six-Day War]]. During a summit in Cairo on 6 November, Kissinger asked Sadat what Faisal was like and was told: \"Well, Dr. Henry, he will probably go on with you about Communism and the Jews\".{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=417}} King Faisal's two great hatreds were Communism and Zionism as he believed that the Soviet Union and Israel were plotting together against Islam.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=385\u2013386}} When King Faisal was shown a translation into Arabic of ''The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion'', he instantly believed in the authenticity of ''The Protocols'' and therefore talked to anyone who would listen about what he had learned, despite the fact that ''The Protocols'' had been exposed as a forgery in 1921.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=385\u2013386}} On 7 November 1973, Kissinger flew to Riyadh to meet King Faisal and ask him to end the oil embargo in exchange for promising to be \"evenhanded\" with the Arab-Israeli dispute.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=417}} As the plane carrying him prepared to land in Riyadh, Kissinger was clearly nervous at the prospect of negotiating with the stern Wahhabi Faisal who had a marked dislike of Jews.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=417}} Kissinger discovered that King Faisal was a worthy companion to [[L\u00ea \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1ecd]] in terms of stubbornness as the king accused the United States of being biased in favor of Israel, instead engaging in a long rant about the balefulness of \"Jewish Communists\" in Russia and Israel, and despite all of Kissinger's efforts to charm him, refused to end the oil embargo.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=418\u2013419}} In February 1974, King Faisal chaired the second summit of Islamic states (which unlike the first summit Faisal had chaired in 1969 was not boycotted by Iraq and Syria), where he was acclaimed as a conquering hero who humiliated and humbled the West by wrecking its economy, and henceforward Kissinger had to face a bloc of Muslim states who were far more assertive and self-confident than before.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=419\u2013420}}\n\nOnly on 19 March 1974 did the king end the oil embargo after Sadat, whom he trusted, reported to him that the United States was being more \"evenhanded\" and after Kissinger had promised to sell Saudi Arabia weapons that it had previously denied under the grounds that they might be used against Israel.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|pp=420\u2013421}} More importantly, Saudi Arabia had billions of dollars invested in Western banks, and the massive bout of inflation set off by the oil embargo was a threat to this fortune as inflation eroded the value of the money, giving Faisal a vested interest in helping to contain the damage he himself inflicted on the economies of the West.{{sfnp|Lacey|1981|p=421}}\n\nKissinger pressured the Israelis to [[cede]] some of the newly captured land back to its Arab neighbors, contributing to the first phases of Israeli\u2013Egyptian non-aggression. In 1973\u201374, Kissinger engaged in \"shuttle diplomacy\" flying between Tel Avi, Cairo and Damascus in a bid to make the armistice the basis of a preferment peace. Based on his talks with President [[Hafez al Assad]] of Syria, Kissinger concluded the \"Syrians considered Palestine part of a 'greater Syria'\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Pipes|first=Daniel|title=Greater Syria: The History of an Ambition|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1990|p=144|isbn=0195060229}}</ref> Kissinger's first meeting Assad lasted 6 hours and 30 minutes, causing the press to believe for a moment that he had been kidnapped by the Syrians.<ref name=Wright>{{cite news|last=Wright|first=Robin|title=The Assad Family: Nemesis to 9 U.S. Presidents|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=11 April 2017|url= https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-assad-family-nemesis-of-nine-u-s-presidents?verso=true|accessdate=2019-10-30}}</ref> Kissinger called negotiating with Assad \"time-consuming, nerve-racking, and bizarre\".<ref name=Wright/> In his memoirs, Kissinger described during the course of his 28 meetings in Damascus in 1973\u201374 how Assad \"negotiated tenaciously and daringly like a riverboat gambler to make sure he had exacted the last sliver of available concessions\".<ref name=Wright/> Kissinger further described how with Assad: \"His tactic was to open with a statement of the most extreme position to test what the traffic would bear. He might then allow himself to be driven back to the attainable, fighting a dogged rear guard action that made clear that concessions could be exacted only at a heavy price and that discouraged excessive expectations of them. (His negotiating style was in this respect not so different from that of the Israelis, much as both of them would hate the comparison.)\"<ref>{{cite news|last=MacFarquhar|first=Neill|title=Hafez al-Assad, Who Turned Syria Into a Power in the Middle East, Dies at 69|newspaper=The New York Times|date=11 June 2000|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/11/world/hafez-al-assad-who-turned-syria-into-a-power-in-the-middle-east-dies-at-69.html|accessdate=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\nBy contrast, Kissinger's negotiations with Sadat, through not without difficulties, were more fruitful. The move saw a warming in [[Foreign relations of Egypt#United States|U.S.\u2013Egyptian relations]], bitter since the 1950s, as the country moved away from its former independent stance and into a close partnership with the United States. The peace was finalized in 1978 when U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] mediated the [[Camp David Accords (1978)|Camp David Accords]], during which Israel returned the [[Sinai Peninsula]] in exchange for an Egyptian peace agreement that included the recognition of the state of Israel.\n\n===The Persian Gulf===\nA major concern for Kissinger was the possibility of Soviet influence in the oil-rich region of the Persian Gulf. Iraq had been ruled by the Baath Party since 1968, and in April 1969 came into conflict with Iran when Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] renounced the 1937 treaty governing the Shatt-al-Arab river.

Article 1.] Published 31 March 2004. Accessed 17 August 2008.</ref> Drug therapy ([[pharmacotherapy]]) is an important part of the [[medicine|medical field]] and relies on the science of [[pharmacology]] for continual advancement and on [[pharmacy]] for appropriate management.\n\nDrugs are [[Drug class|classified]] in multiple ways. One of the key divisions is by level of [[controlled substance|control]], which distinguishes [[prescription drug]]s (those that a [[pharmacist]] dispenses only on the [[medical prescription|order]] of a [[physician]], [[physician assistant]], or qualified [[nursing|nurse]]) from [[over-the-counter drug]]s (those that consumers can order for themselves). Another key distinction is between traditional [[small molecule|small-molecule]] drugs, usually derived from [[chemical synthesis]], and [[biopharmaceutical]]s, which include [[recombinant proteins]], [[vaccine]]s, [[blood product]]s used [[therapy|therapeutically]] (such as [[IVIG]]), [[gene therapy]], [[Monoclonal antibody|monoclonal antibodies]] and [[cell therapy]] (for instance, [[stem cell|stem-cell]] therapies). Other ways to classify medicines are by mode of action, [[route of administration]], [[biological system]] affected, or [[therapeutic effect]]s. An elaborate and widely used classification system is the [[Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System]] (ATC system). The [[World Health Organization]] keeps a list of [[essential medicines]].\n\n[[Drug discovery]] and [[drug development]] are complex and expensive endeavors undertaken by [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical companies]], academic scientists, and governments. As a result of this complex path from discovery to commercialization, partnering has become a standard practice for advancing drug candidates through development pipelines.

The drug may contain a single or multiple [[active ingredient]]s.\n\nThere are many variations in the [[routes of administration]], including [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] (into the blood through a vein) and [[oral administration]] (through the mouth).\n\nThey can be administered all at once as a [[bolus (medicine)|bolus]], at frequent intervals or continuously. Frequencies are often abbreviated from Latin, such as ''every 8 hours'' reading Q8H from ''Quaque VIII Hora''.\n\n==Drug discovery==\n{{clear left}}\n{{Main|Drug discovery}}\nIn the fields of [[medicine]], [[biotechnology]] and [[pharmacology]], drug discovery is the process by which new drugs are discovered.\n\nHistorically, drugs were discovered through identifying the active ingredient from traditional remedies or by [[serendipity|serendipitous]] discovery.  Later [[chemical library|chemical libraries]] of synthetic [[small molecule]]s, [[natural product]]s or [[extract]]s were screened in intact cells or whole organisms to identify substances that have a desirable [[therapeutic]] effect in a process known as\n[[classical pharmacology]].  Since [[Human Genome Project|sequencing]] of the [[human genome]] which allowed rapid cloning and synthesis of large quantities of purified proteins, it has become common practice to use [[high throughput screening]] of large compounds libraries against isolated [[biological target]]s which are hypothesized to be disease-modifying in a process known as [[reverse pharmacology]].  Hits from these screens are then tested in cells and then in animals for [[efficacy]].  Even more recently, scientists have been able to understand the shape of biological molecules at the atomic level, and to use that knowledge to design (see [[drug design]]) drug candidates.\n\nModern drug discovery involves the identification of screening hits, [[medicinal chemistry]] and optimization of those hits to increase the [[Affinity (pharmacology)#Protein-ligand binding|affinity]], [[binding selectivity|selectivity]] (to reduce the potential of side effects), efficacy/[[potency (pharmacology)|potency]], [[Metabolism|metabolic]] stability (to increase the [[Biological half-life|half-life]]), and oral [[bioavailability]]. Once a compound that fulfills all of these requirements has been identified, it will begin the process of [[drug development]] prior to [[clinical trial]]s. One or more of these steps may, but not necessarily, involve [[computer-aided drug design]].\n\nDespite advances in technology and understanding of biological systems, drug discovery is still a lengthy, \"expensive, difficult, and inefficient process\" with low rate of new therapeutic discovery.<ref name=Anson2009>{{Cite news\n |last1=Anson\n |first1=Blake D.\n |last2=Ma\n |first2=Junyi\n |last3=He\n |first3=Jia-Qiang\n |date=1 May 2009\n |title=Identifying Cardiotoxic Compounds\n |periodical=Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News\n |series=TechNote\n |publisher=Mary Ann Liebert\n |volume=29\n |issue=9\n |pages=34\u201335\n |url=http://www.genengnews.com/articles/chitem_print.aspx?aid=2890&chid=0\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921025805/http://www.genengnews.com/articles/chitem_print.aspx?aid=2890&chid=0\n |archivedate=21 September 2012\n |issn=1935-472X\n |oclc=77706455\n |accessdate=25 July 2009\n |url-status=dead\n |df=\n}}</ref> In 2010, the research and development cost of each [[new molecular entity]] (NME) was approximately US$1.8 billion.<ref>{{cite journal | volume = 9 | pages = 203\u2013214 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1038/nrd3078 | title = How to improve R&D productivity: the pharmaceutical industry's grand challenge |author1=Steven M.

In some countries, such as the United States, they are regulated at the national level by a single agency. In other jurisdictions they are regulated at the state level, or at both state and national levels by various bodies, as is the case in Australia.  The role of therapeutic goods regulation is designed mainly to protect the health and safety of the population. Regulation is aimed at ensuring the safety, quality, and efficacy of the therapeutic goods which are covered under the scope of the regulation. In most jurisdictions, therapeutic goods must be registered before they are allowed to be marketed. There is usually some degree of restriction of the availability of certain therapeutic goods depending on their risk to consumers.\n\nDepending upon the [[jurisdiction]], drugs may be divided into [[over-the-counter drug]]s (OTC) which may be available without special restrictions, and [[prescription drug]]s, which must be [[Medical prescription|prescribed]] by a licensed medical practitioner in accordance with [[medical guideline]]s due to the risk of adverse effects and [[contraindication]]s. The precise distinction between OTC and prescription depends on the legal [[jurisdiction]]. A third category, \"behind-the-counter\" drugs, is implemented in some jurisdictions. These do not require a prescription, but must be kept in the [[dispensary]], not visible to the public, and only be sold by a [[pharmacist]] or [[pharmacy technician]]. Doctors may also prescribe prescription drugs for [[off-label use]] \u2013 purposes which the drugs were not originally approved for by the regulatory agency. The [[Classification of Pharmaco-Therapeutic Referrals]] helps guide the referral process between pharmacists and doctors.\n\nThe [[International Narcotics Control Board]] of the [[United Nations]] imposes a world law of [[prohibition]] of certain drugs. They publish a lengthy list of chemicals and plants whose trade and consumption (where applicable) is forbidden. OTC drugs are sold without restriction as they are considered safe enough that most people will not hurt themselves accidentally by taking it as instructed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Medication Safety|url=http://www.housefindings.com/tips-for-medication-safety/|website=House Findings|accessdate=21 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914133316/http://www.housefindings.com/tips-for-medication-safety/|archive-date=14 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Many countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]] have a third category of \"pharmacy medicines\", which can only be sold in registered [[pharmacy|pharmacies]] by or under the supervision of a [[pharmacist]].\n\n[[Medical error]]s include overprescription and [[polypharmacy]], misprescription, contraindication and lack of detail in dosage and administrations instructions.

Penicillin, introduced a few years later, provided a broader spectrum of activity compared to sulfa drugs and reduced side effects. Streptomycin, found in 1942, proved to be the first drug effective against the cause of tuberculosis and also came to be the best known of a long series of important antibiotics. A second generation of antibiotics was introduced in the 1940s: aureomycin and chloramphenicol. Aureomycin was the best known of the second generation.\n\nLithium was discovered in the 19th century for nervous disorders and its possible mood-stabilizing or prophylactic effect; it was cheap and easily produced. As lithium fell out of favor in France, valpromide came into play. This antibiotic was the origin of the drug that eventually created the mood stabilizer category. Valpromide had distinct psychotrophic effects that were of benefit in both the treatment of acute manic states and in the maintenance treatment of manic depression illness. Psychotropics can either be sedative or stimulant; sedatives aim at damping down the extremes of behavior. Stimulants aim at restoring normality by increasing tone. Soon arose the notion of a tranquilizer which was quite different from any sedative or stimulant. The term tranquilizer took over the notions of sedatives and became the dominant term in the West through the 1980s. In Japan, during this time, the term tranquilizer produced the notion of a psyche-stabilizer and the term mood stabilizer vanished.<ref name=\"ToneAndrea\">Tone, Andrea and Elizabeth Watkins, ''Medicating Modern America: Prescription Drugs in History''.

HRT is not a life-saving drug, nor does it cure any disease. HRT has been prescribed to improve one's quality of life. Doctors prescribe estrogen for their older female patients both to treat short-term menopausal symptoms and to prevent long-term diseases. In the 1960s and early 1970s, more and more physicians began to prescribe estrogen for their female patients. between 1991 and 1999, Premarin was listed as the most popular prescription and best-selling drug in America.<ref name=\"ToneAndrea\" />\n\nThe first oral contraceptive, Enovid, was approved by FDA in 1960. Oral contraceptives inhibit ovulation and so prevent conception. Enovid was known to be much more effective than alternatives including the condom and the diaphragm. As early as 1960, oral contraceptives were available in several different strengths by every manufacturer. In the 1980s and 1990s, an increasing number of options arose including, most recently, a new [[drug delivery|delivery system]] for the oral contraceptive via a transdermal patch. In 1982, a new version of the Pill was introduced, known as the \"biphasic\" pill. By 1985, a new triphasic pill was approved. Physicians began to think of the Pill as an excellent means of birth control for young women.<ref name=\"ToneAndrea\" />\n\nStimulants such as Ritalin (methylphenidate) came to be pervasive tools for behavior management and modification in young children. Ritalin was first marketed in 1955 for narcolepsy; its potential users were middle-aged and the elderly. It wasn't until some time in the 1980s along with hyperactivity in children that Ritalin came onto the market. Medical use of methlyphenidate is predominantly for symptoms of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Consumption of methylphenidate in the U.S. out-paced all other countries between 1991 and 1999. Significant growth in consumption was also evident in Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and Norway. Currently, 85% of the world's methylphanidate is consumed in America.<ref name=\"ToneAndrea\" />\n\nThe first minor tranquilizer was Meprobamate. Only fourteen months after it was made available, meprobamate had become the country's largest-selling prescription drug. By 1957, meprobamate had become the fastest-growing drug in history. The popularity of meprobamate paved the way for Librium and Valium, two minor tranquilizers that belonged to a new chemical class of drugs called the benzodiazepines. These were drugs that worked chiefly as anti-anxiety agents and muscle relaxants. The first benzodiazepine was Librium. Three months after it was approved, Librium had become the most prescribed tranquilizer in the nation. Three years later, Valium hit the shelves and was ten times more effective as a muscle relaxant and anti-convulsant. Valium was the most versatile of the minor tranquilizers. Later came the widespread adoption of major tranquilizers such as chlorpromazine and the drug reserpine. In 1970, sales began to decline for Valium and Librium, but sales of new and improved tranquilizers, such as Xanax, introduced in 1981 for the newly created diagnosis of panic disorder, soared.<ref name=\"ToneAndrea\" />\n\nMevacor (lovastatin) is the first and most influential statin in the American market. The 1991 launch of Pravachol (pravastatin), the second available in the United States, and the release of Zocor (simvastatin) made Mevacor no longer the only statin on the market.\nIn 1998, Viagra was released as a treatment for erectile dysfunction.<ref name=\"ToneAndrea\" />\n\n===Ancient pharmacology===\nUsing plants and plant substances to treat all kinds of diseases and medical conditions is believed to date back to [[prehistoric medicine]].\n\nThe [[Kahun Gynaecological Papyrus]], the oldest known medical text of any kind, dates to about 1800 BC and represents the first documented use of any kind of drug.<ref>Griffith, F.

The Second World War saw the introduction of widespread and effective antimicrobial therapy with the development and mass production of [[penicillin]] antibiotics, made possible by the pressures of the war and the collaboration of British scientists with the American [[pharmaceutical industry]].\n\nMedicines commonly used by the late 1920s included [[aspirin]], [[codeine]], and [[morphine]] for pain; [[Digoxin|digitalis]], [[nitroglycerin]], and [[quinine]] for heart disorders, and [[insulin]] for diabetes. Other drugs included [[antitoxin]]s, a few biological vaccines, and a few synthetic drugs. In the 1930s, antibiotics emerged: first [[sulfa drug]]s, then [[penicillin]] and other antibiotics.

Although often accepted as an advance in some ways, there was some opposition, due to serious adverse effects such as [[tardive dyskinesia]]. Patients often opposed psychiatry and refused or stopped taking the drugs when not subject to psychiatric control.\n\nGovernments have been heavily involved in the regulation of drug development and drug sales. In the U.S., the [[Elixir Sulfanilamide disaster]] led to the establishment of the [[Food and Drug Administration]], and the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act required manufacturers to file new drugs with the FDA. The 1951 Humphrey-Durham Amendment required certain drugs to be sold by prescription. In 1962, a subsequent amendment required new drugs to be tested for efficacy and safety in [[clinical trial]]s.<ref name=Reasonable/>{{rp|24\u201326}}\n\nUntil the 1970s, drug prices were not a major concern for doctors and patients. As more drugs became prescribed for chronic illnesses, however, costs became burdensome, and by the 1970s nearly every U.S. state required or encouraged the substitution of [[generic drugs]] for higher-priced brand names. This also led to the 2006 U.S. law, [[Medicare Part D]], which offers Medicare coverage for drugs.<ref name=Reasonable/>{{rp|28\u201329}}\n\nAs of 2008, the United States is the leader in [[medical research]], including pharmaceutical development. U.S. drug prices are among the highest in the world, and drug innovation is correspondingly high. In 2000, U.S.-based firms developed 29 of the 75 top-selling drugs; firms from the second-largest market, Japan, developed eight, and the United Kingdom contributed 10. France, which imposes price controls, developed three.

Often grouped under the labels of compassionate use, [[expanded access]], or named patient supply, these programs are governed by rules which vary by country defining access criteria, data collection, promotion, and control of drug distribution.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Helene S |title=EU Compassionate Use Programmes (CUPs): Regulatory Framework and Points to Consider before CUP Implementation |url=http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Fulltext/2010/24040/EU_Compassionate_Use_Programmes__CUPs___Regulatory.4.aspx |journal=Pharm Med |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=223\u2013229 |year=2010 |doi=10.1007/bf03256820 |access-date=20 January 2014 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707082132/http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Fulltext/2010/24040/EU_Compassionate_Use_Programmes__CUPs___Regulatory.4.aspx |archive-date=7 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nWithin the United States, pre-approval demand is generally met through [[treatment IND]] (investigational new drug) applications (INDs), or single-patient INDs. These mechanisms, which fall under the label of expanded access programs, provide access to drugs for groups of patients or individuals residing in the US. Outside the US, Named Patient Programs provide controlled, pre-approval access to drugs in response to requests by physicians on behalf of specific, or \"named\", patients before those medicines are licensed in the patient's home country.  Through these programs, patients are able to access drugs in late-stage clinical trials or approved in other countries for a genuine, unmet medical need, before those drugs have been licensed in the patient's home country.\n\nPatients who have not been able to get access to drugs in development have organized and advocated for greater access.

One of the key divisions is by level of [[controlled substance|control]], which distinguishes [[prescription drug]]s (those that a [[pharmacist]] dispenses only on the [[medical prescription|order]] of a [[physician]], [[physician assistant]], or qualified [[nursing|nurse]]) from [[over-the-counter drug]]s (those that consumers can order for themselves). Another key distinction is between traditional [[small molecule|small-molecule]] drugs, usually derived from [[chemical synthesis]], and [[biopharmaceutical]]s, which include [[recombinant proteins]], [[vaccine]]s, [[blood product]]s used [[therapy|therapeutically]] (such as [[IVIG]]), [[gene therapy]], [[Monoclonal antibody|monoclonal antibodies]] and [[cell therapy]] (for instance, [[stem cell|stem-cell]] therapies). Other ways to classify medicines are by mode of action, [[route of administration]], [[biological system]] affected, or [[therapeutic effect]]s. An elaborate and widely used classification system is the [[Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System]] (ATC system). The [[World Health Organization]] keeps a list of [[essential medicines]].\n\n[[Drug discovery]] and [[drug development]] are complex and expensive endeavors undertaken by [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical companies]], academic scientists, and governments. As a result of this complex path from discovery to commercialization, partnering has become a standard practice for advancing drug candidates through development pipelines.  Governments generally regulate what drugs can be marketed, [[pharmaceutical marketing|how drugs are marketed]], and in some jurisdictions, drug pricing.   Controversies have arisen over drug pricing and disposal of used drugs.\n\n==Definition==\nIn Europe, the term is \"medicinal product\", and it is defined by EU law as:\n\n* \"Any substance or combination of substances presented as having properties for treating or preventing disease in human beings; or\"\n* \"Any substance or combination of substances which may be used in or administered to human beings either with a view to restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions by exerting a [[pharmacological]], [[immunological]] or metabolic action, or to making a [[medical diagnosis]].\"<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/health/files/eudralex/vol-1/dir_2004_27/dir_2004_27_en.pdf Directive 2004/27/EC] Official Journal of the European Union. 30 April 2004 L136</ref>{{rp|36}}\n\nIn the US, a \"drug\" is:\n* A substance recognized by an official pharmacopeia or formulary.\n* A substance intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.\n* A substance (other than [[food]]) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.\n* A substance intended for use as a component of a medicine but not a device or a component, part or accessory of a device.\n* Biological products are included within this definition and are generally covered by the same laws and regulations, but differences exist regarding their manufacturing processes (chemical process versus biological process).<ref>FDA [https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/ucm079436.htm Glossary]</ref>\n\n==Usage==\nDrug use among elderly Americans has been studied; in a group of 2377 people with average age of 71 surveyed between 2005 and 2006, 84% took at least one prescription drug, 44% took at least one [[over-the-counter]] (OTC) drug, and 52% took at least one [[dietary supplement]]; in a group of 2245 elderly Americans (average age of 71) surveyed over the period 2010 \u2013 2011, those percentages were 88%, 38%, and 64%.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Qato DM|last2=Wilder J|last3=Schumm L|last4=Gillet V|last5=Alexander G|date=1 April 2016|title=Changes in prescription and over-the-counter medication and dietary supplement use among older adults in the united states, 2005 vs 2011|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|volume=176|issue=4|pages=473\u2013482|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.8581|pmid=26998708 |pmc=5024734}}</ref>\n\n== Classification ==\n{{main|Drug class}}\nOne of the key classifications is between traditional [[small molecule]] drugs; usually derived from chemical synthesis, and [[biologic medical product]]s; which include [[recombinant proteins]], [[vaccines]], [[blood products]] used therapeutically (such as [[IVIG]]), [[gene therapy]], and [[cell therapy]] (for instance, [[stem cell]] therapies).\n\nPharmaceuticals or drugs or medicines are classified in various other groups besides their origin on the basis of pharmacological properties like mode of action and their pharmacological action or activity,<ref>http://www.epgonline.org database of prescription pharmaceutical products including drug classifications [http://www.epgonline.org/class.cfm]</ref> such as by [[chemical property|chemical properties]], mode or [[route of administration]], [[biological system]] affected, or [[therapeutic effect]]s.

The drug may contain a single or multiple [[active ingredient]]s.\n\nThere are many variations in the [[routes of administration]], including [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] (into the blood through a vein) and [[oral administration]] (through the mouth).\n\nThey can be administered all at once as a [[bolus (medicine)|bolus]], at frequent intervals or continuously. Frequencies are often abbreviated from Latin, such as ''every 8 hours'' reading Q8H from ''Quaque VIII Hora''.\n\n==Drug discovery==\n{{clear left}}\n{{Main|Drug discovery}}\nIn the fields of [[medicine]], [[biotechnology]] and [[pharmacology]], drug discovery is the process by which new drugs are discovered.\n\nHistorically, drugs were discovered through identifying the active ingredient from traditional remedies or by [[serendipity|serendipitous]] discovery.  Later [[chemical library|chemical libraries]] of synthetic [[small molecule]]s, [[natural product]]s or [[extract]]s were screened in intact cells or whole organisms to identify substances that have a desirable [[therapeutic]] effect in a process known as\n[[classical pharmacology]].  Since [[Human Genome Project|sequencing]] of the [[human genome]] which allowed rapid cloning and synthesis of large quantities of purified proteins, it has become common practice to use [[high throughput screening]] of large compounds libraries against isolated [[biological target]]s which are hypothesized to be disease-modifying in a process known as [[reverse pharmacology]].  Hits from these screens are then tested in cells and then in animals for [[efficacy]].  Even more recently, scientists have been able to understand the shape of biological molecules at the atomic level, and to use that knowledge to design (see [[drug design]]) drug candidates.\n\nModern drug discovery involves the identification of screening hits, [[medicinal chemistry]] and optimization of those hits to increase the [[Affinity (pharmacology)#Protein-ligand binding|affinity]], [[binding selectivity|selectivity]] (to reduce the potential of side effects), efficacy/[[potency (pharmacology)|potency]], [[Metabolism|metabolic]] stability (to increase the [[Biological half-life|half-life]]), and oral [[bioavailability]]. Once a compound that fulfills all of these requirements has been identified, it will begin the process of [[drug development]] prior to [[clinical trial]]s. One or more of these steps may, but not necessarily, involve [[computer-aided drug design]].\n\nDespite advances in technology and understanding of biological systems, drug discovery is still a lengthy, \"expensive, difficult, and inefficient process\" with low rate of new therapeutic discovery.<ref name=Anson2009>{{Cite news\n |last1=Anson\n |first1=Blake D.\n |last2=Ma\n |first2=Junyi\n |last3=He\n |first3=Jia-Qiang\n |date=1 May 2009\n |title=Identifying Cardiotoxic Compounds\n |periodical=Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News\n |series=TechNote\n |publisher=Mary Ann Liebert\n |volume=29\n |issue=9\n |pages=34\u201335\n |url=http://www.genengnews.com/articles/chitem_print.aspx?aid=2890&chid=0\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921025805/http://www.genengnews.com/articles/chitem_print.aspx?aid=2890&chid=0\n |archivedate=21 September 2012\n |issn=1935-472X\n |oclc=77706455\n |accessdate=25 July 2009\n |url-status=dead\n |df=\n}}</ref> In 2010, the research and development cost of each [[new molecular entity]] (NME) was approximately US$1.8 billion.<ref>{{cite journal | volume = 9 | pages = 203\u2013214 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1038/nrd3078 | title = How to improve R&D productivity: the pharmaceutical industry's grand challenge |author1=Steven M.

In some countries, such as the United States, they are regulated at the national level by a single agency. In other jurisdictions they are regulated at the state level, or at both state and national levels by various bodies, as is the case in Australia.  The role of therapeutic goods regulation is designed mainly to protect the health and safety of the population. Regulation is aimed at ensuring the safety, quality, and efficacy of the therapeutic goods which are covered under the scope of the regulation. In most jurisdictions, therapeutic goods must be registered before they are allowed to be marketed. There is usually some degree of restriction of the availability of certain therapeutic goods depending on their risk to consumers.\n\nDepending upon the [[jurisdiction]], drugs may be divided into [[over-the-counter drug]]s (OTC) which may be available without special restrictions, and [[prescription drug]]s, which must be [[Medical prescription|prescribed]] by a licensed medical practitioner in accordance with [[medical guideline]]s due to the risk of adverse effects and [[contraindication]]s. The precise distinction between OTC and prescription depends on the legal [[jurisdiction]]. A third category, \"behind-the-counter\" drugs, is implemented in some jurisdictions. These do not require a prescription, but must be kept in the [[dispensary]], not visible to the public, and only be sold by a [[pharmacist]] or [[pharmacy technician]]. Doctors may also prescribe prescription drugs for [[off-label use]] \u2013 purposes which the drugs were not originally approved for by the regulatory agency. The [[Classification of Pharmaco-Therapeutic Referrals]] helps guide the referral process between pharmacists and doctors.\n\nThe [[International Narcotics Control Board]] of the [[United Nations]] imposes a world law of [[prohibition]] of certain drugs. They publish a lengthy list of chemicals and plants whose trade and consumption (where applicable) is forbidden. OTC drugs are sold without restriction as they are considered safe enough that most people will not hurt themselves accidentally by taking it as instructed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Medication Safety|url=http://www.housefindings.com/tips-for-medication-safety/|website=House Findings|accessdate=21 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914133316/http://www.housefindings.com/tips-for-medication-safety/|archive-date=14 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Many countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]] have a third category of \"pharmacy medicines\", which can only be sold in registered [[pharmacy|pharmacies]] by or under the supervision of a [[pharmacist]].\n\n[[Medical error]]s include overprescription and [[polypharmacy]], misprescription, contraindication and lack of detail in dosage and administrations instructions.

Penicillin, introduced a few years later, provided a broader spectrum of activity compared to sulfa drugs and reduced side effects. Streptomycin, found in 1942, proved to be the first drug effective against the cause of tuberculosis and also came to be the best known of a long series of important antibiotics. A second generation of antibiotics was introduced in the 1940s: aureomycin and chloramphenicol. Aureomycin was the best known of the second generation.\n\nLithium was discovered in the 19th century for nervous disorders and its possible mood-stabilizing or prophylactic effect; it was cheap and easily produced. As lithium fell out of favor in France, valpromide came into play. This antibiotic was the origin of the drug that eventually created the mood stabilizer category. Valpromide had distinct psychotrophic effects that were of benefit in both the treatment of acute manic states and in the maintenance treatment of manic depression illness. Psychotropics can either be sedative or stimulant; sedatives aim at damping down the extremes of behavior. Stimulants aim at restoring normality by increasing tone. Soon arose the notion of a tranquilizer which was quite different from any sedative or stimulant. The term tranquilizer took over the notions of sedatives and became the dominant term in the West through the 1980s. In Japan, during this time, the term tranquilizer produced the notion of a psyche-stabilizer and the term mood stabilizer vanished.<ref name=\"ToneAndrea\">Tone, Andrea and Elizabeth Watkins, ''Medicating Modern America: Prescription Drugs in History''.

HRT is not a life-saving drug, nor does it cure any disease. HRT has been prescribed to improve one's quality of life. Doctors prescribe estrogen for their older female patients both to treat short-term menopausal symptoms and to prevent long-term diseases. In the 1960s and early 1970s, more and more physicians began to prescribe estrogen for their female patients. between 1991 and 1999, Premarin was listed as the most popular prescription and best-selling drug in America.<ref name=\"ToneAndrea\" />\n\nThe first oral contraceptive, Enovid, was approved by FDA in 1960. Oral contraceptives inhibit ovulation and so prevent conception. Enovid was known to be much more effective than alternatives including the condom and the diaphragm. As early as 1960, oral contraceptives were available in several different strengths by every manufacturer. In the 1980s and 1990s, an increasing number of options arose including, most recently, a new [[drug delivery|delivery system]] for the oral contraceptive via a transdermal patch. In 1982, a new version of the Pill was introduced, known as the \"biphasic\" pill. By 1985, a new triphasic pill was approved. Physicians began to think of the Pill as an excellent means of birth control for young women.<ref name=\"ToneAndrea\" />\n\nStimulants such as Ritalin (methylphenidate) came to be pervasive tools for behavior management and modification in young children. Ritalin was first marketed in 1955 for narcolepsy; its potential users were middle-aged and the elderly. It wasn't until some time in the 1980s along with hyperactivity in children that Ritalin came onto the market. Medical use of methlyphenidate is predominantly for symptoms of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Consumption of methylphenidate in the U.S. out-paced all other countries between 1991 and 1999. Significant growth in consumption was also evident in Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and Norway. Currently, 85% of the world's methylphanidate is consumed in America.<ref name=\"ToneAndrea\" />\n\nThe first minor tranquilizer was Meprobamate. Only fourteen months after it was made available, meprobamate had become the country's largest-selling prescription drug. By 1957, meprobamate had become the fastest-growing drug in history. The popularity of meprobamate paved the way for Librium and Valium, two minor tranquilizers that belonged to a new chemical class of drugs called the benzodiazepines. These were drugs that worked chiefly as anti-anxiety agents and muscle relaxants. The first benzodiazepine was Librium. Three months after it was approved, Librium had become the most prescribed tranquilizer in the nation. Three years later, Valium hit the shelves and was ten times more effective as a muscle relaxant and anti-convulsant. Valium was the most versatile of the minor tranquilizers. Later came the widespread adoption of major tranquilizers such as chlorpromazine and the drug reserpine. In 1970, sales began to decline for Valium and Librium, but sales of new and improved tranquilizers, such as Xanax, introduced in 1981 for the newly created diagnosis of panic disorder, soared.<ref name=\"ToneAndrea\" />\n\nMevacor (lovastatin) is the first and most influential statin in the American market.

Although often accepted as an advance in some ways, there was some opposition, due to serious adverse effects such as [[tardive dyskinesia]]. Patients often opposed psychiatry and refused or stopped taking the drugs when not subject to psychiatric control.\n\nGovernments have been heavily involved in the regulation of drug development and drug sales. In the U.S., the [[Elixir Sulfanilamide disaster]] led to the establishment of the [[Food and Drug Administration]], and the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act required manufacturers to file new drugs with the FDA. The 1951 Humphrey-Durham Amendment required certain drugs to be sold by prescription.

As more drugs became prescribed for chronic illnesses, however, costs became burdensome, and by the 1970s nearly every U.S. state required or encouraged the substitution of [[generic drugs]] for higher-priced brand names. This also led to the 2006 U.S. law, [[Medicare Part D]], which offers Medicare coverage for drugs.<ref name=Reasonable/>{{rp|28\u201329}}\n\nAs of 2008, the United States is the leader in [[medical research]], including pharmaceutical development.

Often grouped under the labels of compassionate use, [[expanded access]], or named patient supply, these programs are governed by rules which vary by country defining access criteria, data collection, promotion, and control of drug distribution.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Helene S |title=EU Compassionate Use Programmes (CUPs): Regulatory Framework and Points to Consider before CUP Implementation |url=http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Fulltext/2010/24040/EU_Compassionate_Use_Programmes__CUPs___Regulatory.4.aspx |journal=Pharm Med |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=223\u2013229 |year=2010 |doi=10.1007/bf03256820 |access-date=20 January 2014 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707082132/http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Fulltext/2010/24040/EU_Compassionate_Use_Programmes__CUPs___Regulatory.4.aspx |archive-date=7 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nWithin the United States, pre-approval demand is generally met through [[treatment IND]] (investigational new drug) applications (INDs), or single-patient INDs. These mechanisms, which fall under the label of expanded access programs, provide access to drugs for groups of patients or individuals residing in the US. Outside the US, Named Patient Programs provide controlled, pre-approval access to drugs in response to requests by physicians on behalf of specific, or \"named\", patients before those medicines are licensed in the patient's home country.  Through these programs, patients are able to access drugs in late-stage clinical trials or approved in other countries for a genuine, unmet medical need, before those drugs have been licensed in the patient's home country.\n\nPatients who have not been able to get access to drugs in development have organized and advocated for greater access.
