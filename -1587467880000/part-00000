{"title_page": "Justice delayed is justice denied", "text_new": "{{short description|Legal maxim}}\n'''\"Justice delayed is justice denied\"''' is a [[legal maxim]] meaning that if [[Legal remedy|legal redress]] or [[Equitable relief|equitable relief]] is available for a party that has suffered some injury, but is not forthcoming in a timely fashion, it is effectively the same as having no redress at all. This principle is the basis for the right to a [[speedy trial]] and similar rights which are meant to expedite the legal system, because it is unfair for the injured party to have to sustain the injury with little hope for resolution. The phrase has become a rallying cry for [[law reform|legal reformers]] who view [[court]]s or [[government]]s as acting too slowly in resolving legal issues either because the existing system is too complex or overburdened, or because the issue or party in question lacks political favour. When a court takes a matter \"under advisement\" {{ndash}} awaiting the issuance of a [[judicial opinion]], [[Court order|order]] or [[judgement]] and forestalls [[Adjudication|adjudication]] {{ndash}} the issue of timeliness of the decision comes into play.\n\n== Origin ==\nThere are conflicting accounts of who first noted the phrase.

He used as illustrated \"a synonym of delay\" which yielded only disastrous consequences for the participants. The estate's court case goes on for 12 years, for reasons no one understands, and the entire estate is itself dissipated in the battle. As one writer notes:\n<blockquote>In the Victorian era, the Court of Chancery was a synonym of delay. In Bleak House Dickens invented a fictional legal case named ''[[Jarndyce and Jarndyce]]'' in order to caricature the legal system of England, and the iniquity of Chancery chiefly takes the form of procrastination: \"Jarndyce and Jarndyce drones on. This scarecrow of a suit has, in course of time, become so complicated, that no man alive knows what it means\" (BH1 16). As a consequence of this protraction, many characters involved in Jarndyce and Jarndyce are tortured by being held in painful anxiety\" one goes insand and another's mind is consumed with \u201ccorroding care, suspense, distrust, and doubt\u201d (BH 630).\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dickens.jp/archive/bh/bh-tsutsui.pdf|title=Delay and Suspense in Bleak House |last1=Mizuki |first1=Tsutsui |format=PDF |access-date=April 19, 2020}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the preface to ''Bleak House'', Dickens cites two Chancery cases as especial inspirations, one of which was a \"[[friendly suit]]\":\n\n{{Quote|text=At the present moment (August, 1853) there is a suit before the court which was commenced nearly twenty years ago, in which from thirty to forty counsel have been known to appear at one time, in which costs have been incurred to the amount of seventy thousand pounds, which is A FRIENDLY SUIT, and which is (I am assured) no nearer to its termination now than when it was begun.

He used as illustrated \"a synonym of delay\" which yielded only disastrous consequences for the participants. The estate's court case goes on for 12 years, for reasons no one understands, and the entire estate is itself dissipated in the battle. As one writer notes:\n<blockquote>In the Victorian era, the Court of Chancery was a synonym of delay. In Bleak House Dickens invented a fictional legal case named ''[[Jarndyce and Jarndyce]]'' in order to caricature the legal system of England, and the iniquity of Chancery chiefly takes the form of procrastination: \"Jarndyce and Jarndyce drones on. This scarecrow of a suit has, in course of time, become so complicated, that no man alive knows what it means\" (BH1 16). As a consequence of this protraction, many characters involved in Jarndyce and Jarndyce are tortured by being held in painful anxiety\" one goes insand and another's mind is consumed with \u201ccorroding care, suspense, distrust, and doubt\u201d (BH 630).\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dickens.jp/archive/bh/bh-tsutsui.pdf|title=Delay and Suspense in Bleak House |last1=Mizuki |first1=Tsutsui |format=PDF |access-date=April 19, 2020}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the preface to ''Bleak House'', Dickens cites two Chancery cases as especial inspirations, one of which was a \"[[friendly suit]]\":\n\n{{Quote|text=At the present moment (August, 1853) there is a suit before the court which was commenced nearly twenty years ago, in which from thirty to forty counsel have been known to appear at one time, in which costs have been incurred to the amount of seventy thousand pounds, which is A FRIENDLY SUIT, and which is (I am assured) no nearer to its termination now than when it was begun. There is another well-known suit in Chancery, not yet decided, which was commenced before the close of the last century and in which more than double the amount of seventy thousand pounds has been swallowed up in costs.}}\n\nBased on an 1853 [[Letters of Charles Dickens|letter of Dickens]],<ref>{{cite book |first1=Graham, Editor |last1=Storey |first2=Kathleen, Editor |last2=Tillotson |first3=Angus, Editor |last3=Easson |title=The Letters of Charles Dickens, VII |year=1993 |pages=128-129}}</ref> the first of these cases has been identified<ref name=\"dunstan\">{{cite journal |last1=Dunstan  |first1=William |title=The Real Jarndyce and Jarndyce |work=The Dickensian |volume=93.441 |date=Spring, 1997) |page=27}}</ref><ref name=\"katz\">{{cite journal |last1=Katz |first1=Leslie |title=''Bleak House'' in Australian Reasons for Judgment (July 21, 2017). |url= https://ssrn.com/abstract=1315862 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1315862|via=SSRN}}</ref> as the dispute over the will of [[Charles_Day_(boot_blacking_manufacturer)|Charles Day]], a boot blacking manufacturer who died in 1836.

These are related to the steep topography, often little vegetation cover and intense convective rainfall.

Median sediment concentration in the river water is 1.57 grammes per litre, but may go up to 106 g/L.

These are related to the steep topography, often little vegetation cover and intense convective rainfall. The peaks of such flash floods have often a 50 to 100 times larger discharge than the preceding [[baseflow]]. These flash floods mostly occur during the evening or night, because the convective rain showers occur in the afternoon.<ref name=\"chapriver\"/>\n\n[[File:Rubaksa at Dabba Hadera.jpg|thumb|Middle course of the river]]\n===Changes over time===\nEvidence given by [[Aerial_reconnaissance_in_World_War_II#Italian_reconnaissance_over_Ethiopia | Italian aerial photographs of the catchment, taken in the 1930s]] show that 55% of the catchment was covered with woody vegetation (against 35% in 2014).<ref>[https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8543686 Etefa Guyassa, 2017.

Bengali has developed over the course of roughly 1,300 years. The earliest extant work in Bengali literature is the ''[[Charyapada]]'', a collection of [[Buddhist]] mystic songs dating back to the 10th and 11th centuries, and considered to be written in an ancestor language of Bengali, [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Odia language|Odia]] and many other languages belonging to the Eastern branch of the [[Indo-Aryan languages]]. The timeline of Bengali literature is divided into three periods \u2212 ancient (650-1200), medieval (1200-1800) and modern (after 1800). Medieval Bengali literature consists of various poetic genres, including Hindu religious scriptures (e.g. [[Mangalkavya]]), Islamic epics (e.g. works of [[Syed Sultan]] and [[Abdul Hakim (poet)|Abdul Hakim]]), [[Vaishnava]] texts (e.g. biographies of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]]), translations of [[Arabic]], [[Farsi|Persian]] and [[Sanskrit]] texts, and secular texts by Muslim poets (e.g. works of [[Alaol]]). Novels were introduced in the mid-19th century. Other than the [[Eastern Nagari script]], Bengali has been written with different scripts such as the [[Perso-Arabic]] and [[Sylheti Nagri]] in certain parts of history.<ref>{{cite Banglapedia|article=Bangla Language|author=Mohammad Daniul Huq & Pabitra Sarkar}}</ref> [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Laureate]] [[Rabindranath Tagore]] was the best known figure of Bengali literature to the world.

Prominent genres which developed are [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavite]] and Mangala writings amongst the [[Bengali Hindus]], romantic and narrative epics amongst the [[Bengali Muslims]], and translations of [[Arabic]], [[Farsi|Persian]] and [[Sanskrit]] works amongst both dominant religious groups.  The [[Sultans of Bengal]] nurtured and patronised literature in the Bengali language, promoting harmony and a sense of egalitarianism in the country.\n\nMuslim writers were exploring different themes through narratives and epics such as religion, culture, cosmology, love and history; often taking inspiration from or translating Arabic and Persian literary works such as the [[Thousand and One Nights]] and the [[Shahnameh]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blogs.edgehill.ac.uk/sacs/files/2012/07/Document-6-Billah-A.-M.-M.-A-The-Development-of-Bengali-Literature-during-Muslim-Rule.pdf |title=The development of Bengali literature during Muslim rule |accessdate=2017-09-22 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809050525/https://blogs.edgehill.ac.uk/sacs/files/2012/07/Document-6-Billah-A.-M.-M.-A-The-Development-of-Bengali-Literature-during-Muslim-Rule.pdf |archivedate=9 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The literary romantic tradition saw poems by [[Shah Muhammad Sagir]] on [[Yusuf and Zulaikha]], as well as works of Sabirid Khan.

Padavalis and Mangala literature continued being produced although they were criticised for lacking meaning and focusing on rhythm instead.<ref name=bpedia/> Prominent writers included [[Bharatchandra Ray]] and [[Ramprasad Sen]]. [[Dinesh Chandra Sen]] and [[Chandra Kumar De]] were celebrated for their research on folklore, in particular the [[Mymensingh Gitika]] which was translated into English as the ''Eastern Bengal Ballads''. \n\n==Modern (1800-present)==\n[[File:Kaykobad 1932.jpg|thumb|[[Kaykobad]] was a popular narrative poet.]]\n[[File:Hason Raja.jpg|thumb|[[Hason Raja]]'s poetry continues to be prominent in rural Bengal.]]\nIn the middle of 19th century, Bengali literature gained momentum. During this period, the Bengali ''Pandits'' of [[Fort William College]] did the tedious work of translating the text books in Bengali to help teach the British some Indian languages including Bengali. This work played a role in the background in the evolution of Bengali prose. In 1814, [[Ram Mohan Roy|Raja Ram Mohan Roy]] arrived in Calcutta and engaged in literary pursuits. Translating from Sanskrit to Bengali, writing essays on religious topics and publishing magazines were some the areas he focussed on. He established a cultural group in the name of '[[Atmiya Sabha]]' (Club of Kins) in 1815. Another significant contributor of Bengali literature in its early stage was [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar|Ishwar Chandra Bandyopadhyaya]].\n\nDuring and following the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]], the literature of Bengal dramatically changed. In the light of the [[Indigo revolt]] in 1859, [[Nil Darpan]] (The Indigo Mirror) was published in [[Dhaka]] by [[Dinabandhu Mitra]], and it played an important role in the development of Bengali theatre.\n\n[[Michael Madhusudan Datta]]'s first epic ''Tilottama Sambhab Kabya'' published in 1860 was the first Bengali poem written in [[blank verse]]. [[Bankim Chandra Chatterjee]] was considered one of the leading Bengali novelists and essayists of the 19th century. He also wrote ''[[Vande Mataram]]'', the national song of India, which appears in his novel ''[[Anandamath]]'' (1882).<ref name = sukumarsenengbankim/>  In the 1880s, Chatterjee critically analysed Hindu scriptures such as the  ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' as well as the problems of [[Krishnaism]] from a historical perspective in his ''Dharmatattva'' and ''Krishna Charitra''.<ref name = sukumarsenengbankim/>\n\nBengali literature has also produced many other notable talents. For example, famous and popular Bengali poets include [[Ishwar Chandra Gupta]], Biharilal Chakraborty and [[Kaykobad]]{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}. [[Romesh Chunder Dutt]] and [[Mir Mosharraf Hossain]] are notable for their works of fiction. [[Girish Chandra Ghosh]] and [[Dwijendralal Ray]] were prominent playwrights of the time, whereas [[Akkhoykumar Boral|Akshay Kumar Boral]] and [[Ramendra Sundar Tribedi]] are famous for their influential essays. [[Rassundari Devi]] authored the first full-fledged [[Autobiographical novel|autobiography]] in modern Bengali literature in 1876.<ref>{{cite web|author=Deepa Bandopadhyay|title=\u09a8\u09be\u09b0\u09c0\u09b0 \u09b2\u09c7\u0996\u09be \u09a8\u09be\u09b0\u09c0\u09b0 \u0995\u09a5\u09be|url=http://www.kaliokalam.com/2012/12/01/%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%80%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%B2%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%96%E0%A6%BE-%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%80%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%A5%E0%A6%BE/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519090732/http://www.kaliokalam.com/2012/12/01/%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%80%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%B2%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%96%E0%A6%BE-%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%80%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%A5%E0%A6%BE/|archivedate=19 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThis era also saw a rise in new literary publications, magazines and newspapers. A number of educational institutes also appeared all over the region. Both these developments helped to nurture and advance the modern Bengali literary movement.\n\nThe Pre-Tagore era also saw an undercurrent of popular literature which was focused on daily life in contemporary Bengal. The prose style, as well as the humour in these works, were often crass, blunt and accessible. A masterpiece in this regard was \"Hutom Pechar Naksha\" (The Sketch of the Owl) written by [[Kaliprasanna Singha]], and satirically depicts \"Babu\" culture in 19th century Kolkata. Other notable works in this regard are \"Alaler Ghorer Dulal\" (The Spoilt Brat) by [[Peary Chand Mitra]], \"[[Ramtanu Lahiri]] o tatkalin Banga shamaj\" (Ramtanu Lahiri & contemporary Bengali society) by Nyaymohan Tarkalankar, and \"Naba Babu Bilas\" & \"Naba Bibi Bilas\" by Bhabanicharan Bandopadhyay. These books arguably portrayed contemporary Bengali dialect and popular society effectively, and also incorporated now-extinct music genres such as Khisti, Kheur and Kabiyal gaan by stalwarts like Rupchand Pakhi and Bhola Moyra. Books like these have become rarer since the emergence of Tagore culture, and the burgeoning preference for literary elegance and refinement in Bengali society.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sarai.net/publications/readers/02-the-cities-of-everyday-life/13calcutta.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=16 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705092243/http://www.sarai.net/publications/readers/02-the-cities-of-everyday-life/13calcutta.pdf |archivedate=5 July 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n==Nazrul and Tagore==\n[[File:Rabindranath Tagore unknown location.jpg|left|thumb|[[Rabindranath Tagore]], Asia's first [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureate]]\n[[File:Kazi Nazrul Islam, circa 1940.jpg|thumb|Through [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]]'s contributions, Bengali [[ghazal]]s were enriched profusely.]]\n\n[[Rabindranath Tagore]] and [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]] are the most well-known prolific writers of Bengal in this century.

His 2,000 [[Rabindra Sangeet]]s play a pivotal part in defining Bengali culture, both in West Bengal and Bangladesh. Other notable Bengali works of his are ''[[Gitanjali]]'', a book of poems for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1913, and many short stories and a few novels.\n\nIn the similar category is [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]], who was invited to post-partition Bangladesh as the [[National Poet]] (he had been suffering from dementia and aphasia since 1942) and whose work transcends sectarian boundaries. Adored by Bengalis both in Bangladesh and West Bengal, his work includes 3,000 [[Nazrul Geeti]]s. He is frequently called the \"Rebel Poet\" mainly because of his most famous and electrifying poem \"[[Bidrohi]]\" or \"The Rebel\", and also because of his strong sympathy and support for revolutionary activities leading to India's independence from British rule. His songs and poems were frequently used during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] as well. Though he is acknowledged as the rebel poet, Nazrul very effectively contributed in all branches of literature. He wrote poems that light the fire against inequality or injustice and at the same time is known for his poignant romantic poems as well. He was sent to jail for his literary works against the then prevailing British rule.\n\n==Other notable names==\n{{Islamic culture}}\n===Playwrights===\n[[Nurul Momen]] is recognized as the pioneer of modern Bengali drama, \"acting as a bridge between earlier and later playwrights in terms of content and style\", and even referred to as the \"Father of Bangladeshi theatre\".\n\n===Novelists===\n[[Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay]] was one of the most popular novelists of early 20th century whose speciality was exploring the life and suffering of women in contemporary rural Bengal. His sympathy towards the common rural folks in \"pallisamaj\" and a trademark simplified Bengali as a writing style made him one of the most popular writers in his time. Even long after his death many [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali]] and [[Bollywood]] blockbusters were based on his novels. After him [[Tarashankar Bandopadhyay]], [[Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay]] and [[Manik Bandopadhyay]] were the three Bandopadhyays who broke out into a new era of realistic writing style. Where Bibhutibhusan and Manik had long standing influence on the two of the most brilliant film directors from Bengal, [[Satyajit Ray]] and [[Ritwik Ghatak]] respectively.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}  Other famous Bengali novelists include [[Humayun Ahmed]], [[Humayun Azad]], [[Jagadish Gupta]], [[Satinath Bhaduri]], [[Balai Chand Mukhopadhyay]] (Banophool), [[Shawkat Osman]], [[Saradindu Bandopadhyay]], [[Kamal Kumar Majumdar]], [[Sunil Gangopadhyay]], [[Syed Shamsul Haque]], [[Akhteruzzaman Elias]], [[Sandipan Chattopadhyay]], [[Bimal Mitra]], [[Bimal Kar]], [[Samaresh Basu]], [[Mani Shankar Mukherjee]] (Shankar), [[Shyamal Gangapadhyay]] and [[Amar Mitra (writer)|Amar Mitra]]. Seeds of [[Bengali science fiction]] are evident in the writings of [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]], which was later put into a definite genre by writers such as [[Jagadananda Roy]], [[Roquia Sakhawat Hussain|Begum Roquia Sakhawat Hussain]], and [[Premendra Mitra]], [[Satyajit Ray]]. [[Muhammed Zafar Iqbal]] and [[Abdullah-Al-Muti]] are also very popular in this genre.\n\n===Short story writers===\n{{famous|date=April 2013}}\nBengali literature is also famous for short stories. Some famous short story writers are [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Manik Bandopadhyay]], [[Jagadish Gupta]], [[Tarashankar Bandopadhyay]], [[Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay]], [[Rajshekhar Basu]] (Parasuram), [[Syed Mujtaba Ali]], [[Premendra Mitra]], [[Kamal Kumar Majumdar]], [[Shibram Chakrabarti]], [[Saradindu Bandopadhyay]], [[Subodh Ghosh]], [[Narendranath Mitra]], [[Narayan Gangopadhyay]], [[Satyajit Ray]], [[Leela Majumdar]], [[Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay]], [[Ratan Lal Basu]], [[Sandipan Chattopadhyay]], [[Samir Roychoudhury]], [[Subimal Basak]], [[Basudeb Dasgupta]],[[Subimal Mishra]], [[Syed Waliullah]], [[Amar Mitra (writer)|Amar Mitra]], [[Shawkat Osman]], [[Akhtaruzzaman Ilias]], [[Hasan Azizul Huq]], [[Shahidul Zahir]], [[Jyotirindranath Nandi]], [[Humayun Ahmed]], [[Rashid Askari]].\n\n===Poets===\n[[File:A poetry seminar nandan kolkata sujit sarkar.jpg|left|thumb|Poetry seminars at [[Nandan (Kolkata)|Nandan]]]]\n[[Rajanikanta Sen]], [[Atulprasad Sen]], [[Dwijendralal Ray]], [[Jatindramohan Bagchi]], [[Kumud Ranjan Mullick]], [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]], [[Jibanananda Das]], along with [[Buddhadeva Bose]], marks the beginning of the major move to transcend the Tagore legacy . Commonly called \"polli-kobi\" (''pastoral poet'') [[Jasimuddin]], [[Shamsur Rahman (poet)|Shamsur Rahman]], widely known for his 'playing with words' are also notable.  Others are [[Al Mahmud]], [[Abul Hasan (poet)|Abul Hasan]] and [[Abdul Mannan Syed]].\n\n==Musicians==\nSeminal Hindu religious works in Bengali include the many songs of [[Ramprasad Sen]]. His works (still sung today) from the 17th century cover an astonishing range of emotional responses to the goddess [[Kali]], detailing complex philosophical statements based on [[Vedanta]] teachings and more visceral pronouncements of his love of the goddess. They are known as ''[[Shyama Sangeet]]'' and were the literary inspiration for Kazi Nazrul Islam's later, famed [[Shyama Sangeet]]. There are also the laudatory accounts of the lives and teachings of the [[Vaishnava]] saint [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] (the ''Choitanyo Chorit\u0101mrit'') and Shri [[Ramakrishna]] (the ''Ramakrishna Kathamrita'', translated roughly as Gospel of Ramakrishna). There is also a large body of Islamic literature, that can be traced back at least to ''Noornama'' by [[Abdul Hakim (poet)|Abdul Hakim]]. ''Bishad Sindhu'' depicting the death of Hussain in [[Karbala]] is very popular novel written by [[Mir Mosharraf Hossain]]. Later works influenced by Islam include devotional songs written by Nazrul, and popularized by [[Abbas Uddin]], among others.\n\n==Bauls and traditional singers==\n[[File:394 baul-singers-sml.jpg|thumb|left|Baul singers at Vasantotsav, [[Shantiniketan]].]]\nThe mystic [[Baul]]s of the Bengal countryside who preached the boundless spiritual truth of ''S\u00f4hoj P\u00f4th'' (the Simple, Natural Path) and ''Moner M\u0101nush'' (A person of The Heart) drew on Vedantic philosophy to propound transcendental truths in song format, traveling from village to village proclaiming that there was no such thing as Hindu, Muslim or Christian, only ''moner m\u0101nush.''\n\nThe literature discussed so far can be more or less regarded as the common heritage of both Bangladesh and West Bengal. Since the partition of Bengal in 1947, the east and west parts of Bengal have also developed their own distinctive literatures. For example, the [[Naxalite]] movement has influenced much of West Bengal's literature, whereas the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Liberation War]] has had a similarly profound impact on Bangladeshi literature.\n\n==Major literary figures in (East Bengal) Bangladesh==\n[[File:Shaheed Minar.JPG|thumb|[[Shaheed Minar, Dhaka]] as displayed on the annual anniversary of [[Bengali Language Movement]].]]\n[[Nurul Momen]], [[Syed Waliullah]], [[Shahidullah Kaisar]], [[Shawkat Osman]], [[Ahsan Habib]], [[Farrukh Ahmed]], [[Syed Ali Ahsan]], [[Syed Shamsul Haque]], [[Abu Zafar Obaidullah]], [[Sufia Kamal]], [[Al Mahmud]], [[Abubakar Siddique]], [[Ghulam Murshid]], [[Hasan Azizul Huq]],   [[Selina Hossain]], [[Arunabh Sarkar]], [[Shawkat Ali]], [[Akhtaruzzaman Ilias]], [[Rafiq Azad]], [[Nirmalendu Goon]], [[Taslima Nasrin]], [[Abul Hasan (1947-1975)|Abul Hasan]], [[Abid Azad]], [[Humayun Azad]], [[Humayun Ahmed]], [[Muhammed Zafar Iqbal]], [[Hasan Hafizur Rahman]], [[Shaheed Quaderi]], [[Khondakar Ashraf Hossain]], and [[Helal Hafiz]] to name a few.\n\n==West Bengal literature==\n[[File:Bhasha Smritistambha Arnab Dutta 2011.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bhasha Smritistambha]], [[Kolkata]].]]\n[[Nihar Ranjan Gupta]], [[Ashutosh Mukhopadhyay]], [[Kamal Kumar Majumdar]], [[Sunil Gangopadhyay]], [[Nabaneeta Dev Sen]], [[Syed Mustafa Siraj]], [[Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay]], [[Samaresh Basu]], [[Atin Bandyopadhyay]], [[Sandipan Chattopadhyay]], [[Shakti Chattopadhyay]], [[Mahasweta Devi]], [[Moti Nandi]], [[Bimal Kar]], [[Narayan Gangopadhyay]], [[Mani Shankar Mukherjee|Shankar]], [[Suchitra Bhattacharya]], [[Bani Basu]], [[Buddhadeb Guha]], [[Abdul Jabbar]], [[Amar Mitra (writer)|Amar Mitra]], [[Satyajit Ray]] and others.\n\n===1947-1965===\n{{Bengalis}}\n[[Rajshekhar Basu]] (1880\u20131960) was the best-known writer of satiric short story in Bengali literature.<ref name =parashuram>{{cite book |editor1-first=Sisir Kumar |editor1-last= Das |title= Samsad Bangla Sahityasangi|trans-title= Samsad Companion to Bengali Literature |edition=1st |year= 2003 |publisher= Sahitya Samsad |location= Kolkata |language=bn |isbn=81-7955-007-9 |page= 189}}</ref> He mocked the charlatanism and vileness of various classes of the Bengali society in his stories written under the pseudonym \"Parashuram\".<ref name =parashuram/> His major works include: ''Gaddalika'' (1924), ''Kajjwali'' (1927), ''Hanumaner Swapna'' (1937), ''Gamanush Jatir Katha'' (1945), ''Dhusturimaya Ityadi Galpa'' (1952), ''Krishnakali Ittadi Galpa'' (1953), ''Niltara Ittadi Galpa'' (1956), ''Anandibai Ittadi Galpa'' (1958) and ''Chamatkumari Ittadi Galpa'' (1959).

Bengali has developed over the course of roughly 1,300 years. The earliest extant work in Bengali literature is the ''[[Charyapada]]'', a collection of [[Buddhist]] mystic songs dating back to the 10th and 11th centuries, and considered to be written in an ancestor language of Bengali, [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Odia language|Odia]] and many other languages belonging to the Eastern branch of the [[Indo-Aryan languages]]. The timeline of Bengali literature is divided into three periods \u2212 ancient (650-1200), medieval (1200-1800) and modern (after 1800). Medieval Bengali literature consists of various poetic genres, including Hindu religious scriptures (e.g. [[Mangalkavya]]), Islamic epics (e.g. works of [[Syed Sultan]] and [[Abdul Hakim (poet)|Abdul Hakim]]), [[Vaishnava]] texts (e.g. biographies of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]]), translations of [[Arabic]], [[Farsi|Persian]] and [[Sanskrit]] texts, and secular texts by Muslim poets (e.g. works of [[Alaol]]). Novels were introduced in the mid-19th century. Other than the [[Eastern Nagari script]], Bengali has been written with different scripts such as the [[Perso-Arabic]] and [[Sylheti Nagri]] in certain parts of history.<ref>{{cite Banglapedia|article=Bangla Language|author=Mohammad Daniul Huq & Pabitra Sarkar}}</ref> [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Laureate]] [[Rabindranath Tagore]] was the best known figure of Bengali literature to the world.

Major figures of this period are [[Krishnadasa Kaviraja]], [[Vrindavana Dasa Thakura]], Jayananda, [[Govindadasa]], Jnandada and Balaram Dasa amongst others. ''[[Mangal-K\u0101vya]]'', a group of [[Hindu]] narrative poetry, eulogise the indigenous deities of rural [[Bengal]] in the social scenario. ''Mansa Mangal'', ''Chandi Mangal'' and ''Dhormo Mangal'', the three major genus of ''Mangal-K\u0101vya'' tradition include the portrayal of the magnitude of [[Manasa|Manas\u0101]], [[Chandi|Chand\u012b]] and [[Dharmathakur]], who are considered the greatest among all the native Hindu divinities in Bengal.

Padavalis and Mangala literature continued being produced although they were criticised for lacking meaning and focusing on rhythm instead.<ref name=bpedia/> Prominent writers included [[Bharatchandra Ray]] and [[Ramprasad Sen]]. [[Dinesh Chandra Sen]] and [[Chandra Kumar De]] were celebrated for their research on folklore, in particular the [[Mymensingh Gitika]] which was translated into English as the ''Eastern Bengal Ballads''. \n\n==Modern (1800-present)==\n[[File:Kaykobad 1932.jpg|thumb|[[Kaykobad]] was a popular narrative poet.]]\n[[File:Hason Raja.jpg|thumb|[[Hason Raja]]'s poetry continues to be prominent in rural Bengal.]]\nIn the middle of 19th century, Bengali literature gained momentum. During this period, the Bengali ''Pandits'' of [[Fort William College]] did the tedious work of translating the text books in Bengali to help teach the British some Indian languages including Bengali. This work played a role in the background in the evolution of Bengali prose. In 1814, [[Ram Mohan Roy|Raja Ram Mohan Roy]] arrived in Calcutta and engaged in literary pursuits. Translating from Sanskrit to Bengali, writing essays on religious topics and publishing magazines were some the areas he focussed on. He established a cultural group in the name of '[[Atmiya Sabha]]' (Club of Kins) in 1815. Another significant contributor of Bengali literature in its early stage was [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar|Ishwar Chandra Bandyopadhyaya]].\n\nDuring and following the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]], the literature of Bengal dramatically changed. In the light of the [[Indigo revolt]] in 1859, [[Nil Darpan]] (The Indigo Mirror) was published in [[Dhaka]] by [[Dinabandhu Mitra]], and it played an important role in the development of Bengali theatre.\n\n[[Michael Madhusudan Datta]]'s first epic ''Tilottama Sambhab Kabya'' published in 1860 was the first Bengali poem written in [[blank verse]]. [[Bankim Chandra Chatterjee]] was considered one of the leading Bengali novelists and essayists of the 19th century. He also wrote ''[[Vande Mataram]]'', the national song of India, which appears in his novel ''[[Anandamath]]'' (1882).<ref name = sukumarsenengbankim/>  In the 1880s, Chatterjee critically analysed Hindu scriptures such as the  ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' as well as the problems of [[Krishnaism]] from a historical perspective in his ''Dharmatattva'' and ''Krishna Charitra''.<ref name = sukumarsenengbankim/>\n\nBengali literature has also produced many other notable talents. For example, famous and popular Bengali poets include [[Ishwar Chandra Gupta]], Biharilal Chakraborty and [[Kaykobad]]{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}. [[Romesh Chunder Dutt]] and [[Mir Mosharraf Hossain]] are notable for their works of fiction. [[Girish Chandra Ghosh]] and [[Dwijendralal Ray]] were prominent playwrights of the time, whereas [[Akkhoykumar Boral|Akshay Kumar Boral]] and [[Ramendra Sundar Tribedi]] are famous for their influential essays. [[Rassundari Devi]] authored the first full-fledged [[Autobiographical novel|autobiography]] in modern Bengali literature in 1876.<ref>{{cite web|author=Deepa Bandopadhyay|title=\u09a8\u09be\u09b0\u09c0\u09b0 \u09b2\u09c7\u0996\u09be \u09a8\u09be\u09b0\u09c0\u09b0 \u0995\u09a5\u09be|url=http://www.kaliokalam.com/2012/12/01/%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%80%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%B2%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%96%E0%A6%BE-%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%80%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%A5%E0%A6%BE/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519090732/http://www.kaliokalam.com/2012/12/01/%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%80%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%B2%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%96%E0%A6%BE-%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%80%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%A5%E0%A6%BE/|archivedate=19 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThis era also saw a rise in new literary publications, magazines and newspapers. A number of educational institutes also appeared all over the region. Both these developments helped to nurture and advance the modern Bengali literary movement.\n\nThe Pre-Tagore era also saw an undercurrent of popular literature which was focused on daily life in contemporary Bengal. The prose style, as well as the humour in these works, were often crass, blunt and accessible. A masterpiece in this regard was \"Hutom Pechar Naksha\" (The Sketch of the Owl) written by [[Kaliprasanna Singha]], and satirically depicts \"Babu\" culture in 19th century Kolkata. Other notable works in this regard are \"Alaler Ghorer Dulal\" (The Spoilt Brat) by [[Peary Chand Mitra]], \"[[Ramtanu Lahiri]] o tatkalin Banga shamaj\" (Ramtanu Lahiri & contemporary Bengali society) by Nyaymohan Tarkalankar, and \"Naba Babu Bilas\" & \"Naba Bibi Bilas\" by Bhabanicharan Bandopadhyay. These books arguably portrayed contemporary Bengali dialect and popular society effectively, and also incorporated now-extinct music genres such as Khisti, Kheur and Kabiyal gaan by stalwarts like Rupchand Pakhi and Bhola Moyra. Books like these have become rarer since the emergence of Tagore culture, and the burgeoning preference for literary elegance and refinement in Bengali society.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sarai.net/publications/readers/02-the-cities-of-everyday-life/13calcutta.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=16 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705092243/http://www.sarai.net/publications/readers/02-the-cities-of-everyday-life/13calcutta.pdf |archivedate=5 July 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n==Nazrul and Tagore==\n[[File:Rabindranath Tagore unknown location.jpg|left|thumb|[[Rabindranath Tagore]], Asia's first [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureate]]\n[[File:Kazi Nazrul Islam, circa 1940.jpg|thumb|Through [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]]'s contributions, Bengali [[ghazal]]s were enriched profusely.]]\n\n[[Rabindranath Tagore]] and [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]] are the most well-known prolific writers of Bengal in this century.

His 2,000 [[Rabindra Sangeet]]s play a pivotal part in defining Bengali culture, both in West Bengal and Bangladesh. Other notable Bengali works of his are ''[[Gitanjali]]'', a book of poems for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1913, and many short stories and a few novels.\n\nIn the similar category is [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]], who was invited to post-partition Bangladesh as the [[National Poet]] (he had been suffering from dementia and aphasia since 1942) and whose work transcends sectarian boundaries. Adored by Bengalis both in Bangladesh and West Bengal, his work includes 3,000 [[Nazrul Geeti]]s. He is frequently called the \"Rebel Poet\" mainly because of his most famous and electrifying poem \"[[Bidrohi]]\" or \"The Rebel\", and also because of his strong sympathy and support for revolutionary activities leading to India's independence from British rule. His songs and poems were frequently used during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] as well. Though he is acknowledged as the rebel poet, Nazrul very effectively contributed in all branches of literature. He wrote poems that light the fire against inequality or injustice and at the same time is known for his poignant romantic poems as well. He was sent to jail for his literary works against the then prevailing British rule.\n\n==Other notable names==\n{{Islamic culture}}\n===Playwrights===\n[[Nurul Momen]] is recognized as the pioneer of modern Bengali drama, \"acting as a bridge between earlier and later playwrights in terms of content and style\", and even referred to as the \"Father of Bangladeshi theatre\".\n\n===Novelists===\n[[Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay]] was one of the most popular novelists of early 20th century whose speciality was exploring the life and suffering of women in contemporary rural Bengal. His sympathy towards the common rural folks in \"pallisamaj\" and a trademark simplified Bengali as a writing style made him one of the most popular writers in his time. Even long after his death many [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali]] and [[Bollywood]] blockbusters were based on his novels. After him [[Tarashankar Bandopadhyay]], [[Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay]] and [[Manik Bandopadhyay]] were the three Bandopadhyays who broke out into a new era of realistic writing style. Where Bibhutibhusan and Manik had long standing influence on the two of the most brilliant film directors from Bengal, [[Satyajit Ray]] and [[Ritwik Ghatak]] respectively.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}  Other famous Bengali novelists include [[Humayun Ahmed]], [[Humayun Azad]], [[Jagadish Gupta]], [[Satinath Bhaduri]], [[Balai Chand Mukhopadhyay]] (Banophool), [[Shawkat Osman]], [[Saradindu Bandopadhyay]], [[Kamal Kumar Majumdar]], [[Sunil Gangopadhyay]], [[Syed Shamsul Haque]], [[Akhteruzzaman Elias]], [[Sandipan Chattopadhyay]], [[Bimal Mitra]], [[Bimal Kar]], [[Samaresh Basu]], [[Mani Shankar Mukherjee]] (Shankar), [[Shyamal Gangapadhyay]] and [[Amar Mitra (writer)|Amar Mitra]]. Seeds of [[Bengali science fiction]] are evident in the writings of [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]], which was later put into a definite genre by writers such as [[Jagadananda Roy]], [[Roquia Sakhawat Hussain|Begum Roquia Sakhawat Hussain]], and [[Premendra Mitra]], [[Satyajit Ray]]. [[Muhammed Zafar Iqbal]] and [[Abdullah-Al-Muti]] are also very popular in this genre.\n\n===Short story writers===\n{{famous|date=April 2013}}\nBengali literature is also famous for short stories. Some famous short story writers are [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Manik Bandopadhyay]], [[Jagadish Gupta]], [[Tarashankar Bandopadhyay]], [[Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay]], [[Rajshekhar Basu]] (Parasuram), [[Syed Mujtaba Ali]], [[Premendra Mitra]], [[Kamal Kumar Majumdar]], [[Shibram Chakrabarti]], [[Saradindu Bandopadhyay]], [[Subodh Ghosh]], [[Narendranath Mitra]], [[Narayan Gangopadhyay]], [[Satyajit Ray]], [[Leela Majumdar]], [[Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay]], [[Ratan Lal Basu]], [[Sandipan Chattopadhyay]], [[Samir Roychoudhury]], [[Subimal Basak]], [[Basudeb Dasgupta]],[[Subimal Mishra]], [[Syed Waliullah]], [[Amar Mitra (writer)|Amar Mitra]], [[Shawkat Osman]], [[Akhtaruzzaman Ilias]], [[Hasan Azizul Huq]], [[Shahidul Zahir]], [[Jyotirindranath Nandi]], [[Humayun Ahmed]]etc.\n\n===Poets===\n[[File:A poetry seminar nandan kolkata sujit sarkar.jpg|left|thumb|Poetry seminars at [[Nandan (Kolkata)|Nandan]]]]\n[[Rajanikanta Sen]], [[Atulprasad Sen]], [[Dwijendralal Ray]], [[Jatindramohan Bagchi]], [[Kumud Ranjan Mullick]], [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]], [[Jibanananda Das]], along with [[Buddhadeva Bose]], marks the beginning of the major move to transcend the Tagore legacy . Commonly called \"polli-kobi\" (''pastoral poet'') [[Jasimuddin]], [[Shamsur Rahman (poet)|Shamsur Rahman]], widely known for his 'playing with words' are also notable.  Others are [[Al Mahmud]], [[Abul Hasan (poet)|Abul Hasan]] and [[Abdul Mannan Syed]].\n\n==Musicians==\nSeminal Hindu religious works in Bengali include the many songs of [[Ramprasad Sen]]. His works (still sung today) from the 17th century cover an astonishing range of emotional responses to the goddess [[Kali]], detailing complex philosophical statements based on [[Vedanta]] teachings and more visceral pronouncements of his love of the goddess. They are known as ''[[Shyama Sangeet]]'' and were the literary inspiration for Kazi Nazrul Islam's later, famed [[Shyama Sangeet]]. There are also the laudatory accounts of the lives and teachings of the [[Vaishnava]] saint [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] (the ''Choitanyo Chorit\u0101mrit'') and Shri [[Ramakrishna]] (the ''Ramakrishna Kathamrita'', translated roughly as Gospel of Ramakrishna). There is also a large body of Islamic literature, that can be traced back at least to ''Noornama'' by [[Abdul Hakim (poet)|Abdul Hakim]]. ''Bishad Sindhu'' depicting the death of Hussain in [[Karbala]] is very popular novel written by [[Mir Mosharraf Hossain]]. Later works influenced by Islam include devotional songs written by Nazrul, and popularized by [[Abbas Uddin]], among others.\n\n==Bauls and traditional singers==\n[[File:394 baul-singers-sml.jpg|thumb|left|Baul singers at Vasantotsav, [[Shantiniketan]].]]\nThe mystic [[Baul]]s of the Bengal countryside who preached the boundless spiritual truth of ''S\u00f4hoj P\u00f4th'' (the Simple, Natural Path) and ''Moner M\u0101nush'' (A person of The Heart) drew on Vedantic philosophy to propound transcendental truths in song format, traveling from village to village proclaiming that there was no such thing as Hindu, Muslim or Christian, only ''moner m\u0101nush.''\n\nThe literature discussed so far can be more or less regarded as the common heritage of both Bangladesh and West Bengal. Since the partition of Bengal in 1947, the east and west parts of Bengal have also developed their own distinctive literatures.
