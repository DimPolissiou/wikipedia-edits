Wood had purchased the {{convert|254|acre|ha}} comprising Del Ray for $38,900, while the {{convert|39|acre|ha}} of St. Elmo were purchased for $15,314. Del Ray originally contained six east\u2013west streets and five north\u2013south. All were identical in width, except Mt. Vernon Avenue, which was approximately twenty feet wider. St. Elmo's, a smaller tract, was laid out in a similar pattern, but with only four east\u2013west streets and one running north\u2013south. Between the two neighborhoods was the [[St. Asaph Racetrack]], a once-controversial [[gambling]] establishment that shut down after a 1904 raid; the location of the racetrack caused some deviation from a pure-grid street pattern, which remains to this day.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.connectionnewspapers.com/news/2012/aug/23/hidden-history-st-asaph-racetrack/|title=Hidden History of St. Asaph Racetrack|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBy 1900, Del Ray contained approximately 130 people, and St. Elmo's 55.

The section of [[Virginia State Route 236|Duke Street]] in the West End is known for a high-density residential area known to locals as \"Landmark\" due to its close proximity to nearby [[Landmark Mall]], and for its concentration of strip and enclosed [[shopping mall]]s.

Wood had purchased the {{convert|254|acre|ha}} comprising Del Ray for $38,900, while the {{convert|39|acre|ha}} of St. Elmo were purchased for $15,314. Del Ray originally contained six east\u2013west streets and five north\u2013south. All were identical in width, except Mt. Vernon Avenue, which was approximately twenty feet wider. St. Elmo's, a smaller tract, was laid out in a similar pattern, but with only four east\u2013west streets and one running north\u2013south. Between the two neighborhoods was the [[St. Asaph Racetrack]], a once-controversial [[gambling]] establishment that shut down after a 1904 raid; the location of the racetrack caused some deviation from a pure-grid street pattern, which remains to this day.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.connectionnewspapers.com/news/2012/aug/23/hidden-history-st-asaph-racetrack/|title=Hidden History of St. Asaph Racetrack|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBy 1900, Del Ray contained approximately 130 people, and St. Elmo's 55.

It is the most typically suburban part of Alexandria, with a [[street hierarchy]] of winding roads and [[cul-de-sac]]s. The section of [[Virginia State Route 236|Duke Street]] in the West End is known for a high-density residential area known to locals as \"Landmark\" due to its close proximity to nearby [[Landmark Mall]], and for its concentration of strip and enclosed [[shopping mall]]s. Parts of Alexandria's West End have received an influx of immigrants from [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]], who have settled in the areas surrounding Seminary Road west of [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia\u2013Virginia)|I-395]].\n\nThe main areas of the West End all are west of Quaker Lane, a major north\u2013south artery through the western side of Alexandria.\n\n===Seminary Hill===\nSeminary Hill is a mostly residential, single-family dwelling area near the [[Virginia Theological Seminary]], [[Episcopal High School (Alexandria, Virginia)|Episcopal High School]] and [[St. Stephen's & St. Agnes School]] off of Seminary Road, ending in the area just west of the [[Inova Health System|Inova Alexandria Hospital]].\n\n[[T.C.

There are also areas of industrial businesses south of Duke Street, primarily off Wheeler Ave., South Pickett St., and South Van Dorn St. In the very southern part of this area is the Eisenhower Ave. corridor running parallel to the Capital Beltway (I-95/I-495) and west of Telegraph Rd, which is primarily industrial and commercial in nature. There has been development in apartments and townhouses in the area west of Telegraph Rd and east of Clermont Ave along with Class 1 Offices and national brand hotels.
