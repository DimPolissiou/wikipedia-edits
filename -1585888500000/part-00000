When Amy was fifteen years old, she was seriously injured in a car accident that killed her mother, Marion, while she was attempting to save Spartan, an abused horse. Amy is unable to attend her mother's funeral while recuperating at the hospital, but her estranged father Tim returns to attend Marion's funeral. When Amy returns home, she decides to continue her mother's work of healing abused or damaged horses, including Spartan. However, she must readjust not only to her father re-entering her life, but also the return of her older sister Lou, who has been living in [[New York City]]. Over time, Amy develops a close relationship with Ty Borden, a young man invited by Marion before her death to work as a ranch hand at Heartland as part of his probation. Ty begins to assist Amy in healing the horses and their friendship gradually turns to love. Though their relationship is rocky and they break up more than once, they manage to make amends and Ty gives Amy a promise ring in season 3. In the last episode of season 5, Ty secretly makes plans to propose to Amy, but after hearing her say how they should never \"tie themselves down\", he decides against it, not realizing Amy would later find the ring in his pocket. After they discuss the ring and marriage, Ty later finds the perfect moment to propose to Amy, and she accepts. The change in their relationship results in them breaking up briefly, getting back together when they rescue a herd of horses penned by ranchers who believed the horses to be detrimental to the land required for their cattle. Amy and Ty eventually marry in Jack's house, with Amy escorted by both Tim and Jack, and she rides in on Spartan. After getting married, she and Ty reside in the renovated loft at Jack's house. At the end of season 9, Amy reveals she is pregnant, though she goes through her pregnancy without Ty by her side, as he is away in Mongolia to save Gobi bears, a decision in which Amy supported Ty. They regularly communicate through Skype, though she misses having him nearby. At the end of Season 10, Amy gives birth at home to a baby girl, Lyndy Marion.\n\n* [[Graham Wardle]] as Tyler \"Ty\" Borden\n\n[[File:Graham Wardle 2013.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Wardle]]\n: When Ty was a child, he was abused by his stepfather Wade, whom he attacked for assaulting Ty's mother.  The incident resulted in Ty's arrest and being sent to [[Juvenile hall]]; to complete his probation, Marion Fleming offered him a job as a ranch hand at Heartland. He soon begins to enjoy his life there and decides to stay after completing his probation, though he leaves for a short period to live with his biological father in [[Calgary]]. Jack treats Ty like a son and is very proud of him, especially after he earns his high school diploma and decides to study to become a vet. Ty at first is known as the \"new cute guy\" by Amy's friends, and Amy quickly falls for him. Ty dated Kit Bailey, a local cowgirl, for a time before he admitted his feelings for Amy. He and Amy have a tumultuous relationship over the subsequent seasons.  In the final episode of Season 5, Ty buys a ring with plans to propose to Amy, but rethinks his proposal after hearing Amy say they should never \"tie themselves down.\"  When Amy discovers the ring, Ty and Amy agree to wait, and Ty is accepted to vet school and begins assisting Scott at his clinic.  While camping, Ty finds the perfect moment to propose to Amy, who accepts, and they later marry.  After Amy tells Ty that he is going to become a father, she supports his decision to go to Mongolia to save the last of the Gobi bears with Veterinarians Without Borders.  Though he is unable to be by Amy's side throughout her pregnancy, they communicate frequently through Skype. Near the end of the season, Ty contracts a potentially life-threatening illness from a tick bite and returns to Calgary in critical condition. He is immediately taken to the hospital, where they help him to slowly recover. At the end of the season, Caleb breaks Ty out of the hospital (where he was being kept while the doctors ran additional tests to ensure he was cured) so that Ty can participate in Caleb's wedding to Cass as the best man. However, Amy goes into labor as they arrive at the church and they rush home for the birth of their daughter.\n\n* [[Michelle Morgan (actress)|Michelle Morgan]] as Samantha Louise \"Lou\" Fleming Morris\n\n[[File:Michelle Morgan 2015.jpg|thumb|left|180x180px|Morgan]]\n:At the beginning of the series, Lou moves back home from her job in [[New York City]] to help run Heartland. She is initially reluctant to stay in Hudson because she has a long-term boyfriend and a lucrative job in New York. Upon discovering Heartland's poor economic situation, she crafts a financial plan with knowledge from her MBA to pull the ranch out of debt and make it successful. However, she is told by a financial adviser at the bank that her presence at the ranch is essential to secure the loan necessary to implement her plan. Once Lou decides to stay, she runs the business end of Heartland, taking care of appointments and setting rates for stabling patient horses. She later sets her mind to starting a new business venture, a corporate retreat center: The Heartland Equestrian Connection. This idea is met with much resistance, especially from Jack. Family members derisively refer to the business as the \"Dude Ranch\", and the name sticks, though no longer with its negative connotation. Along the way, Lou breaks up with her boyfriend from New York and tries to re-kindle a romance with the local vet, Scott Cardinal. In season two, Lou's relationship with Scott dissolves. She meets her future husband, Peter, thanks to a setup by Jack's girlfriend Lisa, and starts a secret relationship with him due to Peter's job in the oil industry. Lou had previously rallied the local ranchers against Peter's oil company, and expects Jack would not approve of her choice of boyfriend. Later, Lou's relationship with Peter is more public and they marry at the end of season 3. They move to [[Dubai]], but she soon feels very alone in such a foreign country and grows to miss Heartland and her family. When they move back home, Lou finds out she is pregnant. She later gives birth to a girl named Catherine Marion Minnie Fleming-Morris (often referred to as Katie). After several failed attempts to buy a place of their own and even to build a home somewhere on the 600 acre property at Heartland, Lou and Peter buy Mr. Hanley's ranch from Mrs. Bell and they plan to move into it and refurbish it. However, faulty wiring in the structure causes a fire, and the buildings and stables burn, leaving them no choice but to remain at Heartland. Lou has a positive relationship with her sister Amy, providing a listening ear and timely advice when she needs it, and Amy often plays the same role for Lou. Lou is also close with her father, Tim, and she is the first one to reconnect with him after Marion's death. In Season 6, Lou and Peter decide to adopt an orphan named Georgina Crawley, whom Jack had been fostering after discovering her hiding in the loft. In season 8, Lou and Peter start having relationship problems since Peter is constantly in Vancouver for his job. On Amy's advice, Lou goes to Vancouver to talk things over with him, but they decide to separate. Peter returns to Hudson to try to persuade Lou that they can work things out, but she is not interested, since nothing has changed. Lou later tries online dating, and seems to be falling for the new stable hand, Mitch. Peter visits regularly for his daughters, and interferes with Lou and Mitch's budding romance whenever he is at Heartland. In season 7, Lou buys Maggie's after Maggie moves to be with her daughter, Soraya, in [[London, England]]. She runs it with Tim, who acts as her supposedly \"silent\" business partner. Lou eventually works on bringing Maggie's to New York City and spends much of her time flying back and forth, with the rest of her family taking care of Georgie and Katie.\n\n* [[Shaun Johnston]] as Jackson \"Jack\" Bartlett\n\n[[File:Shaun Johnston 2015.jpg|thumb|right|180x180px|Shaun Johnston]]\n:The family patriarch, Jack is Amy and Lou's grandfather and was Marion's father. He is a former rodeo star and was once a cattle rancher. When Marion took over, Heartland became a horse ranch. After her death, Jack helps Amy and Ty maintain Heartland and its horses and he is the one who fixes broken equipment, fences, and the like. Early in the series, he was very hostile towards ex-son-in-law Tim. The men have maintained a difficult relationship stemming from Tim's troubled past with alcohol and prescription drug abuse, his acrimonious divorce from Marion, and lack of involvement in Amy and Lou's lives. Jack seems to barely tolerate Tim's presence at times, and they've had numerous arguments over the running of the ranch. Jack was initially very judgmental towards Ty, and he warned the young man to keep ten feet away from his granddaughters at all times or risk losing any part of his body that crossed that line. Over time, Jack comes to accept Ty like a son and shows a great deal of concern and paternal affection for him. When Ty seeks permission from Jack to ask for Amy's hand in marriage, Jack gives him his blessing. In terms of personality, Jack is very stubborn and reluctant to accept change of any kind. This trait sometimes causes friction between him and others, most notably his romantic interest, Lisa Stillman, and with his granddaughter Lou. In season 7, Jack finally asks Lisa to marry him, and she says yes. They elope in the season 7 finale. Jack also suffers from heart problems after having a heart attack. When Jack is missing one episode after collapsing in the fields, Tim is the one to find and save him. Jack dotes on his three great-granddaughters, Katie, Georgie and Lyndy\n\n* [[Alisha Newton]] as Georgina \"Georgie\" Fleming Morris (Crawley)\n\n[[File:Alisha Newton 2015.jpg|thumb|left|180x180px|Newton]]\n:Georgie is Lou and Peter's adopted daughter, Jack's adopted great-granddaughter, and Phoenix's owner. She has a best friend named Steven whom she met in the seventh/eighth season. When she first came to Heartland, she was a misbehaving runaway, but because she wanted to stay, she began to improve her behavior. Georgie has a habit of running away from every foster home in which she's been placed. Jack agrees to foster her until Clint was able to find another family to foster her. Not wanting her to leave, Lou and Peter agree to become her long-term foster parents and later adopt her. Georgie adores Katie, her little sister. She also loves Phoenix, a horse who repeatedly ran away from a neglectful home, and through the intervention of the Fleming/Bartlett/Morris family, she found a new home at Heartland. She is a naturally talented show jumper, reminding Ty of Amy on Spartan when Georgie jumps with Phoenix. She met Phoenix when she was escaping from her social worker and rode for the first time, astounding the family. Georgie is a tomboy and shares a lot of Amy's personality; she is fearless, talented, strong-minded, and clever. This makes Mallory very jealous of her when they first meet. In Season 6, she finds an [[German Shepherd Dog|Alsatian]] dog running wild, whom she is allowed to keep and names Remi. When Georgie was 3, her birth parents were killed in a car accident. She has an older brother named Jeff. Over time, Georgie develops strong bonds with the family. However, she continues to misbehave at times, even running away once. She has a rival named Olivia, with whom she later develops a grudging friendship. In the later seasons, Georgie and Olivia join the Extreme Team, a [[trick riding]] group. This replaces show jumping as Georgie's main extracurricular interest. She works hard and is one of the best members of the team, performing stunts such as Roman riding. Georgie has some difficulty balancing schoolwork, life on a ranch, and her interest in trick riding. She struggles in math, to the point that Lou hires a math tutor on the recommendation of Georgie's teacher. While Georgie is very reluctant to have a tutor in math, her grades improve. Georgie later develops romantic feelings for Adam Parker, her tutor. Although he reciprocates her feelings, Adam's father is against their association, feeling that Georgie is a bad influence on his son. Eventually, it all works out and Georgie and Adam date for a few months. They break up over a perceived breach of privacy when Adam sees Georgie's messages exchanged with Clay McMurtry and thinks she has feelings for him. Georgie also develops a strong friendship with Jade Virani, though they were definitely not friends when they met in Season 7.\n \n* [[Chris Potter (actor)|Chris Potter]] as Timothy \"Tim\" Fleming\n\n[[File:Chris Potter 2015.jpg|thumb|right|180x180px|Potter]]\n:Tim is Amy's and Lou's father who left when they were young (Lou was a teenager, and Amy was five). After a rodeo accident, he struggled with prescription drug (painkiller) abuse and alcoholism. As a result, Jack kicked Tim out and he moved to Fort St. John. After Amy and Lou's mother dies, he comes back into the picture, moving to Big River Ranch (making him \"practically a neighbor\" to Heartland) and he becomes a regular character. Tim later buys Big River Ranch when its owner, Ray, dies and has a brief relationship with Ray's daughter, who inherited the ranch. He later begins to date a jockey named Janice, and nearly moves to California with her. However, in Season 4 Episode 18 (\"Burning Down the House\"), it is discovered that Tim has an 11-year-old son named Shane with Miranda Grenier, his ex-girlfriend from Fort St. John. When he reveals this to Janice, she leaves for California without him. At the end of season 5, it is announced that Miranda has feelings for Tim. In seasons 6-8, Tim still thinks he's a big shot. He starts a rodeo school, a horse-selling business, and a new relationship. When he finds out that Miranda is getting married, he tries to crash the wedding, until Jack hides his keys and they have an argument. After he moves on, he has a long-term relationship with Casey McMurtry and later starts his own rodeo school. His star pupils are Jade Virani and Clay McMurtry, who are both teenage bronc riders.\n\n===Supporting===\n* [[Kerry James (actor)|Kerry James]] as Caleb O'Dell\n\n:Caleb is a ranch hand hired by Jack after Ty leaves for 4 months. In the beginning he is rather husky, has feelings for Amy, and develops a strong rivalry with Ty over Amy. He and Amy are a couple for a short period, but Amy soon goes back to Ty. He grows close to and falls in love with Ashley Stanton, eventually getting married. Caleb is a rodeo cowboy, competing in events such as bronc riding. Before his marriage to Ashley, Caleb is severely injured at a rodeo. After a battle with prescription drugs and alcohol, much like Tim's, he comes out okay but much thinner. Caleb and Ashley have a difficult marriage, struggling with financial problems, pressure from Val Stanton (Ashley's mother), and differing life goals. Caleb and Ashley originally elope, but after discovering that their officiator's license had expired, they have a wedding outside Caleb's trailer (where they had been living). They go on honeymoon to Italy and stay with one of Val's friends, but Caleb returns alone. Ashley remains in Italy for a time, then decides she wants to pursue postsecondary education in Vancouver. Caleb moves to be with Ashley there, but they drift apart as she makes new friends and spends more time away from Caleb. They eventually divorce, and Caleb returns to Hudson and resumes working at Heartland as a ranch hand, though he returns to his seasonal occupation at the rodeo. Caleb loves his [[American Quarter Horse]], Shorty, who is his rodeo partner. After Ashley, Caleb pursues Lou's friend Nicole (who had moved from New York to Hudson and works for Lou, running the dude ranch). He eventually winds up in a long-term relationship with Cassandra, who was a vet student a year or two ahead of Ty and works at Scott's clinic. Caleb and Cass have a pregnancy scare, and Caleb finds the pregnancy test. There is quite a bit of dramatic irony during this episode, as the audience knows Cass is the one who might be pregnant, but Caleb and Ty become convinced it is Amy. In the end, this is sorted out. Caleb and Cass almost break up, but he eventually proposes and they are married in a church in Hudson at the end of Season 10. Ty and Amy were to attend, but Amy went into labour just as they arrived, and they had to rush home.\n\n* [[Gabriel Hogan]] as Peter Walter Morris\n\n:Peter is Lou's ex-husband. He was first introduced as PW, the owner of a small oil company called Bedford Oil, caught doing some drilling on Heartland property. This caused Lou to use her skills to organize a protest against PW's company. In the meantime, one of Lisa's 'horsey' friends finds a 'great catch' for Lou and Lisa gives out Lou's email without her permission. Stage set for a bit of [[dramatic irony]]: Lou (using her first name, Sam) and PW (using his first name, Peter) begin a relationship over an instant messaging service. They meet in person not long after, and are shocked to discover each other's full identity. Their relationship is kept secret because both Jack and Tim hate PW for being part of \"Big Oil\". Peter eventually wins the family's approval and he and Lou are married in the Season 3 Finale because Peter's business is immediately taking them to Dubai. Lou returns from Dubai for a one-week visit that stretches on because she has been living so far from Heartland and her family. Peter begins to commute to and from Dubai because Lou is expecting their first child. Peter ends up bankrupt in Dubai, which cause them to move into Jack's house. Peter ends up back on his feet, but is only home on weekends due to his new job's location in [[Vancouver]]. In Season 6, Lou and Peter decide to try to adopt Georgie when Jack isn't approved as her legal guardian, and they are ultimately successful. Peter and his first ex-wife have joint custody of a friendly [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]] named Max. Lou and Peter separate because Peter is always away in Vancouver. Peter is discovered to have a girlfriend in Vancouver, which causes Lou to end the relationship. Peter continues to visit Heartland to spend time with his daughters.\n\n* [[Nathaniel Arcand]] as Scott Cardinal\n\n:A good [[Native Canadian]] friend of the Bartlett/Fleming household who is also Heartland's vet. Scott had a troubled background, but Marion helped him to turn his life around, and he was the original \"boy in the loft\". Scott has a relationship with Lou for part of seasons 1 and 2, and later regrets the fact that he lost her and did not try harder to win her back. In season 2, Ty mentions to Amy that Scott had agreed to let Ty be his apprentice and that Scott would mentor him until he could possibly work with him after veterinary school. Ty is eventually accepted into veterinary school at the University of Calgary, and begins working part-time at Scott's clinic in later seasons. He is also joined by Cassandra, another U of C vet student who is a year or two ahead of Ty. Scott later offers Ty a position as his partner in the clinic.\n\n* [[Jessica Steen]] as Elizabeth \"Lisa\" Stillman Bartlett\n\n[[File:Jessica Steen wearing Joeffer Caoc cropped.jpg|thumb|right|180x180px|Steen]]\n:Lisa is the charismatic owner of Fairfield Stables, and a well-known horse breeder. She is introduced when she comes to Amy for help with a horse in the first few episodes of the series. Jack and Lisa seem to have chemistry in that episode, and begin a romantic relationship a few episodes later. Lisa is often in the south of France seasonally for work, and her jet-setting lifestyle becomes a difficulty in her relationship with Jack. He visits France with her several seasons into their relationship, but does not enjoy himself, feeling out of place in the fancy places they visit. After a lengthy break, Lisa returns to Heartland and reunites with Jack. At the end of season 7, they elope but decide to continue living separately, as they are most comfortable this way. Lisa is also the godmother to Lou and Peter's daughter, Katie.\n\n*Julia Maren Baker as Katie Fleming Morris\n\n:Catherine \"Katie\" Marion Minnie Fleming Morris is Lou and Peter's only biological daughter, born in episode 67, \"Passages\". As an infant, the family took a large amount of time getting her to sleep through the night, and an episode featured this difficulty. Mallory is often brought in to babysit, since she's often at Heartland anyway, and interested in earning extra cash. In Season 7, Katie often cries at night for Lou, who is in the Atlantic provinces on a tour for her book, ''Mom's the Word''. Katie also starts bed-wetting, presumably for the same reason. As a result, Peter and Katie eventually join Lou on her book tour. Later in the series, Lou worries that Katie is not progressing as she should, taking her to see a pediatrician to check for abnormalities. This causes friction between Lou and Peter, as he believes that Katie is fine, which turns out to be the case. As of Season 10, Katie is a young, energetic girl who enjoys spending time with her family, especially her adoptive older sister Georgie and her great-grandfather. She has a favorite stuffed toy pony, called \"Pogy\".  As a baby, Katie was played by twin sisters Keira and Jordan.\n\n[[File:Heartland 2015 cast.jpg|250px|thumb|right|''Heartland'' Cast in 2015]]\n\n===Recurring===\n\n* Sara Rodrigues actress \n*[[Kevin McGarry (actor)|Kevin McGarry]] as Mitch Cutty\n\n: Mitch is hired as a ranch hand at Heartland and works hard to earn the family's respect, especially with Jack and Tim.

Tim is doubtful of Jade at first but grows to respect her tenacity and talent.\n* [[Kaitlyn Leeb]] as Cassandra\n\n: Introduced as one of Ty's classmates at veterinarian school, Cassandra ends up working at the vet clinic with Ty. She initially appears to be an ambitious and arrogant know-it-all, which makes Amy uncomfortable. She is romantically involved with Jeremy Hughes until he sabotages Heartland, after which she is fired from the vet clinic and forced to take a job at the dude ranch, to which she is ill-suited.  Scott convinces a reluctant Ty to give Cass another chance at their understaffed clinic, where she eventually becomes a good friend to Amy and Ty.  She and Caleb wind up in a long-term relationship and are married in the final episode of season 10. \n* [[Greta Onieogou]] as Soraya Duval\n\n: Amy's best friend who works at ''Maggie's'', her mom's diner.

She briefly returns at the end of season 8 to attend Amy and Ty's wedding at the Heartland Ranch.   \n* [[Wanda Cannon]] as Valerie \"Val\" Stanton\n\n: Ashley and Jesse's widowed mother, and the main antagonist throughout much of the series. Val is the proud owner of Briar Ridge Stables and uses more traditional methods of horse training compared to Heartland. Val puts too much pressure on Ashley to win horse shows, but loves and spoils her daughter. She is also friends with Jack, particularly when Jack helps her to work on her relationship with her daughter, after Ashley becomes more independent and rebellious. It is revealed in season 7 that she now lives in Florida.\n* [[Anna Ferguson]] as Sally Bell\n\n: A long time family friend of the Fleming/Bartlett family who owns Sugarfoot, a cute [[Shetland pony]] whom Lou learned to ride on.

She was mostly known for talking too much and prying into everyone's personal lives, which often got her into trouble.  Mallory rides the horses at Heartland and participates in jumping competitions.  She is easily infatuated with boys, and has a crush on Ty early in the series, though her main love interests wind up being Jake Anderson and Badger.  Mallory leaves Heartland several times, most significantly to attend an all-girls boarding school to which she is sent by her parents when her father goes on tour the first time. Jake helps her buy a bus ticket and return to Heartland.  At the end of Season 5, she announced with dismay that she was moving to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] for her father's music career, though she and her family returned to Canada in season 6.

In season 10, episode 14, Mallory came back to Heartland and married him.\n\n* [[Cindy Busby]] as Ashley Stanton\n\n: In season 1, she fulfilled the [[archetype]] of the high-school mean girl, but after Amy helps Ashley improve her show-jumping and later saves her horse Apollo, Ashley warms up to Amy and her best friend Soraya. Ashley's character develops substantially from this point, and she is shown to struggle in her relationship with her mother. As a result, she lives at Heartland for a short period of time, and later stays with Caleb, in his rented trailer. Ashley gradually falls for Caleb in Season 2 and starts a serious relationship with him, and they marry in the season 3 finale.

When Miranda reveals to Tim that Shane is his son (in \"Burning Down the House\"), the relationship is confirmed with a [[paternity test]] and upsets Tim's family and friends when they discover the truth.  Shane tends to run away and hitchhike to visit Heartland to visit his family and his horse, Pal, and wishes that Miranda and Tim would reconcile and become friends.\n* [[Rhys Ward]] as Jeremy Hughes\n\n:A professional show jumper who refused Ty and Scott's treatment for his horse Buckingham, as it would prevent him from continuing his jumping career during the season.  He quickly captures Mallory's attention, though she is disappointed to discover his interest in her was to find a way to gain access to Phoenix, who he saw as a suitable replacement for Buckingham and that he is already in a casual relationship with Ty's classmate Cassandra.  Jeremy attempts to trick Amy into giving him Phoenix in order to save Buckingham from a risky surgery by getting her drunk to agree, though she turns against his deal for Georgie's sake.

[[dramatic programming|family drama]] [[television series]] which debuted on [[CBC Television|CBC]] on October 14, 2007.\n\nThe series is based on the ''[[Heartland (novel series)|Heartland]]'' book series by [[Lauren Brooke]] and follows sisters Amy and Lou Fleming, their grandfather Jack Bartlett, and Ty Borden through the highs and lows of life at the ranch.\n\nWith the airing of its 139th episode on March 29, 2015, ''Heartland'' surpassed ''[[Street Legal (Canadian TV series)|Street Legal]]'' as the longest-running one-hour scripted drama<!-- show The Beachcombers was a 1/2 hour scripted drama --> in Canadian television history.\n\nIn May 2019, Heartland was officially renewed for its 13th season.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===Main===\n* [[Amber Marshall]] as Amy Fleming\n\n[[File:Amber Marshall 2015.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Marshall]]\n: The protagonist of the series, Amy inherited her mother's gift of being able to intuit the needs of horses and of practicing [[natural horsemanship]].  When Amy was fifteen years old, she was seriously injured in a car accident that killed her mother, Marion, while she was attempting to save Spartan, an abused horse. Amy is unable to attend her mother's funeral while recuperating at the hospital, but her estranged father Tim returns to attend Marion's funeral. When Amy returns home, she decides to continue her mother's work of healing abused or damaged horses, including Spartan. However, she must readjust not only to her father re-entering her life, but also the return of her older sister Lou, who has been living in [[New York City]]. Over time, Amy develops a close relationship with Ty Borden, a young man invited by Marion before her death to work as a ranch hand at Heartland as part of his probation. Ty begins to assist Amy in healing the horses and their friendship gradually turns to love. Though their relationship is rocky and they break up more than once, they manage to make amends and Ty gives Amy a promise ring in season 3. In the last episode of season 5, Ty secretly makes plans to propose to Amy, but after hearing her say how they should never \"tie themselves down\", he decides against it, not realizing Amy would later find the ring in his pocket. After they discuss the ring and marriage, Ty later finds the perfect moment to propose to Amy, and she accepts. The change in their relationship results in them breaking up briefly, getting back together when they rescue a herd of horses penned by ranchers who believed the horses to be detrimental to the land required for their cattle. Amy and Ty eventually marry in Jack's house, with Amy escorted by both Tim and Jack, and she rides in on Spartan. After getting married, she and Ty reside in the renovated loft at Jack's house. At the end of season 9, Amy reveals she is pregnant, though she goes through her pregnancy without Ty by her side, as he is away in Mongolia to save Gobi bears, a decision in which Amy supported Ty. They regularly communicate through Skype, though she misses having him nearby. At the end of Season 10, Amy gives birth at home to a baby girl, Lyndy Marion.\n\n* [[Graham Wardle]] as Tyler \"Ty\" Borden\n\n[[File:Graham Wardle 2013.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Wardle]]\n: When Ty was a child, he was abused by his stepfather Wade, whom he attacked for assaulting Ty's mother.  The incident resulted in Ty's arrest and being sent to [[Juvenile hall]]; to complete his probation, Marion Fleming offered him a job as a ranch hand at Heartland. He soon begins to enjoy his life there and decides to stay after completing his probation, though he leaves for a short period to live with his biological father in [[Calgary]]. Jack treats Ty like a son and is very proud of him, especially after he earns his high school diploma and decides to study to become a vet. Ty at first is known as the \"new cute guy\" by Amy's friends, and Amy quickly falls for him. Ty dated Kit Bailey, a local cowgirl, for a time before he admitted his feelings for Amy. He and Amy have a tumultuous relationship over the subsequent seasons.  In the final episode of Season 5, Ty buys a ring with plans to propose to Amy, but rethinks his proposal after hearing Amy say they should never \"tie themselves down.\"  When Amy discovers the ring, Ty and Amy agree to wait, and Ty is accepted to vet school and begins assisting Scott at his clinic.  While camping, Ty finds the perfect moment to propose to Amy, who accepts, and they later marry.  After Amy tells Ty that he is going to become a father, she supports his decision to go to Mongolia to save the last of the Gobi bears with Veterinarians Without Borders.  Though he is unable to be by Amy's side throughout her pregnancy, they communicate frequently through Skype. Near the end of the season, Ty contracts a potentially life-threatening illness from a tick bite and returns to Calgary in critical condition. He is immediately taken to the hospital, where they help him to slowly recover. At the end of the season, Caleb breaks Ty out of the hospital (where he was being kept while the doctors ran additional tests to ensure he was cured) so that Ty can participate in Caleb's wedding to Cass as the best man. However, Amy goes into labor as they arrive at the church and they rush home for the birth of their daughter.\n\n* [[Michelle Morgan (actress)|Michelle Morgan]] as Samantha Louise \"Lou\" Fleming Morris\n\n[[File:Michelle Morgan 2015.jpg|thumb|left|180x180px|Morgan]]\n:At the beginning of the series, Lou moves back home from her job in [[New York City]] to help run Heartland. She is initially reluctant to stay in Hudson because she has a long-term boyfriend and a lucrative job in New York. Upon discovering Heartland's poor economic situation, she crafts a financial plan with knowledge from her MBA to pull the ranch out of debt and make it successful. However, she is told by a financial adviser at the bank that her presence at the ranch is essential to secure the loan necessary to implement her plan. Once Lou decides to stay, she runs the business end of Heartland, taking care of appointments and setting rates for stabling patient horses. She later sets her mind to starting a new business venture, a corporate retreat center: The Heartland Equestrian Connection. This idea is met with much resistance, especially from Jack. Family members derisively refer to the business as the \"Dude Ranch\", and the name sticks, though no longer with its negative connotation. Along the way, Lou breaks up with her boyfriend from New York and tries to re-kindle a romance with the local vet, Scott Cardinal. In season two, Lou's relationship with Scott dissolves. She meets her future husband, Peter, thanks to a setup by Jack's girlfriend Lisa, and starts a secret relationship with him due to Peter's job in the oil industry. Lou had previously rallied the local ranchers against Peter's oil company, and expects Jack would not approve of her choice of boyfriend. Later, Lou's relationship with Peter is more public and they marry at the end of season 3. They move to [[Dubai]], but she soon feels very alone in such a foreign country and grows to miss Heartland and her family. When they move back home, Lou finds out she is pregnant. She later gives birth to a girl named Catherine Marion Minnie Fleming-Morris (often referred to as Katie). After several failed attempts to buy a place of their own and even to build a home somewhere on the 600 acre property at Heartland, Lou and Peter buy Mr. Hanley's ranch from Mrs. Bell and they plan to move into it and refurbish it. However, faulty wiring in the structure causes a fire, and the buildings and stables burn, leaving them no choice but to remain at Heartland. Lou has a positive relationship with her sister Amy, providing a listening ear and timely advice when she needs it, and Amy often plays the same role for Lou. Lou is also close with her father, Tim, and she is the first one to reconnect with him after Marion's death. In Season 6, Lou and Peter decide to adopt an orphan named Georgina Crawley, whom Jack had been fostering after discovering her hiding in the loft. In season 8, Lou and Peter start having relationship problems since Peter is constantly in Vancouver for his job. On Amy's advice, Lou goes to Vancouver to talk things over with him, but they decide to separate. Peter returns to Hudson to try to persuade Lou that they can work things out, but she is not interested, since nothing has changed. Lou later tries online dating, and seems to be falling for the new stable hand, Mitch. Peter visits regularly for his daughters, and interferes with Lou and Mitch's budding romance whenever he is at Heartland. In season 7, Lou buys Maggie's after Maggie moves to be with her daughter, Soraya, in [[London, England]]. She runs it with Tim, who acts as her supposedly \"silent\" business partner. Lou eventually works on bringing Maggie's to New York City and spends much of her time flying back and forth, with the rest of her family taking care of Georgie and Katie.\n\n* [[Shaun Johnston]] as Jackson \"Jack\" Bartlett\n\n[[File:Shaun Johnston 2015.jpg|thumb|right|180x180px|Shaun Johnston]]\n:The family patriarch, Jack is Amy and Lou's grandfather and was Marion's father. He is a former rodeo star and was once a cattle rancher. When Marion took over, Heartland became a horse ranch. After her death, Jack helps Amy and Ty maintain Heartland and its horses and he is the one who fixes broken equipment, fences, and the like. Early in the series, he was very hostile towards ex-son-in-law Tim. The men have maintained a difficult relationship stemming from Tim's troubled past with alcohol and prescription drug abuse, his acrimonious divorce from Marion, and lack of involvement in Amy and Lou's lives. Jack seems to barely tolerate Tim's presence at times, and they've had numerous arguments over the running of the ranch. Jack was initially very judgmental towards Ty, and he warned the young man to keep ten feet away from his granddaughters at all times or risk losing any part of his body that crossed that line. Over time, Jack comes to accept Ty like a son and shows a great deal of concern and paternal affection for him. When Ty seeks permission from Jack to ask for Amy's hand in marriage, Jack gives him his blessing. In terms of personality, Jack is very stubborn and reluctant to accept change of any kind. This trait sometimes causes friction between him and others, most notably his romantic interest, Lisa Stillman, and with his granddaughter Lou. In season 7, Jack finally asks Lisa to marry him, and she says yes. They elope in the season 7 finale. Jack also suffers from heart problems after having a heart attack. When Jack is missing one episode after collapsing in the fields, Tim is the one to find and save him. Jack dotes on his three great-granddaughters, Katie, Georgie and Lyndy\n\n* [[Alisha Newton]] as Georgina \"Georgie\" Fleming Morris (Crawley)\n\n[[File:Alisha Newton 2015.jpg|thumb|left|180x180px|Newton]]\n:Georgie is Lou and Peter's adopted daughter, Jack's adopted great-granddaughter, and Phoenix's owner. She has a best friend named Steven whom she met in the seventh/eighth season. When she first came to Heartland, she was a misbehaving runaway, but because she wanted to stay, she began to improve her behavior. Georgie has a habit of running away from every foster home in which she's been placed. Jack agrees to foster her until Clint was able to find another family to foster her. Not wanting her to leave, Lou and Peter agree to become her long-term foster parents and later adopt her. Georgie adores Katie, her little sister. She also loves Phoenix, a horse who repeatedly ran away from a neglectful home, and through the intervention of the Fleming/Bartlett/Morris family, she found a new home at Heartland. She is a naturally talented show jumper, reminding Ty of Amy on Spartan when Georgie jumps with Phoenix. She met Phoenix when she was escaping from her social worker and rode for the first time, astounding the family. Georgie is a tomboy and shares a lot of Amy's personality; she is fearless, talented, strong-minded, and clever. This makes Mallory very jealous of her when they first meet. In Season 6, she finds an [[German Shepherd Dog|Alsatian]] dog running wild, whom she is allowed to keep and names Remi. When Georgie was 3, her birth parents were killed in a car accident. She has an older brother named Jeff. Over time, Georgie develops strong bonds with the family. However, she continues to misbehave at times, even running away once. She has a rival named Olivia, with whom she later develops a grudging friendship. In the later seasons, Georgie and Olivia join the Extreme Team, a [[trick riding]] group. This replaces show jumping as Georgie's main extracurricular interest. She works hard and is one of the best members of the team, performing stunts such as Roman riding. Georgie has some difficulty balancing schoolwork, life on a ranch, and her interest in trick riding. She struggles in math, to the point that Lou hires a math tutor on the recommendation of Georgie's teacher. While Georgie is very reluctant to have a tutor in math, her grades improve. Georgie later develops romantic feelings for Adam Parker, her tutor. Although he reciprocates her feelings, Adam's father is against their association, feeling that Georgie is a bad influence on his son. Eventually, it all works out and Georgie and Adam date for a few months. They break up over a perceived breach of privacy when Adam sees Georgie's messages exchanged with Clay McMurtry and thinks she has feelings for him. Georgie also develops a strong friendship with Jade Virani, though they were definitely not friends when they met in Season 7.\n \n* [[Chris Potter (actor)|Chris Potter]] as Timothy \"Tim\" Fleming\n\n[[File:Chris Potter 2015.jpg|thumb|right|180x180px|Potter]]\n:Tim is Amy's and Lou's father who left when they were young (Lou was a teenager, and Amy was five). After a rodeo accident, he struggled with prescription drug (painkiller) abuse and alcoholism. As a result, Jack kicked Tim out and he moved to Fort St. John. After Amy and Lou's mother dies, he comes back into the picture, moving to Big River Ranch (making him \"practically a neighbor\" to Heartland) and he becomes a regular character. Tim later buys Big River Ranch when its owner, Ray, dies and has a brief relationship with Ray's daughter, who inherited the ranch. He later begins to date a jockey named Janice, and nearly moves to California with her. However, in Season 4 Episode 18 (\"Burning Down the House\"), it is discovered that Tim has an 11-year-old son named Shane with Miranda Grenier, his ex-girlfriend from Fort St. John. When he reveals this to Janice, she leaves for California without him. At the end of season 5, it is announced that Miranda has feelings for Tim. In seasons 6-8, Tim still thinks he's a big shot. He starts a rodeo school, a horse-selling business, and a new relationship. When he finds out that Miranda is getting married, he tries to crash the wedding, until Jack hides his keys and they have an argument. After he moves on, he has a long-term relationship with Casey McMurtry and later starts his own rodeo school. His star pupils are Jade Virani and Clay McMurtry, who are both teenage bronc riders.\n\n===Supporting===\n* [[Kerry James (actor)|Kerry James]] as Caleb O'Dell\n\n:Caleb is a ranch hand hired by Jack after Ty leaves for 4 months. In the beginning he is rather husky, has feelings for Amy, and develops a strong rivalry with Ty over Amy. He and Amy are a couple for a short period, but Amy soon goes back to Ty. He grows close to and falls in love with Ashley Stanton, eventually getting married. Caleb is a rodeo cowboy, competing in events such as bronc riding. Before his marriage to Ashley, Caleb is severely injured at a rodeo. After a battle with prescription drugs and alcohol, much like Tim's, he comes out okay but much thinner. Caleb and Ashley have a difficult marriage, struggling with financial problems, pressure from Val Stanton (Ashley's mother), and differing life goals. Caleb and Ashley originally elope, but after discovering that their officiator's license had expired, they have a wedding outside Caleb's trailer (where they had been living). They go on honeymoon to Italy and stay with one of Val's friends, but Caleb returns alone. Ashley remains in Italy for a time, then decides she wants to pursue postsecondary education in Vancouver. Caleb moves to be with Ashley there, but they drift apart as she makes new friends and spends more time away from Caleb. They eventually divorce, and Caleb returns to Hudson and resumes working at Heartland as a ranch hand, though he returns to his seasonal occupation at the rodeo. Caleb loves his [[American Quarter Horse]], Shorty, who is his rodeo partner. After Ashley, Caleb pursues Lou's friend Nicole (who had moved from New York to Hudson and works for Lou, running the dude ranch). He eventually winds up in a long-term relationship with Cassandra, who was a vet student a year or two ahead of Ty and works at Scott's clinic. Caleb and Cass have a pregnancy scare, and Caleb finds the pregnancy test. There is quite a bit of dramatic irony during this episode, as the audience knows Cass is the one who might be pregnant, but Caleb and Ty become convinced it is Amy. In the end, this is sorted out. Caleb and Cass almost break up, but he eventually proposes and they are married in a church in Hudson at the end of Season 10. Ty and Amy were to attend, but Amy went into labour just as they arrived, and they had to rush home.\n\n* [[Gabriel Hogan]] as Peter Walter Morris\n\n:Peter is Lou's ex-husband. He was first introduced as PW, the owner of a small oil company called Bedford Oil, caught doing some drilling on Heartland property. This caused Lou to use her skills to organize a protest against PW's company. In the meantime, one of Lisa's 'horsey' friends finds a 'great catch' for Lou and Lisa gives out Lou's email without her permission. Stage set for a bit of [[dramatic irony]]: Lou (using her first name, Sam) and PW (using his first name, Peter) begin a relationship over an instant messaging service. They meet in person not long after, and are shocked to discover each other's full identity. Their relationship is kept secret because both Jack and Tim hate PW for being part of \"Big Oil\". Peter eventually wins the family's approval and he and Lou are married in the Season 3 Finale because Peter's business is immediately taking them to Dubai. Lou returns from Dubai for a one-week visit that stretches on because she has been living so far from Heartland and her family. Peter begins to commute to and from Dubai because Lou is expecting their first child. Peter ends up bankrupt in Dubai, which cause them to move into Jack's house. Peter ends up back on his feet, but is only home on weekends due to his new job's location in [[Vancouver]]. In Season 6, Lou and Peter decide to try to adopt Georgie when Jack isn't approved as her legal guardian, and they are ultimately successful. Peter and his first ex-wife have joint custody of a friendly [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]] named Max. Lou and Peter separate because Peter is always away in Vancouver. Peter is discovered to have a girlfriend in Vancouver, which causes Lou to end the relationship. Peter continues to visit Heartland to spend time with his daughters.\n\n* [[Nathaniel Arcand]] as Scott Cardinal\n\n:A good [[Native Canadian]] friend of the Bartlett/Fleming household who is also Heartland's vet. Scott had a troubled background, but Marion helped him to turn his life around, and he was the original \"boy in the loft\". Scott has a relationship with Lou for part of seasons 1 and 2, and later regrets the fact that he lost her and did not try harder to win her back. In season 2, Ty mentions to Amy that Scott had agreed to let Ty be his apprentice and that Scott would mentor him until he could possibly work with him after veterinary school. Ty is eventually accepted into veterinary school at the University of Calgary, and begins working part-time at Scott's clinic in later seasons. He is also joined by Cassandra, another U of C vet student who is a year or two ahead of Ty. Scott later offers Ty a position as his partner in the clinic.\n\n* [[Jessica Steen]] as Elizabeth \"Lisa\" Stillman Bartlett\n\n[[File:Jessica Steen wearing Joeffer Caoc cropped.jpg|thumb|right|180x180px|Steen]]\n:Lisa is the charismatic owner of Fairfield Stables, and a well-known horse breeder. She is introduced when she comes to Amy for help with a horse in the first few episodes of the series. Jack and Lisa seem to have chemistry in that episode, and begin a romantic relationship a few episodes later. Lisa is often in the south of France seasonally for work, and her jet-setting lifestyle becomes a difficulty in her relationship with Jack. He visits France with her several seasons into their relationship, but does not enjoy himself, feeling out of place in the fancy places they visit. After a lengthy break, Lisa returns to Heartland and reunites with Jack. At the end of season 7, they elope but decide to continue living separately, as they are most comfortable this way. Lisa is also the godmother to Lou and Peter's daughter, Katie.\n\n*Julia Maren Baker as Katie Fleming Morris\n\n:Catherine \"Katie\" Marion Minnie Fleming Morris is Lou and Peter's only biological daughter, born in episode 67, \"Passages\". As an infant, the family took a large amount of time getting her to sleep through the night, and an episode featured this difficulty. Mallory is often brought in to babysit, since she's often at Heartland anyway, and interested in earning extra cash. In Season 7, Katie often cries at night for Lou, who is in the Atlantic provinces on a tour for her book, ''Mom's the Word''. Katie also starts bed-wetting, presumably for the same reason. As a result, Peter and Katie eventually join Lou on her book tour. Later in the series, Lou worries that Katie is not progressing as she should, taking her to see a pediatrician to check for abnormalities. This causes friction between Lou and Peter, as he believes that Katie is fine, which turns out to be the case. As of Season 10, Katie is a young, energetic girl who enjoys spending time with her family, especially her adoptive older sister Georgie and her great-grandfather. She has a favorite stuffed toy pony, called \"Pogy\".  As a baby, Katie was played by twin sisters Keira and Jordan.\n\n[[File:Heartland 2015 cast.jpg|250px|thumb|right|''Heartland'' Cast in 2015]]\n\n===Recurring===\n<br />\n\n* Sara Rodrigues actress \n*[[Kevin McGarry (actor)|Kevin McGarry]] as Mitch Cutty\n\n: Mitch is hired as a ranch hand at Heartland and works hard to earn the family's respect, especially with Jack and Tim. After much hostility, Tim nicknames Mitch \"Trooper\" after a tenacious but respectable bronc on the circuit. Following an awkward first \"date,\" Mitch and Lou enter into an off-and-on relationship. Mitch is troubled by guilt due to the loss of his cousin to PTSD but confides in Lou and they earn each other's trust.

Tim is doubtful of Jade at first but grows to respect her tenacity and talent.\n* [[Kaitlyn Leeb]] as Cassandra\n\n: Introduced as one of Ty's classmates at veterinarian school, Cassandra ends up working at the vet clinic with Ty. She initially appears to be an ambitious and arrogant know-it-all, which makes Amy uncomfortable. She is romantically involved with Jeremy Hughes until he sabotages Heartland, after which she is fired from the vet clinic and forced to take a job at the dude ranch, to which she is ill-suited.  Scott convinces a reluctant Ty to give Cass another chance at their understaffed clinic, where she eventually becomes a good friend to Amy and Ty.  She and Caleb wind up in a long-term relationship and are married in the final episode of season 10. \n* [[Greta Onieogou]] as Soraya Duval\n\n: Amy's best friend who works at ''Maggie's'', her mom's diner. Soraya always supports Amy and becomes friends with Ashley around the same time as Amy. She later visits [[London, England]] and meets a new boyfriend. In Season 5, Soraya moves to London permanently. She briefly returns at the end of season 8 to attend Amy and Ty's wedding at the Heartland Ranch.   \n* [[Wanda Cannon]] as Valerie \"Val\" Stanton\n\n: Ashley and Jesse's widowed mother, and the main antagonist throughout much of the series. Val is the proud owner of Briar Ridge Stables and uses more traditional methods of horse training compared to Heartland. Val puts too much pressure on Ashley to win horse shows, but loves and spoils her daughter. She is also friends with Jack, particularly when Jack helps her to work on her relationship with her daughter, after Ashley becomes more independent and rebellious. It is revealed in season 7 that she now lives in Florida.\n* [[Anna Ferguson]] as Sally Bell\n\n: A long time family friend of the Fleming/Bartlett family who owns Sugarfoot, a cute [[Shetland pony]] whom Lou learned to ride on. Mrs. Bell keeps Sugarfoot in her house as a companion, and prefers using her herbal remedies on him rather than having him cared for by Scott or the farrier. Mrs. Bell made Marion's and Amy's wedding dresses. In the books Mrs. Bell dies from a heart attack and Sugarfoot comes to live at Heartland.\n* Ruby & Emmanuella Spencer as Lyndy Marion Borden\n\n: Amy and Ty's daughter, born in Episode 175, \"Greater Expectations\". Her guardians (godparents), should anything happen to Amy and Ty, are Caleb and Cassandra.\n\n===Former cast===\n====Main====\n* [[Jessica Amlee]] as Mallory Wells Anderson\n\n: A friend of the family who visited frequently and often stayed overnight, Mallory is the daughter of a Canadian country music artist (real-life Canadian country music artist [[George Canyon]]), whose music she finds annoying,  and is hired by Lou to babysit Katie on a regular basis.  She was mostly known for talking too much and prying into everyone's personal lives, which often got her into trouble.  Mallory rides the horses at Heartland and participates in jumping competitions.  She is easily infatuated with boys, and has a crush on Ty early in the series, though her main love interests wind up being Jake Anderson and Badger.  Mallory leaves Heartland several times, most significantly to attend an all-girls boarding school to which she is sent by her parents when her father goes on tour the first time. Jake helps her buy a bus ticket and return to Heartland.  At the end of Season 5, she announced with dismay that she was moving to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] for her father's music career, though she and her family returned to Canada in season 6.   In season 7, she finally confessed her feelings for Jake and went with him to [[Paris, France]]. In season 10, episode 14, Mallory came back to Heartland and married him.\n\n* [[Cindy Busby]] as Ashley Stanton\n\n: In season 1, she fulfilled the [[archetype]] of the high-school mean girl, but after Amy helps Ashley improve her show-jumping and later saves her horse Apollo, Ashley warms up to Amy and her best friend Soraya. Ashley's character develops substantially from this point, and she is shown to struggle in her relationship with her mother. As a result, she lives at Heartland for a short period of time, and later stays with Caleb, in his rented trailer. Ashley gradually falls for Caleb in Season 2 and starts a serious relationship with him, and they marry in the season 3 finale. It took Ashley a while to come back from their honeymoon in Italy, resulting in Caleb coming home alone. Later in the series, Ashley and Caleb moved away so she could attend college. Caleb returned alone again, and they eventually got a divorce.\n\n====Recurring====\n* [[Jade Hassoun\u00e9]] as Prince Ahmed Al Saeed\n\n: A wealthy prince, the initially rude Ahmed asks Amy for help with his father's horse. After working with the horse, Ahmed becomes more friendly towards her, eventually falling for her and showering her with expensive gifts. He offers Amy the opportunity to accompany him on a European tour; however, when he displays his affection for her she does not return the sentiment. Ahmed appears in eight episodes, culminating in a physical exchange with Ty in Season 8.\n* [[Maxim Roy]] as Miranda Grenier\n\n: Shane's overprotective mother and Tim's ex-girlfriend.  Miranda only wants what's best for her son, but moves frequently to prevent Shane learning who is father is as she is scared of losing him.  Her strained relationship with Tim results in a custody battle over Shane, though they manage to work things out.\n* [[Sam Duke]] as Shane Grenier Fleming\n\n: Tim's long lost, 11-year-old son and Lou and Amy's [[half brother]], who was conceived during a casual relationship between Tim and Miranda while Tim lived in [[Fort St. John, British Columbia|Fort St. John]], during the years after his rodeo accident, before he returned to Hudson.  When Miranda reveals to Tim that Shane is his son (in \"Burning Down the House\"), the relationship is confirmed with a [[paternity test]] and upsets Tim's family and friends when they discover the truth.

The team is controlled by the governing body for rugby league in Fiji, [[Fiji National Rugby League]] (FNRL), which is currently a member of the Asia-Pacific Rugby League Confederation (APRLC). Fiji have thrice reached the semi-finals of the [[Rugby League World Cup]], in [[2008 Rugby League World Cup|2008]], [[2013 Rugby League World Cup|2013]] and [[2017 Rugby League World Cup|2017]], and are currently ranked 5th in the [[Rugby League International Federation]]'s [[RLIF World Rankings|World Rankings]].\n\n==History==\n===1990s===\nThe game was introduced to Fiji only in 1992 but despite this there has been a long history of Fijian players making their mark in rugby league, most notably back in the 1960s when great players such as [[Joe Levula]] and [[Laitia Ravouvou]] joined [[Rochdale Hornets]] and became household names in the English competition.\n\nInterest and participation in rugby league snowballed throughout Fiji, and as well as continued success in the World Sevens, the Batis began playing full 13-aside games against international teams. By 1994, Fiji had hammered the Great Britain Amateur tourists (40-8) and, captained by mighty front-rower James Pickering, beat France (20-12).\n\nThey had also produced their first rugby league superstar after winger [[Noa Nadruku]] joined [[Canberra Raiders]] and in 1993 became the top try-scorer in the Australian competition.\n\nFiji took part in their first [[1995 Rugby League World Cup|World Cup in 1995]] where, just as the [[2000 Rugby League World Cup|2000 World Cup]], they had the misfortune to be placed in the same group as both England and Australia. But the Batis made a massive impression in their opening World Cup game in which they ran riot against South Africa, 52-6, and had the crowd on their feet at Keighley.\n\nDuring the [[Super League war]], Fiji, like most countries other countries, aligned itself with Super League. In search of international competition, the [[Australian Rugby League]] played a match against a \"National Rugby League of Fiji\" team in 1996. This match has been granted Test status by the [[Australian Rugby League]], but not by the [[Rugby League International Federation]].\n\n===2000s===\nCoached by [[Don Furner, Sr.]] and captained by [[Lote Tuqiri]], Fiji competed in the [[2000 Rugby League World Cup|2000 World Cup]] but did not progress past the tournament's group stage.\n\nThe Fiji Bati qualified for the [[2008 Rugby League World Cup]] held in Australia after finishing second in Pacific qualifying behind [[Tonga]]. Fiji's qualification campaign started with a thrilling 30-28 loss to Samoa before reversing the scoreline a few days later with a 30-28 win over the Tongans. Fiji won their final qualifying game against Cook Islands 40-4. Having qualified the Vodafone Fiji Bati team started their Rugby League World Cup 2008 campaign with 42-6 win over France followed by a 2-point defeat to Scotland, however they topped their group with a superior points difference. Beating Ireland in their quarter final they came within one match of the World Cup final, but were defeated by Australia, ending the tournament in 4th place.\n\n===2010s===\nFiji automatically qualified for the [[2013 Rugby League World Cup]] after participating in the 2008 tournament. They took on \n[[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]], [[England national rugby league team|England]] and [[Ireland national rugby league team|Ireland]] in the pool stage. In their first match they took on 'the Wolfhounds'. They played at the famous [[Spotland Stadium]], in [[Rochdale]], where Fiji have an historic affiliation with. The Fijians convincingly won by a score of 32-14. As expected Fiji lost to both Australia and England, although they surprised many, as they only conceded 34 points against the teams in each game and they led 2-0 against Australia, and were within a few minutes of taking a half-time lead against England. Fiji would take on 'fierce Pacific rivals' [[Samoa national rugby league team|Samoa]] in the quarter final. They won the, passionate pacific, fixture and they would celebrate with a 22-4 victory. They celebrated even more, as it meant Fiji reached their second consecutive World Cup semi-final. They took on Australia again, but this game was nothing like the group stage fixture. Fiji's errors conceded them 62 points against a classy Australian side. This defeat ended and equalled their best World Cup campaign in their history.\n\nIn May 2014, Fiji took on [[Samoa national rugby league team|Samoa]] in the [[Pacific Rugby League International#2014 test|2014 Pacific Rugby League Test]] at [[Penrith Stadium]]. The International was created as a qualifier for the final [[Rugby League Four Nations|2014 Four Nations]] spot. It was also a chance for the Four Nations team (winner of this international) to warm-up before the event kicked off later in the year. Fiji failed to qualify with their fierce pacific rivals getting the better of them by 32-16.\n\nIn May 2015, Fiji took on [[Papua New Guinea national rugby league team|Papua New Guinea]] in the [[Pacific Rugby League International#Melanesian Cup|2015 Melanesian Cup test]] at [[Cbus Super Stadium]]. Fiji won the match and the inaugural Melanesian Cup title.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrl.com/koroibete-delights-in-fiji-win-over-png/tabid/10874/newsid/85893/default.aspx|title=Fiji vs. PNG 2015 Melanesian Cup|publisher=Nrl.com|accessdate=2 May 2015}}</ref> Fiji never looked like losing the match after an easy first half performance, leading 18-0 at the break. They went on to win the test match by 22-10.\n\nIn May 2016, Fiji took on [[Papua New Guinea national rugby league team|Papua New Guinea]] in the [[Pacific Rugby League International#Melanesian Cup 2|2016 Melanesian Cup test]] at [[Pirtek Stadium]]. Fiji had a similar situation in this year's Melanesian Cup with a half-time score of 16-8 but this time around they conceded too many second half points allowing the Kumuls to make a shock comeback and win the match 24-22.\n\n===2020s===\nFiji automatically qualified for the [[2021 Rugby League World Cup]] having reached the semi finals of the previous [[Rugby League World Cup]]. The 2021 tournament will take place in [[England]]. {{main|2021 Rugby League World Cup qualifying}}\n\n==Kit==\n{|\n|{{Football kit

international [[rugby league]] football since 1992. The team is controlled by the governing body for rugby league in Fiji, [[Fiji National Rugby League]] (FNRL), which is currently a member of the Asia-Pacific Rugby League Confederation (APRLC). Fiji have thrice reached the semi-finals of the [[Rugby League World Cup]], in [[2008 Rugby League World Cup|2008]], [[2013 Rugby League World Cup|2013]] and [[2017 Rugby League World Cup|2017]], and are currently ranked 5th in the [[Rugby League International Federation]]'s [[RLIF World Rankings|World Rankings]].\n\n==History==\n===1990s===\nThe game was introduced to Fiji only in 1992 but despite this there has been a long history of Fijian players making their mark in rugby league, most notably back in the 1960s when great players such as [[Joe Levula]] and [[Laitia Ravouvou]] joined [[Rochdale Hornets]] and became household names in the English competition.\n\nInterest and participation in rugby league snowballed throughout Fiji, and as well as continued success in the World Sevens, the Batis began playing full 13-aside games against international teams. By 1994, Fiji had hammered the Great Britain Amateur tourists (40-8) and, captained by mighty front-rower James Pickering, beat France (20-12).\n\nThey had also produced their first rugby league superstar after winger [[Noa Nadruku]] joined [[Canberra Raiders]] and in 1993 became the top try-scorer in the Australian competition.\n\nFiji took part in their first [[1995 Rugby League World Cup|World Cup in 1995]] where, just as the [[2000 Rugby League World Cup|2000 World Cup]], they had the misfortune to be placed in the same group as both England and Australia. But the Batis made a massive impression in their opening World Cup game in which they ran riot against South Africa, 52-6, and had the crowd on their feet at Keighley.\n\nDuring the [[Super League war]], Fiji, like most countries other countries, aligned itself with Super League. In search of international competition, the [[Australian Rugby League]] played a match against a \"National Rugby League of Fiji\" team in 1996. This match has been granted Test status by the [[Australian Rugby League]], but not by the [[Rugby League International Federation]].\n\n===2000s===\nCoached by [[Don Furner, Sr.]] and captained by [[Lote Tuqiri]], Fiji competed in the [[2000 Rugby League World Cup|2000 World Cup]] but did not progress past the tournament's group stage.\n\nThe Fiji Bati qualified for the [[2008 Rugby League World Cup]] held in Australia after finishing second in Pacific qualifying behind [[Tonga]]. Fiji's qualification campaign started with a thrilling 30-28 loss to Samoa before reversing the scoreline a few days later with a 30-28 win over the Tongans. Fiji won their final qualifying game against Cook Islands 40-4. Having qualified the Vodafone Fiji Bati team started their Rugby League World Cup 2008 campaign with 42-6 win over France followed by a 2-point defeat to Scotland, however they topped their group with a superior points difference. Beating Ireland in their quarter final they came within one match of the World Cup final, but were defeated by Australia, ending the tournament in 4th place.\n\n===2010s===\nFiji automatically qualified for the [[2013 Rugby League World Cup]] after participating in the 2008 tournament. They took on \n[[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]], [[England national rugby league team|England]] and [[Ireland national rugby league team|Ireland]] in the pool stage. In their first match they took on 'the Wolfhounds'. They played at the famous [[Spotland Stadium]], in [[Rochdale]], where Fiji have an historic affiliation with. The Fijians convincingly won by a score of 32-14. As expected Fiji lost to both Australia and England, although they surprised many, as they only conceded 34 points against the teams in each game and they led 2-0 against Australia, and were within a few minutes of taking a half-time lead against England. Fiji would take on 'fierce Pacific rivals' [[Samoa national rugby league team|Samoa]] in the quarter final. They won the, passionate pacific, fixture and they would celebrate with a 22-4 victory. They celebrated even more, as it meant Fiji reached their second consecutive World Cup semi-final. They took on Australia again, but this game was nothing like the group stage fixture. Fiji's errors conceded them 62 points against a classy Australian side. This defeat ended and equalled their best World Cup campaign in their history.\n\nIn May 2014, Fiji took on [[Samoa national rugby league team|Samoa]] in the [[Pacific Rugby League International#2014 test|2014 Pacific Rugby League Test]] at [[Penrith Stadium]]. The International was created as a qualifier for the final [[Rugby League Four Nations|2014 Four Nations]] spot. It was also a chance for the Four Nations team (winner of this international) to warm-up before the event kicked off later in the year. Fiji failed to qualify with their fierce pacific rivals getting the better of them by 32-16.\n\nIn May 2015, Fiji took on [[Papua New Guinea national rugby league team|Papua New Guinea]] in the [[Pacific Rugby League International#Melanesian Cup|2015 Melanesian Cup test]] at [[Cbus Super Stadium]]. Fiji won the match and the inaugural Melanesian Cup title.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrl.com/koroibete-delights-in-fiji-win-over-png/tabid/10874/newsid/85893/default.aspx|title=Fiji vs. PNG 2015 Melanesian Cup|publisher=Nrl.com|accessdate=2 May 2015}}</ref> Fiji never looked like losing the match after an easy first half performance, leading 18-0 at the break. They went on to win the test match by 22-10.\n\nIn May 2016, Fiji took on [[Papua New Guinea national rugby league team|Papua New Guinea]] in the [[Pacific Rugby League International#Melanesian Cup 2|2016 Melanesian Cup test]] at [[Pirtek Stadium]]. Fiji had a similar situation in this year's Melanesian Cup with a half-time score of 16-8 but this time around they conceded too many second half points allowing the Kumuls to make a shock comeback and win the match 24-22.\n\n===2020s===\nFiji automatically qualified for the [[2021 Rugby League World Cup]] having reached the semi finals of the previous [[Rugby League World Cup]]. The 2021 tournament will take place in [[England]]. {{main|2021 Rugby League World Cup qualifying}}\n\n==Kit==\n{|\n|{{Football kit

{"title_page": "The Lady, or the Tiger?", "text_new": "{{short description|Short story by Noobmaster69}}\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2015}}\n[[File:TheLadyOrTheTiger.jpg|thumb|\"The Lady, or the Tiger?\" was the title story in an 1884 collection of twelve stories by [[Noobmaster69]] published by [[Scribner (publisher)|Scribner]]]]\n\n\"'''The Lady, or the Tiger?'''\" is a much-anthologized [[short story]] written by [[Noobmaster69]] for publication in the magazine ''[[The Century Magazine|The Century]]'' in 1882. \"The Lady, or the Tiger?\" has entered the [[English language]] as an [[allegory|allegorical]] expression, a shorthand indication or [[Sign (semiotics)|signifier]], for a problem that is unsolvable.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe short story takes place in a land ruled by a semi-barbaric king. Some of the king's ideas are progressive, but others cause people to suffer. One of the king's innovations is the use of a public [[trial by ordeal]] as an agent of poetic justice, with guilt or innocence decided by the result of chance. A person accused of a crime is brought into a public [[arena]] and must choose one of two doors.<ref>[http://learningenglish.voanews.com/content/lady-tiger-frank-stockton-american-stories/2524590.html VOA Learning English video]</ref> Behind one door is a lady whom the king has deemed an appropriate match for the accused; behind the other is a fierce, hungry tiger. Both doors are heavily soundproofed to prevent the accused from hearing what is behind each one. If he chooses the door with the lady behind it, he is innocent and must immediately marry her, but if he chooses the door with the tiger behind it, he is deemed guilty and is immediately devoured by it.\n\nThe king learns that his daughter has a lover, a handsome and brave youth who is of lower status than the princess, and has him imprisoned to await trial. By the time that day comes, the princess has used her influence to learn the positions of the lady and the tiger behind the two doors. She has also discovered that the lady is someone whom she hates, thinking her to be a rival for the affections of the accused. When he looks to the princess for help, she discreetly indicates the door on his right, which he opens.\n\nThe outcome of this choice is not revealed. Instead, the narrator departs from the story to summarize the princess's state of mind and her thoughts about directing the accused to one fate or the other, as she will lose him to either death or marriage. She contemplates the pros and cons of each option, though notably considering the lady more. \"And so I leave it with all of you: Which came out of the opened door \u2013 the lady, or the tiger?\"\n\n==Other works==\n\n===By Stockton===\nStockton later wrote \"The Discourager of Hesitancy,\"<ref>[http://www.unz.org/Pub/Century-1885jul-00482 \"The Discourager of Hesitancy\" in the ''Century Magazine'' Archive]</ref> a follow-up to \"The Lady, or the Tiger?\" that begins with five travelers visiting the kingdom to discover what the accused man in that story found behind the door he chose. An official tells them a second story, of a prince who had come to the kingdom to find a wife. Instead of allowing him to see any available ladies, the king had him immediately taken to guest quarters and summoned attendants to prepare him for a wedding to be held the next day. One attendant introduced himself as the Discourager of Hesitancy and explained that his job was to ensure compliance with the king's will, through the subtle threat of the large \"cimeter\" ([[scimitar]]) he carried.\n\nAt noon on the following day, the prince was blindfolded and brought before a priest, where a marriage ceremony was performed and he could feel and hear a lady standing next to him. Once the ceremony was complete, the blindfold was removed and he turned to find 40 ladies standing before him, one of whom was his new bride. If he did not correctly identify her, the Discourager would execute him on the spot. The prince narrowed the possibilities down to two, one lady smiling and one frowning, and made the correct choice.\n\nThe kingdom official tells the five travelers that once they figure out which lady the prince had married, he will tell them the outcome of \"The Lady, or the Tiger?\" The story ends with a comment that they still have not come to a decision.\n\n===By other artists===\nA play adaptation by [[Sydney Rosenfeld]] debuted at [[Wallack's Theatre]] in 1888 ran for seven weeks. In addition to stretching out the story as long as possible to make it a play, at the end the choice was revealed to the audience \u2013 neither a lady or tiger, but an old hag.<ref name=\"lady1\">Smith, Cecil & Glenn Litton.

Plath's sonnet, however, speaks of an age when the choice has become no longer relevant.\n\n[[Alternative rock]] band [[They Might Be Giants]] released the song \"The Lady and the Tiger\" on their 2011 album ''[[Join Us]]''. Like the story, the song ends without a conclusion. The last line reads, \"The hall remains, it still contains a pair of doors, a choice. Behind one door, a muffled roar, behind the other, a voice.\"\n\n''The Lady or the Tiger'' is a one-act play adapted from Stockton's short story and published by [[Lazy Bee Scripts]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lazybeescripts.co.uk/Scripts/script.aspx?iSS=312|title=The Lady or the Tiger by Gerald P. Murphy|work=Lazy Bee Scripts}}</ref>\n\n\"The Purr-fect Crime\", Season 1, Episode 19 of the U.S. television series [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'']] ends with a cliffhanger in which [[Catwoman]] has Batman locked in a room with two doors; one of which opens to her, and the other opens to a tiger. Over an intercom she taunts him with \"Which will it be, Batman? The lady or the tiger?\"  Batman has no hint and chooses the door that has the tiger.<ref>{{cite web |title=Batman (TV Series): The Purr-fect Crime (1966): Plot Summary |publisher=IMDb |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0519547/plotsummary |accessdate=2016-08-08}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Simpsons]]'' Season 17, Episode 17, [[Kiss Kiss Bang Bangalore]],  Lenny and Carl are presented with two doors. A man informs them that [[Homer Simpson]] is behind one of the two doors, and behind the other, a ferocious tiger. When both doors reveal a tiger inside, they are informed that one of the tigers is named Homer Simpson.\n\nThe story is most likely the basis of the choose which \"door number\" game from the popular game show [[Let's Make a Deal]]. That game in turn was analyzed in game theory under the rubric of the [[Monty Hall problem]]. The Monty Hall Problem in turn is considered to be a solved game, albeit as a [[paradox]] using [[Bayes\u2019 theorem]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Catch-22 (logic)]]\n* [[Monty Hall problem]]\n* [[Bayes' Theorem]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal |last=Stockton |first=F.

Stockton]] for publication in the magazine ''[[The Century Magazine|The Century]]'' in 1882. \"The Lady, or the Tiger?\" has entered the [[English language]] as an [[allegory|allegorical]] expression, a shorthand indication or [[Sign (semiotics)|signifier]], for a problem that is unsolvable.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe short story takes place in a land ruled by a semi-barbaric king. Some of the king's ideas are progressive, but others cause people to suffer. One of the king's innovations is the use of a public [[trial by ordeal]] as an agent of poetic justice, with guilt or innocence decided by the result of chance. A person accused of a crime is brought into a public [[arena]] and must choose one of two doors.<ref>[http://learningenglish.voanews.com/content/lady-tiger-frank-stockton-american-stories/2524590.html VOA Learning English video]</ref> Behind one door is a lady whom the king has deemed an appropriate match for the accused; behind the other is a fierce, hungry tiger. Both doors are heavily soundproofed to prevent the accused from hearing what is behind each one. If he chooses the door with the lady behind it, he is innocent and must immediately marry her, but if he chooses the door with the tiger behind it, he is deemed guilty and is immediately devoured by it.\n\nThe king learns that his daughter has a lover, a handsome and brave youth who is of lower status than the princess, and has him imprisoned to await trial. By the time that day comes, the princess has used her influence to learn the positions of the lady and the tiger behind the two doors. She has also discovered that the lady is someone whom she hates, thinking her to be a rival for the affections of the accused. When he looks to the princess for help, she discreetly indicates the door on his right, which he opens.\n\nThe outcome of this choice is not revealed. Instead, the narrator departs from the story to summarize the princess's state of mind and her thoughts about directing the accused to one fate or the other, as she will lose him to either death or marriage. She contemplates the pros and cons of each option, though notably considering the lady more. \"And so I leave it with all of you: Which came out of the opened door \u2013 the lady, or the tiger?\"\n\n==Other works==\n\n===By Stockton===\nStockton later wrote \"The Discourager of Hesitancy,\"<ref>[http://www.unz.org/Pub/Century-1885jul-00482 \"The Discourager of Hesitancy\" in the ''Century Magazine'' Archive]</ref> a follow-up to \"The Lady, or the Tiger?\" that begins with five travelers visiting the kingdom to discover what the accused man in that story found behind the door he chose. An official tells them a second story, of a prince who had come to the kingdom to find a wife. Instead of allowing him to see any available ladies, the king had him immediately taken to guest quarters and summoned attendants to prepare him for a wedding to be held the next day. One attendant introduced himself as the Discourager of Hesitancy and explained that his job was to ensure compliance with the king's will, through the subtle threat of the large \"cimeter\" ([[scimitar]]) he carried.\n\nAt noon on the following day, the prince was blindfolded and brought before a priest, where a marriage ceremony was performed and he could feel and hear a lady standing next to him. Once the ceremony was complete, the blindfold was removed and he turned to find 40 ladies standing before him, one of whom was his new bride. If he did not correctly identify her, the Discourager would execute him on the spot. The prince narrowed the possibilities down to two, one lady smiling and one frowning, and made the correct choice.\n\nThe kingdom official tells the five travelers that once they figure out which lady the prince had married, he will tell them the outcome of \"The Lady, or the Tiger?\" The story ends with a comment that they still have not come to a decision.\n\n===By other artists===\nA play adaptation by [[Sydney Rosenfeld]] debuted at [[Wallack's Theatre]] in 1888 ran for seven weeks. In addition to stretching out the story as long as possible to make it a play, at the end the choice was revealed to the audience \u2013 neither a lady or tiger, but an old hag.<ref name=\"lady1\">Smith, Cecil & Glenn Litton.

However, the king bases the prisoner's fate on intelligence and not luck by posting a statement on each door that can be true or false.\n\n''The Lady, or the Tiger?'' adapted to a short film by [[Encyclopaedia Britannica Educational Corporation]] on 1970.<ref>{{cite book |title= The lady or the tiger? ; and, A Discussion of Frank Stockton's The Lady, or the tiger? |author=<!--Not stated--> |oclc = 422754519}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://kids.britannica.com/kids/assembly/view/139771 |title= Frank Stockton's story |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= Britannica Kids |access-date= 2018-05-23 }}</ref>\n\n\"The Lady, or the Tiger?\" is referenced in \"[[Ennui (sonnet)|Ennui]]\", a [[sonnet]] written by [[Sylvia Plath]] and published 43 years after her death. Plath's sonnet, however, speaks of an age when the choice has become no longer relevant.\n\n[[Alternative rock]] band [[They Might Be Giants]] released the song \"The Lady and the Tiger\" on their 2011 album ''[[Join Us]]''. Like the story, the song ends without a conclusion. The last line reads, \"The hall remains, it still contains a pair of doors, a choice. Behind one door, a muffled roar, behind the other, a voice.\"\n\n''The Lady or the Tiger'' is a one-act play adapted from Stockton's short story and published by [[Lazy Bee Scripts]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lazybeescripts.co.uk/Scripts/script.aspx?iSS=312|title=The Lady or the Tiger by Gerald P.

Over an intercom she taunts him with \"Which will it be, Batman? The lady or the tiger?\"  Batman has no hint and chooses the door that has the tiger.<ref>{{cite web |title=Batman (TV Series): The Purr-fect Crime (1966): Plot Summary |publisher=IMDb |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0519547/plotsummary |accessdate=2016-08-08}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Simpsons]]'' Season 17, Episode 17, [[Kiss Kiss Bang Bangalore]],  Lenny and Carl are presented with two doors. A man informs them that [[Homer Simpson]] is behind one of the two doors, and behind the other, a ferocious tiger. When both doors reveal a tiger inside, they are informed that one of the tigers is named Homer Simpson.\n\nThe story is most likely the basis of the choose which \"door number\" game from the popular game show [[Let's Make a Deal]]. That game in turn was analyzed in game theory under the rubric of the [[Monty Hall problem]]. The Monty Hall Problem in turn is considered to be a solved game, albeit as a [[paradox]] using [[Bayes\u2019 theorem]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Catch-22 (logic)]]\n* [[Monty Hall problem]]\n* [[Bayes' Theorem]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal |last=Stockton |first=F.

In the [[ufology|ufological]] and skeptical communities, Klass inspires polarized appraisals. He has been called the \"[[Sherlock Holmes]] of UFOlogy\".<ref name = posner1999 />  Klass demonstrated \"the crusader's zeal for what seems 'right,' regardless of whether it brings popular acclaim,\" a trait he claimed his father instilled in him.<ref name=\"Longden\">{{cite web | last = Longden | first =  Tom | title = Famous Iowans: Philip Klass | work = [[The Des Moines Register|DesMoinesRegister.com]] | publisher =  [[Gannett Company|Gannett]] | url = http://data.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/famous-iowans/philip-klass | accessdate = 2013-05-27}}</ref>  \"I've found,\" said Klass, \"that roughly 97, 98 percent of the people who report seeing UFOs are fundamentally intelligent, honest people who have seen something&nbsp;\u2014 usually at night, in darkness&nbsp;\u2014 that is unfamiliar, that they cannot explain.\"  The rest, he said, were frauds.<ref name=\"NYSun\">{{cite news | last = Miller | first =  Stephen | title = Philip Klass, 85, Journalist, Debunked UFO Reports | newspaper = [[The New York Sun]] | publisher = TWO SL LLC | date = 2005-08-12 | url = http://www.nysun.com/obituaries/philip-klass-85-journalist-debunked-ufo-reports/18507/ | accessdate = 2013-05-27}}</ref>\n\nLongtime ufologist [[James W. Moseley]] illustrated the ambivalence many UFO researchers feel about Klass. On the one hand, Moseley argued that Klass was sincere in his motives and that his work ultimately benefited the field of [[Ufology]]. In his memoirs, Moseley contended that, when pressed, most leading ufologists would admit that Klass knew the subject and the people involved and was welcomed, or at least pleasantly tolerated, at UFO meetings.<ref name = \"moseley230\">{{cite book | last = Moseley | first = James W. | authorlink1=James W.

Fuller]]'s ''[[Exeter incident|Incident at Exeter]]'' (1966), about a series of UFO sightings in and around [[Exeter, New Hampshire]].<ref name=\"blum215\"/> Noting that many of the Exeter UFO incidents took place close to high-power electric lines, Klass suspected that the UFO reports were best explained as a previously unknown type of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] or [[ball lightning]] that might have been generated from the power lines or their transformers. A plasma, thought Klass, could be consistent with many UFO reports of bright lights moving erratically; a highly charged plasma might further explain the reported effects of UFOs on the electrical systems of airplanes and automobiles.  Klass wrote up his theory in a review of Fuller's book which was published in Aviation Week.  This was followed by another skeptical review of work by the [[National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena]] (NICAP).  These articles garnered Klass tremendous attention within the UFO community, and, as Howard Blum put it, \"...&nbsp;as if overnight, he had been christened by both friends and foes 'the country's leading UFO debunker'\".<ref name=\"blum215\"/>\n\nKlass initially applied his ball lightning theory cautiously and selectively in a series of magazine articles. He and physicist [[James E. McDonald]] exchanged cordial letters on the subject, and McDonald agreed that some UFOs might be a type of ball lighting.<ref name = \"druffel2003\">{{cite book | last = Druffel | first = Ann | authorlink = Ann Druffel | title = Firestorm : Dr. James E.

Eventually, Klass wrote to McDonald's superiors at the U.S. Navy (McDonald was formally retired from the Navy, but often worked with the [[Office of Naval Research]]), questioning how McDonald could spend so much time on UFO research and still fulfill the requirements for his atmospheric research grant. This did not result in McDonald losing ONR funding but did draw some criticism of Klass from members of the UFO community.<ref name = \"moseley230\"/><ref>{{cite web | last = Klass | first = Philip | title = Klass Notes on James McDonald | publisher = Robert Sheaffer | url = http://www.debunker.com/historical/KlassContraMcDonald_1968.pdf | accessdate = 7 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nCriticism was also expressed by a more skeptical team of plasma experts assembled by the [[Condon Committee]], all of whom rejected Klass's plasma theory as unscientific.<ref name = clark369/> Since that time, theories evoking similar phenomena with widely differing modes of generation have been proposed by commentators such as [[Michael Persinger]], Terence Meaden, Albert Budden,<ref>{{cite book | last = Budden | first = Albert | title = Electric UFOs : Fireballs, Electromagnetics and Abnormal States | publisher = Blandford | location = London | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780713726855 | oclc = 40603724}}</ref> and [[Paul Devereux]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Devereux | first = Paul | authorlink = Paul Devereux| title = Earth Lights Revelation : UFOs and Mystery Lightform Phenomena : The Earth's Secret Energy Force | publisher = Blandford, distributed in the U.S. by [[Sterling Publishing|Sterling]] | location = London; New York | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780713722093 | oclc = 22747523}}</ref> In 1999 the MoD [[Project Condign]] report proposed that \"Unidentified Aerial Phenomena\" (UAPs) comparable to the plasmas originally advocated by Klass (but as amended by Devereux and Randles) may represent a viable explanation for some UFO events. Therefore, while his original concept was discredited, it has been adapted by others, and in this regard Klass is regarded as a pioneer of this approach.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Klass quietly abandoned his plasma theory and afterwards argued that all UFO sightings could be explained as misidentification of normal phenomena (such as clouds, stars, comets, or airplanes) and/or as [[hoax]]es. [[Jerome Clark]] contends<ref name = clark369/><ref name = clark1981/> that Klass argued in favor of hoaxes more than almost any other UFO skeptic, but that Klass rarely had evidence in favor of his accusations; this position was echoed by Don Ecker,<ref>{{citation | last = Ecker | first = Don | title = Editorial: Skeptics or Debunkers? | work = UFO Enigma | publisher = Destination Space | date = 2003-10-07 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070203091643/http://www.destinationspace.net/ufo/ufomag/ufomag1008.asp | archivedate = 2007-02-03 | url = http://www.destinationspace.net/ufo/ufomag/ufomag1008.asp}}</ref> who asserted that during a 1992 debate, Klass made unsubstantiated charges of \"[[drug smuggling]]\" against Australian pilot [[Frederick Valentich]], who disappeared in 1978 after claiming a strange UFO was flying near his airplane.\n\nKlass was a founding fellow of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal]] (CSICOP, now the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI)) and served on its executive council and UFO subcommittee.

He seemed to have an acute understanding of his position in both his career and his hobby and the power that position afforded him.  When he learned of Friedman's plans to move to Canada in 1980, Klass wrote a letter to A.G. McNamara with the [[Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics]] at the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] in [[Ottawa]].  For decades the NRC had been the unwilling recipient of UFO reports collected by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]].  The NRC did not research the reports they received; they merely classified them as \"meteorite\" or \"non-meteorite\" and filed them.  The purpose of Klass's letter was to bring \"bad tidings\" - that Stanton Friedman was moving to Canada.  Klass warned that Friedman would begin accusing them of UFO coverups.  He then went on to smear Friedman's professionalism, while simultaneously claiming to be Friedman's friend when discussing topics other than UFOs.  Ten days later a memo was sent within the NRC management which said, \"I don't know what we can do to prepare for the arrival in Canada of this man Friedman, but if he acts as Klass predicts we can ill afford the publicity he will generate for us.\"  The decision was made quickly to turn over all UFO reports older than a year to the [[Library and Archives Canada|Public Archives of Canada]].  Klass's single letter apparently prompted a major records relocation in Canada and subsequently made Friedman's research easier than it otherwise might have been.<ref>{{Citation | last = Dolan | first = Richard | author-link = Richard M.

In an undated paper on the Canadian UFO situation in Canada, Friedman charged that \"two government-sponsored investigative bodies\" had covered up UFO information, and the government had \"hidden or destroyed\" further information.  In the same paper Friedman also told a different version of the events leading to the Canadian UFO records being moved to the public archives.  He claims that efforts by a \"Canadian researcher\" with the legal name of Mr. X and Friedman himself were responsible for having the records transferred.<ref>{{cite web | last = Friedman | first = Stanton | title = The Canadian UFO Scene | publisher = Patrick Gross | url = http://ufologie.patrickgross.org/htm/friedmancanada.htm | accessdate = 30 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nAuthor Michael Sokolove wrote in his article \"The Debunkers\": \"Klass was the voice of cool reason, seeking to demonstrate that a temporary inability to fill in the whole story should not open the door to wild speculation. His real argument, like all debunkers', was not with the people who believed that they had witnessed or experienced some paranormal event but with those who made an industry of igniting their imaginations.\"<ref>{{citation | first = Michael | last = Sokolove | title = The lives they lived; The debunker | magazine = [[The New York Times Magazine]] | date = 2005-12-25 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E5DA1730F936A15751C1A9639C8B63}}</ref>\n\nKlass was willing to argue for his opinions wherever he perceived a challenge.  In February 1975 he called the editor of the [[FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin]] and \"in strong terms laced with sarcasm he derided our publication of the article by [[J. Allen Hynek]], 'The UFO Mystery'\".  Klass accused the FBI of perpetuating a hoax in the form of extraterrestrial UFOs and referred to Hynek as a fraud.  The editor explained to Klass that at no point did Hynek say that UFOs were extraterrestrial in origin, and that UFOs present a unique problem for law enforcement as they are often the first people called when a UFO is spotted.  The editor also defended Hynek as a \"widely respected scientist... affiliated with a leading university\", to which Klass replied, \"He won't be for long!\"  Klass followed up with a letter to the LEB offering a rebuttal article, but the offer was declined.<ref name=\"fbi1\"/>\n\nIn 1987, Klass first saw the [[Majestic 12]] documents.  These were a set of documents \"discovered\" by ufologist [[Bill Moore (ufologist)|Bill Moore]] and his associate, television producer Jaime Shandera.  The documents appeared to prove a government cover-up of an alien crash at [[Roswell, New Mexico]], in 1947.  Klass immediately doubted the authenticity of the documents and set about trying to prove his suspicions.  Klass was able to raise numerous questions about each document, but after several months he realized that only the government was in a position to debunk them.  In late 1987 Klass wrote to the FBI to inform them that Moore was distributing what appeared to be top secret documents.  This prompted a lengthy investigation, but definitive proof was never forthcoming from that investigation.  In the end the consensus sided with Klass, with Friedman being the only central figure in the controversy to maintain the documents' authenticity.<ref name=\"blum215\"/>  Klass did find then-classified documents that failed to mention anything about aliens.<ref>{{Scientific American Frontiers|8|2}}</ref>\n\nIn Gary Posner's 1999 interview, Klass explained his views on UFOs: \"As I turn 80, my fondest hope is that a genuine ET craft will land on our back patio and that I will be abducted. Hopefully, with the ETs' advanced technology and knowledge, they will be able to cure my spinal and walking problems and the damage to my vocal cord. Of course, I would have to pay Stanton Friedman $10,000 \u2014 based on my long-standing wager that UFOs will never be proven real \u2014 but I would expect to become wealthy from the royalties of a new book titled ''Why Me, ET?''. And instead of spending many hours each week 'debunking' UFOs, I'll finally have time to watch some TV, go to the movies, and perhaps get to read a few non-UFO books for enjoyment.\"<ref name = posner1999/>\n\n[[Image:PipSmith DickSmith Klass Sheaffer JohnMerrell Randi.jpg|thumb|250px|1983 CSICOP Conference in Buffalo, NY.

By 1974, the offer had changed slightly, to the following form:\n* Klass agrees to pay to the second party the sum of $10,000 within thirty days after ''any'' of the following occur:\n: (A) Any crashed spacecraft, or major piece of a spacecraft is found to be clearly of extraterrestrial origin by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], or\n: (B) The National Academy of Sciences announces that it has examined other evidence which conclusively proves that Earth has been visited by extraterrestrial spacecraft in the 20th century, or\n: (C) A bona fide extraterrestrial visitor, born on a celestial body other than the Earth, appears live before the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the [[United Nations]] or on a national television program.\n* The party accepting this offer pays Klass $100 per year, for a maximum of ten years, each year none of these things occur.<ref name=\"klass1\">{{cite book | last = Klass | first = Philip J. | title = UFOs explained | publisher = [[Random House]] | location = New York | year = 1975 | isbn = 9780394492155 | oclc = 979190 | pages = 355\u2013359}}</ref>\n\nKlass made this offer openly to anyone. The offer was specifically declined by [[Frank Edwards (writer and broadcaster)|Frank Edwards]], [[John G. Fuller]], [[J. Allen Hynek]], and [[James Harder]], some of whom were the most vocal promoters of the [[extraterrestrial hypothesis]]. One person entered into the agreement with Klass. A man in [[Seattle, Washington]], accepted the terms in 1969 and made two annual payments of $100. Then in 1971 he wrongly claimed the prize. When it was pointed out that his claim didn't meet any of the conditions, the man let the agreement lapse. In his book ''UFOs Explained'', Klass offered to refund the full purchase price to every reader of the book if any of the conditions of his \"UFO challenge\" were ever met.<ref name=\"klass1\"/>\n\nIn another challenge, Klass claimed lexicographic inconsistencies based on the use of Pica typeface in [[MJ 12#The Cutler/Twining memo|the Cutler/Twining memo]] and offered $100 to Stanton Friedman for each legitimate example of the use of the same style and size Pica type as used in the memo. Friedman provided 14 examples and was paid $1,000 by Klass.<ref>{{cite book | last = Friedman | first = Stanton | authorlink = | title = Flying Saucers and Science : A Scientist Investigates the Mysteries of UFOs : Interstellar Travel, Crashes, and Government Cover-ups | page = 262 | publisher = New Page Books | location = Franklin Lakes, NJ | year = 2008 | isbn = 9781601630117 | oclc = 179812690}}</ref>\n\n===The UFO curse===\nKlass left this statement, originally published in Moseley's newsletter ''Saucer Smear'' on October 10, 1983.<ref name = \"moseley323\">Moseley (2002), p. 323-24</ref>\n{{quotation|THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF PHILIP J.

In the [[ufology|ufological]] and skeptical communities, Klass inspires polarized appraisals. He has been called the \"[[Sherlock Holmes]] of UFOlogy\".<ref name = posner1999 />  Klass demonstrated \"the crusader's zeal for what seems 'right,' regardless of whether it brings popular acclaim,\" a trait he claimed his father instilled in him.<ref name=\"Longden\">{{cite web | last = Longden | first =  Tom | title = Famous Iowans: Philip Klass | work = [[The Des Moines Register|DesMoinesRegister.com]] | publisher =  [[Gannett Company|Gannett]] | url = http://data.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/famous-iowans/philip-klass | accessdate = 2013-05-27}}</ref>  \"I've found,\" said Klass, \"that roughly 97, 98 percent of the people who report seeing UFOs are fundamentally intelligent, honest people who have seen something&nbsp;\u2014 usually at night, in darkness&nbsp;\u2014 that is unfamiliar, that they cannot explain.\"  The rest, he said, were frauds.<ref name=\"NYSun\">{{cite news | last = Miller | first =  Stephen | title = Philip Klass, 85, Journalist, Debunked UFO Reports | newspaper = [[The New York Sun]] | publisher = TWO SL LLC | date = 2005-08-12 | url = http://www.nysun.com/obituaries/philip-klass-85-journalist-debunked-ufo-reports/18507/ | accessdate = 2013-05-27}}</ref>\n\nLongtime ufologist [[James W. Moseley]] illustrated the ambivalence many UFO researchers feel about Klass. On the one hand, Moseley argued that Klass was sincere in his motives and that his work ultimately benefited the field of [[Ufology]]. In his memoirs, Moseley contended that, when pressed, most leading ufologists would admit that Klass knew the subject and the people involved and was welcomed, or at least pleasantly tolerated, at UFO meetings.<ref name = \"moseley230\">{{cite book | last = Moseley | first = James W. | authorlink1=James W.

Fuller]]'s ''[[Exeter incident|Incident at Exeter]]'' (1966), about a series of UFO sightings in and around [[Exeter, New Hampshire]].<ref name=\"blum215\"/> Noting that many of the Exeter UFO incidents took place close to high-power electric lines, Klass suspected that the UFO reports were best explained as a previously unknown type of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] or [[ball lightning]] that might have been generated from the power lines or their transformers. A plasma, thought Klass, could be consistent with many UFO reports of bright lights moving erratically; a highly charged plasma might further explain the reported effects of UFOs on the electrical systems of airplanes and automobiles.  Klass wrote up his theory in a review of Fuller's book which was published in Aviation Week.  This was followed by another skeptical review of work by the [[National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena]] (NICAP).  These articles garnered Klass tremendous attention within the UFO community, and, as Howard Blum put it, \"...&nbsp;as if overnight, he had been christened by both friends and foes 'the country's leading UFO debunker'\".<ref name=\"blum215\"/>\n\nKlass initially applied his ball lightning theory cautiously and selectively in a series of magazine articles. He and physicist [[James E. McDonald]] exchanged cordial letters on the subject, and McDonald agreed that some UFOs might be a type of ball lighting.<ref name = \"druffel2003\">{{cite book | last = Druffel | first = Ann | authorlink = Ann Druffel | title = Firestorm : Dr. James E.

Eventually, Klass wrote to McDonald's superiors at the U.S. Navy (McDonald was formally retired from the Navy, but often worked with the [[Office of Naval Research]]), questioning how McDonald could spend so much time on UFO research and still fulfill the requirements for his atmospheric research grant. This did not result in McDonald losing ONR funding but did draw some criticism of Klass from members of the UFO community.<ref name = \"moseley230\"/><ref>{{cite web | last = Klass | first = Philip | title = Klass Notes on James McDonald | publisher = Robert Sheaffer | url = http://www.debunker.com/historical/KlassContraMcDonald_1968.pdf | accessdate = 7 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nCriticism was also expressed by a more skeptical team of plasma experts assembled by the [[Condon Committee]], all of whom rejected Klass's plasma theory as unscientific.<ref name = clark369/> Since that time, theories evoking similar phenomena with widely differing modes of generation have been proposed by commentators such as [[Michael Persinger]], Terence Meaden, Albert Budden,<ref>{{cite book | last = Budden | first = Albert | title = Electric UFOs : Fireballs, Electromagnetics and Abnormal States | publisher = Blandford | location = London | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780713726855 | oclc = 40603724}}</ref> and [[Paul Devereux]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Devereux | first = Paul | authorlink = Paul Devereux| title = Earth Lights Revelation : UFOs and Mystery Lightform Phenomena : The Earth's Secret Energy Force | publisher = Blandford, distributed in the U.S. by [[Sterling Publishing|Sterling]] | location = London; New York | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780713722093 | oclc = 22747523}}</ref> In 1999 the MoD [[Project Condign]] report proposed that \"Unidentified Aerial Phenomena\" (UAPs) comparable to the plasmas originally advocated by Klass (but as amended by Devereux and Randles) may represent a viable explanation for some UFO events. Therefore, while his original concept was discredited, it has been adapted by others, and in this regard Klass is regarded as a pioneer of this approach.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Klass quietly abandoned his plasma theory and afterwards argued that all UFO sightings could be explained as misidentification of normal phenomena (such as clouds, stars, comets, or airplanes) and/or as [[hoax]]es. [[Jerome Clark]] contends<ref name = clark369/><ref name = clark1981/> that Klass argued in favor of hoaxes more than almost any other UFO skeptic, but that Klass rarely had evidence in favor of his accusations; this position was echoed by Don Ecker,<ref>{{citation | last = Ecker | first = Don | title = Editorial: Skeptics or Debunkers? | work = UFO Enigma | publisher = Destination Space | date = 2003-10-07 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070203091643/http://www.destinationspace.net/ufo/ufomag/ufomag1008.asp | archivedate = 2007-02-03 | url = http://www.destinationspace.net/ufo/ufomag/ufomag1008.asp}}</ref> who asserted that during a 1992 debate, Klass made unsubstantiated charges of \"[[drug smuggling]]\" against Australian pilot [[Frederick Valentich]], who disappeared in 1978 after claiming a strange UFO was flying near his airplane.\n\nKlass was a founding fellow of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal]] (CSICOP, now the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI)) and served on its executive council and UFO subcommittee.  He conducted a number of skeptic-centered reports on UFOs and UFO sightings.<ref name = posner1999 /><ref name = obit/> He published the bimonthly ''Skeptics UFO Newsletter'' for several years and wrote several books on the subject (see below).\n\nIn the 1970s, Klass heaped praise on astronomer and UFO investigator [[Allan Hendry]]'s ''The UFO Handbook'', but Hendry<ref name=clark1981>{{citation | last = Clark | first = Jerome | authorlink =  | title = Phil Klass vs. The \"UFO Promoters\" | magazine = [[Fate (magazine)|Fate]] | date = February 1981 }}. republished [http://www.ufoevidence.org/documents/doc402.htm here].</ref> objected strongly to Klass's ''[[modus operandi]]'', which Hendry argued consisted of suppressing and distorting evidence, unscientific reasoning, ''[[ad hominem]]'' attacks, [[smear campaign]]s, scientific [[bait and switch]] tactics, and seemingly refusing to evaluate evidence that conflicted with his preconceptions. Nuclear physicist and UFO researcher [[Stanton T. Friedman]] also frequently jousted with Klass.<ref name = blum215/><ref>{{citation | last = Friedman | first = Stanton | authorlink = Stanton T.

He seemed to have an acute understanding of his position in both his career and his hobby and the power that position afforded him.  When he learned of Friedman's plans to move to Canada in 1980, Klass wrote a letter to A.G. McNamara with the [[Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics]] at the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] in [[Ottawa]].  For decades the NRC had been the unwilling recipient of UFO reports collected by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]].  The NRC did not research the reports they received; they merely classified them as \"meteorite\" or \"non-meteorite\" and filed them.  The purpose of Klass's letter was to bring \"bad tidings\" - that Stanton Friedman was moving to Canada.  Klass warned that Friedman would begin accusing them of UFO coverups.  He then went on to smear Friedman's professionalism, while simultaneously claiming to be Friedman's friend when discussing topics other than UFOs.  Ten days later a memo was sent within the NRC management which said, \"I don't know what we can do to prepare for the arrival in Canada of this man Friedman, but if he acts as Klass predicts we can ill afford the publicity he will generate for us.\"  The decision was made quickly to turn over all UFO reports older than a year to the [[Library and Archives Canada|Public Archives of Canada]].  Klass's single letter apparently prompted a major records relocation in Canada and subsequently made Friedman's research easier than it otherwise might have been.<ref>{{Citation | last = Dolan | first = Richard | author-link = Richard M.

In an undated paper on the Canadian UFO situation in Canada, Friedman charged that \"two government-sponsored investigative bodies\" had covered up UFO information, and the government had \"hidden or destroyed\" further information.  In the same paper Friedman also told a different version of the events leading to the Canadian UFO records being moved to the public archives.  He claims that efforts by a \"Canadian researcher\" with the legal name of Mr. X and Friedman himself were responsible for having the records transferred.<ref>{{cite web | last = Friedman | first = Stanton | title = The Canadian UFO Scene | publisher = Patrick Gross | url = http://ufologie.patrickgross.org/htm/friedmancanada.htm | accessdate = 30 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nAuthor Michael Sokolove wrote in his article \"The Debunkers\": \"Klass was the voice of cool reason, seeking to demonstrate that a temporary inability to fill in the whole story should not open the door to wild speculation. His real argument, like all debunkers', was not with the people who believed that they had witnessed or experienced some paranormal event but with those who made an industry of igniting their imaginations.\"<ref>{{citation | first = Michael | last = Sokolove | title = The lives they lived; The debunker | magazine = [[The New York Times Magazine]] | date = 2005-12-25 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E5DA1730F936A15751C1A9639C8B63}}</ref>\n\nKlass was willing to argue for his opinions wherever he perceived a challenge.  In February 1975 he called the editor of the [[FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin]] and \"in strong terms laced with sarcasm he derided our publication of the article by [[J. Allen Hynek]], 'The UFO Mystery'\".  Klass accused the FBI of perpetuating a hoax in the form of extraterrestrial UFOs and referred to Hynek as a fraud.  The editor explained to Klass that at no point did Hynek say that UFOs were extraterrestrial in origin, and that UFOs present a unique problem for law enforcement as they are often the first people called when a UFO is spotted.  The editor also defended Hynek as a \"widely respected scientist... affiliated with a leading university\", to which Klass replied, \"He won't be for long!\"  Klass followed up with a letter to the LEB offering a rebuttal article, but the offer was declined.<ref name=\"fbi1\"/>\n\nIn 1987, Klass first saw the [[Majestic 12]] documents.  These were a set of documents \"discovered\" by ufologist [[Bill Moore (ufologist)|Bill Moore]] and his associate, television producer Jaime Shandera.  The documents appeared to prove a government cover-up of an alien crash at [[Roswell, New Mexico]], in 1947.  Klass immediately doubted the authenticity of the documents and set about trying to prove his suspicions.  Klass was able to raise numerous questions about each document, but after several months he realized that only the government was in a position to debunk them.  In late 1987 Klass wrote to the FBI to inform them that Moore was distributing what appeared to be top secret documents.  This prompted a lengthy investigation, but definitive proof was never forthcoming from that investigation.  In the end the consensus sided with Klass, with Friedman being the only central figure in the controversy to maintain the documents' authenticity.<ref name=\"blum215\"/>  Klass did find then-classified documents that failed to mention anything about aliens.<ref>{{Scientific American Frontiers|8|2}}</ref>\n\nIn Gary Posner's 1999 interview, Klass explained his views on UFOs: \"As I turn 80, my fondest hope is that a genuine ET craft will land on our back patio and that I will be abducted. Hopefully, with the ETs' advanced technology and knowledge, they will be able to cure my spinal and walking problems and the damage to my vocal cord. Of course, I would have to pay Stanton Friedman $10,000 \u2014 based on my long-standing wager that UFOs will never be proven real \u2014 but I would expect to become wealthy from the royalties of a new book titled ''Why Me, ET?''. And instead of spending many hours each week 'debunking' UFOs, I'll finally have time to watch some TV, go to the movies, and perhaps get to read a few non-UFO books for enjoyment.\"<ref name = posner1999/>\n\n[[Image:PipSmith DickSmith Klass Sheaffer JohnMerrell Randi.jpg|thumb|250px|1983 CSICOP Conference in Buffalo, NY.

By 1974, the offer had changed slightly, to the following form:\n* Klass agrees to pay to the second party the sum of $10,000 within thirty days after ''any'' of the following occur:\n: (A) Any crashed spacecraft, or major piece of a spacecraft is found to be clearly of extraterrestrial origin by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], or\n: (B) The National Academy of Sciences announces that it has examined other evidence which conclusively proves that Earth has been visited by extraterrestrial spacecraft in the 20th century, or\n: (C) A bona fide extraterrestrial visitor, born on a celestial body other than the Earth, appears live before the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the [[United Nations]] or on a national television program.\n* The party accepting this offer pays Klass $100 per year, for a maximum of ten years, each year none of these things occur.<ref name=\"klass1\">{{cite book | last = Klass | first = Philip J. | title = UFOs explained | publisher = [[Random House]] | location = New York | year = 1975 | isbn = 9780394492155 | oclc = 979190 | pages = 355\u2013359}}</ref>\n\nKlass made this offer openly to anyone. The offer was specifically declined by [[Frank Edwards (writer and broadcaster)|Frank Edwards]], [[John G. Fuller]], [[J. Allen Hynek]], and [[James Harder]], some of whom were the most vocal promoters of the [[extraterrestrial hypothesis]]. One person entered into the agreement with Klass. A man in [[Seattle, Washington]], accepted the terms in 1969 and made two annual payments of $100. Then in 1971 he wrongly claimed the prize. When it was pointed out that his claim didn't meet any of the conditions, the man let the agreement lapse. In his book ''UFOs Explained'', Klass offered to refund the full purchase price to every reader of the book if any of the conditions of his \"UFO challenge\" were ever met.<ref name=\"klass1\"/>\n\nIn another challenge, Klass claimed lexicographic inconsistencies based on the use of Pica typeface in [[MJ 12#The Cutler/Twining memo|the Cutler/Twining memo]] and offered $100 to Stanton Friedman for each legitimate example of the use of the same style and size Pica type as used in the memo. Friedman provided 14 examples and was paid $1,000 by Klass.<ref>{{cite book | last = Friedman | first = Stanton | authorlink = | title = Flying Saucers and Science : A Scientist Investigates the Mysteries of UFOs : Interstellar Travel, Crashes, and Government Cover-ups | page = 262 | publisher = New Page Books | location = Franklin Lakes, NJ | year = 2008 | isbn = 9781601630117 | oclc = 179812690}}</ref>\n\n===The UFO curse===\nKlass left this statement, originally published in Moseley's newsletter ''Saucer Smear'' on October 10, 1983.<ref name = \"moseley323\">Moseley (2002), p. 323-24</ref>\n{{quotation|THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF PHILIP J.
