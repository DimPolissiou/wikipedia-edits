It is part of a public, coeducational school (preprimary-12), [[National Experimental High School]] (NEHS). Founded in August 1983, the school was proposed by the founder of the Science Park [[Kwoh-Ting Li]] and administered by Ministry of Education, [[National Science Council]] and administration of the Park. Originally IBSH was formed to attract high-tech talent and technologies to move to Hsinchu Science park, but the Ministry of Education won't allow the creation of a school based solely for oversea workers. Thus, NEHS was created to satisfy the conditions set by the Ministry of Education. IBSH only admits children of employees of private enterprises in the Park, government organizations, [[Industrial Technology Research Institute]], [[National Chiao Tung University]] and [[National Tsing Hua University]].\n\nThe Bilingual Department of NEHS changed its name before the 2008-2009 school year after a visit from the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]] in the spring of 2008. In summer 2011, IBSH was granted WASC accreditation. It serves students in the English-speaking community who seek an American college-preparatory education or plan to transfer into the local school system.\n\n==Student body==\nThe Bilingual Department had at least 700 students from Grades 1-12 enrolled for the 2008-2009 school year. Over half of these students were U.S. citizens. Students come from business, professional, government, and diplomatic families. 41% of IBSH parents have a PhD.\n\nEach grade is split up into two classes, A and B, each with its own homeroom teacher. 39 of the 61 certified full-time teachers have master's degrees and two have PhDs. 38 of the teachers are East Asian, 18 are American, and 5 are Canadian. The faculty-to-student ratio is 1:20.\n\n==Academics==\nStudents are put through a challenging curriculum that follows an American high school format, albeit with mandatory Chinese classes. Many go on to attend prestigious institutions such as [[Rice University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Harvard University]], [[Columbia University]], [[Yale University]], [[Princeton University]], [[Duke University]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Northwestern University]], and [[University of Chicago]]. Honor courses offered include Math (9-12), English (9-12), World History (10), and many [[Advanced Placement]] courses. AP courses offered at IBSH include Studio Art, Biology, Chemistry, Calculus AB/BC, Chinese Language and Culture, Computer Science, English Literature and Composition, Environmental Science, European History, Micro/Macroeconomics, Physics 1, Physics C, Psychology, Statistics, US History, US Government and Politics, and European History. In May 2008, 195 students took a total of 325 AP tests. 41.5% scored a 5, 18.8% a 4, 16.9% a 3, 8.9% a 2, and 13.8% a 1, with an average score of 3.625.\n\nThe class of 2009 had 51 students. Up to September 2008, these students scored an average of 639V, 699M, and 654W (combined average of 1992) on the [[SAT]], well above the U.S. national average. Six members of the class of 2018 have been named Finalists in the [[National Merit Scholarship Program]].\n\n==Extracurriculars==\nWhile students must keep up with the rigorous course load, there are also many active clubs, such as A Cappella, Student Government (BDSC), Circuit Breaking Crew ([[breakdancing]]), ShutterLensLight (photography), D.Co (Dance Company), Debate, Drama Club, Fellowship, Humane Society, GIN, InterAct, [[Key Club]], Panthers Newspaper Club, CinemaScope (film club), and [[Yearbook]]. Many students are involved with [[Model United Nations]], and the school hosts Taiwan's only THIMUN affiliated conference [[HSINMUN]] <ref>{{cite web |title=HSINMUN XIV |url=https://www.hsinmunibsh.org |website=HSINMUN IBSH |publisher=HSINMUN Secretariat}}</ref>. Students also attend [[TAIMUN]], PASMUN, TASMUN, HIMUN, NEMUN, STMUN, and [[THIMUN-Singapore]] conferences.\n\nThere are athletic teams grades 7-12 students may join. These teams play year-round and hold practices after school. Current teams include Badminton Team, [[Basketball]] team (Boys/Girls), Boys soccer team, , the NEHS [[Cheerleading]] squad (co-ed), and most importantly, the NEHS Baseball Team. These teams have won games and tournaments at the city and county level.\n\nIBSH holds a friendly rivalry with the Junior High and Senior High Departments of NEHS, especially during Field Day, an all-school track and field competition held in early November.\n\nStudents host dances, concerts, and other events such as the back-to-school event (co-hosted by BDSC, InterAct, and Key Club), Beat Concert (co-hosted by InterAct and EDSC), the casual dance (hosted by BDSC), Charity Night (co-hosted by InterAct and Key Club), the semi-formal dance (hosted by BDSC), Prom (hosted by the junior class), TEDxYouth@IBSH, GLO Night: Club Central (hosted by the Global Leadership Organization), and Unplugged (hosted by Key Club).\n\n==See also==\n* [[National Experimental High School]]\n* [[Hsinchu American School]]\n* [[Taipei American School]]\n* [[Dominican International School]]\n* [[Morrison Academy]]\n* [[Kaohsiung American School]]\n* [[American School in Taichung]]\n* [[Pacific American School]]\n* [[Hsinchu Science Park]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ibsh.tw  International Bilingual School At Hsinchu Science Park]\n\n{{coord missing|Taiwan}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:International Bilingual School At Hsinchu Science Park}}\n[[Category:1983 establishments in Taiwan]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1983]]\n[[Category:Experimental schools]]\n[[Category:High schools in Taiwan]]\n[[Category:Schools in Hsinchu]]\n\n[[ja:\u56fd\u7acb\u79d1\u5b66\u5de5\u696d\u5712\u533a\u5b9f\u9a13\u9ad8\u7d1a\u4e2d\u5b66]]\n[[zh:\u570b\u7acb\u79d1\u5b78\u5de5\u696d\u5712\u5340\u5be6\u9a57\u9ad8\u7d1a\u4e2d\u5b78]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Original research|date=April 2013}}\n{{More references|date=July 2018}}\n}}\n{{Infobox school\n| name = International Bilingual School at Hsinchu Science Park\n| native_name = \u570b\u7acb\u79d1\u5b78\u5de5\u696d\u5712\u5340\u5be6\u9a57\u9ad8\u7d1a\u4e2d\u5b78\u96d9\u8a9e\u90e8\n| image = \n| motto = \u8aa0\u61c7\u3001\u8e0f\u5be6\u3001\u5275\u65b0\u3001\u8d85\u8d8a\n| motto_translation = Sincere, Steadfast, Innovative, Transcending\n| established = {{Start date and age|1983}}\n| type = [[Nation]]al [[High School]], [[elementary school]]\n| principal = Roger Lee\n| address = No.300, Jie-Shou Road\n| city = [[Hsinchu City]]\n| country = [[Taiwan]]\n| SAT_year = 2018\n| SAT = 1450\n| website = {{URL|www.ibsh.tw}} {{in lang|en}}\n}}\n\nThe '''International Bilingual School at Hsinchu Science Park''' ('''IBSH'''; {{zh|c=\u570b\u7acb\u79d1\u5b78\u5de5\u696d\u5712\u5340\u5be6\u9a57\u9ad8\u7d1a\u4e2d\u5b78\u96d9\u8a9e\u90e8}}), formerly known as '''Bilingual Department of National Experimental High School At Science Based Industrial Park''', is near the [[Hsinchu Science Park]].

Ritter graduated in 1970.<ref name=lipton>{{cite magazine| last=Lipton| first=Michael A.| title=Acting His Age| url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| magazine=People| date=December 16, 2002| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107160642/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| archivedate=November 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Film and television===\n[[File:John Ritter 1977.jpg|thumb|Ritter as [[Jack Tripper]], 1977]]\nRitter headlined several stage performances. After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]]. It ran for 364 performances.

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog.

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Wires are used to bear mechanical [[Structural load|load]]s or [[electricity]] and [[Signal (electronics)|telecommunications signals]]. Wire iuhduchiuhusdfis commonly formed by [[drawing (manufacturing)|drawing]] the metal through a hole in a [[Die (manufacturing)|die]] or [[draw plate]]. [[Wire gauge]]s come in various [[standardisation|standard]] sizes, as expressed in terms of a [[American wire gauge|gauge number]]. The term 'wire' is also used more loosely to refer to a bundle of such strands, as in \"multistranded wire\", which is more correctly termed a [[wire rope]] in mechanics, or a [[Electrical cable|cable]] in electricity.\n\nWire comes in solid core, stranded, or braided forms. Although usually circular in cross-section, wire can be made in square, hexagonal, flattened rectangular, or other cross-sections, either for decorative purposes, or for technical purposes such as high-efficiency [[voice coil]]s in [[loudspeaker]]s. Edge-wound<ref name=SwigerCoil>{{cite web|last=Swiger Coil Systems|title=Edgewound Coils|url=http://www.swigercoil.com/edge-wound-Coils_edge-bent-coils.asp|publisher=Swiger Coil Systems, A Wabtec Company|accessdate=1 January 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219053052/http://swigercoil.com/edge-wound-Coils_edge-bent-coils.asp|archivedate=19 December 2010}}</ref> [[coil spring]]s, such as the [[Slinky]] toy, are made of special flattened wire.\n\nA key property of a wire is its Pike constant: a measure of the maximum current that can pass through a given cross-sectional area of the wire material. Generally attributed to conductive metals, like copper (which has a Pike constant of 69kCl^-1ms^-1), it is often used by professionals like electrical engineers.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Wire wrapped jewelry.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Wire wrapped jewelry]]]]\nIn [[Ancient technology|antiquity]], [[jewelry]] often contains, in the form of chains and applied decoration, large amounts of wire that is accurately made and which must have been produced by some efficient, if not technically advanced, means. In some cases, strips cut from metal sheet were made into wire by pulling them through perforations in stone beads. This causes the strips to fold round on themselves to form thin tubes. This strip drawing technique was in use in [[Egypt]] by the [[2nd Dynasty]]. From the middle of the 2nd millennium BCE most of the [[gold]] wires in jewellery are characterised by seam lines that follow a spiral path along the wire. Such twisted strips can be converted into solid round wires by rolling them between flat surfaces or the strip wire drawing method. The strip twist wire manufacturing method was superseded by [[wire drawing|drawing]] in the ancient [[Old World]] sometime between about the 8th and 10th centuries AD.<ref>Jack Ogden, 'Classical Gold wire: Some Aspects of its Manufacture and Use', ''Jewellery Studies'', 5, 1991, pp. 95\u2013105.</ref> There is some evidence for the use of drawing further East prior to this period.<ref>Jack Ogden, 'Connections between Islam, Europe, and the Far East in the Medieval Period: The Evidence of the Jewelry Technology'. Eds P. Jett, J Douglas, B. McCarthy, J Winter. ''Scientific Research in the Field of Asian Art. Fiftieth-Anniversary Symposium Proceedings''. Archetype Publications, London in association with the Freer Gallery of Art, Smithsonian Institution, 2003.</ref>\n\nSquare and hexagonal wires were possibly made using a [[swaging]] technique. In this method a metal rod was struck between grooved metal blocks, or between a grooved punch and a grooved metal [[anvil]]. Swaging is of great antiquity, possibly dating to the beginning of the 2nd millennium BCE in Egypt and in the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]]s in Europe for [[torc]]s and [[Fibula (brooch)|fibulae]]. Twisted square-section wires are a very common [[filigree]] decoration in early [[Etruscan civilisation|Etruscan]] jewelry.\n\nIn about the middle of the 2nd millennium BCE, a new category of decorative tube was introduced which imitated a line of granules. True beaded wire, produced by mechanically distorting a round-section wire, appeared in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] and Italy in the seventh century BCE, perhaps disseminated by the [[Phoenicia]]ns. Beaded wire continued to be used in jewellery into modern times, although it largely fell out of favour in about the tenth century CE when two drawn round wires, twisted together to form what are termed 'ropes', provided a simpler-to-make alternative. A forerunner to beaded wire may be the notched strips and wires which first occur from around 2000 BCE in [[Anatolia]].\n\n[[File:Sophie Ryder's \"Sitting\" (side view).jpg|thumb|[[Sophie Ryder]]'s galvanised wire sculpture ''Sitting'' at the [[Yorkshire Sculpture Park]]]]\nWire was [[Wire drawing|drawn]] in England from the medieval period. The wire was used to make [[Carding|wool cards]] and pins, manufactured goods whose import was prohibited by [[Edward IV]] in 1463.<ref>H. R. Schubert, 'The wiredrawers of Bristol' ''Journal Iron & Steel Institute'' 159 (1948), 16-22.</ref> The first wire mill in Great Britain was established at [[Tintern]] in about 1568 by the founders of the [[Company of Mineral and Battery Works]], who had a [[monopoly]] on this.<ref>M. B. Donald, ''Elizabethan Monopolies: Company of Mineral and Battery Works'' (Olver & Boyd, Edinburgh 1961), 95-141.</ref> Apart from their second wire mill at nearby Whitebrook,<ref>D. G. Tucker, 'The seventeenth century wireworks at Whitebrook, Monmouthshire' ''Bull. Hist. Metall. Gp'' 7(1) (1973), 28-35.</ref> there were no other wire mills before the second half of the 17th century. Despite the existence of mills, the drawing of wire down to fine sizes continued to be done manually.\n\nWire is usually drawn of cylindrical form; but it may be made of any desired section by varying the outline of the holes in the draw-plate through which it is passed in the process of manufacture. The [[draw plate|draw-plate]] or [[die (manufacturing)|die]] is a piece of hard cast-iron or hard steel, or for fine work it may be a [[diamond]] or a [[ruby]]. The object of utilising precious stones is to enable the dies to be used for a considerable period without losing their size, and so producing wire of incorrect diameter. Diamond dies must be rebored when they have lost their original diameter of hole, but metal dies are brought down to size again by hammering up the hole and then drifting it out to correct diameter with a punch.\n\n==Uses==\n{{anchor|Uses}}\n{{see also|Copper wire and cable}}\n[[File:Piano string detail2.JPG|thumb|upright|Close-up of strings for a [[piano]] shows \"overspun\" [[helix|helical]] wire wrapping added to main carrier wires]]\nWire has many uses. It forms the raw material of many important [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]], such as the [[wire netting]] industry, engineered springs, [[Lam\u00e9 (fabric)|wire-cloth]] making and [[wire rope]] spinning, in which it occupies a place analogous to a [[textile]] [[fiber]]. Wire-cloth of all degrees of strength and fineness of mesh is used for sifting and screening machinery, for draining paper pulp, for window screens, and for many other purposes. Vast quantities of [[Aluminum wire|aluminium]], [[Copper wire and cable|copper]], [[nickel]] and [[steel]] wire are employed for telephone and [[data cable]]s, and as conductors in [[electric power transmission]], and [[electrical heating|heating]]. It is in no less demand for fencing, and much is consumed in the construction of [[suspension bridge]]s, and cages, etc. In the manufacture of stringed musical instruments and scientific instruments, wire is again largely used. Carbon and stainless spring steel wire have significant applications in engineered springs for critical automotive or industrial manufactured parts/components. Pin and [[Hairpin (fashion)|hairpin]] making; the needle and [[fish hook|fish-hook]] industries; nail, peg, and rivet making; and [[carding]] machinery consume large amounts of wire as feedstock.\n\nNot all metals and metallic [[alloy]]s possess the physical properties necessary to make useful wire. The metals must in the first place be [[ductile]] and strong in tension, the quality on which the utility of wire principally depends. The principal metals suitable for wire, possessing almost equal ductility, are [[platinum]], [[silver]], [[iron]], [[copper]], aluminium, and [[gold]]; and it is only from these and certain of their [[alloy]]s with other metals, principally [[brass]] and [[bronze]], that wire is prepared.\n\nBy careful treatment, extremely thin wire can be produced. Special purpose wire is however made from other metals (e.g. [[tungsten]] wire for [[light bulb]] and [[vacuum tube]] filaments, because of its high melting temperature). Copper wires are also plated with other metals, such as tin, nickel, and silver to handle different temperatures, provide lubrication, and provide easier stripping of rubber insulation from copper.\n\nMetallic wires are often used for the lower-pitched sound-producing \"strings\" in [[stringed instruments]], such as [[violin]]s, [[cello]]s, and [[guitar]]s, and percussive string instruments such as [[piano]]s, [[dulcimer]]s, [[dobro]]s, and [[cimbalom]]s. To increase the mass per unit length (and thus lower the pitch of the sound even further), the main wire may sometimes be [[helix|helically]] wrapped with another, finer strand of wire. Such musical strings are said to be \"overspun\"; the added wire may be circular in cross-section (\"round-wound\"), or flattened before winding (\"flat-wound\").\n\n==Production==\n[[File:SydneyWireMill 1913 Canada a017696.jpg|thumb|Wire mill (1913)]]\n{{Main article|Wire drawing}}\n\nWire is often reduced to the desired diameter and properties by repeated [[drawing (manufacturing)|drawing]] through progressively smaller dies, or traditionally holes in [[draw plate]]s. After a number of passes the wire may be [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealed]] to facilitate more drawing or, if it is a finished product, to maximise ductility and [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]].\n\n==Finishing, jacketing, and insulating==\n[[File:RG-59.jpg|thumb|[[Coaxial cable]], one example of a jacketed and insulated wire]]\nElectrical wires are usually covered with [[insulation (electric)|insulating materials]], such as plastic, rubber-like polymers, or varnish. Insulating and jacketing of wires and cables is nowadays done by passing them through an extruder. Formerly, materials used for insulation included treated cloth or paper and various oil-based products. Since the mid-1960s, plastic and [[polymer]]s exhibiting properties similar to rubber have predominated.\n\nTwo or more wires may be wrapped concentrically, separated by insulation, to form [[coaxial cable]]. The wire or cable may be further protected with substances like [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]], some kind of preservative compound, bitumen, [[lead]], aluminum sheathing, or steel taping. Stranding or covering machines wind material onto wire which passes through quickly. Some of the smallest machines for cotton covering have a large drum, which grips the wire and moves it through toothed gears; the wire passes through the centre of disks mounted above a long bed, and the disks carry each a number of [[bobbin]]s varying from six to twelve or more in different machines. A supply of covering material is wound on each bobbin, and the end is led on to the wire, which occupies a central position relatively to the bobbins; the latter being revolved at a suitable speed bodily with their disks, the cotton is consequently served on to the wire, winding in spiral fashion so as to overlap. If many strands are required the disks are duplicated, so that as many as sixty spools may be carried, the second set of strands being laid over the first.\n\nFor heavier cables that are used for [[electric light]] and power as well as submarine cables, the machines are somewhat different in construction. The wire is still carried through a hollow shaft, but the bobbins or spools of covering material are set with their spindles at right angles to the axis of the wire, and they lie in a circular cage which rotates on rollers below. The various strands coming from the spools at various parts of the circumference of the cage all lead to a disk at the end of the hollow shaft. This disk has perforations through which each of the strands pass, thence being immediately wrapped on the cable, which slides through a bearing at this point. Toothed gears having certain definite ratios are used to cause the winding drum for the cable and the cage for the spools to rotate at suitable relative speeds which do not vary. The cages are multiplied for stranding with many tapes or strands, so that a machine may have six bobbins on one cage and twelve on the other.\n\n== Forms of wire ==\n{{further information|Copper wire and cable#Types of copper wire and cable}}\n{{anchor|Solid_versus_stranded}}\n\n===Solid wire===\nSolid wire, also called solid-core or single-strand wire, consists of one piece of metal wire. Solid wire is useful for wiring breadboards. Solid wire is cheaper to manufacture than stranded wire and is used where there is little need for flexibility in the wire. Solid wire also provides mechanical ruggedness; and, because it has relatively less surface area which is exposed to attack by corrosives, protection against the environment.\n\n===Stranded wire===\n[[File:Stranded lamp wire.jpg|thumb|Stranded [[copper]] wire]]\nStranded wire is composed of a number of small wires bundled or wrapped together to form a larger conductor. Stranded wire is more flexible than solid wire of the same total cross-sectional area. Stranded wire is used when higher resistance to [[metal fatigue]] is required. Such situations include connections between [[Printed circuit board|circuit boards]] in multi-printed-circuit-board devices, where the rigidity of solid wire would produce too much stress as a result of movement during assembly or servicing; [[Alternating current|A.C.]] line cords for appliances; musical instrument cables; computer mouse cables; welding electrode cables; control cables connecting moving machine parts; mining machine cables; trailing machine cables; and numerous others. \n\nAt high frequencies, current travels near the surface of the wire because of the ''[[skin effect]]'', resulting in increased power loss in the wire. Stranded wire might seem to reduce this effect, since the total surface area of the strands is greater than the surface area of the equivalent solid wire, but ordinary stranded wire does not reduce the skin effect because all the strands are short-circuited together and behave as a single conductor. A stranded wire will have higher resistance than a solid wire of the same diameter because the cross-section of the stranded wire is not all copper; there are unavoidable gaps between the strands (this is the [[circle packing]] problem for [[Packing problem#Circles in circle|circles within a circle]]). A stranded wire with the same cross-section of conductor as a solid wire is said to have the same [[American wire gauge#Tables of AWG wire sizes|equivalent gauge]] and is always a larger diameter.\n\nHowever, for many high-frequency applications, ''[[proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]]'' is more severe than skin effect, and in some limited cases, simple stranded wire can reduce proximity effect. For better performance at high frequencies, [[litz wire]], which has the individual strands insulated and twisted in special patterns, may be used.\n\n==== Number of strands====\nThe more individual wire strands in a wire bundle, the more flexible, kink-resistant, break-resistant, and stronger the wire becomes. However, more strands increases manufacturing complexity and cost.\n\nFor [[circle packing|geometrical reasons]], the lowest number of strands usually seen is 7: one in the middle, with 6 surrounding it in close contact. The next level up is 19, which is another layer of 12 strands on top of the 7. After that the number varies, but 37 and 49 are common, then in the 70 to 100 range (the number is no longer exact). Even larger numbers than that are typically found only in very large cables.\n\nFor application where the wire moves, 19 is the lowest that should be used (7 should only be used in applications where the wire is placed and then does not move), and 49 is much better. For applications with constant repeated movement, such as assembly robots and [[headphone]] wires, 70 to 100 is mandatory.\n\nFor applications that need even more flexibility, even more strands are used (welding cables are the usual example, but also any application that needs to move wire in tight areas). One example is a 2/0 wire made from 5,292 strands of No. 36 gauge wire. The strands are organized by first creating a bundle of 7 strands. Then 7 of these bundles are put together into super bundles. Finally 108 super bundles are used to make the final cable. Each group of wires is wound in a helix so that when the wire is flexed, the part of a bundle that is stretched moves around the helix to a part that is compressed to allow the wire to have less stress.\n\n====Prefused====\nPrefused wire is stranded wire made up of strands that are heavily [[tinned]], then fused together.  Prefused wire has many of the properties of solid wire, except it is less likely to break.<ref>{{cite web |title=Types of Strand Construction |publisher=Industrial Electric Wire & Cable |date=2019 |url=https://www.iewc.com/resources/technical-guide/types-of-strand-construction |accessdate=8 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Braided wire===\nA braided wire consists of a number of small strands of wire braided together.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=99W8BwAAQBAJ&pg=PA12|title=Show Your Colors: 30 Flexible Beading Wire Jewelry Projects|last=Hogsett|first=Jamie|last2=Oehler|first2=Sara|date=2012|publisher=Kalmbach Books|isbn=978-0-87116-755-2|page=12}}</ref> Braided wires do not break easily when flexed.

In a hypothetical ideal coaxial cable the electromagnetic field carrying the signal exists only in the space between the inner and outer conductors.

Wires are used to bear mechanical [[Structural load|load]]s or [[electricity]] and [[Signal (electronics)|telecommunications signals]]. Wire is commonly formed by [[drawing (manufacturing)|drawing]] the metal through a hole in a [[Die (manufacturing)|die]] or [[draw plate]]. [[Wire gauge]]s come in various [[standardisation|standard]] sizes, as expressed in terms of a [[American wire gauge|gauge number]]. The term 'wire' is also used more loosely to refer to a bundle of such strands, as in \"multistranded wire\", which is more correctly termed a [[wire rope]] in mechanics, or a [[Electrical cable|cable]] in electricity.\n\nWire comes in solid core, stranded, or braided forms. Although usually circular in cross-section, wire can be made in square, hexagonal, flattened rectangular, or other cross-sections, either for decorative purposes, or for technical purposes such as high-efficiency [[voice coil]]s in [[loudspeaker]]s. Edge-wound<ref name=SwigerCoil>{{cite web|last=Swiger Coil Systems|title=Edgewound Coils|url=http://www.swigercoil.com/edge-wound-Coils_edge-bent-coils.asp|publisher=Swiger Coil Systems, A Wabtec Company|accessdate=1 January 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219053052/http://swigercoil.com/edge-wound-Coils_edge-bent-coils.asp|archivedate=19 December 2010}}</ref> [[coil spring]]s, such as the [[Slinky]] toy, are made of special flattened wire.\n\nA key property of a wire is its Pike constant: a measure of the maximum current that can pass through a given cross-sectional area of the wire material. Generally attributed to conductive metals, like copper (which has a Pike constant of 69kCl^-1ms^-1), it is often used by professionals like electrical engineers.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Wire wrapped jewelry.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Wire wrapped jewelry]]]]\nIn [[Ancient technology|antiquity]], [[jewelry]] often contains, in the form of chains and applied decoration, large amounts of wire that is accurately made and which must have been produced by some efficient, if not technically advanced, means. In some cases, strips cut from metal sheet were made into wire by pulling them through perforations in stone beads. This causes the strips to fold round on themselves to form thin tubes. This strip drawing technique was in use in [[Egypt]] by the [[2nd Dynasty]]. From the middle of the 2nd millennium BCE most of the [[gold]] wires in jewellery are characterised by seam lines that follow a spiral path along the wire. Such twisted strips can be converted into solid round wires by rolling them between flat surfaces or the strip wire drawing method. The strip twist wire manufacturing method was superseded by [[wire drawing|drawing]] in the ancient [[Old World]] sometime between about the 8th and 10th centuries AD.<ref>Jack Ogden, 'Classical Gold wire: Some Aspects of its Manufacture and Use', ''Jewellery Studies'', 5, 1991, pp. 95\u2013105.</ref> There is some evidence for the use of drawing further East prior to this period.<ref>Jack Ogden, 'Connections between Islam, Europe, and the Far East in the Medieval Period: The Evidence of the Jewelry Technology'. Eds P. Jett, J Douglas, B. McCarthy, J Winter. ''Scientific Research in the Field of Asian Art. Fiftieth-Anniversary Symposium Proceedings''. Archetype Publications, London in association with the Freer Gallery of Art, Smithsonian Institution, 2003.</ref>\n\nSquare and hexagonal wires were possibly made using a [[swaging]] technique. In this method a metal rod was struck between grooved metal blocks, or between a grooved punch and a grooved metal [[anvil]]. Swaging is of great antiquity, possibly dating to the beginning of the 2nd millennium BCE in Egypt and in the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]]s in Europe for [[torc]]s and [[Fibula (brooch)|fibulae]]. Twisted square-section wires are a very common [[filigree]] decoration in early [[Etruscan civilisation|Etruscan]] jewelry.\n\nIn about the middle of the 2nd millennium BCE, a new category of decorative tube was introduced which imitated a line of granules. True beaded wire, produced by mechanically distorting a round-section wire, appeared in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] and Italy in the seventh century BCE, perhaps disseminated by the [[Phoenicia]]ns. Beaded wire continued to be used in jewellery into modern times, although it largely fell out of favour in about the tenth century CE when two drawn round wires, twisted together to form what are termed 'ropes', provided a simpler-to-make alternative. A forerunner to beaded wire may be the notched strips and wires which first occur from around 2000 BCE in [[Anatolia]].\n\n[[File:Sophie Ryder's \"Sitting\" (side view).jpg|thumb|[[Sophie Ryder]]'s galvanised wire sculpture ''Sitting'' at the [[Yorkshire Sculpture Park]]]]\nWire was [[Wire drawing|drawn]] in England from the medieval period. The wire was used to make [[Carding|wool cards]] and pins, manufactured goods whose import was prohibited by [[Edward IV]] in 1463.<ref>H. R. Schubert, 'The wiredrawers of Bristol' ''Journal Iron & Steel Institute'' 159 (1948), 16-22.</ref> The first wire mill in Great Britain was established at [[Tintern]] in about 1568 by the founders of the [[Company of Mineral and Battery Works]], who had a [[monopoly]] on this.<ref>M.

Tucker, 'The seventeenth century wireworks at Whitebrook, Monmouthshire' ''Bull. Hist. Metall. Gp'' 7(1) (1973), 28-35.</ref> there were no other wire mills before the second half of the 17th century. Despite the existence of mills, the drawing of wire down to fine sizes continued to be done manually.\n\nWire is usually drawn of cylindrical form; but it may be made of any desired section by varying the outline of the holes in the draw-plate through which it is passed in the process of manufacture. The [[draw plate|draw-plate]] or [[die (manufacturing)|die]] is a piece of hard cast-iron or hard steel, or for fine work it may be a [[diamond]] or a [[ruby]]. The object of utilising precious stones is to enable the dies to be used for a considerable period without losing their size, and so producing wire of incorrect diameter. Diamond dies must be rebored when they have lost their original diameter of hole, but metal dies are brought down to size again by hammering up the hole and then drifting it out to correct diameter with a punch.\n\n==Uses==\n{{anchor|Uses}}\n{{see also|Copper wire and cable}}\n[[File:Piano string detail2.JPG|thumb|upright|Close-up of strings for a [[piano]] shows \"overspun\" [[helix|helical]] wire wrapping added to main carrier wires]]\nWire has many uses. It forms the raw material of many important [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]], such as the [[wire netting]] industry, engineered springs, [[Lam\u00e9 (fabric)|wire-cloth]] making and [[wire rope]] spinning, in which it occupies a place analogous to a [[textile]] [[fiber]]. Wire-cloth of all degrees of strength and fineness of mesh is used for sifting and screening machinery, for draining paper pulp, for window screens, and for many other purposes. Vast quantities of [[Aluminum wire|aluminium]], [[Copper wire and cable|copper]], [[nickel]] and [[steel]] wire are employed for telephone and [[data cable]]s, and as conductors in [[electric power transmission]], and [[electrical heating|heating]]. It is in no less demand for fencing, and much is consumed in the construction of [[suspension bridge]]s, and cages, etc. In the manufacture of stringed musical instruments and scientific instruments, wire is again largely used. Carbon and stainless spring steel wire have significant applications in engineered springs for critical automotive or industrial manufactured parts/components. Pin and [[Hairpin (fashion)|hairpin]] making; the needle and [[fish hook|fish-hook]] industries; nail, peg, and rivet making; and [[carding]] machinery consume large amounts of wire as feedstock.\n\nNot all metals and metallic [[alloy]]s possess the physical properties necessary to make useful wire. The metals must in the first place be [[ductile]] and strong in tension, the quality on which the utility of wire principally depends. The principal metals suitable for wire, possessing almost equal ductility, are [[platinum]], [[silver]], [[iron]], [[copper]], aluminium, and [[gold]]; and it is only from these and certain of their [[alloy]]s with other metals, principally [[brass]] and [[bronze]], that wire is prepared.\n\nBy careful treatment, extremely thin wire can be produced.

Practical cables achieve this objective to a high degree. A coaxial cable provides extra protection of signals from external electromagnetic interference, and effectively guides signals with low emission along the length of the cable which in turn affects thermal heat inside the conductivity of the wire.\n* ''Speaker wire'' is used to make a low-resistance electrical connection between loudspeakers and audio amplifiers. Some high-end modern speaker wire consists of multiple electrical conductors individually insulated by plastic, similar to [[Litz wire]].\n* ''[[Resistance wire]]'' is wire with higher than normal resistivity, often used for [[heating element]]s or for making wire-wound [[resistor]]s. [[Nichrome]] wire is the most common type.\n\n==See also==\n*For electrical power transmission see: [[Power cable]], [[High-voltage cable]] and [[High-voltage direct current|HVDC]]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Barbed wire]]\n*[[Wire rope|Cable]]\n*[[Chicken wire]]\n* [[Electrical connector]]\n*[[Electrical wiring]]\n*[[Litz wire]]\n*[[Piano wire]]\n*[[Razor wire]]\n*[[THHN]]\n*[[Tinsel wire]]\n*[[Wire bonding]]\n*[[Wire gauge]]\n*[[Wire netting]]\n*[[Wire rope]]\n*[[Wire wrapped jewelry]]\n*[[Wollaston wire]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=Wire |volume=28 |page=738}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* [http://www.66pacific.com/calculators/wire_calc.aspx Wire Gauge to Diameter\u2014Diameter to Wire Gauge Converter] - Online calculator converts gauge to diameter or diameter to gauge for any wire size.\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Wire| ]]\n[[Category:Hardware (mechanical)]]\n\n[[fr:Conducteur (\u00e9lectricit\u00e9)]]\n", "name_user": "202.133.223.63", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire"}

It is operated and owned by [[Merlin Entertainments]] and includes rides, a themed hotel, live events and [[Stealth (roller coaster)|Stealth]], the UK's fastest rollercoaster.\n\nAfter demolition of the Thorpe Park Estate in the 1930s, the site became a gravel pit. Thorpe Park Resort was built in the 1970s on the gravel pit which was partially flooded, creating a water-based theme for the park. It was officially opened to the public by [[Lord Louis Mountbatten]] in 1979. It has since grown into one of the major theme parks in the UK.\n\nMajor attractions include a large water ride ''[[Tidal Wave (Thorpe Park)|Tidal Wave]]'', a number of rollercoasters including ''[[Colossus (Thorpe Park)|Colossus]], [[Nemesis Inferno]], [[Stealth (roller coaster)|Stealth]], [[Saw \u2013 The Ride]], [[The Swarm (roller coaster)|The Swarm]]'', ''[[X (roller coaster)|The Walking Dead: The Ride]]'' and dark ride ''[[Derren Brown's Ghost Train|Derren Brown's Ghost Train: Rise of the Demon]]''. Other smaller attractions include a water area called Amity Beach and an [[Angry Birds]] themed land. It also has on-site accommodation, the Thorpe Shark Hotel.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Thorpe Park Lake in early days - geograph.org.uk - 771796.jpg|thumb|153x153px|Thorpe Park Lake in July 1979, the year the park opened to the public|left]]\n\nThe demolition of the Thorpe Park Estate in the 1930s saw the site transform into a gravel pit, originally owned by [[RMC Group|Ready Mixed Concrete Limited]]. In the 1970s RMC flooded part of the site and created a water leisure and exhibition park, opening in 1979. The first theme park development began a few years later, with new attractions opening throughout the 1980s-90s.

Attractions in this area include ''Angry Birds 4D'', ''Detonator: Bombs Away'' and ''King Pig's Wild Hog Dodgems''.\n* ''Old Town'' is located towards the back of the park and includes ''[[Saw - The Ride]]'', ''Rocky Express'', ''Timber Tug Boat'' and ''Lumber Jump''. \n* ''Lost City'' contains ''[[Colossus (Thorpe Park)|Colossus]]'', ''Rush'', ''Quantum'', ''Vortex'' and ''Zodiac''.\n* ''Swarm Island'' opened as the plaza for The Swarm.\n* ''The Dock Yard'' (initially named 'The Depot') is the plaza immediately outside ''[[Derren Brown's Ghost Train|Derren Brown's Ghost Train: Rise of the Demon]]'' and includes the nearby ''[[The Walking Dead: The Ride]]'' rollercoaster.\n\n===Port and Basecamp===\nThe 'Basecamp' area contains the turnstiles and bridge where guests enter the park. This leads to the dome, now named 'The Port', which houses Fin's Bar and Grill, an arcade area, food and beverage outletes, toilets, lockers, the Island Gift Shop, guest services, first aid and staff areas.\n\nThe dome was previously known as 'Port Atlantis' with an Atlantis themed interior. Much the scenery and underwater effect went missing since Merlin's acquisition of the park and was removed altogether after the building's change of name.\n\n===Amity===\nAmity is set as a 1950s-era American fishing village hit by a [[Tsunami|tidal wave]] and opened with ''Tidal Wave'' in 2000. It was previously named 'Amity Cove', as still named on themed signage. The area was expanded in 2006 with ''Stealth'', set at 'Amity Speedway' racetrack. It later took on attractions from the former 'Neptune's Beach' family area, ''Depth Charge'', ''Wet Wet Wet'' and ''Amity Beach'' outdoor water park.\n\nIt also includes attractions from the former 'European Park' area, ''[[Flying Fish (roller coaster)|Flying Fish]]'' and ''Storm In A Teacup'. Flying Fish was originally located beside Tidal Wave but moved following construction of Stealth to its present location. In 2011, the raft water ride ''[[Storm Surge (ride)|Storm Surge]]'' was re-located from ''[[Cypress Gardens]]'' in Florida, USA to the former site of the 'Octopus Garden' children's area.\n\n=== The Jungle ===\nThe area's main attractions are ''[[Nemesis Inferno]]'', a [[Bolliger & Mabillard]] inverted coaster set in a volcano, and ''[[Rumba Rapids]]''. Previously named 'Calypso Quay', the area includes part of the former 'Ranger County' family area, including ''Mr Monkey's Banana Ride'', as well as shopfronts and restaurants from the former 'European Park' area.\n\nIn 2019, ''Jungle Escape'' opened in the building formerly housing the ''[[I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!|I'm a Celebrity...]]'' Maze.\n \n==== Angry Birds Land ====\nAngry Birds Land opened in May 2014 and is sponsored by the [[Angry Birds]] video game.  Attractions include ''Angry Birds 4D'', ''King Pig's Wild Hog Dodgems'' and ''[[Detonator: Bombs Away]]''.\n\n=== The Dock Yard ===\nThis area is primarily the plaza for ''[[Derren Brown's Ghost Train|Derren Brown's Ghost Train: Rise of the Demon]]'' and also contains ''[[The Walking Dead: The Ride]]''. The area has no themed features, other than buildings and scenery remaining from 'Octopus's Garden' (a since-closed children's area).\n\n=== Lost City ===\nThe Lost City theme is that of ruins of a recently unearthed Atlantean civilisation with the Colossus roller coaster as the main attraction opening in 2002. The area first opened in 2001 with the ''[[Vortex (Thorpe Park)|Vortex]]'' and ''[[Zodiac (ride)|Zodiac]]'' rides as the only attractions. In 2003 ''Quantum'', a [[magic carpet]] ride opened.  More attractions have since joined the rides line up with ''[[Rush (Thorpe Park)|Rush]]'' an [[S&S Worldwide|S&S]] Screamin' Swing which opened in 2005.\n\n=== Old Town ===\nThe main ride in this area is ''[[Saw - The Ride]]'', a [[Gerstlauer]] [[Euro-Fighter]] with a 100-degree drop. The ride is sponsored by the Saw movie franchise and is set in a derelict warehouse. ''[[Samurai (ride)|Samurai]]'' was relocated from [[Chessington World of Adventures Resort|Chessington World of Adventures]] in 2004.  ''Timber Tug Boat'' and ''Lumber Jump'' were children's attractions relocated from the Weymouth SeaLife Adventure Park and Marine Sanctuary. The area includes a [[Burger King]] and the Wild Wings Noodle Bar.\n\nThe area was previously named 'Canada Creek' and was the plaza for [[Loggers Leap]] log flume, opened in 1989. It had a loose Western theme, although this has mostly been lost through redevelopments. Today the main attractions listed in the area sit outside the plaza. ''Rocky Express'', a small Mack flat ride, is the only attraction remaining from 'Canada Creek'.\n\nLogger's Leap has remained nonoperational since 2015 and its permanent closure was confirmed in 2019.<ref name=\"twitter.com\"/> This area also was home to ''Slammer'' a ''[[S&S Worldwide|S&S]]'' ''[[Sky Swat]]'', which also still stands but was confirmed to be permanently closed.\n\n=== Swarm Island ===\nSwarm Island is the plaza for ''[[The Swarm (roller coaster)|The Swarm]]'', a [[Bolliger & Mabillard]] wing-rider rollercoaster, opened in 2012. The area was built on land reclaimed from the surrounding lakes. The area is themed as the scene of an apocalyptic disaster with a crashed plane, various damaged emergency vehicles a destroyed church and other destroyed structures.\n\n==Records held by the park==\n\n* ''[[Nemesis Inferno]]'' is the first inverted coaster to feature interlocking corkscrews.\n* ''[[The Swarm (roller coaster)|The Swarm]]'' opened as Europe's tallest Wing coaster. \n*[[SAW - The Ride]] has the steepest drop not controlled by brakes and was marketed as the worlds first horror movie themed roller coaster. While the park claimed it had the world's steepest drop on any roller coaster this isn't true as [[Steel Hawg]] at [[Indiana Beach]] had opened the previous year with a 111\u00b0 drop. It now features the ninth steepest drop behind [[The Monster (Adventureland)|The Monster]] at [[Adventureland (Iowa)|Adventureland]], [[Mumbo Jumbo (roller coaster)|Mumbo Jumbo]] at [[Flamingo Land]], [[Timber Drop]] at [[Fraispertuis City]], [[Cannibal (roller coaster)|Cannibal]] at [[Lagoon (amusement park)|Lagoon]], [[Crazy bird (roller coaster)|Crazy bird]] at [[Happy Valley (dongli)]], [[Green Lantern Coaster]] at [[Warner Bros.

[[Ministry of Sound]] club nights in The Dome occur one Saturday night a month from April to September. These club nights feature well known music DJs playing a variety of themed nights. However for 2019 these were replaced with the Club MTV event held around the park during normal hours rather than in The Dome. Summer Nights is when the park reopens after a normal day on Friday and Saturday Nights in July and August from 7pm-10pm for some late-night rides consisting of The Swarm, SAW - The Ride, Stealth, Colossus, Nemesis Inferno, Walking Dead and others.\n\n===Fright Nights===\n\n''Fright Nights'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thorpepark.com/events/fright-nights|title=FRIGHT NIGHTS at THORPE PARK Resort|website=www.thorpepark.com}}</ref> formerly \"Fright Nites\" is Thorpe Park's terrifying annual halloween event and also its largest Halloween event in the UK. It's an event that has been running at Thorpe Park since 2002, celebrating Halloween with the park staying open until late at night, as well as operating a range of temporary halloween attractions. Roaming actors in costume or with make up can also be found around the park.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/thorpe-park-fright-nights-an-evilution/ |title=Haunted Attractions UK - Thorpe Park Fright Nights... an EVILution! |accessdate=30 August 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226195505/http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/thorpe-park-fright-nights-an-evilution/ |archivedate=26 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> During Fright Nights, the park stays open until 10pm, with a range of scare mazes available for guests, who normally enter in groups of 8-10. \"Face it Alone\" has sometimes been available as an upcharge, where a guest enters unaccompanied and must sign a disclaimer before entering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://forum.maniahub.com/topic/11360-what-to-expect-from-face-it-alone-2016-my-first-ever/|title=What to expect from Face it Alone 2016 (my first ever.)|website=Thorpe Park Mania Forums}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Fright Nights was relaunched with a horror movie theme, courtesy of a three-year contract with [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. All of the pre-existing Fright Nights attractions were removed with the exception of The Asylum to make way for new horror-film themed attractions.\n\nIn 2014, when the [[Thorpe Shark Hotel]] opened, Thorpe Park decided to do an overnight scare attraction that involved live actors terrorising you while you are in your bed.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Before the experience began you were led to the back of the hotel where an actor would read you some scary stories.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn 2017 Fright Nights was reinvented with a Walking Dead theme.

The accommodation takes its name from its shark head entrance feature built from scrapped park signage.\n\nThe hotel initially opened in 2013 as 'The Crash Pad', run by external company [[Snoozebox]].

This would have been located on the opposite side of the lake, on the site of former excavation works, featuring a lakeside bar, health club and restaurant.\n\nThe development was pitched again following the installation of 'The Crash Pad' to \"test market conditions\". The park received planning permission to construct the permanent hotel in 2014, with construction planned to begin in 2016 and an opening in 2018. However, the hotel was never constructed and the Shark Hotel's planning permission was extended by 10 years instead.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Total Thorpe Park|first1=|title=Thorpe Park Hotel planning|url=http://www.totalthorpepark.co.uk/features/futurehotel.shtml|website=Theme Park Tourist|accessdate=21 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Developments ==\n\nIn 2010, the park outlined a 5-year development plan that outlined new coasters for 2012 (The Swarm) and 2015, as well as a permanent lakeside hotel.

It is operated and owned by [[Merlin Entertainments]] and includes rides, a themed hotel, live events and [[Stealth (roller coaster)|Stealth]], the UK's fastest rollercoaster.\n\nAfter demolition of the Thorpe Park Estate in the 1930s, the site became a gravel pit. Thorpe Park Resort was built in the 1970s on the gravel pit which was partially flooded, creating a water-based theme for the park. It was officially opened to the public by [[Lord Louis Mountbatten]] in 1979. It has since grown into one of the major theme parks in the UK.\n\nMajor attractions include a large water ride ''[[Tidal Wave (Thorpe Park)|Tidal Wave]]'', a number of rollercoasters including ''[[Colossus (Thorpe Park)|Colossus]], [[Nemesis Inferno]], [[Stealth (roller coaster)|Stealth]], [[Saw \u2013 The Ride]], [[The Swarm (roller coaster)|The Swarm]]'', ''[[X (roller coaster)|The Walking Dead: The Ride]]'' and dark ride ''[[Derren Brown's Ghost Train|Derren Brown's Ghost Train: Rise of the Demon]]''. Other smaller attractions include a water area called Amity Beach and an [[Angry Birds]] themed land. It also has on-site accommodation, the Thorpe Shark Hotel.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Thorpe Park Lake in early days - geograph.org.uk - 771796.jpg|thumb|153x153px|Thorpe Park Lake in July 1979, the year the park opened to the public|left]]\n\nThe demolition of the Thorpe Park Estate in the 1930s saw the site transform into a gravel pit, originally owned by [[RMC Group|Ready Mixed Concrete Limited]]. In the 1970s RMC flooded part of the site and created a water leisure and exhibition park, opening in 1979. The first theme park development began a few years later, with new attractions opening throughout the 1980s-90s. The last large attraction opened by the park's original owners was \"X:\\No Way Out\" in 1996. In 1998, [[The Tussauds Group]] bought the park. From the outset the park started opening key attractions such as Tidal Wave in 2000, Colossus in 2002, Nemesis Inferno in 2003 and Stealth in 2006.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nIn May 2007, [[Blackstone Group]] purchased The Tussauds Group from then-owner [[Dubai International Capital]] for US$1.9 billion; the company was merged by Blackstone into [[Merlin Entertainments]] and Merlin took over operation of Thorpe Park.<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2812377/Merlin-conjures-up-leaseback-deal.html|title=Merlin conjures up leaseback deal|date=17 July 2007|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/05/AR2007030501369.html|title=Blackstone Buys Madame Tussauds Chain|first=David|last=Cho|date=6 March 2007|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref> Dubai International Capital also gained 20% of Merlin Entertainments.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6419019.stm | work=BBC News | title=Tussauds firm bought in \u00a31bn deal | date=5 March 2007 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 July 2007, as part of the financing for the Tussauds deal, Merlin sold Thorpe Park, to private investor [[Nick Leslau]] and his investment firm Prestbury under a sale and leaseback agreement.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6902797.stm | work=BBC News | title=Alton Towers sold in \u00a3622m deal | date=17 July 2007 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref> Although it is owned by Prestbury, the site is operated by Merlin based on a renewable 35-year lease.<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\"/> In 2018, along with other Merlin attractions, Thorpe Park teamed up with [[Coca-Cola]] to offer half price tickets for recycled plastic bottles.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/25/uk-theme-parks-to-offer-half-price-entry-in-exchange-for-used-plastic-bottles|title=UK theme parks to offer half-price entry in exchange for used plastic bottles|last=Smithers|first=Rebecca|date=2018-07-25|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-01-10|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nThe target audience for the Resort is Teenagers and Young Adults, adding rides such as Saw - The Ride and The Swarm for example.

Attractions in this area include ''Angry Birds 4D'', ''Detonator: Bombs Away'' and ''King Pig's Wild Hog Dodgems''.\n* ''Old Town'' is located towards the back of the park and includes ''[[Saw - The Ride]]'', ''Rocky Express'', ''Timber Tug Boat'' and ''Lumber Jump''. \n* ''Lost City'' contains ''[[Colossus (Thorpe Park)|Colossus]]'', ''Rush'', ''Quantum'', ''Vortex'' and ''Zodiac''.\n* ''Swarm Island'' opened as the plaza for The Swarm.\n* ''The Dock Yard'' (initially named 'The Depot') is the plaza immediately outside ''[[Derren Brown's Ghost Train|Derren Brown's Ghost Train: Rise of the Demon]]'' and includes the nearby ''[[The Walking Dead: The Ride]]'' rollercoaster.\n\n===Port and Basecamp===\nThe 'Basecamp' area contains the turnstiles and bridge where guests enter the park. This leads to the dome, now named 'The Port', which houses Fin's Bar and Grill, an arcade area, food and beverage outletes, toilets, lockers, the Island Gift Shop, guest services, first aid and staff areas.\n\nThe dome was previously known as 'Port Atlantis' with an Atlantis themed interior. Much the scenery and underwater effect went missing since Merlin's acquisition of the park and was removed altogether after the building's change of name.\n\n===Amity===\nAmity is set as a 1950s-era American fishing village hit by a [[Tsunami|tidal wave]] and opened with ''Tidal Wave'' in 2000. It was previously named 'Amity Cove', as still named on themed signage. The area was expanded in 2006 with ''Stealth'', set at 'Amity Speedway' racetrack. It later took on attractions from the former 'Neptune's Beach' family area, ''Depth Charge'', ''Wet Wet Wet'' and ''Amity Beach'' outdoor water park.\n\nIt also includes attractions from the former 'European Park' area, ''[[Flying Fish (roller coaster)|Flying Fish]]'' and ''Storm In A Teacup'. Flying Fish was originally located beside Tidal Wave but moved following construction of Stealth to its present location. In 2011, the raft water ride ''[[Storm Surge (ride)|Storm Surge]]'' was re-located from ''[[Cypress Gardens]]'' in Florida, USA to the former site of the 'Octopus Garden' children's area.\n\n=== The Jungle ===\nThe area's main attractions are ''[[Nemesis Inferno]]'', a [[Bolliger & Mabillard]] inverted coaster set in a volcano, and ''[[Rumba Rapids]]''. Previously named 'Calypso Quay', the area includes part of the former 'Ranger County' family area, including ''Mr Monkey's Banana Ride'', as well as shopfronts and restaurants from the former 'European Park' area.\n\nIn 2019, ''Jungle Escape'' opened in the building formerly housing the ''[[I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!|I'm a Celebrity...]]'' Maze.\n \n==== Angry Birds Land ====\nAngry Birds Land opened in May 2014 and is sponsored by the [[Angry Birds]] video game.  Attractions include ''Angry Birds 4D'', ''King Pig's Wild Hog Dodgems'' and ''[[Detonator: Bombs Away]]''.\n\n=== The Dock Yard ===\nThis area is primarily the plaza for ''[[Derren Brown's Ghost Train|Derren Brown's Ghost Train: Rise of the Demon]]'' and also contains ''[[The Walking Dead: The Ride]]''. The area has no themed features, other than buildings and scenery remaining from 'Octopus's Garden' (a since-closed children's area).\n\n=== Lost City ===\nThe Lost City theme is that of ruins of a recently unearthed Atlantean civilisation with the Colossus roller coaster as the main attraction opening in 2002. The area first opened in 2001 with the ''[[Vortex (Thorpe Park)|Vortex]]'' and ''[[Zodiac (ride)|Zodiac]]'' rides as the only attractions. In 2003 ''Quantum'', a [[magic carpet]] ride opened.  More attractions have since joined the rides line up with ''[[Rush (Thorpe Park)|Rush]]'' an [[S&S Worldwide|S&S]] Screamin' Swing which opened in 2005.\n\n=== Old Town ===\nThe main ride in this area is ''[[Saw - The Ride]]'', a [[Gerstlauer]] [[Euro-Fighter]] with a 100-degree drop. The ride is sponsored by the Saw movie franchise and is set in a derelict warehouse. ''[[Samurai (ride)|Samurai]]'' was relocated from [[Chessington World of Adventures Resort|Chessington World of Adventures]] in 2004.  ''Timber Tug Boat'' and ''Lumber Jump'' were children's attractions relocated from the Weymouth SeaLife Adventure Park and Marine Sanctuary. The area includes a [[Burger King]] and the Wild Wings Noodle Bar.\n\nThe area was previously named 'Canada Creek' and was the plaza for [[Loggers Leap]] log flume, opened in 1989. It had a loose Western theme, although this has mostly been lost through redevelopments. Today the main attractions listed in the area sit outside the plaza. ''Rocky Express'', a small Mack flat ride, is the only attraction remaining from 'Canada Creek'.\n\nLogger's Leap has remained nonoperational since 2015 and its permanent closure was confirmed in 2019.<ref name=\"twitter.com\"/> This area also was home to ''Slammer'' a ''[[S&S Worldwide|S&S]]'' ''[[Sky Swat]]'', which also still stands but was confirmed to be permanently closed.\n\n=== Swarm Island ===\nSwarm Island is the plaza for ''[[The Swarm (roller coaster)|The Swarm]]'', a [[Bolliger & Mabillard]] wing-rider rollercoaster, opened in 2012. The area was built on land reclaimed from the surrounding lakes. The area is themed as the scene of an apocalyptic disaster with a crashed plane, various damaged emergency vehicles a destroyed church and other destroyed structures.\n\n==Records held by the park==\n\n* ''[[Nemesis Inferno]]'' is the first inverted coaster to feature interlocking corkscrews.\n* ''[[The Swarm (roller coaster)|The Swarm]]'' opened as Europe's tallest Wing coaster. \n*[[SAW - The Ride]] has the steepest drop not controlled by brakes and was marketed as the worlds first horror movie themed roller coaster. While the park claimed it had the world's steepest drop on any roller coaster this isn't true as [[Steel Hawg]] at [[Indiana Beach]] had opened the previous year with a 111\u00b0 drop. It now features the ninth steepest drop behind [[The Monster (Adventureland)|The Monster]] at [[Adventureland (Iowa)|Adventureland]], [[Mumbo Jumbo (roller coaster)|Mumbo Jumbo]] at [[Flamingo Land]], [[Timber Drop]] at [[Fraispertuis City]], [[Cannibal (roller coaster)|Cannibal]] at [[Lagoon (amusement park)|Lagoon]], [[Crazy bird (roller coaster)|Crazy bird]] at [[Happy Valley (dongli)]], [[Green Lantern Coaster]] at [[Warner Bros.

[[Ministry of Sound]] club nights in The Dome occur one Saturday night a month from April to September. These club nights feature well known music DJs playing a variety of themed nights. However for 2019 these were replaced with the Club MTV event held around the park during normal hours rather than in The Dome. Summer Nights is when the park reopens after a normal day on Friday and Saturday Nights in July and August from 7pm-10pm for some late-night rides consisting of The Swarm, SAW - The Ride, Stealth, Colossus, Nemesis Inferno, Walking Dead and others.\n\n===Fright Nights===\n\n''Fright Nights'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thorpepark.com/events/fright-nights|title=FRIGHT NIGHTS at THORPE PARK Resort|website=www.thorpepark.com}}</ref> formerly \"Fright Nites\" is Thorpe Park's terrifying annual halloween event and also its largest Halloween event in the UK. It's an event that has been running at Thorpe Park since 2002, celebrating Halloween with the park staying open until late at night, as well as operating a range of temporary halloween attractions. Roaming actors in costume or with make up can also be found around the park.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/thorpe-park-fright-nights-an-evilution/ |title=Haunted Attractions UK - Thorpe Park Fright Nights... an EVILution! |accessdate=30 August 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226195505/http://www.scareattractions.co.uk/thorpe-park-fright-nights-an-evilution/ |archivedate=26 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> During Fright Nights, the park stays open until 10pm, with a range of scare mazes available for guests, who normally enter in groups of 8-10. \"Face it Alone\" has sometimes been available as an upcharge, where a guest enters unaccompanied and must sign a disclaimer before entering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://forum.maniahub.com/topic/11360-what-to-expect-from-face-it-alone-2016-my-first-ever/|title=What to expect from Face it Alone 2016 (my first ever.)|website=Thorpe Park Mania Forums}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Fright Nights was relaunched with a horror movie theme, courtesy of a three-year contract with [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. All of the pre-existing Fright Nights attractions were removed with the exception of The Asylum to make way for new horror-film themed attractions.\n\nIn 2014, when the [[Thorpe Shark Hotel]] opened, Thorpe Park decided to do an overnight scare attraction that involved live actors terrorising you while you are in your bed.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Before the experience began you were led to the back of the hotel where an actor would read you some scary stories.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn 2017 Fright Nights was reinvented with a Walking Dead theme. The addition of two Walking Dead attractions coincided with the season 8 premier of the show. SAW Alive, The Big Top and Platform 15 remained in operation from previous years, with Containment returning as an upcharge attraction.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n!

attraction.\n\n==Hotel==\n\nGuests can stay over on-park at the 'Thorpe Shark Hotel', comprising 90-rooms converted from [[shipping container]]s with a link to facilities in the adjacent Dome. The accommodation takes its name from its shark head entrance feature built from scrapped park signage.\n\nThe hotel initially opened in 2013 as 'The Crash Pad', run by external company [[Snoozebox]]. The temporary development was purchased by the park the following year and rebranded as the Thorpe Shark Hotel.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sim|first1=Nick|title=Thorpe Park names new hotel for 2014 as Thorpe Shark Hotel|url=http://www.themeparktourist.com/news/20140313/16793/thorpe-park-names-new-hotel-2014-thorpe-shark-hotel|website=Theme Park Tourist|accessdate=18 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nThorpe Park had originally been planning to build a permanent 250-bed hotel as far back as 2006. This would have been located on the opposite side of the lake, on the site of former excavation works, featuring a lakeside bar, health club and restaurant.\n\nThe development was pitched again following the installation of 'The Crash Pad' to \"test market conditions\". The park received planning permission to construct the permanent hotel in 2014, with construction planned to begin in 2016 and an opening in 2018. However, the hotel was never constructed and the Shark Hotel's planning permission was extended by 10 years instead.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Total Thorpe Park|first1=|title=Thorpe Park Hotel planning|url=http://www.totalthorpepark.co.uk/features/futurehotel.shtml|website=Theme Park Tourist|accessdate=21 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Developments ==\n\nIn 2010, the park outlined a 5-year development plan that outlined new coasters for 2012 (The Swarm) and 2015, as well as a permanent lakeside hotel. No application was ever submitted for the 2015 development and the intended site of coaster behind The Swarm remains vacant.\n\n==Incidents==\n{{Main|Incidents at European amusement parks#Thorpe Park|l1=Incidents at European amusement parks: Thorpe Park}}\n\n==Gallery==\n\n:''Main gallery: [[commons:Thorpe Park Resort|Thorpe Park Resort at WikiCommons]]''\n<!-- If possible, use only pictures unique to this park.

According to legend, this Buddha image originated in [[India]] where the sage [[Nagasena]] prophesied that the Emerald Buddha would bring \"prosperity and pre-eminence to each country in which it resides\". The Emerald Buddha deified in the Wat Phra Kaew is therefore deeply revered and venerated in Thailand as the protector of the country. Historical records date its finding to the 15th century in [[Chiang Rai]] where, after it was relocated a number of times, it was finally brought to Thailand in the 18th century. It was enshrined in Bangkok at the Wat Phra Kaew Temple in 1782 during the reign of [[Phutthayotfa Chulalok|Phutthayotfa Chulalok, King Rama I]] (1782\u20131809). This marked the beginning of the [[Chakri dynasty]] of [[Thailand]], whose current sovereign is [[Vajiralongkorn|Vajiralongkorn, King Rama X]].\n\nThe Emerald Buddha, a dark green statue, is in a standing form, about {{convert|66|cm|in}} tall, carved from a single jade stone (\"emerald\" in Thai means deep green colour and not the specific stone). It is carved in the meditating posture in the style of the [[Lanna]] school of northern Thailand. Except for the Thai King and, in his stead, the crown prince, no other persons are allowed to touch the statue. The king changes the cloak around the statue three times a year, corresponding to the summer, winter, and rainy seasons, an important ritual performed to bring good fortune to the country during each season.<ref name=Roeder-1999>{{Cite journal|last=Roeder |first=Eric|url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/2542/The%20Origin%20and%20Significance%20of%20the%20Emerald%20Buddha.pdf?sequence=1|title=The Origin and Significance of the Emerald Buddha|accessdate=2014-09-22|journal=Explorations in Southeast Asian Studies|volume=3|year=1999}}</ref><ref name=parka/><ref name=Sacred/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e28\u0e23\u0e35\u0e23\u0e31\u0e15\u0e19\u0e28\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e14\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e21 \u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e41\u0e01\u0e49\u0e27 \u0e01\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23 - Wat Phra Kaew, Temple of Emerald Buddha, Bangkok, Thailand.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance to the Royal Pantheon, constructed by Rama IV in 1856]]\n\nIn 1767, the Kingdom of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] fell to the Burmese, and [[King Taksin]] then moved the capital to [[Thonburi Kingdom|Thonburi]] where he built the [[Phra Racha Wang Derm|old palace]] beside [[Wat Arun]] on the west bank of [[Chao Phraya River]].

The Buddha statue fell down and later became chipped, and the monks, after removing the [[stucco]] around the statue, discovered that the image was a perfectly made Buddha image from a solid piece of green jade. The image was moved a few time to various temples, first to [[Lampang]], then to [[Chiang Mai]], from where it was removed by prince Chao [[Setthathirath|Chaiyasetthathirat]] to [[Luang Prabang]], when his father died and he ascended the throne of both [[Lanna]] and [[Lan Xang]], in 1551. The statue remained the it to his new capital of [[Lan Xang]] in Vientiane in the 1560s. The statue remained there for twelve years. King Chaiyasetthathirat then shifted it to his new capital of [[Lan Xang]] in Vientiane in the 1560s. He took the Emerald Buddha with him and the image remained in Vientiane for 214 years until 1778.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nIn the reign of King Taksin, Chao Phraya Chakri (who later became [[Rama I]]) defeated [[Vientiane]] and moved the Emerald Buddha from Vientiane to Thonburi where it was installed in a shrine close to [[Wat Arun]]. When Chao Phra Chakri took over the throne and founded the [[Chakri Dynasty]] of the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]], he shifted his capital across the river to its present location in Bangkok. The Emerald Buddha was also moved across the river with pomp and pageantry and installed in the temple of Wat Phra Keaw.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" /><ref name=Sacred/>\n\n===Legends===\nThere a number of legends associated with the Emerald Buddha.  It was said the iconic image of the Emerald Buddha was made by [[Nagasena]], a saint in [[Pataliputra]] (present day [[Patna]]), India, who, with the help of Hindu god Vishnu and demigod Indra, had the Emerald Buddha image made. Nagasena predicted that:<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" /><blockquote>\nThe image of the Buddha is assuredly going to give to religion the most brilliant importance in five lands, that is in Lankadvipa ([[Sri Lanka]]), Ramalakka, [[Dvaravati]], [[Chieng Mai]] and [[Lan Xang|Lan Chang]] ([[Laos]]).</blockquote>\n\nThe Emerald Buddha image was taken to Sri Lanka after three hundred years in Pataliputra to save it during a civil war. In 457, King Anuruth of [[Myanmar|Burma]] sent a mission to [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] with a request for [[Buddhist scriptures]] and the Emerald Buddha, in order to promote Buddhism in his country. These requests were granted, but the ship lost its way in a storm during the return voyage and landed in [[Cambodia]]. When the Thais captured [[Angkor Wat]] in 1432 (following the ravage of the [[bubonic plague]]), the Emerald Buddha was taken to Ayutthaya, [[Kamphaeng Phet]], [[Laos]] and finally [[Chiang Rai]], where the ruler of the city hid it, and was later found.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" />\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:A view of the temple of the Emerald Buddha.JPG|left|thumb|300px|Temple of the Emerald Buddha]]\n\nWat Phra Kaew has a number of buildings in the precincts of the Grand Palace that covers a total area of over {{convert|94.5|ha|acre}}. It has over 100 buildings with \"200 years royal history and architectural experimentation\" linked to it. The architectural style is named as [[Rattanakosin style]] (old Bangkok-style). The main temple of the Emerald Buddha is decorated and similar to the temple in ancient capital of [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]]. The roof is embellished with polished orange and green tiles, the pillars are inlaid with [[mosaic]]s and the [[pediment]]s are made of marble, installed in the 18th century. The Emerald Buddha reposes on an elevated altar surrounded by large gilded decorations. While the upper part of this altar was part of the original construction, the base was added by [[King Rama III]]. Two images of the Buddha, that represent the first two kings of the Chakri dynasty, flank the main image. Over the years, the temple has retained its original design. Minor improvements have been made after its construction during Rama I's reign: temple woodwork  was replaced by King Rama III and King Chulalongkorn; during [[King Mongkut]]'s reign, the doors and windows and the copper plates on the floor were added; Rama III refurbished the wall painting (indicative of the universe according to [[Buddhist cosmology]]) and several frescos that display various stages of the Buddha's life; three chambers were added on the west side by King Mongkut; in the chamber known as ''Phra Kromanusorn'' at the north end, images of Buddha have been installed in honour of the kings of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]]; and in the 19th century, [[Khrua In Khong]], a famous painter, created the wall murals.

The image made with a circular base has a smooth top-knot that is finished with a \"dulled point marking at the top of the image\". A third eye made in gold is inset over the elevated eyebrows of the image. The image appears divine and composed, with the eyes cast downward.

It is about {{convert|2|km|ft}} in length. The compound walls are decorated with Thai murals, based on the [[Indian epic]] [[Ramayana]]. In the [[Thai language]] these murals are known to form the [[Ramakian]], the Thai national epic that was written during the reign of Rama I. These stories formed the basis for the paintings made during the reign of King [[Rama I]] (1782\u20131809). These paintings are refurbished regularly. The murals, in 178 scenes starting from the north gate of the temple, illustrates the complete epic story of Ramayana sequentially, in a clockwise direction covering the entire compound wall. The murals serve to emphasise human values of honesty, faith, and devotion.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" /><ref name=Sacred/><ref name=Williams/><ref name=photo/>\n\nThere are twelve [[Sala (architecture)|salas]], built by Rama I, around the temple. They house interesting artefacts of regions such as Cambodia and [[Java]]. One of these salas had an inscription of [[Ramkhamhaeng University|Ramkamhaeng]] that was moved, in 1924, to the National Library. During the reign of [[King Mongkut]], the Phra Gandharara, a small chapel at the southwest corner, and a tall belfry were added.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" />\n\n==Worship and ceremonies==\n[[File:Wat Phra Kaew.jpg|thumb|left|A group of Buddhist monks at the Wat Phra Kaew temple]]\n\nEarly in the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom (1782\u20131932)|Bangkok period]], the Emerald Buddha was removed from the temple and paraded in the streets to relieve the city and countryside of various calamities (such as [[Plague (disease)|plague]] and [[cholera]]). However, this practice was discontinued during [[Rama IV]]'s reign as it was feared that the image could get damaged during the procession and also a practical line of thinking that Rama IV held \"that diseases are caused by germs, not by evil spirits or the displeasure of the Buddha\". The image also marks the changing of the seasons in Thailand, with the king presiding over the seasonal ceremonies.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" />\n\nLike many other Buddha statues in Thailand, the Emerald Buddha is dressed in a seasonal costume. It is a significant ritual held at this temple. In this ritual, dress of the deity is changed three times a year to correspond to the seasons. In summer it is a pointed crown of gold and jewels, and a set of jewelled ornaments that adorns the image from the shoulders to the ankles. In winter, a meshed dressing gown or drapery made of gold beads that covered from the neck down like a [[poncho]] is used. During the rainy months, a top-knot headdress studded with gold, enamel and sapphires; the gold attire in the rainy season is draped over the left shoulder of the deity, only with the right shoulder left bare while gold ornaments embellish the image up to the ankles. The astrological dates for the ritual ceremonies, at the changing of the seasons, followed are in the 1st [[waning moon]] of [[lunar months]] 4, 8 and 12 (around March, July and November). The costume change ritual is performed by the Thai king who is the highest master of ceremonies for all Buddhist rites. On each occasion, the king himself  \"cleans the image by wiping away any dust that has collected and changing the headdress of the image\". Then a king's royal attendant climbs up and performs the elaborate ritual of changing garments of the image as the king is chanting prayers to the deity. On this occasion, the king sprinkles water over the monks and the faithful who have assembled to witness the unique ritual and seeks blessings of the deity for good fortune during the upcoming season. The two sets of clothing not in use at any given time are kept on display in the nearby [[Pavilion of Regalia, Royal Decorations and Coins]] in the precincts of the Grand Palace. While Rama I initiated this ritual for the hot season and the rainy season, Rama III introduced the ritual for the winter season.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" /><ref name=Sacred/> The robes that the image adorns, represents that of monks and King's depending on the season, a clear indication of highlighting its symbolic role \"as Buddha and the King\", which role is also enjoined on the Thai King who formally dresses the Emerald Buddha image.<ref name=Kleiner/>\n\n[[File:Rama9insigwpk0609.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Monument with insignia of [[King Rama IX]] showing the Octagonal Throne with a ''[[chakra]]'' with Thai numeral 9 inside and a [[Umbrella|seven-tiered Umbrella of State]]]]\nA ceremony that is observed in the wat is the Chakri Day (begun on 6 April 1782), a national holiday to honour founding of the [[Chakri dynasty]]. On this day, the king attends the ceremony. The former king [[Rama IX]], with his Queen, and entourage of the royal family, the Prime Minister, officials in the Ministry of Defence, and other government departments, first offered prayers at the Emerald Buddha temple. This was followed by visit to the pantheon to pay homage to the images of past Chakri rulers that are installed there.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" />\n\nThe [[Coronation of the Thai monarch]] is an important event of the Chakri dynasty. One such event took place when Rama IX was crowned the king. On this occasion, the king came to the Chapel Royal, Wat Phra Keo, in a procession wearing a \"great crown\". After entering the chapel, the king made offerings of gold and silver flowers to the deity and also lighted candles. He also paid homage to the images of Buddha that represented past kings of the dynasty. In the presence of assembled elite clergy of the kingdom, he took a formal vow of his religion and his commitment to defend the faith.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" />\n\n==Rules of entry and conduct==\nThe sacred temples in Thailand follow a dress code that is strictly followed. Men must wear long trousers and sleeved shirts and shoes; women must wear long skirts. Visitors who arrive dressed otherwise may rent appropriate clothing items at the entry area of the temple. It is compulsory to remove the shoes before entering the temple, as a sign of respect of the Buddha, as is the practice in all other temples in Thailand. While offering prayers before the Buddha image, the sitting posture should avoid any offensive stretching of feet towards the deity; the feet should be tucked in towards the back.<ref name=Williams>{{Cite book|last=Williams|first=China|author2=Aaron Anderson |author3=Brett Atkinson |author4=Becca Blond |author5=Tim Bewer |title= Thailand|page=126|accessdate=2010-03-27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oc0LoROKM0MC&pg=PA126#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher= Lonely Planet|year=2010|isbn= 9781742203850}}</ref>\n\n==Other monuments==\nWhile the surrounding portico of the shrine is an example of Thai craftsmanship, the perimeter of the temple complex has 12 open pavilions.

These are:\n\n;Pagodas\n[[File:Golden Chedi in Wat Phra Kaew.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Phra Sri Rattana [[stupa|Chedi]] in Sri Lankan style]]\nThe temple grounds also depict three pagodas to its immediate north that represent the changing centres of Buddhist influence. One such shrine to the west of the temple is the Phra Si Ratana Chedi, a 19th-century stupa built in Sri Lankan style enshrining ashes of the Buddha.<ref name=Sacred/>\n\n;The Library\n[[File:The Grand Palace (8281348373).jpg|thumb|right|Phra Mondop, the library]]\nRama I also built a library in Thai style, in the middle of the complex, known as the \"Phra Mondop\". The library houses an elegantly carved Ayutthaya-style [[mother-of-pearl]] doors, bookcases with the [[Tripitaka]] (sacred Buddhist manuscripts), human-and dragon-headed nagas (snakes), and images of [[Chakri kings]].<ref name=Sacred/>\n\nDuring the 19th century, the Royal Pantheon was built in [[Khmer style]] to the east of the temple that is kept open for only one day in year, in the month of October to commemorate the founding of the [[Chakri dynasty]].<ref name=Sacred/>\n\n;Model of Angkor Wat\nThe temple complex also contains a model of [[Angkor Wat]] (the most sacred of all Cambodian shrines). In 1860, King [[Mongkut]] ordered his generals to lead 2,000 men to dismantle Angkor Wat and take it to Bangkok. Modern scholars suggested that the king wanted to show that Siam was still in control of Cambodia, as France was seeking to [[French Protectorate of Cambodia|colonise Cambodia]] at that time. However, the king's order could not be fulfilled. A royal chronicle written by [[Chaophraya Thiphakorawong]], then foreign minister, recorded that many Thai men fell ill after entering Cambodian wilderness. The chronicle also stated that forest-dwelling [[Khmer people]] ambushed the Thai army, killing many leading generals. King Mongkut then ordered the construction of the model within Wat Phra Kaew, instead of the real Angkor Wat that could not be brought to Bangkok. Mongkut died before he could see the model. Its construction was completed in the reign of his son, [[Chulalongkorn]].<ref>{{cite book | author = [[Charnvit Kasetsiri]] | script-title=th:\u0e42\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e14\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e23\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e17\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e21 |trans-title=Relocating a Khmer temple | year = 2009 | language = Thai | pages = 3\u20134 | location = Bangkok | publisher = Foundation for the Promotion of Social Sciences and Humanities Textbooks Project | format = pdf | url = http://www.openbase.in.th/files/tbpj174.pdf }}</ref>\n\n;Hermit statue\nA hermit's bronze image, that is believed to have healing powers is installed in a sala on the western side of the temple.

The Emerald Buddha deified in the Wat Phra Kaew is therefore deeply revered and venerated in Thailand as the protector of the country. Historical records date its finding to the 15th century in [[Chiang Rai]] where, after it was relocated a number of times, it was finally brought to Thailand in the 18th century. It was enshrined in Bangkok at the Wat Phra Kaew Temple in 1782 during the reign of [[Phutthayotfa Chulalok|Phutthayotfa Chulalok, King Rama I]] (1782\u20131809).

It is carved in the meditating posture in the style of the [[Lanna]] school of northern Thailand. Except for the Thai King and, in his stead, the crown prince, no other persons are allowed to touch the statue.

The Buddha statue fell down and later became chipped, and the monks, after removing the [[stucco]] around the statue, discovered that the image was a perfectly made Buddha image from a solid piece of green jade. The image was moved a few time to various temples, first to [[Lampang]], then to [[Chiang Mai]], from where it was removed by prince Chao [[Setthathirath|Chaiyasetthathirat]] to [[Luang Prabang]], when his father died and he ascended the throne of both [[Lanna]] and [[Lan Xang]], in 1551. The statue remained the it to his new capital of [[Lan Xang]] in Vientiane in the 1560s. The statue remained there for twelve years. King Chaiyasetthathirat then shifted it to his new capital of [[Lan Xang]] in Vientiane in the 1560s. He took the Emerald Buddha with him and the image remained in Vientiane for 214 years until 1778.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nIn the reign of King Taksin, Chao Phraya Chakri (who later became [[Rama I]]) defeated [[Vientiane]] and moved the Emerald Buddha from Vientiane to Thonburi where it was installed in a shrine close to [[Wat Arun]]. When Chao Phra Chakri took over the throne and founded the [[Chakri Dynasty]] of the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]], he shifted his capital across the river to its present location in Bangkok. The Emerald Buddha was also moved across the river with pomp and pageantry and installed in the temple of Wat Phra Keaw.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" /><ref name=Sacred/>\n\n===Legends===\nThere a number of legends associated with the Emerald Buddha.  It was said the iconic image of the Emerald Buddha was made by [[Nagasena]], a saint in [[Pataliputra]] (present day [[Patna]]), India, who, with the help of Hindu god Vishnu and demigod Indra, had the Emerald Buddha image made. Nagasena predicted that:<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" /><blockquote>\nThe image of the Buddha is assuredly going to give to religion the most brilliant importance in five lands, that is in Lankadvipa ([[Sri Lanka]]), Ramalakka, [[Dvaravati]], [[Chieng Mai]] and [[Lan Xang|Lan Chang]] ([[Laos]]).</blockquote>\n\nThe Emerald Buddha image was taken to Sri Lanka after three hundred years in Pataliputra to save it during a civil war. In 457, King Anuruth of [[Myanmar|Burma]] sent a mission to [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] with a request for [[Buddhist scriptures]] and the Emerald Buddha, in order to promote Buddhism in his country. These requests were granted, but the ship lost its way in a storm during the return voyage and landed in [[Cambodia]]. When the Thais captured [[Angkor Wat]] in 1432 (following the ravage of the [[bubonic plague]]), the Emerald Buddha was taken to Ayutthaya, [[Kamphaeng Phet]], [[Laos]] and finally [[Chiang Rai]], where the ruler of the city hid it, and was later found.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" />\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:A view of the temple of the Emerald Buddha.JPG|left|thumb|300px|Temple of the Emerald Buddha]]\n\nWat Phra Kaew has a number of buildings in the precincts of the Grand Palace that covers a total area of over {{convert|94.5|ha|acre}}. It has over 100 buildings with \"200 years royal history and architectural experimentation\" linked to it. The architectural style is named as [[Rattanakosin style]] (old Bangkok-style). The main temple of the Emerald Buddha is decorated and similar to the temple in ancient capital of [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]]. The roof is embellished with polished orange and green tiles, the pillars are inlaid with [[mosaic]]s and the [[pediment]]s are made of marble, installed in the 18th century. The Emerald Buddha reposes on an elevated altar surrounded by large gilded decorations. While the upper part of this altar was part of the original construction, the base was added by [[King Rama III]]. Two images of the Buddha, that represent the first two kings of the Chakri dynasty, flank the main image. Over the years, the temple has retained its original design. Minor improvements have been made after its construction during Rama I's reign: temple woodwork  was replaced by King Rama III and King Chulalongkorn; during [[King Mongkut]]'s reign, the doors and windows and the copper plates on the floor were added; Rama III refurbished the wall painting (indicative of the universe according to [[Buddhist cosmology]]) and several frescos that display various stages of the Buddha's life; three chambers were added on the west side by King Mongkut; in the chamber known as ''Phra Kromanusorn'' at the north end, images of Buddha have been installed in honour of the kings of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]]; and in the 19th century, [[Khrua In Khong]], a famous painter, created the wall murals.

It is about {{convert|2|km|ft}} in length. The compound walls are decorated with Thai murals, based on the [[Indian epic]] [[Ramayana]]. In the [[Thai language]] these murals are known to form the [[Ramakian]], the Thai national epic that was written during the reign of Rama I. These stories formed the basis for the paintings made during the reign of King [[Rama I]] (1782\u20131809). These paintings are refurbished regularly. The murals, in 178 scenes starting from the north gate of the temple, illustrates the complete epic story of Ramayana sequentially, in a clockwise direction covering the entire compound wall. The murals serve to emphasise human values of honesty, faith, and devotion.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" /><ref name=Sacred/><ref name=Williams/><ref name=photo/>\n\nThere are twelve [[Sala (architecture)|salas]], built by Rama I, around the temple.

During the reign of [[King Mongkut]], the Phra Gandharara, a small chapel at the southwest corner, and a tall belfry were added.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" />\n\n==Worship and ceremonies==\n[[File:Wat Phra Kaew.jpg|thumb|left|A group of Buddhist monks at the Wat Phra Kaew temple]]\n\nEarly in the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom (1782\u20131932)|Bangkok period]], the Emerald Buddha was removed from the temple and paraded in the streets to relieve the city and countryside of various calamities (such as [[Plague (disease)|plague]] and [[cholera]]). However, this practice was discontinued during [[Rama IV]]'s reign as it was feared that the image could get damaged during the procession and also a practical line of thinking that Rama IV held \"that diseases are caused by germs, not by evil spirits or the displeasure of the Buddha\". The image also marks the changing of the seasons in Thailand, with the king presiding over the seasonal ceremonies.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" />\n\nLike many other Buddha statues in Thailand, the Emerald Buddha is dressed in a seasonal costume. It is a significant ritual held at this temple. In this ritual, dress of the deity is changed three times a year to correspond to the seasons. In summer it is a pointed crown of gold and jewels, and a set of jewelled ornaments that adorns the image from the shoulders to the ankles. In winter, a meshed dressing gown or drapery made of gold beads that covered from the neck down like a [[poncho]] is used. During the rainy months, a top-knot headdress studded with gold, enamel and sapphires; the gold attire in the rainy season is draped over the left shoulder of the deity, only with the right shoulder left bare while gold ornaments embellish the image up to the ankles. The astrological dates for the ritual ceremonies, at the changing of the seasons, followed are in the 1st [[waning moon]] of [[lunar months]] 4, 8 and 12 (around March, July and November). The costume change ritual is performed by the Thai king who is the highest master of ceremonies for all Buddhist rites. On each occasion, the king himself  \"cleans the image by wiping away any dust that has collected and changing the headdress of the image\". Then a king's royal attendant climbs up and performs the elaborate ritual of changing garments of the image as the king is chanting prayers to the deity. On this occasion, the king sprinkles water over the monks and the faithful who have assembled to witness the unique ritual and seeks blessings of the deity for good fortune during the upcoming season. The two sets of clothing not in use at any given time are kept on display in the nearby [[Pavilion of Regalia, Royal Decorations and Coins]] in the precincts of the Grand Palace. While Rama I initiated this ritual for the hot season and the rainy season, Rama III introduced the ritual for the winter season.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" /><ref name=Sacred/> The robes that the image adorns, represents that of monks and King's depending on the season, a clear indication of highlighting its symbolic role \"as Buddha and the King\", which role is also enjoined on the Thai King who formally dresses the Emerald Buddha image.<ref name=Kleiner/>\n\n[[File:Rama9insigwpk0609.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Monument with insignia of [[King Rama IX]] showing the Octagonal Throne with a ''[[chakra]]'' with Thai numeral 9 inside and a [[Umbrella|seven-tiered Umbrella of State]]]]\nA ceremony that is observed in the wat is the Chakri Day (begun on 6 April 1782), a national holiday to honour founding of the [[Chakri dynasty]]. On this day, the king attends the ceremony. The former king [[Rama IX]], with his Queen, and entourage of the royal family, the Prime Minister, officials in the Ministry of Defence, and other government departments, first offered prayers at the Emerald Buddha temple. This was followed by visit to the pantheon to pay homage to the images of past Chakri rulers that are installed there.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" />\n\nThe [[Coronation of the Thai monarch]] is an important event of the Chakri dynasty. One such event took place when Rama IX was crowned the king. On this occasion, the king came to the Chapel Royal, Wat Phra Keo, in a procession wearing a \"great crown\". After entering the chapel, the king made offerings of gold and silver flowers to the deity and also lighted candles. He also paid homage to the images of Buddha that represented past kings of the dynasty. In the presence of assembled elite clergy of the kingdom, he took a formal vow of his religion and his commitment to defend the faith.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" />\n\n==Rules of entry and conduct==\nThe sacred temples in Thailand follow a dress code that is strictly followed. Men must wear long trousers and sleeved shirts and shoes; women must wear long skirts. Visitors who arrive dressed otherwise may rent appropriate clothing items at the entry area of the temple. It is compulsory to remove the shoes before entering the temple, as a sign of respect of the Buddha, as is the practice in all other temples in Thailand. While offering prayers before the Buddha image, the sitting posture should avoid any offensive stretching of feet towards the deity; the feet should be tucked in towards the back.<ref name=Williams>{{Cite book|last=Williams|first=China|author2=Aaron Anderson |author3=Brett Atkinson |author4=Becca Blond |author5=Tim Bewer |title= Thailand|page=126|accessdate=2010-03-27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oc0LoROKM0MC&pg=PA126#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher= Lonely Planet|year=2010|isbn= 9781742203850}}</ref>\n\n==Other monuments==\nWhile the surrounding portico of the shrine is an example of Thai craftsmanship, the perimeter of the temple complex has 12 open pavilions. These were built during the reign of Rama I.<ref name=Sacred/> There is plethora of monuments in the temple complex. These are:\n\n;Pagodas\n[[File:Golden Chedi in Wat Phra Kaew.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Phra Sri Rattana [[stupa|Chedi]] in Sri Lankan style]]\nThe temple grounds also depict three pagodas to its immediate north that represent the changing centres of Buddhist influence. One such shrine to the west of the temple is the Phra Si Ratana Chedi, a 19th-century stupa built in Sri Lankan style enshrining ashes of the Buddha.<ref name=Sacred/>\n\n;The Library\n[[File:The Grand Palace (8281348373).jpg|thumb|right|Phra Mondop, the library]]\nRama I also built a library in Thai style, in the middle of the complex, known as the \"Phra Mondop\". The library houses an elegantly carved Ayutthaya-style [[mother-of-pearl]] doors, bookcases with the [[Tripitaka]] (sacred Buddhist manuscripts), human-and dragon-headed nagas (snakes), and images of [[Chakri kings]].<ref name=Sacred/>\n\nDuring the 19th century, the Royal Pantheon was built in [[Khmer style]] to the east of the temple that is kept open for only one day in year, in the month of October to commemorate the founding of the [[Chakri dynasty]].<ref name=Sacred/>\n\n;Model of Angkor Wat\nThe temple complex also contains a model of [[Angkor Wat]] (the most sacred of all Cambodian shrines). In 1860, King [[Mongkut]] ordered his generals to lead 2,000 men to dismantle Angkor Wat and take it to Bangkok. Modern scholars suggested that the king wanted to show that Siam was still in control of Cambodia, as France was seeking to [[French Protectorate of Cambodia|colonise Cambodia]] at that time. However, the king's order could not be fulfilled. A royal chronicle written by [[Chaophraya Thiphakorawong]], then foreign minister, recorded that many Thai men fell ill after entering Cambodian wilderness. The chronicle also stated that forest-dwelling [[Khmer people]] ambushed the Thai army, killing many leading generals. King Mongkut then ordered the construction of the model within Wat Phra Kaew, instead of the real Angkor Wat that could not be brought to Bangkok. Mongkut died before he could see the model. Its construction was completed in the reign of his son, [[Chulalongkorn]].<ref>{{cite book | author = [[Charnvit Kasetsiri]] | script-title=th:\u0e42\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e14\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e23\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e17\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e21 |trans-title=Relocating a Khmer temple | year = 2009 | language = Thai | pages = 3\u20134 | location = Bangkok | publisher = Foundation for the Promotion of Social Sciences and Humanities Textbooks Project | format = pdf | url = http://www.openbase.in.th/files/tbpj174.pdf }}</ref>\n\n;Hermit statue\nA hermit's bronze image, that is believed to have healing powers is installed in a sala on the western side of the temple. It is near the entry gate. It is a black stone statue, considered a patron of medicine, before which relatives of the sick and infirm pay respects and make offerings of joss sticks, fruit, flowers, and candles.<ref name=\"Roeder-1999\" /><ref name=Sacred/>\n\n;Eight towers\nOn the eastern side of the temple premises there are eight towers or [[prang (architecture)|prang]]s, each of a different colour.

As Thai kings fought wars mounted on elephants, it has become customary for parents to make their children circumambulate the elephant three times with the belief that it would bring them strength. The head of an elephant statue is also rubbed for good luck; this act of the people is reflected in the smoothness of the surface of elephant statues here.<ref name=Sacred/>\n\n==Map==\n{{Map of Wat Phra Kaew}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nImage:Wat Phra Kaew Building photo D Ramey Logan.jpg| A Wat Phra Kaew Inner Compound Structure\nImage:Bangkok statue.jpg|Thotsakhirithon (\u0e17\u0e28\u0e04\u0e35\u0e23\u0e35\u0e18\u0e23), giant demon ([[Yaksha]]) guarding an exit to Grand Palace\nImage:Kinnon_Wat_Phra_Kaew_02.jpg|[[Kinnara|Kinare]] \u2013 mythological creature, half bird, half man\nImage:Bangkok Wat Phra Kaew golden statue.jpg|Detail of a kinnara-statue\nImage:Garudakaryatid98.jpg|[[Garuda]] and [[N\u0101ga|Nagas]], at the outside of the [[ubosot]]\nImage:Tantima birds in Wat Phra Kaew.JPG|[[Nok Tantima]] (\u0e19\u0e01\u0e15\u0e31\u0e19\u0e15\u0e34\u0e21\u0e32) or [[Tantima bird]], guarding the Viharn Yod\nImage:Temple of the Emerald Buddha 2012.JPG| Wat Phra Kaew from entrance\nImage:Phra Mondop in Wat Phra Kaew 2015.JPG|Phra Mondop (the library) and Phra Sri Rattana Chedi\nImage:Gran Palacio, Bangkok, Tailandia, 2013-08-22, DD 14.jpg|[[N\u0101ga]] at the entrance to Phra Mondop\nImage:Gran Palacio, Bangkok, Tailandia, 2013-08-22, DD 06.jpg|Entrance to Phra Mondop\nImage:Wat Phra Kaew Temple and Stupa.JPG| View of the Temple of [[Emerald Buddha]] and Golden Stupa\nImage:Gran Palacio, Bangkok, Tailandia, 2013-08-22, DD 24.jpg|Royal Pantheon of Wat Phra Kaew\nImage:A Row of Prangs in Wat Phra Kaew.JPG|A row of prangs in Wat Phra Kaew\nImage:\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e07\u0e32\u0e21\u0e22\u0e32\u0e21\u0e04\u0e48\u0e33\u0e04\u0e37\u0e19.JPG|Wat Phra Kaew at night\nFile:Wat Prah 10.jpg|Interior View\nFile:Gran Palacio, Bangkok, Tailandia, 2013-08-22, DD 21.jpg|Golden Chedi\nFile:Kinnon Wat Phra Kaew.jpeg|Statue of a ''kinnara''\nFile:Wat_Phra_Kaew_entrance_photo_D_Ramey_Logan.jpg|Entrance\nFile:Watphrakaeomap.png|Map\nFile:\u0e2b\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e30\u0e06\u0e31\u0e07 \u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e23\u0e21\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e27\u0e31\u0e07 \u0e01\u0e23\u0e38\u0e07\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23 \u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22.jpg|[[Bell tower (wat)|Bell tower]] (belfry), front view, at Wat Phra Kaew\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Thailand|Religion|Architecture}}\n{{commons+cat|Wat Phra Kaew}}\n* [[Wat Pho]] (Temple of the Reclining Buddha)\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|26em}}\n\n{{Rattanakosin|state=collapsed}}\n{{Visitor attractions in Bangkok}}\n\n[[Category:Buddhist temples in Bangkok|Phra Kaew]]\n[[Category:Buddhist pilgrimage sites in Thailand]]\n[[Category:Phra Nakhon District]]\n[[Category:18th-century Buddhist temples|Phra Kaew]]\n[[Category:Religious buildings and structures completed in 1784]]\n[[Category:1784 establishments in Siam]]\n[[Category:1780s in Siam]]\n[[Category:Rattanakosin Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Grand Palace]]\n", "name_user": "Paul 012", "label": "safe", "comment": "fix link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Phra_Kaew"}
