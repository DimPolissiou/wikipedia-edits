Each dog has a specific set of skills based on [[emergency services]] professions, such as a [[firefighter]], a [[police officer]], and an [[aircraft pilot|aviation pilot]]. They all reside in [[doghouse]]s that transform into customized [[vehicles]] for their missions. They are also equipped with backpacks called \"pup packs\" that contain tools that relate to the pups' jobs.\n\nSpin Master has developed the show into a [[media franchise]] and released an ongoing line of toys based on it. ''PAW Patrol'' toy sales have generated millions of dollars in revenue for the corporation and increased Spin Master's presence in the preschool toy market.<ref name=\"financialpost\">{{cite web|url=http://business.financialpost.com/investing/market-moves/paw-patrol-has-spin-master-on-a-roll-as-earnings-exceed-analyst-expectations|title=PAW Patrol has Spin Master on a roll as earnings exceed analyst expectations|work=[[Financial Post]]|publisher=[[Sun Media]]|date=May 16, 2016|author=Damon van der Linde|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902211158/http://business.financialpost.com/investing/market-moves/paw-patrol-has-spin-master-on-a-roll-as-earnings-exceed-analyst-expectations|archivedate=2 September 2016}}</ref> The show, and its associated products, have received a variety of awards and nominations from associations such as the [[Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television]] and the [[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]].\n\nOn June 4, 2019, the series was renewed for a seventh season of 26 half hour episodes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nickelodeon Renews Four Hit Series from Its Powerhouse Preschool Portfolio|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2019/06/04/nickelodeon-renews-four-hit-series-from-its-powerhouse-preschool-portfolio-291402/20190604nickelodeon01/|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=June 4, 2019}}</ref> In the United States, select episodes are available to stream on [[Noggin (brand)#Mobile applications|Noggin]], for free with [[TV Everywhere]] authentication on Nickelodeon's app and with a public library card through the [[Hoopla (digital media service)|Hoopla]] app.\n\nOn February 19, 2020, the series was renewed for an eighth season of 26 half hour episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2020/02/nickelodeon-renewals-are-you-afraid-of-the-dark-all-that-paw-patrol-blues-clues-the-casagrandes-top-elf-1202862741/|title='Are You Afraid Of The Dark?', 'All That', 'Top Elf,' 'Blue\u2019s Clues', 'The Casagrandes' & 'PAW Patrol' Among Slew Of Nickelodeon Renewals|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|author=Patrick Hipes|date=February 19, 2020|access-date=February 19, 2020}}</ref> A theatrical feature film, titled ''[[PAW Patrol: The Movie]]'', is scheduled for an August 2021 release.\n\n==Format==\nEach episode of ''PAW Patrol'' follows a similar pattern and features recurring topics. Episodes normally open with a scene depicting the dogs going about their everyday lives, often playing with [[dog toy]]s or engaging in activities at the local playground. Ryder, a ten-year-old boy, is advised of a problem by receiving a call for help or by witnessing a situation himself. His most frequent caller is an accident-prone [[marine biology|marine biologist]] named Cap'n Turbot, who knows much about Adventure Bay's wildlife. Ryder always alerts the dogs via their blinking [[pet tag]]s. The team members report to their base, the Lookout, and enter its elevator. Marshall typically arrives last causing a humorous mishap that makes the other dogs laugh as the elevator rises. When they reach the top floor, they arrange themselves in a line. Chase announces that the team is ready for action as Ryder tells the pups what has happened. He chooses several members of the team, normally two [[first responder]]s, to help solve whatever problem has emerged. They ride a slide down to their vehicles and complete their mission. When they have finished, Ryder says his catchphrase: \"Whenever you're in trouble, just yelp for help!\", and congratulates the pups.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of PAW Patrol episodes}}\n{{:List of PAW Patrol episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n\n===PAW Patrol members===\n[[File:PAW Patrol main characters, cast promo art.png|thumb|right|The illustrated designs of the entire PAW Patrol team as of Tracker's introduction.]]\n\n====Original members====\n* {{visible anchor|Ryder}} is a 10-year-old boy and the leader of the PAW Patrol.

Chapman sketched early designs of the PAW Patrol team under the working title ''Raffi & the Rescue Dogs''. Spin Master hired toy designers to develop the format further; after the concept was in place, they began designing merchandise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/business/20141126/hollywood-helps-make-southern-california-center-of-toy-universe|title=Hollywood helps make Southern California center of toy universe|work=[[Daily Breeze]]|publisher=[[Digital First Media]]|date=November 26, 2014|accessdate=August 8, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809074257/http://www.dailybreeze.com/business/20141126/hollywood-helps-make-southern-california-center-of-toy-universe|archive-date=August 9, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nChapman's original pitch focused on the idea that the six PAW Patrol dogs were rescued by Ryder before joining the team. [[Scott Kraft]], the show's first writer, and Jamie Whitney, the show's first director, decided to abandon the rescued dog theme in 2012. The name of the series' protagonist, Ryder, was changed multiple times during production; he was originally called Raffi, Roddy, and Robbie before Spin Master settled on Ryder.\n\n[[File:PAW Patrol original character designs.png|thumb|Early models of the ''PAW Patrol'' pups.]]\nAccording to a 2017 Spin Master interview, \"everything pup-related was debated endlessly: names, sizes, ages, breeds.\"<ref name=\"globeandmail\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/whats-paw-patrols-secret-how-it-captivated-children-and-conquered-theworld/article37417532/|title=What's Paw Patrol's secret?

The visual appearance of Cap'n Turbot, mainly his distinctive bead eyes and large nose, was based on the design of Chapman's Bob the Builder character. Ryder's hairstyle was based on that of Ronnen Harary.<ref name=\"globeandmail\" />\n\nIn January 2012, Spin Master began approaching television broadcasters.

It is produced by [[Spin Master|Spin Master Entertainment]], with animation provided by [[Guru Studio]]. In Canada, the series is primarily broadcast on [[TVOntario]], which first ran previews of the show in August 2013. The series premiered on [[Nickelodeon]] in the United States on August 12, 2013.\n\nThe series focuses on a young boy named Ryder who leads a crew of [[search and rescue dogs]] that call themselves the PAW Patrol. They work together on missions to protect the shoreside community of Adventure Bay. Each dog has a specific set of skills based on [[emergency services]] professions, such as a [[firefighter]], a [[police officer]], and an [[aircraft pilot|aviation pilot]]. They all reside in [[doghouse]]s that transform into customized [[vehicles]] for their missions. They are also equipped with backpacks called \"pup packs\" that contain tools that relate to the pups' jobs.\n\nSpin Master has developed the show into a [[media franchise]] and released an ongoing line of toys based on it. ''PAW Patrol'' toy sales have generated millions of dollars in revenue for the corporation and increased Spin Master's presence in the preschool toy market.<ref name=\"financialpost\">{{cite web|url=http://business.financialpost.com/investing/market-moves/paw-patrol-has-spin-master-on-a-roll-as-earnings-exceed-analyst-expectations|title=PAW Patrol has Spin Master on a roll as earnings exceed analyst expectations|work=[[Financial Post]]|publisher=[[Sun Media]]|date=May 16, 2016|author=Damon van der Linde|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902211158/http://business.financialpost.com/investing/market-moves/paw-patrol-has-spin-master-on-a-roll-as-earnings-exceed-analyst-expectations|archivedate=2 September 2016}}</ref> The show, and its associated products, have received a variety of awards and nominations from associations such as the [[Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television]] and the [[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]].\n\nOn June 4, 2019, the series was renewed for a seventh season of 26 half hour episodes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nickelodeon Renews Four Hit Series from Its Powerhouse Preschool Portfolio|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2019/06/04/nickelodeon-renews-four-hit-series-from-its-powerhouse-preschool-portfolio-291402/20190604nickelodeon01/|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=June 4, 2019}}</ref> In the United States, select episodes are available to stream on [[Noggin (brand)#Mobile applications|Noggin]], for free with [[TV Everywhere]] authentication on Nickelodeon's app and with a public library card through the [[Hoopla (digital media service)|Hoopla]] app.\n\nOn February 19, 2020, the series was renewed for an eighth season of 26 half hour episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2020/02/nickelodeon-renewals-are-you-afraid-of-the-dark-all-that-paw-patrol-blues-clues-the-casagrandes-top-elf-1202862741/|title='Are You Afraid Of The Dark?', 'All That', 'Top Elf,' 'Blue\u2019s Clues', 'The Casagrandes' & 'PAW Patrol' Among Slew Of Nickelodeon Renewals|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|author=Patrick Hipes|date=February 19, 2020|access-date=February 19, 2020}}</ref> A theatrical feature film, titled ''PAW Patrol: The Movie'', is scheduled for an August 2021 release.\n\n==Format==\nEach episode of ''PAW Patrol'' follows a similar pattern and features recurring topics. Episodes normally open with a scene depicting the dogs going about their everyday lives, often playing with [[dog toy]]s or engaging in activities at the local playground. Ryder, a ten-year-old boy, is advised of a problem by receiving a call for help or by witnessing a situation himself. His most frequent caller is an accident-prone [[marine biology|marine biologist]] named Cap'n Turbot, who knows much about Adventure Bay's wildlife. Ryder always alerts the dogs via their blinking [[pet tag]]s. The team members report to their base, the Lookout, and enter its elevator. Marshall typically arrives last causing a humorous mishap that makes the other dogs laugh as the elevator rises. When they reach the top floor, they arrange themselves in a line. Chase announces that the team is ready for action as Ryder tells the pups what has happened. He chooses several members of the team, normally two [[first responder]]s, to help solve whatever problem has emerged. They ride a slide down to their vehicles and complete their mission. When they have finished, Ryder says his catchphrase: \"Whenever you're in trouble, just yelp for help!\", and congratulates the pups.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of PAW Patrol episodes}}\n{{:List of PAW Patrol episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n\n===PAW Patrol members===\n[[File:PAW Patrol main characters, cast promo art.png|thumb|right|The illustrated designs of the entire PAW Patrol team as of Tracker's introduction.]]\n\n====Original members====\n* {{visible anchor|Ryder}} is a 10-year-old boy and the leader of the PAW Patrol.

Chapman sketched early designs of the PAW Patrol team under the working title ''Raffi & the Rescue Dogs''. Spin Master hired toy designers to develop the format further; after the concept was in place, they began designing merchandise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/business/20141126/hollywood-helps-make-southern-california-center-of-toy-universe|title=Hollywood helps make Southern California center of toy universe|work=[[Daily Breeze]]|publisher=[[Digital First Media]]|date=November 26, 2014|accessdate=August 8, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809074257/http://www.dailybreeze.com/business/20141126/hollywood-helps-make-southern-california-center-of-toy-universe|archive-date=August 9, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nChapman's original pitch focused on the idea that the six PAW Patrol dogs were rescued by Ryder before joining the team. [[Scott Kraft]], the show's first writer, and Jamie Whitney, the show's first director, decided to abandon the rescued dog theme in 2012. The name of the series' protagonist, Ryder, was changed multiple times during production; he was originally called Raffi, Roddy, and Robbie before Spin Master settled on Ryder.\n\n[[File:PAW Patrol original character designs.png|thumb|Early models of the ''PAW Patrol'' pups.]]\nAccording to a 2017 Spin Master interview, \"everything pup-related was debated endlessly: names, sizes, ages, breeds.\"<ref name=\"globeandmail\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/whats-paw-patrols-secret-how-it-captivated-children-and-conquered-theworld/article37417532/|title=What's Paw Patrol's secret?

The visual appearance of Cap'n Turbot, mainly his distinctive bead eyes and large nose, was based on the design of Chapman's Bob the Builder character. Ryder's hairstyle was based on that of Ronnen Harary.<ref name=\"globeandmail\" />\n\nIn January 2012, Spin Master began approaching television broadcasters.

It is situated along the eastern bank of the [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]]. The [[Lackawanna River]] runs through the heart of Duryea's boundary. It was incorporated as a borough in 1901, and had an import switching rail yard, the [[Duryea yard]] (or Muller yard), connecting the central [[Wyoming Valley]] to destinations in lower [[New York (state)|New York]] and down-state Pennsylvania (in Harrisburg and Philadelphia). Coal mining and the manufacturing of silk were the chief industries in the early years of its existence. The population was 4,917 at the 2010 census.<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.census.gov |title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Duryea borough, Pennsylvania |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=April 11, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\n[[File:Depiction of a Susquehannock on the Smith Map (1624).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Drawing of a [[Susquehannock]] (1624)]]\nThe area now known as Duryea Borough was historically the heartland of the [[Susquehannock]] tribe, also called the Conestoga, which were an Iroquoian people whose territory extended from lower [[New York (state)|New York State]] to the [[Potomac River|Potomac]]. The Susquehannock befriended the [[New Netherlands|Dutch]] traders by 1612, who soon began trading tools and firearms for furs. The Dutch had established their trading posts along the rivers near where two natural Indian trails allowed them to make contact with the Conestoga&mdash; these were the sometimes disputed lands of the Susquehannocks and the rival [[Delaware nation]] (Lenape people).\n \nThe Dutch, while buying the lands for their settlements on the Hudson and Delaware in Lenape lands, soon developed frictions with their hosts and eventually formed an alliance with the more warlike and fierce Susquehannocks. In the 1630s, the Susquehannocks and the Lenape people warred. In 1642, the British [[Province of Maryland]] declared war on the Susquehannocks and over eight mostly inconsequential years of warfare, while the Dutch allied themselves with the Susquehannocks, lost it to the Dutch and the Indians.\n\nA few years later, the English Sea Power defeated the Dutch ending their continued influence in [[North America]]. The Conestoga continued to grow in strength. In the 1660s, the area supported a military conquest which greatly weakened two of the western Iroquois tribes: the Seneca and Catagua. They were also struck by three years of plague (around 1670) in which 9 out of 10 Susquehannocks died. In the next few years, renewed war with the Iroquois kept the tribe from recovering and only a pale remnant of its strength relocated to the plains area now between Harrisburg and Philadelphia, where they came to deal with William Penn and the new colonial [[Province of Pennsylvania]].\n\n===Establishment===\n[[File:Duryea map.png|thumb|right|Map of southern Duryea, northern Pittston, the [[Duryea Yard]], and the [[confluence]] of the [[Lackawanna River|Lackawanna]] and [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]] rivers]] \n[[File:FAB's IMG 4251 Coxton Rd Bridge, view towards MuellerYard RR-Wye-bridges and Lackawanna Confluence.JPG|thumb|right|[[Lackawanna River]] in Duryea]]\nForty original settlers arrived from [[Connecticut]] on February 8, 1769, and set up temporary cabins near the [[confluence]] of the [[Lackawanna River|Lackawanna]] and [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]] rivers, the area now at the southern end of Duryea Borough. One of the first settlers was Zebulon Marcy, from whom Marcy Township got its name. He built the first log cabin in 1770 on the west side of Duryea's present-day Main Street (not far from the [[Old Forge, Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Old Forge]] line). As more settlers located in the area, the development of mining caused the citizenry to petition for township status. Marcy Township was founded in 1880 with a population of 1,159. A census of the township in 1894 noted a population of 2,396 and 475 dwellings in a {{convert|400|acre|adj=on}} settlement. By the 1890s, the area was being called Duryea. \n \nDuryea grew in population and listed 1,005 registered voters in 1901, when it petitioned for reorganization as a Pennsylvania [[borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]]. The Borough of Duryea was incorporated on May 28, 1901; it was named in honor of Hiram Duryea, an [[American Civil War]] general and owner of extensive tracts of land in sections of the country. He was a prominent figure in the [[starch]] industry, a coal operator, and an official of the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]]. It was the practice of this railroad to name its section stops after officials of the line, hence the name of Duryea. In one sense, like many communities in the country, the town is named after its railroad station.\n\n===Coal mining===\nFarming was the principal occupation in the early days. Pioneer settlers found many portions of the land suitable for raising food that they needed for existence. Shortly after, mining would become the area's greatest source of prosperity, along with [[silk]] mills and stone quarries.\n\nThree large [[Colliery|colliers]] once operated around Duryea.  As in other nearby communities, the coal was often mined directly under the town itself. Remnants of strip mines and [[spoil tip|culm]] banks still litter the landscape to this day. After the [[Knox Mine Disaster]] (1959), which occurred only several miles outside of Duryea, the mining industry in the [[Wyoming Valley]] collapsed.\n\nAfter the death of coal and the loss of the silk mill, the town encouraged the likes of Schott Optical and Topps Bubble Gum to establish medium-sized plants in the town. However, these would never replace the jobs and revenue provided by coal. The borough witnessed a declining population along with a shrinking enrollment within its schools. This resulted in the takeover of the town's schools by the [[Pittston Area School District]]. The remaining neighborhood schools were eventually phased out and shut down with Duryea Elementary being shut down in 1981.\n\n===Early 21st century===\n[[File:FAB's IMG 4241 MullerYard Nee (WyeNtip) Scranton,PA 2013-07-22,Sat=pm.JPG|thumb|right|[[Duryea Yard]] (or Muller yard)]]\nThe [[Reading Blue Mountain and Northern|Reading & Northern Railroad Company]] invested in [[Duryea Yard]] (or Muller yard) in late 2009 and early 2010, laying track to accommodate 100 new rail cars and constructing a facility to store and hold up to 800 cars of sand to be used in [[hydraulic fracturing]], or \u201cfracking,\u201d operations at [[Marcellus Formation|Marcellus Shale]] drill sites throughout northeastern Pennsylvania.

In the following days, [[U.S. Vice President|Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]] and [[U.S. Senator]] [[Bob Casey Jr.|Bob Casey]] visited the devastated sections of Duryea.\n\nAlso in 2011, the borough received national attention for its role in the landmark Supreme Court case ''[[Borough of Duryea v.

It is situated along the eastern bank of the [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]]. The [[Lackawanna River]] runs through the heart of Duryea's boundary. It was incorporated as a borough in 1901, and had an import switching rail yard, the [[Duryea yard]] (or Muller yard), connecting the central [[Wyoming Valley]] to destinations in lower [[New York (state)|New York]] and down-state Pennsylvania (in Harrisburg and Philadelphia). Coal mining and the manufacturing of silk were the chief industries in the early years of its existence. The population was 4,917 at the 2010 census.<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.census.gov |title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Duryea borough, Pennsylvania |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=April 11, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\n[[File:Depiction of a Susquehannock on the Smith Map (1624).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Drawing of a [[Susquehannock]] (1624)]]\nThe area now known as Duryea Borough was historically the heartland of the [[Susquehannock]] tribe, also called the Conestoga, which were an Iroquoian people whose territory extended from lower [[New York (state)|New York State]] to the [[Potomac River|Potomac]]. The Susquehannock befriended the [[New Netherlands|Dutch]] traders by 1612, who soon began trading tools and firearms for furs. The Dutch had established their trading posts along the rivers near where two natural Indian trails allowed them to make contact with the Conestoga&mdash; these were the sometimes disputed lands of the Susquehannocks and the rival [[Delaware nation]] (Lenape people).\n \nThe Dutch, while buying the lands for their settlements on the Hudson and Delaware in Lenape lands, soon developed frictions with their hosts and eventually formed an alliance with the more warlike and fierce Susquehannocks. In the 1630s, the Susquehannocks and the Lenape people warred. In 1642, the British [[Province of Maryland]] declared war on the Susquehannocks and over eight mostly inconsequential years of warfare, while the Dutch allied themselves with the Susquehannocks, lost it to the Dutch and the Indians.\n\nA few years later, the English Sea Power defeated the Dutch ending their continued influence in [[North America]]. The Conestoga continued to grow in strength. In the 1660s, the area supported a military conquest which greatly weakened two of the western Iroquois tribes: the Seneca and Catagua. They were also struck by three years of plague (around 1670) in which 9 out of 10 Susquehannocks died. In the next few years, renewed war with the Iroquois kept the tribe from recovering and only a pale remnant of its strength relocated to the plains area now between Harrisburg and Philadelphia, where they came to deal with William Penn and the new colonial [[Province of Pennsylvania]].\n\n===Establishment===\n[[File:Duryea map.png|thumb|right|Map of southern Duryea, northern Pittston, the [[Duryea Yard]], and the [[confluence]] of the [[Lackawanna River|Lackawanna]] and [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]] rivers]] \n[[File:FAB's IMG 4251 Coxton Rd Bridge, view towards MuellerYard RR-Wye-bridges and Lackawanna Confluence.JPG|thumb|right|[[Lackawanna River]] in Duryea]]\nForty original settlers arrived from [[Connecticut]] on February 8, 1769, and set up temporary cabins near the [[confluence]] of the [[Lackawanna River|Lackawanna]] and [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]] rivers, the area now at the southern end of Duryea Borough. One of the first settlers was Zebulon Marcy, from whom Marcy Township got its name. He built the first log cabin in 1770 on the west side of Duryea's present-day Main Street (not far from the [[Old Forge, Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Old Forge]] line). As more settlers located in the area, the development of mining caused the citizenry to petition for township status. Marcy Township was founded in 1880 with a population of 1,159. A census of the township in 1894 noted a population of 2,396 and 475 dwellings in a {{convert|400|acre|adj=on}} settlement. By the 1890s, the area was being called Duryea. \n \nDuryea grew in population and listed 1,005 registered voters in 1901, when it petitioned for reorganization as a Pennsylvania [[borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]]. The Borough of Duryea was incorporated on May 28, 1901; it was named in honor of Hiram Duryea, an [[American Civil War]] general and owner of extensive tracts of land in sections of the country. He was a prominent figure in the [[starch]] industry, a coal operator, and an official of the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]]. It was the practice of this railroad to name its section stops after officials of the line, hence the name of Duryea. In one sense, like many communities in the country, the town is named after its railroad station.\n\n===Coal mining===\nFarming was the principal occupation in the early days. Pioneer settlers found many portions of the land suitable for raising food that they needed for existence. Shortly after, mining would become the area's greatest source of prosperity, along with [[silk]] mills and stone quarries.\n\nThree large [[Colliery|colliers]] once operated around Duryea.  As in other nearby communities, the coal was often mined directly under the town itself. Remnants of strip mines and [[spoil tip|culm]] banks still litter the landscape to this day. After the [[Knox Mine Disaster]] (1959), which occurred only several miles outside of Duryea, the mining industry in the [[Wyoming Valley]] collapsed.\n\nAfter the death of coal and the loss of the silk mill, the town encouraged the likes of Schott Optical and Topps Bubble Gum to establish medium-sized plants in the town. However, these would never replace the jobs and revenue provided by coal. The borough witnessed a declining population along with a shrinking enrollment within its schools. This resulted in the takeover of the town's schools by the [[Pittston Area School District]]. The remaining neighborhood schools were eventually phased out and shut down with Duryea Elementary being shut down in 1981.\n\n===Early 21st century===\n[[File:FAB's IMG 4241 MullerYard Nee (WyeNtip) Scranton,PA 2013-07-22,Sat=pm.JPG|thumb|right|[[Duryea Yard]] (or Muller yard)]]\nThe [[Reading Blue Mountain and Northern|Reading & Northern Railroad Company]] invested in [[Duryea Yard]] (or Muller yard) in late 2009 and early 2010, laying track to accommodate 100 new rail cars and constructing a facility to store and hold up to 800 cars of sand to be used in [[hydraulic fracturing]], or \u201cfracking,\u201d operations at [[Marcellus Formation|Marcellus Shale]] drill sites throughout northeastern Pennsylvania.

It destroyed many homes and businesses along the Lackawanna River in Duryea, stretching from Phoenix Street to Elm Street. In the following days, [[U.S. Vice President|Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]] and [[U.S. Senator]] [[Bob Casey Jr.|Bob Casey]] visited the devastated sections of Duryea.\n\nAlso in 2011, the borough received national attention for its role in the landmark Supreme Court case ''[[Borough of Duryea v. Guarnieri]]'', in which the court stated that \"a government employer's allegedly retaliatory actions against an employee do not give rise to liability under the Petition Clause unless the employee's petition relates to a matter of public concern.\"\n\n==Government==\nThe following is a list of government officials from Duryea Borough.<ref>http://www.duryeaborough.com/officials.htm</ref>\n\n===Officers===\n*Mayor: Keith Moss\n*Council President: Jeffrey Bauman\n*Council Vice-President: John Rowlands\n\n===Other councilors===\n*Al Akulonis Jr.\n*James Gromelski\n*Lois Hanczyc\n*Michael McGlynn\n*Justin Tonte\n\n==Geography==\nThe Borough of Duryea is located at {{Coord|41|20|52|N|75|45|30|W|type:city}} (41.347729, -75.758302).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> The borough is located on the eastern bank of the [[Susquehanna River]] in northern Luzerne County.

This flag was simply the [[United States flag]] with a Lone star in the [[Canton (flag)|canton]]. This flag echoes an earlier design, carried by the forces of [[James Long (filibuster)|James Long]] in failed 1819 and 1821 attempts to separate Texas from Spanish control. This earlier flag was exactly the same, save for the canton having a red background rather than blue. There is evidence that the Lone Star and Stripes was used at the battles of Goliad, the Alamo, and San Jacinto, and the first Congress of the Republic of Texas as convened under it in 1836. Although interim President David Burnet issued a decree making the Lone Star and Stripes the first official flag of the Republic of Texas, it never became the legal national flag. It did remain the naval flag of Texas until annexation, and was noted for being \"beneficial to our [Texan] Navy and Merchantmen\" due to its resemblance to the U.S. flag. Despite its unofficial status, the flag remained well known inside the region and internationally as the symbol of Texas. The official blue and gold \"Burnett Flag,\" on the other hand, was little known by Texans, and no contemporary illustrations of it have been discovered except for on the first series 2 dollar note of the Texas Dollar. An 1837 chart of national flags printed in Philadelphia showed the Lone Star and Stripes as the national flag of Texas, and Texas Senator Oliver Jones, who led the 1839 committee which approved the Lone Star Flag, was unaware that the Lone Star and Stripes was not the current official flag.<ref>{{cite book | last=Maberry | first=Robert, Jr.| title=Texas Flags|publisher=Texas A&M University Press |year=2001|isbn=978-1-58544-151-8|location=College Station|pages=28\u201338}}</ref> Later, prior to the [[American Civil War]], this flag was carried by Floridian militiamen in Pensacola during the seizure of U.S. property in that city.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe \"Come and Take It Flag\" was created by the people of Gonzales, featuring the phrase, a black five pointed star, and the image of the town cannon Mexican forces had demanded they turn over. In March 1831, Juan Gomez, a lieutenant in the Mexican Army, granted a small cannon to the colony of San Antonio. It was then transported to Gonzales, Texas and later was the object of Texas pride. At the minor skirmish known as the [[Battle of Gonzales]], a small group of Texans successfully resisted the Mexican forces who had orders to seize their cannon. As a symbol of defiance, the Texans had fashioned a flag containing the phrase along with a black star and an image of the cannon which they had received six years earlier from Mexican officials.\n\nThe so-called \"Alamo Flag\" or \"1824 flag\" was created by replacing the Eagle in the center of the Mexican tricolor with the year \"1824,\" referencing the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico]], in support of which Texas was fighting. This was the first flag approved for use by rebel forces by a Texan legislative body. In 1835, the Texan provisional government approved the use of this flag for privateers preying on Mexican commerce.  It has often been said that the 1824 flag was flown by Texan forces at the [[Battle of the Alamo]]. However, this was never alleged until 1860, long after the battle had occurred. Modern writers have pointed out that the presence of the 1824 flag at the time and place of the battle is highly unlikely. A similar flag was flown at least briefly by Texan Tejano forces, featuring two black, six pointed stars in place of the date. It is likely that the actual \"Alamo flag\" referred to by accounts of the time was the Lone Star and Stripes, which had been depicted in use at earlier battles such as Goliad, and was widely referred to as the \"[[Texian]] flag.\"<ref>{{cite book | last=Maberry | first=Robert, Jr.| title=Texas Flags |publisher=Texas A&M University Press |year=2001|isbn=978-1-58544-151-8|location=College Station|pages=11, 26, 28\u201332}}</ref>\n\nThe Dodson Tricolor or Dodson flag was designed and sewn by a Mrs. Sarah Dodson during the Revolution. It resembled the flag of Revolutionary France, but with longer proportions and the Texan Lone Star in the canton. [[Stephen F. Austin]] was initially so alarmed by the obvious symbolism that he requested the flag not be used, but it nevertheless flew over Texan forces in [[Cibolo Creek]], and may have been the first Texan flag raised over San Antonio. The flag was one of two that flew over the small cabin in which Texas delegates ratified their declaration of independence.\n\n===Republic of Texas flags===\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Flag of Republic of Texas (1836-1839).svg|{{FIAV|historical}}{{FIAV|111000}}1836\u20131839; 1839\u20131879 {{FIAV|001000}} <br> The \"Burnet Flag,\" used from 1836 to 1839 as the national flag of the [[Republic of Texas]] until it was replaced by the currently used \"Lone Star Flag\"; it was the ''de jure'' war flag from then until 1879\nFile:Flag of the Republic of Texas (1835-1839).svg|{{FIAV|historical}}{{FIAV|000001}}1836\u20131839 <br> War ensign and ''de facto'' national flag between 1835\u20131839; it was also the ensign of the First [[Texas Navy]] from 1836\u20131839; it was prominently featured on the $10 and $50 notes of the [[Texas dollar]]\nFile:Flag of Texas.svg|1839\u20131845/6 <br> The \"Lone Star Flag,\" the [[Republic of Texas]] national flag from 1839-1845/6; official naval ensign for the [[Texas Navy]] from 1839\nFile:Texas Revenue Service Flag (1839-1845).svg|1839\u20131845 <br> Revenue Service flag\nFile:Texas Coasting Trader Flag (1839-1845).svg|1839\u20131845 <br> Coasting Trader ensign\nFile:Texas Pilot Flag (1839-1845).svg|1839\u20131845 <br> Pilot flag/Civil ensign\n</gallery>\n\nThe Burnet Flag was adopted by the Texan Congress on December 10, 1836.

This flag was simply the [[United States flag]] with a Lone star in the [[Canton (flag)|canton]]. This flag echoes an earlier design, carried by the forces of [[James Long (filibuster)|James Long]] in failed 1819 and 1821 attempts to separate Texas from Spanish control. This earlier flag was exactly the same, save for the canton having a red background rather than blue. There is evidence that the Lone Star and Stripes was used at the battles of Goliad, the Alamo, and San Jacinto, and the first Congress of the Republic of Texas as convened under it in 1836. Although interim President David Burnet issued a decree making the Lone Star and Stripes the first official flag of the Republic of Texas, it never became the legal national flag. It did remain the naval flag of Texas until annexation, and was noted for being \"beneficial to our [Texan] Navy and Merchantmen\" due to its resemblance to the U.S. flag. Despite its unofficial status, the flag remained well known inside the region and internationally as the symbol of Texas. The official blue and gold \"Burnett Flag,\" on the other hand, was little known by Texans, and no contemporary illustrations of it have been discovered except for on the first series 2 dollar note of the Texas Dollar. An 1837 chart of national flags printed in Philadelphia showed the Lone Star and Stripes as the national flag of Texas, and Texas Senator Oliver Jones, who led the 1839 committee which approved the Lone Star Flag, was unaware that the Lone Star and Stripes was not the current official flag.<ref>{{cite book | last=Maberry | first=Robert, Jr.| title=Texas Flags|publisher=Texas A&M University Press |year=2001|isbn=978-1-58544-151-8|location=College Station|pages=28\u201338}}</ref> Later, prior to the [[American Civil War]], this flag was carried by Floridian militiamen in Pensacola during the seizure of U.S. property in that city.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe \"Come and Take It Flag\" was created by the people of Gonzales, featuring the phrase, a black five pointed star, and the image of the town cannon Mexican forces had demanded they turn over. In March 1831, Juan Gomez, a lieutenant in the Mexican Army, granted a small cannon to the colony of San Antonio. It was then transported to Gonzales, Texas and later was the object of Texas pride. At the minor skirmish known as the [[Battle of Gonzales]], a small group of Texans successfully resisted the Mexican forces who had orders to seize their cannon. As a symbol of defiance, the Texans had fashioned a flag containing the phrase along with a black star and an image of the cannon which they had received six years earlier from Mexican officials.\n\nThe so-called \"Alamo Flag\" or \"1824 flag\" was created by replacing the Eagle in the center of the Mexican tricolor with the year \"1824,\" referencing the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico]], in support of which Texas was fighting. This was the first flag approved for use by rebel forces by a Texan legislative body. In 1835, the Texan provisional government approved the use of this flag for privateers preying on Mexican commerce.  It has often been said that the 1824 flag was flown by Texan forces at the [[Battle of the Alamo]]. However, this was never alleged until 1860, long after the battle had occurred. Modern writers have pointed out that the presence of the 1824 flag at the time and place of the battle is highly unlikely. A similar flag was flown at least briefly by Texan Tejano forces, featuring two black, six pointed stars in place of the date. It is likely that the actual \"Alamo flag\" referred to by accounts of the time was the Lone Star and Stripes, which had been depicted in use at earlier battles such as Goliad, and was widely referred to as the \"[[Texian]] flag.\"<ref>{{cite book | last=Maberry | first=Robert, Jr.| title=Texas Flags |publisher=Texas A&M University Press |year=2001|isbn=978-1-58544-151-8|location=College Station|pages=11, 26, 28\u201332}}</ref>\n\nThe Dodson Tricolor or Dodson flag was designed and sewn by a Mrs. Sarah Dodson during the Revolution. It resembled the flag of Revolutionary France, but with longer proportions and the Texan Lone Star in the canton. [[Stephen F. Austin]] was initially so alarmed by the obvious symbolism that he requested the flag not be used, but it nevertheless flew over Texan forces in [[Cibolo Creek]], and may have been the first Texan flag raised over San Antonio. The flag was one of two that flew over the small cabin in which Texas delegates ratified their declaration of independence.\n\n===Republic of Texas flags===\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Flag of Republic of Texas (1836-1839).svg|{{FIAV|historical}}{{FIAV|111000}}1836\u20131839; 1839\u20131879 {{FIAV|001000}} <br> The \"Burnet Flag,\" used from 1836 to 1839 as the national flag of the [[Republic of Texas]] until it was replaced by the currently used \"Lone Star Flag\"; it was the ''de jure'' war flag from then until 1879\nFile:Flag of the Republic of Texas (1835-1839).svg|{{FIAV|historical}}{{FIAV|000001}}1836\u20131839 <br> War ensign and ''de facto'' national flag between 1835\u20131839; it was also the ensign of the First [[Texas Navy]] from 1836\u20131839; it was prominently featured on the $10 and $50 notes of the [[Texas dollar]]\nFile:Flag of Texas.svg|1839\u20131845/6 <br> The \"Lone Star Flag,\" the [[Republic of Texas]] national flag from 1839-1845/6; official naval ensign for the [[Texas Navy]] from 1839\nFile:Texas Revenue Service Flag (1839-1845).svg|1839\u20131845 <br> Revenue Service flag\nFile:Texas Coasting Trader Flag (1839-1845).svg|1839\u20131845 <br> Coasting Trader ensign\nFile:Texas Pilot Flag (1839-1845).svg|1839\u20131845 <br> Pilot flag/Civil ensign\n</gallery>\n\nThe Burnet Flag was adopted by the Texan Congress on December 10, 1836.

It does appear in [[David Bedford]]'s ''[[With 100 Kazoos]]'', where, rather than having professionals play the instrument, kazoos are handed out to the audience, who accompany a professional instrumental ensemble.<ref name = \"Harness\" /> [[Leonard Bernstein]] included a segment for kazoo ensemble in the First Introit (Rondo) of his ''[[Mass (theatre)|Mass]].'' The kazoo was used in the 1990 [[Koch International]] and 2007 [[Naxos Records]] recordings of American classical composer [[Charles Ives]]' ''Yale-Princeton Football Game'', where the kazoo chorus represents the football crowd's cheering. The brief passages have the kazoo chorus sliding up and down the scale as the \"cheering\" rises and falls.\n\nIn [[Frank Loesser]]'s score for the 1961 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical comedy ''[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (musical)|How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]]'', several kazoos produce the effect of electric razors used in the executive washroom during a dance reprise of the ballad ''I Believe in You''.\n\nIn 1961 [[Del Shannon|Del Shannon's]] \"So Long Baby\" issued on Big Top Records featured a kazoo on the instrumental break. In addition to the single release it featured on the UK London American release of his album Hats Off To Del Shannon. [[Joanie Sommers|Joanie Sommers']] 1962 hit single \"[[Johnny Get Angry]]\" featured a kazoo ensemble in its instrumental bridge, as did [[Ringo Starr]]'s 1973 cover of \"[[You're Sixteen]]\".\n\n[[Jesse Fuller]]'s 1962 recording of his song \"San Francisco Bay Blues\" features a kazoo solo,<ref name = \"SF\">Peter Siegel, liner notes to ''Friends of Old Time Music'' ([[Smithsonian Folkways]], SFW40160) [http://media.smithsonianglobalsound.org/liner_notes/smithsonian_folkways/SFW40160.pdf Media.smithsonianglobalsound.org]</ref> as does [[Eric Clapton]]'s 1992 recording of the song on MTV's Unplugged television show and album. On the song \"Alligator\" on the [[Grateful Dead]] album ''[[Anthem of the Sun]]'' three members of the band play kazoo together. Many [[Paolo Conte]] performances include kazoo passages.\n\nShort kazoo performances appear on many modern recordings, usually for comic effect. For example, in his first album, ''[[Freak Out!]]'', [[Frank Zappa]] used the kazoo to add comic feel to some songs<ref name = \"Harness\" /> \u2014 including one of his best known, \"[[Hungry Freaks, Daddy]]\".

The ''rosanero'' ended the season in first place, being crowned Serie B champions and promoted to [[Serie A]] after 31 years in the lower divisions.\n\n==Review and events==\nAmbitious Palermo failed to gain promotion to [[Serie A]] in the previous season following a 3-0 away defeat in the final match against [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]], which were promoted at Palermo's place. That dramatic defeat was also the last appearance in his playing career for team captain [[Antonino Asta]], who seriously injured during the match and did not manage to recover; he was part of the first team squad in the season 2003-04, without however making a single appearance. Following the events, Palermo made a number of prominent signings in the summer market, such as [[Eugenio Corini]], [[Andrea Gasbarroni]] and [[Luca Toni]]; in addition, Palermo-born star [[Gaetano Vasari]] agreed to join the ''rosanero'' with a salary based on the number of appearances he would have made in the season. [[Silvio Baldini]] was appointed as new boss to replace [[Nedo Sonetti]]. Several football pundits suggested Palermo to be the real favourite team to win the Serie B league because of the quality of its roster.\n\nThe team made a very impressive start by defeating [[Gianfranco Zola]]'s [[Cagliari Calcio]], and managed to be always in the promotion spots. However, following a surprising 3-1 home defeat to [[Salernitana Calcio 1919|Salernitana]] that brought Palermo down to third place, Baldini heavily criticized club chairman [[Maurizio Zamparini]] who consequently fired him and appointed [[Francesco Guidolin]] at his place. On the last day of the January transfer market, three new notable signings were made: [[Antonio Filippini]], [[Emanuele Filippini]] and [[Fabio Grosso]]. Palermo later returned to top the table and eventually won the league, ending with the same points than Cagliari, but being crowned as Serie B champions due to head-to-head matches.\n\n==2003-04 squad==\n{{Efs start|[[Serie B 2003-04|Serie B]]|[[Coppa Italia 2003-04|Coppa Italia]]}}\n{{Efs player|no=1|nat=Italy|name=[[Gianluca Berti]]|pos=GK|42|-35|1|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=12|nat=Italy|name=[[Nicola Santoni]]|pos=GK|4|-4|4|-6}}\n{{Efs player|no=84|nat=Italy|name=[[Paolo Comi]]|pos=GK|0|0|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=4|nat=Italy|name=[[Gianluca Atzori]]|pos=DF|17|0|1|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=6|nat=Italy|name=[[Christian Terlizzi]]|pos=DF|12|0|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=13|nat=Italy|name=[[Pietro Accardi]]|pos=DF|32|0|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=18|nat=Italy|name=[[Fabio Grosso]]|pos=DF|21|1|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=21|nat=Italy|name=[[Giuseppe Biava]]|pos=DF|19|3|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=25|nat=Sierra Leone|name=[[Kewullay Conteh]]|pos=DF|32|0|2|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=29|nat=Romania|name=[[Valentin N\u0103stase]]|pos=DF|16|1|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=81|nat=Italy|name=[[Michele Ferri]]|pos=DF|36|1|3|1}}\n{{Efs player|no=5|nat=Italy|name=[[Eugenio Corini]]|pos=MF|40|12|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=7|nat=Italy|name=[[Gaetano Vasari]]|pos=MF|26|1|4|1}}\n{{Efs player|no=8|nat=Italy|name=[[Daniele Di Donato]]|pos=MF|39|3|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=10|nat=Italy|name=[[Lamberto Zauli]]|pos=MF|21|4|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=11|nat=Italy|name=[[Salvatore Masiello]]|pos=MF|18|0|4|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=17|nat=Italy|name=[[Antonino Asta]]|pos=MF|0|0|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=22|nat=Italy|name=[[Massimo Mutarelli]]|pos=MF|41|2|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=23|nat=Italy|name=[[Emanuele Filippini]]|pos=MF|20|4|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=26|nat=Italy|name=[[Antonio Filippini]]|pos=MF|21|2|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=46|nat=Italy|name=[[Andrea Gasbarroni]]|pos=MF|39|6|2|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=79|nat=Italy|name=[[Evans Soligo]]|pos=MF|9|0|4|1}}\n{{Efs player|no=82|nat=Italy|name=[[Nicola Milano]]|pos=MF|0|0|1|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=9|nat=Italy|name=[[Luca Toni]]|pos=FW|45|30|2|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=20|nat=Italy|name=[[Simone Pepe]]|pos=FW|19|1|5|2}}\n{{Efs player|no=24|nat=Nigeria|name=[[John Otuagomah Olufemi]]|pos=FW|0|0|1|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=30|nat=Brazil|name=[[Jedaias Capucho Neves|Jeda]]|pos=FW|17|3|0|0}}\n|-\n|colspan=\"10\"|''Players sold or loaned out during the January transfer market:''\n{{Efs player|no=3|nat=Italy|name=[[Francesco Modesto]]|pos=DF|1|0|5|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=18|nat=Italy|name=[[Franco Brienza]]|pos=MF|18|1|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=21|nat=Romania|name=[[Paul Codrea]]|pos=MF|8|0|4|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=23|nat=Italy|name=[[Ighli Vannucchi]]|pos=MF|8|0|3|2}}\n|}\n\n===January transfer market bids===\n;'''In'''\n{|\n{{Football squad player|no=18|nat=Italy|name=[[Fabio Grosso]]|pos=DF|other=from [[Perugia Calcio|Perugia]]}}\n{{Football squad player|no=21|nat=Italy|name=[[Giuseppe Biava]]|pos=DF|other=from [[U.C.

The ''rosanero'' ended the season in first place, being crowned Serie B champions and promoted to [[Serie A]] after 31 years in the lower divisions.\n\n==Review and events==\nAmbitious Palermo failed to gain promotion to [[Serie A]] in the previous season following a 3-0 away defeat in the final match against [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]], which were promoted at Palermo's place. That dramatic defeat was also the last appearance in his playing career for team captain [[Antonino Asta]], who seriously injured during the match and did not manage to recover; he was part of the first team squad in the season 2003-04, without however making a single appearance. Following the events, Palermo made a number of prominent signings in the summer market, such as [[Eugenio Corini]], [[Andrea Gasbarroni]] and [[Luca Toni]]; in addition, Palermo-born star [[Gaetano Vasari]] agreed to join the ''rosanero'' with a salary based on the number of appearances he would have made in the season. [[Silvio Baldini]] was appointed as new boss to replace [[Nedo Sonetti]]. Several football pundits suggested Palermo to be the real favourite team to win the Serie B league because of the quality of its roster.\n\nThe team made a very impressive start by defeating [[Gianfranco Zola]]'s [[Cagliari Calcio]], and managed to be always in the promotion spots. However, following a surprising 3-1 home defeat to [[Salernitana Calcio 1919|Salernitana]] that brought Palermo down to third place, Baldini heavily criticized club chairman [[Maurizio Zamparini]] who consequently fired him and appointed [[Francesco Guidolin]] at his place. On the last day of the January transfer market, three new notable signings were made: [[Antonio Filippini]], [[Emanuele Filippini]] and [[Fabio Grosso]]. Palermo later returned to top the table and eventually won the league, ending with the same points than Cagliari, but being crowned as Serie B champions due to head-to-head matches.\n\n==2003-04 squad==\n{{Efs start|[[Serie B 2003-04|Serie B]]|[[Coppa Italia 2003-04|Coppa Italia]]}}\n{{Efs player|no=1|nat=Italy|name=[[Gianluca Berti]]|pos=GK|42|-35|1|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=12|nat=Italy|name=[[Nicola Santoni]]|pos=GK|4|-4|4|-6}}\n{{Efs player|no=84|nat=Italy|name=[[Paolo Comi]]|pos=GK|0|0|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=4|nat=Italy|name=[[Gianluca Atzori]]|pos=DF|17|0|1|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=6|nat=Italy|name=[[Christian Terlizzi]]|pos=DF|12|0|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=13|nat=Italy|name=[[Pietro Accardi]]|pos=DF|32|0|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=18|nat=Italy|name=[[Fabio Grosso]]|pos=DF|21|1|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=21|nat=Italy|name=[[Giuseppe Biava]]|pos=DF|19|3|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=25|nat=Sierra Leone|name=[[Kewullay Conteh]]|pos=DF|32|0|2|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=29|nat=Romania|name=[[Valentin N\u0103stase]]|pos=DF|16|1|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=81|nat=Italy|name=[[Michele Ferri]]|pos=DF|36|1|3|1}}\n{{Efs player|no=5|nat=Italy|name=[[Eugenio Corini]]|pos=MF|40|12|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=7|nat=Italy|name=[[Gaetano Vasari]]|pos=MF|26|1|4|1}}\n{{Efs player|no=8|nat=Italy|name=[[Daniele Di Donato]]|pos=MF|39|3|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=10|nat=Italy|name=[[Lamberto Zauli]]|pos=MF|21|4|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=11|nat=Italy|name=[[Salvatore Masiello]]|pos=MF|18|0|4|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=17|nat=Italy|name=[[Antonino Asta]]|pos=MF|0|0|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=22|nat=Italy|name=[[Massimo Mutarelli]]|pos=MF|41|2|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=23|nat=Italy|name=[[Emanuele Filippini]]|pos=MF|20|4|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=26|nat=Italy|name=[[Antonio Filippini]]|pos=MF|21|2|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=46|nat=Italy|name=[[Andrea Gasbarroni]]|pos=MF|39|6|2|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=79|nat=Italy|name=[[Evans Soligo]]|pos=MF|9|0|4|1}}\n{{Efs player|no=82|nat=Italy|name=[[Nicola Milano]]|pos=MF|0|0|1|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=9|nat=Italy|name=[[Luca Toni]]|pos=FW|45|30|2|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=20|nat=Italy|name=[[Simone Pepe]]|pos=FW|19|1|5|2}}\n{{Efs player|no=24|nat=Nigeria|name=[[John Otuagomah Olufemi]]|pos=FW|0|0|1|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=30|nat=Brazil|name=[[Jedaias Capucho Neves|Jeda]]|pos=FW|17|3|0|0}}\n|-\n|colspan=\"10\"|''Players sold or loaned out during the January transfer market:''\n{{Efs player|no=3|nat=Italy|name=[[Francesco Modesto]]|pos=DF|1|0|5|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=18|nat=Italy|name=[[Franco Brienza]]|pos=MF|18|1|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=21|nat=Romania|name=[[Paul Codrea]]|pos=MF|8|0|4|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=23|nat=Italy|name=[[Ighli Vannucchi]]|pos=MF|8|0|3|2}}\n|}\n\n===January transfer market bids===\n;'''In'''\n{|\n{{Football squad player|no=18|nat=Italy|name=[[Fabio Grosso]]|pos=DF|other=from [[Perugia Calcio|Perugia]]}}\n{{Football squad player|no=21|nat=Italy|name=[[Giuseppe Biava]]|pos=DF|other=from [[U.C.

Dunmore was settled in 1835 and incorporated in 1862. Extensive [[anthracite coal]], brick, stone, and silk interests had led to a rapid increase in the population from 8,315 in 1890 to 23,086 in 1940. The population was 13,110 in the 2018 census.\n\n== History ==\nDunmore was settled in 1835 and incorporated in 1862.<ref name=dunmore>{{cite web |url=http://dunmorepa.gov/ |title=Home page|website=Burough of Dunmore |publisher=Dunmore Burough |accessdate=18 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first white person to set foot on Dunmore soil was Count Zinzendorf of Saxony, in 1742, as a missionary to the native people<ref name=\"O'Hora1937\">{{cite book |last1=O'Hora |first1=Margaret M. |title=History of Dunmore |date=1937 |publisher=Dunmore Improvement Assoc. |location=Dunmore, PA |page=8 |url=http://content.lackawannadigitalarchives.org/cdm/ref/collection/Centennial/id/680 |accessdate=18 November 2018}}</ref> who were Munsee-speaking [[Delaware people|Delawares]].\n\nThe territory now encompassing Dunmore was purchased from the natives in 1754 by the Susquehanna Company of Connecticut and became the township of Providence. The first settlers of the Dunmore area arrived in 1771 and were originally from Connecticut (see [[Pennamite\u2013Yankee War]]). William Allsworth established an inn here in 1783. In the summer of 1795, Charles Dolph, John Carey, and John West began the labor of clearing and plowing lands in the neighborhood of \"Bucktown\" or \"Corners\", as this area was called.
