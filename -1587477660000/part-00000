Introduced in the [[Better Call Saul (season 4)|fourth season]], he is portrayed by [[Tony Dalton]], and was created by [[Vince Gilligan]], [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] and [[Gordon Smith (screenwriter)|Gordon Smith]].\n\nLalo, a member of the [[Ju\u00e1rez Cartel]], is one of many nephews of drug kingpin [[Hector Salamanca]]. After Hector suffers a stroke, Lalo arrives from Mexico to help run the Salamanca family's drug operation and takes a greater interest in the day-to-day details than Hector did.\n\n== Conception and development ==\n[[File:Tony Dalton (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Tony Dalton]]\n[[Tony Dalton]] made his first on-screen appearance as Lalo Salamanca in the fourth season episode \"[[Coushatta (Better Call Saul)|Coushatta]]\". The character was first mentioned in the ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' episode \"[[Better Call Saul (Breaking Bad)|Better Call Saul]]\", which also referenced the character \"Ignacio\" ([[Nacho Varga]]) and introduced the character [[Saul Goodman]] (Jimmy McGill).<ref name=\"bustle\" /> Prior to the show's airing, [[Vince Gilligan]] mentioned in an interview that the writers had envisioned Lalo to become a major character, acknowledging that, like on ''Breaking Bad'', they must \"keep close tabs on what our characters have done in the past and make good use of it here in the present and the future.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/02/vince-gilligan-better-call-saul/ |title=Vince Gilligan Gives Us a Glimpse of Where Better Call Saul Is Headed |last=Tannenbaum |first=Rob |date=February 5, 2015 |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309081417/https://www.wired.com/2015/02/vince-gilligan-better-call-saul/ |archive-date=March 9, 2020 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref> However, Gilligan and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] had difficulties in figuring in how to introduce the character properly. They considered him as a [[bogeyman]] around the second season when they started writing narrative to support the need for Lalo's introduction, but had not figured out the character's personality or other motivations. Gilligan believes this was more his fault for delaying on developing Lalo, as it was Gould that pushed on the need to introduce Lalo sooner into the story. Gould saw that Lalo needed to be different from the other Salamancas and a equal foil for [[Gus Fring]], which lead to the casting of Dalton for the role who had the charmisa, charm and athletism they felt they needed for Lalo.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-creators-interview-984340/ |title=5 Burning Questions About the \u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Season 5 Finale&nbsp;\u2014 Answered |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Sepinwall |date=April 20, 2020 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200421083848/https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-creators-interview-984340/ |archive-date=April 21, 2020 |access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Den of Geek]]'', [[Michael Mando]] (who portrays Nacho) described the character of Lalo as \"a Salamanca in every way, just like [[Tuco Salamanca|Tuco]] and [[Hector Salamanca|Hector]] had their own flavors to the erratic Salamancas.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/better-call-saul/275809/better-call-saul-season-4-nachos-dark-path |title=Better Call Saul Season 4: Nacho's Dark Path |last=Kurland |first=Daniel |date=August 21, 2018 |website=[[Den of Geek]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309081528/https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/better-call-saul-season-4-nachos-dark-path/ |archive-date=March 9, 2020 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe episode \"[[Wiedersehen]]\", written by [[Gennifer Hutchison]], fleshes out Lalo further.

Jackson]]'s character Jules Winnfield from ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' for acting as Lalo, \"Kind of this smart ass, sort of scary but kind of carefree, kind of cool guy\".<ref name=\"looper\" /> He also sought to differentiate Lalo from his hitman role in the [[HBO Latin America Group|HBO Latinoam\u00e9rica]] series ''[[Sr. \u00c1vila]]'', saying that the latter \"had zero personality.

Introduced in the [[Better Call Saul (season 4)|fourth season]], he is portrayed by [[Tony Dalton]], and was created by [[Vince Gilligan]], [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] and [[Gordon Smith (screenwriter)|Gordon Smith]].\n\nLalo, a member of the [[Ju\u00e1rez Cartel]], is one of many nephews of drug kingpin [[Hector Salamanca]]. After Hector suffers a stroke, Lalo arrives from Mexico to help run the Salamanca family's drug operation and takes a greater interest in the day-to-day details than Hector did.\n\n== Conception and development ==\n[[File:Tony Dalton (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Tony Dalton]]\n[[Tony Dalton]] made his first on-screen appearance as Lalo Salamanca in the fourth season episode \"[[Coushatta (Better Call Saul)|Coushatta]]\". The character was first mentioned in the ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' episode \"[[Better Call Saul (Breaking Bad)|Better Call Saul]]\", which also referenced the character \"Ignacio\" ([[Nacho Varga]]) and introduced the character [[Saul Goodman]] (Jimmy McGill).<ref name=\"bustle\" /> Prior to the show's airing, [[Vince Gilligan]] mentioned in an interview that the writers had envisioned Lalo to become a major character, acknowledging that, like on ''Breaking Bad'', they must \"keep close tabs on what our characters have done in the past and make good use of it here in the present and the future.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/02/vince-gilligan-better-call-saul/ |title=Vince Gilligan Gives Us a Glimpse of Where Better Call Saul Is Headed |last=Tannenbaum |first=Rob |date=February 5, 2015 |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309081417/https://www.wired.com/2015/02/vince-gilligan-better-call-saul/ |archive-date=March 9, 2020 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref> However, Gilligan and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] had difficulties in figuring in how to introduce the character properly. They considered him as a [[bogeyman]] around the second season when they started writing narrative to support the need for Lalo's introduction, but had not figured out the character's personality or other motivations. Gilligan believes this was more his fault for delaying on developing Lalo, as it was Gould that pushed on the need to introduce Lalo sooner into the story. Gould saw that Lalo needed to be different from the other Salamancas and a equal foil for [[Gus Fring]], which lead to the casting of Dalton for the role who had the charmisa, charm and athletism they felt they needed for Lalo.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-creators-interview-984340/ |title=5 Burning Questions About the \u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Season 5 Finale&nbsp;\u2014 Answered |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Sepinwall |date=April 20, 2020 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200421083848/https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-creators-interview-984340/ |archive-date=April 21, 2020 |access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Den of Geek]]'', [[Michael Mando]] (who portrays Nacho) described the character of Lalo as \"a Salamanca in every way, just like [[Tuco Salamanca|Tuco]] and [[Hector Salamanca|Hector]] had their own flavors to the erratic Salamancas.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/better-call-saul/275809/better-call-saul-season-4-nachos-dark-path |title=Better Call Saul Season 4: Nacho's Dark Path |last=Kurland |first=Daniel |date=August 21, 2018 |website=[[Den of Geek]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309081528/https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/better-call-saul-season-4-nachos-dark-path/ |archive-date=March 9, 2020 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe episode \"[[Wiedersehen]]\", written by [[Gennifer Hutchison]], fleshes out Lalo further. Hutchison said that while he is just as \"scary\" as the other Salamancas, he is \"a little more circumspect about things.\" She explained that the producers wanted him to be \"a little charming\", in contrast to the other Salamancas, and \"There isn't something about them where you're like, \"Oh, he's scary, but he's kinda funny, too!\" We really liked the idea of having a Salamanca who's charming\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fien-print/better-call-saul-wiedersehen-interview-gennifer-hutchison-1148495 |title='Better Call Saul' Writer Breaks Down the \"Wiedersehen\" Rooftop Fight and That Famous Bell |last=Fienberg |first=Daniel |date=October 1, 2018 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309081655/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fien-print/better-call-saul-wiedersehen-interview-gennifer-hutchison-1148495 |archive-date=March 9, 2020 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref> According to Dalton, Lalo was not originally meant to be very charming: \"I saw ''Breaking Bad'' and I saw ''Better Call Saul'' before I got the job, and I thought there needs to be somebody besides [[Bob Odenkirk|Bob [Odenkirk]]], [...] who is also kind of smiling and carefree and a little bit mischievous in the bad guy's part\".<ref name=\"looper\" /> Dalton said he took inspiration from [[Samuel L. Jackson]]'s character Jules Winnfield from ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' for acting as Lalo, \"Kind of this smart ass, sort of scary but kind of carefree, kind of cool guy\".<ref name=\"looper\" /> He also sought to differentiate Lalo from his hitman role in the [[HBO Latin America Group|HBO Latinoam\u00e9rica]] series ''[[Sr. \u00c1vila]]'', saying that the latter \"had zero personality. If he was standing against a wall, you couldn\u2019t tell him apart from the wall.\" Dalton avoided giving him a thick Mexican accent because \"he\u2019s kind of a second generation narco.

The members of STIP rotate their seats after one year in municipal council (instead of the regular term of four years) to combine their elected position with their studies. STIP is a unique democratic example of student involvement in local politics. First elected in 1994, STIP had steadily grown its representation on the municipal council.\n\nAfter the election victory in 1998 STIP was invited to join the ruling coalition and get a seat on the [[College van burgemeester en wethouders|executive council]] (''College van Burgemeester en Wethouders)''. Since then they have consistently remained part of the ruling coalition. Currently their representative on the executive council is deputy mayor [[Bas Vollebregt]]. STIP is the only student party in the Netherlands with a representation on the local executive council.\n\n==Ideology and electorate==\nSTIP has no clearly defined political ideology and self-describes itself as pragmatic. However its ''raison d'\u00eatre'' is improving the relationship between students and 'regular' citizens of Delft in general, and specifically improving the relationship between the [[Delft University of Technology]] and the [[Delft|City of Delft]].

The current [[Presidential Succession Act]] was adopted in 1947, and last revised in 2006.\n\nThe line of succession follows the order of: vice president, [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|speaker of the House of Representatives]], [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president pro tempore of the Senate]], and then the eligible heads of [[United States federal executive departments|federal executive departments]] who form the president's [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]]. The Presidential Succession Act refers specifically to officers beyond the vice president ''acting as'' president rather than ''becoming'' president when filling a vacancy. The Cabinet currently has 15 members, of which the [[Secretary of State of the United States|secretary of state]] is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order of when their departments (or the department of which their department is the successor) were created. Those heads of department who are constitutionally ineligible to be elected to the presidency are disqualified from assuming the powers and duties of the president through succession, and skipped to the next in line. Since 1789, the vice president has succeeded to the presidency intra-term on nine occasions: eight times due to the incumbent's death, and once due to resignation. No one lower in the line of succession has been called upon to act as president.\n\nWidely considered a settled issue during the late 20th century, the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001]] demonstrated the potential for a [[decapitation strike]] that would kill or incapacitate multiple individuals in the presidential line of succession in addition to many members of Congress and the federal judiciary. In the years immediately following the attacks, there were numerous wide-ranging discussions in Congress, among academics and within the public policy community about [[continuity of government]] concerns including the existing constitutional and statutory provisions governing presidential succession. These discussions remain ongoing. One effort put forward by the [[Continuity of Government Commission]], a [[Nonpartisanism in the United States|nonpartisan]] [[think tank]], produced three reports (2003, 2009 and 2011), the second of which focused on the implicit ambiguities and limitations in the current succession act, and contained recommendations for amending the laws for succession to the presidency.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Current order ==\n\nThe table below details the current presidential order of succession as established by the 1947 presidential succession [[statute]] as amended.<ref>{{cite web | title=Title 3\u2014The President: Chapter 1\u2014Presidential Elections and Vacancies | url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2017-title3/pdf/USCODE-2017-title3-chap1.pdf | year=2017 | page=6 | publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office | location=Washington, D.C. | accessdate=January 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{usc|3|19}}</ref> The order is determined by the offices.

In the event of a nuclear, chemical, or biological attack, it is possible that everyone on the list would be killed or incapacitated.\n# Doubt that the speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate are constitutionally eligible to act as president.\n# A concern about the wisdom of including the president pro tempore in the line of succession as the \"largely honorific post traditionally held by the longest-serving senator of the majority party\". For example, from January 20, 2001, to June 6, 2001, the president pro tempore was then-98-year-old [[Strom Thurmond]].\n# A concern that the current line of succession can force the presidency to abruptly switch parties mid-term, as the president, speaker, and the president pro tempore are not necessarily of the same party as each other.\n# A concern that the succession line is ordered by the dates of creation of the various executive departments, without regard to the skills or capacities of the persons serving as secretary.\n# The fact that, should a Cabinet member begin to act as president, the law allows the House to elect a new speaker (or the Senate to elect a new president pro tempore), who could in effect remove the Cabinet member and assume the office themselves at any time.\n# The absence of a provision where a president is disabled and the vice presidency is vacant (for example, if an assassination attempt simultaneously wounded the president and killed the vice president).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.continuityofgovernment.org/pdfs/FirstReport.pdf | title=The Continuity of Congress: The First Report of the Continuity of Government Commission | series=Preserving Our Institutions | page=4 | publisher=Continuity of Government Commission | location=Washington, D.C. | date=May 2003 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625015852/http://www.continuityofgovernment.org/pdfs/FirstReport.pdf | archive-date=June 25, 2008 |url-status = dead| accessdate=December 28, 2008 | via=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the Continuity of Government Commission commented on the use of the term \"Officer\" in the 1947 statute,\n\n{{quote|The language in the current Presidential Succession Act is less clear than that of the 1886 Act with respect to Senate confirmation. The 1886 Act refers to \"such officers as shall have been appointed by the advice and consent of the Senate to the office therein named \u2026\" The current act merely refers to \"officers appointed, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.\" Read literally, this means that the current act allows for acting secretaries to be in the line of succession as long as they are confirmed by the Senate for a post (even for example, the second or third in command within a department). It is common for a second in command to become acting secretary when the secretary leaves office. Though there is some dispute over this provision, the language clearly permits acting secretaries to be placed in the line of succession. (We have spoken to acting secretaries who told us they had been placed in the line of succession.)<ref name=continuity2brookings/>}}\n \nIn 2016\u201317, the Second [[Fordham University School of Law]] Clinic on Presidential Succession developed a series of proposals to \"resolve succession issues that have received little attention from scholars and commissions\" over the past several decades; its recommendations included:\n\n* Remove legislators and several Cabinet members from the line of succession and adding four officials, or \"Standing Successors\", outside of Washington, D.C. The line of succession would be: {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|1}}\u2014}}Secretary of State, {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|2}}\u2014}}Secretary of Defense, {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|3}}\u2014}}Attorney General, {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|4}}\u2014}}Secretary of Homeland Security, {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|5}}\u2014}}Secretary of the Treasury, {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|6}}\u2014}}Standing {{Nowrap|Successor 1,}} {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|7}}\u2014}}Standing {{Nowrap|Successor 2,}} {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|8}}\u2014}}Standing {{Nowrap|Successor 3,}} and {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|9}}\u2014}}Standing {{Nowrap|Successor 4;}}\n* If legislators are not removed from the line of succession, only designate them as successors in cases where the president dies or resigns, not where he is disabled (to protect legislators from being forced to resign to act as president temporarily) or removed from office;\n* Eliminate the \"bumping provision\" in the Succession Act of 1947;\n* Clarify the ambiguity in the Succession Act of 1947 as to whether acting Cabinet secretaries are in the line of succession;\n* That the outgoing president nominate and the Senate confirm some of the incoming president's Cabinet secretaries prior to Inauguration Day, which is a particular point of vulnerability for the line of succession;\n* Establish statutory procedures for declaring 1) a dual inability of the president and the vice president, including where there is no vice president and 2) a sole inability of the vice president.<ref name=50after25th>{{cite journal | title=Second Fordham University School of Law Clinic on Presidential Succession, Fifty Years After the Twenty-Fifth Amendment: Recommendations for Improving the Presidential Succession System | journal=Fordham Law Review | url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5454&context=flr | volume=86 | issue=3 | year=2017 | pages=917\u20131025 | accessdate=June 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*  [[Central Locator System]]\n*  [[Designated survivor]] (term)\n*  [[List of United States presidential assassination attempts and plots]]\n*  [[United States presidential line of succession in fiction]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist-ua|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Baker, M.

Presidential succession is referred to multiple times in the [[U.S. Constitution]]{{snd}}[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 6: Vacancy and disability|Article II, Section 1, Clause 6]], as well as the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|12th Amendment]], [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|20th Amendment]], and [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]]. The [[vice president of the United States]] is designated as first in the presidential line of succession by the Article II succession clause, which also authorizes [[United States Congress|Congress]] to provide for a line of succession beyond the vice president; it has done so on three occasions. The current [[Presidential Succession Act]] was adopted in 1947, and last revised in 2006.\n\nThe line of succession follows the order of: vice president, [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|speaker of the House of Representatives]], [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president pro tempore of the Senate]], and then the eligible heads of [[United States federal executive departments|federal executive departments]] who form the president's [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]]. The Presidential Succession Act refers specifically to officers beyond the vice president ''acting as'' president rather than ''becoming'' president when filling a vacancy. The Cabinet currently has 15 members, of which the [[Secretary of State of the United States|secretary of state]] is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order of when their departments (or the department of which their department is the successor) were created. Those heads of department who are constitutionally ineligible to be elected to the presidency are disqualified from assuming the powers and duties of the president through succession, and skipped to the next in line. Since 1789, the vice president has succeeded to the presidency intra-term on nine occasions: eight times due to the incumbent's death, and once due to resignation. No one lower in the line of succession has been called upon to act as president.\n\nWidely considered a settled issue during the late 20th century, the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001]] demonstrated the potential for a [[decapitation strike]] that would kill or incapacitate multiple individuals in the presidential line of succession in addition to many members of Congress and the federal judiciary. In the years immediately following the attacks, there were numerous wide-ranging discussions in Congress, among academics and within the public policy community about [[continuity of government]] concerns including the existing constitutional and statutory provisions governing presidential succession. These discussions remain ongoing. One effort put forward by the [[Continuity of Government Commission]], a [[Nonpartisanism in the United States|nonpartisan]] [[think tank]], produced three reports (2003, 2009 and 2011), the second of which focused on the implicit ambiguities and limitations in the current succession act, and contained recommendations for amending the laws for succession to the presidency.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Current order ==\n\nThe table below details the current presidential order of succession as established by the 1947 presidential succession [[statute]] as amended.<ref>{{cite web | title=Title 3\u2014The President: Chapter 1\u2014Presidential Elections and Vacancies | url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2017-title3/pdf/USCODE-2017-title3-chap1.pdf | year=2017 | page=6 | publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office | location=Washington, D.C. | accessdate=January 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{usc|3|19}}</ref> The order is determined by the offices.

For example, from January 20, 2001, to June 6, 2001, the president pro tempore was then-98-year-old [[Strom Thurmond]].\n# A concern that the current line of succession can force the presidency to abruptly switch parties mid-term, as the president, speaker, and the president pro tempore are not necessarily of the same party as each other.\n# A concern that the succession line is ordered by the dates of creation of the various executive departments, without regard to the skills or capacities of the persons serving as secretary.\n# The fact that, should a Cabinet member begin to act as president, the law allows the House to elect a new speaker (or the Senate to elect a new president pro tempore), who could in effect remove the Cabinet member and assume the office themselves at any time.\n# The absence of a provision where a president is disabled and the vice presidency is vacant (for example, if an assassination attempt simultaneously wounded the president and killed the vice president).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.continuityofgovernment.org/pdfs/FirstReport.pdf | title=The Continuity of Congress: The First Report of the Continuity of Government Commission | series=Preserving Our Institutions | page=4 | publisher=Continuity of Government Commission | location=Washington, D.C. | date=May 2003 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625015852/http://www.continuityofgovernment.org/pdfs/FirstReport.pdf | archive-date=June 25, 2008 |url-status = dead| accessdate=December 28, 2008 | via=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the Continuity of Government Commission commented on the use of the term \"Officer\" in the 1947 statute,\n\n{{quote|The language in the current Presidential Succession Act is less clear than that of the 1886 Act with respect to Senate confirmation. The 1886 Act refers to \"such officers as shall have been appointed by the advice and consent of the Senate to the office therein named \u2026\" The current act merely refers to \"officers appointed, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.\" Read literally, this means that the current act allows for acting secretaries to be in the line of succession as long as they are confirmed by the Senate for a post (even for example, the second or third in command within a department). It is common for a second in command to become acting secretary when the secretary leaves office. Though there is some dispute over this provision, the language clearly permits acting secretaries to be placed in the line of succession. (We have spoken to acting secretaries who told us they had been placed in the line of succession.)<ref name=continuity2brookings/>}}\n \nIn 2016\u201317, the Second [[Fordham University School of Law]] Clinic on Presidential Succession developed a series of proposals to \"resolve succession issues that have received little attention from scholars and commissions\" over the past several decades; its recommendations included:\n\n* Remove legislators and several Cabinet members from the line of succession and adding four officials, or \"Standing Successors\", outside of Washington, D.C. The line of succession would be: {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|1}}\u2014}}Secretary of State, {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|2}}\u2014}}Secretary of Defense, {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|3}}\u2014}}Attorney General, {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|4}}\u2014}}Secretary of Homeland Security, {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|5}}\u2014}}Secretary of the Treasury, {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|6}}\u2014}}Standing {{Nowrap|Successor 1,}} {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|7}}\u2014}}Standing {{Nowrap|Successor 2,}} {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|8}}\u2014}}Standing {{Nowrap|Successor 3,}} and {{Nowrap|{{ordinal|9}}\u2014}}Standing {{Nowrap|Successor 4;}}\n* If legislators are not removed from the line of succession, only designate them as successors in cases where the president dies or resigns, not where he is disabled (to protect legislators from being forced to resign to act as president temporarily) or removed from office;\n* Eliminate the \"bumping provision\" in the Succession Act of 1947;\n* Clarify the ambiguity in the Succession Act of 1947 as to whether acting Cabinet secretaries are in the line of succession;\n* That the outgoing president nominate and the Senate confirm some of the incoming president's Cabinet secretaries prior to Inauguration Day, which is a particular point of vulnerability for the line of succession;\n* Establish statutory procedures for declaring 1) a dual inability of the president and the vice president, including where there is no vice president and 2) a sole inability of the vice president.<ref name=50after25th>{{cite journal | title=Second Fordham University School of Law Clinic on Presidential Succession, Fifty Years After the Twenty-Fifth Amendment: Recommendations for Improving the Presidential Succession System | journal=Fordham Law Review | url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5454&context=flr | volume=86 | issue=3 | year=2017 | pages=917\u20131025 | accessdate=June 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*  [[Central Locator System]]\n*  [[Designated survivor]] (term)\n*  [[List of United States presidential assassination attempts and plots]]\n*  [[United States presidential line of succession in fiction]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist-ua|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Baker, M.

Almost all speakers with a uvular {{IPA|/r/}} use all four of these realizations.{{sfnp|Sebregts|2014|p=97}}\n\nAmong alveolar articulations, he lists alveolar tap {{IPAblink|\u027e}}, voiced alveolar fricative {{IPAblink|\u0279\u031d}}, alveolar approximant {{IPAblink|\u0279}}, partially devoiced alveolar trill {{IPAblink|r\u0325}}, voiceless alveolar trill {{IPAblink|r\u0325}}, alveolar tapped or trilled fricative {{IPA|[{{IPAplink|\u027e\u031e}} ~ {{IPAplink|r\u031d}}]}}, voiceless alveolar tap {{IPAblink|\u027e\u0325}} and voiceless alveolar fricative {{IPAblink|\u0279\u031d\u030a}}. Among these, the tap is most common, whereas the taped/trilled fricative is the second most common realization. The partially devoiced alveolar trill occurred only once.{{sfnp|Sebregts|2014|p=97}}\n\n===Vowels===\n[[Image:Hasselt Limburgish monophthong chart.svg|thumb|250px|Monophthongs of the Hasselt dialect, from {{Harvcoltxt|Peters|2006|p=119}}]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:aut\"\n|+ [[Monophthong]] phonemes{{sfnp|Peters|2006|pp=118\u2013119}}\n! rowspan=\"3\" |\n! colspan=\"4\" | [[Front vowel|Front]]\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | {{small|[[Unrounded vowel|unrounded]]}}\n! colspan=\"2\" | {{small|[[Rounded vowel|rounded]]}}\n|-\n! {{small|short}}\n! {{small|long}}\n! {{small|short}}\n! {{small|long}}\n! {{small|short}}\n! {{small|long}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n!
