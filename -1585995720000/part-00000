Years later, his origin story was revamped to match the one conceived by writer [[Paul Dini]] for ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''. Dr. Victor Fries was a [[cryogenics]] expert in [[Gotham City]] who was caught in a laboratory mishap while attempting to cure his terminally ill wife, [[Nora Fries|Nora]]; the accident drastically lowered his body temperature to sub-zero levels, forcing him to wear a cryogenic suit in order to survive.

''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' retold Mr. Freeze's origin in \"[[Heart of Ice (Batman: The Animated Series episode)|Heart of Ice]]\", an episode by writer [[Paul Dini]].

As a child, he was fascinated with cryonic preservation, so he begins freezing animals. His parents are horrified by his \"hobby\" and send him to a strict boarding school, where he is miserable and feels detached from humanity. In college, he meets a woman named [[Nora Fries|Nora]], whom he ultimately marries.<ref name=\"UGO - Freeze\"/>\n\nNora contracts a fatal illness 1\u00bd years after Bruce Wayne becomes Batman, so Fries begins developing a freeze ray for [[List of locations of the DC Universe|GothCorp]] in order to preserve her in suspended animation until a cure can be found. Fries' boss Ferris Boyle decides to tell the mob about the gun, leading Batman to create a team of specialists to help him do his job better. As Fries puts Nora in suspended animation, Boyle interrupts and tampers with the experiment, resulting in an explosion that kills Nora. Fries survives, but the chemicals in the freeze ray lower his body temperature to the point that he must wear a cryogenic suit in order to survive. He swears revenge on those responsible for the death of his wife (whom he talks to often), and becomes Mr. Freeze, the first superpowered villain whom Batman faces in this continuity. Eventually, Batman's operatives find Freeze, who shoots one of them with his freeze gun, but Batman eventually apprehends him.<ref name=\"UGO - Freeze\"/> Initially locked in [[Arkham Asylum]], Freeze was eventually transferred to the Gotham State Penitentiary, from where he escaped and attempted to steal technology from [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] until he was stopped and returned to prison by Batman.<ref>''Detective Comic'' #595</ref>\n\nFreeze's crimes tend to involve freezing everyone and everything that he encounters<ref name=\"UGO - Freeze\"/> so he never forges alliances with the other criminals in Gotham, preferring to work alone. On rare occasions, he has worked with another member of Batman's rogues gallery, usually as an enforcer for Gotham's mob bosses, such as the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]] during his [[Batman: City of Crime|reign]] <ref>''Detective comics'' #804-806</ref> or [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] during the [[Batman: Under the Hood|return]] of [[Jason Todd]].<ref>''Batman'' #635</ref><ref>''Batman'' #836</ref> In one of his notable team-ups, Freeze constructs a cryogenic machine for [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] so that Hush might take revenge on Batman, Freeze's equipment allowing Hush to preserve [[Catwoman]]'s surgically removed heart to use as a means of threatening her life.<ref>''Detective Comics'' #850</ref>\n\nAfter Batman's [[Batman RIP|death]], most of the Arkham inmates were [[Batman: Battle for the Cowl|freed]] by a [[Jeremiah Arkham|new Black Mask]]. Freeze was among them and he started working on a project called Ice-X Protocol when the GCPD tried to capture him. He stunned them with his gun and captured Gordon, taking him to his secret lair. Gordon managed to break free and defeat Freeze by causing an explosion that weakened Freeze. After his capture, Freeze was taken to [[Iron Heights]] prison.<ref>''Battle for the Cowl: Commissioner Gordon'' #1</ref>\n\nDuring his time with the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], he fashions a sub-zero machine for [[Nyssa Raatko|Nyssa al Ghul]] in exchange for the use of her [[Lazarus Pit]]. He attempts to restore Nora to life without waiting for the adjusting needed in the pool chemicals; she returns to life as the twisted Lazara and escapes.

In this new timeline, during the ''[[Night of the Owls]]'' crossover, the [[Court of Owls]] sends assassins known as Talons to kill 40 of the most important citizens of Gotham, including Mr. Freeze.

Here, Victor Fries' fascination with cryonics began when he was a boy and his mother fell through the ice of a frozen lake. The ice was able to keep her preserved long enough for help to arrive, thus sparking his lifelong obsession with the cold. It is later revealed that the accident left Fries' mother in constant pain, and Fries ended her suffering by pushing her into the same frozen lake. In this new origin, Nora was never Fries' wife. Her name was Nora Fields, a woman born in 1943. When Nora was 23, she was diagnosed with incurable heart disease, so her family placed her in cryogenic stasis hoping that a cure would be found in the future. Fries, having written his doctoral thesis on Nora, took on a position as a cryogenic researcher and technician at Wayne Enterprises, the facility that housed Nora's body.\n\nEventually, he fell in love with Nora and became dedicated to finding a reliable method for slowly thawing cryogenic subjects. However, Bruce Wayne ordered the project to be shut down, as he began to feel uncomfortable with Fries' obsession with Nora. Furious, Fries hurled a chair at Wayne, who dodged the attack; the chair smashed into an array of cryonic chemical tanks, the contents of which sprayed onto Fries and transformed him into Mr. Freeze.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Scott Snyder|Snyder, Scott]]|penciller=[[Jason Fabok|Fabok, Jason]]|inker=[[Jason Fabok|Fabok, Jason]]|colorist=[[Peter Steigerwald|Steigerwald, Peter]]|letterer=[[Sal Cipriano|Cipriano, Sal]]|editor=[[Mike Marts|Marts, Mike]]|story=Night of the Owls: First Snow|title=[[Batman Annual]]|volume=2|issue=#1|date=July 2012|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=[[New York City]]}}</ref>\n\nThe Court of Owls uses Freeze's cryogenic-thaw formula to revive their Talons, and then they try to kill him.

Freeze decides to kill Bruce Wayne and takes Nora, whom he believes to be his wife so that they can leave [[Gotham City]] behind forever. Infiltrating [[Wayne Enterprises]], Freeze has a brief fight with [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] and [[Damian Wayne|Robin]], but he subdues them. Then, Freeze goes to the penthouse, where he finds Batman and the frozen Nora.

In this series, Victor Fries has retired from his criminal lifestyle to focus on curing his wife's disease. It is later revealed that, due to his unique, cryogenically-dependent physiology, Fries's aging had been slowed considerably, and that his father was a member of the Nazi SS during the Second World War, but acted as a double agent, allowing America to stay one step ahead of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] on the scientific front. As a result of this, a massive freeze cannon was constructed beneath a lighthouse off the coast of [[Gotham City]]. The superweapon is discovered by Neo-Joker (the second [[Harley Quinn]] who felt that by taking pills to retain his sanity, [[Joker (character)|Jack Napier]] was destroying the most beautiful part of himself) and is used to freeze most, if not all, of Gotham. Freeze is able to reverse the effects with the aid of [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]]. It is also revealed that Fries had been contacted by Batman in an attempt to secure the villain's aid to save the life of [[Alfred Pennyworth]], but unfortunately, their efforts were in vain.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n====Live-action====\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header    =\n | width1    = 180\n | width2    = 180\n | image1    = Otto Preminger Mr. Freeze.jpg\n | caption1  = [[Otto Preminger]] as Mr. Freeze\n | image2    = Wallach Freeze.jpg\n | caption2  = [[Eli Wallach]] as Mr. Freeze\n}}\n\n* Mr. Freeze appeared in the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series, portrayed by [[George Sanders]] in the first two-part appearance, [[Otto Preminger]] in the second two-part appearance, and [[Eli Wallach]] in the third two-part appearance.<ref name=\"Freeze 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bat-mania.co.uk/main/villains/mr_freeze.php|title=Batmania UK: 1966 Batman: Villains: Mr. Freeze|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Bat-Mania}}</ref><ref name=\"Freeze 2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bat-mania.co.uk/main/villains/mr_freeze2.php|title=Batmania UK: 1966 Batman: Villains: Mr. Freeze 2|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Bat-Mania}}</ref><ref name=\"Freeze 3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bat-mania.co.uk/main/villains/mr_freeze3.php|title=Batmania UK: 1966 Batman: Villains: Mr. Freeze 3|accessdate=2008-05-09|publisher=Bat-Mania}}</ref> Sanders and Wallach used [[German language|German]] [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accents]] for the role while Preminger used his own Austrian accent.

Freeze ends up stealing diamonds from the Gotham City Diamond Exchange. When Batman and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] try to stop him, he freezes them with his freeze gun. In the next episode \"Rats Like Cheese\", Mr. Freeze kidnaps Paul Diamante of the Gotham City Eagles and offers to return his hostage in exchange for Batman. Batman and Robin save Diamante and apprehend Freeze. During this appearance, Mr. Freeze's hideout has \"warm lights\" so that his henchmen can interact with him. In the episode \"Green Ice\", Mr. Freeze escapes from prison and captures [[Miss Iceland]] from the finals of the Miss Galaxy Pageant. In the next episode \"Deep Freeze\", Mr. Freeze has led all of Gotham City to believe that Batman has given in to his bribes. Batman and Robin managed to find Freeze's hideout, rescue Miss Iceland, and defeat Freeze before he can freeze all of Gotham. Batman arranges for Warden Crichton to have a special refrigerated cell made for Mr. Freeze. In the episode \"Ice Spy\", Mr. Freeze kidnaps Icelandic scientist Professor Isaacson in order to obtain an \"Instant Ice\" formula. In the episode \"The Duo Defy\", Mr. Freeze finally obtains the \"Instant Ice\" formula and ends up building a large freeze ray. He is thwarted by Batman and Robin again.

In the film, Dr. Victor Fries was in an accident in a cryogenics lab he was using to find a cure for his wife Nora Fries suffering from the (fictional) [[terminal illness]] MacGregor's Syndrome and is now dependent on a [[diamond]]-powered sub-zero suit to keep cold or he would die. Mister Freeze crashes a charity event held by Wayne Enterprises and steals a diamond from the event. Mister Freeze is captured by Batman and detained at Arkham Asylum, but flees with the help of [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] and Bane. Ivy cuts off Nora's [[life support]] and deceives Mister Freeze into thinking that Batman was responsible for the deed as part of a plan to use him to freeze up Gotham City. With the use of a gigantic ray gun stationed in an observatory, he freezes over the entirety of Gotham. In a subsequent fight with Batman, Mr. Freeze destroys the observatory with a set of bombs (planted by Bane) in an unsuccessful attempt to take Batman with him. Batman shows Mr. Freeze a recording of Ivy during her fight with Batgirl in which she brags about killing Nora, revealing her real colours to him. Batman tells Mr. Freeze that his wife is not dead; she was restored and moved to Arkham, where he can complete his research. Batman asks him for the cure he created for the first stage of MacGregor's Syndrome for [[Alfred Pennyworth]]; Mr. Freeze atones for his past actions by giving Batman the medicine he had developed. Freeze is then detained at Arkham where he exacts his revenge on Ivy for her deception and treachery.

He is seen with the \"Cold Warriors\" [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle Jr.]] (Cameron Mahkent), [[Killer Frost]] (Louise Lincoln) and [[Captain Cold]] when they are among the villains trying to claim the bounty on Superman and Batman. After a brief fight with Batman, they are all defeated by Superman's heat vision.\n* At the end of ''[[Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox]]'', Mr. Freeze's freeze gun can be seen in the Batcave.\n* In ''[[Batman: Assault on Arkham]]'', Mr. Freeze's freeze gun is found and used by [[Killer Frost]] (Louise Lincoln) against Batman in the Arkham Asylum warehouse.\n* An alternate universe version of Victor Fries appears in ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters]]'', voiced by [[Jim Meskimen]]. He was a Nobel prize-winning thermal expert who was part of [[Lex Luthor]]'s \"Project Fair Play\", a weapons program contingency that would be used to destroy the Justice League if necessary. Fries was measuring atmospheric carbon levels near the Arctic Circle before being murdered by a [[Metal Men|Metal Man]] designed by [[Will Magnus]] to frame [[Man-Bat|Batman]] for the crime.\n* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Batman Unlimited: Mechs vs. Mutants]]'', voiced by [[Oded Fehr]]. His origin is above the same, except this version has banished himself to the Arctic because he believes that \"he's not fit for humanity.\" until he is employed by Penguin to mutate Killer Croc and Chemo into giant monsters and freeze Gotham for revenge. With their plan almost complete, Penguin betrays him by secretly giving Bane and Clayface the same formula without knowing. Now filled with guilt for what he's done, Freeze decided to help Batman and his team to stop Penguin.\n* Mr. Freeze made a cameo appearance in the 2016 animated film ''[[Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders]]'' (which is a continuation of the 1966 ''Batman'' TV series). This version resembles an orange-haired version of Eli Wallach's depiction of Mr. Freeze. He along with other supervillains team up with Robin and Catwoman in order to stop a group of clone rogue Batmen.\n* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'', voiced by David Burrows. This version of Mr. Freeze resembles the one from ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and uses a robotic mech equipped with a freeze gun. He is among the Batman villains that assist Joker in his attack on Gotham City. At the time when Joker was planning to set off a bomb, Mr. Freeze was present during this plot where he fights Batman and retreats. Later on, during the ceremony where Barbara Gordon is being sworn in as the new police commissioner, Joker assigns Mr. Freeze and Clayface to capture her. Though Barbara Gordon does a trick that causes Mr. Freeze to accidentally freeze Clayface. During the fight against the Phantom Zone inmates, Mr. Freeze and Clayface defeat the [[Kraken]] from ''[[Clash of the Titans (franchise)|Clash of the Titans]]''.\n* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]. Freeze is mutated into an anthropomorphic [[polar bear]] when Joker spreads mutagen to all of the [[Arkham Asylum]] inmates. He fights and with [[Damian Wayne]], [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]] and [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]] in the kitchen before they retreat. He then freezes Batman in place, allowing Joker to mutate him into an unhinged bat creature, which then slams Victor through the floor and proceeds to maul him. It is unknown whether he survived.\n\n===Video games===\nMr. Freeze also appears in several ''Batman'' video games:\n* He is a boss in ''Batman: The Animated Series'', ''The Adventures of Batman & Robin'' for the [[Sega Genesis]] in which Mr. Freeze was the game's final boss.\n* Mr. Freeze appears in the video game adaptation of the movie ''Batman & Robin''.\n* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Batman: Chaos in Gotham]]''.\n* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Batman Vengeance]]'', with Michael Ansara reprised his role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/batman-vengeance|title=Batman Vengeance - MobyGames|accessdate=2008-05-10|publisher=Moby Games}}</ref> He was seen targeting a scientist named Isaac Evers, whom he blames for sending him a video promoting Promethium gas in order to spite him, unaware that the real culprit was the Joker planning to use Mr. Freeze's invasion of the lab as a distraction to steal large quantities of the gas.\n* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Batman: Dark Tomorrow]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamestop.com/Catalog/ProductDetails.aspx?product_id=15788|title=Game Stop - Batman Vengeance|accessdate=2008-05-08|publisher=Game Stop|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503041737/http://www.gamestop.com/Catalog/ProductDetails.aspx?product_id=15788|archivedate=2008-05-03|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamestop.com/Catalog/ProductDetails.aspx?product_id=21120|title=Game Stop - Batman: Dark Tomorrow|accessdate=2008-05-08|publisher=Game Stop|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409030251/http://www.gamestop.com/Catalog/ProductDetails.aspx?product_id=21120|archivedate=2008-04-09|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Matt|last=Casarnassina|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/166/166827p1.html|title=IGN: Batman Vengeance Review|accessdate=2008-05-10|date=2001-11-19|publisher=IGN}}</ref>\n* Mr. Freeze is also one of the main villains in the PC game ''Toxic Chill''. Mr. Freeze pairs up with the Riddler in an attempt to change the very weather of Gotham. He is eventually betrayed and nearly killed by the Riddler who sets off a volcanic eruption. Both are sent to Arkham Asylum and are made cellmates. It is suggested that Mr. Freeze tortures the Riddler in Arkham as revenge for his treachery.\n* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'', voiced by [[Robert Kraft]].{{citation needed|date=January 2010}} Freeze appears when the player, using a Villain character, is attempting to steal some diamonds from a Wayne Enterprises warehouse. Joker orders the player via communicator to give the diamonds to Freeze, only to later command him or her to go inside Freeze's base in Gotham Mercy Hospital and steal the diamonds back, right when Freeze is once again trying to bring back Nora and thus sabotaging the procedure. The villain player must then confront Mr. Freeze, who is enraged and willing to kill the player. Freeze also appears in the Arkham Asylum alert, where he has allied with Scarecrow and Poison Ivy to spread chaos in the Asylum, under doctor Jeremiah Arkham's orders. Freeze has taken over one of the wings in the asylum, covering the whole area with ice and snow. The team of four players (Heroes or Villains) must defeat Freeze one time in his area, and then face him again when he is fighting side by side with Scarecrow and Ivy.\n* Mr. Freeze appears in the 2013 arcade game ''[[Batman (2013 arcade game)|Batman]]''.\n* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Injustice 2]]'', voiced by [[Jim Pirri]], as a \"Premier Skin\" for [[Captain Cold]]. In his initial appearance, he did not wear the protective helmet, which was later added in an update.\n* Mr. Freeze appears in [[Telltale Games]]' ''[[Batman: The Enemy Within]]'', voiced by [[Matthew Mercer]]. Unlike most iterations of the character, his condition does not confine him entirely to the suit and he uses a specialized glove that freezes anything it touches, as opposed to the traditional freeze gun. Mr. Freeze is a member of the Pact, alongside [[Joker (character)|\"John Doe\"]], [[Riddler]], [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], and [[Harley Quinn]]. He joins the group to retrieve the LOTUS virus, hoping to use it to cure Nora. However, during the raid at the lab where it is kept, he is betrayed by Quinn and infected with the virus. In return for information about her whereabouts, Freeze asks Bruce Wayne/Batman to lower his confinement's temperature, hoping to combat his infection. Regardless of the decision, his fate is left ambiguous.\n\n====Lego====\n* Mr. Freeze appears ''[[Lego Batman: The Video Game]]'', with his vocal effects provided by [[Ogie Banks]]. He appears as an enemy of [[Batman]], a follower of the [[Riddler]]<ref>''Game Informer'' features a two-page gallery of the many heroes and villains who appear in the game with a picture for each character and a descriptive paragraph. See \"''LEGO Batman'': Character Gallery\", ''Game Informer'' 186 (October 2008): 93.</ref> and the second boss of Chapter 1 \"The Riddler's Revenge\". In it his design is based mainly on the animated series and he uses his freeze gun to freeze enemies and water. The strength granted to him by his suit allows him to pick up objects others cannot. His suit also protects him from toxins. The Riddler assigns him to get a freeze cannon in his old factory. It is shown in the story that, while he aids the Riddler in his pursuit for Gotham City's gold reserves, he is shown to be formulating plans of his own, which involve raising an army of Freeze Maids, which he uses in his boss fight. The player has to be quick and attack him right after he shuts down his freeze gun. After he is defeated, he attempts to run away, but Batman throws a Batarang at him, causing his pack to backfire and make him bounce across the room and then land on the floor in front of Batman and [[Robin (character)|Robin]]. In the ending cutscene, he is seen in [[Arkham Asylum]] playing with dolls of him and a Freeze Maid.\n* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Townsend Coleman]]. He appears as a cameo in the fourth level \"Asylum Assignment\", where he is seen in a cell constantly tapping on the glass. In Free-play mode, the player can actually kill him once s/he sends one of the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin's]] bombs inside and attacks him. Outside of the story, he appears as a boss fight and an unlockable character found at the observatory. His intro catchphrase is, \"Is it just me, or is it really cold in here?\"\n* Mr. Freeze appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'', voiced by [[Liam O'Brien]] doing a terrible [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] impression. He first appears as a boss in the story, on which the player helps [[Plastic Man]] defeat him in the Watchtower so that they can proceed to defeat [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]. The player as Batman in his Sensor-suit must attack Mr. Freeze while the character is in stealth mode. Mr. Freeze is later found in [[Qward]] in a side-quest where he requests the player to find another fuel cell for his freezer after the other was damaged by [[Killer Moth]]. The ''Batman Beyond'' version of Mr. Freeze is also playable via downloadable content.\n* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', voiced again by [[Eric Bauza]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicsbeat.com/sdcc18-lego-dc-super-villains-cast-and-devs-dish-on-funever-evil/ | title=Syndicated Comics| date=2018-07-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://mailchi.mp/mi5communications/lego-dc-super-villains-reveals-darkseids-villainy-in-action-in-new-clip-890165?e=49aaf48973 | title=Lego\u00ae DC Super-Villains Reveals Darkseid's Villainy in Action in New Clip}}</ref>\n\n====''Batman: Arkham''====\n* Mr. Freeze appears in the ''Batman Arkham'' series where he is voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]].\n** In ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'', Mr. Freeze's frost and icicle covered cell can be seen in the Penitentiary area which can be scanned to unlock his bio. According to the game's writer [[Paul Dini]], Freeze was originally planned to be featured in the game, but his inclusion was dropped as he did not fit as part of the game.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/6126146/Batman-Arkham-Asylum-interview-with-Paul-Dini.html | title=Batman: Arkham Asylum interview with Paul Dini| date=2009-09-02| last1=Cowen| first1=Nick}}</ref>\n** In ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', he appears as both an ally to Batman and a [[boss battle]]. After the Joker poisons Batman, the Dark Knight has to find Mr. Freeze. Batman searches for him in the GCPD building (literally the coldest place in Arkham City), only to find his lab swarmed by the Penguin's men, who reveal that Penguin is holding Mr. Freeze hostage in the Cyrus Pinkney National History Institute. It is revealed that Penguin stole Mr. Freeze's gun and is holding GCPD officers hostage. Batman saves the hostages and Mr. Freeze from Penguin's men in the museum and asks Mr. Freeze for the cure to his ailment, only for Mr. Freeze to reveal he needs his suit, which Penguin possesses. He tells Batman that his suit has a disruptor that can be used to turn off his freeze gun so that he can defeat Penguin. After Penguin is apprehended and Mr. Freeze recovers his suit, he gets revenge by locking Penguin in a display case. Mr. Freeze then tells Batman that the cure he made for Joker degenerates too quickly and needs a restorative enzyme that has been bonded to human DNA, something that would take decades, only for Batman to reveal he knows [[Ra's al Ghul|someone]] who has been exposed to that enzyme for centuries. Mr. Freeze tells Batman he only needs a sample of this person's DNA to complete the cure and Batman proceeds to track down one of the warriors of the [[League of Assassins]] Penguin had captured. When Batman returns to the GCPD with the blood sample, Mr. Freeze creates two vials of the cure before locking one in a safe and destroying the other, demanding Batman save [[Nora Fries]] from Joker. Batman fights Mr. Freeze to unlock the safe, which proves difficult as Mr. Freeze is much too powerful to be confronted directly. Batman is forced to hide and find ways to stun Mr. Freeze, such as using grates in the floor to surprise him as he passes by. Each time Mr. Freeze is incapacitated, he counteracts his weaknesses. After he is beaten, Batman opens the safe only to find that the wall behind the safe was broken into and in the place of the cure there is only a note saying: \"Get well soon!\" and some joker cards. Batman realizes that [[Harley Quinn]] had stolen the cure while the Dark Knight was distracted fighting Mr. Freeze. Mr. Freeze gives Batman freeze grenades to help him retrieve the cure and begs him to find Nora, which becomes a side mission in the game. After Nora is saved, Batman finds Mr. Freeze with his wife and tells him to end his life of crime for Nora's sake. Mr. Freeze's boss battle was widely praised as a step up from the repetitive titan thug bosses from the previous game.\n** In ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', his origin and first encounter with Batman is featured in the DLC story \"Cold, Cold Heart\" which is based on the ''Batman: The Animated Series'' episode \"Heart of Ice\". Mr. Freeze also has a new design for the downloadable content (DLC), featuring cleated boots and a larger freeze gun built into the right arm of his suit. In the DLC, Mr. Freeze is in collaboration with the Penguin's gang in order to crash a party at Wayne Manor in order to capture Ferris Boyle. When Batman arrives at GothCorp, he finds Penguin trying to force Mr. Freeze to give him what Freeze is after (thinking it to be weapons) until Mr. Freeze uses his freeze gun to create a chain reaction that traps Penguin in a wall of ice. Upon getting the X-E suit to withstand the cold and acquiring a cryogenic drill to penetrate the ice wall, Batman finds residual evidence that Boyle was behind the accident that turned Victor Fries into Mr. Freeze and that Boyle is in possession of Mr. Freeze's cryogenically frozen wife. Batman later confronts and defeats Mr. Freeze. Boyle then takes a piece of machinery and attacks Mr. Freeze, only for Batman to knock out Boyle. During the DLC's credits, a news voiceover states that Mr. Freeze, Penguin, and Boyle have been all arrested by the police.\n** Mr. Freeze is featured in ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]''. Mr. Freeze's freeze gun can be found in the evidence room at the [[Gotham City Police Department]]. According to Aaron Cash, Mr. Freeze has not been seen or heard since ''Arkham City'' and implies that he possibly gave up his criminal life to continue his work on finding a cure for Nora Fries. There was also a mentioning that the freeze gun was used by some members of the Gotham City Police Department to make ice cream until it was confiscated from them by James Gordon. Mr. Freeze appears in the December \"Season of Infamy\" downloadable content (DLC) pack in the side mission \"In From The Cold\". Batman discovers a frozen vessel just off the coast of Gotham and investigates, finding Mr. Freeze at his wife's old cryogenic chamber. He says that the Arkham Knight's Militia took Nora after he refused to help Scarecrow and Arkham Knight with their plans to take down Batman. Freeze entrusts Batman to rescue his wife from the soldiers. After fighting through a barrage of Militia henchmen, Batman finds Nora and breaks her out of her damaged cryo-chamber. Much to both Batman and Freeze's surprise, she no longer wants to be frozen in ice and simply wants to spend time with Victor. It is also revealed that she could hear every word he said, despite being in suspended animation. After taking down a Militia force trying to destroy Fries' vessel, Nora and Victor meet face-to-face and Victor removes his protective helmet. As they look off at Gotham, Nora asks how long they will live, to which Victor replies \"merely days\". They then depart Gotham City; when Batman analyses Freeze's equipment in the GCPD lockup, a recording made by Cash ponders whether this turn of events is a happy or sad outcome for the Frieses.\n** Mr. Freeze appears as a playable character in the mobile game ''Batman: Arkham Underworld''. He is unlocked after the player completes a mission for him, after which he becomes playable, wielding his freeze gun with different firing modes.\n\n===Web series===\n* In the third season of the [[Flash animation|Flash]] series ''[[Gotham Girls]]'', a new villain is introduced: '''Dora Smithy''' (voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]), Mr. Freeze's sister-in-law. She blames Freeze for Nora's death and dons his freezing equipment in a quest for revenge. As a result, there is an emphasis on Mr. Freeze himself throughout the season, and he is discussed several times, although he never actually makes an appearance.\n* In the ''[[Batman Unlimited]]'' shorts, Mr. Freeze appears on a rampage in a giant robot suit. Batman manages to destroy the suit and Freeze ejects. Freeze then attacks Batman, only for Batman to shatter his helmet. Batman puts a gas mask on him and handcuffs him, comforting Mr. Freeze until the cops arrive.\n* In ''[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]'', Mr.Freeze (voiced by [[Alfred Molina]]) is first mentioned in season 1, then makes his full appearance in the season 2 premiere, \"New Gotham\", as a member of the [[Injustice League]]. Following the Joker destroying Gotham in the season one finale, Mr. Freeze joined forces with Bane, Riddler, Penguin, and Two-Face to form the Injustice League and seize control. When Harley interferes with their plans, they attempt to make peace with her, but she refuses. In response, Freeze has her frozen and put on display in Penguin's Iceberg Lounge. Over the course of the following two months, Freeze and his allies divided Gotham's ruins between them and dubbed it \"New New Gotham\".\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n* Mr. Freeze appears in the direct-to-video original animation ''[[DC Super Friends]]: The Joker's Playhouse'' (2010), voiced by [[Eric Bauza]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Batman Family adversaries]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Batman (comics)#Mr. Freeze|Mr. Freeze}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080512015349/http://batman.ugo.com/roguesgallery/mrfreeze/default.asp Mr. Freeze UGO profile]\n*{{gcdb|type=character|search=Mr.+Freeze|title=Mr. Freeze}}\n*{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=1584|title=Mr. Freeze}}\n*{{DCdatabase|Mister Freeze}}\n\n{{Batman characters}}\n{{Batgirl}}\n{{Outsiders (comics)}}\n{{Robin}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Freeze, Mr.}}\n[[Category:DC Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Batman characters]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Bob Kane]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1959]]\n[[Category:DC Comics metahumans]]\n[[Category:Fictional assassins]]\n[[Category:DC Comics television characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with ice or cold abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with slowed aging]]\n[[Category:Fictional chemical engineers]]\n[[Category:Fictional cryonically preserved characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Fictional cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Fictional inventors]]\n[[Category:Fictional life scientists]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional matricides]]\n[[Category:Fictional physicians]]\n[[Category:Superhero film characters]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Male characters in film]]\n[[Category:Male film villains]]\n[[Category:Action film villains]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the comic book character|the ''Gotham'' episode|Mr. Freeze (Gotham episode)|the roller coaster|Mr. Freeze (roller coaster)}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{short description|Fictional character throughout the DC Universe}}\n{{Infobox comics character\n| character_name = Mr. Freeze\n| image          = Mr. Freeze Batman Annual Vol 2 1.png\n| caption        = Mr. Freeze in ''Batman Annual'' #1 (July 2012).<br>Art by Jason Fabok.\n| real_name      = Victor Fries\n| publisher      = [[DC Comics]]\n| first_comic    = '''As Mr. Zero:'''<br/>''Batman'' #121 (February 1959)<br>'''As Mr. Freeze:'''<br>''[[Detective Comics]]'' #373 (March 1968)\n| first_series   = '''As Mr. Freeze:'''<br/>[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]<br/>\"[[Instant Freeze]]\"/\"[[Rats Like Cheese]]\"<br/>'''As Victor Fries:'''<br/>[[Batman: The Animated Series]]<br/>\"[[Heart of Ice (Batman: The Animated Series episode)|Heart of Ice]]\"\n| first_episode  = \n| creators       = '''As Mr. Zero''':<br/>Dave Wood (writer)<br/>[[Sheldon Moldoff]] (artist)<br/>[[Bob Kane]] (concept)<br/>'''As Victor Fries''':<br/>[[Paul Dini]] (writer)<br/>[[Bruce Timm]] (artist)\n| alliances      = [[Injustice League]]<br>[[Secret Society of Super Villains]]<br>GothCorp\n| aliases        = Mr. Zero<br>Dr. Schivel<br>Crown Prince of Chilblains<br>King of Cold\n| powers         = \n* Genius-level intellect\n* Sub-zero physiology allows survival at extremely low temperatures\n* Refrigerated [[Powered exoskeleton|exo-skeletal battle suit]] grants superhuman strength and durability\n* Utilizes [[cryogenic]] weaponry\n| cat            = super\n| subcat         = DC Comics\n| hero           = n\n| villain        = y\n}}\n\n'''Mr. Freeze''' ('''Dr. Victor Fries''') is a [[character (arts)|fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book|American]] [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]].

Years later, his origin story was revamped to match the one conceived by writer [[Paul Dini]] for ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''. Dr. Victor Fries was a [[cryogenics]] expert in [[Gotham City]] who was caught in a laboratory mishap while attempting to cure his terminally ill wife, [[Nora Fries|Nora]]; the accident drastically lowered his body temperature to sub-zero levels, forcing him to wear a cryogenic suit in order to survive.

As a child, he was fascinated with cryonic preservation, so he begins freezing animals. His parents are horrified by his \"hobby\" and send him to a strict boarding school, where he is miserable and feels detached from humanity. In college, he meets a woman named [[Nora Fries|Nora]], whom he ultimately marries.<ref name=\"UGO - Freeze\"/>\n\nNora contracts a fatal illness 1\u00bd years after Bruce Wayne becomes Batman, so Fries begins developing a freeze ray for [[List of locations of the DC Universe|GothCorp]] in order to preserve her in suspended animation until a cure can be found. Fries' boss Ferris Boyle decides to tell the mob about the gun, leading Batman to create a team of specialists to help him do his job better. As Fries puts Nora in suspended animation, Boyle interrupts and tampers with the experiment, resulting in an explosion that kills Nora. Fries survives, but the chemicals in the freeze ray lower his body temperature to the point that he must wear a cryogenic suit in order to survive. He swears revenge on those responsible for the death of his wife (whom he talks to often), and becomes Mr. Freeze, the first superpowered villain whom Batman faces in this continuity. Eventually, Batman's operatives find Freeze, who shoots one of them with his freeze gun, but Batman eventually apprehends him.<ref name=\"UGO - Freeze\"/> Initially locked in [[Arkham Asylum]], Freeze was eventually transferred to the Gotham State Penitentiary, from where he escaped and attempted to steal technology from [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] until he was stopped and returned to prison by Batman.<ref>''Detective Comic'' #595</ref>\n\nFreeze's crimes tend to involve freezing everyone and everything that he encounters<ref name=\"UGO - Freeze\"/> so he never forges alliances with the other criminals in Gotham, preferring to work alone. On rare occasions, he has worked with another member of Batman's rogues gallery, usually as an enforcer for Gotham's mob bosses, such as the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]] during his [[Batman: City of Crime|reign]] <ref>''Detective comics'' #804-806</ref> or [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] during the [[Batman: Under the Hood|return]] of [[Jason Todd]].<ref>''Batman'' #635</ref><ref>''Batman'' #836</ref> In one of his notable team-ups, Freeze constructs a cryogenic machine for [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] so that Hush might take revenge on Batman, Freeze's equipment allowing Hush to preserve [[Catwoman]]'s surgically removed heart to use as a means of threatening her life.<ref>''Detective Comics'' #850</ref>\n\nAfter Batman's [[Batman RIP|death]], most of the Arkham inmates were [[Batman: Battle for the Cowl|freed]] by a [[Jeremiah Arkham|new Black Mask]]. Freeze was among them and he started working on a project called Ice-X Protocol when the GCPD tried to capture him. He stunned them with his gun and captured Gordon, taking him to his secret lair. Gordon managed to break free and defeat Freeze by causing an explosion that weakened Freeze. After his capture, Freeze was taken to [[Iron Heights]] prison.<ref>''Battle for the Cowl: Commissioner Gordon'' #1</ref>\n\nDuring his time with the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], he fashions a sub-zero machine for [[Nyssa Raatko|Nyssa al Ghul]] in exchange for the use of her [[Lazarus Pit]]. He attempts to restore Nora to life without waiting for the adjusting needed in the pool chemicals; she returns to life as the twisted Lazara and escapes.

In this new timeline, during the ''[[Night of the Owls]]'' crossover, the [[Court of Owls]] sends assassins known as Talons to kill 40 of the most important citizens of Gotham, including Mr. Freeze.

Here, Victor Fries' fascination with cryonics began when he was a boy and his mother fell through the ice of a frozen lake. The ice was able to keep her preserved long enough for help to arrive, thus sparking his lifelong obsession with the cold. It is later revealed that the accident left Fries' mother in constant pain, and Fries ended her suffering by pushing her into the same frozen lake. In this new origin, Nora was never Fries' wife. Her name was Nora Fields, a woman born in 1943. When Nora was 23, she was diagnosed with incurable heart disease, so her family placed her in cryogenic stasis hoping that a cure would be found in the future. Fries, having written his doctoral thesis on Nora, took on a position as a cryogenic researcher and technician at Wayne Enterprises, the facility that housed Nora's body.\n\nEventually, he fell in love with Nora and became dedicated to finding a reliable method for slowly thawing cryogenic subjects. However, Bruce Wayne ordered the project to be shut down, as he began to feel uncomfortable with Fries' obsession with Nora. Furious, Fries hurled a chair at Wayne, who dodged the attack; the chair smashed into an array of cryonic chemical tanks, the contents of which sprayed onto Fries and transformed him into Mr. Freeze.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Scott Snyder|Snyder, Scott]]|penciller=[[Jason Fabok|Fabok, Jason]]|inker=[[Jason Fabok|Fabok, Jason]]|colorist=[[Peter Steigerwald|Steigerwald, Peter]]|letterer=[[Sal Cipriano|Cipriano, Sal]]|editor=[[Mike Marts|Marts, Mike]]|story=Night of the Owls: First Snow|title=[[Batman Annual]]|volume=2|issue=#1|date=July 2012|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=[[New York City]]}}</ref>\n\nThe Court of Owls uses Freeze's cryogenic-thaw formula to revive their Talons, and then they try to kill him. Freeze survives but is captured by the Red Hood and sent to [[Arkham Asylum]]. He escapes shortly afterward and rearms himself with the Penguin's help. Freeze decides to kill Bruce Wayne and takes Nora, whom he believes to be his wife so that they can leave [[Gotham City]] behind forever. Infiltrating [[Wayne Enterprises]], Freeze has a brief fight with [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] and [[Damian Wayne|Robin]], but he subdues them. Then, Freeze goes to the penthouse, where he finds Batman and the frozen Nora.

Ivy cuts off Nora's [[life support]] and deceives Mister Freeze into thinking that Batman was responsible for the deed as part of a plan to use him to freeze up Gotham City. With the use of a gigantic ray gun stationed in an observatory, he freezes over the entirety of Gotham. In a subsequent fight with Batman, Mr. Freeze destroys the observatory with a set of bombs (planted by Bane) in an unsuccessful attempt to take Batman with him.

Batman asks him for the cure he created for the first stage of MacGregor's Syndrome for [[Alfred Pennyworth]]; Mr. Freeze atones for his past actions by giving Batman the medicine he had developed. Freeze is then detained at Arkham where he exacts his revenge on Ivy for her deception and treachery.

Mr. Freeze is a member of the Pact, alongside [[Joker (character)|\"John Doe\"]], [[Riddler]], [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], and [[Harley Quinn]]. He joins the group to retrieve the LOTUS virus, hoping to use it to cure Nora. However, during the raid at the lab where it is kept, he is betrayed by Quinn and infected with the virus. In return for information about her whereabouts, Freeze asks Bruce Wayne/Batman to lower his confinement's temperature, hoping to combat his infection. Regardless of the decision, his fate is left ambiguous.\n\n====Lego====\n* Mr. Freeze appears ''[[Lego Batman: The Video Game]]'', with his vocal effects provided by [[Ogie Banks]]. He appears as an enemy of [[Batman]], a follower of the [[Riddler]]<ref>''Game Informer'' features a two-page gallery of the many heroes and villains who appear in the game with a picture for each character and a descriptive paragraph. See \"''LEGO Batman'': Character Gallery\", ''Game Informer'' 186 (October 2008): 93.</ref> and the second boss of Chapter 1 \"The Riddler's Revenge\". In it his design is based mainly on the animated series and he uses his freeze gun to freeze enemies and water. The strength granted to him by his suit allows him to pick up objects others cannot. His suit also protects him from toxins. The Riddler assigns him to get a freeze cannon in his old factory. It is shown in the story that, while he aids the Riddler in his pursuit for Gotham City's gold reserves, he is shown to be formulating plans of his own, which involve raising an army of Freeze Maids, which he uses in his boss fight. The player has to be quick and attack him right after he shuts down his freeze gun. After he is defeated, he attempts to run away, but Batman throws a Batarang at him, causing his pack to backfire and make him bounce across the room and then land on the floor in front of Batman and [[Robin (character)|Robin]]. In the ending cutscene, he is seen in [[Arkham Asylum]] playing with dolls of him and a Freeze Maid.\n* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Townsend Coleman]]. He appears as a cameo in the fourth level \"Asylum Assignment\", where he is seen in a cell constantly tapping on the glass. In Free-play mode, the player can actually kill him once s/he sends one of the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin's]] bombs inside and attacks him. Outside of the story, he appears as a boss fight and an unlockable character found at the observatory. His intro catchphrase is, \"Is it just me, or is it really cold in here?\"\n* Mr. Freeze appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'', voiced by [[Liam O'Brien]] doing a terrible [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] impression. He first appears as a boss in the story, on which the player helps [[Plastic Man]] defeat him in the Watchtower so that they can proceed to defeat [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]. The player as Batman in his Sensor-suit must attack Mr. Freeze while the character is in stealth mode. Mr. Freeze is later found in [[Qward]] in a side-quest where he requests the player to find another fuel cell for his freezer after the other was damaged by [[Killer Moth]]. The ''Batman Beyond'' version of Mr. Freeze is also playable via downloadable content.\n* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', voiced again by [[Eric Bauza]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicsbeat.com/sdcc18-lego-dc-super-villains-cast-and-devs-dish-on-funever-evil/ | title=Syndicated Comics| date=2018-07-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://mailchi.mp/mi5communications/lego-dc-super-villains-reveals-darkseids-villainy-in-action-in-new-clip-890165?e=49aaf48973 | title=Lego\u00ae DC Super-Villains Reveals Darkseid's Villainy in Action in New Clip}}</ref>\n\n====''Batman: Arkham''====\n* Mr. Freeze appears in the ''Batman Arkham'' series where he is voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]].\n** In ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'', Mr. Freeze's frost and icicle covered cell can be seen in the Penitentiary area which can be scanned to unlock his bio. According to the game's writer [[Paul Dini]], Freeze was originally planned to be featured in the game, but his inclusion was dropped as he did not fit as part of the game.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/6126146/Batman-Arkham-Asylum-interview-with-Paul-Dini.html | title=Batman: Arkham Asylum interview with Paul Dini| date=2009-09-02| last1=Cowen| first1=Nick}}</ref>\n** In ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', he appears as both an ally to Batman and a [[boss battle]]. After the Joker poisons Batman, the Dark Knight has to find Mr. Freeze. Batman searches for him in the GCPD building (literally the coldest place in Arkham City), only to find his lab swarmed by the Penguin's men, who reveal that Penguin is holding Mr. Freeze hostage in the Cyrus Pinkney National History Institute. It is revealed that Penguin stole Mr. Freeze's gun and is holding GCPD officers hostage. Batman saves the hostages and Mr. Freeze from Penguin's men in the museum and asks Mr. Freeze for the cure to his ailment, only for Mr. Freeze to reveal he needs his suit, which Penguin possesses. He tells Batman that his suit has a disruptor that can be used to turn off his freeze gun so that he can defeat Penguin. After Penguin is apprehended and Mr. Freeze recovers his suit, he gets revenge by locking Penguin in a display case. Mr. Freeze then tells Batman that the cure he made for Joker degenerates too quickly and needs a restorative enzyme that has been bonded to human DNA, something that would take decades, only for Batman to reveal he knows [[Ra's al Ghul|someone]] who has been exposed to that enzyme for centuries. Mr. Freeze tells Batman he only needs a sample of this person's DNA to complete the cure and Batman proceeds to track down one of the warriors of the [[League of Assassins]] Penguin had captured. When Batman returns to the GCPD with the blood sample, Mr. Freeze creates two vials of the cure before locking one in a safe and destroying the other, demanding Batman save [[Nora Fries]] from Joker. Batman fights Mr. Freeze to unlock the safe, which proves difficult as Mr. Freeze is much too powerful to be confronted directly. Batman is forced to hide and find ways to stun Mr. Freeze, such as using grates in the floor to surprise him as he passes by. Each time Mr. Freeze is incapacitated, he counteracts his weaknesses. After he is beaten, Batman opens the safe only to find that the wall behind the safe was broken into and in the place of the cure there is only a note saying: \"Get well soon!\" and some joker cards. Batman realizes that [[Harley Quinn]] had stolen the cure while the Dark Knight was distracted fighting Mr. Freeze. Mr. Freeze gives Batman freeze grenades to help him retrieve the cure and begs him to find Nora, which becomes a side mission in the game. After Nora is saved, Batman finds Mr. Freeze with his wife and tells him to end his life of crime for Nora's sake. Mr. Freeze's boss battle was widely praised as a step up from the repetitive titan thug bosses from the previous game.\n** In ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', his origin and first encounter with Batman is featured in the DLC story \"Cold, Cold Heart\" which is based on the ''Batman: The Animated Series'' episode \"Heart of Ice\". Mr. Freeze also has a new design for the downloadable content (DLC), featuring cleated boots and a larger freeze gun built into the right arm of his suit. In the DLC, Mr. Freeze is in collaboration with the Penguin's gang in order to crash a party at Wayne Manor in order to capture Ferris Boyle. When Batman arrives at GothCorp, he finds Penguin trying to force Mr. Freeze to give him what Freeze is after (thinking it to be weapons) until Mr. Freeze uses his freeze gun to create a chain reaction that traps Penguin in a wall of ice. Upon getting the X-E suit to withstand the cold and acquiring a cryogenic drill to penetrate the ice wall, Batman finds residual evidence that Boyle was behind the accident that turned Victor Fries into Mr. Freeze and that Boyle is in possession of Mr. Freeze's cryogenically frozen wife. Batman later confronts and defeats Mr. Freeze. Boyle then takes a piece of machinery and attacks Mr. Freeze, only for Batman to knock out Boyle. During the DLC's credits, a news voiceover states that Mr. Freeze, Penguin, and Boyle have been all arrested by the police.\n** Mr. Freeze is featured in ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]''. Mr. Freeze's freeze gun can be found in the evidence room at the [[Gotham City Police Department]]. According to Aaron Cash, Mr. Freeze has not been seen or heard since ''Arkham City'' and implies that he possibly gave up his criminal life to continue his work on finding a cure for Nora Fries. There was also a mentioning that the freeze gun was used by some members of the Gotham City Police Department to make ice cream until it was confiscated from them by James Gordon. Mr. Freeze appears in the December \"Season of Infamy\" downloadable content (DLC) pack in the side mission \"In From The Cold\". Batman discovers a frozen vessel just off the coast of Gotham and investigates, finding Mr. Freeze at his wife's old cryogenic chamber. He says that the Arkham Knight's Militia took Nora after he refused to help Scarecrow and Arkham Knight with their plans to take down Batman. Freeze entrusts Batman to rescue his wife from the soldiers. After fighting through a barrage of Militia henchmen, Batman finds Nora and breaks her out of her damaged cryo-chamber. Much to both Batman and Freeze's surprise, she no longer wants to be frozen in ice and simply wants to spend time with Victor. It is also revealed that she could hear every word he said, despite being in suspended animation. After taking down a Militia force trying to destroy Fries' vessel, Nora and Victor meet face-to-face and Victor removes his protective helmet. As they look off at Gotham, Nora asks how long they will live, to which Victor replies \"merely days\". They then depart Gotham City; when Batman analyses Freeze's equipment in the GCPD lockup, a recording made by Cash ponders whether this turn of events is a happy or sad outcome for the Frieses.\n** Mr. Freeze appears as a playable character in the mobile game ''Batman: Arkham Underworld''. He is unlocked after the player completes a mission for him, after which he becomes playable, wielding his freeze gun with different firing modes.\n\n===Web series===\n* In the third season of the [[Flash animation|Flash]] series ''[[Gotham Girls]]'', a new villain is introduced: '''Dora Smithy''' (voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]), Mr. Freeze's sister-in-law. She blames Freeze for Nora's death and dons his freezing equipment in a quest for revenge. As a result, there is an emphasis on Mr. Freeze himself throughout the season, and he is discussed several times, although he never actually makes an appearance.\n* In the ''[[Batman Unlimited]]'' shorts, Mr. Freeze appears on a rampage in a giant robot suit. Batman manages to destroy the suit and Freeze ejects. Freeze then attacks Batman, only for Batman to shatter his helmet. Batman puts a gas mask on him and handcuffs him, comforting Mr. Freeze until the cops arrive.\n* In ''[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]'', Mr.Freeze (voiced by [[Alfred Molina]]) is first mentioned in season 1, then makes his full appearance in the season 2 premiere, \"New Gotham\", as a member of the [[Injustice League]]. Following the Joker destroying Gotham in the season one finale, Mr. Freeze joined forces with Bane, Riddler, Penguin, and Two-Face to form the Injustice League and seize control. When Harley interferes with their plans, they attempt to make peace with her, but she refuses. In response, Freeze has her frozen and put on display in Penguin's Iceberg Lounge. Over the course of two months, Freeze and his allies divided Gotham's ruins between them and dubbed it New Gotham.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n* Mr. Freeze appears in the direct-to-video original animation ''[[DC Super Friends]]: The Joker's Playhouse'' (2010), voiced by [[Eric Bauza]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Batman Family adversaries]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Batman (comics)#Mr. Freeze|Mr. Freeze}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080512015349/http://batman.ugo.com/roguesgallery/mrfreeze/default.asp Mr. Freeze UGO profile]\n*{{gcdb|type=character|search=Mr.+Freeze|title=Mr. Freeze}}\n*{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=1584|title=Mr. Freeze}}\n*{{DCdatabase|Mister Freeze}}\n\n{{Batman characters}}\n{{Batgirl}}\n{{Outsiders (comics)}}\n{{Robin}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Freeze, Mr.}}\n[[Category:DC Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Batman characters]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Bob Kane]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1959]]\n[[Category:DC Comics metahumans]]\n[[Category:Fictional assassins]]\n[[Category:DC Comics television characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with ice or cold abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with slowed aging]]\n[[Category:Fictional chemical engineers]]\n[[Category:Fictional cryonically preserved characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Fictional cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Fictional inventors]]\n[[Category:Fictional life scientists]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional matricides]]\n[[Category:Fictional physicians]]\n[[Category:Superhero film characters]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Male characters in film]]\n[[Category:Male film villains]]\n[[Category:Action film villains]]\n", "name_user": "Blazewing16", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eWeb series", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Freeze"}
