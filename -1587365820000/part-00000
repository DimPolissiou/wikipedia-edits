Within her mind's Headquarters, five personifications of her basic emotions\u2014Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger\u2014come to life and influence her ways of doing things via a control console. As she grows up, her experiences become memories, stored in colored orbs, which are sent into long-term memory each night. Her five most important \"core memories\" are housed in a hub; each powers an aspect of her personality which takes the form of floating islands. Joy acts as a ''de facto'' leader, and since she and the other emotions do not understand Sadness's purpose, she tries to keep Sadness away from the console.\n\nAt the age of 11, Riley moves with her parents to San Francisco for her father's new job. Riley's first experiences are not good; the new house is cramped and old, the local pizza parlour only serves broccoli as a topping, her father is under stress from his job, and due to a mix-up the moving van with their belongings gets lost and won't arrive for weeks. When Sadness begins touching Riley's happy memories, turning them sad, Joy tries to guard them by isolating her. On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness causes Riley to cry in front of her class, creating Riley's first sad core memory. Joy tries to dispose of it but accidentally knocks the other core memories loose during a struggle with Sadness, deactivating the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are sucked out of Headquarters and sent to long-term memory storage.\n\nIn Joy's absence, Anger, Fear, and Disgust are left in control, with disastrous results, distancing Riley from her parents, friends, and hobbies. As a result, her personality islands gradually crumble and fall into the \"Memory Dump\", where memories are forgotten. Finally, Anger inserts an idea into the console, prompting Riley to run away to Minnesota, believing it will restore her happiness.\n\nWhile navigating through the vast maze-like long-term memory area, Joy and Sadness encounter Bing Bong, Riley's childhood imaginary friend, who suggests riding the \"train of thought\" back to Headquarters. Their route to the train station is fraught with close calls and mishaps as more personality islands crumble. The three eventually catch the train, but it halts when Riley falls asleep, then derails entirely when \"Honesty Island\" collapses with Riley's theft of her mother's credit card. In desperation, Joy abandons Sadness and tries to ride a \"recall tube\" back to Headquarters, but the ground below the tube collapses, breaking it and plunging Joy and Bing Bong into the Memory Dump.\n\nJoy begins to lose hope and breaks into tears, but then discovers a sad memory that turned happy when Riley's parents and friends comforted her. Joy finally understands Sadness's purpose: to induce empathy in others, prompting them to reach out to Riley when she is emotionally overwhelmed and needs help. By preventing Riley from feeling sad, Joy was also keeping her from feeling happiness. Joy and Bing Bong try to use Bing Bong's old wagon rocket to escape the Memory Dump but are unable to fly high enough, as the wagon is too heavy with both of them in it. On their final attempt, Bing Bong jumps out to allow Joy to escape, then fades away.\n\nJoy reunites with Sadness and manages to return to Headquarters, only to discover that Anger's idea has disabled the console, rendering Riley apathetic. To the surprise of the others, Joy hands control of the console to Sadness, who is able to reactivate it, and so make Riley sad that she is leaving her parents, and prompt Riley to return to her new home. As Sadness reinstalls the core memories, Riley arrives home to her parents and tearfully confesses that she misses Minnesota and her old life. Her parents comfort her and admit they also miss Minnesota. Joy and Sadness work the console together, creating a new core memory; a new island forms, representing Riley's acceptance of her new life in San Francisco.\n\nA year later, Riley has adapted to her new home, made new friends, and returned to her old hobbies while acquiring a few new ones. Inside Headquarters, her emotions admire Riley's new personality islands, and all work together on a newly expanded console with room for them all.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Cannes 2015

The idea to depict it through animation excited Docter, who felt it the ideal form to portray \"strong, opinionated, caricatured personalities\".<ref name=\"npr\"/> He began researching information about the mind, alongside Jonas Rivera, a producer, and Ronnie del Carmen, a secondary director. They consulted [[Paul Ekman]], a well-known psychologist who studies emotions, and [[Dacher Keltner]], a professor of psychology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Ekman had early in his career identified six core emotions\u2014anger, fear, sadness, disgust, joy, and [[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]]. Docter found surprise and fear to be too similar, which left him with five emotions to build characters around.<ref name=\"npr\"/> Other emotions considered for inclusion during the development process were [[schadenfreude]], [[boredom|ennui]], pride, and hope.<ref name=\"McKittrick\">{{cite web|url=http://creativescreenwriting.com/is-this-the-best-story-we-can-tell-inside-out/|title=\"Is this the best story we can tell?\" \u2013 Inside Out|last=McKittrick|first=Christopher|date=February 16, 2016|work=Creative Screenwriting|accessdate=February 16, 2016}}</ref> Keltner focused on sadness being an emotion that strengthens relationships.<ref name=\"npr\"/> Both emphasized how emotions organize social lives and the structuring of interpersonal interactions.<ref name=science/>\n\nThe smash success of Docter's 2009 film [[Up (2009 film)|''Up'']] encouraged those at Pixar to allow Docter to create another film with a more sophisticated story.<ref name=\"nyt\"/> ''Inside Out'' is the first Pixar film without input from co-founder and former [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] CEO [[Steve Jobs]], who died in 2011. In addition, the film did not have as much input from chief creative officer [[John Lasseter]], who was focused on restructuring [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] at the time of its production.<ref name=\"nyt\"/> Executives at Disney and Pixar were positive at the proposal of making ''Inside Out'', but acknowledged it would be difficult to market.<ref name=\"lat\"/>\n\n===Story===\nDocter recruited a story crew to help develop the film's plot line. Although animation as an industry had been dominated by men, half of the story crew were women, in an attempt to have more diverse input. The choice to focus the film on a girl came from research that claimed that females age 11 to 17 are more attuned to expressions and emotions than others. The idea to have Riley play hockey came from Del Carmen, who observed that the sport is very popular in Minnesota. Initial ideas for the film found the main character, Riley, falling into a deep depression: Docter later felt they were inappropriate and scrapped them, although in the final film Riley does sink into a depression.<ref name=\"nyt\"/>\n\nThe film was first storyboarded over a period of two to three years, all the while undergoing screenings for Pixar's \"Brain Trust\", a small group of creative leaders at Pixar who oversee development on all films. After multiple screenings and suggestions from other filmmakers, the picture was put into production. It was again evaluated three months into that process. Kevin Nolting, editor of the film, estimated there were seven versions of ''Inside Out'' created before it even went into production.<ref name=\"hr\"/> The story team attempted to create as much contrast with characters as possible.<ref name=\"iw\"/> They found Joy the most complex character to write for, as she illustrates a broad range of \"happy feelings\".<ref name=\"vul\"/> The earliest idea present in the final film is that Joy holds onto youth too long, setting about a \"social storm\" for Riley.<ref name=\"mf\"/> It was not until several screenings later that they came upon the concept of moving to a new place, which created an external conflict that made the story easier to write. Initially, this crisis was to be set at a [[Thanksgiving Day]] pageant, in which Riley was hoping to be cast as its lead role, the turkey. Docter later deemed this idea too \"bizarre\" and it was replaced.<ref name=\"sf\"/>\n\nDocter estimated it took four years of development for the film to achieve success in marrying the architecture of Riley's mind and her personal troubles. The concept of \"personality islands\" helped develop the film's emotional stakes, as they directly affect events inside her mind and in her life. In one draft, the characters fell into \"Idea Fields\", where they would \"cultivate new ideas\", much like a farmer would cultivate crop.<ref name=\"sf\"/> The character of Bing Bong\u2014a discarded old imaginary friend\u2014came about in one draft of the film as part of a refugee camp inside Riley's mind. It was difficult to achieve the correct tone for the film; for example, viewers could not be distracted by Joy's nature or feel negative about the mess she helps steer Riley into. Rivera credited the casting of Amy Poehler, in addition to the idea of moving, with helping the film find the right tone.<ref name=\"mf\">{{cite news|url=http://news.moviefone.com/2015/06/19/inside-out-producer-jonas-rivera-alternate-versions/|date=June 19, 2015|title='Inside Out' Producer Jonas Rivera Reveals Versions of the Movie You'll Never See|author=Drew Taylor|work=MovieFone|accessdate=June 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621015859/http://news.moviefone.com/2015/06/19/inside-out-producer-jonas-rivera-alternate-versions/|archive-date=June 21, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nAn early version of the film focused on Joy and Fear getting lost together, as it seemed to be the most humorous choice. By July 2012, the project was set for an evaluation screening with other Pixar filmmakers. Docter gradually began to feel that the story was not working, which made him think that he might get fired. He took a long walk one Sunday, where he began to consider himself a failure, and that he should resign from the film.<ref name=\"npr\">{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/06/10/413273007/its-all-in-your-head-director-pete-docter-gets-emotional-in-inside-out|title=It's All in Your Head: Director Pete Docter Gets Emotional In 'Inside Out'|author=Terry Gross|work=[[Fresh Air]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=June 10, 2015|accessdate=June 16, 2015}}</ref> While pondering what he would miss about Pixar, he concluded that he would miss his coworkers and friends most of all.

Within her mind's Headquarters, five personifications of her basic emotions\u2014Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger\u2014come to life and influence her ways of doing things via a control console. As she grows up, her experiences become memories, stored in colored orbs, which are sent into long-term memory each night. Her five most important \"core memories\" are housed in a hub; each powers an aspect of her personality which takes the form of floating islands. Joy acts as a ''de facto'' leader, and since she and the other emotions do not understand Sadness's purpose, she tries to keep Sadness away from the console.\n\nAt the age of 11, Riley moves with her parents to San Francisco for her father's new job. Riley's first experiences are not good; the new house is cramped and old, the local pizza parlour only serves broccoli as a topping, her father is under stress from his job, and due to a mix-up the moving van with their belongings gets lost and won't arrive for weeks. When Sadness begins touching Riley's happy memories, turning them sad, Joy tries to guard them by isolating her. On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness causes Riley to cry in front of her class, creating Riley's first sad core memory. Joy tries to dispose of it but accidentally knocks the other core memories loose during a struggle with Sadness, deactivating the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are sucked out of Headquarters and sent to long-term memory storage.\n\nIn Joy's absence, Anger, Fear, and Disgust are left in control, with disastrous results, distancing Riley from her parents, friends, and hobbies. As a result, her personality islands gradually crumble and fall into the \"Memory Dump\", where memories are forgotten. Finally, Anger inserts an idea into the console, prompting Riley to run away to Minnesota, believing it will restore her happiness.\n\nWhile navigating through the vast maze-like long-term memory area, Joy and Sadness encounter Bing Bong, Riley's childhood imaginary friend, who suggests riding the \"train of thought\" back to Headquarters. Their route to the train station is fraught with close calls and mishaps as more personality islands crumble. The three eventually catch the train, but it halts when Riley falls asleep, then derails entirely when \"Honesty Island\" collapses with Riley's theft of her mother's credit card. In desperation, Joy abandons Sadness and tries to ride a \"recall tube\" back to Headquarters, but the ground below the tube collapses, breaking it and plunging Joy and Bing Bong into the Memory Dump.\n\nJoy begins to lose hope and breaks into tears, but then discovers a sad memory that turned happy when Riley's parents and friends comforted her. Joy finally understands Sadness's purpose: to induce empathy in others, prompting them to reach out to Riley when she is emotionally overwhelmed and needs help. By preventing Riley from feeling sad, Joy was also keeping her from feeling happiness. Joy and Bing Bong try to use Bing Bong's old wagon rocket to escape the Memory Dump but are unable to fly high enough, as the wagon is too heavy with both of them in it. On their final attempt, Bing Bong jumps out to allow Joy to escape, then fades away.\n\nJoy reunites with Sadness and manages to return to Headquarters, only to discover that Anger's idea has disabled the console, rendering Riley apathetic. To the surprise of the others, Joy hands control of the console to Sadness, who is able to reactivate it, and so make Riley sad that she is leaving her parents, and prompt Riley to return to her new home. As Sadness reinstalls the core memories, Riley arrives home to her parents and tearfully confesses that she misses Minnesota and her old life. Her parents comfort her and admit they also miss Minnesota. Joy and Sadness work the console together, creating a new core memory; a new island forms, representing Riley's acceptance of her new life in San Francisco.\n\nA year later, Riley has adapted to her new home, made new friends, and returned to her old hobbies while acquiring a few new ones. Inside Headquarters, her emotions admire Riley's new personality islands, and all work together on a newly expanded console with room for them all.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Cannes 2015

The idea to depict it through animation excited Docter, who felt it the ideal form to portray \"strong, opinionated, caricatured personalities\".<ref name=\"npr\"/> He began researching information about the mind, alongside Jonas Rivera, a producer, and Ronnie del Carmen, a secondary director. They consulted [[Paul Ekman]], a well-known psychologist who studies emotions, and [[Dacher Keltner]], a professor of psychology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Ekman had early in his career identified six core emotions\u2014anger, fear, sadness, disgust, joy, and [[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]]. Docter found surprise and fear to be too similar, which left him with five emotions to build characters around.<ref name=\"npr\"/> Other emotions considered for inclusion during the development process were [[schadenfreude]], [[boredom|ennui]], pride, and hope.<ref name=\"McKittrick\">{{cite web|url=http://creativescreenwriting.com/is-this-the-best-story-we-can-tell-inside-out/|title=\"Is this the best story we can tell?\" \u2013 Inside Out|last=McKittrick|first=Christopher|date=February 16, 2016|work=Creative Screenwriting|accessdate=February 16, 2016}}</ref> Keltner focused on sadness being an emotion that strengthens relationships.<ref name=\"npr\"/> Both emphasized how emotions organize social lives and the structuring of interpersonal interactions.<ref name=science/>\n\nThe smash success of Docter's 2009 film [[Up (2009 film)|''Up'']] encouraged those at Pixar to allow Docter to create another film with a more sophisticated story.<ref name=\"nyt\"/> ''Inside Out'' is the first Pixar film without input from co-founder and former [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] CEO [[Steve Jobs]], who died in 2011. In addition, the film did not have as much input from chief creative officer [[John Lasseter]], who was focused on restructuring [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] at the time of its production.<ref name=\"nyt\"/> Executives at Disney and Pixar were positive at the proposal of making ''Inside Out'', but acknowledged it would be difficult to market.<ref name=\"lat\"/>\n\n===Story===\nDocter recruited a story crew to help develop the film's plot line. Although animation as an industry had been dominated by men, half of the story crew were women, in an attempt to have more diverse input. The choice to focus the film on a girl came from research that claimed that females age 11 to 17 are more attuned to expressions and emotions than others. The idea to have Riley play hockey came from Del Carmen, who observed that the sport is very popular in Minnesota. Initial ideas for the film found the main character, Riley, falling into a deep depression: Docter later felt they were inappropriate and scrapped them, although in the final film Riley does sink into a depression.<ref name=\"nyt\"/>\n\nThe film was first storyboarded over a period of two to three years, all the while undergoing screenings for Pixar's \"Brain Trust\", a small group of creative leaders at Pixar who oversee development on all films. After multiple screenings and suggestions from other filmmakers, the picture was put into production. It was again evaluated three months into that process. Kevin Nolting, editor of the film, estimated there were seven versions of ''Inside Out'' created before it even went into production.<ref name=\"hr\"/> The story team attempted to create as much contrast with characters as possible.<ref name=\"iw\"/> They found Joy the most complex character to write for, as she illustrates a broad range of \"happy feelings\".<ref name=\"vul\"/> The earliest idea present in the final film is that Joy holds onto youth too long, setting about a \"social storm\" for Riley.<ref name=\"mf\"/> It was not until several screenings later that they came upon the concept of moving to a new place, which created an external conflict that made the story easier to write. Initially, this crisis was to be set at a [[Thanksgiving Day]] pageant, in which Riley was hoping to be cast as its lead role, the turkey. Docter later deemed this idea too \"bizarre\" and it was replaced.<ref name=\"sf\"/>\n\nDocter estimated it took four years of development for the film to achieve success in marrying the architecture of Riley's mind and her personal troubles. The concept of \"personality islands\" helped develop the film's emotional stakes, as they directly affect events inside her mind and in her life. In one draft, the characters fell into \"Idea Fields\", where they would \"cultivate new ideas\", much like a farmer would cultivate crop.<ref name=\"sf\"/> The character of Bing Bong\u2014a discarded old imaginary friend\u2014came about in one draft of the film as part of a refugee camp inside Riley's mind. It was difficult to achieve the correct tone for the film; for example, viewers could not be distracted by Joy's nature or feel negative about the mess she helps steer Riley into. Rivera credited the casting of Amy Poehler, in addition to the idea of moving, with helping the film find the right tone.<ref name=\"mf\">{{cite news|url=http://news.moviefone.com/2015/06/19/inside-out-producer-jonas-rivera-alternate-versions/|date=June 19, 2015|title='Inside Out' Producer Jonas Rivera Reveals Versions of the Movie You'll Never See|author=Drew Taylor|work=MovieFone|accessdate=June 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621015859/http://news.moviefone.com/2015/06/19/inside-out-producer-jonas-rivera-alternate-versions/|archive-date=June 21, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nAn early version of the film focused on Joy and Fear getting lost together, as it seemed to be the most humorous choice. By July 2012, the project was set for an evaluation screening with other Pixar filmmakers. Docter gradually began to feel that the story was not working, which made him think that he might get fired. He took a long walk one Sunday, where he began to consider himself a failure, and that he should resign from the film.<ref name=\"npr\">{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/06/10/413273007/its-all-in-your-head-director-pete-docter-gets-emotional-in-inside-out|title=It's All in Your Head: Director Pete Docter Gets Emotional In 'Inside Out'|author=Terry Gross|work=[[Fresh Air]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=June 10, 2015|accessdate=June 16, 2015}}</ref> While pondering what he would miss about Pixar, he concluded that he would miss his coworkers and friends most of all.

The discussions were held between 2006 and 2009, and Daniels argued that they carried an implied contract for her to be compensated if the ideas were used by Disney. On January 31, 2018, her suit was dismissed by judge [[Philip Gutierrez]], who ruled that since Daniels had released materials related to the project publicly at the time of the conversations, there were no grounds for an implied contract between Disney and Daniels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/law/inside-infringement-case-dismissed-u-s-court-156407.html|title='Inside Out' Infringement Case Dismissed In U.S. Court|author=|date=February 6, 2018|publisher=[[Cartoon Brew]]|accessdate=August 28, 2018}}</ref> Daniels appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]], who upheld the District Court's ruling in March 2020 that Pixar's film did not infringe on Daniels' characters.

The competition is run under the auspices of the [[New South Wales Country Rugby League|Country Rugby League]] and players are eligible for selection in the [[Canberra]] Division of the CRL Tier 1 Divisional Championships. The Canberra district competition has an under 19s, reserve and first grade competitions.\n\n==History==\nAfter the establishment of Rugby League in Sydney in 1909, the game slowly made its way south, reaching the Canberra District in the late 1910s. During those years and into the 1920s and 30s Challenge Cup football was the most popular form of competition, with a cup being donated as a prize for a game between 2 teams. The winning team would then have to defend the cup against all challengers. The most notable Challenge Cups in the Canberra region at the time were the Massey and Carr Cups which began in 1930 and 1933 respectively.\n\nThe first organised round robin competition was run in 1928 by Federal Capital Territory and District Rugby League. The winners of inaugural competition were the Acton Rovers and the next four years saw four different winners. The competition ran through until 1937 when interest in League began to dwindle.\n\nThe Group 8 Premiership began in 1932 and was strong enough to continue while interest in the game waned. Teams from Canberra, Yass, Queanbeyan and Goulburn competed for the title of premiers up until 1941, when all League competitions in the region were suspended due to the war. Competition resumed in 1946, with the Massey and Carr Cups only lasting the one season before being retired, while the Group 8 Premiership continued on strongly and was duly supported by ACT District Rugby League who ran a second division competition.\n\nSome of the teams to compete during this period included Captains Flat, Crookwell, Braidwood, Goulburn Workers, Goulburn United, Queanbeyan and Yass in the Group 8 Competition while in the ACTDRL Second Division competition there were teams such as Ainslie, Causeway, Eastlake, Hall, R.A.A.F, R.M.C, South City and West City.\n\nIt was through the Second Division competition that the Molonglo Shield was established, first being played for in 1964 with Harman/NAVY taking out the inaugural title over the Canberra Rovers.\n\nIn 1967 Group 8 joined with part of Group 9 to form Group 8/9 or Zone 2. This was due to a CRL boundaries dispute in the Riverina, and saw Harden, Young and Wyangala Dam join the district competition. The Zone 2 format lasted until 1970 when CRL returned the boundaries in the Riverina to their original positions and Group 8 was restored.\n\nIn 1974 CRL officially recognised the Molonglo Shield as its own competition and gave it a Group number, Group 19. It was at this point in time that both Group 8 and Group 19 were strong enough to run first and second division competitions. The first division clubs ran firsts, reserves and Under 18's while the second division sides ran just one team.\n\nGroup 8 First Division consisted mainly of the teams which play Canberra Raiders Cup today, with the addition of Crookwell and Goulburn United. Group 8 Second Division was primarily for towns from around the Goulburn District including Taralga, Marulan, Bigga and Argyle. Braidwood also fielded a side in the competition.\n\nGroup 19 First Division comprised teams from around Canberra including Kambah, South Woden, Belconnen United and North Canberra. Batemans Bay also competed in Group 19 until 1977. Second Division was much like George Tooke Shield is today, with teams from Harman, Bungendore, Weston Creek and Captains Flat all competing for the title.\n\nIn 1980 Group 19 changed its name to ACTRL while in 1981 Group 8 changed to CDRL. In 1982 CDRL was granted entry into the NSWRL as the Canberra Raiders so the ACTRL took over the running of senior league in the district, combining the two groups to form 3 new competitions. The premier division still played for the Molonglo Shield, while the second division competition was split into North and South according to location within the District. In 1986 the two second division competitions were merged to form the Canberra Cup, which ran through until 1998.\n\nIn the meantime, a move by regional towns saw the establishment of the George Tooke Shield in 1995, which was aimed at clubs that wished to field firsts and under 18s but were not competitive enough for Molonglo Shield. In its first year 5 teams competed: East Canberra, Braidwood, Yass, Crookwell and Goulburn Exchange. While the Under 18s side of the competition only lasted 2 years, the George Tooke Shield has continued to expand, 9 clubs now competing for the title.\n\nIn 1998, after 35 years, the Molonglo Shield was retired and the Canberra Raiders Cup became the prize the first grade clubs fought for over a season. It is still that way today and the Shield still has its place in the game, awarded to the First Grade Minor Premiers.\n\n==Clubs==\n\n=== Current Senior Clubs ===\n\n==== First Grade Clubs ====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\"\n!

surrounding [[New South Wales]] towns [[Queanbeyan]], [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]] and [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]]. The competition is run under the auspices of the [[New South Wales Country Rugby League|Country Rugby League]] and players are eligible for selection in the [[Canberra]] Division of the CRL Tier 1 Divisional Championships. The Canberra district competition has an under 19s, reserve and first grade competitions.\n\n==History==\nAfter the establishment of Rugby League in Sydney in 1909, the game slowly made its way south, reaching the Canberra District in the late 1910s. During those years and into the 1920s and 30s Challenge Cup football was the most popular form of competition, with a cup being donated as a prize for a game between 2 teams. The winning team would then have to defend the cup against all challengers. The most notable Challenge Cups in the Canberra region at the time were the Massey and Carr Cups which began in 1930 and 1933 respectively.\n\nThe first organised round robin competition was run in 1928 by Federal Capital Territory and District Rugby League. The winners of inaugural competition were the Acton Rovers and the next four years saw four different winners. The competition ran through until 1937 when interest in League began to dwindle.\n\nThe Group 8 Premiership began in 1932 and was strong enough to continue while interest in the game waned. Teams from Canberra, Yass, Queanbeyan and Goulburn competed for the title of premiers up until 1941, when all League competitions in the region were suspended due to the war. Competition resumed in 1946, with the Massey and Carr Cups only lasting the one season before being retired, while the Group 8 Premiership continued on strongly and was duly supported by ACT District Rugby League who ran a second division competition.\n\nSome of the teams to compete during this period included Captains Flat, Crookwell, Braidwood, Goulburn Workers, Goulburn United, Queanbeyan and Yass in the Group 8 Competition while in the ACTDRL Second Division competition there were teams such as Ainslie, Causeway, Eastlake, Hall, R.A.A.F, R.M.C, South City and West City.\n\nIt was through the Second Division competition that the Molonglo Shield was established, first being played for in 1964 with Harman/NAVY taking out the inaugural title over the Canberra Rovers.\n\nIn 1967 Group 8 joined with part of Group 9 to form Group 8/9 or Zone 2. This was due to a CRL boundaries dispute in the Riverina, and saw Harden, Young and Wyangala Dam join the district competition. The Zone 2 format lasted until 1970 when CRL returned the boundaries in the Riverina to their original positions and Group 8 was restored.\n\nIn 1974 CRL officially recognised the Molonglo Shield as its own competition and gave it a Group number, Group 19. It was at this point in time that both Group 8 and Group 19 were strong enough to run first and second division competitions. The first division clubs ran firsts, reserves and Under 18's while the second division sides ran just one team.\n\nGroup 8 First Division consisted mainly of the teams which play Canberra Raiders Cup today, with the addition of Crookwell and Goulburn United. Group 8 Second Division was primarily for towns from around the Goulburn District including Taralga, Marulan, Bigga and Argyle. Braidwood also fielded a side in the competition.\n\nGroup 19 First Division comprised teams from around Canberra including Kambah, South Woden, Belconnen United and North Canberra. Batemans Bay also competed in Group 19 until 1977. Second Division was much like George Tooke Shield is today, with teams from Harman, Bungendore, Weston Creek and Captains Flat all competing for the title.\n\nIn 1980 Group 19 changed its name to ACTRL while in 1981 Group 8 changed to CDRL. In 1982 CDRL was granted entry into the NSWRL as the Canberra Raiders so the ACTRL took over the running of senior league in the district, combining the two groups to form 3 new competitions. The premier division still played for the Molonglo Shield, while the second division competition was split into North and South according to location within the District. In 1986 the two second division competitions were merged to form the Canberra Cup, which ran through until 1998.\n\nIn the meantime, a move by regional towns saw the establishment of the George Tooke Shield in 1995, which was aimed at clubs that wished to field firsts and under 18s but were not competitive enough for Molonglo Shield. In its first year 5 teams competed: East Canberra, Braidwood, Yass, Crookwell and Goulburn Exchange. While the Under 18s side of the competition only lasted 2 years, the George Tooke Shield has continued to expand, 9 clubs now competing for the title.\n\nIn 1998, after 35 years, the Molonglo Shield was retired and the Canberra Raiders Cup became the prize the first grade clubs fought for over a season. It is still that way today and the Shield still has its place in the game, awarded to the First Grade Minor Premiers.\n\n==Clubs==\n\n=== Current Senior Clubs ===\n\n==== First Grade Clubs ====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\"\n!

Since 26 January 2011, the office has been held by [[Miche\u00e1l Martin]], following the resignation of [[Taoiseach]] [[Brian Cowen]] as leader of the party.\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|History of Fianna F\u00e1il}}\nThe post of Leader of Fianna F\u00e1il was officially created in 1926 when [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] founded the party. De Valera had previously been leader of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] and took the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Anti-Treaty]] side during the [[Irish Civil War|Civil War]]. The new party essentially became a home for dissatisfied Sinn F\u00e9in [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TDs]] who had become disillusioned with the party's abstentionist policy from [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] and wanted to republicanise the [[Irish Free State]] from within.\n\nLike other Irish political parties, most notably [[Fine Gael]], the Leader of Fianna F\u00e1il has the power to dismiss or appoint their Deputy and to dismiss or appoint parliamentary party members to front bench positions.\n\nWhen Fianna F\u00e1il is in opposition the leader usually acts as the [[Leader of the Opposition (Ireland)|Leader of the Opposition]], and chairs the opposition front bench. Concordantly, when the party is in government, the leader would usually become [[Taoiseach]], as well as appointing the [[Government of Ireland|cabinet]].\n\nSeven of the eight leaders of Fianna F\u00e1il have served as head of government for at least one term of office. \u00c9amon de Valera became the first, when he was elected [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]] in 1932. He became Taoiseach with the adoption of [[Constitution of Ireland|the current Constitution]] in 1937. He remained as leader of Fianna F\u00e1il until 1959, when he retired after serving twenty-one years as head of government and after leading the party to eight general election triumphs. [[Se\u00e1n Lemass]] was the unanimous choice to succeed de Valera as leader of Fianna F\u00e1il and Taoiseach that year. He served seven years in both roles before handing over to [[Jack Lynch]] in 1966, following the first [[1966 Fianna F\u00e1il leadership election|leadership election]] in the history of the party. Lynch served as party leader for thirteen years until 1979, nine of which were spent as Taoiseach. His resignation sparked another [[1979 Fianna F\u00e1il leadership election|leadership election]], which saw [[Charles Haughey]] emerge as Taoiseach and leader of a deeply divided party. His thirteen-year period in charge saw many heaves against his leadership from within the party, with the final challenge hastening his resignation in 1992.\n\nThat year, three candidates expressed an interest in seeking the leadership; however, [[Albert Reynolds]] was the overwhelming favourite in the subsequent [[1992 Fianna F\u00e1il leadership election|leadership election]] and was elected Taoiseach and party leader. After just over two years in office, Reynolds was forced to resign in 1994. His successor was [[Bertie Ahern]] who, after being the [[1994 Fianna F\u00e1il leadership election|unopposed candidate]] for the position of leader, was forced into opposition. Ahern went on to become the most popular leader of Fianna F\u00e1il in the modern era, guiding the party to three successive election triumphs and serving almost eleven consecutive years as Taoiseach. His resignation in 2008 saw [[Brian Cowen]] take on the dual roles of Taoiseach and party leader, following an [[2008 Fianna F\u00e1il leadership election|unopposed election]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/0409/fiannafail.html|title=Cowen 'excited but daunted' by new post |work=[[RT\u00c9 News]]|date=9 April 2008|accessdate=27 January 2011}}</ref> Cowen's tenure was characterised by a downturn in the economy, and he was effectively forced to resign as party leader in 2011 while remaining as Taoiseach. Four candidates put their names forward in the subsequent [[2011 Fianna F\u00e1il leadership election|leadership election]], with former [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Foreign Minister]] [[Miche\u00e1l Martin]] becoming the eighth leader of the party.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0126/breaking8.html|title=Miche\u00e1l Martin elected as eighth leader of Fianna F\u00e1il|work=[[Irish Times]]|date=26 January 2011|accessdate=27 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Leaders==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|No.\n!Name\n!Portrait\n!Constituency\n!colspan=2|Term of Office\n!colspan=2|[[Taoiseach]]<ref name=prez/>\n|-\n! rowspan=6 style=\"background-color: {{Fianna F\u00e1il/meta/color}}\" |\n| rowspan=6|1\n| rowspan=6 style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[\u00c9amon de Valera]]\n| rowspan=6|[[File:Eamon de Valera c 1922-30.jpg|60px]]\n| rowspan=6|[[Clare (D\u00e1il constituency)|Clare]]\n| rowspan=6|23 March 1926\n| rowspan=6|23 June 1959\n| style=\"background-color: {{Cumann na nGaedhael/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[W.

The position is not an elected one and is largely honorific.\n\nThe office of [[T\u00e1naiste]] has been held by senior politicians in the main governing party. Previous Fianna F\u00e1il Deputy leaders, including [[Brian Cowen]] and [[Mary Coughlan (politician)|Mary Coughlan]], held this post from 2007 to 2011. However, the Deputy leader is essentially a party official and there is no constitutional link between the two roles.\n\nFianna F\u00e1il did not have a Deputy Leader from the reshuffle in 2012 until the reshuffle in 2018.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Portrait\n!Constituency\n!colspan=2|Term of Office\n!Office(s)\n|-\n| align=center|[[Joseph Brennan (Fianna F\u00e1il politician)|Joseph

Miche\u00e1l Martin, TD]\n}}\nThe '''Leader of Fianna F\u00e1il''' is the most senior politician within the [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] political party in Ireland. Since 26 January 2011, the office has been held by [[Miche\u00e1l Martin]], following the resignation of [[Taoiseach]] [[Brian Cowen]] as leader of the party.\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|History of Fianna F\u00e1il}}\nThe post of Leader of Fianna F\u00e1il was officially created in 1926 when [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] founded the party. De Valera had previously been leader of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] and took the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Anti-Treaty]] side during the [[Irish Civil War|Civil War]]. The new party essentially became a home for dissatisfied Sinn F\u00e9in [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TDs]] who had become disillusioned with the party's abstentionist policy from [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] and wanted to republicanise the [[Irish Free State]] from within.\n\nLike other Irish political parties, most notably [[Fine Gael]], the Leader of Fianna F\u00e1il has the power to dismiss or appoint their Deputy and to dismiss or appoint parliamentary party members to front bench positions.\n\nWhen Fianna F\u00e1il is in opposition the leader usually acts as the [[Leader of the Opposition (Ireland)|Leader of the Opposition]], and chairs the opposition front bench. Concordantly, when the party is in government, the leader would usually become [[Taoiseach]], as well as appointing the [[Government of Ireland|cabinet]].\n\nSeven of the eight leaders of Fianna F\u00e1il have served as head of government for at least one term of office. \u00c9amon de Valera became the first, when he was elected [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]] in 1932. He became Taoiseach with the adoption of [[Constitution of Ireland|the current Constitution]] in 1937. He remained as leader of Fianna F\u00e1il until 1959, when he retired after serving twenty-one years as head of government and after leading the party to eight general election triumphs. [[Se\u00e1n Lemass]] was the unanimous choice to succeed de Valera as leader of Fianna F\u00e1il and Taoiseach that year. He served seven years in both roles before handing over to [[Jack Lynch]] in 1966, following the first [[1966 Fianna F\u00e1il leadership election|leadership election]] in the history of the party. Lynch served as party leader for thirteen years until 1979, nine of which were spent as Taoiseach. His resignation sparked another [[1979 Fianna F\u00e1il leadership election|leadership election]], which saw [[Charles Haughey]] emerge as Taoiseach and leader of a deeply divided party. His thirteen-year period in charge saw many heaves against his leadership from within the party, with the final challenge hastening his resignation in 1992.\n\nThat year, three candidates expressed an interest in seeking the leadership; however, [[Albert Reynolds]] was the overwhelming favourite in the subsequent [[1992 Fianna F\u00e1il leadership election|leadership election]] and was elected Taoiseach and party leader. After just over two years in office, Reynolds was forced to resign in 1994. His successor was [[Bertie Ahern]] who, after being the [[1994 Fianna F\u00e1il leadership election|unopposed candidate]] for the position of leader, was forced into opposition. Ahern went on to become the most popular leader of Fianna F\u00e1il in the modern era, guiding the party to three successive election triumphs and serving almost eleven consecutive years as Taoiseach. His resignation in 2008 saw [[Brian Cowen]] take on the dual roles of Taoiseach and party leader, following an [[2008 Fianna F\u00e1il leadership election|unopposed election]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/0409/fiannafail.html|title=Cowen 'excited but daunted' by new post |work=[[RT\u00c9 News]]|date=9 April 2008|accessdate=27 January 2011}}</ref> Cowen's tenure was characterised by a downturn in the economy, and he was effectively forced to resign as party leader in 2011 while remaining as Taoiseach. Four candidates put their names forward in the subsequent [[2011 Fianna F\u00e1il leadership election|leadership election]], with former [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Foreign Minister]] [[Miche\u00e1l Martin]] becoming the eighth leader of the party.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0126/breaking8.html|title=Miche\u00e1l Martin elected as eighth leader of Fianna F\u00e1il|work=[[Irish Times]]|date=26 January 2011|accessdate=27 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Leaders==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|No.\n!Name\n!Portrait\n!Constituency\n!colspan=2|Term of Office\n!colspan=2|[[Taoiseach]]<ref name=prez/>\n|-\n! rowspan=6 style=\"background-color: {{Fianna F\u00e1il/meta/color}}\" |\n| rowspan=6|1\n| rowspan=6 style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[\u00c9amon de Valera]]\n| rowspan=6|[[File:Eamon de Valera c 1922-30.jpg|60px]]\n| rowspan=6|[[Clare (D\u00e1il constituency)|Clare]]\n| rowspan=6|23 March 1926\n| rowspan=6|23 June 1959\n| style=\"background-color: {{Cumann na nGaedhael/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[W.

The position is not an elected one and is largely honorific.\n\nThe office of [[T\u00e1naiste]] has been held by senior politicians in the main governing party. Previous Fianna F\u00e1il Deputy leaders, including [[Brian Cowen]] and [[Mary Coughlan (politician)|Mary Coughlan]], held this post from 2007 to 2011. However, the Deputy leader is essentially a party official and there is no constitutional link between the two roles.\n\nFianna F\u00e1il did not have a Deputy Leader from the reshuffle in 2012 until the reshuffle in 2018.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Portrait\n!Constituency\n!colspan=2|Term of Office\n!Office(s)\n|-\n| align=center|[[Joseph Brennan (Fianna F\u00e1il politician)|Joseph

This anomalous situation came about because the British Government would only recognise the parliament that it had established through the Government of Ireland Act, so Sinn F\u00e9in participated in the charade to move matters along. To add to the confusion, Collins was Griffith's Minister of Finance, while Griffith was Collins's Minister for Foreign Affairs. The dual leadership came to an end when W. T. Cosgrave assumed both offices on the deaths of Griffith, on 12 August 1922, and Collins, on 22 August, and merged the two parallel administrations.\n</ref>\n|[[File:Arthur Griffith.jpg|70px]]\n|10 January 1922\n|12 August 1922\n|[[Sinn F\u00e9in]]<br/>(''Pro-[[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Treaty]] faction'')\n|[[Cavan (D\u00e1il constituency)|Cavan]]\n|[[Government of the 2nd D\u00e1il#4th Ministry|4th Ministry]]\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: {{Cumann na nGaedhael/meta/color}}\" |\n|4.\n|[[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]]<br>{{small|(1890\u20131922)}}<ref name=\"admins\"/>\n|[[File:Michael Collins.jpg|70px]]\n|16 January 1922\n|22 August 1922\n|[[Sinn F\u00e9in]]<br/>(''Pro-[[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Treaty]] faction'')\n|[[Cork Mid, North, South, South East and West (D\u00e1il constituency)|Cork Mid, North,<br>South, South East and West]]\n|[[Government of the 2nd D\u00e1il#1st Provisional Government|1st Provisional Government]]\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: {{Cumann na nGaedhael/meta/color}}\" |\n|5.\n|[[W.

However, since 1919, heads of government in the Irish state have borne a number of titles. Under the short-lived [[Irish Republic]] of 1919\u201322 the head of government was known first as the [[President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] and later as the [[President of the Irish Republic|President of the Republic]]. Under the [[Irish Free State]] of 1922\u201337 the head of government was the [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]]. There also briefly existed, immediately before the creation of the Irish Free State, an interim office of [[Chairman of the Provisional Government of the Irish Free State|Chairman of the Provisional Government]]. For a brief period in 1921 the offices of President of the Republic and Chairman of the Provisional Government existed simultaneously.\n\n===Offices===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"text-align: center; background: #efefef; border-bottom: 2px solid gray;\"\n!Head\n!Deputy\n!Cabinet\n!State\n!Constitution\n!Date\n|-\n|[[President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]]/<br />[[President of the Irish Republic]]<ref>The ''[[President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]]'', also known as the ''Pr\u00edomh Aire'', was upgraded to a head of state-level ''[[President of the Irish Republic]]'' in August 1921.</ref>\n|''N/A''\n|[[Ministry of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann|Ministry]]\n|[[Irish Republic]]\n|[[D\u00e1il Constitution]]\n|21 January 1919 \u2013 6 December 1922<br />26 August 1921 \u2013 6 December 1922\n|-\n|[[Chairman of the Provisional Government of the Irish Free State|Chairman of the Provisional Government]]\n|''N/A''\n|[[Provisional Government of Ireland (1922)|Provisional Government]]\n|[[Southern Ireland (1921\u201322)|Southern Ireland]]\n|[[Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922]]\n|3 May 1921 \u2013 6 December 1922\n|-\n|[[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]]\n|[[Vice-President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|Vice-President]]\n|[[Executive Council of the Irish Free State|Executive Council]]\n|[[Irish Free State]]\n|[[Constitution of the Irish Free State]]\n|6 December 1922 \u2013 29 December 1937\n|-\n|[[Taoiseach]]\n|[[T\u00e1naiste]]\n|[[Government of Ireland|Government]]\n|[[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]\n|[[Constitution of Ireland]]\n|29 December 1937 \u2013 present\n|}\n\n===List of office-holders===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|No.\n!Name<br>{{small|(Birth\u2013Death)}}\n!Portrait\n!colspan=2|Term of office\n!Party\n!Constituency \n!Government\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: {{Sinn F\u00e9in/meta/color}}\" |\n|1.\n|[[Cathal Brugha]]<br>{{small|(1874\u20131922)}}\n|[[File:Cathalbrugha.JPG|70px]]\n|21 January 1919\n|1 April 1919\n|[[Sinn F\u00e9in]]\n|[[Waterford (D\u00e1il constituency)|Waterford]]\n|[[Government of the 1st D\u00e1il#1st Ministry|1st Ministry]]\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: {{Sinn F\u00e9in/meta/color}}\" |\n|2.\n|[[\u00c9amon de Valera]]<br>{{small|(1882\u20131975)}}\n|[[File:Eamon de Valera c 1922-30.jpg|70px]]\n|1 April 1919\n|9 January 1922\n|[[Sinn F\u00e9in]]\n|[[Clare (D\u00e1il constituency)|Clare]]\n|[[Government of the 1st D\u00e1il#2nd Ministry|2nd Ministry]]<br>{{small|(1919\u20131921)}}<br/>[[Government of the 2nd D\u00e1il#3rd Ministry|3rd Ministry]]<br>{{small|(1921\u20131922)}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: {{Cumann na nGaedhael/meta/color}}\" |\n|3.\n|[[Arthur Griffith]]<br>{{small|(1872\u20131922)}}<ref name=\"admins\">From January to August 1922 there were two administrations operating in parallel, the Ministry of the self-declared independent Irish Republic and the Provisional Government accepted by the United Kingdom, and each cabinet had an overlapping membership. De Valera had filled both posts, but after his resignation there were two heads of government, [[Arthur Griffith]], as President of the Republic, and [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] as Chairman of the Provisional Government of [[Southern Ireland (1921\u201322)|Southern Ireland]]. This anomalous situation came about because the British Government would only recognise the parliament that it had established through the Government of Ireland Act, so Sinn F\u00e9in participated in the charade to move matters along. To add to the confusion, Collins was Griffith's Minister of Finance, while Griffith was Collins's Minister for Foreign Affairs. The dual leadership came to an end when W. T. Cosgrave assumed both offices on the deaths of Griffith, on 12 August 1922, and Collins, on 22 August, and merged the two parallel administrations.\n</ref>\n|[[File:Arthur Griffith.jpg|70px]]\n|10 January 1922\n|12 August 1922\n|[[Sinn F\u00e9in]]<br/>(''Pro-[[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Treaty]] faction'')\n|[[Cavan (D\u00e1il constituency)|Cavan]]\n|[[Government of the 2nd D\u00e1il#4th Ministry|4th Ministry]]\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: {{Cumann na nGaedhael/meta/color}}\" |\n|4.\n|[[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]]<br>{{small|(1890\u20131922)}}<ref name=\"admins\"/>\n|[[File:Michael Collins.jpg|70px]]\n|16 January 1922\n|22 August 1922\n|[[Sinn F\u00e9in]]<br/>(''Pro-[[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Treaty]] faction'')\n|[[Cork Mid, North, South, South East and West (D\u00e1il constituency)|Cork Mid, North,<br>South, South East and West]]\n|[[Government of the 2nd D\u00e1il#1st Provisional Government|1st Provisional Government]]\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: {{Cumann na nGaedhael/meta/color}}\" |\n|5.\n|[[W.

He was [[Emperor of the French]] as '''Napoleon I''' from 1804 until 1814 and again briefly in 1815 during the [[Hundred Days]]. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a [[First French Empire|large empire]] that ruled over much of continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. He is considered one of the greatest commanders in history, and his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. Napoleon's political and cultural legacy has endured as one of the most celebrated and controversial leaders in human history.<ref name=\"Roberts, Andrew 2014\">Roberts, Andrew. ''Napoleon: A Life''.

He was serving as an artillery officer in the French army when the French Revolution erupted in 1789. He rapidly rose through the ranks of the military, seizing the new opportunities presented by the Revolution and becoming a general at age 24. The [[French Directory]] eventually gave him command of the [[Army of Italy (France)|Army of Italy]] after he suppressed the [[13 Vend\u00e9miaire]] revolt against the government from royalist insurgents. At age 26, he began his [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|first military campaign]] against the Austrians and the Italian monarchs aligned with the Habsburgs\u2014winning virtually every battle, conquering the Italian Peninsula in a year while establishing \"[[sister republic]]s\" with local support, and becoming a war hero in France. In 1798, he led a [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|military expedition to Egypt]] that served as a springboard to political power. He orchestrated a [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|coup in November 1799]] and became [[French Consulate|First Consul]] of the Republic. After the Peace of Amiens in 1802, Napoleon turned his attention to France's colonies. He sold the [[Louisiana Territory]] to the United States, and he attempted to restore slavery to the French Caribbean colonies. However, while he was successful in restoring slavery in the eastern Caribbean, Napoleon failed in his attempts to subdue [[Saint-Domingue]], and the colony that France once proudly boasted of as the \"Pearl of the Antilles\" became independent as [[Haiti]] in 1804. Napoleon's ambition and public approval inspired him to go further, and he became the first Emperor of the French in 1804. Intractable differences with the British meant that the French were facing a [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]] by 1805. Napoleon shattered this coalition with decisive victories in the [[Ulm Campaign]] and a historic triumph over the [[Russian Empire]] and [[Austrian Empire]] at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] which led to the [[dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire]]. In 1806, the [[War of the Fourth Coalition|Fourth Coalition]] took up arms against him because [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] became worried about growing French influence on the continent. Napoleon quickly defeated Prussia at the [[Battle of Jena\u2013Auerstedt|battles of Jena and Auerstedt]], then marched his ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'' deep into [[Eastern Europe]] and annihilated the Russians in June 1807 at the [[Battle of Friedland]]. France then forced the defeated nations of the Fourth Coalition to sign the [[Treaties of Tilsit]] in July 1807, bringing an uneasy peace to the continent. Tilsit signified the high-water mark of the French Empire. In 1809, the Austrians and the British challenged the French again during the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]], but Napoleon solidified his grip over Europe after triumphing at the [[Battle of Wagram]] in July.\n\nNapoleon then [[Napoleonic invasion of Iberia|occupied the Iberian Peninsula]], hoping to extend the [[Continental System]] and choke off British trade with the European mainland, and declared his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte]] the [[King of Spain]] in 1808. The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted with British support. The [[Peninsular War]] lasted six years, featured extensive [[guerrilla warfare]], and ended in victory for the Allies against Napoleon. The Continental System caused recurring diplomatic conflicts between France and its client states, especially Russia. The Russians were unwilling to bear the economic consequences of reduced trade and routinely violated the Continental System, enticing Napoleon into another war. The French launched a major [[French invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]] in the summer of 1812. The campaign destroyed Russian cities, but did not yield the decisive victory Napoleon wanted. It resulted in the collapse of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' and inspired a renewed push against Napoleon by his enemies. In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]] against France. A lengthy military campaign culminated in a large Allied army defeating Napoleon at the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in October 1813, but his tactical victory at the minor [[Battle of Hanau]] allowed retreat onto French soil. The Allies then [[1814 campaign in France|invaded France]] and captured Paris in the spring of 1814, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April. He was exiled to the island of [[Elba]] off the coast of [[Tuscany]], and the [[Bourbon dynasty]] was [[Bourbon Restoration|restored to power]]. Napoleon escaped from Elba in February 1815 and took control of France once again. The Allies responded by forming a [[War of the Seventh Coalition|Seventh Coalition]] which defeated him at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in June. The British exiled him to the remote island of [[Saint Helena]] in the South Atlantic, where he died six years later at the age of 51.\n\nNapoleon's influence on the modern world brought liberal reforms to the numerous territories that he conquered and controlled, such as the [[Low Countries]], [[Switzerland]], and large parts of modern [[Italy]] and [[Germany]]. He implemented fundamental liberal policies in France and throughout Western Europe. His [[Napoleonic Code]] has influenced the legal systems of more than 70 nations around the world. British historian [[Andrew Roberts (historian)|Andrew Roberts]] states: \"The ideas that underpin our modern world\u2014meritocracy, equality before the law, property rights, religious toleration, modern secular education, sound finances, and so on\u2014were championed, consolidated, codified and geographically extended by Napoleon. To them he added a rational and efficient local administration, an end to rural banditry, the encouragement of science and the arts, the abolition of feudalism and the greatest codification of laws since the [[fall of the Roman Empire]]\".<ref>Andrew Roberts, ''Napoleon: A Life'' (2014), p. xxxiii.</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Carlo Buonaparte.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Half-length portrait of a wigged middle-aged man with a well-to-do jacket.

He immediately went on the offensive, hoping to defeat the forces of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont]] before their Austrian allies could intervene. In a series of rapid victories during the [[Montenotte Campaign]], he knocked Piedmont out of the war in two weeks. The French then focused on the Austrians for the remainder of the war, the highlight of which became the protracted [[Siege of Mantua (1796\u201397)|struggle for Mantua]]. The Austrians launched a series of offensives against the French to break the siege, but Napoleon defeated every relief effort, scoring victories at the battles of [[Battle of Castiglione|Castiglione]], [[Battle of Bassano|Bassano]], [[Battle of Arcole|Arcole]], and [[Battle of Rivoli|Rivoli]]. The decisive French triumph at Rivoli in January 1797 led to the collapse of the Austrian position in Italy. At Rivoli, the Austrians lost up to 14,000 men while the French lost about 5,000.{{sfn|Bell|2015|p=29}}\n\nThe next phase of the campaign featured the French invasion of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] heartlands. French forces in Southern Germany had been defeated by the [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]] in 1796, but the Archduke withdrew his forces to protect Vienna after learning about Napoleon's assault. In the first encounter between the two commanders, Napoleon pushed back his opponent and advanced deep into Austrian territory after winning at the [[Battle of Tarvis (1797)|Battle of Tarvis]] in March 1797. The Austrians were alarmed by the French thrust that reached all the way to [[Leoben]], about 100&nbsp;km from Vienna, and finally decided to sue for peace.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|pp=284\u201385}}</ref> The [[Treaty of Leoben]], followed by the more comprehensive [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], gave France control of most of northern Italy and the [[Low Countries]], and a secret clause promised the [[Republic of Venice]] to Austria.

At the [[Battle of Austerlitz]], in [[Moravia]] on 2 December, he deployed the French army below the Pratzen Heights and deliberately weakened his right flank, enticing the Allies to launch a major assault there in the hopes of rolling up the whole French line.

France and Austria agreed to an armistice immediately and the Treaty of Pressburg followed shortly after on 26 December. Pressburg took Austria out of both the war and the Coalition while reinforcing the earlier treaties of [[Treaty of Campo Formio|Campo Formio]] and of [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville|Lun\u00e9ville]] between the two powers. The treaty confirmed the Austrian loss of lands to France in [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italy]] and [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]], and lands in Germany to Napoleon's German allies.

The latter assured the envoy that the [[Vistula River]] represented the natural borders between French and Russian influence in Europe. On that basis, the two emperors began peace negotiations at the town of [[Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Tilsit]] after meeting on an iconic raft on the [[Neman (river)|River Niemen]].

Given the victory he had just achieved, the French emperor offered the Russians relatively lenient terms\u2014demanding that Russia join the Continental System, withdraw its forces from [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]], and hand over the [[Ionian Islands]] to France.{{sfn|Roberts|2014|pages=458\u201359}} By contrast, Napoleon dictated very harsh peace terms for Prussia, despite the ceaseless exhortations of [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Louise]]. Wiping out half of Prussian territories from the map, Napoleon created a new kingdom of {{convert|1100|sqmi|km2|order=flip}} called [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalia]] and appointed his young brother J\u00e9r\u00f4me as its monarch. Prussia's humiliating treatment at Tilsit caused a deep and bitter antagonism which festered as the [[Napoleonic era]] progressed. Moreover, Alexander's pretensions at friendship with Napoleon led the latter to seriously misjudge the true intentions of his Russian counterpart, who would violate numerous provisions of the treaty in the next few years. Despite these problems, the [[Treaties of Tilsit]] at last gave Napoleon a respite from war and allowed him to return to France, which he had not seen in over 300 days.{{sfn|Roberts|2014|pages=459\u201361}}\n\n==== Peninsular War and Erfurt (1807-1808) ====\n{{Main|Peninsular War}}\nThe settlements at Tilsit gave Napoleon time to organise his empire. One of his major objectives became enforcing the Continental System against the British. He decided to focus his attention on the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], which consistently violated his trade prohibitions. After defeat in the [[War of the Oranges]] in 1801, Portugal adopted a double-sided policy. At first, [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]] agreed to close his ports to British trade. The situation changed dramatically after the Franco-Spanish defeat at Trafalgar; John grew bolder and officially resumed diplomatic and trade relations with Britain.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n[[File:Joseph-Bonaparte.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Bonaparte]], Napoleon's brother, as King of Spain]]\n\nUnhappy with this change of policy by the Portuguese government, Napoleon negotiated a [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1807)|secret treaty]] with [[Charles IV of Spain]] and sent an army to invade Portugal.<ref>{{cite book |last=Horne |first=Alistair |author-link=Alistair Horne |title=How Far From Austerlitz?

Throughout the winter of 1808, French agents became increasingly involved in Spanish internal affairs, attempting to incite discord between members of the [[House of Bourbon|Spanish royal family]]. On 16 February 1808, secret French machinations finally materialized when Napoleon announced that he would intervene to mediate between the rival political factions in the country.<ref>Fisher & Fremont-Barnes pp. 198\u201399.</ref>\n\n[[Joachim Murat|Marshal Murat]] led 120,000 troops into Spain. The French arrived in [[Madrid]] on 24 March,<ref>Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 199.</ref> where wild riots against the occupation erupted just a few weeks later. Napoleon appointed his brother, [[Joseph Bonaparte]], as the new King of Spain in the summer of 1808. The appointment enraged a heavily religious and conservative Spanish population. Resistance to French aggression soon spread throughout Spain. The shocking French defeat at the [[Battle of Bail\u00e9n]] in July gave hope to Napoleon's enemies and partly persuaded the French emperor to intervene in person.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nBefore going to Iberia, Napoleon decided to address several lingering issues with the Russians. At the [[Congress of Erfurt]] in October 1808, Napoleon hoped to keep Russia on his side during the upcoming struggle in Spain and during any potential conflict against Austria. The two sides reached an agreement, the Erfurt Convention, that called upon Britain to cease its war against France, that recognized the Russian conquest of [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finland]] from [[Kingdom of Sweden (1721\u20131809)|Sweden]], and that affirmed Russian support for France in a possible war against Austria \"to the best of its ability\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/diplomatic/c_erfurt.html |title=The Erfurt Convention 1808 |publisher=Napoleon-series.org |accessdate=22 April 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021094131/http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/diplomatic/c_erfurt.html |archivedate=21 October 2013  }}</ref>\n\nNapoleon then returned to France and prepared for war. The ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', under the Emperor's personal command, rapidly crossed the [[Ebro]] River in November 1808 and inflicted a series of crushing defeats against the Spanish forces. After clearing the last Spanish force guarding the capital at [[Battle of Somosierra|Somosierra]], Napoleon entered Madrid on 4 December with 80,000 troops.<ref>Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 205.</ref> He then unleashed his soldiers against [[John Moore (British soldier)|Moore]] and the British forces. The British were swiftly driven to the coast, and they withdrew from Spain entirely after a last stand at the [[Battle of Corunna]] in January 1809.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n[[File:Antoine-Jean Gros - Capitulation de Madrid, le 4 d\u00e9cembre 1808.jpg|thumb|Napoleon accepting the surrender of [[Madrid]], 4 December 1808]]\nNapoleon would end up leaving Iberia in order to deal with the Austrians in Central Europe, but the Peninsular War continued on long after his absence. He never returned to Spain after the 1808 campaign. Several months after Corunna, the British sent another army to the peninsula under the future [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. The war then settled into a complex and asymmetric strategic deadlock where all sides struggled to gain the upper hand. The highlight of the conflict became the brutal ''[[guerrilla warfare]]'' that engulfed much of the Spanish countryside. Both sides committed the worst atrocities of the Napoleonic Wars during this phase of the conflict.<ref name=\"auto4\">{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|pp=659\u201360}}</ref>\n\nThe vicious guerrilla fighting in Spain, largely absent from the French campaigns in Central Europe, severely disrupted the French lines of supply and communication. Although France maintained roughly 300,000 troops in Iberia during the Peninsular War, the vast majority were tied down to garrison duty and to intelligence operations.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> The French were never able to concentrate all of their forces effectively, prolonging the war until events elsewhere in Europe finally turned the tide in favour of the Allies. After the invasion of Russia in 1812, the number of French troops in Spain vastly declined as Napoleon needed reinforcements to conserve his strategic position in Europe. By 1814, after scores of battles and sieges throughout Iberia, the Allies had managed to push the French out of the peninsula.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe impact of the Napoleonic invasion of Spain and ousting of the Spanish Bourbon monarchy in favour of his brother Joseph had an enormous impact on the [[Spanish empire]]. In [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]] many local elites formed juntas and set up mechanisms to rule in the name of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]], whom they considered the legitimate Spanish monarch. The outbreak of the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] in most of the empire was a result of Napoleon's destabilizing actions in Spain and led to the rise of [[Strongman (politics)|strongmen]] in the wake of these wars.<ref>[[John Lynch (historian)|John Lynch]], ''Caudillos in Spanish America 1800\u20131850''.

Austria could not count on Russian support because the latter was at war with [[Anglo-Russian War (1807\u20131812)|Britain]], [[Finnish War|Sweden]], and the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806\u20131812)|Ottoman Empire]] in 1809. [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William]] of Prussia initially promised to help the Austrians, but reneged before conflict began.<ref name=\"Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 106\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes, p. 106.</ref> A report from the Austrian finance minister suggested that the treasury would run out of money by the middle of 1809 if the large army that the Austrians had formed since the Third Coalition remained mobilized.<ref name=\"Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 106\" /> Although [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]] warned that the Austrians were not ready for another showdown with Napoleon, a stance that landed him in the so-called \"peace party\", he did not want to see the army demobilized either.<ref name=\"Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 106\" /> On 8 February 1809, the advocates for war finally succeeded when the Imperial Government secretly decided on another confrontation against the French.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn the early morning of 10 April, leading elements of the Austrian army crossed the [[Inn River]] and invaded Bavaria. The early Austrian attack surprised the French; Napoleon himself was still in Paris when he heard about the invasion. He arrived at [[Donauw\u00f6rth]] on the 17th to find the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' in a dangerous position, with its two wings separated by {{convert|75|mi|km|sigfig=2|order=flip|abbr=on}} and joined together by a thin cordon of Bavarian troops. Charles pressed the left wing of the French army and hurled his men towards the III Corps of Marshal Davout. In response, Napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the Austrians in the celebrated ''Landshut Maneuver''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=690}}</ref> He realigned the axis of his army and marched his soldiers towards the town of [[Eckm\u00fchl]]. The French scored a convincing win in the resulting [[Battle of Eckm\u00fchl]], forcing Charles to withdraw his forces over the [[Danube]] and into [[Bohemia]]. On 13 May, Vienna fell for the second time in four years, although the war continued since most of the Austrian army had survived the initial engagements in Southern Germany.\n\n[[File:Wigand-Entry of Napoleon in Sch\u00f6nbrunn.jpg|thumb|The entry of Napoleon in [[Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace|Sch\u00f6nbrunn]], Vienna]]\nBy 17 May, the main Austrian army under Charles had arrived on the Marchfeld. Charles kept the bulk of his troops several kilometres away from the river bank in hopes of concentrating them at the point where Napoleon decided to cross. On 21 May, the French made their first major effort to cross the Danube, precipitating the [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]]. The Austrians enjoyed a comfortable numerical superiority over the French throughout the battle. On the first day, Charles disposed of 110,000 soldiers against only 31,000 commanded by Napoleon.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=701}}</ref> By the second day, reinforcements had boosted French numbers up to 70,000.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=705}}</ref>\n\nThe battle was characterized by a vicious back-and-forth struggle for the two villages of Aspern and Essling, the focal points of the French bridgehead. By the end of the fighting, the French had lost Aspern but still controlled Essling. A sustained Austrian artillery bombardment eventually convinced Napoleon to withdraw his forces back onto Lobau Island. Both sides inflicted about 23,000 casualties on each other.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=706}}</ref> It was the first defeat Napoleon suffered in a major set-piece battle, and it caused excitement throughout many parts of Europe because it proved that he could be beaten on the battlefield.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=707}}</ref>\n\nAfter the setback at Aspern-Essling, Napoleon took more than six weeks in planning and preparing for contingencies before he made another attempt at crossing the Danube.<ref name=\"David G.

Austrian losses were very heavy, reaching well over 40,000 casualties.<ref>David G. Chandler, ''The Campaigns of Napoleon''. p. 729</ref> The French were too exhausted to pursue the Austrians immediately, but Napoleon eventually caught up with Charles at [[Znojmo|Znaim]] and the latter signed an [[Armistice of Znaim|armistice]] on 12 July.\n\n[[File:French Empire (1812).svg|thumb|alt=Map of Europe.

The British army only landed at [[Walcheren]] on 30 July, by which point the Austrians had already been defeated. The Walcheren Campaign was characterized by little fighting but heavy casualties thanks to the popularly dubbed \"[[Walcheren Fever]]\". Over 4000 British troops were lost in a bungled campaign, and the rest withdrew in December 1809.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/battles/c_walcheren.html|title=The British Expeditionary Force to Walcheren: 1809|publisher=napoleon-series.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718144402/http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/battles/c_walcheren.html|archivedate=18 July 2011}}</ref> The main strategic result from the campaign became the delayed political settlement between the French and the Austrians. Emperor Francis wanted to wait and see how the British performed in their theatre before entering into negotiations with Napoleon. Once it became apparent that the British were going nowhere, the Austrians agreed to peace talks.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe resulting [[Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn]] in October 1809 was the harshest that France had imposed on Austria in recent memory. [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]] and Archduke Charles had the preservation of the [[Austrian Empire|Habsburg Empire]] as their fundamental goal, and to this end they succeeded by making Napoleon seek more modest goals in return for promises of friendship between the two powers.<ref name=\"Todd Fisher p. 144\">Todd Fisher & Gregory Fremont-Barnes, ''The Napoleonic Wars: The Rise and Fall of an Empire''. p. 144.</ref> Nevertheless, while most of the hereditary lands remained a part of the Habsburg realm, France received [[Carinthia (province)|Carinthia]], [[Carniola]], and the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] ports, while [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] was given to the [[Duchy of Warsaw|Poles]] and the [[Salzburg]] area of the [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] went to the [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavarians]].<ref name=\"Todd Fisher p. 144\" /> Austria lost over three million subjects, about one-fifth of her total population, as a result of these territorial changes.<ref>David G.

[[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais|Empress Jos\u00e9phine]] had still not given birth to a child from Napoleon, who became worried about the future of his empire following his death. Desperate for a legitimate heir, Napoleon divorced Jos\u00e9phine on 10 January 1810 and started looking for a new wife. Hoping to cement the recent alliance with Austria through a family connection, Napoleon married the [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma]], daughter of [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]], who was 18 years old at the time. On 20 March 1811, Marie Louise gave birth to a baby boy, whom Napoleon made heir apparent and bestowed the title of ''[[King of the Romans|King of Rome]]''. His son never actually ruled the empire, but given his brief titular rule and cousin Louis-Napol\u00e9on's subsequent naming himself Napol\u00e9on III, historians often refer to him as ''[[Napoleon II]]''.<ref>David Watkin, ''The Roman Forum''.

The leaders had a friendly personal relationship after their first meeting at Tilsit in 1807.<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=378}}</ref> By 1811, however, tensions had increased and Alexander was under pressure from the [[Russian nobility]] to break off the alliance.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} A major strain on the relationship between the two nations became the regular violations of the Continental System by the Russians, which led Napoleon to threaten Alexander with serious consequences if he formed an alliance with Britain.<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=495}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Napoleon in burning Moscow - Adam Albrecht (1841).jpg|thumb|Napoleon watching the [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|fire of Moscow]] in September 1812, by Adam Albrecht (1841)]]\n[[File:Napoleons retreat from moscow.jpg|thumb|''Napoleon's withdrawal from Russia'', painting by [[Adolph Northen]]]]\n\nBy 1812, advisers to Alexander suggested the possibility of an invasion of the French Empire and the recapture of Poland. On receipt of intelligence reports on Russia's war preparations, Napoleon expanded his ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' to more than 450,000 men.<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=507}}</ref> He ignored repeated advice against an invasion of the Russian heartland and prepared for an offensive campaign; on 24 June 1812 the invasion commenced.<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=506}}</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to gain increased support from Polish nationalists and patriots, Napoleon termed the war the ''Second Polish War''\u2014the ''First Polish War'' had been the [[Bar Confederation]] uprising by Polish nobles against Russia in 1768. Polish patriots wanted the Russian part of Poland to be joined with the Duchy of Warsaw and an independent Poland created. This was rejected by Napoleon, who stated he had promised his ally Austria this would not happen. Napoleon refused to [[manumission|manumit]] the Russian [[serf]]s because of concerns this might provoke a reaction in his army's rear. The serfs later committed atrocities against French soldiers during France's retreat.<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|pp=504\u201305}}</ref>\n\nThe Russians avoided Napoleon's objective of a decisive engagement and instead retreated deeper into Russia. A brief attempt at resistance was made at [[Battle of Smolensk (1812)|Smolensk]] in August; the Russians were defeated in a series of battles, and Napoleon resumed his advance. The Russians again avoided battle, although in a few cases this was only achieved because Napoleon uncharacteristically hesitated to attack when the opportunity arose. Owing to the Russian army's [[scorched earth]] tactics, the French found it increasingly difficult to forage food for themselves and their horses.<ref>Harvey 2006, p. 773</ref>\n\nThe Russians eventually offered battle outside Moscow on 7 September: the [[Battle of Borodino]] resulted in approximately 44,000 Russian and 35,000 French dead, wounded or captured, and may have been the bloodiest day of battle in history up to that point in time.<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=518}}</ref> Although the French had won, the Russian army had accepted, and withstood, the major battle Napoleon had hoped would be decisive. Napoleon's own account was: \"The most terrible of all my battles was the one before Moscow. The French showed themselves to be worthy of victory, but the Russians showed themselves worthy of being invincible\".<ref>Markham 1988, p. 194</ref>\n\nThe Russian army withdrew and retreated past Moscow. Napoleon entered the city, assuming its fall would end the war and Alexander would negotiate peace. However, on orders of the city's governor [[Feodor Rostopchin]], rather than capitulation, Moscow was burned. After five weeks, Napoleon and his army left. In early November Napoleon got concerned about loss of control back in France after the [[Malet coup of 1812]]. His army walked through snow up to their knees, and nearly 10,000 men and horses froze to death on the night of 8/9 November alone. After the [[Battle of Berezina]] Napoleon managed to escape but had to abandon much of the remaining artillery and baggage train. On 5 December, shortly before arriving in Vilnius, Napoleon left the army in a sledge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.napoleon-1812.nl/english.php|title=Napoleon1812|work=napoleon-1812.nl|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213205204/http://napoleon-1812.nl/english.php|archivedate=13 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe French suffered in the course of a ruinous retreat, including from the harshness of the [[Russian Winter]].

Napoleon would remain as Emperor of France, but it would be reduced to its \"natural frontiers\". That meant that France could retain control of Belgium, Savoy and the Rhineland (the west bank of the Rhine River), while giving up control of all the rest, including all of Spain and the Netherlands, and most of Italy and Germany. Metternich told Napoleon these were the best terms the Allies were likely to offer; after further victories, the terms would be harsher and harsher. Metternich's motivation was to maintain France as a balance against Russian threats, while ending the highly destabilizing series of wars.<ref name=\"J. P.

His description of Napoleon in the months before his death led [[Sten Forshufvud]] in a 1961 paper in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' to put forward other causes for his death, including deliberate [[arsenic poisoning]].<ref name=Cullen>Cullen 2008, pp. 146\u201348</ref> Arsenic was used as a poison during the era because it was undetectable when administered over a long period. Furthermore, in a 1978 book with [[Ben Weider]], Forshufvud noted that Napoleon's body was found to be well preserved when moved in 1840. Arsenic is a strong preservative, and therefore this supported the poisoning hypothesis. Forshufvud and Weider observed that Napoleon had attempted to quench abnormal thirst by drinking large amounts of [[orgeat syrup]] that contained cyanide compounds in the almonds used for flavouring.<ref name=Cullen />\n\nThey maintained that the [[potassium tartrate]] used in his treatment prevented his stomach from expelling these compounds and that his thirst was a symptom of the poison. Their hypothesis was that the [[calomel]] given to Napoleon became an overdose, which killed him and left extensive [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] damage behind.<ref name=Cullen /> According to a 2007 article, the type of arsenic found in Napoleon's hair shafts was mineral, the most toxic, and according to toxicologist Patrick Kintz, this supported the conclusion that he was murdered.<ref name=cullen156>Cullen 2008, p. 156</ref>\n\nThere have been modern studies that have supported the original autopsy finding.<ref name=cullen156 /> In a 2008 study, researchers analysed samples of Napoleon's hair from throughout his life, as well as samples from his family and other contemporaries. All samples had high levels of arsenic, approximately 100 times higher than the current average. According to these researchers, Napoleon's body was already heavily contaminated with arsenic as a boy, and the high arsenic concentration in his hair was not caused by intentional poisoning; people were constantly exposed to arsenic from glues and dyes throughout their lives.{{Efn|The body can tolerate large doses of arsenic if ingested regularly, and arsenic was a fashionable [[Panacea (medicine)|cure-all]].<ref>Cullen 2008, p. 50</ref>}} Studies published in 2007 and 2008 dismissed evidence of arsenic poisoning, and confirmed evidence of [[peptic ulcer]] and [[gastric cancer]] as the cause of death.<ref>Cullen 2008, p. 161, and Hindmarsh et al. 2008, p. 2092</ref>\n\n== Religion ==\n{{Further|Napoleon and the Catholic Church}}\n[[File:France dioceses 1801.svg|thumb|right|Reorganisation of the religious geography: France is divided into 59 [[diocese]]s and 10 [[ecclesiastical provinces]].]]\n\nNapoleon was baptised in [[Ajaccio]] on 21 July 1771.

This was in contrast to the complex uniforms with many decorations of his [[Marshal of the Empire|marshals]] and those around him.\n\nIn his later years he gained quite a bit of weight and had a complexion considered pale or sallow, something contemporaries took note of.

The increased importance of artillery after 1807 stemmed from his creation of a highly mobile artillery force, the growth in artillery numbers, and changes in artillery practices. As a result of these factors, Napoleon, rather than relying on infantry to wear away the enemy's defences, now could use massed artillery as a spearhead to pound a break in the enemy's line that was then exploited by supporting infantry and cavalry. McConachy rejects the alternative theory that growing reliance on artillery by the French army beginning in 1807 was an outgrowth of the declining quality of the French infantry and, later, France's inferiority in cavalry numbers.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.reenactor.ru/ARH/PDF/McConachy.pdf |url-status=live |jstor=2677528 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119131512/http://www.reenactor.ru/ARH/PDF/McConachy.pdf |archive-date=19 January 2012|title=The Roots of Artillery Doctrine: Napoleonic Artillery Tactics Reconsidered |journal=The Journal of Military History |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=617\u2013640 |last1=McConachy |first1=Bruce |year=2001 |doi=10.2307/2677528 }}</ref> Weapons and other kinds of military technology remained static through the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, but 18th-century [[operational mobility]] underwent change.<ref>Archer et al. 2002, p. 383</ref>\n\nNapoleon's biggest influence was in the conduct of warfare.

The propagandistic rhetoric changed in relation to events and to the atmosphere of Napoleon's reign, focusing first on his role as a general in the army and identification as a soldier, and moving to his role as emperor and a civil leader. Specifically targeting his civilian audience, Napoleon fostered a relationship with the contemporary art community, taking an active role in commissioning and controlling different forms of art production to suit his propaganda goals.<ref>Alan Forrest, \"Propaganda and the Legitimation of Power in Napoleonic France\".

He was [[Emperor of the French]] as '''Napoleon I''' from 1804 until 1814 and again briefly in 1815 during the [[Hundred Days]]. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a [[First French Empire|large empire]] that ruled over much of continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. He is considered one of the greatest commanders in history, and his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. Napoleon's political and cultural legacy has endured as one of the most celebrated and controversial leaders in human history.<ref name=\"Roberts, Andrew 2014\">Roberts, Andrew. ''Napoleon: A Life''.

He was serving as an artillery officer in the French army when the French Revolution erupted in 1789. He rapidly rose through the ranks of the military, seizing the new opportunities presented by the Revolution and becoming a general at age 24. The [[French Directory]] eventually gave him command of the [[Army of Italy (France)|Army of Italy]] after he suppressed the [[13 Vend\u00e9miaire]] revolt against the government from royalist insurgents. At age 26, he began his [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|first military campaign]] against the Austrians and the Italian monarchs aligned with the Habsburgs\u2014winning virtually every battle, conquering the Italian Peninsula in a year while establishing \"[[sister republic]]s\" with local support, and becoming a war hero in France. In 1798, he led a [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|military expedition to Egypt]] that served as a springboard to political power. He orchestrated a [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|coup in November 1799]] and became [[French Consulate|First Consul]] of the Republic. After the Peace of Amiens in 1802, Napoleon turned his attention to France's colonies. He sold the [[Louisiana Territory]] to the United States, and he attempted to restore slavery to the French Caribbean colonies. However, while he was successful in restoring slavery in the eastern Caribbean, Napoleon failed in his attempts to subdue [[Saint-Domingue]], and the colony that France once proudly boasted of as the \"Pearl of the Antilles\" became independent as [[Haiti]] in 1804. Napoleon's ambition and public approval inspired him to go further, and he became the first Emperor of the French in 1804. Intractable differences with the British meant that the French were facing a [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]] by 1805. Napoleon shattered this coalition with decisive victories in the [[Ulm Campaign]] and a historic triumph over the [[Russian Empire]] and [[Austrian Empire]] at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] which led to the [[dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire]]. In 1806, the [[War of the Fourth Coalition|Fourth Coalition]] took up arms against him because [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] became worried about growing French influence on the continent. Napoleon quickly defeated Prussia at the [[Battle of Jena\u2013Auerstedt|battles of Jena and Auerstedt]], then marched his ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'' deep into [[Eastern Europe]] and annihilated the Russians in June 1807 at the [[Battle of Friedland]]. France then forced the defeated nations of the Fourth Coalition to sign the [[Treaties of Tilsit]] in July 1807, bringing an uneasy peace to the continent. Tilsit signified the high-water mark of the French Empire. In 1809, the Austrians and the British challenged the French again during the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]], but Napoleon solidified his grip over Europe after triumphing at the [[Battle of Wagram]] in July.\n\nNapoleon then [[Napoleonic invasion of Iberia|occupied the Iberian Peninsula]], hoping to extend the [[Continental System]] and choke off British trade with the European mainland, and declared his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte]] the [[King of Spain]] in 1808. The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted with British support. The [[Peninsular War]] lasted six years, featured extensive [[guerrilla warfare]], and ended in victory for the Allies against Napoleon. The Continental System caused recurring diplomatic conflicts between France and its client states, especially Russia. The Russians were unwilling to bear the economic consequences of reduced trade and routinely violated the Continental System, enticing Napoleon into another war. The French launched a major [[French invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]] in the summer of 1812. The campaign destroyed Russian cities, but did not yield the decisive victory Napoleon wanted. It resulted in the collapse of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' and inspired a renewed push against Napoleon by his enemies. In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]] against France. A lengthy military campaign culminated in a large Allied army defeating Napoleon at the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in October 1813, but his tactical victory at the minor [[Battle of Hanau]] allowed retreat onto French soil. The Allies then [[1814 campaign in France|invaded France]] and captured Paris in the spring of 1814, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April. He was exiled to the island of [[Elba]] off the coast of [[Tuscany]], and the [[Bourbon dynasty]] was [[Bourbon Restoration|restored to power]]. Napoleon escaped from Elba in February 1815 and took control of France once again. The Allies responded by forming a [[War of the Seventh Coalition|Seventh Coalition]] which defeated him at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in June. The British exiled him to the remote island of [[Saint Helena]] in the South Atlantic, where he died six years later at the age of 51.\n\nNapoleon's influence on the modern world brought liberal reforms to the numerous territories that he conquered and controlled, such as the [[Low Countries]], [[Switzerland]], and large parts of modern [[Italy]] and [[Germany]]. He implemented fundamental liberal policies in France and throughout Western Europe. His [[Napoleonic Code]] has influenced the legal systems of more than 70 nations around the world. British historian [[Andrew Roberts (historian)|Andrew Roberts]] states: \"The ideas that underpin our modern world\u2014meritocracy, equality before the law, property rights, religious toleration, modern secular education, sound finances, and so on\u2014were championed, consolidated, codified and geographically extended by Napoleon. To them he added a rational and efficient local administration, an end to rural banditry, the encouragement of science and the arts, the abolition of feudalism and the greatest codification of laws since the [[fall of the Roman Empire]]\".<ref>Andrew Roberts, ''Napoleon: A Life'' (2014), p. xxxiii.</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Carlo Buonaparte.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Half-length portrait of a wigged middle-aged man with a well-to-do jacket.

He immediately went on the offensive, hoping to defeat the forces of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont]] before their Austrian allies could intervene. In a series of rapid victories during the [[Montenotte Campaign]], he knocked Piedmont out of the war in two weeks. The French then focused on the Austrians for the remainder of the war, the highlight of which became the protracted [[Siege of Mantua (1796\u201397)|struggle for Mantua]]. The Austrians launched a series of offensives against the French to break the siege, but Napoleon defeated every relief effort, scoring victories at the battles of [[Battle of Castiglione|Castiglione]], [[Battle of Bassano|Bassano]], [[Battle of Arcole|Arcole]], and [[Battle of Rivoli|Rivoli]]. The decisive French triumph at Rivoli in January 1797 led to the collapse of the Austrian position in Italy. At Rivoli, the Austrians lost up to 14,000 men while the French lost about 5,000.{{sfn|Bell|2015|p=29}}\n\nThe next phase of the campaign featured the French invasion of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] heartlands. French forces in Southern Germany had been defeated by the [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]] in 1796, but the Archduke withdrew his forces to protect Vienna after learning about Napoleon's assault. In the first encounter between the two commanders, Napoleon pushed back his opponent and advanced deep into Austrian territory after winning at the [[Battle of Tarvis (1797)|Battle of Tarvis]] in March 1797. The Austrians were alarmed by the French thrust that reached all the way to [[Leoben]], about 100&nbsp;km from Vienna, and finally decided to sue for peace.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|pp=284\u201385}}</ref> The [[Treaty of Leoben]], followed by the more comprehensive [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], gave France control of most of northern Italy and the [[Low Countries]], and a secret clause promised the [[Republic of Venice]] to Austria. Bonaparte marched on Venice and forced its surrender, ending 1,100 years of independence. He also authorized the French to loot treasures such as the [[Horses of Saint Mark]].<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=132}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bonaparte re\u00e7oit les prisonniers sur le champ de bataille, 1797.jpg|thumb|Bonaparte during the Italian campaign in 1797]]\nHis application of conventional military ideas to real-world situations enabled his military triumphs, such as creative use of artillery as a mobile force to support his infantry. He stated later in life:{{When|date=August 2016}} \"I have fought sixty battles and I have learned nothing which I did not know at the beginning. Look at Caesar; he fought the first like the last\".<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=145}}</ref>\n\nBonaparte could win battles by concealment of troop deployments and concentration of his forces on the \"hinge\" of an enemy's weakened front. If he could not use his favourite [[Pincer movement|envelopment strategy]], he would take up the central position and attack two co-operating forces at their hinge, swing round to fight one until it fled, then turn to face the other.<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=142}}</ref> In this Italian campaign, Bonaparte's army captured 150,000 prisoners, 540 cannons, and 170 [[flag|standards]].<ref>Harvey 2006, p. 179</ref> The French army fought 67 actions and won 18 [[pitched battle]]s through superior artillery technology and Bonaparte's tactics.<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=135}}</ref>\n\nDuring the campaign, Bonaparte became increasingly influential in French politics. He founded two newspapers: one for the troops in his army and another for circulation in France.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|p=306}}</ref> The royalists attacked Bonaparte for looting Italy and warned that he might become a dictator.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|p=305}}</ref> Napoleon's forces extracted an estimated $45 million in funds from Italy during their campaign there, another $12 million in precious metals and jewels.

This left Barras and his Republican allies in control again but dependent on Bonaparte, who proceeded to peace negotiations with Austria.

A forced march from Vienna by [[Louis-Nicolas Davout|Marshal Davout]] and his [[III Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)|III Corps]] plugged the gap left by Napoleon just in time.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, the heavy Allied deployment against the French right flank weakened their center on the Pratzen Heights, which was viciously attacked by the [[IV Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)|IV Corps]] of [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Marshal Soult]]. With the Allied center demolished, the French swept through both enemy flanks and sent the Allies fleeing chaotically, capturing thousands of prisoners in the process. The battle is often seen as a tactical masterpiece because of the near-perfect execution of a calibrated but dangerous plan\u2014of the same stature as [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]], the celebrated triumph by [[Hannibal]] some 2,000 years before.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThe Allied disaster at Austerlitz significantly shook the faith of Emperor Francis in the British-led war effort. France and Austria agreed to an armistice immediately and the Treaty of Pressburg followed shortly after on 26 December. Pressburg took Austria out of both the war and the Coalition while reinforcing the earlier treaties of [[Treaty of Campo Formio|Campo Formio]] and of [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville|Lun\u00e9ville]] between the two powers. The treaty confirmed the Austrian loss of lands to France in [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italy]] and [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]], and lands in Germany to Napoleon's German allies. It also imposed an indemnity of 40 million francs on the defeated Habsburgs and allowed the fleeing Russian troops free passage through hostile territories and back to their home soil.

A collection of German states intended to serve as a buffer zone between France and Central Europe, the creation of the Confederation spelled the end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and significantly alarmed the Prussians. The brazen reorganisation of German territory by the French risked threatening Prussian influence in the region, if not eliminating it outright. War fever in Berlin rose steadily throughout the summer of 1806. At the insistence of his court, especially his wife [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Louise]], [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] decided to challenge the French domination of Central Europe by going to war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael V.

In a letter to [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Marshal Soult]] detailing the plan for the campaign, Napoleon described the essential features of Napoleonic warfare and introduced the phrase ''le bataillon-carr\u00e9'' (\"square battalion\").<ref name=\"Chandler 1966, p. 467-8\">Chandler 1966, pp. 467\u201368</ref> In the ''bataillon-carr\u00e9'' system, the various corps of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' would march uniformly together in close supporting distance.<ref name=\"Chandler 1966, p. 467-8\" /> If any single corps was attacked, the others could quickly spring into action and arrive to help.<ref name=\"auto2\">Brooks 2000, p. 110</ref>\n\nNapoleon invaded Prussia with 180,000 troops, rapidly marching on the right bank of the [[Saale|River Saale]]. As in previous campaigns, his fundamental objective was to destroy one opponent before reinforcements from another could tip the balance of the war. Upon learning the whereabouts of the Prussian army, the French swung westwards and crossed the Saale with overwhelming force. At the twin [[Battle of Jena\u2013Auerstedt|battles of Jena and Auerstedt]], fought on 14 October, the French convincingly defeated the Prussians and inflicted heavy casualties. With several major commanders dead or incapacitated, the Prussian king proved incapable of effectively commanding the army, which began to quickly disintegrate.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nIn a vaunted pursuit that epitomized the \"peak of Napoleonic warfare\", according to historian Richard Brooks,<ref name=\"auto2\"/> the French managed to capture 140,000 soldiers, over 2,000 cannons and hundreds of ammunition wagons, all in a single month. Historian David Chandler wrote of the Prussian forces: \"Never has the morale of any army been more completely shattered\".<ref name=\"Chandler 1966, p. 467-8\" /> Despite their overwhelming defeat, the Prussians refused to negotiate with the French until the Russians had an opportunity to enter the fight.\n\n[[File:Tilsitz 1807.JPG|thumb|Napoleon meeting with [[Alexander I of Russia]] on a raft in the middle of the [[Neman|Nieman River]] during the [[Treaties of Tilsit]]]]\n\nFollowing his triumph, Napoleon imposed the first elements of the Continental System through the [[Berlin Decree]] issued in November 1806.

The scale of their defeat convinced the Russians to make peace with the French. On 19 June, Tsar Alexander sent an envoy to seek an armistice with Napoleon. The latter assured the envoy that the [[Vistula River]] represented the natural borders between French and Russian influence in Europe. On that basis, the two emperors began peace negotiations at the town of [[Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Tilsit]] after meeting on an iconic raft on the [[Neman (river)|River Niemen]]. The very first thing Alexander said to Napoleon was probably well-calibrated: \"I hate the English as much as you do\".<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\nAlexander faced pressure from his brother, [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia|Duke Constantine]], to make peace with Napoleon. Given the victory he had just achieved, the French emperor offered the Russians relatively lenient terms\u2014demanding that Russia join the Continental System, withdraw its forces from [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]], and hand over the [[Ionian Islands]] to France.{{sfn|Roberts|2014|pages=458\u201359}} By contrast, Napoleon dictated very harsh peace terms for Prussia, despite the ceaseless exhortations of [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Louise]]. Wiping out half of Prussian territories from the map, Napoleon created a new kingdom of {{convert|1100|sqmi|km2|order=flip}} called [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalia]] and appointed his young brother J\u00e9r\u00f4me as its monarch. Prussia's humiliating treatment at Tilsit caused a deep and bitter antagonism which festered as the [[Napoleonic era]] progressed. Moreover, Alexander's pretensions at friendship with Napoleon led the latter to seriously misjudge the true intentions of his Russian counterpart, who would violate numerous provisions of the treaty in the next few years. Despite these problems, the [[Treaties of Tilsit]] at last gave Napoleon a respite from war and allowed him to return to France, which he had not seen in over 300 days.{{sfn|Roberts|2014|pages=459\u201361}}\n\n==== Peninsular War and Erfurt (1807-1808) ====\n{{Main|Peninsular War}}\nThe settlements at Tilsit gave Napoleon time to organise his empire. One of his major objectives became enforcing the Continental System against the British. He decided to focus his attention on the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], which consistently violated his trade prohibitions. After defeat in the [[War of the Oranges]] in 1801, Portugal adopted a double-sided policy. At first, [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]] agreed to close his ports to British trade. The situation changed dramatically after the Franco-Spanish defeat at Trafalgar; John grew bolder and officially resumed diplomatic and trade relations with Britain.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n[[File:Joseph-Bonaparte.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Bonaparte]], Napoleon's brother, as King of Spain]]\n\nUnhappy with this change of policy by the Portuguese government, Napoleon negotiated a [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1807)|secret treaty]] with [[Charles IV of Spain]] and sent an army to invade Portugal.<ref>{{cite book |last=Horne |first=Alistair |author-link=Alistair Horne |title=How Far From Austerlitz?

Throughout the winter of 1808, French agents became increasingly involved in Spanish internal affairs, attempting to incite discord between members of the [[House of Bourbon|Spanish royal family]]. On 16 February 1808, secret French machinations finally materialized when Napoleon announced that he would intervene to mediate between the rival political factions in the country.<ref>Fisher & Fremont-Barnes pp. 198\u201399.</ref>\n\n[[Joachim Murat|Marshal Murat]] led 120,000 troops into Spain. The French arrived in [[Madrid]] on 24 March,<ref>Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 199.</ref> where wild riots against the occupation erupted just a few weeks later. Napoleon appointed his brother, [[Joseph Bonaparte]], as the new King of Spain in the summer of 1808. The appointment enraged a heavily religious and conservative Spanish population. Resistance to French aggression soon spread throughout Spain. The shocking French defeat at the [[Battle of Bail\u00e9n]] in July gave hope to Napoleon's enemies and partly persuaded the French emperor to intervene in person.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nBefore going to Iberia, Napoleon decided to address several lingering issues with the Russians. At the [[Congress of Erfurt]] in October 1808, Napoleon hoped to keep Russia on his side during the upcoming struggle in Spain and during any potential conflict against Austria. The two sides reached an agreement, the Erfurt Convention, that called upon Britain to cease its war against France, that recognized the Russian conquest of [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finland]] from [[Kingdom of Sweden (1721\u20131809)|Sweden]], and that affirmed Russian support for France in a possible war against Austria \"to the best of its ability\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/diplomatic/c_erfurt.html |title=The Erfurt Convention 1808 |publisher=Napoleon-series.org |accessdate=22 April 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021094131/http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/diplomatic/c_erfurt.html |archivedate=21 October 2013  }}</ref>\n\nNapoleon then returned to France and prepared for war. The ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', under the Emperor's personal command, rapidly crossed the [[Ebro]] River in November 1808 and inflicted a series of crushing defeats against the Spanish forces. After clearing the last Spanish force guarding the capital at [[Battle of Somosierra|Somosierra]], Napoleon entered Madrid on 4 December with 80,000 troops.<ref>Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 205.</ref> He then unleashed his soldiers against [[John Moore (British soldier)|Moore]] and the British forces. The British were swiftly driven to the coast, and they withdrew from Spain entirely after a last stand at the [[Battle of Corunna]] in January 1809.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n[[File:Antoine-Jean Gros - Capitulation de Madrid, le 4 d\u00e9cembre 1808.jpg|thumb|Napoleon accepting the surrender of [[Madrid]], 4 December 1808]]\nNapoleon would end up leaving Iberia in order to deal with the Austrians in Central Europe, but the Peninsular War continued on long after his absence. He never returned to Spain after the 1808 campaign. Several months after Corunna, the British sent another army to the peninsula under the future [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. The war then settled into a complex and asymmetric strategic deadlock where all sides struggled to gain the upper hand. The highlight of the conflict became the brutal ''[[guerrilla warfare]]'' that engulfed much of the Spanish countryside. Both sides committed the worst atrocities of the Napoleonic Wars during this phase of the conflict.<ref name=\"auto4\">{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|pp=659\u201360}}</ref>\n\nThe vicious guerrilla fighting in Spain, largely absent from the French campaigns in Central Europe, severely disrupted the French lines of supply and communication. Although France maintained roughly 300,000 troops in Iberia during the Peninsular War, the vast majority were tied down to garrison duty and to intelligence operations.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> The French were never able to concentrate all of their forces effectively, prolonging the war until events elsewhere in Europe finally turned the tide in favour of the Allies. After the invasion of Russia in 1812, the number of French troops in Spain vastly declined as Napoleon needed reinforcements to conserve his strategic position in Europe. By 1814, after scores of battles and sieges throughout Iberia, the Allies had managed to push the French out of the peninsula.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe impact of the Napoleonic invasion of Spain and ousting of the Spanish Bourbon monarchy in favour of his brother Joseph had an enormous impact on the [[Spanish empire]]. In [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]] many local elites formed juntas and set up mechanisms to rule in the name of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]], whom they considered the legitimate Spanish monarch. The outbreak of the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] in most of the empire was a result of Napoleon's destabilizing actions in Spain and led to the rise of [[Strongman (politics)|strongmen]] in the wake of these wars.<ref>[[John Lynch (historian)|John Lynch]], ''Caudillos in Spanish America 1800\u20131850''.

The early Austrian attack surprised the French; Napoleon himself was still in Paris when he heard about the invasion. He arrived at [[Donauw\u00f6rth]] on the 17th to find the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' in a dangerous position, with its two wings separated by {{convert|75|mi|km|sigfig=2|order=flip|abbr=on}} and joined together by a thin cordon of Bavarian troops. Charles pressed the left wing of the French army and hurled his men towards the III Corps of Marshal Davout. In response, Napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the Austrians in the celebrated ''Landshut Maneuver''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=690}}</ref> He realigned the axis of his army and marched his soldiers towards the town of [[Eckm\u00fchl]]. The French scored a convincing win in the resulting [[Battle of Eckm\u00fchl]], forcing Charles to withdraw his forces over the [[Danube]] and into [[Bohemia]]. On 13 May, Vienna fell for the second time in four years, although the war continued since most of the Austrian army had survived the initial engagements in Southern Germany.\n\n[[File:Wigand-Entry of Napoleon in Sch\u00f6nbrunn.jpg|thumb|The entry of Napoleon in [[Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace|Sch\u00f6nbrunn]], Vienna]]\nBy 17 May, the main Austrian army under Charles had arrived on the Marchfeld. Charles kept the bulk of his troops several kilometres away from the river bank in hopes of concentrating them at the point where Napoleon decided to cross. On 21 May, the French made their first major effort to cross the Danube, precipitating the [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]]. The Austrians enjoyed a comfortable numerical superiority over the French throughout the battle. On the first day, Charles disposed of 110,000 soldiers against only 31,000 commanded by Napoleon.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=701}}</ref> By the second day, reinforcements had boosted French numbers up to 70,000.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=705}}</ref>\n\nThe battle was characterized by a vicious back-and-forth struggle for the two villages of Aspern and Essling, the focal points of the French bridgehead. By the end of the fighting, the French had lost Aspern but still controlled Essling.

Desperate for a legitimate heir, Napoleon divorced Jos\u00e9phine on 10 January 1810 and started looking for a new wife. Hoping to cement the recent alliance with Austria through a family connection, Napoleon married the [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma]], daughter of [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]], who was 18 years old at the time. On 20 March 1811, Marie Louise gave birth to a baby boy, whom Napoleon made heir apparent and bestowed the title of ''[[King of the Romans|King of Rome]]''.

A brief attempt at resistance was made at [[Battle of Smolensk (1812)|Smolensk]] in August; the Russians were defeated in a series of battles, and Napoleon resumed his advance. The Russians again avoided battle, although in a few cases this was only achieved because Napoleon uncharacteristically hesitated to attack when the opportunity arose. Owing to the Russian army's [[scorched earth]] tactics, the French found it increasingly difficult to forage food for themselves and their horses.<ref>Harvey 2006, p. 773</ref>\n\nThe Russians eventually offered battle outside Moscow on 7 September: the [[Battle of Borodino]] resulted in approximately 44,000 Russian and 35,000 French dead, wounded or captured, and may have been the bloodiest day of battle in history up to that point in time.<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=518}}</ref> Although the French had won, the Russian army had accepted, and withstood, the major battle Napoleon had hoped would be decisive. Napoleon's own account was: \"The most terrible of all my battles was the one before Moscow. The French showed themselves to be worthy of victory, but the Russians showed themselves worthy of being invincible\".<ref>Markham 1988, p. 194</ref>\n\nThe Russian army withdrew and retreated past Moscow. Napoleon entered the city, assuming its fall would end the war and Alexander would negotiate peace. However, on orders of the city's governor [[Feodor Rostopchin]], rather than capitulation, Moscow was burned. After five weeks, Napoleon and his army left. In early November Napoleon got concerned about loss of control back in France after the [[Malet coup of 1812]]. His army walked through snow up to their knees, and nearly 10,000 men and horses froze to death on the night of 8/9 November alone. After the [[Battle of Berezina]] Napoleon managed to escape but had to abandon much of the remaining artillery and baggage train. On 5 December, shortly before arriving in Vilnius, Napoleon left the army in a sledge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.napoleon-1812.nl/english.php|title=Napoleon1812|work=napoleon-1812.nl|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213205204/http://napoleon-1812.nl/english.php|archivedate=13 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe French suffered in the course of a ruinous retreat, including from the harshness of the [[Russian Winter]].

Napoleon would remain as Emperor of France, but it would be reduced to its \"natural frontiers\". That meant that France could retain control of Belgium, Savoy and the Rhineland (the west bank of the Rhine River), while giving up control of all the rest, including all of Spain and the Netherlands, and most of Italy and Germany. Metternich told Napoleon these were the best terms the Allies were likely to offer; after further victories, the terms would be harsher and harsher. Metternich's motivation was to maintain France as a balance against Russian threats, while ending the highly destabilizing series of wars.<ref name=\"J. P.

Furthermore, in a 1978 book with [[Ben Weider]], Forshufvud noted that Napoleon's body was found to be well preserved when moved in 1840. Arsenic is a strong preservative, and therefore this supported the poisoning hypothesis. Forshufvud and Weider observed that Napoleon had attempted to quench abnormal thirst by drinking large amounts of [[orgeat syrup]] that contained cyanide compounds in the almonds used for flavouring.<ref name=Cullen />\n\nThey maintained that the [[potassium tartrate]] used in his treatment prevented his stomach from expelling these compounds and that his thirst was a symptom of the poison. Their hypothesis was that the [[calomel]] given to Napoleon became an overdose, which killed him and left extensive [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] damage behind.<ref name=Cullen /> According to a 2007 article, the type of arsenic found in Napoleon's hair shafts was mineral, the most toxic, and according to toxicologist Patrick Kintz, this supported the conclusion that he was murdered.<ref name=cullen156>Cullen 2008, p. 156</ref>\n\nThere have been modern studies that have supported the original autopsy finding.<ref name=cullen156 /> In a 2008 study, researchers analysed samples of Napoleon's hair from throughout his life, as well as samples from his family and other contemporaries. All samples had high levels of arsenic, approximately 100 times higher than the current average. According to these researchers, Napoleon's body was already heavily contaminated with arsenic as a boy, and the high arsenic concentration in his hair was not caused by intentional poisoning; people were constantly exposed to arsenic from glues and dyes throughout their lives.{{Efn|The body can tolerate large doses of arsenic if ingested regularly, and arsenic was a fashionable [[Panacea (medicine)|cure-all]].<ref>Cullen 2008, p. 50</ref>}} Studies published in 2007 and 2008 dismissed evidence of arsenic poisoning, and confirmed evidence of [[peptic ulcer]] and [[gastric cancer]] as the cause of death.<ref>Cullen 2008, p. 161, and Hindmarsh et al. 2008, p. 2092</ref>\n\n== Religion ==\n{{Further|Napoleon and the Catholic Church}}\n[[File:France dioceses 1801.svg|thumb|right|Reorganisation of the religious geography: France is divided into 59 [[diocese]]s and 10 [[ecclesiastical provinces]].]]\n\nNapoleon was baptised in [[Ajaccio]] on 21 July 1771.

Napoleon reorganised what had been the Holy Roman Empire, made up of more than a thousand entities, {{Quantify|date=August 2016}} into a more streamlined forty-state [[Confederation of the Rhine]]; this helped promote the [[German Confederation]] and the [[unification of Germany]] in 1871.<ref>Scheck 2008, Chapter: The Road to National Unification</ref>\n\nThe movement toward national unification in Italy was similarly precipitated by Napoleonic rule.<ref>Astarita 2005, p. 264</ref> These changes contributed to the development of nationalism and the [[nation state]].<ref>Alter 2006, pp. 61\u201376</ref>\n\nNapoleon implemented a wide array of liberal reforms in France and across Continental Europe, especially in Italy and Germany, as summarized by British historian [[Andrew Roberts (historian)|Andrew Roberts]]:\n\n{{quote|The ideas that underpin our modern world\u2014meritocracy, equality before the law, property rights, religious toleration, modern secular education, sound finances, and so on\u2014were championed, consolidated, codified and geographically extended by Napoleon.

The increased importance of artillery after 1807 stemmed from his creation of a highly mobile artillery force, the growth in artillery numbers, and changes in artillery practices. As a result of these factors, Napoleon, rather than relying on infantry to wear away the enemy's defences, now could use massed artillery as a spearhead to pound a break in the enemy's line that was then exploited by supporting infantry and cavalry. McConachy rejects the alternative theory that growing reliance on artillery by the French army beginning in 1807 was an outgrowth of the declining quality of the French infantry and, later, France's inferiority in cavalry numbers.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.reenactor.ru/ARH/PDF/McConachy.pdf |url-status=live |jstor=2677528 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119131512/http://www.reenactor.ru/ARH/PDF/McConachy.pdf |archive-date=19 January 2012|title=The Roots of Artillery Doctrine: Napoleonic Artillery Tactics Reconsidered |journal=The Journal of Military History |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=617\u2013640 |last1=McConachy |first1=Bruce |year=2001 |doi=10.2307/2677528 }}</ref> Weapons and other kinds of military technology remained static through the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, but 18th-century [[operational mobility]] underwent change.<ref>Archer et al. 2002, p. 383</ref>\n\nNapoleon's biggest influence was in the conduct of warfare.

Invasions of enemy territory occurred over broader fronts which made wars costlier and more decisive. The political effect of war increased; defeat for a European power meant more than the loss of isolated enclaves.
