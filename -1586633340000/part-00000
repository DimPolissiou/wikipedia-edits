Harsh reparations exacted by the Prussians after the war resulted in the loss of the French regions of [[Alsace]] (keeping the [[Territoire de Belfort]]) and [[Lorraine]] (the northeastern part, i.e. present-day [[Moselle (department)|department of Moselle]]), social upheaval, and the establishment of the [[Paris Commune]].  The early governments of the Third Republic considered re-establishing the monarchy, but disagreement as to the nature of that monarchy and the rightful occupant of the throne could not be resolved. Consequently, the Third Republic, originally envisioned as a [[provisional government]], instead became the permanent form of government of France.\n\nThe [[French Constitutional Laws of 1875]] defined the composition of the Third Republic. It consisted of a [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|Chamber of Deputies]] and a [[Senate of France|Senate]] to form the legislative branch of government and a [[List of Presidents of France#French Third Republic (1870\u20131940)|president]] to serve as head of state.  Calls for the re-establishment of the monarchy dominated the tenures of the first two presidents, [[Adolphe Thiers]] and [[Patrice de MacMahon]], but growing support for the republican form of government among the French populace and a series of republican presidents in the 1880s gradually quashed prospects of a monarchical restoration.\n\nThe Third Republic established many [[French colonial empire|French colonial possessions]], including  [[French Indochina]], [[French Madagascar]], [[French Polynesia]], and large territories in [[French West Africa|West Africa]] during the [[Scramble for Africa]], all of them acquired during the last two decades of the 19th century.  The early years of the 20th century were dominated by the [[Democratic Republican Alliance]], which was originally conceived as a [[centre-left]] political alliance, but over time became the main [[centre-right]] party.  The period from the start of [[World War I]] to the late 1930s featured sharply polarized politics, between the Democratic Republican Alliance and the [[Radical Party (France)|Radicals]].  The government fell less than a year after the outbreak of World War II, when German forces [[occupied France|occupied much of France]], and was replaced by the rival governments of [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s [[Free France]] (''La France libre'') and [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]]'s [[Vichy France]] (''L'\u00c9tat fran\u00e7ais'').\n\n[[Adolphe Thiers]] called republicanism in the 1870s \"the form of government that divides France least\"; however, politics under the Third Republic were sharply polarized. On the left stood Reformist France, heir to the [[French Revolution]]. On the right stood conservative France, rooted in the peasantry, the Roman Catholic Church and the army.<ref>{{cite book |first=Maurice |last=Larkin |authorlink=Maurice Larkin |title=Religion, Politics and Preferment in France since 1890: La Belle Epoque and its Legacy |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-521-52270-0 |page=3 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=7rPaeTm4lm4C |page=3 }} }}</ref> In spite of France's sharply divided electorate and persistent attempts to overthrow it, the Third Republic endured for seventy years, which as of 2020 makes it the longest lasting system of government in France since the collapse of the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'' in 1789.\n\n==Politics==\n{{main|Franco-Prussian War}}\n[[File:Maurice Neumont, War is the National Industry of Prussia, 1917, Cornell CUL PJM 1185 01.jpg|thumb|A French propaganda poster from 1917 is captioned with an 18th-century quote: \"Even in 1788, Mirabeau was saying that War is the National Industry of Prussia.\"]]\nThe [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870\u20131871 resulted in the defeat of France and the overthrow of Emperor [[Napoleon III]] and his [[Second French Empire]]. After Napoleon's capture by the Prussians at the [[Battle of Sedan]] (1 September 1870), Parisian deputies led by L\u00e9on Gambetta established the [[Government of National Defence]] as a provisional government on 4 September 1870. The deputies then selected General [[Louis-Jules Trochu]] to serve as its president. This first government of the Third Republic ruled during the [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)|Siege of Paris]] (19 September 1870 \u2013 28 January 1871). As Paris was cut off from the rest of unoccupied France, the Minister of War, [[L\u00e9on Gambetta]], who succeeded in leaving Paris in a hot air balloon, established the headquarters of the provisional republican government in the city of [[Tours]] on the Loire river.\n\nAfter the French surrender in January 1871, the provisional Government of National Defence disbanded, and national elections were called with the aim of creating a new French government. [[Franco-Prussian War#Prussian reaction and withdrawal|French territories occupied by Prussia]] at this time did not participate. The resulting conservative National Assembly elected [[Adolphe Thiers]] as head of a provisional government, nominally (\"head of the executive branch of the Republic pending a decision on the institutions of France\"). Due to the revolutionary and left-wing political climate that prevailed in the Parisian population, the right-wing government chose the royal palace of [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]] as its headquarters.\n\nThe new government negotiated a peace settlement with the newly proclaimed [[German Empire]]: the [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]] signed on 10 May 1871. To prompt the Prussians to leave France, the government passed a variety of financial laws, such as the controversial ''Law of Maturities'', to pay reparations. In Paris, resentment against the government built and from late March \u2013 May 1871, Paris workers and [[National Guard (France)|National Guards]] revolted and established the [[Paris Commune]], which maintained a radical left-wing regime for two months until its bloody suppression by the Thiers government in May 1871. The following repression of the {{lang|fr|[[communards]]}} would have disastrous consequences for the [[labour movement]].\n\n===Parliamentary monarchy===\n[[File:France Chambre des deputes 1871.png|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Composition of the national Assembly \u2013 1871]]\n[[February 1871 French legislative election|The French legislative election of 1871]], held in the aftermath of the collapse of the regime of Napoleon III, resulted in a monarchist majority in the French National Assembly that was favourable to making a peace agreement with Prussia. The \"[[Legitimists]]\" in the National Assembly supported the candidacy of a descendant of King [[Charles X of France|Charles X]], the last monarch from the senior line of the [[Bourbon Dynasty]], to assume the French throne: his grandson [[Henri, Comte de Chambord]], alias \"Henry V.\" The [[Orl\u00e9anist]]s supported a descendant of King [[Louis Philippe I]], the cousin of Charles X who replaced him as the French monarch in 1830: his grandson [[Louis-Philippe, Comte de Paris]]. The [[Bonapartists]] were marginalized due to the defeat of Napol\u00e9on III and were unable to advance the candidacy of any member of his family, the [[Bonaparte family]]. Legitimists and Orl\u00e9anists came to a compromise, eventually, whereby the childless Comte de Chambord would be recognised as king, with the Comte de Paris recognised as his heir. Consequently, in 1871 the throne was offered to the Comte de Chambord.<ref>D.W. Brogan, ''France Under the Republic: The Development of Modern France (1870-1939)'' (1940) pp 77-105.</ref>\n\nChambord believed the restored monarchy had to eliminate all traces of the Revolution (including most famously the [[Flag of France|Tricolor flag]]) in order to restore the unity between the monarchy and the nation, which the revolution had sundered apart. Compromise on this was impossible if the nation were to be made whole again.  The general population, however, was unwilling to abandon the Tricolor flag. Monarchists therefore resigned themselves to wait for the death of the aging, childless Chambord, when the throne could be offered to his more liberal heir, the Comte de Paris. A \"temporary\" republican government was therefore established. Chambord lived on until 1883, but by that time, enthusiasm for a monarchy had faded, and as a result the Comte de Paris was never offered the French throne.<ref>Steven D. Kale, \"The Monarchy According to the King: The Ideological Content of the 'Drapeau Blanc,' 1871-1873.\" ''French History'' (1988) 2#4 pp 399-426.</ref>\n\n===''Ordre Moral'' government===\n{{further|16 May 1877 crisis}}\n[[File:La Basilica del sagrado Coraz\u00f3n de Montmartre.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, Paris|Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur Basilica]] was built as a symbol of the ''Ordre Moral''.]]\n\nFollowing the French surrender to Prussia in January 1871, concluding the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the transitional [[Government of National Defense]] established a new seat of government at [[Versailles]] due to the encirclement of Paris by Prussian forces. New representatives were elected in February of that year, constituting the government which would come to evolve into the Third Republic. These representatives - predominantly conservative republicans - enacted a series of legislation which prompted resistance and outcry from radical and leftist elements of the republican movement. In Paris, a series of public altercations broke out between the Versailles-aligned Parisian government and the city's radical socialists. The radicals ultimately rejected the authority of Versailles, responding with the foundation of the [[Paris Commune]] in March.\n\nThe principles underpinning the Commune were viewed as morally degenerate by French conservatives at large while the government at Versailles sought to maintain the tenuous post-war stability which it had established. In May, the regular [[French Armed Forces]], under the command of [[Patrice de MacMahon]] and the Versailles government, marched on Paris and succeeded in dismantling the Commune during would become known as [[Paris Commune#\"Bloody Week\"|The Bloody Week]]. The term '''''ordre moral''''' (\"moral order\") subsequently came to be applied to the budding Third Republic due to the perceived restoration of conservative policies and values following the suppression of the Commune.<ref>D.W. Brogan, ''France Under the Republic: The Development of Modern France (1870-1939)'' (1940) pp 106-13.</ref>\n\nDe MacMahon, his popularity having been bolstered by his response to the Commune, was later elected [[President of France|President of the Republic]] in May 1873 and would hold the office until January 1879. A staunch [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] conservative with [[Legitimists|Legitimist]] sympathies and a noted mistrust of secularists, de MacMahon grew to be increasingly at odds with the French parliament as liberal and secular republicans gained legislative majority during his presidency.\n\nIn February 1875, a series of parliamentary acts established the [[French Constitutional Laws of 1875|constitutional laws of the new republic]]. At its head was a President of the Republic. A two-chamber parliament consisting of a directly-elected [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|Chamber of Deputies]] and an indirectly-elected [[Senate of France|Senate]] was created, along with a ministry under the President of the Council ([[prime minister]]), who was nominally answerable to both the President of the Republic and the legislature. Throughout the 1870s, the issue of whether a monarchy should replace or oversee the republic dominated public debate.\n\n[[File:1887 Bettanier Der Schwarze Fleck anagoria.JPG|thumb|right|In France, schoolchildren were taught not to forget the lost regions of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], which were coloured in black on maps.]]\nThe elections of 1876 demonstrated a high degree of public support for the increasingly anti-monarchist direction of the republican movement. A decisive Republican majority was elected to the Chamber of Deputies while the monarchist majority in the Senate was maintained by only one seat. President de MacMahon responded in May 1877, attempting to quell the Republicans' rising popularity and limit their political influence through a series of actions which would become known in France as [[16 May 1877 crisis|''le seize Mai'']].\n\nOn 16 May 1877, de MacMahon forced the resignation of [[Moderate Republicans (France)|Moderate Republican]] prime minister [[Jules Simon]] and appointed the [[Orl\u00e9anist]] [[Albert, duc de Broglie|Albert de Broglie]] to the office. When the Chamber of Deputies expressed outrage at the appointment, believing the transition of authority to be illegitimate and refusing to cooperate with either de MacMahon or de Broglie, de MacMahon dissolved the Chamber and called for a new general election to be held the following October. De MacMahon was subsequently accused by Republicans and republican sympathizers of attempting to stage a constitutional coup d'\u00e9tat, a claim which he publicly denied.\n\nThe October elections again brought a Republican majority to the Chamber of Deputies, further affirming public opinion. The Republicans would go on to gain a majority in the Senate by January 1879, establishing dominance in both houses and effectively ending the potential for a monarchist restoration. De MacMahon himself resigned on 30 January 1879 to be succeeded by the [[Opportunist Republicans|moderate]] [[Jules Gr\u00e9vy]].<ref>Brogan, ''France Under the Republic: The Development of Modern France (1870-1939)'' (1940) pp 127-43.</ref>\n\n===Opportunist Republicans===\n{{further|Opportunist Republicans}}\n\nFollowing the 16 May crisis in 1877, [[Legitimist]]s were pushed out of power, and the Republic was finally governed by republicans referred to as [[Opportunist Republicans]] for their support of moderate social and political changes in order to establish the new regime firmly. The [[Jules Ferry laws]] that made [[public education]] free, mandatory, and secular (''[[la\u00efcit\u00e9|la\u0457que]]''), were voted in 1881 and 1882, one of the first signs of the expanding civic powers of the Republic. From that time onward, public education was no longer under the exclusive control of the Catholic congregations.<ref>D.W. Brogan, ''France Under the Republic: The Development of Modern France (1870-1939)'' (1940) pp 144-79.</ref>\n\nTo discourage French monarchism as a serious political force, the [[French Crown Jewels]] were broken up and sold in 1885. Only a few crowns, their precious gems replaced by coloured glass, were kept.\n\n===Boulanger crisis===\n[[File:Georges_Ernest_Boulanger_by_Atelier_Nadar.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Georges Ernest Boulanger]], nicknamed G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Revanche]]\nIn 1889, the Republic was rocked by a sudden political crisis precipitated by General [[Georges Boulanger]]. An enormously popular general, he won a series of elections in which he would resign his seat in the Chamber of Deputies and run again in another district. At the apogee of his popularity in January 1889, he posed the threat of a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] and the establishment of a dictatorship. With his base of support in the working districts of Paris and other cities, plus rural traditionalist Catholics and royalists, he promoted an aggressive nationalism aimed against Germany.  The elections of September 1889 marked a decisive defeat for the Boulangists.  They were defeated by the changes in the electoral laws that prevented Boulanger from running in multiple constituencies; by the government's aggressive opposition; and by the absence of the general himself, who placed himself in self-imposed exile to be with his mistress.  The fall of Boulanger severely undermined the political strength of the conservative and royalist elements within France; they would not recover their strength until 1940.<ref>Brogan, ''France Under the Republic: The Development of Modern France (1870-1939)'' (1940) pp 183-213.</ref>\n\nRevisionist scholars have argued that the Boulangist movement more often represented elements of the radical left rather than the extreme right. Their work is part of an emerging consensus that France's radical right was formed in part during the Dreyfus era by men who had been Boulangist partisans of the radical left a decade earlier.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Paul |last=Mazgaj |title=The Origins of the French Radical Right: A Historiographical Essay |journal=[[French Historical Studies]] |year=1987 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=287\u2013315 |jstor=286267 |doi=10.2307/286267 }}</ref>\n\n===Panama scandal===\n{{main|Panama scandals}}\nThe [[Panama scandals]] of 1892 involved the enormous cost of a failed attempt to build the [[Panama Canal]].

It is regarded as the largest monetary corruption scandal of the 19th century. Close to a billion francs were lost when the French government took bribes to keep quiet about the Panama Canal Company's financial troubles.<ref>David McCullough, ''The path between the seas: the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914'' (2001) pp 45-242.</ref>\n\n===The welfare state and public health===\n{{cns|The state had a smaller role in France than in Germany before the First World War.

Because it was so threatening to so many interests, the proposal was debated and postponed for 20 years before becoming law in 1902. Implementation finally came when the government realized that contagious diseases had a national security impact in weakening military recruits, and keeping the population growth rate well below Germany's.<ref>Ann-Louise Shapiro, \"Private Rights, Public Interest, and Professional Jurisdiction: The French Public Health Law of 1902.\" ''Bulletin of the History of Medicine'' 54.1 (1980): 4+</ref> Another theory put forth is that the low rate of French population growth, relative to Germany, was due to a lower French birth rate perhaps due to the provision under French Revolutionary law that land must be divided up among all the sons (or a large compensation paid) \u2014 this led peasants to not want more than one son.

He was sentenced to life imprisonment for communicating French military secrets to the German Embassy in Paris and sent to the penal colony at [[Devil's Island]] in [[French Guiana]] (nicknamed ''la guillotine s\u00e8che'', the dry guillotine), where he spent almost five years.\n\nTwo years later, evidence came to light that identified a French Army major named [[Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy]] as the real spy. After high-ranking military officials suppressed the new evidence, a military court unanimously acquitted Esterhazy. In response, the Army brought up additional charges against Dreyfus based on false documents. Word of the military court's attempts to frame Dreyfus began to spread, chiefly owing to the polemic ''[[J'accuse (letter)|J'accuse]]'', a vehement open letter published in a Paris newspaper in January 1898 by the notable writer [[\u00c9mile Zola]]. Activists put pressure on the government to re-open the case.\n\nIn 1899, Dreyfus was returned to France for another trial. The intense political and judicial scandal that ensued divided French society between those who supported Dreyfus (now called \"Dreyfusards\"), such as [[Anatole France]], [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] and [[Georges Clemenceau]], and those who condemned him (the anti-Dreyfusards), such as [[\u00c9douard Drumont]], the director and publisher of the anti-Semitic newspaper ''[[La Libre Parole]]''. The new trial resulted in another conviction and a 10-year sentence, but Dreyfus was given a pardon and set free. Eventually all the accusations against him were demonstrated to be baseless, and in 1906, Dreyfus was exonerated and re-instated as a major in the French Army.\n\nFrom 1894 to 1906, the scandal divided France deeply and lastingly into two opposing camps: the pro-Army \"anti-Dreyfusards\" composed of conservatives, Catholic traditionalists and monarchists who generally lost the initiative to the anti-clerical, pro-republican \"Dreyfusards\", with strong support from intellectuals and teachers. It embittered French politics and facilitated the increasing influence of radical politicians on both sides of the political spectrum.\n\n==Social history==\n{{main|Belle \u00c9poque}}\n\n===Newspapers===\nThe democratic political structure was supported by the proliferation of politicized newspapers. The circulation of the daily press in Paris went from 1 million in 1870 to 5 million in 1910; it later reached 6 million in 1939.  Advertising grew rapidly, providing a steady financial basis for publishing, but it did not cover all of the costs involved and had to be supplemented by secret subsidies from commercial interests that wanted favourable reporting.  A new liberal press law of 1881 abandoned the restrictive practices that had been typical for a century. [[R. Hoe & Company|High-speed rotary Hoe presses]], introduced in the 1860s, facilitated quick turnaround time and cheaper publication.  New types of popular newspapers, especially ''[[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]'', reached an audience more interested in diverse entertainment and gossip than hard news.  It captured a quarter of the Parisian market and forced the rest to lower their prices.  The main dailies employed their own journalists who competed for news flashes. All newspapers relied upon the Agence Havas (now [[Agence France-Presse]]), a telegraphic news service with a network of reporters and contracts with [[Reuters]] to provide world service.

They also took payments for favourable notices in news articles of commercial products. Sometimes, a newspaper would blackmail a business by threatening to publish unfavorable information unless the business immediately started advertising in the paper. Foreign governments, especially Russia and Turkey, secretly paid the press hundreds of thousands of francs a year to guarantee favourable coverage of the bonds it was selling in Paris. When the real news was bad about Russia, as during its 1905 Revolution or during its war with Japan, it raised the ante to millions.  During the World War, newspapers became more of a propaganda agency on behalf of the war effort and avoided critical commentary.  They seldom reported the achievements of the Allies, crediting all the good news to the French army.  In a sentence, the newspapers were not independent champions of the truth, but secretly paid advertisements for banking.<ref>See {{cite book |first=Theodore |last=Zeldin |authorlink=Theodore Zeldin |title=France: 1848\u20131945 |year=1977 |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn=978-0-19-822125-8 |chapter=Newspapers and corruption |pages=492\u2013573 }} Also, pp 522\u201324 on foreign subsidies.</ref>\n\nThe World War ended a golden era for the press. Their younger staff members were drafted, and male replacements could not be found (female journalists were not considered suitable.) Rail transportation was rationed and less paper and ink came in, and fewer copies could be shipped out. Inflation raised the price of newsprint, which was always in short supply. The cover price went up, circulation fell and many of the 242 dailies published outside Paris closed down. The government set up the Interministerial Press Commission to supervise the press closely. A separate agency imposed tight censorship that led to blank spaces where news reports or editorials were disallowed. The dailies sometimes were limited to only two pages instead of the usual four, leading one satirical paper to try to report the war news in the same spirit:\n: War News.

However the Parisian newspapers were largely stagnant after the war. The major postwar success story was [[Paris-Soir|''Paris Soir'']], which lacked any political agenda and was dedicated to providing a mix of sensational reporting to aid circulation and serious articles to build prestige.  By 1939, its circulation was over 1.7 million, double that of its nearest rival the tabloid ''[[Le Petit Parisien]]''. In addition to its daily paper, ''Paris Soir'' sponsored a highly successful women's magazine [[Marie Claire|''Marie-Claire'']].

The French clergy and bishops were closely associated with the monarchists and many of its hierarchy were from noble families. Republicans were based in the [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] middle class, who saw the Church's alliance with the monarchists as a political threat to republicanism, and a threat to the modern spirit of progress. The republicans detested the Church for its political and class affiliations; for them, the Church represented the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]], a time in French history most republicans hoped was long behind them.  The republicans were strengthened by Protestant and Jewish support.  Numerous laws were passed to weaken the Catholic Church. In 1879, priests were excluded from the administrative committees of hospitals and boards of charity; in 1880, new measures were directed against the religious congregations; from 1880 to 1890 came the substitution of lay women for nuns in many hospitals; in 1882, the [[Jules Ferry laws|Ferry school laws]] were passed.

Religious instruction in all schools was forbidden, and religious orders were forbidden to teach in them. Funds were appropriated from religious schools to build more state schools.

The Liberal Action was founded in 1901 by [[Jacques Piou]] and [[Albert de Mun]], former monarchists who switched to republicanism at the request of Pope [[Leo XIII]].

Membership was open to everyone, not just Catholics. It sought to gather all the \"honest people\" and to be the melting pot sought by Leo XIII where Catholics and moderate Republicans would unite to support a policy of tolerance and social progress. Its motto summarized its program: \"Liberty for all; equality before the law; better conditions for the workers.\" However, the \"old republicans\" were few, and it did not manage to regroup all Catholics, as it was shunned by monarchists, Christian democrats, and [[Integrist]]s. In the end, it recruited mostly among the liberal-Catholics ([[Jacques Piou]]) and the Social Catholics ([[Albert de Mun]]).  The ALP was drawn into battle from its very beginnings (its first steps coincided with the beginning of the Combes ministry and its anticlerical combat policy), as religious matters were at the heart of its preoccupations. It defended the Church in the name of liberty and common law. Fiercely fought by the ''[[Action fran\u00e7aise]]'', the movement declined from 1908, when it lost the support of Rome.

Alsace and Lorraine were a grievance for some years, but by 1890 had largely faded away with the French realization that nostalgia was not as useful as modernization. France rebuilt its Army, emphasizing modernization in such features as new artillery, and after 1905 invested heavily in military aircraft. Most important in restoring prestige was a strong emphasis on the growing French Empire, which brought prestige, despite large financial costs.  Very few French families settled in the colonies, and they were too poor in natural resources and trade to significantly benefit the overall economy. Nevertheless, they were second in size only to the British Empire, provided prestige in world affairs, and gave an opportunity for Catholics (under heavy attack by the Republicans in Parliament) to devote their energies to spread French culture and civilization worldwide.  An extremely expensive investment in building the Panama Canal was a total failure, in terms of money, many deaths by disease, and political scandal.<ref>Jean-Marie Mayeur and Madeleine Reb\u00e9rioux, ''The Third Republic from its Origins to the Great War, 1871\u20131914'' (1984), pp 155-61, 168-69, 272-78.</ref>  Bismarck was fired in 1890, and after that German foreign policy was confused and misdirected. For example, Berlin broke its close ties with St. Petersburg, allowing the French to enter through heavy financial investment, and a Paris-St Petersburg military alliance that proved essential and durable. Germany feuded with Britain, which encouraged London and Paris to drop their grievances over Egypt and Africa, reaching a compromise whereby the French recognized British primacy in Egypt, while Britain recognized French primacy in Morocco.  This enabled Britain and France to move closer together, finally achieving an informal military relationship after 1904.<ref>Jeremy D.

Permanent professional diplomats and bureaucrats had developed their own  traditions of how to operate  at the [[Quai d'Orsay]] (where the Foreign Ministry was located), and their style  changed little from generation to generation.<ref>J.F.V. Keiger, ''France and the World since 1870'' (2001) pp 25 \u2013 47.</ref>  Most of the diplomats came from high status aristocratic families.  Although France was one of the few republics in Europe, its diplomats mingled smoothly with the aristocratic representatives at the royal courts.  Prime ministers and leading politicians generally paid little attention to foreign affairs, allowing a handful of senior men to control policy.  In the decades before the First World War they dominated the embassies in the 10 major countries where France had an ambassador (elsewhere, they sent lower-ranking ministers).  They included [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]], the foreign minister from 1898 to 1905; [[Paul Cambon]], in London, 1890-1920; [[Jean Jules Jusserand|Jules Jusserand]], in Washington from 1902 to 1924; and Camille Barr\u00e8re, in Rome from 1897 to 1924.  In terms of foreign policy, there was general agreement about the need for high protective tariffs, which kept agricultural prices high.  After the defeat by the Germans, there was a strong widespread anti-German sentiment focused on revanchism and regaining Alsace and Lorraine.  The Empire was a matter of great pride, and service as administrators, soldiers and missionaries was a high status occupation.<ref>Felix Gilbert, David Clay Large, ''The End of the European Era: 1890 to the Present'' (2002) p 64-65.</ref>\nFrench foreign policy from 1871 to 1914 showed a dramatic transformation from a humiliated power with no friends and not much of an empire in 1871, to the centerpiece of the European alliance system in 1914, with a flourishing colonial empire that was second in size only to Great Britain. Although religion was a hotly contested matter in domestic politics, the Catholic Church made missionary work and church building a specialty in the colonies. Most Frenchmen ignored foreign policy; its issues were a low priority in politics.<ref>Gordon Wright, ''France in Modern Times'' (5th ed 1995) pp 288-99.</ref><ref>Martin S. Alexander and J. F. V.

The most dangerous episode was the [[Fashoda Incident]] of 1898 when French troops tried to claim an area in the Southern Sudan, and a British force purporting to be acting in the interests of the [[Khedive of Egypt]] arrived. Under heavy pressure the French withdrew, securing Anglo-Egyptian control over the area. The status quo was recognised by an agreement between the two states acknowledging British control over Egypt, while France became the dominant power in [[Morocco]], but France suffered a humiliating defeat overall.<ref>D.W.

Taylor, ''The Struggle for Mastery in Europe, 1848-1918'' (1954) pp 286-92</ref>\n\nFrance had colonies in Asia and looked for alliances and found in Japan a possible ally. At Japan's request Paris sent military missions in [[French military mission to Japan (1872\u201380)|1872\u20131880]], in [[French military mission to Japan (1884\u201389)|1884\u20131889]] and in [[French military mission to Japan (1918\u201319)|1918\u20131919]] to help modernize the Japanese army. Conflicts with China over Indochina climaxed during the [[Sino-French War]] (1884\u20131885). [[Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Courbet|Admiral Courbet]] destroyed the Chinese fleet anchored at [[Battle of Foochow|Foochow]].

France secured an alliance with the [[Russian Empire]] in 1894 after diplomatic talks between Germany and Russia had failed to produce any working agreement. The [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] served as the cornerstone of French foreign policy until 1917. A further link with Russia was provided by vast French investments and loans before 1914. In 1904, French foreign minister [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]] negotiated the ''[[Entente Cordiale]]'' with [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]], the British Foreign Secretary, an agreement that ended a long period of Anglo-French tensions and hostility. The ''Entente Cordiale'', which functioned as an informal Anglo-French alliance, was further strengthened by the [[First Moroccan Crisis|First]] and [[Agadir Crisis|Second Moroccan crises]] of 1905 and 1911, and by secret military and naval staff talks. Delcass\u00e9's rapprochement with Britain was controversial in France as [[Anglophobia]] was prominent around the start of the 20th century, sentiments that had been much reinforced by the [[Fashoda Incident]] of 1898, in which Britain and France had almost gone to war, and by the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], in which French public opinion was very much on the side of Britain's enemies.<ref>T.

In Algeria, land held by rich [[settler]]s rose from 1,600,000 hectares in 1890 to 2,700,000 hectares in 1940; combined with similar operations in Morocco and Tunisia, the result was that North African agriculture became one of the most efficient in the world. Metropolitan France was a captive market, so large landowners could borrow large sums in Paris to modernize agricultural techniques with tractors and mechanized equipment. The result was a dramatic increase in the export of wheat, corn, peaches, and olive oil.

Nevertheless, by 1918 France was producing more munitions and artillery than its allies, while supplying virtually all of the heavy equipment needed by the arriving American army. (The Americans left their heavy weapons at home in order to use the available transports to send as many soldiers as possible.) Building on foundations laid in the early months of the war, the Ministry of War matched production to the operational and tactical needs of the army, with an emphasis on meeting the insatiable demands for artillery.

The Bloc was supported by business and finance and was friendly toward the army and the Church.

The horrible devastation of the war, including the death of 1.5&nbsp;million French soldiers, the devastation of much of the steel and coal regions, and the long-term costs for veterans, were always remembered. France demanded that Germany assume many of the costs incurred from the war through annual reparation payments. French foreign and security policy used the balance of power and alliance politics to compel Germany to comply with its obligations under the Treaty of Versailles.  the problem was that the United States and Britain rejected a defensive alliance. Potential allies in Eastern Europe, such as Poland,  Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia were too weak to confront Germany. Russia had been the long term  French ally in the East, but now it was controlled by deeply distrusted in Paris.  France's transition to a more conciliatory policy in 1924 was a response to pressure from Britain and the United States, as well as to French weakness.<ref>Jacques N\u00e9r\u00e9, ''The foreign policy of France from 1914 to 1945'' (1975)  pp 11-99.</ref>\n\nFrance enthusiastically joined the [[League of Nations]] in 1919, but felt betrayed by President [[Woodrow Wilson]], when his promises that the United States would sign a defence treaty with France and join the League were [[league of Nations#Global representation|rejected by the United States Congress]]. The main goal of French foreign policy was to preserve French power and neutralize the threat posed by Germany. When Germany fell behind in reparations payments in 1923, France [[occupation of Ruhr|seized the industrialized Ruhr region]]. The British Labour Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]], who viewed reparations as impossible to pay successfully, pressured French Premier [[\u00c9douard Herriot]] into a series of concessions to Germany. In total, France received \u00a31600&nbsp;million from Germany before reparations ended in 1932, but France had to pay war debts to the United States, and thus the net gain was only about \u00a3600&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite book |first=Maurice |last=Larkin |title=France since the Popular Front: Government and People, 1936\u20131986 |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1988 |isbn=978-0-19-873034-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/francesincepopul0000lark/page/9 9] |url=https://archive.org/details/francesincepopul0000lark/page/9 }}</ref>\n\nFrance tried to create a web of defensive treaties against Germany with Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. There was little effort to build up the military strength or technological capabilities of these small allies, and they remained weak and divided among themselves.

In 1936, the Socialists and the Radicals formed a coalition, with Communist support, to complete it.<ref>{{cite book |first=Julian |last=Jackson |title=The Popular Front in France: Defending Democracy, 1934\u201338 |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-521-31252-3 }}</ref>\n\nThe Popular Front's narrow victory in the [[1936 French legislative election|elections of the spring of 1936]] brought to power a government headed by the Socialists in alliance with the Radicals.  The Communists supported its domestic policies, but did not take any seats in the cabinet.  The prime minister was L\u00e9on Blum, a technocratic socialist who avoided making decisions. In two years in office, it focused on labour law changes sought by the trade unions, especially the mandatory [[40-hour work week]], down from 48 hours. All workers were given a two-week [[paid vacation]]. A [[collective bargaining]] law facilitated union growth; membership soared from 1,000,000 to 5,000,000 in one year, and workers' political strength was enhanced when the Communist and non-Communist unions joined together. The government [[Nationalization#France|nationalized]] the armaments industry and tried to seize control of the [[Bank of France]] in an effort to break the power of the richest 200 families in the country. Farmers received higher prices, and the government purchased surplus wheat, but farmers had to pay higher taxes. Wave after wave of strikes hit French industry in 1936. Wage rates went up 48%, but the work week was cut back by 17%, and the cost of living rose 46%, so there was little real gain to the average worker. The higher prices for French products resulted in a decline in overseas sales, which the government tried to neutralize by [[devaluation|devaluing]] the franc, a measure that led to a reduction in the value of bonds and savings accounts.

France lost Alsace and most of Lorraine, and had to pay a cash indemnity to the new nation of Germany.\n* 1871: The [[Paris Commune]]. In a formal sense the Paris Commune of 1871 was simply the local authority that exercised power in Paris for two months in the spring of 1871. It was separate from that of the new government under [[Adolphe Thiers]]. The regime came to an end after a bloody suppression by Thiers's government in May 1871.\n* 1872\u201373: After the nation faced the immediate political problems, it needed to establish a permanent form of government. Thiers wanted to base it on the constitutional monarchy of Britain, however he realized France would have to remain republican. In expressing this belief, he violated the Pact of Bordeaux, angering the Monarchists in the Assembly. As a result, he was forced to resign in 1873.\n* 1873: Marshal MacMahon, a conservative Roman Catholic, was made President of the Republic. The Duc de Broglie, an Orleanist, as the prime minister. Unintentionally, the Monarchists had replaced an absolute monarchy by a parliamentary one.\n* Feb 1875: Series of parliamentary Acts established the organic or constitutional laws of the new republic. At its apex was a President of the Republic. A two-chamber parliament was created, along with a ministry under the ''President of the Council'', who was nominally answerable to both the President of the Republic and Parliament.\n* May 1877: with public opinion swinging heavily in favour of a republic, the President of the Republic, [[Patrice MacMahon]], himself a monarchist, made one last desperate attempt to salvage the monarchical cause by dismissing the republic-minded Prime Minister Jules Simon and reappointing the monarchist leader the Duc de Broglie to office. He then dissolved parliament and called a general election. If his hope had been to halt the move towards republicanism, it backfired spectacularly, with the President being accused of having staged a constitutional coup d'\u00e9tat, known as {{lang|fr|le seize Mai}} after the date when it happened.\n* 1879: Republicans returned triumphant, finally killing off the prospect of a restored French monarchy by gaining control of the Senate on 5 January 1879. MacMahon himself resigned on 30 January 1879, leaving a seriously weakened presidency in the shape of Jules Gr\u00e9vy.\n* 1880: The Jesuits and several other religious orders were dissolved, and their members were forbidden to teach in state schools.\n* 1881: Following the 16 May crisis in 1877, Legitimists were pushed out of power, and the Republic was finally governed by republicans, called Opportunist Republicans as they were in favour of moderate changes to firmly establish the new regime. The Jules Ferry laws on free, mandatory and secular public education, voted in 1881 and 1882, were one of the first sign of this republican control of the Republic, as public education was not any more in the exclusive control of the Catholic congregations.\n* 1882: Religious instruction was removed from all state schools. The measures were accompanied by the abolition of chaplains in the armed forces and the removal of nuns from hospitals. Due to the fact that France was mainly Roman Catholic, this was greatly opposed.\n* 1889: The Republic was rocked by the sudden but short-timed Boulanger crisis spawning the rise of the modern intellectual [[\u00c9mile Zola]]. Later, the Panama scandals also were quickly criticized by the press.\n* 1893: Following anarchist [[Auguste Vaillant]]'s bombing at the National Assembly, killing nobody but injuring one, deputies voted the {{lang|fr|lois sc\u00e9l\u00e9rates}} which limited the [[Law on the Freedom of the Press of 29 July 1881|1881 freedom of the press laws]]. The following year, President [[Marie Fran\u00e7ois Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] was stabbed to death by Italian anarchist Caserio.\n* 1894: The [[Dreyfus Affair]]: a Jewish artillery officer, [[Alfred Dreyfus]], was arrested on charges relating to conspiracy and espionage. Allegedly, Dreyfus had handed over important military documents discussing the designs of a new French artillery piece to a German military attach\u00e9 named [[Maximilian von Schwartzkoppen|Max von Schwartzkoppen]].\n* 1894: The [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] was formed.\n* 1898: Writer \u00c9mile Zola published an article entitled {{lang|fr|J'Accuse...!}} The article alleged an anti-Semitic conspiracy in the highest ranks of the military to scapegoat Dreyfus, tacitly supported by the government and the Catholic Church. The [[Fashoda Incident]] nearly causes an Anglo-French war.\n* 1901: The Radical-Socialist Party is founded and remained the most important party of the Third Republic starting at the end of the 19th century. The same year, followers of [[L\u00e9on Gambetta]], such as [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]], who became President of the Council in the 1920s, created the Democratic Republican Alliance (ARD), which became the main center-right party after World War I and the parliamentary disappearance of monarchists and Bonapartists.\n* 1904: French foreign minister [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]] negotiated with Lord Lansdowne, the British Foreign Secretary, the {{lang|fr|[[Entente Cordiale]]}} in 1904.\n* 1905: The government introduced the law on the separation of Church and State, heavily supported by Emile Combes, who had been strictly enforcing the 1901 voluntary association law and the 1904 law on religious congregations' freedom of teaching (more than 2,500 private teaching establishments were by then closed by the state, causing bitter opposition from the Catholic and conservative population).\n* 1906: It became apparent that the documents handed over to Schwartzkoppen by Dreyfus in 1894 were a forgery and thus Dreyfus was pardoned after serving 12 years in prison.\n* 1914: After SFIO (French Section of the Workers' International) leader [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]]'s assassination a few days before the German invasion of Belgium, the French socialist movement, as the whole of the Second International, abandoned its antimilitarist positions and joined the national war effort.

Harsh reparations exacted by the Prussians after the war resulted in the loss of the French regions of [[Alsace]] (keeping the [[Territoire de Belfort]]) and [[Lorraine]] (the northeastern part, i.e. present-day [[Moselle (department)|department of Moselle]]), social upheaval, and the establishment of the [[Paris Commune]].  The early governments of the Third Republic considered re-establishing the monarchy, but disagreement as to the nature of that monarchy and the rightful occupant of the throne could not be resolved. Consequently, the Third Republic, originally envisioned as a [[provisional government]], instead became the permanent form of government of France.\n\nThe [[French Constitutional Laws of 1875]] defined the composition of the Third Republic. It consisted of a [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|Chamber of Deputies]] and a [[Senate of France|Senate]] to form the legislative branch of government and a [[List of Presidents of France#French Third Republic (1870\u20131940)|president]] to serve as head of state.  Calls for the re-establishment of the monarchy dominated the tenures of the first two presidents, [[Adolphe Thiers]] and [[Patrice de MacMahon]], but growing support for the republican form of government among the French populace and a series of republican presidents in the 1880s gradually quashed prospects of a monarchical restoration.\n\nThe Third Republic established many [[French colonial empire|French colonial possessions]], including  [[French Indochina]], [[French Madagascar]], [[French Polynesia]], and large territories in [[French West Africa|West Africa]] during the [[Scramble for Africa]], all of them acquired during the last two decades of the 19th century.  The early years of the 20th century were dominated by the [[Democratic Republican Alliance]], which was originally conceived as a [[centre-left]] political alliance, but over time became the main [[centre-right]] party.  The period from the start of [[World War I]] to the late 1930s featured sharply polarized politics, between the Democratic Republican Alliance and the [[Radical Party (France)|Radicals]].  The government fell less than a year after the outbreak of World War II, when German forces [[occupied France|occupied much of France]], and was replaced by the rival governments of [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s [[Free France]] (''La France libre'') and [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]]'s [[Vichy France]] (''L'\u00c9tat fran\u00e7ais'').\n\n[[Adolphe Thiers]] called republicanism in the 1870s \"the form of government that divides France least\"; however, politics under the Third Republic were sharply polarized. On the left stood Reformist France, heir to the [[French Revolution]]. On the right stood conservative France, rooted in the peasantry, the Roman Catholic Church and the army.<ref>{{cite book |first=Maurice |last=Larkin |authorlink=Maurice Larkin |title=Religion, Politics and Preferment in France since 1890: La Belle Epoque and its Legacy |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-521-52270-0 |page=3 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=7rPaeTm4lm4C |page=3 }} }}</ref> In spite of France's sharply divided electorate and persistent attempts to overthrow it, the Third Republic endured for seventy years, which as of 2020 makes it the longest lasting system of government in France since the collapse of the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'' in 1789.\n\n==Politics==\n{{main|Franco-Prussian War}}\n[[File:Maurice Neumont, War is the National Industry of Prussia, 1917, Cornell CUL PJM 1185 01.jpg|thumb|A French propaganda poster from 1917 is captioned with an 18th-century quote: \"Even in 1788, Mirabeau was saying that War is the National Industry of Prussia.\"]]\nThe [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870\u20131871 resulted in the defeat of France and the overthrow of Emperor [[Napoleon III]] and his [[Second French Empire]]. After Napoleon's capture by the Prussians at the [[Battle of Sedan]] (1 September 1870), Parisian deputies led by L\u00e9on Gambetta established the [[Government of National Defence]] as a provisional government on 4 September 1870. The deputies then selected General [[Louis-Jules Trochu]] to serve as its president. This first government of the Third Republic ruled during the [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)|Siege of Paris]] (19 September 1870 \u2013 28 January 1871). As Paris was cut off from the rest of unoccupied France, the Minister of War, [[L\u00e9on Gambetta]], who succeeded in leaving Paris in a hot air balloon, established the headquarters of the provisional republican government in the city of [[Tours]] on the Loire river.\n\nAfter the French surrender in January 1871, the provisional Government of National Defence disbanded, and national elections were called with the aim of creating a new French government. [[Franco-Prussian War#Prussian reaction and withdrawal|French territories occupied by Prussia]] at this time did not participate. The resulting conservative National Assembly elected [[Adolphe Thiers]] as head of a provisional government, nominally (\"head of the executive branch of the Republic pending a decision on the institutions of France\"). Due to the revolutionary and left-wing political climate that prevailed in the Parisian population, the right-wing government chose the royal palace of [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]] as its headquarters.\n\nThe new government negotiated a peace settlement with the newly proclaimed [[German Empire]]: the [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]] signed on 10 May 1871. To prompt the Prussians to leave France, the government passed a variety of financial laws, such as the controversial ''Law of Maturities'', to pay reparations. In Paris, resentment against the government built and from late March \u2013 May 1871, Paris workers and [[National Guard (France)|National Guards]] revolted and established the [[Paris Commune]], which maintained a radical left-wing regime for two months until its bloody suppression by the Thiers government in May 1871. The following repression of the {{lang|fr|[[communards]]}} would have disastrous consequences for the [[labour movement]].\n\n===Parliamentary monarchy===\n[[File:France Chambre des deputes 1871.png|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Composition of the national Assembly \u2013 1871]]\n[[February 1871 French legislative election|The French legislative election of 1871]], held in the aftermath of the collapse of the regime of Napoleon III, resulted in a monarchist majority in the French National Assembly that was favourable to making a peace agreement with Prussia. The \"[[Legitimists]]\" in the National Assembly supported the candidacy of a descendant of King [[Charles X of France|Charles X]], the last monarch from the senior line of the [[Bourbon Dynasty]], to assume the French throne: his grandson [[Henri, Comte de Chambord]], alias \"Henry V.\" The [[Orl\u00e9anist]]s supported a descendant of King [[Louis Philippe I]], the cousin of Charles X who replaced him as the French monarch in 1830: his grandson [[Louis-Philippe, Comte de Paris]]. The [[Bonapartists]] were marginalized due to the defeat of Napol\u00e9on III and were unable to advance the candidacy of any member of his family, the [[Bonaparte family]]. Legitimists and Orl\u00e9anists came to a compromise, eventually, whereby the childless Comte de Chambord would be recognised as king, with the Comte de Paris recognised as his heir. Consequently, in 1871 the throne was offered to the Comte de Chambord.<ref>D.W. Brogan, ''France Under the Republic: The Development of Modern France (1870-1939)'' (1940) pp 77-105.</ref>\n\nChambord believed the restored monarchy had to eliminate all traces of the Revolution (including most famously the [[Flag of France|Tricolor flag]]) in order to restore the unity between the monarchy and the nation, which the revolution had sundered apart. Compromise on this was impossible if the nation were to be made whole again.  The general population, however, was unwilling to abandon the Tricolor flag. Monarchists therefore resigned themselves to wait for the death of the aging, childless Chambord, when the throne could be offered to his more liberal heir, the Comte de Paris. A \"temporary\" republican government was therefore established. Chambord lived on until 1883, but by that time, enthusiasm for a monarchy had faded, and as a result the Comte de Paris was never offered the French throne.<ref>Steven D. Kale, \"The Monarchy According to the King: The Ideological Content of the 'Drapeau Blanc,' 1871-1873.\" ''French History'' (1988) 2#4 pp 399-426.</ref>\n\n===''Ordre Moral'' government===\n{{further|16 May 1877 crisis}}\n[[File:La Basilica del sagrado Coraz\u00f3n de Montmartre.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur, Paris|Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur Basilica]] was built as a symbol of the ''Ordre Moral''.]]\n\nFollowing the French surrender to Prussia in January 1871, concluding the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the transitional [[Government of National Defense]] established a new seat of government at [[Versailles]] due to the encirclement of Paris by Prussian forces. New representatives were elected in February of that year, constituting the government which would come to evolve into the Third Republic. These representatives - predominantly conservative republicans - enacted a series of legislation which prompted resistance and outcry from radical and leftist elements of the republican movement. In Paris, a series of public altercations broke out between the Versailles-aligned Parisian government and the city's radical socialists. The radicals ultimately rejected the authority of Versailles, responding with the foundation of the [[Paris Commune]] in March.\n\nThe principles underpinning the Commune were viewed as morally degenerate by French conservatives at large while the government at Versailles sought to maintain the tenuous post-war stability which it had established. In May, the regular [[French Armed Forces]], under the command of [[Patrice de MacMahon]] and the Versailles government, marched on Paris and succeeded in dismantling the Commune during would become known as [[Paris Commune#\"Bloody Week\"|The Bloody Week]]. The term '''''ordre moral''''' (\"moral order\") subsequently came to be applied to the budding Third Republic due to the perceived restoration of conservative policies and values following the suppression of the Commune.<ref>D.W. Brogan, ''France Under the Republic: The Development of Modern France (1870-1939)'' (1940) pp 106-13.</ref>\n\nDe MacMahon, his popularity having been bolstered by his response to the Commune, was later elected [[President of France|President of the Republic]] in May 1873 and would hold the office until January 1879. A staunch [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] conservative with [[Legitimists|Legitimist]] sympathies and a noted mistrust of secularists, de MacMahon grew to be increasingly at odds with the French parliament as liberal and secular republicans gained legislative majority during his presidency.\n\nIn February 1875, a series of parliamentary acts established the [[French Constitutional Laws of 1875|constitutional laws of the new republic]]. At its head was a President of the Republic. A two-chamber parliament consisting of a directly-elected [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|Chamber of Deputies]] and an indirectly-elected [[Senate of France|Senate]] was created, along with a ministry under the President of the Council ([[prime minister]]), who was nominally answerable to both the President of the Republic and the legislature. Throughout the 1870s, the issue of whether a monarchy should replace or oversee the republic dominated public debate.\n\n[[File:1887 Bettanier Der Schwarze Fleck anagoria.JPG|thumb|right|In France, schoolchildren were taught not to forget the lost regions of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], which were coloured in black on maps.]]\nThe elections of 1876 demonstrated a high degree of public support for the increasingly anti-monarchist direction of the republican movement. A decisive Republican majority was elected to the Chamber of Deputies while the monarchist majority in the Senate was maintained by only one seat. President de MacMahon responded in May 1877, attempting to quell the Republicans' rising popularity and limit their political influence through a series of actions which would become known in France as [[16 May 1877 crisis|''le seize Mai'']].\n\nOn 16 May 1877, de MacMahon forced the resignation of [[Moderate Republicans (France)|Moderate Republican]] prime minister [[Jules Simon]] and appointed the [[Orl\u00e9anist]] [[Albert, duc de Broglie|Albert de Broglie]] to the office. When the Chamber of Deputies expressed outrage at the appointment, believing the transition of authority to be illegitimate and refusing to cooperate with either de MacMahon or de Broglie, de MacMahon dissolved the Chamber and called for a new general election to be held the following October. De MacMahon was subsequently accused by Republicans and republican sympathizers of attempting to stage a constitutional coup d'\u00e9tat, a claim which he publicly denied.\n\nThe October elections again brought a Republican majority to the Chamber of Deputies, further affirming public opinion. The Republicans would go on to gain a majority in the Senate by January 1879, establishing dominance in both houses and effectively ending the potential for a monarchist restoration. De MacMahon himself resigned on 30 January 1879 to be succeeded by the [[Opportunist Republicans|moderate]] [[Jules Gr\u00e9vy]].<ref>Brogan, ''France Under the Republic: The Development of Modern France (1870-1939)'' (1940) pp 127-43.</ref>\n\n===Opportunist Republicans===\n{{further|Opportunist Republicans}}\n\nFollowing the 16 May crisis in 1877, [[Legitimist]]s were pushed out of power, and the Republic was finally governed by republicans referred to as [[Opportunist Republicans]] for their support of moderate social and political changes in order to establish the new regime firmly. The [[Jules Ferry laws]] that made [[public education]] free, mandatory, and secular (''[[la\u00efcit\u00e9|la\u0457que]]''), were voted in 1881 and 1882, one of the first signs of the expanding civic powers of the Republic. From that time onward, public education was no longer under the exclusive control of the Catholic congregations.<ref>D.W. Brogan, ''France Under the Republic: The Development of Modern France (1870-1939)'' (1940) pp 144-79.</ref>\n\nTo discourage French monarchism as a serious political force, the [[French Crown Jewels]] were broken up and sold in 1885. Only a few crowns, their precious gems replaced by coloured glass, were kept.\n\n===Boulanger crisis===\n[[File:Georges_Ernest_Boulanger_by_Atelier_Nadar.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Georges Ernest Boulanger]], nicknamed G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Revanche]]\nIn 1889, the Republic was rocked by a sudden political crisis precipitated by General [[Georges Boulanger]]. An enormously popular general, he won a series of elections in which he would resign his seat in the Chamber of Deputies and run again in another district. At the apogee of his popularity in January 1889, he posed the threat of a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] and the establishment of a dictatorship. With his base of support in the working districts of Paris and other cities, plus rural traditionalist Catholics and royalists, he promoted an aggressive nationalism aimed against Germany.  The elections of September 1889 marked a decisive defeat for the Boulangists.  They were defeated by the changes in the electoral laws that prevented Boulanger from running in multiple constituencies; by the government's aggressive opposition; and by the absence of the general himself, who placed himself in self-imposed exile to be with his mistress.  The fall of Boulanger severely undermined the political strength of the conservative and royalist elements within France; they would not recover their strength until 1940.<ref>Brogan, ''France Under the Republic: The Development of Modern France (1870-1939)'' (1940) pp 183-213.</ref>\n\nRevisionist scholars have argued that the Boulangist movement more often represented elements of the radical left rather than the extreme right. Their work is part of an emerging consensus that France's radical right was formed in part during the Dreyfus era by men who had been Boulangist partisans of the radical left a decade earlier.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Paul |last=Mazgaj |title=The Origins of the French Radical Right: A Historiographical Essay |journal=[[French Historical Studies]] |year=1987 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=287\u2013315 |jstor=286267 |doi=10.2307/286267 }}</ref>\n\n===Panama scandal===\n{{main|Panama scandals}}\nThe [[Panama scandals]] of 1892 involved the enormous cost of a failed attempt to build the [[Panama Canal]]. Due to disease, death, inefficiency, and widespread corruption, the [[Panama Canal Company]] handling the massive project went bankrupt, with millions in losses. It is regarded as the largest monetary corruption scandal of the 19th century. Close to a billion francs were lost when the French government took bribes to keep quiet about the Panama Canal Company's financial troubles.<ref>David McCullough, ''The path between the seas: the creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914'' (2001) pp 45-242.</ref>\n\n===The welfare state and public health===\n{{cns|The state had a smaller role in France than in Germany before the First World War.

There was an accident insurance law for workers in 1898, and in 1910, France created a national pension plan.

Because it was so threatening to so many interests, the proposal was debated and postponed for 20 years before becoming law in 1902.

The conduct of the affair has become a modern and universal symbol of injustice. It remains one of the most striking examples of a complex miscarriage of justice in which a central role was played by the press and public opinion.  At issue was blatant [[anti-Semitism]] as practiced by the [[French Army]] and defended by conservatives and Catholic traditionalists against secular centre-left, left and republican forces, including most Jews. In the end, the latter triumphed.<ref>{{cite book |first=Piers Paul |last=Read |title=The Dreyfus Affair |location=New York |publisher=Bloomsbury Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-60819-432-2 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Stephen |last=Wilson |title=Antisemitism and Jewish Response in France during the Dreyfus Affair |journal=[[European History Quarterly|European Studies Review]] |year=1976 |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=225\u2013248 |doi=10.1177/026569147600600203 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:AlfredDreyfus.jpg|thumb|Capt. [[Alfred Dreyfus]]]]\n\nThe affair began in November 1894 with the conviction for treason of Captain [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a young French artillery officer of [[History of Jews in Alsace|Alsatian Jewish descent]]. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for communicating French military secrets to the German Embassy in Paris and sent to the penal colony at [[Devil's Island]] in [[French Guiana]] (nicknamed ''la guillotine s\u00e8che'', the dry guillotine), where he spent almost five years.\n\nTwo years later, evidence came to light that identified a French Army major named [[Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy]] as the real spy. After high-ranking military officials suppressed the new evidence, a military court unanimously acquitted Esterhazy. In response, the Army brought up additional charges against Dreyfus based on false documents. Word of the military court's attempts to frame Dreyfus began to spread, chiefly owing to the polemic ''[[J'accuse (letter)|J'accuse]]'', a vehement open letter published in a Paris newspaper in January 1898 by the notable writer [[\u00c9mile Zola]]. Activists put pressure on the government to re-open the case.\n\nIn 1899, Dreyfus was returned to France for another trial. The intense political and judicial scandal that ensued divided French society between those who supported Dreyfus (now called \"Dreyfusards\"), such as [[Anatole France]], [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] and [[Georges Clemenceau]], and those who condemned him (the anti-Dreyfusards), such as [[\u00c9douard Drumont]], the director and publisher of the anti-Semitic newspaper ''[[La Libre Parole]]''. The new trial resulted in another conviction and a 10-year sentence, but Dreyfus was given a pardon and set free. Eventually all the accusations against him were demonstrated to be baseless, and in 1906, Dreyfus was exonerated and re-instated as a major in the French Army.\n\nFrom 1894 to 1906, the scandal divided France deeply and lastingly into two opposing camps: the pro-Army \"anti-Dreyfusards\" composed of conservatives, Catholic traditionalists and monarchists who generally lost the initiative to the anti-clerical, pro-republican \"Dreyfusards\", with strong support from intellectuals and teachers. It embittered French politics and facilitated the increasing influence of radical politicians on both sides of the political spectrum.\n\n==Social history==\n{{main|Belle \u00c9poque}}\n\n===Newspapers===\nThe democratic political structure was supported by the proliferation of politicized newspapers. The circulation of the daily press in Paris went from 1 million in 1870 to 5 million in 1910; it later reached 6 million in 1939.  Advertising grew rapidly, providing a steady financial basis for publishing, but it did not cover all of the costs involved and had to be supplemented by secret subsidies from commercial interests that wanted favourable reporting.  A new liberal press law of 1881 abandoned the restrictive practices that had been typical for a century. [[R. Hoe & Company|High-speed rotary Hoe presses]], introduced in the 1860s, facilitated quick turnaround time and cheaper publication.  New types of popular newspapers, especially ''[[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]'', reached an audience more interested in diverse entertainment and gossip than hard news.  It captured a quarter of the Parisian market and forced the rest to lower their prices.  The main dailies employed their own journalists who competed for news flashes. All newspapers relied upon the Agence Havas (now [[Agence France-Presse]]), a telegraphic news service with a network of reporters and contracts with [[Reuters]] to provide world service.

They also took payments for favourable notices in news articles of commercial products. Sometimes, a newspaper would blackmail a business by threatening to publish unfavorable information unless the business immediately started advertising in the paper. Foreign governments, especially Russia and Turkey, secretly paid the press hundreds of thousands of francs a year to guarantee favourable coverage of the bonds it was selling in Paris. When the real news was bad about Russia, as during its 1905 Revolution or during its war with Japan, it raised the ante to millions.  During the World War, newspapers became more of a propaganda agency on behalf of the war effort and avoided critical commentary.  They seldom reported the achievements of the Allies, crediting all the good news to the French army.  In a sentence, the newspapers were not independent champions of the truth, but secretly paid advertisements for banking.<ref>See {{cite book |first=Theodore |last=Zeldin |authorlink=Theodore Zeldin |title=France: 1848\u20131945 |year=1977 |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn=978-0-19-822125-8 |chapter=Newspapers and corruption |pages=492\u2013573 }} Also, pp 522\u201324 on foreign subsidies.</ref>\n\nThe World War ended a golden era for the press. Their younger staff members were drafted, and male replacements could not be found (female journalists were not considered suitable.) Rail transportation was rationed and less paper and ink came in, and fewer copies could be shipped out. Inflation raised the price of newsprint, which was always in short supply. The cover price went up, circulation fell and many of the 242 dailies published outside Paris closed down. The government set up the Interministerial Press Commission to supervise the press closely. A separate agency imposed tight censorship that led to blank spaces where news reports or editorials were disallowed. The dailies sometimes were limited to only two pages instead of the usual four, leading one satirical paper to try to report the war news in the same spirit:\n: War News.

However the Parisian newspapers were largely stagnant after the war. The major postwar success story was [[Paris-Soir|''Paris Soir'']], which lacked any political agenda and was dedicated to providing a mix of sensational reporting to aid circulation and serious articles to build prestige.  By 1939, its circulation was over 1.7 million, double that of its nearest rival the tabloid ''[[Le Petit Parisien]]''. In addition to its daily paper, ''Paris Soir'' sponsored a highly successful women's magazine [[Marie Claire|''Marie-Claire'']].

The French clergy and bishops were closely associated with the monarchists and many of its hierarchy were from noble families. Republicans were based in the [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] middle class, who saw the Church's alliance with the monarchists as a political threat to republicanism, and a threat to the modern spirit of progress. The republicans detested the Church for its political and class affiliations; for them, the Church represented the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]], a time in French history most republicans hoped was long behind them.  The republicans were strengthened by Protestant and Jewish support.  Numerous laws were passed to weaken the Catholic Church. In 1879, priests were excluded from the administrative committees of hospitals and boards of charity; in 1880, new measures were directed against the religious congregations; from 1880 to 1890 came the substitution of lay women for nuns in many hospitals; in 1882, the [[Jules Ferry laws|Ferry school laws]] were passed.

Religious instruction in all schools was forbidden, and religious orders were forbidden to teach in them. Funds were appropriated from religious schools to build more state schools.

The Liberal Action was founded in 1901 by [[Jacques Piou]] and [[Albert de Mun]], former monarchists who switched to republicanism at the request of Pope [[Leo XIII]].

Membership was open to everyone, not just Catholics. It sought to gather all the \"honest people\" and to be the melting pot sought by Leo XIII where Catholics and moderate Republicans would unite to support a policy of tolerance and social progress. Its motto summarized its program: \"Liberty for all; equality before the law; better conditions for the workers.\" However, the \"old republicans\" were few, and it did not manage to regroup all Catholics, as it was shunned by monarchists, Christian democrats, and [[Integrist]]s. In the end, it recruited mostly among the liberal-Catholics ([[Jacques Piou]]) and the Social Catholics ([[Albert de Mun]]).  The ALP was drawn into battle from its very beginnings (its first steps coincided with the beginning of the Combes ministry and its anticlerical combat policy), as religious matters were at the heart of its preoccupations. It defended the Church in the name of liberty and common law. Fiercely fought by the ''[[Action fran\u00e7aise]]'', the movement declined from 1908, when it lost the support of Rome.

Bismarck's decision came in response to popular demand, and the Army's demand for a strong frontier. It was not necessary since France was much weaker militarily than Germany, but it forced Bismarck to orient German foreign policy to block France from having any major allies. Alsace and Lorraine were a grievance for some years, but by 1890 had largely faded away with the French realization that nostalgia was not as useful as modernization. France rebuilt its Army, emphasizing modernization in such features as new artillery, and after 1905 invested heavily in military aircraft. Most important in restoring prestige was a strong emphasis on the growing French Empire, which brought prestige, despite large financial costs.  Very few French families settled in the colonies, and they were too poor in natural resources and trade to significantly benefit the overall economy. Nevertheless, they were second in size only to the British Empire, provided prestige in world affairs, and gave an opportunity for Catholics (under heavy attack by the Republicans in Parliament) to devote their energies to spread French culture and civilization worldwide.  An extremely expensive investment in building the Panama Canal was a total failure, in terms of money, many deaths by disease, and political scandal.<ref>Jean-Marie Mayeur and Madeleine Reb\u00e9rioux, ''The Third Republic from its Origins to the Great War, 1871\u20131914'' (1984), pp 155-61, 168-69, 272-78.</ref>  Bismarck was fired in 1890, and after that German foreign policy was confused and misdirected.

Germany feuded with Britain, which encouraged London and Paris to drop their grievances over Egypt and Africa, reaching a compromise whereby the French recognized British primacy in Egypt, while Britain recognized French primacy in Morocco.  This enabled Britain and France to move closer together, finally achieving an informal military relationship after 1904.<ref>Jeremy D.

Although France was one of the few republics in Europe, its diplomats mingled smoothly with the aristocratic representatives at the royal courts.  Prime ministers and leading politicians generally paid little attention to foreign affairs, allowing a handful of senior men to control policy.  In the decades before the First World War they dominated the embassies in the 10 major countries where France had an ambassador (elsewhere, they sent lower-ranking ministers).  They included [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]], the foreign minister from 1898 to 1905; [[Paul Cambon]], in London, 1890-1920; [[Jean Jules Jusserand|Jules Jusserand]], in Washington from 1902 to 1924; and Camille Barr\u00e8re, in Rome from 1897 to 1924.  In terms of foreign policy, there was general agreement about the need for high protective tariffs, which kept agricultural prices high.  After the defeat by the Germans, there was a strong widespread anti-German sentiment focused on revanchism and regaining Alsace and Lorraine.  The Empire was a matter of great pride, and service as administrators, soldiers and missionaries was a high status occupation.<ref>Felix Gilbert, David Clay Large, ''The End of the European Era: 1890 to the Present'' (2002) p 64-65.</ref>\nFrench foreign policy from 1871 to 1914 showed a dramatic transformation from a humiliated power with no friends and not much of an empire in 1871, to the centerpiece of the European alliance system in 1914, with a flourishing colonial empire that was second in size only to Great Britain. Although religion was a hotly contested matter in domestic politics, the Catholic Church made missionary work and church building a specialty in the colonies.

Under heavy pressure the French withdrew, securing Anglo-Egyptian control over the area. The status quo was recognised by an agreement between the two states acknowledging British control over Egypt, while France became the dominant power in [[Morocco]], but France suffered a humiliating defeat overall.<ref>D.W.

France secured an alliance with the [[Russian Empire]] in 1894 after diplomatic talks between Germany and Russia had failed to produce any working agreement. The [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] served as the cornerstone of French foreign policy until 1917. A further link with Russia was provided by vast French investments and loans before 1914. In 1904, French foreign minister [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]] negotiated the ''[[Entente Cordiale]]'' with [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]], the British Foreign Secretary, an agreement that ended a long period of Anglo-French tensions and hostility. The ''Entente Cordiale'', which functioned as an informal Anglo-French alliance, was further strengthened by the [[First Moroccan Crisis|First]] and [[Agadir Crisis|Second Moroccan crises]] of 1905 and 1911, and by secret military and naval staff talks. Delcass\u00e9's rapprochement with Britain was controversial in France as [[Anglophobia]] was prominent around the start of the 20th century, sentiments that had been much reinforced by the [[Fashoda Incident]] of 1898, in which Britain and France had almost gone to war, and by the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], in which French public opinion was very much on the side of Britain's enemies.<ref>T.

Metropolitan France was a captive market, so large landowners could borrow large sums in Paris to modernize agricultural techniques with tractors and mechanized equipment.

(The Americans left their heavy weapons at home in order to use the available transports to send as many soldiers as possible.) Building on foundations laid in the early months of the war, the Ministry of War matched production to the operational and tactical needs of the army, with an emphasis on meeting the insatiable demands for artillery.

The Bloc was supported by business and finance and was friendly toward the army and the Church. Its main goals were revenge against Germany, economic prosperity for French business and stability in domestic affairs.

Herriot's party was in fact neither radical nor socialist, rather it represented the interests of small business and the lower middle class.

Anti-democratic groups, such as the [[French Communist Party|Communists]] on the left and royalists on the right, played relatively minor roles.\n\nThe flow of [[World War I reparations|reparations from Germany]] played a central role in strengthening French finances.

The horrible devastation of the war, including the death of 1.5&nbsp;million French soldiers, the devastation of much of the steel and coal regions, and the long-term costs for veterans, were always remembered. France demanded that Germany assume many of the costs incurred from the war through annual reparation payments. French foreign and security policy used the balance of power and alliance politics to compel Germany to comply with its obligations under the Treaty of Versailles.  the problem was that the United States and Britain rejected a defensive alliance. Potential allies in Eastern Europe, such as Poland,  Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia were too weak to confront Germany. Russia had been the long term  French ally in the East, but now it was controlled by deeply distrusted in Paris.  France's transition to a more conciliatory policy in 1924 was a response to pressure from Britain and the United States, as well as to French weakness.<ref>Jacques N\u00e9r\u00e9, ''The foreign policy of France from 1914 to 1945'' (1975)  pp 11-99.</ref>\n\nFrance enthusiastically joined the [[League of Nations]] in 1919, but felt betrayed by President [[Woodrow Wilson]], when his promises that the United States would sign a defence treaty with France and join the League were [[league of Nations#Global representation|rejected by the United States Congress]]. The main goal of French foreign policy was to preserve French power and neutralize the threat posed by Germany. When Germany fell behind in reparations payments in 1923, France [[occupation of Ruhr|seized the industrialized Ruhr region]]. The British Labour Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]], who viewed reparations as impossible to pay successfully, pressured French Premier [[\u00c9douard Herriot]] into a series of concessions to Germany. In total, France received \u00a31600&nbsp;million from Germany before reparations ended in 1932, but France had to pay war debts to the United States, and thus the net gain was only about \u00a3600&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite book |first=Maurice |last=Larkin |title=France since the Popular Front: Government and People, 1936\u20131986 |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1988 |isbn=978-0-19-873034-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/francesincepopul0000lark/page/9 9] |url=https://archive.org/details/francesincepopul0000lark/page/9 }}</ref>\n\nFrance tried to create a web of defensive treaties against Germany with Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.

The Communists supported its domestic policies, but did not take any seats in the cabinet.  The prime minister was L\u00e9on Blum, a technocratic socialist who avoided making decisions. In two years in office, it focused on labour law changes sought by the trade unions, especially the mandatory [[40-hour work week]], down from 48 hours. All workers were given a two-week [[paid vacation]]. A [[collective bargaining]] law facilitated union growth; membership soared from 1,000,000 to 5,000,000 in one year, and workers' political strength was enhanced when the Communist and non-Communist unions joined together. The government [[Nationalization#France|nationalized]] the armaments industry and tried to seize control of the [[Bank of France]] in an effort to break the power of the richest 200 families in the country. Farmers received higher prices, and the government purchased surplus wheat, but farmers had to pay higher taxes. Wave after wave of strikes hit French industry in 1936. Wage rates went up 48%, but the work week was cut back by 17%, and the cost of living rose 46%, so there was little real gain to the average worker. The higher prices for French products resulted in a decline in overseas sales, which the government tried to neutralize by [[devaluation|devaluing]] the franc, a measure that led to a reduction in the value of bonds and savings accounts.

France lost Alsace and most of Lorraine, and had to pay a cash indemnity to the new nation of Germany.\n* 1871: The [[Paris Commune]]. In a formal sense the Paris Commune of 1871 was simply the local authority that exercised power in Paris for two months in the spring of 1871. It was separate from that of the new government under [[Adolphe Thiers]]. The regime came to an end after a bloody suppression by Thiers's government in May 1871.\n* 1872\u201373: After the nation faced the immediate political problems, it needed to establish a permanent form of government. Thiers wanted to base it on the constitutional monarchy of Britain, however he realized France would have to remain republican. In expressing this belief, he violated the Pact of Bordeaux, angering the Monarchists in the Assembly. As a result, he was forced to resign in 1873.\n* 1873: Marshal MacMahon, a conservative Roman Catholic, was made President of the Republic. The Duc de Broglie, an Orleanist, as the prime minister. Unintentionally, the Monarchists had replaced an absolute monarchy by a parliamentary one.\n* Feb 1875: Series of parliamentary Acts established the organic or constitutional laws of the new republic. At its apex was a President of the Republic. A two-chamber parliament was created, along with a ministry under the ''President of the Council'', who was nominally answerable to both the President of the Republic and Parliament.\n* May 1877: with public opinion swinging heavily in favour of a republic, the President of the Republic, [[Patrice MacMahon]], himself a monarchist, made one last desperate attempt to salvage the monarchical cause by dismissing the republic-minded Prime Minister Jules Simon and reappointing the monarchist leader the Duc de Broglie to office. He then dissolved parliament and called a general election. If his hope had been to halt the move towards republicanism, it backfired spectacularly, with the President being accused of having staged a constitutional coup d'\u00e9tat, known as {{lang|fr|le seize Mai}} after the date when it happened.\n* 1879: Republicans returned triumphant, finally killing off the prospect of a restored French monarchy by gaining control of the Senate on 5 January 1879. MacMahon himself resigned on 30 January 1879, leaving a seriously weakened presidency in the shape of Jules Gr\u00e9vy.\n* 1880: The Jesuits and several other religious orders were dissolved, and their members were forbidden to teach in state schools.\n* 1881: Following the 16 May crisis in 1877, Legitimists were pushed out of power, and the Republic was finally governed by republicans, called Opportunist Republicans as they were in favour of moderate changes to firmly establish the new regime. The Jules Ferry laws on free, mandatory and secular public education, voted in 1881 and 1882, were one of the first sign of this republican control of the Republic, as public education was not any more in the exclusive control of the Catholic congregations.\n* 1882: Religious instruction was removed from all state schools. The measures were accompanied by the abolition of chaplains in the armed forces and the removal of nuns from hospitals. Due to the fact that France was mainly Roman Catholic, this was greatly opposed.\n* 1889: The Republic was rocked by the sudden but short-timed Boulanger crisis spawning the rise of the modern intellectual [[\u00c9mile Zola]]. Later, the Panama scandals also were quickly criticized by the press.\n* 1893: Following anarchist [[Auguste Vaillant]]'s bombing at the National Assembly, killing nobody but injuring one, deputies voted the {{lang|fr|lois sc\u00e9l\u00e9rates}} which limited the [[Law on the Freedom of the Press of 29 July 1881|1881 freedom of the press laws]]. The following year, President [[Marie Fran\u00e7ois Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] was stabbed to death by Italian anarchist Caserio.\n* 1894: The [[Dreyfus Affair]]: a Jewish artillery officer, [[Alfred Dreyfus]], was arrested on charges relating to conspiracy and espionage. Allegedly, Dreyfus had handed over important military documents discussing the designs of a new French artillery piece to a German military attach\u00e9 named [[Maximilian von Schwartzkoppen|Max von Schwartzkoppen]].\n* 1894: The [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] was formed.\n* 1898: Writer \u00c9mile Zola published an article entitled {{lang|fr|J'Accuse...!}} The article alleged an anti-Semitic conspiracy in the highest ranks of the military to scapegoat Dreyfus, tacitly supported by the government and the Catholic Church. The [[Fashoda Incident]] nearly causes an Anglo-French war.\n* 1901: The Radical-Socialist Party is founded and remained the most important party of the Third Republic starting at the end of the 19th century. The same year, followers of [[L\u00e9on Gambetta]], such as [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]], who became President of the Council in the 1920s, created the Democratic Republican Alliance (ARD), which became the main center-right party after World War I and the parliamentary disappearance of monarchists and Bonapartists.\n* 1904: French foreign minister [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]] negotiated with Lord Lansdowne, the British Foreign Secretary, the {{lang|fr|[[Entente Cordiale]]}} in 1904.\n* 1905: The government introduced the law on the separation of Church and State, heavily supported by Emile Combes, who had been strictly enforcing the 1901 voluntary association law and the 1904 law on religious congregations' freedom of teaching (more than 2,500 private teaching establishments were by then closed by the state, causing bitter opposition from the Catholic and conservative population).\n* 1906: It became apparent that the documents handed over to Schwartzkoppen by Dreyfus in 1894 were a forgery and thus Dreyfus was pardoned after serving 12 years in prison.\n* 1914: After SFIO (French Section of the Workers' International) leader [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]]'s assassination a few days before the German invasion of Belgium, the French socialist movement, as the whole of the Second International, abandoned its antimilitarist positions and joined the national war effort.

This language change was designed to institute a universal language throughout the then British Raj in South Asia as well as minimize the influence that [[Persia]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Afghanistan had on this transitional region.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nUrdu is a relatively new language but has undergone considerable modification and development, with many borrowings from older languages such as Persian, [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]] and other [[Languages of South Asia|South Asian languages]]. It is a standardized register of [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] and in its spoken form. It is widely used, both formally and informally, for personal letters as well as public literature, in the literary sphere and in the popular media. It is a required subject of study in all primary and secondary schools. It is the first language of most [[Muhajir (Pakistan)|Muhajirs]] \u2013 Muslim refugees that arrived from different parts of [[India]] after the [[Pakistan movement|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, and that form nearly 8% of Pakistan's population \u2013 and is an acquired language by nearly all of Pakistan's native ethnic groups. It is spoken by almost 92% of the population, making Pakistan a unique country in its choice of a national language. Urdu has been promoted as a token of national unity.\n\nIn recent years, the Urdu spoken in Pakistan has undergone further evolution and acquired a particularly \"Pakistani flavour\", often absorbing local native terminology and adopting a strong [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] and [[Pashto language|Pashto]] leaning in terms of intonations and vocabulary. It is a modern language which is constantly evolving from its original form. It is written in a modified form of the [[Perso-Arabic script]], [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script|Nastaliq]], and its basic Hindi-based vocabulary has been enriched by words from [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Turkic languages]] and English.

Punjabi does not have any official status in Pakistan. The exact number of Punjabi speakers in Pakistan is hard to determine since the boundaries with the closely related [[Hindko]] and [[Saraiki language|Saraiki]] are not always clear-cut. The standard Punjabi variety is from [[Lahore]], [[Sialkot]], [[Gujranwala]] and [[Sheikhupura]] districts of Pakistani Punjab, and is also nowadays the language of Punjabi literature, film and music, such as [[Lollywood]].\n\n====Pashto====<!--Linked from [[Template:Pashtuns]]-->\n[[Pashto language|Pashto]] is a provincial language spoken as a first language by about 15% of Pakistanis, mostly in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] as well as by immigrants to the eastern provinces. There are two major dialect patterns within which the various individual dialects may be classified; these are Pakhto, which is the Northern ([[Peshawar]]) variety and the softer Pashto spoken in the southern areas. There are also many Pakistanis from the adjacent regions of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Sindh]] and [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] who are conversant in Pashto and count it as their second language.

It has a rich literature and is used in schools. It is an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] ([[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]) language, derived from [[Sanskrit]]. The [[Arab people|Arabs]] ruled [[Sindh]] for more than 150 years after [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] conquered it in 712&nbsp; AD, remaining there for three years to set up Arab rule. Consequently, the social fabric of Sindh contains elements of Arabic society. Sindhi is spoken by over 36 million people in Pakistan and is the official language of Sindh province. It is widely spoken in the [[Lasbela District]] of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] (where the [[Lasi]] tribe speaks a dialect of Sindhi), many areas of the [[Nasirabad District|Naseerabad]] and [[Jafarabad District|Jafarabad]] districts of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], and by the Sindhi diaspora abroad. The Sindhi language has six major [[dialect]]s: Sireli, Vicholi, Lari, Thari, Lasi and Kachhi. It is written in the [[Arabic script]] with several additional letters to accommodate special sounds. The largest Sindhi-speaking cities are [[Karachi, Pakistan|Karachi]], [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]], [[Sukkur]], [[Shikarpur, Pakistan|Shikarpur]], [[Dadu, Pakistan|Dadu]], [[Jacobabad]], [[Larkana]], [[Mirpur Khas]], [[Thatta]], [[Badin]] and [[Nawabshah]]. [[Sindhi literature]] is also spiritual in nature. [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhita'i]] (1689\u20131752) is one of its greatest poets, and wrote [[Sassi Punnun]] and [[Umar Marvi]], folk stories, in his famous book ''[[Shah Jo Risalo]]''.\n\nSindhi dialects:\n* '''Sindhi Saraiki''' \u2013 spoken mainly in Upper [[Sindh]]\n* '''Vicholi''' \u2013 in Vicholo, i.e. Central [[Sindh]]\n* '''Lari''' \u2013 in Laru, i.e. Lower [[Sindh]]\n* '''Lasi''' \u2013 in Lasa B\u2019elo, a part of Kohistan in [[Baluchistan]] on the western side of [[Sindh]]\n* '''Thari or Thareli''' \u2013 in Tharu, the desert region on the southeast border of [[Sindh]] and a part of the [[Jaisalmer district]] in Rajasthan\n* '''Kachhi''' \u2013 in the [[Kutch]] region and in a part of Kathiawar in [[Gujarat]], on the southern side of [[Sindh]]\n\nVicholi is considered as the standard dialect by all Sindhi speakers.\n\n====Saraiki====\n[[Saraiki language|Saraiki]], sometimes spelled Seraiki and Siraiki, is spoken as a first language by about 20 million people, mostly in the southern districts of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]]: Multan, Lodhran, Bahawalpur, Layyah, Dera Ghazi Khan, Muzaffargarh and Rahim Yar Khan. It is also spoken by the majority of the population of [[Dera Ismail Khan District]] in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province, Kachi plain of Balochistan, northern parts of Sindh, and cities of Hyderabad and Karachi.\n\n====Balochi====\n[[Balochi language|Balochi]] is a provincial language spoken as the first language by about 3.5% of Pakistanis, mostly in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]]. [[Sindh]] and southern [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]]. The name ''Balochi'' or ''Baluchi'' is not found before the 10th century. It is believed that the language was brought to its present location in a series of migrations [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]]. [[Rakshani]] is the major dialect group in terms of numbers. [[Sarhaddi]], is a sub dialect of Rakshani. Other sub \u2013 dialects are [[Qalati]], [[Chagai Kharani]], and [[Makrani]]. The Eastern Hill Balochi or Northern Balochi are distinct dialects. The Kethran language in North East Balochistan is also a variant of Balochi. It is one of the 9 distinguished languages of Pakistan. Since [[Balochi language|Balochi]] is a poetic and rich language and have a certain degree of affinity to [[Urdu language|Urdu]], Balochi poets tend to be very good poets in Urdu as well as Ata Shaad, [[Mir Gul Khan Nasir|Gul Khan Nasir]] and [[Noon Meem Danish]] are excellent examples of this.\n\n====Brahui====\n[[Brahui language|Brahui]] ({{lang-ur| \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06c1\u0648\u06cc  '}}) is a regional language of uncertain origin despite the fact that the bulk of the language shares lexical similarities to [[Balochi language|Balochi]] as well as [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]]. In colonial times, many British linguists tried to make the claim of a possible [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian language]] origin but this has not been conclusively proven despite ongoing research in the language for a century now.<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\">Vogelsang, Wilhelm ''The Afghans'' Wiley-Blackwell 2002 {{ISBN|978-0-631-19841-3}} pp.61\u201362 [https://books.google.com/books?id=9kfJ6MlMsJQC&pg=RA1-PA61&dq=Brahui+dravidian#PRA1-PA62,M1]</ref> spoken in southern Pakistan, may have evolved from the original languages of [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus valley civilizations]] at [[Mehrgarh]].

Around 1\u20131.5% of the Pakistani population has Brahui as their first language. It is one of the nine distinguished languages of [[Pakistan]].\n\nThe [[Brahui people|Brahui]] population of [[Balochistan (region)|Balochistan]] has been taken by some as the linguistic equivalent of a [[relict]] population, perhaps indicating that [[Dravidian languages]] were formerly much more widespread and were supplanted by the incoming [[Indo-Aryan languages]].<ref name=\" Mallory 1989\">{{Harv|Mallory|1989}}</ref> However it has now been demonstrated that the Brahui could only have migrated to Balochistan from [[central India]] after 1000 CE. The absence of any [[Avestan language|Avestan]], an older Iranian language, loanwords in Brahui supports this hypothesis.

There are over 500,000<ref name=\"Pakistan\"/> Gujari speakers in Pakistan.\n\n====Arabic====\n{{main|Arab\u2013Pakistan relations}}\n[[Arabic language|Arabic]] is considered to be a religious language in Pakistan. The [[Qur'an]], [[Sunnah]], [[Hadith]] and Muslim theology is taught in Arabic with [[Urdu language|Urdu]] translation. The large numbers of Pakistanis living in the [[Persian Gulf]] region and in other Middle Eastern countries has further increased the number of people who can speak Arabic in Pakistan. Arabic is taught as a religious language in Mosques, Schools, Colleges, Universities and [[Madrasah|Madrassahs]]. Nearly all of Pakistan's Muslim population has had some form of education in the reading, writing and pronunciation of the [[Arabic language]].\n\nMany [[Arab people|Arabs]] who took part in [[Afghanistan]] war have now settled in [[Pakistan]] permanently with their families. Millions of Pakistanis that have worked in Middle East also speak [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as a second language.\n\n====Other Pakistani languages====\nNumerous other languages are spoken by relatively small numbers of people, especially in some of the more remote and isolated places in, for example, the [[Northern Areas, Pakistan|Northern Areas of Pakistan]].<ref name=ethnologue1>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=Pakistan|title=Ethnologue report for Pakistan: Languages of Pakistan|website=ethnologue.com|accessdate=27 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040901094949/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=Pakistan|archive-date=1 September 2004|url-status=dead}}</ref> Other [[Indo-European languages]] spoken in Pakistan include [[Pothohari language|Pothohari]], [[Shina language|Shina]], Balti, [[Gojri language|Gujjari]], [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]], [[Wakhi language|Wakhi]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Marwari language|Marwari]], [[Memoni]], [[Khowar language|Khowar]], and [[Dari (Persian)|Dari Persian]]. Non-[[Indo-European languages]] include [[Brahui language|Brahui]] and [[Burushaski]], a language isolate.\n\nThere are some languages that are spoken by less than a thousand people, such as [[Aer language|Aer]].\n\n===Classification===\n\n====Indo-European====\nMost of Pakistan's languages are [[Indo-European languages]] and within the smaller [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] sub-branch.\n\n=====Indo-Aryan languages=====\nAround 80% of Pakistan's population speak one or more of the various [[Indo-Aryan languages]]. Usually concentrated in the heavily populated areas east of the [[Indus River|Indus river]], the Indo-Aryan languages and their cultures form the predominant cultural group in the country. They derive their roots from the [[Sanskrit]] language of Aryan invadors and are later heavily influenced by the languages of the later Muslim arrivals (i.e., Turkish, Persian, and Arabic), and are all written in a variant of either the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] or [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script|Nastaliq]] script. Urdu, the country's national language, is an Indo-Aryan tongue. [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Hindko language|Hindko]] and [[Seraiki language|Seraiki]], all [[mutually intelligible]], are classified by linguists as dialects of an Indo-Aryan speech called [[Lahnda languages|Lahnda]],<ref name=ethnologue2>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90930|title=Browse by Language Family|work=Ethnologue}}</ref> also spelled as Lehnda. These are also, to a lesser extent, mutually intelligible with Urdu. Added together, speakers of these mutually-intelligible languages make up nearly two-thirds of Pakistan's population. [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] is the common language of the people of [[Sindh]] in southern Pakistan and has a rich literary history of its own, traced back to the era of the early Arab arrivals. The Dardic languages of [[Gilgit\u2013Baltistan]], [[Azad Kashmir]] and the northwestern mountains are sometimes classified by many linguists as belonging to the Indo-Aryan family. Other Indo-Aryan languages include [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]], [[Memoni language|Memoni]] and others.\n\n=====Dardic languages=====\nThe [[Dardic languages]] are spoken in the northern Pakistan. They include [[Shina language|Shina]] (spoken in [[Gilgit]], [[Chilas]] and [[Diamer District|Diamar]]), [[Khowar language|Khowar]] (spoken in [[Chitral]], [[Ghizer]], [[Swat District|Swat]] and the balti language (spoken in [baltistan] including [skardu] district and [Ghanche] district. Majority of population living in the valley of [[Hunza Valley|Hunza]], [[Nagar Valley|Nagar]] and [[Yasin Valley|Yasin]] speak Mishaski. [[Kalam Valley]] of upper [[Swat, Pakistan|Swat]]), [[Kalasha-mun|Kalash]] (spoken by [[Kalash people|Kalash]] tribe), [[Kohistani language|Kohistani]] (spoken in upper [[Swat, Pakistan|Swat]] and [[Kohistan District (Pakistan)|Kohistan]]) and [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] mostly by Immigrants from Kashmir valley and by a few in the [[Neelum District]].\n\nKashmiri spoken in north east [[Azad Kashmir]] and the adjacent Kashmir valley, (not to be confused with [[Pahari languages|Pahari language]] spoken in the lower [[Azad Kashmir]]) is one of the Dardic languages that has a literary tradition that goes well back into the history whereas other Dardic languages spoken in northern Pakistan, do not have written literature. It is believed to be the result of the northern areas of Pakistan having remained isolated in the mountain valleys from the others for centuries.\n\n=====Iranian=====\n[[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Yidgha]] and [[Wakhi language|Wakhi]] are [[Eastern Iranian languages]] spoken in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] and the [[Gilgit\u2013Baltistan]] region of Pakistan. Balochi spoken in Balochistan is classified as a members of the Northwestern Iranian languages.<ref name=ethnologue3>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90019|title=Browse by Language Family|work=Ethnologue}}</ref> If combined, [[Iranian peoples]] who speak Pashto, Balochi, Yidgha and Wakhi comprise about 18% of the population of Pakistan, and are concentrated in the northwest and west of Pakistan.\n\n====Brahui====\n[[Brahui language|Brahui]] may or may not be a [[language isolate]] and many origins have been hypothesized for it including [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] and [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]].<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\" /> spoken in southern Pakistan, primarily in [[Kalat District|Kalat]] in Balochistan. The [[Brahui people|Brahui]] population of [[Balochistan (region)|Balochistan]] has been taken by some as the linguistic equivalent of a [[relict]] population, perhaps indicating that [[Dravidian languages]]  were formerly much more widespread and were supplanted by the incoming [[Indo-Aryan languages]].<ref name=\"Mallory 1989\"/> However it has now been demonstrated that the Brahui could only have migrated to Balochistan from [[central India]] after 1000 CE. The absence of any [[Avestan language|Avestan]], an older Iranian language, loanwords in Brahui supports this hypothesis. The main Iranian contributor to Brahui vocabulary, [[Balochi language|Balochi]], is a western [[Iranian language]] like [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]], and moved to the area from the west only around 1000 CE.<ref name=\"H. Elfenbein 1987 pp. 215-233\"/>\n\n====Burushaski====\n\n[[Burushaski]] is a language isolate, spoken by [[Burusho people]] in [[Hunza Valley|Hunza]], [[Nagar Valley|Nagar]], [[Yasin Valley|Yasin]], and parts of the [[Gilgit Valley|Gilgit]] valleys in the Gilgit\u2013Baltistan region of Pakistan.\n\n==Religion==\n{{Main|Religion in Pakistan}}\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion in Pakistan  (2017)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=POPULATION BY RELIGION|url=http://www.pbs.gov.pk/sites/default/files//tables/POPULATION%20BY%20RELIGION.pdf|journal=Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, Government of Pakistan|volume=|pages=1|via=}}</ref>\n|label1 = [[Islam]] \n|value1 = 93.96\n|color1 = green\n|label2 = [[Hinduism]]\n|value2 = 3.82\n|color2 = Orange\n|label3 = [[Christianity]]\n|value3 = 1.92\n|color3 = Blue\n|label4 = Other religions\n|value4 = 0.30\n|color4 = Red\n}}\nAccording to the [[The World Factbook|World Factbook]], [[Library of Congress Country Studies|Library of Congress]], [[Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies|Oxford University]], over 96% of the population of Pakistan is Muslim and the remaining 4% is Hindu, Christian, and others.<ref name=\"Oxford\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1809?_hi=1&_pos=1 |title=Pakistan, Islam in |accessdate=29 August 2010 |work=[[Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies]] |quote=Approximately 97 percent of Pakistanis are Muslim.

This language change was designed to institute a universal language throughout the then British Raj in South Asia as well as minimize the influence that [[Persia]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Afghanistan had on this transitional region.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nUrdu is a relatively new language but has undergone considerable modification and development, with many borrowings from older languages such as Persian, [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]] and other [[Languages of South Asia|South Asian languages]]. It is a standardized register of [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] and in its spoken form. It is widely used, both formally and informally, for personal letters as well as public literature, in the literary sphere and in the popular media. It is a required subject of study in all primary and secondary schools. It is the first language of most [[Muhajir (Pakistan)|Muhajirs]] \u2013 Muslim refugees that arrived from different parts of [[India]] after the [[Pakistan movement|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, and that form nearly 8% of Pakistan's population \u2013 and is an acquired language by nearly all of Pakistan's native ethnic groups. It is spoken by almost 92% of the population, making Pakistan a unique country in its choice of a national language. Urdu has been promoted as a token of national unity.\n\nIn recent years, the Urdu spoken in Pakistan has undergone further evolution and acquired a particularly \"Pakistani flavour\", often absorbing local native terminology and adopting a strong [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] and [[Pashto language|Pashto]] leaning in terms of intonations and vocabulary. It is a modern language which is constantly evolving from its original form. It is written in a modified form of the [[Perso-Arabic script]], [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script|Nastaliq]], and its basic Hindi-based vocabulary has been enriched by words from [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Turkic languages]] and English. Urdu has drawn inspiration from [[Persian literature]] and has now an enormous stock of words from that language.\n\nThe first poetry in Urdu was by the poet [[Amir Khusro]] (1253\u20131325) and the first Urdu book ''Woh Majlis'' was written in 1728; the first time the word \"Urdu\" was used was by [[Sirajuddin Ali Khan Arzoo]] in 1741.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nH1HBxdA1UIC&pg=PA178&lpg=PA178&dq=Siraj-ud-din+Arzoo+urdu#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Urdu/Hindi: An Artificial Divide|publisher=|isbn=9780875864389|last1=Khan|first1=Abdul Jamil|year=2006}}</ref> The [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Aurangzeb|Aurangzeb Alamgir]] (1658\u20131707) spoke what the locals called ''Lashakri Zaban'' or what the Mughals called ''Zaban-i-Ordu'' (both meaning \"language of the [[Great Horde|Horde]]\"; commonly known as [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] back then) fluently as did his descendants while his ancestors mostly spoke [[Persian language|Persian]] and a language [[Turkic language|related to Turkish]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-246277088.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105204345/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-246277088.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-11-05|title=Bonds of Culture}}</ref>\n\n====Punjabi====\n[[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] is a provincial language spoken mostly in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], as well as by a large number of people in [[Karachi]]. Punjabi does not have any official status in Pakistan. The exact number of Punjabi speakers in Pakistan is hard to determine since the boundaries with the closely related [[Hindko]] and [[Saraiki language|Saraiki]] are not always clear-cut. The standard Punjabi variety is from [[Lahore]], [[Sialkot]], [[Gujranwala]] and [[Sheikhupura]] districts of Pakistani Punjab, and is also nowadays the language of Punjabi literature, film and music, such as [[Lollywood]].\n\n====Pashto====<!--Linked from [[Template:Pashtuns]]-->\n[[Pashto language|Pashto]] is a provincial language spoken as a first language by about 15% of Pakistanis, mostly in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] as well as by immigrants to the eastern provinces. There are two major dialect patterns within which the various individual dialects may be classified; these are Pakhto, which is the Northern ([[Peshawar]]) variety and the softer Pashto spoken in the southern areas. There are also many Pakistanis from the adjacent regions of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Sindh]] and [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] who are conversant in Pashto and count it as their second language.

It has a rich literature and is used in schools. It is an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] ([[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]) language, derived from [[Sanskrit]]. The [[Arab people|Arabs]] ruled [[Sindh]] for more than 150 years after [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] conquered it in 712&nbsp; AD, remaining there for three years to set up Arab rule. Consequently, the social fabric of Sindh contains elements of Arabic society. Sindhi is spoken by over 36 million people in Pakistan and is the official language of Sindh province. It is widely spoken in the [[Lasbela District]] of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] (where the [[Lasi]] tribe speaks a dialect of Sindhi), many areas of the [[Nasirabad District|Naseerabad]] and [[Jafarabad District|Jafarabad]] districts of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], and by the Sindhi diaspora abroad. The Sindhi language has six major [[dialect]]s: Sireli, Vicholi, Lari, Thari, Lasi and Kachhi. It is written in the [[Arabic script]] with several additional letters to accommodate special sounds. The largest Sindhi-speaking cities are [[Karachi, Pakistan|Karachi]], [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]], [[Sukkur]], [[Shikarpur, Pakistan|Shikarpur]], [[Dadu, Pakistan|Dadu]], [[Jacobabad]], [[Larkana]], [[Mirpur Khas]], [[Thatta]], [[Badin]] and [[Nawabshah]]. [[Sindhi literature]] is also spiritual in nature. [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhita'i]] (1689\u20131752) is one of its greatest poets, and wrote [[Sassi Punnun]] and [[Umar Marvi]], folk stories, in his famous book ''[[Shah Jo Risalo]]''.\n\nSindhi dialects:\n* '''Sindhi Saraiki''' \u2013 spoken mainly in Upper [[Sindh]]\n* '''Vicholi''' \u2013 in Vicholo, i.e. Central [[Sindh]]\n* '''Lari''' \u2013 in Laru, i.e. Lower [[Sindh]]\n* '''Lasi''' \u2013 in Lasa B\u2019elo, a part of Kohistan in [[Baluchistan]] on the western side of [[Sindh]]\n* '''Thari or Thareli''' \u2013 in Tharu, the desert region on the southeast border of [[Sindh]] and a part of the [[Jaisalmer district]] in Rajasthan\n* '''Kachhi''' \u2013 in the [[Kutch]] region and in a part of Kathiawar in [[Gujarat]], on the southern side of [[Sindh]]\n\nVicholi is considered as the standard dialect by all Sindhi speakers.\n\n====Saraiki====\n[[Saraiki language|Saraiki]], sometimes spelled Seraiki and Siraiki, is spoken as a first language by about 20 million people, mostly in the southern districts of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]]: Multan, Lodhran, Bahawalpur, Layyah, Dera Ghazi Khan, Muzaffargarh and Rahim Yar Khan. It is also spoken by the majority of the population of [[Dera Ismail Khan District]] in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province, Kachi plain of Balochistan, northern parts of Sindh, and cities of Hyderabad and Karachi.\n\n====Balochi====\n[[Balochi language|Balochi]] is a provincial language spoken as the first language by about 3.5% of Pakistanis, mostly in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]]. [[Sindh]] and southern [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]]. The name ''Balochi'' or ''Baluchi'' is not found before the 10th century. It is believed that the language was brought to its present location in a series of migrations [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]]. [[Rakshani]] is the major dialect group in terms of numbers. [[Sarhaddi]], is a sub dialect of Rakshani. Other sub \u2013 dialects are [[Qalati]], [[Chagai Kharani]], and [[Makrani]]. The Eastern Hill Balochi or Northern Balochi are distinct dialects. The Kethran language in North East Balochistan is also a variant of Balochi. It is one of the 9 distinguished languages of Pakistan. Since [[Balochi language|Balochi]] is a poetic and rich language and have a certain degree of affinity to [[Urdu language|Urdu]], Balochi poets tend to be very good poets in Urdu as well as Ata Shaad, [[Mir Gul Khan Nasir|Gul Khan Nasir]] and [[Noon Meem Danish]] are excellent examples of this.\n\n====Brahui====\n[[Brahui language|Brahui]] ({{lang-ur| \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06c1\u0648\u06cc  '}}) is a regional language of uncertain origin despite the fact that the bulk of the language shares lexical similarities to [[Balochi language|Balochi]] as well as [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]].

The [[Qur'an]], [[Sunnah]], [[Hadith]] and Muslim theology is taught in Arabic with [[Urdu language|Urdu]] translation. The large numbers of Pakistanis living in the [[Persian Gulf]] region and in other Middle Eastern countries has further increased the number of people who can speak Arabic in Pakistan. Arabic is taught as a religious language in Mosques, Schools, Colleges, Universities and [[Madrasah|Madrassahs]]. Nearly all of Pakistan's Muslim population has had some form of education in the reading, writing and pronunciation of the [[Arabic language]].\n\nMany [[Arab people|Arabs]] who took part in [[Afghanistan]] war have now settled in [[Pakistan]] permanently with their families.

Usually concentrated in the heavily populated areas east of the [[Indus River|Indus river]], the Indo-Aryan languages and their cultures form the predominant cultural group in the country. They derive their roots from the [[Sanskrit]] language of Aryan invadors and are later heavily influenced by the languages of the later Muslim arrivals (i.e., Turkish, Persian, and Arabic), and are all written in a variant of either the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] or [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script|Nastaliq]] script. Urdu, the country's national language, is an Indo-Aryan tongue. [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Hindko language|Hindko]] and [[Seraiki language|Seraiki]], all [[mutually intelligible]], are classified by linguists as dialects of an Indo-Aryan speech called [[Lahnda languages|Lahnda]],<ref name=ethnologue2>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90930|title=Browse by Language Family|work=Ethnologue}}</ref> also spelled as Lehnda. These are also, to a lesser extent, mutually intelligible with Urdu. Added together, speakers of these mutually-intelligible languages make up nearly two-thirds of Pakistan's population. [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] is the common language of the people of [[Sindh]] in southern Pakistan and has a rich literary history of its own, traced back to the era of the early Arab arrivals. The Dardic languages of [[Gilgit\u2013Baltistan]], [[Azad Kashmir]] and the northwestern mountains are sometimes classified by many linguists as belonging to the Indo-Aryan family. Other Indo-Aryan languages include [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]], [[Memoni language|Memoni]] and others.\n\n=====Dardic languages=====\nThe [[Dardic languages]] are spoken in the northern Pakistan. They include [[Shina language|Shina]] (spoken in [[Gilgit]], [[Chilas]] and [[Diamer District|Diamar]]), [[Khowar language|Khowar]] (spoken in [[Chitral]], [[Ghizer]], [[Swat District|Swat]] and the balti language (spoken in [baltistan] including [skardu] district and [Ghanche] district.
