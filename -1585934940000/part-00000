That stage was won by Belgian [[Maurice Blomme]], but not without difficulties: he was so exhausted that he mistook a dark shadow for the finish line, and stopped racing.

A safety official pulled him from the race, afraid for his safety, and Molin\u00e8s rode through alone. Zaaf did not agree with the safety official, and mounted his bicycle again. He quickly fell off his bicycle and fell asleep, and spectators moved him into the shade of a tree.<ref name=\"cwszaaf\"/> When he woke up, he realised that he was in a race, got on his bicycle again and rode away, but going into the wrong direction.

The Tour de France jury said Bobet came in second, and gave him the 30 seconds bonification time, but the Belgian team manager [[Sylv\u00e8re Maes]] protested against this decision, because he argued that Ockers came in second. Maes threatened to take the Belgian team out of the race, but the Tour direction did not change their decision. In the end, the Belgian team stayed in the race.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.archiefleeuwardercourant.nl/site/article.do?code=LC&date=19500801&id=LC-19500801-2008|title=Dreigement van Sylver Maes|publisher=Leeuwarder Courant|date=1 August 1950|accessdate=3 December 2009|language=Dutch}}</ref>\n\nSecond placed rider in the general classification, Ockers was unable to win back time in later stages, so K\u00fcbler stayed in the lead for the rest of the race, and became the first Swiss winner of the Tour de France.\n\nK\u00fcbler's victory is seen as partially his own accomplishment, but also partially due to the absence of Fausto Coppi and the withdrawal of the Italian teams.{{sfn|Whittle|2003|p=113}} According to K\u00fcbler, it became more difficult to win the race after the Italians had left the race, because the attention was no longer focussed on the Italians, but on K\u00fcbler.

Louison Bobet won this classification after having led the classification almost the entire race, although he only reached 2 of the 14 mountain tops first.<ref name=\"mdc1950\"/>\n\nThe [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]] was calculated by adding the times in the general classification of the best three cyclists per team.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}} It was won by the Belgian team, with a large margin over the French team. Of the other four teams that started, the two Italian teams had abandoned the race, and the North African team finished with only two riders and the Dutch team with only one rider, therefore they were ineligible for the team classification. The [[Souvenir Henri Desgrange]] was given in honour of Tour founder [[Henri Desgrange]] to the first rider to pass the summit of the [[Col du Lautaret]] on stage 19.

Out of respect for Magni, K\u00fcbler did not wear the yellow jersey (indicating the leader in the general classification) in the 12th stage.\nIn the twelfth stage, all the favourites finished together. That stage was won by Belgian [[Maurice Blomme]], but not without difficulties: he was so exhausted that he mistook a dark shadow for the finish line, and stopped racing. The secretary of the Tour de France, [[Jean Garnault]], had to put him back on his bicycle so he would ride the last meters of the stage.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.archiefleeuwardercourant.nl/site/article.do?code=LC&date=19500727&id=LC-19500727-5003|title=Belg Blomme won 12e etappe|language=Dutch|publisher=Leeuwarder Courant|date=27 July 1950|accessdate=3 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn that stage thirteen, the temperature was extremely high. Two riders from the North African team, [[Marcel Molin\u00e8s]] and [[Abdel-Kader Zaaf]], broke away after 15 kilometers, and created a large gap, also because the other cyclists were more occupied with getting drinks.<ref name=\"cwszaaf\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingwebsite.net/coureurfiche.php?coureurid=6621|title=Abdel-Kader Zaaf|author=Tom Vandenbussche|language=Dutch|publisher=Cyclingwebsite|accessdate=3 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011141905/http://www.cyclingwebsite.net/coureurfiche.php?coureurid=6621|archive-date=11 October 2008|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref> Some 20 kilometers from the finish, Zaaf started to zigzag across the road. A safety official pulled him from the race, afraid for his safety, and Molin\u00e8s rode through alone. Zaaf did not agree with the safety official, and mounted his bicycle again. He quickly fell off his bicycle and fell asleep, and spectators moved him into the shade of a tree.<ref name=\"cwszaaf\"/> When he woke up, he realised that he was in a race, got on his bicycle again and rode away, but going into the wrong direction. An ambulance was called, and Zaaf was taken away. Zaaf claimed that he had received wine from a spectator, and as a Muslim he was not used to the alcohol.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=165\u2013173}} Behind the two North-African cyclists, K\u00fcbler had attacked, and left his rivals [[Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani]] and [[Louison Bobet]] minutes behind.<ref name=\"veloarchive\"/> Of the favourites, only Ockers managed to stay with K\u00fcbler.\n\nIn stage fifteen, it was still hot, and the riders were not motivated to race.

The Tour de France jury said Bobet came in second, and gave him the 30 seconds bonification time, but the Belgian team manager [[Sylv\u00e8re Maes]] protested against this decision, because he argued that Ockers came in second. Maes threatened to take the Belgian team out of the race, but the Tour direction did not change their decision. In the end, the Belgian team stayed in the race.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.archiefleeuwardercourant.nl/site/article.do?code=LC&date=19500801&id=LC-19500801-2008|title=Dreigement van Sylver Maes|publisher=Leeuwarder Courant|date=1 August 1950|accessdate=3 December 2009|language=Dutch}}</ref>\n\nSecond placed rider in the general classification, Ockers was unable to win back time in later stages, so K\u00fcbler stayed in the lead for the rest of the race, and became the first Swiss winner of the Tour de France.\n\nK\u00fcbler's victory is seen as partially his own accomplishment, but also partially due to the absence of Fausto Coppi and the withdrawal of the Italian teams.{{sfn|Whittle|2003|p=113}} According to K\u00fcbler, it became more difficult to win the race after the Italians had left the race, because the attention was no longer focussed on the Italians, but on K\u00fcbler. K\u00fcbler felt that he would have been able to win the 1950 Tour de France if the Italians would have not abandoned, because he was the best in the time trials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bikeraceinfo.com/oralhistory/kubler.html|title=Ferdy K\u00fcbler, 1950 Tour Winner, Answers Some Questions|publisher=Bike Race Info|date=23 September 2004|accessdate=3 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Classification leadership and minor prizes==\n\n[[File:Wiemu17.jpg|thumb|The [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]] trophy for 1950, won by the Belgium team]]\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish each stage was recorded, and these times were added together for the [[general classification in the Tour de France|general classification]].

Louison Bobet won this classification after having led the classification almost the entire race, although he only reached 2 of the 14 mountain tops first.<ref name=\"mdc1950\"/>\n\nThe [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]] was calculated by adding the times in the general classification of the best three cyclists per team.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}} It was won by the Belgian team, with a large margin over the French team. Of the other four teams that started, the two Italian teams had abandoned the race, and the North African team finished with only two riders and the Dutch team with only one rider, therefore they were ineligible for the team classification. The [[Souvenir Henri Desgrange]] was given in honour of Tour founder [[Henri Desgrange]] to the first rider to pass the summit of the [[Col du Lautaret]] on stage 19.

This came right after Trump attended a discussion where his senior health official [[Anthony Fauci]] told him it would actually take \"a year to a year and a half\" (at a minimum, Fauci later said). During that discussion, Trump repeatedly quizzed the leaders of pharmaceutical companies on the time needed to produce vaccines, stating: \"I like the sound of a couple of months better\".

Under the umbrella of [[Emergency Use Authorization]]s, the old policy stated that laboratory-developed tests \"should not be used for clinical diagnoses without FDA's approval, clearance, or authorization during an emergency declaration\". However, this policy was historically treated as a recommendation and generally unenforced, with no clear legal authority of the FDA in this area.

During the race, Coppi almost pulled out, because he felt he did not have full support from the team captain. In the Alps, Coppi recovered.

Binda tried to convince Coppi that he had been delayed, and he succeeded in keeping Coppi in the race.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=159\u2013165}}\n\nIn the [[Alps]], Coppi recovered. In the sixteenth stage, Coppi escaped, and only Bartali followed him. It was Bartali's 35th birthday, and Coppi gave Bartali the stage victory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclinghalloffame.com/riders/rider_bio.asp?rider_id=13|publisher=Cycling hall of fame|title=Rider biographies - Fausto Coppi|accessdate=20 February 2010}}</ref> After that stage, Bartali was first in the general classification, with Coppi in second place, 82 seconds behind.\nIn stage 17, Bartali and Coppi again were leading together. Around 40&nbsp;km into the stage, Bartali punctured. Coppi waited for Bartali, but when Bartali later fell and twisted his ankle, team leader Binda allowed Coppi to take  off alone.<ref name=\"veloarchive\"/> Coppi did so, won the stage, and decided the race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.letour.fr/HISTO/us/TDF/1949/histoire.html|publisher=[[Amaury Sport Organisation]]|year=2009|accessdate=2 December 2009|title=The Tour - Year 1949|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716155341/http://www.letour.fr/HISTO/us/TDF/1949/histoire.html|archive-date=16 July 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThat seventeenth stage finished in the Italian town Aosta. Many Italians had come to see the Tour de France, to cheer on their Italian heroes Coppi and Bartali but also to express their anger against the French cyclists, specifically [[Jean Robic]], who had said in an interview that he could beat those Italians easily. Insults were shouted against non-Italians in the Tour, and some windows of French cars were smashed. For safety, and because there were not enough telephone connections for the journalists, most Tour officials and journalists decided to spend the night in Switzerland.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=ddd:010886606:mpeg21:a0054|title=De ronde van Frankrijk: wanorderlijke taferelen|trans-title=Tour de France: disorderly scenes|date=21 July 1949|accessdate=19 April 2017|publisher=Delpher|work=Nieuwsblad van het Noorden|page=3|language=Dutch}}</ref>\n\nWhen the Tour returned to France in the nineteenth stage to Colmar, some French spectators took revenge by throwing tomatoes and rocks towards the Italian cyclists and followers.

It consisted of 21 stages over {{convert|4808|km|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe Italian team had internal problems, because [[Gino Bartali]] and [[Fausto Coppi]] could both be the team leader. During the selection procedure, Coppi almost refused to start the race, but he was convinced to start. During the race, Coppi almost pulled out, because he felt he did not have full support from the team captain. In the Alps, Coppi recovered. The race was won by Coppi, with second place taken by teammate Bartali, the winner of the previous year. Coppi also won the [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]], while his Italian team won the [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]].\n\n==Changes from the previous Tour==\nThe 1949 Tour de France marked the first time that the Tour de France had a stage finish in Spain, when it stopped in [[San Sebasti\u00e1n|San Sebastian]] in the ninth stage.<ref name=\"veloarchive\"/>\nWhile the mountains had been categorised into two categories in 1948, in 1949 the third category was added.{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=40}}\n\n==Teams==\n{{main list|List of teams and cyclists in the 1949 Tour de France}}\n\nAs was the custom since the [[1930 Tour de France]], the 1949 Tour de France was contested by national and regional teams. The three major cycling countries in 1949, Italy, Belgium and France, each sent a team of 12 cyclists. Other countries sent teams of 6 cyclists: Switzerland, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Spain. Italy and Belgium also sent two extra teams of young riders of 6 cyclists each.\nThe French regional cyclists were divided into four teams of 12 cyclists: \u00cele-de-France, West/North, Centre/South-West and South-East. Altogether this made 120 cyclists.<ref name=\"mdc1949\"/>\n\nThere were 57 French cyclists, 22 Italian, 18 Belgian, 6 Dutch, 6 Luxembourg, 6 Spanish, 6 Swiss and 1 Polish cyclist.<ref name=\"tgv\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tour-giro-vuelta.net|title=Tour-Giro-Vuelta|work=www.tour-giro-vuelta.net|accessdate=2 December 2009}}</ref>\nIn the previous year, Fausto Coppi refused to enter the Tour de France because of personal problems with his teammate Gino Bartali. Bartali had won the previous Tour, and was trying to equal [[Philippe Thys]] by winning the Tour three times.<ref name=\"mdc1949\"/> Coppi had won the [[1949 Giro d'Italia]], and wanted to be the first one to achieve the Tour-Giro double in one year.

Before the fifth stage, Coppi and Bartali both were not in the top fifteen of the general classification.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=159\u2013165}}\n\nIn that fifth stage, Coppi escaped together with the leader of the general classification, [[Jacques Marinelli]]. When they were leading by 6 minutes, Coppi and Marinelli fell in [[Mouen]].<ref name=\"veloarchive\"/> Marinelli was not hurt and could continue, but Coppi's bike was broken. The Italian team car offered him a new one, but Coppi refused because he wanted his personal spare bike, and threatened to quit the race.\n\nWhen Bartali reached Coppi, he saw the problem, and waited. Even later, the Italian team captain Binda arrived with Coppi's spare bike, and Bartali and Coppi started to ride. Coppi started to slow down, complaining he was hungry and exhausted. Bartali decided he could not wait anymore, and rode away from Coppi. Coppi came in 18 minutes late that stage.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=159\u2013165}}\nLater that night, it became clear that Coppi had been angry because the team leader had not been following him, even though he was in the leading group. Coppi did not want to race in a team where Bartali and not he was the leader. Binda tried to convince Coppi that he had been delayed, and he succeeded in keeping Coppi in the race.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=159\u2013165}}\n\nIn the [[Alps]], Coppi recovered. In the sixteenth stage, Coppi escaped, and only Bartali followed him.

Around 40&nbsp;km into the stage, Bartali punctured. Coppi waited for Bartali, but when Bartali later fell and twisted his ankle, team leader Binda allowed Coppi to take  off alone.<ref name=\"veloarchive\"/> Coppi did so, won the stage, and decided the race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.letour.fr/HISTO/us/TDF/1949/histoire.html|publisher=[[Amaury Sport Organisation]]|year=2009|accessdate=2 December 2009|title=The Tour - Year 1949|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716155341/http://www.letour.fr/HISTO/us/TDF/1949/histoire.html|archive-date=16 July 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThat seventeenth stage finished in the Italian town Aosta. Many Italians had come to see the Tour de France, to cheer on their Italian heroes Coppi and Bartali but also to express their anger against the French cyclists, specifically [[Jean Robic]], who had said in an interview that he could beat those Italians easily. Insults were shouted against non-Italians in the Tour, and some windows of French cars were smashed. For safety, and because there were not enough telephone connections for the journalists, most Tour officials and journalists decided to spend the night in Switzerland.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=ddd:010886606:mpeg21:a0054|title=De ronde van Frankrijk: wanorderlijke taferelen|trans-title=Tour de France: disorderly scenes|date=21 July 1949|accessdate=19 April 2017|publisher=Delpher|work=Nieuwsblad van het Noorden|page=3|language=Dutch}}</ref>\n\nWhen the Tour returned to France in the nineteenth stage to Colmar, some French spectators took revenge by throwing tomatoes and rocks towards the Italian cyclists and followers.

Within her mind's Headquarters, five personifications of her basic emotions\u2014Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger\u2014come to life and influence her ways of doing things via a control console. As she grows up, her experiences become memories, stored in colored orbs, which are sent into long-term memory each night. Her five most important \"core memories\" are housed in a hub; each powers an aspect of her personality which takes the form of floating islands. Joy acts as a ''de facto'' leader, and since she and the other emotions do not understand Sadness's purpose, she tries to keep Sadness away from the console.\n\nAt the age of 11, Riley moves with her parents to San Francisco for her father's new job. Riley's first experiences are not good; the new house is cramped and old, the local pizza parlour only serves broccoli as a topping, her father is under stress from his job, and due to a mix-up the moving van with their belongings gets lost and won't arrive for weeks. When Sadness begins touching Riley's happy memories, turning them sad, Joy tries to guard them by isolating her. On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness causes Riley to cry in front of her class, creating Riley's first sad core memory. Joy tries to dispose of it but accidentally knocks the other core memories loose during a struggle with Sadness, deactivating the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are sucked out of Headquarters and sent to long-term memory storage.\n\nIn Joy's absence, Anger, Fear, and Disgust are left in control, with disastrous results, distancing Riley from her parents, friends, and hobbies. As a result, her personality islands gradually crumble and fall into the \"Memory Dump\", where memories are forgotten. Finally, Anger inserts an idea into the console, prompting Riley to run away to Minnesota, believing it will restore her happiness.\n\nWhile navigating through the vast maze-like long-term memory area, Joy and Sadness encounter Bing Bong, Riley's childhood imaginary friend, who suggests riding the \"train of thought\" back to Headquarters. Their route to the train station is fraught with close calls and mishaps as more personality islands crumble. The three eventually catch the train, but it halts when Riley falls asleep, then derails entirely when \"Honesty Island\" collapses with Riley's theft of her mother's credit card. In desperation, Joy abandons Sadness and tries to ride a \"recall tube\" back to Headquarters, but the ground below the tube collapses, breaking it and plunging Joy and Bing Bong into the Memory Dump.\n\nJoy begins to lose hope and breaks into tears, but then discovers a sad memory that turned happy when Riley's parents and friends comforted her. Joy finally understands Sadness's purpose: to induce empathy in others, prompting them to reach out to Riley when she is emotionally overwhelmed and needs help. By preventing Riley from feeling sad, Joy was also keeping her from feeling happiness. Joy and Bing Bong try to use Bing Bong's old wagon rocket to escape the Memory Dump but are unable to fly high enough, as the wagon is too heavy with both of them in it. On their final attempt, Bing Bong jumps out to allow Joy to escape, then fades away.\n\nJoy reunites with Sadness and manages to return to Headquarters, only to discover that Anger's idea has disabled the console, rendering Riley apathetic. To the surprise of the others, Joy hands control of the console to Sadness, who is able to reactivate it, and so make Riley sad that she is leaving her parents, and prompt Riley to return to her new home. As Sadness reinstalls the core memories, Riley arrives home to her parents and tearfully confesses that she misses Minnesota and her old life. Her parents comfort her and admit they also miss Minnesota. Joy and Sadness work the console together, creating a new core memory; a new island forms, representing Riley's acceptance of her new life in San Francisco.\n\nA year later, Riley has adapted to her new home, made new friends, and returned to her old hobbies while acquiring a few new ones. Inside Headquarters, her emotions admire Riley's new personality islands, and all work together on a newly expanded console with room for them all.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Cannes 2015

reserved, and that, frankly, triggered a lot of my own insecurities and fears,\" he said.<ref name=\"nyt\"/> He imagined what happens in the human mind when emotions set in. The idea to depict it through animation excited Docter, who felt it the ideal form to portray \"strong, opinionated, caricatured personalities\".<ref name=\"npr\"/> He began researching information about the mind, alongside Jonas Rivera, a producer, and Ronnie del Carmen, a secondary director. They consulted [[Paul Ekman]], a well-known psychologist who studies emotions, and [[Dacher Keltner]], a professor of psychology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Ekman had early in his career identified six core emotions\u2014anger, fear, sadness, disgust, joy, and [[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]]. Docter found surprise and fear to be too similar, which left him with five emotions to build characters around.<ref name=\"npr\"/> Other emotions considered for inclusion during the development process were [[schadenfreude]], [[boredom|ennui]], pride, and hope.<ref name=\"McKittrick\">{{cite web|url=http://creativescreenwriting.com/is-this-the-best-story-we-can-tell-inside-out/|title=\"Is this the best story we can tell?\" \u2013 Inside Out|last=McKittrick|first=Christopher|date=February 16, 2016|work=Creative Screenwriting|accessdate=February 16, 2016}}</ref> Keltner focused on sadness being an emotion that strengthens relationships.<ref name=\"npr\"/> Both emphasized how emotions organize social lives and the structuring of interpersonal interactions.<ref name=science/>\n\nThe smash success of Docter's 2009 film [[Up (2009 film)|''Up'']] encouraged those at Pixar to allow Docter to create another film with a more sophisticated story.<ref name=\"nyt\"/> ''Inside Out'' is the first Pixar film without input from co-founder and former [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] CEO [[Steve Jobs]], who died in 2011. In addition, the film did not have as much input from chief creative officer [[John Lasseter]], who was focused on restructuring [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] at the time of its production.<ref name=\"nyt\"/> Executives at Disney and Pixar were positive at the proposal of making ''Inside Out'', but acknowledged it would be difficult to market.<ref name=\"lat\"/>\n\n===Story===\nDocter recruited a story crew to help develop the film's plot line. Although animation as an industry had been dominated by men, half of the story crew were women, in an attempt to have more diverse input. The choice to focus the film on a girl came from research that claimed that females age 11 to 17 are more attuned to expressions and emotions than others. The idea to have Riley play hockey came from Del Carmen, who observed that the sport is very popular in Minnesota. Initial ideas for the film found the main character, Riley, falling into a deep depression: Docter later felt they were inappropriate and scrapped them, although in the final film Riley does sink into a depression.<ref name=\"nyt\"/>\n\nThe film was first storyboarded over a period of two to three years, all the while undergoing screenings for Pixar's \"Brain Trust\", a small group of creative leaders at Pixar who oversee development on all films. After multiple screenings and suggestions from other filmmakers, the picture was put into production. It was again evaluated three months into that process. Kevin Nolting, editor of the film, estimated there were seven versions of ''Inside Out'' created before it even went into production.<ref name=\"hr\"/> The story team attempted to create as much contrast with characters as possible.<ref name=\"iw\"/> They found Joy the most complex character to write for, as she illustrates a broad range of \"happy feelings\".<ref name=\"vul\"/> The earliest idea present in the final film is that Joy holds onto youth too long, setting about a \"social storm\" for Riley.<ref name=\"mf\"/> It was not until several screenings later that they came upon the concept of moving to a new place, which created an external conflict that made the story easier to write. Initially, this crisis was to be set at a [[Thanksgiving Day]] pageant, in which Riley was hoping to be cast as its lead role, the turkey. Docter later deemed this idea too \"bizarre\" and it was replaced.<ref name=\"sf\"/>\n\nDocter estimated it took four years of development for the film to achieve success in marrying the architecture of Riley's mind and her personal troubles. The concept of \"personality islands\" helped develop the film's emotional stakes, as they directly affect events inside her mind and in her life. In one draft, the characters fell into \"Idea Fields\", where they would \"cultivate new ideas\", much like a farmer would cultivate crop.<ref name=\"sf\"/> The character of Bing Bong\u2014a discarded old imaginary friend\u2014came about in one draft of the film as part of a refugee camp inside Riley's mind. It was difficult to achieve the correct tone for the film; for example, viewers could not be distracted by Joy's nature or feel negative about the mess she helps steer Riley into. Rivera credited the casting of Amy Poehler, in addition to the idea of moving, with helping the film find the right tone.<ref name=\"mf\">{{cite news|url=http://news.moviefone.com/2015/06/19/inside-out-producer-jonas-rivera-alternate-versions/|date=June 19, 2015|title='Inside Out' Producer Jonas Rivera Reveals Versions of the Movie You'll Never See|author=Drew Taylor|work=MovieFone|accessdate=June 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621015859/http://news.moviefone.com/2015/06/19/inside-out-producer-jonas-rivera-alternate-versions/|archive-date=June 21, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nAn early version of the film focused on Joy and Fear getting lost together, as it seemed to be the most humorous choice.

Within her mind's Headquarters, five personifications of her basic emotions\u2014Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger\u2014come to life and influence her ways of doing things via a control console. As she grows up, her experiences become memories, stored in colored orbs, which are sent into long-term memory each night. Her five most important \"core memories\" are housed in a hub; each powers an aspect of her personality which takes the form of floating islands. Joy acts as a ''de facto'' leader, and since she and the other emotions do not understand Sadness's purpose, she tries to keep Sadness away from the console.\n\nAt the age of 11, Riley moves with her parents to San Francisco for her father's new job. Riley's first experiences are not good; the new house is cramped and old, the local pizza parlour only serves broccoli as a topping, her father is under stress from his job, and due to a mix-up the moving van with their belongings gets lost and won't arrive for weeks. When Sadness begins touching Riley's happy memories, turning them sad, Joy tries to guard them by isolating her. On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness causes Riley to cry in front of her class, creating Riley's first sad core memory. Joy tries to dispose of it but accidentally knocks the other core memories loose during a struggle with Sadness, deactivating the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are sucked out of Headquarters and sent to long-term memory storage.\n\nIn Joy's absence, Anger, Fear, and Disgust are left in control, with disastrous results, distancing Riley from her parents, friends, and hobbies. As a result, her personality islands gradually crumble and fall into the \"Memory Dump\", where memories are forgotten. Finally, Anger inserts an idea into the console, prompting Riley to run away to Minnesota, believing it will restore her happiness.\n\nWhile navigating through the vast maze-like long-term memory area, Joy and Sadness encounter Bing Bong, Riley's childhood imaginary friend, who suggests riding the \"train of thought\" back to Headquarters. Their route to the train station is fraught with close calls and mishaps as more personality islands crumble. The three eventually catch the train, but it halts when Riley falls asleep, then derails entirely when \"Honesty Island\" collapses with Riley's theft of her mother's credit card. In desperation, Joy abandons Sadness and tries to ride a \"recall tube\" back to Headquarters, but the ground below the tube collapses, breaking it and plunging Joy and Bing Bong into the Memory Dump.\n\nJoy begins to lose hope and breaks into tears, but then discovers a sad memory that turned happy when Riley's parents and friends comforted her. Joy finally understands Sadness's purpose: to induce empathy in others, prompting them to reach out to Riley when she is emotionally overwhelmed and needs help. By preventing Riley from feeling sad, Joy was also keeping her from feeling happiness. Joy and Bing Bong try to use Bing Bong's old wagon rocket to escape the Memory Dump but are unable to fly high enough, as the wagon is too heavy with both of them in it. On their final attempt, Bing Bong jumps out to allow Joy to escape, then fades away.\n\nJoy reunites with Sadness and manages to return to Headquarters, only to discover that Anger's idea has disabled the console, rendering Riley apathetic. To the surprise of the others, Joy hands control of the console to Sadness, who is able to reactivate it, and so make Riley sad that she is leaving her parents, and prompt Riley to return to her new home. As Sadness reinstalls the core memories, Riley arrives home to her parents and tearfully confesses that she misses Minnesota and her old life. Her parents comfort her and admit they also miss Minnesota. Joy and Sadness work the console together, creating a new core memory; a new island forms, representing Riley's acceptance of her new life in San Francisco.\n\nA year later, Riley has adapted to her new home, made new friends, and returned to her old hobbies while acquiring a few new ones. Inside Headquarters, her emotions admire Riley's new personality islands, and all work together on a newly expanded console with room for them all.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Cannes 2015

reserved, and that, frankly, triggered a lot of my own insecurities and fears,\" he said.<ref name=\"nyt\"/> He imagined what happens in the human mind when emotions set in. The idea to depict it through animation excited Docter, who felt it the ideal form to portray \"strong, opinionated, caricatured personalities\".<ref name=\"npr\"/> He began researching information about the mind, alongside Jonas Rivera, a producer, and Ronnie del Carmen, a secondary director. They consulted [[Paul Ekman]], a well-known psychologist who studies emotions, and [[Dacher Keltner]], a professor of psychology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Ekman had early in his career identified six core emotions\u2014anger, fear, sadness, disgust, joy, and [[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]]. Docter found surprise and fear to be too similar, which left him with five emotions to build characters around.<ref name=\"npr\"/> Other emotions considered for inclusion during the development process were [[schadenfreude]], [[boredom|ennui]], pride, and hope.<ref name=\"McKittrick\">{{cite web|url=http://creativescreenwriting.com/is-this-the-best-story-we-can-tell-inside-out/|title=\"Is this the best story we can tell?\" \u2013 Inside Out|last=McKittrick|first=Christopher|date=February 16, 2016|work=Creative Screenwriting|accessdate=February 16, 2016}}</ref> Keltner focused on sadness being an emotion that strengthens relationships.<ref name=\"npr\"/> Both emphasized how emotions organize social lives and the structuring of interpersonal interactions.<ref name=science/>\n\nThe smash success of Docter's 2009 film [[Up (2009 film)|''Up'']] encouraged those at Pixar to allow Docter to create another film with a more sophisticated story.<ref name=\"nyt\"/> ''Inside Out'' is the first Pixar film without input from co-founder and former [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] CEO [[Steve Jobs]], who died in 2011. In addition, the film did not have as much input from chief creative officer [[John Lasseter]], who was focused on restructuring [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] at the time of its production.<ref name=\"nyt\"/> Executives at Disney and Pixar were positive at the proposal of making ''Inside Out'', but acknowledged it would be difficult to market.<ref name=\"lat\"/>\n\n===Story===\nDocter recruited a story crew to help develop the film's plot line. Although animation as an industry had been dominated by men, half of the story crew were women, in an attempt to have more diverse input. The choice to focus the film on a girl came from research that claimed that females age 11 to 17 are more attuned to expressions and emotions than others. The idea to have Riley play hockey came from Del Carmen, who observed that the sport is very popular in Minnesota. Initial ideas for the film found the main character, Riley, falling into a deep depression: Docter later felt they were inappropriate and scrapped them, although in the final film Riley does sink into a depression.<ref name=\"nyt\"/>\n\nThe film was first storyboarded over a period of two to three years, all the while undergoing screenings for Pixar's \"Brain Trust\", a small group of creative leaders at Pixar who oversee development on all films. After multiple screenings and suggestions from other filmmakers, the picture was put into production. It was again evaluated three months into that process. Kevin Nolting, editor of the film, estimated there were seven versions of ''Inside Out'' created before it even went into production.<ref name=\"hr\"/> The story team attempted to create as much contrast with characters as possible.<ref name=\"iw\"/> They found Joy the most complex character to write for, as she illustrates a broad range of \"happy feelings\".<ref name=\"vul\"/> The earliest idea present in the final film is that Joy holds onto youth too long, setting about a \"social storm\" for Riley.<ref name=\"mf\"/> It was not until several screenings later that they came upon the concept of moving to a new place, which created an external conflict that made the story easier to write. Initially, this crisis was to be set at a [[Thanksgiving Day]] pageant, in which Riley was hoping to be cast as its lead role, the turkey. Docter later deemed this idea too \"bizarre\" and it was replaced.<ref name=\"sf\"/>\n\nDocter estimated it took four years of development for the film to achieve success in marrying the architecture of Riley's mind and her personal troubles. The concept of \"personality islands\" helped develop the film's emotional stakes, as they directly affect events inside her mind and in her life. In one draft, the characters fell into \"Idea Fields\", where they would \"cultivate new ideas\", much like a farmer would cultivate crop.<ref name=\"sf\"/> The character of Bing Bong\u2014a discarded old imaginary friend\u2014came about in one draft of the film as part of a refugee camp inside Riley's mind. It was difficult to achieve the correct tone for the film; for example, viewers could not be distracted by Joy's nature or feel negative about the mess she helps steer Riley into. Rivera credited the casting of Amy Poehler, in addition to the idea of moving, with helping the film find the right tone.<ref name=\"mf\">{{cite news|url=http://news.moviefone.com/2015/06/19/inside-out-producer-jonas-rivera-alternate-versions/|date=June 19, 2015|title='Inside Out' Producer Jonas Rivera Reveals Versions of the Movie You'll Never See|author=Drew Taylor|work=MovieFone|accessdate=June 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621015859/http://news.moviefone.com/2015/06/19/inside-out-producer-jonas-rivera-alternate-versions/|archive-date=June 21, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nAn early version of the film focused on Joy and Fear getting lost together, as it seemed to be the most humorous choice.

Bartali had almost given up during the race, but drew inspiration from a phone call from the Italian prime minister, who asked him to win the Tour de France to prevent civil unrest in Italy after assassination attempt against  [[Palmiro Togliatti|Togliatti]].

The Italian cyclists were divided between [[Gino Bartali]] and [[Fausto Coppi]]. Both argued in the preparation of the race about who would be the team leader. The Tour organisation wanted to have both cyclists in the race, so they allowed the Italians and Belgians to enter a second team.{{sfn|Maso|2003|p=37}} In the end, Coppi refused to participate, and Bartali became the team leader.{{sfn|Ligget|Raia|Lewis|2005|p=213}} The organisation still allowed the Italians and Belgians to enter a second team, but they were to be composed of young cyclists, and were named the Italy Cadets and the Belgium Aiglons.{{sfn|Maso|2003|p=37}}\n\nThe Tour organisation invited the Swiss to send a team, as they wanted [[Ferdinand K\u00fcbler]], the winner of the 1948 [[Tour de Suisse]], in the race.

When the brothers [[Georges Aeschlimann|Georges]] and [[Roger Aeschlimann]] announced that they wanted to join the race, they were quickly accepted, especially because they were from Lausanne, where the Tour would pass through.

Among that group was [[Louison Bobet]], and as he was the best-placed cyclist in that group he became the next leader. Also in that group was [[Roger Lambrecht]]; when Lambrecht again was able to be in the first group in the fourth stage, he took the lead, becoming the fourth rider in four stages to don the yellow jersey. Lambrecht kept it in the next stage, but after Bobet won the sixth stage, Bobet took back the lead, and the yellow jersey made him confident.{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=56}} In the Pyren\u00e9es, Bartali won both stages in a sprint, but Bobet was near and became the hero of the French spectators.{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=56}}\n\nAfter the ninth stage, Bobet had built up a lead of more than nine minutes. In the tenth stage, he lost time, and Belgian cyclist [[Roger Lambrecht]] reduced the margin to 29 seconds. After the eleventh stage, Bobet was still in the lead, but was having problems, and after he fainted at the finish, he wanted to give up.

[[Alcide De Gasperi]], prime minister of Italy, from the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democratic party]], told him that a few days earlier [[Palmiro Togliatti]], leader of the [[Italian Communist Party]], had been shot, and Italy might be on the edge of a civil war. De Gasperi asked Bartali to do his best to win a stage, because the sport news might distract people from the politics. Bartali replied that he would do better, and win the race.<ref name=\"veloarchive\"/>\nThe next day, Bartali won stage 13 with a large margin. In the general classification, he jumped to second place, trailing by only 66 seconds.

It consisted of 21 stages over {{convert|4922|km|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe race was won by Italian cyclist [[Gino Bartali]], who had also won the Tour de France in 1938. Bartali had almost given up during the race, but drew inspiration from a phone call from the Italian prime minister, who asked him to win the Tour de France to prevent civil unrest in Italy after assassination attempt against  [[Palmiro Togliatti|Togliatti]]. Bartali also won the [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]], while the [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]] was won by the Belgian team.\n\n==Changes from the previous Tour==\nThe prize for wearing the yellow jersey was introduced in 1948,<ref name=\"mdc1948\"/> sponsored by Les Laines, a French wool company.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=49}} In 1947, the media had complained that too many cyclists reached the end of the race, so the race was no longer heroic; this may have motivated a new rule between the third and the eighteenth stage, the rider last in the general classification was eliminated;<ref name=\"mdc1948\"/>{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=115}} Where as the 1947 Tour de France had been France-centred, the 1948 race became a more cosmopolitan race.{{sfn|Dauncey|Hare|2003|p=213}}\n\nThe Tour visited the [[Saar (protectorate)|Saar protectorate]] for the first time when the 18th stage passed [[Saarbr\u00fccken]] and [[Saarlouis]].

The Italian cyclists were divided between [[Gino Bartali]] and [[Fausto Coppi]]. Both argued in the preparation of the race about who would be the team leader. The Tour organisation wanted to have both cyclists in the race, so they allowed the Italians and Belgians to enter a second team.{{sfn|Maso|2003|p=37}} In the end, Coppi refused to participate, and Bartali became the team leader.{{sfn|Ligget|Raia|Lewis|2005|p=213}} The organisation still allowed the Italians and Belgians to enter a second team, but they were to be composed of young cyclists, and were named the Italy Cadets and the Belgium Aiglons.{{sfn|Maso|2003|p=37}}\n\nThe Tour organisation invited the Swiss to send a team, as they wanted [[Ferdinand K\u00fcbler]], the winner of the 1948 [[Tour de Suisse]], in the race. K\u00fcbler refused this because he could earn more money in other races. When the brothers [[Georges Aeschlimann|Georges]] and [[Roger Aeschlimann]] announced that they wanted to join the race, they were quickly accepted, especially because they were from Lausanne, where the Tour would pass through.

Among that group was [[Louison Bobet]], and as he was the best-placed cyclist in that group he became the next leader. Also in that group was [[Roger Lambrecht]]; when Lambrecht again was able to be in the first group in the fourth stage, he took the lead, becoming the fourth rider in four stages to don the yellow jersey. Lambrecht kept it in the next stage, but after Bobet won the sixth stage, Bobet took back the lead, and the yellow jersey made him confident.{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=56}} In the Pyren\u00e9es, Bartali won both stages in a sprint, but Bobet was near and became the hero of the French spectators.{{sfn|Amels|1984|p=56}}\n\nAfter the ninth stage, Bobet had built up a lead of more than nine minutes. In the tenth stage, he lost time, and Belgian cyclist [[Roger Lambrecht]] reduced the margin to 29 seconds.

[[Alcide De Gasperi]], prime minister of Italy, from the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democratic party]], told him that a few days earlier [[Palmiro Togliatti]], leader of the [[Italian Communist Party]], had been shot, and Italy might be on the edge of a civil war. De Gasperi asked Bartali to do his best to win a stage, because the sport news might distract people from the politics. Bartali replied that he would do better, and win the race.<ref name=\"veloarchive\"/>\nThe next day, Bartali won stage 13 with a large margin. In the general classification, he jumped to second place, trailing by only 66 seconds.

Bartali won again, and took over the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification. Bobet was now in second place, eight minutes behind. The next stage, stage 15, was also won by Bartali.\nThe sixteenth stage was not won by Bartali, but because his direct competitors lost time, he increased his lead to 32 minutes.<ref name=\"veloarchive\"/> Bartali lost minutes in the time trial in stage 17, but his lead was never endangered.\n\nWith each stage win of Bartali (seven in total), the Italian excitement about the Tour de France increased, and the political tensions quieted.<ref name=\"revealed\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingrevealed.com/timeline/Race%20Snippets/TdF/TdF1948.htm|title=Gino \"the Pious,\" an Inspirational Win|author=Barry Boyce|year=2004|accessdate=2 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Classification leadership and minor prizes==\n\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish each stage was recorded, and these times were added together for the [[general classification in the Tour de France|general classification]].
