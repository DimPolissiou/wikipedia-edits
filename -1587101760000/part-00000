A right arm medium pace [[Bowling (cricket)|bowler]], he played in two [[International Cricket Council|ICC]] Trophy tournaments for his country. He was also a member of the Bangladesh team that took part in the 2nd [[Asia Cup]] in [[Sri Lanka]], in 1986. However, he didn't play in any of the matches, and never played any full ODI match.<ref>Hasan Babli. \"Antorjartik Crickete Bangladesh\".  Khelar Bhuban Prakashani, November 1994.</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nAlthough Saad played for the Central Zone against the touring Lankan side in January 1978, it was only during the 1981\u201392 season that he caught the full attention of the national selectors. A match winning haul of five [[wicket]]s for Mohammedan MSC against their archrivals Abahani KC in the League title decider pushed him into the limelight. However, after being selected for the [[ICC Trophy]] in England (1982), he played only one match there.\n\nSaad's best performance for the national side came during the tour of [[Bangladeshi cricket team in Pakistan in 1986|Pakistan]] in March 1986. He finished the tour with seven wickets at an impressive average of 16.14 per wicket. His best 4/50 came against a strong [[Lahore]] side.\n\n==In ICC Trophy==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\" width=\"80%\"\n|-\n\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | Year\n!| Matches\n!| Runs\n!| Wickets\n!| Average\n!| Best\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | 1982\n||1\n||4\n||0\n||-\n||-\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | 1986\n||2\n||39\n||1\n||39.00\n||1/19\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Overall\n||3\n||43\n||1\n||43.00\n||1/19\n|}\nThe record above isn't very impressive, but he was given little opportunity to prove his worth to the side. His best, 1/19 (from 12 overs) helped Bangladesh beat [[Kenya]] in a low scoring affair. But, for no explicable reason, he was dropped from the side for the next match against [[Malaysia]]. Ironically, the two matches that he played in the tournament, against Kenya and [[Argentina]], were the only matches that the Bangladesh team won in the tournament.
