He is the eighth-highest scorer in ABA/NBA history with 30,026 points (NBA and ABA combined).  He was well known for [[slam dunk]]ing from the free throw line in [[Slam Dunk Contest|slam dunk contests]] and was the only player voted Most Valuable Player in both the ABA and the NBA. The basketball slang of being [[posterized]] was first coined to describe his moves.\n\nErving was inducted in 1993 into the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] and was also named to the [[NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time team]]. In 1994, Erving was named by ''Sports Illustrated'' as one of the 40 most important athletes of all time. In 2004, he was inducted into the [[Nassau County Sports Hall of Fame]].\n\nMany consider him one of the most talented players in the history of the NBA; he is widely acknowledged as one of the game's best dunkers. While [[Connie Hawkins]], [[Johnny Green (basketball)|\"Jumping\" Johnny Green]], [[Elgin Baylor]], [[Jim Pollard]], and [[Gus Johnson (basketball)|Gus Johnson]] performed spectacular dunks before Erving's time, Erving brought the practice into the mainstream.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/12/sports/basketball/12dunk.html?_r=0 For Some N.B.A. Players, There\u2019s No Such Thing as a Slam Dunk], ''The New York Times''</ref> His signature [[Slam dunk|dunk]] was the \"slam\" dunk, since incorporated into the vernacular and basic skill set of the game in the same manner as the \"crossover\" dribble and the \"no look\" pass. Before Erving, dunking was a practice most commonly used by the big men (usually standing close to the hoop) to show their brutal strength which was seen as style over substance, even unsportsmanlike, by many purists of the game.<ref>J.

However, playing with other stars-such as former ABA standout [[George McInnes]], future NBA All-Star [[World B.

He also starred in the 1979 basketball comedy film, ''[[The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh]]''.\n\nIn the following years, Erving coped with a team that was not yet playing at his level. It took a few years for the Sixers franchise to build around Erving. Eventually coach [[Billy Cunningham]] and top-level players like [[Maurice Cheeks]], [[Andrew Toney]], and [[Bobby Jones (basketball, born 1951)|Bobby Jones]] were added to the mix and the franchise was very successful. \n\nThe Sixers were still eliminated twice in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] Finals.

The Bird vs. Erving matchup became arguably the top personal rivalry in the sport (along with Bird vs. [[Magic Johnson]]), inspiring the early [[Electronic Arts]] [[video game]] ''[[One on One: Dr. J vs. Larry Bird]]''.\n\nIn 1980, the 76ers prevailed over the Celtics to advance to [[1980 NBA Finals|the NBA Finals]] against the [[1979\u201380 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]]. There, Erving executed the legendary \"Baseline Move\", a behind-the-board reverse layup. However, the Lakers won 4\u20132 with superb play from, among others, Magic Johnson.\n\nErving again was among the league's best players in the 1980\u20131981 and 1981\u20131982 seasons, although more disappointment came as the Sixers stumbled twice in the playoffs: in 1981, the [[1980\u201381 Boston Celtics season|Celtics]] eliminated them in seven games in the 1981 Eastern Finals after [[1981\u201382 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia]] had a 3\u20131 series lead, but lost both Game 5 and Game 6 by 2 points and the deciding Game 7 by 1) and in 1982, the Sixers managed to beat the defending champion Celtics in seven games in the 1982 Eastern Finals but lost the NBA Finals to the [[1981\u201382 Los Angeles Lakers season|Los Angeles Lakers]] in six games.  Despite these defeats, Erving was named the NBA [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] in 1981 and was again voted to the 1982 All-NBA First Team.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/nba/history/awards/_/year/1982 1982 NBA Awards]</ref>\n\nFinally, for the [[1982\u201383 NBA season|1982\u201383 season]], the Sixers obtained the missing element to combat their weakness at their center position, [[Moses Malone]]. Armed with one of the most formidable and unstoppable center-forward combinations of all time, the [[1982\u201383 Philadelphia 76ers season|Sixers]] dominated the whole season, prompting Malone to make the famous playoff prediction of \"fo-fo-fo (four-four-four)\" in anticipation of the 76ers sweeping the three rounds of the playoffs en route to an NBA title.<ref>[http://www.slamonline.com/online/nba/2010/11/original-old-school-first-and-foremost/ Original Old School: First and Foremost SLAM 72: From high school to the pros, Moses Malone was on another level], by Alan Paul published in ''SLAM'', June 2003</ref>  In fact, the Sixers went four-five-four, losing one game to the [[1982\u201383 Milwaukee Bucks season|Milwaukee Bucks]] in the conference finals, then sweeping the [[1982\u201383 Los Angeles Lakers season|Lakers]] to win the NBA title.\n\nErving maintained his all-star caliber of play into his twilight years, averaging 22.4, 20.0, 18.1, and 16.8 points per game in his final seasons.{{citation needed|date = June 2012}}  In 1986, he announced that he would retire after the season, causing every game he played to be sold out with adoring fans.{{citation needed|date = June 2012}}  That final season saw opposing teams pay tribute to Erving in the last game Erving would play in their arenas, including in cities such as Boston and Los Angeles, his perennial rivals in the playoffs.{{citation needed|date = June 2012}}\n\n===Career summary===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=February 2013}}\nErving retired in 1987 at the age of 37.  \"A young Julius Erving was like Thomas Edison, he was always inventing something new every night\", [[Johnny Kerr]] told ABA historian [[Terry Pluto]]. He is also one of the few players in modern basketball to have his number retired by two franchises: the Brooklyn Nets (formerly the New York Nets and New Jersey Nets) have retired his No. 32 jersey, and the Philadelphia 76ers his No. 6 jersey. He was an excellent all around player who was also an underrated defender. In his ABA days, he would guard the best forward, whether small forward or power forward, for over 40 minutes a game, and simultaneously be the best passer, ball handler, and clutch scorer every night. Many of Erving's acrobatic highlight feats and clutch moments were unknown because of the ABA's scant television coverage. He is considered by many as the greatest dunker of all time.\n\nIn his ABA and NBA careers combined, he scored more than 30,000 points. In 1993, Erving was elected to the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]]. When he retired, Erving ranked in the top 5 in scoring (third), field goals made (third), field goals attempted (fifth) and steals (first). On the combined NBA/ABA scoring list, Erving ranked third with 30,026 points. {{As of|2019}}, Erving ranks eighth on the list, behind only [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], [[Karl Malone]], [[LeBron James]], [[Kobe Bryant]], [[Michael Jordan]], [[Dirk Nowitzki]], and [[Wilt Chamberlain]].\n\n==Feats==\n\n===1976 ABA Slam Dunk Contest===\n[[file:Philadelphia Sports Statues 10.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Erving statue in South Philadelphia]]\n{{BLP sources section|date=February 2013}}\nErving in this memorable contest would face [[George Gervin|George \"The Iceman\" Gervin]], All-Star and former teammate [[Larry Kenon|Larry \"Special K\" Kenon]], MVP [[Artis Gilmore|Artis \"The A-Train\" Gilmore]], and [[David Thompson (basketball)|David \"The Skywalker\" Thompson]]. Erving would start by dunking two balls in the hoop. Then, he would release a move that brought the slam dunk contest to the national consciousness. He would go all the way to the end of the court and run to release a free throw line dunk. Although dunking from the foul line had been done by other players ([[Jim Pollard]] and [[Wilt Chamberlain]] in the 1950s, for example), Erving introduced the dunk jumping off the foul line to a wide audience, when he demonstrated the feat in the [[1976 ABA All-Star Game]] Dunking Contest.\n\n===Dunk over Bill Walton===\nThis event transpired during game 6 of the [[1977 NBA Finals]]. After Portland scored a basket, Erving immediately ran the length of the court with the entire Blazers team defending him. He performed a crossover to blow by multiple defenders and seemingly glided to the hoop with ease. With UCLA defensive legend [[Bill Walton]] waiting in the post, Erving threw down a vicious slam dunk over Walton's outstretched arms. This dunk is considered by many to be one of the strongest dunks ever attempted considering he ran full court with all five defenders running with him. This move was one of the highlights of his arrival to a more television-exposed NBA.\n\n===The Baseline Move===\nOne of his most memorable plays occurred during the [[1980 NBA Finals]], when he executed a seemingly impossible finger-roll behind the backboard.<ref>{{YouTube|NjdEP7I2fRA|1980: Dr.J Baseline Scoop}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/erving_moment.html |title=Doctor's Shot Stuns Lakers |publisher=NBA.com |date= |accessdate=March 22, 2011}}</ref> He drove past Lakers forward [[Mark Landsberger]] on the right baseline and went in for a [[layup]]. Then 7\u20322\u2033 center [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] crossed his way, blocking the route to the basket and forcing him outwards. In mid-air, it was apparent that Erving would land behind the backboard. But somehow he managed to reach over and score on a right-handed layup despite the fact that his whole body, including his left shoulder, was already behind the hoop. This move, along with his free-throw line dunk, has become one of the signature events of his career. It was called by ''Sports Illustrated'', \"The, No Way, even for Dr J, Flying Reverse Lay-up\". Dr J called it \"just another move\".\n\n===Rock The Baby over Michael Cooper===\nAnother of Erving's most memorable plays came in the final moments of a regular-season game against the Los Angeles Lakers in 1983. After Sixers point guard [[Maurice Cheeks]] deflected a pass by Lakers forward [[James Worthy]], Erving picked up the ball and charged down the court's left side, with one defender to beat\u2014the Lakers' top defender [[Michael Cooper]].  As he came inside of the 3-point line, he cupped the ball into his wrist and forearm, rocking the ball back and forth  before taking off for what Lakers radio broadcaster [[Chick Hearn]] best described as a \"Rock The Baby\" [[slam dunk]]: he slung the ball around behind his head and dunked over a ducking Cooper. This dunk is generally regarded as one of the greatest dunks of all time.<ref>{{YouTube|SrlBgLdGKZM|Dr J's famous \"Rock The Baby Dunk\" Against Lakers}}</ref>\n\n==Post-basketball career==\n[[File:Basketball Legends.jpg|thumb|210px|left|Erving (top left) with other former NBA players visit the New York [[NBA Store]] in January 2005]]\nErving earned his bachelor's degree in 1986 through the [[University Without Walls]] at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]].<ref>UMASS Alumni Association, http://www.umassalumni.com/membership/notable.html</ref><ref>NBA, Legends in Business Q&A, http://www.nba.com/careers/legends__erving.html</ref><ref>Business West, Breaking Down the Barriers, December 1, 2004, http://www.allbusiness.com/specialty-businesses/1074099-1.html</ref> After his basketball career ended, he became a businessman, obtaining ownership of a [[Coca-Cola]] bottling plant in [[Philadelphia]] and doing work as a television analyst.

While [[Connie Hawkins]], [[Johnny Green (basketball)|\"Jumping\" Johnny Green]], [[Elgin Baylor]], [[Jim Pollard]], and [[Gus Johnson (basketball)|Gus Johnson]] performed spectacular dunks before Erving's time, Erving brought the practice into the mainstream.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/12/sports/basketball/12dunk.html?_r=0 For Some N.B.A. Players, There\u2019s No Such Thing as a Slam Dunk], ''The New York Times''</ref> His signature [[Slam dunk|dunk]] was the \"slam\" dunk, since incorporated into the vernacular and basic skill set of the game in the same manner as the \"crossover\" dribble and the \"no look\" pass. Before Erving, dunking was a practice most commonly used by the big men (usually standing close to the hoop) to show their brutal strength which was seen as style over substance, even unsportsmanlike, by many purists of the game.<ref>J.

He was an excellent all around player who was also an underrated defender. In his ABA days, he would guard the best forward, whether small forward or power forward, for over 40 minutes a game, and simultaneously be the best passer, ball handler, and clutch scorer every night.

When he retired, Erving ranked in the top 5 in scoring (third), field goals made (third), field goals attempted (fifth) and steals (first). On the combined NBA/ABA scoring list, Erving ranked third with 30,026 points. {{As of|2019}}, Erving ranks eighth on the list, behind only [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], [[Karl Malone]], [[LeBron James]], [[Kobe Bryant]], [[Michael Jordan]], [[Dirk Nowitzki]], and [[Wilt Chamberlain]].\n\n==Feats==\n\n===1976 ABA Slam Dunk Contest===\n[[file:Philadelphia Sports Statues 10.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Erving statue in South Philadelphia]]\n{{BLP sources section|date=February 2013}}\nErving in this memorable contest would face [[George Gervin|George \"The Iceman\" Gervin]], All-Star and former teammate [[Larry Kenon|Larry \"Special K\" Kenon]], MVP [[Artis Gilmore|Artis \"The A-Train\" Gilmore]], and [[David Thompson (basketball)|David \"The Skywalker\" Thompson]]. Erving would start by dunking two balls in the hoop. Then, he would release a move that brought the slam dunk contest to the national consciousness. He would go all the way to the end of the court and run to release a free throw line dunk. Although dunking from the foul line had been done by other players ([[Jim Pollard]] and [[Wilt Chamberlain]] in the 1950s, for example), Erving introduced the dunk jumping off the foul line to a wide audience, when he demonstrated the feat in the [[1976 ABA All-Star Game]] Dunking Contest.\n\n===Dunk over Bill Walton===\nThis event transpired during game 6 of the [[1977 NBA Finals]]. After Portland scored a basket, Erving immediately ran the length of the court with the entire Blazers team defending him. He performed a crossover to blow by multiple defenders and seemingly glided to the hoop with ease. With UCLA defensive legend [[Bill Walton]] waiting in the post, Erving threw down a vicious slam dunk over Walton's outstretched arms. This dunk is considered by many to be one of the strongest dunks ever attempted considering he ran full court with all five defenders running with him. This move was one of the highlights of his arrival to a more television-exposed NBA.\n\n===The Baseline Move===\nOne of his most memorable plays occurred during the [[1980 NBA Finals]], when he executed a seemingly impossible finger-roll behind the backboard.<ref>{{YouTube|NjdEP7I2fRA|1980: Dr.J Baseline Scoop}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/erving_moment.html |title=Doctor's Shot Stuns Lakers |publisher=NBA.com |date= |accessdate=March 22, 2011}}</ref> He drove past Lakers forward [[Mark Landsberger]] on the right baseline and went in for a [[layup]]. Then 7\u20322\u2033 center [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] crossed his way, blocking the route to the basket and forcing him outwards. In mid-air, it was apparent that Erving would land behind the backboard. But somehow he managed to reach over and score on a right-handed layup despite the fact that his whole body, including his left shoulder, was already behind the hoop. This move, along with his free-throw line dunk, has become one of the signature events of his career. It was called by ''Sports Illustrated'', \"The, No Way, even for Dr J, Flying Reverse Lay-up\". Dr J called it \"just another move\".\n\n===Rock The Baby over Michael Cooper===\nAnother of Erving's most memorable plays came in the final moments of a regular-season game against the Los Angeles Lakers in 1983. After Sixers point guard [[Maurice Cheeks]] deflected a pass by Lakers forward [[James Worthy]], Erving picked up the ball and charged down the court's left side, with one defender to beat\u2014the Lakers' top defender [[Michael Cooper]].  As he came inside of the 3-point line, he cupped the ball into his wrist and forearm, rocking the ball back and forth  before taking off for what Lakers radio broadcaster [[Chick Hearn]] best described as a \"Rock The Baby\" [[slam dunk]]: he slung the ball around behind his head and dunked over a ducking Cooper. This dunk is generally regarded as one of the greatest dunks of all time.<ref>{{YouTube|SrlBgLdGKZM|Dr J's famous \"Rock The Baby Dunk\" Against Lakers}}</ref>\n\n==Post-basketball career==\n[[File:Basketball Legends.jpg|thumb|210px|left|Erving (top left) with other former NBA players visit the New York [[NBA Store]] in January 2005]]\nErving earned his bachelor's degree in 1986 through the [[University Without Walls]] at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]].<ref>UMASS Alumni Association, http://www.umassalumni.com/membership/notable.html</ref><ref>NBA, Legends in Business Q&A, http://www.nba.com/careers/legends__erving.html</ref><ref>Business West, Breaking Down the Barriers, December 1, 2004, http://www.allbusiness.com/specialty-businesses/1074099-1.html</ref> After his basketball career ended, he became a businessman, obtaining ownership of a [[Coca-Cola]] bottling plant in [[Philadelphia]] and doing work as a television analyst.

The more traditional colour of social democracy is red (because social democracy is descended from the democratic socialist movement), but some countries have large social democratic parties alongside large socialist or communist parties, so that it would be confusing for them all to use red. In such cases, social democrats are usually the ones who give up red in favor of a different colour. Pink is often chosen because it is seen as a softer, less aggressive version of red, in the same way that social democracy is more centrist and less militant than socialism. This is also the origin of the colloquial term \"[[pinko]]\".\n*In [[Brazil]], Pink is sometimes used by [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|Democratic Labour Party]], a [[centre-left]] to [[left-wing nationalist]] political party member of [[Socialist International]].\n* Some European liberal parties use pink or magenta as their party colour.

This color is chosen because those movements consider themselves to be mixing the best ideas of the [[left-wing politics|left]] (associated with red) and the [[right-wing politics|right]] (associated with blue)\n*In Canada, navy purple is the colour used by the right-wing [[People's Party of Canada]].\n* In Europe, purple tends to be used for movements, parties and governments that are neither clearly right nor left.\n** It has been used to represent the [[Purple (government)|Purple governments]] of [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], formed by an alliance of red social-democratic and blue liberal parties.\n** The pan-European movement [[Volt Europa]] has adopted purple as its main party colour since its foundation, symbolising dynamic youthfulness and transparency.\n* In Italy, purple has been adopted by anti-[[Silvio Berlusconi]] protesters (see [[Purple People]]) as an alternative from other colours and political parties.\n* In Ireland, purple is the colour of the [[Social Democrats (Ireland)|Social Democrats]] which supports a [[Nordic model]] of social democracy.\n* In Mexico, purple is the colour of the [[Humanist Party (Mexico)|Humanist Party]].\n* In Poland, purple is the colour of [[Razem|Partia Razem]], a new left-wing social-democratic political party formed in 2015.\n* In Romania, purple was used by the populist and eurosceptic [[People's Party \u2013 Dan Diaconescu]], active between 2011\u20132015.\n* In Spain, purple is the colour of [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]], a left-wing party that emerged from the [[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|15-M Movement]] protests.\n* Purple is the colour of the Swedish [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|Pirate Party]] and Icelandic [[Pirate Party (Iceland)|Pirate Party]], as well as several [[List of Pirate Parties|international Pirate parties]] share the colour along with black. \n* In the United Kingdom, purple is associated with Euroscepticism, being the official colours of the [[UK Independence Party]] (along with yellow) and the minor party [[Veritas (political party)|Veritas]].\n* In the United States, purple is the official colour of [[centrism]], the [[American Independent Party]], a \"[[swing state]]\", the [[Veterans Party of America]], and the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]]\n** Also the color of social democratic [[Vermont Progressive Party]].{{Dubious||date=July 2019}}\n** Purple is also unofficially used in the United States to denote a \"swing state\" (i.e. one contested frequently between the Republican Party, whose unofficial colour is red; and the Democratic Party, whose unofficial colour is blue). Purple is also used by [[centrism|centrists]] to represent a combination of beliefs belonging to the Republicans (red) and the Democrats (blue). It has also been used to reference [[Purple America]], a term used in contrast to \"blue\" or \"red\", noting the electoral differences nationwide are observed more on discrepancies instead of unity (see [[red states and blue states]]).\n* In Uruguay, purple is the colour of the social democratic [[Independent Party (Uruguay)|Independent Party]].\n* In Venezuela, purple is use by socialist [[People's Electoral Movement (Venezuela)|People's Electoral Movement]].\n\n== Red ==\n[[Red]] is traditionally associated with [[socialism]] and [[communism]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The oldest symbol of socialism (and by extension communism) is the [[Red flag (politics)|Red Flag]], which dates back to the French Revolution in the 18th century and the [[revolutions of 1848]]. Before this nascence, the colour red was generally associated with [[monarchy]] or the Church due to the symbolism and association of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]'s blood. The colour red was chosen to represent the blood of the workers who died in the struggle against capitalism. All major socialist and communist alliances and organisations\u2014including the [[First International|First]], [[Second International|Second]], [[Comintern|Third]] and [[Fourth International|Fourth]] Internationals\u2014used red as their official colour. The association between the colour red and communism is particularly strong. Communists use red much more often and more extensively than other ideologies use their respective traditional colours.\n\n* In Europe and Latin America, red is also associated with parties of [[social democracy]] and often their allies within the [[labour movement]]. Sometimes these parties use pink instead, as a \"moderate\" colour instead of the more \"radical\" red, or \"pink\" used to describe the more moderate faction or membership within a left-wing party.\n* Red is also the traditional colour of liberal parties in Latin America and was the colour use, for example, in Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Uruguay for liberal parties. However, these parties follow [[social liberalism]] more than [[classic liberalism]], thus seating in the centre-left. \n* In the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland, red is also the colour of the labour movement and the Labour (spelled Labor in Australia) parties in those countries. The use of red as a symbol is referenced in the British Labour Party's anthem, ''[[The Red Flag]]''.<ref name=\"Hitchens2010\">{{cite book|author=Peter Hitchens|title=The Cameron Delusion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8WvOBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA181|date=26 March 2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-2390-9|page=181}}</ref>\n** In the heyday of the British Empire before 1960, maps, globes, and atlases typically used red or pink to designate the [[British Empire]] or its Commonwealth.<ref>{{cite book|author=Arthur Jay Klinghoffer|title=The Power of Projections: How Maps Reflect Global Politics and History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WhyPBHJV5VYC&pg=PA79|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood|page=79|isbn=9780275991357}}</ref> As soon as a colony became independent, it needed its own distinctive color and the practice died out.\n* In [[Brazil]], red is so strongly associated with the [[left-wing populist]] [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]], the communists [[PCdoB]] and [[Brazilian Communist Party|PCB]] and with the [[far-left]] that different left-wing movements choose not to use red as a main color in order to give themselves a distinct identity. The [[PSOL]] and the [[Brazilian Socialist Party]] invert the traditional color schemes of left-wing political parties and use red as a secondary color with yellow, orange or white being their primary color. [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|Democratic Labour Party]] uses blue, red, pink and white as main colors.\n* Also in Brazil, red combined with black and white was formerly associated with [[Brazilian nationalism]]. The first incarnation of the [[agrarianist]]-[[centrist]] [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 1945-65)|Social Democratic Party]], both incarnations of the Brazilian Labour Party (the [[Brazilian Labour Party (historical)|first]] a [[social democratic]] party, the [[Brazilian Labour Party (current)|current]] a [[populist]] one) and the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]] use this color scheme. Red, Black and White are associated with the three races which form the ethnic composition of Brazil: the [[Amerindians]] (Red), the [[Afro-Brazilians]] (Black) and [[White Brazilians]].\n* Belize's main conservative party ([[United Democratic Party (Belize)|United Democratic Party]]) is represented by the red colour.\n* In Canada, red has always been associated with the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] because one of its predecessors was the ''[[Parti rouge]]'' (French for \"Red Party\").\n* Japan's [[buddhist]] party [[Komeito]] has a red sun as flag. \n* The [[Colorado Party (Paraguay)|Colorado Party]] of Paraguay, a right-wing conservative party, uses red while its main rival the liberal [[Radical Liberal Party (Paraguay)|Partido Liberal Radical]] uses blue, contrary to the rest of Latin America.\n* The [[Liberty Korea Party]], which was the dominant [[Conservatism in South Korea|conservative]] party in [[South Korea]], used red as their official colour. Before 2012, the conservative parties used blue as their official colour.\n* In [[Spain]] red is associated with communism, socialism and social democracy. The social democrat party [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]] and the leftist coalition [[United Left (Spain)|Izquierda Unida]] use red.\n* In [[Sweden]] red is associated with leftism, socialism and social democracy. The [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party]] and the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party]] use red.\n* In Thailand, the Red Shirt movement derives its populist base from amongst the working class and rural communities, which oppose the established power elite in Bangkok.\n* A key exception to the convention of red to mean socialism is the United States. Since about the year 2000, the mass media have associated red with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], despite the fact that the Republican Party is a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] party (see [[red states and blue states]]).<ref name=\"David Starkey 2007\">{{cite book|author=David Starkey|title=Living Blue in the Red States|publisher=University Press of Nebraska|year=2007}}</ref> This use is probably entrenched as many political organisations (for example the website [[RedState]]) now use the term.

Before them, this colour was used by the [[Europe of Freedom and Democracy]] group.\n* In Brazil, Turquoise is used as the main color of [[Rede Sustentabilidade|Sustaintability Network]], a progressive political party\n\n== White ==\n[[White]] is today mainly linked to [[pacifism]] (as in the [[White flag|surrender flag]])<ref name=\":0\" /> and in politics of the United Kingdom to independent politicians such as [[Martin Bell]].\n\n* Historically, it was associated with support for [[absolute monarchy]], starting with the supporters of the [[Bourbon dynasty]] of France because it was the dynasty's colour. Later it was used by the [[White movement|Whites]] who fought against the communist \"Reds\" in the [[Russian Civil War]], because some of the Russian \"Whites\" had similar goals to the French \"Whites\" of a century earlier (although, it is worth noting that the Whites included many different people with many ideologies, such as monarchists, liberals, and others).\n** Because of its use by anti-communist forces in Russia, the colour white came to be associated in the 20th century with many different [[anti-communist]] and counter-revolutionary groups, even those that did not support absolute monarchy (for example, the Finnish \"[[Whites (Finland)|Whites]]\" who fought against the socialist \"[[Red Guards (Finland)|Reds]]\" in the civil war following the [[independence of Finland]]). In some revolutions, red is used to represent the revolutionaries and white is used to represent the supporters of the old order, regardless of the ideologies or goals of the two sides.\n* In Italy a red cross on a white shield (''scudo crociato'') is the emblem of Catholic parties from the historical [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] party.\n* In [[Politics of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], the [[Taliban]] reversed the Islamist schema, using black shahada on a white background (symbol of purity).\n* In [[Singapore]], white is the colour associated with the [[People's Action Party]], the party that has been in power and dominating the Parliament since the country's independence.\n* In Uruguay, the conservative [[National Party (Uruguay)|National Party]] is also known as \"White Party\", counterpart of the liberal \"[[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Red Party]]\" during the [[two-party system|two-party era]].\n* In [[Venezuela]], white has been the traditional colour of the [[Democratic Action (Venezuela)|Democratic Action]] party, one of the two parties that dominated the country's politics in the late 20th century (alongside [[Copei]]) and one of the parties currently in opposition to the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela|PSUV]].\n\n== Yellow ==\n[[Yellow]] used to be the colour most commonly associated with [[liberalism]] and [[right-libertarianism]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Color Design Workbook: A Real World Guide to Using Color in Graphic Design|last=Adams|first=Sean|last2=Morioka|first2=Noreen|last3=Stone|first3=Terry Lee|date=2006|publisher=Rockport Publishers|isbn=159253192X|location=Gloucester, Mass.|pages=[https://archive.org/details/colordesignworkb0000ston/page/86 86]|oclc=60393965|url=https://archive.org/details/colordesignworkb0000ston/page/86}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Rohit Vishal|last2=Joshi|first2=Radhika|date=October-December 2006|title=Colour, Colour Everywhere: In Marketing Too|journal=SCMS Journal of Indian Management|volume=3|issue=4|pages=40\u201346|issn=0973-3167|ssrn=969272}}</ref><ref>Cassel-Picot, Muriel \"The Liberal Democrats and the Green Cause: From Yellow to Green\" in Leydier, Gilles and Martin, Alexia (2013) ''Environmental Issues in Political Discourse in Britain and Ireland''.

For instance, in [[Thailand]] yellow represents [[Monarchy of Thailand|King]] [[Bhumibol]]. It was also the colour of the pro-monarchy [[Panchayat (Nepal)|Panchayat]] system in the [[Kingdom of Nepal]].\n* It is also a common colour to represent [[Buddhism]], monks in [[Burma]] used it in the [[Saffron Revolution|anti-government protests]].\n* In Argentina, yellow is the colour for liberal right-wing party [[Republican Proposal]], led by [[Mauricio Macri]].\n* In [[Brazil]], yellow, combined with green, is associated with right-wing movements [[anti-corruption|against corruption]], anti-[[Workers Party (Brazil)|Workers Party]], supportive of [[impeachment of Dilma Rousseff]] and later, with support of [[Jair Bolsonaro presidential campaign, 2018|Jair Bolsonaro]], like [[Partido Social Liberal|PSL]] and the [[Alliance for Brazil]]. The association came because many of the protesters against Dilma wears the jersey of [[Brazilian national football team]], which is yellow with the numbers and some details in green, and because the protesters chanted that [[brazilian flag]] \"will never be red\" and \"will be always green and yellow\". Red is the color of [[left-wing populist]] Workers' Party.\n* In Colombia, yellow is the colour of left-wing party [[Alternative Democratic Pole]].\n* In Costa Rica, yellow is the colour associated with the social democratic and progressive [[Citizens' Action Party (Costa Rica)|Citizens' Action Party]] (generally under a darker gold tone) and left-wing [[Broad Front (Costa Rica)|Broad Front]] (which uses a more lighter tone). It is also the colour of several [[Worker's union|unions]].\n* In [[Denmark]], yellow is the colour of the right-wing populist [[Danish People's Party]].\n* In Honduras, yellow is the colour of far-left party [[Democratic Unification Party]].\n* In Hong Kong, yellow refers to democracy because of the yellow umbrellas that were raised during the [[Umbrella Revolution]] in 2014.\n* In Malaysia, yellow was used by [[Bersih]] (The Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections), a series of rallies attended by hundreds of thousands of Malaysians. \n* In the Philippines, yellow mostly refers to the [[People Power Revolution]], [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]], and the [[Aquino family]]. \n* In [[Sweden]], the [[Sweden Democrats]], a nationalistic and socially conservative party, is often associated with yellow.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n* In the European Union, the color yellow was used by the [[ALDE Party]], its [[ALDE Group|group in the European Parliament]] and its youth organation before dropping it in 2016.\n* In the United States, the color yellow was the official color of the suffrage movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref>Kathleen  L.

This was common in British politics up to the 1970s. The traditional colour of the [[Penrith and The Border (UK Parliament constituency)|Penrith and the Border]] Conservatives was yellow, rather than dark blue, even in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 election]] Conservative candidates in Penrith and the neighbouring constituency of [[Westmorland and Lonsdale (UK Parliament constituency)|Westmorland and Lonsdale]] wore blue and yellow rosettes. In [[North East England]], the Conservatives traditionally used red, Labour green and the Liberals blue and orange. In parts of [[East Anglia]], the Conservatives used pink and blue, whilst in [[Norwich]] their colours were orange and purple. The Liberals and Conservatives used blue and red respectively in [[West Wales]], while in parts of [[Cheshire]] the Liberals were red and Labour yellow. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the Tories used orange in [[Birmingham]], pink in [[Whitby]] and red in [[East Worcestershire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Worcestershire]], whilst the Whigs were blue in [[Kendal]], purple in [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]] and orange in [[Wakefield]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-32510493|title=The seats where Tories weren't blue and Labour wasn't red|author=Jon Kelly|date=4 May 2015|website=[[bbc.co.uk]]|accessdate=4 May 2015}}</ref> The traditional colour of the [[Warwickshire]] Liberals was green, rather than orange.\n* In the [[Politics of the United States|United States]] the two major political parties use the [[national colours]], i.e. red, white and blue. Historically, the only common situation in which it has been necessary to assign a single colour to a party has been in the production of political maps in graphical displays of election results. In such cases, there had been no consistent association of particular parties with particular colours. However, in the weeks following the 2000 election there arose the terminology of [[red states and blue states]], in which the conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] was associated with red and the liberal [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] with blue. Political observers latched on to this association, which resulted from the use of red for Republican victories and blue for Democratic victories on the display map of a television network.

Additionally its successor, the [[New National Party (South Africa)|New National Party]], used the colour orange. It is the used by the [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] and [[Afrikaner nationalism|Afrikaner nationalist]] party [[Freedom Front Plus]]. Orange red is the official colour of the [[Independent Democrats]], a [[Social democracy|social democratic]] political party in the Northern and Western Cape Provinces.\n* In [[Spain]], orange is the colour of the right-wing liberal party [[Citizens (Spanish political party)|Citizens]].\n* In [[Switzerland]], orange is the colour of the centre-right [[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland]]\n* In the [[United Kingdom]], orange or amber was the colour of the historical [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. The contemporary successors to the Liberals, the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], use amber. \n* In the [[United States]], Orange is the color of the [[American Solidarity Party]], a minor [[centrist]] party which is insipired by european [[christian democracy]] \n* In Puerto Rico, orange is the colour of [[Puerto Ricans for Puerto Rico Party|Puerto Ricans for Puerto Rico]]\n* In [[Ukraine]], orange was the colour of liberal groups that participated in the \"[[Orange Revolution]]\". This gave the colour orange a certain association with radical anti-authoritarian politics in some countries and it has been used as such by groups and organizations in the Middle East, for example in [[Free Patriotic Movement|Lebanon]], the [[Independent Palestine|Palestinian Authority]], [[Kifaya|Egypt]], [[National Democratic Action Society|Bahrain]] and [[Israel]].\n\n== Pink ==\n[[Pink]] is sometimes used by [[social democracy|social democratic]] parties, such as in [[Socialist Party (France)|France]] and [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Portugal]]. The more traditional colour of social democracy is red (because social democracy is descended from the democratic socialist movement), but some countries have large social democratic parties alongside large socialist or communist parties, so that it would be confusing for them all to use red. In such cases, social democrats are usually the ones who give up red in favor of a different colour. Pink is often chosen because it is seen as a softer, less aggressive version of red, in the same way that social democracy is more centrist and less militant than socialism. This is also the origin of the colloquial term \"[[pinko]]\".\n*In [[Brazil]], Pink is sometimes used by [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|Democratic Labour Party]], a [[centre-left]] to [[left-wing nationalist]] political party member of [[Socialist International]].\n* Some European liberal parties use pink or magenta as their party colour. Examples include the [[Danish Social Liberal Party]] and [[NEOS \u2013 The New Austria]].\n* In some European nations and the United States, pink is associated with homosexuality and the pink flag is used as a symbol in support of civil rights for LGBT people. This goes back to the Nazi German policy of appending [[Nazi concentration camp badges|pink triangles]] to the clothing of homosexual prisoners.\n* In [[South Korea]], pink is the color of the conservative [[United Future Party]], founded in 2020 as a merger of the major right-wing [[Free Korea Party]] with some minor conservative parties.\n* Pink is the colour of the feminist party [[Feminist Initiative (Sweden)|Feminist Initiative]] in Sweden.\n* Pink is the new colour of the socialist [[Left Alliance (Finland)|Left Alliance]] party in Finland as well as the [[Feminist Party (Finland)|Feminist Party]].\n\n== Purple ==\nAlthough [[purple]] has some older associations with [[monarchism]], it is the most prominent colour that is not traditionally connected to any major contemporary ideology. As such, it is sometimes used to represent a mix of different ideologies, or new protest movements that are critical of all previously-existing parties.\n* Purple is often associated with [[feminism]] and when combined with black, is often used to represent [[anarcha-feminism]].\n* In Albania, purple is associated with the governing [[Socialist Party of Albania]], a [[centre-left]] party\n* In Brazil, purple is the color associated with some [[Progressive liberalism|progressive liberal]] movements such as  [[Cidadania]] and [[Livres (movement)|Livres]]. This color is chosen because those movements consider themselves to be mixing the best ideas of the [[left-wing politics|left]] (associated with red) and the [[right-wing politics|right]] (associated with blue)\n*In Canada, navy purple is the colour used by the right-wing [[People's Party of Canada]].\n* In Europe, purple tends to be used for movements, parties and governments that are neither clearly right nor left.\n** It has been used to represent the [[Purple (government)|Purple governments]] of [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], formed by an alliance of red social-democratic and blue liberal parties.\n** The pan-European movement [[Volt Europa]] has adopted purple as its main party colour since its foundation, symbolising dynamic youthfulness and transparency.\n* In Italy, purple has been adopted by anti-[[Silvio Berlusconi]] protesters (see [[Purple People]]) as an alternative from other colours and political parties.\n* In Ireland, purple is the colour of the [[Social Democrats (Ireland)|Social Democrats]] which supports a [[Nordic model]] of social democracy.\n* In Mexico, purple is the colour of the [[Humanist Party (Mexico)|Humanist Party]].\n* In Poland, purple is the colour of [[Razem|Partia Razem]], a new left-wing social-democratic political party formed in 2015.\n* In Romania, purple was used by the populist and eurosceptic [[People's Party \u2013 Dan Diaconescu]], active between 2011\u20132015.\n* In Spain, purple is the colour of [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]], a left-wing party that emerged from the [[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|15-M Movement]] protests.\n* Purple is the colour of the Swedish [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|Pirate Party]] and Icelandic [[Pirate Party (Iceland)|Pirate Party]], as well as several [[List of Pirate Parties|international Pirate parties]] share the colour along with black. \n* In the United Kingdom, purple is associated with Euroscepticism, being the official colours of the [[UK Independence Party]] (along with yellow) and the minor party [[Veritas (political party)|Veritas]].\n* In the United States, purple is the official colour of [[centrism]], the [[American Independent Party]], a \"[[swing state]]\", the [[Veterans Party of America]], and the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]]\n** Also the color of social democratic [[Vermont Progressive Party]].{{Dubious||date=July 2019}}\n** Purple is also unofficially used in the United States to denote a \"swing state\" (i.e. one contested frequently between the Republican Party, whose unofficial colour is red; and the Democratic Party, whose unofficial colour is blue). Purple is also used by [[centrism|centrists]] to represent a combination of beliefs belonging to the Republicans (red) and the Democrats (blue). It has also been used to reference [[Purple America]], a term used in contrast to \"blue\" or \"red\", noting the electoral differences nationwide are observed more on discrepancies instead of unity (see [[red states and blue states]]).\n* In Uruguay, purple is the colour of the social democratic [[Independent Party (Uruguay)|Independent Party]].\n* In Venezuela, purple is use by socialist [[People's Electoral Movement (Venezuela)|People's Electoral Movement]].\n\n== Red ==\n[[Red]] is traditionally associated with [[socialism]] and [[communism]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The oldest symbol of socialism (and by extension communism) is the [[Red flag (politics)|Red Flag]], which dates back to the French Revolution in the 18th century and the [[revolutions of 1848]]. Before this nascence, the colour red was generally associated with [[monarchy]] or the Church due to the symbolism and association of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]'s blood. The colour red was chosen to represent the blood of the workers who died in the struggle against capitalism. All major socialist and communist alliances and organisations\u2014including the [[First International|First]], [[Second International|Second]], [[Comintern|Third]] and [[Fourth International|Fourth]] Internationals\u2014used red as their official colour. The association between the colour red and communism is particularly strong. Communists use red much more often and more extensively than other ideologies use their respective traditional colours.\n\n* In Europe and Latin America, red is also associated with parties of [[social democracy]] and often their allies within the [[labour movement]]. Sometimes these parties use pink instead, as a \"moderate\" colour instead of the more \"radical\" red, or \"pink\" used to describe the more moderate faction or membership within a left-wing party.\n* Red is also the traditional colour of liberal parties in Latin America and was the colour use, for example, in Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Uruguay for liberal parties. However, these parties follow [[social liberalism]] more than [[classic liberalism]], thus seating in the centre-left. \n* In the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland, red is also the colour of the labour movement and the Labour (spelled Labor in Australia) parties in those countries. The use of red as a symbol is referenced in the British Labour Party's anthem, ''[[The Red Flag]]''.<ref name=\"Hitchens2010\">{{cite book|author=Peter Hitchens|title=The Cameron Delusion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8WvOBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA181|date=26 March 2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-2390-9|page=181}}</ref>\n** In the heyday of the British Empire before 1960, maps, globes, and atlases typically used red or pink to designate the [[British Empire]] or its Commonwealth.<ref>{{cite book|author=Arthur Jay Klinghoffer|title=The Power of Projections: How Maps Reflect Global Politics and History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WhyPBHJV5VYC&pg=PA79|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood|page=79|isbn=9780275991357}}</ref> As soon as a colony became independent, it needed its own distinctive color and the practice died out.\n* In [[Brazil]], red is so strongly associated with the [[left-wing populist]] [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]], the communists [[PCdoB]] and [[Brazilian Communist Party|PCB]] and with the [[far-left]] that different left-wing movements choose not to use red as a main color in order to give themselves a distinct identity. The [[PSOL]] and the [[Brazilian Socialist Party]] invert the traditional color schemes of left-wing political parties and use red as a secondary color with yellow, orange or white being their primary color. [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|Democratic Labour Party]] uses blue, red, pink and white as main colors.\n* Also in Brazil, red combined with black and white was formerly associated with [[Brazilian nationalism]]. The first incarnation of the [[agrarianist]]-[[centrist]] [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 1945-65)|Social Democratic Party]], both incarnations of the Brazilian Labour Party (the [[Brazilian Labour Party (historical)|first]] a [[social democratic]] party, the [[Brazilian Labour Party (current)|current]] a [[populist]] one) and the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]] use this color scheme. Red, Black and White are associated with the three races which form the ethnic composition of Brazil: the [[Amerindians]] (Red), the [[Afro-Brazilians]] (Black) and [[White Brazilians]].\n* Belize's main conservative party ([[United Democratic Party (Belize)|United Democratic Party]]) is represented by the red colour.\n* In Canada, red has always been associated with the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] because one of its predecessors was the ''[[Parti rouge]]'' (French for \"Red Party\").\n* Japan's [[buddhist]] party [[Komeito]] has a red sun as flag. \n* The [[Colorado Party (Paraguay)|Colorado Party]] of Paraguay, a right-wing conservative party, uses red while its main rival the liberal [[Radical Liberal Party (Paraguay)|Partido Liberal Radical]] uses blue, contrary to the rest of Latin America.\n* The [[Liberty Korea Party]], which was the dominant [[Conservatism in South Korea|conservative]] party in [[South Korea]], used red as their official colour. Before 2012, the conservative parties used blue as their official colour.\n* In [[Spain]] red is associated with communism, socialism and social democracy. The social democrat party [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]] and the leftist coalition [[United Left (Spain)|Izquierda Unida]] use red.\n* In [[Sweden]] red is associated with leftism, socialism and social democracy. The [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party]] and the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party]] use red.\n* In Thailand, the Red Shirt movement derives its populist base from amongst the working class and rural communities, which oppose the established power elite in Bangkok.\n* A key exception to the convention of red to mean socialism is the United States. Since about the year 2000, the mass media have associated red with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], despite the fact that the Republican Party is a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] party (see [[red states and blue states]]).<ref name=\"David Starkey 2007\">{{cite book|author=David Starkey|title=Living Blue in the Red States|publisher=University Press of Nebraska|year=2007}}</ref> This use is probably entrenched as many political organisations (for example the website [[RedState]]) now use the term. Any use of the color red exclusively to describe historically the [[Republican Party]] on anything prior to 2000 would be historically inaccurate and misleading.\n** By contrast, in Puerto Rico the liberal [[Popular Democratic Party (Puerto Rico)|Popular Democratic Party]] uses red.\n\n== Saffron ==\n* In India, [[Saffron (color)|saffron]] is traditionally associated with [[Hinduism]], [[Hindutva]] and the [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalist movement]].<ref name=\"Saffron\">{{cite book|title=Manufacturing Citizenship: education and nationalism in Europe, South Asia and China|author=V\u00e9ronique B\u00e9n\u00e9\u00ef|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-36488-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XCUNB8koN-8C&pg=PA156&lpg=PA156&dq=Saffronization}}</ref> Saffron was chosen because in Hindu [[Sanatana Dharma]], the deep saffron colour is associated with sacrifice, religious abstinence, quest for light and salvation. Saffron or \"Bhagwa\" is the most sacred colour for the Hindus and is often worn by Sanyasis who have left their home in search of the ultimate truth.\n\n== Turquoise ==\n[[Turquoise]] has, in recent years, been associated with [[Euroscepticism]] as a result of several European parties that have proposed their respective nation's exit from the [[European Union]].\n*In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Turquoise]] became the color of choice of the eurosceptic [[Brexit Party]].\n*In the European Union, the [[Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy]] group uses turquoise as its principle colour. Before them, this colour was used by the [[Europe of Freedom and Democracy]] group.\n* In Brazil, Turquoise is used as the main color of [[Rede Sustentabilidade|Sustaintability Network]], a progressive political party\n\n== White ==\n[[White]] is today mainly linked to [[pacifism]] (as in the [[White flag|surrender flag]])<ref name=\":0\" /> and in politics of the United Kingdom to independent politicians such as [[Martin Bell]].\n\n* Historically, it was associated with support for [[absolute monarchy]], starting with the supporters of the [[Bourbon dynasty]] of France because it was the dynasty's colour. Later it was used by the [[White movement|Whites]] who fought against the communist \"Reds\" in the [[Russian Civil War]], because some of the Russian \"Whites\" had similar goals to the French \"Whites\" of a century earlier (although, it is worth noting that the Whites included many different people with many ideologies, such as monarchists, liberals, and others).\n** Because of its use by anti-communist forces in Russia, the colour white came to be associated in the 20th century with many different [[anti-communist]] and counter-revolutionary groups, even those that did not support absolute monarchy (for example, the Finnish \"[[Whites (Finland)|Whites]]\" who fought against the socialist \"[[Red Guards (Finland)|Reds]]\" in the civil war following the [[independence of Finland]]). In some revolutions, red is used to represent the revolutionaries and white is used to represent the supporters of the old order, regardless of the ideologies or goals of the two sides.\n* In Italy a red cross on a white shield (''scudo crociato'') is the emblem of Catholic parties from the historical [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] party.\n* In [[Politics of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], the [[Taliban]] reversed the Islamist schema, using black shahada on a white background (symbol of purity).\n* In [[Singapore]], white is the colour associated with the [[People's Action Party]], the party that has been in power and dominating the Parliament since the country's independence.\n* In Uruguay, the conservative [[National Party (Uruguay)|National Party]] is also known as \"White Party\", counterpart of the liberal \"[[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Red Party]]\" during the [[two-party system|two-party era]].\n* In [[Venezuela]], white has been the traditional colour of the [[Democratic Action (Venezuela)|Democratic Action]] party, one of the two parties that dominated the country's politics in the late 20th century (alongside [[Copei]]) and one of the parties currently in opposition to the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela|PSUV]].\n\n== Yellow ==\n[[Yellow]] used to be the colour most commonly associated with [[liberalism]] and [[right-libertarianism]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Color Design Workbook: A Real World Guide to Using Color in Graphic Design|last=Adams|first=Sean|last2=Morioka|first2=Noreen|last3=Stone|first3=Terry Lee|date=2006|publisher=Rockport Publishers|isbn=159253192X|location=Gloucester, Mass.|pages=[https://archive.org/details/colordesignworkb0000ston/page/86 86]|oclc=60393965|url=https://archive.org/details/colordesignworkb0000ston/page/86}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Rohit Vishal|last2=Joshi|first2=Radhika|date=October-December 2006|title=Colour, Colour Everywhere: In Marketing Too|journal=SCMS Journal of Indian Management|volume=3|issue=4|pages=40\u201346|issn=0973-3167|ssrn=969272}}</ref><ref>Cassel-Picot, Muriel \"The Liberal Democrats and the Green Cause: From Yellow to Green\" in Leydier, Gilles and Martin, Alexia (2013) ''Environmental Issues in Political Discourse in Britain and Ireland''.

For instance, in [[Thailand]] yellow represents [[Monarchy of Thailand|King]] [[Bhumibol]]. It was also the colour of the pro-monarchy [[Panchayat (Nepal)|Panchayat]] system in the [[Kingdom of Nepal]].\n* It is also a common colour to represent [[Buddhism]], monks in [[Burma]] used it in the [[Saffron Revolution|anti-government protests]].\n* In Argentina, yellow is the colour for liberal right-wing party [[Republican Proposal]], led by [[Mauricio Macri]].\n* In [[Brazil]], yellow, combined with green, is associated with right-wing movements [[anti-corruption|against corruption]], anti-[[Workers Party (Brazil)|Workers Party]], supportive of [[impeachment of Dilma Rousseff]] and later, with support of [[Jair Bolsonaro presidential campaign, 2018|Jair Bolsonaro]], like [[Partido Social Liberal|PSL]] and the [[Alliance for Brazil]]. The association came because many of the protesters against Dilma wears the jersey of [[Brazilian national football team]], which is yellow with the numbers and some details in green, and because the protesters chanted that [[brazilian flag]] \"will never be red\" and \"will be always green and yellow\". Red is the color of [[left-wing populist]] Workers' Party.\n* In Colombia, yellow is the colour of left-wing party [[Alternative Democratic Pole]].\n* In Costa Rica, yellow is the colour associated with the social democratic and progressive [[Citizens' Action Party (Costa Rica)|Citizens' Action Party]] (generally under a darker gold tone) and left-wing [[Broad Front (Costa Rica)|Broad Front]] (which uses a more lighter tone). It is also the colour of several [[Worker's union|unions]].\n* In [[Denmark]], yellow is the colour of the right-wing populist [[Danish People's Party]].\n* In Honduras, yellow is the colour of far-left party [[Democratic Unification Party]].\n* In Hong Kong, yellow refers to democracy because of the yellow umbrellas that were raised during the [[Umbrella Revolution]] in 2014.\n* In Malaysia, yellow was used by [[Bersih]] (The Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections), a series of rallies attended by hundreds of thousands of Malaysians. \n* In the Philippines, yellow mostly refers to the [[People Power Revolution]], [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]], and the [[Aquino family]]. \n* In [[Sweden]], the [[Sweden Democrats]], a nationalistic and socially conservative party, is often associated with yellow.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n* In the European Union, the color yellow was used by the [[ALDE Party]], its [[ALDE Group|group in the European Parliament]] and its youth organation before dropping it in 2016.\n* In the United States, the color yellow was the official color of the suffrage movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref>Kathleen  L.

Aside from these \"party colours\", individual candidates may use a different colour; the colours of the three parties mentioned were derived from the preferred colours of [[Benigno Aquino Jr.]], [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and [[Joseph Estrada]], respectively. The Christian democrats [[Lakas\u2013CMD]] uses blue and gold, and the [[Nacionalista Party]], while using the colours of the [[flag of the Philippines]], had used green and lately orange, the preferred colour of 2010 presidential nominee [[Manny Villar]]. While popularly known as \"reds\", the left had not used that colour in elections, using instead purple or dark blue. Other parties use party colours sparingly.\n* In Poland, of the two main parties;  the populist-conservative [[Law and Justice]] (PiS) use blue and the centrist Christian-democratic [[Civic Platform|Civil Platform]] (PO) uses orange.

This was common in British politics up to the 1970s. The traditional colour of the [[Penrith and The Border (UK Parliament constituency)|Penrith and the Border]] Conservatives was yellow, rather than dark blue, even in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 election]] Conservative candidates in Penrith and the neighbouring constituency of [[Westmorland and Lonsdale (UK Parliament constituency)|Westmorland and Lonsdale]] wore blue and yellow rosettes. In [[North East England]], the Conservatives traditionally used red, Labour green and the Liberals blue and orange. In parts of [[East Anglia]], the Conservatives used pink and blue, whilst in [[Norwich]] their colours were orange and purple. The Liberals and Conservatives used blue and red respectively in [[West Wales]], while in parts of [[Cheshire]] the Liberals were red and Labour yellow. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the Tories used orange in [[Birmingham]], pink in [[Whitby]] and red in [[East Worcestershire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Worcestershire]], whilst the Whigs were blue in [[Kendal]], purple in [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]] and orange in [[Wakefield]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-32510493|title=The seats where Tories weren't blue and Labour wasn't red|author=Jon Kelly|date=4 May 2015|website=[[bbc.co.uk]]|accessdate=4 May 2015}}</ref> The traditional colour of the [[Warwickshire]] Liberals was green, rather than orange.\n* In the [[Politics of the United States|United States]] the two major political parties use the [[national colours]], i.e. red, white and blue. Historically, the only common situation in which it has been necessary to assign a single colour to a party has been in the production of political maps in graphical displays of election results. In such cases, there had been no consistent association of particular parties with particular colours. However, in the weeks following the 2000 election there arose the terminology of [[red states and blue states]], in which the conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] was associated with red and the liberal [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] with blue. Political observers latched on to this association, which resulted from the use of red for Republican victories and blue for Democratic victories on the display map of a television network. In 2004, the association was mostly kept. As of November 2012, maps for presidential elections produced by the U.S. government also use blue for Democrats and red for Republicans.<ref name=\"US-NARA-map\">{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/map/historic.html|title=Historic Election Results|publisher=The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=2 November 2012}}</ref> In September 2010, the Democratic Party officially adopted an all-blue logo.<ref name=\"democrats.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.democrats.org/news/blog/575|title=Change That Matters|publisher=Democrats.org|date=14 September 2010|accessdate=17 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019042631/http://www.democrats.org/news/blog/575|archivedate=19 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Around the same time, the official Republican website began using a red logo.\n** This association has potential to confuse foreign observers in that, as described above, red is traditionally a left-wing colour, while blue is typically associated with right-wing politics. This is further complicated by the diversity of [[Factions in the Democratic Party (United States)|factions in the Democratic Party]] ranging from conservatives to right-libertarians to [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialists]] alongside the dominant centrist and social liberal elements of the party that outside the United States often each use different political colors. \n**The conservative [[Blue Dog Coalition]] within the Democratic Party adopted the color blue at its founding before the 2000 election solidified the red-blue convention. \n** There is some historical use of blue for Democrats and red for Republicans: in the late 19th century and early 20th century, [[Texas]] county election boards used colour-coding to help Spanish speakers and illiterates identify the parties,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/pqrsu|title=Reds and Blues \u2013 The Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Tshaonline.org|accessdate=17 October 2011}}</ref> but this system was not applied consistently in Texas and was not picked up on a national level. For instance in [[1888 United States presidential election|1888]], [[Grover Cleveland]] and [[Benjamin Harrison]] used maps that coded blue for the Republicans, the colour Harrison perceived to represent the Union and \"[[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]'s Party\" and red for the Democrats.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tara A.

Politicians often attack deficit spending as \"being in the red.\"  For example, Republican presidential candidate [[Robert Dole]] in 1996 denounced one of President Bill Clinton's proposals because it would impose new costs on small business. Dole said: \"Now that the federal government is running in the red and state governments are faced with budget deficits that rise each year, the Democrats are looking for a new pocket to pick, and small business will fill that role.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Nicholas Laham|title=A Lost Cause: Bill Clinton's Campaign for National Health Insurance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lb2wMn4FRawC&pg=PA84|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood|page=84|isbn=9780275956110}}</ref>\n** In [[Politics of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]], the main conservative party, the [[New Progressive Party (Puerto Rico)|New Progressive Party]], uses blue, while the [[Popular Democratic Party (Puerto Rico)|Popular Democratic Party]] uses red and the [[Puerto Rican Independence Party]] uses green.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Political uniform]]\n* [[List of political ideologies]]\n* [[List of political party symbols]]\n* [[NATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems#Affiliation]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n{{color topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Political Colour}}\n[[Category:Political terminology]]\n[[Category:Political symbols|Color]]\n[[Category:Color in culture]]\n", "name_user": "BD2412", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing links to disambiguation pages, improving links, other minor cleanup tasks", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_colour"}

All three were created by Tucholka. The company name was changed to \"Tri Tac Games\" to reflect what the company saw as the more serious nature of its new products.\n\nCurrently the company sells a number of games and books, including a book of cartoons and a cookbook called ''Damn Strange Recipe Collection''.

After the raid, the federal prosecutor assigned to the case elected not to press charges. A year later the FBI visited the Tri Tac booth at [[Gen Con]] 95 to see if Tri Tac was distributing similar ID badges. Tri Tac was no longer selling the badges but they did display one of the controversial badges. It was sealed in a frame with a newspaper report about the raid. The FBI determined Tri Tac presented no threat to national security and left without comment.\n\nAfter Tucholka's passing in 2017, his wife, Melody Natcher, took over as the owner of Tri Tac Games and has released several of the games, some with complete make overs such as Hard Wired Hinterland, and others just spelling and grammar corrections.\n\n==Current games==\nThese are the current games:<ref>(Updated 7/26/12)</ref>\n;''Bureau 13''\n*''[[Bureau 13: Stalking the Night Fantastic]]''\n*''Bureau 13 Adventures: Hellsnight, Haunts, The Lost Files, Vols 1 & 2'' \n*''Bureau 13: Black Powder 1859-1889''\n*''Bureau 13: Scenes for Horror, Industry and Adventure''\n*''Bureau 13: Special Edition by Pollotta & Tucholka''\n*''Bureau 13: d20 EDITION''\n*''Bureau 13: SCREAMS IN THE NIGHT (Outpost/Tritac)''\n*''Bureau 13: ALIENS AMONG US (Outpost/Tritac''\n*''Bureau 13: STALKING THE STEEL CITY (Outpost/Tritac''\n*''Bureau 13: EXTREME''\n*''Bureau 13: BRASS & STEAM (2012)''\n\n;Hardwired Hinterland\n*''[[Hardwired Hinterland]]''\n\n;Fringeworthy\n*''[[Fringeworthy]]''\n*''[[Fringeworthy d20]]''\n*''[[Rogue 417]]''\n*''Cloisters''\n*''Invasion US''\n*''Weirdzone'' \n*''Catalogue of Alternative Worlds''\n*''Catalogue of Alternative Worlds II''\n*''Catalogue of Alternative Worlds III''\n*''[[Weirdzone]]''\n;Space RPGs\n*''[[FTL:2448]]''\n*''[[Incursion II Canadians Across the Galactic Empire]]''\n*''[[Incursion]]''\n*''[[EZ SPACE 2012]]''\n;Microgames\n*''Cosmic Wow!''\n*''Baby Boomer''\n*''Geriatric Wars''\n*''Escape from Westerville State''\n*''Drive By''\n*''War on High''\n*''Viral Vegetable Wars''\n*''The Hunt for Bread in October''\n\n;Duck Wars\n*''Duck Trooper''\n*''Polywumpus''\n*''Pterroductyl''\n\n;Clay squash classics\n*''Monster Squash''\n*''Mec Squash''\n*''Bug Squash''\n*''Mutant Squash''\n*''Japanese Monster Squash''\n*''Panzer Squash''\n*''People Squash''\n\n;Other\n*''Beach Bunny Bimbos with Blasters''<ref>{{cite web|author=Wasahbe Green |url=http://tritacgames.com/BBBG.htm |title=Guests |publisher=Tritacgames.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-03}}</ref>\n*''Guests: An Invasion of the Earth Supplement''\n*''Holes: Wild Miniatures Combat''\n*''DM's Book of Nasty Tricks & Misfit Magic''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n==External links==\n*{{cite web |url=http://tritacgames.com/fbi.htm |title= FBI raid on Tri Tac Games |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website= |publisher= Tri Tac Games |accessdate=7 December 2013|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131207055236/http://tritacgames.com/FBI.htm |archivedate=7 December 2013}}\n\n[[Category:Role-playing game publishing companies]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox company\n| name = Tri Tac Games\n| logo = \n| fate = \n| successor = \n| foundation = \n| defunct = \n| location = [[Pontiac, Michigan]], [[United States|USA]]\n| industry = [[Role-playing game]] publisher\n| key_people = [[Richard Tucholka]]\n| products = \n| num_employees =\n| parent =\n| subsid =\n| website = [http://www.tritacgames.com/ Official website]\n}}\n\n'''Tri Tac Games''' is a publisher of [[role-playing game]]s based in [[Pontiac, Michigan]].
