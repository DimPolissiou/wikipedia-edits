There are many parametric copula families available, which usually have parameters that control the strength of dependence. Some popular parametric copula models are outlined below.\n\nTwo-dimensional copulas are known in some other areas of mathematics under the name ''permutons'' and ''doubly-stochastic measures''.\n\n==Mathematical definition==\nConsider a random vector <math>(X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_d)</math>. Suppose its marginals are continuous, i.e. the marginal [[Cumulative distribution function|CDFs]] <math>F_i(x) = \\mathrm{Pr}[X_i\\leq x] </math> are continuous functions. By applying the [[probability integral transform]] to each component, the random vector\n:<math>(U_1,U_2,\\dots,U_d)=\\left(F_1(X_1),F_2(X_2),\\dots,F_d(X_d)\\right)</math>\nhas [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly]] distributed marginals.\n\nThe copula of <math>(X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_d)</math> is defined as the [[cumulative distribution function#Multivariate case|joint cumulative distribution function]] of <math>(U_1,U_2,\\dots,U_d)</math>:\n:<math>C(u_1,u_2,\\dots,u_d)=\\mathrm{Pr}[U_1\\leq u_1,U_2\\leq u_2,\\dots,U_d\\leq u_d] .</math>\n\nThe copula ''C'' contains all information on the dependence structure between the components of <math>(X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_d)</math> whereas the marginal cumulative distribution functions <math>F_i</math> contain all information on the marginal distributions.\n\nThe importance of the above is that the reverse of these steps can be used to generate [[pseudo-random]] samples from general classes of [[multivariate probability distribution]]s. That is, given a procedure to generate a sample <math>(U_1,U_2,\\dots,U_d)</math> from the copula distribution, the required sample can be constructed as\n:<math>(X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_d) = \\left(F_1^{-1}(U_1),F_2^{-1}(U_2),\\dots,F_d^{-1}(U_d)\\right).</math>\nThe inverses <math>F_i^{-1}</math> are unproblematic as the <math>F_i</math> were assumed to be continuous. The above formula for the copula function can be rewritten to correspond to this as:\n:<math>C(u_1,u_2,\\dots,u_d)=\\mathrm{Pr}[X_1\\leq F_1^{-1}(u_1),X_2\\leq F_2^{-1}(u_2),\\dots,X_d\\leq F_d^{-1}(u_d)] .</math>\n\n==Definition==\n\nIn [[probability theory|probabilistic]] terms, <math>C:[0,1]^d\\rightarrow [0,1]</math> is a ''d''-dimensional '''copula''' if ''C'' is a joint [[cumulative distribution function]] of a ''d''-dimensional random vector on the [[unit cube]] <math>[0,1]^d</math> with [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform]] [[marginal distribution|marginals]].<ref name=\"nelsen\">{{Citation |first=Roger B. |last=Nelsen |year=1999 |title=An Introduction to Copulas |location=New York |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-98623-4 }}</ref>\n\nIn [[Multivariable calculus|analytic]] terms, <math>C:[0,1]^d\\rightarrow [0,1]</math> is a ''d''-dimensional '''copula''' if\n:* <math>C(u_1,\\dots,u_{i-1},0,u_{i+1},\\dots,u_d)=0 </math>, the copula is zero if any one of the arguments is zero,\n:*  <math>C(1,\\dots,1,u,1,\\dots,1)=u </math>, the copula is equal to ''u'' if one argument is ''u'' and all others 1,\n:* ''C'' is ''d''-non-decreasing, i.e., for each [[hyperrectangle]] <math>B=\\prod_{i=1}^{d}[x_i,y_i]\\subseteq [0,1]^d </math> the ''C''-volume of ''B'' is non-negative:\n:*:<math> \\int_B \\mathrm{d}C(u) =\\sum_{\\mathbf z\\in \\times_{i=1}^{d}\\{x_i,y_i\\}} (-1)^{N(\\mathbf z)} C(\\mathbf z)\\ge 0,</math>\n::where the <math>N(\\mathbf z)=\\#\\{k : z_k=x_k\\}</math>.\n\nFor instance, in the bivariate case, <math>C:[0,1]\\times[0,1]\\rightarrow [0,1]</math> is a bivariate copula if <math>C(0,u) = C(u,0) = 0 </math>, <math>C(1,u) = C(u,1) = u </math> and <math>C(u_2,v_2)-C(u_2,v_1)-C(u_1,v_2)+C(u_1,v_1) \\geq 0 </math> for all <math>0 \\leq u_1 \\leq u_2 \\leq 1</math> and <math>0 \\leq v_1 \\leq v_2 \\leq 1</math>.\n\n==Sklar's theorem==\n[[File:Gaussian copula gaussian marginals.png|thumb|Density and contour plot of a Bivariate Gaussian Distribution]]\n[[File:Biv gumbel dist.png|thumb|Density and contour plot of two Normal marginals joint with a Gumbel copula]]\n\nSklar's theorem, named after [[Abe Sklar]], provides the theoretical foundation for the application of copulas.<ref name=\"Sklar 1959\">{{citation | last=Sklar | first=A. | authorlink = Abe Sklar | title=Fonctions de r\u00e9partition \u00e0 n dimensions et leurs marges | journal=Publ.

The corresponding \"true\" copula observations would be\n:<math>(U_1^i,U_2^i,\\dots,U_d^i)=\\left(F_1(X_1^i),F_2(X_2^i),\\dots,F_d(X_d^i)\\right), \\, i=1,\\dots,n.</math>\nHowever, the marginal distribution functions <math>F_i</math> are usually not known. Therefore, one can construct pseudo copula observations by using the empirical distribution functions\n:<math>F_k^n(x)=\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbf{1}(X_k^i\\leq x)</math>\ninstead. Then, the pseudo copula observations are defined as\n:<math>(\\tilde{U}_1^i,\\tilde{U}_2^i,\\dots,\\tilde{U}_d^i)=\\left(F_1^n(X_1^i),F_2^n(X_2^i),\\dots,F_d^n(X_d^i)\\right), \\, i=1,\\dots,n.</math>\nThe corresponding empirical copula is then defined as\n:<math>C^n(u_1,\\dots,u_d) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbf{1}\\left(\\tilde{U}_1^i\\leq u_1,\\dots,\\tilde{U}_d^i\\leq u_d\\right).</math>\nThe components of the pseudo copula samples can also be written as <math>\\tilde{U}_k^i=R_k^i/n</math>, where <math>R_k^i</math> is the rank of the observation <math>X_k^i</math>:\n:<math>R_k^i=\\sum_{j=1}^n \\mathbf{1}(X_k^j\\leq X_k^i)</math>\nTherefore, the empirical copula can be seen as the empirical distribution of the rank transformed data.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Quantitative finance===\n[[File:Four Correlations.png|thumb|right|alt=Examples of bivariate copul\u00e6 used in finance.|Examples of bivariate copul\u00e6 used in finance.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" | width=\"250\"\n|- style=\"font-size: 86%\n|-\n|Typical finance applications:\n* Analyzing [[systemic risk]] in financial markets<ref name=\"Low 1\u201318\">{{Cite journal|last=Low|first=Rand |date=2017-05-11|title=Vine copulas: modelling systemic risk and enhancing higher-moment portfolio optimisation |journal=Accounting & Finance|volume=58 |pages=423\u2013463 |doi=10.1111/acfi.12274}}</ref>\n* Analyzing and pricing [[spread option]]s, in particular in fixed income [[constant maturity swap]] spread options\n* Analyzing and pricing volatility smile/skew of [[exotic derivative|exotic]] baskets, e.g. best/worst of\n* Analyzing and pricing volatility smile/skew of less liquid FX{{clarify|reason=what is FX|date=September 2011}} cross, which is effectively a basket: ''C'' = ''S''<sub>1</sub>/''S''<sub>2</sub> or ''C'' = ''S''<sub>1</sub>\u00b7''S''<sub>2</sub>\n* [[Value-at-Risk]] forecasting and portfolio optimization to minimize [[tail risk]] for US and international equities<ref name=\"Banking 2013\"/>\n* Forecasting equities returns for [[Portfolio optimization#Improving portfolio optimization|higher-moment portfolio optimization/full-scale optimization]]<ref name=\"Low 1\u201318\"/>\n* Improving the estimates of a portfolio's expected return and variance-covariance matrix for input into [[Two-moment decision model|sophisticated mean-variance optimization strategies]]<ref name=\"sciencedirect.com\"/>\n* [[Statistical arbitrage]] strategies including [[pairs trading]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rad|first=Hossein|last2=Low|first2=Rand Kwong Yew|last3=Faff|first3=Robert|date=2016-04-27|title=The profitability of pairs trading strategies: distance, cointegration and copula methods |journal=Quantitative Finance |volume=16|issue=10|pages=1541\u20131558|doi=10.1080/14697688.2016.1164337}}</ref>\n|}\nIn [[quantitative finance]] copulas are applied to [[risk management]], to [[investment management|portfolio management]] and [[portfolio optimization|optimization]], and to [[derivatives pricing]].\n\nFor the former, copulas are used to perform [[Stress test (financial)|stress-tests]] and robustness checks that are especially important during \"downside/crisis/panic regimes\" where extreme downside events may occur (e.g., the global financial crisis of 2007\u20132008).  The formula was also adapted for financial markets and was used to estimate the probability distribution of losses on [[Securitization|pools of loans or bonds]].\n\nDuring a downside regime, a large number of investors who have held positions in riskier assets such as equities or real estate may seek refuge in 'safer' investments such as cash or bonds. This is also known as a [[flight-to-quality]] effect and investors tend to exit their positions in riskier assets in large numbers in a short period of time. As a result, during downside regimes, correlations across equities are greater on the downside as opposed to the upside and this may have disastrous effects on the economy.<ref>{{Citation\n | last1 = Longin |first1= F |last2= Solnik |first2= B| year = 2001\n | title = Extreme correlation of international equity markets\n | journal = Journal of Finance\n | volume= 56\n | issue= 2\n | pages=649\u2013676\n | doi=10.1111/0022-1082.00340\n|citeseerx= 10.1.1.321.4899 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation\n | last1 = Ang |first1= A |last2= Chen |first2= J\n | year = 2002\n | title = Asymmetric correlations of equity portfolios\n | journal = Journal of Financial Economics\n | volume=63\n | issue=3\n | pages=443\u2013494\n | doi=10.1016/s0304-405x(02)00068-5\n}}</ref> For example, anecdotally, we often read financial news headlines reporting the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars on the stock exchange in a single day; however, we rarely read reports of positive stock market gains of the same magnitude and in the same short time frame.\n\nCopulas aid in analyzing the effects of downside regimes by allowing the modelling of the [[marginal distribution|marginals]] and dependence structure of a multivariate probability model separately. For example, consider the stock exchange as a market consisting of a large number of traders each operating with his/her own strategies to maximize profits. The individualistic behaviour of each trader can be described by modelling the marginals. However, as all traders operate on the same exchange, each trader's actions have an interaction effect with other traders'. This interaction effect can be described by modelling the dependence structure. Therefore, copulas allow us to analyse the interaction effects which are of particular interest during downside regimes as investors tend to [[herd behavior|herd their trading behaviour and decisions]]. (See also [[agent-based computational economics]], where price is treated as an [[emergent phenomenon]], resulting from the interaction of the various market participants, or agents.)\n\nThe users of the formula have been criticized for creating \"evaluation cultures\" that continued to use simple copul\u00e6 despite the simple versions being acknowledged as inadequate for that purpose.<ref name = \"MacKenzieSpears\">{{cite techreport |last1= MacKenzie |first1= Donald |last2= Spears |first2= Taylor |title= \"The Formula That Killed Wall Street\"?

The Gaussian copula is lacking as it only allows for an elliptical dependence structure, as dependence is only modeled using the variance-covariance matrix.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  This methodology is limited such that it does not allow for dependence to evolve as the financial markets exhibit asymmetric dependence, whereby correlations across assets significantly increase during downturns compared to upturns.

There are many parametric copula families available, which usually have parameters that control the strength of dependence. Some popular parametric copula models are outlined below.\n\nTwo-dimensional copulas are known in some other areas of mathematics under the name ''permutons'' and ''doubly-stochastic measures''.\n\n==Mathematical definition==\nConsider a random vector <math>(X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_d)</math>. Suppose its marginals are continuous, i.e. the marginal [[Cumulative distribution function|CDFs]] <math>F_i(x) = \\mathrm{Pr}[X_i\\leq x] </math> are continuous functions. By applying the [[probability integral transform]] to each component, the random vector\n:<math>(U_1,U_2,\\dots,U_d)=\\left(F_1(X_1),F_2(X_2),\\dots,F_d(X_d)\\right)</math>\nhas [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly]] distributed marginals.\n\nThe copula of <math>(X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_d)</math> is defined as the [[cumulative distribution function#Multivariate case|joint cumulative distribution function]] of <math>(U_1,U_2,\\dots,U_d)</math>:\n:<math>C(u_1,u_2,\\dots,u_d)=\\mathrm{Pr}[U_1\\leq u_1,U_2\\leq u_2,\\dots,U_d\\leq u_d] .</math>\n\nThe copula ''C'' contains all information on the dependence structure between the components of <math>(X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_d)</math> whereas the marginal cumulative distribution functions <math>F_i</math> contain all information on the marginal distributions.\n\nThe importance of the above is that the reverse of these steps can be used to generate [[pseudo-random]] samples from general classes of [[multivariate probability distribution]]s. That is, given a procedure to generate a sample <math>(U_1,U_2,\\dots,U_d)</math> from the copula distribution, the required sample can be constructed as\n:<math>(X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_d) = \\left(F_1^{-1}(U_1),F_2^{-1}(U_2),\\dots,F_d^{-1}(U_d)\\right).</math>\nThe inverses <math>F_i^{-1}</math> are unproblematic as the <math>F_i</math> were assumed to be continuous. The above formula for the copula function can be rewritten to correspond to this as:\n:<math>C(u_1,u_2,\\dots,u_d)=\\mathrm{Pr}[X_1\\leq F_1^{-1}(u_1),X_2\\leq F_2^{-1}(u_2),\\dots,X_d\\leq F_d^{-1}(u_d)] .</math>\n\n==Definition==\n\nIn [[probability theory|probabilistic]] terms, <math>C:[0,1]^d\\rightarrow [0,1]</math> is a ''d''-dimensional '''copula''' if ''C'' is a joint [[cumulative distribution function]] of a ''d''-dimensional random vector on the [[unit cube]] <math>[0,1]^d</math> with [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform]] [[marginal distribution|marginals]].<ref name=\"nelsen\">{{Citation |first=Roger B. |last=Nelsen |year=1999 |title=An Introduction to Copulas |location=New York |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-98623-4 }}</ref>\n\nIn [[Multivariable calculus|analytic]] terms, <math>C:[0,1]^d\\rightarrow [0,1]</math> is a ''d''-dimensional '''copula''' if\n:* <math>C(u_1,\\dots,u_{i-1},0,u_{i+1},\\dots,u_d)=0 </math>, the copula is zero if any one of the arguments is zero,\n:*  <math>C(1,\\dots,1,u,1,\\dots,1)=u </math>, the copula is equal to ''u'' if one argument is ''u'' and all others 1,\n:* ''C'' is ''d''-non-decreasing, i.e., for each [[hyperrectangle]] <math>B=\\prod_{i=1}^{d}[x_i,y_i]\\subseteq [0,1]^d </math> the ''C''-volume of ''B'' is non-negative:\n:*:<math> \\int_B \\mathrm{d}C(u) =\\sum_{\\mathbf z\\in \\times_{i=1}^{d}\\{x_i,y_i\\}} (-1)^{N(\\mathbf z)} C(\\mathbf z)\\ge 0,</math>\n::where the <math>N(\\mathbf z)=\\#\\{k : z_k=x_k\\}</math>.\n\nFor instance, in the bivariate case, <math>C:[0,1]\\times[0,1]\\rightarrow [0,1]</math> is a bivariate copula if <math>C(0,u) = C(u,0) = 0 </math>, <math>C(1,u) = C(u,1) = u </math> and <math>C(u_2,v_2)-C(u_2,v_1)-C(u_1,v_2)+C(u_1,v_1) \\geq 0 </math> for all <math>0 \\leq u_1 \\leq u_2 \\leq 1</math> and <math>0 \\leq v_1 \\leq v_2 \\leq 1</math>.\n\n==Sklar's theorem==\n[[File:Gaussian copula gaussian marginals.png|thumb|Density and contour plot of a Bivariate Gaussian Distribution]]\n[[File:Biv gumbel dist.png|thumb|Density and contour plot of two Normal marginals joint with a Gumbel copula]]\n\nSklar's theorem, named after [[Abe Sklar]], provides the theoretical foundation for the application of copulas.<ref name=\"Sklar 1959\">{{citation | last=Sklar | first=A. | authorlink = Abe Sklar | title=Fonctions de r\u00e9partition \u00e0 n dimensions et leurs marges | journal=Publ.

The formula was also adapted for financial markets and was used to estimate the probability distribution of losses on [[Securitization|pools of loans or bonds]].\n\nDuring a downside regime, a large number of investors who have held positions in riskier assets such as equities or real estate may seek refuge in 'safer' investments such as cash or bonds. This is also known as a [[flight-to-quality]] effect and investors tend to exit their positions in riskier assets in large numbers in a short period of time. As a result, during downside regimes, correlations across equities are greater on the downside as opposed to the upside and this may have disastrous effects on the economy.<ref>{{Citation\n | last1 = Longin |first1= F |last2= Solnik |first2= B| year = 2001\n | title = Extreme correlation of international equity markets\n | journal = Journal of Finance\n | volume= 56\n | issue= 2\n | pages=649\u2013676\n | doi=10.1111/0022-1082.00340\n|citeseerx= 10.1.1.321.4899 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation\n | last1 = Ang |first1= A |last2= Chen |first2= J\n | year = 2002\n | title = Asymmetric correlations of equity portfolios\n | journal = Journal of Financial Economics\n | volume=63\n | issue=3\n | pages=443\u2013494\n | doi=10.1016/s0304-405x(02)00068-5\n}}</ref> For example, anecdotally, we often read financial news headlines reporting the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars on the stock exchange in a single day; however, we rarely read reports of positive stock market gains of the same magnitude and in the same short time frame.\n\nCopulas aid in analyzing the effects of downside regimes by allowing the modelling of the [[marginal distribution|marginals]] and dependence structure of a multivariate probability model separately. For example, consider the stock exchange as a market consisting of a large number of traders each operating with his/her own strategies to maximize profits. The individualistic behaviour of each trader can be described by modelling the marginals. However, as all traders operate on the same exchange, each trader's actions have an interaction effect with other traders'. This interaction effect can be described by modelling the dependence structure. Therefore, copulas allow us to analyse the interaction effects which are of particular interest during downside regimes as investors tend to [[herd behavior|herd their trading behaviour and decisions]]. (See also [[agent-based computational economics]], where price is treated as an [[emergent phenomenon]], resulting from the interaction of the various market participants, or agents.)\n\nThe users of the formula have been criticized for creating \"evaluation cultures\" that continued to use simple copul\u00e6 despite the simple versions being acknowledged as inadequate for that purpose.<ref name = \"MacKenzieSpears\">{{cite techreport |last1= MacKenzie |first1= Donald |last2= Spears |first2= Taylor |title= \"The Formula That Killed Wall Street\"?

The Gaussian copula is lacking as it only allows for an elliptical dependence structure, as dependence is only modeled using the variance-covariance matrix.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  This methodology is limited such that it does not allow for dependence to evolve as the financial markets exhibit asymmetric dependence, whereby correlations across assets significantly increase during downturns compared to upturns.  Therefore, modeling approaches using the Gaussian copula exhibit a poor representation of [[extreme value theory|extreme events]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"Lipton\">{{cite book| first1=Alexander|last1= Lipton |first2= Andrew |last2=Rennie |title=Credit Correlation: Life After Copulas|publisher= World Scientific|isbn= 978-981-270-949-3|year= 2008 }}</ref> There have been attempts to propose models rectifying some of the copula limitations.<ref name=\"Lipton\"/><ref>{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Donnelly|first1= C|last2= Embrechts|first2= P\n| year = 2010\n| title = The devil is in the tails: actuarial mathematics and the subprime mortgage crisis\n| publisher = ASTIN Bulletin 40(1), 1\u201333\n\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book\n| last1 = Brigo |first1=D |last2= Pallavicini |first2= A|last3= Torresetti |first3= R\n| year = 2010\n| title = Credit Models and the Crisis: A Journey into CDOs, Copulas, Correlations and dynamic Models\n| publisher = Wiley and Sons\n\n}}</ref>\n\nAdditional to CDOs, Copulas have been applied to other asset classes as a flexible tool in analyzing multi-asset derivative products.

It is the capital city of the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Quezon Province|Quezon]] where it is geographically situated but, in terms of government and administration, the city is politically independent from the province. For statistical and geographical purposes, {{PH wikidata|name}} is grouped with the province of [[Quezon Province|Quezon]]. According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nIn the 1570s,  Captain Juan de Salcedo first explored what was the province of Tayabas. The [[Order of Friars Minor|Franciscan]] priests Juan de Plasencia and Diego de Oropesa between 1580 and 1583 founded its town, also named Tayabas. Tayabas was organized by the Spaniards through the [[Franciscan]] missionaries and Lucena was just one of its barrios.\n\nThe Spaniards of the 16th century called the area \"'''Buenavista'''\" because of its scenic beauty; several years later, the barrio was renamed \"'''Oroquieta'''\". A century later, Muslim pirates began terrorizing the entire Philippine coastline, and Oroquieta was not spared from the notorious raids. The barrio folks built forts along the seashores to defend it against the attacking pirates along the coast, particularly in the present-day Cotta and in Barangay Mayao, though these structures are no longer extant. Hence, the place became known as '''''Cotta''''', the Spanish form of the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] \"''kuta''\" (\"fort\"). The growth of local maritime trade facilitated in the Cotta port and the final defeat of Moro pirates plying the Luzon and Visayan waters, afforded the growth of Lucena as a town which eventually led to its being the capital of Tayabas, Quezon province in 1901.\n\nFinally on November 5, 1879, the Orden Superior Civil officially adopted the name \"'''Lucena'''\" in honor of a Spanish friar by the name of ''Father Mariano Granja'' in [[Andalucia]], Spain. Fr. Granja was responsible for the development of the barrio that became a Parish in 1881. Lucena became an independent municipality on June 1, 1882.\n\nDuring the 1896 [[Philippine Revolution]], the people of Lucena showed their brand of patriotism. Jos\u00e9 Zaballero led the local revolutionists who were under the barrage of Spanish muskets. Later, Miguel Arguilles with Jose Barcelona as President formed a revolutionary government in Lucena.\n\nAfter Aguinaldo proclaimed the nation's independence on June 12, 1898 in [[Kawit, Cavite]], Gen. [[Miguel Malvar]], as Commanding General for Southern Luzon, took over Tayabas Province on August 15, 1898. Don Crisanto Marquez became Lucena's first elected Municipal president during the first Philippine Republic.\n\n===Modern history===\nLucena's fertile soil became soaked with the blood of many Filipinos and Americans at the outbreak of the Filipino-American War in 1899. The foreigners established a civil government in the country, and on March 12, 1901, the provincial capital was transferred from Tayabas to Lucena.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Japanese Imperial Force occupied Lucena on December 27, 1941, 19 days after they set foot on Philippine soil. But the underground resistance movement was so tenacious in Lucena that by January 25, 1945 (even before the Americans have returned), the Hunters ROTC guerrillas penetrated into the town and successfully drove out the Japanese. The rest of Quezon Province (new name of Tayabas Province) had to wait for the American Liberation forces and the Philippine Commonwealth troops to hand freedom on April 4 of that same year.\n\nOn June 17, 1961, by virtue of Republic Act No. 3271, Lucena was made into a Chartered City through the efforts of then Congressman Manuel S. Enverga. It was officially inaugurated on August 19, 1962, during the 84th anniversary of Manuel Luis Quezon. On July 1, 1991, Lucena became a Highly Urbanized City.\n\nIn May 2014, the Lucena City Public Market was razed by fire while festivities were being held for the culmination of Pasayahan sa Lucena a few blocks away. The whole block of the public market building was burned down. Through the cooperation of firefighters from Sariaya, Tayabas, Pagbilao and Lucena.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/606376/fire-destroys-lucena-market|title=Fire destroys Lucena market|last=Jr.|first=Delfin T.

The 2-storey building, which reportedly cost 99 million pesos to build, was financed through loans. According to the article, the Lucena Public Market was also burned down in 1965 along with huge parts of the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/827706/new-lucena-city-market-rises-from-the-ashes|title=New Lucena City market rises from the ashes|last=Jr.|first=Delfin T.

Gulang-gulang, Lucena City, [[Quezon]]. The project was initially funded in the 2017 national budget at around \u20b1100 million. The remaining half was funded through the 2018 national budget. According to DPWH Secretary [[Mark Villar]], the 472-meter long underpass with a 16 lineal-meter concrete bridge at the Lucena-Tayabas-Mauban Port Road aims to reduce the traffic congestion around the Daang Maharlika Route. This new underpass would directly shorten the travel time of those traversing Quezon Province such as those coming from Manila going to the Bicol region and vice versa. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Tuquero |first1=Loreben |title=DPWH opens P245-million underpass in Lucena |url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/243216-underpass-opens-in-lucena |accessdate=26 February 2020 |publisher=Rappler.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=\u20b1245-M Lucena underpass opens |url=https://cnnphilippines.com/regional/2019/10/23/Lucena-underpass-opens.html |accessdate=26 February 2020 |publisher=CNN Philippines}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:LucenaCityRiverjf7895 03.JPG|thumb|left|Iyam River in Cotta]]\nIt is situated 132 kilometers (82 mi) south of Manila.

Its port on the coast along [[Tayabas Bay]] is home to several boat and ferry lines operating and serving the sea lanes between Lucena and the different points in the region and as far as the [[Visayas]].\n\nThere exists a Lucena Airport (known locally as 'Landing') located 300 meters west of [[AMA College]] Lucena Campus but is no longer usable. Light aircraft can no longer make use of it as a road was built as an intersection during the presidency of [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]].\n\nBeing the provincial capital, Lucena is host to most of the branches of governmental agencies, businesses, banks and service facilities in the [[Southern Tagalog]] region.\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Barangays==\nLucena is politically subdivided into 33 [[barangay]]s.\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*Barangay 1 ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay 2 ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay 3 ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay 4 ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay 5 ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay 6 ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay 7 ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay 8 ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay 9 ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay 10 ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay 11 ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barra\n*Bocohan\n*Cotta\n*Gulang-Gulang \n*Dalahican \n*Domoit\n*Ibabang Dupay \n*Ibabang Iyam \n*Ibabang Talim\n*Ilayang Dupay\n*Ilayang Iyam\n*Ilayang Talim\n*Isabang\n*Market View\n*Mayao Castillo\n*Mayao Crossing\n*Mayao Kanluran\n*Mayao Parada\n*Mayao Silangan\n*Ransohan\n*Salinas\n*Talao-Talao\n}}\n\n===Climate===\nLucena falls under Type III of the Corona's climatic classification system.

As population grows in tandem with new and promising business prospects, business activities spill over adjoining barangays, thus forming mini satellite commercial areas.\n\nOther commercial strips are located in the poblacion and suburban barangays where both retail and wholesale trade, including other essential services, are being engaged in. [[SM City Lucena]] is the biggest mall in the city located in Ibabang Dupay, which is one of the first [[SM Prime|SM Malls]] in [[Luzon]]. Other Shopping Centers Include: SM Savemore Agora, Super Metro Lucena, Pacific Mall Lucena and many more.\n\n===Industrial===\nBig factories and warehouses are present in these suburban barangays like [[San Miguel Brewery]], [[Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc.]], [[PepsiCo Inc.|PepsiCo Philippines, Inc.]], [[Asia Brewery, Inc.]] [[Nestl\u00e9|Nestl\u00e9 Philippines]], and [[Ginebra San Miguel|Ginebra San Miguel, Inc.]] (formerly La Tonde\u00f1a Distillers Inc.), do business in sales, distribution, and transport of assorted business products in bulk.\n\nOf the total 8,316.90 hectare land area of Lucena City, 19 percent or 1,651.77 hectares cover the existing built up area. Almost 3% of this or 46.62 hectares cover the industrial section, located in different barangays of the city. These areas are home to significant industrial and manufacturing activities.\n\nIndustry in Lucena produces a sustainable amount of agro-industrial based products, dried and smoked fish, distilled liquors, bamboo and rattan furniture, ornamental flowers/plants, vegetable as well as meat products.\n\nLucena is also known as the \"Cocopalm City of the South\". Nestled midst a wide expanse of coconut lands, Lucena has [[coconut oil]] mills which produce oil-based household products like cooking oil, soap, lard, margarine, and oil based medicines. Exora Cooking Oil and Vegetable Lard, and Miyami Cooking Oil are proudly made in this city. Tantuco Industries, JnJ Oil Industries, Inc., and Monaco Oil Company are some of the well-known coconut oil companies in the city.\n\nCar assembly and manufacturing plants have also established in the city, while [[Manila]]-based car shops are starting to put up some branches like [[Isuzu Philippines|Isuzu-Lucena]], [[Mitsubishi Motors Philippines|SFM-Lucena]], and [[Foton Motor]].\n\n==Places of interest==\n[[File:Quezon Convention Center, Lucena City.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Quezon Convention Center]]]]\nRoad network provides access from all key cities and towns in the island of [[Luzon]] to this highly urbanized city. Well-paved radial and by-pass routes criss-crossing in and out of the city facilitate the transport of unlimited assortment of merchandise, supplies, and raw materials to and from the city on a round-the-clock basis.\n\nOver the years, it was observed that a growing number of visitors from other places come to Lucena. Travelers of various types and sizes are drawn to Lucena because of modern facilities and good amenities that could be found in the city such as the [[Quezon Convention Center]] when the City of Lucena hosted the [[2004 SEABA Under-18 Championship]] qualifying tournament for the [[2004 FIBA Asia Under-18 Championship]] in [[India]], Kalilayan Civic Centre, Sentro Pastoral Auditorium, Alcala Sports Complex a two time host of a [[Palarong Pambansa]] (1976, 1989), Manuel S.

It also promotes the ways of life inherent among the people of Lucena. All these find exquisites and appreciative expressions through a mammoth gathering of colors, outlandish costumes and symbolic floats reminiscent of [[Mardi Gras]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[New Orleans]]. Originally intended as three days of spirited merrymaking in the streets, the event has become a weeklong tourist attraction, culminating on May 30 in time for the celebration of the Feast of St. Ferdinand, the patron saint of Lucena.\n\nAnother feast highlighting the entire celebration is the Chami Festival that would feature Lucena's very own pansit delicacy. The traditional Chami Festival has a contest of who can cook the most delicious chami. The contestants line up along Quezon Avenue, the city's main road, armed with their cooking utensils and will be provided free chami noodles, meat and other condiments for the cooking fest. All participants were also given cash incentive, gift packs from various sponsors. After the cooking, the spectators were given a chance to eat for free the different taste of chami. They wanted that through this chami cooking festival this city will become a destination of our local and foreign tourists every merry month of May.\n\n==Local government==\nPursuant to Chapter II, Title II, Book III of Republic Act No. 7160 or the Local Government Code of 1991,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1991/ra_7160_1991.html |title=An Act Providing for a Local Government Code of 1991 |publisher=8th Congress of the Republic of the Philippines |accessdate=21 April 2014}}</ref> the city government is to be composed of a [[Mayor of Bacoor|mayor]] (''alkalde''), a [[vice mayor]] (''bise alkalde'') and [[councilors|members]] (''kagawad'') of the legislative branch [[Sangguniang Panlungsod]] alongside a secretary to the said legislature, all of which are elected to a three-year term and are eligible to run for three consecutive terms.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0; margin-top:0;\" align=center\n! colspan=2 bgcolor=\"peach\" align=\"center\" | City Government of Lucena<br />(2016-2019)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!colspan=2 align=\"center\" | Representative\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n|colspan=2 align=\"center\" | Vicente \"Kulit\" J.

New and modern buses ply the route Buendia/LRT1-Lucena, EDSA Pasay-Lucena, Cubao/Kamias-Lucena and Alabang/Starmall-Lucena or UV Express Van to [[Taytay, Rizal]] Via [[Antipolo City]], [[Manila East Road]], [[Pililla Wind Farm]] and [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] East, [[Lucban]], [[Tayabas]]. It serves not only [[Manila]] -bound buses but also buses going toward the upland and far-flung areas of Quezon province, particularly Bondoc Peninsula towns. Bus companies such as JAC Liner, Lucena Lines, JAM Liner, DLTBCo and N. Dela Rosa Bus Lines bring passengers to Manila and Lucena back and forth. Lucena also has a wide network of jeepney routes, all emanating from the city proper (''Bayan'') and reaching out to the major barangays of the city, as well as nearby towns. Thousand of tricycles also roam the streets of the city, bringing passengers right at their point of destination. These tricycles usually are the mode of transport when night falls. The [[South Luzon Expressway]] ([[South Luzon Expressway|SLEX]]) Toll Road 4 (TR-4) Extension from [[Santo Tomas, Batangas]] will end in Lucena City at the connection of Old [[Manila]] South Road. It will be finished by 2019.\n\nThere exists a Lucena Airport, but no commercial flights come to the city. Light aircraft can, however, make use of the facilities.\n\nThe [[Philippine National Railways]] (PNR) is on the process of rehabilitating the existing [[Manila]]-[[Bicol Region|Bicol]] and [[Baguio]]-[[Bicol Region|Bicol]] Railway Line, which includes stops in [[Quezon province]], including [[Lucena railway station|PNR Lucena station]], which traditionally then is a major loading & pick-up point for passengers and cargoes alike when the railway system was once the primary transportation mode going to Manila. Modern air-conditioned coaches will ply this route.\n\n[[File:Port of Lucena (2).JPG|thumb|200px|right|The Passenger Ferry Terminal in Lucena has RORO vessels that transport passengers across [[Tayabas Bay]] to [[Marinduque]], [[Romblon (province)|Romblon]] and [[Masbate]].]]\nThe Port of Lucena, located {{convert|130|km}} southeast of [[Manila]], is known as the gateway and melting pot city of Southern [[Luzon]].

It is the capital city of the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Quezon Province|Quezon]] where it is geographically situated but, in terms of government and administration, the city is politically independent from the province. For statistical and geographical purposes, {{PH wikidata|name}} is grouped with the province of [[Quezon Province|Quezon]]. According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nIn the 1570s,  Captain Juan de Salcedo first explored what was the province of Tayabas. The [[Order of Friars Minor|Franciscan]] priests Juan de Plasencia and Diego de Oropesa between 1580 and 1583 founded its town, also named Tayabas. Tayabas was organized by the Spaniards through the [[Franciscan]] missionaries and Lucena was just one of its barrios.\n\nThe Spaniards of the 16th century called the area \"'''Buenavista'''\" because of its scenic beauty; several years later, the barrio was renamed \"'''Oroquieta'''\". A century later, Muslim pirates began terrorizing the entire Philippine coastline, and Oroquieta was not spared from the notorious raids. The barrio folks built forts along the seashores to defend it against the attacking pirates along the coast, particularly in the present-day Cotta and in Barangay Mayao, though these structures are no longer extant. Hence, the place became known as '''''Cotta''''', the Spanish form of the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] \"''kuta''\" (\"fort\"). The growth of local maritime trade facilitated in the Cotta port and the final defeat of Moro pirates plying the Luzon and Visayan waters, afforded the growth of Lucena as a town which eventually led to its being the capital of Tayabas, Quezon province in 1901.\n\nFinally on November 5, 1879, the Orden Superior Civil officially adopted the name \"'''Lucena'''\" in honor of a Spanish friar by the name of ''Father Mariano Granja'' in [[Andalucia]], Spain. Fr. Granja was responsible for the development of the barrio that became a Parish in 1881. Lucena became an independent municipality on June 1, 1882.\n\nDuring the 1896 [[Philippine Revolution]], the people of Lucena showed their brand of patriotism. Jos\u00e9 Zaballero led the local revolutionists who were under the barrage of Spanish muskets. Later, Miguel Arguilles with Jose Barcelona as President formed a revolutionary government in Lucena.\n\nAfter Aguinaldo proclaimed the nation's independence on June 12, 1898 in [[Kawit, Cavite]], Gen. [[Miguel Malvar]], as Commanding General for Southern Luzon, took over Tayabas Province on August 15, 1898. Don Crisanto Marquez became Lucena's first elected Municipal president during the first Philippine Republic.\n\n===Modern history===\nLucena's fertile soil became soaked with the blood of many Filipinos and Americans at the outbreak of the Filipino-American War in 1899. The foreigners established a civil government in the country, and on March 12, 1901, the provincial capital was transferred from Tayabas to Lucena.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Japanese Imperial Force occupied Lucena on December 27, 1941, 19 days after they set foot on Philippine soil. But the underground resistance movement was so tenacious in Lucena that by January 25, 1945 (even before the Americans have returned), the Hunters ROTC guerrillas penetrated into the town and successfully drove out the Japanese. The rest of Quezon Province (new name of Tayabas Province) had to wait for the American Liberation forces and the Philippine Commonwealth troops to hand freedom on April 4 of that same year.\n\nOn June 17, 1961, by virtue of Republic Act No. 3271, Lucena was made into a Chartered City through the efforts of then Congressman Manuel S. Enverga. It was officially inaugurated on August 19, 1962, during the 84th anniversary of Manuel Luis Quezon. On July 1, 1991, Lucena became a Highly Urbanized City.\n\nIn May 2014, the Lucena City Public Market was razed by fire while festivities were being held for the culmination of Pasayahan sa Lucena a few blocks away. The whole block of the public market building was burned down. Through the cooperation of firefighters from Sariaya, Tayabas, Pagbilao and Lucena.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/606376/fire-destroys-lucena-market|title=Fire destroys Lucena market|last=Jr.|first=Delfin T.

The 2-storey building, which reportedly cost 99 million pesos to build, was financed through loans. According to the article, the Lucena Public Market was also burned down in 1965 along with huge parts of the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/827706/new-lucena-city-market-rises-from-the-ashes|title=New Lucena City market rises from the ashes|last=Jr.|first=Delfin T.

Gulang-gulang, Lucena City, [[Quezon]]. The project was initially funded in the 2017 national budget at around \u20b1100 million. The remaining half was funded through the 2018 national budget. According to DPWH Secretary [[Mark Villar]], the 472-meter long underpass with a 16 lineal-meter concrete bridge at the Lucena-Tayabas-Mauban Port Road aims to reduce the traffic congestion around the Daang Maharlika Route. This new underpass would directly shorten the travel time of those traversing Quezon Province such as those coming from Manila going to the Bicol region and vice versa. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Tuquero |first1=Loreben |title=DPWH opens P245-million underpass in Lucena |url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/243216-underpass-opens-in-lucena |accessdate=26 February 2020 |publisher=Rappler.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=\u20b1245-M Lucena underpass opens |url=https://cnnphilippines.com/regional/2019/10/23/Lucena-underpass-opens.html |accessdate=26 February 2020 |publisher=CNN Philippines}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:LucenaCityRiverjf7895 03.JPG|thumb|left|Iyam River in Cotta]]\nIt is situated 132 kilometers (82 mi) south of Manila. The city proper is wedged between two rivers, Dumacaa River on the east and Iyam River on the west. Seven other rivers and six creeks serve as natural drainage for the city. Its port on the coast along [[Tayabas Bay]] is home to several boat and ferry lines operating and serving the sea lanes between Lucena and the different points in the region and as far as the [[Visayas]].\n\nThere exists a Lucena Airport (known locally as 'Landing') located 300 meters west of [[AMA College]] Lucena Campus but is no longer usable. Light aircraft can no longer make use of it as a road was built as an intersection during the presidency of [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]].\n\nBeing the provincial capital, Lucena is host to most of the branches of governmental agencies, businesses, banks and service facilities in the [[Southern Tagalog]] region.\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Barangays==\nLucena is politically subdivided into 33 [[barangay]]s.\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*Barangay 1 ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay 2 ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay 3 ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay 4 ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay 5 ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay 6 ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay 7 ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay 8 ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay 9 ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay 10 ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay 11 ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barra\n*Bocohan\n*Cotta\n*Gulang-Gulang \n*Dalahican \n*Domoit\n*Ibabang Dupay \n*Ibabang Iyam \n*Ibabang Talim\n*Ilayang Dupay\n*Ilayang Iyam\n*Ilayang Talim\n*Isabang\n*Market View\n*Mayao Castillo\n*Mayao Crossing\n*Mayao Kanluran\n*Mayao Parada\n*Mayao Silangan\n*Ransohan\n*Salinas\n*Talao-Talao\n}}\n\n===Climate===\nLucena falls under Type III of the Corona\u2019s climatic classification system.

As population grows in tandem with new and promising business prospects, business activities spill over adjoining barangays, thus forming mini satellite commercial areas.\n\nOther commercial strips are located in the poblacion and suburban barangays where both retail and wholesale trade, including other essential services, are being engaged in. [[SM City Lucena]] is the biggest mall in the city located in Ibabang Dupay, which is one of the first [[SM Prime|SM Malls]] in [[Luzon]]. Other Shopping Centers Include: SM Savemore Agora, Super Metro Lucena, Pacific Mall Lucena and many more.\n\n===Industrial===\nBig factories and warehouses are present in these suburban barangays like [[San Miguel Brewery]], [[Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc.]], [[PepsiCo Inc.|PepsiCo Philippines, Inc.]], [[Asia Brewery, Inc.]] [[Nestl\u00e9|Nestl\u00e9 Philippines]], and [[Ginebra San Miguel|Ginebra San Miguel, Inc.]] (formerly La Tonde\u00f1a Distillers Inc.), do business in sales, distribution, and transport of assorted business products in bulk.\n\nOf the total 8,316.90 hectare land area of Lucena City, 19 percent or 1,651.77 hectares cover the existing built up area. Almost 3% of this or 46.62 hectares cover the industrial section, located in different barangays of the city. These areas are home to significant industrial and manufacturing activities.\n\nIndustry in Lucena produces a sustainable amount of agro-industrial based products, dried and smoked fish, distilled liquors, bamboo and rattan furniture, ornamental flowers/plants, vegetable as well as meat products.\n\nLucena is also known as the \"Cocopalm City of the South\". Nestled midst a wide expanse of coconut lands, Lucena has [[coconut oil]] mills which produce oil-based household products like cooking oil, soap, lard, margarine, and oil based medicines. Exora Cooking Oil and Vegetable Lard, and Miyami Cooking Oil are proudly made in this city. Tantuco Industries, JnJ Oil Industries, Inc., and Monaco Oil Company are some of the well-known coconut oil companies in the city.\n\nCar assembly and manufacturing plants have also established in the city, while [[Manila]]-based car shops are starting to put up some branches like [[Isuzu Philippines|Isuzu-Lucena]], [[Mitsubishi Motors Philippines|SFM-Lucena]], and [[Foton Motor]].\n\n==Places of interest==\n[[File:Quezon Convention Center, Lucena City.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Quezon Convention Center]]]]\nRoad network provides access from all key cities and towns in the island of [[Luzon]] to this highly urbanized city. Well-paved radial and by-pass routes criss-crossing in and out of the city facilitate the transport of unlimited assortment of merchandise, supplies, and raw materials to and from the city on a round-the-clock basis.\n\nOver the years, it was observed that a growing number of visitors from other places come to Lucena. Travelers of various types and sizes are drawn to Lucena because of modern facilities and good amenities that could be found in the city such as the [[Quezon Convention Center]] when the City of Lucena hosted the [[2004 SEABA Under-18 Championship]] qualifying tournament for the [[2004 FIBA Asia Under-18 Championship]] in [[India]], Kalilayan Civic Centre, Sentro Pastoral Auditorium, Alcala Sports Complex a two time host of a [[Palarong Pambansa]] (1976, 1989), Manuel S. Enverga University Foundation Gymnasium, Sacred Heart College Gymnasium, and Marcial Punzalan Gymnasium. \n\n===Religious landmarks===\n[[File:LucenaCityCathedralVillajf7406 10.JPG|thumb|200px|Saint Ferdinand Cathedral]]\n*Saint Ferdinand Cathedral, Barangay V\n*Saint Jude Thaddeus Parish Church, Barangay Cotta\n*Our Lady of Carmelite Monastery, Barangay XI\n*Our Lady of Lourdes Parish Church, Barangay Ibabang Iyam\n*Our Lady of Pe\u00f1afrancia Parish Church Diocesan Shrine, Hermanas Capistrano Subdivision, Barangay Gulang-Gulang\n*St. Alphonsus Regional Seminary, Barangay Isabang\n*St. Andrew The Apostle Chapel, Camp Guillermo Nakar, Barangay Gulang-Gulang\n*Church of the Holy Face of Jesus, University Village (Site), Barangay Ibabang Dupay\n*St. Raphael The Archangel Parish, Barangay Dalahican\n*St. Isidore Labrador, Barangay Ibabang Dupay\n*Holy Family Church, Centro Pastoral Compound, Barangay Isabang\n*Our Lady Of Miraculous Medal Chapel, Barangay IX\n\n===Natural attractions===\n*Botanical Garden\n*Orchids Country Farm\n*Perez Park\n*Eco Park\n\n===Festivals===\n[[File:Pasayahan sa Lucena 2013 Street Dance Competition.jpg|thumb|200px|right|during the Pasayahan sa Lucena 2013 Street Dance Competition]]\nPasayahan sa Lucena was conceptualized to showcase the natural and ecological interrelationship and independence between nature and man. It also promotes the ways of life inherent among the people of Lucena. All these find exquisites and appreciative expressions through a mammoth gathering of colors, outlandish costumes and symbolic floats reminiscent of [[Mardi Gras]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[New Orleans]]. Originally intended as three days of spirited merrymaking in the streets, the event has become a weeklong tourist attraction, culminating on May 30 in time for the celebration of the Feast of St. Ferdinand, the patron saint of Lucena.\n\nAnother feast highlighting the entire celebration is the Chami Festival that would feature Lucena's very own pansit delicacy. The traditional Chami Festival has a contest of who can cook the most delicious chami. The contestants line up along Quezon Avenue, the city\u2019s main road, armed with their cooking utensils and will be provided free chami noodles, meat and other condiments for the cooking fest. All participants were also given cash incentive, gift packs from various sponsors. After the cooking, the spectators were given a chance to eat for free the different taste of chami. They wanted that through this chami cooking festival this city will become a destination of our local and foreign tourists every merry month of May.\n\n==Local government==\nPursuant to Chapter II, Title II, Book III of Republic Act No. 7160 or the Local Government Code of 1991,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1991/ra_7160_1991.html |title=An Act Providing for a Local Government Code of 1991 |publisher=8th Congress of the Republic of the Philippines |accessdate=21 April 2014}}</ref> the city government is to be composed of a [[Mayor of Bacoor|mayor]] (''alkalde''), a [[vice mayor]] (''bise alkalde'') and [[councilors|members]] (''kagawad'') of the legislative branch [[Sangguniang Panlungsod]] alongside a secretary to the said legislature, all of which are elected to a three-year term and are eligible to run for three consecutive terms.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0; margin-top:0;\" align=center\n! colspan=2 bgcolor=\"peach\" align=\"center\" | City Government of Lucena<br />(2016-2019)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!colspan=2 align=\"center\" | Representative\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n|colspan=2 align=\"center\" | Vicente \"Kulit\" J.

New and modern buses ply the route Buendia/LRT1-Lucena, EDSA Pasay-Lucena, Cubao/Kamias-Lucena and Alabang/Starmall-Lucena or UV Express Van to [[Taytay, Rizal]] Via [[Antipolo City]], [[Manila East Road]], [[Pililla Wind Farm]] and [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] East, [[Lucban]], [[Tayabas]]. It serves not only [[Manila]] -bound buses but also buses going toward the upland and far-flung areas of Quezon province, particularly Bondoc Peninsula towns. Bus companies such as JAC Liner, Lucena Lines, JAM Liner, DLTBCo and N. Dela Rosa Bus Lines bring passengers to Manila and Lucena back and forth. Lucena also has a wide network of jeepney routes, all emanating from the city proper (''Bayan'') and reaching out to the major barangays of the city, as well as nearby towns. Thousand of tricycles also roam the streets of the city, bringing passengers right at their point of destination. These tricycles usually are the mode of transport when night falls. The [[South Luzon Expressway]] ([[South Luzon Expressway|SLEX]]) Toll Road 4 (TR-4) Extension from [[Santo Tomas, Batangas]] will end in Lucena City at the connection of Old [[Manila]] South Road. It will be finished by 2019.\n\nThere exists a Lucena Airport, but no commercial flights come to the city. Light aircraft can, however, make use of the facilities.\n\nThe [[Philippine National Railways]] (PNR) is on the process of rehabilitating the existing [[Manila]]-[[Bicol Region|Bicol]] and [[Baguio]]-[[Bicol Region|Bicol]] Railway Line, which includes stops in [[Quezon province]], including [[Lucena railway station|PNR Lucena station]], which traditionally then is a major loading & pick-up point for passengers and cargoes alike when the railway system was once the primary transportation mode going to Manila. Modern air-conditioned coaches will ply this route.\n\n[[File:Port of Lucena (2).JPG|thumb|200px|right|The Passenger Ferry Terminal in Lucena has RORO vessels that transport passengers across [[Tayabas Bay]] to [[Marinduque]], [[Romblon (province)|Romblon]] and [[Masbate]].]]\nThe Port of Lucena, located {{convert|130|km}} southeast of [[Manila]], is known as the gateway and melting pot city of Southern [[Luzon]].

Both types of institutions are considered to provide the same standard of healthcare and services, differing mainly with the medical and diagnostic facilities at hand.\n\nThese are staffed with qualified medical practitioners that are well-versed in English. The doctors are graduates of the many top reputable medical schools in the [[Philippines]]; most have pursued further studies and training in the [[United States]]. Likewise, the nurses are the products of the many credible nursing schools in the country. These same institutions have produced the many Filipino nurses working in the [[United States]], [[Europe]], [[Middle East]], and other parts of the world.\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*Lucena United Memorial District Hospital, 178 Merchan Street\n*Lucena MMG General Hospital, Maharlika Highway, Ibabang Dupay\n*Mt.

Boukouvalas published in 1905 in Cairo a brief brochure under the title \"The language of the Bulgarophones in Macedonia\" (1905). This essay, which assumed the Slav character of the foreign-language idioms of Greek Macedonia by naming them \"Bulgarian\", included a long list of Slavic words with Greek roots which are used in the dialects. ... Konstantinos Tsioulkas published in 1907 in Athens a book over 350 pages in length to prove the ancient Greek character of the idioms in Greek Macecionia!... : \"Contributions to the bilinguism of the Macedonians by comparison of the Slav'-like Macedonian language to Greek\" ... Tsioulkas \"proved\" through a series of \"etymological\" lists that the inhabitants of Greece's Macedonia spoke a pure Ancient-Greek dialect. ... In 1948 by a third teacher, Giorgos Georgiades, (wrote) under the promising title \"The mixed idiom in Macedonia and the ethnological situation of the Macedonians who speak it\". Here it is stated that many words from the dialects maintain their \"Ancient Greek character\". Still, the language itself was presented as a mixture of Greek, Turkish and words borrowed from other languages. As a result, the author found himself incapable of defining it as either Greek or Slav. In examining such publications, one will easily recognise ideological and methodological similarities. One common factor for all the authors is that they ignored not only the dialects they wrote about, but also the Slavic languages entirely. This fact did not hinder them in creating or republishing etymological lists tracing every Slavic word back to Ancient Greek with fictional correlations.}}</ref> Among them, Boukouvalas promoted an enormous influence of the [[Greek language]] on a Bulgarian idiom and a discussion about their probable Greek descent.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> Tsioulkas followed him by publishing a large book, where he \"proved\" through an \"etymological\" approach, that these idioms are a pure [[Ancient Greek]] dialect.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> A publication of the third teacher followed, Giorgos Georgiades, who presented the language as a mixture of Greek, Turkish and other loanwords, but was incapable of deifining the dialects as either Greek or Slav.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/>\n\nSerbian dialectology does not usually extend the Serbian dialects to Greek Macedonia, but an unconventional classification has been maken by [[Aleksandar Beli\u0107]], a convinced Serbian nationalist, who regarded the dialects as [[Serbian dialects|Serbian]].<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> In [[:File:Balkan dialects belic 1914.jpg|his classification]] he distinguished three categories of dialects in Greek Macedonia: a Serbo-Macedonian dialect, a Bulgaro-Macedonian teritorry where Serbian is spoken and a Non-Slavic territory.\n\n=== Ban for use ===\nAfter the conclusion of the [[First World War]] a widespread policy of Hellenisation was implemented in the Greek region of Macedonia.{{sfn|HRW|1994|p=?}}<ref name=\"Nettle 2000 175\">{{cite book\n | last = Nettle\n | first = Daniel\n | authorlink = \n | author2 = Suzanne Romaine\n | title = Vanishing Voices: The Extinction of the World's Languages\n | publisher = Oxford University Press US\n | year = 2000\n | location = \n | page = [https://archive.org/details/vanishingvoicese00nett_0/page/175 175]\n | isbn = 0-19-513624-1\n | url = https://archive.org/details/vanishingvoicese00nett_0/page/175\n }}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n | last = Pentzopoulos\n | first = Dimitri\n | title = The Balkan exchange of minorities and its impact on Greece\n | publisher = C.

The Makedonska Iskra was also thrown into confusion by the expulsion of Yugoslavia from the [[Cominform]].<ref>Miriam Gilson, Jerzy Zubrzycki, The Foreign-language Press in Australia, 1848-1964, Australian National University, 1967, p. 149.</ref> The newspaper was printed in the [[Latin alphabet]]. Its articles were not in standard Macedonian but in local Slavic dialects of Greece. Some of the Slavic texts were in mixed Bulgaro-Macedonian language or were written in [[Bulgarian language]].<ref>Voenno-istoricheski sbornik, Volume 64, Issues 1-2, Institut za voenna istoria, Ministerstvo na otbranata, Sofia, 1995, str. 49.</ref> A monthly with national distribution, it commenced in Perth and later moved to Melbourne and Sydney.\n\n===\"Pomak language\" ===\n{{Main|Pomak language}}\nIn Greece, all attempts to write in [[Pomak language]] in formal publications have been criticized because their script, whether it was in Greek or in \nLatin. Since the 1990s several publications in Pomak dialect have been issued, using the Greek script or using the Latin. Some criticisms to these publications were related to their funding sources. For example by the cases using the [[Greek script]], two volumes of a textbooks were printed in 2004. Their author was Nikos Kokkas and  publisher ''Pakethra''. The funding here was provided by a Greek businessman and directly through his company. The preface of a Pomak primer presents it as one of the \u201clesser-spoken languages\u201d of Europe.<ref>Vemund Aarbakke, \u201cPomak Language Usage and the Spell of Nationalism\u2014The Case of the Pomaks in Greece,\u201d Slavia Islamica: language, religion and identity, edited by Robert D.

It is even not used in the local Pomak newspaper \"Zagalisa\", that is published in Greek. Recently, the use of Pomak is preferred in a new  local newspaper \"Natpresh\". Pomak is not being actively promoted neither by Pomak communities, nor by the Greek authorities. The result is a strong language shift in Greece towards Turkish.<ref>Evangelia Adamou, Davide Fanciullo. Why Pomak will not be the next Slavic literary language. D. Stern; M. Nomachi; B. Beli\u0107.

Boukouvalas published in 1905 in Cairo a brief brochure under the title \"The language of the Bulgarophones in Macedonia\" (1905). This essay, which assumed the Slav character of the foreign-language idioms of Greek Macedonia by naming them \"Bulgarian\", included a long list of Slavic words with Greek roots which are used in the dialects. ... Konstantinos Tsioulkas published in 1907 in Athens a book over 350 pages in length to prove the ancient Greek character of the idioms in Greek Macecionia!... : \"Contributions to the bilinguism of the Macedonians by comparison of the Slav'-like Macedonian language to Greek\" ... Tsioulkas \"proved\" through a series of \"etymological\" lists that the inhabitants of Greece's Macedonia spoke a pure Ancient-Greek dialect. ... In 1948 by a third teacher, Giorgos Georgiades, (wrote) under the promising title \"The mixed idiom in Macedonia and the ethnological situation of the Macedonians who speak it\". Here it is stated that many words from the dialects maintain their \"Ancient Greek character\". Still, the language itself was presented as a mixture of Greek, Turkish and words borrowed from other languages. As a result, the author found himself incapable of defining it as either Greek or Slav. In examining such publications, one will easily recognise ideological and methodological similarities. One common factor for all the authors is that they ignored not only the dialects they wrote about, but also the Slavic languages entirely. This fact did not hinder them in creating or republishing etymological lists tracing every Slavic word back to Ancient Greek with fictional correlations.}}</ref> Among them, Boukouvalas promoted an enormous influence of the [[Greek language]] on a Bulgarian idiom and a discussion about their probable Greek descent.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> Tsioulkas followed him by publishing a large book, where he \"proved\" through an \"etymological\" approach, that these idioms are a pure [[Ancient Greek]] dialect.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> A publication of the third teacher followed, Giorgos Georgiades, who presented the language as a mixture of Greek, Turkish and other loanwords, but was incapable of deifining the dialects as either Greek or Slav.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/>\n\nSerbian dialectology does not usually extend the Serbian dialects to Greek Macedonia, but an unconventional classification has been maken by [[Aleksandar Beli\u0107]], a convinced Serbian nationalist, who regarded the dialects as [[Serbian dialects|Serbian]].<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> In [[:File:Balkan dialects belic 1914.jpg|his classification]] he distinguished three categories of dialects in Greek Macedonia: a Serbo-Macedonian dialect, a Bulgaro-Macedonian teritorry where Serbian is spoken and a Non-Slavic territory.\n\n=== Ban for use ===\nAfter the conclusion of the [[First World War]] a widespread policy of Hellenisation was implemented in the Greek region of Macedonia.{{sfn|HRW|1994|p=?}}<ref name=\"Nettle 2000 175\">{{cite book\n | last = Nettle\n | first = Daniel\n | authorlink = \n | author2 = Suzanne Romaine\n | title = Vanishing Voices: The Extinction of the World's Languages\n | publisher = Oxford University Press US\n | year = 2000\n | location = \n | page = [https://archive.org/details/vanishingvoicese00nett_0/page/175 175]\n | isbn = 0-19-513624-1\n | url = https://archive.org/details/vanishingvoicese00nett_0/page/175\n }}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n | last = Pentzopoulos\n | first = Dimitri\n | title = The Balkan exchange of minorities and its impact on Greece\n | publisher = C.

As result the Greek communist publisher \"Nea Ellada\" issued a Macedonian grammar (1952) and developed a different alphabet.  Between 1952 and 1956, the Macedonian Department of Nea Hellas published a number of issues in this literary standard, officially called \"Macedonian language of the Slavomacedonians from Greek or Aegean Macedonia\".

It is even not used in the local Pomak newspaper \"Zagalisa\", that is published in Greek. Recently, the use of Pomak is preferred in a new  local newspaper \"Natpresh\". Pomak is not being actively promoted neither by Pomak communities, nor by the Greek authorities.

This site was chosen by Vice-Governor-General Emile Wangerm\u00e9e because of its proximity to the copper mine of ''[[Etoile du Congo Mine|Etoile du Congo]]'' and the copper ore smelting oven installed by [[Union Mini\u00e8re du Haut Katanga]] on the nearby Lubumbashi river.\nThe Comit\u00e9 Sp\u00e9cial du Katanga (CSK), a semi-private concessionary company set up in 1906, had its headquarters in Elisabethville throughout the colonial era. It enjoyed major privileges, mainly in terms of land and mining concessions, in the Katanga province.\n\nThe city prospered with the development of a regional copper mining industry.<ref>Brion, R. and J.-L. Moreau (2006), ''De la mine \u00e0 Mars, La gen\u00e8se d'Umicore'', Tielt : Lannoo.</ref> Huge investments in the 1920s, both in the mining industry and in transport infrastructure (railline Elisabethville-Port Francqui and Elisabethville-Dilolo), developed the Katanga province into one of the world's major copper ore producers. The population of the city grew apace from approx. 30,000 in 1930, to 50,000 in 1943 and 180,000 in 1957. It was the second city of the [[Belgian Congo]], after L\u00e9opoldville.\n\n[[File:Belgian Neighborhood, Lubumbashi, DRC.jpg|thumb|The Belgian Quarter in Lubumbashi]]\n\nAs was customary in sub-Saharan colonies, the city centre of Elisabethville was reserved for the white (European) population. This consisted mainly of Belgian nationals, but the city also attracted important British and Italian communities, as well as [[History of the Jews in Greece|Jewish Greeks]]. Congolese were allowed in the white city only during the day, except for the house servants (\"boys\") who often lived in shanty dwellings (\"boyeries\") located in the backyards of the European city houses.\nMany men in the black population were labour immigrants from neighbouring regions in the Belgian Congo (Northern Katanga, Maniema, Kasa\u00ef), from Belgian Rwanda and Burundi, and from British Northern Rhodesia (Zambia).<ref>Fetter, Bruce (1976), ''The Creation of Elisabethville, 1910\u20131940'', Stanford: Hoover Institution Press.</ref> The black population lived initially in a so-called ''cit\u00e9 indig\u00e8ne'' called quartier Albert (now: Kamalondo), south of the city centre and separated from the white city by a 700-metres-wide neutral zone. With population growth, new indigenous quarters were created. These still form the main suburbs of present-day Lubumbashi: Kenia, Katuba, Ruashi. The work and businesses related to the mines made Elisabethville the most prosperous region of the Congo during the final decade of Belgian rule. In 1954 there were 8,000 black home owners in the city while thousands more were skilled workers. It was estimated that black Africans living in Elisabethville had a higher standard of living than anywhere else on the continent at that time.<ref>John Gunther,''Inside Africa,'' Hamish Hamilton Ltd. London, 1955,  page 640</ref>\n\n[[File:Lubumbashi Palais de Justice 2.jpg|thumb|right|Lubumbashi: 1920s Palace of Justice]]\n\nMiners in \u00c9lisabethville conducted a strike in December 1941 to protest the increasingly severe forced-labor regime that the Belgians imposed on the population because of the \"war efforts\".<ref>Dibwe dia Mwembu, Donatien (2001), ''Histoire des conditions de vie des travailleurs de l'Union Mini\u00e8re du Haut-Katanga et G\u00e9camines, 1910\u20131999'', Lubumbashi : Presses Universitaires de Lubumbashi.</ref> A rally in the Union Mini\u00e8re football stadium got out of hand. Police opened fire and numerous protesters were killed. In early 1944, the city was again in the grip of severe tensions and fear of violent protests, following a mutiny of the [[Force Publique]] (army) in Luluabourg.<ref>Rubens, Antoine (1945), ''Dettes de guerre'', Lubumbashi: L'essor du Congo.</ref>\n\nStarting in 1933, the Belgian colonial authorities experimented with a limited form of self-governance by establishing the cit\u00e9 indig\u00e8ne of Elisabethville as a so-called \"centre extra-coutumier\" (a centre not subject to customary law). It was administered by an indigenous council and presided over by an indigenous chief. But, due to constant interference from the Belgian authorities, the experiment soon proved a failure.<ref>Gr\u00e9visse, F. (1951), ''Le Centre Extra-Coutumier d\u2019Elisabethville'', Elisabethville-Bruxelles: CEPSI-Institut Royal Colonial Belge.</ref> The first indigenous chief \u2013 Albert Kabongo \u2013 appointed in 1937, was dismissed in 1943 and not replaced.\n\nIn 1957 Elisabethville was established as a fully autonomous city; it held the first free municipal elections in which the Congolese could vote. The people of \u00c9lisabethville gave a vast majority to the nationalist [[Alliance des Bakongo]], which demanded immediate independence from Belgium.\n\nElisabethville functioned as the administrative capital of the Katanga province. It was also an important commercial and industrial centre, and a centre of education and health services. The [[Benedictine Order]] and missionary [[Order of Salesians]] offered a wide range of educational facilities to Europeans and Congolese alike, including vocational training (Kafubu). The Belgians established the University of \u00c9lisabethville in 1954\u20131955 (now the [[University of Lubumbashi]]).\n\n[[File:Lubumbashi cathedral S Pierre et Paul.jpg|thumb|Lubumbashi: [[Sts. Peter and Paul Cathedral, Lubumbashi|Sts. Peter and Paul Cathedral]]]]\n[[File:Square in Lubumbashi, 2011.jpg|thumb|Lubumbashi in 2011]]\n\n=== Lubumbashi from 1960 ===\n\u00c9lisabethville served as the capital and centre of the secessionist independent state of [[State of Katanga#Secession|Katanga]] during the 1960\u20131963 Congolese civil war. [[Moise Tshombe]] proclaimed Katangan independence in July 1960.  Congolese leaders arrested him and charged him with treason in April 1961; however, he agreed to dismiss his foreign advisers and military forces in exchange for his release.  Tshombe returned to \u00c9lisabethville but repudiated these assurances and began to fight anew.  United Nations troops opposed Katangan forces and took control of the city in December 1961 under a strong mandate. [[Roger Trinquier]], well known for his published works on counter-insurgency warfare, served as a French military advisor to President Tshombe until international pressure, led by Belgium, caused his recall to France.\n\n[[Mobutu Sese Seko]] ultimately assumed power of the Congo, which he renamed Za\u00efre. He renamed \u00c9lisabethville as \"Lubumbashi\" in 1966 and in 1972 renamed Katanga as \"Shaba.\"\n\nIn May 1990, the university campus of Lubumbashi was the scene of a brutal killing of students by Mobutu's security forces. In 1991\u201392 ethnic tensions between the Luba from Katanga and the Luba from Kasa\u00ef, resident in the city, led to violent confrontations and the forced removal from the city of the latter.\n\nCongo entered another genocidal civil war in the late 1990s.  The [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo]] rebels captured Lubumbashi in April 1997. Rebel leader [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]] spoke from Lubumbashi to declare himself president of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] on 17 May 1997 after Mobutu Sese Seko fled Kinshasa.\n\nWhen Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila decided to appoint a transitional parliament, in 1999, he decided to install the Parliament in Lubumbashi, in order to consolidate the fragile unity of the country. The parliament was installed in the building of the National Assembly of secessionist Katanga (the former city theatre), which had its capital in this city as well, in the 1960s. Lubumbashi was therefore the Legislative capital of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] from 1999 to 2003, when all the country's central institutions were brought back to Kinshasa.\n\nOn 7 September 2010 a large prison break happened in Lubumbashi after gunmen attacked a prison on the outskirts of the city. 960 prisoners managed to escape, including the [[Mai-Mai]] leader [[G\u00e9d\u00e9on Kyungu Mutanga]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=39478&Cr=democratic&Cr1=congo |date=7 September 2011 |accessdate=8 September 2011 |title=UN voices concern after mass prison outbreak in DR Congo |publisher=UN News Center}}</ref> On 23 March 2013 a militia group of 100 fighters attacked Lubumbashi and seized a United Nations compound, which was surrounded by Congolese soldiers and members of the president's Republican Guard.<ref name=BloombergKavanagh />\n\n== Geography ==\n:''See also: {{illm|List of communes of Lubumbashi|fr|Liste des communes de Lubumbashi}}''\nLubumbashi lies at around {{Convert|1208|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. The high altitude serves to cool the climate, which would otherwise be very hot. The [[Kafue River]] rises along the Zambian border near the city and meanders through north-central [[Zambia]] to the [[Zambezi River]], cutting a long, deep panhandle into the country.\n\n===Climate===\nLubumbashi has a dry-winter [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cwa'', according to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]), with warm rainy summers and pleasant, dry winters, with most rainfall occurring during summer and early autumn. Annual average rainfall is 1,238&nbsp;mm (48.75 inches).\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Lubumbashi\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 26\n|Feb high C = 26\n|Mar high C = 26\n|Apr high C = 27\n|May high C = 26\n|Jun high C = 25\n|Jul high C = 25\n|Aug high C = 27\n|Sep high C = 30\n|Oct high C = 31\n|Nov high C = 28\n|Dec high C = 26\n|year high C = \n|Jan mean C = 21\n|Feb mean C = 21\n|Mar mean C = 21\n|Apr mean C = 20.5\n|May mean C = 18\n|Jun mean C = 16.5\n|Jul mean C = 16.5\n|Aug mean C = 18\n|Sep mean C = 21\n|Oct mean C = 23\n|Nov mean C = 22\n|Dec mean C = 21\n|year mean C = \n|Jan low C = 16\n|Feb low C = 16\n|Mar low C = 16\n|Apr low C = 14\n|May low C = 10\n|Jun low C = 8\n|Jul low C = 8\n|Aug low C = 9\n|Sep low C = 12\n|Oct low C = 15\n|Nov low C = 16\n|Dec low C = 16\n|year low C =\n|Jan rain mm = 253\n|Feb rain mm = 257\n|Mar rain mm = 202\n|Apr rain mm = 60\n|May rain mm = 4\n|Jun rain mm = 1\n|Jul rain mm = 0\n|Aug rain mm = 0\n|Sep rain mm = 4\n|Oct rain mm = 37\n|Nov rain mm = 163\n|Dec rain mm = 257\n|year rain mm = \n|Jan rain days = 24\n|Feb rain days = 23\n|Mar rain days = 21\n|Apr rain days = 9\n|May rain days = 2\n|Jun rain days = 0\n|Jul rain days = 0\n|Aug rain days = 0\n|Sep rain days = 1\n|Oct rain days = 5\n|Nov rain days = 17\n|Dec rain days = 24\n|year rain days = \n|source = https://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/congo-kinshasa/lubumbashi.php\n}}\n\n{|style=\"width:100%;text-align:center;line-height:1.2em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|-\n!Colspan=14|Maximum UV index for Lubumbashi\n|-\n!Month\n!Jan\n!Feb\n!Mar\n!Apr\n!May\n!Jun\n!Jul\n!Aug\n!Sep\n!Oct\n!Nov\n!Dec\n!Year\n|-\n!Average [[Ultraviolet index]]\n|style=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"|11+\n|style=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"|11+\n|style=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"|11+\n|style=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"|11+\n|style=\"background:#d8001d;color:#FFFFFF;\"|10\n|style=\"background:#d8001d;color:#FFFFFF;\"|9\n|style=\"background:#d8001d;color:#FFFFFF;\"|9\n|style=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"|11\n|style=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"|11+\n|style=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"|11+\n|style=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"|11+\n|style=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"|11+\n|style=\"background:#d8001d;color:#FFFFFF;border-left-width:medium\"|10.8\n|-\n!Colspan=14 style=\"background:#f8f9fa;font-weight:normal;font-size:95%;\"|Source: weather2travel.com <ref name=\"weather2travel.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/congo-kinshasa/lubumbashi.php |title=Lubumbashi, Democratic Republic of the Congo \u2013 Monthly weather forecast and Climate data |publisher=weather2travel.com |access-date=29 June 2019 }}</ref>\n|}\n\n== Demography ==\n=== Language(s) ===\n[[French language|French]] is the official language, but the main spoken [[lingua franca]] in Lubumbashi is [[Kiswahili]].

Manufactures include [[textiles]], food products and beverages, [[printing]], bricks, and copper smelting. The city is home to the Simba brewery, producing the famous Tembo beer.\n\nThe city hosts the headquarters of one of the country's largest banks, [[Trust Merchant Bank]].  The airline [[Korongo Airlines]], a joint-venture between [[Brussels Airlines]] and the Belgian multinational Groupe George Forrest International, also maintains its head office in Lubumbashi. The area also has a daily newspaper.\n\n[[File:Lubumbashi Storefront.jpg|thumb|Storefronts in Lubumbashi]]\n\n===Mining===\nLubumbashi, the mining capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is a base for many of the country's biggest mining companies. The Democratic Republic of Congo produces \"more than 3 percent of the world's copper and half its [[cobalt]], most of which comes from Katanga.\"<ref name=BloombergKavanagh />\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Lubumbashi International Airport.png|thumb|[[Lubumbashi International Airport]]]]\n===Road===\nThe city is crossed by [[Beira\u2013Lobito Highway|Transafican Highway 9]] (TAH 9), which connects it to the cities of [[Lusaka]] and [[Kolwezi]].\n\n===Rail===\nLubumbashi is the center of the railway lines from [[Cape to Cairo Railway]], which serves as a link with the cities of [[Ndola]], [[Ilebo]], [[Kindu]] and [[Sakania]]. \nIn [[Tenke, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Tenke]], the city connects with [[Kolwezi]], through the [[Benguela railway]].\n\n===Air===\nLubumbashi is home to the modern [[Lubumbashi International Airport]]. The city serves as a distribution centre for such minerals as copper, [[cobalt]], [[zinc]], [[tin]], and coal.\n\n== Education ==\n[[File:University of Lubumbashi.jpg|thumb|University of Lubumbashi]]\nThe largest institution of higher education is the [[University of Lubumbashi]], founded in 1955, with also the teaching institutions Protestant University of Lubumbashi and the Graduate Institute of Health Sciences.\n\n== Urban infrastructure ==\n===Parks===\nMuyambo Kyasa popularized the concept of parks. Muyambo Park opened in 2010. Located about 15&nbsp;km from Lubumbashi, it is a large garden where children can play games, and adults relax. Other parks (or farms) include Mikembo and Futuka (once a reserve, now closed) on Kasenga Road in the city's outskirts.\n\n===Zoo===\nThe zoo of Lubumbashi is one of the most visited tourist attractions. It was created during the colonial period, and is considered the nicest zoo in the country. During the years of war, it deteriorated but it has been rehabilitated by AZLU, a non-profit organization. By 2007, great animals had been acquired for the zoo.  AZLU is keeping the zoo \u201cfor education purposes, and the protection of the natural heritage of the country,\u201d as it can be read on signs. Today, it has almost been restocked with lions, tigers, monkeys, apes, pelicans, wart hogs, crocodiles, snakes, turtles, monitor lizards, eagles, parrots, ostriches, gazelles, etc. Apart from animals, the zoo features a restaurant, a veterinary center, and a termite museum.\n\n== Culture ==\nAttractions in the city include a [[botanical garden]], a [[zoo]], and the regional archaeological and ethnological [[National Museum of Lubumbashi]]. Every two years, the Biennale of Lubumbashi is held across the city, showcasing works by artists from the region. In an interview in Ocula Magazine in 2019, the Biennale's artistic director, Sandrine Colard explained, 'The Congo is a country that is perpetually in the future. All of these different periods coalescing in one city is something I wanted to address.'<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ocula.com/magazine/conversations/sandrine-colard/ |title=Sandrine Colard on the 6th Lubumbashi Biennale |last=Balogun |first=Emmanuel |date=13 Dec 2019 |website=Ocula Magazine |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191216210942/https://ocula.com/magazine/conversations/sandrine-colard/ |archive-date=16 Dec 2019 |access-date=1 Feb 2020}}</ref> \n\n===Art===\nBogumi\u0142 Jewsiewicki says that contemporary Lubumbashi art making is weak, especially when compared to the Kinshasan. He writes,\n<blockquote>\u201cNo Lubumbashi popular painter has had an international career like that of the Kinshasa artist Ch\u00e9ri Samba, and there are in fact a number of artists and musicians in Kinshasa whom the whirlwind of international success has whisked farther from local audiences than any artist in Lubumbashi, and not only in Lubumbashi but in the surrounding province of Katanga.\u201d <ref>Brassinne, J. and Kestergat, J. (1991). ''Qui a tu\u00e9 Patrice Lumumba?'' Paris : Duculot. P 141. {{ISBN|2-8011-0979-7}}.</ref></blockquote>He names painters like Pilipili, Mwenze, Angali, Nkulu wa Nkulu, Maka, Tshimbumba, Dekab, and others.\n\n===Cinema===\nCin\u00e9 B\u00e9tamax, formerly \u201cCin\u00e9 Palace\u201d and \u201cCin\u00e9 Eden\u201d,<ref>Jewsiewicki, B. (1999). ''A Congo Chronicle: Patrice Lumumba in Urban Art''. New York: The Museum for African Art. P 13. {{ISBN|0-945802-25-0}}</ref> are the only modern movie theaters in the city. They generally show popular recent [[Hollywood]] productions as well as NC-17 films. However, they also show movies about Congolese and African recent history like ''[[Mister Bob]],'' ''[[Sniper: Reloaded]],'' ''[[SEAL Team 8: Behind Enemy Lines]],'' and ''[[Tears of the Sun]].'' Before films, they both showed Congolese and international music videos, and US wrestling. Cin\u00e9 B\u00e9tamax primarily addresses the young adults of Lubumbashi. Children are exposed to huge NC-17 posters, but seldom get in. The communication department of the University of Lubumbashi has collaborated with the movie theater to show students\u2019 films.\n\nCin\u00e9 B\u00e9tamax in particular also screens great football matches, and local singers\u2019 concerts and Christian meetings are regularly held here. All over the city, especially in crowded neighborhoods, are spread small rooms in which children are exposed to violent movies from morning to night.\n\nNigeria's [[Nollywood]] films are also, as in many other parts of the DRC and Africa, popular among the residents. These films are often sold on VCD and DVD platforms.\n\n===Music===\nThe popular music from Kinshasa is much appreciated and played in Lubumbashi. [[Jean-Bosco Mwenda]] is likely the most famous Katangese musician. Many of his songs have become classical, and are endlessly remixed by new young artists. Modern Lubumbashi singers fall into two groups: those who play Soukous, such as Jo Kizi and K\u00e9pi Prince, and those who play international urban music, such as Ced Koncept, Tshumani, M-Joe, RJ Kanyera, Oxyg\u00e8ne, Agresivo, Nelson Tshi, and Da Costa on the other. Most artists are influenced by successful [[Dj Spilulu]]'s productions,  Kinshasa singers Fally Ipupa, Ferre Gola and [[World music|World Music]].\n\nLubumbashi music is characterized by the use of many languages (Swahili, Lingala, Tshiluba, French and some English) in the lyrics. It is rare to hear songs composed in only one language. This code switching and mixing expresses the cosmopolitan character of the city, but some critics think it weakens the lyrics, which seem to be particularly made for teenagers anyway. Serge Manseba and Karibyona are humorist-singers featured by [[Dj Spilulu]] G'Sparks.\n\n===French cultural influence===\nThe \u201cInstitut Fran\u00e7ais\u201d (formally known as \u201cCentre Culturel Fran\u00e7ais\u201d), located in the heart of the city, contributes a great deal to the cultural and artistic life of Lubumbashi. Students and researchers spend time in its library; it shows European and other French-language films; produces plays and other shows in its theater; and features local singers\u2019 records for sale on display at the entrance.\n\n===Okapi Radio\u2019s cultural participation===\nOkapi Radio's Lubumbashi presenters participate each Saturday evening in ''\u201cm\u00e9tissage,\u201d'' the cultural program of the radio. The whole country is informed of the cultural activities in the city.\n\n== Media ==\n\n===National channel (RTNC/Katanga)===\nRTNC (Congolese National Radio and Television) has a provincial station located in Lubumbashi district at the junction of Lubilanshi and Sandoa. It has been very influential from the 1960s to the mid-1990s, at the end of the one-party system, and before the information technology revolution.\n\n===Independent channels===\nZenith Radio, the first independent radio station in the city, started broadcasting in 1996; since then numerous radio and television stations have been established. They can be classified in three groups: religious channels (Zenith, RTIV, Cannal de Vie, RNS, etc.), commercial channels (RTA, Mwangaza, [[Nyota Radio Television|Nyota]], RTLJ, Mala\u00efka, Kyondo, etc.), and mixed ones like Wantanshi Radio and Television.\n\n== Sports ==\n\n===Football===\nFootball in Lubumbashi is the most popular sport. Lubumbashi is home to [[association football|football]] clubs of the top national level such as [[FC Saint Eloi Lupopo]], [[CS Don Bosco]] and [[TP Mazembe]] which is the most successful club in national competitions and the most successful Congolese club in international football achieving 5 [[CAF Champions League|Africa's Champions League]] and reaching a final of a [[FIFA Club World Cup]]. The Chairman of Mazembe is the former governor of the province of Katanga [[Mo\u00efse Katumbi Chapwe]].\n\nUntil 1960 Congolese football was divided between whites-only and blacks-only leagues and competitions. In 1911 was founded in Elisabethville the whites-only Ligue de Football du Katanga organising in 1925 the first official edition of the local championship called the B. Smith Cup.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesk/katanga.html|title=DR Congo (Zaire) - Katanga Champions|website=www.rsssf.com|access-date=2018-05-24}}</ref> Simultaneously were played blacks-only regionals tournaments in the country divided by 3 regionals tournaments with the [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] tournament being won by Lubumbashi's teams in all the registered editions but 2005.\n\nIn 1950, the 'black' Elisabethville Football Association (FASI, F\u00e9d\u00e9rations et Associations Sportives Indig\u00e8nes) had over 30 affiliated clubs competing in four leagues divided over 3 divisions.

This site was chosen by Vice-Governor-General Emile Wangerm\u00e9e because of its proximity to the copper mine of ''[[Etoile du Congo Mine|Etoile du Congo]]'' and the copper ore smelting oven installed by [[Union Mini\u00e8re du Haut Katanga]] on the nearby Lubumbashi river.\nThe Comit\u00e9 Sp\u00e9cial du Katanga (CSK), a semi-private concessionary company set up in 1906, had its headquarters in Elisabethville throughout the colonial era. It enjoyed major privileges, mainly in terms of land and mining concessions, in the Katanga province.\n\nThe city prospered with the development of a regional copper mining industry.<ref>Brion, R. and J.-L. Moreau (2006), ''De la mine \u00e0 Mars, La gen\u00e8se d'Umicore'', Tielt : Lannoo.</ref> Huge investments in the 1920s, both in the mining industry and in transport infrastructure (railline Elisabethville-Port Francqui and Elisabethville-Dilolo), developed the Katanga province into one of the world's major copper ore producers. The population of the city grew apace from approx. 30,000 in 1930, to 50,000 in 1943 and 180,000 in 1957. It was the second city of the [[Belgian Congo]], after L\u00e9opoldville.\n\n[[File:Belgian Neighborhood, Lubumbashi, DRC.jpg|thumb|The Belgian Quarter in Lubumbashi]]\n\nAs was customary in sub-Saharan colonies, the city centre of Elisabethville was reserved for the white (European) population. This consisted mainly of Belgian nationals, but the city also attracted important British and Italian communities, as well as [[History of the Jews in Greece|Jewish Greeks]]. Congolese were allowed in the white city only during the day, except for the house servants (\"boys\") who often lived in shanty dwellings (\"boyeries\") located in the backyards of the European city houses.\nMany men in the black population were labour immigrants from neighbouring regions in the Belgian Congo (Northern Katanga, Maniema, Kasa\u00ef), from Belgian Rwanda and Burundi, and from British Northern Rhodesia (Zambia).<ref>Fetter, Bruce (1976), ''The Creation of Elisabethville, 1910\u20131940'', Stanford: Hoover Institution Press.</ref> The black population lived initially in a so-called ''cit\u00e9 indig\u00e8ne'' called quartier Albert (now: Kamalondo), south of the city centre and separated from the white city by a 700-metres-wide neutral zone. With population growth, new indigenous quarters were created. These still form the main suburbs of present-day Lubumbashi: Kenia, Katuba, Ruashi. The work and businesses related to the mines made Elisabethville the most prosperous region of the Congo during the final decade of Belgian rule. In 1954 there were 8,000 black home owners in the city while thousands more were skilled workers. It was estimated that black Africans living in Elisabethville had a higher standard of living than anywhere else on the continent at that time.<ref>John Gunther,''Inside Africa,'' Hamish Hamilton Ltd.

In early 1944, the city was again in the grip of severe tensions and fear of violent protests, following a mutiny of the [[Force Publique]] (army) in Luluabourg.<ref>Rubens, Antoine (1945), ''Dettes de guerre'', Lubumbashi: L'essor du Congo.</ref>\n\nStarting in 1933, the Belgian colonial authorities experimented with a limited form of self-governance by establishing the cit\u00e9 indig\u00e8ne of Elisabethville as a so-called \"centre extra-coutumier\" (a centre not subject to customary law). It was administered by an indigenous council and presided over by an indigenous chief. But, due to constant interference from the Belgian authorities, the experiment soon proved a failure.<ref>Gr\u00e9visse, F. (1951), ''Le Centre Extra-Coutumier d\u2019Elisabethville'', Elisabethville-Bruxelles: CEPSI-Institut Royal Colonial Belge.</ref> The first indigenous chief \u2013 Albert Kabongo \u2013 appointed in 1937, was dismissed in 1943 and not replaced.\n\nIn 1957 Elisabethville was established as a fully autonomous city; it held the first free municipal elections in which the Congolese could vote. The people of \u00c9lisabethville gave a vast majority to the nationalist [[Alliance des Bakongo]], which demanded immediate independence from Belgium.\n\nElisabethville functioned as the administrative capital of the Katanga province. It was also an important commercial and industrial centre, and a centre of education and health services. The [[Benedictine Order]] and missionary [[Order of Salesians]] offered a wide range of educational facilities to Europeans and Congolese alike, including vocational training (Kafubu). The Belgians established the University of \u00c9lisabethville in 1954\u20131955 (now the [[University of Lubumbashi]]).\n\n[[File:Lubumbashi cathedral S Pierre et Paul.jpg|thumb|Lubumbashi: [[Sts. Peter and Paul Cathedral, Lubumbashi|Sts. Peter and Paul Cathedral]]]]\n[[File:Square in Lubumbashi, 2011.jpg|thumb|Lubumbashi in 2011]]\n\n=== Lubumbashi from 1960 ===\n\u00c9lisabethville served as the capital and centre of the secessionist independent state of [[State of Katanga#Secession|Katanga]] during the 1960\u20131963 Congolese civil war. [[Moise Tshombe]] proclaimed Katangan independence in July 1960.  Congolese leaders arrested him and charged him with treason in April 1961; however, he agreed to dismiss his foreign advisers and military forces in exchange for his release.  Tshombe returned to \u00c9lisabethville but repudiated these assurances and began to fight anew.  United Nations troops opposed Katangan forces and took control of the city in December 1961 under a strong mandate. [[Roger Trinquier]], well known for his published works on counter-insurgency warfare, served as a French military advisor to President Tshombe until international pressure, led by Belgium, caused his recall to France.\n\n[[Mobutu Sese Seko]] ultimately assumed power of the Congo, which he renamed Za\u00efre. He renamed \u00c9lisabethville as \"Lubumbashi\" in 1966 and in 1972 renamed Katanga as \"Shaba.\"\n\nIn May 1990, the university campus of Lubumbashi was the scene of a brutal killing of students by Mobutu's security forces. In 1991\u201392 ethnic tensions between the Luba from Katanga and the Luba from Kasa\u00ef, resident in the city, led to violent confrontations and the forced removal from the city of the latter.\n\nCongo entered another genocidal civil war in the late 1990s.  The [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo]] rebels captured Lubumbashi in April 1997. Rebel leader [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]] spoke from Lubumbashi to declare himself president of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] on 17 May 1997 after Mobutu Sese Seko fled Kinshasa.\n\nWhen Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila decided to appoint a transitional parliament, in 1999, he decided to install the Parliament in Lubumbashi, in order to consolidate the fragile unity of the country. The parliament was installed in the building of the National Assembly of secessionist Katanga (the former city theatre), which had its capital in this city as well, in the 1960s. Lubumbashi was therefore the Legislative capital of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] from 1999 to 2003, when all the country's central institutions were brought back to Kinshasa.\n\nOn 7 September 2010 a large prison break happened in Lubumbashi after gunmen attacked a prison on the outskirts of the city. 960 prisoners managed to escape, including the [[Mai-Mai]] leader [[G\u00e9d\u00e9on Kyungu Mutanga]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=39478&Cr=democratic&Cr1=congo |date=7 September 2011 |accessdate=8 September 2011 |title=UN voices concern after mass prison outbreak in DR Congo |publisher=UN News Center}}</ref> On 23 March 2013 a militia group of 100 fighters attacked Lubumbashi and seized a United Nations compound, which was surrounded by Congolese soldiers and members of the president's Republican Guard.<ref name=BloombergKavanagh />\n\n== Geography ==\n:''See also: {{illm|List of communes of Lubumbashi|fr|Liste des communes de Lubumbashi}}''\nLubumbashi lies at around {{Convert|1208|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. The high altitude serves to cool the climate, which would otherwise be very hot. The [[Kafue River]] rises along the Zambian border near the city and meanders through north-central [[Zambia]] to the [[Zambezi River]], cutting a long, deep panhandle into the country.\n\n===Climate===\nLubumbashi has a dry-winter [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cwa'', according to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]), with warm rainy summers and pleasant, dry winters, with most rainfall occurring during summer and early autumn. Annual average rainfall is 1,238&nbsp;mm (48.75 inches).\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Lubumbashi\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 26\n|Feb high C = 26\n|Mar high C = 26\n|Apr high C = 27\n|May high C = 26\n|Jun high C = 25\n|Jul high C = 25\n|Aug high C = 27\n|Sep high C = 30\n|Oct high C = 31\n|Nov high C = 28\n|Dec high C = 26\n|year high C = \n|Jan mean C = 21\n|Feb mean C = 21\n|Mar mean C = 21\n|Apr mean C = 20.5\n|May mean C = 18\n|Jun mean C = 16.5\n|Jul mean C = 16.5\n|Aug mean C = 18\n|Sep mean C = 21\n|Oct mean C = 23\n|Nov mean C = 22\n|Dec mean C = 21\n|year mean C = \n|Jan low C = 16\n|Feb low C = 16\n|Mar low C = 16\n|Apr low C = 14\n|May low C = 10\n|Jun low C = 8\n|Jul low C = 8\n|Aug low C = 9\n|Sep low C = 12\n|Oct low C = 15\n|Nov low C = 16\n|Dec low C = 16\n|year low C =\n|Jan rain mm = 253\n|Feb rain mm = 257\n|Mar rain mm = 202\n|Apr rain mm = 60\n|May rain mm = 4\n|Jun rain mm = 1\n|Jul rain mm = 0\n|Aug rain mm = 0\n|Sep rain mm = 4\n|Oct rain mm = 37\n|Nov rain mm = 163\n|Dec rain mm = 257\n|year rain mm = \n|Jan rain days = 24\n|Feb rain days = 23\n|Mar rain days = 21\n|Apr rain days = 9\n|May rain days = 2\n|Jun rain days = 0\n|Jul rain days = 0\n|Aug rain days = 0\n|Sep rain days = 1\n|Oct rain days = 5\n|Nov rain days = 17\n|Dec rain days = 24\n|year rain days = \n|source = https://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/congo-kinshasa/lubumbashi.php\n}}\n\n{|style=\"width:100%;text-align:center;line-height:1.2em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|-\n!Colspan=14|Maximum UV index for Lubumbashi\n|-\n!Month\n!Jan\n!Feb\n!Mar\n!Apr\n!May\n!Jun\n!Jul\n!Aug\n!Sep\n!Oct\n!Nov\n!Dec\n!Year\n|-\n!Average [[Ultraviolet index]]\n|style=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"|11+\n|style=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"|11+\n|style=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"|11+\n|style=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"|11+\n|style=\"background:#d8001d;color:#FFFFFF;\"|10\n|style=\"background:#d8001d;color:#FFFFFF;\"|9\n|style=\"background:#d8001d;color:#FFFFFF;\"|9\n|style=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"|11\n|style=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"|11+\n|style=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"|11+\n|style=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"|11+\n|style=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"|11+\n|style=\"background:#d8001d;color:#FFFFFF;border-left-width:medium\"|10.8\n|-\n!Colspan=14 style=\"background:#f8f9fa;font-weight:normal;font-size:95%;\"|Source: weather2travel.com <ref name=\"weather2travel.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/congo-kinshasa/lubumbashi.php |title=Lubumbashi, Democratic Republic of the Congo \u2013 Monthly weather forecast and Climate data |publisher=weather2travel.com |access-date=29 June 2019 }}</ref>\n|}\n\n== Demography ==\n=== Language(s) ===\n[[French language|French]] is the official language, but the main spoken [[lingua franca]] in Lubumbashi is [[Kiswahili]].

Manufactures include [[textiles]], food products and beverages, [[printing]], bricks, and copper smelting. The city is home to the Simba brewery, producing the famous Tembo beer.\n\nThe city hosts the headquarters of one of the country's largest banks, [[Trust Merchant Bank]].  The airline [[Korongo Airlines]], a joint-venture between [[Brussels Airlines]] and the Belgian multinational Groupe George Forrest International, also maintains its head office in Lubumbashi. The area also has a daily newspaper.\n\n[[File:Lubumbashi Storefront.jpg|thumb|Storefronts in Lubumbashi]]\n\n===Mining===\nLubumbashi, the mining capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is a base for many of the country's biggest mining companies. The Democratic Republic of Congo produces \"more than 3 percent of the world's copper and half its [[cobalt]], most of which comes from Katanga.\"<ref name=BloombergKavanagh />\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Lubumbashi International Airport.png|thumb|[[Lubumbashi International Airport]]]]\n===Road===\nThe city is crossed by [[Beira\u2013Lobito Highway|Transafican Highway 9]] (TAH 9), which connects it to the cities of [[Lusaka]] and [[Kolwezi]].\n\n===Rail===\nLubumbashi is the center of the railway lines from [[Cape to Cairo Railway]], which serves as a link with the cities of [[Ndola]], [[Ilebo]], [[Kindu]] and [[Sakania]]. \nIn [[Tenke, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Tenke]], the city connects with [[Kolwezi]], through the [[Benguela railway]].\n\n===Air===\nLubumbashi is home to the modern [[Lubumbashi International Airport]]. The city serves as a distribution centre for such minerals as copper, [[cobalt]], [[zinc]], [[tin]], and coal.\n\n== Education ==\n[[File:University of Lubumbashi.jpg|thumb|University of Lubumbashi]]\nThe largest institution of higher education is the [[University of Lubumbashi]], founded in 1955, with also the teaching institutions Protestant University of Lubumbashi and the Graduate Institute of Health Sciences.\n\n== Urban infrastructure ==\n===Parks===\nMuyambo Kyasa popularized the concept of parks. Muyambo Park opened in 2010. Located about 15&nbsp;km from Lubumbashi, it is a large garden where children can play games, and adults relax. Other parks (or farms) include Mikembo and Futuka (once a reserve, now closed) on Kasenga Road in the city\u2019s outskirts.\n\n===Zoo===\nThe zoo of Lubumbashi is one of the most visited tourist attractions. It was created during the colonial period, and is considered the nicest zoo in the country. During the years of war, it deteriorated but it has been rehabilitated by AZLU, a non-profit organization. By 2007, great animals had been acquired for the zoo.  AZLU is keeping the zoo \u201cfor education purposes, and the protection of the natural heritage of the country,\u201d as it can be read on signs. Today, it has almost been restocked with lions, tigers, monkeys, apes, pelicans, wart hogs, crocodiles, snakes, turtles, monitor lizards, eagles, parrots, ostriches, gazelles, etc. Apart from animals, the zoo features a restaurant, a veterinary center, and a termite museum.\n\n== Culture ==\nAttractions in the city include a [[botanical garden]], a [[zoo]], and the regional archaeological and ethnological [[National Museum of Lubumbashi]]. Every two years, the Biennale of Lubumbashi is held across the city, showcasing works by artists from the region. In an interview in Ocula Magazine in 2019, the Biennale's artistic director, Sandrine Colard explained, 'The Congo is a country that is perpetually in the future. All of these different periods coalescing in one city is something I wanted to address.'<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ocula.com/magazine/conversations/sandrine-colard/ |title=Sandrine Colard on the 6th Lubumbashi Biennale |last=Balogun |first=Emmanuel |date=13 Dec 2019 |website=Ocula Magazine |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191216210942/https://ocula.com/magazine/conversations/sandrine-colard/ |archive-date=16 Dec 2019 |access-date=1 Feb 2020}}</ref> \n\n===Art===\nBogumi\u0142 Jewsiewicki says that contemporary Lubumbashi art making is weak, especially when compared to the Kinshasan. He writes,\n<blockquote>\u201cNo Lubumbashi popular painter has had an international career like that of the Kinshasa artist Ch\u00e9ri Samba, and there are in fact a number of artists and musicians in Kinshasa whom the whirlwind of international success has whisked farther from local audiences than any artist in Lubumbashi, and not only in Lubumbashi but in the surrounding province of Katanga.\u201d <ref>Brassinne, J. and Kestergat, J. (1991). ''Qui a tu\u00e9 Patrice Lumumba?'' Paris : Duculot. P 141. {{ISBN|2-8011-0979-7}}.</ref></blockquote>He names painters like Pilipili, Mwenze, Angali, Nkulu wa Nkulu, Maka, Tshimbumba, Dekab, and others.\n\n===Cinema===\nCin\u00e9 B\u00e9tamax, formerly \u201cCin\u00e9 Palace\u201d and \u201cCin\u00e9 Eden\u201d,<ref>Jewsiewicki, B. (1999). ''A Congo Chronicle: Patrice Lumumba in Urban Art''. New York: The Museum for African Art. P 13. {{ISBN|0-945802-25-0}}</ref> are the only modern movie theaters in the city. They generally show popular recent [[Hollywood]] productions as well as NC-17 films. However, they also show movies about Congolese and African recent history like ''[[Mister Bob]],'' ''[[Sniper: Reloaded]],'' ''[[SEAL Team 8: Behind Enemy Lines]],'' and ''[[Tears of the Sun]].'' Before films, they both showed Congolese and international music videos, and US wrestling. Cin\u00e9 B\u00e9tamax primarily addresses the young adults of Lubumbashi. Children are exposed to huge NC-17 posters, but seldom get in. The communication department of the University of Lubumbashi has collaborated with the movie theater to show students\u2019 films.\n\nCin\u00e9 B\u00e9tamax in particular also screens great football matches, and local singers\u2019 concerts and Christian meetings are regularly held here. All over the city, especially in crowded neighborhoods, are spread small rooms in which children are exposed to violent movies from morning to night.\n\nNigeria's [[Nollywood]] films are also, as in many other parts of the DRC and Africa, popular among the residents. These films are often sold on VCD and DVD platforms.\n\n===Music===\nThe popular music from Kinshasa is much appreciated and played in Lubumbashi. [[Jean-Bosco Mwenda]] is likely the most famous Katangese musician. Many of his songs have become classical, and are endlessly remixed by new young artists. Modern Lubumbashi singers fall into two groups: those who play Soukous, such as Jo Kizi and K\u00e9pi Prince, and those who play international urban music, such as Ced Koncept, Tshumani, M-Joe, RJ Kanyera, Oxyg\u00e8ne, Agresivo, Nelson Tshi, and Da Costa on the other. Most artists are influenced by successful [[Dj Spilulu]]'s productions,  Kinshasa singers Fally Ipupa, Ferre Gola and [[World music|World Music]].\n\nLubumbashi music is characterized by the use of many languages (Swahili, Lingala, Tshiluba, French and some English) in the lyrics. It is rare to hear songs composed in only one language. This code switching and mixing expresses the cosmopolitan character of the city, but some critics think it weakens the lyrics, which seem to be particularly made for teenagers anyway. Serge Manseba and Karibyona are humorist-singers featured by [[Dj Spilulu]] G'Sparks.\n\n===French cultural influence===\nThe \u201cInstitut Fran\u00e7ais\u201d (formally known as \u201cCentre Culturel Fran\u00e7ais\u201d), located in the heart of the city, contributes a great deal to the cultural and artistic life of Lubumbashi. Students and researchers spend time in its library; it shows European and other French-language films; produces plays and other shows in its theater; and features local singers\u2019 records for sale on display at the entrance.\n\n===Okapi Radio\u2019s cultural participation===\nOkapi Radio\u2019s Lubumbashi presenters participate each Saturday evening in ''\u201cm\u00e9tissage,\u201d'' the cultural program of the radio. The whole country is informed of the cultural activities in the city.\n\n== Media ==\n\n===National channel (RTNC/Katanga)===\nRTNC (Congolese National Radio and Television) has a provincial station located in Lubumbashi district at the junction of Lubilanshi and Sandoa. It has been very influential from the 1960s to the mid-1990s, at the end of the one-party system, and before the information technology revolution.\n\n===Independent channels===\nZenith Radio, the first independent radio station in the city, started broadcasting in 1996; since then numerous radio and television stations have been established. They can be classified in three groups: religious channels (Zenith, RTIV, Cannal de Vie, RNS, etc.), commercial channels (RTA, Mwangaza, [[Nyota Radio Television|Nyota]], RTLJ, Mala\u00efka, Kyondo, etc.), and mixed ones like Wantanshi Radio and Television.\n\n== Sports ==\n\n===Football===\nFootball in Lubumbashi is the most popular sport. Lubumbashi is home to [[association football|football]] clubs of the top national level such as [[FC Saint Eloi Lupopo]], [[CS Don Bosco]] and [[TP Mazembe]] which is the most successful club in national competitions and the most successful Congolese club in international football achieving 5 [[CAF Champions League|Africa's Champions League]] and reaching a final of a [[FIFA Club World Cup]]. The Chairman of Mazembe is the former governor of the province of Katanga [[Mo\u00efse Katumbi Chapwe]].\n\nUntil 1960 Congolese football was divided between whites-only and blacks-only leagues and competitions. In 1911 was founded in Elisabethville the whites-only Ligue de Football du Katanga organising in 1925 the first official edition of the local championship called the B. Smith Cup.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesk/katanga.html|title=DR Congo (Zaire) - Katanga Champions|website=www.rsssf.com|access-date=2018-05-24}}</ref> Simultaneously were played blacks-only regionals tournaments in the country divided by 3 regionals tournaments with the [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] tournament being won by Lubumbashi's teams in all the registered editions but 2005.\n\nIn 1950, the 'black' Elisabethville Football Association (FASI, F\u00e9d\u00e9rations et Associations Sportives Indig\u00e8nes) had over 30 affiliated clubs competing in four leagues divided over 3 divisions.

It was named after [[Thomas Saltus Lubbock]], former Texas Ranger and brother of [[Francis Lubbock]], governor of Texas during the Civil War.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hdl04|title=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association}}</ref> As early as 1884, a [[United States Post Office Department|U.S. post office]] existed in [[Yellow House Canyon]]. A small town, known as Old Lubbock, Lubbock, or North Town, was established about three miles to the east. In 1890, the original Lubbock merged with Monterey, another small town south of the canyon. The new town adopted the Lubbock name. The merger included moving the original Lubbock's [[Nicolett Hotel (Lubbock, Texas)|Nicolett Hotel]] across the canyon on rollers to the new townsite. Lubbock became the county seat in 1891,<ref>[[Paul H. Carlson]], \"The Nicolett Hotel and the Founding of Lubbock\", ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]]'', Vol. 90 (2014), pp. 8-9, 11.</ref> and was incorporated on March 16, 1909. In the same year, the first railroad train arrived.\n\nTexas Technological College (now Texas Tech University) was founded in Lubbock in 1923. A separate university, [[Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center]], opened as Texas Tech University School of Medicine in 1969. Both universities are now overseen by the [[Texas Tech University System]], after it was established in 1996 and based in Lubbock. [[Lubbock Christian University]], founded in 1957, and [[Sunset International Bible Institute]], both affiliated with the [[Churches of Christ]], have their main campuses in the city. [[South Plains College]] and [[Wayland Baptist University]] operate branch campuses in Lubbock.\n\nAt one time, Lubbock was home to [[Reese Air Force Base]], located {{convert|6|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} west of the city. It was established in August 1941, during the defense build-up prior to [[World War II]] (1941-1945), by the [[United States Department of War]] and the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] as Lubbock Army Airfield. It served the old [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]], and later the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] (USAF), after reorganization and establishment in 1947. The USAF base's primary mission throughout its existence was pilot training. The base was closed 30 September 1997, after being selected for closure by the [[Base Realignment and Closure]] Commission in 1995, and is now a research and business park called [[Reese Technology Center]].\n\nThe city is home to the [[Lubbock Lake Landmark]], part of the [[Museum of Texas Tech University]]. The landmark is an archaeological and natural-history preserve at the northern edge of the city. It shows evidence of almost 12,000 years of human occupation in the region. The [[National Ranching Heritage Center]], also part of the Museum of Texas Tech University, houses historic ranch-related structures from the region.\n\nDuring World War II, airmen cadets from the Royal Air Force, flying from their training base at Terrell, Texas, routinely flew to Lubbock on training flights. The town served as a stand-in for the British for Cork, Ireland, which was the same distance from London, England, as Lubbock is from Terrell.\n\nIn August 1951, a V-shaped formation of lights was seen over the city. The \"[[Lubbock Lights]]\" series of sightings received national publicity and is regarded as one of the first great \"[[UFO]]\" cases. The sightings were considered credible because they were witnessed by several respected science professors at Texas Technological College and were photographed by a Texas Tech student. The photographs were reprinted nationwide in newspapers and in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''. [[Project Blue Book]], the USAF's official investigation of the UFO mystery, concluded the photographs were not a hoax and showed genuine objects, but dismissed the UFOs as being either \"night-flying moths\" or a type of bird called a [[plover]] reflected in the nighttime glow of Lubbock's new street lights.\n\nIn 1960, the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] reported Lubbock's population as 128,691 and area as {{convert|75.0|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"census\"/>\n\nOn May 11, 1970, the [[Lubbock Tornado]] struck the city. Twenty-six people died, and damage was estimated at $125 million. The [[Metro Tower (Lubbock)|Metro Tower]] (NTS Building), then known as the Great Plains Life Building, at {{convert|274|ft|m|abbr=on}} in height, is believed to have been the tallest building ever to survive a direct hit from an [[Fujita scale|F5]] tornado.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lub/climate/Local_interest_events/LUB_tornado/lubtor.html |title=Lubbock, Texas|publisher=[[National Weather Service]] Forecast Office |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061009180854/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lub/climate/Local_interest_events/LUB_tornado/lubtor.html |archivedate = October 9, 2006}}</ref> Then-mayor [[Jim Granberry]] and the Lubbock City Council, which included Granberry's successor as mayor, [[Morris W.

The historians [[Paul H. Carlson]], Donald R. Abbe, and David J. Murrah co-authored ''Lubbock and the South Plains.''\n\nOn August 12, 2008, the Lubbock Chamber of Commerce announced they would lead the effort to get enough signatures to have a vote on allowing county-wide packaged alcohol sales.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chamber to Lead Alcohol Petition Effort |url=http://www.myfoxlubbock.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail?contentId=7191012&version=2&locale=EN-US&layoutCode=TSTY&pageId=1.1.1&sflg=1 |publisher=My Fox Lubbock |accessdate=2009-05-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714142817/http://www.myfoxlubbock.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail?contentId=7191012&version=2&locale=EN-US&layoutCode=TSTY&pageId=1.1.1&sflg=1 |archivedate=July 14, 2011 }}</ref> The petition effort was successful and the question was put to the voters.

[[Interstate 27 (Texas)|Interstate 27]] (the former Avenue H) links the city to [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]] and [[Interstate 40 (Texas)|Interstate 40]], a transcontinental route. I-27 was completed through the city in 1992 (it originally terminated just north of downtown). Other major highways include [[U.S. Highway 62 (Texas)|US 62]] and [[U.S. Highway 82 in Texas|US 82]], which run concurrently (except for 4th Street (82) and 19th Street (62)) through the city east\u2013west as the Marsha Sharp Freeway, 19th Street (62 only), 4th Street/Parkway Drive (82 only) and [[Idalou, Texas|Idalou]] Highway. [[U.S. Highway 84 (Texas)|US 84]] (Avenue Q/[[Slaton, Texas|Slaton]] Highway/[[Clovis, New Mexico|Clovis]] Road) is also another east\u2013west route running NW/SE diagonally. [[U.S. Highway 87 (Texas)|US Highway 87]] runs between [[San Angelo, Texas|San Angelo]] and Amarillo and follows I-27 concurrently. [[Texas State Highway 114|State Highway 114]] runs east\u2013west, following US 62/82 on the east before going its own way. Lubbock is circled by [[State Highway Loop 289 (Texas)|Loop 289]], which suffers from traffic congestion despite being a potential bypass around the city, which is the reason behind I-27 and Brownfield Highway being built through the city to have freeway traffic flow effectively inside the loop.\n\nThe city is set up on a simple [[grid plan]]. In the heart of the city, numbered streets run east\u2013west and lettered avenues run north\u2013south \u2013 the grid begins at Avenue A in the east and First Street in the north. North of First Street, city planners chose to name streets alphabetically from the south to the north after colleges and universities. The north\u2013south avenues run from A to Y. What would be Avenue Z is actually University Avenue, since it runs along the east side of Texas Tech. Beyond that, the A-to-Z convention resumes, using US cities found east of the Mississippi (e.g. Akron Avenue, Boston Avenue, Canton Avenue). Again, the Z name is not used, with Slide Road appearing in its place.\n\n====Rail service====\nLubbock currently does not provide [[intercity rail]] service, although various proposals have been presented over the years to remedy this. One, the ''[[Caprock Chief]]'', would have seen daily service as part of a [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], Texas\u2014[[Denver]], Colorado service, but it failed to gain interest.<ref>{{cite news | title=Lubbock officials backing plans for Amtrak rail service | url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/080201/tex_amtrakrail.shtml | date=August 2, 2001 | work=[[Amarillo Globe-News]] | accessdate=2008-05-14 | first=Chris | last=Van Wagenen | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604000244/http://amarillo.com/stories/080201/tex_amtrakrail.shtml | archive-date=June 4, 2011 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Lubbock is served by the BNSF Railway company, Plainsman Switching Company (PSC), and West Texas & Lubbock Railway (WTLC). PSC interchanges with BNSF (also with UP through a UP-BNSF Haulage agreement) in Lubbock and has 19 miles of track with in city limits of Lubbock with 36 customers. Options exist for transloading a variety of materials on the line, from wind-turbine parts to steel shafts. PSC handles many commodities such as cottonseed, cottonseed oil, cottonseed meal, cottonseed hulls, milo, corn, wheat, pinto beans, sand, rock, lumber, nonperishable food items, chemicals, paper products, brick, and bagging material, and can also store cars. WTLC interchanges with BNSF (also with UP through a UP-BNSF Haulage agreement) in Lubbock. WTLC has a yard on the west side of Lubbock, where they switch cars to go down their line to Levelland or to Brownfield. WTLC handles commodities of grains, chemicals, sands, peanuts, lumber, etc.\n\n====Airports====\n{{See also|Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport}}\n[[File:Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport IMG 0260.JPG|thumb|right|[[Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport]]]]\nThe city's air services are provided by [[Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport]], which is named for the Lubbock businessman who became [[lieutenant governor]] and governor of Texas. It is on the city's northeast side. The airport is the eighth-busiest airport in Texas. Lubbock Preston Smith Airport also plays host as a major hub to FedEx's feeder planes that serve cities around Lubbock.\n\n====Intercity bus service====\n[[Greyhound Lines]] operates the Lubbock Station at 801 Broadway, just east of the Lubbock County Courthouse.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greyhound.com/home/TicketCenter/en/terminal.asp?city=681791 |title=Greyhound |publisher=Greyhound |date= |accessdate=2015-07-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122230451/https://www.greyhound.com/home/TicketCenter/en/terminal.asp?city=681791 |archivedate=November 22, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n====Public transportation====\n{{See also|Citibus (Lubbock)}}\nPublic transportation is provided by [[Citibus (Lubbock)|Citibus]], a bus transit system running Monday through Saturday every week with a transit center hub in downtown. It runs bus routes throughout the city, with the main routes converging at the Downtown Transfer Plaza, which also houses the Greyhound bus terminal. Citibus has been in continual service since 1971, when the city of Lubbock took over public transit operations. The paratransit system is called Citiaccess.\n\nCitibus' six [[diesel-electric hybrid bus]]es have begun service on city routes. Managers hope the buses will use 60% of the fuel their older, larger versions consume in moving customers across the city. The buses seat 23 passengers, can support full-sized [[wheelchair]]s, and will run on all but two city-based routes.\n\n====Modal characteristics====\nAccording to the 2016 American Community Survey, 80.9% of working Lubbock (city) residents commuted by driving alone, 12.9% carpooled, 1% used public transportation, and 1.5% walked. About 1.5% used all other forms of transportation, including taxi, bicycle, and motorcycle. About 2.3% worked at home.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Census Reporter|title=Means of Transportation to Work by Age|accessdate=May 7, 2018|url=https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B08101&geo_ids=16000US4845000&primary_geo_id=16000US4845000}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, 7.3% of Lubbock households were without a car, which decreased to 5.6% in 2016.

Previously, Milwaukee was a 4-mile dirt road on farm land with hardly any traffic a mile or more from major development. With growth headed westward, the city allocated nearly $20 million to convert the road into a seven-lane concrete thoroughfare. In 2004, the city funded the project and other developments to come by establishing a new fund that tapped part of the franchise fees received. As of 2018, more than $124 million in street construction has been possible from the fund, including Slide Road, 98th Street, Indiana Avenue, and the last phases of the [[U.S. Route 82 in Texas|Marsha Sharp Freeway]]. Public Works Director Wood Franklin said Milwaukee Avenue was conceived on the \"build it and they will come\" theory. Marc McDougal, then the mayor of Lubbock, described the project as a well calculated risk that subsequently greatly benefited the city.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lubbockonline.com/news/20180728/leaders-say-lubbocks-milwaukee-avenue-took-creative-funding-project-of-similar-scope-not-foreseen|title=Leaders say Lubbock's Milwaukee Avenue took creative funding, project of similar scope not foreseen|author=Matt Dotray|date=July 28, 2018|newspaper=Lubbock Avalanche-Journal|accessdate=August 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==<!--consensus reached to standardize this heading per WP:WikiProject Cities/US Guideline --><!-- NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * * * * * * * * * *NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * NOTICE\u2022 Only people who already have a Wikipedia article may appear here.

It was named after [[Thomas Saltus Lubbock]], former Texas Ranger and brother of [[Francis Lubbock]], governor of Texas during the Civil War.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hdl04|title=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association}}</ref> As early as 1884, a [[United States Post Office Department|U.S. post office]] existed in [[Yellow House Canyon]]. A small town, known as Old Lubbock, Lubbock, or North Town, was established about three miles to the east. In 1890, the original Lubbock merged with Monterey, another small town south of the canyon. The new town adopted the Lubbock name. The merger included moving the original Lubbock's [[Nicolett Hotel (Lubbock, Texas)|Nicolett Hotel]] across the canyon on rollers to the new townsite. Lubbock became the county seat in 1891,<ref>[[Paul H. Carlson]], \"The Nicolett Hotel and the Founding of Lubbock\", ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]]'', Vol. 90 (2014), pp. 8-9, 11.</ref> and was incorporated on March 16, 1909. In the same year, the first railroad train arrived.\n\nTexas Technological College (now Texas Tech University) was founded in Lubbock in 1923. A separate university, [[Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center]], opened as Texas Tech University School of Medicine in 1969. Both universities are now overseen by the [[Texas Tech University System]], after it was established in 1996 and based in Lubbock. [[Lubbock Christian University]], founded in 1957, and [[Sunset International Bible Institute]], both affiliated with the [[Churches of Christ]], have their main campuses in the city. [[South Plains College]] and [[Wayland Baptist University]] operate branch campuses in Lubbock.\n\nAt one time, Lubbock was home to [[Reese Air Force Base]], located {{convert|6|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} west of the city. It was established in August 1941, during the defense build-up prior to [[World War II]] (1941-1945), by the [[United States Department of War]] and the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] as Lubbock Army Airfield. It served the old [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]], and later the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] (USAF), after reorganization and establishment in 1947. The USAF base's primary mission throughout its existence was pilot training. The base was closed 30 September 1997, after being selected for closure by the [[Base Realignment and Closure]] Commission in 1995, and is now a research and business park called [[Reese Technology Center]].\n\nThe city is home to the [[Lubbock Lake Landmark]], part of the [[Museum of Texas Tech University]]. The landmark is an archaeological and natural-history preserve at the northern edge of the city. It shows evidence of almost 12,000 years of human occupation in the region. The [[National Ranching Heritage Center]], also part of the Museum of Texas Tech University, houses historic ranch-related structures from the region.\n\nDuring World War II, airmen cadets from the Royal Air Force, flying from their training base at Terrell, Texas, routinely flew to Lubbock on training flights. The town served as a stand-in for the British for Cork, Ireland, which was the same distance from London, England, as Lubbock is from Terrell.\n\nIn August 1951, a V-shaped formation of lights was seen over the city. The \"[[Lubbock Lights]]\" series of sightings received national publicity and is regarded as one of the first great \"[[UFO]]\" cases. The sightings were considered credible because they were witnessed by several respected science professors at Texas Technological College and were photographed by a Texas Tech student. The photographs were reprinted nationwide in newspapers and in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''. [[Project Blue Book]], the USAF's official investigation of the UFO mystery, concluded the photographs were not a hoax and showed genuine objects, but dismissed the UFOs as being either \"night-flying moths\" or a type of bird called a [[plover]] reflected in the nighttime glow of Lubbock's new street lights.\n\nIn 1960, the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] reported Lubbock's population as 128,691 and area as {{convert|75.0|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"census\"/>\n\nOn May 11, 1970, the [[Lubbock Tornado]] struck the city. Twenty-six people died, and damage was estimated at $125 million. The [[Metro Tower (Lubbock)|Metro Tower]] (NTS Building), then known as the Great Plains Life Building, at {{convert|274|ft|m|abbr=on}} in height, is believed to have been the tallest building ever to survive a direct hit from an [[Fujita scale|F5]] tornado.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lub/climate/Local_interest_events/LUB_tornado/lubtor.html |title=Lubbock, Texas|publisher=[[National Weather Service]] Forecast Office |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061009180854/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/lub/climate/Local_interest_events/LUB_tornado/lubtor.html |archivedate = October 9, 2006}}</ref> Then-mayor [[Jim Granberry]] and the Lubbock City Council, which included Granberry's successor as mayor, [[Morris W. Turner]], were charged with directing the rebuilding of downtown Lubbock in the aftermath of the storm.\n\nIn August, 1988, tens of thousands of people came to Lubbock, drawn by an [[1988 Lubbock apparition of Mary|apparition of Mary]].\n\nIn 2009, Lubbock celebrated its centennial. The historians [[Paul H. Carlson]], Donald R. Abbe, and David J. Murrah co-authored ''Lubbock and the South Plains.''\n\nOn August 12, 2008, the Lubbock Chamber of Commerce announced they would lead the effort to get enough signatures to have a vote on allowing county-wide packaged alcohol sales.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chamber to Lead Alcohol Petition Effort |url=http://www.myfoxlubbock.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail?contentId=7191012&version=2&locale=EN-US&layoutCode=TSTY&pageId=1.1.1&sflg=1 |publisher=My Fox Lubbock |accessdate=2009-05-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714142817/http://www.myfoxlubbock.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail?contentId=7191012&version=2&locale=EN-US&layoutCode=TSTY&pageId=1.1.1&sflg=1 |archivedate=July 14, 2011 }}</ref> The petition effort was successful and the question was put to the voters.

[[Interstate 27 (Texas)|Interstate 27]] (the former Avenue H) links the city to [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]] and [[Interstate 40 (Texas)|Interstate 40]], a transcontinental route. I-27 was completed through the city in 1992 (it originally terminated just north of downtown). Other major highways include [[U.S. Highway 62 (Texas)|US 62]] and [[U.S. Highway 82 in Texas|US 82]], which run concurrently (except for 4th Street (82) and 19th Street (62)) through the city east\u2013west as the Marsha Sharp Freeway, 19th Street (62 only), 4th Street/Parkway Drive (82 only) and [[Idalou, Texas|Idalou]] Highway. [[U.S. Highway 84 (Texas)|US 84]] (Avenue Q/[[Slaton, Texas|Slaton]] Highway/[[Clovis, New Mexico|Clovis]] Road) is also another east\u2013west route running NW/SE diagonally. [[U.S. Highway 87 (Texas)|US Highway 87]] runs between [[San Angelo, Texas|San Angelo]] and Amarillo and follows I-27 concurrently. [[Texas State Highway 114|State Highway 114]] runs east\u2013west, following US 62/82 on the east before going its own way. Lubbock is circled by [[State Highway Loop 289 (Texas)|Loop 289]], which suffers from traffic congestion despite being a potential bypass around the city, which is the reason behind I-27 and Brownfield Highway being built through the city to have freeway traffic flow effectively inside the loop.\n\nThe city is set up on a simple [[grid plan]]. In the heart of the city, numbered streets run east\u2013west and lettered avenues run north\u2013south \u2013 the grid begins at Avenue A in the east and First Street in the north. North of First Street, city planners chose to name streets alphabetically from the south to the north after colleges and universities. The north\u2013south avenues run from A to Y. What would be Avenue Z is actually University Avenue, since it runs along the east side of Texas Tech. Beyond that, the A-to-Z convention resumes, using US cities found east of the Mississippi (e.g. Akron Avenue, Boston Avenue, Canton Avenue). Again, the Z name is not used, with Slide Road appearing in its place.\n\n====Rail service====\nLubbock currently does not provide [[intercity rail]] service, although various proposals have been presented over the years to remedy this. One, the ''[[Caprock Chief]]'', would have seen daily service as part of a [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], Texas\u2014[[Denver]], Colorado service, but it failed to gain interest.<ref>{{cite news | title=Lubbock officials backing plans for Amtrak rail service | url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/080201/tex_amtrakrail.shtml | date=August 2, 2001 | work=[[Amarillo Globe-News]] | accessdate=2008-05-14 | first=Chris | last=Van Wagenen | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604000244/http://amarillo.com/stories/080201/tex_amtrakrail.shtml | archive-date=June 4, 2011 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Lubbock is served by the BNSF Railway company, Plainsman Switching Company (PSC), and West Texas & Lubbock Railway (WTLC).

Options exist for transloading a variety of materials on the line, from wind-turbine parts to steel shafts. PSC handles many commodities such as cottonseed, cottonseed oil, cottonseed meal, cottonseed hulls, milo, corn, wheat, pinto beans, sand, rock, lumber, nonperishable food items, chemicals, paper products, brick, and bagging material, and can also store cars. WTLC interchanges with BNSF (also with UP through a UP-BNSF Haulage agreement) in Lubbock. WTLC has a yard on the west side of Lubbock, where they switch cars to go down their line to Levelland or to Brownfield. WTLC handles commodities of grains, chemicals, sands, peanuts, lumber, etc.\n\n====Airports====\n{{See also|Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport}}\n[[File:Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport IMG 0260.JPG|thumb|right|[[Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport]]]]\nThe city's air services are provided by [[Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport]], which is named for the Lubbock businessman who became [[lieutenant governor]] and governor of Texas. It is on the city's northeast side. The airport is the eighth-busiest airport in Texas. Lubbock Preston Smith Airport also plays host as a major hub to FedEx's feeder planes that serve cities around Lubbock.\n\n====Intercity bus service====\n[[Greyhound Lines]] operates the Lubbock Station at 801 Broadway, just east of the Lubbock County Courthouse.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greyhound.com/home/TicketCenter/en/terminal.asp?city=681791 |title=Greyhound |publisher=Greyhound |date= |accessdate=2015-07-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122230451/https://www.greyhound.com/home/TicketCenter/en/terminal.asp?city=681791 |archivedate=November 22, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n====Public transportation====\n{{See also|Citibus (Lubbock)}}\nPublic transportation is provided by [[Citibus (Lubbock)|Citibus]], a bus transit system running Monday through Saturday every week with a transit center hub in downtown. It runs bus routes throughout the city, with the main routes converging at the Downtown Transfer Plaza, which also houses the Greyhound bus terminal. Citibus has been in continual service since 1971, when the city of Lubbock took over public transit operations. The paratransit system is called Citiaccess.\n\nCitibus' six [[diesel-electric hybrid bus]]es have begun service on city routes. Managers hope the buses will use 60% of the fuel their older, larger versions consume in moving customers across the city. The buses seat 23 passengers, can support full-sized [[wheelchair]]s, and will run on all but two city-based routes.\n\n====Modal characteristics====\nAccording to the 2016 American Community Survey, 80.9% of working Lubbock (city) residents commuted by driving alone, 12.9% carpooled, 1% used public transportation, and 1.5% walked. About 1.5% used all other forms of transportation, including taxi, bicycle, and motorcycle. About 2.3% worked at home.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Census Reporter|title=Means of Transportation to Work by Age|accessdate=May 7, 2018|url=https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B08101&geo_ids=16000US4845000&primary_geo_id=16000US4845000}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, 7.3% of Lubbock households were without a car, which decreased to 5.6% in 2016.

Previously, Milwaukee was a 4-mile dirt road on farm land with hardly any traffic a mile or more from major development. With growth headed westward, the city allocated nearly $20 million to convert the road into a seven-lane concrete thoroughfare. In 2004, the city funded the project and other developments to come by establishing a new fund that tapped part of the franchise fees received. As of 2018, more than $124 million in street construction has been possible from the fund, including Slide Road, 98th Street, Indiana Avenue, and the last phases of the [[U.S. Route 82 in Texas|Marsha Sharp Freeway]]. Public Works Director Wood Franklin said Milwaukee Avenue was conceived on the \"build it and they will come\" theory. Marc McDougal, then the mayor of Lubbock, described the project as a well calculated risk that subsequently greatly benefited the city.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lubbockonline.com/news/20180728/leaders-say-lubbocks-milwaukee-avenue-took-creative-funding-project-of-similar-scope-not-foreseen|title=Leaders say Lubbock's Milwaukee Avenue took creative funding, project of similar scope not foreseen|author=Matt Dotray|date=July 28, 2018|newspaper=Lubbock Avalanche-Journal|accessdate=August 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==<!--consensus reached to standardize this heading per WP:WikiProject Cities/US Guideline --><!-- NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * * * * * * * * * *NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * NOTICE\u2022 Only people who already have a Wikipedia article may appear here.

As a colonel in 1861, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] organized his first command, the [[21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], in Mattoon.\n\nIt was mustered into service on September 6, 1862, with James Monroe as Colonel, Jonathan Biggs, of Westfield, Clark County, as Lieutenant Colonel, and James A. Connolly, of [[Charleston, Illinois]], as Major. On 19 September 1862, the Regiment was loaded into freight cars at Mattoon, and transported to [[Louisville, Kentucky]], where it was at once put to work, under Major General [[William \"Bull\" Nelson]], to fortify the city against Confederate General [[Braxton Bragg]], who was then advancing on it in pursuit of Union General [[Don Carlos Buell]].\n\nOn October 1, having been assigned to the Thirty-third Brigade (General [[William R.

Following the devastating bloodshed the 123rd was assigned to protect the railroad bridge across the Green River at [[Munfordville]], [[Kentucky]], in November and December 1862. It has become known as the \"Battle for the Bridge,\" which began when the Union garrison led by [[John T. Wilder]], prior to his assuming command of the 123rd, surrendered during the [[Battle of Munfordville]].\n\nThe 123rd was initially assigned to the [[Army of the Ohio]] from September 1862 to November 1862, and then to the [[Army of the Cumberland]] from November 1862 to June 1865. The commanding general of the Army of the Cumberland was [[William Rosecrans]]. The regiment was in the 1st Brigade with Colonel Albert S. Hall, which was part of the 5th Division commanded by Brigadier General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]], reporting to Major General [[George Henry Thomas]]. \n\nIn February and March 1863, it was converted to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois' brigade became known as \"Wilder's [[Lightning Brigade (US Army of the Cumberland 1863)|Lightning Brigade]]\" commanded by [[John T. Wilder|Wilder]].

It mainly covers an area of the historical and geographical region of [[Tropolje]]. As of 2013, it has a population of 33,032 inhabitants.\n\n== Name ==\nThe city's second name Tomislavgrad means literally \"Tomislav's town\". The name was changed from \u017dupanjac to Tomislavgrad in 1925 by King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] in tribute to his son [[Prince Tomislav of Yugoslavia|Prince Tomislav]] and also [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]], the first king of the [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|Kingdom of Croatia]], who was crowned in the area. The name was changed to Duvno after [[World War II]] by [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav communist authorities]]. In 1990 the name was restored to Tomislavgrad. Still, among inhabitants of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the local residents are often referred as ''Duvnjaci'' (\"Duvniaks\") and the town is often called Duvno. Also, the town is sometimes referred to simply as \"Tomislav\". The Catholic diocese in that area is still called [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mostar-Duvno|Mostar-Duvno]]. During the [[Roman Empire]] the town was called ''[[Delminium]]'' and during the medieval period in [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|Kingdom of Croatia]] and [[Kingdom of Bosnia]] it was called ''\u017dupanjac''. Under the [[Ottoman Empire]], it was called ''\u017dupanj-potok'' and in Austria-Hungary, ''\u017dupanjac''.\n[[File:Suica River, Suica BH.jpg|thumb|300px|The Duvno field]]\n\n== Location ==\nTomislavgrad is {{Convert|38|km|mi}} from the canton seat [[Livno]], {{Convert|88|km|mi}} from [[Mostar]], and {{Convert|162|km|mi}} from [[Sarajevo]].<ref>[https://archive.is/20130105041939/http://www.viamichelin.com/viamichelin/int/dyn/controller/Itineraires?strStartLocid=31NDRlYTYxMGNORE11TnpFeU1qaz1jTVRjdU1qQTVNemM9&strDestLocid=31NDNhZDMxMGNORE11T0RFM09UWT1jTVRjdU1ESXlOalE9strStartLocid=31NDRlYTYxMGNORE11TnpFeU1qaz1jTVRjdU1qQTVNemM9&strDestLocid=31NDNhZDMxMGNORE11T0RFM09UWT1jTVRjdU1ESXlOalE9&empriseW=315&empriseH=275&intItineraryType=5&caravaneHidden=false&vh=CAR&distance=km&strVehicle=0&devise=1.0|EUR&carbCost=1.3&isAvoidFrontiers=false&isFavoriseAutoroute=false&isAvoidPeage=false&isAvoidVignette=false&isAvoidLNR=false&autoConso=6.8&villeConso=6&routeConso=5.6&dtmDeparture=10/06/2009&indemnite=0&itineraryCarType=0&itineraryFuelType=0 ]</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n=== Municipality ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Archeological collection of monastery in [[\u0160iroki Brijeg]] had few items founded on area of Duvno from Bronze Age: 34 bronze sickles, 3 axes and 2 spears. Those items were found in [[Stipanji\u0107i]] and [[Lug (Duvno)|Lug]] near Duvno. Those items were given to Archeological collection \"fra Mijo \u010cui\u0107 and fra Stjepan Naletili\u0107\". Later, Fr Vojislav Mikuli\u0107 found a bronze axe in [[Letka]] which he gave to those collections. Unfortunately, collection was destroyed in fire at the end of World War II. Only one sickle and axe survived the tragedy.<ref name=Bagaric/> However, this collection says that population of Duvno at the time worked in primary sector, they were cattlemen, farmers and warriors.<ref name=Bagaric/> \n\nUnlike their unnamed predecessors, [[Illyrians]] left material proofs from their time. On the slopes of the mountains which circle Tomislavgrad, Illyrians built 36 fortifications. These forts served as watchtower or forts against the enemy. There are also many graves of Illyrians which means that they cared about their dead. Same as forts, graves are dating from Bronze and Iron Age to Roman conquest of Delminium (Tomislavgrad). In the graves of dead Illyrians, jewellery and items which the dead used, were found.<ref name=Bagaric/>\n\nAnother inhabitants, except Illyrians, were [[Celts]]. They brought higher culture, crafts and most importantly better arms.<ref name=Bagaric2>{{in lang|hr}} Bagari\u0107, Ivo. Duvno - Short Monograph. \u017dupni ured sv. Franje Asi\u0161kog, Bukovica. 1980.</ref> But soon, Celts have been assimilated as Illyrians, since there was only small number of them.<ref name=Bagaric2/>\n\nAs Romans conquered territory of Illyrian tribe [[Ardiaei]], and so, [[Delmatae]]s and their tribal union were last bastion of Illyrian freedom. The Dalmatae attacked Roman wards near Neretva, Greek merchant towns and the Roman friendly Illyrian tribe [[Daors]]. The Illyrians upgraded their settlements into strong forts and surrounded their capital with wreath of smaller forts.<ref name=Bagaric2/> It is assumed that, during that time, 5,000 Dalmatae lived in Delminium.<ref name=Bagaric2/>\n\nIn 167 BC Illyrian forts could not stop Roman legions and Rome conquered the entire Adriatic coast south of Neretva; the state of the Ardieaei was also destroyed.  The first conflict between the Dalmatae and Rome started in 156 BC. The consuls [[Gaius Marcius Figulus (consul 162 BC)|Gaius Marcius Figulus]], then [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Corculum]] conquered and destroyed Delminium; the latter received a triumph in Rome for this victory. Reports of writers during that time say that Delminium was a \"large city\", almost inaccessible and impregnable. Romans shot lighted arrows at wooden houses, which then burned the city.<ref name=Bagaric2/> After various rebellions led by Dalmatae and three wars with Rome, their land was lastly conquered for good in 9 AD.{{cn|date=March 2016}}\n\n====Roman time====\nAfter Roman conquest of Delminium, they started building roads and bridges. Roads that led to mainland of Balkans from Adriatic coast in [[Salona]] (Solin) and [[Narona]] ([[Vid, Croatia|Vid]] near [[Metkovi\u0107]]) crossed in Delminium (Duvno). Remains of those and other Roman roads are still in existence.<ref name=Bagaric/> Romans introduced their culture, language, legislation and religion. For next 400 years Duvno was in peace.\n\nAfter the Romans defeated Dalmatae, Duvno was almost abandoned. There was also, for some period, a military crew of Romans stationed there to keep Illyrians under control.<ref name=Bagaric/> Romans started to rebuild Delminium in 18 and 19 AD in time of emperor [[Tiberius]].<ref name=Bagaric/> During that time the center of the city was built, a Roman forum. This forum was built on possession of present-day Nikola Taveli\u0107 basilica.<ref name=Bagaric/> \n\nIn 1896 Fra An\u0111eo Nu\u0107 discovered various sculptures of Roman pagan deities, fragments of pagan sarcophagi, and fragments of columns of medieval Christian church. From all those discoveries, most prominent are two votive monuments and altars dedicated to goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], one altar dedicated to native Illyrian god Armatus and one votive plate dedicated to goddess [[Libera (mythology)|Libera]]. Later, relief of goddess Diana was also found and one relief of Diana and [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]] together. Also, new pagan altars, fragments of sarcophagi, clay pottery, parts of columns, and various other findings from Roman and early medieval age were found. This led to conclusion that on place of present-day Catholic graveyard \"Karaula\" (which was previously an Ottoman military border post and guardhouse) was Roman and Illyrian pagan sanctuary and graveyard.<ref name=Bagaric/>\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\nCroats settled this area in the 7th century, and the area was renamed to \u017dupanjac. The area around Tomislavgrad was important in Croatian history in Croatian early Middle Ages. According to the Cronicle of Doclea priest the most important event from this period was the first assembly of Croatia in the year 753. The first Croatian court was made at the mountain Lib when Croats have arrived to Duvno area. In that court duke Budimir has hosted the deputy of [[Pope Stephen II]] and Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine V]]. \n\nThere were made the prepairement for the Great assembly of kingdom and Church. At that assembly the country was divided on the three big regions, divided on more autonomous provinces, whose borders were taken from the Roman times. It has been determined the administration, taxes and justice system. It is a commonly accepted theory that coronation assembly of [[King Tomislav]] was placed in the 925 at that area.\n\nThe Duvno field with the city of \u017dupanjac was in the possession of Croatian kings till the 2nd half of the 13th century when it became the possession of noble family \u0160ubi\u0107. At the end of 13th and beginning of 14th century, the \u0160ubi\u0107 family, with approval from the [[Pope Boniface VIII]], established three dioceses on the territory of the [[Archdiocese of Split]], the Diocese of [[\u0160ibenik]], the Diocese of [[Makarska]] and the Diocese of Duvno. The motive for the establishment of those dioceses was to halt the spread of the [[Bosnian Church]] and strengthening of \u0160ubi\u0107s' influence in the area. The seat of the Diocese of Duvno was the Church of Saint John the Baptist, located in the town of Rog, near the present-day [[Ro\u0161ko Polje]]. The bishops of Duvno served mostly as assistants to the archbishop of Split or were only titular bishops.\n\nUntil 1320s, Duvno was part of the [[Croatia in the union with Hungary|Kingdom of Croatia]], when [[Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia]] took the land from \u0160ubi\u0107s and incorporated it in the [[Banate of Bosnia]]. Duvno became a part of the [[Tropolje|Western Regions]], a province of the Banate of Bosnia, together with [[Livno]] and [[Glamo\u010d]]. However, the population of the Western Regions didn't identify with the Bosnian Kingdom. After King [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko]] gave in the territory of [[Zachlumia]] westwards from the [[Neretva]] river to the Hungarian and Croatian King [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]] in 1357, Duvno became the southwesternmost part of his realm towards the Kingdom of Croatia. \n\nA struggle broke out in the village of Kolo, in Duvno, in 1374, due to a division over loyalty between the Bosnian and Croatian-Hungarian King. For this reason, Tvrtko took over the village and gave it to the Semkovi\u0107 family from [[Usora (region)|Usora]], and their ownership over the village was confirmed by King [[Dabi\u0161a]] in 1395. In 1404, King [[Stephen Ostoja of Bosnia|Ostoja]] gave Duvno and Glamo\u010d to Duke [[Pavle Kle\u0161i\u0107]]. In 1444 or earlier, Duvno became a possession of [[Stjepan Vuk\u010di\u0107 Kosa\u010da]], the duke of the [[Duchy of Saint Sava]].\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\n[[File:D\u017eud\u017ea-D\u017eaferova d\u017eamija,TG.567.jpg|thumb|200px|D\u017eud\u017ea D\u017eafer Mosque in Tomislavgrad]]\nDuvno was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1477, who established the [[Nahiyah]] of Duvno, and incorporated it to the [[Sanjak of Herzegovina]]. It became part of the [[Kadiluk]] of [[Fo\u010da]]. Somewhere before 1519, Duvno was incorporated to the Kadiluk of [[Mostar]]. For a short period between 1528 and 1537, Duvno was part of the [[Sanjak of Bosnia]], and during the same period it was part of the Kadiluk of Neretva. It was again incorporated to the Sanjak of Herzegovina and the Kadiluk of Mostar.\n\nIn the middle 16th century, the Ottomans founded a [[qasaba]] \u017dupanj-Potok. In 1576 Duvno became part of the Kadiluk of [[Imotski]], and it became a kadiluk on its own before 1633. In the second half of the 17th century, Duvno became a part of the [[Sanjak of Klis]], however, it was soon returned to the Herzegovinian Sanjak. At the beginning of the 18th century, Duvno became a [[captaincy]], with the seat in the town of Rog. However, due to security reasons, the seat was transferred in 1711 to the Seddi Cedid, a fort built in \u017dupanj-Potok.\n\n[[Hamdija Kre\u0161evljakovi\u0107]] mentions a borough named ''Duvno'' at the end of the 17th century and also states that this borough became a [[kaza]] in the first years of the 18th century. In the middle of the 17th century [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]], a famous Turkish travel writer, stated that Duvno \"looks like a paradise garden, it is part of the Sanjak of Klis and has four hundred of houses and one imposing mosque, many masjids, one inn, one hamam and ten shops.\" Duvno remained under the Ottoman rule until 1878 when [[Austria-Hungary]] occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina after the [[Berlin Congress]].\n\n===Austria-Hungary===\n===Kingdom of Yugoslavia===\n{{unsourced|section|date=March 2016}}\n[[File:Stjepan Podhorsky- bazilika sv. \u0106irila i sv.

It mainly covers an area of the historical and geographical region of [[Tropolje]]. As of 2013, it has a population of 33,032 inhabitants.\n\n== Name ==\nThe city's second name Tomislavgrad means literally \"Tomislav's town\". The name was changed from \u017dupanjac to Tomislavgrad in 1925 by King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] in tribute to his son [[Prince Tomislav of Yugoslavia|Prince Tomislav]] and also [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]], the first king of the [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|Kingdom of Croatia]], who was crowned in the area. The name was changed to Duvno after [[World War II]] by [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav communist authorities]]. In 1990 the name was restored to Tomislavgrad. Still, among inhabitants of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the local residents are often referred as ''Duvnjaci'' (\"Duvniaks\") and the town is often called Duvno. Also, the town is sometimes referred to simply as \"Tomislav\". The Catholic diocese in that area is still called [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mostar-Duvno|Mostar-Duvno]]. During the [[Roman Empire]] the town was called ''[[Delminium]]'' and during the medieval period in [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|Kingdom of Croatia]] and [[Kingdom of Bosnia]] it was called ''\u017dupanjac''. Under the [[Ottoman Empire]], it was called ''\u017dupanj-potok'' and in Austria-Hungary, ''\u017dupanjac''.\n[[File:Suica River, Suica BH.jpg|thumb|300px|The Duvno field]]\n\n== Location ==\nTomislavgrad is {{Convert|38|km|mi}} from the canton seat [[Livno]], {{Convert|88|km|mi}} from [[Mostar]], and {{Convert|162|km|mi}} from [[Sarajevo]].<ref>[https://archive.is/20130105041939/http://www.viamichelin.com/viamichelin/int/dyn/controller/Itineraires?strStartLocid=31NDRlYTYxMGNORE11TnpFeU1qaz1jTVRjdU1qQTVNemM9&strDestLocid=31NDNhZDMxMGNORE11T0RFM09UWT1jTVRjdU1ESXlOalE9strStartLocid=31NDRlYTYxMGNORE11TnpFeU1qaz1jTVRjdU1qQTVNemM9&strDestLocid=31NDNhZDMxMGNORE11T0RFM09UWT1jTVRjdU1ESXlOalE9&empriseW=315&empriseH=275&intItineraryType=5&caravaneHidden=false&vh=CAR&distance=km&strVehicle=0&devise=1.0|EUR&carbCost=1.3&isAvoidFrontiers=false&isFavoriseAutoroute=false&isAvoidPeage=false&isAvoidVignette=false&isAvoidLNR=false&autoConso=6.8&villeConso=6&routeConso=5.6&dtmDeparture=10/06/2009&indemnite=0&itineraryCarType=0&itineraryFuelType=0 ]</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n=== Municipality ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

On the slopes of the mountains which circle Tomislavgrad, Illyrians built 36 fortifications. These forts served as watchtower or forts against the enemy. There are also many graves of Illyrians which means that they cared about their dead. Same as forts, graves are dating from Bronze and Iron Age to Roman conquest of Delminium (Tomislavgrad). In the graves of dead Illyrians, jewellery and items which the dead used, were found.<ref name=Bagaric/>\n\nAnother inhabitants, except Illyrians, were [[Celts]]. They brought higher culture, crafts and most importantly better arms.<ref name=Bagaric2>{{in lang|hr}} Bagari\u0107, Ivo. Duvno - Short Monograph. \u017dupni ured sv. Franje Asi\u0161kog, Bukovica. 1980.</ref> But soon, Celts have been assimilated as Illyrians, since there was only small number of them.<ref name=Bagaric2/>\n\nAs Romans conquered territory of Illyrian tribe [[Ardiaei]], and so, [[Delmatae]]s and their tribal union were last bastion of Illyrian freedom. The Dalmatae attacked Roman wards near Neretva, Greek merchant towns and the Roman friendly Illyrian tribe [[Daors]]. The Illyrians upgraded their settlements into strong forts and surrounded their capital with wreath of smaller forts.<ref name=Bagaric2/> It is assumed that, during that time, 5,000 Dalmatae lived in Delminium.<ref name=Bagaric2/>\n\nIn 167 BC Illyrian forts could not stop Roman legions and Rome conquered the entire Adriatic coast south of Neretva; the state of the Ardieaei was also destroyed.  The first conflict between the Dalmatae and Rome started in 156 BC. The consuls [[Gaius Marcius Figulus (consul 162 BC)|Gaius Marcius Figulus]], then [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Corculum]] conquered and destroyed Delminium; the latter received a triumph in Rome for this victory. Reports of writers during that time say that Delminium was a \"large city\", almost inaccessible and impregnable. Romans shot lighted arrows at wooden houses, which then burned the city.<ref name=Bagaric2/> After various rebellions led by Dalmatae and three wars with Rome, their land was lastly conquered for good in 9 AD.{{cn|date=March 2016}}\n\n====Roman time====\nAfter Roman conquest of Delminium, they started building roads and bridges. Roads that led to mainland of Balkans from Adriatic coast in [[Salona]] (Solin) and [[Narona]] ([[Vid, Croatia|Vid]] near [[Metkovi\u0107]]) crossed in Delminium (Duvno). Remains of those and other Roman roads are still in existence.<ref name=Bagaric/> Romans introduced their culture, language, legislation and religion. For next 400 years Duvno was in peace.\n\nAfter the Romans defeated Dalmatae, Duvno was almost abandoned. There was also, for some period, a military crew of Romans stationed there to keep Illyrians under control.<ref name=Bagaric/> Romans started to rebuild Delminium in 18 and 19 AD in time of emperor [[Tiberius]].<ref name=Bagaric/> During that time the center of the city was built, a Roman forum. This forum was built on possession of present-day Nikola Taveli\u0107 basilica.<ref name=Bagaric/> \n\nIn 1896 Fra An\u0111eo Nu\u0107 discovered various sculptures of Roman pagan deities, fragments of pagan sarcophagi, and fragments of columns of medieval Christian church. From all those discoveries, most prominent are two votive monuments and altars dedicated to goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], one altar dedicated to native Illyrian god Armatus and one votive plate dedicated to goddess [[Libera (mythology)|Libera]]. Later, relief of goddess Diana was also found and one relief of Diana and [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]] together. Also, new pagan altars, fragments of sarcophagi, clay pottery, parts of columns, and various other findings from Roman and early medieval age were found. This led to conclusion that on place of present-day Catholic graveyard \"Karaula\" (which was previously an Ottoman military border post and guardhouse) was Roman and Illyrian pagan sanctuary and graveyard.<ref name=Bagaric/>\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\nCroats settled this area in the 7th century, and the area was renamed to \u017dupanjac. The area around Tomislavgrad was important in Croatian history in Croatian early Middle Ages. According to the Cronicle of Doclea priest the most important event from this period was the first assembly of Croatia in the year 753. The first Croatian court was made at the mountain Lib when Croats have arrived to Duvno area. In that court duke Budimir has hosted the deputy of [[Pope Stephen II]] and Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine V]]. \n\nThere were made the prepairement for the Great assembly of kingdom and Church. At that assembly the country was divided on the three big regions, divided on more autonomous provinces, whose borders were taken from the Roman times. It has been determined the administration, taxes and justice system. It is a commonly accepted theory that coronation assembly of [[King Tomislav]] was placed in the 925 at that area.\n\nThe Duvno field with the city of \u017dupanjac was in the possession of Croatian kings till the 2nd half of the 13th century when it became the possession of noble family \u0160ubi\u0107. At the end of 13th and beginning of 14th century, the \u0160ubi\u0107 family, with approval from the [[Pope Boniface VIII]], established three dioceses on the territory of the [[Archdiocese of Split]], the Diocese of [[\u0160ibenik]], the Diocese of [[Makarska]] and the Diocese of Duvno. The motive for the establishment of those dioceses was to halt the spread of the [[Bosnian Church]] and strengthening of \u0160ubi\u0107s' influence in the area. The seat of the Diocese of Duvno was the Church of Saint John the Baptist, located in the town of Rog, near the present-day [[Ro\u0161ko Polje]]. The bishops of Duvno served mostly as assistants to the archbishop of Split or were only titular bishops.\n\nUntil 1320s, Duvno was part of the [[Croatia in the union with Hungary|Kingdom of Croatia]], when [[Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia]] took the land from \u0160ubi\u0107s and incorporated it in the [[Banate of Bosnia]]. Duvno became a part of the [[Tropolje|Western Regions]], a province of the Banate of Bosnia, together with [[Livno]] and [[Glamo\u010d]]. However, the population of the Western Regions didn't identify with the Bosnian Kingdom. After King [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko]] gave in the territory of [[Zachlumia]] westwards from the [[Neretva]] river to the Hungarian and Croatian King [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]] in 1357, Duvno became the southwesternmost part of his realm towards the Kingdom of Croatia. \n\nA struggle broke out in the village of Kolo, in Duvno, in 1374, due to a division over loyalty between the Bosnian and Croatian-Hungarian King. For this reason, Tvrtko took over the village and gave it to the Semkovi\u0107 family from [[Usora (region)|Usora]], and their ownership over the village was confirmed by King [[Dabi\u0161a]] in 1395. In 1404, King [[Stephen Ostoja of Bosnia|Ostoja]] gave Duvno and Glamo\u010d to Duke [[Pavle Kle\u0161i\u0107]]. In 1444 or earlier, Duvno became a possession of [[Stjepan Vuk\u010di\u0107 Kosa\u010da]], the duke of the [[Duchy of Saint Sava]].\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\n[[File:D\u017eud\u017ea-D\u017eaferova d\u017eamija,TG.567.jpg|thumb|200px|D\u017eud\u017ea D\u017eafer Mosque in Tomislavgrad]]\nDuvno was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1477, who established the [[Nahiyah]] of Duvno, and incorporated it to the [[Sanjak of Herzegovina]]. It became part of the [[Kadiluk]] of [[Fo\u010da]]. Somewhere before 1519, Duvno was incorporated to the Kadiluk of [[Mostar]]. For a short period between 1528 and 1537, Duvno was part of the [[Sanjak of Bosnia]], and during the same period it was part of the Kadiluk of Neretva. It was again incorporated to the Sanjak of Herzegovina and the Kadiluk of Mostar.\n\nIn the middle 16th century, the Ottomans founded a [[qasaba]] \u017dupanj-Potok. In 1576 Duvno became part of the Kadiluk of [[Imotski]], and it became a kadiluk on its own before 1633. In the second half of the 17th century, Duvno became a part of the [[Sanjak of Klis]], however, it was soon returned to the Herzegovinian Sanjak. At the beginning of the 18th century, Duvno became a [[captaincy]], with the seat in the town of Rog. However, due to security reasons, the seat was transferred in 1711 to the Seddi Cedid, a fort built in \u017dupanj-Potok.\n\n[[Hamdija Kre\u0161evljakovi\u0107]] mentions a borough named ''Duvno'' at the end of the 17th century and also states that this borough became a [[kaza]] in the first years of the 18th century. In the middle of the 17th century [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]], a famous Turkish travel writer, stated that Duvno \"looks like a paradise garden, it is part of the Sanjak of Klis and has four hundred of houses and one imposing mosque, many masjids, one inn, one hamam and ten shops.\" Duvno remained under the Ottoman rule until 1878 when [[Austria-Hungary]] occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina after the [[Berlin Congress]].\n\n===Austria-Hungary===\n===Kingdom of Yugoslavia===\n{{unsourced|section|date=March 2016}}\n[[File:Stjepan Podhorsky- bazilika sv. \u0106irila i sv.

He is known for his three-volume work ''Gnosis: Study and Commentaries on the Esoteric Tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy''.<ref name=\"inner\">Smoley, Richard, ''Inner Christianity: A Guide to the Esoteric Tradition''. Boston: Shambhala, 2002, p.41.</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\n=== Early years: Russia ===\nBoris Mouravieff was born in Kronstadt, Imperial Russia, on 8th March 1890. He was the second of Count Piotr Petrovitch Mouravieff's three sons. His father was an [[Admiral]] and [[Secretary of State]] to the [[Russian Imperial Navy]]. His ancestor's included General Prince [[Nikola\u00ef Mouraviev-Karsski | Nicolas Mouravieff -Karski]], [[Andre\u00ef Mouraviov | Andrei Nikolaevich Mouravieff]], General Count [[Mikha\u00efl Mouraviov-Vilenski | Michel Mouravieff-Vilenski]] and General Count [[Nikola\u00ef Mouraviov-Amourski | Nicolas Mouravieff-Amourski]].\n\nPatented officer of the Superior School of the Imperial Russian Navy in 1910, Boris Mouravieff rose through the ranks, serving in particular from 1909 to 1912 aboard the [[Aurora (cruiser) | battleship \"Aurora\"]] which became famous in 1917, giving the signal for the [[February Revolution | Bolshevik Revolution]]. During the [[First World War]], he served in the naval forces of the [[Black Sea]]. In 1916-1917, lieutenant, he commanded the flotillas of fast torpedo boats of which he had been the designer and the promoter.\n\nWhen [[Nicholas II of Russia | Nicolas II]] was abdicated in March 1917, he was promoted to frigate captain at 27, before being appointed [[Chef de cabinet]] to Minister [[Alexandre Kerensky]] in the first provisional government, led by prince [[Gueorgui Lvov]]. He was then appointed deputy chief of staff of the Black Sea fleet by Kerensky, who in turn became head of the Russian government until his overthrow by the Bolsheviks during the [[October Revolution]] of 1917.\n\nThe day after the [[Brest-Litovsk Peace]], in 1918, he left the army. He then remained in [[Crimea]] to devote himself to archaeological work as well as his esoteric and historical research.\n\nFrom his youth, Boris Mouravieff became interested in the tradition of Eastern [[Orthodoxy]], helped by indications left by [[Andre\u00ef Mouraviov | Andr\u00e9i Mouravieff]], his great-uncle (who died in 1874), who was the founder of a hermitage, St. Andr\u00e9 (ski), one of the great Orthodox monasteries of [[Mount Athos]]. The latter had undertaken research in [[Egypt]], [[Armenia]], [[Kurdistan]] and even [[Persia]] to find traces of this tradition and manuscripts from the first centuries of our time.\n\nAt the end of 1920, Boris Mouravieff left Russia for [[Constantinople]] then [[Bulgaria]], until 1924.\n\n=== Exile ===\nIn Constantinople, in 1920-21, Boris Mouravieff attended public lectures given by [[P. D. Ouspensky]]. This is where the latter puts Boris Mouravieff in touch with [[Gurdjieff]], with whom he will later have several contacts, at [[Fontainebleau]] and [[Paris]], without having been his disciple . For many years, Boris Mouravieff and Ouspensky, linked by a friendship based on the same spirit of research, will be brought to deepen and compare their work during their meetings in Paris or in [[London]]. They will meet for the last time at the castle of Lyne, near London, in May 1937. Boris Mouravieff specifies the nature of his links with Ouspensky and GI Gurdjieff in a study published in 1957: \u201cOuspensky, Gurdjieff and the Fragments of a teaching unknown \u201d(in Revue\u201c Synth\u00e8ses \u201d, Brussels). This article is taken up in a work published by Dervy in September 2008 under the title \"Writings on Ouspensky, Gurdjieff and on the Christian Esoteric Tradition\".\n\n=== In France ===\nIn 1924, Boris Mouravieff arrived in [[France]] as a refugee. He first resides in Paris, then settles in [[Bordeaux]]. In 1935, he met Larissa Bassof-Volkoff, born in 1901 in [[Tashkent]], in [[Uzbekistan]]. She is a ballerina and mother of a child from a first marriage, Boris Vsevolod Volkoff, born in 1928 in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine | Neuilly]]. Boris Mouravieff married her in 1936 and all three moved to Paris the same year.\n\nSince 1921, Boris Mouravieff has pursued his research relating to the political and diplomatic history of Russia, and in particular to [[Peter I the Great | Pierre the Great]], which will give rise to the publication of several works.\n\nUntil 1941, he worked as a consulting engineer for various oil companies, while devoting his free time to his historical research, as well as to the esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy.\n\nOn June 11, 1940, Boris Mouravieff left Paris for [[Carry-le-Rouet]] in the South of France, where the firm that employed him had relocated. He then moved to [[Aix-en-Provence]] until July 1943, and finally to [[Haute-Savoie]], [[Neuvecelle]], above [[Evian]]. Refusing to collaborate with the Germans, he was arrested in early 1944 by the [[Gestapo]], interned in [[Annemasse]], then released under surveillance.\n\n=== Switzerland ===\nAt this point resistance fighters of the French Gendarmerie in the department organised his flight and that of his family on March 9, 1944 for [[Switzerland]]. Received as refugees, Boris and Larissa Mouravieff are first assigned to residence in a refugee camp in [[Randa]] in [[Valais]]. At the end of the war, they were allowed to settle in Geneva in an establishment called \"Home for intellectual refugees\", while waiting to occupy an apartment in town.\n\nBoris Mouravieff is 55 years old. He has to start from scratch again. His material situation is precarious: he hardly earns his living by means of lessons and industrial translations.\n\nAs early as April 1945, Boris Mouravieff applied for enrolment as a student at the [[Institute for Advanced International and Development Studies | Institute for Advanced International Studies]] in Geneva. In 1951, he graduated from this institute for his work: \"The Russian-Turkish Alliance in the Middle of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]\".\n\nAround the same time, his wife opened the \"Larissa Mouravieff Classical Dance School\", which she ran for a quarter of a century. At the beginning, Boris Mouravieff participated by accompanying the lessons, on the piano.\n\nDuring this period, he undertook work to formalize the esoteric Christian tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy. He initially planned to present this doctrine in romantic form (unfinished manuscript: \"Initiation - The life and dreams of Boris Kouratov\").\n\n=== Teaching ===\nIn April 1955, Boris Mouravieff becomes [[privat-docent]] at [[University of Geneva]] where he gives two courses until 1961, one concerning the history of Russia before 1917 and the other esoteric philosophy. This last course will be entitled precisely: \"Introduction to esoteric philosophy according to the esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy\". It will regularly bring together between ten and thirty students. The introductory speech of the 1956 academic year on the theme of \"The Problem of the New Man\" will be published by the journal \"Syntheses\". Other articles will follow this first publication.\n\nThe teaching provided at the University of Geneva served as the basis for writing his master work, \"Gn\u00f4sis\", the first volume of which was published in April 1961 by the editions \"La Colombe\" in Paris. The mastery and the clarity of the presentation were recognized and the work obtained the following year the price of esoteric literature [[Victor-\u00c9mile Michelet]]. A rigorous and concrete spirit, Boris Mouravieff presents and comments, through this work, the esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy in a language that is clear and accessible to a cultivated person of our time.\n\nThat same year, 1961, Boris Mouravieff created the Center for Esoteric Christian Studies (C.E.C.E.), based in Geneva, which he chaired and led until his death. The main goal assigned to the C.E.C.E. was to contribute to the formation of the New Man whom Boris Mouravieff wished for, in a critical historical period - ours - which he qualified as\n\"Transition period\", between a cycle which is ending and a new cycle, carrying promises as much as heavy dangers.\n\nFollowing the publication of volume I of '' Gn\u00f4sis '', Boris Mouravieff receives a voluminous correspondence. He does not just respond to people interested in the education disclosed in \"Gn\u00f4sis\": he encourages the creation of study groups that are emerging in Geneva, Paris, [[Lille]], [[Brussels] ], [[Cairo]], at {{lh | Congo}}, etc. These groups, formed under the aegis of the C.E.C.E., aimed to jointly deepen the doctrine set out in Gn\u00f4sis.\n\nIn 1962, Boris Mouravieff took leave of the University of Geneva to devote himself entirely to the activities of the Center and to the writing of the last two volumes of the trilogy of \"Gn\u00f4sis\". Volume II appeared in 1962, volume III in 1965.\n\nWithin the framework of the C.E.C.E., Boris Mouravieff sees his audience widened to multiple groups whose work he follows, personally responding to the collective or individual questioning of their members. Visits will support the activity of certain groups such as Paris, Lille or Brussels. In the same way, he made a trip to [[Greece]] in July 1964 (A translation of \"Gn\u00f4sis\" in Greek was made following this trip).\n\nTo inform the groups and coordinate their work, \"Information Bulletins\" are periodically published by the C.E.C.E. for members. The development of the activity of the C.E.C.E. was made possible thanks to a patronage which made it possible to have the necessary material means.\n\nThe last years of Boris Mouravieff's life are devoted to this teaching activity. In a perspective of clarification, deepening and practical application, he undertook the writing of a \u201cCollection of Notes on esoteric Christian teaching: The Stromata\u201d, in imitation of [[Clement of Alexandria] ]. With these Stromates, grouped under the general title of \"The Art of Winning\", Boris Mouravieff embarks on a vast and ambitious project. The aim was to supplement the teaching given in \"Gn\u00f4sis\" with practical elements answering the questions that the study of doctrine raised among students. The first chapter appeared in 1966. Two other chapters were published posthumously.\n\n=== Death ===\nThis intense activity has an impact on Boris Mouravieff's state of health. In March 1965, already, a heart attack imposed him a short rest in Cannes. In June 1966, he was struck down by a crisis of rheumatoid arthritis accompanied by severe pain which forced him to live in bed.\n\nBoris Mouravieff died in Geneva of a [[heart attack]] on September 28, 1966, at 8.15 p.m., at the age of 76. He rests at [[Geneva # Saint-Georges | Saint-Georges cemetery]], in Geneva <ref> At N \u00b0 2071, District 3, of the St-Georges Cemetery,\nPlateau de Saint-Georges - 1 avenue du Cimeti\u00e8re, 1213 Petit-Lancy (Geneva). </ref>.\n\nThe C.E.C.E. ceases operations shortly after the death of its founder.\n\n=== Posterity ===\nHis widow, Larissa Mouravieff published chapters 2 and 3 of the first \"Stromate\" in 1968 and 1970. She watches over the archives of the Center and, in 1988, has them deposited at the [[Library of Geneva | Public and University Library of Geneva]] before leaving for [[Canada]] to join her son. Larissa Mouravieff died in [[Montreal]] on September 26, 1989, leaving Boris Vsevolod Volkoff, sole heir of rights. When the latter died, in March 2012, the remaining archives were handed over to the Library of Geneva (BGE, department of manuscripts), where a Mouravieff collection had been set up, which could be consulted by researchers who request it.\n\n==Bibliography==\n'''Political and Diplomatic History (in French)'''\n* ''L\u2019histoire de Russie mal connue'' (\u00e9puis\u00e9).\n* ''Le Testament de Pierre le Grand, l\u00e9gende et r\u00e9alit\u00e9'', \u00e0 la Baconni\u00e8re, Collection \u00ab L\u2019\u00e9volution du monde et des id\u00e9es \u00bb.

He is known for his three-volume work ''Gnosis: Study and Commentaries on the Esoteric Tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy''.<ref name=\"inner\">Smoley, Richard, ''Inner Christianity: A Guide to the Esoteric Tradition''. Boston: Shambhala, 2002, p.41.</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\n=== Early years: Russia ===\nBoris Mouravieff was born in Kronstadt, Imperial Russia, on 8 March 1890. He was the second of Count Piotr Petrovitch Mouravieff's three sons, [[Admiral]] and [[Secretary of State]] to the Imperial War Navy and included in his ancestry General Prince [[Nikola\u00ef Mouraviev-Karsski | Nicolas Mouravieff -Karski]], [[Andre\u00ef Mouraviov | Andr\u00e9 Mouravieff]], General Count [[Mikha\u00efl Mouraviov-Vilenski | Michel Mouravieff-Vilenski]] and General Count [[Nikola\u00ef Mouraviov-Amourski | Nicolas Mouravieff-Amourski]].\n\nPatented officer of the Superior School of the Imperial Russian Navy in 1910, Boris Mouravieff rose through the ranks, serving in particular from 1909 to 1912 aboard the [[Aurora (cruiser) | battleship \"Aurora\"]] which became famous in 1917, giving the signal for the [[February Revolution | Bolshevik Revolution]]. During the [[First World War]], he served in the naval forces of the [[Black Sea]]. In 1916-1917, lieutenant, he commanded the flotillas of fast torpedo boats of which he had been the designer and the promoter.\n\nWhen [[Nicholas II of Russia | Nicolas II]] was abdicated in March 1917, he was promoted to frigate captain at 27, before being appointed [[Chef de cabinet]] to Minister [[Alexandre Kerensky]] in the first provisional government, led by prince [[Gueorgui Lvov]]. He was then appointed deputy chief of staff of the Black Sea fleet by Kerensky, who in turn became head of the Russian government until his overthrow by the Bolsheviks during the [[October Revolution]] of 1917.\n\nThe day after the [[Brest-Litovsk Peace]], in 1918, he left the army. He then remained in [[Crimea]] to devote himself to archaeological work as well as his esoteric and historical research.\n\nFrom his youth, Boris Mouravieff became interested in the tradition of Eastern [[Orthodoxy]], helped by indications left by [[Andre\u00ef Mouraviov | Andr\u00e9i Mouravieff]], his great-uncle (who died in 1874), who was the founder of a hermitage, St. Andr\u00e9 (ski), one of the great Orthodox monasteries of [[Mount Athos]]. The latter had undertaken research in [[Egypt]], [[Armenia]], [[Kurdistan]] and even [[Persia]] to find traces of this tradition and manuscripts from the first centuries of our time.\n\nAt the end of 1920, Boris Mouravieff left Russia for [[Constantinople]] then [[Bulgaria]], until 1924.\n\n=== Exile ===\nIn Constantinople, in 1920-21, Boris Mouravieff attended public lectures given by [[P. D. Ouspensky]]. This is where the latter puts Boris Mouravieff in touch with [[Gurdjieff]], with whom he will later have several contacts, at [[Fontainebleau]] and [[Paris]], without having been his disciple . For many years, Boris Mouravieff and Ouspensky, linked by a friendship based on the same spirit of research, will be brought to deepen and compare their work during their meetings in Paris or in [[London]]. They will meet for the last time at the castle of Lyne, near London, in May 1937. Boris Mouravieff specifies the nature of his links with Ouspensky and GI Gurdjieff in a study published in 1957: \u201cOuspensky, Gurdjieff and the Fragments of a teaching unknown \u201d(in Revue\u201c Synth\u00e8ses \u201d, Brussels). This article is taken up in a work published by Dervy in September 2008 under the title \"Writings on Ouspensky, Gurdjieff and on the Christian Esoteric Tradition\".\n\n=== In France ===\nIn 1924, Boris Mouravieff arrived in [[France]] as a refugee. He first resides in Paris, then settles in [[Bordeaux]]. In 1935, he met Larissa Bassof-Volkoff, born in 1901 in [[Tashkent]], in [[Uzbekistan]]. She is a ballerina and mother of a child from a first marriage, Boris Vsevolod Volkoff, born in 1928 in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine | Neuilly]]. Boris Mouravieff married her in 1936 and all three moved to Paris the same year.\n\nSince 1921, Boris Mouravieff has pursued his research relating to the political and diplomatic history of Russia, and in particular to [[Peter I the Great | Pierre the Great]], which will give rise to the publication of several works.\n\nUntil 1941, he worked as a consulting engineer for various oil companies, while devoting his free time to his historical research, as well as to the esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy.\n\nOn June 11, 1940, Boris Mouravieff left Paris for [[Carry-le-Rouet]] in the South of France, where the firm that employed him had relocated. He then moved to [[Aix-en-Provence]] until July 1943, and finally to [[Haute-Savoie]], [[Neuvecelle]], above [[Evian]]. Refusing to collaborate with the Germans, he was arrested in early 1944 by the [[Gestapo]], interned in [[Annemasse]], then released under surveillance.\n\n=== Switzerland ===\nAt this point resistance fighters of the French Gendarmerie in the department organised his flight and that of his family on March 9, 1944 for [[Switzerland]]. Received as refugees, Boris and Larissa Mouravieff are first assigned to residence in a refugee camp in [[Randa]] in [[Valais]]. At the end of the war, they were allowed to settle in Geneva in an establishment called \"Home for intellectual refugees\", while waiting to occupy an apartment in town.\n\nBoris Mouravieff is 55 years old. He has to start from scratch again. His material situation is precarious: he hardly earns his living by means of lessons and industrial translations.\n\nAs early as April 1945, Boris Mouravieff applied for enrolment as a student at the [[Institute for Advanced International and Development Studies | Institute for Advanced International Studies]] in Geneva. In 1951, he graduated from this institute for his work: \"The Russian-Turkish Alliance in the Middle of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]\".\n\nAround the same time, his wife opened the \"Larissa Mouravieff Classical Dance School\", which she ran for a quarter of a century. At the beginning, Boris Mouravieff participated by accompanying the lessons, on the piano.\n\nDuring this period, he undertook work to formalize the esoteric Christian tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy. He initially planned to present this doctrine in romantic form (unfinished manuscript: \"Initiation - The life and dreams of Boris Kouratov\").\n\n=== Teaching ===\nIn April 1955, Boris Mouravieff becomes [[privat-docent]] at [[University of Geneva]] where he gives two courses until 1961, one concerning the history of Russia before 1917 and the other esoteric philosophy. This last course will be entitled precisely: \"Introduction to esoteric philosophy according to the esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy\". It will regularly bring together between ten and thirty students. The introductory speech of the 1956 academic year on the theme of \"The Problem of the New Man\" will be published by the journal \"Syntheses\". Other articles will follow this first publication.\n\nThe teaching provided at the University of Geneva served as the basis for writing his master work, \"Gn\u00f4sis\", the first volume of which was published in April 1961 by the editions \"La Colombe\" in Paris. The mastery and the clarity of the presentation were recognized and the work obtained the following year the price of esoteric literature [[Victor-\u00c9mile Michelet]]. A rigorous and concrete spirit, Boris Mouravieff presents and comments, through this work, the esoteric tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy in a language that is clear and accessible to a cultivated person of our time.\n\nThat same year, 1961, Boris Mouravieff created the Center for Esoteric Christian Studies (C.E.C.E.), based in Geneva, which he chaired and led until his death. The main goal assigned to the C.E.C.E. was to contribute to the formation of the New Man whom Boris Mouravieff wished for, in a critical historical period - ours - which he qualified as\n\"Transition period\", between a cycle which is ending and a new cycle, carrying promises as much as heavy dangers.\n\nFollowing the publication of volume I of '' Gn\u00f4sis '', Boris Mouravieff receives a voluminous correspondence. He does not just respond to people interested in the education disclosed in \"Gn\u00f4sis\": he encourages the creation of study groups that are emerging in Geneva, Paris, [[Lille]], [[Brussels] ], [[Cairo]], at {{lh | Congo}}, etc. These groups, formed under the aegis of the C.E.C.E., aimed to jointly deepen the doctrine set out in Gn\u00f4sis.\n\nIn 1962, Boris Mouravieff took leave of the University of Geneva to devote himself entirely to the activities of the Center and to the writing of the last two volumes of the trilogy of \"Gn\u00f4sis\". Volume II appeared in 1962, volume III in 1965.\n\nWithin the framework of the C.E.C.E., Boris Mouravieff sees his audience widened to multiple groups whose work he follows, personally responding to the collective or individual questioning of their members. Visits will support the activity of certain groups such as Paris, Lille or Brussels. In the same way, he made a trip to [[Greece]] in July 1964 (A translation of \"Gn\u00f4sis\" in Greek was made following this trip).\n\nTo inform the groups and coordinate their work, \"Information Bulletins\" are periodically published by the C.E.C.E. for members. The development of the activity of the C.E.C.E. was made possible thanks to a patronage which made it possible to have the necessary material means.\n\nThe last years of Boris Mouravieff's life are devoted to this teaching activity. In a perspective of clarification, deepening and practical application, he undertook the writing of a \u201cCollection of Notes on esoteric Christian teaching: The Stromata\u201d, in imitation of [[Clement of Alexandria] ]. With these Stromates, grouped under the general title of \"The Art of Winning\", Boris Mouravieff embarks on a vast and ambitious project. The aim was to supplement the teaching given in \"Gn\u00f4sis\" with practical elements answering the questions that the study of doctrine raised among students. The first chapter appeared in 1966. Two other chapters were published posthumously.\n\n=== Death ===\nThis intense activity has an impact on Boris Mouravieff's state of health. In March 1965, already, a heart attack imposed him a short rest in Cannes. In June 1966, he was struck down by a crisis of rheumatoid arthritis accompanied by severe pain which forced him to live in bed.\n\nBoris Mouravieff died in Geneva of a [[heart attack]] on September 28, 1966, at 8.15 p.m., at the age of 76. He rests at [[Geneva # Saint-Georges | Saint-Georges cemetery]], in Geneva <ref> At N \u00b0 2071, District 3, of the St-Georges Cemetery,\nPlateau de Saint-Georges - 1 avenue du Cimeti\u00e8re, 1213 Petit-Lancy (Geneva). </ref>.\n\nThe C.E.C.E. ceases operations shortly after the death of its founder.\n\n=== Posterity ===\nHis widow, Larissa Mouravieff published chapters 2 and 3 of the first \"Stromate\" in 1968 and 1970. She watches over the archives of the Center and, in 1988, has them deposited at the [[Library of Geneva | Public and University Library of Geneva]] before leaving for [[Canada]] to join her son. Larissa Mouravieff died in [[Montreal]] on September 26, 1989, leaving Boris Vsevolod Volkoff, sole heir of rights. When the latter died, in March 2012, the remaining archives were handed over to the Library of Geneva (BGE, department of manuscripts), where a Mouravieff collection had been set up, which could be consulted by researchers who request it.\n\n==Bibliography==\n'''Political and Diplomatic History (in French)'''\n* ''L\u2019histoire de Russie mal connue'' (\u00e9puis\u00e9).\n* ''Le Testament de Pierre le Grand, l\u00e9gende et r\u00e9alit\u00e9'', \u00e0 la Baconni\u00e8re, Collection \u00ab L\u2019\u00e9volution du monde et des id\u00e9es \u00bb.

He received his first commissions during study trips to [[Rome]] and the [[Veneto]].\n\nIn 1797, during a stay in Bologna, he moved in political circles close to the ideas of the [[French Revolution]].

Thereupon he joined the French [[Arm\u00e9e d'Italie|Italian Army]].\n\nIn 1801 he was employed as [[topographer]] for the [[Cisalpine Republic]], a [[daughter republic]] under [[Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte|Napoleon]] on the territory of Italy, and in 1802 he worked on the fortifications of [[Alessandria]], [[Mantova]], and [[Verona]].\n\nAfterwards he took part in the [[French invasion of Russia]]. He survived and managed to escape to [[Danzig]]. After the [[Battle of Waterloo]] he fell into English captivity, from which he was released in 1816.\n\nNow he initially worked for the Geneva banker [[Jean Gabriel Eynard]], from whom he received a recommendation for King [[Wilhelm I.

Other buildings designed by him are the [[Wilhelmspalais]] and the Alte Reithalle (royal riding hall), both in Stuttgart.\n\nSince the planned costs for the Royal Pavilion in Weil were exceeded, he soon had to have everything approved by the Building and Garden Directorate. In 1828, after a dispute with a superior, he applied for his dismissal. Four days later, however, he asked to be reinstated. In 1839 [[dry rot]] was discovered in Rosenstein Castle, for which Salucci was made responsible; this led to his final dismissal.\n\nIn 1840 Salucci returned to Florence almost penniless.
