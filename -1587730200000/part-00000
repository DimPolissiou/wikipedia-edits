Nadia explains to Bo that the world had been invaded by alien machines wiping out all the major cities and countries along with their respected military forces. After escaping the jail cell, Bo decides to make his way to a U.S. military base somewhere near [[Nairobi]]. Nadia tags along with Bo with little optimism. Bo only recalls fragments of what happened to him while discovering his ability to absorb, conduct, and discharge electricity. Bo and Nadia encounter a fatally wounded photo journalist ([[Jason Flemyng]]). The photo journalist passes on his camera to Bo telling him to follow the photos as a way to the U.S. military base. Along the way, Nadia is abducted by the alien machines forcing Bo to go on alone and injured. He finally makes it to the military base, only to find it in ruins. Collapsing from his wounds, Bo is eventually saved by a group of Nairobi resistance fighters who plan to detonate an EMP bomb near the alien's mother ship in order to bring it down and deactivate the machines. Bo finally recalls his electrical abilities were the result of an enhancement made by one of the alien machines. Bo realizes that he is a beacon for the invaders, in order to find and wipe out any remaining humans.

Many [[Chinese Indonesian]]s came to Peru after anti-Chinese [[May 1998 riots of Indonesia|riot]]s and [[massacre]]s in those countries in the 1960s, 1970s, and late 1990s. These recent Chinese immigrants make Peru currently the home of the largest ethnically Chinese community in [[Latin America]].\n\n===Emigration===\nMany Chinese Peruvians left Peru in the 1960s and 1970s. Most of them headed to the [[United States]], where they were called [[Chinese American]]s or Peruvian Americans of Chinese descent, while others went to [[Canada]], [[Spain]], mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, [[Australia]], or [[New Zealand]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Role in the economy===\nAfter their contracts ended, many of them adopted the last name of their patrons (one of the reasons that many Chinese Peruvians carry Spanish last names). Some freed coolies (and later immigrants) established many small businesses. These included ''chifas'' (Chinese-Peruvian restaurants - the word is derived from Chinese term, {{linktext|lang=zh-Hant|\u5403\u98ef}} ({{zh|j=ci<sup>3</sup>faan<sup>6</sup> |p=ch\u012bf\u00e0n}}) which means \"to eat rice or to have a meal\"). Calle Cap\u00f3n, [[Chinatown, Lima|Lima's Chinatown]], also known as Barrio Chino de Lima, became one of the [[Western Hemisphere]]'s earliest Chinatowns. The Chinese coolies married Peruvian women, and many Chinese Peruvians today are of mixed Chinese, Spanish, African or [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] descent. Chinese Peruvians also assisted in the building of railroad and development of the [[Amazon Rainforest]], where they tapped rubber trees, washed gold, cultivated rice, and traded with the natives. They even became the largest foreign colony in the Amazon capital of [[Iquitos]] by the end of the century.\n\n==Notable people==\nThe vast majority of Chinese descendants in Peru do not carry a Chinese surname, since their ancestors, when they arrived in Peru, were baptized or adopted the surnames of their patrons, Catholic saints or some very common Castilian surname. \n\n=== Politics &

Many [[Chinese Indonesian]]s came to Peru after anti-Chinese [[May 1998 riots of Indonesia|riot]]s and [[massacre]]s in those countries in the 1960s, 1970s, and late 1990s. These recent Chinese immigrants make Peru currently the home of the largest ethnically Chinese community in [[Latin America]].\n\n===Emigration===\nMany Chinese Peruvians left Peru in the 1960s and 1970s. Most of them headed to the [[United States]], where they were called [[Chinese American]]s or Peruvian Americans of Chinese descent, while others went to [[Canada]], [[Spain]], mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, [[Australia]], or [[New Zealand]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Role in the economy===\nAfter their contracts ended, many of them adopted the last name of their patrons (one of the reasons that many Chinese Peruvians carry Spanish last names). Some freed coolies (and later immigrants) established many small businesses. These included ''chifas'' (Chinese-Peruvian restaurants - the word is derived from Chinese term, {{linktext|lang=zh-Hant|\u5403\u98ef}} ({{zh|j=ci<sup>3</sup>faan<sup>6</sup> |p=ch\u012bf\u00e0n}}) which means \"to eat rice or to have a meal\"). Calle Cap\u00f3n, [[Chinatown, Lima|Lima's Chinatown]], also known as Barrio Chino de Lima, became one of the [[Western Hemisphere]]'s earliest Chinatowns. The Chinese coolies married Peruvian women, and many Chinese Peruvians today are of mixed Chinese, Spanish, African or [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] descent. Chinese Peruvians also assisted in the building of railroad and development of the [[Amazon Rainforest]], where they tapped rubber trees, washed gold, cultivated rice, and traded with the natives. They even became the largest foreign colony in the Amazon capital of [[Iquitos]] by the end of the century.\n\n==Notable people==\nThe vast majority of Chinese descendants in Peru do not carry a Chinese surname, since their ancestors, when they arrived in Peru, were baptized or adopted the surnames of their patrons, Catholic saints or some very common Castilian surname. \n\n=== Politics &

His career at the Council began under President [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani|Hashemi Rafsanjani]] and continued under his successor, President [[Mohammad Khatami|Khatami]].

That period began with international revelations about Iran's nuclear energy program and adoption of a strongly worded resolution by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA). In June 2004, the board of governors of the IAEA issued a statement which was followed by a resolution in September of the same year, which focused on Iran's nuclear case with the goal of imposing difficult commitments on Iran. That development was concurrent with the victory of the United States in Iraq war and escalation of war rhetoric in the region.

The team was delegated with special powers in order to formulate a comprehensive plan for Iran's interactions with the IAEA and coordination among various concerned organizations inside the country.

His leading role in the nuclear negotiations which brought him the nickname of \"Diplomat Sheikh\", first given to him by the nascent ''[[Sharq (newspaper)|Sharq]]'' newspaper in November 2003 and was frequently repeated after that by domestic and foreign Persian-speaking media. His career at the Council began under President [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani|Hashemi Rafsanjani]] and continued under his successor, President [[Mohammad Khatami|Khatami]].

That period began with international revelations about Iran's nuclear energy program and adoption of a strongly worded resolution by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA). In June 2004, the board of governors of the IAEA issued a statement which was followed by a resolution in September of the same year, which focused on Iran's nuclear case with the goal of imposing difficult commitments on Iran. That development was concurrent with the victory of the United States in Iraq war and escalation of war rhetoric in the region.

The team was delegated with special powers in order to formulate a comprehensive plan for Iran's interactions with the IAEA and coordination among various concerned organizations inside the country.
