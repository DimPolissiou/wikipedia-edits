In high school, the two boys and two girls that were his four best friends all had a color as part of their surnames, leaving him the \"colorless\" one of their \"orderly, harmonious community\". But one day in 1995, during his second year in college, his friends abruptly cut all relationships with him. That never-explained, Kafkaesque ostracism left him feeling suicidal then guilty \"as an empty person, lacking in color and identity\"; and when his only college friend vanished the next semester, he felt \"fated to always be alone\".\n\nNow in 2011's [[Tokyo]], the 36-year-old engineer Tazaki works for a railroad company and builds stations. His new girlfriend Sara spurs him \"to come face-to-face with the past, not as some naive, easily wounded boy, but as a grown-up\" and seek his former friends to mend the relationships and find out why they rejected him, because she won't commit to him unless he can move past that issue. And so he will visit them one by one, first back in Nagoya, then in rural [[Finland]], on a quest for truth and a pilgrimage for happiness.\n\n===Characters===\nMain characters:\n\n; Tsukuru Tazaki\n: {{nihongo|Tsukuru Tazaki|\u591a\u5d0e&emsp;\u3064\u304f\u308b (written \u591a\u5d0e&emsp;\u4f5c in the family register)|Tazaki Tsukuru}} The protagonist, his given name is a homophone for \"To make or build\" and his family name doesn't contain any color symbol.

In the 1960s, he took a leave of absence from school to travel Japan and worked odd jobs. While being employed as handyman at a small hot-springs inn, he met Midorikawa, whose strange tale he later told his son.\n\n; Midorikawa\n: {{nihongo|Midorikawa|\u7dd1\u5ddd}} A jazz pianist from Tokyo, his family name means \"Green River\".

The oldest one was named Yuzu in memory of Eri's deceased friend.\n\n===Plot summary===\n<!-- FACTUAL SUMMARY with spoilers and details\n    (present tense for main story, past tense for youth, as in the novel)\n-->\n; Chapters 1\u20133\nTsukuru Tazaki is a 36-year-old man whose defining features are his love of train stations and the fact his four best friends all ceased to speak to him during his second year at university: \"Like Jonah in the belly of the whale, Tsukuru had fallen into the bowels of death, one untold day after another, lost in a dark, stagnant void.\" He now lives in Tokyo and has started seeing a new girlfriend, Sara Kimoto, who works at a travel agency. As he explains to her over dinner, back in Nagoya his high-school friends were called Ao, Aka, Shiro, and Kuro (Japanese for: Blue, Red, White, and Black), nicknamed after a color in their surname, unlike his \"colorless\" one. They used to do everything together like the five digits of a hand, until that single phone call one day, when they \"announced that they did not want to see him, or talk with him, ever again. It was a sudden, decisive declaration, with no room for compromise. They gave no explanation, not a word, for this harsh pronouncement. And Tsukuru didn't dare ask.\"\n\n; Chapter 4\nAfter he overcame that loss and suicidal impulses (\"Perhaps he didn't commit suicide then because he couldn't conceive of a method that fit the pure and intense feelings he had towards death.\"), Tsukuru befriended Haida (whose name contains \"Gray\") at university. They started doing everything together, and listened to classical music such as [[Franz Liszt]]'s ''[[Ann\u00e9es de p\u00e8lerinage]]'': \"Most people see Liszt's piano music as more superficial, and technical. Of course, he has some tricky pieces, but if you listen very carefully [...] you discover a depth to it you don't notice at first. Most of the time it's hidden behind all these embellishments.\"\n\n; Chapter 5\nOne evening, Haida told him a strange story about his father: when he was a college student, he took a leave from his studies and worked in a secluded hot-springs inn where he met man who called himself Midorikawa (whose name contains \"Green\"), a jazz pianist from Tokyo who was incredibly talented: \"His playing had the power to physically and viscerally move the listener, to transport you to another world.\" One evening,<!--(Repeating the summary's first sentence, to underline the echo as underlined in the novel.)--> Midorikawa told him a strange story about himself: one month ago, he had willingly accepted a \"death token\" condemning him to die two months later unless he could pass it on to another volunteer, but despite his talent he was tired of his life : this near-death experience had opened for him \"the doors of perception\", making his last weeks more wonderful than the decades he was giving up, and it also made him able to see the color aura of people. During these tales, Tsukuru sometimes felt a sort of confusion between himself, Haida, his father, and Midorikawa.\n\n; Chapter 6\nLater that night, while Haida slept over on his couch, Tsukuru had a strange erotic dream involving both Shiro and Kuro, who then merged and morphed into Haida before the climax. Tsukuru wondered for himself whether it was all a dream, then Haida didn't show up for next semester. All he left behind was the boxed set of ''Years of Pilgrimage'' he had lent Tsukuru.\n\n; Chapters 7\u20139\nSara states that if he wants to progress in his current relationship, he needs to find out what happened to move on emotionally. Since Tsukuru doesn't use the Internet, she'll help him getting started: \"We live in a pretty apathetic age, yet we're surrounded by an enormous amount of information about other people. If you feel like it, you can easily gather that information about them. Having said that, we still hardly know anything about people.\" After using Google and Facebook to locate these former friends, she updates Tsukuru on their current whereabouts and even arranges for his travel tickets.\n\n; Chapter 10\nTsukuru travels to his home town of Nagoya and meets Ao, the former football jock who is now a successful Lexus dealer. From an apologetic Ao, he learns that Shiro had accused Tsukuru of rape, prompting all communications between the friends to cease. Shiro eventually became a successful piano teacher, but six years ago she was found strangled in an unsolved murder case.\n\n; Chapter 11\nSeveral days later, Tsukuru arranges to meet Aka, now a trainer of corporate warriors. A successful but deeply unhappy man, Aka tells him that Shiro's story did not stack up at the time, and that Shiro seemed to have lost her love for life long before she died. Aka himself has issues, having belatedly realized after a failed marriage that he is gay, and feeling rejection from the people of Nagoya, including Ao, who dislike his somewhat shady business, taking up some psychological methods used by the Nazis. Tsukuru reassures Aka that he still cares for him and departs.\n\n; Chapters 12\u201313\nBack at work in Tokyo, Tsukuru and his colleague Sakamoto visit a stationmaster whose strange tale reminds him of Haida's story. After discussing his findings with Sara over dinner, Tsukuru decides he has to know the rest of the story. To do so he must visit the only other surviving member of the friendship group, Kuro, who now lives in Finland with two daughters. While preparing for the visit, Tsukuru goes to buy presents for Kuro's children and sees Sara hand in hand with a middle-aged man, smiling in a way she never did with Tsukuru.\n\n; Chapters 14\u201315\nFilled not with jealousy but with sadness, Tsukuru flies to Finland. In Helsinki, he enlists Sara's friend Olga to help him track down Kuro for an unannounced visit. The next day he drives to H\u00e4meenlinna, the rural town where she has her holiday cottage. He first meets her husband, the Finnish potter Edvard Haatainen. When she arrives with her daughters, Edvard takes the latter to do some shopping.\n\n; Chapters 16\u201317\nTsukuru stays alone with Kuro, now a successful pottery artist. Eri prefers to dispense with nicknames and explains that Yuzu was mentally ill. The rape accusation was a fabrication, but he was cut off as a way of not frontally contradicting Yuzu to enable her to deal with her problems. Eri reveals that she was in love with Tsukuru, which could have played a role in the accusation, but also that Yuzu was actually raped and had a miscarriage, then developed anorexia as a way of never being pregnant again. Eri told him nothing, maybe because he never noticed her love, but mostly to prevent a confrontation with Yuzu. Tsukuru was sacrificed to protect Yuzu because the group believed he was the strongest emotionally and could deal with the ban. These redemptive revelations give the lie to Tsukuru's own perception of himself as plain and colorless.\n\n; Chapters 18\u201319\nTsukuru returns to Japan a wiser man. He wonders whether Yuzu had turned against him, as he was the one who first left the group of five friends, as a preemptive strike because she could not bear the thought that its members would inevitably drift apart anyway. Against Kuro's advice, he decides to press Sara on whether she is seeing someone else. Sara says she will need three days to reply. After a late-night confession of love by phone-call, the novel ends with Tsukuru still waiting.\n\n==Editions==\n;English first editions<ref>http://www.randomhouse.com/book/235276/colorless-tsukuru-tazaki-and-his-years-of-pilgrimage-by-haruki-murakami</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/editions/colorless-tsukuru-tazaki-and-his-years-of-pilgrimage/9781846558337 |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202101157/http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/editions/colorless-tsukuru-tazaki-and-his-years-of-pilgrimage/9781846558337 |archive-date=2 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.randomhouse.ca/books/235276/colorless-tsukuru-tazaki-and-his-years-of-pilgrimage-by-haruki-murakami |title=Archived copy |access-date=11 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812224812/http://www.randomhouse.ca/books/235276/colorless-tsukuru-tazaki-and-his-years-of-pilgrimage-by-haruki-murakami |archive-date=12 August 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nPrint:\n* US hardcover (12 August 2014), 386 pages (of 400), [[Alfred A.

In high school, the two boys and two girls that were his four best friends all had a color as part of their surnames, leaving him the \"colorless\" one of their \"orderly, harmonious community\". But one day in 1995, during his second year in college, his friends abruptly cut all relationships with him. That never-explained, Kafkaesque ostracism left him feeling suicidal then guilty \"as an empty person, lacking in color and identity\"; and when his only college friend vanished the next semester, he felt \"fated to always be alone\".\n\nNow in 2011's [[Tokyo]], the 36-year-old engineer Tazaki works for a railroad company and builds stations. His new girlfriend Sara spurs him \"to come face-to-face with the past, not as some naive, easily wounded boy, but as a grown-up\" and seek his former friends to mend the relationships and find out why they rejected him, because she won't commit to him unless he can move past that issue. And so he will visit them one by one, first back in Nagoya, then in rural [[Finland]], on a quest for truth and a pilgrimage for happiness.\n\n===Characters===\nMain characters:\n\n; Tsukuru Tazaki\n: {{nihongo|Tsukuru Tazaki|\u591a\u5d0e&emsp;\u3064\u304f\u308b (written \u591a\u5d0e&emsp;\u4f5c in the family register)|Tazaki Tsukuru}} The protagonist, his given name is a homophone for \"To make or build\" and his family name doesn't contain any color symbol.

As he explains to her over dinner, back in Nagoya his high-school friends were called Ao, Aka, Shiro, and Kuro (Japanese for: Blue, Red, White, and Black), nicknamed after a color in their surname, unlike his \"colorless\" one. They used to do everything together like the five digits of a hand, until that single phone call one day, when they \"announced that they did not want to see him, or talk with him, ever again. It was a sudden, decisive declaration, with no room for compromise. They gave no explanation, not a word, for this harsh pronouncement. And Tsukuru didn't dare ask.\"\n\n; Chapter 4\nAfter he overcame that loss and suicidal impulses (\"Perhaps he didn't commit suicide then because he couldn't conceive of a method that fit the pure and intense feelings he had towards death.\"), Tsukuru befriended Haida (whose name contains \"Gray\") at university. They started doing everything together, and listened to classical music such as [[Franz Liszt]]'s ''[[Ann\u00e9es de p\u00e8lerinage]]'': \"Most people see Liszt's piano music as more superficial, and technical. Of course, he has some tricky pieces, but if you listen very carefully [...] you discover a depth to it you don't notice at first. Most of the time it's hidden behind all these embellishments.\"\n\n; Chapter 5\nOne evening, Haida told him a strange story about his father: when he was a college student, he took a leave from his studies and worked in a secluded hot-springs inn where he met man who called himself Midorikawa (whose name contains \"Green\"), a jazz pianist from Tokyo who was incredibly talented: \"His playing had the power to physically and viscerally move the listener, to transport you to another world.\" One evening,<!--(Repeating the summary's first sentence, to underline the echo as underlined in the novel.)--> Midorikawa told him a strange story about himself: one month ago, he had willingly accepted a \"death token\" condemning him to die two months later unless he could pass it on to another volunteer, but despite his talent he was tired of his life : this near-death experience had opened for him \"the doors of perception\", making his last weeks more wonderful than the decades he was giving up, and it also made him able to see the color aura of people. During these tales, Tsukuru sometimes felt a sort of confusion between himself, Haida, his father, and Midorikawa.\n\n; Chapter 6\nLater that night, while Haida slept over on his couch, Tsukuru had a strange erotic dream involving both Shiro and Kuro, who then merged and morphed into Haida before the climax. Tsukuru wondered for himself whether it was all a dream, then Haida didn't show up for next semester. All he left behind was the boxed set of ''Years of Pilgrimage'' he had lent Tsukuru.\n\n; Chapters 7\u20139\nSara states that if he wants to progress in his current relationship, he needs to find out what happened to move on emotionally. Since Tsukuru doesn't use the Internet, she'll help him getting started: \"We live in a pretty apathetic age, yet we're surrounded by an enormous amount of information about other people. If you feel like it, you can easily gather that information about them. Having said that, we still hardly know anything about people.\" After using Google and Facebook to locate these former friends, she updates Tsukuru on their current whereabouts and even arranges for his travel tickets.\n\n; Chapter 10\nTsukuru travels to his home town of Nagoya and meets Ao, the former football jock who is now a successful Lexus dealer. From an apologetic Ao, he learns that Shiro had accused Tsukuru of rape, prompting all communications between the friends to cease. Shiro eventually became a successful piano teacher, but six years ago she was found strangled in an unsolved murder case.\n\n; Chapter 11\nSeveral days later, Tsukuru arranges to meet Aka, now a trainer of corporate warriors. A successful but deeply unhappy man, Aka tells him that Shiro's story did not stack up at the time, and that Shiro seemed to have lost her love for life long before she died. Aka himself has issues, having belatedly realized after a failed marriage that he is gay, and feeling rejection from the people of Nagoya, including Ao, who dislike his somewhat shady business, taking up some psychological methods used by the Nazis. Tsukuru reassures Aka that he still cares for him and departs.\n\n; Chapters 12\u201313\nBack at work in Tokyo, Tsukuru and his colleague Sakamoto visit a stationmaster whose strange tale reminds him of Haida's story. After discussing his findings with Sara over dinner, Tsukuru decides he has to know the rest of the story. To do so he must visit the only other surviving member of the friendship group, Kuro, who now lives in Finland with two daughters. While preparing for the visit, Tsukuru goes to buy presents for Kuro's children and sees Sara hand in hand with a middle-aged man, smiling in a way she never did with Tsukuru.\n\n; Chapters 14\u201315\nFilled not with jealousy but with sadness, Tsukuru flies to Finland. In Helsinki, he enlists Sara's friend Olga to help him track down Kuro for an unannounced visit. The next day he drives to H\u00e4meenlinna, the rural town where she has her holiday cottage. He first meets her husband, the Finnish potter Edvard Haatainen. When she arrives with her daughters, Edvard takes the latter to do some shopping.\n\n; Chapters 16\u201317\nTsukuru stays alone with Kuro, now a successful pottery artist. Eri prefers to dispense with nicknames and explains that Yuzu was mentally ill. The rape accusation was a fabrication, but he was cut off as a way of not frontally contradicting Yuzu to enable her to deal with her problems. Eri reveals that she was in love with Tsukuru, which could have played a role in the accusation, but also that Yuzu was actually raped and had a miscarriage, then developed anorexia as a way of never being pregnant again. Eri told him nothing, maybe because he never noticed her love, but mostly to prevent a confrontation with Yuzu. Tsukuru was sacrificed to protect Yuzu because the group believed he was the strongest emotionally and could deal with the ban. These redemptive revelations give the lie to Tsukuru's own perception of himself as plain and colorless.\n\n; Chapters 18\u201319\nTsukuru returns to Japan a wiser man. He wonders whether Yuzu had turned against him, as he was the one who first left the group of five friends, as a preemptive strike because she could not bear the thought that its members would inevitably drift apart anyway. Against Kuro's advice, he decides to press Sara on whether she is seeing someone else. Sara says she will need three days to reply. After a late-night confession of love by phone-call, the novel ends with Tsukuru still waiting.\n\n==Editions==\n;English first editions<ref>http://www.randomhouse.com/book/235276/colorless-tsukuru-tazaki-and-his-years-of-pilgrimage-by-haruki-murakami</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/editions/colorless-tsukuru-tazaki-and-his-years-of-pilgrimage/9781846558337 |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202101157/http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/editions/colorless-tsukuru-tazaki-and-his-years-of-pilgrimage/9781846558337 |archive-date=2 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.randomhouse.ca/books/235276/colorless-tsukuru-tazaki-and-his-years-of-pilgrimage-by-haruki-murakami |title=Archived copy |access-date=11 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812224812/http://www.randomhouse.ca/books/235276/colorless-tsukuru-tazaki-and-his-years-of-pilgrimage-by-haruki-murakami |archive-date=12 August 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nPrint:\n* US hardcover (12 August 2014), 386 pages (of 400), [[Alfred A.

He is currently the manager of [[CFR Cluj]].\n\nPetrescu is best known for playing in the [[1988\u201389 European Cup|1989 European Cup final]] with [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucharest]] and winning the [[1997\u201398 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1998 with English club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. He earned 95 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] for the [[Romania national football team|Romania national team]], and played for his country in two [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]s, in [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]] and [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]], as well as two [[UEFA European Championships|European Championships]], in [[UEFA Euro 1996|1996]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000|2000]].\n\nTowards the end of his playing career he became an assistant to [[Walter Zenga]] at [[FC Progresul Bucure\u0219ti|Na\u021bional Bucharest]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=28624.html|title=Na\u021bional unveil Zenga|work=UEFA|date=23 July 2002|accessdate=12 January 2010}}</ref> His first manager role was at [[Sportul Studen\u021besc]], whom he led to promotion to the [[Liga I]].\n\nOn 10 June 2017, he was appointed manager of [[CFR Cluj]] and won the [[Liga I]] title in his first season at the club.\n\n==Playing career==\n===Club===\nAfter playing for [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]]'s youth teams, Petrescu was promoted into the first team in 1986 in a match played by Steaua just one month after winning the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]. He was loaned to [[FC Olt Scornice\u0219ti|Olt Scornice\u0219ti]] for the 1986\u201387 season, but asked to return to Steaua in 1987.\n\nPetrescu was part of the Steaua squad that reached the European Cup semi-finals ([[1987\u201388 European Cup|1988]]) and the final ([[1988\u201389 European Cup|1989]]).\n\nIn 1991, Petrescu was bought by Italian club [[U.S. Foggia|Foggia]] in a period when the club saw promotion to [[Serie A]]. In 1993, he moved to [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]].\n\nPetrescu signed for [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in 1994 from Genoa, after a successful [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] for Romania. After one season at [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]], he signed for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and featured prominently there for the next five years. During his term at Chelsea, he was a member of the teams which won the [[FA Cup]] in [[1997 FA Cup Final|1997]] and the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] and [[Cup Winners' Cup]] (both in 1998).

His last match was the [[Cupa Rom\u00e2niei]] final, on 31 May 2003; Na\u021bional lost 1\u20130 to [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]], during which Petrescu received much abuse from some of the Dinamo fans as he left the pitch at the end of 90 minutes, even though it was the last game of one of Romania's greatest footballers. Presumably, this was because he used to play for Dinamo's greatest rivals, Steaua.\n\n===International===\nPetrescu registered 95 caps for the senior [[Romania national football team|Romania national team]]. He made his debut in 1989 and played at four major tournaments: the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], [[UEFA Euro 1996]], the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] (where the entire Romania squad famously dyed their hair blonde after losing a bet with head coach [[Anghel Iord\u0103nescu]]), and [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]].\n\nPetrescu missed the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] due to injury. In 1994, Petrescu played in his first [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], held in the United States. He scored the only goal in a win against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] which saw Romania qualify for the second round as group winners. They were then handed a difficult game against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] which they managed to win, only to lose to [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] on penalties in the quarter-finals, with Petrescu one of two Romanians to miss his [[Penalty kick (association football)|spot-kick]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-07-11/sports/sp-14234_1_penalty-kick|title=World Cup USA '94 / Quarterfinals : Sweden's Best Shot Puts Romania Out|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=11 July 1994|accessdate=24 April 2010}}</ref> The miss still haunts him today. \"It will probably stay with me for the rest of my life\", he said.

He became the second Romanian player to score in two different World Cups after [[Stefan Dobay]]. The Romanians, however, lost their second round match to [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], 1\u20130.\n\nPetrescu was an important piece of the Romanian team at Euro 2000, where they survived a group with [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], [[Germany national football team|Germany]] and England.

football|football]] manager and former professional footballer who played as a [[Full back (association football)|full back]] or a [[Winger (association football)|winger]]. He is currently the manager of [[CFR Cluj]].\n\nPetrescu is best known for playing in the [[1988\u201389 European Cup|1989 European Cup final]] with [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucharest]] and winning the [[1997\u201398 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1998 with English club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. He earned 95 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] for the [[Romania national football team|Romania national team]], and played for his country in two [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]s, in [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]] and [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]], as well as two [[UEFA European Championships|European Championships]], in [[UEFA Euro 1996|1996]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000|2000]].\n\nTowards the end of his playing career he became an assistant to [[Walter Zenga]] at [[FC Progresul Bucure\u0219ti|Na\u021bional Bucharest]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=28624.html|title=Na\u021bional unveil Zenga|work=UEFA|date=23 July 2002|accessdate=12 January 2010}}</ref> His first manager role was at [[Sportul Studen\u021besc]], whom he led to promotion to the [[Liga I]].\n\nOn 10 June 2017, he was appointed manager of [[CFR Cluj]] and won the [[Liga I]] title in his first season at the club.\n\n==Playing career==\n===Club===\nAfter playing for [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]]'s youth teams, Petrescu was promoted into the first team in 1986 in a match played by Steaua just one month after winning the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]. He was loaned to [[FC Olt Scornice\u0219ti|Olt Scornice\u0219ti]] for the 1986\u201387 season, but asked to return to Steaua in 1987.\n\nPetrescu was part of the Steaua squad that reached the European Cup semi-finals ([[1987\u201388 European Cup|1988]]) and the final ([[1988\u201389 European Cup|1989]]).\n\nIn 1991, Petrescu was bought by Italian club [[U.S. Foggia|Foggia]] in a period when the club saw promotion to [[Serie A]]. In 1993, he moved to [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]].\n\nPetrescu signed for [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in 1994 from Genoa, after a successful [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] for Romania. After one season at [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]], he signed for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and featured prominently there for the next five years. During his term at Chelsea, he was a member of the teams which won the [[FA Cup]] in [[1997 FA Cup Final|1997]] and the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] and [[Cup Winners' Cup]] (both in 1998).

His last match was the [[Cupa Rom\u00e2niei]] final, on 31 May 2003; Na\u021bional lost 1\u20130 to [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]], during which Petrescu received much abuse from some of the Dinamo fans as he left the pitch at the end of 90 minutes, even though it was the last game of one of Romania's greatest footballers. Presumably, this was because he used to play for Dinamo's greatest rivals, Steaua.\n\n===International===\nPetrescu registered 95 caps for the senior [[Romania national football team|Romania national team]]. He made his debut in 1989 and played at four major tournaments: the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], [[UEFA Euro 1996]], the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] (where the entire Romania squad famously dyed their hair blonde after losing a bet with head coach [[Anghel Iord\u0103nescu]]), and [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]].\n\nPetrescu missed the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] due to injury. In 1994, Petrescu played in his first [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], held in the United States. He scored the only goal in a win against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] which saw Romania qualify for the second round as group winners. They were then handed a difficult game against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] which they managed to win, only to lose to [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] on penalties in the quarter-finals, with Petrescu one of two Romanians to miss his [[Penalty kick (association football)|spot-kick]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-07-11/sports/sp-14234_1_penalty-kick|title=World Cup USA '94 / Quarterfinals : Sweden's Best Shot Puts Romania Out|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=11 July 1994|accessdate=24 April 2010}}</ref> The miss still haunts him today. \"It will probably stay with me for the rest of my life\", he said.

He became the second Romanian player to score in two different World Cups after [[Stefan Dobay]]. The Romanians, however, lost their second round match to [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], 1\u20130.\n\nPetrescu was an important piece of the Romanian team at Euro 2000, where they survived a group with [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], [[Germany national football team|Germany]] and England. A new victory over the English team was decisive to qualify for quarter-finals. Romania won all the matches where Petrescu scored.\n\n==Managerial career==\nAfter retiring in 2003, Petrescu pursued a career as a coach. He began his managerial career in July 2003 with second division side [[FC Sportul Studen\u021besc Bucure\u0219ti|Sportul Studen\u021besc]], whom he led to [[2003\u201304 Divizia B|promotion]] before taking over at [[FC Rapid Bucure\u0219ti|Rapid Bucharest]] in December, but stepped down in April 2004, after only six games and four months at the helm.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=167954.html|title=Rapid departure for Petrescu|work=UEFA|date=14 April 2004|accessdate=26 May 2010}}</ref> He then returned for a second spell at Sportul Studen\u021besc, where he helped the club to a seventh-place finish in [[2004\u201305 Divizia A|Diviza A]].\n\n===Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w===\nIn December 2005, Petrescu agreed to manage [[2004\u201305 Ekstraklasa]] champions [[Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w]] in Poland, replacing caretaker manager [[Tomasz Kulawik]]. Wis\u0142a finished second in the [[2005\u201306 Ekstraklasa|2005\u201306 championship]]. He was dismissed as manager of Wis\u0142a on 18 September 2006 after unconvincing results to begin the 2006\u201307 season. Petrescu accused the Wis\u0142a players for not wanting to train hard to improve their performances.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.psnfutbol.com/2006/09/19/petrescu-forced-out-at-wisa/|title=Petrescu forced out at Wis\u0142a|work=Polish Sports Network|date=19 September 2006|accessdate=28 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Unirea Urziceni===\n[[File:Dan Petrescu.jpg|thumb|left|110px|Petrescu in 2008]]\nAbout one week after his termination, Petrescu was appointed as manager of Romanian [[Liga I]] newly promoted club [[FC Unirea Urziceni|Unirea Urziceni]], with which he had considerable leading. Under his management, Unirea Urziceni was runner-up in the [[2007\u201308 Cupa Rom\u00e2niei]] and qualified for the [[2008\u201309 UEFA Cup]]. He was considered for the vacant manager's position at his former club Steaua Bucure\u0219ti after [[Marius L\u0103c\u0103tu\u0219]]' resignation in October 2008. [[Dorinel Munteanu]] was appointed instead, but Petrescu has not ruled out a future role at the club. In May 2009, Petrescu won the Liga I title with outsiders Unirea Urziceni, the first title for both Petrescu and his club, and consequently achieving qualification to the [[2009\u201310 UEFA Champions League]], during which he led Unirea to a shock 4\u20131 victory at Ibrox against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and a win against [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] at home, 1\u20130.\n\nPetrescu resigned as manager of Unirea Urziceni in December 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://de.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=939240.html|title=Petrescu steps down at Unirea|work=[[UEFA]]|date=28 December 2009|accessdate=16 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Kuban Krasnodar===\n[[File:Dan Vasile Petrescu.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|Petrescu with [[FC Kuban Krasnodar|Kuban Krasnodar]] in 2011]]\n[[File:Dan Petrescu 2012.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Petrescu as Dynamo Moscow manager in 2012]]\nOn 28 December 2009, [[Russian First Division]] club [[FC Kuban Krasnodar|Kuban Krasnodar]] hired Petrescu on a five-year contract.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-45062220091230|title=Petrescu named coach of Russian club Kuban|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=30 December 2009|accessdate=12 July 2012}}</ref> Petrescu managed to gain promotion to the [[Russian Premier League]] in his debut season, winning the [[2010 Russian First Division]] with a total of 80 points, nine clear of second place.

Active in both the [[Netherlands]] and Hollywood, Verhoeven's blending of graphic violence and sexual content with social satire are trademarks of both his [[Drama film|drama]] and [[science fiction film]]s. He directed the films ''[[Turkish Delight (1973 film)|Turkish Delight]]'' (1973), ''[[Soldier of Orange]]'' (1977), ''[[The Fourth Man (1983 film)|The Fourth Man]]'' (1983), ''[[Flesh and Blood (1985 film)|Flesh and Blood]]'' (1985), ''[[RoboCop]]'' (1987), ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990), ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992), ''[[Showgirls]]'' (1995), ''[[Starship Troopers (film)|Starship Troopers]]'' (1997), [[Hollow Man]] (2000), ''[[Black Book (film)|Black Book]]'' (2006) and ''[[Elle (film)|Elle]]'' (2016).\n\n''Turkish Delight'' received the award for Best Dutch Film of the Century at the [[Netherlands Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.filmfestival.nl/publiek/films/turks-fruit |title=Turks fruit |work=[[Netherlands Film Festival]] |accessdate=3 February 2017 |language=Dutch}}</ref> His films altogether received a total of nine [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, mainly for editing and effects. Verhoeven won the [[Saturn Award for Best Director]] for ''RoboCop''. His Dutch war film ''[[Black Book (film)|Black Book]]'' (2006) was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language]] and was voted by the Dutch public, in 2008, as the best Dutch film ever made.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cinema.nl/artikelen/4084816/zwartboek-beste-film-aller-tijden |title=Zwartboek beste film aller tijden |trans-title=Black Book: best film of all time |language=Dutch |work=Cinema.nl |date=3 October 2008 |accessdate=25 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720164057/http://www.cinema.nl/artikelen/4084816/zwartboek-beste-film-aller-tijden |archivedate=20 July 2011}}</ref> In contrast, he won the [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for ''Showgirls''; he is one of the few people to have [[List of people who have accepted Golden Raspberry Awards|accepted their Golden Raspberry awards]] in person, and was the first person to go to the ceremony to receive it. In 2016 he directed ''[[Elle (film)|Elle]]'', which won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].\n\n''[[The Seattle Times]]'' praised Verhoeven by saying, \"director Paul Verhoeven often appears to be a one-man Dutch movie industry,\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Hartl |first=John |title='The Fourth Man' is occult thriller that holds suspense |newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=7 June 1985 |page=22}}</ref> while ''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' called Verhoeven \"a busy bee whose movies pollinate the festival circuit.\"<ref>{{cite news |last= Elliott |first= David |title='The Fourth Man' is half-baked film |newspaper=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |date=20 July 1984 }}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nPaul Verhoeven was born in [[Amsterdam]] on 18 July 1938, the son of a [[Teacher|school teacher]], Wim Verhoeven, and a [[Hatmaking|hat maker]], Nel van Schaardenburg. His family lived in the village of [[Slikkerveer]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn 1943 the family moved to [[The Hague]], the location of the German headquarters in the Netherlands during [[World War II]]. The Verhoeven house was near a German military base with [[V-weapons|V1 and V2-rocket launchers]], which was repeatedly bombed by Allied forces. Their neighbours' house was hit and Verhoeven's parents were almost killed when bombs fell on a street crossing. From this period, Verhoeven mentioned in interviews, he remembers images of violence, burning houses, dead bodies on the street, and continuous danger. As a small child he experienced the war as an exciting adventure and compares himself with the character Bill Rowan in ''[[Hope and Glory (film)|Hope and Glory]]'' (1987).<ref name=\"oorlog\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ethesis.net/verhoeven/verhoeven_deel_1.htm|title=Een beetje oorlog, best spannend|trans-title=A little war, quite exciting|work=De cinema van Paul Verhoeven: voorbij de controverse|first=Rob |last=Testelmans|year=2003|accessdate=17 October 2006|language=Dutch}}</ref>\n\nVerhoeven's father became head teacher at the [[Van Heutszschool]] in The Hague, and Paul attended this school. Sometimes they watched informative films at home with the school's [[Movie projector|film projector]]. Verhoeven and his father also liked to see American films that were in the cinema after the liberation, such as ''[[The Crimson Pirate]]'' (1952).{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThey went ten times to see ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]'' (1953). Verhoeven was a fan of the Dutch comic ''[[Dick Bos]]'' ([[:nl:Dick Bos|nl]]). The character Dick Bos is a private detective who fights crime using [[jujutsu]]. Verhoeven liked comic drawing; he created ''The Killer'', a character in a detailed story of revenge. Other fiction he liked were ''[[Frankenstein]]'' and the [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] [[Barsoom]] series.<ref name=\"oorlog\"/>\n\nVerhoeven attended public secondary school [[Gymnasium Haganum]] in The Hague. Later, beginning in 1955, he studied at [[Leiden University]], where he joined the elite fraternity ''Minerva''. Verhoeven graduated with a [[doctorandus]] (MSc) with a double major, in [[Mathematics]] and [[Physics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paulverhoeven.net/index2.asp|title=What's new?|work=paulverhoeven.net|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220013620/http://www.paulverhoeven.net/index2.asp|archivedate=20 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wiskundemeisjes.nl/20060913/paul-verhoeven|title=Paul Verhoeven profile|work=Wiskundemeisjes.nl|accessdate=3 February 2017|language=Dutch}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Short films and TV series (1960\u20131969)===\nVerhoeven made his first film ''A Lizzard Too Much'' for the anniversary of his [[Student Corps|students' corps]] in 1960.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gonemovies.com/WWW/TopFilms/Verhoeven/RegiseurVerhoeven.asp |title=Paul Verhoeven: Biography |work=gonemovies.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129125642/http://www.gonemovies.com/WWW/TopFilms/Verhoeven/RegiseurVerhoeven.asp |archivedate=29 January 2007 |accessdate=3 February 2017 |language=Dutch}}</ref> In his last years at university Verhoeven also attended classes at the [[Netherlands Film and Television Academy|Netherlands Film Academy]]. After this he made three more short films: ''Nothing Special'' (1961), ''The Hitchhikers'' (1962), and ''Let's Have a Party'' (1963).\n\nVerhoeven has not used his mathematics and physics degree, opting instead to invest his energies in a career in film. After his studies he entered the [[Royal Dutch Navy]] as a conscript. He made the documentary ''Het Korps Mariniers'' (\"''The Marine Corps''\", 1965), which won the French ''Golden Sun'' award for military films.<ref name=\"oorlog\"/>\n\nIn 1967 Verhoeven married Martine Tours, with whom he later had two daughters, Claudia (b. 1972), and Helen (b. 1974).\n\nWhen he left the Navy, Verhoeven took his skills to Dutch television. First, he made a documentary about [[Anton Mussert]] named ''Mussert'' (1968). His first major success was the 1969 ''[[Floris (TV series)|Floris]]'' television series, starring [[Rutger Hauer]]. The concept of ''Floris'' was inspired by foreign series like ''[[Ivanhoe]]'' and ''[[Thierry La Fronde]]''.\n\n===First feature films (1969\u20131983)===\nVerhoeven's first feature film ''[[Business Is Business (film)|Business Is Business]]'' was released in 1971 and was not well received. His first national success came in 1973 with ''[[Turkish Delight (1973 film)|Turkish Delight]]'', starring Rutger Hauer and [[Monique van de Ven]]. This film is based on a novel by bestselling Dutch author [[Jan Wolkers]] and tells the passionate love story of an artist and a young liberal girl from a conservative background. The film received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] in 1974. In 1999 the film won a [[Golden Calf (award)|Golden Calf]] for Best Dutch Film of the Century. Verhoeven's 1975 film ''[[Katie Tippel]]'' again featured Hauer and van de Ven, but it would not match the success of ''Turkish Delight''.\n\n[[File:V.l.n.r. Jeroen Krabb\u00e9, regisseur Paul Verhoeven en Ren\u00e9e Soutendijk, Bestanddeelnr 932-5420.jpg|thumb|Paul Verhoeven (1983)]]\n\nVerhoeven built on his reputation and achieved international success with his [[Golden Globe]] nominated film ''[[Soldier of Orange]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hfpa.org/browse/film/24971 |title=Winners & Nominees: Soldier of Orange |work=Hollywood Foreign Press Association |year=1980 |accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref> starring Rutger Hauer and [[Jeroen Krabb\u00e9]]. The film, based on a true story about the Dutch resistance in [[World War II]], was written by [[Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema]]. ''Soldier of Orange'' received the 1979 LA Film Critics Award for best foreign language film. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe in 1980.\n\nIn 1980 Verhoeven made the film ''[[Spetters]]'' with [[Ren\u00e9e Soutendijk]] and Rutger Hauer. The story is sometimes compared to ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', but the film has more explicit violence and sexuality (in this case also homosexuality), which are sometimes seen as the trademarks of Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven's film ''[[The Fourth Man (1983 film)|The Fourth Man]]'' (1983) is a horror film starring Jeroen Krabb\u00e9 and [[Ren\u00e9e Soutendijk]]. It was written by [[Gerard Soeteman]] from a novel by the Dutch writer [[Gerard Reve]]. This film would be Verhoeven's last Dutch film production until the 2006 film ''[[Black Book (film)|Black Book]]''.\n\n===Filmmaking in the United States (1983\u20132000)===\nGerard Soeteman also wrote the script for Verhoeven's first English-language film, ''[[Flesh and Blood (1985 film)|Flesh and Blood]]'' (1985), which starred [[Rutger Hauer]] and [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]]. Verhoeven moved to Hollywood for a wider range of opportunities in filmmaking. Working in the U.S., he made a serious change in style, directing big-budget, violent, special-effects-heavy hits ''RoboCop'' and ''Total Recall''\u2060\u2014each of which won an [[Academy Special Achievement Award]]: ''[[RoboCop]]'' for Sound Effects Editing, and ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' for Visual Effects, .\n\n[[File:Basic Instinct Cannes 1992.jpg|thumb|right|Presentation of ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' at the [[1992 Cannes Film Festival|1992]] [[Cannes Film Festival]]. Left to right: [[Jeanne Tripplehorn]], [[Michael Douglas]], Martine Tours (Verhoeven's wife), Verhoeven, [[Sharon Stone]] and [[Mario Kassar]]]]\n\nVerhoeven followed those successes with the equally intense and provocative ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992), an erotic thriller. The ninth-highest-grossing film of the year, the movie was a return to themes Verhoeven had explored in ''[[Turkish Delight (1973 film)|Turkish Delight]]'' and ''[[The Fourth Man (1983 film)|The Fourth Man]]''. The film's most notorious scene shows Sharon Stone's character in a police interrogation, where she uncrosses her legs, briefly revealing her vulva (she does not wear underwear underneath her skirt). The film received two Academy Awards nominations, for Film Editing and for Original Music.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1993/B?qt-honorees=1#block-quicktabs-honorees |title=1993 Nominees (B) |work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Verhoeven also worked on creating an historical epic based around the [[Crusades]] that would have starred [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. The film entered pre-production in 1993, but a year later the studio backing the film ([[Carolco Pictures|Carolco]]) pulled funding for the project. Verhoeven would continue to discuss the film throughout the 1990s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/14094/the-7-films-that-arnold-schwarzenegger-never-made|title=The 7 films that Arnold Schwarzenegger never made|last=Brew|first=Simon|date=3 March 2009|website=[[Den of Geek]]|url-status=live|access-date=25 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flixist.com/from-hell-paul-verhoeven-arnold-schwarzenegger-s-crusade-207103.phtml|title=From Hell: Paul Verhoeven/Arnold Schwarzenegger's Crusade|last=Vigilla|first=Hubert|date=29 February 2012|website=Flixist|url-status=live|access-date=25 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yakir|first=Dan|date=February 1996|title=Starship Instincts|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-223/page/n33|journal=[[Starlog]]|issue=223|pages=34\u201335|via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref>\n\nVerhoeven's next film was the poorly received, NC-17 rated ''[[Showgirls]]'' (1995), about a stripper in [[Las Vegas]] trying to make a career as a showgirl. The film won seven [[1995 Golden Raspberry Awards|Golden Raspberry Awards]] including Worst Film and Worst Director; Verhoeven became the first director to accept his \"award\" in person.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000558/1996/1/|title=Razzie Awards (1996)|publisher=IMDb}}</ref> Afterward, the film enjoyed success on the [[home video]] market, generating more than $100&nbsp;million from video rentals<ref>{{Cite news |last=Wiser |first=Paige |title=The beauty of 'Showgirls' |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=27 July 2004}}</ref> and became one of [[MGM]]'s top 20 all-time bestsellers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mgm.com/title_title.php?title_star=SHOWGRLS |title=Showgirls DVD |work=MGM |date=28 April 2007 |accessdate=25 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428172642/http://www.mgm.com/title_title.php?title_star=SHOWGRLS |archivedate=28 April 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAfter ''Basic Instinct'' and ''Showgirls'', Verhoeven returned to the science fiction, graphic violence and special-effects tropes that had marked his earlier films with ''[[Starship Troopers (film)|Starship Troopers]]'' (1997), loosely based on the novel of the same name by [[Robert A. Heinlein]],<ref name=\"gemsbok\">{{Cite web|url=http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/thursday-theater-starship-troopers-paul-verhoeven-robert-heinlein/|title=Poking Fun at Militarism: How Paul Verhoeven\u2019s Cult Classic ''Starship Troopers'' Willfully Discards Robert Heinlein\u2019s Novel|last=Podgorski|first=Daniel|date=4 February 2016|website=The Gemsbok|accessdate=7 December 2016}}</ref> and ''[[Hollow Man]]'' (2000). Each film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects.\n\n===Return to Europe (2006\u2013present)===\nAfter about 20 years of working and living in the United States, Verhoeven returned to the Netherlands for the shooting of a new film. Together with his screenwriter [[Gerard Soeteman]], Verhoeven made ''[[Black Book (film)|Black Book]]'' (2006).

The film ''[[Beast of Bataan]]'' had been announced, but once the shooting for ''Black Book'' resumed, the other film was not realized.\n\n[[File:Paul Verhoeven International Jury Berlinale 2017.jpg|thumb|left|Verhoeven at press conference at [[Berlinale 2017]]]]\nVerhoeven was knighted in the [[Order of the Netherlands Lion]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.omroepwest.nl/nieuws/27-04-2007/paul-verhoeven-geridderd-den-haag |title=Paul Verhoeven geridderd in Den Haag |work=Omroep West |date=27 April 2007 |accessdate=12 February 2015 |language=Dutch}}</ref>\n\nSince ''Black Book'', Verhoeven has been connected to a large number of projects, but in the first decade after his return, none came to fruition.

His family lived in the village of [[Slikkerveer]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn 1943 the family moved to [[The Hague]], the location of the German headquarters in the Netherlands during [[World War II]]. The Verhoeven house was near a German military base with [[V-weapons|V1 and V2-rocket launchers]], which was repeatedly bombed by Allied forces. Their neighbours' house was hit and Verhoeven's parents were almost killed when bombs fell on a street crossing. From this period, Verhoeven mentioned in interviews, he remembers images of violence, burning houses, dead bodies on the street, and continuous danger. As a small child he experienced the war as an exciting adventure and compares himself with the character Bill Rowan in ''[[Hope and Glory (film)|Hope and Glory]]'' (1987).<ref name=\"oorlog\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ethesis.net/verhoeven/verhoeven_deel_1.htm|title=Een beetje oorlog, best spannend|trans-title=A little war, quite exciting|work=De cinema van Paul Verhoeven: voorbij de controverse|first=Rob |last=Testelmans|year=2003|accessdate=17 October 2006|language=Dutch}}</ref>\n\nVerhoeven's father became head teacher at the [[Van Heutszschool]] in The Hague, and Paul attended this school. Sometimes they watched informative films at home with the school's [[Movie projector|film projector]]. Verhoeven and his father also liked to see American films that were in the cinema after the liberation, such as ''[[The Crimson Pirate]]'' (1952).{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThey went ten times to see ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]'' (1953). Verhoeven was a fan of the Dutch comic ''[[Dick Bos]]'' ([[:nl:Dick Bos|nl]]). The character Dick Bos is a private detective who fights crime using [[jujutsu]]. Verhoeven liked comic drawing; he created ''The Killer'', a character in a detailed story of revenge. Other fiction he liked were ''[[Frankenstein]]'' and the [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] [[Barsoom]] series.<ref name=\"oorlog\"/>\n\nVerhoeven attended public secondary school [[Gymnasium Haganum]] in The Hague. Later, beginning in 1955, he studied at [[Leiden University]], where he joined the elite fraternity ''Minerva''.

After this he made three more short films: ''Nothing Special'' (1961), ''The Hitchhikers'' (1962), and ''Let's Have a Party'' (1963).\n\nVerhoeven has not used his mathematics and physics degree, opting instead to invest his energies in a career in film. After his studies he entered the [[Royal Dutch Navy]] as a conscript. He made the documentary ''Het Korps Mariniers'' (\"''The Marine Corps''\", 1965), which won the French ''Golden Sun'' award for military films.<ref name=\"oorlog\"/>\n\nIn 1967 Verhoeven married Martine Tours, with whom he later had two daughters, Claudia (b. 1972), and Helen (b. 1974).\n\nWhen he left the Navy, Verhoeven took his skills to Dutch television. First, he made a documentary about [[Anton Mussert]] named ''Mussert'' (1968). His first major success was the 1969 ''[[Floris (TV series)|Floris]]'' television series, starring [[Rutger Hauer]]. The concept of ''Floris'' was inspired by foreign series like ''[[Ivanhoe]]'' and ''[[Thierry La Fronde]]''.\n\n===First feature films (1969\u20131983)===\nVerhoeven's first feature film ''[[Business Is Business (film)|Business Is Business]]'' was released in 1971 and was not well received. His first national success came in 1973 with ''[[Turkish Delight (1973 film)|Turkish Delight]]'', starring Rutger Hauer and [[Monique van de Ven]]. This film is based on a novel by bestselling Dutch author [[Jan Wolkers]] and tells the passionate love story of an artist and a young liberal girl from a conservative background. The film received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] in 1974. In 1999 the film won a [[Golden Calf (award)|Golden Calf]] for Best Dutch Film of the Century. Verhoeven's 1975 film ''[[Katie Tippel]]'' again featured Hauer and van de Ven, but it would not match the success of ''Turkish Delight''.\n\n[[File:V.l.n.r.

The film, based on a true story about the Dutch resistance in [[World War II]], was written by [[Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema]]. ''Soldier of Orange'' received the 1979 LA Film Critics Award for best foreign language film. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe in 1980.\n\nIn 1980 Verhoeven made the film ''[[Spetters]]'' with [[Ren\u00e9e Soutendijk]] and Rutger Hauer. The story is sometimes compared to ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', but the film has more explicit violence and sexuality (in this case also homosexuality), which are sometimes seen as the trademarks of Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven's film ''[[The Fourth Man (1983 film)|The Fourth Man]]'' (1983) is a horror film starring Jeroen Krabb\u00e9 and [[Ren\u00e9e Soutendijk]]. It was written by [[Gerard Soeteman]] from a novel by the Dutch writer [[Gerard Reve]]. This film would be Verhoeven's last Dutch film production until the 2006 film ''[[Black Book (film)|Black Book]]''.\n\n===Filmmaking in the United States (1983\u20132000)===\nGerard Soeteman also wrote the script for Verhoeven's first English-language film, ''[[Flesh and Blood (1985 film)|Flesh and Blood]]'' (1985), which starred [[Rutger Hauer]] and [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]]. Verhoeven moved to Hollywood for a wider range of opportunities in filmmaking. Working in the U.S., he made a serious change in style, directing big-budget, violent, special-effects-heavy hits ''RoboCop'' and ''Total Recall''\u2060\u2014each of which won an [[Academy Special Achievement Award]]: ''[[RoboCop]]'' for Sound Effects Editing, and ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' for Visual Effects, .\n\n[[File:Basic Instinct Cannes 1992.jpg|thumb|right|Presentation of ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' at the [[1992 Cannes Film Festival|1992]] [[Cannes Film Festival]]. Left to right: [[Jeanne Tripplehorn]], [[Michael Douglas]], Martine Tours (Verhoeven's wife), Verhoeven, [[Sharon Stone]] and [[Mario Kassar]]]]\n\nVerhoeven followed those successes with the equally intense and provocative ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992), an erotic thriller. The ninth-highest-grossing film of the year, the movie was a return to themes Verhoeven had explored in ''[[Turkish Delight (1973 film)|Turkish Delight]]'' and ''[[The Fourth Man (1983 film)|The Fourth Man]]''. The film's most notorious scene shows Sharon Stone's character in a police interrogation, where she uncrosses her legs, briefly revealing her vulva (she does not wear underwear underneath her skirt). The film received two Academy Awards nominations, for Film Editing and for Original Music.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1993/B?qt-honorees=1#block-quicktabs-honorees |title=1993 Nominees (B) |work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Verhoeven also worked on creating an historical epic based around the [[Crusades]] that would have starred [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. The film entered pre-production in 1993, but a year later the studio backing the film ([[Carolco Pictures|Carolco]]) pulled funding for the project. Verhoeven would continue to discuss the film throughout the 1990s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/14094/the-7-films-that-arnold-schwarzenegger-never-made|title=The 7 films that Arnold Schwarzenegger never made|last=Brew|first=Simon|date=3 March 2009|website=[[Den of Geek]]|url-status=live|access-date=25 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flixist.com/from-hell-paul-verhoeven-arnold-schwarzenegger-s-crusade-207103.phtml|title=From Hell: Paul Verhoeven/Arnold Schwarzenegger's Crusade|last=Vigilla|first=Hubert|date=29 February 2012|website=Flixist|url-status=live|access-date=25 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yakir|first=Dan|date=February 1996|title=Starship Instincts|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-223/page/n33|journal=[[Starlog]]|issue=223|pages=34\u201335|via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref>\n\nVerhoeven's next film was the poorly received, NC-17 rated ''[[Showgirls]]'' (1995), about a stripper in [[Las Vegas]] trying to make a career as a showgirl.

In 2016 however, Verhoeven followed ''Black Book'' by directing a French film: ''[[Elle (film)|Elle]]'', an adaptation of a novel by [[Philippe Djian]]. A psycho-thriller where [[Isabelle Huppert]] plays a rape victim, Elle was selected for the Official Competition at the Cannes International Film Festival, where it obtained very favourable reviews.\n\nIn December 2016, it was announced that Verhoeven would be the president of the jury for the [[67th Berlin International Film Festival]], scheduled to take place in February 2017.<ref name=\"Berlin2017\">{{cite web |url=https://www.berlinale.de/en/das_festival/preise_und_juries/preise_internationale_jury/index.html |title=Jury President of the Berlinale 2017: Paul Verhoeven |work=Berlinale |accessdate=9 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2017, ''[[Benedetta (film)|Benedetta]]'', his next French film, was announced to begin filming in August of the same year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/global/paul-verhoeven-approaches-blessed-virgin-with-elle-star-virginie-efira-1202399023/|title=Paul Verhoeven to Direct \u2018Blessed Virgin,\u2019 Based on True Story of Lesbian Nun|first1=Robert|last1=Mitchell|first2=Robert|last2=Mitchell|date=26 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ecrannoir.fr/blog/blog/2018/03/06/virginie-efira-retourne-chez-paul-verhoeven/|title=Virginie Efira retourne chez Paul Verhoeven \" Le Blog d'Ecran Noir}}</ref> It is a biographical film about the life of [[Benedetta Carlini]], which will be portrayed by ''Elle'' co-star [[Virginie Efira]], and is an adaptation of the non-fiction book ''Immodest Acts - The life of a lesbian nun in Renaissance Italy'' by [[Judith C.
