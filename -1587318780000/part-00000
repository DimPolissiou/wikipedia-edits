Bury finished the 2018\u201319 season as runners-up in [[EFL League Two]], the fourth tier of the [[English football league system]], and were promoted to [[EFL League One]] for the 2019\u201320 season. The team were unable to begin the season because of the club's longstanding financial issues and, on 27 August 2019, Bury were expelled from the [[English Football League]] (EFL). In December 2019 and February 2020, the club survived [[HM Revenue and Customs]] (HMRC) winding-up petitions in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]]; it still exists but with no league membership, and, {{As of|alt=as of mid April 2020|2020|02|post=,}} is at risk of liquidation.\n\nKnown as \"The Shakers\", the team play in white shirts and navy blue shorts. [[Gigg Lane]], one of the world's oldest football grounds, has been the club's home venue since 1885. The club's location led to local derby games with numerous clubs and Bury has long-standing rivalries with near neighbours [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] and [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]].\n\nEstablished in 1885, Bury were founder members of the [[Lancashire League (football)|Lancashire League]] in 1889, and were crowned champions in the 1890\u201391 and 1891\u201392 seasons, before being elected to The Football League (now known as the EFL) in 1894. They won the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] title in 1894\u201395 and won their [[test match (association football)|test match]] to secure promotion into the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. They remained in the top flight for 17 seasons, winning the [[FA Cup]] in [[1900 FA Cup Final|1900]] with a 4\u20130 victory over [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and again in [[1903 FA Cup Final|1903]] with a 6\u20130 win over [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]. This remains a record winning margin in an FA Cup final, equalled only once, when [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] beat [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] in the [[2019 FA Cup Final|2019 final]].\n\nThey were relegated to the Second Division at the end of the 1911\u201312 season, before securing promotion again in 1923\u201324. Bury lost their top-flight status in 1928\u201329 and have not returned. They dropped into the third tier in 1956\u201357, before winning promotion as champions of the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] under the stewardship of [[Dave Russell (footballer)|Dave Russell]] in 1960\u201361. From 1967 to 1971 they were promoted once but, with three relegations, found themselves in the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] for the first time.\n\nBury won promotion at the end of the 1973\u201374 campaign and remained in the Third Division until 1979\u201380. They were in the fourth tier in September 1995 when [[Stan Ternent]] took over as team manager. He led them back to the second tier for the first time in 28 years after securing two consecutive promotions in 1995\u201396 and 1996\u201397 \u2013 winning promotion as champions in the latter campaign. They remained there for just two seasons and were relegated twice in four seasons, before securing promotion out of [[EFL League Two|League Two]] in 2010\u201311. They then switched between [[EFL League One|Leagues One]] and Two, being twice relegated (in 2012\u201313 and 2017\u201318) and twice promoted (in 2014\u201315 and 2018\u201319).\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (1885\u20131895)===\nBury Football Club was founded on 24 April 1885 after Aiden Arrowsmith,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.buryfc.co.uk/siteassets/pdf/commercial/commercial-brochure.pdf |title=History is made |publisher=Bury Football Club |accessdate=3 June 2019}}</ref> a local enthusiast, had brokered two meetings between church teams Bury Wesleyans and Bury Unitarians at the Waggon & Horses Hotel and the White Horse Hotel.<ref name=\"RG106\">{{cite book |title=Rough Guide to English Football |last=Goldstein |first=Dan |date=2000 |publisher=Rough Guides Ltd |page=[https://archive.org/details/roughguidetoengl00dang/page/106 106] |isbn=1-85828-557-7 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetoengl00dang/page/106 }}</ref> It was agreed from the outset that the team should be professional.

The semi-final against Forest was played at Stoke and ended 1\u20131 after Bury missed a penalty. A replay was held at [[Bramall Lane]] in Sheffield and Bury began disastrously by conceding two goals in the first two minutes. [[Charlie Sagar]] pulled one back after 55 minutes and then [[Jasper McLuckie]] equalised with only five minutes to go. Extra time was played and Sagar scored the winner after 110 minutes of play. The final at the old Crystal Palace ground was played in a heatwave and Bury, captained by [[Jack Pray]], dominated from the start. The goals in a one-sided match were scored by McLuckie (2), [[Willie Wood (footballer)|Willie Wood]] and [[John Plant (footballer)|John Plant]].

En route to the final against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], Bury defeated [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], Sheffield United, Notts County and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. As in 1900, the final was played at the old Crystal Palace ground in south London. A crowd of 63,102 attended. As the two teams wore identical kits, agreement on colours for the day was necessary and they both changed with Bury wearing Cambridge blue shirts and navy shorts while Derby chose red shirts and black shorts.<ref name=\"TFACW\"/>\n\nSix of Bury's 1900 finalists were in the 1903 team, led by skipper [[George Ross (footballer, born 1869)|George Ross]] who scored the opening goal after 20 minutes. Derby's keeper [[Jack Fryer (footballer, born 1877)|Jack Fryer]] played despite an existing injury which he aggravated early in the second half when he was trying to prevent Charlie Sagar from scoring Bury's second goal. As a result, Fryer was forced to leave the field and, as substitutes were not allowed then, one of the full-backs deputised in goal and their team was down to ten men for most of the last forty minutes. Bury scored three goals in four minutes just before the hour was up and their sixth after 76 minutes. [[Joe Leeming]] scored the third and last goals. Willie Wood and John Plant scored the other two. The final was a no contest and Derby were lambasted by the press for their poor performance. One reporter commented that, but for being merciful, Bury should have scored twenty.<ref name=\"TFACW\"/> Bury's 6\u20130 win established an FA Cup final record for the biggest winning margin. Bury remained sole holders of the record until the 2019 final in which [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] defeated [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] by the same score. The ball used in the 1903 final is on display at the [[National Football Museum]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalfootballmuseum.com/collections_detail/fa-cup-final-ball-bury-v-derby-county-1903 |title=FA Cup Final ball, Bury v Derby County, 1903 |publisher=National Football Museum |accessdate=16 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nUntil 1907, the team was always managed by one or more members of the club committee. The first specialist team manager was goalkeeper [[Archie Montgomery]] who was appointed on 1 February 1907. He was in charge when the team were relegated in 1912 and stayed on until 30 April 1915 when he was dismissed because of the club's lack of income in wartime.<ref name=\"FMBFC\"/> The club had a windfall in 1922 when [[Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby]], unexpectedly gifted them with the freehold of Gigg Lane. The team returned to the First Division for a five-season spell in 1924 and achieved their highest-ever league position, fourth, in [[1925\u201326 Football League|1925\u201326]].<ref name=\"Rundle\"/> After relegation back to the Second Division in 1929, Bury have not played in the top flight.<ref name=\"Rundle\"/>\n\n===1929\u20131969===\n[[File:Bury FC League Performance.svg|right|thumb|600px|Chart of table positions of Bury in the Football League.]]\nStriving to recover First Division status, Bury had four top six finishes in Division Two in the 1930s. The closest that they have ever come to a top flight return was in [[1936\u201337 Football League|1936\u201337]] when they finished third (only the first two teams were promoted).<ref name=\"Rundle\"/>\n\nWith league football suspended for the duration of [[World War II]], Bury took part in the wartime competitions and, like all other clubs, often relied on guest players because of service calls. They had a successful season in 1939\u201340 and won the North West Regional League Championship.<ref name=\"DSWF\">{{cite book |last=Andrews |first=Gordon |title=The DataSport Book of Wartime Football: 1939\u201346 |publisher=DataSport |date=1989 |page=18}}</ref> The team were unbeaten in a sequence of 16 matches from October to February.<ref name=\"GA11\">Andrews, p. 11.</ref> On 30 December 1939, they played a friendly against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] which resulted in a 7\u20136 win for Bury.<ref name=\"GA11\"/>\n\nBury were close to relegation from the Second Division several times after the war. They finally dropped into the [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]] for the first time in 1957. 1957\u201358 was that division's last season before the regional sections were amalgamated into national [[Football League Third Division|Third]] and [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Divisions]].<ref name=\"Rundle\"/>\n\nUnder manager [[Dave Russell (footballer)|Dave Russell]], a young Bury team were Third Division champions in 1960\u201361.<ref name=\"Rundle\"/> They spent seven of the next eight seasons back in the Second Division with a best position of eighth in 1962\u201363.<ref name=\"Rundle\"/> In the [[1962\u201363 Football League Cup]], they reached the semi-final but lost 4\u20133 [[two-legged tie|on aggregate]] to eventual winners [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]].<ref name=\"Rundle\"/> For three seasons from 1963, Bury's best player was the future England midfielder [[Colin Bell]], who was team captain while still a teenager. He transferred to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 1966 and Bury were relegated the following season. They bounced straight back as Third Division runners-up in 1968 but went down again in 1969.<ref name=\"Rundle\"/>\n\n===1969\u20132000===\nIn 1971, relegation from Division Three took Bury into the Fourth Division for the first time. They gained promotion in 1974 and spent six seasons in the Third Division before the next relegation.<ref name=\"Rundle\"/> The club celebrated its centenary in 1985 by gaining promotion back to the Third Division.<ref name=\"Rundle\"/>\n\nBury came close to promotion from the Third Division in both 1990 and 1991 when they finished fifth and seventh respectively to qualify for the play-offs. They were eliminated at the semi-final stage in both play-offs, losing 2\u20130 on aggregate to [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] in 1990 and 2\u20131 on aggregate to neighbours [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in 1991.<ref name=\"Rundle\"/> Relegation followed in 1992 and then Bury qualified for the fourth-tier play-off in 1993 by finishing seventh but, yet again, lost their semi-final tie by going down 1\u20130 on aggregate to [[York City F.C.|York City]]. Bury were back in the play-offs again in 1995 after finishing fourth. This time, they won their semi-final by beating [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] 2\u20130 on aggregate and so went to Wembley for the final, where they lost 2\u20130 to [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]].<ref name=\"Rundle\"/>\n\nThe club then enjoyed a resurgence under manager [[Stan Ternent]] who engineered two successive promotions in the mid-1990s. In 1996, third place in what was now the fourth-tier Division Three, followed by the third-tier Division Two title in [[1996\u201397 Bury F.C. season|1996\u201397]], brought Bury back to the second tier for the first time in thirty years.<ref name=\"Rundle\"/> They went back to the third tier on the last day of the 1998\u201399 season on the basis of having a lower [[goals scored]] total than [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]], the League having decided to use this metric rather than [[goal difference]] as its tie-breaker. Bury's goal difference was higher than that of Port Vale, and the League reinstated goal difference as the tie-breaker for the following season.\n\n===2001\u20132019===\nIn 2001\u201302, financial problems caused by the collapse of [[ITV Digital]] brought the club into [[administration (British football)|administration]] and to the brink of folding.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/david-conn-burys-begging-bowl-may-not-avert-closure-9161973.html |title=Bury's begging bowl may not avert closure |first=David |last=Conn |publisher=The Independent |location=London |date=22 February 2002 |accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1848370.stm |title=Shakers face court's final whistle |publisher=BBC News |date=1 March 2002 |accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref> A supporters' campaign raised enough money to keep the club afloat,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buryfc.co.uk/fans/view/page/0,,10422,00.html |title=Save Our Shakers |publisher=Bury Football Club |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020403014508/http://www.buryfc.co.uk/fans/view/page/0%2C%2C10422%2C00.html |archivedate= 3 April 2002 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foreverbury.org/?page_id=2 |title=Background |publisher=Forever Bury: The Bury FC Supporters Society |accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref> and in recognition of his role within that process, [[UEFA]] presented club press officer Gordon Sorfleet with their Best Supporter award for 2001\u201302.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefasupercup/news/newsid=29981.html |title=Zidane honoured at Gala night |publisher=UEFA |date=12 August 2002 |accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/zidane-totti-and-a-star-struck-shaker-175693.html |title=Zidane, Totti and a star-struck Shaker |first=Nick |last=Harris |publisher=The Independent |location=London |date=2 September 2002 |accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref> Bury were relegated to fourth-tier Division Three at the end of that season.<ref name=\"Rundle\"/> They finished seventh in 2003 and qualified for the play-offs but, yet again, their semi-final hoodoo struck and they were beaten 3\u20131 on aggregate by [[A.

Bury finished the 2018\u201319 season as runners-up in [[EFL League Two]], the fourth tier of the [[English football league system]], and were promoted to [[EFL League One]] for the 2019\u201320 season. The team were unable to begin the season because of the club's longstanding financial issues and, on 27 August 2019, Bury were expelled from the [[English Football League]] (EFL). In December 2019 and February 2020, the club survived [[HM Revenue and Customs]] (HMRC) winding-up petitions in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]]; it still exists but with no league membership, and, {{As of|alt=as of early April 2020|2020|02|post=,}} is at risk of liquidation.\n\nKnown as \"The Shakers\", the team play in white shirts and navy blue shorts. [[Gigg Lane]], one of the world's oldest football grounds, has been the club's home venue since 1885. The club's location led to local derby games with numerous clubs and Bury has long-standing rivalries with near neighbours [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] and [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]].\n\nEstablished in 1885, Bury were founder members of the [[Lancashire League (football)|Lancashire League]] in 1889, and were crowned champions in the 1890\u201391 and 1891\u201392 seasons, before being elected to The Football League (now known as the EFL) in 1894. They won the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] title in 1894\u201395 and won their [[test match (association football)|test match]] to secure promotion into the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. They remained in the top flight for 17 seasons, winning the [[FA Cup]] in [[1900 FA Cup Final|1900]] with a 4\u20130 victory over [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and again in [[1903 FA Cup Final|1903]] with a 6\u20130 win over [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]. This remains a record winning margin in an FA Cup final, equalled only once, when [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] beat [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] in the [[2019 FA Cup Final|2019 final]].\n\nThey were relegated to the Second Division at the end of the 1911\u201312 season, before securing promotion again in 1923\u201324. Bury lost their top-flight status in 1928\u201329 and have not returned. They dropped into the third tier in 1956\u201357, before winning promotion as champions of the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] under the stewardship of [[Dave Russell (footballer)|Dave Russell]] in 1960\u201361. From 1967 to 1971 they were promoted once but, with three relegations, found themselves in the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] for the first time.\n\nBury won promotion at the end of the 1973\u201374 campaign and remained in the Third Division until 1979\u201380. They were in the fourth tier in September 1995 when [[Stan Ternent]] took over as team manager. He led them back to the second tier for the first time in 28 years after securing two consecutive promotions in 1995\u201396 and 1996\u201397 \u2013 winning promotion as champions in the latter campaign. They remained there for just two seasons and were relegated twice in four seasons, before securing promotion out of [[EFL League Two|League Two]] in 2010\u201311. They then switched between [[EFL League One|Leagues One]] and Two, being twice relegated (in 2012\u201313 and 2017\u201318) and twice promoted (in 2014\u201315 and 2018\u201319).\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (1885\u20131895)===\nBury Football Club was founded on 24 April 1885 after Aiden Arrowsmith,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.buryfc.co.uk/siteassets/pdf/commercial/commercial-brochure.pdf |title=History is made |publisher=Bury Football Club |accessdate=3 June 2019}}</ref> a local enthusiast, had brokered two meetings between church teams Bury Wesleyans and Bury Unitarians at the Waggon & Horses Hotel and the White Horse Hotel.<ref name=\"RG106\">{{cite book |title=Rough Guide to English Football |last=Goldstein |first=Dan |date=2000 |publisher=Rough Guides Ltd |page=[https://archive.org/details/roughguidetoengl00dang/page/106 106] |isbn=1-85828-557-7 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetoengl00dang/page/106 }}</ref> It was agreed from the outset that the team should be professional.

The semi-final against Forest was played at Stoke and ended 1\u20131 after Bury missed a penalty. A replay was held at [[Bramall Lane]] in Sheffield and Bury began disastrously by conceding two goals in the first two minutes. [[Charlie Sagar]] pulled one back after 55 minutes and then [[Jasper McLuckie]] equalised with only five minutes to go. Extra time was played and Sagar scored the winner after 110 minutes of play.

En route to the final against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], Bury defeated [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], Sheffield United, Notts County and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. As in 1900, the final was played at the old Crystal Palace ground in south London. A crowd of 63,102 attended. As the two teams wore identical kits, agreement on colours for the day was necessary and they both changed with Bury wearing Cambridge blue shirts and navy shorts while Derby chose red shirts and black shorts.<ref name=\"TFACW\"/>\n\nSix of Bury's 1900 finalists were in the 1903 team, led by skipper [[George Ross (footballer, born 1869)|George Ross]] who scored the opening goal after 20 minutes. Derby's keeper [[Jack Fryer (footballer, born 1877)|Jack Fryer]] played despite an existing injury which he aggravated early in the second half when he was trying to prevent Charlie Sagar from scoring Bury's second goal. As a result, Fryer was forced to leave the field and, as substitutes were not allowed then, one of the full-backs deputised in goal and their team was down to ten men for most of the last forty minutes. Bury scored three goals in four minutes just before the hour was up and their sixth after 76 minutes. [[Joe Leeming]] scored the third and last goals. Willie Wood and John Plant scored the other two. The final was a no contest and Derby were lambasted by the press for their poor performance. One reporter commented that, but for being merciful, Bury should have scored twenty.<ref name=\"TFACW\"/> Bury's 6\u20130 win established an FA Cup final record for the biggest winning margin. Bury remained sole holders of the record until the 2019 final in which [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] defeated [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] by the same score.

The first specialist team manager was goalkeeper [[Archie Montgomery]] who was appointed on 1 February 1907. He was in charge when the team were relegated in 1912 and stayed on until 30 April 1915 when he was dismissed because of the club's lack of income in wartime.<ref name=\"FMBFC\"/> The club had a windfall in 1922 when [[Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby]], unexpectedly gifted them with the freehold of Gigg Lane. The team returned to the First Division for a five-season spell in 1924 and achieved their highest-ever league position, fourth, in [[1925\u201326 Football League|1925\u201326]].<ref name=\"Rundle\"/> After relegation back to the Second Division in 1929, Bury have not played in the top flight.<ref name=\"Rundle\"/>\n\n===1929\u20131969===\n[[File:Bury FC League Performance.svg|right|thumb|600px|Chart of table positions of Bury in the Football League.]]\nStriving to recover First Division status, Bury had four top six finishes in Division Two in the 1930s.

They had a successful season in 1939\u201340 and won the North West Regional League Championship.<ref name=\"DSWF\">{{cite book |last=Andrews |first=Gordon |title=The DataSport Book of Wartime Football: 1939\u201346 |publisher=DataSport |date=1989 |page=18}}</ref> The team were unbeaten in a sequence of 16 matches from October to February.<ref name=\"GA11\">Andrews, p. 11.</ref> On 30 December 1939, they played a friendly against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] which resulted in a 7\u20136 win for Bury.<ref name=\"GA11\"/>\n\nBury were close to relegation from the Second Division several times after the war. They finally dropped into the [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]] for the first time in 1957. 1957\u201358 was that division's last season before the regional sections were amalgamated into national [[Football League Third Division|Third]] and [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Divisions]].<ref name=\"Rundle\"/>\n\nUnder manager [[Dave Russell (footballer)|Dave Russell]], a young Bury team were Third Division champions in 1960\u201361.<ref name=\"Rundle\"/> They spent seven of the next eight seasons back in the Second Division with a best position of eighth in 1962\u201363.<ref name=\"Rundle\"/> In the [[1962\u201363 Football League Cup]], they reached the semi-final but lost 4\u20133 [[two-legged tie|on aggregate]] to eventual winners [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]].<ref name=\"Rundle\"/> For three seasons from 1963, Bury's best player was the future England midfielder [[Colin Bell]], who was team captain while still a teenager. He transferred to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 1966 and Bury were relegated the following season. They bounced straight back as Third Division runners-up in 1968 but went down again in 1969.<ref name=\"Rundle\"/>\n\n===1969\u20132000===\nIn 1971, relegation from Division Three took Bury into the Fourth Division for the first time.

They were eliminated at the semi-final stage in both play-offs, losing 2\u20130 on aggregate to [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] in 1990 and 2\u20131 on aggregate to neighbours [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in 1991.<ref name=\"Rundle\"/> Relegation followed in 1992 and then Bury qualified for the fourth-tier play-off in 1993 by finishing seventh but, yet again, lost their semi-final tie by going down 1\u20130 on aggregate to [[York City F.C.|York City]]. Bury were back in the play-offs again in 1995 after finishing fourth. This time, they won their semi-final by beating [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] 2\u20130 on aggregate and so went to Wembley for the final, where they lost 2\u20130 to [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]].<ref name=\"Rundle\"/>\n\nThe club then enjoyed a resurgence under manager [[Stan Ternent]] who engineered two successive promotions in the mid-1990s. In 1996, third place in what was now the fourth-tier Division Three, followed by the third-tier Division Two title in [[1996\u201397 Bury F.C. season|1996\u201397]], brought Bury back to the second tier for the first time in thirty years.<ref name=\"Rundle\"/> They went back to the third tier on the last day of the 1998\u201399 season on the basis of having a lower [[goals scored]] total than [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]], the League having decided to use this metric rather than [[goal difference]] as its tie-breaker.

He became a teacher in microbiology at the Agricultural School in Wageningen (now [[Wageningen University]]) and later at the ''Polytechnische Hogeschool Delft'' ([[Delft]] [[Institute of technology#Belgium and the Netherlands|Polytechnic]], currently [[Delft University of Technology]]) (from 1895). He established the Delft School of Microbiology. His studies of agricultural and industrial microbiology yielded fundamental discoveries in the field of [[biology]]. His achievements have been perhaps unfairly overshadowed by those of his contemporaries, [[Robert Koch]] and [[Louis Pasteur]], because unlike them, Beijerinck never studied human disease.\n\nIn 1885 he became member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00001421 |title=Martinus Willem Beijerinck (1851 - 1931) |publisher=[[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] |date= |accessdate=19 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Scientific contributions==\nHe is considered one of the founders of [[virology]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Lustig |first1 = Alice |last2 = Levine |first2 = Arnold J. | title = One Hundred Years of Virology | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 66 | issue = 8 | pages = 4629\u20134631 | year = 1992 |location = Washington, D.C.| pmc=241285 | pmid=1629947|doi = 10.1128/JVI.66.8.4629-4631.1992 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bos| first1 = L. | year = 1995 | title = The Embryonic Beginning of Virology: Unbiased Thinking and Dogmatic Stagnation | journal = Archives of Virology | volume = 140 | issue = 3 | pages = 613\u2013619 | doi=10.1007/bf01718437| pmid = 7733832 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last = Zaitlin| first = Milton|author-link=Milton Zaitlin| editor1-last = Kung| editor1-first = S.

He named the new [[pathogen]] ''[[virus]]'' to indicate its non-bacterial nature. Beijerinck asserted that the virus was somewhat liquid in nature, calling it \"''[[contagium vivum fluidum]]''\" (contagious living fluid). It was not until the first crystals of the [[tobacco mosaic virus]] (TMV) obtained by [[Wendell Stanley]] in 1935, the first electron micrographs of TMV produced in 1939 and the first [[X-ray crystallography|X-ray crystallographic analysis]] of TMV performed in 1941 proved that the virus was particulate.\n\nBeijerinck also discovered [[nitrogen fixation]],<ref>Beijerinck, M.W, 1901, ''\u00dcber oligonitrophile Mikroben, Centralblatt f\u00fcr Bakteriologie, Parasitenkunde, Infektionskrankheiten und Hygiene, Abteilung II, Vol 7'', pp. 561\u2013582</ref> the process by which diatomic [[nitrogen]] gas is converted to [[ammonium]] ions and becomes available to plants. Bacteria perform nitrogen fixation, dwelling inside [[root nodules]] of certain plants ([[legume]]s). In addition to having discovered a biochemical reaction vital to [[soil]] fertility and [[agriculture]], Beijerinck revealed this archetypical example of [[symbiosis]] between [[plants]] and [[bacteria]].\n\nBeijerinck discovered the phenomenon of bacterial [[Sulfate-reducing bacteria|sulfate reduction]], a form of [[anaerobic respiration]]. He learned bacteria could use sulfate as a terminal electron acceptor, instead of oxygen. This discovery has had an important impact on our current understanding of [[biogeochemical cycles]]. ''[[Spirillum|Spirillum desulfuricans]]'', now known as ''[[Desulfovibrio desulfuricans]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=https://lpsn.dsmz.de/genus/desulfovibrio |title=Genus ''Desulfovibrio'' |last1=Jean |first1=Euzeby |date= |website= |publisher=[[List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature]] |accessdate=November 6, 2014}}</ref> the first known sulfate-reducing bacterium, was isolated and described by Beijerinck.\n\nBeijerinck invented the [[enrichment culture]], a fundamental method of studying [[microbe]]s from the environment. He is often incorrectly credited with framing the microbial ecology idea that \"everything is everywhere, but, the environment selects\", which was stated by [[Lourens Baas Becking]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=de Wit R, Bouvier T. |title=Everything is everywhere, but, the environment selects; what did Baas Becking and Beijerinck really say? |journal=Environmental Microbiology |year=2006 |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=755\u2013758 |doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2006.01017.x |pmid=16584487}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| last=Bass-Becking |first=Lourens G.M.|year=1934 |location=[[The Hague]]| publisher=W.P. Van Stockum & Zoon |title=Geobiologie of inleiding tot de milieukunde }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nBeijerinck was a socially eccentric figure. He was verbally abusive to students, never married, and had few professional collaborations.

He established the Delft School of Microbiology. His studies of agricultural and industrial microbiology yielded fundamental discoveries in the field of [[biology]].

He named the new [[pathogen]] ''[[virus]]'' to indicate its non-bacterial nature. Beijerinck asserted that the virus was somewhat liquid in nature, calling it \"''[[contagium vivum fluidum]]''\" (contagious living fluid). It was not until the first crystals of the [[tobacco mosaic virus]] (TMV) obtained by [[Wendell Stanley]] in 1935, the first electron micrographs of TMV produced in 1939 and the first [[X-ray crystallography|X-ray crystallographic analysis]] of TMV performed in 1941 proved that the virus was particulate.\n\nBeijerinck also discovered [[nitrogen fixation]],<ref>Beijerinck, M.W, 1901, ''\u00dcber oligonitrophile Mikroben, Centralblatt f\u00fcr Bakteriologie, Parasitenkunde, Infektionskrankheiten und Hygiene, Abteilung II, Vol 7'', pp. 561\u2013582</ref> the process by which diatomic [[nitrogen]] gas is converted to [[ammonium]] ions and becomes available to plants. Bacteria perform nitrogen fixation, dwelling inside [[root nodules]] of certain plants ([[legume]]s). In addition to having discovered a biochemical reaction vital to [[soil]] fertility and [[agriculture]], Beijerinck revealed this archetypical example of [[symbiosis]] between [[plants]] and [[bacteria]].\n\nBeijerinck discovered the phenomenon of bacterial [[Sulfate-reducing bacteria|sulfate reduction]], a form of [[anaerobic respiration]]. He learned bacteria could use sulfate as a terminal electron acceptor, instead of oxygen. This discovery has had an important impact on our current understanding of [[biogeochemical cycles]]. ''[[Spirillum|Spirillum desulfuricans]]'', now known as ''[[Desulfovibrio desulfuricans]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=https://lpsn.dsmz.de/genus/desulfovibrio |title=Genus ''Desulfovibrio'' |last1=Jean |first1=Euzeby |date= |website= |publisher=[[List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature]] |accessdate=November 6, 2014}}</ref> the first known sulfate-reducing bacterium, was isolated and described by Beijerinck.\n\nBeijerinck invented the [[enrichment culture]], a fundamental method of studying [[microbe]]s from the environment.

For the PhD program, every PhD computer science student must receive a grade of A or A- on the final examination for algorithms, systems, applications, and a PhD-level course chosen by the student that does not satisfy the first three requirements, such as cryptography and numerical methods. Students may take the final exam for any these courses without being enrolled in the course.\n\nThe Computer Science Masters program offers instruction in the fundamental principles, design and applications of computer systems and computer technologies. Students who obtain an MS degree in computer science are qualified to do significant development work in the computer industry or important application areas. Those who receive a doctoral degree are in a position to hold faculty appointments and do research and development work at the forefront of this rapidly changing and expanding field. The emphasis for the MS in Information Systems program is on the use of computer systems in business. For the Master of Science in Scientific Computing, it is designed to provide broad training in areas related to scientific computing using modern computing technology and mathematical modeling arising in various applications. The core of the curriculum for all computer science graduate students consists of courses in algorithms, programming languages, compilers, artificial intelligence, database systems, and operating systems. Advanced courses are offered in many areas such as natural language processing, the theory of computation, computer vision, software engineering, compiler optimization techniques, computer graphics, distributed computing, multimedia, networks, cryptography and security, groupware and [[computational finance]]. Adjunct faculty, drawn from outside academia, teach special topics courses in their areas of expertise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/graduate/overview |title=NYU Computer Science Department > Graduate Programs in Computer Science |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\nUnless outside fellowships or scholarships are available to the students, all admitted Courant PhD students are granted with the GSAS MacCracken award.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.math.nyu.edu/dynamic/phd/admissions-financial-support/financial-support/|title=Financial Support - Department of Mathematics - NYU Courant|author=|date=|website=www.math.nyu.edu}}</ref> The fellowship covers the tuition and provides 9 months of stipend along with other benefits such as health insurance and special housing opportunies.

One example assignment requires a student to study a paper written by researchers from [[Microsoft Research Cambridge]] in order to do an assignment on Segmentation and Graph Cut. To encourage innovation, students in advanced coursework are allowed to use any means to complete their assignment, such as a programming language of their choice and hacking a [[Kinect]] through legal means.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring11/V22.0480-001/index.html |title=V22.0480-001 |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\nThe Courant Institute's undergraduate program also encourages students to engage in research with professors and graduate students. About 30% of undergraduate students participate in academic research through the competitive [[Research Experiences for Undergraduates]] program funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] or research funded primarily by the Dean's Undergraduate Research Fund. The Courant Institute has one of the highest percentage of undergraduate students doing research within [[New York University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cas.nyu.edu/page/ug.DeansResearchFund.html |title=NYU > A & S > Dean's Undergraduate Research Fund |publisher=Cas.nyu.edu |accessdate=2011-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629120916/http://cas.nyu.edu/page/ug.DeansResearchFund.html |archive-date=2011-06-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/web/Academic/Undergrad/spotlight.html |title=Undergraduate Student Spotlight - NYU Computer Science Department |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref><ref>[http://www.quantnet.com/review-nyu-mathematical-finance-program ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531134706/http://www.quantnet.com/review-nyu-mathematical-finance-program |date=May 31, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/ |title=NYU Computer Science Department > Undergraduate Program |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref> With permission of their advisers or faculty, undergraduate students may take graduate-level courses. Courant undergraduate students through the years and alumni contribute greatly to the vitality of the Mathematics and Computer Science departments. Some accomplishments by current and former undergraduate Courant students include an Apple Worldwide Developers Conference Scholarship Winner, development of Object Category Recognition Techniques to sort garbage for recycling for the NYC's trash program, placement in 7th out of 42 in the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), and inventors of the [[Diaspora (software)]] social network.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nThe undergraduate division of the Department of Mathematics offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in Mathematics. It consists of a wide variety of courses in pure and applied mathematics taught by a distinguished faculty with a tradition of excellence in teaching and research. Students in advanced coursework often participate in formulating models outside the field of mathematics as well as in analyzing them. For example, an advanced mathematics course in Computers in Medicine and Biology requires a student to construct two computer models selected from the following list: circulation, gas exchange in the lung, control of cell volume, and the renal countercurrent mechanism. The student uses the models to conduct simulated physiological experiments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:vGj-HafADLoJ:math.nyu.edu/degree/undergrad/Math%2520major%2520bulletin%25202010-11%2520Final.pdf+Math+undergraduate+nyu+requirements&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESi4x3xv-_X-4B0Xil4BidRNWKCKg9smDHdaXmhcPNv2gRXB173WgH0mNEM6D-RGr6C-oEz4XoRNBZvoWRQ_RWpcHpNzWxe06LDC0hc2wG0Yi5rf6AFY3cYBVAKb3_wZ-EJjvU6I&sig=AHIEtbSCuQUYJiy-dq4Yg8t8z5z6AnV2Ig |title=Powered by Google Docs |publisher=Docs.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\nThe undergraduate division of the Department of Computer Science offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, and fours minors.

Students may combine the degree with other majors within the College of Arts and Science to create a personalized joint major. Two specific combined degrees are the joint major in computer science/economics and the joint major in computer science/mathematics. The Department of Computer Science also offers a BS/BE Dual Degree in computer science and engineering and an accelerated master's program available to qualifying undergraduates in conjunction with the [[Tandon School of Engineering]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/overview |title=NYU Computer Science Department > Undergraduate CS Program Overview |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\n===Graduation===\nThe Courant Institute encourages students at any stage of their studies, including the very early stage, to seek summer employment opportunities at various government and industry facilities. In the past few years, Courant students have taken summer internships at the National Institute of Health, Los Alamos National Laboratory,  Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and NASA, as well as Wall Street firms. Such opportunities can greatly expand students' understanding of the mathematical sciences, offer them possible areas of interest for thesis research, and enhance their career options. Members of the faculty (and in particular the students' academic advisors) can assist students in finding appropriate summer employment. All graduate students are given official advisers, and  undergraduates are provided mentors from Courant faculty.\n\n===Academic research===\n[[File:Games for Learning Institute.jpg|thumb|The Courant Institute along with Microsoft Research are the founders of the Games for Learning Institute]]\nThe Department of Mathematics at Courant occupies a leading position in analysis and applied mathematics, including [[partial differential equations]], [[differential geometry]], [[dynamical systems]], [[probability]] and [[stochastic processes]], [[scientific computation]], [[mathematical finance]], [[mathematical physics]], and [[fluid dynamics]]. A special feature of the Institute is its highly interdisciplinary character \u2014 with courses, seminars, and active research collaborations in areas such as [[financial mathematics]], materials science, visual neural science, atmosphere/ocean science, cardiac fluid dynamics, plasma physics, and mathematical genomics. Another special feature is the central role of [[analysis]], which provides a natural bridge between pure and applied mathematics. The Department of Computer Science has strengths in multimedia, programming languages and systems, distributed and parallel computing, and the [[analysis of algorithms]].\n\nSince 1948, Courant Institute has maintained its own research journal, [[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]], which currently has the highest impact factor internationally among mathematics journals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/78504520/issue |title=Wiley Online Library |publisher=.interscience.wiley.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>   While the journal represents the full spectrum of the Institute's mathematical research activity, most articles are in  the fields of applied mathematics, mathematical analysis, or mathematical physics. Its contents over the years amount to a modern history of the theory of partial differential equations. Most articles originate within the Institute or are specially invited. The Institute also  publishes its own series of lecture notes. They are based on the research interests of the faculty and visitors of the   Institute, originated in advanced graduate courses and mini-courses offered at the Institute.\n\n==Resources==\n[[File:Applied Mathematics Lab.jpg|thumb|Applied Mathematics Laboratory]]\n\n===Warren Weaver Hall & 60 Fifth Avenue===\nCIMS consists of the [[NYU]] Departments of Mathematics and Computer Science as well as a variety of research activities.

He was given the task of building up the Department of Mathematics at the [[NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science]]. He was later joined by [[Kurt O. Friedrichs]] and James J. Stoker. In 1946, the department was renamed \"Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics\". Also in 1946, NYU Professor [[Morris Kline]] focused on mathematical problems of electromagnetic wave propagation. This project gave rise to the Institute's Division of Wave Propagation and Applied Mathematics. In 1952, the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] installed one of the first (electronic) computers at New York University, which led to the creation of the Courant Mathematics and Computing Laboratory. The Division of Magnetofluid Dynamics was initiated by a project on plasma fusion by NYU Professor [[Harold Grad]] in 1954.  The Institute was in the forefront of advanced hardware use, with an early [[IBM 7094]] and the fourth produced [[CDC 6600]].  The Division of [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] was created in 1978, arising from a project of NYU Professor [[Paul Garabedian|Paul R. Garabedian]].\n\n==Directors==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Image\n! Name\n!

For the PhD program, every PhD computer science student must receive a grade of A or A- on the final examination for algorithms, systems, applications, and a PhD-level course chosen by the student that does not satisfy the first three requirements, such as cryptography and numerical methods. Students may take the final exam for any these courses without being enrolled in the course.\n\nThe Computer Science Masters program offers instruction in the fundamental principles, design and applications of computer systems and computer technologies. Students who obtain an MS degree in computer science are qualified to do significant development work in the computer industry or important application areas. Those who receive a doctoral degree are in a position to hold faculty appointments and do research and development work at the forefront of this rapidly changing and expanding field. The emphasis for the MS in Information Systems program is on the use of computer systems in business. For the Master of Science in Scientific Computing, it is designed to provide broad training in areas related to scientific computing using modern computing technology and mathematical modeling arising in various applications. The core of the curriculum for all computer science graduate students consists of courses in algorithms, programming languages, compilers, artificial intelligence, database systems, and operating systems. Advanced courses are offered in many areas such as natural language processing, the theory of computation, computer vision, software engineering, compiler optimization techniques, computer graphics, distributed computing, multimedia, networks, cryptography and security, groupware and [[computational finance]]. Adjunct faculty, drawn from outside academia, teach special topics courses in their areas of expertise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/graduate/overview |title=NYU Computer Science Department > Graduate Programs in Computer Science |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\nUnless outside fellowships or scholarships are available to the students, all admitted Courant PhD students are granted with the GSAS MacCracken award.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.math.nyu.edu/dynamic/phd/admissions-financial-support/financial-support/|title=Financial Support - Department of Mathematics - NYU Courant|author=|date=|website=www.math.nyu.edu}}</ref> The fellowship covers the tuition and provides 9 months of stipend along with other benefits such as health insurance and special housing opportunies.

Courant undergraduate students through the years and alumni contribute greatly to the vitality of the Mathematics and Computer Science departments. Some accomplishments by current and former undergraduate Courant students include an Apple Worldwide Developers Conference Scholarship Winner, development of Object Category Recognition Techniques to sort garbage for recycling for the NYC's trash program, placement in 7th out of 42 in the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), and inventors of the [[Diaspora (software)]] social network.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nThe undergraduate division of the Department of Mathematics offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in Mathematics. It consists of a wide variety of courses in pure and applied mathematics taught by a distinguished faculty with a tradition of excellence in teaching and research. Students in advanced coursework often participate in formulating models outside the field of mathematics as well as in analyzing them. For example, an advanced mathematics course in Computers in Medicine and Biology requires a student to construct two computer models selected from the following list: circulation, gas exchange in the lung, control of cell volume, and the renal countercurrent mechanism. The student uses the models to conduct simulated physiological experiments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:vGj-HafADLoJ:math.nyu.edu/degree/undergrad/Math%2520major%2520bulletin%25202010-11%2520Final.pdf+Math+undergraduate+nyu+requirements&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESi4x3xv-_X-4B0Xil4BidRNWKCKg9smDHdaXmhcPNv2gRXB173WgH0mNEM6D-RGr6C-oEz4XoRNBZvoWRQ_RWpcHpNzWxe06LDC0hc2wG0Yi5rf6AFY3cYBVAKb3_wZ-EJjvU6I&sig=AHIEtbSCuQUYJiy-dq4Yg8t8z5z6AnV2Ig |title=Powered by Google Docs |publisher=Docs.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\nThe undergraduate division of the Department of Computer Science offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, and fours minors.

Two specific combined degrees are the joint major in computer science/economics and the joint major in computer science/mathematics. The Department of Computer Science also offers a BS/BE Dual Degree in computer science and engineering and an accelerated master's program available to qualifying undergraduates in conjunction with the [[Tandon School of Engineering]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/overview |title=NYU Computer Science Department > Undergraduate CS Program Overview |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\n===Graduation===\nThe Courant Institute encourages students at any stage of their studies, including the very early stage, to seek summer employment opportunities at various government and industry facilities. In the past few years, Courant students have taken summer internships at the National Institute of Health, Los Alamos National Laboratory,  Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and NASA, as well as Wall Street firms. Such opportunities can greatly expand students' understanding of the mathematical sciences, offer them possible areas of interest for thesis research, and enhance their career options. Members of the faculty (and in particular the students' academic advisors) can assist students in finding appropriate summer employment. All graduate students are given official advisers, and  undergraduates are provided mentors from Courant faculty.\n\n===Academic research===\n[[File:Games for Learning Institute.jpg|thumb|The Courant Institute along with Microsoft Research are the founders of the Games for Learning Institute]]\nThe Department of Mathematics at Courant occupies a leading position in analysis and applied mathematics, including [[partial differential equations]], [[differential geometry]], [[dynamical systems]], [[probability]] and [[stochastic processes]], [[scientific computation]], [[mathematical finance]], [[mathematical physics]], and [[fluid dynamics]]. A special feature of the Institute is its highly interdisciplinary character \u2014 with courses, seminars, and active research collaborations in areas such as [[financial mathematics]], materials science, visual neural science, atmosphere/ocean science, cardiac fluid dynamics, plasma physics, and mathematical genomics. Another special feature is the central role of [[analysis]], which provides a natural bridge between pure and applied mathematics. The Department of Computer Science has strengths in multimedia, programming languages and systems, distributed and parallel computing, and the [[analysis of algorithms]].\n\nSince 1948, Courant Institute has maintained its own research journal, [[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]], which currently has the highest impact factor internationally among mathematics journals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/78504520/issue |title=Wiley Online Library |publisher=.interscience.wiley.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>   While the journal represents the full spectrum of the Institute's mathematical research activity, most articles are in  the fields of applied mathematics, mathematical analysis, or mathematical physics. Its contents over the years amount to a modern history of the theory of partial differential equations. Most articles originate within the Institute or are specially invited. The Institute also  publishes its own series of lecture notes. They are based on the research interests of the faculty and visitors of the   Institute, originated in advanced graduate courses and mini-courses offered at the Institute.\n\n==Resources==\n[[File:Applied Mathematics Lab.jpg|thumb|Applied Mathematics Laboratory]]\n\n===Warren Weaver Hall & 60 Fifth Avenue===\nCIMS consists of the [[NYU]] Departments of Mathematics and Computer Science as well as a variety of research activities.

He was given the task of building up the Department of Mathematics at the [[NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science]]. He was later joined by [[Kurt O. Friedrichs]] and James J. Stoker. In 1946, the department was renamed \"Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics\". Also in 1946, NYU Professor [[Morris Kline]] focused on mathematical problems of electromagnetic wave propagation. This project gave rise to the Institute's Division of Wave Propagation and Applied Mathematics. In 1952, the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] installed one of the first (electronic) computers at New York University, which led to the creation of the Courant Mathematics and Computing Laboratory. The Division of Magnetofluid Dynamics was initiated by a project on plasma fusion by NYU Professor [[Harold Grad]] in 1954.  The Institute was in the forefront of advanced hardware use, with an early [[IBM 7094]] and the fourth produced [[CDC 6600]].  The Division of [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] was created in 1978, arising from a project of NYU Professor [[Paul Garabedian|Paul R. Garabedian]].\n\n==Directors==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Image\n! Name\n!

Since its admission to statehood in 1845, [[Texas]] has participated in every U.S. presidential election except the election of 1864 during the [[American Civil War]], when the state had seceded to join the Confederacy, and the election of 1868, when the state was undergoing [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]].\n\nIn its first century Texas was a Democratic bastion, only voting for another party once \u2013 in 1928 when anti-Catholic sentiment against Al Smith drove voters to Republican Herbert Hoover. A gradual trend towards increasing social liberalism in the Democratic Party, however, has turned the state (apart from Hispanic [[South Texas]], the [[Trans-Pecos]] and several large cities) into a Republican stronghold. Since 1980 Texas has voted [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] in every election.\n\nWinners of the state are in '''bold'''.\n\n==Elections from 1864 to present==\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!
