Party activists in the general election believed that much of his vote had come from the Millwall area and began to focus on the area in their canvassing.  The BNP candidate in the election for [[Bethnal Green and Stepney]], [[Richard Edmonds]], was nicknamed \"The Commander\" for his use of local knowledge to target Millwall as an area sympathetic to the BNP\n\nLater in the same year, a by-election took place in Millwall on 1 October 1992, due to the resignation of Cllr Walker.  A British National Party candidate stood for the council ward for the first time. They received their highest vote share of any election at the time, taking 20% of the vote.<ref>N.

He later denied \"hyping up\" the victory.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=55-56}}\n\nThere was widespread condemnation from politicians, religious leaders and the media of the result.  Many explanations were offered to explain why the residents of Millwall would vote for a neo-Nazi party, including the manipulation of the racial issue by other local parties, the parochialism of the Isle of Dogs and the changes that the area was experiencing as many residents were in poverty but also in close proximity to the prosperity of the new [[Canary Wharf]] development.  The [[Home Secretary]] at the time, [[Michael Howard]], called the result \"an isolated event caused by a combination of particular local circumstances.\"  One journalist in ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' referred to voters in the Millwall ward as \"a peculiar breed: insular, proud of their docklands heritage and identity as a community, and notoriously suspicious of 'outsiders'.\"<ref>''Time Out'', 29 September 1993</ref>  Copsey has argued that these analyses appear \"na\u00efve\" given subsequent victories by the BNP in [[Blackburn]], [[Burnley]], [[Stoke-on-Trent]] and [[Barking and Dagenham]].{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=55-56}}\n\nRoger Eatwell included the result in an analysis of far-right successes across Europe, and formulated a three-dimensional \"efficacy-legitimacy-trust\" model.  The model gives three main reasons why voters choose the far-right: they see an extreme force as having an efficacy for making changes; they gain legitimacy from the use of racial politics by other parties, as occurred in the prelude to the Millwall result; and they have lost trust in the established parties.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=64-65}}  Coswell criticises this model as not explaining why there was such a big increase in the BNP vote between 1992 and 1993.  He points out that, despite a lack of \"efficacy\" from Beackon after his election, his vote still increased between 1993 and 1994, and he was only defeated because mobilisation by the Labour Party led to an exceptionally high turnout.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=65}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nBeackon gained a reputation as a poor representative after his election, often expressing ignorance about the council's debates or how the bureaucracy operated.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=65}} Beackon lost his seat in the [[Tower Hamlets Council election, 1994|next election]] after a large increase in turnout increased the actual BNP vote, but increased the Labour vote further to retake the seat.<ref name=\"ElectionMLW\" />  The British National Party performed strongly in 1994 in general, but subsequently became divided over the behaviour of its military wing, [[Combat 18]] - a body that Beackon was responsible for and which made up much of the local party membership in Millwall.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=66}}  Combat 18 began to use violence against members of the BNP who were perceived as not genuine supporters of the neo-Nazi movement, such as [[Eddy Butler]] and [[Tony Lecomber]].{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=67}}  The BNP would not win any elected seats again until they won three in [[Burnley]] in 2002.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1965535.stm</ref>\n\nBeackon did not re-stand for election until 2008 when he took 17.8% of the vote in Orsett ward on [[Thurrock]] council.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thurrock.gov.uk/democracy/content.php?page=wrds&ID=12 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330143718/http://www.thurrock.gov.uk/democracy/content.php?page=wrds&ID=12 |archivedate=2009-03-30 }}</ref>\n\n{{Election box begin |\n  |title=Millwall election, 1994}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = Labour Party (UK)\n  |candidate  = Julia Mainwaring\n  |votes      = 3,547\n  |percentage = \n  |change     = \n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = Labour Party (UK)\n  |candidate  = Martin Young\n  |votes      = 3,447\n  |percentage = \n  |change     = \n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = Labour Party (UK)\n  |candidate  = Stephen Molyneaux\n  |votes      = 3,446\n  |percentage = \n  |change     = \n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = British National Party\n  |candidate  = Derek Beackon\n  |votes      = 2,041\n  |percentage = \n  |change     = \n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = British National Party\n  |candidate  = Gordon Callow\n  |votes      = 1,775\n  |percentage = \n  |change     = \n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = British National Party\n  |candidate  = A.

Many explanations were offered to explain why the residents of Millwall would vote for a neo-Nazi party, including the manipulation of the racial issue by other local parties, the parochialism of the Isle of Dogs and the changes that the area was experiencing as many residents were in poverty but also in close proximity to the prosperity of the new [[Canary Wharf]] development.  The [[Home Secretary]] at the time, [[Michael Howard]], called the result \"an isolated event caused by a combination of particular local circumstances.\"  One journalist in ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' referred to voters in the Millwall ward as \"a peculiar breed: insular, proud of their docklands heritage and identity as a community, and notoriously suspicious of 'outsiders'.\"<ref>''Time Out'', 29 September 1993</ref>  Copsey has argued that these analyses appear \"na\u00efve\" given subsequent victories by the BNP in [[Blackburn]], [[Burnley]], [[Stoke-on-Trent]] and [[Barking and Dagenham]].{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=55-56}}\n\nRoger Eatwell included the result in an analysis of far-right successes across Europe, and formulated a three-dimensional \"efficacy-legitimacy-trust\" model.  The model gives three main reasons why voters choose the far-right: they see an extreme force as having an efficacy for making changes; they gain legitimacy from the use of racial politics by other parties, as occurred in the prelude to the Millwall result; and they have lost trust in the established parties.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|pp=64-65}}  Coswell criticises this model as not explaining why there was such a big increase in the BNP vote between 1992 and 1993.  He points out that, despite a lack of \"efficacy\" from Beackon after his election, his vote still increased between 1993 and 1994, and he was only defeated because mobilisation by the Labour Party led to an exceptionally high turnout.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=65}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nBeackon gained a reputation as a poor representative after his election, often expressing ignorance about the council's debates or how the bureaucracy operated.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=65}} Beackon lost his seat in the [[Tower Hamlets Council election, 1994|next election]] after a large increase in turnout increased the actual BNP vote, but increased the Labour vote further to retake the seat.<ref name=\"ElectionMLW\" />  The British National Party performed strongly in 1994 in general, but subsequently became divided over the behaviour of its military wing, [[Combat 18]] - a body that Beackon was responsible for and which made up much of the local party membership in Millwall.{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=66}}  Combat 18 began to use violence against members of the BNP who were perceived as not genuine supporters of the neo-Nazi movement, such as [[Eddy Butler]] and [[Tony Lecomber]].{{sfn|Copsey|2008|p=67}}  The BNP would not win any elected seats again until they won three in [[Burnley]] in 2002.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1965535.stm</ref>  \n\nBeackon did not re-stand for election until 2008 when he took 17.8% of the vote in Orsett ward on [[Thurrock]] council.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thurrock.gov.uk/democracy/content.php?page=wrds&ID=12 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330143718/http://www.thurrock.gov.uk/democracy/content.php?page=wrds&ID=12 |archivedate=2009-03-30 }}</ref>\n\n{{Election box begin |\n  |title=Millwall election, 1994}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = Labour Party (UK)\n  |candidate  = Julia Mainwaring\n  |votes      = 3,547\n  |percentage = \n  |change     = \n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = Labour Party (UK)\n  |candidate  = Martin Young\n  |votes      = 3,447\n  |percentage = \n  |change     = \n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = Labour Party (UK)\n  |candidate  = Stephen Molyneaux\n  |votes      = 3,446\n  |percentage = \n  |change     = \n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = British National Party\n  |candidate  = Derek Beackon\n  |votes      = 2,041\n  |percentage = \n  |change     = \n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = British National Party\n  |candidate  = Gordon Callow\n  |votes      = 1,775\n  |percentage = \n  |change     = \n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n  |party      = British National Party\n  |candidate  = A.

It is one of three genera in its family, all [[poisonous spiders|venomous spiders]] known for a bite that can induce [[loxoscelism]]. They live in deserts and arid regions of the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and females use a mixture of sand and silk when producing egg sacs. Most are native to South America, with the exception of Central America's ''S. rugosus'',<ref name=NMBE /> known primarily for its self-burying behavior.\n\n==Description==\n''Sicarius'' spiders can grow up to {{convert|1|to|2|in}} long, and have six eyes arranged into three groups of two (known as \"dyads\"). Physically, they resemble [[Thomisidae|crab spiders]] and members of ''[[Homalonychus]]'', but they lack the characteristic violin-shaped marking of the more well-known members of its family, [[Sicariidae]] the [[recluse spiders]].\n\nThey can live for a very long time without food or water. Some can live for up to fifteen years, making them among the longest-lived spiders, behind the trap-door spiders and tarantulas, many known to live for twenty to thirty years. The oldest recorded spider is [[Number_16_(spider)|Number 16]], a trap-door spider that died to a parasitic wasp at forty-three years old.<ref>{{cite web| publisher=National Geographic| url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:qAGU2Jg_wXIJ:https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/04/worlds-oldest-spider-dies-trapdoor-spider-australia-43-animals-spd/+&cd=5&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us| accessdate=2020-04-11| title=World\u2019s Oldest Known Spider Dies at 43, With Lesson for Us}}</ref>\n\n===Venom components and effects===\nLike all recluse spiders, these produce a [[Necrosis|dermonecrotic]] [[venom (poison)|venom]] that contains [[sphingomyelinase D]], an [[enzyme]] in the [[sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase]] family.

It is one of three genera in its family, all [[poisonous spiders|venomous spiders]] known for a bite that can induce [[loxoscelism]]. They live in deserts and arid regions of the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and females use a mixture of sand and silk when producing egg sacs. Most are native to South America, with the exception of Central America's ''S. rugosus'',<ref name=NMBE /> known primarily for its self-burying behavior.\n\n==Description==\n''Sicarius'' spiders can grow up to {{convert|1|to|2|in}} long, and have six eyes arranged into three groups of two, known as \"dyads\". Physically, they resemble [[Thomisidae|crab spiders]] and members of ''[[Homalonychus]]'', but they lack the characteristic violin-shaped marking of the more well-known members of its family, the [[Latrodectus|widow spiders]].\n\nThey can live for a very long time without food or water. Some can live for up to fifteen years, making them among the longest-lived spiders, behind the trap-door spiders and tarantulas, many known to live for twenty to thirty years. The oldest recorded spider is [[Number_16_(spider)|Number 16]], a trap-door spider that died to a parasitic wasp at forty-three years old.<ref>{{cite web| publisher=National Geographic| url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:qAGU2Jg_wXIJ:https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/04/worlds-oldest-spider-dies-trapdoor-spider-australia-43-animals-spd/+&cd=5&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us| accessdate=2020-04-11| title=World\u2019s Oldest Known Spider Dies at 43, With Lesson for Us}}</ref>\n\n===Venom components and effects===\nLike all recluse spiders, these produce a [[Necrosis|dermonecrotic]] [[venom (poison)|venom]] that contains [[sphingomyelinase D]], an [[enzyme]] in the [[sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase]] family. It is somewhat unique to them, otherwise only found in a few [[pathogenic bacteria]]. The venom causes [[hemorrhage|bleeding]] and damage to many organs of the body, though only ''[[Sicarius ornatus|S. ornatus]]'' and a few others have been proven to be extremely toxic on the order of ''[[Hexophtalma hahni]]'' or several other African sand spiders.<ref name=MagaBresSant17>{{cite journal| last1=Magalh\u00e3es| first1=I.L.F.| last2=Brescovit| first2=A.D.| last3=Santos| first3=A.J.| year=2017| title=Phylogeny of Sicariidae spiders (Araneae: Haplogynae), with a monograph on Neotropical ''Sicarius'' |journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society| volume=179| issue=4| pages=767\u2013864| url=https://academic.oup.com/zoolinnean/article/179/4/767/3076119| accessdate=2018-07-20| lastauthoramp=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThis genus was erected by [[Charles Athanase Walckenaer]] in 1847 with the single species, ''[[Sicarius thomisoides|S.&nbsp;thomisoides]]''.<ref name=Walc1847>{{citation| last=Walckenaer| first=C.

Emergency services, naval forces, and civilian vessels from around the west side of the [[English Channel]] were summoned to aid what became the largest ever [[rescue operation]] in peace-time.

Chicago AC was considered, according to the Indianapolis Journal, one of the best teams of the west (more specifically Midwest) besides Michigan University.  The contest was 50 minutes long, with two 25 minute halves.  Chicago AC (Also known as Chicago Athletic Association, or C.A.A) scored all of there 16 points against the Light Artillerymen in the first half.  Not more than 400 people were said to have braved the icy cold wind to spectate the contest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322142438/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football|title=20 Oct 1895, 3 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>\n\n===October 24- Indiana===\n\nOn October 23rd the Indianapolis Light Artillery football team set out for Bloomington for there first collegiate contest of the year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322143756/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football|title=23 Oct 1895, 8 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>  Coming into the game, Indiana was 2\u20130, having won easy contests against the Louisville and Noblesville Athletic clubs, by scores of 36-0 and 30-0 respectively (two teams the Light Artillery would beat later in the season).  The weather was cool and cloudy.  The game was an hour long, with 60 minute halves.  The halftime score was 10\u20134, and the final was 16\u20138.  One of the touchdowns scored for Indiana was by player-coach William Osgood<ref name=\"auto\"/>, who would go on to assist the Light Artillery in the remainder of their football season<ref name=\"auto7\"/>, presumably when Robert Wrenn was hired as the new head coach for Indiana.  Indiana would finish with a casual 4-3-1, although they did manage to secure their first intercollegiate win since the program was established in 1887 by beating Rose Polytechnic 8\u20134.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/active/i/indiana/1895-1899_yearly_results.php|title=Indiana Yearly Results|website=www.cfbdatawarehouse.com}}</ref>\n\n===November 1st- Knightstown Club===\n\nThis unofficial matchup was played between a handful of players from Butler and Indianapolis Light Artillery against the Knightstown Club on the first day of November.  Heralded as the most exciting and interesting game of football seen in  Indianapolis for the 1895 season, 1500 spectators showed up for the exhibition.  Knightstown scored first, going up 6\u20130, before they were tied 6-6 right before the half.  The club would ultimately prevail though, beating the mix of college and semi-professional football players 12\u20136.<ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\n===November 2nd- Noblesville AC===\n\nThe game was played in Indianapolis, in the same ball park as the one against Chicago AC.  Noblesville came in with at least one loss to Indiana, and that is all that is known about the rather obscure program.  Surrounded by an apparently riotous crowd, the Indianapolis Light Artillery eleven met the Athletic Club's eleven on the afternoon of November 2nd.  by halftime, the score was a tight 6\u20134 in favor of the Artillerymen, but the military team blew away the athletic club in the 2nd half, securing their 3rd official victory, 22\u20134.<ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\n===November 17th- Louisville AC===\n\nA good matchup between the ILA and the Louisville AC was played in Louisville in front of a sizeable crowd of 800 on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  The contest was 70 minutes long, with two 35 minute halves.  The Artillery men scored early points in the first half to go up 10\u20130, before Louisville rallied with two field goals to usurp the military team, 12\u201310 at the half in favor of the AC.  This was the first time since Chicago AC that the Light Artillery had faced a halftime deficit.  The military team came out of the 2nd half with 10 unanswered points by left halfback Thompson and kicker Don Scott to win 20\u201312.  <ref name=\"auto7\"/>\n\n===November 22nd- Notre Dame===\n\nIn a minor upset, The Indianapolis Light Artillery beat Notre Dame college 18\u20130, on their own Cartier Field in South Bend.  This game is famous because of HG Haddon, coach of the 1895 Notre Dame football team, who inserted himself into the line-up as a left tackle, gaining considerable ground on the semi-professionals before the end of the game through a returned kickoff, recovering a fumble, and a number of other carries.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nyg3NJ4VVuAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |title = Fighting Irish: Legends, Lists, and Lore|isbn = 9781582617527|last1 = Heisler|first1 = Karen Croake|year = 2006}}</ref>  Immediately after the game, the ILA left for Chicago for a rematch with the Chicago Athletic Association's football team.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\n===November 23rd- Chicago AC===\n\nIn the 2nd contest between the two teams, Chicago AC won by a narrow margin of 4 to 0.  The day was cold and icy, with only 500 spectators coming to watch the event in Chicago.  The game was 40 minutes long, with two 20 minute halves.  After a scoreless half, Chicago scored a controversial touchdown that awarded them the 4 points they needed to win.  The Light Artillery blamed the Linesman for bad officiating and bias towards the Chicago team, as one of the Linesman was a brother of a Chicago AC player.  <ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n===Thanksgiving Day Game- Butler===\n\nThe Indianapolis Light Artillery destroyed Butler to close out the 1895 season at the East Ohio-Street grounds in Indianapolis.  The game was over from the start, with the Butler players apparently unable to move the ball without penalties, and a 22-0 ILA lead by the half.  The game was 70 minutes long, with two 35 minute halves.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n== References ==\n<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/years/1894-schedule.html |title = 1894 Schedule and Results}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [[1895 Notre Dame football team]]\n* [[1895 Indiana Hoosiers football team]]\n[[Category:1895 college football season]]\n\n[[Category:1895 in sports in Indiana|1895 in sports in Indiana]]\n\n{{uncategorised|date=April 2020}}\n", "text_old": "{{copy edit|date=April 2020}}\n{{short description|American military football team}}\n{{Infobox NCAA team season\n| year = 1895\n| team = Indianapolis Light Artillery\n| sport = football\n| image =\n| image_size =\n| conference = Independent\n| record = 5-2\n| head_coach = [[Winchester Osgood]]\n| gm = [[Robert Navin]]\n| hc_year = 1st\n| stadium = East Ohio Street Baseball Park\n| captain = Harold Joss (Right Tackle)\n}}\n\n==Overview==\n\nThe '''1895 Indianapolis Light Artillery football team''' was an [[American football]] team that represented the [[Indianapolis Light Artillery]] in the [[1895 college football season]].<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/search/|title=Newspapers.com search|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>  The team compiled a 5\u20132 record and outscored its opponents, 108 to 46.\nThe Artillery team had been playing since at least 1894, with contests against Purdue, Illinois, Chicago AC, and Butler on Thanksgiving.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Their team manager was Robert (Bob) Navin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322134853/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football|title=6 Oct 1895, 14 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>  One October 18th article in the 1895 Indianapolis Journal asserted that the average weight of the Light Artillery eleven was 178 pounds, and that the team consisted of several former collegiate football players who had finished their college days.

Chicago AC was considered, according to the Indianapolis Journal, one of the best teams of the west (more specifically Midwest) besides Michigan University.  The contest was 50 minutes long, with two 25 minute halves.  Chicago AC (Also known as Chicago Athletic Association, or C.A.A) scored all of there 16 points against the Light Artillerymen in the first half.  Not more than 400 people were said to have braved the icy cold wind to spectate the contest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322142438/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football|title=20 Oct 1895, 3 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>\n\n===October 24- Indiana===\n\nOn October 23rd the Indianapolis Light Artillery football team set out for Bloomington for there first collegiate contest of the year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322143756/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football|title=23 Oct 1895, 8 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>  Coming into the game, Indiana was 2\u20130, having won easy contests against the Louisville and Noblesville Athletic clubs, by scores of 36-0 and 30-0 respectively (two teams the Light Artillery would beat later in the season).  The weather was cool and cloudy.  The game was an hour long, with 60 minute halves.  The halftime score was 10\u20134, and the final was 16\u20138.  One of the touchdowns scored for Indiana was by player-coach William Osgood<ref name=\"auto\"/>, who would go on to assist the Light Artillery in the remainder of their football season<ref name=\"auto7\"/>, presumably when Robert Wrenn was hired as the new head coach for Indiana.  Indiana would finish with a casual 4-3-1, although they did manage to secure their first intercollegiate win since the program was established in 1887 by beating Rose Polytechnic 8\u20134.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/active/i/indiana/1895-1899_yearly_results.php|title=Indiana Yearly Results|website=www.cfbdatawarehouse.com}}</ref>\n\n===November 1st- Knightstown Club===\n\nThis unofficial matchup was played between a handful of players from Butler and Indianapolis Light Artillery against the Knightstown Club on the first day of November.  Heralded as the most exciting and interesting game of football seen in  Indianapolis for the 1895 season, 1500 spectators showed up for the exhibition.  Knightstown scored first, going up 6\u20130, before they were tied 6-6 right before the half.  The club would ultimately prevail though, beating the mix of college and semi-professional football players 12\u20136.<ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\n===November 2nd- Noblesville AC===\n\nThe game was played in Indianapolis, in the same ball park as the one against Chicago AC.  Noblesville came in with at least one loss to Indiana, and that is all that is known about the rather obscure program.  Surrounded by an apparently riotous crowd, the Indianapolis Light Artillery eleven met the Athletic Club's eleven on the afternoon of November 2nd.  by halftime, the score was a tight 6\u20134 in favor of the Artillerymen, but the military team blew away the athletic club in the 2nd half, securing their 3rd official victory, 22\u20134.<ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\n===November 17th- Louisville AC===\n\nA good matchup between the ILA and the Louisville AC was played in Louisville in front of a sizeable crowd of 800 on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  The contest was 70 minutes long, with two 35 minute halves.  The Artillery men scored early points in the first half to go up 10\u20130, before Louisville rallied with two field goals to usurp the military team, 12\u201310 at the half in favor of the AC.  This was the first time since Chicago AC that the Light Artillery had faced a halftime deficit.  The military team came out of the 2nd half with 10 unanswered points by left halfback Thompson and kicker Don Scott to win 20\u201312.  <ref name=\"auto7\"/>\n\n===November 22nd- Notre Dame===\n\nIn a minor upset, The Indianapolis Light Artillery beat Notre Dame college 18\u20130, on their own Cartier Field in South Bend.  This game is famous because of HG Haddon, coach of the 1895 Notre Dame football team, who inserted himself into the line-up as a left tackle, gaining considerable ground on the semi-professionals before the end of the game through a returned kickoff, recovering a fumble, and a number of other carries.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nyg3NJ4VVuAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |title = Fighting Irish: Legends, Lists, and Lore|isbn = 9781582617527|last1 = Heisler|first1 = Karen Croake|year = 2006}}</ref>  Immediately after the game, the ILA left for Chicago for a rematch with the Chicago Athletic Association's football team.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\n===November 23rd- Chicago AC===\n\nIn the 2nd contest between the two teams, Chicago AC won by a narrow margin of 4 to 0.  The day was cold and icy, with only 500 spectators coming to watch the event in Chicago.  The game was 40 minutes long, with two 20 minute halves.  After a scoreless half, Chicago scored a controversial touchdown that awarded them the 4 points they needed to win.  The Light Artillery blamed the Linesman for bad officiating and bias towards the Chicago team, as one of the Linesman was a brother of a Chicago AC player.  <ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n===Thanksgiving Day Game- Butler===\n\nThe Indianapolis Light Artillery destroyed Butler to close out the 1895 season at the East Ohio-Street grounds in Indianapolis.  The game was over from the start, with the Butler players apparently unable to move the ball without penalties, and a 22-0 ILA lead by the half.
