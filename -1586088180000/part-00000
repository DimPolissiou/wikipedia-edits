Over a 10-year period, more than 1,000 Japanese miners relocated to the region, confined to a strictly male-only camp. Arriving without family or spouses, the men often sought social interaction outside the confines of their camps. In search of intimacy with the opposite sex, resulting in cohabitation, the men openly engaged in [[interracial dating]] and relationships, a practice embraced by the local society. As a result, a number of Japanese miners fathered children with Native Congolese women. However, most of the mixed race infants resulting from these unions died, soon after birth. Multiple testimonies of local people suggest that the infants were poisoned by a Japanese lead physician and nurse working at the local mining hospital. Subsequently, the circumstances would have brought the miners shame as most of them already had families back in their native Japan. The practice forced many native Katangan mothers to hide their children by not reporting to the hospital to give birth.\n\nToday, fifty Afro-Japanese have formed an association of ''Katanga Infanticide'' survivors. The organization has hired legal counsel seeking a formal investigation into the killings. The group submitted an official inquiry to both the [[National Assembly (Democratic Republic of the Congo)|Congolese]] and [[Government of Japan|Japanese]] governments, to no avail. Issues specific to this group include having no documentation of their births since not having been born in the local hospital spared their lives. The total number of survivors is unknown.<ref name=\"katangainfanticide\" group=\"Africa-Congo\"/>\n\n===Equatorial Guinea===\nThe mid-19th century saw about 500 Chinese laborers and indentured servants, along with a handful from [[Portuguese India|India]] stealthily imported to the island of [[Bioko|Fernando Po]] through the once [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] owned [[Macau]].<ref name=\"anshan\" group=\"Africa-EQ\"/> While most of these servants returned to their homelands at the end of their servitude, a few remained, settling and marrying into the local population. One example is immigrant East Indian laborer Francisco Kashu Alimama who remained in [[Moka, Equatorial Guinea|Moka]] after the death of his last living relative. He married the daughter of one of the last [[Malabo Lopelo Melaka|Bubi]] kings, producing several Indo-Equatoguinean children.\n\n===Kenya===\n{{See also|Chinese people in Kenya|Indians in Kenya|Pate Island}}\n\n====Zheng He's fleet====\nIn 1999, [[Nicholas Kristof]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported a surprising encounter on the island of [[Pate Island|Pate]], where he found a village of stone huts. He talked to an elderly man living in the village who said that he was a descendant of Chinese explorers who were shipwrecked there [[Ming treasure voyages|centuries before]]. The Chinese had supposedly traded with the locals and had even loaded giraffes onto their ship to take back to China. However, the Chinese ran aground on a nearby reef. Kristof found evidence that confirmed the man's story. Such evidence included the Asian features of the people in the village, plus Asian-looking porcelain artifacts.<ref name=\"nytkristof\" group=\"Africa-Kenya\"/><ref name=\"pbshdingham\" group=\"Africa-Kenya\"/> These descendants of [[Chinese people in Kenya#Zheng He's fleet|Zheng He's fleet]] occupy both [[Pate Island|Pate]] and [[Lamu Island|Lamu]] Islands.\n\n====New immigration====\nNew interest in Kenya's natural resources has attracted over $1 billion of investment from Chinese firms. This has propelled new development in Kenya's infrastructure with Chinese firms bringing in their own male workers to build roads.<ref name=kenyainvestment group=Africa-Kenya/> The temporary residents usually arrive without their spouses and families.

The NFFA Officers, who will have a two-year tenure, are Grace Abrazado, President; Flora Adole, Vice President; Araceli Aipoh, Secretary and Communication Officer; Catalina Jibrin, Treasurer and Finance Officer; Esperanza Ogaga, Events Officer; Leony Ogu, Social Welfare Officer; and Hadiza Garba, Auditor and Logistics Officer. One of the main objectives of the association is to foster solidarity, strengthen friendship, and explore avenues of cooperation among the members of NFFA and their families, as well as with other members of the communities where they live. Membership is open to Filipinos married to Nigerians or Nigerians married to Filipinos, and their children. An annual fee of N6,000 (approximately US$40.00) to cover operating costs is to be paid by each member. In his message, Ambassador Padalhin, who wore a Nigerian attire made of adire for the occasion, congratulated the officers and members of the NFFA for their initiative in founding an association that involves their families, especially, he says, as this will ensure that the NFFA children will have more opportunities to know about Filipino culture. He mentioned about the possibility of the embassy and NFFA collaborating on cultural activities in the future. He said that while posted in Lebanon, he was instrumental in establishing the Filipino Lebanese Families Association. Meanwhile, Mrs. Abrazado said the association intends to work in cooperation with the Filipino community in Nigeria and the Embassy. She is the immediate past President of Pusong Pinoy Association (PPA), and currently the Vice President of the Abuja Branch of Nigerwives Nigeria.

This unique acceptance of Afro-Asians and biracials within the Philippines may be down to the full social integration of Afro-Asians who speak [[Philippine languages]] natively, Filipino familiarity with [[Aeta]]s and other [[Negrito]] indigenous Filipinos who share some facial features and skin tones with Afro-Filipinos, popular affiliation to African-American culture and music as a relatable and non-colonial subculture, or positive Afro-Filipino representation internationally, reflecting their patriotism and affinity to the Philippines.\n\nTheir social positions vary widely, with some living in poor or working class areas, while most are lower middle or upper middle class citizens. Most Afro-Filipinos live in and around [[Metro Manila]], [[Calabarzon]], [[Metro Cebu]], or in [[Olongapo]], [[Clark Freeport and Special Economic Zone|Clark]], or [[Angeles, Philippines|Angeles]] cities in [[Central Luzon]] around the former American bases.\n\nMany Afro-Filipinos represent the Philippines in international events like Southeast Asia's second fastest woman (Canadian-Filipino) [[Katrina Knott]] and gold medalist [[Eric Cray]] (African-American-Filipino) in the 30th [[SEA games]] held in the [[Philippines]] in 2019, or [[Mau Marcelo]], winner of Philippine Idol 2006. Afro-Filipino sportsmen gain popularity within the highly popular [[Philippine Basketball Association]] or on local TV and in the hospitality sectors.\n\nAmong the country's most recognizable Afro-Asians are half African-American/Filipino R&B singers [[Jaya (singer)|Jaya]], [[Mau Marcelo]] and [[Luke Mejares]].\n\n===Saudi Arabia===\nAccording to [[The World Factbook]], around 10% of [[Saudi Arabia]]'s population is of Afro-Asian descent.<ref name=\"CIATONGA\">{{cite web|url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sa.html|title= Middle East :: SAUDI ARABIA|publisher= CIA The World Factbook}}</ref> Most Afro-Asians living in Saudi Arabia are [[Afro-Arab]]s, who occasionally face discrimination due to their dark skin.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/society/2017/3/8/Dark-skinned-and-beautiful-Challenging-Saudi-Arabias-perception-of-beauty |title=The New Arab - Dark-skinned and beautiful: Challenging Saudi Arabia's perception of beauty}}</ref> Marriages between Native Saudi Arabs and Black Africans are quite common in Saudi Arabia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabnews.com/saudi-arabia/news/846736|title=46 Saudis marry African women|date=7 December 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Singapore===\nMixed marriages between ethnic Asians and foreigners are becoming more common in Singapore.

The part-Negro tots, whose G.I. fathers fought with the UN forces, face a dismal future in Korea, where an estimated 85,000 children are homeless as a result of the recent war. Housed in poorly-equipped orphanages, they are \"unwanted\" and looked down upon by the Orientals. Government officials charged that some of the mixed-blood children are denied sufficient food by Koreans, who argue that \"there is no need to give them food that is so much needed by our own children.\" In some places the children are not permitted to attend school. Because of the tragic situation, welfare aides believe that one of the best solutions to the problem is to bring the part-Negro orphans to the U.S. However, refugee program aide Harry B. Lyford said, \"Very few inquiries have come so far from prospective adoptive parents.\" To spur such an adoption program, government officials announced they will help U.S. Negro families interested in adopting the children and that all inquiries should be addressed to Lyrford at the Refugee Relief Program, State Department, Washington, D.C.\n|accessdate=14 May 2012\n|publisher=Jet Magazine\n|date=24 March 1955}}</ref>\nOften, the Afro-Korean orphans were purposely starved, as the society deemed mixed-raced children less worthy of food needed by non-mixed Korean children. In some areas, the mixed-raced youth were even denied education. In 1955, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] made a public plea asking American families to open their doors to the ostracized youth and in 1956 the [[Holt Adoption Agency|Holt Adoption Program]] launched a gateway for Christian faith-based adoption of children of G.I. soldiers that also included Eurasian offspring. However, in addition to the race-based discrimination faced in their country of birth, Afro-Korean orphans were still passed over by adopting American families based on skin color preferences.<ref name=hyunjungoh group=Asia-Korea>\n{{cite book\n|last=Hyun Jung Oh\n|first=Arissa\n|title=Into the Arms of America: The Korean Roots of International Adoption\n|year=2011\n|location=Chicago, Illinois\n|isbn=978-1-2439-8826-3\n|page=273\n|quote=This was especially problematic in the case of Korean black children, whose coloring was so important to their placement. In a memo to ISS Korea, Margaret Valk asked bout the possibility of sending better quality photographs to facilitate the adoptions of Korean black children. It has also been recently suggested to us by one of the agencies who may be able to suggest some Negro families for part-Negro children that if the snapshots of part-Negro children could be taken in color as well as in black and white, this would give the families and local agency here a much better idea of the child's skin coloring and help them in the matching process. Of course, this is not foolproof at all. Some colored photographs come out much darker and some much lighter depending upon the way in which they have been taken but with the black and white photograph (which must not be omitted). The adoption agency believes they could do a better job. As you know, the color of the skin is the most important when discussing a child with a Negro family.

In Korea\u2019s society, like most in East Asia, success hinges on the family, particularly on the father, due to the emphasis placed upon and legacy of Confucian values. Growing up without parents, or in many situations with only a mother, has left Afro-Asians ostracized by society. Low educational levels and unemployment run rampant. In his work on Black Koreans, Won Moo Hurh outlines four specific common problems they face: first, their illegitimate status, which is still heavily stigmatized in Korea. Second, their mother\u2019s presumed prostitute and low economic status is looked down upon, even though many women were legally married to their military husbands. Korean society has absorbed the stereotype that all mothers of biracial children are low-class, \"sexual pariahs.\" Third, without a strong family background, there is usually a lack of higher education and subsequent difficulty in finding work. Lastly, Hurh describes their discrimination based on appearance. Facing these problems of marginalization, Black Koreans have naturally taken on a negative self-image.

Over a 10-year period, more than 1,000 Japanese miners relocated to the region, confined to a strictly male-only camp. Arriving without family or spouses, the men often sought social interaction outside the confines of their camps. In search of intimacy with the opposite sex, resulting in cohabitation, the men openly engaged in [[interracial dating]] and relationships, a practice embraced by the local society. As a result, a number of Japanese miners fathered children with Native Congolese women. However, most of the mixed race infants resulting from these unions died, soon after birth. Multiple testimonies of local people suggest that the infants were poisoned by a Japanese lead physician and nurse working at the local mining hospital. Subsequently, the circumstances would have brought the miners shame as most of them already had families back in their native Japan. The practice forced many native Katangan mothers to hide their children by not reporting to the hospital to give birth.\n\nToday, fifty Afro-Japanese have formed an association of ''Katanga Infanticide'' survivors. The organization has hired legal counsel seeking a formal investigation into the killings. The group submitted an official inquiry to both the [[National Assembly (Democratic Republic of the Congo)|Congolese]] and [[Government of Japan|Japanese]] governments, to no avail. Issues specific to this group include having no documentation of their births since not having been born in the local hospital spared their lives. The total number of survivors is unknown.<ref name=\"katangainfanticide\" group=\"Africa-Congo\"/>\n\n===Equatorial Guinea===\nThe mid-19th century saw about 500 Chinese laborers and indentured servants, along with a handful from [[Portuguese India|India]] stealthily imported to the island of [[Bioko|Fernando Po]] through the once [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] owned [[Macau]].<ref name=\"anshan\" group=\"Africa-EQ\"/> While most of these servants returned to their homelands at the end of their servitude, a few remained, settling and marrying into the local population. One example is immigrant East Indian laborer Francisco Kashu Alimama who remained in [[Moka, Equatorial Guinea|Moka]] after the death of his last living relative. He married the daughter of one of the last [[Malabo Lopelo Melaka|Bubi]] kings, producing several Indo-Equatoguinean children.\n\n===Kenya===\n{{See also|Chinese people in Kenya|Indians in Kenya|Pate Island}}\n\n====Zheng He's fleet====\nIn 1999, [[Nicholas Kristof]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported a surprising encounter on the island of [[Pate Island|Pate]], where he found a village of stone huts. He talked to an elderly man living in the village who said that he was a descendant of Chinese explorers who were shipwrecked there [[Ming treasure voyages|centuries before]]. The Chinese had supposedly traded with the locals and had even loaded giraffes onto their ship to take back to China. However, the Chinese ran aground on a nearby reef. Kristof found evidence that confirmed the man's story. Such evidence included the Asian features of the people in the village, plus Asian-looking porcelain artifacts.<ref name=\"nytkristof\" group=\"Africa-Kenya\"/><ref name=\"pbshdingham\" group=\"Africa-Kenya\"/> These descendants of [[Chinese people in Kenya#Zheng He's fleet|Zheng He's fleet]] occupy both [[Pate Island|Pate]] and [[Lamu Island|Lamu]] Islands.\n\n====New immigration====\nNew interest in Kenya's natural resources has attracted over $1 billion of investment from Chinese firms. This has propelled new development in Kenya's infrastructure with Chinese firms bringing in their own male workers to build roads.<ref name=kenyainvestment group=Africa-Kenya/> The temporary residents usually arrive without their spouses and families. Thus, a rise of incidents involving local college-aged females has resulted in an increased rate of Afro-Chinese infant births to single Kenyan mothers.<ref name=\"ruiru\" group=\"Africa-Kenya\"/>\n\nIn Kenya there's worrying trend of the following influx of Chinese male workers in Kenya with a growing number of abandoned babies of Chinese men who fathered children with local women.<ref>Kenya battling with Chinese prostitutes, arrests 15 at brothel[https://face2faceafrica.com/article/kenya-battling-with-chinese-prostitutes-arrests-15-at-brothel]</ref>\n\n===Madagascar===\n{{See also|Malagasy people}}\n[[File:Malagasy girls Madagascar Merina.jpg|thumb|right|Malagasy ethnic [[Merina]] children]]\nThe population of [[Madagascar]] is primarily a mixture of various degrees of [[Austronesia]]n and [[Bantu people|Bantu]] settlers from [[Southeast Asia]] (Borneo) and [[Africa Great Lakes|Southeast Africa]] (primarily Mozambique), respectively.

Established in 1973, the Philippine Barangay Society of Nigeria addresses issues specific to over 1,700 ''Nigerized'' Filipinos living in the country.

One of the main objectives of the association is to foster solidarity, strengthen friendship, and explore avenues of cooperation among the members of NFFA and their families, as well as with other members of the communities where they live. Membership is open to Filipinos married to Nigerians or Nigerians married to Filipinos, and their children. An annual fee of N6,000 (approximately US$40.00) to cover operating costs is to be paid by each member. In his message, Ambassador Padalhin, who wore a Nigerian attire made of adire for the occasion, congratulated the officers and members of the NFFA for their initiative in founding an association that involves their families, especially, he says, as this will ensure that the NFFA children will have more opportunities to know about Filipino culture. He mentioned about the possibility of the embassy and NFFA collaborating on cultural activities in the future. He said that while posted in Lebanon, he was instrumental in establishing the Filipino Lebanese Families Association.

Second, their mother\u2019s presumed prostitute and low economic status is looked down upon, even though many women were legally married to their military husbands.

However, the extent of its actual independence from the Kingdom of Ani is uncertain: it was always in the possession of the relatives of the rulers of Ani, and, after Ani's capture by the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1045, the Bagratuni title \"King of Kings\" held by the ruler of Ani was transferred to the ruler of Kars. In 1064, just after the capture of Ani by [[Alp Arslan]] (leader of the [[Seljuk Turks]]), the Armenian king of Kars, Gagik-Abas, paid homage to the victorious Turks so that they would not lay siege to his city. In 1065 Gagik-Abas ceded his kingdom to the Byzantine Empire, but soon after Kars was taken by the Seljuk Turks.<ref name=\"SAE\"/>\n\nThe Seljuks quickly relinquished direct control over Kars and it became a small emirate whose territory corresponded closely to that of Vanand, and which bordered the similarly created but larger Shaddadid emirate centered at Ani. The Kars emirate was a vassal of the [[Saltukids]] in Erzurum, whose forces were effective in opposing [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgian]] attempts at seizing Kars. Thus, it was only in 1206 that Zakare of the [[Zakarids-Mkhargrzeli]] succeeded in capturing Kars, joining it to their fiefdom of Ani.<ref>{{harvnb|Lordkipanidze|Hewitt|1987|p=135}}.</ref> It was conquered in 1242 by the [[Mongols]]; was regained by Georgian Kingdom during the reign of [[George V of Georgia|George V the Brilliant]] (1314\u20131346), it remained part of the Kingdom before its disintegration, which then passed into the hands of [[Samtskhe-Saatabago|Georgian Atabegs]] belonging to the [[Jaqeli|House of Jaqeli]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} In 1387 the city surrendered to [[Timur]] (Tamerlane) and its fortifications were damaged.

On June 7, 1945, Soviet Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] told the Turkish ambassador to Moscow [[Selim Sarper]] that the regions should be returned to the [[Soviet Union]], on behalf of the Georgian and Armenian republics.  Turkey found itself in a difficult position: it wanted good relations with the Soviet Union, but at the same time they refused to give up the territories. Turkey itself was in no condition to fight a war with the Soviet Union, which had emerged as a superpower after the second world war. By the autumn of 1945, Soviet troops in the Caucasus were ordered to prepare for a possible invasion of Turkey. Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] objected to these territorial claims, while [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry Truman]] initially felt that the matter should not concern other parties. With the onset of the [[Cold War]], however, the United States came to see Turkey as a useful ally against Soviet expansion and began to support it financially and militarily.

Summers are generally brief and warm with cool nights. The average high temperature in August is {{convert|26|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|lk=on|abbr=on}}. Winters are very cold. The average low January temperature is {{convert|-16|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|lk=on|abbr=on}}. However, temperatures can plummet to {{convert|-35|C|1}} during the winter months. It snows a lot in winter, staying for an average of four months in the city. Due to its geographic location of the city in the province, it has a slightly milder climate compared to the surrounding region. Some hills and peaks in the province, especially around the [[Sar\u0131kam\u0131\u015f]] region, are [[subarctic]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfc'') due to the higher elevation of the region.

Its walls date back to the [[Bagratuni Dynasty|Bagratuni]] Armenian period (there is surviving masonry on the north side of the castle) but it probably took on its present form during the thirteenth century when Kars was ruled by the [[Zak'arid]] dynasty.\n\nThe walls bear crosses in several places, including a  [[khachkar]] with a building inscription in Armenian on the easternmost tower, so the much repeated statement that Kars castle was built by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan]] [[Murad III]] during the war with [[Persian Empire|Persia]], at the close of the sixteenth century, is inaccurate. However, Murad probably did reconstruct much of the city walls (they are similar to those that the Ottoman army constructed at [[Ardahan]]). During the eighteenth century at the [[Battle of Kars (1745)]] a crushing defeat was inflicted upon the Ottoman army by the Persian conqueror, Nader Shah, not far from the city of Kars.\n\nBy the nineteenth century the citadel had lost most of its defensive purpose and a series of outer fortresses and defensive works were constructed to encircle Kars &ndash; this new defensive system proved particularly notable during the [[Siege of Kars]] in 1855.\n\n=== Other historical structures ===\n[[File:20110419 Tas Kopru bridge Kars Turkey Panorama.jpg|thumb|left|\"Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc\" (Stone Bridge 1725) over the Kars river.]]\n[[File:Kars Church Of The Apostles 2009.JPG|thumb|right|The Armenian [[Cathedral of Kars|Church of the Apostles]] housed a museum in the 1960s\u201370s and was converted to a mosque in 1993.<ref>{{cite news|title=Buras\u0131 cami oldu, burada ayin olmaz|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/d/t.aspx?ID=879898|newspaper=Milliyet|date=2008-06-24|language=Turkish|quote=Vak\u0131flar Genel M\u00fcd\u00fcrl\u00fc\u011f\u00fc, 1993 y\u0131l\u0131nda kiliseyi Diyanet \u0130\u015fleri Ba\u015fkanl\u0131\u011f\u0131'na devretti.

Built in the 930s, it has a [[tetraconch]] plan (a square with four semicircular apses) surmounted by a spherical dome on a cylindrical drum. On the exterior, the drum of contains [[bas-relief]] depictions of twelve figures, usually interpreted as representing the Twelve Apostles. The dome has a conical roof. The church was converted to a mosque in 1579, and then converted into a Russian Orthodox church in the 1880s. The Russian people constructed porches in front of the church's 3 entrances, and an elaborate belltower (now demolished) next to the church. The church was used as a warehouse from the 1930s, and it housed a small museum from 1963 until the late 1970s. Then the building was left to itself for about two decades, until it was converted into a mosque in 1993. In the same district of Kars are two other ruined Armenian churches. A Russian church from the 1900s was converted to a mosque in the 1980s after serving as a school gymnasium.<ref>\"[http://www.virtualani.org/karscathedral/index.htm THE CATHEDRAL OF KARS: Holy Apostles Church (Surb Arak'elots)].\" VirtualANI.

However, the extent of its actual independence from the Kingdom of Ani is uncertain: it was always in the possession of the relatives of the rulers of Ani, and, after Ani's capture by the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1045, the Bagratuni title \"King of Kings\" held by the ruler of Ani was transferred to the ruler of Kars. In 1064, just after the capture of Ani by [[Alp Arslan]] (leader of the [[Seljuk Turks]]), the Armenian king of Kars, Gagik-Abas, paid homage to the victorious Turks so that they would not lay siege to his city. In 1065 Gagik-Abas ceded his kingdom to the Byzantine Empire, but soon after Kars was taken by the Seljuk Turks.<ref name=\"SAE\"/>\n\nThe Seljuks quickly relinquished direct control over Kars and it became a small emirate whose territory corresponded closely to that of Vanand, and which bordered the similarly created but larger Shaddadid emirate centered at Ani. The Kars emirate was a vassal of the [[Saltukids]] in Erzurum, whose forces were effective in opposing [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgian]] attempts at seizing Kars. Thus, it was only in 1206 that Zakare of the [[Zakarids-Mkhargrzeli]] succeeded in capturing Kars, joining it to their fiefdom of Ani.<ref>{{harvnb|Lordkipanidze|Hewitt|1987|p=135}}.</ref> It was conquered in 1242 by the [[Mongols]]; was regained by Georgian Kingdom during the reign of [[George V of Georgia|George V the Brilliant]] (1314\u20131346), it remained part of the Kingdom before its disintegration, which then passed into the hands of [[Samtskhe-Saatabago|Georgian Atabegs]] belonging to the [[Jaqeli|House of Jaqeli]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} In 1387 the city surrendered to [[Timur]] (Tamerlane) and its fortifications were damaged.

On June 7, 1945, Soviet Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] told the Turkish ambassador to Moscow [[Selim Sarper]] that the regions should be returned to the [[Soviet Union]], on behalf of the Georgian and Armenian republics.  Turkey found itself in a difficult position: it wanted good relations with the Soviet Union, but at the same time they refused to give up the territories. Turkey itself was in no condition to fight a war with the Soviet Union, which had emerged as a superpower after the second world war. By the autumn of 1945, Soviet troops in the Caucasus were ordered to prepare for a possible invasion of Turkey. Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] objected to these territorial claims, while [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry Truman]] initially felt that the matter should not concern other parties. With the onset of the [[Cold War]], however, the United States came to see Turkey as a useful ally against Soviet expansion and began to support it financially and militarily. By 1948 the Soviet Union dropped its claims to Kars and the other regions.<ref>Krikorian, Robert O.

Summers are generally brief and warm with cool nights. The average high temperature in August is {{convert|26|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|lk=on|abbr=on}}. Winters are very cold. The average low January temperature is {{convert|-16|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|lk=on|abbr=on}}. However, temperatures can plummet to {{convert|-35|C|1}} during the winter months. It snows a lot in winter, staying for an average of four months in the city. Due to its geographic location of the city in the province, it has a slightly milder climate compared to the surrounding region. Some hills and peaks in the province, especially around the [[Sar\u0131kam\u0131\u015f]] region, are [[subarctic]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfc'') due to the higher elevation of the region.

Its walls date back to the [[Bagratuni Dynasty|Bagratuni]] Armenian period (there is surviving masonry on the north side of the castle) but it probably took on its present form during the thirteenth century when Kars was ruled by the [[Zak'arid]] dynasty.\n\nThe walls bear crosses in several places, including a  [[khachkar]] with a building inscription in Armenian on the easternmost tower, so the much repeated statement that Kars castle was built by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan]] [[Murad III]] during the war with [[Persian Empire|Persia]], at the close of the sixteenth century, is inaccurate. However, Murad probably did reconstruct much of the city walls (they are similar to those that the Ottoman army constructed at [[Ardahan]]). During the eighteenth century at the [[Battle of Kars (1745)]] a crushing defeat was inflicted upon the Ottoman army by the Persian conqueror, Nader Shah, not far from the city of Kars.\n\nBy the nineteenth century the citadel had lost most of its defensive purpose and a series of outer fortresses and defensive works were constructed to encircle Kars &ndash; this new defensive system proved particularly notable during the [[Siege of Kars]] in 1855.\n\n=== Other historical structures ===\n[[File:20110419 Tas Kopru bridge Kars Turkey Panorama.jpg|thumb|left|\"Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc\" (Stone Bridge 1725) over the Kars river.]]\n[[File:Kars Church Of The Apostles 2009.JPG|thumb|right|The Armenian [[Cathedral of Kars|Church of the Apostles]] housed a museum in the 1960s\u201370s and was converted to a mosque in 1993.<ref>{{cite news|title=Buras\u0131 cami oldu, burada ayin olmaz|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/d/t.aspx?ID=879898|newspaper=Milliyet|date=2008-06-24|language=Turkish|quote=Vak\u0131flar Genel M\u00fcd\u00fcrl\u00fc\u011f\u00fc, 1993 y\u0131l\u0131nda kiliseyi Diyanet \u0130\u015fleri Ba\u015fkanl\u0131\u011f\u0131'na devretti.

Built in the 930s, it has a [[tetraconch]] plan (a square with four semicircular apses) surmounted by a spherical dome on a cylindrical drum. On the exterior, the drum of contains [[bas-relief]] depictions of twelve figures, usually interpreted as representing the Twelve Apostles. The dome has a conical roof. The church was converted to a mosque in 1579, and then converted into a Russian Orthodox church in the 1880s. The Russian people constructed porches in front of the church's 3 entrances, and an elaborate belltower (now demolished) next to the church. The church was used as a warehouse from the 1930s, and it housed a small museum from 1963 until the late 1970s. Then the building was left to itself for about two decades, until it was converted into a mosque in 1993. In the same district of Kars are two other ruined Armenian churches. A Russian church from the 1900s was converted to a mosque in the 1980s after serving as a school gymnasium.<ref>\"[http://www.virtualani.org/karscathedral/index.htm THE CATHEDRAL OF KARS: Holy Apostles Church (Surb Arak'elots)].\" VirtualANI.

Based on 2018 estimates, there are about 4 million Annang speakers in Akwa Ibom and over a million speakers living outside of the state including Nigeria. Annang natives are known to be fearless at heart, truthful and honest.\n\n==Location==\nThe Anaang people are located in South [[Nigeria]] and specifically [[Akwa Ibom State]] and [[Cross River State]].  The political capital of the Anaang people is Ikot Ekpene Local Government Area. \n\n==Culture==\nAnaang society is [[patriarchal]].

Individuals are measured by both the number and types of memberships in ''Ulim'' and by the achievements of one or more ''Ulims''.

In all this, Anang women are not completely subordinate to men.  Instead Anaang women are partners and leaders in many aspects of Anaang tradition, including serving as female chief priests \"Abia Iyong\" in the Iyong cult or as healers in the healing cults.  The first-born female known as ''Aliaha'' is important and commands respect in the family and lineage.  Some traditions hold that a woman's first birth should take place in her mother's compound.  Women's organizations such as \"abi-de\" and \"Nyaama\", and \"Isong Iban\"  play important roles in giving the women voice and status in society. There are no traditional or cultural barriers that prevent women from attaining high offices or positions.\n\nAnaangs value the ability to speak well and oratory ability using [[proverb]]s is highly desirable, especially among the leaders. The American anthropologist, [[Peter Farb]], stated that the name \"Anaang\" among this group means \"they who speak well\". An individual who has the gift of eloquent speech is often complimented as ''Akwo Anaang'', meaning the \"Man of Anaang\".<ref>Farb, P. (1974) Word Play: What Happens when People Talk. New York.

A fattening room girl is known as a ''mbobo''. This was an occasion for a major village celebration. As part of her preparation for marriage the girl was also instructed on how to be a wife. She would spend her time in the room naked so that her fattening could be observed, and would sleep on a bamboo bed which was thought to fatten her up. It was also meant to make it more possible for her to conceive easily.\n\nThis use for fertility purposes was also used at time for infertile wives and as a prerequisite for entrance into secret societies.<ref name=Brink>{{cite book|title=Social Aspects of Obesity|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-2884491853|pages=71\u201384|author=Pamela J Brink|editor=I.De Garine and Nancy J. Pollock|chapter=Fertility and Fattening: the Annang Fattening Room}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Oral history===\nAccording to oral tradition, the Abiakpo came to the northern range of Anaang from Eka Abiakpo. They were quickly followed by the Ukana clan, the Utu, Ekpu, Ebom and Nyama (the [[British people|British]] lumped these groups together and gave them the name Otoro), and other Anaang clans. The Anaang and the entire people of Akwa Ibom and Cross River States of Nigeria (AkwaCross people) have occupied their land in the coastal Southeastern Nigeria for thousands of years.\n\nThe group is related to the [[Efik people|Efiks]] and the [[Ibibios]]. Migration brought the groups to live among the [[Akan people|Twi]] of [[Ghana]] where the name Anaang means \"fourth son\". From Ghana, the group moved eastward into present-day [[Cameroon]]. It was in the Cameroon highlands that the group broke off but later arrived at same territory in the Coastal Southeastern [[Nigeria]]. Lineages were recognized and the groups organized themselves into clans based on old family origins known as Iman, a similar structure extends into the land of their northern neighbors, the [[Igbo people|Igbo]].\n\n===Written history===\nVery little was written about the Anaang people before the mid-19th century. Early European traders who arrived in the cross river territories referred to groups who lived outside of the coastal areas as residents of Egbo-Sharry Country. The first written mention of the Anaangs is in [[Sigismund Koelle]]'s account of liberated slaves in [[Sierra Leone]]. He mentioned a liberated slave named ''Ebengo'' who hailed from Nkwot in [[Abak]]. Ebengo was captured and sold to the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] but was subsequently freed by a British warship and later settled in [[Waterloo, Sierra Leone]]. The British soldiers listed the languages spoken by the slaves in that captured ship as \"Anaang\". The second mention is a description of what is known as the Ikot Udo Obong Wars. The British described the killings of the Anaangs by King ''Jaja'' of [[Opobo]] as a punishment for defying his orders and trading in palm oil directly with the British merchants instead of going through him as a middle man. In the war that ensued, the British intervened and with the help of the Anaangs, they captured King Jaja and exiled him to the [[West Indies]]. The British established a military post at [[Ikot Ekpene]] in 1904.\n\nFollowing [[British colonialism]] and with changes and ban in ancient hunting practices, the Anaang witnessed attacks by wild animals. As the men went to fight in [[World War II]] these attacks intensified. The British authorities called the attacks murder and blamed it on \"the barbarism of the Africans\". The Anaang were accused of belonging to a secret society called ''Ekpeowo'' ([[Leopard Society|The Human Leopards Society]]). It has been argued that killings born out of insurgency against the British elsewhere in Africa led to the branding of leopard attacks as murders by the British authorities among the Anaang. Between 1945 and 1948 about 196 people were killed in [[Ikot Okoro]] community in the present-day Oruk Anam LGA; the [[Ikot Okoro]] Police station was set up because of this reason. The British convicted 96 people and executed 77 innocent people. The Anaang religion called Idiong was banned and the priests arrested. Articles and worship materials were publicly burnt and those who did not convert to Christianity automatically became suspects.\n\nThe Anaangs have a history and reputation for fearlessness and the ability of villages and clans to bind together to fight a common enemy. This is perhaps why they were able to thrive living so close to the [[Aro Confederacy]]'s center, [[Arochukwu]] with its famed [[Ibini Ukpabi]] oracle. A particular interesting war group, or \"Warrior cult\", was the famous Oko warriors. This war group was highly functional in the 1950s. These warriors were considered invulnerable to penetration of knives, spears, and arrows. In various instances sharp machetes were tested on the body parts of members.\n\nThe Anaangs suffered [[genocide]] during the [[Nigerian Civil War]]. The war lasted for three years (1967\u20131970) and the Anaang lost a significant number of its people. The effect of the war and the resulting neglect of the Anaang is now a serious political issue and a source of unrest in the area.\n\n==Written language==\nParts of the [[Annang language]] may be intelligible to speakers of [[Efik language|Efik]], [[Ibibio language|Ibibio]], [[Oro language|Oron]], [[Eket]] (also known as [[Ekid]]) of the [[Akwa Akpa|Old Calabar Kingdom]]. Though the Anaang speech pattern was not written down, linguists have now produced an orthography of the language which makes it possible to produce written materials in the language (Idem-Agozino & Udondata, 2001).\nIn Annang dialect, the word \"ilung\"means village while in Ibibio it is called \" Idung\". The major linguistic difference between the Annang and other dialects is the predominant use of the letter \"L\" in place of \"r\" or \"d\",and the use of \"g\" in place of \"w\".The Annang dialect sounds hard but it is a dialect of freewill,ie the words roll out easily from your tongue than the Ibibio.\n\n==Demographics==\n*Nigeria\n**[[Akwa Ibom State]]\n**[[Cross River State]]\n**Benue (Efik-Ibibio people were the fourth largest ethnic group of the original settlers of Benue of Nigeria)\n*Equatorial Guinea (formerly [[Fernando Po (island)|Fernando Po]])\n*Cameroon\n*Ghana\n\nOverseas diaspora:{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n*Cuba\n*West Indies\n\n== Annang numbers ==\nNumbers from zero to ten:<ref>{{Cite books|url=https://www.amazon.com/%C3%91gwed-Ik%C3%B6-Anaa%C3%B1-Apa-ebook/dp/B01E1LDQLI/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1519178315&sr=8-5&keywords=ezekiel+ette|access-date= 12 October 2016|title=\u00d1gwed Ik\u00f6 Anaa\u00f1:: Apa \u00d1gwed 1}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!No. !!

The American anthropologist, [[Peter Farb]], stated that the name \"Anaang\" among this group means \"they who speak well\". An individual who has the gift of eloquent speech is often complimented as ''Akwo Anaang'', meaning the \"Man of Anaang\".<ref>Farb, P. (1974) Word Play: What Happens when People Talk. New York. Alfred Knopf Publishers {{ISBN|0-679-73408-2}}.</ref>\n\n===Fattening room===\nThe fattening room is traditionally where virgin adolescent girls were fattened up in preparation for marriage. A fattening room girl is known as a ''mbobo''. This was an occasion for a major village celebration. As part of her preparation for marriage the girl was also instructed on how to be a wife. She would spend her time in the room naked so that her fattening could be observed, and would sleep on a bamboo bed which was thought to fatten her up. It was also meant to make it more possible for her to conceive easily.\n\nThis use for fertility purposes was also used at time for infertile wives and as a prerequisite for entrance into secret societies.<ref name=Brink>{{cite book|title=Social Aspects of Obesity|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-2884491853|pages=71\u201384|author=Pamela J Brink|editor=I.De Garine and Nancy J. Pollock|chapter=Fertility and Fattening: the Annang Fattening Room}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Oral history===\nAccording to oral tradition, the Abiakpo came to the northern range of Anaang from Eka Abiakpo. They were quickly followed by the Ukana clan, the Utu, Ekpu, Ebom and Nyama (the [[British people|British]] lumped these groups together and gave them the name Otoro), and other Anaang clans. The Anaang and the entire people of Akwa Ibom and Cross River States of Nigeria (AkwaCross people) have occupied their land in the coastal Southeastern Nigeria for thousands of years.\n\nThe group is related to the [[Efik people|Efiks]] and the [[Ibibios]]. Migration brought the groups to live among the [[Akan people|Twi]] of [[Ghana]] where the name Anaang means \"fourth son\". From Ghana, the group moved eastward into present-day [[Cameroon]]. It was in the Cameroon highlands that the group broke off but later arrived at same territory in the Coastal Southeastern [[Nigeria]]. Lineages were recognized and the groups organized themselves into clans based on old family origins known as Iman, a similar structure extends into the land of their northern neighbors, the [[Igbo people|Igbo]].\n\n===Written history===\nVery little was written about the Anaang people before the mid-19th century. Early European traders who arrived in the cross river territories referred to groups who lived outside of the coastal areas as residents of Egbo-Sharry Country. The first written mention of the Anaangs is in [[Sigismund Koelle]]'s account of liberated slaves in [[Sierra Leone]]. He mentioned a liberated slave named ''Ebengo'' who hailed from Nkwot in [[Abak]]. Ebengo was captured and sold to the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] but was subsequently freed by a British warship and later settled in [[Waterloo, Sierra Leone]]. The British soldiers listed the languages spoken by the slaves in that captured ship as \"Anaang\". The second mention is a description of what is known as the Ikot Udo Obong Wars. The British described the killings of the Anaangs by King ''Jaja'' of [[Opobo]] as a punishment for defying his orders and trading in palm oil directly with the British merchants instead of going through him as a middle man. In the war that ensued, the British intervened and with the help of the Anaangs, they captured King Jaja and exiled him to the [[West Indies]]. The British established a military post at [[Ikot Ekpene]] in 1904.\n\nFollowing [[British colonialism]] and with changes and ban in ancient hunting practices, the Anaang witnessed attacks by wild animals. As the men went to fight in [[World War II]] these attacks intensified. The British authorities called the attacks murder and blamed it on \"the barbarism of the Africans\". The Anaang were accused of belonging to a secret society called ''Ekpeowo'' ([[Leopard Society|The Human Leopards Society]]). It has been argued that killings born out of insurgency against the British elsewhere in Africa led to the branding of leopard attacks as murders by the British authorities among the Anaang. Between 1945 and 1948 about 196 people were killed in [[Ikot Okoro]] community in the present-day Oruk Anam LGA; the [[Ikot Okoro]] Police station was set up because of this reason. The British convicted 96 people and executed 77 innocent people. The Anaang religion called Idiong was banned and the priests arrested. Articles and worship materials were publicly burnt and those who did not convert to Christianity automatically became suspects.\n\nThe Anaangs have a history and reputation for fearlessness and the ability of villages and clans to bind together to fight a common enemy. This is perhaps why they were able to thrive living so close to the [[Aro Confederacy]]'s center, [[Arochukwu]] with its famed [[Ibini Ukpabi]] oracle. A particular interesting war group, or \"Warrior cult\", was the famous Oko warriors. This war group was highly functional in the 1950s. These warriors were considered invulnerable to penetration of knives, spears, and arrows. In various instances sharp machetes were tested on the body parts of members.\n\nThe Anaangs suffered [[genocide]] during the [[Nigerian Civil War]]. The war lasted for three years (1967\u20131970) and the Anaang lost a significant number of its people. The effect of the war and the resulting neglect of the Anaang is now a serious political issue and a source of unrest in the area.\n\n==Written language==\nParts of the [[Annang language]] may be intelligible to speakers of [[Efik language|Efik]], [[Ibibio language|Ibibio]], [[Oro language|Oron]], [[Eket]] (also known as [[Ekid]]) of the [[Akwa Akpa|Old Calabar Kingdom]]. Though the Anaang speech pattern was not written down, linguists have now produced an orthography of the language which makes it possible to produce written materials in the language (Idem-Agozino & Udondata, 2001).\nIn Annang dialect, the word \"ilung\"means village while in Ibibio it is called \" Idung\". The major linguistic difference between the Annang and other dialects is the predominant use of the letter \"L\" in place of \"r\" or \"d\",and the use of \"g\" in place of \"w\".The Annang dialect sounds hard but it is a dialect of freewill,ie the words roll out easily from your tongue than the Ibibio.\n\n==Demographics==\n*Nigeria\n**[[Akwa Ibom State]]\n**[[Cross River State]]\n**Benue (Efik-Ibibio people were the fourth largest ethnic group of the original settlers of Benue of Nigeria)\n*Equatorial Guinea (formerly [[Fernando Po (island)|Fernando Po]])\n*Cameroon\n*Ghana\n\nOverseas diaspora:{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n*Cuba\n*West Indies\n\n== Annang numbers ==\nNumbers from zero to ten:<ref>{{Cite books|url=https://www.amazon.com/%C3%91gwed-Ik%C3%B6-Anaa%C3%B1-Apa-ebook/dp/B01E1LDQLI/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1519178315&sr=8-5&keywords=ezekiel+ette|access-date= 12 October 2016|title=\u00d1gwed Ik\u00f6 Anaa\u00f1:: Apa \u00d1gwed 1}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!No. !!

Daily newspapers in Bangladesh are published in the capital, [[Dhaka]], as well as in major regional cities such as [[Chittagong]], [[Khulna]], [[Rajshahi]], [[Sylhet]] and [[Barisal]]. All daily newspapers are morning editions; there are no evening editions in Bangladesh. Some newspapers offer online versions.\n\n==Notable daily newspapers==\n\n===Bengali-language newspapers===\n{{Expand list|date=April 2013}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! colspan=2 | Newspaper name\n! rowspan=2 | Founded\n! rowspan=2 | Owner/Publisher\n! rowspan=2 | Editor\n! rowspan=2 | Region\n! rowspan=2 data-sort-type=\"number\" | Circulation <br/> <small>(June, 2018)</small>    \n|-\n!
