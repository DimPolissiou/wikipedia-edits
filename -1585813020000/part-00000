It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n[[File:everettwaterfront.jpg|thumb| [[Weyerhaeuser]] Lumber Mill, Everett Waterfront, c. early 1900s]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes, including the [[Snohomish people|Snohomish]], who maintained a winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The area was explored by the [[Vancouver Expedition]] of 1792, which landed on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claimed the land for [[England]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The Snohomish and other tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, \nrelocating to the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]] and relinquishing its lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]], opening the region to American settlement.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] on Port Gardner Bay in 1861 and built a cabin for himself. He was joined by several other families on their own homesteads, which included the establishment of a general store and a [[sawmill]] that quickly went out of business.<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=http://www.historylink.org/File/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> Over the next several years a handful of settlers moved to the area, but it wasn't until 1890 that plans for platting a town were conceived.\n\nOn July 17, 1890, The steamship ''[[Queen of the Pacific]]'' left [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] for an Alaskan cruise with [[Henry Hewitt, Jr.]] and [[Charles L. Colby]] aboard. During this \"Fateful voyage\" initial plans for an industrial city on the peninsula along the banks of the Snohomish river were formulated. On August 22, 1890, The [[Rucker Brothers]] filed their [[plat]] at Port Gardner, a {{convert|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} townsite on the bayfront side of what is now the city of Everett. This plat was later withdrawn to accommodate the plans of the Hewitt-Colby group.\n\nOn September 1, 1890, Henry Hewitt filed a bond on the Davis tract at the north end of what was to become the Everett town site, beginning the process of acquisition that would become the Everett Land Company later along with Charles L. Colby and [[Colgate Hoyt]]. In October 1890, the Hewitt-Colby syndicate decided to name their industrial city after Everett Colby, the fifteen-year-old son of investor Charles L. Colby, who had displayed a prodigious appetite at dinner. Everett Colby in turn was named for orator [[Edward Everett]].\n\nOn November 19, 1890, the Articles of Incorporation for the Everett Land Company were filed, with Henry Hewitt Jr. as president. On November 26, 1890, the Rucker Brothers transferred {{convert|434.15|acre|km2}} of property on the Everett peninsula to Hewitt. Three days later, \"The Remarkable Document\" was drafted, setting the terms by which the Rucker Brothers would donate half their remaining holdings to Hewitt in exchange for promises of specific development.\n\nThe Company bought much of the Ruckers' land, taking them in as junior partners. Everett was officially incorporated on May 4, 1893, the year the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] came to the town. Both Hewitt and the Ruckers had speculated that [[James J. Hill]] would make the town the terminus of his railroad. However Hill continued the railroad along the shore of [[Puget Sound]] to [[Seattle]]. Although it succeeded in building the city, the Everett Land Company was a failure for its investors. The outside investors withdrew, and the Company's holdings were transferred to a new company controlled by Hill. The Ruckers, who helped broker the deal, stayed in Everett and became leading citizens of the young city.\n\nRailroads and mines played a part in Everett's future. The mining community of [[Monte Cristo, Washington|Monte Cristo]] depended on a railway for supplies. It was hoped that the railroad would cross the mountains and bring in traffic. For a while ore was smelted in Everett, then sawmilling and port activity commenced. A dozen steam riverboats were built in Everett for the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Yukon gold rush]].\n\nSeveral survivors of the [[Bellingham riots]] settled in Everett for two months, until they were beaten and forcefully evicted by a mob on November 5, 1907. Everett also was the site of the [[Everett Massacre]] of 1916 in which a posse led by local Sheriff Donald McRae shot and killed five [[Industrial Workers of the World]] members. The IWW members on the [[Verona (steamship)|steamer ''Verona'']] travelled from Seattle to support strikers in Everett and sought to land, but McRae and his posse of deputized civilians blocked the harbor. Shooting broke out and at least five IWW members were killed, along with two in the posse who were deemed to have been killed by friendly fire.\n\nEverett streets are named after each of the three founders. Adjacent streets Colby Avenue and Hoyt Avenue run north and south and are intersected by Hewitt Avenue running east and west just south of the [[BNSF Railway]] tracks cutting across Everett. There are several other streets named for their associates such as Bond Street named for Judge [[Hiram Bond]], President of the Everett & Monte Cristo Railroad. Parallel to Colby and Hoyt are avenues named for other investors, [[John D. Rockefeller]], railroad executive [[Thomas Fletcher Oakes|T.F. Oakes]], shipbuilder [[Alexander McDougall (1845-1923)|Alexander McDougall]], and McDougall's associate [[Charles W. Wetmore]].\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], the [[Works Progress Administration]] was tasked with construction of several public works projects in the Everett area, including a new county airport that later became [[Paine Field]]. The airport was appropriated for military use during [[World War II]], but was later turned over to county ownership.<ref name=\"HistoryLink\"/> The [[Boeing Company]] selected a {{convert|780|acre|ha|adj=mid}} plot of land north of the airport in June 1966 to build a [[Boeing Everett Factory|new airplane factory]] for its [[Boeing 747]] passenger jetliner, which would become the world's first \"jumbo jet\".

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n[[File:everettwaterfront.jpg|thumb| [[Weyerhaeuser]] Lumber Mill, Everett Waterfront, c. early 1900s]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes, including the [[Snohomish people|Snohomish]], who maintained a winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The area was explored by the [[Vancouver Expedition]] of 1792, which landed on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claimed the land for [[England]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The Snohomish and other tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, \nrelocating to the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]] and relinquishing its lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]], opening the region to American settlement.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] on Port Gardner Bay in 1861 and built a cabin for himself. He was joined by several other families on their own homesteads, which included the establishment of a general store and a [[sawmill]] that quickly went out of business.<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=http://www.historylink.org/File/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> Over the next several years a handful of settlers moved to the area, but it wasn't until 1890 that plans for platting a town were conceived.\n\nOn July 17, 1890, The steamship ''[[Queen of the Pacific]]'' left [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] for an Alaskan cruise with [[Henry Hewitt, Jr.]] and [[Charles L. Colby]] aboard. During this \"Fateful voyage\" initial plans for an industrial city on the peninsula along the banks of the Snohomish river were formulated. On August 22, 1890, The [[Rucker Brothers]] filed their [[plat]] at Port Gardner, a {{convert|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} townsite on the bayfront side of what is now the city of Everett. This plat was later withdrawn to accommodate the plans of the Hewitt-Colby group.\n\nOn September 1, 1890, Henry Hewitt filed a bond on the Davis tract at the north end of what was to become the Everett town site, beginning the process of acquisition that would become the Everett Land Company later along with Charles L. Colby and [[Colgate Hoyt]]. In October 1890, the Hewitt-Colby syndicate decided to name their industrial city after Everett Colby, the fifteen-year-old son of investor Charles L. Colby, who had displayed a prodigious appetite at dinner. Everett Colby in turn was named for orator [[Edward Everett]].\n\nOn November 19, 1890, the Articles of Incorporation for the Everett Land Company were filed, with Henry Hewitt Jr. as president. On November 26, 1890, the Rucker Brothers transferred {{convert|434.15|acre|km2}} of property on the Everett peninsula to Hewitt. Three days later, \"The Remarkable Document\" was drafted, setting the terms by which the Rucker Brothers would donate half their remaining holdings to Hewitt in exchange for promises of specific development.\n\nThe Company bought much of the Ruckers' land, taking them in as junior partners. Everett was officially incorporated on May 4, 1893, the year the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] came to the town. Both Hewitt and the Ruckers had speculated that [[James J. Hill]] would make the town the terminus of his railroad. However Hill continued the railroad along the shore of [[Puget Sound]] to [[Seattle]]. Although it succeeded in building the city, the Everett Land Company was a failure for its investors. The outside investors withdrew, and the Company's holdings were transferred to a new company controlled by Hill. The Ruckers, who helped broker the deal, stayed in Everett and became leading citizens of the young city.\n\nRailroads and mines played a part in Everett's future. The mining community of [[Monte Cristo, Washington|Monte Cristo]] depended on a railway for supplies. It was hoped that the railroad would cross the mountains and bring in traffic. For a while ore was smelted in Everett, then sawmilling and port activity commenced. A dozen steam riverboats were built in Everett for the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Yukon gold rush]].\n\nSeveral survivors of the [[Bellingham riots]] settled in Everett for two months, until they were beaten and forcefully evicted by a mob on November 5, 1907. Everett also was the site of the [[Everett Massacre]] of 1916 in which a posse led by local Sheriff Donald McRae shot and killed five [[Industrial Workers of the World]] members. The IWW members on the [[Verona (steamship)|steamer ''Verona'']] travelled from Seattle to support strikers in Everett and sought to land, but McRae and his posse of deputized civilians blocked the harbor. Shooting broke out and at least five IWW members were killed, along with two in the posse who were deemed to have been killed by friendly fire.\n\nEverett streets are named after each of the three founders. Adjacent streets Colby Avenue and Hoyt Avenue run north and south and are intersected by Hewitt Avenue running east and west just south of the [[BNSF Railway]] tracks cutting across Everett. There are several other streets named for their associates such as Bond Street named for Judge [[Hiram Bond]], President of the Everett & Monte Cristo Railroad. Parallel to Colby and Hoyt are avenues named for other investors, [[John D. Rockefeller]], railroad executive [[Thomas Fletcher Oakes|T.F. Oakes]], shipbuilder [[Alexander McDougall (1845-1923)|Alexander McDougall]], and McDougall's associate [[Charles W. Wetmore]].\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], the [[Works Progress Administration]] was tasked with construction of several public works projects in the Everett area, including a new county airport that later became [[Paine Field]].

He then studied [[philosophy]], history, and Oriental languages at [[Vienna]] and [[Berlin]], taking his doctor's degree in 1871<ref name=je/> from the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]]. His rabbinical training was at the hands of [[Moshe Schick]] and [[Azriel Hildesheimer]].\n\nShortly after obtaining his degree, he became employed as a teacher in [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]]'s ''Realschule'' school in [[Frankfurt am Main]], and in 1873 moved to Berlin to join the faculty of the [[Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary|Rabbinical Seminary of Berlin]] where he eventually became [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] ([[Rosh Yeshiva]]) in 1899 after the death of [[Azriel Hildesheimer]].<ref name=je>{{Jewish Encyclopedia|inline=1|title=Hoffmann, David|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/7804-hoffmann-david|accessdate=Jan 30, 2017|first1=Isidore|last1=Singer|authorlink1=Isidore Singer}}</ref>\n\nHis commentary on the Pentateuch is still often referenced.\n\n==A selective ''Wissenschaft'' practitioner==\nDavid Hoffmann is in some ways the prototype of the contemporary [[Orthodox Jewish]] scholar, facing the ubiquitous tension between faithfulness to tradition and the demands of critical inquiry. Though born in [[Hungary]], he adapted the [[Jews of Germany|German-Jewish]] approach of openness towards general culture, world and society. \n\nHe employed the critical scientific method to the [[Talmud]] and wrote about the history of the development of the form of the [[Oral law#Oral law in Judaism|Oral law]] (as opposed to the development of the [[halachah|Law]] itself, the latter being an enterprise antithetical to traditional Jewish beliefs; see below). Despite this, he was an original member of the more traditionally oriented ''[[Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah]]'' (council of great Torah sages), and was also known to be \"of great moral conduct and piety\".\n\nHoffman was the leading authority on traditional ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law) in [[Germany]] in his lifetime, as well as an expert in the area of ''[[midrash halakha]]'' (legalistic [[Biblical exegesis]]). \nHe was also known for his efforts to disprove the [[Documentary Hypothesis]], as expressed by the [[Julius Wellhausen|Graf-Wellhausen]] theory, with his arguments presented in the work ''Die wichtigsten Instanzen gegen die Graf-Wellhausensche Hypothese'' (1903/1916).  \n\n[[A. Altmann]], however, sees Hoffmann's writings on these matters (though evidencing great expertise) as pure apologetics, the cause of which may be seen as laid out in his introduction to [[Leviticus]] {{Harv|Ellenson|Jacobs|1988}}, where Hoffmann makes the following remarks:\n\n{{quotation|I willingly agree that, in consequence of the foundation of my belief, I am unable to arrive at the conclusion that the [[Pentateuch]] was written by anyone other than [[Moses]]... \nWe believe that the whole [[Jewish Bible|Bible]] is true, holy, and of divine origin. That every word of the [[Torah]] was inscribed by divine command is expressed in the principle ''Torah min Ha Shamayim''... We must not presume to set ourselves up as critics of the author of a biblical text or doubt the truth of his statements or question the correctness of his teaching...\nThe Jewish commentator must (therefore) constantly be on guard against interpreting the passage in such a way as to appear to be in conflict with traditional [[Halachah]]. Just as the Torah as a divine revelation must not contradict itself, in the same way it must not contradict the Oral Law which is of divine origin.}}\n  \nYet, despite the piety of the above sentiments, and his repeated proclamations regarding the divinity of the Oral Law, Hoffmann was still very much the ''[[Wissenschaft des Judentums|Wissenschaft]]'' scholar. He cites in his work scholars such as [[Z. Frankel]], [[A. Geiger]], [[S.J. Rapoport]], and [[H. Graetz]], he studies the influences of [[Ancient Near Eastern]] culture on the evolution of the Talmud, and he identifies problems in the transmitted text. For example, Hoffmann in ''The First Mishna'' (discussed [[#Writings|below]]) sees the present Mishna [[Pirkei Avot|Avot]] as having been redacted from three different sources, a Mishna of [[Rabbi Akiva]], a Mishna of [[Rabbi Meir]], and a Mishna of [[Rabbi Judah Ha-Nasi]], the originals of which cannot be completely reconstructed due to their thoroughgoing fusion and subsequent manipulation.\n\nThe extent to which Hoffmann resided in the ''Wissenschaft'' movement can also be seen from the criticism he received from such opponents of the movement as Samson Raphael Hirsch. Hildesheimer notes regarding Hirsch's opinion of his Rabbinical Seminary (where Hoffmann worked<ref name=je/> after leaving Hirsch's institution) that \"a question certainly exists as to whether Rabbi Hirsch considers the seminary to be an Orthodox institution.\" Hirsch's opposition extended to Hoffmann's own work, judging Hoffmann's book ''Mar Samuel'' to contain heresies {{Harv|Ellenson|Jacobs|1988}}.\n\nHoffmann's resolution of this tension between faithfulness to tradition and textual criticism is found by {{Harvtxt|Ellenson|Jacobs|1988}} in the following passage from the introduction to ''The First Mishna'':\n\n{{quotation|Thus, in the study of the [[Tanakh|Holy Scriptures]] on the one hand, we consider the authenticity and integrity to be absolute, and we can recognize as true only such results as do not question that premise. With the [[Mishna]], on the other hand, any criticism (unless it contradicts a [[halachah]] fixed in the Talmud) as well as any research as to the age of the Mishna and the time of its expression in the extant form is not only considered permissible to us, but even required for the scientific examination of the tradition.}}\n\n==Writings==\nHoffman produced the ''Die Erste Mishna'' (The First Mishna), a historical and linguistic analysis of the [[Mishnah]].\n''Die Erste Mishna'' posits an early, uniform, undisputed, and therefore authoritative collection of the [[Oral Torah|Oral Law]], attempting to understand the historical development of the Mishnah from within itself and from rabbinic and non-rabbinic sources related to it.<ref>Prof. Michael Chernick (2016).

Express I accomplished this by adding service, operating as Republic Express, to three cities using [[Handley Page Jetstream|BAe Jetstream 31]] aircraft. Within six months, Express Airlines I was operating in ten markets using nine Jetstream 31s and two [[Saab 340]] aircraft.\n\nBy its first anniversary, Republic Express, as the service was known, was operating 20 Jetstream 31s and seven Saab 340s in 32 markets. Following regulatory and shareholder approvals, [[Northwest Airlines]] acquired Republic Airlines on October 1, 1986. Subsequently, the Republic Express brand merged with the [[Northwest Airlink]] brand.\n\nOver the next decade, Express I provided airline services as Northwest Airlink to 56 cities in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]] and upper [[Midwestern United States|Mid-West]]. In 1997, Northwest Airlines bought Express I from Phoenix Airline Services. On April 1, 1997, Express I became a wholly owned subsidiary of Northwest Airlines. In order to consolidate the many Airlink systems operated at that time, Express I ceased flying from Minneapolis-St. Paul, and instead concentrated on the Memphis hub.\n\nIn August 1997, Express I moved its corporate headquarters to Memphis, allowing all the various departments to function from its main base of operations. On May 7, 2000, Express I became the launch operator of the [[Bombardier Canadair Regional Jet]] (CRJ) at Northwest.\n\nExpress I further expanded with the development of three additional Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul (MRO) facilities related to CRJ operations. The primary CRJ MRO is located in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], and is capable of handling up to four aircraft under cover. Other two CRJ maintenance sites are located in [[Indiana]] at [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] and [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]].\n\n===Pinnacle Airlines===\nOn May 8, 2002, Express Airlines I changed its name to '''Pinnacle Airlines'''. A new [[holding company]], [[Pinnacle Airlines Corporation]], had been created earlier that year.<ref name=\"RefForBus\"/> Pinnacle Airlines, Inc was moved from Northwest Airlines, Inc to Pinnacle Airlines Corporation. Over the next decade, the parent company acquired other airlines, such as [[Colgan Air]] and [[Mesaba Airlines]].\n\nIn 2006, Northwest agreed to a new Air Service Agreement (ASA) that contracted Pinnacle to fly 124 CRJs until 2017. A clause within the ASA stipulated that if Pinnacle and the [[Air Line Pilots Association, International|Air Line Pilots Association]] did not agree on a new pilot contract by March 31, 2007, then Northwest could remove up to 17 CRJs from Pinnacle's fleet. After the deadline passed with no new pilot contract, Northwest exercised its right to remove 17 CRJs from Pinnacle, starting in September 2008 at a rate of two CRJs per month. These 17 CRJs were handed over to [[Mesaba Airlines]] in 2008, which Pinnacle's parent company later acquired in 2010.\n\nNorthwest had also allowed Pinnacle to seek flying for other carriers. On April 30, 2007, Pinnacle Airlines Corp. signed a 10-year contract with Delta Air Lines to be a Delta Connection carrier. The 16 [[Bombardier CRJ700 series|Bombardier CRJ 900]]'s began delivery in November 2007 and the deliveries were completed in May 2009. The first batch of delivered aircraft were based in Atlanta and began service in December 2007. On June 10, 2008 Pinnacle announced that Delta planned to withdraw from the contract by July 31, 2008 for failure to make its timetable. However, on July 18, 2008 Delta announced that an agreement had been reached that would allow Pinnacle to continue flying for Delta under the terms of the initial contract. The remaining 4 CRJ-900s would be delivered between January and May 2009, at which point all 15 CRJ-900s would be in service for Delta Connection.<ref>{{cite news | title=Pinnacle shares soar as Delta stands by contract | url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/pinnacle-airlines-shares-soar-delta/story.aspx?guid=%7BDF23AC9A-FD28-4A93-ABA9-5471487B7A65%7D&dist=msr_1 | first=Shawn | last=Langlois | work=[[MarketWatch]] | date=July 18, 2008 | accessdate=July 18, 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn January 4, 2012, Pinnacle's fleet grew when its parent company moved aircraft and personnel from [[Mesaba Airlines]], which ceased operations when the operating certificate was returned to the FAA. It also acquired personnel from [[Colgan Air]] after it ceased operations on September 5, 2012.\n\n===Endeavor Air===\nOn April 1, 2012, Pinnacle's parent company and its subsidiaries filed for [[bankruptcy protection]] under [[Chapter 11]] of the United States Bankruptcy Code.<ref name=\"frequentbusinesstraveler1\"/> The airline discontinued its operation of its Saab 340 and Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft by the end of November 2012.<ref name=\"frequentbusinesstraveler1\"/> On May 1, 2013, Pinnacle Airlines Corporation emerged from Chapter 11 reorganization as a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta Air Lines.<ref name=\"startribune.com\"/> After restructuring, the airline was renamed to Endeavor Air,<ref name=\"Pinmove\"/>  its headquarters were moved to [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Donahoe|first=Jane|title=Pinnacle Airlines to move HQ to Minneapolis|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/memphis/news/2013/01/24/pinnacle-airlines-to-move-hq-to.html|work=Memphis Business Journal|publisher=Stuart Chamblin|accessdate=January 24, 2013}}</ref> and agreements with Delta were made to operate 76-seat and 50-seat regional jets.<ref name=BankruptcyApproval>{{cite web|url=http://skift.com/2013/04/21/pinnacle-airlines-to-fly-exclusively-for-delta-upon-leaving-bankruptcy/ |title=Pinnacle to fly exclusively for Delta upon leaving bankruptcy |publisher=Skift.com |date=April 17, 2013|accessdate=April 21, 2013}}</ref> \n\nOn October 27, 2016, Endeavor Air adopted EDV as its new ICAO airline code and \"Endeavor\" as its callsign, replacing its previous code of FLG and \"Flagship\" callsign. The first flight to operate under the new callsign was EDV3816 from [[Qu\u00e9bec City Jean Lesage International Airport|Jean Lesage International Airport]] in [[Quebec City]] to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York\u2013JFK]].\n\nIn March 2017, Endeavor announced it would be re-opening an Atlanta crew and maintenance base, operating CRJ-200 aircraft at this hub. By July 2017, Endeavor had five crew and ten maintenance bases.\n\n===Former Pinnacle Airlines CEO shot dead===\nOn September 27, 2018, former Pinnacle Airlines CEO was shot dead in Memphis, Tennessee in an apparent [[drive by shooting]].

All sixteen passengers and both pilots were killed.  An investigation revealed that the captain had a history of intimidating and hostile behavior toward first officers.  The captain's actions during the flight led to a breakdown in communication between the pilots, who lost track of their altitude while attempting a night landing in poor weather.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-94-05 Final Report\"/>\n* On October 14, 2004, [[Pinnacle Airlines Flight 3701]] crashed in a residential area in [[Jefferson City, Missouri]]. It was on an empty repositioning flight from [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], to [[Minneapolis]], and lost power in both engines when the crew attempted to exceed the [[Bombardier CRJ200|CRJ-200]]'s capabilities and reach its maximum certified operating altitude. They were unable to restart the engines, and made an unsuccessful attempt to glide the aircraft to Jefferson City. Both crew members were killed.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2007/AAR0701.pdf |title=Aircraft Accident Report, Crash of Pinnacle Airlines Flight 3701, Bombardier CL-600-2B19, N8396A, Jefferson City, Missouri, October 14, 2004 |publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]] |id=NTSB/AAR-07-01 |date=January 9, 2007 |accessdate=December 28, 2017}}</ref>\n*On March 11, 2005, a CRJ-200 operating as Northwest Airlink Flight 2823 from [[LaGuardia Airport]] in New York to [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], ran off the runway on landing. One of the aircraft's hydraulic systems lost pressure in flight, resulting in the aircraft's ground spoilers not deploying on landing. Contributing to the incident was a crosswind approaching company and aircraft limits and reduced braking ability on the runway, which was covered with snow at the time. The aircraft suffered substantial damage from colliding with signage and lighting, and was further damaged by the crew's attempt to taxi to the gate. None of the 12 aboard were injured, and the aircraft was repaired.<ref>http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20050311-0</ref>\n*On April 12, 2007, [[Pinnacle Airlines flight 4712]] overran the runway upon landing at [[Cherry Capital Airport]] in [[Traverse City, Michigan]], after a flight from [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport|Minneapolis]].  The CRJ-200 was damaged, but none of the 52 passengers and crew were injured. The NTSB determined that the cause of the accident was the \"pilots\u2019 decision to land at TVC without performing a landing distance assessment\" which in turn was caused by fatigued pilots and ambiguous runway condition reports from the snow plow crew operating at the time. The report recommended more landing distance training, post-accident drug testing, and further criteria for runway closures in snow and ice conditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/about/Documents/SPC0901.pdf|title=2008 Annual Report to Congress |accessdate=January 14, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR0802.pdf |title=Aircraft Accident Report, Runway Overrun During Landing, Pinnacle Airlines Flight 4712, Bombardier/Canadair Regional Jet CL600-2B19, N8905F, Traverse City, Michigan April 12, 2007 |publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]] |id=NTSB/AAR-08/02 |date=June 10, 2008 |accessdate=January 14, 2015}}</ref>\n* The FAA fined Pinnacle over $1 million for allegedly operating two Canadair Regional Jets in 2009 and 2010 that were not in compliance with FAA regulations.

On a second aircraft, Pinnacle is accused of failing to conduct proper monitoring of a cracked low-pressure turbine case.\n*On January 24, 2012, a Pinnacle CRJ-200 was damaged beyond repair at [[T.F.

Express I accomplished this by adding service, operating as Republic Express, to three cities using [[Handley Page Jetstream|BAe Jetstream 31]] aircraft. Within six months, Express Airlines I was operating in ten markets using nine Jetstream 31s and two [[Saab 340]] aircraft.\n\nBy its first anniversary, Republic Express, as the service was known, was operating 20 Jetstream 31s and seven Saab 340s in 32 markets. Following regulatory and shareholder approvals, [[Northwest Airlines]] acquired Republic Airlines on October 1, 1986. Subsequently, the Republic Express brand merged with the [[Northwest Airlink]] brand.\n\nOver the next decade, Express I provided airline services as Northwest Airlink to 56 cities in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]] and upper [[Midwestern United States|Mid-West]]. In 1997, Northwest Airlines bought Express I from Phoenix Airline Services. On April 1, 1997, Express I became a wholly owned subsidiary of Northwest Airlines. In order to consolidate the many Airlink systems operated at that time, Express I ceased flying from Minneapolis-St. Paul, and instead concentrated on the Memphis hub.\n\nIn August 1997, Express I moved its corporate headquarters to Memphis, allowing all the various departments to function from its main base of operations. On May 7, 2000, Express I became the launch operator of the [[Bombardier Canadair Regional Jet]] (CRJ) at Northwest.\n\nExpress I further expanded with the development of three additional Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul (MRO) facilities related to CRJ operations. The primary CRJ MRO is located in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], and is capable of handling up to four aircraft under cover. Other two CRJ maintenance sites are located in [[Indiana]] at [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] and [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]].\n\n===Pinnacle Airlines===\nOn May 8, 2002, Express Airlines I changed its name to '''Pinnacle Airlines'''. A new [[holding company]], [[Pinnacle Airlines Corporation]], had been created earlier that year.<ref name=\"RefForBus\"/> Pinnacle Airlines, Inc was moved from Northwest Airlines, Inc to Pinnacle Airlines Corporation. Over the next decade, the parent company acquired other airlines, such as [[Colgan Air]] and [[Mesaba Airlines]].\n\nIn 2006, Northwest agreed to a new Air Service Agreement (ASA) that contracted Pinnacle to fly 124 CRJs until 2017. A clause within the ASA stipulated that if Pinnacle and the [[Air Line Pilots Association, International|Air Line Pilots Association]] did not agree on a new pilot contract by March 31, 2007, then Northwest could remove up to 17 CRJs from Pinnacle's fleet. After the deadline passed with no new pilot contract, Northwest exercised its right to remove 17 CRJs from Pinnacle, starting in September 2008 at a rate of two CRJs per month. These 17 CRJs were handed over to [[Mesaba Airlines]] in 2008, which Pinnacle's parent company later acquired in 2010.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:EndeavorAir.jpg|thumb| Endeavor Air headquarters 7500 Airline Drive [[Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport]]]] -->\nNorthwest had also allowed Pinnacle to seek flying for other carriers. On April 30, 2007, Pinnacle Airlines Corp. signed a 10-year contract with Delta Air Lines to be a Delta Connection carrier. The 16 [[Bombardier CRJ700 series|Bombardier CRJ 900]]'s began delivery in November 2007 and the deliveries were completed in May 2009. The first batch of delivered aircraft were based in Atlanta and began service in December 2007. On June 10, 2008 Pinnacle announced that Delta planned to withdraw from the contract by July 31, 2008 for failure to make its timetable. However, on July 18, 2008 Delta announced that an agreement had been reached that would allow Pinnacle to continue flying for Delta under the terms of the initial contract. The remaining 4 CRJ-900s would be delivered between January and May 2009, at which point all 15 CRJ-900s would be in service for Delta Connection.<ref>{{cite news | title=Pinnacle shares soar as Delta stands by contract | url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/pinnacle-airlines-shares-soar-delta/story.aspx?guid=%7BDF23AC9A-FD28-4A93-ABA9-5471487B7A65%7D&dist=msr_1 | first=Shawn | last=Langlois | work=[[MarketWatch]] | date=July 18, 2008 | accessdate=July 18, 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn January 4, 2012, Pinnacle's fleet grew when its parent company moved aircraft and personnel from Mesaba Airlines, which ceased operations when the operating certificate was returned to the FAA. It also acquired personnel from Colgan Air after it ceased operations on September 5, 2012.\n\n===Endeavor Air===\nOn April 1, 2012, Pinnacle's parent company and its subsidiaries filed for [[bankruptcy protection]] under [[Chapter 11]] of the United States Bankruptcy Code.<ref name=\"frequentbusinesstraveler1\"/> The airline discontinued its operation of its Saab 340 and Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft by the end of November 2012.<ref name=\"frequentbusinesstraveler1\"/> On May 1, 2013, Pinnacle Airlines Corporation emerged from Chapter 11 reorganization as a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta Air Lines.<ref name=\"startribune.com\"/> After restructuring, the airline was renamed to Endeavor Air,<ref name=\"Pinmove\"/>  its headquarters were moved to [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Donahoe|first=Jane|title=Pinnacle Airlines to move HQ to Minneapolis|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/memphis/news/2013/01/24/pinnacle-airlines-to-move-hq-to.html|work=Memphis Business Journal|publisher=Stuart Chamblin|accessdate=January 24, 2013}}</ref> and agreements with Delta were made to operate 76-seat and 50-seat regional jets.<ref name=BankruptcyApproval>{{cite web|url=http://skift.com/2013/04/21/pinnacle-airlines-to-fly-exclusively-for-delta-upon-leaving-bankruptcy/ |title=Pinnacle to fly exclusively for Delta upon leaving bankruptcy |publisher=Skift.com |date=April 17, 2013|accessdate=April 21, 2013}}</ref> On October 27, 2016, Endeavor Air adopted EDV as its new ICAO airline code and \"Endeavor\" as its callsign, replacing its previous code of FLG and \"Flagship\" callsign.

All sixteen passengers and both pilots were killed.  An investigation revealed that the captain had a history of intimidating and hostile behavior toward first officers.

One of the aircraft's hydraulic systems lost pressure in flight, resulting in the aircraft's ground spoilers not deploying on landing. Contributing to the incident was a crosswind approaching company and aircraft limits and reduced braking ability on the runway, which was covered with snow at the time. The aircraft suffered substantial damage from colliding with signage and lighting, and was further damaged by the crew's attempt to taxi to the gate. None of the 12 aboard were injured, and the aircraft was repaired.<ref>http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20050311-0</ref>\n*On April 12, 2007, [[Pinnacle Airlines flight 4712]] overran the runway upon landing at [[Cherry Capital Airport]] in [[Traverse City, Michigan]], after a flight from [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport|Minneapolis]].  The CRJ-200 was damaged, but none of the 52 passengers and crew were injured. The NTSB determined that the cause of the accident was the \"pilots\u2019 decision to land at TVC without performing a landing distance assessment\" which in turn was caused by fatigued pilots and ambiguous runway condition reports from the snow plow crew operating at the time. The report recommended more landing distance training, post-accident drug testing, and further criteria for runway closures in snow and ice conditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/about/Documents/SPC0901.pdf|title=2008 Annual Report to Congress |accessdate=January 14, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR0802.pdf |title=Aircraft Accident Report, Runway Overrun During Landing, Pinnacle Airlines Flight 4712, Bombardier/Canadair Regional Jet CL600-2B19, N8905F, Traverse City, Michigan April 12, 2007 |publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]] |id=NTSB/AAR-08/02 |date=June 10, 2008 |accessdate=January 14, 2015}}</ref>\n* The FAA fined Pinnacle over $1 million for allegedly operating two Canadair Regional Jets in 2009 and 2010 that were not in compliance with FAA regulations.

He currently competes part-time in the [[Stadium Super Trucks]] in the [[Continental Tire]] truck, and part time in the [[24 Hours of LeMans]]. After racing in the NASCAR [[Winter Heat Series]] in the mid-1990s, he was recommended to [[Jack Roush]] by former announcer [[Benny Parsons]]. With [[Roush Racing]], he was the [[1998 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series]] [[1998 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series#Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]].  He won the [[2000 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series|2000 Craftsman Truck championship]]. He reprised this progression in the [[NASCAR Busch Series]], winning the [[2001 NASCAR Busch Series|2001 Rookie of the Year]], immediately followed by winning the [[2002 NASCAR Busch Series|2002 championship]]. Biffle drove in the [[NASCAR Sprint Cup Series]] for Roush from [[2003 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|2003]] until [[2016 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2016]], winning 19 races in the No. 16 Ford. He currently is also an analyst for [[NBC Sports]]' show ''[[NASCAR America]]''.\n\nBiffle, who began his NASCAR career in 1995, is the first of only three drivers that have [[List of NASCAR drivers who have won in each of top three series#Driver championships in two of the top divisions|won a championship in both]] the [[NASCAR Busch Series|Busch Series]] and the [[NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series|Craftsman Truck Series]], and the sixth of only twenty-nine drivers to [[List of NASCAR drivers who have won in each of top three series#Triple Threat|win a race in each of NASCAR's three national series]]. Biffle returned to NASCAR in 2019 when he ran the [[2019 SpeedyCash.com 400]] for [[Kyle Busch Motorsports]], where he won.\n\n==Racing career==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2017}}\nBiffle was born and raised in [[Camas, Washington]].<ref>http://nationwide.nascar.com/nationwide-series/drivers/dps/gbiffle00  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214072900/http://nationwide.nascar.com/nationwide-series/drivers/dps/gbiffle00|date=February 14, 2010}}</ref> He began his racing career driving on [[Short track motor racing|short tracks]] around the [[Pacific Northwest]]. He first gained attention as a driver when he raced in the nationally televised [[Winter Heat Series]] in the winter of 1995\u20131996. Biffle dominated the series championship that winter, leading former ESPN announcer and NASCAR champion, [[Benny Parsons]], to recommend the driver to [[Jack Roush]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roushracing.com/Greg_Biffle/default.asp?page=/greg_biffle/gbbio.htm&menu=greg|title=Greg Biffle|accessdate=June 21, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927223933/http://www.roushracing.com/Greg_Biffle/default.asp?page=%2Fgreg_biffle%2Fgbbio.htm&menu=greg|archivedate=September 27, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nBiffle entered the first two races of the 1996 [[NASCAR Camping World West Series|Winston West Series]], finishing 30th at [[Tucson Raceway Park|Tucson]] and 4th at [[Altamont Raceway Park|Altamont]]. His debut in one of NASCAR's national divisions came later that year when he ran the final two [[Nationwide Series|Busch Series]] races of the season. Driving a [[Chevrolet]] for Dick Bown, he finished 23rd at [[Rockingham Speedway|Rockingham]] but lost an engine the following race at [[Homestead-Miami Speedway|Homestead]] and finished 36th. In 1997, Biffle competed in the now-defunct [[NASCAR AutoZone Elite Division, Northwest Series|NASCAR Northwest Series]] and won the Most Popular Driver Award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://racingone.com/driver.aspx?driverid=214&seriesID=1&subID=1|title=Greg Biffle Profile|publisher=Racingone.com|accessdate=June 21, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103113105/http://racingone.com/driver.aspx?driverID=214&seriesID=1&subid=1|archive-date=January 3, 2010|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Gander Outdoors Truck Series===\nRoush Racing promoted Biffle to a full-time driver in the [[Camping World Truck Series|Craftsman Truck Series]] in 1998. Despite not winning a race that season, Biffle's four pole positions are the most by a Truck Series rookie to date and they helped him earn an 8th-place finish in the final standings and the [[NASCAR Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] Award. He followed it up with a stellar 1999 season in which he recorded nine wins, a single-season Truck Series record that still stands {{as of |2018 |lc=y}}. He finished second in the final standings, just eight points behind champion [[Jack Sprague]].\n\nIn 2000, Biffle won the Truck Series title with another five-win season, beating his Roush teammate [[Kurt Busch]] by 230 points. It was Biffle's first championship in one of NASCAR's three major series. It was announced that Biffle would move up to the Busch Series for 2001, however, he ran four more Truck races for Roush that season and won at Phoenix. Biffle made a Truck Series start in 2004 for another long-time Ford team, [[Circle Bar Racing]], at Homestead.\n\n[[File:Biffle at Texas 2019.jpg|thumb|Biffle ahead of [[Matt Crafton]] at [[Texas Motor Speedway|Texas]] in 2019.]]\nOn March 28, 2019, Biffle announced he would be testing with [[Kyle Busch Motorsports]] the next day at [[Texas Motor Speedway]] in the No. 51 truck.

The following season, he won another four races and earned 20 top-five finishes out of 34 races en route to his first Busch Series title and the second NASCAR national championship of his career.\n\nHe ran only part-time in 2003 as Roush moved him up to a full-time ride in the [[Sprint Cup Series|Winston Cup Series]] for that season, but he returned to contend for the Busch Series championship again in 2004. He placed third in the standings behind [[Martin Truex Jr.]] and [[Kyle Busch]]. From 2005 to 2009, Biffle raced part-time for Roush Fenway Racing in the Busch (now Xfinity Series) every year. He won twice in 2009, at [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway|Las Vegas]] and [[Phoenix International Raceway|Phoenix]], after going winless the previous two seasons. Biffle returned to the Nationwide Series in 2010, driving the No. 27 Ford for [[Baker Curb Racing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/2010/news/headlines/bg/01/09/gbiffle.baker.curb/index.html|title=Biffle back at Baker Curb, will drive No. 27 Ford|publisher=NASCAR.com |date=January 9, 2010|accessdate=June 21, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112121835/http://www.nascar.com/2010/news/headlines/bg/01/09/gbiffle.baker.curb/index.html|archivedate=January 12, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Sprint Cup Series===\n[[File:Greg Biffle 2008 3M Ford Fusion.jpg|thumb|left|2008 Cup racecar]]\nBiffle began his Cup Series career in the 2002 season. He attempted to qualify in a Roush Ford for the [[2002 Daytona 500]] but failed to make the race. He would make his first Cup debut nine races later at [[Auto Club Speedway|California]], a race in which he finished 13th. That was his best finish in seven races that year as he also drove four in a Chevrolet for [[Andy Petree Racing]] and two in a Dodge for [[Petty Enterprises]].\n\nBiffle began competing full-time in NASCAR's top division in 2003, with a sponsorship from [[W. W. Grainger]], who had previously sponsored him in the Busch and Truck Series. He earned his first win in the [[Coke Zero 400|Pepsi 400]] at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] that season and finished second to [[Jamie McMurray]] (who would later join him as a teammate at Roush) for Raybestos Rookie of the Year. Biffle placed 20th in the final points standings.\n\nBiffle made an immediate impact in his sophomore season in 2004, earning the pole in the Daytona 500. However, Biffle was forced to start at the rear due to an engine change. Despite missing NASCAR's first-ever [[Chase for the Sprint Cup|Chase for the NEXTEL Cup]], Biffle won twice that season, at [[Michigan International Speedway|Michigan]] and Homestead en route to a 17th-place finish in the final points standings.\n\n2005 was Biffle's breakout season. He won six races (at California Speedway, Texas, Darlington, Dover, and Michigan along with the season finale at Homestead), the most of any driver that year, and qualified for the Chase for the first time in his career, bringing home a second-place finish in the standings, 35 points behind champion [[Tony Stewart]]; Biffle tied with his teammate [[Carl Edwards]] in points but won the tie-breaker based on race wins.\n\nBiffle regressed in 2006, missing the Chase for the Cup despite winning twice at [[Darlington Raceway]] and [[Homestead\u2013Miami Speedway|Homestead-Miami Speedway]] (both of which were tracks at which he had also won in the previous season). He finished 13th in the standings, third-best of the drivers not to qualify for the Chase. He also missed the Chase the following year, in a season marred by the No. 16 team's new primary sponsor [[Ameriquest Mortgage]] suffering financial difficulty and having to sell off a number of its race sponsorships. Biffle won only one race in 2007, at [[Kansas Speedway]]. As Biffle was doing burnouts on the track, third place [[Jimmie Johnson]] and second place [[Clint Bowyer]] accused Biffle of not maintaining speed under a final lap caution but this was denied by NASCAR who said Biffle had pace car speed.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nIn 2007, Biffle finished 14th in the standings, second-best of the non-Chase drivers as the Chase expanded to a 12-driver format that year.\n\nIn June 2008, Biffle signed a year-long contract extension with Roush Fenway Racing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gnextinc.com/nascar/drivers/news/greg_biffle.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20110604213838/http://www.gnextinc.com/nascar/drivers/news/greg_biffle.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 4, 2011 |title=Biffle signs 3-year extension with Roush Fenway |publisher=Gnextinc.com |accessdate=June 21, 2013 }}</ref> Despite going winless during the 26-race regular season, Biffle made for the Chase for the Sprint Cup that year and won the first two Chase races, at [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway|New Hampshire]] and [[Dover International Speedway|Dover]]. In doing so, he became the first driver to win the first two Chase races in a season.\n\nBiffle qualified for the Chase for the second year in a row in 2009 but for the first time since 2002 (when he ran a limited schedule), failed to record a win. During a test in January 2009 at Texas World Speedway, Biffle managed to reach {{convert|218|mi/h}} in a test for [[Roush Fenway Racing]] as part of evading NASCAR's testing ban. This became the fastest time ever achieved on this track by any competitor (amateur or professional).\n\nIn 2010, Biffle qualified for the third year in a row for the Chase despite spotty performance in the regular season. He won twice at Pocono and Kansas.\nIn 2011, Biffle's season improved, thanks in part to the implementation of Ford's new FR9 engine. However, crew chief [[Greg Erwin]] was replaced after Kentucky by Matt Puccia. The addition of Puccia helped Biffle's performance late in the season, despite the team missing the Chase and finishing 16th in points. Biffle missed the Chase in 2011 for the first time since 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2012/12/12/gbiffle-season-in-review-2012.html |title=Year in Review: Slow start in Chase cost Biffle chance at winning championship |publisher=NASCAR.com |date=December 12, 2012 |accessdate=November 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Greg Biffle, 2013 STP Gas Booster 500.JPG|thumb|Biffle competes in the [[2013 STP Gas Booster 500]]]]\nIn 2012, Biffle and Puccia remained at RFR, and gained the points lead after Las Vegas after three consecutive third-place finishes. At the [[2012 Daytona 500]], Biffle found himself second coming to the white flag for the third time in two years and again finished third.

He currently competes part-time in the [[Stadium Super Trucks]] in the [[Continental Tire]] truck, and part time in the [[24 Hours of LeMans]]. After racing in the NASCAR [[Winter Heat Series]] in the mid-1990s, he was recommended to [[Jack Roush]] by former announcer [[Benny Parsons]]. With [[Roush Racing]], he was the [[1998 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series]] [[1998 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series#Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]].  He won the [[2000 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series|2000 Craftsman Truck championship]]. He reprised this progression in the [[NASCAR Busch Series]], winning the [[2001 NASCAR Busch Series|2001 Rookie of the Year]], immediately followed by winning the [[2002 NASCAR Busch Series|2002 championship]]. Biffle drove in the [[NASCAR Sprint Cup Series]] for Roush from [[2003 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|2003]] until [[2016 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2016]], winning 19 races in the No. 16 Ford. He currently is also an analyst for [[NBC Sports]]' show ''[[NASCAR America]]''.\n\nBiffle, who began his NASCAR career in 1995, is the first of only three drivers that have [[List of NASCAR drivers who have won in each of top three series#Driver championships in two of the top divisions|won a championship in both]] the [[NASCAR Busch Series|Busch Series]] and the [[NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series|Craftsman Truck Series]], and the sixth of only twenty-nine drivers to [[List of NASCAR drivers who have won in each of top three series#Triple Threat|win a race in each of NASCAR's three national series]]. Biffle returned to NASCAR in 2019 when he ran the [[2019 SpeedyCash.com 400]] for [[Kyle Busch Motorsports]], where he won.\n\n==Racing career==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2017}}\nBiffle was born and raised in [[Camas, Washington]].<ref>http://nationwide.nascar.com/nationwide-series/drivers/dps/gbiffle00  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214072900/http://nationwide.nascar.com/nationwide-series/drivers/dps/gbiffle00|date=February 14, 2010}}</ref> He began his racing career driving on [[Short track motor racing|short tracks]] around the [[Pacific Northwest]]. He first gained attention as a driver when he raced in the nationally televised [[Winter Heat Series]] in the winter of 1995\u20131996. Biffle dominated the series championship that winter, leading former ESPN announcer and NASCAR champion, [[Benny Parsons]], to recommend the driver to [[Jack Roush]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roushracing.com/Greg_Biffle/default.asp?page=/greg_biffle/gbbio.htm&menu=greg|title=Greg Biffle|accessdate=June 21, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927223933/http://www.roushracing.com/Greg_Biffle/default.asp?page=%2Fgreg_biffle%2Fgbbio.htm&menu=greg|archivedate=September 27, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nBiffle entered the first two races of the 1996 [[NASCAR Camping World West Series|Winston West Series]], finishing 30th at [[Tucson Raceway Park|Tucson]] and 4th at [[Altamont Raceway Park|Altamont]]. His debut in one of NASCAR's national divisions came later that year when he ran the final two [[Nationwide Series|Busch Series]] races of the season. Driving a [[Chevrolet]] for Dick Bown, he finished 23rd at [[Rockingham Speedway|Rockingham]] but lost an engine the following race at [[Homestead-Miami Speedway|Homestead]] and finished 36th. In 1997, Biffle competed in the now-defunct [[NASCAR AutoZone Elite Division, Northwest Series|NASCAR Northwest Series]] and won the Most Popular Driver Award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://racingone.com/driver.aspx?driverid=214&seriesID=1&subID=1|title=Greg Biffle Profile|publisher=Racingone.com|accessdate=June 21, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103113105/http://racingone.com/driver.aspx?driverID=214&seriesID=1&subid=1|archive-date=January 3, 2010|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Gander Outdoors Truck Series===\nRoush Racing promoted Biffle to a full-time driver in the [[Camping World Truck Series|Craftsman Truck Series]] in 1998. Despite not winning a race that season, Biffle's four pole positions are the most by a Truck Series rookie to date and they helped him earn an 8th-place finish in the final standings and the [[NASCAR Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] Award. He followed it up with a stellar 1999 season in which he recorded nine wins, a single-season Truck Series record that still stands {{as of |2018 |lc=y}}. He finished second in the final standings, just eight points behind champion [[Jack Sprague]].\n\nIn 2000, Biffle won the Truck Series title with another five-win season, beating his Roush teammate [[Kurt Busch]] by 230 points. It was Biffle's first championship in one of NASCAR's three major series. It was announced that Biffle would move up to the Busch Series for 2001, however, he ran four more Truck races for Roush that season and won at Phoenix. Biffle made a Truck Series start in 2004 for another long-time Ford team, [[Circle Bar Racing]], at Homestead.\n\n[[File:Biffle at Texas 2019.jpg|thumb|Biffle ahead of [[Matt Crafton]] at [[Texas Motor Speedway|Texas]] in 2019.]]\nOn March 28, 2019, Biffle announced he would be testing with [[Kyle Busch Motorsports]] the next day at [[Texas Motor Speedway]] in the No. 51 truck.

The following season, he won another four races and earned 20 top-five finishes out of 34 races en route to his first Busch Series title and the second NASCAR national championship of his career.\n\nHe ran only part-time in 2003 as Roush moved him up to a full-time ride in the [[Sprint Cup Series|Winston Cup Series]] for that season, but he returned to contend for the Busch Series championship again in 2004. He placed third in the standings behind [[Martin Truex Jr.]] and [[Kyle Busch]]. From 2005 to 2009, Biffle raced part-time for Roush Fenway Racing in the Busch (now Xfinity Series) every year. He won twice in 2009, at [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway|Las Vegas]] and [[Phoenix International Raceway|Phoenix]], after going winless the previous two seasons. Biffle returned to the Nationwide Series in 2010, driving the No. 27 Ford for [[Baker Curb Racing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/2010/news/headlines/bg/01/09/gbiffle.baker.curb/index.html|title=Biffle back at Baker Curb, will drive No. 27 Ford|publisher=NASCAR.com |date=January 9, 2010|accessdate=June 21, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112121835/http://www.nascar.com/2010/news/headlines/bg/01/09/gbiffle.baker.curb/index.html|archivedate=January 12, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Sprint Cup Series===\n[[File:Greg Biffle 2008 3M Ford Fusion.jpg|thumb|left|2008 Cup racecar]]\nBiffle began his Cup Series career in the 2002 season. He attempted to qualify in a Roush Ford for the [[2002 Daytona 500]] but failed to make the race. He would make his first Cup debut nine races later at [[Auto Club Speedway|California]], a race in which he finished 13th. That was his best finish in seven races that year as he also drove four in a Chevrolet for [[Andy Petree Racing]] and two in a Dodge for [[Petty Enterprises]].\n\nBiffle began competing full-time in NASCAR's top division in 2003, with a sponsorship from [[W. W. Grainger]], who had previously sponsored him in the Busch and Truck Series. He earned his first win in the [[Coke Zero 400|Pepsi 400]] at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] that season and finished second to [[Jamie McMurray]] (who would later join him as a teammate at Roush) for Raybestos Rookie of the Year. Biffle placed 20th in the final points standings.\n\nBiffle made an immediate impact in his sophomore season in 2004, earning the pole in the Daytona 500. However, Biffle was forced to start at the rear due to an engine change. Despite missing NASCAR's first-ever [[Chase for the Sprint Cup|Chase for the NEXTEL Cup]], Biffle won twice that season, at [[Michigan International Speedway|Michigan]] and Homestead en route to a 17th-place finish in the final points standings.\n\n2005 was Biffle's breakout season. He won six races (at California Speedway, Texas, Darlington, Dover, and Michigan along with the season finale at Homestead), the most of any driver that year, and qualified for the Chase for the first time in his career, bringing home a second-place finish in the standings, 35 points behind champion [[Tony Stewart]]; Biffle tied with his teammate [[Carl Edwards]] in points but won the tie-breaker based on race wins.\n\nBiffle regressed in 2006, missing the Chase for the Cup despite winning twice at [[Darlington Raceway]] and [[Homestead\u2013Miami Speedway|Homestead-Miami Speedway]] (both of which were tracks at which he had also won in the previous season). He finished 13th in the standings, third-best of the drivers not to qualify for the Chase. He also missed the Chase the following year, in a season marred by the No. 16 team's new primary sponsor [[Ameriquest Mortgage]] suffering financial difficulty and having to sell off a number of its race sponsorships. Biffle won only one race in 2007, at [[Kansas Speedway]]. As Biffle was doing burnouts on the track, third place [[Jimmie Johnson]] and second place [[Clint Bowyer]] accused Biffle of not maintaining speed under a final lap caution but this was denied by NASCAR who said Biffle had pace car speed.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nIn 2007, Biffle finished 14th in the standings, second-best of the non-Chase drivers as the Chase expanded to a 12-driver format that year.\n\nIn June 2008, Biffle signed a year-long contract extension with Roush Fenway Racing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gnextinc.com/nascar/drivers/news/greg_biffle.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20110604213838/http://www.gnextinc.com/nascar/drivers/news/greg_biffle.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 4, 2011 |title=Biffle signs 3-year extension with Roush Fenway |publisher=Gnextinc.com |accessdate=June 21, 2013 }}</ref> Despite going winless during the 26-race regular season, Biffle made for the Chase for the Sprint Cup that year and won the first two Chase races, at [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway|New Hampshire]] and [[Dover International Speedway|Dover]]. In doing so, he became the first driver to win the first two Chase races in a season.\n\nBiffle qualified for the Chase for the second year in a row in 2009 but for the first time since 2002 (when he ran a limited schedule), failed to record a win. During a test in January 2009 at Texas World Speedway, Biffle managed to reach {{convert|218|mi/h}} in a test for [[Roush Fenway Racing]] as part of evading NASCAR's testing ban. This became the fastest time ever achieved on this track by any competitor (amateur or professional).\n\nIn 2010, Biffle qualified for the third year in a row for the Chase despite spotty performance in the regular season. He won twice at Pocono and Kansas.\nIn 2011, Biffle's season improved, thanks in part to the implementation of Ford's new FR9 engine. However, crew chief [[Greg Erwin]] was replaced after Kentucky by Matt Puccia. The addition of Puccia helped Biffle's performance late in the season, despite the team missing the Chase and finishing 16th in points. Biffle missed the Chase in 2011 for the first time since 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2012/12/12/gbiffle-season-in-review-2012.html |title=Year in Review: Slow start in Chase cost Biffle chance at winning championship |publisher=NASCAR.com |date=December 12, 2012 |accessdate=November 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Greg Biffle, 2013 STP Gas Booster 500.JPG|thumb|Biffle competes in the [[2013 STP Gas Booster 500]]]]\nIn 2012, Biffle and Puccia remained at RFR, and gained the points lead after Las Vegas after three consecutive third-place finishes. At the [[2012 Daytona 500]], Biffle found himself second coming to the white flag for the third time in two years and again finished third. Eerily, the third place at Vegas came in Biffle's 333rd Cup start.

He struggled mightily before picking up a second-place finish in the [[2015 Coca-Cola 600]], after starting fourth. He went on to pick up a fifth-place finish at Pocono in the [[2015 Windows 10 400]] and a fourth-place at New Hampshire in the [[2015 Sylvania 300]], finishing twenty in points.\n\nOrtho announced they would depart Roush following the 2015 season, leaving Biffle without a primary sponsor for the [[2016 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2016 season]]. KFC then announced they would sponsor Biffle throughout speedweeks and in the Daytona 500. He earned his first pole position in four seasons during qualifying for the [[2016 Coke Zero 400|Coke Zero 400 at Daytona]], and went on to finish eighth in the race.\n\nAfter finishing 23rd in points in [[2016 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2016]], Biffle and Roush Fenway mutually parted ways, making Biffle a free agent for the upcoming 2017 season.

It was largely based on food collection and hunting but it is also suggested that the J\u014dmon people practiced early agriculture. They gathered [[tree nuts]] and [[shellfish]], laid the foundations for living such as [[hunting]] and [[fishing]], and also made some [[Agriculture|cultivation]].

This virus was discovered as a cause of [[adult T cell leukemia]] (ATL), and research was advanced by [[Takuo Hinuma]] of [[Kyoto University]] [[Virus Research Institute]].\n\nAlthough it was known that many virus carriers existed in Japan, it was not found at all in neighboring countries of [[East Asia]]. Meanwhile, it has been found in many [[Africans]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], [[Tibetans]], [[Siberians]], Burmese people, [[Indigenous people of New Guinea]], Polynesians, etc. Looking at distribution in Japan, it is seen particularly frequently in southern [[Kyushu]], [[Nagasaki Prefecture]], [[Okinawa]] and among the [[Ainu people|Ainu]]. And it is seen at medium frequency in the southern part of [[Shikoku]], southern part of the [[Kii Peninsula]], the Pacific side of the [[T\u014dhoku region]] ([[Sanriku]]) and [[Oki Islands]]. Overall, carriers of the ATL retrovirus were found to be more common in remote areas and remote islands. When examining the well-developed areas of ATL in each region of Kyushu, Shikoku, and T\u014dhoku in detail, carriers are preserved at high rates in small settlements that were isolated from the surroundings and inconvenient for traffic.\n\nThe path of natural infection of this virus is limited to [[vertical infection]] between women and children (most often through breastfeeding) and [[horizontal infection]] between males and females (most often from males to females through sexual intercourse).<ref name = \"Coffin1997\">Coffin JM, Hughes SH, Varmus HE, editors.

Using principal component analysis (PCA) IK002 clusters basal to present-day Southeast and East Asians and the Upper-Paleolithic human remain (40 kya) from Ti\u00e1nyu\u00e1n Cave (ancestors to modern East Asians and Native Americas). However If IK002 were a true outgroup to later East Asian groups, this statistic is expected to be zero for any test population X. However, it find that together with Japanese, present-day Taiwan aborigines (Ami and Atayal), as well as minorities in the Okhotsk-Primorye region (Ulchi and Nivhk) also showed a significant excess of alleles haring with IK002. The highest IK002-related contributions is 41% in the Taiwanese aborigine [[Amis people]]. IK002 shows extra genetic affinity with the indigenous [[Taiwanese indigenous peoples|Taiwanese aborigines]] as well as with the [[Ulch people]], which may also support the hypothesis of gene flow of Jomon-ancestry through migration. The Jomon female IK002 clusters closely with the [[Hokkaido Ainu]], which is supporting previous findings that they are direct descendants of the Jomon people. The PCA plot showed the Jomon female sample IK002 is only slightly different from present-day people in East Eurasia and Japan with exception of Hokkaido Ainu. An ancestral component unique to IK002 is the most prevalent in the Hokkaido Ainu (average 79.3%). This component is also found at a minor percentage in mainland Japanese as well as East Siberian groups such as Ulchi (9.8% and 6.0%, respectively) who are natives in the [[Ulchsky District]] of [[Khabarovsk Krai]]. IK002 can be modelled as a basal lineage relative closer to East Asians, Northeast Asia/East Siberians, and Native Americans. The authors concluded that the ancestral J\u014dmon population may have arrived to East Asia and Japan through the southern Himalayas and Southeast Asia but say that more ancient genome data is needed to recreate their origin and migration.<ref name=\"biorxiv.org\"/>\n\n=== Funadomari J\u014dmon study (2019) ===\nA full genome analysis (Kanzawa-Kiriyama et al. 2019),<ref>[https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ase/advpub/0/advpub_190415/_pdf/-char/en Late Jomon male and female genome sequences from the Funadomari site in Hokkaido, Japan - Hideaki Kanzawa-Kiriyama, Department of Anthropology, National Museum of Nature and Science 2018/2019en]</ref> using high-confidence SNPs and functional SNP assessments to assign possible phenotypic characteristics as well as Y-chromosome polymorphisms, analysed a male and a female Jomon sample. The Funadomari archaeological site is located on a sandbar separating Lake Kushu from Funadomari Bay on the north coast of [[Rebun Island]], a small island off the northwestern tip of Hokkaid\u014d. The study results suggest that the J\u014dmon are their own distinct population and not closely related to other populations. The Funadomari J\u014dmon are not related to Australo-Melanesians (including Andamanese) or Africans. The J\u014dmon are closer to Eurasian populations and form a cluster near the \u201cBasal East Asians\u201d.\n\nModern Japanese share about 9% to 13% of their genome with the J\u014dmon. J\u014dmon specific genome is also found in minor percentage in populations of Northeast Asia and Southeast Asia, suggesting gene-flow from J\u014dmon related groups. Additionally, the J\u014dmon share specific gene alleles with populations in the [[Arctic]] regions of Eurasia and northern America.\n\nTests using phylogenetic relationship suggests that the Funadomari J\u014dmon have about 86% East Asian related ancestry and about 14% West Asian/European related ancestry. According to the authors, more data is needed to explain these results and possible consequences.\n\n=== Rebun J\u014dmon study (2019) ===\nAnother full genome analysis of a 3,800 year old J\u014dmon woman shows that this sample shared gene variants which are found only in [[Arctic]] populations of [[Eurasia]], but are absent elsewhere. According to the authors this provides evidence that the Jomon fished and hunted fatty sea and land animals. The sample also showed a higher alcohol tolerance than other Eastern Eurasian populations. Further analysis suggest that the J\u014dmon sample was at high risk of developing [[liver spot]]<nowiki/>s if she spent to much time in the sun.

This virus was discovered as a cause of [[adult T cell leukemia]] (ATL), and research was advanced by [[Takuo Hinuma]] of [[Kyoto University]] [[Virus Research Institute]].\n\nAlthough it was known that many virus carriers existed in Japan, it was not found at all in neighboring countries of [[East Asia]]. Meanwhile, it has been found in many [[Africans]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], [[Tibetans]], [[Siberians]], Burmese people, [[Indigenous people of New Guinea]], Polynesians, etc. Looking at distribution in Japan, it is seen particularly frequently in southern [[Kyushu]], [[Nagasaki Prefecture]], [[Okinawa]] and among the [[Ainu people|Ainu]]. And it is seen at medium frequency in the southern part of [[Shikoku]], southern part of the [[Kii Peninsula]], the Pacific side of the [[T\u014dhoku region]] ([[Sanriku]]) and [[Oki Islands]]. Overall, carriers of the ATL retrovirus were found to be more common in remote areas and remote islands. When examining the well-developed areas of ATL in each region of Kyushu, Shikoku, and T\u014dhoku in detail, carriers are preserved at high rates in small settlements that were isolated from the surroundings and inconvenient for traffic.\n\nThe path of natural infection of this virus is limited to [[vertical infection]] between women and children (most often through breastfeeding) and [[horizontal infection]] between males and females (most often from males to females through sexual intercourse).<ref name = \"Coffin1997\">Coffin JM, Hughes SH, Varmus HE, editors.

Using principal component analysis (PCA) IK002 clusters basal to present-day Southeast and East Asians and the Upper-Paleolithic human remain (40 kya) from Ti\u00e1nyu\u00e1n Cave (ancestors to modern East Asians and Native Americas). However If IK002 were a true outgroup to later East Asian groups, this statistic is expected to be zero for any test population X. However, it find that together with Japanese, present-day Taiwan aborigines (Ami and Atayal), as well as minorities in the Okhotsk-Primorye region (Ulchi and Nivhk) also showed a significant excess of alleles haring with IK002. The highest IK002-related contributions is 41% in the Taiwanese aborigine [[Amis people]]. IK002 shows extra genetic affinity with the indigenous [[Taiwanese indigenous peoples|Taiwanese aborigines]] as well as with the [[Ulch people]], which may also support the hypothesis of gene flow of Jomon-ancestry through migration. The Jomon female IK002 clusters closely with the [[Hokkaido Ainu]], which is supporting previous findings that they are direct descendants of the Jomon people. The PCA plot showed the Jomon female sample IK002 is only slightly different from present-day people in East Eurasia and Japan with exception of Hokkaido Ainu. An ancestral component unique to IK002 is the most prevalent in the Hokkaido Ainu (average 79.3%). This component is also found at a minor percentage in mainland Japanese as well as East Siberian groups such as Ulchi (9.8% and 6.0%, respectively) who are natives in the [[Ulchsky District]] of [[Khabarovsk Krai]]. IK002 can be modelled as a basal lineage relative closer to East Asians, Northeast Asia/East Siberians, and Native Americans. The authors concluded that the ancestral J\u014dmon population may have arrived to East Asia and Japan through the southern Himalayas and Southeast Asia but say that more ancient genome data is needed to recreate their origin and migration.<ref name=\"biorxiv.org\"/>\n\n=== Funadomari J\u014dmon study (2019) ===\nA full genome analysis (Kanzawa-Kiriyama et al. 2019),<ref>[https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ase/advpub/0/advpub_190415/_pdf/-char/en Late Jomon male and female genome sequences from the Funadomari site in Hokkaido, Japan - Hideaki Kanzawa-Kiriyama, Department of Anthropology, National Museum of Nature and Science 2018/2019en]</ref> using high-confidence SNPs and functional SNP assessments to assign possible phenotypic characteristics as well as Y-chromosome polymorphisms, analysed a male and a female Jomon sample. The Funadomari archaeological site is located on a sandbar separating Lake Kushu from Funadomari Bay on the north coast of [[Rebun Island]], a small island off the northwestern tip of Hokkaid\u014d. The study results suggest that the J\u014dmon are their own distinct population and not closely related to other populations. The Funadomari J\u014dmon are not related to Australo-Melanesians (including Andamanese) or Africans. The J\u014dmon are closer to Eurasian populations and form a cluster near the \u201cBasal East Asians\u201d.\n\nModern Japanese share about 9% to 13% of their genome with the J\u014dmon. J\u014dmon specific genome is also found in minor percentage in populations of Northeast Asia and Southeast Asia, suggesting gene-flow from J\u014dmon related groups. Additionally, the J\u014dmon share specific gene alleles with populations in the [[Arctic]] regions of Eurasia and northern America.\n\nTests using phylogenetic relationship suggests that the Funadomari J\u014dmon have about 86% East Asian related ancestry and about 14% West Asian/European related ancestry. According to the authors, more data is needed to explain these results and possible consequences.\n\n=== Rebun J\u014dmon study (2019) ===\nAnother full genome analysis of a 3,800 year old J\u014dmon woman shows that this sample shared gene variants which are found only in [[Arctic]] populations of [[Eurasia]], but are absent elsewhere. According to the authors this provides evidence that the Jomon fished and hunted fatty sea and land animals. The sample also showed a higher alcohol tolerance than other Eastern Eurasian populations. Further analysis suggest that the J\u014dmon sample was at high risk of developing [[liver spot]]<nowiki/>s if she spent to much time in the sun.

They realized that to take the idea further, they'd need an iPhone developer. Fishman visited RentACoder.com, found Russian developer Igor Solomennikov, and introduced him to Koum.\n\nKoum named the app WhatsApp to sound like \"what's up\".
