Chicana feminism challenges the stereotypes that Chicanas face across lines of gender, ethnicity, race, class, and sexuality. Most importantly, Chicana feminism serves as a movement, theory and praxis that helps women reclaim their existence between and among the [[Chicano Movement]] and [[Feminism in the United States|American feminist movements]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Chicana Feminist Thought: The Basic Historical Writings|last=Garcia|first=Alma|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1997|isbn=9780415918015|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\nIn 1848, with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, Mexico ceded to the US: Arizona, California, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, and part of Colorado and Wyoming. Former citizens of Mexico living in those territories became US citizens. Therefore, during the twentieth century, Hispanic [[immigration]] to the United States began to slowly but steadily change American demographics. In Latin America, women at those times had to act according to social standards. In many Latin American cities, women were criticized for speaking to men they did not know whereas men were not criticized, but rather praised for doing so; being seen as heroic if they had multiple girlfriends, regardless of marital status. As a result, the women who immigrated hoped to change their social conditions by beginning a [[Women's suffrage|women's suffrage movement]] for Mexican American women. By 1940, [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] was one of the cities with the densest Chicano population in the United States, resulting in even more women joining the movement in solidarity, such as [[Adelina Otero-Warren]] and [[Maria de Lopez|Maria de G.E. Lopez]].\n\nIn the 1960s and \u201970s, more groups began to fight for their rights in the United States, which had been disregarded until their outcry began. Emerging out of the identity movements of the 1960s, Chicana feminists created a distinctive trajectory and mapping of feminist political thought and practice that associated unique experiences with gender, race, class, and sexuality.<ref>\"The Research Context\", by A\u00edda Hurtado. In ''Voicing Chicana Feminisms'', by A\u00edda Hurtado. (New York, NY: New York University Press, 2003).</ref>\n\nUnlike women of minority races, white women rarely had to deal with [[racism]]. Euro-American women combated this with the emergence of waves of feminism; the [[First-wave feminism|first wave]] addressed suffrage, while the [[Second-wave feminism|second wave of feminism]] discussed issues of sexuality, public vs. private spheres, reproductive rights, and marital rape. Chicana feminists distinguished themselves from other feminist movements by offering critiques and responses to their exclusion from both the mainstream Chicano nationalist movement and the [[Second-wave feminism|second wave feminist movement]]. One important way they were able to do this was through the inclusion of different varieties of the Spanish language, a vital component to the preservation of Chicana culture.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Hurtado|first=A\u00edda|year=1998|title=Sitios y lenguas: Chicanas theorize feminisms|url=http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/em/email_images/Jrnls/fall2014-IUJournals.pdf?CDpath=4_58|journal=Hypatia|volume=13|issue=2|pages=134\u2013161|doi=10.2979/HYP.1998.13.2.134|issn=0887-5367|via=EBSCO}}</ref><!-- BEGIN RESTORE: The following content is from version 691286145 of 21:18, November 18, 2015 by User:Pachuca chula73 -->Chicana feminism emphasizes that throughout history, Latin American women have been oppressed and abused in many different societies.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World|date=2011|publisher=SAGE Reference|editor1-last=Stange|editor1-first=Mary Zeiss|editor1-link=Chicana Feminism|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=249\u2013251|editor2-last=Oyster|editor2-first=Carol|editor3-last=Sloan|editor3-first=Jane}}</ref> In Latin America, just as in Europe, Asia, and Africa, many women were, for centuries, discriminated against by their fathers, brothers and husbands.\n\n=== Origin ===\nChicana feminists challenged their prescribed role in ''la familia'', and demanded to have the [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] experiences that they faced recognized.

With the emergence of the Chicano Movement, the structure of Chicano families saw dramatic changes. Specifically, women began to question the role that they were assigned within the family and where their place was within the Chicano national struggle.<ref name=\"garcia217-238\">Garcia, A. M.

While the event was the first major gathering of its kind, the conference itself was fraught with discord as Chicanas from geographically and ideologically divergent positions sparred over the role of feminism within the Chicano movement. These conflicts led to a walkout on the final day of the conference.<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u00a1Chicana Power!: Contested Histories of Feminism in the Chicano Movement|last=Blackwell|first=Maylei|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1477312667|location=Austin, TX|pages=161\u2013164}}</ref>\n\nRevolutionary Chicanas during this time period, while critiquing the inability of the mainstream Chicano nationalist movements to address sexism and misogyny, simultaneously renounced the mainstream Second Wave feminist movement for its inability to include racism and classism in their politics. Chicanas during this time felt excluded from mainstream feminist movements because they had different needs, concerns and demands. Through persistent objections to their exclusions women have gone from being called Chicano women to Chicanas to introducing the adoption of a/o or o/a as a way of acknowledging both genders when discussing the community. Chicanas demanded free day-care centers and a reform of the welfare system, they sought to fight against all three structures of oppression they faced, including sexism, but also prioritizing racism and imperialism.\n\nOne of the First Chicana organizations was the [[Comisi\u00f3n Femenil Mexicana Nacional]] (CFMN), founded in 1973.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yo Soy Chicana: A Chicana Feminist Movement|url=https://www.kcet.org/shows/departures/yo-soy-chicana-a-chicana-feminist-movement|publisher=KCET|accessdate=24 March 2018|language=en|date=7 November 2011}}</ref> The concept for the CFMN originated during the National Chicano Issues Conference when a group of attending Chicanas noticed that their concerns were not adequately addressed at the Chicano conference.

In ''Voicing Chicana Feminisms'', by A\u00edda Hurtado</ref> These archetypes have prevented Chicanas from achieving sexual and bodily agency due to the ways they have been historically constructed as negative categories through the lenses of patriarchy and colonialism.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Indian Women in Early Mexico|last=Schroeder|first=Susan|last2=Wood|first2=Stephanie|last3=Haskett|first3=Robert|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=1997|isbn=9780806129709|location=|pages=292\u2013312|chapter=14}}</ref> Shifting the discourse from a traditional (patriarchal) representation of these archetypes to a de-colonial feminist understanding of them is a crucial element of contemporary Chicana feminism, and represents the starting point for a reclamation of Chicana female power, sexuality, and spirituality.\n\nLa Virgen de Guadalupe and La Malinche have become symbolic means of suppressing Chicana women's sexuality through the patriarchal dichotomy of puta/virgin, the positive role model and the negative one, historically and continuously held up before Mexican women as icons and mirrors in which to examine their own self-image and define their self-esteem.<ref name=\":2\" /> Gloria Anzald\u00faa's canonical text addresses the subversive power of reclaiming indigenous spirituality to unlearn colonial and patriarchal constructions and restrictions on women, their sexuality, and understandings of motherhood. Anzald\u00faa writes, \"I will no longer be made to feel ashamed of existing. I will have my voice: Indian, Spanish, white\".<ref name=\":4\" /> La Malinche is a victim of centuries of patriarchal myths that permeate the Mexican woman's consciousness, often without her awareness.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nMalintzin (also known as Do\u00f1a Marina by the Spaniards or \"La Malinche\" post-Mexican independence from Spain) was born around 1505 to noble indigenous parents in rural Mexico. Since indigenous women were often used as pawns for political alliances at this time, she was betrayed by her parents and sold into slavery between the ages of 12\u201314, traded to Hernan Cort\u00e9s as a concubine, and because of her intelligence and fluency in multiple languages, was promoted to his \"wife\" and diplomat. She served as Cort\u00e9s's translator, playing a key role in the Spaniard's conquest of Tenochtitlan and, by extension, the conquest of Mexico.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mexican history : a primary source reader|publisher=Westview Press|year=2009|editor-last=Jaffary|editor-first=Nora E.|pages=72|chapter=12.

Because of Malintzin's relationship with Cort\u00e9s and her role as translator and informant in Spain's conquest of Mexico, she was seen as a traitor to her race. By contrast, Chicana feminism calls for a different understanding. Since nationalism was a concept unknown to Indigenous people in the 16th century, Malintzin had no sense of herself as \"Indian\", making it impossible for her to show ethnic loyalty or conscientiously act as a traitor. Malintzin was one of millions of women who were traded and sold in Mexico pre-colonization. With no way to escape a group of men, and inevitably rape, Malintzin showed loyalty to Cort\u00e9s to ensure her survival.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nLa Malinche has become the representative of a female sexuality that is passive, \"rape-able\", and always guilty of betrayal.<ref name=\":2\" /> Rather than a traitor or a \"whore\", Chicana feminism calls for an understanding of her as an agent within her limited means, resisting rape and torture (as was common among her peers) by becoming a partner and translator to Cort\u00e9s. Placing the blame for Mexico's conquest on Malintzin creates a foundation for placing upon women the responsibility to be the moral compasses of society and blames them for their sexuality, which is counterintuitive. It is important to understand Malintzin as a victim not of Cort\u00e9s, but of myth. Chicana feminism calls for an understanding in which she should be praised for the adaptive resistance she exhibited that ultimately led to her survival.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nBy challenging patriarchal and colonial representations, Chicana writers re-construct their relationship to the figure of La Malinche and these other powerful archetypes, and reclaim them in order to re-frame a spirituality and identity that is both decolonizing and empowering.<ref>Herrera, Cristina. ''Contemporary Chicana Literature: (Re)Writing the Maternal Script''. Amherst: Cambria Press, 2014.</ref>\n\n== Cultural identities and spirituality ==\nThe term \"Chicano\" originates from Aztec indigenous peoples who pronounced it \"meshicano\" in the native Nahuatl language. However, historically the Spaniards had no \"sh\" in their vocabulary and pronounced it \"mexicano\" (spelled mexicano), a pronunciation that has been carried into the present. Historically, the term Chicano has not always been positive and empowering. The term Chicano was for a long time used in a demeaning manner, and was associated with newly arrived Mexican immigrants in the early twentieth century until it was later reclaimed by Chicana feminists with the emergence of the [[Chicano Movement|Chicano Nationalist Movement]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/postcolonialstudies/2014/06/20/chicana-feminism/|title=Postcolonial Studies {{!}} Chicana Feminism|website=scholarblogs.emory.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-11}}</ref> The term was used to distinguish first-generation, American-born Mexican-Americans from the older generations of Mexican immigrants; two groups that were often separated by a language barrier. Most first-generation American Chicanos adopted English as their first language, with some Chicanos blending both English and Spanish to create a hybrid dialect or slang argot called [[Cal\u00f3 (Chicano)|cal\u00f3]] (also called pachuco). The U.S. media, not being able to fully understand these emerging American identities, stigmatized Chicanos and Mexican in propagating the notion that came from a country of corruption, and that they were criminals, thieves, and immoral people.\n\nThe definitions of Chicana/o in the United States are contested. Because many Chicana/os are born to parents who are immigrants from Mexico, one definition of Chicana/o is rooted in the idea that this identity straddles two different worlds. The first world is that of the country of origin from which their families descended from, such as Mexico, Guatemala, or El Salvador. Many Chicanos today, for example, continue to practice the religion, language, and culture of their respective family's countries of origin. Another definition of Chicano is rooted in the identity being completely embedded within the \"American\" culture. Many Chicana/os have assimilated into \"American\" culture and use English as their primary language. Despite these two distinctions in definition, some might argue that Chicanos are stigmatized by both cultures because they don't fit into either one completely. For this reason, one view of Chicano identity is that a new culture is created in order to resist oppression and navigate both worlds.\n\nContemporary renditions of the word Chicano have been to replace the \u201cCh\u201d beginning with the letter X, making the word Xicano. This is significant because it recenters the Nahua language and pronunciation of the sound \u201cch\u201d, tying the Xicana/o to indigenous roots and decentering Eurocentric ties to identity.  The Ch is the fourth letter of the Spanish alphabet.\n\nChicana feminism has also created another linguistic change, there is another \u201cx\u201d at the end of Xicanx, and it is being used to be inclusive of others gender identities and move away from a colonial imposed binary and gendered language\n.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rodr\u00edguez|first=Richard T|date=October 2017|title=X marks the spot|journal=Cultural Dynamics|volume= 29| issue = 3, 2017|pages=203\u2013212|doi=10.1177/0921374017727880}}</ref> The usage of Xicanx is due to the feminists trying to move back to indigenous roots as well as trying to create more space for Queer folk who have felt marginalized by previous Chicano/a movements.\n\n=== Duality and \"The New Mestiza\" ===\nThe concept of \"The New Mestiza\" comes from feminist author [[Gloria Anzald\u00faa]]. In her book, ''Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza'', she writes: \"In a constant state of mental nepantilism, an Aztec word meaning torn between ways, la mestiza is a product of the transfer of the cultural and spiritual values of one group to another. Being tricultural, monolingual, bilingual or multilingual, speaking a patois, and in a state of perpetual transition, the mestiza faces the dilemma of the mixed breed: which collectivity does the daughter of a dark-skinned mother listen to? [...] Within us and within la Cultura Chicana, commonly held beliefs of the white culture attack commonly held beliefs of the Mexican culture, and both attack commonly held beliefs of the indigenous culture. Subconsciously, we see an attack on ourselves and our beliefs as a treat and we attempt to block with a counterstance.\"<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza|last=Anzald\u00faa|first=Gloria|year=1987|isbn=9781879960749|location=|pages=40|quote=|via=}}</ref> Anzaldua presents a mode of being for Chicanas, that honors their unique standpoint and lived experience. This theory of embodiment offers a mode of being for Chicanas who are constantly negotiating hybridity and cultural collision, and the ways that inform the way they are continuously making new knowledge and understandings of self, often time in relation to intersecting and various forms of oppression. This theory discloses how a counter-stance cannot be a way of life because it depends on hegemonic constructions of domination, in terms of race, nationality, and culture. A counter-stance locks one into a duel of oppressor and oppressed; locked in mortal combat, like the cop and the criminal, both are reduced to a common denominator of violence.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Anzaldua|first1=Gloria|title=Borderlans/La frontera|publisher=Aunt Lute Books|isbn=978-1-879960-12-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/borderlandslafro00anza_0/page/100 100]|year=1987|url=https://archive.org/details/borderlandslafro00anza_0|url-access=registration}}</ref> Being solely reactionary means nothing is being created, revived or renewed in place of the dominant culture and that the dominant culture must remain dominant for counterstance to exist. For Anzaldua and this theory of embodiment, there must be space to create something new. The \u201cnew mestiza\u201d was a canonical text that redefined what it meant to be Chicana. In this theory, being Chicana entails hybridity, contradictions, tolerance for ambiguity and plurality, nothing is rejected or excluded from histories and legacies of oppression. Further, this theory of embodiment calls for synthesizing all aspects of identity and creating new meanings, not simply balancing or coming together of different aspects of identity.\n\n=== Mujerista ===\nMujerista was largely influenced by the African American women's \"Womanist\" approach proposed by Alice Walker. Mujerista was defined by Ada Mar\u00eda Isasi-D\u00edaz in 1996. This Latina feminist identity draws from the main ideas of womanism by combating inequality and oppression through participation in social justice movements within the Latina/o community.<ref name=\"search.proquest.com\">Tijerina-Revilla, A.

Nepantla can be described as a concept or spirituality in which multiple realities are experienced at the same time (Duality). As a Chicana, understanding and having indigenous ancestral knowledge of spirituality plays an instrumental role in the path to healing, decolonization, cultural appreciation, self-understanding, and self-love.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Nepantla Spirituality: My Path to the Source(s) of Healing|last = Medina|first = Lara|year = |isbn = |location = |page = 168}}</ref> Nepantla is often associated with author Chicana feminist Gloria Anzald\u00faa, who coined the term, \"Nepantlera\". \"Nepantleras are threshold people; they move within and among multiple, often conflicting, worlds and refuse to align themselves exclusively with any single individual, group, or belief system.\"<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.okcir.com/Articles%20IV%20Special/AnaLouiseKeating-FM.pdf|title = From Borderlands and New Mestizas to Nepantlas and Nepantleras Anzald\u00faan Theories for Social Change|date = 2006|accessdate = |website = |last = Keating|first = AnaLouise}}</ref> Nepantla is a mode of being for the Chicana and informs the way she experiences the world and various systems of oppression.\n\n=== Body politics ===\nIn Encarnacion, author Suzanne Bost discusses Illness and Body Politics in Chicana Feminist Literature, about how body politics has shifted in the way it used to be looked at by Chicana feminism.

Examples of Frida Kahlo and her abilities are discussed, as well as Gloria Anzaldua's diabetes, to illustrated how abilities must be discussed when talking about identities. \u201cSince there is no single or constant locus of identification, our analyses must adapt to different cultural frameworks, shifting feelings, and matter that is fluid.[...] our thinking about bodies, identities, and politics must keep moving.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> Chicana feminism needs to move beyond just looking at singular aspects of identities, but using all of them and contextualizing its effects on what is going on in time. Bost uses examples of contemporary Chicana artists and literature to illustrate this: Chicana feminism has not ended; it is just manifesting in different ways now.\n\n=== LGBT interventions ===\nChicana feminist theory evolved as a theory of embodiment and a theory of flesh due to the canonical works of Gloria Anzaldua and Cherrie Moraga, both of whom identify as queer. Queer interventions in Chicana feminist thought called for the inclusion and the honoring of the cultures\u2019 joteria. In La Conciencia de la Mestiza, Gloria Anzaldua wrote, \"the mestizo and the queer exist at this time and point on the evolutionary continuum for a purpose.

Chicana artists worked collaboratively often with not only other women but men as well.\n\nThe momentum created from the Chicano Movement spurred a Chicano Renaissance among Chicanas and Chicanos.

Chicana feminism challenges the stereotypes that Chicanas face across lines of gender, ethnicity, race, class, and sexuality. Most importantly, Chicana feminism serves as a movement, theory and praxis that helps women reclaim their existence between and among the [[Chicano Movement]] and [[Feminism in the United States|American feminist movements]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Chicana Feminist Thought: The Basic Historical Writings|last=Garcia|first=Alma|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1997|isbn=9780415918015|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\nIn 1848, with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, Mexico ceded to the US: Arizona, California, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, and part of Colorado and Wyoming. Former citizens of Mexico living in those territories became US citizens. Therefore, during the twentieth century, Hispanic [[immigration]] to the United States began to slowly but steadily change American demographics. In Latin America, women at those times had to act according to social standards. In many Latin American cities, women were criticized for speaking to men they did not know whereas men were not criticized, but rather praised for doing so; being seen as heroic if they had multiple girlfriends, regardless of marital status. As a result, the women who immigrated hoped to change their social conditions by beginning a [[Women's suffrage|women's suffrage movement]] for Mexican American women. By 1940, [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] was one of the cities with the densest Chicano population in the United States, resulting in even more women joining the movement in solidarity, such as [[Adelina Otero-Warren]] and [[Maria de Lopez|Maria de G.E. Lopez]].\n\nIn the 1960s and \u201970s, more groups began to fight for their rights in the United States, which had been disregarded until their outcry began. Emerging out of the identity movements of the 1960s, Chicana feminists created a distinctive trajectory and mapping of feminist political thought and practice that associated unique experiences with gender, race, class, and sexuality.<ref>\"The Research Context\", by A\u00edda Hurtado. In ''Voicing Chicana Feminisms'', by A\u00edda Hurtado. (New York, NY: New York University Press, 2003).</ref>\n\nUnlike women of minority races, white women rarely had to deal with [[racism]]. Euro-American women combated this with the emergence of waves of feminism; the [[First-wave feminism|first wave]] addressed suffrage, while the [[Second-wave feminism|second wave of feminism]] discussed issues of sexuality, public vs. private spheres, reproductive rights, and marital rape. Chicana feminists distinguished themselves from other feminist movements by offering critiques and responses to their exclusion from both the mainstream Chicano nationalist movement and the [[Second-wave feminism|second wave feminist movement]]. One important way they were able to do this was through the inclusion of different varieties of the Spanish language, a vital component to the preservation of Chicana culture.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Hurtado|first=A\u00edda|year=1998|title=Sitios y lenguas: Chicanas theorize feminisms|url=http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/em/email_images/Jrnls/fall2014-IUJournals.pdf?CDpath=4_58|journal=Hypatia|volume=13|issue=2|pages=134\u2013161|doi=10.2979/HYP.1998.13.2.134|issn=0887-5367|via=EBSCO}}</ref><!-- BEGIN RESTORE: The following content is from version 691286145 of 21:18, November 18, 2015 by User:Pachuca chula73 -->Chicana feminism emphasizes that throughout history, Latin American women have been oppressed and abused in many different societies.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World|date=2011|publisher=SAGE Reference|editor1-last=Stange|editor1-first=Mary Zeiss|editor1-link=Chicana Feminism|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=249\u2013251|editor2-last=Oyster|editor2-first=Carol|editor3-last=Sloan|editor3-first=Jane}}</ref> In Latin America, just as in Europe, Asia, and Africa, many women were, for centuries, discriminated against by their fathers, brothers and husbands.\n\n=== Origin ===\nChicana feminists challenged their prescribed role in ''la familia'', and demanded to have the [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] experiences that they faced recognized.

This included breaking the mujer buena/mujer mala myth, in which the domestic Spanish Woman is viewed as good and the Indigenous Woman that is a part of the community is viewed as bad.

While the event was the first major gathering of its kind, the conference itself was fraught with discord as Chicanas from geographically and ideologically divergent positions sparred over the role of feminism within the Chicano movement.

Chicanas during this time felt excluded from mainstream feminist movements because they had different needs, concerns and demands. Through persistent objections to their exclusions women have gone from being called Chicano women to Chicanas to introducing the adoption of a/o or o/a as a way of acknowledging both genders when discussing the community. Chicanas demanded free day-care centers and a reform of the welfare system, they sought to fight against all three structures of oppression they faced, including sexism, but also prioritizing racism and imperialism.\n\nOne of the First Chicana organizations was the [[Comisi\u00f3n Femenil Mexicana Nacional]] (CFMN), founded in 1973.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yo Soy Chicana: A Chicana Feminist Movement|url=https://www.kcet.org/shows/departures/yo-soy-chicana-a-chicana-feminist-movement|publisher=KCET|accessdate=24 March 2018|language=en|date=7 November 2011}}</ref> The concept for the CFMN originated during the National Chicano Issues Conference when a group of attending Chicanas noticed that their concerns were not adequately addressed at the Chicano conference.

In ''Voicing Chicana Feminisms'', by A\u00edda Hurtado</ref> These archetypes have prevented Chicanas from achieving sexual and bodily agency due to the ways they have been historically constructed as negative categories through the lenses of patriarchy and colonialism.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Indian Women in Early Mexico|last=Schroeder|first=Susan|last2=Wood|first2=Stephanie|last3=Haskett|first3=Robert|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=1997|isbn=9780806129709|location=|pages=292\u2013312|chapter=14}}</ref> Shifting the discourse from a traditional (patriarchal) representation of these archetypes to a de-colonial feminist understanding of them is a crucial element of contemporary Chicana feminism, and represents the starting point for a reclamation of Chicana female power, sexuality, and spirituality.\n\nLa Virgen de Guadalupe and La Malinche have become symbolic means of suppressing Chicana women's sexuality through the patriarchal dichotomy of puta/virgin, the positive role model and the negative one, historically and continuously held up before Mexican women as icons and mirrors in which to examine their own self-image and define their self-esteem.<ref name=\":2\" /> Gloria Anzald\u00faa's canonical text addresses the subversive power of reclaiming indigenous spirituality to unlearn colonial and patriarchal constructions and restrictions on women, their sexuality, and understandings of motherhood. Anzald\u00faa writes, \"I will no longer be made to feel ashamed of existing. I will have my voice: Indian, Spanish, white\".<ref name=\":4\" /> La Malinche is a victim of centuries of patriarchal myths that permeate the Mexican woman's consciousness, often without her awareness.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nMalintzin (also known as Do\u00f1a Marina by the Spaniards or \"La Malinche\" post-Mexican independence from Spain) was born around 1505 to noble indigenous parents in rural Mexico. Since indigenous women were often used as pawns for political alliances at this time, she was betrayed by her parents and sold into slavery between the ages of 12\u201314, traded to Hernan Cort\u00e9s as a concubine, and because of her intelligence and fluency in multiple languages, was promoted to his \"wife\" and diplomat. She served as Cort\u00e9s's translator, playing a key role in the Spaniard's conquest of Tenochtitlan and, by extension, the conquest of Mexico.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mexican history : a primary source reader|publisher=Westview Press|year=2009|editor-last=Jaffary|editor-first=Nora E.|pages=72|chapter=12.

Because of Malintzin's relationship with Cort\u00e9s and her role as translator and informant in Spain's conquest of Mexico, she was seen as a traitor to her race. By contrast, Chicana feminism calls for a different understanding. Since nationalism was a concept unknown to Indigenous people in the 16th century, Malintzin had no sense of herself as \"Indian\", making it impossible for her to show ethnic loyalty or conscientiously act as a traitor. Malintzin was one of millions of women who were traded and sold in Mexico pre-colonization. With no way to escape a group of men, and inevitably rape, Malintzin showed loyalty to Cort\u00e9s to ensure her survival.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nLa Malinche has become the representative of a female sexuality that is passive, \"rape-able\", and always guilty of betrayal.<ref name=\":2\" /> Rather than a traitor or a \"whore\", Chicana feminism calls for an understanding of her as an agent within her limited means, resisting rape and torture (as was common among her peers) by becoming a partner and translator to Cort\u00e9s. Placing the blame for Mexico's conquest on Malintzin creates a foundation for placing upon women the responsibility to be the moral compasses of society and blames them for their sexuality, which is counterintuitive. It is important to understand Malintzin as a victim not of Cort\u00e9s, but of myth. Chicana feminism calls for an understanding in which she should be praised for the adaptive resistance she exhibited that ultimately led to her survival.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nBy challenging patriarchal and colonial representations, Chicana writers re-construct their relationship to the figure of La Malinche and these other powerful archetypes, and reclaim them in order to re-frame a spirituality and identity that is both decolonizing and empowering.<ref>Herrera, Cristina. ''Contemporary Chicana Literature: (Re)Writing the Maternal Script''. Amherst: Cambria Press, 2014.</ref>\n\n== Cultural identities and spirituality ==\nThe term \"Chicano\" originates from Aztec indigenous peoples who pronounced it \"meshicano\" in the native Nahuatl language. However, historically the Spaniards had no \"sh\" in their vocabulary and pronounced it \"mexicano\" (spelled mexicano), a pronunciation that has been carried into the present. Historically, the term Chicano has not always been positive and empowering. The term Chicano was for a long time used in a demeaning manner, and was associated with newly arrived Mexican immigrants in the early twentieth century until it was later reclaimed by Chicana feminists with the emergence of the [[Chicano Movement|Chicano Nationalist Movement]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/postcolonialstudies/2014/06/20/chicana-feminism/|title=Postcolonial Studies {{!}} Chicana Feminism|website=scholarblogs.emory.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-11}}</ref> The term was used to distinguish first-generation, American-born Mexican-Americans from the older generations of Mexican immigrants; two groups that were often separated by a language barrier. Most first-generation American Chicanos adopted English as their first language, with some Chicanos blending both English and Spanish to create a hybrid dialect or slang argot called [[Cal\u00f3 (Chicano)|cal\u00f3]] (also called pachuco). The U.S. media, not being able to fully understand these emerging American identities, stigmatized Chicanos and Mexican in propagating the notion that came from a country of corruption, and that they were criminals, thieves, and immoral people.\n\nThe definitions of Chicana/o in the United States are contested. Because many Chicana/os are born to parents who are immigrants from Mexico, one definition of Chicana/o is rooted in the idea that this identity straddles two different worlds. The first world is that of the country of origin from which their families descended from, such as Mexico, Guatemala, or El Salvador. Many Chicanos today, for example, continue to practice the religion, language, and culture of their respective family's countries of origin. Another definition of Chicano is rooted in the identity being completely embedded within the \"American\" culture. Many Chicana/os have assimilated into \"American\" culture and use English as their primary language. Despite these two distinctions in definition, some might argue that Chicanos are stigmatized by both cultures because they don't fit into either one completely. For this reason, one view of Chicano identity is that a new culture is created in order to resist oppression and navigate both worlds.\n\nContemporary renditions of the word Chicano have been to replace the \u201cCh\u201d beginning with the letter X, making the word Xicano. This is significant because it recenters the Nahua language and pronunciation of the sound \u201cch\u201d, tying the Xicana/o to indigenous roots and decentering Eurocentric ties to identity.  The Ch is the fourth letter of the Spanish alphabet.\n\nChicana feminism has also created another linguistic change, there is another \u201cx\u201d at the end of Xicanx, and it is being used to be inclusive of others gender identities and move away from a colonial imposed binary and gendered language\n.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rodr\u00edguez|first=Richard T|date=October 2017|title=X marks the spot|journal=Cultural Dynamics|volume= 29| issue = 3, 2017|pages=203\u2013212|doi=10.1177/0921374017727880}}</ref> The usage of Xicanx is due to the feminists trying to move back to indigenous roots as well as trying to create more space for Queer folk who have felt marginalized by previous Chicano/a movements.\n\n=== Duality and \"The New Mestiza\" ===\nThe concept of \"The New Mestiza\" comes from feminist author [[Gloria Anzald\u00faa]]. In her book, ''Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza'', she writes: \"In a constant state of mental nepantilism, an Aztec word meaning torn between ways, la mestiza is a product of the transfer of the cultural and spiritual values of one group to another. Being tricultural, monolingual, bilingual or multilingual, speaking a patois, and in a state of perpetual transition, the mestiza faces the dilemma of the mixed breed: which collectivity does the daughter of a dark-skinned mother listen to? [...] Within us and within la Cultura Chicana, commonly held beliefs of the white culture attack commonly held beliefs of the Mexican culture, and both attack commonly held beliefs of the indigenous culture. Subconsciously, we see an attack on ourselves and our beliefs as a treat and we attempt to block with a counterstance.\"<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza|last=Anzald\u00faa|first=Gloria|year=1987|isbn=9781879960749|location=|pages=40|quote=|via=}}</ref> Anzaldua presents a mode of being for Chicanas, that honors their unique standpoint and lived experience. This theory of embodiment offers a mode of being for Chicanas who are constantly negotiating hybridity and cultural collision, and the ways that inform the way they are continuously making new knowledge and understandings of self, often time in relation to intersecting and various forms of oppression. This theory discloses how a counter-stance cannot be a way of life because it depends on hegemonic constructions of domination, in terms of race, nationality, and culture. A counter-stance locks one into a duel of oppressor and oppressed; locked in mortal combat, like the cop and the criminal, both are reduced to a common denominator of violence.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Anzaldua|first1=Gloria|title=Borderlans/La frontera|publisher=Aunt Lute Books|isbn=978-1-879960-12-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/borderlandslafro00anza_0/page/100 100]|year=1987|url=https://archive.org/details/borderlandslafro00anza_0|url-access=registration}}</ref> Being solely reactionary means nothing is being created, revived or renewed in place of the dominant culture and that the dominant culture must remain dominant for counterstance to exist. For Anzaldua and this theory of embodiment, there must be space to create something new. The \u201cnew mestiza\u201d was a canonical text that redefined what it meant to be Chicana. In this theory, being Chicana entails hybridity, contradictions, tolerance for ambiguity and plurality, nothing is rejected or excluded from histories and legacies of oppression. Further, this theory of embodiment calls for synthesizing all aspects of identity and creating new meanings, not simply balancing or coming together of different aspects of identity.\n\n=== Mujerista ===\nMujerista was largely influenced by the African American women's \"Womanist\" approach proposed by Alice Walker. Mujerista was defined by Ada Mar\u00eda Isasi-D\u00edaz in 1996. This Latina feminist identity draws from the main ideas of womanism by combating inequality and oppression through participation in social justice movements within the Latina/o community.<ref name=\"search.proquest.com\">Tijerina-Revilla, A.

The origins of these terms began with Gloria Anzald\u00faa's ''This Bridge We Call Home'' (1987), Ana Castillo's ''Massacre of the Dreamer: Essays in Xicanisma'' (1994), and Gloria Anzald\u00faa and Cherrie Moraga's ''This Bridge Called My Back'' (1984). ''Mujerista'' is a Latina-oriented \u201cwomanist\u201d approach to everyday life and relationships. It emphasizes the need to connect the formal, public life of work and education with the private life of culture and the home by privileging cultural experiences.<ref name=\"search.proquest.com\"/> As such, it differs from ''Feminista'' which focuses on the historic context of the feminist movement. To be ''Mujerista'' is to integrate body, emotion, spirit and community into a single identity.<ref>Galv\u00e1n, R. T. (2006).

Albany: State University of New York Press.</ref> ''Mujerismo'' recognizes how personal experiences are valuable sources of knowledge. The development of all these components form a foundation for collective action in the form of activism.\n\n=== Nepantla spirituality ===\n[[Nepantla]] is a [[Nahuatl|Nahua]] word which translates to \"in the middle of it\" or \"middle\". Nepantla can be described as a concept or spirituality in which multiple realities are experienced at the same time (Duality). As a Chicana, understanding and having indigenous ancestral knowledge of spirituality plays an instrumental role in the path to healing, decolonization, cultural appreciation, self-understanding, and self-love.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Nepantla Spirituality: My Path to the Source(s) of Healing|last = Medina|first = Lara|year = |isbn = |location = |page = 168}}</ref> Nepantla is often associated with author Chicana feminist Gloria Anzald\u00faa, who coined the term, \"Nepantlera\". \"Nepantleras are threshold people; they move within and among multiple, often conflicting, worlds and refuse to align themselves exclusively with any single individual, group, or belief system.\"<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.okcir.com/Articles%20IV%20Special/AnaLouiseKeating-FM.pdf|title = From Borderlands and New Mestizas to Nepantlas and Nepantleras Anzald\u00faan Theories for Social Change|date = 2006|accessdate = |website = |last = Keating|first = AnaLouise}}</ref> Nepantla is a mode of being for the Chicana and informs the way she experiences the world and various systems of oppression.\n\n=== Body politics ===\nIn Encarnacion, author Suzanne Bost discusses Illness and Body Politics in Chicana Feminist Literature, about how body politics has shifted in the way it used to be looked at by Chicana feminism. It has moved beyond just looking at identity politics, it now looks at how \u201c[...]the intersections between particular bodies, cultural contexts, and political needs\u201d.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Encarnacion : Illness and Body Politics in Chicana Feminist Literature|last=Bost|first=Suzanne|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780823230846|location=|pages=193\u2013234}}</ref>  It is now looking beyond just looking at race, but incorporating intersectionality and how mobility, accessibility, mental and physical abilities, caregivers and their roles in lives, work with the body of Chicanas. Examples of Frida Kahlo and her abilities are discussed, as well as Gloria Anzaldua's diabetes, to illustrated how abilities must be discussed when talking about identities. \u201cSince there is no single or constant locus of identification, our analyses must adapt to different cultural frameworks, shifting feelings, and matter that is fluid.[...] our thinking about bodies, identities, and politics must keep moving.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> Chicana feminism needs to move beyond just looking at singular aspects of identities, but using all of them and contextualizing its effects on what is going on in time. Bost uses examples of contemporary Chicana artists and literature to illustrate this: Chicana feminism has not ended; it is just manifesting in different ways now.\n\n=== LGBT interventions ===\nChicana feminist theory evolved as a theory of embodiment and a theory of flesh due to the canonical works of Gloria Anzaldua and Cherrie Moraga, both of whom identify as queer. Queer interventions in Chicana feminist thought called for the inclusion and the honoring of the cultures\u2019 joteria. In La Conciencia de la Mestiza, Gloria Anzaldua wrote, \"the mestizo and the queer exist at this time and point on the evolutionary continuum for a purpose.

Offering a critique of the exclusion of people of color from mainstream gay movements as well as the homophobia rampant in Chicano nationalist movements. Moraga also discusses Aztlan, the metaphysical land and nation that belongs to Chicano ideologies, as well as how the ideas within the communidad need to move forward into making new forms of culture and community in order to survive. \"Feminist critics are committed to the preservation of Chicano culture, but we know that our culture will not survive marital rape, battering, incest, drug and alcohol abuse, AIDS, and the marginalization of lesbian daughters and gay sons\".<ref name=\":6\" /> Moraga brings up criticisms of the Chicano movement and how it has been ignoring the issues within the movement itself, and that need to be addressed in order for the culture to be preserved rightfully.\n\nIn \"Chicana Lesbians: Fear and Loathing in the Chicano Community,\" <ref name=\":5\" /> Carla Trujillo discusses how being a Chicana lesbian is incredibly difficult due to their culture's expectations on family and heterosexuality. Chicana lesbians who do become mothers break this expectation and become liberated from the social norms of their culture.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Maythee|first1=Rojas|title=Women of Color and Feminism|date=2009|publisher=Seal Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=978-1-58005-272-6|page=65}}</ref> Trujillo argues that the very act of the lesbian existence disrupts the established norm of patriarchal oppression. She argues that Chicana lesbians are perceived as a threat because they challenge a male dominated Chicano movement. They raise the consciousness of many Chicana women regarding independence. She goes on to explain that Chicanas, whether they are lesbian or not, are taught to conform to certain modes of behavior regarding their sexuality. Women are \u201ctaught to suppress our sexual desires and needs by conceding all pleasures to the male.\u201d <ref>{{Cite book|title=Chicana Feminist Thought: The Basic Historical Writings.|last=Alma M.|first=Garcia|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, Carla Trujillo edited and compiled, the anthology Chicana Lesbians: The Girls Our Mothers Warned Us About''<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Chicana Lesbians: The Girls Our Mothers Warned Us About|last=Trujillo|first=Carla|publisher=Third Woman Press|year=1991|isbn=9780943219066|location=|pages=186\u2013195}}</ref> (1991) was published by Third Woman Press.

During the Chicano Movement, Chicanas used art to express their political and social resistance. Through different art mediums both past and contemporary, Chicana artists have continued to push the boundaries of traditional Mexican-American values. Chicana art utilizes many different mediums to express their views including murals, painting, photography, etc. to embody feminist themes. Chicana artists worked collaboratively often with not only other women but men as well.\n\nThe momentum created from the Chicano Movement spurred a Chicano Renaissance among Chicanas and Chicanos.

Not many Chicana artists were allowed to participate in the Woman's Building's exhibitions or shows. Chicana artists Olivia Sanchez and Rosalyn Mesquite were among the few included.

Anzald\u00faa also published the [[bilingual]] (Spanish/English) anthology, ''[[Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza]]''. Mariana Roma-Carmona, Alma G\u00f3mez, and Cherr\u00ede Moraga published a collection of stories titled ''Cuentos: Stories by Latinas'', also published by Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press.\n\nThe first Chicana Feminist Journal was published in 1973, called the Encuentro Feminil: The First Chicana Feminist Journal, which was published by Anna Nieto Gomez.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Massacre of the Dreamers : Essays on Xicanisma. 20th Anniversary Updated Edition.|last=Castillo|first=Anna|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|year=2014|isbn=9780826353580|location=|pages=35}}</ref>\n\nJuanita Ramos and the [[Latina Lesbian History Project]] compiled an anthology including [[tatiana de la tierra]]'s first published poem, \"De ambiente\",<ref>De La Tierra, Tatiana. \"Activist Latina Lesbian Publishing: esto no tiene nombre and conmoci\u00f3n.\" ''I am Aztldn: The Personal Essay in Chicano Studies, ed.

However, while it is important to recognize that identity characteristics situate the writer, they do not necessarily reflect their writing. Anzaldua notes that this type of labeling has the potential to marginalize those writers who do not conform to the dominant culture.<ref>Anzaldua, Gloria. (1994).

Following the first confirmed case in the Bailiwick, the CCA enacted the Emergency Powers (Coronavirus) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Regulations 2020 on 17 March, a statutory instrument which enables the Medical Officer of Health to implement emergency measures enforceable by law; the first of which mandated that anyone arriving in the Bailiwick [[Isolation (health care)#Self-isolation|self-isolate]] for 14 days.
