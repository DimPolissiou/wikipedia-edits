{"title_page": "Conrad of Krosigk", "text_new": "'''Conrad of Krosigk''' (c. 1162<ref>{{harvnb|Andrea|1987|p=20}}: he \"probably had not yet seen his fortieth birthday\" in 1201.</ref> \u2013 21 June 1225) was a German prelate, crusader and monk. He served as the [[bishop of Halberstadt]] from 1201 until 1208 and took part in the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1202\u20131204. He resigned his see to become a [[Cistercian]] monk at [[Sittichenbach Abbey]]. In his retirement, he undertook frequent [[Papal]] missions.\n\nBorn to a minor noble family, Conrad rose through the ranks of the diocese of Halberstadt. By 1193 he was chief provost, shouldering major responsibility during Bishop [[Gardolf]]'s absence on the [[Crusade of 1197|Crusade of 1197\u20131198]]. He supported Duke [[Philip of Swabia]] over Count [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto of Poitou]] in the [[German throne dispute|German succession war]] that began in 1198. For this reason, he was excommunicated shortly after his election as bishop and joined the Fourth Crusade. He was with the army at the [[sack of Constantinople]]. Afterwards he fulfilled his vow to go to the [[Holy Land]] and exercised episcopal authority in the [[see of Tyre]] during the archbishop's six-month absence.\n\nUpon his return to Europe after the crusade, Conrad made peace with Otto. He resigned his bishopric and took monastic vows against the orders of Pope [[Innocent III]]. Nonetheless, he received Papal commissions fifteen times in the last fourteen years of his life. In 1209, he commissioned the extension of the ''[[Deeds of the Bishops of Halberstadt]]'' down to the end of his own pontificate, including a important account of the Fourth Crusade based in part on his eyewitness testimony.\n\n==Early life==\n===Family===\n[[File:Burg Krosigk 12.JPG|thumb|Tower from the castle of Krosigk.]]\nConrad was a nobleman, the son of Dedo II of [[Krosigk]] and Adelheid of [[Harbke|Hertbeke]]. Their two families had been intermarrying since the mid-11th century. Conrad had two brothers, Gunzelin and Frederick, and a sister, Bertradis, who became [[abbess of Quedlinburg]]. His paternal uncle, [[Dietrich of Krosigk|Dietrich]], was the bishop of Halberstadt between 1180 and 1193. A maternal relative, [[Gardolf of Hertbeke]], was his immediate predecessor as bishop from 1193 to 1201. Gardolf was a relative of [[Conrad of Querfurt]], [[bishop of Hildesheim]], and so too perhaps was Conrad of Krosigk.{{sfn|Andrea|1987|pp=12\u201314}}\n\n===Canon of Halberstadt===\nThrough the patronage of relatives, Conrad rose rapidly in the church. His earliest appearance in any document dates to 1184, when a ''Cunradus de Crozuch'' is mentioned as a [[Cathedral canon|canon]] of [[Halberstadt Cathedral]]. He may have been a canon since 1180, but no document earlier than 1184 clearly identifies him. He and Garold of Hertbeke were both [[subdeacon]]s in 1184.{{sfn|Andrea|1987|pp=14\u201316}}\n\nBy April 1185, Conrad had been made [[Provost (religion)|provost]] of the church of the Blessed Virgin while retaining his subdiaconate. By April 1186 he had been promoted to full [[deacon]]. He continued as provost of the Blessed Virgin until his election as bishop. From June 1189 at the latest he also held the provostry of Saint Paul's, probably on a temporary basis. In 1191, Bishop Dietrich had to intervene to settle a difference of opinion between Conrad and the canons of Saint Paul's over the election of new canons. Later that year, but before September, Conrad relinquished the post. In 1193, he succeeded Anselm as chief provost of the diocese, i.e. provost of the cathedral.{{sfn|Andrea|1987|pp=14\u201316}}\n\nIn 1193, Gardolf was elected bishop. His election highlights the close relationship between the diocese of Halberstadt, the Krosigk and Hertbeke families and the reigning [[Staufer dynasty]]. Gardolf had previously served as a chaplain to the Emperor [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]] and the emperor attended his ordination and consecration in person. Gardolf joined the [[German Crusade]] being organized by Henry VI and was away on crusade from 1197 to 1198. During his absence, Conrad's duties would have become correspondingly greater.{{sfn|Andrea|1987|p=17}} Gardolf died in August 1201 and Conrad escorted his body back from [[Allstedt-Kaltenborn|Kaltenborn]] for burial in the cathedral.{{sfn|Andrea|1987|p=19}}\n\n==Bishop==\n===Election and excommunication===\nIn 1198, a [[German throne dispute|disputed royal election led to civil war]]. Gardolf and the diocese of Halberstad sided with Henry VI's younger brother, Duke [[Philip of Swabia]]. The pope, however, backed his rival, Count [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto of Poitou]].{{sfn|Andrea|1987|p=18}} In this situation, [[Ludolf of Kroppenstedt]], [[archbishop of Magdeburg]], came to Halberstadt to oversee the election and perhaps to assure the selection of a pro-Philip candidate. Conrad was elected. He was invested with the regalia (the secular jurisdiction associated with the bishopric) by King Philip at [[Halle]], probably before 8 September. He was then ordained a priest by Ludolf and consecrated as bishop on 1 January 1202 by bishops [[Hartwig of Gr\u00f6gling-Dollnstein|Hartwich of Eichst\u00e4tt]], [[Norbert of Brandenburg]] and [[Helmbert of Havelberg]].{{sfn|Andrea|1987|p=19}}\n\nConrad's pontificate was a difficult one. Shortly after his consecration, some of the diocese's vassals, mostly [[knight]]s who favoured Otto's claim over Philips, rebelled. Conrad quashed the rebellion, capturing the castle of [[Schwanebeck]] in the process. He was then ordered to appear before the cardinal-legate [[Guy Par\u00e9]] at [[Cologne]] within seven days, a summons impossible to meet. When he failed to appear, as Guy expected, the cardinal excommunicated him. At about the same time, Conrad appealed Guy's summons to the pope. If his appeal had been launched before his excommunication, the latter would have been invalid, but as it was Pope [[Innocent III]] upheld Guy's actions. His excommunication greatly distressed Conrad, as can be seen in a latter of April or May 1202 confirming some donations to the monastery of [[Sch\u00f6ningen]].{{sfn|Andrea|1987|pp=20\u201321}}\n\n===Fourth Crusade===\nStill excommunicated, Conrad joined the [[Fourth Crusade]] on Palm Sunday, 7 April 1202, publicising his vow in a sermon he gave at his sister's abbey of Quedlinburg.{{sfn|Andrea|1987|p=22}}<ref>{{harvnb|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}}, has 8 April.</ref> Conrad gained two immediate practical benefits from this act: Papal protection of his property and the right of ''[[essoin]]'' (the suspension of judicial proceedings against him). It did not lift his excommunication, but it appears that his status was not widely known within the crusader army. While on crusade, he was treated like the other bishops.{{sfn|Andrea|1987|p=22}}\n\nConrad received a gift of 500 [[Mark (currency)|marks]] from Albert, dean of [[Magdeburg Cathedral]], to help defray the costs of his expedition.{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}} He departed on 1 May and passed through [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], [[Duchy of Austria|Austria]], [[Bishopric of Salzburg|Salzburg]] and [[Patriarchate of Aquileia|Aquileia]] before joining the army at [[Venice]].{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}} He arrived after a deal had been struck between the crusaders and Venice whereby the latter would provide the ships if the former attacked [[Zadar|Zara]], a Christian city held by Venice's rival, [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)|Hungary]].{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}} Disturbed, Conrad sought out the Papal legate, [[Peter of Capua]], but was ordered not to leave the army.{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}}\n\nOn the question of the diversion of the crusade to [[Constantinople]], Conrad was one of those in favour.{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}} He was probably part of the group of western prelates summoned to a meeting with the Greek [[archbishop of Corfu]], whereat the archbishop mocked the notion of [[Papal primacy|Roman primacy]].{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}} According to [[Robert de Cl\u00e9ry]], the bishop of Halberstadt (''li veskes de Havestait'') exhorted the men during the [[Sack of Constantinople|assault of 9 April 1204]].{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}} He was one of the electors who chose [[Baldwin I, Latin Emperor|Baldwin of Flanders]] as emperor on 9 May and with the other bishops took part in his coronation on 16 May.{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}}\n\n===Vicar in Tyre===\nConrad left Constantinople loaded with [[relics]] on 17 August 1204 to complete his vow to [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage in the Holy Land]].{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}} He disembarked in [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] on 7 October and stayed in the Holy Land six months.{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}} During his sojourn he acted as vicar on behalf of the absent archbishop [[Clarembald of Tyre|Clarembald]].{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}} He returned to Halberstadt by way of Venice, where Doge [[Enrico Dandolo]] received him with solemnity, and [[Rome]], where he had an audience with Pope Innocent III.{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}} As he approached Halberstadt, Duke [[Bernhard, Count of Anhalt|Bernard III of Saxony]] and a large crowd came out to greet him.{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}} On 16 August 1205, Conrad deposited the relics he had brought in Halberstadt Cathedral.{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}}\n\nFollowing the death of King Philip in 1208, Conrad pledged fealty to Otto, even giving him 800 marks as a token of submission.{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}} Shortly after, probably between 16 August and 22 September 1208, Conrad resigned the episcopal office.{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}} According to the ''Deeds of the Bishops'', this was to fulfill a secret \"vow which he had for so long borne in his heart, even though it was forbidden him by apostolic authority\".{{sfn|Andrea|1987|p=61}} He retired to the Cistercian [[Sittichenbach Abbey|monastery of Sittichenbach]] (Sichem).{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}}{{sfn|Andrea|1987|pp=60\u201362}}\n\n===Relics and history===\nAfter leaving his see, Conrad commissioned the addition of an account his and Gardolf's reigns to the ''Deeds of the Bishops of Halberstadt''. This he may have done as early as late 1208, but it was not completed until after the election of his successor and his absolution by the pope in early 1209. It was written by a single anonymous author and is an apologia for Conrad's pontificate, especially his actions on crusade. Although not unbiased, it \"largely [tells] a factually correct story.\"{{sfn|Andrea|1987|pp=63\u201365}}\n\nThe ''Deeds'' presents Conrad's relics as having miraculously brought peace to Germany. Conrad declared the date of the deposition of the relics in the cathedral, 16 August, a diocesan [[feast day]]. Any person living in the vicinity of Halberstadt who venerated the relics on that day would receive an [[indulgence]] of forty days those who travelled from further afield sixty days. Conrad gave the church a new altar to support the cult of the relics. When he retired to Sittichenbach, however, he brought the relics with him. These included one or two [[Crown of thorns|holy thorns]], a lock of the [[Virgin Mary]]'s hair, the finger of [[Nicholas of Myra|St Nicholas]] and relics of the apostles [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Bartholomew]], [[Simon the Zealot|Simon]], [[Thomas the Twin|Thomas]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]].{{sfn|Andrea|1987|pp=63\u201365}}\n\n==Monk==\n[[File:SittichenbachKapelle5.JPG|thumb|The abbot's chapel, one of the few remaining building's from Sittichenbach in Conrad's time.]]\nFor defying apostolic authority and retiring to a monastery, Conrad went to Rome to seek the pope's absolution in person. Accompanied by his abbot, he travelled to Rome and back probably between early spring and late summer 1209. The final months of 1208 and 1209 and the first months of 1210 were the only extended periods of solitude Conrad enjoyed as a monk. Between 1211 and 1225, he received fifteen Papal commissions, which required him to regularly leave his monastery and involve himself again in contemporary politics.{{sfn|Andrea|1987|pp=71\u201372}}\n\nHaving resigned his diocese, Conrad remained a bishop in rank and prerogative even while also a monk. Contemporary documents often refer to him as the \"[lord] [brother] bishop [and monk] of Sichem\", or \"in Sichem\". In Papal documents he is referred to as the \"former bishop of Halberstadt\" (''episcopus quondam Halberstadensis''), although he was always addressed by the pope as \"brother\" (as protocol demanded for a bishop) and not as \"son\" (as it would for a monk). When on Papal commission, he was ranked below the diocesan bishops but above the abbots (even his own).{{sfn|Andrea|1987|pp=71\u201372}}\n\nIn the 19th century, Julius Otto Opel identified the \"my dear [old] hermit\" (''m\u00een guoter ''[''alter'']'' kl\u00f4senaere'') who is mentioned in three anti-Papal songs of the poet [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] with the retired Conrad. While the poet and bishop almost certainly knew each other, the context of the songs suggests that, if the unnamed hermit was a historical person, it was someone other than Conrad.{{sfn|Andrea|1987|p=70}}\n\nConrad died on 21 June 1225.{{sfn|Andrea|1987|p=90}} His death opened up disputes between the cathedral and the monastery concerning the bequest of some of Conrad's relics. Cardinal [[Conrad of Urach]] settled the dispute by dividing the relics between the two churches.{{sfn|Andrea|1987|pp=63\u201365}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite journal |ref=harv |first=A.

While on crusade, he was treated like the other bishops.{{sfn|Andrea|1987|p=22}}\n\nConrad received a gift of 500 [[Mark (currency)|marks]] from Albert, dean of [[Magdeburg Cathedral]], to help defray the costs of his expedition.{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}} He departed on 1 May and passed through [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], [[Duchy of Austria|Austria]], [[Bishopric of Salzburg|Salzburg]] and [[Patriarchate of Aquileia|Aquileia]] before joining the army at [[Venice]].{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}} He arrived after a deal had been struck between the crusaders and Venice whereby the latter would provide the ships if the former attacked [[Zadar|Zara]], a Christian city held by Venice's rival, [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)|Hungary]].{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}} Disturbed, Conrad sought out the Papal legate, [[Peter of Capua]], but was ordered not to leave the army.{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}}\n\nOn the question of the diversion of the crusade to [[Constantinople]], Conrad was one of those in favour.{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}} He was probably part of the group of western prelates summoned to a meeting with the Greek [[archbishop of Corfu]], whereat the archbishop mocked the notion of [[Papal primacy|Roman primacy]].{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}} According to [[Robert de Cl\u00e9ry]], the bishop of Halberstadt (''li veskes de Havestait'') exhorted the men during the [[Sack of Constantinople|assault of 9 April 1204]].{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}} He was one of the electors who chose [[Baldwin I, Latin Emperor|Baldwin of Flanders]] as emperor on 9 May and with the other bishops took part in his coronation on 16 May.{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}}\n\n===Vicar in Tyre===\nConrad left Constantinople loaded with [[relics]] on 17 August 1204 to complete his vow to [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage in the Holy Land]].{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}} He disembarked in [[Tyre]] on 7 October and stayed in the Holy Land six months.{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}} During his sojourn he acted as vicar on behalf of the absent archbishop [[Clarembald of Tyre|Clarembald]].{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}} He returned to Halberstadt by way of Venice, where Doge [[Enrico Dandolo]] received him with solemnity, and [[Rome]], where he had an audience with Pope Innocent III.{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}} As he approached Halberstadt, Duke [[Bernhard, Count of Anhalt|Bernard III of Saxony]] and a large crowd came out to greet him.{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}} On 16 August 1205, Conrad deposited the relics he had brought in Halberstadt Cathedral.{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}}\n\nFollowing the death of King Philip in 1208, Conrad pledged fealty to Otto, even giving him 800 marks as a token of submission.{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}} Shortly after, probably between 16 August and 22 September 1208, Conrad resigned the episcopal office.{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}} According to the ''Deeds of the Bishops'', this was to fulfill a secret \"vow which he had for so long borne in his heart, even though it was forbidden him by apostolic authority\".{{sfn|Andrea|1987|p=61}} He retired to the Cistercian [[Sittichenbach Abbey|monastery of Sittichenbach]] (Sichem).{{sfn|Longnon|1978|pp=242\u2013243}}{{sfn|Andrea|1987|pp=60\u201362}}\n\n===Relics and history===\nAfter leaving his see, Conrad commissioned the addition of an account his and Gardolf's reigns to the ''Deeds of the Bishops of Halberstadt''. This he may have done as early as late 1208, but it was not completed until after the election of his successor and his absolution by the pope in early 1209. It was written by a single anonymous author and is an apologia for Conrad's pontificate, especially his actions on crusade. Although not unbiased, it \"largely [tells] a factually correct story.\"{{sfn|Andrea|1987|pp=63\u201365}}\n\nThe ''Deeds'' presents Conrad's relics as having miraculously brought peace to Germany. Conrad declared the date of the deposition of the relics in the cathedral, 16 August, a diocesan [[feast day]]. Any person living in the vicinity of Halberstadt who venerated the relics on that day would receive an [[indulgence]] of forty days those who travelled from further afield sixty days. Conrad gave the church a new altar to support the cult of the relics. When he retired to Sittichenbach, however, he brought the relics with him. These included one or two [[Crown of thorns|holy thorns]], a lock of the [[Virgin Mary]]'s hair, the finger of [[Nicholas of Myra|St Nicholas]] and relics of the apostles [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Bartholomew]], [[Simon the Zealot|Simon]], [[Thomas the Twin|Thomas]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]].{{sfn|Andrea|1987|pp=63\u201365}}\n\n==Monk==\n[[File:SittichenbachKapelle5.JPG|thumb|The abbot's chapel, one of the few remaining building's from Sittichenbach in Conrad's time.]]\nFor defying apostolic authority and retiring to a monastery, Conrad went to Rome to seek the pope's absolution in person. Accompanied by his abbot, he travelled to Rome and back probably between early spring and late summer 1209. The final months of 1208 and 1209 and the first months of 1210 were the only extended periods of solitude Conrad enjoyed as a monk. Between 1211 and 1225, he received fifteen Papal commissions, which required him to regularly leave his monastery and involve himself again in contemporary politics.{{sfn|Andrea|1987|pp=71\u201372}}\n\nHaving resigned his diocese, Conrad remained a bishop in rank and prerogative even while also a monk. Contemporary documents often refer to him as the \"[lord] [brother] bishop [and monk] of Sichem\", or \"in Sichem\". In Papal documents he is referred to as the \"former bishop of Halberstadt\" (''episcopus quondam Halberstadensis''), although he was always addressed by the pope as \"brother\" (as protocol demanded for a bishop) and not as \"son\" (as it would for a monk). When on Papal commission, he was ranked below the diocesan bishops but above the abbots (even his own).{{sfn|Andrea|1987|pp=71\u201372}}\n\nIn the 19th century, Julius Otto Opel identified the \"my dear [old] hermit\" (''m\u00een guoter ''[''alter'']'' kl\u00f4senaere'') who is mentioned in three anti-Papal songs of the poet [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] with the retired Conrad. While the poet and bishop almost certainly knew each other, the context of the songs suggests that, if the unnamed hermit was a historical person, it was someone other than Conrad.{{sfn|Andrea|1987|p=70}}\n\nConrad died on 21 June 1225.{{sfn|Andrea|1987|p=90}} His death opened up disputes between the cathedral and the monastery concerning the bequest of some of Conrad's relics. Cardinal [[Conrad of Urach]] settled the dispute by dividing the relics between the two churches.{{sfn|Andrea|1987|pp=63\u201365}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite journal |ref=harv |first=A.

{"title_page": "Max Skladanowsky", "text_new": "[[File:Skladanowsky brothers.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Max and Emil Skladanowsky in front of a projection screen]]\n'''Max Skladanowsky''' (30 April 1863 \u2013 30 November 1939) was a [[German people|German]] [[inventor]] and early [[filmmaker]]. Along with his brother Emil, he invented the [[Bioscop]], an early [[movie projector]] the Skladanowsky brothers used to display the first moving picture show to a paying audience on 1 November 1895, shortly before the public debut of the [[Lumi\u00e8re Brothers]]' [[Cin\u00e9matographe]] in Paris on 28 December 1895.\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Bioscop.jpg|thumb|left|1895 poster for [[Bioscop]] screenings]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R96755, Max und Eugen Skladanowsky.jpg|thumb|Max Skladanowsky (right) in 1934 with his brother Eugen and the Bioscop]]\nBorn as the fourth child of [[glazier]] Carl Theodor Skladanowsky (1830\u20131897) und Luise Auguste Ernestine Skladanowsky, Max Skladanowsky was apprenticed as a [[photographer]] and glass painter, which led to an interest in [[magic lantern]]s. In 1879, he began to tour Germany and Central Europe with his father Carl and elder brother Emil, giving [[dissolving views|dissolving]] magic lantern shows. While Emil mostly took care of promotion, Max was mostly involved with the technology and for instance developed special multi-lens devices that allowed simultaneous projection of up to nine separate image sequences. Carl retired from this show business, but Max and Emil continued and added other attractions,<ref name=Barber>{{Cite web|url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2010/feature-articles/the-skladanowsky-brothers-the-devil-knows/|title=The Skladanowsky Brothers: The Devil Knows|last=Barber|first=Stephen|date=2010-10-11|website=Senses of Cinema|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> including a type of [[naumachia]] that involved electro-mechanical effects and pyrotechnics. \n\nMax would later claim to have constructed their first film camera on 20 August 1892, but this more likely happened in the summer or autumn of 1894. He also single-handedly constructed the Bioskop projector. Partially based on the dissolving view lantern, it featured two lenses and two separate film reels, one frame being projected alternately from each. It was hand-cranked to transport 44.5mm-wide unperforated Eastman-Kodak film-stock, which was carefully cut, perforated and re-assembled by hand and coated with an emulsion developed by Max. The projector was placed behind a screen, which was made properly transparent by keeping it wet to show the images optimally.<ref name=Barber/>\n\nThe Skladanosky brothers shot several films in May 1895. Their first film recorded Emil performing overstated movements on a rooftop with a panorama of Berlin in the background. This was an experimental test, not to be used in their commercial screenings. Their further choice of subjects seemed influenced by the films they probably viewed in the [[Kinetoscope]] that was installed in Berlin in March. They filmed various variety acts who where performing in town and had them perform in the gardens of theatres in full sunlight,<ref name=Barber/> against a neutral background (usually white, sometimes black).\n\nTest screenings were held at the Gasthaus Sello in July 1895, attended by some invited friends and colleagues. The directors of the [[Berlin Wintergarten theatre|Wintergarten]] [[music hall]] were impressed enough after seeing a screening of the Bioskop to eventually sign the Skladanowsky brothers in September for the substantial fee of 2500 [[German gold mark|Goldmark]]. The Skladanowsky brothers would first stage a [[naumachia]] show at the Wintergarten, re-enacting an [[Alexandria]]n sea battle, in October and from 1 November 1895 until the end of the month they would provide a motion picture show, which was eventually screened 23 times. Their circa 15-minutes picture show was part of an evening program that lasted over three hours, which further included all kinds of variety acts, such as Mr. Thompson and his three trained elephants. In an advertisement for the program, the Bioskop appeared right at the center in an extra bold typeface with the statement \"New! The most interesting invention of the modern age\".<ref>https://www.bild.bundesarchiv.de/dba/de/search/?yearfrom=&yearto=&query=skladanowsky&page=11</ref> The Skladanowskys showed eight films, varying in length from 99 to 174 frames (circa 6 to 11 seconds if played at 16 fps), looped repeatedly, while a specially composed score was played especially loud to drown out the noise of the machinery. The \"Apotheose\" film showed the brothers entering the frame from opposite sites in front of a white background, bowing towards the camera as if receiving applause and walking out of the frame again. When their show was finished they replicated the action in person in front of the projection screen. The popular venue was filled to capacity with circa 1500 rich patrons for each evening program, but not all of them watched the films. Reviews favoured the three elephants, but the Bioskop was reportedly well-received with extensive applause and flowers thrown at the screen. However, the Berlin papers were seldom critical about shows due to the revenue of the theatre advertisements they placed.<ref name=Barber/>\n\nAfter finishing the Wintergarten run of shows, the Bioskop opened in the [[Hamburg]] Concerthaus on 21 December 1895 as a single program, without any other acts. On the 27th they traveled to Paris, engaged to play the [[Folies Berg\u00e8re]] from 1 January 1896. Coincidentally, the Lumi\u00e8re brothers happened to present their [[Cinematograph]] in their first commercial public screening on the 28th in Paris. One of the Berg\u00e8re proprietors took them to the second presentation, on the 29th, and then cancelled the booking of the Bioskop, nonetheless paying them in full. This possibly had something to do with patent rights, but the Cinematograph was clearly superior in image quality and much more easily operated than the Bioskop, and the Skladanowsky brothers may as well have preferred not to compete. A planned appearance at the London Empire Theatre was also cancelled, but they were able to further tour [[Kothen]], [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Magdeburg]] in central Germany in March 1896; Kristiana (now [[Oslo]]), Norway from 6 April to 5 May; [[Groningen]] from 14 to 24 May and Amsterdam from 21 May, the Netherlands; [[Copenhagen]], Denmark from 11 June to 30 July; and [[Stockholm]], Sweden from 3 August until September 1896.<ref name=victorian>{{Cite web|url=https://www.victorian-cinema.net/skladanowsky|title=Who's Who of Victorian Cinema|website=www.victorian-cinema.net|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref><ref name=Barber/>\n\n[[File:Komische Begegnungen im Tiergarten zu Stockholm.webm|thumb|Komische Begegnungen im Tiergarten zu Stockholm]]\nMax had constructed a new camera with a [[Geneva drive]] in the autumn of 1895,<ref name=victorian/> and the new single-lens Bioskop-II projector in the summer of 1896.<ref name=Barber/>\nThey also recorded new films (on 63mm-wide celluloid), much needed since the old ones started to get damaged, including the fiction film ''Komische Begegnung im Tiergarten zu Stockholm'' (Comical Encounter in [[Djurg\u00e5rden]], Stockholm) in August 1896 with professional actors from the Victoria Theatre company.<ref name=victorian/> It was the first film recorded in Sweden.<ref>{{Citation|title=Komische Begegnung im Tiergarten zu Stockholm (1896) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405082/trivia|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> They returned to Berlin in February 1897, and shot several crowded urban street scenes. The new films were thought to meet the taste of new audiences and were much needed since the older films started to wear out. However, the investments proved to be in vain as a proposed return to the Wintergarten was not approved, their trade license was not renewed as the authorities believed there were already too many film exhibitors active in town, and they managed to find one venue for a second tour. Eventually, the last Bioskop show by the Skladanosky brothers took place in [[Stettin]] on 30 March 1897.<ref name=Barber/>\n\nAfter this Skladanowsky returned to his former photographic activities including the production of [[flip book]]s and further magic lantern shows. He also sold amateur film cameras and projectors and produced 3-D [[anaglyph image]] slides. His company ''Projektion f\u00fcr Alle'' also produced a number of films in the early 20th century, some directed by Eugen, his younger brother, but with little success. In his later years Skladanowsky was accused in the press of exaggerating his role in the early days of cinema, most notably by the pioneering cameraman [[Guido Seeber]].\n\n==Legacy==\nBetween the years 1895 and 1905, the brothers directed at least 25 to 30 short movies.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0804434 IMDB entry]</ref> In 1995, the German filmmaker [[Wim Wenders]] directed a drama documentary film ''[[A Trick of Light|Die Gebr\u00fcder Skladanowsky]]'' in collaboration with students of the [[Munich Academy for Television and Film]] in which Max Skladanowsky was played by [[Udo Kier]].<ref>{{IMDb title|0113151|Gebr\u00fcder Skladanowsky, Die (1995)}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Komisches Reck.webm\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = ''Komisches Reck'' (1895)\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Jongleur.webm\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = ''Jongleur'' (1895)\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3    = Kamarinskaja.webm\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  = ''Kamarinskaja'' (1895)\n<!-- Image 4 -->\n| image4    = Ringk\u00e4mpfer.webm\n| alt4      =\n| caption4  = ''Ringk\u00e4mpfer'' (1895)\n}}\n* 1895 : ''[[Bauerntanz zweier Kinder]]''\n* 1895 : ''[[Komisches Reck]]''\n* 1895 : ''[[Die Serpentint\u00e4nzerin]]''\n* 1895 : ''[[Jongleur (1895 film)|Jongleur]]''\n* 1895 : ''[[Boxing Kangaroo (film)|Das Boxende K\u00e4nguruh]]''\n* 1895 : ''[[Akrobatisches Potpourri]]''\n* 1895 : ''[[Kamarinskaja]]''\n* 1895 : ''[[Ringk\u00e4mpfer]]''\n* 1895 : ''[[Apotheose]]''\n* 1896 : ''[[Unter den Linden (1896 film)|Unter den Linden]]''\n* 1896 : ''[[Nicht mehr allein]]''\n* 1896 : ''[[Mit Abl\u00f6sung der Wache]]''\n* 1896 : ''[[Lustige Gesellschaft vor dem Tivoli in Kopenhagen]]''\n* 1896 : ''[[Leben und Treiben am Alexanderplatz]]''\n* 1896 : ''[[Komische Begenung im Tiergarten zu Stockholm]]''\n* 1896 : ''[[Ausfahrt nach dem Alarm]]''\n* 1896 : ''[[Ankunft eines Eisenbahnzuges]]''\n* 1896 : ''[[Alarm der Feuerwehr]]''\n* 1896 : ''[[Die Wachtparade]]''\n* 1897 : ''[[Am Bollwerk in Stettin]]''\n* 1897 : ''[[Apotheose II]]''\n* 1897 : ''[[Am Bollwerk]]''\n* 1900 : ''[[Eine Moderne Jungfrau von Orleans]]''\n* 1905 : ''[[Eine Fliegenjagd oder Die Rache der Frau Schultze]]''\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of film formats]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{Victorian Cinema|skladanowsky.htm}}\n*Castan, Joachim.

Along with his brother Emil, he invented the [[Bioscop]], an early [[movie projector]] the Skladanowsky brothers used to display the first moving picture show to a paying audience on 1 November 1895, shortly before the public debut of the [[Lumi\u00e8re Brothers]]' [[Cin\u00e9matographe]] in Paris on 28 December 1895.\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Bioscop.jpg|thumb|left|1895 poster for [[Bioscop]] screenings]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R96755, Max und Eugen Skladanowsky.jpg|thumb|Max Skladanowsky (right) in 1934 with his brother Eugen and the Bioscop]]\nBorn as the fourth child of [[glazier]] Carl Theodor Skladanowsky (1830\u20131897) und Luise Auguste Ernestine Skladanowsky, Max Skladanowsky was apprenticed as a [[photographer]] and glass painter, which led to an interest in [[magic lantern]]s. In 1879, he began to tour Germany and Central Europe with his father Carl and elder brother Emil, giving [[dissolving views|dissolving]] magic lantern shows. While Emil mostly took care of promotion, Max was mostly involved with the technology and for instance developed special multi-lens devices that allowed simultaneous projection of up to nine separate image sequences. Carl retired from this show business, but Max and Emil continued and added other attractions,<ref name=Barber>{{Cite web|url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2010/feature-articles/the-skladanowsky-brothers-the-devil-knows/|title=The Skladanowsky Brothers: The Devil Knows|last=Barber|first=Stephen|date=2010-10-11|website=Senses of Cinema|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> including a type of [[naumachia]] that involved electro-mechanical effects and pyrotechnics. \n\nMax would later claim to have constructed their first film camera on 20 August 1892, but this more likely happened in the summer or autumn of 1894. He also single-handedly constructed the Bioskop projector. Partially based on the dissolving view lantern, it featured two lenses and two separate film reels, one frame being projected alternately from each. It was hand-cranked to transport 44.5mm-wide unperforated Eastman-Kodak film-stock, which was carefully cut, perforated and re-assembled by hand and coated with an emulsion developed by Max. The projector was placed behind a screen, which was made properly transparent by keeping it wet to show the images optimally.<ref name=Barber/>\n\nThe Skladanosky brothers shot several films in May 1895. Their first film recorded Emil performing overstated movements on a rooftop with a panorama of Berlin in the background. This was an experimental test, not to be used in their commercial screenings. Their further choice of subjects seemed influenced by the films they probably viewed in the [[Kinetoscope]] that was installed in Berlin in March. They filmed various variety acts who where performing in town and had them perform in the gardens of theatres in full sunlight,<ref name=Barber/> against a neutral background (usually white, sometimes black).\n\nTest screenings were held at the Gasthaus Sello in July 1895, attended by some invited friends and colleagues. The directors of the [[Berlin Wintergarten theatre|Wintergarten]] [[music hall]] were impressed enough after seeing a screening of the Bioskop to eventually sign the Skladanowsky brothers in September for the substantial fee of 2500 [[German gold mark|Goldmark]]. The Skladanowsky brothers would first stage a [[naumachia]] show at the Wintergarten, re-enacting an [[Alexandria]]n sea battle, in October and from 1 November 1895 until the end of the month they would provide a motion picture show, which was eventually screened 23 times. Their circa 15-minutes picture show was part of an evening program that lasted over three hours, which further included all kinds of variety acts, such as Mr. Thompson and his three trained elephants. In an advertisement for the program, the Bioskop appeared right at the center in an extra bold typeface with the statement \"New! The most interesting invention of the modern age\".<ref>https://www.bild.bundesarchiv.de/dba/de/search/?yearfrom=&yearto=&query=skladanowsky&page=11</ref> The Skladanowskys showed eight films, varying in length from 99 to 174 frames (circa 6 to 11 seconds if played at 16 fps), looped repeatedly, while a specially composed score was played especially loud to drown out the noise of the machinery. The \"Apotheose\" film showed the brothers entering the frame from opposite sites in front of a white background, bowing towards the camera as if receiving applause and walking out of the frame again. When their show was finished they replicated the action in person in front of the projection screen. The popular venue was filled to capacity with circa 1500 rich patrons for each evening program, but not all of them watched the films. Reviews favoured the three elephants, but the Bioskop was reportedly well-received with extensive applause and flowers thrown at the screen. However, the Berlin papers were seldom critical about shows due to the revenue of the theatre advertisements they placed.<ref name=Barber/>\n\nAfter finishing the Wintergarten run of shows, the Bioskop opened in the [[Hamburg]] Concerthaus on 21 December 1895 as a single program, without any other acts. On the 27th they traveled to Paris, engaged to play the [[Folies Berg\u00e8re]] from 1 January 1896. Coincidentally, the Lumi\u00e8re brothers happened to present their [[Cinematograph]] in their first commercial public screening on the 28th in Paris. One of the Berg\u00e8re proprietors took them to the second presentation, on the 29th, and then cancelled the booking of the Bioskop, nonetheless paying them in full. This possibly had something to do with patent rights, but the Cinematograph was clearly superior in image quality and much more easily operated than the Bioskop, and the Skladanowsky brothers may as well have preferred not to compete. A planned appearance at the London Empire Theatre was also cancelled, but they were able to further tour [[Kothen]], [[Halle]] and [[Magdeburg]] in central Germany in March 1896; Kristiana (now [[Oslo]]), Norway from 6 April to 5 May; [[Groningen]] from 14 to 24 May and Amsterdam from 21 May, the Netherlands; [[Copenhagen]], Denmark from 11 June to 30 July; and [[Stockholm]], Sweden from 3 August until September 1896.<ref name=victorian>{{Cite web|url=https://www.victorian-cinema.net/skladanowsky|title=Who's Who of Victorian Cinema|website=www.victorian-cinema.net|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref><ref name=Barber/>\n\n[[File:Komische Begegnungen im Tiergarten zu Stockholm.webm|thumb|Komische Begegnungen im Tiergarten zu Stockholm]]\nMax had constructed a new camera with a [[Geneva drive]] in the autumn of 1895,<ref name=victorian/> and the new single-lens Bioskop-II projector in the summer of 1896.<ref name=Barber/>\nThey also recorded new films (on 63mm-wide celluloid), much needed since the old ones started to get damaged, including the fiction film ''Komische Begegnung im Tiergarten zu Stockholm'' (Comical Encounter in [[Djurg\u00e5rden]], Stockholm) in August 1896 with professional actors from the Victoria Theatre company.<ref name=victorian/> It was the first film recorded in Sweden.<ref>{{Citation|title=Komische Begegnung im Tiergarten zu Stockholm (1896) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405082/trivia|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> They returned to Berlin in February 1897, and shot several crowded urban street scenes. The new films were thought to meet the taste of new audiences and were much needed since the older films started to wear out. However, the investments proved to be in vain as a proposed return to the Wintergarten was not approved, their trade license was not renewed as the authorities believed there were already too many film exhibitors active in town, and they managed to find one venue for a second tour. Eventually, the last Bioskop show by the Skladanosky brothers took place in [[Stettin]] on 30 March 1897.<ref name=Barber/>\n\nAfter this Skladanowsky returned to his former photographic activities including the production of [[flip book]]s and further magic lantern shows. He also sold amateur film cameras and projectors and produced 3-D [[anaglyph image]] slides. His company ''Projektion f\u00fcr Alle'' also produced a number of films in the early 20th century, some directed by Eugen, his younger brother, but with little success. In his later years Skladanowsky was accused in the press of exaggerating his role in the early days of cinema, most notably by the pioneering cameraman [[Guido Seeber]].\n\n==Legacy==\nBetween the years 1895 and 1905, the brothers directed at least 25 to 30 short movies.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0804434 IMDB entry]</ref> In 1995, the German filmmaker [[Wim Wenders]] directed a drama documentary film ''[[A Trick of Light|Die Gebr\u00fcder Skladanowsky]]'' in collaboration with students of the [[Munich Academy for Television and Film]] in which Max Skladanowsky was played by [[Udo Kier]].<ref>{{IMDb title|0113151|Gebr\u00fcder Skladanowsky, Die (1995)}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Komisches Reck.webm\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = ''Komisches Reck'' (1895)\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Jongleur.webm\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = ''Jongleur'' (1895)\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3    = Kamarinskaja.webm\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  = ''Kamarinskaja'' (1895)\n<!-- Image 4 -->\n| image4    = Ringk\u00e4mpfer.webm\n| alt4      =\n| caption4  = ''Ringk\u00e4mpfer'' (1895)\n}}\n* 1895 : ''[[Bauerntanz zweier Kinder]]''\n* 1895 : ''[[Komisches Reck]]''\n* 1895 : ''[[Die Serpentint\u00e4nzerin]]''\n* 1895 : ''[[Jongleur (1895 film)|Jongleur]]''\n* 1895 : ''[[Boxing Kangaroo (film)|Das Boxende K\u00e4nguruh]]''\n* 1895 : ''[[Akrobatisches Potpourri]]''\n* 1895 : ''[[Kamarinskaja]]''\n* 1895 : ''[[Ringk\u00e4mpfer]]''\n* 1895 : ''[[Apotheose]]''\n* 1896 : ''[[Unter den Linden (1896 film)|Unter den Linden]]''\n* 1896 : ''[[Nicht mehr allein]]''\n* 1896 : ''[[Mit Abl\u00f6sung der Wache]]''\n* 1896 : ''[[Lustige Gesellschaft vor dem Tivoli in Kopenhagen]]''\n* 1896 : ''[[Leben und Treiben am Alexanderplatz]]''\n* 1896 : ''[[Komische Begenung im Tiergarten zu Stockholm]]''\n* 1896 : ''[[Ausfahrt nach dem Alarm]]''\n* 1896 : ''[[Ankunft eines Eisenbahnzuges]]''\n* 1896 : ''[[Alarm der Feuerwehr]]''\n* 1896 : ''[[Die Wachtparade]]''\n* 1897 : ''[[Am Bollwerk in Stettin]]''\n* 1897 : ''[[Apotheose II]]''\n* 1897 : ''[[Am Bollwerk]]''\n* 1900 : ''[[Eine Moderne Jungfrau von Orleans]]''\n* 1905 : ''[[Eine Fliegenjagd oder Die Rache der Frau Schultze]]''\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of film formats]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{Victorian Cinema|skladanowsky.htm}}\n*Castan, Joachim.

The chapel was designed in 1914, with the building completed in 1916 and was fully furnished by 1917. The church's architecture and interior fittings are representative of the [[Celtic revival]] movement which sought to echo the [[Insular art|aesthetic style]] that flourished in Ireland and Britain between the 7th and 12th centuries.{{sfn|Sheehy|1980|pp=163, 164}}\n\nIt's construction was initiated and closely supervised by [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]], a leading member of the Celtic revival and [[Arts and Crafts]] movements. He was funded by Isabella Honan (1861-1913), the last member of a wealthy Cork family, who provided large donations towards the build of the chapel. O'Connell oversaw both the architecture design and the commissioning of its exterior carvings and statuettes, its floor, furniture and liturgical collection. He closely instructed the work of the architect James F. McMullen, the builders [[Sisk Group|John Sisk and Sons]], and hired the craftsmen and artists involved in the construction, many of whom incorporated elements of the [[Art Nouveau]] style into the design of the chapel.\n\nThe Honan is internationally known{{sfn|Teehan|2016|p=80}} for its interior which is designed and fitted in a traditionally Irish style, but with an appreciation of current trends in international art.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=3}} Its furnishings include the mosaic flooring, altar plates, metal work and enamels, liturgical textiles and sanctuary furnishings, and especially its nineteen [[stained glass]] windows. Eleven were designed and installed by [[Harry Clarke]], a major Irish artist who completed the works aged twenty seven. His windows were described by the art historian Nicola Gordon Bowe as \"arguably his greatest work in stained glass\".{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} A further eight were designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E. Child]], [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine O'Brien]] and [[Ethel Rhind]] of \"[[An T\u00far Gloine]]\" (''The Glass Tower'') cooperative studio, founded by [[Sarah Purser]] in 1903.\n\n==Commission==\nPopulation growth and migration in the early 20th century led to the development of a number of suburbs around [[Cork (city)|Cork city]]. This necessitated the building of churches to serve the people living in the new urban areas, and the Honan was the first church built in Cork in the new century. The reasons for its development were very different to those for other contemporary churches, resulting from a longstanding educational disagreement between the [[Protestant]] and Catholic hierarchies. Queens College Cork (today known as [[University College Cork]] (UCC)), was incorporated in 1845 as part of a series of new universities known as the Queen's Colleges,{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} under a charter that excluded Catholic students.{{sfn|Baker|1999|p=165}}\n\n[[File:Honan Hostel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|The Honan Hostel]]\nThis ended in 1911 when the Queen's Colleges folded as legal entities, and as a result students of both denominations were allowed to attend. The Irish Universities Act of 1908 stipulated that government funding could not be allocated towards \"any church, chapel, or other place of religious worship or observance\".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1908/act/38/enacted/en/print.html | title = Irish Universities Act, 1908 | publisher = Government of Ireland | website = irishstatutebook.ie | accessdate = 1 September 2019}}</ref> The 1908 legislation meant that any centre for Catholic students in an Irish university could only be attained through private funding.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} Such terms were seen by some as restrictive on Catholic students, including by Sir [[Bertram Windle]],{{sfn|Leland|2004}} the university's president, and [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]] (1868-1943), who described the act as \"absurd and scandalous\".{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=613}}<ref name=\"wg\" />\n\n===Isabella Honan===\nIsabella Honan (n\u00e9e Cunningham, 1861-1913) was the sister-in-law of Robert Honan, the last male heir of a wealthy Catholic family who had made their money in the 19th century as butter merchants.{{sfn|O'Connell|1916|p=11}}{{sfn|Ryan|2016|p=3}} Robert and his brother Matthew were dead by 1909{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}, with Robert having left his fortune to Isabella, who  died in August 1913.

The original altar consists of a plain slab of Irish [[limestone]], which O'Connell selected to contrast with the ornately carved Italian [[marble]] then in fashion, and which he disliked.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=21}} It was positioned  on a five legged table, each of which was lined with an [[Celtic cross|Irish crucifix]]{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294-295}} formed from simple geometric designs.

The nave is lined with six at either side, mostly by Clarke, three in the west gable, and four in the chancel.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} O'Connell deliberately placed Harry Clarke and [[Sarah Purser]]'s [[An T\u00far Gloine]] studio in competition for the window's commission.{{sfn|Kennedy|2015|p=99}} After he was sent Clarke's initial designs for the St. Gobnait window, O'Connell immediately a total of eleven windows, out of a planned nineteen.{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1979|p=99}} Clarke's windows were praised by several commentators when first shown in Dublin, with collector Thomas Bodkin writing that \"nothing like Mr Clark's windows had been seen before in Ireland\" and noting the \"sustained magnificence of colour...intricate drawing...[and] lavish and mysterious [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]].\"{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=163}}\n\nThe Clarke and T\u00far Gloine's windows contain similar subject matter and imagery, but vastly differ in style.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} Clarke's are highly detailed, while An T\u00far Gloine's are deliberately simple. Both studios were asked to depict Gaelic saints from the \"golden age\" of [[Christianity in Ireland]].{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=28}} Each displayed their [[Modello|cartoons]] in Dublin before they were physically realised in Cork. Both shows were highly praised, and lead to some debate among art critics as to which sets were superior. In 1955, the Irish [[Michael J. O'Kelly]] summarised that each of the Honan windows are high quality and worthy of individual consideration. While his notes especially single out the windows designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E. Child]], O'Kelly believes that preferences come down to matters of personal taste.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294-295}}\n\nThe windows in the chancel are: Our Lord (or \"Christ [[Christ in Majesty|in Majesty]]\") (Child), Our Lady [[Our Lady of Sorrows|of Sorrows]] (Clarke), St. John (O'Brien) and St. Joseph (Clarke).{{sfn|HayesRogers|2012|pp=128, 130}} To the right of the chancel looking down are: St. Finnbarr (Clarke), St. Albert (Clarke), St. Declan (Clarke), St. Ailbe (Child), St. Fauchtna (Child) and St. Munchin (O'Brien).

The designs are deeply and richly coloured, employing a deep, thick and rich [[royal blue]] throughout. They contain simplified, often whimsical forms which are nevertheless highly stylised and evoke, in the words of the writer M. J. O'Kelly, \"the spirit of the [[Ancient Celtic religion|ancient Celt]]\".{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=295}} The panels blends Catholic [[iconography]] with motifs and events from Celtic mythology{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=19}} in a style that draws heavily from [[Art Nouveau]], in particular the darker, ''[[fin de si\u00e8cle]]'' works of [[Aubrey Beardsley]], [[Gustav Klimt]] and [[Egon Schiele]].{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}}\n\nThe panels contain a multitude of Celtic designs and motifs, and are filled with figures and incidents from the life of each saint. The most obvious Celtic embellishments are [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary's]] red hair and green [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], and Brendan's [[pampooties]].{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}} The light of St. [[Albert of Cashel]], who wears a purple [[chasuble]], crimson [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] and a bishop's [[mitre]], contains several Celtic motifs, including the bronze spirals placed around his hair and beard.{{sfn|Costigan|Cullen|2019|p=57}} His depictions often detail magical feats associated with the saint, which Gibbon describes as \"daring\" inclusions, given such deeds owe more to [[Paganism|pagan]] legend rather than \"respectable traits of virtue and holiness.\"{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}}\n\nSome of the windows came close to being destroyed during the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] in Dublin.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=19}} Before the windows were installed in Cork, the cartoons were displayed at his Dublin studio, where they were praised by contemporary art critics.{{efn-ua|Clarke's career in stained glass peaked early; from the mid 1920 he was preoccupied with legacy commissions left over from his father's workshop.

Sarah Purser and Edward Martyn formed and financed the T\u00far Gloine workshop in 1903,{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} which was commercially successful and often competing against Clarke for commissions.{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=311}} She recruited A. E. Child, a teacher at the [[National College of Art and Design|Metropolitan School of Art]] in Dublin, who managed the workshop often employing pupils of his.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=99, 167}} The eight windows are attributed to Child (St. Ailbe, St. Fachtna and St. Coleman), and his former pupils [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine (Kitty) O'Brien]]  (St. John, St. Flannan and St. Munchin) and [[Ethel Rhind]] (St. Carthagh).{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=295}}\n\nAlthough their designs are similar to Clark's in subject matter, they are very different in style. The windows are minimalist in line and colour, consisting of a dominating but simplicity rendered and naturalistic central figure rendered in pale hues,{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} surrounded by uncomplicated, largely empty opaque sub-panels. The most prominently placed window is Child's \"Our Lord\", positioned above the altar, on the east gable.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} Child depicts the risen Christ in simple forms and subdued colours appropriate to his strong but dignified facial expression.

Sometimes mistakenly attributed to Child, it is very different to Child's \"Our Lord\" window, which is reminiscent of a more traditional style of stained glass design. Although O'Brien has not received the same level of study as other members of the An T\u00far Gloine studio, both Virginia Teehan and Nicola Gordon Bowe have commented on her \"beguiling narrative details\" and \"successful harmonisation of colour with The Clarke windows in the chapel\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=131}}\n\nThe window is divided into three [[Register (art)|registers]], with three pairs of medallions below each panel. The imagery is mostly based on scenes from the life of Christ, based on the [[Gospel of John]], and draws more from close readings of scripture than traditions of iconography. The upper register is based on [[Revelation 1|Revelations 1:1]], and shows a vision of the glorified Christ in Majesty, with the Alpha and Omega symbols and the seven candles. John, who throughout the panels is depicted as beardless young man, is shown at the side with his head bowed. The two medallions below this are based on the Gospel of John, and show, on the left, [[St. Peter]] and John running towards Jesus' tomb (with John outpacing Peter), and on the right, Jesus walking with Peter, with St John following behind.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=130}}\n\nThe crucifixion scene in the central register is more richly coloured that the other panels, and per tradition shows Mary and St. John at the foot of the cross. Less usual, and more usual of Protestant than Catholic iconography,{{efn-ua|O'Brien, who joined An T\u00far Gloine in 1904, came from an [[Anglo-Irish]], and devout [[Church of Ireland]] family.

The serpent probably refers to [[Seed of the woman|Genesis 3:15]], which reads: \"And I will put enmity between thee (the serpent) and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\"{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The medallions below the crucifixion reflect two accounts of John's brother [[James the Great|James]], \"the disciple whom Jesus loved\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The lowest register is again in bright colours and shows the calling of James and John. The images stays with scriptural tradition; they are accompanied by their father, and are the second pair to be called, after St. Peter and [[St. Andrew]], who are already at Jesus' side. [[Eagle of Saint John|The eagle]] at the foot of the window is John's usual symbol.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}}\n\n==Artwork, furnishings and liturgical collection==\nO'Connell commissioned the Cork firm of Egan & Sons for the altar plate and vestments. He had a strong view on how the chapel should be presented and was keen that its artwork would draw from Ireland's ancient culture. In this, he was heavily influenced by 19th century [[antiquarian]]'s research into early Christian and early medieval traditions and art, in particular the early medieval metal and stone works, and [[illuminated manuscript]]s at the time being newly discovered. He sought that the Honan would further reflect and promote the earlier period's emergent influence on Irish literature and visual culture.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=21}}\n\n===Furnishings===\nThe furnishings, including the pews, were designed to blend into the chapel's Celtic Revival style, and, according to Teehan create \"a way that represented the spirit and skill of earlier times , [that] could be nonetheless be fully appreciated by contemporary society. The overall effect is one of simplicity and restfulness.\" Such pieces include the circular iron ventilation ceiling panels and the chair and [[kneeler]] reserved for the president. Most of these wfittings were designed by McMullen, most of the others, including the [[pew]]s, by Sisk & Son. Changes in [[liturgy]] following [[Vatican II]] meant that a number of furnishing had to be replaced, most of which were physically moved to storerooms of the University.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=232}}\n\n===Metalwork===\nThe chapel has an extensive collection of metalwork and enamel pieces. They were built by Edmond Johnson's, Dublin, and the Cork firm William Egan & sons. All are in the Celtic Revival style. A highlight is the large [[processional cross]], a replication of the 12th century [[Cross of Cong]], which contains a number of inscriptions, including a remembrance for the chapel's benefactors: Mathew, Robert and Isabella Honan, and for John and Mary O'Connell.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}{{sfn|Beecher|1971|p=53}} Other items include a processional crosses, [[chalice]]s, candlesticks, dishes, bells, hinges, and the iron gates at the entrance.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=202-209}}\n\n===Textiles===\nMost of the textile collection was designed by the [[Dun Emer Press|Durn Emer]] guild, Dublin, and includes vestments, [[chasuble]]s, burses, veils, [[stole]]s, [[Maniple (vestment)|maniple]]s, altar cloths, wall hangings and altar fronts. Materials vary from silk embroidery, gold braid, gold thread, linen, [[poplin]] and cotton. The names of seamstresses from the Egan workshop are embroidered in the lining of some of the textile commissions.<ref name=\"ff\" /> In general the textiles are coloured in line with changes in the seasonal of the liturgical year. Most of the designs are centred around the Life of Mary, or the Passion, or Crucifixion, with black and white being the predominant colours.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=2010-225}} A highlight is the  Y-shaped, silver threaded [[chasuble]] in black poplin cloth, used as a vestment for funerals. A violet altar cloth with a frontlet, decorated with Celtic interlacing in shades of purple silk, orange and yellow highlights, and a border of lemon and violet cotton satin, is used to decorate the altar and candlesticks.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=201}}\n\nThe \"Black set\" of Honan textiles includes an altar frontal with a Celtic cross based on a grave stone from [[Tullylease]] Cork, a black [[cope]] and hood containing a crown of thorns design,{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=212}} and a black chasuble designed for funeral masses containing Celtic interlace patterns.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=213}}\n\n==Mosaic floor==\n[[File:Cork - Honan Chapel - 20180907115659.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|River of Life with fish]]\n[[File:Honan floor Tyger.jpg|thumb|upright==1.0|Pelican and tiger]]\nThe mosaic flooring was designed and installed by a German firm lead by the English resident Ludwig Oppenheimer.

The pattern at the entrance contains a verse from [[Psalm 148]] (\"Praise to the Lord from Creation\").{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=114}}\n\n[[File:Cork - Honan Chapel - 20180907115632.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Floor mosaic with sea creature]]\nThe floor mosaic comprises of four sections. It begins at the main entrance on the west side with a [[sunburst]] and stars, surrounded by signs of the zodiac. The center of the aisle shows a beast's head, acting as the river mouth{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=107}} from which flows a river with fish swimming towards the chancel. The east side of the nave contains a large coiled sea creature, which appears to be part serpent, part dragon, part whale, {{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} and a number of animals, including stags, deer and sheep, drinking from the river. Around them a series of exotic birds flying within forest trees.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} The section inside the chancel itself show a globe and symbols of creation, including animals, plants and [[solar system|planets]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=111, 112}} Interlaced Celtic and [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphs]] designs around the borders unify the four sections.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|pp=293, 294}}\n\nThe image of the sun and surrounding night stars inside the chapel's entrance signifies both the new day and resurrection, as Jesus rose from the dead at dawn. Reflecting 12th century Christian art, the presence of signs of the zodiac indicate God's dominion over time.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} The beast's head in the aisle contains a series of tripartite motifs representing the [[Trinity]]: spirals, [[trefoil]] knots and interlace containing three [[Saltire|saltire crosses]]. The sea creature on the east end of the nave is mentioned in the verse contained on the floor by the entrance \"dracones et omnes abyssi\" (''Dragons and all the depths'').{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=116}} Alongside it are the words \"cete et omnia quae moventur in aquis\" (''whales and all that move in the water''), words that in medieval [[exegesis]] conjured images of death, and direct reference to [[Jonah]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} \n\nThe colouring of the floor by and inside the chancel is more subdued, and the imagery more restrained. The images show a paradise, that can be interpreted both as the [[garden of Eden]], or the eternal paradise promised at the end of time. The imagery is of the seasons, [[Classical element|elements]], and symbols of the [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=120-121}} \n\nA similar depiction on a 5th century sarcophagus in the [[Lateran Museum]] shows Jonah swimming towards the open jaws of a whale with horned ears, and a long, coiled tail.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}}<ref>Lawrence, Marion. \"Ships, Monsters and Jonah\". ''American Journal of Archaeology'', Volume 66, No. 3, 1962. {{JSTOR|501457}}</ref> The reference serves to emphasize how Jesus overcame death. This connection is further made by the inclusion of the trees ([[tree of life]]) which in mythology grow in paradise and represent Christ, and the surrounding animals at rest, presented as symbols of his Christian followers.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=118}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist-ua|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Baker|first= R.

The chapel was designed in 1914, with the building completed in 1916 and was fully furnished by 1917. The church's architecture and interior fittings are representative of the [[Celtic revival]] movement which sought to echo the [[Insular art|aesthetic style]] that flourished in Ireland and Britain between the 7th and 12th centuries.{{sfn|Sheehy|1980|pp=163, 164}}\n\nIt's construction was initiated and closely supervised by [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]], a leading member of the Celtic revival and [[Arts and Crafts]] movements. He was funded by Isabella Honan (1861-1913), the last member of a wealthy Cork family, who provided large donations towards the build of the chapel. O'Connell oversaw both the architecture design and the commissioning of its exterior carvings and statuettes, its floor, furniture and liturgical collection. He closely instructed the work of the architect James F. McMullen, the builders [[Sisk Group|John Sisk and Sons]], and hired the craftsmen and artists involved in the construction, many of whom incorporated elements of the [[Art Nouveau]] style into the design of the chapel.\n\nThe Honan is internationally known{{sfn|Teehan|2016|p=80}} for its interior which is designed and fitted in a traditionally Irish style, but with an appreciation of current trends in international art.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=3}} Its furnishings include the mosaic flooring, altar plates, metal work and enamels, liturgical textiles and sanctuary furnishings, and especially its nineteen [[stained glass]] windows. Eleven were designed and installed by [[Harry Clarke]], a major Irish artist who completed the works aged twenty seven. His windows were described by the art historian Nicola Gordon Bowe as \"arguably his greatest work in stained glass\".{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} A further eight were designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E. Child]], [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine O'Brien]] and [[Ethel Rhind]] of \"[[An T\u00far Gloine]]\" (''The Glass Tower'') cooperative studio, founded by [[Sarah Purser]] in 1903.\n\n==Commission==\nPopulation growth and migration in the early 20th century led to the development of a number of suburbs around [[Cork (city)|Cork city]]. This necessitated the building of churches to serve the people living in the new urban areas, and the Honan was the first church built in Cork in the new century. The reasons for its development were very different to those for other contemporary churches, resulting from a longstanding educational disagreement between the [[Protestant]] and Catholic hierarchies. Queens College Cork (today known as [[University College Cork]] (UCC)), was incorporated in 1845 as part of a series of new universities known as the Queen's Colleges,{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} under a charter that excluded Catholic students.{{sfn|Baker|1999|p=165}}\n\n[[File:Honan Hostel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|The Honan Hostel]]\nThis ended in 1911 when the Queen's Colleges folded as legal entities, and as a result students of both denominations were allowed to attend. The Irish Universities Act of 1908 stipulated that government funding could not be allocated towards \"any church, chapel, or other place of religious worship or observance\".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1908/act/38/enacted/en/print.html | title = Irish Universities Act, 1908 | publisher = Government of Ireland | website = irishstatutebook.ie | accessdate = 1 September 2019}}</ref> The 1908 legislation meant that any centre for Catholic students in an Irish university could only be attained through private funding.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} Such terms were seen by some as restrictive on Catholic students, including by Sir [[Bertram Windle]],{{sfn|Leland|2004}} the university's president, and [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]] (1868-1943), who described the act as \"absurd and scandalous\".{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=613}}<ref name=\"wg\" />\n\n===Isabella Honan===\nIsabella Honan (n\u00e9e Cunningham, 1861-1913) was the sister-in-law of Robert Honan, the last male heir of a wealthy Catholic family who had made their money in the 19th century as butter merchants.{{sfn|O'Connell|1916|p=11}}{{sfn|Ryan|2016|p=3}} Robert and his brother Matthew were dead by 1909{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}, with Robert having left his fortune to Isabella, who  died in August 1913.

The nave is lined with six at either side, mostly by Clarke, three in the west gable, and four in the chancel.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} O'Connell deliberately placed Harry Clarke and [[Sarah Purser]]'s [[An T\u00far Gloine]] studio in competition for the window's commission.{{sfn|Kennedy|2015|p=99}} After he was sent Clarke's initial designs for the St. Gobnait window, O'Connell immediately a total of eleven windows, out of a planned nineteen.{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1979|p=99}} Clarke's windows were praised by several commentators when first shown in Dublin, with collector Thomas Bodkin writing that \"nothing like Mr Clark's windows had been seen before in Ireland\" and noting the \"sustained magnificence of colour...intricate drawing...[and] lavish and mysterious [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]].\"{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=163}}\n\nThe Clarke and T\u00far Gloine's windows contain similar subject matter and imagery, but vastly differ in style.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} Clarke's are highly detailed, while An T\u00far Gloine's are deliberately simple. Both studios were asked to depict Gaelic saints from the \"golden age\" of [[Christianity in Ireland]].{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=28}} Each displayed their [[Modello|cartoons]] in Dublin before they were physically realised in Cork. Both shows were highly praised, and lead to some debate among art critics as to which sets were superior. In 1955, the Irish [[Michael J. O'Kelly]] summarised that each of the Honan windows are high quality and worthy of individual consideration. While his notes especially single out the windows designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E. Child]], O'Kelly believes that preferences come down to matters of personal taste.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294-295}}\n\nThe windows in the chancel are: Our Lord (or \"Christ [[Christ in Majesty|in Majesty]]\") (Child), Our Lady [[Our Lady of Sorrows|of Sorrows]] (Clarke), St. John (O'Brien) and St. Joseph (Clarke).{{sfn|HayesRogers|2012|pp=128, 130}} To the right of the chancel looking down are: St. Finnbarr (Clarke), St. Albert (Clarke), St. Declan (Clarke), St. Ailbe (Child), St. Fauchtna (Child) and St. Munchin (O'Brien).

The designs are deeply and richly coloured, employing a deep, thick and rich [[royal blue]] throughout. They contain simplified, often whimsical forms which are nevertheless highly stylised and evoke, in the words of the writer M. J. O'Kelly, \"the spirit of the [[Ancient Celtic religion|ancient Celt]]\".{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=295}} The panels blends Catholic [[iconography]] with motifs and events from Celtic mythology{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=19}} in a style that draws heavily from [[Art Nouveau]], in particular the darker, ''[[fin de si\u00e8cle]]'' works of [[Aubrey Beardsley]], [[Gustav Klimt]] and [[Egon Schiele]].{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}}\n\nThe panels contain a multitude of Celtic designs and motifs, and are filled with figures and incidents from the life of each saint. The most obvious Celtic embellishments are [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary's]] red hair and green [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], and Brendan's [[pampooties]].{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}} The light of St. [[Albert of Cashel]], who wears a purple [[chasuble]], crimson [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] and a bishop's [[mitre]], contains several Celtic motifs, including the bronze spirals placed around his hair and beard.{{sfn|Costigan|Cullen|2019|p=57}} His depictions often detail magical feats associated with the saint, which Gibbon describes as \"daring\" inclusions, given such deeds owe more to [[Paganism|pagan]] legend rather than \"respectable traits of virtue and holiness.\"{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}}\n\nSome of the windows came close to being destroyed during the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] in Dublin.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=19}} Before the windows were installed in Cork, the cartoons were displayed at his Dublin studio, where they were praised by contemporary art critics.{{efn-ua|Clarke's career in stained glass peaked early; from the mid 1920 he was preoccupied with legacy commissions left over from his father's workshop.

O'Kelly's describes the portrait of his eyes \"as look(ing) out on humanity with a welcoming and understanding sympathy.\"{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294-5}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"180px\" heights=\"180px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Hanan (b).jpg|\"St. Fachtna\", Child c. 1916\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Honan (d).jpg|\"St. Ailbe\" (detail), Child, c. 1916\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Hanan (a).jpg|\"St. Flannan\" (detail), O'Brien, c. 1916\n</gallery>\n\n====St. John (O'Brien)====\nO'Brien's \"St. John\" window is, according to the art historians Myra Hayes and Jessie Rogers, \"the only window in the entire chapel to portray biblical narratives in any detail.\"{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=128}} It is usually considered the strongest of An T\u00far Gloine's windows, both in the strength of its imagery and in its craftsmanship. Sometimes mistakenly attributed to Child, it is very different to Child's \"Our Lord\" window, which is reminiscent of a more traditional style of stained glass design. Although O'Brien has not received the same level of study as other members of the An T\u00far Gloine studio, both Virginia Teehan and Nicola Gordon Bowe have commented on her \"beguiling narrative details\" and \"successful harmonisation of colour with The Clarke windows in the chapel\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=131}}\n\nThe window is divided into three [[Register (art)|registers]], with three pairs of medallions below each panel. The imagery is mostly based on scenes from the life of Christ, based on the [[Gospel of John]], and draws more from close readings of scripture than traditions of iconography. The upper register is based on [[Revelation 1|Revelations 1:1]], and shows a vision of the glorified Christ in Majesty, with the Alpha and Omega symbols and the seven candles. John, who throughout the panels is depicted as beardless young man, is shown at the side with his head bowed. The two medallions below this are based on the Gospel of John, and show, on the left, [[St. Peter]] and John running towards Jesus' tomb (with John outpacing Peter), and on the right, Jesus walking with Peter, with St John following behind.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=130}}\n\nThe crucifixion scene in the central register is more richly coloured that the other panels, and per tradition shows Mary and St. John at the foot of the cross. Less usual, and more usual of Protestant than Catholic iconography,{{efn-ua|O'Brien, who joined An T\u00far Gloine in 1904, came from an [[Anglo-Irish]], and devout [[Church of Ireland]] family. She is credited with three windows in the Honan. See Hayes & Rogers (2012), pp. 130, 131}} is the presence of a serpent with its mouth open, coiled around the cross below Jesus' feet. The serpent probably refers to [[Seed of the woman|Genesis 3:15]], which reads: \"And I will put enmity between thee (the serpent) and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\"{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The medallions below the crucifixion reflect two accounts of John's brother [[James the Great|James]], \"the disciple whom Jesus loved\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The lowest register is again in bright colours and shows the calling of James and John. The images stays with scriptural tradition; they are accompanied by their father, and are the second pair to be called, after St. Peter and [[St. Andrew]], who are already at Jesus' side. [[Eagle of Saint John|The eagle]] at the foot of the window is John's usual symbol.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}}\n\n==Artwork, furnishings and liturgical collection==\nO'Connell commissioned the Cork firm of Egan & Sons for the altar plate and vestments. He had a strong view on how the chapel should be presented and was keen that its artwork would draw from Ireland's ancient culture. In this, he was heavily influenced by 19th century [[antiquarian]]'s research into early Christian and early medieval traditions and art, in particular the early medieval metal and stone works, and [[illuminated manuscript]]s at the time being newly discovered. He sought that the Honan would further reflect and promote the earlier period's emergent influence on Irish literature and visual culture.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=21}}\n\n===Furnishings===\nThe furnishings, including the pews, were designed to blend into the chapel's Celtic Revival style, and, according to Teehan create \"a way that represented the spirit and skill of earlier times , [that] could be nonetheless be fully appreciated by contemporary society. The overall effect is one of simplicity and restfulness.\" Such pieces include the circular iron ventilation ceiling panels and the chair and [[kneeler]] reserved for the president. Most of these wfittings were designed by McMullen, most of the others, including the [[pew]]s, by Sisk & Son. Changes in [[liturgy]] following [[Vatican II]] meant that a number of furnishing had to be replaced, most of which were physically moved to storerooms of the University.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=232}}\n\n===Metalwork===\nThe chapel has an extensive collection of metalwork and enamel pieces. They were built by Edmond Johnson's, Dublin, and the Cork firm William Egan & sons. All are in the Celtic Revival style. A highlight is the large [[processional cross]], a replication of the 12th century [[Cross of Cong]], which contains a number of inscriptions, including a remembrance for the chapel's benefactors: Mathew, Robert and Isabella Honan, and for John and Mary O'Connell.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}{{sfn|Beecher|1971|p=53}} Other items include a processional crosses, [[chalice]]s, candlesticks, dishes, bells, hinges, and the iron gates at the entrance.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=202-209}}\n\n===Textiles===\nMost of the textile collection was designed by the [[Dun Emer Press|Durn Emer]] guild, Dublin, and includes vestments, [[chasuble]]s, burses, veils, [[stole]]s, [[Maniple (vestment)|maniple]]s, altar cloths, wall hangings and altar fronts. Materials vary from silk embroidery, gold braid, gold thread, linen, [[poplin]] and cotton. The names of seamstresses from the Egan workshop are embroidered in the lining of some of the textile commissions.<ref name=\"ff\" /> In general the textiles are coloured in line with changes in the seasonal of the liturgical year. Most of the designs are centred around the Life of Mary, or the Passion, or Crucifixion, with black and white being the predominant colours.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=2010-225}} A highlight is the  Y-shaped, silver threaded [[chasuble]] in black poplin cloth, used as a vestment for funerals. A violet altar cloth with a frontlet, decorated with Celtic interlacing in shades of purple silk, orange and yellow highlights, and a border of lemon and violet cotton satin, is used to decorate the altar and candlesticks.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=201}}\n\nThe \"Black set\" of Honan textiles includes an altar frontal with a Celtic cross based on a grave stone from [[Tullylease]] Cork, a black [[cope]] and hood containing a crown of thorns design,{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=212}} and a black chasuble designed for funeral masses containing Celtic interlace patterns.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=213}}\n\n==Mosaic floor==\n[[File:Cork - Honan Chapel - 20180907115659.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|River of Life with fish]]\n[[File:Honan floor Tyger.jpg|thumb|upright==1.0|Pelican and tiger]]\nThe mosaic flooring was designed and installed by a German firm lead by the English resident Ludwig Oppenheimer. It is decorated with symbols the [[zodiac]],{{sfn|McClatchie|2006|p=14}} and images based on the Christian theme of the \"River of Life\",{{sfn|NIAH|2000}}{{sfn|Field|2006}} as well as depictions of flora, fauna and river scenes.<ref name=\"lel\" /> The designs celebrate the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] of the earth, and illustrate passages from the [[Old Testament]], including the \"[[Benedicite]]\" (also known as \"A Song of Creation\") from the [[Book of Daniel]], which was [[Laudate psalms|sung]] during the [[Lauds|office of lauds]] on Sundays and [[Calendar of saints|feast days]]. The pattern at the entrance contains a verse from [[Psalm 148]] (\"Praise to the Lord from Creation\").{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=114}}\n\n[[File:Cork - Honan Chapel - 20180907115632.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Floor mosaic with sea creature]]\nThe floor mosaic comprises of four sections. It begins at the main entrance on the west side with a [[sunburst]] and stars, surrounded by signs of the zodiac. The center of the aisle shows a beast's head, acting as the river mouth{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=107}} from which flows a river with fish swimming towards the chancel. The east side of the nave contains a large coiled sea creature, which appears to be part serpent, part dragon, part whale, {{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} and a number of animals, including stags, deer and sheep, drinking from the river. Around them a series of exotic birds flying within forest trees.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} The section inside the chancel itself show a globe and symbols of creation, including animals, plants and [[solar system|planets]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=111, 112}} Interlaced Celtic and [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphs]] designs around the borders unify the four sections.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|pp=293, 294}}\n\nThe image of the sun and surrounding night stars inside the chapel's entrance signifies both the new day and resurrection, as Jesus rose from the dead at dawn. Reflecting 12th century Christian art, the presence of signs of the zodiac indicate God's dominion over time.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} The beast's head in the aisle contains a series of tripartite motifs representing the [[Trinity]]: spirals, [[trefoil]] knots and interlace containing three [[Saltire|saltire crosses]]. The sea creature on the east end of the nave is mentioned in the verse contained on the floor by the entrance \"dracones et omnes abyssi\" (''Dragons and all the depths'').{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=116}} Alongside it are the words \"cete et omnia quae moventur in aquis\" (''whales and all that move in the water''), words that in medieval [[exegesis]] conjured images of death, and direct reference to [[Jonah]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} \n\nThe colouring of the floor by and inside the chancel is more subdued, and the imagery more restrained. The images show a paradise, that can be interpreted both as the [[garden of Eden]], or the eternal paradise promised at the end of time. The imagery is of the seasons, [[Classical element|elements]], and symbols of the [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=120-121}} \n\nA similar depiction on a 5th century sarcophagus in the [[Lateran Museum]] shows Jonah swimming towards the open jaws of a whale with horned ears, and a long, coiled tail.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}}<ref>Lawrence, Marion. \"Ships, Monsters and Jonah\". ''American Journal of Archaeology'', Volume 66, No. 3, 1962. {{JSTOR|501457}}</ref>The reference serves to emphasize how Jesus overcame death. This connection is further made by the inclusion of the trees ([[tree of life]]) which in mythology grow in paradise and represent Christ, and the surrounding animals at rest, presented as symbols of his Christian followers.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=118}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist-ua|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Baker|first= R.
