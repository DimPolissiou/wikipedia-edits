Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1972, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> \n\nBanneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1972, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> \n\nBanneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

The story is set during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the [[War of 1812]].\n\nThe story from ''Treason's Harbour'' has several points resolved, as to the success of Maturin's work identifying the French spies, the trap that Aubrey sailed out of but HMS ''Pollux'' did not, and Aubrey resolving the tension between him and Lieutenant Fielding, who escaped the worst French prisoner-of-war facility. In Gibraltar, Captain Aubrey receives another mission, to sail [[HMS Surprise (O'Brian novels)|HMS ''Surprise'']] to protect British whalers in the Pacific Ocean from USS ''Norfolk'', for his first voyage around Cape Horn. Dr Maturin has not yet identified the high-level spy who got away. Unaware, he sends the letter to his own wife explaining his protection of the Navy wife via that very villain. The Pacific Ocean is full of wonders, and prizes, once the Jonah is off the ship.\n\nOne review considered this and the previous novel, ''Treason's Harbour'', to be one novel in two volumes. O'Brian \"writes historical novels without the swashbuckling.\"<ref name=Reardon1992 />\n\n==Plot summary==\nAubrey meets Admiral Ives, now in Gibraltar, who is pleased with the last mission of HMS ''Surprise'', despite Aubrey's negative report. Mr Yarrow will rephrase it to make the success clearer to the Admiralty. The admiral is now a peer, his deepest wish, and he is a happy man. Aubrey dines with Laura Fielding and her husband, Lieutenant Fielding, who is now satisfied that his wife is true to him and thanks Aubrey for bringing her from Malta to Gibraltar (though it is Maturin who brought her to the ship, saving her from two assassins). Maturin receives news from his intelligence-chief in London, Sir Joseph Blaine, confirming high level infiltration of British intelligence by the French. Maturin's wife Diana has heard rumours of his pretended infidelity in [[Valletta]], Malta, with Mrs Fielding for intelligence reasons. He sends her a letter via Andrew Wray, unsuspecting of Wray's role as a French agent. Maturin learns of his success in Malta, destroying the French intelligence network based there, all but Andr\u00e9 Lesueur taken.\n\n''Surprise'' is not yet to be broken up; Admiral Ives sends Aubrey on a mission to protect British whalers in the Pacific Ocean from the USS ''Norfolk'', sailing on HMS ''Surprise'' on his first voyage around [[Cape Horn]]. Aubrey makes all haste to prepare his ship with men and supplies. He recruits Mr Allen, a new master with an in-depth knowledge of whalers, takes on Mr Martin as schoolmaster to the midshipmen, and Mr Hollom, an ageing midshipman. Aubrey wonders if his kindness takes aboard a [[Sailors' superstitions#Jonah|Jonah]] with Hollom.\n\nThe ''Surprise'' sails to the farthest east point of Brazil, where the bowsprit is burnt by lightning. During the repairs in Penedo, Pullings sees the USS ''Norfolk'' pass by. Mrs Horner, the gunner's wife, engages in an affair with Hollom, and becomes pregnant. Maturin will not interfere with the pregnancy, so she turns to his assistant, Higgins, who leaves her near death. Maturin saves her life. In the Atlantic, ''Surprise'' retakes the packet ''Dana\u00eb'', with Lieutenant Lawrence in command. Tom Pullings sails the ''Danae'' back to England, after Maturin and Aubrey take possession of a hidden brass box, per instructions to Maturin. ''Surprise'' rounds Cape Horn with some losses, and then reaches the [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands]] to refit and recover. There, the gunner kills his wife and Hollom, and re-boards the ship. Off Chile, Horner learns that Higgins performed an abortion on his wife; Higgins disappears from the ship and Horner hangs himself in his cabin. In the Pacific, with information from a Spanish merchantman, ''Surprise'' retakes the valuable whaler ''Acapulco'' with Caleb Gill in command, nephew to the ''Norfolk'''s captain. Mr Allen negotiates with the agent for the whaler in Valparaiso, where the American prisoners are left ashore. Taking the whaler restores the spirit to the crew.\n\nArrived at the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands|Galapagos archipelago]], Maturin and Martin are amazed at the new species they see on land, in the air and in the sea. ''Surprise'' picks up men from the whaler ''Intrepid Fox'', now burnt by USS ''Norfolk''. Knowing where the ''Norfolk'' is headed, Aubrey sails along the equator west toward the Marquesas. Maturin is disappointed and furious that the promise made to let him explore ashore is broken. Aubrey saves Maturin when he falls overboard one evening, but no one misses them until dawn. The two men are rescued by Polynesian women on a [[Drua#Origins|pahi]], who ultimately leave them on a small island with a fishing line. The [[Ship's boat|launch]] from the ''Surprise'' finds them. Maturin is needed aboard ''Surprise'', as the group sent to board the pahi was cruelly beaten by the women.\n\nAfter surviving the tail of a typhoon, the ''Surprise'' finds the ''Norfolk'' wrecked on a reef by the same typhoon and her survivors encamped on an island. Aubrey, Mr Martin and some of the crew take Maturin ashore for surgery; he is in a coma since hitting his head during the typhoon. Just as the surgeon from the ''Norfolk'', Dr Butcher, prepares to operate, Maturin wakes from his coma. A heavy storm blows the ''Surprise'' away. Relations between the two marooned groups are tense, because some of the crew on the Norfolk were British mutineers and deserters in 1797 aboard [[HMS Hermione (1782)|HMS ''Hermione'']]; they will be hanged for desertion and mutiny if they are returned to the Royal Navy. One admits this to Bonden. Aubrey tells the American Captain Palmer that he and his crew are now prisoners of war. Both groups are eager to leave this island. Aubrey orders his carpenters to lengthen the launch so they can sail away, pushing the rest to collect food. He sees an American whaler on the horizon. The crew of the ''Norfolk'' spot the same whaler, cheer at the sight, and then kill their informer. The Norfolks fight with the Surprises. Their cheering stops when the whaler loses two masts and [[striking the colors|strikes her colours]], because it is the ''Surprise'' that takes her in chase.\n\n==Characters ==\n\n''See also [[Recurring characters in the Aubrey\u2013Maturin series]]''\n\n*[[Jack Aubrey]]: Captain of HMS ''Surprise''.\n*[[Stephen Maturin]]: ship's surgeon, friend to Jack, natural philosopher and an intelligence officer. \n*Sophia Aubrey (n\u00e9e Williams): wife of Jack and mother of their three children.

In respect to the [[Aubrey\u2013Maturin series#Internal Chronology|internal chronology]] of the series, it is the fourth of eleven novels (beginning with ''The Surgeon's Mate'') that might take five or six years to happen but are all pegged to an extended 1812, or as Patrick O'Brian says it, 1812a and 1812b (in the Author's Note for ''The Far Side of the World'', the tenth novel in this series). The events of ''The Yellow Admiral'' again match up with the historical years of the Napoleonic wars in sequence, as the first six novels did.\n\n==Reviews==\n\nPatrick Reardon, writing in the ''Chicago Tribune'', reviewed this novel and the previous one, ''Treason's Harbour'', as paired, one two-volume novel. He notes that \"O`Brian writes about people, not characters.\"<ref name=Reardon1992>{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-04-17/features/9202040188_1_patrick-o-brian-jack-aubrey-stephen-maturin |title=An Interweaving Of Lives On A 19th Century Ship |last=Reardon |first=Patrick T |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=14 September 2017 |date=17 April 1992}}</ref> Though there is action, there are battles, the author gives the reader \"the everyday meat of life, about emotions that are deep and complex, and are more important than the plot,\" and he \"writes historical novels without the swashbuckling.\"<ref name=Reardon1992 />\n\n==Historical references==\n\nIn the Author's Note, O'Brian says that the USS ''Norfolk'' is a reference the historical expedition of the [[USS Essex (1799)|USS ''Essex'']]. ''Essex'' sailed in South Atlantic waters and along the coast of Brazil until January 1813 when Captain [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]] undertook commerce raiding against British whaling fisheries in the Pacific.<ref name=\"Porter\">{{cite web |url=http://inportercounty.org/Data/PorterCountyCentennial/Sec1-4_PorterCoCenn-DavidPorterDiagram.html |title=Diagram of Commodore David Porter's Exploits Against British in 1812\u20131814 |first=Norman |last=Ingrey |work=The Vidette-Messenger Centennial Edition 1936 |publisher=Porter County Indiana GenWeb project of 2008 |accessdate=3 July 2014}}</ref> Although her voyage was hampered from a shortage of provisions and heavy gales while rounding Cape Horn, she anchored safely at [[Valpara\u00edso]], [[Chile]], on 14 March, having seized schooners ''Elizabeth'' and ''Nereyda'' along the way. The next five months brought ''Essex'' 13 prizes.\n\nPorter sailed into the harbour of [[Valpara\u00edso]] to avoid a British force of a frigate and a brig-sloop waiting for him outside of the harbour. On 28 March 1814, Porter sailed out of the harbour, but upon sighting British forces began to retreat back into the harbour. He was easily defeated by the opposing captain, James Hillyar. In his final report, David Porter claimed that the British had violated neutrality, conducted themselves dishonorably and inhumanely, and plundered his personal property after the engagement. He stated that the loss of ''Essex'' was simply due to a series of misfortunes and blamed [[Paul Hamilton (politician)|Paul Hamilton]] for his all short range carronade armament. He wrote to Secretary Jones \"I hope, Sir, that our conduct may prove satisfactory to our country.\" Porter finally claimed that the United States had the right to reclaim ''Essex'' from the British. The only viable parts of Porter's report was that ''Essex'' was only armed with short-range carronades and that he had lost his top-mast. The British had not violated neutrality, conducted themselves dishonorably, nor plundered his personal belongings. There were no further misfortunes aboard ''Essex''. In fact, the entire engagement was caused by Porter's attempt to achieve personal glory by defeating the British rather than following his orders not to engage them. Porter could have very well not returned to Valpara\u00edso where he would be blockaded, as he knew ''Phoebe'' and ''Cherub'' would arrive. The United States by no means had any right to reclaim ''Essex'' given the circumstances of the battle.\n\nIn contrast, Hillyar praised Porter for good conduct and claimed he only surrendered when all his options were expended. Hillyar found Essex with provisions for a six-month cruise. He moved all the ships to Valpara\u00edso and transferred the prisoners to a Spanish [[prison hulk]]. On 2 April 1814, Hillyar repaired shot holes on below ''Pheobe''{{'}}s waterline. On 13 April ''Tagus'' and ''Nereus'' arrived. on 26 April the prisoners were moved to ''Essex Junior'' and ferried them away. Hillyar would help reconcile the Peruvian and Chilean governments which the British gave more attention to as the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]] had ended and [[Napoleon]] was exiled.\n\nThe famous author [[Herman Melville]] criticized Porter's refusal to strike his colors when it became clear that the situation was hopeless, instead of seeking to \"crown himself with the glory of the shambles, by permitting his hopeless crew to be butchered before his eyes.\" \"Nor, by thus continuing to fight, did this American frigate, one iota, promote the true interests of her country.\"\n\n==Film adaptation==\nThe novel provided part of the title and some of the plot-structure for the 2003 [[Peter Weir]] film, ''[[Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World]]''. The fictional USS ''Norfolk'' morphed into the fictional American-built French privateer ''Acheron'', and episodes also migrated from other books in the series, including ''Master and Commander'' and ''HMS Surprise''. The design and size of the fictional ''Acheron'' reflect those of the [[USS Constitution|USS ''Constitution'']].\n\nIn reviewing the film, [[Christopher Hitchens]] commented on the action scenes from this novel that were depicted in the film. He finds \"the summa of O'Brian's genius was the invention of Dr. Stephen Maturin. He is the ship's gifted surgeon, but he is also a scientist, an espionage agent for the Admiralty, a man of part Irish and part Catalan birth\u2014and a revolutionary. He joins the British side, having earlier fought against it, because of his hatred for Bonaparte's betrayal of the principles of 1789\u2014principles that are perfectly obscure to bluff Capt. Jack Aubrey. Any cinematic adaptation of O'Brian must stand or fall by its success in representing this figure. On this the film doesn't even fall, let alone stand. It skips the whole project.\" He finds the action scenes more inspirational: \"In one respect the action lives up to its fictional and actual inspiration. This was the age of Bligh and Cook and of voyages of discovery as well as conquest, and when HMS ''Surprise'' makes landfall in the Galapagos Islands we get a beautifully filmed sequence about how the dawn of scientific enlightenment might have felt.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2003/11/empire_falls.html |title=Empire Falls \u2013 How Master and Commander gets Patrick O'Brian wrong. |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens |date=14 November 2003 |work=Slate |accessdate=24 April 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\n*Collins hardback first edition 1984 {{ISBN|0002227118}}\n*Fontana Paperback edition 1985 \n*W.

Norton issued ''The Far Side of the World'' eight years after its initial publication, as a paperback in 1992. Ironically, it was a US publisher, [[J. B. Lippincott & Co.]], who asked O'Brian to write the first book in the series, ''[[Master and Commander]]'' published in 1969. [[HarperCollins|Collins]] picked it up in the UK in 1970, and continued to publish each novel as O'Brian completed another story. Beginning with ''[[The Nutmeg of Consolation]]'' in 1991, the novels were released at about the same time in the USA (by W. W.

The story is set during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the [[War of 1812]].\n\nThe story from ''Treason's Harbour'' has several points resolved, as to the success of Maturin's work identifying the French spies, the trap that Aubrey sailed out of but HMS ''Pollux'' did not, and Aubrey resolving the tension between him and Lieutenant Fielding, who escaped the worst French prisoner-of-war facility. In Gibraltar, Captain Aubrey receives another mission, to sail [[HMS Surprise (O'Brian novels)|HMS ''Surprise'']] to protect British whalers in the Pacific Ocean from USS ''Norfolk'', for his first voyage around Cape Horn. Dr Maturin has not yet identified the high-level spy who got away. Unaware, he sends the letter to his own wife explaining his protection of the Navy wife via that very villain. The Pacific Ocean is full of wonders, and prizes, once the Jonah is off the ship.\n\nOne review considered this and the previous novel, ''Treason's Harbour'', to be one novel in two volumes. O'Brian \"writes historical novels without the swashbuckling.\"<ref name=Reardon1992 />\n\n==Plot summary==\nAubrey meets Admiral Ives, now in Gibraltar, who is pleased with the last mission of HMS ''Surprise'', despite Aubrey's negative report. Mr Yarrow will rephrase it to make the success clearer to the Admiralty. The admiral is now a peer, his deepest wish, and he is a happy man. Aubrey dines with Laura Fielding and her husband, Lieutenant Fielding, who is now satisfied that his wife is true to him and thanks Aubrey for bringing her from Malta to Gibraltar (though it is Maturin who brought her to the ship, saving her from two assassins). Maturin receives news from his intelligence-chief in London, Sir Joseph Blaine, confirming high level infiltration of British intelligence by the French. Maturin's wife Diana has heard rumours of his pretended infidelity in [[Valletta]], Malta, with Mrs Fielding for intelligence reasons. He sends her a letter via Andrew Wray, unsuspecting of Wray's role as a French agent. Maturin learns of his success in Malta, destroying the French intelligence network based there, all but Andr\u00e9 Lesueur taken.\n\n''Surprise'' is not yet to be broken up; Admiral Ives sends Aubrey on a mission to protect British whalers in the Pacific Ocean from the USS ''Norfolk'', sailing on HMS ''Surprise'' on his first voyage around [[Cape Horn]]. Aubrey makes all haste to prepare his ship with men and supplies. He recruits Mr Allen, a new master with an in-depth knowledge of whalers, takes on Mr Martin as schoolmaster to the midshipmen, and Mr Hollom, an ageing midshipman. Aubrey wonders if his kindness takes aboard a [[Sailors' superstitions#Jonah|Jonah]] with Hollom.\n\nThe ''Surprise'' sails to the farthest east point of Brazil, where the bowsprit is burnt by lightning. During the repairs in Penedo, Pullings sees the USS ''Norfolk'' pass by. Mrs Horner, the gunner's wife, engages in an affair with Hollom, and becomes pregnant. Maturin will not interfere with the pregnancy, so she turns to his assistant, Higgins, who leaves her near death. Maturin saves her life. In the Atlantic, ''Surprise'' retakes the packet ''Dana\u00eb'', with Lieutenant Lawrence in command. Tom Pullings sails the ''Danae'' back to England, after Maturin and Aubrey take possession of a hidden brass box, per instructions to Maturin. ''Surprise'' rounds Cape Horn with some losses, and then reaches the [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands]] to refit and recover. There, the gunner kills his wife and Hollom, and re-boards the ship. Off Chile, Horner learns that Higgins performed an abortion on his wife; Higgins disappears from the ship and Horner hangs himself in his cabin. In the Pacific, with information from a Spanish merchantman, ''Surprise'' retakes the valuable whaler ''Acapulco'' with Caleb Gill in command, nephew to the ''Norfolk'''s captain. Mr Allen negotiates with the agent for the whaler in Valparaiso, where the American prisoners are left ashore. Taking the whaler restores the spirit to the crew.\n\nArrived at the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands|Galapagos archipelago]], Maturin and Martin are amazed at the new species they see on land, in the air and in the sea. ''Surprise'' picks up men from the whaler ''Intrepid Fox'', now burnt by USS ''Norfolk''. Knowing where the ''Norfolk'' is headed, Aubrey sails along the equator west toward the Marquesas. Maturin is disappointed and furious that the promise made to let him explore ashore is broken. Aubrey saves Maturin when he falls overboard one evening, but no one misses them until dawn. The two men are rescued by Polynesian women on a [[Drua#Origins|pahi]], who ultimately leave them on a small island with a fishing line. The [[Ship's boat|launch]] from the ''Surprise'' finds them. Maturin is needed aboard ''Surprise'', as the group sent to board the pahi was cruelly beaten by the women.\n\nAfter surviving the tail of a typhoon, the ''Surprise'' finds the ''Norfolk'' wrecked on a reef by the same typhoon and her survivors encamped on an island. Aubrey, Mr Martin and some of the crew take Maturin ashore for surgery; he is in a coma since hitting his head during the typhoon. Just as the surgeon from the ''Norfolk'', Dr Butcher, prepares to operate, Maturin wakes from his coma. A heavy storm blows the ''Surprise'' away. Relations between the two marooned groups are tense, because some of the crew on the Norfolk were British mutineers and deserters in 1797 aboard [[HMS Hermione (1782)|HMS ''Hermione'']]; they will be hanged for desertion and mutiny if they are returned to the Royal Navy. One admits this to Bonden. Aubrey tells the American Captain Palmer that he and his crew are now prisoners of war. Both groups are eager to leave this island. Aubrey orders his carpenters to lengthen the launch so they can sail away, pushing the rest to collect food. He sees an American whaler on the horizon. The crew of the ''Norfolk'' spot the same whaler, cheer at the sight, and then kill their informer. The Norfolks fight with the Surprises. Their cheering stops when the whaler loses two masts and [[striking the colors|strikes her colours]], because it is the ''Surprise'' that takes her in chase.\n\n==Characters ==\n\n''See also [[Recurring characters in the Aubrey\u2013Maturin series]]''\n\n*[[Jack Aubrey]]: Captain of HMS ''Surprise''.\n*[[Stephen Maturin]]: ship's surgeon, friend to Jack, natural philosopher and an intelligence officer. \n*Sophia Aubrey (n\u00e9e Williams): wife of Jack and mother of their three children.

In respect to the [[Aubrey\u2013Maturin series#Internal Chronology|internal chronology]] of the series, it is the fourth of eleven novels (beginning with ''The Surgeon's Mate'') that might take five or six years to happen but are all pegged to an extended 1812, or as Patrick O'Brian says it, 1812a and 1812b (in the Author's Note for ''The Far Side of the World'', the tenth novel in this series). The events of ''The Yellow Admiral'' again match up with the historical years of the Napoleonic wars in sequence, as the first six novels did.\n\n==Reviews==\n\nPatrick Reardon, writing in the ''Chicago Tribune'', reviewed this novel and the previous one, ''Treason's Harbour'', as paired, one two-volume novel. He notes that \"O`Brian writes about people, not characters.\"<ref name=Reardon1992>{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-04-17/features/9202040188_1_patrick-o-brian-jack-aubrey-stephen-maturin |title=An Interweaving Of Lives On A 19th Century Ship |last=Reardon |first=Patrick T |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=14 September 2017 |date=17 April 1992}}</ref> Though there is action, there are battles, the author gives the reader \"the everyday meat of life, about emotions that are deep and complex, and are more important than the plot,\" and he \"writes historical novels without the swashbuckling.\"<ref name=Reardon1992 />\n\n==Historical references==\n\nIn the Author's Note, O'Brian says that the USS ''Norfolk'' is a reference the historical expedition of the [[USS Essex (1799)|USS ''Essex'']]. ''Essex'' sailed in South Atlantic waters and along the coast of Brazil until January 1813 when Captain [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]] undertook commerce raiding against British whaling fisheries in the Pacific.<ref name=\"Porter\">{{cite web |url=http://inportercounty.org/Data/PorterCountyCentennial/Sec1-4_PorterCoCenn-DavidPorterDiagram.html |title=Diagram of Commodore David Porter's Exploits Against British in 1812\u20131814 |first=Norman |last=Ingrey |work=The Vidette-Messenger Centennial Edition 1936 |publisher=Porter County Indiana GenWeb project of 2008 |accessdate=3 July 2014}}</ref> Although her voyage was hampered from a shortage of provisions and heavy gales while rounding Cape Horn, she anchored safely at [[Valpara\u00edso]], [[Chile]], on 14 March, having seized schooners ''Elizabeth'' and ''Nereyda'' along the way. The next five months brought ''Essex'' 13 prizes.\n\nPorter sailed into the harbour of [[Valpara\u00edso]] to avoid a British force of a frigate and a brig-sloop waiting for him outside of the harbour. On 28 March 1814, Porter sailed out of the harbour, but upon sighting British forces began to retreat back into the harbour. He was easily defeated by the opposing captain, James Hillyar. In his final report, David Porter claimed that the British had violated neutrality, conducted themselves dishonorably and inhumanely, and plundered his personal property after the engagement. He stated that the loss of ''Essex'' was simply due to a series of misfortunes and blamed [[Paul Hamilton (politician)|Paul Hamilton]] for his all short range carronade armament. He wrote to Secretary Jones \"I hope, Sir, that our conduct may prove satisfactory to our country.\" Porter finally claimed that the United States had the right to reclaim ''Essex'' from the British. The only viable parts of Porter's report was that ''Essex'' was only armed with short-range carronades and that he had lost his top-mast. The British had not violated neutrality, conducted themselves dishonorably, nor plundered his personal belongings. There were no further misfortunes aboard ''Essex''. In fact, the entire engagement was caused by Porter's attempt to achieve personal glory by defeating the British rather than following his orders not to engage them. Porter could have very well not returned to Valpara\u00edso where he would be blockaded, as he knew ''Phoebe'' and ''Cherub'' would arrive. The United States by no means had any right to reclaim ''Essex'' given the circumstances of the battle.\n\nIn contrast, Hillyar praised Porter for good conduct and claimed he only surrendered when all his options were expended. Hillyar found Essex with provisions for a six-month cruise. He moved all the ships to Valpara\u00edso and transferred the prisoners to a Spanish [[prison hulk]]. On 2 April 1814, Hillyar repaired shot holes on below ''Pheobe''{{'}}s waterline. On 13 April ''Tagus'' and ''Nereus'' arrived. on 26 April the prisoners were moved to ''Essex Junior'' and ferried them away. Hillyar would help reconcile the Peruvian and Chilean governments which the British gave more attention to as the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]] had ended and [[Napoleon]] was exiled.\n\n==Film adaptation==\nThe novel provided part of the title and some of the plot-structure for the 2003 [[Peter Weir]] film, ''[[Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World]]''. The fictional USS ''Norfolk'' morphed into the fictional American-built French privateer ''Acheron'', and episodes also migrated from other books in the series, including ''Master and Commander'' and ''HMS Surprise''. The design and size of the fictional ''Acheron'' reflect those of the [[USS Constitution|USS ''Constitution'']].\n\nIn reviewing the film, [[Christopher Hitchens]] commented on the action scenes from this novel that were depicted in the film. He finds \"the summa of O'Brian's genius was the invention of Dr. Stephen Maturin. He is the ship's gifted surgeon, but he is also a scientist, an espionage agent for the Admiralty, a man of part Irish and part Catalan birth\u2014and a revolutionary. He joins the British side, having earlier fought against it, because of his hatred for Bonaparte's betrayal of the principles of 1789\u2014principles that are perfectly obscure to bluff Capt. Jack Aubrey. Any cinematic adaptation of O'Brian must stand or fall by its success in representing this figure. On this the film doesn't even fall, let alone stand. It skips the whole project.\" He finds the action scenes more inspirational: \"In one respect the action lives up to its fictional and actual inspiration. This was the age of Bligh and Cook and of voyages of discovery as well as conquest, and when HMS ''Surprise'' makes landfall in the Galapagos Islands we get a beautifully filmed sequence about how the dawn of scientific enlightenment might have felt.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2003/11/empire_falls.html |title=Empire Falls \u2013 How Master and Commander gets Patrick O'Brian wrong. |first=Christopher |last=Hitchens |date=14 November 2003 |work=Slate |accessdate=24 April 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\n*Collins hardback first edition 1984 {{ISBN|0002227118}}\n*Fontana Paperback edition 1985 \n*W.

Norton issued ''The Far Side of the World'' eight years after its initial publication, as a paperback in 1992. Ironically, it was a US publisher, [[J. B. Lippincott & Co.]], who asked O'Brian to write the first book in the series, ''[[Master and Commander]]'' published in 1969. [[HarperCollins|Collins]] picked it up in the UK in 1970, and continued to publish each novel as O'Brian completed another story.

Finding the shortest path in a graph using optimal substructure; a straight line indicates a single edge; a wavy line indicates a shortest path between the two vertices it connects (among other paths, not shown, sharing the same two vertices); the bold line is the overall shortest path from start to goal.]]\n'''Dynamic programming''' is both a [[mathematical optimization]] method and a computer programming method. The method was developed by [[Richard Bellman]] in the 1950s and has found applications in numerous fields, from [[aerospace engineering]] to [[economics]]. In both contexts it refers to simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a [[Recursion|recursive]] manner. While some decision problems cannot be taken apart this way, decisions that span several points in time do often break apart recursively. Likewise, in computer science, if a problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then recursively finding the optimal solutions to the sub-problems, then it is said to have [[optimal substructure]].\n\nIf sub-problems can be nested recursively inside larger problems, so that dynamic programming methods are applicable, then there is a relation between the value of the larger problem and the values of the sub-problems.<ref name=\":0\">Cormen, T. H.; Leiserson, C. E.; Rivest, R. L.; Stein, C. (2001), Introduction to Algorithms (2nd ed.), MIT Press & McGraw\u2013Hill, {{ISBN|0-262-03293-7}} . pp. 344.</ref> In the optimization literature this relationship is called the [[Bellman equation]].\n\n== Overview ==\n\n=== Mathematical optimization ===\nIn terms of mathematical optimization, dynamic programming usually refers to simplifying a decision by breaking it down into a sequence of decision steps over time. This is done by defining a sequence of '''value functions''' ''V''<sub>1</sub>, ''V''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''V''<sub>''n''</sub> taking ''y'' as an argument representing the '''[[State variable|state]]''' of the system at times ''i'' from 1 to ''n''. The definition of ''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''y'') is the value obtained in state ''y'' at the last time ''n''. The values ''V''<sub>''i''</sub> at earlier times ''i''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;&minus;1,&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;2,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;1 can be found by working backwards, using a [[Recursion|recursive]] relationship called the [[Bellman equation]]. For ''i''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''n'', ''V''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub> at any state ''y'' is calculated from ''V''<sub>''i''</sub> by maximizing a simple function (usually the sum) of the gain from a decision at time ''i''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 and the function ''V''<sub>''i''</sub> at the new state of the system if this decision is made. Since ''V''<sub>''i''</sub> has already been calculated for the needed states, the above operation yields ''V''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub> for those states. Finally, ''V''<sub>1</sub> at the initial state of the system is the value of the optimal solution. The optimal values of the decision variables can be recovered, one by one, by tracking back the calculations already performed.\n\n=== Control theory ===\nIn [[control theory]], a typical problem is to find an admissible control <math>\\mathbf{u}^{\\ast}</math> which causes the system <math>\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t) = \\mathbf{g} \\left( \\mathbf{x}(t), \\mathbf{u}(t), t \\right)</math> to follow an admissible trajectory <math>\\mathbf{x}^{\\ast}</math> on a continuous time interval <math>t_{0} \\leq t \\leq t_{1}</math> that minimizes a [[Loss function|cost function]]\n:<math>J = b \\left( \\mathbf{x}(t_{1}), t_{1} \\right) + \\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}} f \\left( \\mathbf{x}(t), \\mathbf{u}(t), t \\right) \\mathrm{d} t</math> \nThe solution to this problem is an optimal control law or policy <math>\\mathbf{u}^{\\ast} = h(\\mathbf{x}(t), t)</math>, which produces an optimal trajectory <math>\\mathbf{x}^{\\ast}</math> and an optimized loss function <math>J^{\\ast}</math>. The latter obeys the fundamental equation of dynamic programming:\n:<math>- J_{t}^{\\ast} = \\min_{\\mathbf{u}} \\left\\{ f \\left( \\mathbf{x}(t), \\mathbf{u}(t), t \\right) + J_{x}^{\\ast \\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{g} \\left( \\mathbf{x}(t), \\mathbf{u}(t), t \\right) \\right\\}</math>\na [[partial differential equation]] known as the [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\u2013Bellman equation]], in which <math>J_{x}^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\partial J^{\\ast}}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}} = \\left[ \\frac{\\partial J^{\\ast}}{\\partial x_{1}} ~~~~ \\frac{\\partial J^{\\ast}}{\\partial x_{2}} ~~~~ \\dots ~~~~  \\frac{\\partial J^{\\ast}}{\\partial x_{n}} \\right]^{\\mathsf{T}}</math> and <math>J_{t}^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\partial J^{\\ast}}{\\partial t}</math>. One finds the minimizing <math>\\mathbf{u}</math> in terms of <math>t</math>, <math>\\mathbf{x}</math>, and the unknown function <math>J_{x}^{\\ast}</math> and then substitutes the result into the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\u2013Bellman equation to get the partial differential equation to be solved with boundary condition <math>J \\left( t_{1} \\right) = b \\left( \\mathbf{x}(t_{1}), t_{1} \\right)</math>.<ref>{{cite book |first=M.

In Ramsey's problem, this function relates amounts of consumption to levels of [[utility]]. Loosely speaking, the planner faces the trade-off between contemporaneous consumption and future consumption (via investment in [[Physical capital|capital stock]] that is used in production), known as [[intertemporal choice]]. Future consumption is discounted at a constant rate <math>\\beta \\in (0,1)</math>. A discrete approximation to the transition equation of capital is given by\n:<math>k_{t+1} = \\hat{g} \\left( k_{t}, c_{t} \\right) = f(k_{t}) - c_{t}</math>\nwhere <math>c</math> is consumption, <math>k</math> is capital, and <math>f</math> is a [[production function]] satisfying the [[Inada conditions]]. An initial capital stock <math>k_{0} > 0</math> is assumed.\n\nLet <math>c_t</math> be consumption in period {{mvar|t}}, and assume consumption yields [[utility]] <math>u(c_t)=\\ln(c_t)</math> as long as the consumer lives. Assume the consumer is impatient, so that he [[discounting|discounts]] future utility by a factor {{mvar|b}} each period, where <math>0<b<1</math>. Let <math>k_t</math> be [[capital (economics)|capital]] in period {{mvar|t}}. Assume initial capital is a given amount <math>k_0>0</math>, and suppose that this period's capital and consumption determine next period's capital as <math>k_{t+1}=Ak^a_t - c_t</math>, where {{mvar|A}} is a positive constant and <math>0<a<1</math>. Assume capital cannot be negative. Then the consumer's decision problem can be written as follows:\n\n: <math>\\max \\sum_{t=0}^T b^t \\ln(c_t)</math> subject to <math>k_{t+1}=Ak^a_t - c_t \\geq 0</math> for all <math>t=0,1,2,\\ldots,T</math>\n\nWritten this way, the problem looks complicated, because it involves solving for all the choice variables <math>c_0, c_1, c_2, \\ldots , c_T</math>. (The capital <math>k_0</math> is not a choice variable\u2014the consumer's initial capital is taken as given.)\n\nThe dynamic programming approach to solve this problem involves breaking it apart into a sequence of smaller decisions. To do so, we define a sequence of ''value functions'' <math>V_t(k)</math>, for <math>t=0,1,2,\\ldots,T,T+1</math> which represent the value of having any amount of capital {{mvar|k}} at each time {{mvar|t}}. There is (by assumption) no utility from having capital after death, <math>V_{T+1}(k)=0</math>.\n\nThe value of any quantity of capital at any previous time can be calculated by [[backward induction]] using the [[Bellman equation]]. In this problem, for each <math>t=0,1,2,\\ldots,T</math>, the Bellman equation is\n\n: <math>V_t(k_t) \\, = \\, \\max \\left( \\ln(c_t) + b V_{t+1}(k_{t+1}) \\right)</math> subject to <math>k_{t+1}=Ak^a_t - c_t \\geq 0</math>\n\nThis problem is much simpler than the one we wrote down before, because it involves only two decision variables, <math>c_t</math> and <math>k_{t+1}</math>. Intuitively, instead of choosing his whole lifetime plan at birth, the consumer can take things one step at a time. At time {{mvar|t}}, his current capital <math>k_t</math> is given, and he only needs to choose current consumption <math>c_t</math> and saving <math>k_{t+1}</math>.\n\nTo actually solve this problem, we work backwards. For simplicity, the current level of capital is denoted as {{mvar|k}}. <math>V_{T+1}(k)</math> is already known, so using the Bellman equation once we can calculate <math>V_T(k)</math>, and so on until we get to <math>V_0(k)</math>, which is the ''value'' of the initial decision problem for the whole lifetime. In other words, once we know <math>V_{T-j+1}(k)</math>, we can calculate <math>V_{T-j}(k)</math>, which is the maximum of <math>\\ln(c_{T-j}) + b V_{T-j+1}(Ak^a-c_{T-j})</math>, where <math>c_{T-j}</math> is the choice variable and <math>Ak^a-c_{T-j} \\ge 0</math>.\n\nWorking backwards, it can be shown that the value function at time <math>t=T-j</math> is\n\n: <math>V_{T-j}(k) \\, = \\, a \\sum_{i=0}^j a^ib^i \\ln k + v_{T-j}</math>\n\nwhere each <math>v_{T-j}</math> is a constant, and the optimal amount to consume at time <math>t=T-j</math> is\n\n: <math>c_{T-j}(k) \\, = \\, \\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=0}^j a^ib^i} Ak^a</math>\n\nwhich can be simplified to\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\nc_{T}(k) & = Ak^a\\\\\nc_{T-1}(k) & = \\frac{Ak^a}{1+ab}\\\\\nc_{T-2}(k) & = \\frac{Ak^a}{1+ab+a^2b^2}\\\\\n&\\dots\\\\\nc_2(k) & = \\frac{Ak^a}{1+ab+a^2b^2+\\ldots+a^{T-2}b^{T-2}}\\\\\nc_1(k) & = \\frac{Ak^a}{1+ab+a^2b^2+\\ldots+a^{T-2}b^{T-2}+a^{T-1}b^{T-1}}\\\\\nc_0(k) & = \\frac{Ak^a}{1+ab+a^2b^2+\\ldots+a^{T-2}b^{T-2}+a^{T-1}b^{T-1}+a^Tb^T}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nWe see that it is optimal to consume a larger fraction of current wealth as one gets older, finally consuming all remaining wealth in period {{mvar|T}}, the last period of life.\n\n=== Computer programming ===\nThere are two key attributes that a problem must have in order for dynamic programming to be applicable: [[optimal substructure]] and [[overlapping subproblem|overlapping sub-problem]]s. If a problem can be solved by combining optimal solutions to ''non-overlapping'' sub-problems, the strategy is called \"[[Divide and conquer algorithm|divide and conquer]]\" instead.<ref name=\":0\" />  This is why [[mergesort|merge sort]] and [[quicksort|quick sort]] are not classified as dynamic programming problems.\n\n''Optimal substructure'' means that the solution to a given optimization problem can be obtained by the combination of optimal solutions to its sub-problems. Such optimal substructures are usually described by means of [[recursion]]. For example, given a graph ''G=(V,E)'', the shortest path ''p'' from a vertex ''u'' to a vertex ''v'' exhibits optimal substructure: take any intermediate vertex ''w'' on this shortest path ''p''. If ''p'' is truly the shortest path, then it can be split into sub-paths ''p<sub>1</sub>'' from ''u'' to ''w'' and ''p<sub>2</sub>'' from ''w'' to ''v'' such that these, in turn, are indeed the shortest paths between the corresponding vertices (by the simple cut-and-paste argument described in ''[[Introduction to Algorithms]]''). Hence, one can easily formulate the solution for finding shortest paths in a recursive manner, which is what the [[Bellman\u2013Ford algorithm]] or the [[Floyd\u2013Warshall algorithm]] does.\n\n''Overlapping'' sub-problems means that the space of sub-problems must be small, that is, any recursive algorithm solving the problem should solve the same sub-problems over and over, rather than generating new sub-problems. For example, consider the recursive formulation for generating the Fibonacci series: ''F''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''F''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub> + ''F''<sub>''i''&minus;2</sub>, with base case ''F''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''F''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1. Then ''F''<sub>43</sub> =&nbsp;''F''<sub>42</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''F''<sub>41</sub>, and ''F''<sub>42</sub> =&nbsp;''F''<sub>41</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''F''<sub>40</sub>. Now ''F''<sub>41</sub> is being solved in the recursive sub-trees of both ''F''<sub>43</sub> as well as ''F''<sub>42</sub>. Even though the total number of sub-problems is actually small (only 43 of them), we end up solving the same problems over and over if we adopt a naive recursive solution such as this. Dynamic programming takes account of this fact and solves each sub-problem only once.\n\n[[Image:Fibonacci dynamic programming.svg|thumb|108px|'''Figure 2.''' The subproblem graph for the Fibonacci sequence. The fact that it is not a [[tree structure|tree]] indicates overlapping subproblems.]]\n\nThis can be achieved in either of two ways:{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\n* ''[[Top-down and bottom-up design|Top-down approach]]'': This is the direct fall-out of the recursive formulation of any problem. If the solution to any problem can be formulated recursively using the solution to its sub-problems, and if its sub-problems are overlapping, then one can easily [[memoize]] or store the solutions to the sub-problems in a table. Whenever we attempt to solve a new sub-problem, we first check the table to see if it is already solved. If a solution has been recorded, we can use it directly, otherwise we solve the sub-problem and add its solution to the table.\n* ''[[Top-down and bottom-up design|Bottom-up approach]]'': Once we formulate the solution to a problem recursively as in terms of its sub-problems, we can try reformulating the problem in a bottom-up fashion: try solving the sub-problems first and use their solutions to build-on and arrive at solutions to bigger sub-problems. This is also usually done in a tabular form by iteratively generating solutions to bigger and bigger sub-problems by using the solutions to small sub-problems. For example, if we already know the values of ''F''<sub>41</sub> and ''F''<sub>40</sub>, we can directly calculate the value of ''F''<sub>42</sub>.\n\nSome [[programming language]]s can automatically [[memoization|memoize]] the result of a function call with a particular set of arguments, in order to speed up [[call-by-name]] evaluation (this mechanism is referred to as ''[[call-by-need]]''). Some languages make it possible portably (e.g. [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], [[Common Lisp]], [[Perl]] or [[D (programming language)|D]]). Some languages have automatic [[memoization]] <!-- still not a typo for \"memor-\" --> built in, such as tabled [[Prolog]] and [[J (programming language)|J]], which supports memoization with the ''M.'' adverb.<ref>{{cite web|title=M. Memo|url=http://www.jsoftware.com/help/dictionary/dmcapdot.htm|work=J Vocabulary|publisher=J Software|accessdate=28 October 2011}}</ref> In any case, this is only possible for a [[referentially transparent]] function. Memoization is also encountered as an easily accessible design pattern within term-rewrite based languages such as [[Wolfram Language]].\n\n=== Bioinformatics ===\nDynamic programming is widely used in bioinformatics for the tasks such as [[sequence alignment]], [[protein folding]], RNA structure prediction and protein-DNA binding. The first dynamic programming algorithms for protein-DNA binding were developed in the 1970s independently by [[Charles DeLisi]] in USA<ref>DeLisi, Biopolymers, 1974, Volume 13, Issue 7, pages 1511\u20131512, July 1974</ref> and Georgii Gurskii and Alexander Zasedatelev in USSR.<ref>Gurski\u012d GV, Zasedatelev AS, Biofizika, 1978 Sep-Oct;23(5):932-46</ref> Recently these algorithms have become very popular in bioinformatics and computational biology, particularly in the studies of [[nucleosome]] positioning and [[transcription factor]] binding.\n\n== Examples: Computer algorithms ==\n\n=== Dijkstra's algorithm for the shortest path problem ===\nFrom a dynamic programming point of view, [[Dijkstra's algorithm]] for the [[shortest path problem]]  is a successive approximation scheme that solves the dynamic programming functional equation for the shortest path problem by the '''Reaching''' method.<ref name=sniedovich_06>{{Citation | last = Sniedovich | first = M. | title = Dijkstra's algorithm revisited: the dynamic programming connexion | journal = Journal of Control and Cybernetics | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 599\u2013620 | year = 2006 | url = http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/cc/cc35/cc3536.pdf | postscript = .}} [http://www.ifors.ms.unimelb.edu.au/tutorial/dijkstra_new/index.html Online version of the paper with interactive computational modules.]</ref><ref name=denardo_03>{{Citation | last = Denardo | first = E.V. | title = Dynamic Programming: Models and Applications | publisher = [[Dover Publications]] | location = Mineola, NY | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-486-42810-9}}</ref><ref name=sniedovich_10>{{Citation | last = Sniedovich | first = M. | title = Dynamic Programming: Foundations and Principles | publisher = [[Taylor & Francis]] | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-0-8247-4099-3  }}</ref>\n\nIn fact, Dijkstra's explanation of the logic behind the algorithm,<ref>{{harvnb|Dijkstra|1959|p=270}}</ref> namely\n{{quote|\n'''Problem 2.'''

Here is a na\u00efve implementation, based directly on the mathematical definition:\n\n    '''function''' fib(n)\n        '''if''' n <= 1 '''return''' n\n        '''return''' fib(n \u2212 1) + fib(n \u2212 2)\n\nNotice that if we call, say, <code>fib(5)</code>, we produce a call tree that calls the function on the same value many different times:\n\n# <code>fib(5)</code>\n# <code>fib(4) + fib(3)</code>\n# <code>(fib(3) + fib(2)) + (fib(2) + fib(1))</code>\n# <code>((fib(2) + fib(1)) + (fib(1) + fib(0))) + ((fib(1) + fib(0)) + fib(1))</code>\n# <code>(((fib(1) + fib(0)) + fib(1)) + (fib(1) + fib(0))) + ((fib(1) + fib(0)) + fib(1))</code>\n\nIn particular, <code>fib(2)</code> was calculated three times from scratch. In larger examples, many more values of <code>fib</code>, or ''subproblems'', are recalculated, leading to an exponential time algorithm.\n\nNow, suppose we have a simple [[Associative array|map]] object, ''m'', which maps each value of <code>fib</code> that has already been calculated to its result, and we modify our function to use it and update it. The resulting function requires only [[Big-O notation|O]](''n'') time instead of exponential time (but requires [[Big-O notation|O]](''n'') space):\n\n    '''var''' m := '''''map'''''(0 \u2192 0, 1 \u2192 1)\n    '''function''' fib(n)\n        '''if ''key''''' n '''is not in ''map''''' m \n            m[n] := fib(n \u2212 1) + fib(n \u2212 2)\n        '''return''' m[n]\n\nThis technique of saving values that have already been calculated is called ''[[memoization]]''; <!-- Yes, memoization, not memorization. Not a typo. --> this is the top-down approach, since we first break the problem into subproblems and then calculate and store values.\n\nIn the '''bottom-up''' approach, we calculate the smaller values of <code>fib</code> first, then build larger values from them. This method also uses O(''n'') time since it contains a loop that repeats n \u2212 1 times, but it only takes constant (O(1)) space, in contrast to the top-down approach which requires O(''n'') space to store the map.\n\n    '''function''' fib(n)\n        '''if''' n = 0\n            '''return''' 0\n        '''else'''\n            '''var''' previousFib := 0, currentFib := 1\n            '''repeat''' n \u2212 1 '''times''' ''// loop is skipped if n = 1''\n                '''var''' newFib := previousFib + currentFib\n                previousFib := currentFib\n                currentFib  := newFib\n        '''return''' currentFib\n\nIn both examples, we only calculate <code>fib(2)</code> one time, and then use it to calculate both <code>fib(4)</code> and <code>fib(3)</code>, instead of computing it every time either of them is evaluated.\n\nThe above method actually takes <math>\\Omega(n^2)</math> time for large n because addition of two integers with <math>\\Omega(n)</math> bits each takes <math>\\Omega(n)</math> time. (The ''n''<sup>th</sup> fibonacci number has <math>\\Omega(n)</math> bits.) Also, there is a closed form for the Fibonacci sequence, [[Jacques Philippe Marie Binet#Binet's Fibonacci number formula|known as Binet's formula]], from which the <math>n</math>-th term can be [[Computational complexity of mathematical operations|computed]] in approximately <math>O(n(\\log n)^2)</math> time, which is more efficient than the above dynamic programming technique. However, the simple recurrence directly gives [[Fibonacci sequence#Matrix form|the matrix form]] that leads to an approximately <math>O(n\\log n)</math> algorithm by fast [[matrix exponentiation]].\n\n=== A type of balanced 0\u20131 matrix ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\nConsider the problem of assigning values, either zero or one, to the positions of an {{math|<var>n</var> &times; <var>n</var>}} matrix, with {{math|<var>n</var>}} even, so that each row and each column contains exactly {{math|<var>n</var> / 2}} zeros and {{math|<var>n</var> / 2}} ones. We ask how many different assignments there are for a given <math>n</math>. For example, when {{math|<var>n</var> {{=}} 4}}, four possible solutions are\n\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix} \\text{ and } \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix} \\text{ and } \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix} \\text{ and } \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nThere are at least three possible approaches: [[Brute-force search|brute force]], [[backtracking]], and dynamic programming.\n\nBrute force consists of checking all assignments of zeros and ones and counting those that have balanced rows and columns ({{math|<var>n</var> / 2}} zeros and {{math|<var>n</var> / 2}} ones). As there are <math>\\tbinom{n}{n/2}^n</math> possible assignments, this strategy is not practical except maybe up to <math>n=6</math>.\n\nBacktracking for this problem consists of choosing some order of the matrix elements and recursively placing ones or zeros, while checking that in every row and column the number of elements that have not been assigned plus the number of ones or zeros are both at least {{math|<var>n</var> / 2}}. While more sophisticated than brute force, this approach will visit every solution once, making it impractical for {{math|<var>n</var>}} larger than six, since the number of solutions is already 116,963,796,250 for {{math|<var>n</var>}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;8, as we shall see.\n\nDynamic programming makes it possible to count the number of solutions without visiting them all. Imagine backtracking values for the first row \u2013 what information would we require about the remaining rows, in order to be able to accurately count the solutions obtained for each first row value? We consider {{math|<var>k</var> &times; <var>n</var>}} boards, where {{math|1 &le; <var>k</var> &le; <var>n</var>}}, whose <math>k</math> rows contain <math>n/2</math> zeros and <math>n/2</math> ones. The function ''f'' to which [[memoization]] is applied maps vectors of ''n'' pairs of integers to the number of admissible boards (solutions). There is one pair for each column, and its two components indicate respectively the number of zeros and ones that have yet to be placed in that column. We seek the value of <math> f((n/2, n/2), (n/2, n/2), \\ldots (n/2, n/2)) </math> (<math>n</math> arguments or one vector of <math>n</math> elements). The process of subproblem creation involves iterating over every one of  <math>\\tbinom{n}{n/2}</math> possible assignments for the top row of the board, and going through every column, subtracting one from the appropriate element of the pair for that column, depending on whether the assignment for the top row contained a zero or a one at that position. If any one of the results is negative, then the assignment is invalid and does not contribute to the set of solutions (recursion stops). Otherwise, we have an assignment for the top row of the {{math|<var>k</var> &times; <var>n</var>}} board and recursively compute the number of solutions to the remaining {{math|(<var>k</var> &minus; 1) &times; <var>n</var>}} board, adding the numbers of solutions for every admissible assignment of the top row and returning the sum, which is being memoized. The base case is the trivial subproblem, which occurs for a {{math|1 &times; <var>n</var>}} board. The number of solutions for this board is either zero or one, depending on whether the vector is a permutation of {{math|<var>n</var> / 2}} <math>(0, 1)</math> and {{math|<var>n</var> / 2}} <math>(1, 0)</math> pairs or not.\n\nFor example, in the first two boards shown above the sequences of vectors would be\n<PRE WIDTH=80>\n((2, 2) (2, 2) (2, 2) (2, 2))       ((2, 2) (2, 2) (2, 2) (2, 2))     k = 4\n  0      1      0      1              0      0      1      1\n\n((1, 2) (2, 1) (1, 2) (2, 1))       ((1, 2) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 1))     k = 3\n  1      0      1      0              0      0      1      1\n\n((1, 1) (1, 1) (1, 1) (1, 1))       ((0, 2) (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 0))     k = 2\n  0      1      0      1              1      1      0      0\n\n((0, 1) (1, 0) (0, 1) (1, 0))       ((0, 1) (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 0))     k = 1\n  1      0      1      0              1      1      0      0\n\n((0, 0) (0, 0) (0, 0) (0, 0))       ((0, 0) (0, 0), (0, 0) (0, 0))\n</PRE>\n\nThe number of solutions {{OEIS|id=A058527}} is\n\n:<math> 1,\\, 2,\\,  90,\\, 297200,\\, 116963796250,\\, 6736218287430460752, \\ldots </math>\n\nLinks to the MAPLE implementation of the dynamic programming approach may be found among the [[Dynamic programming#External links|external links]].\n\n=== Checkerboard ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\nConsider a [[checkerboard]] with ''n'' \u00d7 ''n'' squares and a cost function <code>c(i, j)</code> which returns a cost associated with square <code>(i,j)</code> (<code>''i''</code> being the row, <code>''j''</code> being the column). For instance (on a 5 \u00d7 5 checkerboard),\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! 5\n| 6 || 7 || 4 || 7 || 8\n|-\n! 4\n| 7 || 6 || 1 || 1 || 4\n|-\n! 3\n| 3 || 5 || 7 || 8 || 2\n|-\n! 2\n| \u2013 || 6 || 7 || 0 || \u2013\n|-\n! 1\n| \u2013 || \u2013 || *5* || \u2013 || \u2013\n|-\n!width=\"15\"| !! style=\"width:15px;\"|1 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|2 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|3 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|4 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|5\n|}\nThus <code>c(1, 3) = 5</code>\n\nLet us say there was a checker that could start at any square on the first rank (i.e., row) and you wanted to know the shortest path (the sum of the minimum costs at each visited rank) to get to the last rank; assuming the checker could move only diagonally left forward, diagonally right forward, or straight forward. That is, a checker on <code>(1,3)</code> can move to <code>(2,2)</code>, <code>(2,3)</code> or <code>(2,4)</code>.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! 5\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n! 4\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n! 3\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n! 2\n|  || x  || x || x ||\n|-\n! 1\n|  ||  || o ||  ||\n|-\n!width=\"15\"| !! style=\"width:15px;\"|1 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|2 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|3 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|4 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|5\n|}\n\nThis problem exhibits '''optimal substructure'''. That is, the solution to the entire problem relies on solutions to subproblems. Let us define a function <code>q(i, j)</code> as\n\n:''q''(''i'', ''j'') = the minimum cost to reach square (''i'', ''j'').\n\nStarting at rank <code>n</code> and descending to rank <code>1</code>, we compute the value of this function for all the squares at each successive rank. Picking the square that holds the minimum value at each rank gives us the shortest path between rank <code>n</code> and rank <code>1</code>.\n\nThe function <code>q(i, j)</code> is equal to the minimum cost to get to any of the three squares below it (since those are the only squares that can reach it) plus <code>c(i, j)</code>. For instance:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! 5\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n! 4\n|  ||  || A  ||  ||\n|-\n! 3\n|  || B || C || D ||\n|-\n! 2\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n! 1\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n!width=\"15\"| !! style=\"width:15px;\"|1 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|2 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|3 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|4 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|5\n|}\n\n: <math>q(A) = \\min(q(B),q(C),q(D))+c(A) \\, </math>\n\nNow, let us define <code>q(i, j)</code> in somewhat more general terms:\n\n: <math>q(i,j)=\\begin{cases} \\infty & j < 1 \\text{ or }j > n \\\\ c(i, j) & i = 1 \\\\ \\min(q(i-1, j-1), q(i-1, j), q(i-1, j+1)) + c(i,j) & \\text{otherwise.}\\end{cases}</math>\n\nThe first line of this equation deals with a board modeled as squares indexed on <code>1</code> at the lowest bound and <code>n</code> at the highest bound. The second line specifies what happens at the last rank; providing a base case. The third line, the recursion, is the important part. It represents the <code>A,B,C,D</code> terms in the example. From this definition we can derive straightforward recursive code for <code>q(i,\u00a0j)</code>. In the following pseudocode, <code>n</code> is the size of the board, <code>c(i, j)</code> is the cost function, and <code>min()</code> returns the minimum of a number of values:\n\n '''function''' minCost(i, j)\n     '''if''' j &lt; 1 '''or''' j > n\n         '''return''' infinity\n     '''else if''' i = 1\n         '''return''' c(i, j)\n     '''else'''\n         '''return''' '''min'''( minCost(i-1, j-1), minCost(i-1, j), minCost(i-1, j+1) ) + c(i, j)\n\nThis function only computes the path cost, not the actual path. We discuss the actual path below. This, like the Fibonacci-numbers example, is horribly slow because it too exhibits the '''overlapping sub-problems''' attribute. That is, it recomputes the same path costs over and over. However, we can compute it much faster in a bottom-up fashion if we store path costs in a two-dimensional array <code>q[i, j]</code> rather than using a function. This avoids recomputation; all the values needed for array <code>q[i, j]</code> are computed ahead of time only once. Precomputed values for <code>(i,j)</code> are simply looked-up whenever needed.\n\nWe also need to know what the actual shortest path is. To do this, we use another array <code>p[i, j]</code>; a ''predecessor array''. This array records the path to any square <code>s</code>. The predecessor of <code>s</code> is modeled as an offset relative to the index (in <code>q[i, j]</code>) of the precomputed path cost of <code>s</code>. To reconstruct the complete path, we lookup the predecessor of <code>s</code>, then the predecessor of that square, then the predecessor of that square, and so on recursively, until we reach the starting square. Consider the following code:\n\n  '''function''' computeShortestPathArrays()\n      '''for''' x '''from''' 1 '''to''' n\n          q[1, x] := c(1, x)\n      '''for''' y '''from''' 1 '''to''' n\n          q[y, 0]     := infinity\n          q[y, n + 1] := infinity\n      '''for''' y '''from''' 2 '''to''' n\n          '''for''' x '''from''' 1 '''to''' n\n              m := min(q[y-1, x-1], q[y-1, x], q[y-1, x+1])\n              q[y, x] := m + c(y, x)\n              '''if''' m = q[y-1, x-1]\n                  p[y, x] := -1\n              '''else if''' m = q[y-1, x]\n                  p[y, x] :=  0\n              '''else'''\n                  p[y, x] :=  1\n\nNow the rest is a simple matter of finding the minimum and printing it.\n\n  '''function''' computeShortestPath()\n      computeShortestPathArrays()\n      minIndex := 1\n      min := q[n, 1]\n      '''for''' i '''from''' 2 '''to''' n\n          '''if''' q[n, i] &lt; min\n              minIndex := i\n              min := q[n, i]\n      printPath(n, minIndex)\n\n  '''function''' printPath(y, x)\n      '''print'''(x)\n      '''print'''(\"&lt;-\")\n      '''if''' y = 2\n          '''print'''(x + p[y, x])\n      '''else'''\n          printPath(y-1, x + p[y, x])\n\n=== Sequence alignment ===\nIn [[genetics]], [[sequence alignment]] is an important application where dynamic programming is essential.<ref name=\"Eddy\"/>  Typically, the problem consists of transforming one sequence into another using edit operations that replace, insert, or remove an element.  Each operation has an associated cost, and the goal is to find the [[edit distance|sequence of edits with the lowest total cost]].\n\nThe problem can be stated naturally as a recursion, a sequence A is optimally edited into a sequence B by either:\n\n# inserting the first character of B, and performing an optimal alignment of A and the tail of B\n# deleting the first character of A, and performing the optimal alignment of the tail of A and B\n# replacing the first character of A with the first character of B, and performing optimal alignments of the tails of A and B.\n\nThe partial alignments can be tabulated in a matrix, where cell (i,j) contains the cost of the optimal alignment of A[1..i] to B[1..j].  The cost in cell (i,j) can be calculated by adding the cost of the relevant operations to the cost of its neighboring cells, and selecting the optimum.\n\nDifferent variants exist, see [[Smith\u2013Waterman algorithm]] and [[Needleman\u2013Wunsch algorithm]].\n\n=== Tower of Hanoi puzzle ===\n[[Image:Tower of Hanoi.jpeg|300px|thumb|A model set of the Towers of Hanoi (with 8 disks)]]\n[[Image:Tower of Hanoi 4.gif|300px|thumb|An animated solution of the '''Tower of Hanoi''' puzzle for ''T(4,3)''.]]\nThe '''[[Tower of Hanoi]]''' or '''Towers of [[Hanoi]]''' is a [[mathematical game]] or [[puzzle]]. It consists of three rods, and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.\n\nThe objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following rules:\n\n* Only one disk may be moved at a time.\n* Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and sliding it onto another rod, on top of the other disks that may already be present on that rod.\n* No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n\nThe dynamic programming solution consists of solving the [[Bellman equation|functional equation]]\n\n: S(n,h,t) = S(n-1,h, not(h,t)) ; S(1,h,t) ; S(n-1,not(h,t),t)\n\nwhere n denotes the number of disks to be moved, h denotes the home rod, t denotes the target rod, not(h,t) denotes the third rod (neither h nor t), \";\" denotes concatenation, and\n\n: S(n, h, t) := solution to a problem consisting of n disks that are to be moved from rod h to rod t.\n\nFor n=1 the problem is trivial, namely S(1,h,t) = \"move a disk from rod h to rod t\" (there is only one disk left).\n\nThe  number of moves required by this solution is 2<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1. If the objective is to '''maximize''' the number of moves (without cycling) then the dynamic programming [[Bellman equation|functional equation]]  is slightly more complicated and  3<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 moves are required.<ref>{{Citation |author=Moshe Sniedovich |title= OR/MS Games: 2.

We make a few assumptions:\n\n:* An egg that survives a fall can be used again.\n:* A broken egg must be discarded.\n:* The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs.\n:* If an egg breaks when dropped, then it would break if dropped from a higher window.\n:* If an egg survives a fall, then it would survive a shorter fall.\n:* It is not ruled out that the first-floor windows break eggs, nor is it ruled out that eggs can survive the 36th-floor windows.\n\n: If only one egg is available and we wish to be sure of obtaining the right result, the experiment can be carried out in only one way. Drop the egg from the first-floor window; if it survives, drop it from the second-floor window. Continue upward until it breaks. In the worst case, this method may require 36 droppings. Suppose 2 eggs are available. What is the lowest number of egg-droppings that is guaranteed to work in all cases?\n\nTo derive a dynamic programming [[Bellman equation|functional equation]] for this puzzle, let the '''state''' of the dynamic programming model be a pair s = (n,k), where\n\n: ''n'' = number of test eggs available, ''n'' = 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., ''N''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1.\n: ''k'' = number of (consecutive) floors yet to be tested, ''k'' = 0, 1, 2, ..., ''H''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1.\n\nFor instance, ''s'' = (2,6) indicates that two test eggs are available and 6 (consecutive) floors are yet to be tested. The initial state of the process is ''s'' = (''N'',''H'') where ''N'' denotes the number of test eggs available at the commencement of the experiment. The process terminates either when there are no more test eggs (''n'' = 0) or when ''k'' = 0, whichever occurs first.

Also, by storing the optimal <math>x</math> for each cell in the DP table and referring to its value for the previous cell, the optimal <math>x</math> for each cell can be found in constant time, improving it to <math>O( n k )</math> time.

For example,  engineering applications often have to multiply a chain of matrices. It is not surprising to find matrices of large dimensions, for example 100\u00d7100. Therefore, our task is to multiply matrices {{tmath|A_1, A_2, .... A_n}}. As we know from basic linear algebra, matrix multiplication is not commutative, but is associative; and we can multiply only two matrices at a time. So, we can multiply this chain of matrices in many different ways, for example:\n\n: {{math|((A<sub>1</sub> \u00d7 A<sub>2</sub>) \u00d7 A<sub>3</sub>) \u00d7 ... A<sub>n</sub>}}\n\n: {{math|A<sub>1</sub>\u00d7(((A<sub>2</sub>\u00d7A<sub>3</sub>)\u00d7 ... ) \u00d7 A<sub>n</sub>)}}\n\n: {{math|(A<sub>1</sub> \u00d7 A<sub>2</sub>) \u00d7 (A<sub>3</sub> \u00d7 ... A<sub>n</sub>)}}\n\nand so on. There are numerous ways to multiply this chain of matrices. They will all produce the same final result, however they will take more or less time to compute, based on which particular matrices are multiplied. If matrix A has dimensions m\u00d7n and matrix B has dimensions n\u00d7q, then matrix C=A\u00d7B will have dimensions m\u00d7q, and will require m*n*q scalar multiplications (using a simplistic matrix multiplication algorithm for purposes of illustration).\n\nFor example, let us multiply matrices A, B and C. Let us assume that their dimensions are m\u00d7n, n\u00d7p, and p\u00d7s, respectively. Matrix A\u00d7B\u00d7C will be of size m\u00d7s and can be calculated in two ways shown below:\n\n# Ax(B\u00d7C)    This order of matrix multiplication will require nps + mns scalar multiplications.  \n# (A\u00d7B)\u00d7C    This order of matrix multiplication will require mnp + mps scalar calculations.\n\nLet us assume that m = 10, n = 100, p = 10 and s = 1000. So, the first way to multiply the chain will require 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 calculations. The second way will require only 10,000+100,000 calculations. Obviously, the second way is faster, and we should multiply the matrices using that arrangement of parenthesis.\n\nTherefore, our conclusion is that the order of parenthesis matters, and that our task is to find the optimal order of parenthesis.\n\nAt this point, we have several choices, one of which is to design a dynamic programming algorithm that will split the problem into overlapping problems and calculate the optimal arrangement of parenthesis. The dynamic programming solution is presented below.\n\nLet's call m[i,j] the minimum number of scalar multiplications needed to multiply a chain of matrices from matrix i to matrix j (i.e. A<sub>i</sub> \u00d7 .... \u00d7 A<sub>j</sub>, i.e. i<=j). We split the chain at some matrix k, such that i <= k < j, and try to find out which combination produces minimum m[i,j].\n\nThe formula is:\n\n        '''if''' i = j, m[i,j]= 0\n        '''if''' i < j, m[i,j]= min over all possible values of k {{nowrap|(m[i,k]+m[k+1,j] + <math>p_{i-1}*p_k*p_j</math>)}} \nwhere ''k'' ranges from ''i'' to ''j''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1.\n\n*{{tmath|p_{{(}}i-1{{)}}}} is the row dimension of matrix i,\n*{{tmath|p_k}} is the column dimension of matrix k,\n*{{tmath|p_j}} is the column dimension of matrix j.\n\nThis formula can be coded as shown below, where input parameter \"chain\" is the chain of matrices, i.e. {{tmath|A_1, A_2, ... A_n}}:\n\n  '''function''' OptimalMatrixChainParenthesis(chain)\n      n = length(chain)\n      '''for''' i = 1, n\n          m[i,i] = 0    ''// Since it takes no calculations to multiply one matrix''\n      '''for''' len = 2, n\n          '''for''' i = 1, n - len + 1\n              j = i + len -1\n              m[i,j] = infinity      ''// So that the first calculation updates''\n              '''for''' k = i, j-1\n                  {{nowrap|1=q = m[i, k] + m[k+1, j] + <math>p_{i-1}*p_k*p_j</math>}}\n                  '''if''' q < m[i, j]     ''// The new order of parentheses is better than what we had''\n                      m[i, j] = q    ''// Update''\n                      s[i, j] = k    ''// Record which k to split on, i.e. where to place the parenthesis''\n\nSo far, we have calculated values for all possible {{math|''m''[''i'', ''j'']}}, the minimum number of calculations to multiply a chain from matrix ''i'' to matrix ''j'', and we have recorded the corresponding \"split point\"{{math|''s''[''i'', ''j'']}}. For example, if we are multiplying chain {{math|A<sub>1</sub>\u00d7A<sub>2</sub>\u00d7A<sub>3</sub>\u00d7A<sub>4</sub>}}, and it turns out that {{math|1=''m''[1, 3] = 100}} and {{math|1=''s''[1, 3] = 2}}, that means that the optimal placement of parenthesis for matrices 1 to 3 is {{tmath|(A_1\\times A_2)\\times A_3}} and to multiply those matrices will require 100 scalar calculation.\n\nThis algorithm will produce \"tables\" ''m''[, ] and ''s''[, ] that will have entries for all possible values of i and j. The final solution for the entire chain is m[1, n], with corresponding split at s[1, n]. Unraveling the solution will be recursive, starting from the top and continuing until we reach the base case, i.e. multiplication of single matrices.\n\nTherefore, the next step is to actually split the chain, i.e. to place the parenthesis where they (optimally) belong. For this purpose we could use the following algorithm:\n\n  '''function''' PrintOptimalParenthesis(s, i, j)\n      '''if''' i = j\n         print \"A\"i\n      '''else'''\n         print \"(\" PrintOptimalParenthesis(s, i, s[i, j]) PrintOptimalParenthesis(s, s[i, j] + 1, j) \")\"\n\nOf course, this algorithm is not useful for actual multiplication. This algorithm is just a user-friendly way to see what the result looks like.\n\nTo actually multiply the matrices using the proper splits, we need the following algorithm:\n<source lang=\"javascript\" enclose=\"div\">\n   function MatrixChainMultiply(chain from 1 to n)       // returns the final matrix, i.e. A1\u00d7A2\u00d7... \u00d7An\n      OptimalMatrixChainParenthesis(chain from 1 to n)   // this will produce s[ . ] and m[ . ] \"tables\"\n      OptimalMatrixMultiplication(s, chain from 1 to n)  // actually multiply\n\n   function OptimalMatrixMultiplication(s, i, j)   // returns the result of multiplying a chain of matrices from Ai to Aj in optimal way\n      if i < j\n         // keep on splitting the chain and multiplying the matrices in left and right sides\n         LeftSide = OptimalMatrixMultiplication(s, i, s[i, j])\n         RightSide = OptimalMatrixMultiplication(s, s[i, j] + 1, j)\n         return MatrixMultiply(LeftSide, RightSide) \n      else if i = j\n         return Ai   // matrix at position i\n      else \n         print \"error, i <= j must hold\"\n\n    function MatrixMultiply(A, B)    // function that multiplies two matrices\n      if columns(A) = rows(B) \n         for i = 1, rows(A)\n            for j = 1, columns(B)\n               C[i, j] = 0\n               for k = 1, columns(A)\n                   C[i, j] = C[i, j] + A[i, k]*B[k, j] \n               return C \n      else \n          print \"error, incompatible dimensions.\"\n</source>\n\n== History ==\nThe term ''dynamic programming'' was originally used in the 1940s by [[Richard Bellman]] to describe the process of solving problems where one needs to find the best decisions one after another.  By 1953, he refined this to the modern meaning, referring specifically to nesting smaller decision problems inside larger decisions,<ref>Stuart Dreyfus. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050110161049/http://www.wu-wien.ac.at/usr/h99c/h9951826/bellman_dynprog.pdf \"Richard Bellman on the birth of Dynamical Programming\"].</ref>  and the field was thereafter recognized by the [[IEEE]] as a [[systems analysis]] and [[engineering]] topic.  Bellman's contribution is remembered in the name of the [[Bellman equation]], a central result of dynamic programming which restates an optimization problem in [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]] form.\n\nBellman explains the reasoning behind the term ''dynamic programming'' in his autobiography, ''Eye of the Hurricane: An Autobiography'':\n\n{{Quote\n|text=I spent the Fall quarter (of 1950) at RAND. My first task was to find a name for multistage decision processes. An interesting question is, Where did the name, dynamic programming, come from? The 1950s were not good years for mathematical research. We had a very interesting gentleman in Washington named [[Charles Erwin Wilson|Wilson]]. He was Secretary of Defense, and he actually had a pathological fear and hatred of the word research. I\u2019m not using the term lightly; I\u2019m using it precisely. His face would suffuse, he would turn red, and he would get violent if people used the term research in his presence. You can imagine how he felt, then, about the term mathematical. The RAND Corporation was employed by the Air Force, and the Air Force had Wilson as its boss, essentially. Hence, I felt I had to do something to shield Wilson and the Air Force from the fact that I was really doing mathematics inside the RAND Corporation. What title, what name, could I choose? In the first place I was interested in planning, in decision making, in thinking. But planning, is not a good word for various reasons. I decided therefore to use the word \"programming\". I wanted to get across the idea that this was dynamic, this was multistage, this was time-varying. I thought, let's kill two birds with one stone. Let's take a word that has an absolutely precise meaning, namely dynamic, in the classical physical sense. It also has a very interesting property as an adjective, and that is it's impossible to use the word dynamic in a pejorative sense. Try thinking of some combination that will possibly give it a pejorative meaning. It's impossible. Thus, I thought dynamic programming was a good name. It was something not even a Congressman could object to. So I used it as an umbrella for my activities.\n|author=Richard Bellman\n|source=''Eye of the Hurricane: An Autobiography'' (1984, page 159)\n}}\n\nThe word ''dynamic'' was chosen by Bellman to capture the time-varying aspect of the problems, and because it sounded impressive.<ref name=\"Eddy\">{{cite journal |last=Eddy |first=S.

J. |title=Numerical Optimization |page=9 |publisher=Springer |year=2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe above explanation of the origin of the term is lacking. As Russell and Norvig in their book have written, referring to the above story: \"This cannot be strictly true, because his first paper using the term (Bellman, 1952) appeared before Wilson became Secretary of Defense in 1953.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Russell |first=S. |last2=Norvig |first2=P. |title=Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach |edition=3rd |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-13-207148-2 }}</ref> Also, there is a comment in a speech by [http://a2c2.org/awards/richard-e-bellman-control-heritage-award/2004-00-00t000000/harold-j-kushner Harold J. Kushner], where he remembers Bellman. Quoting Kushner as he speaks of Bellman: \"On the other hand, when I asked him the same question, he replied that he was trying to upstage Dantzig's linear programming by adding dynamic. Perhaps both motivations were true.\"\n\n== Algorithms that use dynamic programming ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\n* Recurrent solutions to [[lattice models]] for protein-DNA binding\n* [[Backward induction]] as a solution method for finite-horizon [[discrete-time]] dynamic optimization problems\n* [[Method of undetermined coefficients]] can be used to solve the [[Bellman equation]] in infinite-horizon, discrete-time, [[discounting|discounted]], [[Time-invariant system|time-invariant]] dynamic optimization problems\n* Many [[String (computer science)|string]] algorithms including [[longest common subsequence problem|longest common subsequence]], [[Longest increasing subsequence problem|longest increasing subsequence]], [[Longest common substring problem|longest common substring]], [[Levenshtein distance]] (edit distance)\n* Many algorithmic problems on [[undirected graph|graphs]] can be solved efficiently for graphs of bounded [[treewidth]] or bounded [[clique-width]] by using dynamic programming on a [[tree decomposition]] of the graph.\n* The [[CYK algorithm|Cocke\u2013Younger\u2013Kasami (CYK) algorithm]] which determines whether and how a given string can be generated by a given [[context-free grammar]]\n* [[Word wrap|Knuth's word wrapping algorithm]] that minimizes raggedness when word wrapping text\n* The use of [[transposition table]]s and [[refutation table]]s in [[computer chess]]\n* The [[Viterbi algorithm]] (used for [[hidden Markov model]]s, and particularly in [[part of speech tagging]])\n* The [[Earley algorithm]] (a type of [[chart parser]])\n* The [[Needleman\u2013Wunsch algorithm]] and other algorithms used in [[bioinformatics]], including [[sequence alignment]], [[structural alignment]], [[RNA structure|RNA structure prediction]]\n* [[Floyd\u2013Warshall algorithm|Floyd's all-pairs shortest path algorithm]]\n* Optimizing the order for [[chain matrix multiplication]]\n* [[Pseudo-polynomial time]] algorithms for the [[subset sum problem|subset sum]], [[Knapsack problem|knapsack]] and [[Partition problem|partition]] problems\n* The [[dynamic time warping]] algorithm for computing the global distance between two time series\n* The [[Patricia Selinger|Selinger]] (a.k.a.

The method was developed by [[Richard Bellman]] in the 1950s and has found applications in numerous fields, from [[aerospace engineering]] to [[economics]]. In both contexts it refers to simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a [[Recursion|recursive]] manner. While some decision problems cannot be taken apart this way, decisions that span several points in time do often break apart recursively. Likewise, in computer science, if a problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then recursively finding the optimal solutions to the sub-problems, then it is said to have [[optimal substructure]].\n\nIf sub-problems can be nested recursively inside larger problems, so that dynamic programming methods are applicable, then there is a relation between the value of the larger problem and the values of the sub-problems.<ref name=\":0\">Cormen, T. H.; Leiserson, C. E.; Rivest, R. L.; Stein, C. (2001), Introduction to Algorithms (2nd ed.), MIT Press & McGraw\u2013Hill, {{ISBN|0-262-03293-7}} . pp. 344.</ref> In the optimization literature this relationship is called the [[Bellman equation]].\n\n== Overview ==\n\n=== Mathematical optimization ===\nIn terms of mathematical optimization, dynamic programming usually refers to simplifying a decision by breaking it down into a sequence of decision steps over time. This is done by defining a sequence of '''value functions''' ''V''<sub>1</sub>, ''V''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''V''<sub>''n''</sub> taking ''y'' as an argument representing the '''[[State variable|state]]''' of the system at times ''i'' from 1 to ''n''. The definition of ''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''y'') is the value obtained in state ''y'' at the last time ''n''. The values ''V''<sub>''i''</sub> at earlier times ''i''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;&minus;1,&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;2,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;1 can be found by working backwards, using a [[Recursion|recursive]] relationship called the [[Bellman equation]]. For ''i''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''n'', ''V''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub> at any state ''y'' is calculated from ''V''<sub>''i''</sub> by maximizing a simple function (usually the sum) of the gain from a decision at time ''i''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 and the function ''V''<sub>''i''</sub> at the new state of the system if this decision is made. Since ''V''<sub>''i''</sub> has already been calculated for the needed states, the above operation yields ''V''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub> for those states. Finally, ''V''<sub>1</sub> at the initial state of the system is the value of the optimal solution. The optimal values of the decision variables can be recovered, one by one, by tracking back the calculations already performed.\n\n=== Control theory ===\nIn [[control theory]], a typical problem is to find an admissible control <math>\\mathbf{u}^{\\ast}</math> which causes the system <math>\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t) = \\mathbf{g} \\left( \\mathbf{x}(t), \\mathbf{u}(t), t \\right)</math> to follow an admissible trajectory <math>\\mathbf{x}^{\\ast}</math> on a continuous time interval <math>t_{0} \\leq t \\leq t_{1}</math> that minimizes a [[Loss function|cost function]]\n:<math>J = b \\left( \\mathbf{x}(t_{1}), t_{1} \\right) + \\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}} f \\left( \\mathbf{x}(t), \\mathbf{u}(t), t \\right) \\mathrm{d} t</math> \nThe solution to this problem is an optimal control law or policy <math>\\mathbf{u}^{\\ast} = h(\\mathbf{x}(t), t)</math>, which produces an optimal trajectory <math>\\mathbf{x}^{\\ast}</math> and an optimized loss function <math>J^{\\ast}</math>. The latter obeys the fundamental equation of dynamic programming:\n:<math>- J_{t}^{\\ast} = \\min_{\\mathbf{u}} \\left\\{ f \\left( \\mathbf{x}(t), \\mathbf{u}(t), t \\right) + J_{x}^{\\ast \\mathsf{T}} \\mathbf{g} \\left( \\mathbf{x}(t), \\mathbf{u}(t), t \\right) \\right\\}</math>\na [[partial differential equation]] known as the [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\u2013Bellman equation]], in which <math>J_{x}^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\partial J^{\\ast}}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}} = \\left[ \\frac{\\partial J^{\\ast}}{\\partial x_{1}} ~~~~ \\frac{\\partial J^{\\ast}}{\\partial x_{2}} ~~~~ \\dots ~~~~  \\frac{\\partial J^{\\ast}}{\\partial x_{n}} \\right]^{\\mathsf{T}}</math> and <math>J_{t}^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\partial J^{\\ast}}{\\partial t}</math>. One finds the minimizing <math>\\mathbf{u}</math> in terms of <math>t</math>, <math>\\mathbf{x}</math>, and the unknown function <math>J_{x}^{\\ast}</math> and then substitutes the result into the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\u2013Bellman equation to get the partial differential equation to be solved with boundary condition <math>J \\left( t_{1} \\right) = b \\left( \\mathbf{x}(t_{1}), t_{1} \\right)</math>.<ref>{{cite book |first=M.

In Ramsey's problem, this function relates amounts of consumption to levels of [[utility]]. Loosely speaking, the planner faces the trade-off between contemporaneous consumption and future consumption (via investment in [[Physical capital|capital stock]] that is used in production), known as [[intertemporal choice]]. Future consumption is discounted at a constant rate <math>\\beta \\in (0,1)</math>. A discrete approximation to the transition equation of capital is given by\n:<math>k_{t+1} = \\hat{g} \\left( k_{t}, c_{t} \\right) = f(k_{t}) - c_{t}</math>\nwhere <math>c</math> is consumption, <math>k</math> is capital, and <math>f</math> is a [[production function]] satisfying the [[Inada conditions]]. An initial capital stock <math>k_{0} > 0</math> is assumed.\n\nLet <math>c_t</math> be consumption in period {{mvar|t}}, and assume consumption yields [[utility]] <math>u(c_t)=\\ln(c_t)</math> as long as the consumer lives. Assume the consumer is impatient, so that he [[discounting|discounts]] future utility by a factor {{mvar|b}} each period, where <math>0<b<1</math>. Let <math>k_t</math> be [[capital (economics)|capital]] in period {{mvar|t}}. Assume initial capital is a given amount <math>k_0>0</math>, and suppose that this period's capital and consumption determine next period's capital as <math>k_{t+1}=Ak^a_t - c_t</math>, where {{mvar|A}} is a positive constant and <math>0<a<1</math>. Assume capital cannot be negative. Then the consumer's decision problem can be written as follows:\n\n: <math>\\max \\sum_{t=0}^T b^t \\ln(c_t)</math> subject to <math>k_{t+1}=Ak^a_t - c_t \\geq 0</math> for all <math>t=0,1,2,\\ldots,T</math>\n\nWritten this way, the problem looks complicated, because it involves solving for all the choice variables <math>c_0, c_1, c_2, \\ldots , c_T</math>. (The capital <math>k_0</math> is not a choice variable\u2014the consumer's initial capital is taken as given.)\n\nThe dynamic programming approach to solve this problem involves breaking it apart into a sequence of smaller decisions. To do so, we define a sequence of ''value functions'' <math>V_t(k)</math>, for <math>t=0,1,2,\\ldots,T,T+1</math> which represent the value of having any amount of capital {{mvar|k}} at each time {{mvar|t}}. There is (by assumption) no utility from having capital after death, <math>V_{T+1}(k)=0</math>.\n\nThe value of any quantity of capital at any previous time can be calculated by [[backward induction]] using the [[Bellman equation]]. In this problem, for each <math>t=0,1,2,\\ldots,T</math>, the Bellman equation is\n\n: <math>V_t(k_t) \\, = \\, \\max \\left( \\ln(c_t) + b V_{t+1}(k_{t+1}) \\right)</math> subject to <math>k_{t+1}=Ak^a_t - c_t \\geq 0</math>\n\nThis problem is much simpler than the one we wrote down before, because it involves only two decision variables, <math>c_t</math> and <math>k_{t+1}</math>. Intuitively, instead of choosing his whole lifetime plan at birth, the consumer can take things one step at a time. At time {{mvar|t}}, his current capital <math>k_t</math> is given, and he only needs to choose current consumption <math>c_t</math> and saving <math>k_{t+1}</math>.\n\nTo actually solve this problem, we work backwards. For simplicity, the current level of capital is denoted as {{mvar|k}}. <math>V_{T+1}(k)</math> is already known, so using the Bellman equation once we can calculate <math>V_T(k)</math>, and so on until we get to <math>V_0(k)</math>, which is the ''value'' of the initial decision problem for the whole lifetime. In other words, once we know <math>V_{T-j+1}(k)</math>, we can calculate <math>V_{T-j}(k)</math>, which is the maximum of <math>\\ln(c_{T-j}) + b V_{T-j+1}(Ak^a-c_{T-j})</math>, where <math>c_{T-j}</math> is the choice variable and <math>Ak^a-c_{T-j} \\ge 0</math>.\n\nWorking backwards, it can be shown that the value function at time <math>t=T-j</math> is\n\n: <math>V_{T-j}(k) \\, = \\, a \\sum_{i=0}^j a^ib^i \\ln k + v_{T-j}</math>\n\nwhere each <math>v_{T-j}</math> is a constant, and the optimal amount to consume at time <math>t=T-j</math> is\n\n: <math>c_{T-j}(k) \\, = \\, \\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=0}^j a^ib^i} Ak^a</math>\n\nwhich can be simplified to\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\nc_{T}(k) & = Ak^a\\\\\nc_{T-1}(k) & = \\frac{Ak^a}{1+ab}\\\\\nc_{T-2}(k) & = \\frac{Ak^a}{1+ab+a^2b^2}\\\\\n&\\dots\\\\\nc_2(k) & = \\frac{Ak^a}{1+ab+a^2b^2+\\ldots+a^{T-2}b^{T-2}}\\\\\nc_1(k) & = \\frac{Ak^a}{1+ab+a^2b^2+\\ldots+a^{T-2}b^{T-2}+a^{T-1}b^{T-1}}\\\\\nc_0(k) & = \\frac{Ak^a}{1+ab+a^2b^2+\\ldots+a^{T-2}b^{T-2}+a^{T-1}b^{T-1}+a^Tb^T}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nWe see that it is optimal to consume a larger fraction of current wealth as one gets older, finally consuming all remaining wealth in period {{mvar|T}}, the last period of life.\n\n=== Computer programming ===\nThere are two key attributes that a problem must have in order for dynamic programming to be applicable: [[optimal substructure]] and [[overlapping subproblem|overlapping sub-problem]]s. If a problem can be solved by combining optimal solutions to ''non-overlapping'' sub-problems, the strategy is called \"[[Divide and conquer algorithm|divide and conquer]]\" instead.<ref name=\":0\" />  This is why [[mergesort|merge sort]] and [[quicksort|quick sort]] are not classified as dynamic programming problems.\n\n''Optimal substructure'' means that the solution to a given optimization problem can be obtained by the combination of optimal solutions to its sub-problems. Such optimal substructures are usually described by means of [[recursion]]. For example, given a graph ''G=(V,E)'', the shortest path ''p'' from a vertex ''u'' to a vertex ''v'' exhibits optimal substructure: take any intermediate vertex ''w'' on this shortest path ''p''. If ''p'' is truly the shortest path, then it can be split into sub-paths ''p<sub>1</sub>'' from ''u'' to ''w'' and ''p<sub>2</sub>'' from ''w'' to ''v'' such that these, in turn, are indeed the shortest paths between the corresponding vertices (by the simple cut-and-paste argument described in ''[[Introduction to Algorithms]]''). Hence, one can easily formulate the solution for finding shortest paths in a recursive manner, which is what the [[Bellman\u2013Ford algorithm]] or the [[Floyd\u2013Warshall algorithm]] does.\n\n''Overlapping'' sub-problems means that the space of sub-problems must be small, that is, any recursive algorithm solving the problem should solve the same sub-problems over and over, rather than generating new sub-problems. For example, consider the recursive formulation for generating the Fibonacci series: ''F''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''F''<sub>''i''&minus;1</sub> + ''F''<sub>''i''&minus;2</sub>, with base case ''F''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''F''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1. Then ''F''<sub>43</sub> =&nbsp;''F''<sub>42</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''F''<sub>41</sub>, and ''F''<sub>42</sub> =&nbsp;''F''<sub>41</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''F''<sub>40</sub>. Now ''F''<sub>41</sub> is being solved in the recursive sub-trees of both ''F''<sub>43</sub> as well as ''F''<sub>42</sub>. Even though the total number of sub-problems is actually small (only 43 of them), we end up solving the same problems over and over if we adopt a naive recursive solution such as this. Dynamic programming takes account of this fact and solves each sub-problem only once.\n\n[[Image:Fibonacci dynamic programming.svg|thumb|108px|'''Figure 2.''' The subproblem graph for the Fibonacci sequence. The fact that it is not a [[tree structure|tree]] indicates overlapping subproblems.]]\n\nThis can be achieved in either of two ways:{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\n* ''[[Top-down and bottom-up design|Top-down approach]]'': This is the direct fall-out of the recursive formulation of any problem. If the solution to any problem can be formulated recursively using the solution to its sub-problems, and if its sub-problems are overlapping, then one can easily [[memoize]] or store the solutions to the sub-problems in a table. Whenever we attempt to solve a new sub-problem, we first check the table to see if it is already solved. If a solution has been recorded, we can use it directly, otherwise we solve the sub-problem and add its solution to the table.\n* ''[[Top-down and bottom-up design|Bottom-up approach]]'': Once we formulate the solution to a problem recursively as in terms of its sub-problems, we can try reformulating the problem in a bottom-up fashion: try solving the sub-problems first and use their solutions to build-on and arrive at solutions to bigger sub-problems. This is also usually done in a tabular form by iteratively generating solutions to bigger and bigger sub-problems by using the solutions to small sub-problems. For example, if we already know the values of ''F''<sub>41</sub> and ''F''<sub>40</sub>, we can directly calculate the value of ''F''<sub>42</sub>.\n\nSome [[programming language]]s can automatically [[memoization|memoize]] the result of a function call with a particular set of arguments, in order to speed up [[call-by-name]] evaluation (this mechanism is referred to as ''[[call-by-need]]''). Some languages make it possible portably (e.g. [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], [[Common Lisp]], [[Perl]] or [[D (programming language)|D]]). Some languages have automatic [[memoization]] <!-- still not a typo for \"memor-\" --> built in, such as tabled [[Prolog]] and [[J (programming language)|J]], which supports memoization with the ''M.'' adverb.<ref>{{cite web|title=M. Memo|url=http://www.jsoftware.com/help/dictionary/dmcapdot.htm|work=J Vocabulary|publisher=J Software|accessdate=28 October 2011}}</ref> In any case, this is only possible for a [[referentially transparent]] function. Memoization is also encountered as an easily accessible design pattern within term-rewrite based languages such as [[Wolfram Language]].\n\n=== Bioinformatics ===\nDynamic programming is widely used in bioinformatics for the tasks such as [[sequence alignment]], [[protein folding]], RNA structure prediction and protein-DNA binding. The first dynamic programming algorithms for protein-DNA binding were developed in the 1970s independently by [[Charles DeLisi]] in USA<ref>DeLisi, Biopolymers, 1974, Volume 13, Issue 7, pages 1511\u20131512, July 1974</ref> and Georgii Gurskii and Alexander Zasedatelev in USSR.<ref>Gurski\u012d GV, Zasedatelev AS, Biofizika, 1978 Sep-Oct;23(5):932-46</ref> Recently these algorithms have become very popular in bioinformatics and computational biology, particularly in the studies of [[nucleosome]] positioning and [[transcription factor]] binding.\n\n== Examples: Computer algorithms ==\n\n=== Dijkstra's algorithm for the shortest path problem ===\nFrom a dynamic programming point of view, [[Dijkstra's algorithm]] for the [[shortest path problem]]  is a successive approximation scheme that solves the dynamic programming functional equation for the shortest path problem by the '''Reaching''' method.<ref name=sniedovich_06>{{Citation | last = Sniedovich | first = M. | title = Dijkstra's algorithm revisited: the dynamic programming connexion | journal = Journal of Control and Cybernetics | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 599\u2013620 | year = 2006 | url = http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/cc/cc35/cc3536.pdf | postscript = .}} [http://www.ifors.ms.unimelb.edu.au/tutorial/dijkstra_new/index.html Online version of the paper with interactive computational modules.]</ref><ref name=denardo_03>{{Citation | last = Denardo | first = E.V. | title = Dynamic Programming: Models and Applications | publisher = [[Dover Publications]] | location = Mineola, NY | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-486-42810-9}}</ref><ref name=sniedovich_10>{{Citation | last = Sniedovich | first = M. | title = Dynamic Programming: Foundations and Principles | publisher = [[Taylor & Francis]] | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-0-8247-4099-3  }}</ref>\n\nIn fact, Dijkstra's explanation of the logic behind the algorithm,<ref>{{harvnb|Dijkstra|1959|p=270}}</ref> namely\n{{quote|\n'''Problem 2.'''

Here is a na\u00efve implementation, based directly on the mathematical definition:\n\n    '''function''' fib(n)\n        '''if''' n <= 1 '''return''' n\n        '''return''' fib(n \u2212 1) + fib(n \u2212 2)\n\nNotice that if we call, say, <code>fib(5)</code>, we produce a call tree that calls the function on the same value many different times:\n\n# <code>fib(5)</code>\n# <code>fib(4) + fib(3)</code>\n# <code>(fib(3) + fib(2)) + (fib(2) + fib(1))</code>\n# <code>((fib(2) + fib(1)) + (fib(1) + fib(0))) + ((fib(1) + fib(0)) + fib(1))</code>\n# <code>(((fib(1) + fib(0)) + fib(1)) + (fib(1) + fib(0))) + ((fib(1) + fib(0)) + fib(1))</code>\n\nIn particular, <code>fib(2)</code> was calculated three times from scratch. In larger examples, many more values of <code>fib</code>, or ''subproblems'', are recalculated, leading to an exponential time algorithm.\n\nNow, suppose we have a simple [[Associative array|map]] object, ''m'', which maps each value of <code>fib</code> that has already been calculated to its result, and we modify our function to use it and update it. The resulting function requires only [[Big-O notation|O]](''n'') time instead of exponential time (but requires [[Big-O notation|O]](''n'') space):\n\n    '''var''' m := '''''map'''''(0 \u2192 0, 1 \u2192 1)\n    '''function''' fib(n)\n        '''if ''key''''' n '''is not in ''map''''' m \n            m[n] := fib(n \u2212 1) + fib(n \u2212 2)\n        '''return''' m[n]\n\nThis technique of saving values that have already been calculated is called ''[[memoization]]''; <!-- Yes, memoization, not memorization. Not a typo. --> this is the top-down approach, since we first break the problem into subproblems and then calculate and store values.\n\nIn the '''bottom-up''' approach, we calculate the smaller values of <code>fib</code> first, then build larger values from them. This method also uses O(''n'') time since it contains a loop that repeats n \u2212 1 times, but it only takes constant (O(1)) space, in contrast to the top-down approach which requires O(''n'') space to store the map.\n\n    '''function''' fib(n)\n        '''if''' n = 0\n            '''return''' 0\n        '''else'''\n            '''var''' previousFib := 0, currentFib := 1\n            '''repeat''' n \u2212 1 '''times''' ''// loop is skipped if n = 1''\n                '''var''' newFib := previousFib + currentFib\n                previousFib := currentFib\n                currentFib  := newFib\n        '''return''' currentFib\n\nIn both examples, we only calculate <code>fib(2)</code> one time, and then use it to calculate both <code>fib(4)</code> and <code>fib(3)</code>, instead of computing it every time either of them is evaluated.\n\nThe above method actually takes <math>\\Omega(n^2)</math> time for large n because addition of two integers with <math>\\Omega(n)</math> bits each takes <math>\\Omega(n)</math> time. (The ''n''<sup>th</sup> fibonacci number has <math>\\Omega(n)</math> bits.) Also, there is a closed form for the Fibonacci sequence, [[Jacques Philippe Marie Binet#Binet's Fibonacci number formula|known as Binet's formula]], from which the <math>n</math>-th term can be [[Computational complexity of mathematical operations|computed]] in approximately <math>O(n(\\log n)^2)</math> time, which is more efficient than the above dynamic programming technique. However, the simple recurrence directly gives [[Fibonacci sequence#Matrix form|the matrix form]] that leads to an approximately <math>O(n\\log n)</math> algorithm by fast [[matrix exponentiation]].\n\n=== A type of balanced 0\u20131 matrix ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\nConsider the problem of assigning values, either zero or one, to the positions of an {{math|<var>n</var> &times; <var>n</var>}} matrix, with {{math|<var>n</var>}} even, so that each row and each column contains exactly {{math|<var>n</var> / 2}} zeros and {{math|<var>n</var> / 2}} ones. We ask how many different assignments there are for a given <math>n</math>. For example, when {{math|<var>n</var> {{=}} 4}}, four possible solutions are\n\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix} \\text{ and } \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix} \\text{ and } \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix} \\text{ and } \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nThere are at least three possible approaches: [[Brute-force search|brute force]], [[backtracking]], and dynamic programming.\n\nBrute force consists of checking all assignments of zeros and ones and counting those that have balanced rows and columns ({{math|<var>n</var> / 2}} zeros and {{math|<var>n</var> / 2}} ones). As there are <math>\\tbinom{n}{n/2}^n</math> possible assignments, this strategy is not practical except maybe up to <math>n=6</math>.\n\nBacktracking for this problem consists of choosing some order of the matrix elements and recursively placing ones or zeros, while checking that in every row and column the number of elements that have not been assigned plus the number of ones or zeros are both at least {{math|<var>n</var> / 2}}. While more sophisticated than brute force, this approach will visit every solution once, making it impractical for {{math|<var>n</var>}} larger than six, since the number of solutions is already 116,963,796,250 for {{math|<var>n</var>}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;8, as we shall see.\n\nDynamic programming makes it possible to count the number of solutions without visiting them all. Imagine backtracking values for the first row \u2013 what information would we require about the remaining rows, in order to be able to accurately count the solutions obtained for each first row value? We consider {{math|<var>k</var> &times; <var>n</var>}} boards, where {{math|1 &le; <var>k</var> &le; <var>n</var>}}, whose <math>k</math> rows contain <math>n/2</math> zeros and <math>n/2</math> ones. The function ''f'' to which [[memoization]] is applied maps vectors of ''n'' pairs of integers to the number of admissible boards (solutions). There is one pair for each column, and its two components indicate respectively the number of zeros and ones that have yet to be placed in that column. We seek the value of <math> f((n/2, n/2), (n/2, n/2), \\ldots (n/2, n/2)) </math> (<math>n</math> arguments or one vector of <math>n</math> elements). The process of subproblem creation involves iterating over every one of  <math>\\tbinom{n}{n/2}</math> possible assignments for the top row of the board, and going through every column, subtracting one from the appropriate element of the pair for that column, depending on whether the assignment for the top row contained a zero or a one at that position. If any one of the results is negative, then the assignment is invalid and does not contribute to the set of solutions (recursion stops). Otherwise, we have an assignment for the top row of the {{math|<var>k</var> &times; <var>n</var>}} board and recursively compute the number of solutions to the remaining {{math|(<var>k</var> &minus; 1) &times; <var>n</var>}} board, adding the numbers of solutions for every admissible assignment of the top row and returning the sum, which is being memoized. The base case is the trivial subproblem, which occurs for a {{math|1 &times; <var>n</var>}} board. The number of solutions for this board is either zero or one, depending on whether the vector is a permutation of {{math|<var>n</var> / 2}} <math>(0, 1)</math> and {{math|<var>n</var> / 2}} <math>(1, 0)</math> pairs or not.\n\nFor example, in the first two boards shown above the sequences of vectors would be\n<PRE WIDTH=80>\n((2, 2) (2, 2) (2, 2) (2, 2))       ((2, 2) (2, 2) (2, 2) (2, 2))     k = 4\n  0      1      0      1              0      0      1      1\n\n((1, 2) (2, 1) (1, 2) (2, 1))       ((1, 2) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 1))     k = 3\n  1      0      1      0              0      0      1      1\n\n((1, 1) (1, 1) (1, 1) (1, 1))       ((0, 2) (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 0))     k = 2\n  0      1      0      1              1      1      0      0\n\n((0, 1) (1, 0) (0, 1) (1, 0))       ((0, 1) (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 0))     k = 1\n  1      0      1      0              1      1      0      0\n\n((0, 0) (0, 0) (0, 0) (0, 0))       ((0, 0) (0, 0), (0, 0) (0, 0))\n</PRE>\n\nThe number of solutions {{OEIS|id=A058527}} is\n\n:<math> 1,\\, 2,\\,  90,\\, 297200,\\, 116963796250,\\, 6736218287430460752, \\ldots </math>\n\nLinks to the MAPLE implementation of the dynamic programming approach may be found among the [[Dynamic programming#External links|external links]].\n\n=== Checkerboard ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\nConsider a [[checkerboard]] with ''n'' \u00d7 ''n'' squares and a cost function <code>c(i, j)</code> which returns a cost associated with square <code>(i,j)</code> (<code>''i''</code> being the row, <code>''j''</code> being the column). For instance (on a 5 \u00d7 5 checkerboard),\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! 5\n| 6 || 7 || 4 || 7 || 8\n|-\n! 4\n| 7 || 6 || 1 || 1 || 4\n|-\n! 3\n| 3 || 5 || 7 || 8 || 2\n|-\n! 2\n| \u2013 || 6 || 7 || 0 || \u2013\n|-\n! 1\n| \u2013 || \u2013 || *5* || \u2013 || \u2013\n|-\n!width=\"15\"| !! style=\"width:15px;\"|1 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|2 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|3 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|4 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|5\n|}\nThus <code>c(1, 3) = 5</code>\n\nLet us say there was a checker that could start at any square on the first rank (i.e., row) and you wanted to know the shortest path (the sum of the minimum costs at each visited rank) to get to the last rank; assuming the checker could move only diagonally left forward, diagonally right forward, or straight forward. That is, a checker on <code>(1,3)</code> can move to <code>(2,2)</code>, <code>(2,3)</code> or <code>(2,4)</code>.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! 5\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n! 4\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n! 3\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n! 2\n|  || x  || x || x ||\n|-\n! 1\n|  ||  || o ||  ||\n|-\n!width=\"15\"| !! style=\"width:15px;\"|1 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|2 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|3 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|4 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|5\n|}\n\nThis problem exhibits '''optimal substructure'''. That is, the solution to the entire problem relies on solutions to subproblems. Let us define a function <code>q(i, j)</code> as\n\n:''q''(''i'', ''j'') = the minimum cost to reach square (''i'', ''j'').\n\nStarting at rank <code>n</code> and descending to rank <code>1</code>, we compute the value of this function for all the squares at each successive rank. Picking the square that holds the minimum value at each rank gives us the shortest path between rank <code>n</code> and rank <code>1</code>.\n\nThe function <code>q(i, j)</code> is equal to the minimum cost to get to any of the three squares below it (since those are the only squares that can reach it) plus <code>c(i, j)</code>. For instance:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! 5\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n! 4\n|  ||  || A  ||  ||\n|-\n! 3\n|  || B || C || D ||\n|-\n! 2\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n! 1\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||\n|-\n!width=\"15\"| !! style=\"width:15px;\"|1 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|2 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|3 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|4 !! style=\"width:15px;\"|5\n|}\n\n: <math>q(A) = \\min(q(B),q(C),q(D))+c(A) \\, </math>\n\nNow, let us define <code>q(i, j)</code> in somewhat more general terms:\n\n: <math>q(i,j)=\\begin{cases} \\infty & j < 1 \\text{ or }j > n \\\\ c(i, j) & i = 1 \\\\ \\min(q(i-1, j-1), q(i-1, j), q(i-1, j+1)) + c(i,j) & \\text{otherwise.}\\end{cases}</math>\n\nThe first line of this equation deals with a board modeled as squares indexed on <code>1</code> at the lowest bound and <code>n</code> at the highest bound. The second line specifies what happens at the last rank; providing a base case. The third line, the recursion, is the important part. It represents the <code>A,B,C,D</code> terms in the example. From this definition we can derive straightforward recursive code for <code>q(i,\u00a0j)</code>. In the following pseudocode, <code>n</code> is the size of the board, <code>c(i, j)</code> is the cost function, and <code>min()</code> returns the minimum of a number of values:\n\n '''function''' minCost(i, j)\n     '''if''' j &lt; 1 '''or''' j > n\n         '''return''' infinity\n     '''else if''' i = 1\n         '''return''' c(i, j)\n     '''else'''\n         '''return''' '''min'''( minCost(i-1, j-1), minCost(i-1, j), minCost(i-1, j+1) ) + c(i, j)\n\nThis function only computes the path cost, not the actual path. We discuss the actual path below. This, like the Fibonacci-numbers example, is horribly slow because it too exhibits the '''overlapping sub-problems''' attribute. That is, it recomputes the same path costs over and over. However, we can compute it much faster in a bottom-up fashion if we store path costs in a two-dimensional array <code>q[i, j]</code> rather than using a function. This avoids recomputation; all the values needed for array <code>q[i, j]</code> are computed ahead of time only once. Precomputed values for <code>(i,j)</code> are simply looked-up whenever needed.\n\nWe also need to know what the actual shortest path is. To do this, we use another array <code>p[i, j]</code>; a ''predecessor array''. This array records the path to any square <code>s</code>. The predecessor of <code>s</code> is modeled as an offset relative to the index (in <code>q[i, j]</code>) of the precomputed path cost of <code>s</code>. To reconstruct the complete path, we lookup the predecessor of <code>s</code>, then the predecessor of that square, then the predecessor of that square, and so on recursively, until we reach the starting square.

Each operation has an associated cost, and the goal is to find the [[edit distance|sequence of edits with the lowest total cost]].\n\nThe problem can be stated naturally as a recursion, a sequence A is optimally edited into a sequence B by either:\n\n# inserting the first character of B, and performing an optimal alignment of A and the tail of B\n# deleting the first character of A, and performing the optimal alignment of the tail of A and B\n# replacing the first character of A with the first character of B, and performing optimal alignments of the tails of A and B.\n\nThe partial alignments can be tabulated in a matrix, where cell (i,j) contains the cost of the optimal alignment of A[1..i] to B[1..j].  The cost in cell (i,j) can be calculated by adding the cost of the relevant operations to the cost of its neighboring cells, and selecting the optimum.\n\nDifferent variants exist, see [[Smith\u2013Waterman algorithm]] and [[Needleman\u2013Wunsch algorithm]].\n\n=== Tower of Hanoi puzzle ===\n[[Image:Tower of Hanoi.jpeg|300px|thumb|A model set of the Towers of Hanoi (with 8 disks)]]\n[[Image:Tower of Hanoi 4.gif|300px|thumb|An animated solution of the '''Tower of Hanoi''' puzzle for ''T(4,3)''.]]\nThe '''[[Tower of Hanoi]]''' or '''Towers of [[Hanoi]]''' is a [[mathematical game]] or [[puzzle]]. It consists of three rods, and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.\n\nThe objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following rules:\n\n* Only one disk may be moved at a time.\n* Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and sliding it onto another rod, on top of the other disks that may already be present on that rod.\n* No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n\nThe dynamic programming solution consists of solving the [[Bellman equation|functional equation]]\n\n: S(n,h,t) = S(n-1,h, not(h,t)) ; S(1,h,t) ; S(n-1,not(h,t),t)\n\nwhere n denotes the number of disks to be moved, h denotes the home rod, t denotes the target rod, not(h,t) denotes the third rod (neither h nor t), \";\" denotes concatenation, and\n\n: S(n, h, t) := solution to a problem consisting of n disks that are to be moved from rod h to rod t.\n\nFor n=1 the problem is trivial, namely S(1,h,t) = \"move a disk from rod h to rod t\" (there is only one disk left).\n\nThe  number of moves required by this solution is 2<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1. If the objective is to '''maximize''' the number of moves (without cycling) then the dynamic programming [[Bellman equation|functional equation]]  is slightly more complicated and  3<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 moves are required.<ref>{{Citation |author=Moshe Sniedovich |title= OR/MS Games: 2.

We make a few assumptions:\n\n:* An egg that survives a fall can be used again.\n:* A broken egg must be discarded.\n:* The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs.\n:* If an egg breaks when dropped, then it would break if dropped from a higher window.\n:* If an egg survives a fall, then it would survive a shorter fall.\n:* It is not ruled out that the first-floor windows break eggs, nor is it ruled out that eggs can survive the 36th-floor windows.\n\n: If only one egg is available and we wish to be sure of obtaining the right result, the experiment can be carried out in only one way. Drop the egg from the first-floor window; if it survives, drop it from the second-floor window. Continue upward until it breaks. In the worst case, this method may require 36 droppings. Suppose 2 eggs are available. What is the lowest number of egg-droppings that is guaranteed to work in all cases?\n\nTo derive a dynamic programming [[Bellman equation|functional equation]] for this puzzle, let the '''state''' of the dynamic programming model be a pair s = (n,k), where\n\n: ''n'' = number of test eggs available, ''n'' = 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., ''N''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1.\n: ''k'' = number of (consecutive) floors yet to be tested, ''k'' = 0, 1, 2, ..., ''H''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1.\n\nFor instance, ''s'' = (2,6) indicates that two test eggs are available and 6 (consecutive) floors are yet to be tested. The initial state of the process is ''s'' = (''N'',''H'') where ''N'' denotes the number of test eggs available at the commencement of the experiment. The process terminates either when there are no more test eggs (''n'' = 0) or when ''k'' = 0, whichever occurs first. If termination occurs at state ''s'' = (0,''k'') and ''k''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0, then the test failed.\n\nNow, let\n\n: ''W''(''n'',''k'') = minimum number of trials required to identify the value of the critical floor under the worst-case scenario given that the process is in state ''s'' = (''n'',''k'').\n\nThen it can be shown that<ref name=\"sniedovich_03\">Sniedovich, M.

This can be improved to <math>O( n k \\log k )</math> time by binary searching on the optimal <math>x</math> in the above recurrence, since <math>W(n-1,x-1)</math> is increasing in <math>x</math> while <math>W(n,k-x)</math> is decreasing in <math>x</math>, thus a local minimum of <math>\\max(W(n-1,x-1),W(n,k-x))</math> is a global minimum. Also, by storing the optimal <math>x</math> for each cell in the DP table and referring to its value for the previous cell, the optimal <math>x</math> for each cell can be found in constant time, improving it to <math>O( n k )</math> time. However, there is an even faster solution that involves a different parametrization of the problem:\n\nLet <math>k</math> be the total number of floors such that the eggs break when dropped from the <math>k</math>th floor (The example above is equivalent to taking <math>k=37</math>).\n\nLet <math>m</math> be the minimum floor from which the egg must be dropped to be broken.\n\nLet <math>f(t,n)</math> be the maximum number of values of <math>m</math> that are distinguishable using <math>t</math> tries and <math>n</math> eggs.\n\nThen <math>f(t,0) = f(0,n) = 1</math> for all <math>t,n \\geq 0</math>.\n\nLet <math>a</math> be the floor from which the first egg is dropped in the optimal strategy.\n\nIf the first egg broke, <math>m</math> is from <math>1</math> to <math>a</math> and distinguishable using at most <math>t-1</math> tries and <math>n-1</math> eggs.\n\nIf the first egg did not break, <math>m</math> is from <math>a+1</math> to <math>k</math> and distinguishable using <math>t-1</math> tries and <math>n</math> eggs.\n\nTherefore, <math>f(t,n) = f(t-1,n-1) + f(t-1,n)</math>.\n\nThen the problem is equivalent to finding the minimum <math>x</math> such that <math>f(x,n) \\geq k</math>.\n\nTo do so, we could compute <math>\\{ f(t,i) : 0 \\leq i \\leq n \\}</math> in order of increasing <math>t</math>, which would take <math>O( n x )</math> time.\n\nThus, if we separately handle the case of <math>n=1</math>, the algorithm would take <math>O( n \\sqrt{k} )</math> time.\n\nBut the recurrence relation can in fact be solved, giving <math>f(t,n) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n}{ \\binom{t}{i} }</math>, which can be computed in <math>O(n)</math> time using the identity <math>\\binom{t}{i+1} = \\binom{t}{i} \\frac{t-i}{i+1}</math> for all <math>i \\geq 0</math>.\n\nSince <math>f(t,n) \\leq f(t+1,n)</math> for all <math>t \\geq 0</math>, we can binary search on <math>t</math> to find <math>x</math>, giving an <math>O( n \\log k )</math> algorithm.\n<ref>{{Citation |author=Dean Connable Wills |title=Connections between combinatorics of permutations and algorithms and geometry |url=https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/handle/1957/11929?show=full}}</ref>\n\n=== Matrix chain multiplication ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\n{{Main|Matrix chain multiplication}}\n<!--Show how the placement of parentheses affects the number of scalar multiplications required when multiplying a bunch of matrices.\nShow how to write a dynamic program to calculate the optimal parentheses placement.\nThis is such a long example that it might be better to make it its own article.-->\n\nMatrix chain multiplication is a well-known example that demonstrates utility of dynamic programming. For example,  engineering applications often have to multiply a chain of matrices. It is not surprising to find matrices of large dimensions, for example 100\u00d7100. Therefore, our task is to multiply matrices {{tmath|A_1, A_2, .... A_n}}. As we know from basic linear algebra, matrix multiplication is not commutative, but is associative; and we can multiply only two matrices at a time. So, we can multiply this chain of matrices in many different ways, for example:\n\n: {{math|((A<sub>1</sub> \u00d7 A<sub>2</sub>) \u00d7 A<sub>3</sub>) \u00d7 ... A<sub>n</sub>}}\n\n: {{math|A<sub>1</sub>\u00d7(((A<sub>2</sub>\u00d7A<sub>3</sub>)\u00d7 ... ) \u00d7 A<sub>n</sub>)}}\n\n: {{math|(A<sub>1</sub> \u00d7 A<sub>2</sub>) \u00d7 (A<sub>3</sub> \u00d7 ... A<sub>n</sub>)}}\n\nand so on. There are numerous ways to multiply this chain of matrices. They will all produce the same final result, however they will take more or less time to compute, based on which particular matrices are multiplied. If matrix A has dimensions m\u00d7n and matrix B has dimensions n\u00d7q, then matrix C=A\u00d7B will have dimensions m\u00d7q, and will require m*n*q scalar multiplications (using a simplistic matrix multiplication algorithm for purposes of illustration).\n\nFor example, let us multiply matrices A, B and C. Let us assume that their dimensions are m\u00d7n, n\u00d7p, and p\u00d7s, respectively. Matrix A\u00d7B\u00d7C will be of size m\u00d7s and can be calculated in two ways shown below:\n\n# Ax(B\u00d7C)    This order of matrix multiplication will require nps + mns scalar multiplications.  \n# (A\u00d7B)\u00d7C    This order of matrix multiplication will require mnp + mps scalar calculations.\n\nLet us assume that m = 10, n = 100, p = 10 and s = 1000. So, the first way to multiply the chain will require 1,000,000 + 1,000,000 calculations. The second way will require only 10,000+100,000 calculations. Obviously, the second way is faster, and we should multiply the matrices using that arrangement of parenthesis.\n\nTherefore, our conclusion is that the order of parenthesis matters, and that our task is to find the optimal order of parenthesis.\n\nAt this point, we have several choices, one of which is to design a dynamic programming algorithm that will split the problem into overlapping problems and calculate the optimal arrangement of parenthesis. The dynamic programming solution is presented below.\n\nLet's call m[i,j] the minimum number of scalar multiplications needed to multiply a chain of matrices from matrix i to matrix j (i.e. A<sub>i</sub> \u00d7 .... \u00d7 A<sub>j</sub>, i.e. i<=j). We split the chain at some matrix k, such that i <= k < j, and try to find out which combination produces minimum m[i,j].\n\nThe formula is:\n\n        '''if''' i = j, m[i,j]= 0\n        '''if''' i < j, m[i,j]= min over all possible values of k {{nowrap|(m[i,k]+m[k+1,j] + <math>p_{i-1}*p_k*p_j</math>)}} \nwhere ''k'' ranges from ''i'' to ''j''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1.\n\n*{{tmath|p_{{(}}i-1{{)}}}} is the row dimension of matrix i,\n*{{tmath|p_k}} is the column dimension of matrix k,\n*{{tmath|p_j}} is the column dimension of matrix j.\n\nThis formula can be coded as shown below, where input parameter \"chain\" is the chain of matrices, i.e. {{tmath|A_1, A_2, ... A_n}}:\n\n  '''function''' OptimalMatrixChainParenthesis(chain)\n      n = length(chain)\n      '''for''' i = 1, n\n          m[i,i] = 0    ''// Since it takes no calculations to multiply one matrix''\n      '''for''' len = 2, n\n          '''for''' i = 1, n - len + 1\n              j = i + len -1\n              m[i,j] = infinity      ''// So that the first calculation updates''\n              '''for''' k = i, j-1\n                  {{nowrap|1=q = m[i, k] + m[k+1, j] + <math>p_{i-1}*p_k*p_j</math>}}\n                  '''if''' q < m[i, j]     ''// The new order of parentheses is better than what we had''\n                      m[i, j] = q    ''// Update''\n                      s[i, j] = k    ''// Record which k to split on, i.e. where to place the parenthesis''\n\nSo far, we have calculated values for all possible {{math|''m''[''i'', ''j'']}}, the minimum number of calculations to multiply a chain from matrix ''i'' to matrix ''j'', and we have recorded the corresponding \"split point\"{{math|''s''[''i'', ''j'']}}. For example, if we are multiplying chain {{math|A<sub>1</sub>\u00d7A<sub>2</sub>\u00d7A<sub>3</sub>\u00d7A<sub>4</sub>}}, and it turns out that {{math|1=''m''[1, 3] = 100}} and {{math|1=''s''[1, 3] = 2}}, that means that the optimal placement of parenthesis for matrices 1 to 3 is {{tmath|(A_1\\times A_2)\\times A_3}} and to multiply those matrices will require 100 scalar calculation.\n\nThis algorithm will produce \"tables\" ''m''[, ] and ''s''[, ] that will have entries for all possible values of i and j. The final solution for the entire chain is m[1, n], with corresponding split at s[1, n]. Unraveling the solution will be recursive, starting from the top and continuing until we reach the base case, i.e. multiplication of single matrices.\n\nTherefore, the next step is to actually split the chain, i.e. to place the parenthesis where they (optimally) belong. For this purpose we could use the following algorithm:\n\n  '''function''' PrintOptimalParenthesis(s, i, j)\n      '''if''' i = j\n         print \"A\"i\n      '''else'''\n         print \"(\" PrintOptimalParenthesis(s, i, s[i, j]) PrintOptimalParenthesis(s, s[i, j] + 1, j) \")\"\n\nOf course, this algorithm is not useful for actual multiplication. This algorithm is just a user-friendly way to see what the result looks like.\n\nTo actually multiply the matrices using the proper splits, we need the following algorithm:\n<source lang=\"javascript\" enclose=\"div\">\n   function MatrixChainMultiply(chain from 1 to n)       // returns the final matrix, i.e. A1\u00d7A2\u00d7... \u00d7An\n      OptimalMatrixChainParenthesis(chain from 1 to n)   // this will produce s[ . ] and m[ . ] \"tables\"\n      OptimalMatrixMultiplication(s, chain from 1 to n)  // actually multiply\n\n   function OptimalMatrixMultiplication(s, i, j)   // returns the result of multiplying a chain of matrices from Ai to Aj in optimal way\n      if i < j\n         // keep on splitting the chain and multiplying the matrices in left and right sides\n         LeftSide = OptimalMatrixMultiplication(s, i, s[i, j])\n         RightSide = OptimalMatrixMultiplication(s, s[i, j] + 1, j)\n         return MatrixMultiply(LeftSide, RightSide) \n      else if i = j\n         return Ai   // matrix at position i\n      else \n         print \"error, i <= j must hold\"\n\n    function MatrixMultiply(A, B)    // function that multiplies two matrices\n      if columns(A) = rows(B) \n         for i = 1, rows(A)\n            for j = 1, columns(B)\n               C[i, j] = 0\n               for k = 1, columns(A)\n                   C[i, j] = C[i, j] + A[i, k]*B[k, j] \n               return C \n      else \n          print \"error, incompatible dimensions.\"\n</source>\n\n== History ==\nThe term ''dynamic programming'' was originally used in the 1940s by [[Richard Bellman]] to describe the process of solving problems where one needs to find the best decisions one after another.  By 1953, he refined this to the modern meaning, referring specifically to nesting smaller decision problems inside larger decisions,<ref>Stuart Dreyfus. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050110161049/http://www.wu-wien.ac.at/usr/h99c/h9951826/bellman_dynprog.pdf \"Richard Bellman on the birth of Dynamical Programming\"].</ref>  and the field was thereafter recognized by the [[IEEE]] as a [[systems analysis]] and [[engineering]] topic.  Bellman's contribution is remembered in the name of the [[Bellman equation]], a central result of dynamic programming which restates an optimization problem in [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]] form.\n\nBellman explains the reasoning behind the term ''dynamic programming'' in his autobiography, ''Eye of the Hurricane: An Autobiography'':\n\n{{Quote\n|text=I spent the Fall quarter (of 1950) at RAND. My first task was to find a name for multistage decision processes. An interesting question is, Where did the name, dynamic programming, come from? The 1950s were not good years for mathematical research. We had a very interesting gentleman in Washington named [[Charles Erwin Wilson|Wilson]]. He was Secretary of Defense, and he actually had a pathological fear and hatred of the word research. I\u2019m not using the term lightly; I\u2019m using it precisely. His face would suffuse, he would turn red, and he would get violent if people used the term research in his presence. You can imagine how he felt, then, about the term mathematical. The RAND Corporation was employed by the Air Force, and the Air Force had Wilson as its boss, essentially. Hence, I felt I had to do something to shield Wilson and the Air Force from the fact that I was really doing mathematics inside the RAND Corporation. What title, what name, could I choose? In the first place I was interested in planning, in decision making, in thinking. But planning, is not a good word for various reasons. I decided therefore to use the word \"programming\". I wanted to get across the idea that this was dynamic, this was multistage, this was time-varying. I thought, let's kill two birds with one stone. Let's take a word that has an absolutely precise meaning, namely dynamic, in the classical physical sense. It also has a very interesting property as an adjective, and that is it's impossible to use the word dynamic in a pejorative sense. Try thinking of some combination that will possibly give it a pejorative meaning. It's impossible. Thus, I thought dynamic programming was a good name. It was something not even a Congressman could object to. So I used it as an umbrella for my activities.\n|author=Richard Bellman\n|source=''Eye of the Hurricane: An Autobiography'' (1984, page 159)\n}}\n\nThe word ''dynamic'' was chosen by Bellman to capture the time-varying aspect of the problems, and because it sounded impressive.<ref name=\"Eddy\">{{cite journal |last=Eddy |first=S.

As Russell and Norvig in their book have written, referring to the above story: \"This cannot be strictly true, because his first paper using the term (Bellman, 1952) appeared before Wilson became Secretary of Defense in 1953.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Russell |first=S. |last2=Norvig |first2=P. |title=Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach |edition=3rd |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-13-207148-2 }}</ref> Also, there is a comment in a speech by [http://a2c2.org/awards/richard-e-bellman-control-heritage-award/2004-00-00t000000/harold-j-kushner Harold J.

His mother, Pearl Fernandez, and her boyfriend, Isauro Aguirre, were both charged and convicted of first degree murder with special circumstances of torture. Pearl Fernandez was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole and Isauro Aguirre was sentenced to death.\n\nThroughout Fernandez's eight month stay with his mother and Aguirre, multiple people reported signs of abuse to social workers with the [[Department of Children and Family Services (Los Angeles County)|Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services]] and the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]]. However, Fernandez was never removed from the household.

Ultimately, the jury found him guilty of first degree murder and guilty of the circumstance of torture charges.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mother\u2019s boyfriend found guilty in systematic torture, murder of 8-year-old boy |url=https://fox17online.com/2017/11/15/mothers-boyfriend-found-guilty-in-systematic-torture-murder-of-8-year-old-boy/ |website=WXMI |accessdate=March 19, 2020 |language=en |date=November 16, 2017}}</ref> On December 11, 2017 jury deliberation began for the sentencing phase. The next day the jury was deadlocked; however, on December 13 they decided to recommend the death penalty, which was accepted by Judge George G. Lomeli.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\n==Controversy of governmental response==\nIn the months preceding his death, Fernandez showed his injuries or reported abuse to a [[security guard]], family members, and a teacher, which led to several calls to social services to no avail. After being hit with a metal belt, he asked his teacher, Jennifer Garcia, if it's \"normal to bleed.\" In response, Garcia called social services, and was later called by social worker Stefanie Rodriguez informing her that she was assigned to the case. On another day, Fernandez came to class with chunks of hair missing and a lump on his lip. When questioned about it by Garcia, Fernandez said his mother had punched him in his mouth. After having a discussion with the principal, Garcia called Rodriguez back and informed her of the recent signs of abuse. Later when Fernandez reported to his teacher that he was shot in the face with a BB gun by his mother, she once again informed social services of the new sign of abuse. After Fernandez missed thirteen days of school, he returned and his teacher noticed his condition had worsened. She attempted to call Rodriguez, but her call was never returned. Fernandez's great-aunt Elizabeth Carranza and her husband called social services three times and talked to sheriffs twice regarding the welfare of Fernandez. Twenty-nine days before his death, a security guard, Arturo Miranda Martinez, at a Los Angeles County Welfare Office noticed extensive injuries on Fernandez's body which prompted him to call [[9-1-1]], risking his job to report the injuries to sheriffs. Overall, between 2003 and 2012, sixty complaints were filed against Pearl Fernandez and Aguirre to the [[Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services]]. While social workers and the sheriff\u2019s office did check on Fernandez and opened eight independent investigations, he was never removed from the household, ultimately leading to his death.<ref name=\"auto7\"/>\n\nTwo social workers, Stefanie Rodriguez and Patricia Clement, and two supervisors, Kevin Bom and Gregory Merritt for the [[Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services]], were fired and charged with [[child abuse]] and falsifying public records. The unprecedented charges held heavy consequences, including up to eleven years in prison. However, these charges were ultimately dismissed by [[California Courts of Appeal#Second District|California\u2019s 2nd District Court of Appeal]] for lack of probable cause. In January 2020, prosecutors attempted to get a re-hearing for the case, but eventually decided to drop the charges.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nied |first1=Jennifer |title=Gabriel Fernandez's Social Workers Have Another Court Date Coming Up |url=https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/a31741999/gabriel-fernandez-social-workers/ |website=Women's Health |accessdate=March 19, 2020 |date=March 18, 2020}}</ref> Additionally, 9 Sheriff's deputies were internally disciplined for not properly investigating the abuse allegations.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Christian Community |url=Gloriavale Christian Community |website=Early Christian Doctrines |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Media portrayal ==\n''[[The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez]]'' is a six-part crime documentary that premiered on [[Netflix]] in 2020.

His mother, Pearl Fernandez, and her boyfriend, Isauro Aguirre, were both charged and convicted of first degree murder with special circumstances of torture. Pearl Fernandez was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole and Isauro Aguirre was sentenced to death.\n\nThroughout Fernandez's eight month stay with his mother and Aguirre, multiple people reported signs of abuse to social workers with the [[Department of Children and Family Services (Los Angeles County)|Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services]] and the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]]. However, Fernandez was never removed from the household. This led to several concerns over the effectiveness and efficiency of social services in [[Los Angeles County]], and ultimately led to four social workers being criminally charged in [[Los Angeles Superior Court]].\n\n==Abuse==\nIn 2012, Pearl Fernandez, the biological mother of Gabriel Fernandez, was given [[child custody]] of Gabriel, reportedly to gain [[welfare]] benefits.

Executive director of the retirement home and former boss of Aguirre, Susan Weisbarth, described him as a \"quiet...down to earth nice person, always willing to help.\u201d She also commented that throughout his three year employment he was patient and loving, and would commonly change the diapers of elderly residents at the facility. Staff at the facility nicknamed him \"Shaggy,\" which was, according to Weisbarth, a term referencing his endearment. Ex-coworker Sherline Mille, who also worked for Woodland Park Retirement Hotel, noted that while Aguirre was driving residents he would often drive them the scenic route so they could get to see views other than the freeway. In October 2012, Aguirre began working as a [[security guard]] for AVL Private Security; through AVL he worked at the Vallarta Market in [[Palmdale, California]]. Aguirre met Pearl Fernandez roughly a year and a half to two years before they took custody of Gabriel Fernandez.

I'm sorry to my children, and I want them to know that I love them.\"\n===Trial of Isauro Aguirre===\nIsauro Aguirre pleaded not guilty to the charge of [[first degree murder]] with special circumstance of torture, and the case was prosecuted by Deputy District Attorney Jon Hatami and Deputy District Attorney Scott Yang.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web |title=Jury Recommends Death Sentence for Isauro Aguirre for Murder of 8-Year-Old Gabriel Fernandez |url=https://ktla.com/news/local-news/jury-recommends-isauro-aguirre-be-sentenced-to-death-for-gabriel-fernandezs-murder/ |website=KTLA |accessdate=March 19, 2020 |date=December 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2017, jury selection began for the case. Questionnaires were given to prospective jurors, and they were informed that the trial could last as long as six weeks. Additionally, they were told the trial involved \u201cextensive internal and external injuries\u201d of the victim. The jury composition was seven women and five men.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jury selection begins in trial over local boy\u2019s death |url=http://ourweekly.com/news/2017/sep/28/jury-selection-begins-trial-over-local-boys-death/ |website=ourweekly.com |accessdate=March 19, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nWhen the trial began jurors were given details about the extensive abuse Gabriel Fernandez went through in the months preceding his fatal beating. Prosecutor Jon Hatami called Aguirre \"pure evil\" and argued that he deserved the death penalty even though it \"doesn't even compare to what he did to Gabriel.\"\n\nDefense attorney John Alan argued that Aguirre was considered to be \"kind\" and \"compassionate\" during his employment at the retirement facility, and that he had never committed a crime before meeting Pearl Fernandez.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nJury deliberation began on November 14, 2017, and a verdict was reached the next afternoon.

The next day the jury was deadlocked; however, on December 13 they decided to recommend the death penalty, which was accepted by Judge George G. Lomeli.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\n==Controversy of governmental response==\nIn the months preceding his death, Fernandez showed his injuries or reported abuse to a [[security guard]], family members, and a teacher, which led to several calls to social services to no avail. After being hit with a metal belt, he asked his teacher, Jennifer Garcia, if it's \"normal to bleed.\" In response, Garcia called social services, and was later called by social worker Stefanie Rodriguez informing her that she was assigned to the case. On another day, Fernandez came to class with chunks of hair missing and a lump on his lip. When questioned about it by Garcia, Fernandez said his mother had punched him in his mouth. After having a discussion with the principal, Garcia called Rodriguez back and informed her of the recent signs of abuse. Later when Fernandez reported to his teacher that he was shot in the face with a BB gun by his mother, she once again informed social services of the new sign of abuse. After Fernandez missed thirteen days of school, he returned and his teacher noticed his condition had worsened. She attempted to call Rodriguez, but her call was never returned. Fernandez's great-aunt Elizabeth Carranza and her husband called social services three times and talked to sheriffs twice regarding the welfare of Fernandez. Twenty-nine days before his death, a security guard, Arturo Miranda Martinez, at a Los Angeles County Welfare Office noticed extensive injuries on Fernandez's body which prompted him to call [[9-1-1]], risking his job to report the injuries to sheriffs. Overall, between 2003 and 2012, sixty complaints were filed against Pearl Fernandez and Aguirre to the [[Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services]]. While social workers and the sheriff\u2019s office did check on Fernandez and opened eight independent investigations, he was never removed from the household, ultimately leading to his death.<ref name=\"auto7\"/>\n\nTwo social workers, Stefanie Rodriguez and Patricia Clement, and two supervisors, Kevin Bom and Gregory Merritt for the [[Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services]], were fired and charged with [[child abuse]] and falsifying public records. The unprecedented charges held heavy consequences, including up to eleven years in prison. However, these charges were ultimately dismissed by [[California Courts of Appeal#Second District|California\u2019s 2nd District Court of Appeal]] for lack of probable cause. In January 2020, prosecutors attempted to get a re-hearing for the case, but eventually decided to drop the charges.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nied |first1=Jennifer |title=Gabriel Fernandez's Social Workers Have Another Court Date Coming Up |url=https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/a31741999/gabriel-fernandez-social-workers/ |website=Women's Health |accessdate=March 19, 2020 |date=March 18, 2020}}</ref> Additionally, 9 Sheriff's deputies were internally disciplined for not properly investigating the abuse allegations.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Christian Community |url=Gloriavale Christian Community |website=Early Christian Doctrines |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Media portrayal ==\n''[[The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez]]'' is a six-part crime documentary that premiered on [[Netflix]] in 2020.

It became a town in 1295 when King [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|Wenceslaus II]] granted Plze\u0148 its [[civic charter]] as a \"Royal City\" and established a new town site, some {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} away from the original settlement, which is the current town of [[Star\u00fd Plzenec]]. It quickly became an important town on trade routes leading to [[Nuremberg]] and [[Regensburg]]; in the 14th century, it was the third-largest town in Bohemia after Prague and [[Kutn\u00e1 Hora]]. \n\nDuring the [[Hussite Wars]], it was the centre of Catholic resistance to the [[Hussites]]: [[Prokop the Great]] unsuccessfully [[Siege of Pilsen (1433-1434)|besieged]] it three times, and it joined the league of Catholic nobles against King [[George of Podebrady]]. In 1468, the town acquired a [[printing press]]; the Trojan Chronicle (''Kronika troj\u00e1nsk\u00e1'' in Czech), the first book published in Bohemia, was printed on it.\n\n=== 17th century ===\nEmperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] made Plze\u0148 his seat from 1599 to 1600. During the [[Thirty Years' War]] the town was taken by [[Peter Ernst, Count of Mansfeld|Mansfeld]] in 1618 after the [[Siege of Plze\u0148]] and it was not recaptured by Imperial troops until 1621. [[Albrecht von Wallenstein|Wallenstein]] made it his winter quarters in 1633. The town was unsuccessfully besieged by the [[Swedish Empire|Swedes]] in 1637 and 1648. The town and region have been staunchly Catholic despite the Hussite Wars.\n\nFrom the end of the 17th century, the architecture of Plze\u0148 has been influenced by the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style. The city centre has been under [[cultural heritage preservation]] since 1989.\n\n=== 19th century ===\nIn the second half of the 19th century Plze\u0148, already an important trade centre for [[Bohemia]], near the Bavarian/German border, began to industrialise rapidly. In 1869 [[Emil \u0160koda]] started up the [[\u0160koda Works]], which became the most important and influential engineering company in the country and a crucial supplier of arms to the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. By 1917 the [[\u0160koda Works]] employed over 30,000 workers. \n\nAfter 1898 the second largest employer was the National Railways train workshop, with about 2,000 employees: this was the largest rail repair shop in all [[Austria-Hungary]]. Between 1861 and 1877, the Plze\u0148 railway junction was completed and in 1899 the first tram line started in the city. This burst of industry had two important effects: the growth of the local [[Czechs|Czech]] ([[Slavs|Slavic]]) population and of the urban poor. After 1868 first Czech mayor of the city was elected.\n\n=== World War II ===\nFollowing [[Czechoslovak]] independence from [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1918 the German-speaking minority in the countryside bordering the city of Plze\u0148 hoped to be united with Austria and were unhappy at being included in Czechoslovakia. Many allied themselves to the [[Nazi]] cause after 1933, in the hope that [[Adolf Hitler]] might be able to unite them with their German-speaking neighbours.\n\nFollowing the [[Munich Agreement]] in 1938, Plze\u0148 became literally a frontier town, after the creation of the [[Sudetenland]] moved the [[Third Reich]] borders to the city's outer limits. During the [[Nazi]] occupation from 1939 to 1945 the [[\u0160koda Works]] in Pilsen was forced to provide armaments for the [[Wehrmacht]], and Czech contributions, particularly in the field of tanks, were noted.\n\nBetween 17 and 26 January 1942, over 2,000 Jewish inhabitants, most of Plze\u0148's Jewish population, were deported by the Nazis to the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]].\n\nThe German-speaking population was forcibly expelled from the city and indeed [[Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia|all of Czechoslovakia]] after the end of the war in 1945, according to the provisions of the [[Potsdam agreement]]. All of their property was confiscated.\n\nOn 6 May 1945, near the end of the [[Second World War]], Plze\u0148 was liberated from [[Nazi Germany]] by the [[16th Armored Division (United States)|16th Armored Division]] of General [[George S. Patton|Patton's]] [[U.S. Third Army|3rd Army]]. Also participating in the liberation of the city were elements of the 97th and 2nd Infantry Divisions supported by the Polish [[Holy Cross Mountains Brigade]]. Other Third Army units liberated major portions of Western Bohemia. The rest of [[Czechoslovakia]] was liberated from German control by the Soviet [[Red Army]]. Elements of the 3rd Army, as well as units from the 1st Army, remained in Plze\u0148 until late November 1945, assisting the Czechs with rebuilding.\n\n=== Communist era ===\nAfter the [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'\u00e9tat|Communist Party of Czechoslovakia coup of February 1948]], the Czechoslovak government launched a currency reform in 1953. This reform caused a wave of discontent, including the [[Uprising in Plze\u0148 (1953)|Plze\u0148 uprising]]. On 1 June 1953 over 20,000 people, mainly workers at the \u0160koda Works, began protesting against the government. Protesters forced their way into the town hall and threw communist symbols, furniture and other objects out of the windows. The protest caused a retaliation from the government; as part of their retaliation, they destroyed the statue of [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk]]. The statue has since been re-erected.\n\nThe next year, a West German homing pigeon was lost near the Czechoslovak border. It returned two days later, bearing a strong anti-communist message, signed \"Unbowed Pilsen.\" The bird, named [[Leaping Lena]], was taken to the United States where it was celebrated as a Cold War hero.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2 August 1954|title=Iron Curtain Bird Here on Crusade|page=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=23 August 1954|page=19|title=Heroine Pigeon Now a 'Citizen'}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Cummings|first=Richard H.|title=Radio Free Europe's \"Crusade for Freedom\"|pages=116\u2013117|year=2010|publisher=McFarland}}</ref>\n{{Historical populations\n|align=right\n|2005|162759\n|2006|163392\n|2007|165238\n|2008|169273\n|2009|169935\n|2010|168808\n|2011|167302\n|2012|167472\n|2013|168034\n|2014|169033\n}}\n\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"float:center;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" | '''Significant minority groups'''\n|-\n!

Plze\u0148 has low rainfall ({{convert|604|mm|0|abbr=on}} year average) evenly spread over the year. Precipitation occurs on average every second day, and the number of days with [[thunderstorm]]s is 19. It receives on average 1700 hours of sunshine though winters have longer periods without sunshine. Terrain features and a relatively low altitude ({{convert|290|to|390|metres|feet|abbr=on}}) give some shelter from strong winds. \n\nWinters are chilly but milder than some adjacent areas. Snow cover is erratic and lasts on average for 51 days. Though an average year has 113 days with minimum temperature below zero, the temperature falls below {{convert|-15|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} on 5 days. The record low temperatures is around {{convert|-20|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Winters are often murky with frequent long-standing haze. Spring is short, and in April to June there is blooming vegetation. Summer lasts from the end of May until the first third of September. During that period Plze\u0148 has [[Weather front|changeable weather]] which can be warm to hot. Temperatures are always above 5 degrees Celsius with nights between {{convert|8|to|18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and days between {{convert|16|to|35|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. Days are up to 16 hours long.\n\nPlze\u0148 can be hot, especially during heat waves originating in the southern [[Mediterranean]]. The number of hot days above {{convert|30|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} is steadily growing, with 5 months (late April \u2013 early September) of possible 30+ \u00b0C days. If hot weather does occur, it is often changes after a few weeks into cold and rainy weather with incoming Atlantic-based fronts. Nights can be unpleasantly cold even in summer, with high level of humidity. Winter frosts frequently occur from the second half of November to the end of March. February is the driest month with {{convert|32|mm|1|abbr=on}} of precipitation, and July the wettest with {{convert|80|mm|1|abbr=on}}. The only natural hazards are occasional fast changes of weather with negative consequences, e.g. floodings.\n\nExtreme values for years 2011 and 2012: \nAn extremely cold day of 2011 had {{convert|-7.6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} on average (23 February), {{convert|-0.7|to|-13.3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and extremely hot day {{convert|25.2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} on average (24 August, {{convert|19.5|to|32.8|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.

The combination of pale colour from the new malts, Pilsen's remarkably soft water, [[Saaz hops|Saaz]] [[noble hops]] from nearby [[\u017datec]] (''Saaz'' in German) and Bavarian-style lagering produced a clear, golden beer which was regarded as a sensation.\nImproving transport meant that this new beer was soon available throughout Central Europe and {{lang|de|Pilsner Brauart}}-style brewing was widely imitated. \n\nIn 1859, \"Pilsner Bier\" was registered as a brand name at the Chamber of Commerce and Trade in Plze\u0148. In 1898, the [[Pilsner Urquell]] trade mark was created to put emphasis on it being the original brewery.\n\n==Economy==\nPlze\u0148 is a centre of business in the western part of the Czech Republic.\n\nSince the late 1990s the city has experienced high growth in foreign investment.

While part of this is explained by commuters to the city, it is one of the most prosperous cities in the Czech Republic.\n\nThe [[\u0160koda Works|\u0160koda]] company, established in Plze\u0148 in 1859, has been an important element of Austro-Hungarian, Czechoslovak and Czech engineering, and one of the biggest European arms factories. During the Communist era (1948\u20131989) the company's production had been directed to the needs of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. Disarray in the era after the [[Velvet Revolution]], and unsuccessful efforts to gain new Western markets, resulted in sales problems and debts. After a huge restructuring process the company now has just two principal subsidiaries: [[\u0160koda Transportation]] (locomotives, underground trains and trams, which have been sold to [[Portland, Oregon]]; [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]]; [[Seattle]] and [[Sardinia]]) and \u0160koda Power was bought in 2009<ref>[https://www.doosan.com/en/intro/business-highlights/ Doosan, About Us, Business Highlights, Global Growth, 2009]</ref>and now owned by the South Korean conglomerate [[Doosan]] .\n\nMany foreign companies now have manufacturing bases in Plze\u0148, including [[Daikin]] and [[Panasonic]]. There has been much discussion of redeveloping those large areas of the \u0160koda plant which the company no longer uses.\n\nPlze\u0148 also has the biggest distillery ([[Fernet Stock|Stock]]) in the Czech Republic.\n\n==Religion==\nSince 31 May 1993 Plze\u0148 has been the seat of the Catholic Diocese of Plze\u0148.

Another storey was added in 1822 in French Imperial style. The Gothic portal (dating from the 1500s) was added in 1912, coming from another house that had been demolished. Above the portal there is a commemorative plaque dedicated to Dr [[Josef Skoda]] (a professor at the [[Vienna University]]), who was born next door on 10 December 1805.\n\nPlze\u0148 is also well known for the [[Pilsner Urquell]] (since 1842) and [[Gambrinus (beer)|Gambrinus]] (since 1869) [[brewery|breweries]], currently owned by Asahi Group Holdings.

It became a town in 1295 when King [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|Wenceslaus II]] granted Plze\u0148 its [[civic charter]] as a \"Royal City\" and established a new town site, some {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} away from the original settlement, which is the current town of [[Star\u00fd Plzenec]]. It quickly became an important town on trade routes leading to [[Nuremberg]] and [[Regensburg]]; in the 14th century, it was the third-largest town in Bohemia after Prague and [[Kutn\u00e1 Hora]]. \n\nDuring the [[Hussite Wars]], it was the centre of Catholic resistance to the [[Hussites]]: [[Prokop the Great]] unsuccessfully [[Siege of Pilsen (1433-1434)|besieged]] it three times, and it joined the league of Catholic nobles against King [[George of Podebrady]]. In 1468, the town acquired a [[printing press]]; the Trojan Chronicle (''Kronika troj\u00e1nsk\u00e1'' in Czech), the first book published in Bohemia, was printed on it.\n\n=== 17th century ===\nEmperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] made Plze\u0148 his seat from 1599 to 1600. During the [[Thirty Years' War]] the town was taken by [[Peter Ernst, Count of Mansfeld|Mansfeld]] in 1618 after the [[Siege of Plze\u0148]] and it was not recaptured by Imperial troops until 1621. [[Albrecht von Wallenstein|Wallenstein]] made it his winter quarters in 1633. The town was unsuccessfully besieged by the [[Swedish Empire|Swedes]] in 1637 and 1648. The town and region have been staunchly Catholic despite the Hussite Wars.\n\nFrom the end of the 17th century, the architecture of Plze\u0148 has been influenced by the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style. The city centre has been under [[cultural heritage preservation]] since 1989.\n\n=== 19th century ===\nIn the second half of the 19th century Plze\u0148, already an important trade centre for [[Bohemia]], near the Bavarian/German border, began to industrialise rapidly. In 1869 [[Emil \u0160koda]] started up the [[\u0160koda Works]], which became the most important and influential engineering company in the country and a crucial supplier of arms to the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. By 1917 the [[\u0160koda Works]] employed over 30,000 workers. \n\nAfter 1898 the second largest employer was the National Railways train workshop, with about 2,000 employees: this was the largest rail repair shop in all [[Austria-Hungary]]. Between 1861 and 1877, the Plze\u0148 railway junction was completed and in 1899 the first tram line started in the city. This burst of industry had two important effects: the growth of the local [[Czechs|Czech]] ([[Slavs|Slavic]]) population and of the urban poor. After 1868 first Czech mayor of the city was elected.\n\n=== World War II ===\nFollowing [[Czechoslovak]] independence from [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1918 the German-speaking minority in the countryside bordering the city of Plze\u0148 hoped to be united with Austria and were unhappy at being included in Czechoslovakia. Many allied themselves to the [[Nazi]] cause after 1933, in the hope that [[Adolf Hitler]] might be able to unite them with their German-speaking neighbours.\n\nFollowing the [[Munich Agreement]] in 1938, Plze\u0148 became literally a frontier town, after the creation of the [[Sudetenland]] moved the [[Third Reich]] borders to the city's outer limits. During the [[Nazi]] occupation from 1939 to 1945 the [[\u0160koda Works]] in Pilsen was forced to provide armaments for the [[Wehrmacht]], and Czech contributions, particularly in the field of tanks, were noted.\n\nBetween 17 and 26 January 1942, over 2,000 Jewish inhabitants, most of Plze\u0148's Jewish population, were deported by the Nazis to the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]].\n\nThe German-speaking population was forcibly expelled from the city and indeed [[Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia|all of Czechoslovakia]] after the end of the war in 1945, according to the provisions of the [[Potsdam agreement]]. All of their property was confiscated.\n\nOn 6 May 1945, near the end of the [[Second World War]], Plze\u0148 was liberated from [[Nazi Germany]] by the [[16th Armored Division (United States)|16th Armored Division]] of General [[George S. Patton|Patton's]] [[U.S. Third Army|3rd Army]]. Also participating in the liberation of the city were elements of the 97th and 2nd Infantry Divisions supported by the Polish [[Holy Cross Mountains Brigade]]. Other Third Army units liberated major portions of Western Bohemia. The rest of [[Czechoslovakia]] was liberated from German control by the Soviet [[Red Army]]. Elements of the 3rd Army, as well as units from the 1st Army, remained in Plze\u0148 until late November 1945, assisting the Czechs with rebuilding.\n\n=== Communist era ===\nAfter the [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'\u00e9tat|Communist Party of Czechoslovakia coup of February 1948]], the Czechoslovak government launched a currency reform in 1953. This reform caused a wave of discontent, including the [[Uprising in Plze\u0148 (1953)|Plze\u0148 uprising]]. On 1 June 1953 over 20,000 people, mainly workers at the \u0160koda Works, began protesting against the government. Protesters forced their way into the town hall and threw communist symbols, furniture and other objects out of the windows. The protest caused a retaliation from the government; as part of their retaliation, they destroyed the statue of [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk]]. The statue has since been re-erected.\n\nThe next year, a West German homing pigeon was lost near the Czechoslovak border. It returned two days later, bearing a strong anti-communist message, signed \"Unbowed Pilsen.\" The bird, named [[Leaping Lena]], was taken to the United States where it was celebrated as a Cold War hero.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2 August 1954|title=Iron Curtain Bird Here on Crusade|page=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=23 August 1954|page=19|title=Heroine Pigeon Now a 'Citizen'}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Cummings|first=Richard H.|title=Radio Free Europe's \"Crusade for Freedom\"|pages=116\u2013117|year=2010|publisher=McFarland}}</ref>\n{{Historical populations\n|align=right\n|2005|162759\n|2006|163392\n|2007|165238\n|2008|169273\n|2009|169935\n|2010|168808\n|2011|167302\n|2012|167472\n|2013|168034\n|2014|169033\n}}\n\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"float:center;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" | '''Significant minority groups'''\n|-\n!

Plze\u0148 has low rainfall ({{convert|604|mm|0|abbr=on}} year average) evenly spread over the year. Precipitation occurs on average every second day, and the number of days with [[thunderstorm]]s is 19. It receives on average 1700 hours of sunshine though winters have longer periods without sunshine. Terrain features and a relatively low altitude ({{convert|290|to|390|metres|feet|abbr=on}}) give some shelter from strong winds. \n\nWinters are chilly but milder than some adjacent areas. Snow cover is erratic and lasts on average for 51 days. Though an average year has 113 days with minimum temperature below zero, the temperature falls below {{convert|-15|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} on 5 days. The record low temperatures is around {{convert|-20|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Winters are often murky with frequent long-standing haze. Spring is short, and in April to June there is blooming vegetation. Summer lasts from the end of May until the first third of September. During that period Plze\u0148 has [[Weather front|changeable weather]] which can be warm to hot. Temperatures are always above 5 degrees Celsius with nights between {{convert|8|to|18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and days between {{convert|16|to|35|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. Days are up to 16 hours long.\n\nPlze\u0148 can be hot, especially during heat waves originating in the southern [[Mediterranean]]. The number of hot days above {{convert|30|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} is steadily growing, with 5 months (late April \u2013 early September) of possible 30+ \u00b0C days. If hot weather does occur, it is often changes after a few weeks into cold and rainy weather with incoming Atlantic-based fronts. Nights can be unpleasantly cold even in summer, with high level of humidity. Winter frosts frequently occur from the second half of November to the end of March. February is the driest month with {{convert|32|mm|1|abbr=on}} of precipitation, and July the wettest with {{convert|80|mm|1|abbr=on}}. The only natural hazards are occasional fast changes of weather with negative consequences, e.g. floodings.\n\nExtreme values for years 2011 and 2012: \nAn extremely cold day of 2011 had {{convert|-7.6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} on average (23 February), {{convert|-0.7|to|-13.3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and extremely hot day {{convert|25.2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} on average (24 August, {{convert|19.5|to|32.8|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. The year 2012 had the coldest day on 12 February with minimum plummeting to {{convert|-22.1|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and maximum around {{convert|-3.7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} with average {{convert|-14.9|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.

The combination of pale colour from the new malts, Pilsen's remarkably soft water, [[Saaz hops|Saaz]] [[noble hops]] from nearby [[\u017datec]] (''Saaz'' in German) and Bavarian-style lagering produced a clear, golden beer which was regarded as a sensation.\nImproving transport meant that this new beer was soon available throughout Central Europe and {{lang|de|Pilsner Brauart}}-style brewing was widely imitated. \n\nIn 1859, \"Pilsner Bier\" was registered as a brand name at the Chamber of Commerce and Trade in Plze\u0148.
