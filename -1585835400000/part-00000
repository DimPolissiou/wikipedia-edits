{"title_page": "Fascism and ideology", "text_new": "{{fascism sidebar}}\n[[File:Propaganda.JPG|thumb|A Fascist propaganda poster featuring the [[Duce]] of Italy]]\nThe history of '''fascist ideology''' is long and it also involves many sources. Fascists took inspiration from sources as ancient as the [[Sparta]]ns for their focus on [[Racial hygiene|racial purity]] and their emphasis on rule by an elite minority. [[Fascism]] has also been connected to the ideals of [[Plato]], though there are key differences between the two. Fascism styled itself as the ideological successor to [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], particularly the [[Roman Empire]]. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]-era concept of a \"high and noble\" [[Aryan]] culture {{Dubious|date=November 2017}} as opposed to a \"parasitic\" [[Semitic culture]] was core to [[Nazism|Nazi]] racial views. From the same era, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s view on the absolute authority of the state also strongly influenced Fascist thinking. The [[French Revolution]] was a major influence insofar as the Nazis saw themselves as fighting back against many of the ideas which it brought to prominence, especially [[liberalism]], [[liberal democracy]] and [[racial equality]], whereas on the other hand Fascism drew heavily on the revolutionary ideal of [[nationalism]]. Common themes among fascist movements include; [[nationalism]] (including [[racial nationalism]]), [[hierarchy]] and [[elitism]], [[militarism]], [[Secular religion|quasi-religion]], [[masculinity]] and [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|voluntarism]]. Other aspects of fascism such as its \"myth of decadence\", anti\u2010egalitarianism and [[totalitarianism]] can be seen to originate from these ideas. These fundamental aspects however, can be attributed to a concept known as \"[[Palingenetic ultranationalism]]\", a theory proposed by [[Roger Griffin]], that fascism is a synthesis of totalitarianism and ultranationalism sacralized through myth of national rebirth and regeneration.\n\nIts relationship with other ideologies of its day was complex, often at once adversarial and focused on co-opting their more popular aspects. Fascists supported [[private property]] rights for Aryans and the [[profit motive]] of [[capitalism]], but sought to eliminate the autonomy of large-scale capitalism by bolstering private power with the state. They shared many of the goals of the [[conservatism|conservatives]] of their day and often allied themselves with them by drawing recruits from disaffected conservative ranks, but presented themselves as holding a more [[Modernism|modern]] ideology, with less focus on things like traditional [[religion]]. Fascism opposed the egalitarian ([[V\u00f6lkisch equality]]) and international character of mainstream [[socialism]], but sometimes sought to establish itself as an alternative [[Nazism|\"national\" socialism]]. It strongly opposed liberalism, [[communism]], [[anarchism]], and [[democratic socialism]].\n\n==Ideological origins==\n\n===Early influences (495 BC\u20131880 AD)===\n[[File:Hoplit.png|thumb|Depiction of a Greek Hoplite warrior, as ancient Sparta has been considered an inspiration for fascist and quasi-fascist movements, such as to [[Nazism]] and quasi-fascist [[Metaxism]]]]\nEarly influences that shaped the ideology of fascism have been dated back to [[Ancient Greece]].

Herder argued that the Germanic peoples held close racial connections with the ancient Indians and ancient Persians, who he claimed were advanced peoples possessing a great capacity for wisdom, nobility, restraint and science.{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=62}} Contemporaries of Herder utilized the concept of the Aryan race to draw a distinction between what they deemed \"high and noble\" Aryan culture versus that of \"parasitic\" Semitic culture and this anti-Semitic variant view of Europeans' Aryan roots formed the basis of Nazi racial views.{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=62}} Another major influence on fascism came from the political theories of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].<ref name=\"Contemporary Political Theory 2007.

These hopes faded when Hitler violated the Munich Agreement by ordering the invasion and partition of Czechoslovakia between Germany and a client state of [[Slovakia]] in 1939.

The war became prolonged contrary to Mussolini's plans resulting in Italy losing battles on multiple fronts and requiring German assistance. In 1941, the Axis campaign spread to the Soviet Union after Hitler launched [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Axis forces at the height of their power controlled almost all of continental Europe. By 1942, Nazi Germany annexed Poland to Germany and controlled vast sections of continental Europe, including the occupation of large portions of the [[Soviet Union]]. By 1942, Fascist Italy occupied and annexed [[Dalmatia]] from Yugoslavia, Corsica and [[Nice]] from France and controlled other territories. During World War II, the [[Axis Powers]] in Europe led by Nazi Germany participated in the extermination of millions of Jews and others in the [[genocide]] known as the [[Holocaust]]. In [[Asia]], Japan committed large massacres of Chinese civilians.\n\nAfter 1942, Axis forces began to falter. By 1943, after Italy faced multiple military failures, complete reliance and subordination of Italy to Germany and Allied invasion of Italy and corresponding international humiliation, Mussolini was removed as head of government and arrested by the order of King Victor Emmanuel III who proceeded to dismantle the Fascist state and declared Italy's switching of allegiance to the Allied side. Mussolini was rescued from arrest by German forces and led the German client state, the [[Italian Social Republic]] from 1943 to 1945.

Fascists took inspiration from sources as ancient as the [[Sparta]]ns for their focus on [[Racial hygiene|racial purity]] and their emphasis on rule by an elite minority. [[Fascism]] has also been connected to the ideals of [[Plato]], though there are key differences between the two. Fascism styled itself as the ideological successor to [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], particularly the [[Roman Empire]]. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]-era concept of a \"high and noble\" [[Aryan]] culture {{Dubious|date=November 2017}} as opposed to a \"parasitic\" [[Semitic culture]] was core to [[Nazism|Nazi]] racial views. From the same era, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s view on the absolute authority of the state also strongly influenced Fascist thinking. The [[French Revolution]] was a major influence insofar as the Nazis saw themselves as fighting back against many of the ideas which it brought to prominence, especially [[liberalism]], [[liberal democracy]] and [[racial equality]], whereas on the other hand Fascism drew heavily on the revolutionary ideal of [[nationalism]]. Common themes among fascist movements include; [[nationalism]] (including [[racial nationalism]]), [[hierarchy]] and [[elitism]], [[militarism]], [[Secular religion|quasi-religion]], [[masculinity]] and [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|voluntarism]]. Other aspects of fascism such as its \"myth of decadence\", anti\u2010egalitarianism and [[totalitarianism]] can be seen to originate from these ideas. These fundamental aspects however, can be attributed to a concept known as \"[[Palingenetic ultranationalism]]\", a theory proposed by [[Roger Griffin]], that fascism is a synthesis of totalitarianism and ultranationalism sacralized through myth of national rebirth and regeneration.\n\nIts relationship with other ideologies of its day was complex, often at once adversarial and focused on co-opting their more popular aspects. Fascists supported [[private property]] rights for Aryans and the [[profit motive]] of [[capitalism]], but sought to eliminate the autonomy of large-scale capitalism by bolstering private power with the state. They shared many of the goals of the [[conservatism|conservatives]] of their day and often allied themselves with them by drawing recruits from disaffected conservative ranks, but presented themselves as holding a more [[Modernism|modern]] ideology, with less focus on things like traditional [[religion]]. Fascism opposed the egalitarian ([[V\u00f6lkisch equality]]) and international character of mainstream [[socialism]], but sometimes sought to establish itself as an alternative [[Nazism|\"national\" socialism]]. It strongly opposed liberalism, [[communism]], [[anarchism]], and [[democratic socialism]].\n\n==Ideological origins==\n\n===Early influences (495 BC\u20131880 AD)===\n[[File:Hoplit.png|thumb|Depiction of a Greek Hoplite warrior, as ancient Sparta has been considered an inspiration for fascist and quasi-fascist movements, such as to [[Nazism]] and quasi-fascist [[Metaxism]]]]\nEarly influences that shaped the ideology of fascism have been dated back to [[Ancient Greece]].

These hopes faded when Hitler violated the Munich Agreement by ordering the invasion and partition of Czechoslovakia between Germany and a client state of [[Slovakia]] in 1939.

The war became prolonged contrary to Mussolini's plans resulting in Italy losing battles on multiple fronts and requiring German assistance. In 1941, the Axis campaign spread to the Soviet Union after Hitler launched [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Axis forces at the height of their power controlled almost all of continental Europe. By 1942, Nazi Germany annexed Poland to Germany and controlled vast sections of continental Europe, including the occupation of large portions of the [[Soviet Union]]. By 1942, Fascist Italy occupied and annexed [[Dalmatia]] from Yugoslavia, Corsica and [[Nice]] from France and controlled other territories. During World War II, the [[Axis Powers]] in Europe led by Nazi Germany participated in the extermination of millions of Jews and others in the [[genocide]] known as the [[Holocaust]]. In [[Asia]], Japan committed large massacres of Chinese civilians.\n\nAfter 1942, Axis forces began to falter. By 1943, after Italy faced multiple military failures, complete reliance and subordination of Italy to Germany and Allied invasion of Italy and corresponding international humiliation, Mussolini was removed as head of government and arrested by the order of King Victor Emmanuel III who proceeded to dismantle the Fascist state and declared Italy's switching of allegiance to the Allied side. Mussolini was rescued from arrest by German forces and led the German client state, the [[Italian Social Republic]] from 1943 to 1945.

Fascism was ,in the early days, sometimes perceived as less of a mortal rival to revolutionary Marxism than as a heresy from it. Mussolini's government was one of the first in Western Europe to diplomatically recognise the USSR, doing so in 1924.

He was the spiritual successor of 23rd [[tirthankara]] [[Parshvanatha]].{{sfn|Peter Heehs|2002|p=90}} Jain tradition holds that Mahavira was born in the early part of the 6th century BCE into a royal [[Kshatriya]] Jain family in present-day [[Bihar]], [[India]]. He abandoned all worldly possessions at the age of about 30 and left home in pursuit of [[spiritual awakening]], becoming an [[ascetic]]. Mahavira practiced intense meditation and severe austerities for 12 years, after which he is believed to have attained ''[[Kevala Jnana]]'' (omniscience). He preached for 30 years and is believed by Jains to have attained [[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]] (salvation) in the 6th century BC, although the year varies by [[Jain schools and branches|sect]].\n\nHistorically, Mahavira, who preached Jainism in ancient India, was a contemporary of [[Gautama Buddha]]. Scholars variously date him from 6th-4th century BCE and his place of birth is also a point of dispute among them.\n\nMahavira taught that observance of the vows of ''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]]'' (non-violence), ''[[satya]]'' (truth), ''[[asteya]]'' (non-stealing), ''[[brahmacharya]]'' (chastity), and ''[[aparigraha]]'' (non-attachment) are necessary for spiritual liberation. He taught the principles of ''[[Anekantavada]]'' (many-sided reality): ''[[Anekantavada#Sy\u0101dv\u0101da|syadvada]]'' and ''[[Anekantavada#Nayav\u0101da|nayavada]]''. Mahavira's teachings were compiled by [[Indrabhuti Gautama]] (his chief disciple) as the [[Jain Agamas]]. The texts, transmitted [[oral tradition|orally]] by Jain monks, are believed to have been largely lost by about the 1st century CE (when the remaining were first written down in the Svetambara tradition). The surviving versions of the Agamas taught by Mahavira are some of [[Svetambara]] Jainism's foundation texts, but their authenticity is disputed in [[Digambara]] Jainism.\n\nMahavira is usually depicted in a sitting or standing meditative posture, with the symbol of a lion beneath him. His earliest iconography is from archaeological sites in the [[North India]]n city of [[Mathura]], and is dated from the 1st century BCE to the 2nd century CE. His birth is celebrated as [[Mahavir Janma Kalyanak]] and his ''[[nirvana]]'' (salvation) is observed by Jains as [[Diwali (Jainism)|Diwali]].\n\n=={{anchor|Titles & Names}}Names and epithets==\nSurviving early Jain and Buddhist literature uses several names (or [[epithet]]s) for Mahavira, including ''Nayaputta'', ''Muni'', ''Samana'', ''Niggantha'', ''Bramhan'', and ''Bhagavan''.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=25}} In early Buddhist ''[[Sutra|suttas]]'', he is referred to as ''Araha'' (\"worthy\") and ''Veyavi'' (derived from \"Vedas\", but meaning \"wise\" in this context; Mahavira did not recognize the [[Vedas]] as scripture).{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=25\u201326}} He is known as ''[[Sramana]]'' in the ''[[Kalpa S\u016btra]]'', \"devoid of love and hate\".{{sfn|Heehs|2002|p=93}}\n\nAccording to later Jain texts, Mahavira's childhood name was ''Vardham\u0101na'' (\"the one who grows\") because of the kingdom's prosperity at the time of his birth.{{sfn|Kailash Chand Jain|1991|p=32}} According to the ''Kalpasutras'', he was called Mahavira (\"the great hero\") by the gods in the ''Kalpa S\u016btra'' because he remained steadfast in the midst of dangers, fears, hardships and calamities.{{sfn|Heehs|2002|p=93}} He is also known as a ''[[tirthankara]]''.{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=223}}\n\n==Historical Mahavira==\n[[File:Mahajanapadas (c. 500 BCE).png|alt=Map of India during the 6th century BCE|thumb|upright=1.15|Ancient kingdoms and cities of India at the time of Mahavira]]\nAlthough it is universally accepted by scholars of Jainism that Mahavira lived in ancient India, the details of his life and the year of his birth are subjects of debate.{{sfn|Potter|2007|pp=35\u201336}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=24\u201325}} According to the [[Digambara]] ''[[Uttarapurana]]'' text, Mahavira was born in Kundpur in the [[Kingdom of the Videhas]];{{sfn|Pannalal Jain|2015|p=460}} the [[\u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara]] ''Kalpa S\u016btra'' uses the name \"Kundagrama\",{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=25}}{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=682}} said to be located in present-day Bihar, India.

The Buddha taught the [[Middle Way]], rejecting the extremes of \"it is\" or \"it is not\"; Mahavira accepted both \"it is\" and \"it is not\", with reconciliation and the qualification of \"perhaps\".{{sfn|Matilal|1998|pp=128\u2013135}}\n\nThe Jain Agamas suggest that Mahavira's approach to answering [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]], philosophical questions was a \"qualified yes\" (''sy\u0101t'').

(...) Only by being reborn as a man can a woman engage in the ascetic path.

Parshvanatha, as the one who \"removes obstacles and has the capacity to save\", is a popular icon; his image is the focus of Jain temple devotion.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=30\u201333}} Of the 24 ''tirthankaras'', Jain iconography has celebrated Mahavira and Parshvanatha the most; sculptures discovered at the [[Mathura]] archaeological site have been dated to the 1st{{nbsp}}century BCE.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=30\u201333}}{{sfn|Umakant P.

He was the spiritual successor of 23rd [[tirthankara]] [[Parshvanatha]].{{sfn|Peter Heehs|2002|p=90}} Jain tradition holds that Mahavira was born in the early part of the 6th century BCE into a royal [[Kshatriya]] Jain family in present-day [[Bihar]], [[India]]. He abandoned all worldly possessions at the age of about 30 and left home in pursuit of [[spiritual awakening]], becoming an [[ascetic]]. Mahavira practiced intense meditation and severe austerities for 12 years, after which he is believed to have attained ''[[Kevala Jnana]]'' (omniscience). He preached for 30 years and is believed by Jains to have attained [[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]] (salvation) in the 6th century BC, although the year varies by [[Jain schools and branches|sect]].\n\nHistorically, Mahavira, who preached Jainism in ancient India, was a contemporary of [[Gautama Buddha]]. Scholars variously date him from 6th-4th century BCE and his place of birth is also a point of dispute among them.\n\nMahavira taught that observance of the vows of ''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]]'' (non-violence), ''[[satya]]'' (truth), ''[[asteya]]'' (non-stealing), ''[[brahmacharya]]'' (chastity), and ''[[aparigraha]]'' (non-attachment) are necessary for spiritual liberation. He taught the principles of ''[[Anekantavada]]'' (many-sided reality): ''[[Anekantavada#Sy\u0101dv\u0101da|syadvada]]'' and ''[[Anekantavada#Nayav\u0101da|nayavada]]''. Mahavira's teachings were compiled by [[Indrabhuti Gautama]] (his chief disciple) as the [[Jain Agamas]]. The texts, transmitted [[oral tradition|orally]] by Jain monks, are believed to have been largely lost by about the 1st century CE (when the remaining were first written down in the Svetambara tradition). The surviving versions of the Agamas taught by Mahavira are some of [[Svetambara]] Jainism's foundation texts, but their authenticity is disputed in [[Digambara]] Jainism.\n\nMahavira is usually depicted in a sitting or standing meditative posture, with the symbol of a lion beneath him. His earliest iconography is from archaeological sites in the [[North India]]n city of [[Mathura]], and is dated from the 1st century BCE to the 2nd century CE. His birth is celebrated as [[Mahavir Janma Kalyanak]] and his ''[[nirvana]]'' (salvation) is observed by Jains as [[Diwali (Jainism)|Diwali]].\n\n=={{anchor|Titles & Names}}Names and epithets==\nSurviving early Jain and Buddhist literature uses several names (or [[epithet]]s) for Mahavira, including ''Nayaputta'', ''Muni'', ''Samana'', ''Niggantha'', ''Bramhan'', and ''Bhagavan''.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=25}} In early Buddhist ''[[Sutra|suttas]]'', he is referred to as ''Araha'' (\"worthy\") and ''Veyavi'' (derived from \"Vedas\", but meaning \"wise\" in this context; Mahavira did not recognize the [[Vedas]] as scripture).{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=25\u201326}} He is known as ''[[Sramana]]'' in the ''[[Kalpa S\u016btra]]'', \"devoid of love and hate\".{{sfn|Heehs|2002|p=93}}\n\nAccording to later Jain texts, Mahavira's childhood name was ''Vardham\u0101na'' (\"the one who grows\") because of the kingdom's prosperity at the time of his birth.{{sfn|Kailash Chand Jain|1991|p=32}} According to the ''Kalpasutras'', he was called Mahavira (\"the great hero\") by the gods in the ''Kalpa S\u016btra'' because he remained steadfast in the midst of dangers, fears, hardships and calamities.{{sfn|Heehs|2002|p=93}} He is also known as a ''[[tirthankara]]''.{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=223}}\n\n==Historical Mahavira==\n[[File:Mahajanapadas (c. 500 BCE).png|alt=Map of India during the 6th century BCE|thumb|upright=1.15|Ancient kingdoms and cities of India at the time of Mahavira]]\nAlthough it is universally accepted by scholars of Jainism that Mahavira lived in ancient India, the details of his life and the year of his birth are subjects of debate.{{sfn|Potter|2007|pp=35\u201336}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=24\u201325}} According to the [[Digambara]] ''[[Uttarapurana]]'' text, Mahavira was born in Kundpur in the [[Kingdom of the Videhas]];{{sfn|Pannalal Jain|2015|p=460}} the [[\u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara]] ''Kalpa S\u016btra'' uses the name \"Kundagrama\",{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=25}}{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=682}} said to be located in present-day Bihar, India.

The Digambaras acknowledge that nineteen out of the twenty-four Tirthamkaras married and had children. If Mahavira also married it would make no difference. There is thus no reason whatsoever for the Digambaras to deny a simple incident like this. But there may be a reason for the Swetambaras making the assertion; the desire to ante-date their own origin. As a matter of fact their own books contain clear refutation of the statement that Mahavira had married.

Svetambara oppose this view by appealing to scriptures.\"{{sfn|Melton|Baumann|2010|p=1396}}}} According to this view, women are seen as a threat to a monk's chastity.{{sfn|Arvind Sharma|1994|pp=135\u2013138}}\n\nMahavirasvami had preached about men and women equality. The clothes-wearing Svetambaras have interpreted Mahavira's teaching as encouraging both sexes to pursue a mendicant, ascetic life with the possibility of ''moksha'' (''kaivalya'', spiritual liberation).{{sfn|Arvind Sharma|1994|pp=135\u2013138}}{{sfn|Harvey|2014|pp=182\u2013183}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=55\u201359}}\n\n=== Rebirth and realms of existence ===\n{{main|Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra (Jainism)}}\nRebirth and realms of existence are fundamental teachings of Mahavira. According to the [[Acaranga Sutra]], Mahavira believed that life existed in myriad forms which included animals, plants, insects, bodies of water, fire, and wind.{{sfn|Taylor|2008|pp=892\u2013894}}{{sfn|Chapelle|2011|pp=263\u2013270}} He taught that a monk should avoid touching or disturbing any of them (including plants) and never swim, light (or extinguish) a fire, or wave their arms in the air; such actions might injure other beings living in those states of matter.{{sfn|Taylor|2008|pp=892\u2013894}}\n\nMahavira preached that the nature of existence is cyclic, and the soul is reborn after death in one of the ''[[Trilok (Jainism)|trilok]]''{{snd}}the heavenly, hellish, or earthly realms of existence and suffering.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=41\u201342, 90\u201393}} Humans are reborn, depending on one's [[karma]] (actions) as a human, animal, element, microbe, or other form, on earth or in a heavenly (or hellish) realm.{{sfn|Taylor|2008|pp=892\u2013894}}{{sfn|Long|2009|pp=179\u2013181}}{{sfn|Gorski|2008|pp=125\u2013128}} Nothing is permanent; everyone (including gods, demons and earthly beings) dies and is reborn, based on their actions in their previous life.

The lack of detail and the mythical nature of legends about Parshvanatha,{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=220}}{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=16\u201317}} combined with medieval-era Svetambara texts portraying Parsvites as \"pseudo-ascetics\" with \"dubious practices of magic and astrology\", have led scholars to debate the evidence of Parshvanatha's historicity.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=30\u201333}} According to Dundas, Jains believe that Parshvanatha's lineage influenced Mahavira. Parshvanatha, as the one who \"removes obstacles and has the capacity to save\", is a popular icon; his image is the focus of Jain temple devotion.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=30\u201333}} Of the 24 ''tirthankaras'', Jain iconography has celebrated Mahavira and Parshvanatha the most; sculptures discovered at the [[Mathura]] archaeological site have been dated to the 1st{{nbsp}}century BCE.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=30\u201333}}{{sfn|Umakant P.

In other cases, members can contact anyone they have a connection to, and subsequently anyone that contact has a connection to, and so on.

The most basic of these are visible profiles with a list of \"friends\" who are also users of the site.<ref name=Boyd2007/> In an article entitled \"Social Network Sites: Definition, History, and Scholarship,\" Boyd and Ellison adopt Sunden's (2003) description of profiles as unique pages where one can \"type oneself into being\".<ref name=\"Boyd & Ellison 2007\"/> A profile is generated from answers to questions, such as age, location, interests, etc. Some sites allow users to upload pictures, add multimedia content or modify the look and feel of the profile. Others, e.g., Facebook, allow users to enhance their profile by adding modules or \"Applications\".<ref name=\"Boyd & Ellison 2007\"/> Many sites allow users to post blog entries, search for others with similar interests and compile and share lists of contacts. User profiles often have a section dedicated to comments from friends and other users. To protect user privacy, social networks typically have controls that allow users to choose who can view their profile, contact them, add them to their list of contacts, and so on.\n\n===Additional features===\nThere is a trend towards more [[Social network aggregation|interoperability between social networks]] led by technologies such as [[OpenID]] and [[OpenSocial]]. In most mobile communities, mobile phone users can now create their own profiles, make friends, participate in chat rooms, create chat rooms, hold private conversations, share photos and videos, and share blogs by using their mobile phone. Some companies provide wireless services that allow their customers to build their own mobile community and brand it; one of the most popular wireless services for social networking in [[North America]] and [[Nepal]] is Facebook Mobile.\n\n==Emerging trends==\n{{Rquote|right|The things you share are things that make you look good, things which you are happy to tie into your identity.|Hilary Mason, chief data scientist, [[bitly]]|{{nowrap|[[VentureBeat]], 2012}}<ref name=\"VentureBeat Byrne 2012\">{{cite news|last=Byrne|first=Ciara|title=What you read is not what you share|url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/08/23/bitly-realtime-hilary-mason/|accessdate=September 10, 2012|newspaper=[[VentureBeat]]|date=August 23, 2012}}</ref>}}\nWhile the popularity of social networking consistently rises,<ref>[http://www.google.com/trends?q=e-commerce%2C+social+networking&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=1 Search for \"e-commerce, social networking\"].

Real-time allows users to contribute contents, which is then broadcast as it is being uploaded\u2014the concept is analogous to live radio and television broadcasts. [[Twitter]] set the trend for \"real-time\" services, wherein users can broadcast to the world what they are doing, or what is on their minds within a 140-character limit. [[Facebook]] followed suit with their \"Live Feed\" where users' activities are streamed as soon as it happens. While Twitter focuses on words, [[Clixtr]], another real-time service, focuses on group photo sharing wherein users can update their photo streams with photos while at an event. Facebook, however, remains the largest photo sharing site\u2014Facebook application and photo aggregator Pixable estimates that Facebook will have 100 billion photos by Summer 2012.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sarah Kessler|url=http://mashable.com/2011/02/14/facebook-photo-infographic/?asid=c228f21b |title=Facebook Photos By the Numbers [INFOGRAPHIC]|publisher=[[Mashable]]|date=February 14, 2011 |accessdate=August 7, 2013}}</ref> In April 2012, the image-based social media network [[Pinterest]] had become the third largest social network in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2012/04/06/pinterest-number-3-social-network/|title=Pinterest is Now the No. 3 Social Network in the U.S. [STUDY]|first=Todd|last=Wasserman|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nCompanies have begun to merge business technologies and solutions, such as [[cloud computing]], with social networking concepts. Instead of connecting individuals based on social interest, companies are developing interactive communities that connect individuals based on shared business needs or experiences. Many provide specialized networking tools and [[Application software|applications]] that can be accessed via their websites, such as [[LinkedIn]]. Others companies, such as [[Monster.com]], have been steadily developing a more \"socialized\" feel to their career center sites to harness some of the power of social networking sites. These more business related sites have their own nomenclature for the most part but the most common naming conventions are \"Vocational Networking Sites\" or \"Vocational Media Networks\", with the former more closely tied to individual networking relationships based on social networking principles.\n\n[[Foursquare (service)|Foursquare]] gained popularity as it allowed for users to check into places that they are frequenting at that moment. [[Gowalla]] is another such service that functions in much the same way that Foursquare does, leveraging the [[GPS]] in phones to create a location-based user experience. Clixtr, though in the real-time space, is also a location-based social networking site, since events created by users are automatically geotagged, and users can view events occurring nearby through the Clixtr [[iPhone]] app. Recently, [[Yelp, Inc.|Yelp]] announced its entrance into the location-based social networking space through check-ins with their mobile app; whether or not this becomes detrimental to Foursquare or Gowalla is yet to be seen, as it is still considered a new space in the Internet technology industry.<ref>{{cite web|author=MG Siegler |url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/15/yelp-iphone-app-4-check-ins/ |title=Yelp Enables Check-Ins On Its iPhone App; Foursquare, Gowalla Ousted As Mayors |publisher=Techcrunch.com |date=January 15, 2010 |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOne popular use for this new technology is social networking between businesses. Companies have found that social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are great ways to build their brand image. According to Jody Nimetz, author of Marketing Jive,<ref name=\"marketing-jive.com\">Nimetz, Jody. [http://www.marketing-jive.com/2007/11/jody-nimetz-on-emerging-trends-in-b2b.html \"Jody Nimetz on Emerging Trends in B2B Social Networking\"]. Marketing-Jive, November 18, 2007. Retrieved October 26, 2009.</ref> there are five major uses for businesses and social media: to create brand awareness, as an online [[reputation management]] tool, for recruiting, to learn about new technologies and competitors, and as a [[lead generation]] tool to intercept potential prospects.<ref name=\"marketing-jive.com\"/> These companies are able to drive traffic to their own online sites while encouraging their consumers and clients to have discussions on how to improve or change products or services. As of September 2013, 71% of online adults use Facebook, 17% use Instagram, 21% use Pinterest, and 22% use LinkedIn.<ref>{{cite web|date=Oct 23, 2014|title=Social Networking Fact Sheet|publisher=[[Pew Research]]|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/social-networking-fact-sheet/}}</ref>\n\n===Niche networks===\nIn 2012, it was reported that in the past few years, the niche social network has steadily grown in popularity, thanks to better levels of user interaction and engagement. In 2012, a survey by Reuters and research firm Ipsos<ref>{{cite news|date=Jan 4, 2012|title=Facebook comments, ads don't sway most users|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/05/net-us-facebook-survey-idUSBRE85400C20120605/}}</ref>\nfound that one in three users were getting bored with Facebook and in 2014 the GlobalWebIndex found that this figured had risen to almost 50%. The niche social network offers a specialized space that's designed to appeal to a very specific market with a clearly defined set of needs. Where once the streams of social minutia on networks such as Facebook and Twitter were the ultimate in online voyeurism, now users are looking for connections, community and shared experiences. Social networks that tap directly into specific activities, hobbies, tastes, and lifestyles are seeing a consistent rise in popularity. Niche social networks such as [[Fishbrain]] for [[fishing]] and [[Strava]] for [[cycling]]. These social platforms offer brands a rich space in which to engage with their target market and build awareness.\n\n===Science===\nOne other use that is being discussed is the use of social networks in the science communities. Julia Porter Liebeskind et al. have published a study on how new biotechnology firms are using social networking sites to share exchanges in scientific knowledge.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Liebeskind |first1=Julia Porter |last2=Oliver |first2=Amalya Lumerman |last3=Zucker |first3=Lynne |last4=Brewer |first4=Marilynn |title=Social Networks, Learning, and Flexibility: Sourcing Scientific Knowledge in New Biotechnology Firms |journal=Organization Science |date=1996 |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=428\u2013443 |jstor=2635102 |doi=10.1287/orsc.7.4.428 |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4480h6s7 }}</ref> They state in their study that by sharing information and knowledge with one another, they are able to \"increase both their learning and their flexibility in ways that would not have been possible within a self-contained hierarchical organization\". Social networking is allowing scientific groups to expand their knowledge base and share ideas, and without these new means of communicating their theories might become \"isolated and irrelevant\". Researchers use social networks frequently to maintain and develop professional relationships.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bianchini|first=Laurence|title=Social Networks for Scientists|url=https://www.mysciencework.com/news/6400/social-networks-for-scientists|publisher=MyScienceWork|accessdate=April 22, 2014|date=May 14, 2012}}</ref> They are interested in consolidating social ties and professional contact, keeping in touch with friends and colleagues and seeing what their own contacts are doing.

Social networks like [[Academia.edu]], [[LinkedIn]], [[Facebook]], and [[ResearchGate]] give the possibility to join professional groups and pages, to share papers and results, publicize events, to discuss issues and create debates.<ref name=\"Ferri F. 2012 pp. 121-137\"/> Academia.edu is extensively used by researchers, where they follow a combination of social networking and scholarly norms.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Thelwall |first1=Mike |last2=Kousha |first2=Kayvan |title=Academia.edu: Social network or Academic Network? |journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology |date=April 2014 |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=721\u2013731 |doi=10.1002/asi.23038 |hdl=2436/621523 |url=http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/~cm1993/papers/Academia_preprint.pdf}}</ref> ResearchGate is also widely used by researchers, especially to disseminate and discuss their publications,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Thelwall |first1=Mike |last2=Kousha |first2=Kayvan |title=ResearchGate: Disseminating, communicating, and measuring Scholarship? |journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology |date=May 2015 |volume=66 |issue=5 |pages=876\u2013889 |doi=10.1002/asi.23236 |citeseerx=10.1.1.589.5396 }}</ref> where it seems to attract an audience that it wider than just other scientists.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Thelwall |first1=Mike |last2=Kousha |first2=Kayvan |title=ResearchGate articles: Age, discipline, audience size, and impact |journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology |date=February 2017 |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=468\u2013479 |doi=10.1002/asi.23675 |hdl=2436/609261 }}</ref> The usage of Research Gate and Academia in different academic communities has increasingly been studied in recent years.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Manca |first1=Stefania |title=ResearchGate and Academia.edu as networked socio-technical systems for scholarly communication: a literature review |journal=Research in Learning Technology |date=20 February 2018 |volume=26 |doi=10.25304/rlt.v26.2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Education===\n[[File:Two competitions for ESO's 50th anniversary.jpg|thumb|The [[European Southern Observatory]] uses social networks to engage people in astronomical observations.<ref>{{cite news|title=Choose What the VLT Observes & Tweet Your Way to the VLT!|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1232/|accessdate=August 8, 2012|newspaper=ESO Press Release}}</ref>]]\n\nThe advent of social networking platforms may also be impacting the way(s) in which learners engage with technology in general. For a number of years, Prensky's (2001) dichotomy between [[Digital Natives]] and Digital Immigrants has been considered a relatively accurate representation of the ease with which people of a certain age range\u2014in particular those born before and after 1980\u2014use technology. Prensky's theory has been largely disproved, however, and not least on account of the burgeoning popularity of social networking sites and other metaphors such as White and Le Cornu's \"Visitors\" and \"Residents\" (2011) are greater currency. The use of online social networks by school libraries is also increasingly prevalent and they are being used to communicate with potential library users, as well as extending the services provided by individual school libraries. Social networks and their educational uses are of interest to many researchers. According to Livingstone and Brake (2010), \"[[Social networking sites]], like much else on the Internet, represent a moving target for researchers and policymakers.\"<ref name=group>{{cite journal|last=Livingstone|first=Sonia|author2=Brake, David R |title=On the Rapid Rise of Social Networking Sites: New Findings and Policy Implications|journal=Children & Society|date=December 2010|volume=24|issue=1|pages=75\u201383|doi=10.1111/j.1099-0860.2009.00243.x|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/30124/1/On_the_rapid_rise_of_social_networking_(LSERO_version).pdf|accessdate=July 16, 2012}}</ref> Pew Research Center project, called Pew Internet, did a USA-wide survey in 2009 and in 2010 February published that 47% of American adults use a social networking website.<ref name=Lenhart>{{Cite book\n| publisher = Pew Internet & American Life Project\n| last = Lenhart\n| first = Amanda\n| first2 = Kristen\n| last2 = Purcell\n| first3 = Aaron\n| last3 = Smith\n| first4 = Kathryn\n| last4 = Zickuhr\n| title = Social Media & Mobile Internet Use Among Teens and Young Adults.

However, there are constraints in this area. Researches, especially in Africa, have disclosed that the use of social networks among students has been known to affect their academic life negatively. This is buttressed by the fact that their use constitutes distractions, as well as that the students tend to invest a good deal of time in the use of such technologies.\n\nAlbayrak and Yildirim (2015) examined the educational use of social networking sites. They investigated students' involvement in Facebook as a Course Management System (CMS) and the findings of their study support that Facebook as a CMS has the potential to increase student involvement in discussions and out-of-class communication among instructors and students.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albayrak | first1 = D. | last2 = Yildirim | first2 = Z | year = 2015 | title = Using Social Networking Sites for Teaching and Learning: Students' Involvement in and Acceptance of Facebook as a Course Management System | journal = Journal of Educational Computing Research | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 155\u2013179 | doi = 10.1177/0735633115571299 | hdl = 11693/23247 }}</ref>\n\n====Professional use====\nProfessional use of social networking services refers to the employment of a network site to connect with other professionals within a given field of interest. SNSs like [[LinkedIn]], a social networking website geared towards companies and industry professionals looking to make new business contacts or keep in touch with previous co-workers, affiliates, and clients. LinkedIn not only provides a professional social use but also encourages people to inject their personality into their profile\u2013making it more personal than a resume.<ref>{{cite web|last=Arruda |first=William |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamarruda/2014/03/04/22-linkedin-secrets-linkedin-wont-tell-you/ |title=22 LinkedIn Secrets LinkedIn Won't Tell You |work=Forbes |date=March 4, 2014 |accessdate=October 17, 2015}}</ref> Now the other network sites are also being used in this manner.

More and more relationships and friendships are being formed online and then carried to an offline setting. Psychologist and University of Hamburg professor Erich H. Witte says that relationships which start online are much more likely to succeed. In this regard, there are studies which predict tie strength among the friends<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kaushal |first1=R. |title=Tie strength prediction in OSN |journal=2016 3rd International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom) |date=2016 |pages=841\u2013844 |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7724383|isbn=978-9-3805-4421-2 }}</ref> on social networking websites.  One online dating site claims that 2% of all marriages begin at its site, the equivalent of 236 marriages a day. Other sites claim one in five relationships begin online.\n\nUsers do not necessarily share with others the content which is of most interest to them, but rather that which projects a good impression of themselves.<ref name=\"VentureBeat Byrne 2012\"/> While everyone agrees that social networking has had a significant impact on social interaction, there remains a substantial disagreement as to whether the nature of this impact is completely positive. A number of scholars have done research on the negative effects of Internet communication as well. These researchers have contended that this form of communication is an impoverished version of conventional face-to-face social interactions, and therefore produce negative outcomes such as loneliness and depression for users who rely on social networking entirely. By engaging solely in online communication, interactions between communities, families, and other social groups are weakened.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bargh |first1=John A. |last2=McKenna |first2=Katelyn Y.

Users of these services also need to be aware of [[Computer insecurity|data theft]] or [[computer virus|viruses]]. However, large services, such as [[MySpace|Myspace]] and [[Netlog]], often work with law enforcement to try to prevent such incidents.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}} In addition, there is a perceived privacy threat in relation to placing too much personal information in the hands of large corporations or governmental bodies, allowing a profile to be produced on an individual's behavior on which decisions, detrimental to an individual, may be taken. Furthermore, there is an issue over the control of data and information that was altered or removed by the user may, in fact, be retained and passed to third parties. This danger was highlighted when the controversial social networking site [[Quechup]] harvested e-mail addresses from users' e-mail accounts for use in a [[e-mail spam|spamming]] operation.<ref>[http://www.e-consultancy.com/news-blog/364182/social-network-launches-worldwide-spam-campaign.html Social network launches worldwide spam campaign] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909161205/http://www.e-consultancy.com/news-blog/364182/social-network-launches-worldwide-spam-campaign.html |date=September 9, 2007 }} E-consultancy.com.

It is not clear whether the same rules apply to researchers who collect data from social networking sites. These sites often contain a great deal of data that is hard to obtain via traditional means. Even though the data are public, republishing it in a research paper might be considered [[invasion of privacy]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moreno |first1=M. A. |last2=Fost |first2=N.

These would involve \"friending\" and \"following\" large numbers of random people to thwart attempts at network analysis. Privacy concerns have been found to differ between users according to gender and personality. Women are less likely to publish information that reveals methods of contacting them. Personality measures [[Openness to experience|openness]], [[Extraversion and introversion|extraversion]], and [[conscientiousness]] were found to positively affect the willingness to disclose data, while [[neuroticism]] decreases the willingness to disclose personal information.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-39062-3_11 |chapter=The Impact of User Diversity on the Willingness to Disclose Personal Information in Social Network Services |title=Human Factors in Computing and Informatics |volume=7946 |pages=174\u2013193 |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |year=2013 |last1=Schaar |first1=Anne Kathrin |last2=Calero Valdez |first2=Andr\u00e9 |last3=Ziefle |first3=Martina |isbn=978-3-642-39061-6 |chapter-url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4284b110f431910cf4ec72e1add50844f7a45f37 }}</ref>\n\nAnother debate lies in the design of [[algorithm]]ic<nowiki/>systems to target specific audiences on social networking sites. With multiple formats for marketing, [[Facebook]] offers a variety of direct marketing options for advertisers to reach their intended audience. For example, these ads may appear as suggested ad posts on the home [[News Feed (Facebook)|News Feed]] or on the right side of the feed as a banner. Businesses may create a page to outline their company and post related information, promotions and contact information to it, directly reaching their interested audience. Users who \"like\" a business page will be subscribed to receive these business' updates on their home News Feed. Banner ads and suggested posts are paid for by marketers and advertisers to reach their intended audience.<ref name=\"Morris et al 2016\">{{cite journal |last1=Morris |first1=Jon D. |last2=Choi |first2=Yunmi |last3=Ju |first3=Ilyoung |title=Are Social Marketing and Advertising Communications (SMACs) Meaningful?: A Survey of Facebook User Emotional Responses, Source Credibility, Personal Relevance, and Perceived Intrusiveness |journal=Journal of Current Issues & Research in Advertising |date=25 May 2016 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=165\u2013182 |doi=10.1080/10641734.2016.1171182 }}</ref> Like other methods of marketing, emotional connections are critical to reaching the user. From the fourth quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2013, Facebook increased its [[advertising]] click-through rate by 365%, having 2.5 million promoted suggested posts on user's news feeds.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://expandedramblings.com/index.php/facebook-advertising-statistics/|title=135 Amazing Facebook Advertising Statistics|date=March 13, 2014|work=DMR|access-date=April 12, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> This surge of posts resulted in an influx of information that was difficult to organize. A study of the emotional responses to advertising on Facebook found that Business Pages found the highest appeal to users because they were only recommended when liked by the user or the user's friends. \u201cLiked\u201d pages have higher credibility to users. However, a change in algorithm announced on April 10, 2014, said that Business Pages were receiving a reduced reach after engaging in \u201cclick bait\u201d tactics (fooling users to click links to things other than what discretely said on Facebook). The quantity of engagement on Facebook posts are measured, relaying important information about the user audience and their actions online.<ref name=\"Morris et al 2016\"/>\n\nThe debate questions to what extent the design of these systems is compromising the needs, privacy and information of the users. More research is needed to evaluate if allowing advertising to access user information to specifically tailor content to their choices and interactions, for example by placing ads within their personal feeds and throughout their use of the site, is compromising the user's information and social wellbeing. John Herrman (2018) compares the function of algorithms in adjusting content to omniscience and recounts the unpleasant experiences that coincide as a result. He calls to web browsing on Amazon, where products he browsed through briefly reappear on other news feeds, including his Instagram feed. He outlines the experience as if the networks \u201c[have] got eyes everywhere,\u201d and suggests that this looming omniscience may alter how we interact online, even \u201crisk driving away followers in the process.\u201d This may deter users from engaging in social interactions online and points to how much advertisers are able to tailor information to their intended audience.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Algorithmic surveillance has put humanity in touch with a new sort of omniscience -- the kind we can fool.|last=|first=|date=|work=New York Times Magazine|access-date=}}</ref> This debate was further ignited in early 2018.

Facebook's controversial \"Social Ads\" program gives companies access to the millions of profiles in order to tailor their ads to a Facebook user's own interests and hobbies. However, rather than sell actual user information, Facebook sells tracked \"social actions\". That is, they track the websites a user uses outside of Facebook through a program called [[Facebook Beacon]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Elkins|first=Sarah|title=A Social Network's Faux Pas?|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2007/11/08/a-social-network-s-faux-pas.html|work=Newsweek|date=2007-11-09}}</ref>\n\n===Notifications ===\nThere has been a trend for social networking sites to send out only \"positive\" notifications to users. For example, sites such as Bebo, Facebook, and MySpace will not send notifications to users when they are removed from a person's friends list. Likewise, Bebo will send out a notification if a user is moved to the top of another user's friends list but no notification is sent if they are moved down the list. This allows users to purge undesirables from their list extremely easily and often without confrontation since a user will rarely notice if one person disappears from their friends list. It also enforces the general positive atmosphere of the website without drawing attention to unpleasant happenings such as friends falling out, rejection and failed relationships.\n\n===Access to information===\n{{See also|Unauthorized access in online social networks}}\n\nMany social networking services, such as [[Facebook]], provide the user with a choice of who can view their profile. This is supposed to prevent unauthorized users from accessing their information.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} Parents who want to access their child's MySpace or Facebook account have become a big problem for teenagers who do not want their profile seen by their parents. By making their profile private, teens can select who may see their page, allowing only people added as \"friends\" to view their profile and preventing unwanted viewing of the profile by parents. Most teens are constantly trying to create a structural barrier between their private life and their parents.<ref name=Boyd2007/> To edit information on a certain social networking service account, the social networking sites require you to [[login|log in]] or provide a [[password]]. This is designed to prevent unauthorized users from adding, changing, or removing personal information, pictures, or other data.\n\n===Impact on employability===\nSocial networking sites have created issues among getting hired for jobs and losing jobs because of exposing inappropriate content, posting photos of embarrassing situations or posting comments that contain potentially offensive comments (e.g., racist, homophobic or defamatory comments), or even political comments that are contrary to those of the employer. There are works which recommend friends to social networking users based on their political opinions.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1109/ANTS.2015.7413659 |chapter=PoliticAlly: Finding political friends on twitter |title=2015 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommuncations Systems (ANTS) |pages=1\u20133 |year=2015 |last1=Jain |first1=Suchita |last2=Sharma |first2=Vanya |last3=Kaushal |first3=Rishabh |isbn=978-1-5090-0293-1 }}</ref> Many people use social networking sites to express their personal opinions about current events and news issues to their friends. If a potential applicant expresses personal opinions on political issues or makes potentially embarrassing posts online on a publicly available social networking platform, employers can access their employees' and applicants' profiles, and judge them based on their social behavior or political views. According to ''Silicon Republic's'' statistics, 17,000 young people in six countries were interviewed in a survey. 1 in 10 people aged 16 to 34 have been rejected for a job because of comments made on an online profile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconrepublic.com/careers/item/32880-1-in-10-young-people-losing|title=1 in 10 young people losing out on jobs because of pics and comments on social media|work=Silicon Republic}}</ref> This shows the effects that social networks have had on people's lives. There have been numerous cases where employees have lost jobs because their opinions represented their companies negatively. In September 2013, a woman got fired over Facebook because she posted disruptive information about her company stating that military patrons should not receive special treatment or discounts. A manager of the company found her opinion online, disagreed with it, and fired her because it went against the company's mission statement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcbtv.com/story/23548618/facebook-flub-woman-gets-fired-over-post|title=Facebook flub: woman gets fired over post|author=NBC News|date=September 27, 2013|work=wrcbtv.com}}</ref> In November 2012, a woman posted a racist remark about the President of the United States and mentioned a possible assassination.

In April 2011, a Lloyd's banking group employee in the United Kingdom was fired for making a sarcastic post about the higher salary of her boss in relation to hers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/bank-worker-stephanie-bon-fired-after-criticising-lloyds-bank-bosss-6295-an-hour-salary/story-e6frfm9r-1226034503421|title=Stephanie Bon fired for sarcastic Facebook post on Lloyds TSB CEO's \u00a34000-an-hour salary|work=NewsComAu|date=April 5, 2011}}</ref> In February 2013 there was another case where a flight attendant working for a Russian airline lost her job because she posted a photo of herself giving the middle finger to a plane full of passengers.

In March 2012, Facebook decided they might take legal action against employers for gaining access to employee's profiles through their passwords.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2012/03/23/facebook-says-it-may-launch-legal-action-against-employers-who-ask-for-user-passwords/|title=Facebook May Take Legal Action Over Employer Password Requests|author=Matt Brian|work=The Next Web|date=2012-03-23}}</ref> According to Facebook Chief Privacy Officer for policy, Erin Egan, the company has worked hard to give its users the tools to control who sees their information. He also said users shouldn't be forced to share private information and communications just to get a job. According to the network's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, sharing or soliciting a password is a violation to Facebook. Employees may still give their password information out to get a job, but according to Erin Egan, Facebook will continue to do their part to protect the privacy and security of their users.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=326598317390057|title=Protecting Your Passwords and Your Privacy|work=facebook.com}}</ref>\n\n===Potential for misuse===\nThe relative freedom afforded by social networking services has caused concern regarding the potential of its misuse by individual patrons. In October 2006, a fake [[MySpace]] profile created in the name of Josh Evans by Lori Janine Drew led to the suicide of [[Suicide of Megan Meier|Megan Meier]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,21775032-11869,00.html |title=Fatal MySpace internet hoax mother is charged, ''Herald Sun'', 17 May 2008 |work=News.com.au |date=May 22, 2007 |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=October 2011}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Story?id=3882520 |title=Parents: Cyber Bullying Led to Teen's Suicide: Megan Meier's Parents Now Want Measures to Protect Children Online |date=November 29, 2007 |publisher=ABC News }}</ref> The event incited global concern regarding the use of social networking services for bullying purposes. In July 2008, a Briton and a former friend was ordered to pay a total of GBP \u00a322,000 (about US$44,000) for libel and breach of privacy. He had posted a fake page on [[Facebook]] purporting to be that of a former school friend Matthew Firsht, with whom he had fallen out in 2000. The page falsely claimed that Firsht was homosexual and that he was dishonest.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nAt the same time, genuine use of social networking services has been treated with suspicion on the ground of the services' misuse. In September 2008, the profile of Australian Facebook user Elmo Keep was banned by the site's administrators on the grounds that it violated the site's terms of use. Keep is one of several users of Facebook who were banned from the site on the presumption that their names aren't real, as they bear resemblance to the names of characters like [[Sesame Street]]'s Elmo.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/biztech/banned-for-keeps-on-facebook-for-odd-name/2008/09/25/1222217399252.html |title=Banned for keeps on Facebook for odd name, ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 24 September 2008 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=September 25, 2008 |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOnline social networks have also become a platform for spread of rumors, one such study has analyzed rumors in retrospect.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1109/ANTS.2015.7413660 |chapter=Rumor detection in twitter: An analysis in retrospect |title=2015 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommuncations Systems (ANTS) |pages=1\u20133 |year=2015 |last1=Dayani |first1=Raveena |last2=Chhabra |first2=Nikita |last3=Kadian |first3=Taruna |last4=Kaushal |first4=Rishabh |isbn=978-1-5090-0293-1 }}</ref> One of the approaches to detect rumors (or misinformation)<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732347 |chapter=Towards automated real-time detection of misinformation on Twitter |title=2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI) |pages=2015\u20132020 |year=2016 |last1=Jain |first1=Suchita |last2=Sharma |first2=Vanya |last3=Kaushal |first3=Rishabh |isbn=978-1-5090-2029-4 }}</ref> is to compare the spread of topic over social network (say Twitter) with those spread by reliable and authorized news agencies.\n\n===Unauthorized access===\nThere are different forms where user data in social networks are accessed and updated without a user's permission.

According to the article, High Tech or High Risks: Moral Panics About Girls Online, it suggests that young girls are more at risks because they are often represented through \"products of play\" in transgressive poses because they often manipulate other users online by making themselves look older than what they actually appear which can attract sexual predators.

Such actions are often referred to as \"trolling\". Confrontations in the [[reality|real world]] can also be transferred to the online world. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Trolling can occur in many different forms, such as (but not limited to) defacement of deceased person(s) tribute pages, name-calling, playing online pranks on individuals and making [[Flame bait|controversial or inflammatory comments with the intention to cause anger and cause arguments]]. Individuals troll for many reasons. The psychology behind why people troll according to ''[[Psychology Today]]'' is due to anonymity, perceived obscurity, and a perceived lack of consequences for online misbehavior. Trolls may also do their activities due to a perceived majority status, social identity salience and due to a sense by the troll that she or he is surrounded by online 'friends'. Trolls may also engage in harmful acts due to desensitization or negative personality traits (Fox, 2014).<ref>{{cite web|last=Fox|first= J. |year=2014|title= Why the Online Trolls Troll|url= https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/better-living-technology/201408/why-the-online-trolls-troll|website=psychologytoday.com}} Last accessed April 25, 2016.</ref> As these eight reasons behind the thought processes of trolls suggest individuals thrive behind being able to create a false identity or pseudonym to hide behind and the premise that they have 'friends' on social networks that agree with their outlook on certain topics, thus join in on trolling. The reason for the perceived lack of consequences is that they believe they have created an identity in which they can not be seen as a real life human and more of a persona/[[avatar]] that they have created, which leads them to feel that they will not face the consequences of being an online troll.\n\nTrolling is a prominent issue in the 2010s, and as the Internet and social media is consistently expanding and more individuals sign up to social networking sites, more people come under fire and become the target of trolls. As more people sign up to social networking sites, more celebrities are also becoming more prominent on these sites. With a variety of celebrities joining social networking sites, trolls tend to target abuse towards them. With some famous people gaining an influx of negative comments and slew of abuse from trolls it causes them to 'quit' social media. One prime example of a celebrity quitting social media is [[Stephen Fry]]. He left Twitter due to \"too much aggression and unkindness around\" emphasizing how trolls can negatively impact people's lives (Cohen, 2014).<ref>{{cite news|last=Cohen|first= C. |year=2014|title= Twitter trolls: The celebrities who've been driven off social media by abuse|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11238018/Celebrity-Twitter-trolls-The-famous-people-whove-been-driven-off-social-media-by-abuse.html|work=telegraph.co.uk}} Last accessed April 25, 2016.</ref> As celebrities face trolls and backlash on social media forcing them to quit, it can mean that they become less in touch with their fans, potentially losing a fan base, as they are not as relevant as people enjoy interacting with celebrities and makes them feel as though they are valued. As trolling can lead to celebrities deleting their social networks such as Twitter, it emphasizes how trolls can win, and can ruin people's lives.\n\nWhile trolls believe that they do not face consequences and can troll others on the Internet without repercussions, in the 2000s, due to high-profile cases where cyberbullies have allegedly been factors in [[suicides attributed to bullying]], more laws have been put in place by governments. Trolls can face going to prison for certain actions that they take on the Internet, such as spreading [[hate speech]] such as racist messages. One of the highest profile cases is racist trolling. Racist trolling has seen individuals been sent to prison for Tweets they have sent that to them may have seemed harmless and not racist. One case of this in recent years is Liam Stacey who was jailed for fifty-six days for tweeting offensive messages such as 'Muamba is dead, hahahaha', referring to when footballer [[Fabrice Muamba]] collapsed during a professional football game for Bolton Wanders (Williams, 2012).<ref>{{cite news|last=Williams|first= Z. |year=2012|title= What is an Internet Troll?|url= https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jun/12/what-is-an-internet-troll|work=theguardian.com}} Last accessed April 25, 2016.</ref> This highlights how offensive tweets and messages sent on any social networking platform does have repercussions for individuals and they have to be aware that they have to face the consequences of their actions.\n\n===Online bullying===\nOnline bullying, also called [[cyberbullying]], is a relatively common occurrence and it can often result in emotional trauma for the victim. Depending on the networking outlet, up to 39% of users admit to being \"cyber-bullied\".<ref>''Computer Science Illuminated''</ref> In her article, \"Why Youth (Heart) Social Network Sites\", [[danah boyd]], published in December 2007, a researcher of social networks, quotes a teenager. The teenager expresses frustration towards networking sites like MySpace because it causes drama and too much emotional stress.<ref name=Boyd2007/> There are not many limitations as to what individuals can post when online. Individuals are given the power to post offensive remarks or pictures that could potentially cause a great amount of emotional pain for another individual.\n\n===Interpersonal communication===\nInterpersonal communication has been a growing issue as more and more people have turned to social networking as a means of communication. \"Benniger (1987) describes how mass media has gradually replaced interpersonal communication as a socializing force. Further, social networking sites have become popular sites for youth culture to explore themselves, relationships, and share cultural artifacts\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/1394/1312#note4 | title=A Privacy Paradox}}</ref>\n\nThe convenience that social network sites give users to communicate with one another can also damage their interpersonal communication. Sherry Turkle, the founder and director of the MIT Initiative on Technology and Self, stated, \"Networked, we are together, but so lessened are our expectations of each other that we feel utterly alone. And there is the risk that we come to see others as objects to be accessed--and only for the parts we find useful, comforting, or amusing\".<ref>{{cite book |last= Turkle |first= Sherry |title= Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other |publisher= [[Basic Books]] |year= 2011 |page=154 |isbn= 978-0-465-02234-2}}</ref> Furthermore, social network sites can create insincere friendships, Turkle also noted, \"They nurture friendships on social-networking sites and then wonder if they are among friends. They become confused about companionship\".<ref>{{cite book |last= Turkle |first= Sherry |title= Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other |publisher= [[Basic Books]] |year= 2011 |page=17 |isbn= 978-0-465-02234-2}}</ref>\n\n===Psychological effects of social networking===\n<!-- [[Social network addiction]] links to this section -->\nAs social networking sites have risen in popularity over the past years, people have been spending an excessive amount of time on the Internet in general and social networking sites in specific. This has led researchers to debate the establishment of Internet addiction as an actual clinical disorder.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/06/24/earlyshow/main4205009.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody |title= CBS \"Social Networking: An Internet Addiction?\", CBS News, June 24, 2008 |publisher= CBS News |date=June 24, 2008 |accessdate=May 13, 2011}}</ref>\nSocial networking can also affect the extent to which a person feels lonely. In a ''[[Newsweek]]'' article, Johannah Cornblatt explains \"Social-networking sites like Facebook and MySpace may provide people with a false sense of connection that ultimately increases loneliness in people who feel alone.\" John T.

The researchers found that online social networking plays a positive role in subjective well-being when the networking is used to facilitate physical interactions, but networking activities that do not facilitate face-to-face interactions tend to erode trust, and this erosion can then negatively affect subjective well-being (independent of the online social interaction itself).

A 2013 study in the journal ''Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking'' investigated this phenomenon from the perspective of Facebook users. The number one reason for these users was privacy concerns (48%), being followed by a general dissatisfaction with the social networking website (14%), negative aspects regarding social network friends (13%) and the feeling of getting addicted to the social networking website (6%).

The problem with that is that you are left with no closure and the entire online world now knows you are no longer in a relationship.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vlahakis|first=George|title=The Breakup 2.0': A Look at How New Media Is Used to End Relationships|url=http://homepages.indiana.edu/web/page/normal/15705.html|publisher=Indiana University|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625120226/http://homepages.indiana.edu/web/page/normal/15705.html|archive-date=June 25, 2013|df=}}</ref> In a 2010 study conducted online, nearly one-quarter of the 1,000 individuals surveyed found out that their own relationship was over by seeing it on Facebook.<ref name=\"O'Dell\">{{cite web|last=O'Dell|first=Jolie|title=Would You Break Up via Facebook?|url=http://mashable.com/2010/06/21/facebook-break-up/|publisher=Mashable}}</ref> New media websites have made our private lives much more public, especially when it comes to breaking up, since updates are able to be immediately viewed by everyone in our networks (which tend to be more people than we would normally tell personally); for example, having friends comment on your newly changed \"single\" relationship status, and having to explain what happened can be distressing.\n\nThis creates further problems, as it is even more crucial to 'save face' after one's relationship has been broken when one is connected to new media technologies. [[Erving Goffman]] argues that all social life boils down to face-to-face interactions. These interpersonal interactions are mediated by what Goffman terms as \"face-work\", which are the actions undertaken to maintain consistency with one's face and to uphold the expressive order of social situations. Individuals attempt to keep a positive image of the self when interacting with others, and in order to do so, they may have to alter their appearance or manner in some way.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goffman|first=Erving|title=On Face-Work: Interactions Ritual: Essays on Face-to-Face Behavior|year=1967|publisher=Anchor|location=Garden City, NY|pages=5\u201345}}</ref> Such face-work can also be seen in new technologies, especially social media websites such as Facebook. If someone breaks up with you, you can actively choose what \"face\" you want to present to your friends, including your ex. You can choose to either post sad updates, which is the most natural thing you would want to do, or you can \"save face\" by posting happy updates and pictures of you going out with your friends. Even though you may be absolutely heartbroken within, Facebook allows you to hide your true feelings from the online world, and from your ex, by manipulating your profile. New media is being utilized as a tool for helping users present a desirable image of themselves, enabling them to save face in difficult situations. Nearly 35% of respondents in a study admitted to using their Facebook status to make someone think that they had plans, even if they did not.<ref name=\"O'Dell\"/>\n\nMany people find that the only way to really move on from a past relationship is to cut the person out of their life completely. Social media has made this process much more complicated and difficult. In a 2012 study, 48% of the participants stated they had remained friends with their ex on Facebook, and of these people, 88% stated they 'creeped' their ex after the breakup. Many digital social networking sites leave behind a trail of a user's interactions,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Melander|first=L.A.|title=College students' perceptions of intimate partner cyber harassment|journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|year=2010|volume=13|issue=3|pages=263\u2013268|doi=10.1089/cyber.2009.0221|pmid=20557245|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6c47d8b6027814a346ac7a11f57914aac66dc7ee}}</ref> so deleting content may be an arduous process, more difficult than simply burning or throwing away an entire box of letters, photos, and mementos.<ref>{{cite book|last=Van Dijck|first=Jose|title=Mediated memories in the digital age|year=2007|publisher=Stanford University Press}}</ref> Additionally, this content can still remain online.\n\n===Social overload===\nThe increasing number of messages and social relationships embedded in SNS also increases the amount of social information demanding a reaction from SNS users. Consequently, SNS users perceive they are giving too much social support to other SNS friends.

The eager to know what everyone was saying and the tendency to see if anyone shared new things are typical \"symptoms\" of this anxiety called [[Fear of missing out|FoMO]]. There is a study that examined possible connections between FOMO and social media engagement indicating that FoMO was associated with lower need satisfaction, mood and [[life satisfaction]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Przybylski|first=Andrew K.|last2=Murayama|first2=Kou|last3=DeHaan|first3=Cody R.|last4=Gladwell|first4=Valerie|date=July 2013|title=Motivational, emotional, and behavioral correlates of fear of missing out|url= |journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=29|issue=4|pages=1841\u20131848|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2013.02.014}}</ref>\n\nAnother type of social anxiety is the FoBM (fear of being missed).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2012/12/18/the-devolution-of-friendship-full-essay-pts-i-ii/|title=Social Media and the Devolution of Friendship: Full Essay (Pts I & II)|last=Boesel|first=Whitney Erin|date=December 18, 2012|work=Cyborgology|access-date=June 21, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> It comes from the situation that we can't produce share-content for people to consume.

Indeed, people tend to add friends to compensate low self-esteem and there is a high correlation between the number of \"friends\" on social media platforms and feeling social anxiety, leading to symptoms of major depression and dysthymia.  If we consider this aspect with regards to the relationships maintained through social media platforms, we can easily point out a change in our understanding of friendship. As a matter of fact, online platforms and social media services altered the old definition of friendship. Indeed, friendship \"redoubleth joys, and cutteth griefs in halves\" as stated by Francis Bacon.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.authorama.com/essays-of-francis-bacon-27.html| title=Of Friendship|publisher=Francis Bacon| date = 1601}}</ref> However, nowadays we see that Facebook friends, for instance, encourage negative feelings, such as envy, revenge and sadness.\n\nWhen it comes to friendship, we can wonder whether friendship on online platforms is a real form of friendship, or it is just a sort of metaphor to compensate for social communication problems. Actually, a lot of changes can be spotted in its old definition compared to the one in the era of social media. Friendship used to relate to the public sphere as explained in ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', however nowadays friendship is rather exposed publicly on different social media platforms.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n \nCroom et al. found that Facebook users know only a bit more than two thirds of their \"friends\" on the platform, meaning that they did not know one-third of the individuals in their friend-lists.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Croom |first1=Charles |last2=Gross |first2=Bay |last3=Rosen |first3=Larry D. |last4=Rosen |first4=Brad |title=What's Her Face(book)?

Since businesses operate globally, social networks can make it easier to keep in touch with contacts around the world. Applications for social networking sites have extended toward businesses and brands are creating their own, high functioning sites, a sector known as [[brand networking]]. It is the idea that a brand can build its consumer relationship by connecting their consumers to the brand image on a platform that provides them relative content, elements of participation, and a ranking or score system. Brand networking is a new way to capitalize on social trends as a marketing tool. The power of social networks is beginning to permeate into internal culture of businesses where they are finding uses for [[collaboration]], [[file sharing]] and [[knowledge transfer]]. The term \"[[enterprise social software]]\" is becoming increasingly popular for these types of applications.\n\n===Dating applications===\n{{See also|Online dating service}}\nMany social networks provide an online environment for people to communicate and exchange personal information for dating purposes. Intentions can vary from looking for a one time date, short-term relationships, and long-term relationships.<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,396461,00.html ''MySpace, Facebook Add Opportunity for Love, Trouble to Online Dating''], [[Fox News Channel|FoxNews.com]] website.</ref> Most of these social networks, just like online dating services, require users to give out certain pieces of information. This usually includes a user's age, gender, location, interests, and perhaps a picture. Releasing very personal information is usually discouraged for safety reasons.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5336688 ''MySpace Adds a Security Monitor''], [[NPR.com]] website.</ref> This allows other users to search or be searched by some sort of criteria, but at the same time, people can maintain a degree of anonymity similar to most online dating services. Online dating sites are similar to social networks in the sense that users create profiles to meet and communicate with others, but their activities on such sites are for the sole purpose of finding a person of interest to date. Social networks do not necessarily have to be for dating; many users simply use it for keeping in touch with friends, and colleagues.<ref>[http://www.internetnews.com/ec-news/article.php/3659911 ''Online Dating: Can Social Networks Cut In?''], [[internetnews.com]] website.</ref>\n\nHowever, an important difference between social networks and online dating services is the fact that online dating sites usually require a fee, where social networks are free.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://localtechwire.com/business/local_tech_wire/opinion/story/2449164/ |title=Online Dating vs. Social Networking \u2013 Which Will Emerge as Premier Matchmaker? |publisher=localtechwire.com|date=2008-08-18 }}</ref>\nThis difference is one of the reasons the online dating industry is seeing a massive decrease in revenue due to many users opting to use social networking services instead. Many popular online dating services such as [[Match.com]], [[Yahoo Personals]], and [[eHarmony.com]] are seeing a decrease in users, where social networks like [[MySpace]] and Facebook are experiencing an increase in users.<ref>[http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/story.aspx?guid={4640E6FF-17B8-40D5-901C-098EE74B03DD} ''Social networks vs. dating sites Commentary: Fragmenting may save online dating sites''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203122438/http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/story.aspx?guid=%7B4640E6FF-17B8-40D5-901C-098EE74B03DD%7D |date=December 3, 2007 }}, [[marketwatch.com]] website.</ref> The number of Internet users in the United States that visit online dating sites has fallen from a peak of 21% in 2003 to 10% in 2006.<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/2007/12/20/online-dating-love-tech-personal-cx_wt_1221dating.html ''Seeking Love Around The Web ''], ''[[Forbes]]'' website.</ref> Whether it is the cost of the services, the variety of users with different intentions, or any other reason, it is undeniable that social networking sites are quickly becoming the new way to find dates online.\n\n===Educational applications===\nThe [[National School Boards Association]] reports that almost 60% of students who use social networking talk about education topics online, and more than 50% talk specifically about schoolwork. Yet the vast majority of school districts have stringent rules against nearly all forms of social networking during the school day\u2014even though students and parents report few problem behaviors online. Social networks focused on supporting relationships between teachers and their students are now used for learning, educators professional development, and content sharing. [[HASTAC]] is a collaborative social network space for new modes of learning and research in higher education, K-12, and lifelong learning; [[Ning (website)|Ning]] supports teachers; [[TermWiki]], [[TeachStreet]] and other sites are being built to foster relationships that include educational blogs, portfolios, formal and ad hoc communities, as well as communication such as chats, discussion threads, and synchronous forums. These sites also have content sharing and rating features. Social networks are also emerging as online [[yearbook]]s, both public and private. One such service is [[MyYearbook]], which allows anyone from the general public to register and connect. A new trend emerging is <!--Predicate agrees in number with its subject.--> private label yearbooks accessible only by students, parents, and teachers of a particular school, similar to [[Facebook]]'s beginning within Harvard.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n===Finance applications===\nThe use of [[virtual economy|virtual currency]] systems inside social networks create new opportunities for global finance.

For alcoholics and addicts, SoberCircle gives people in recovery the ability to communicate with one another and strengthen their recovery through the encouragement of others who can relate to their situation. [[DailyStrength]] is also a website that offers support groups for a wide array of topics and conditions, including the support topics offered by [[PatientsLikeMe]] and SoberCircle. Some social networks aim to encourage healthy lifestyles in their users. [[SparkPeople]] and [[HealthUnlocked]] offer community and social networking tools for peer support during weight loss. [[Fitocracy]] and [[QUENTIQ]] are focused on exercise, enabling users to share their own workouts and comment on those of other users. Other aspects of social network usage include the analysis of data coming from existing social networks (such as Twitter) to discover large crowd concentration events (based on tweets location statistical analysis) and disseminate the information to e.g. mobility-challenged individuals for e.g. avoiding the specific areas and optimizing their journey in an urban environment.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kousiouris |first1=George |last2=Akbar |first2=Adnan |last3=Sancho |first3=Juan |last4=Ta-shma |first4=Paula |last5=Psychas |first5=Alexandros |last6=Kyriazis |first6=Dimosthenis |last7=Varvarigou |first7=Theodora |title=An integrated information lifecycle management framework for exploiting social network data to identify dynamic large crowd concentration events in smart cities applications |journal=Future Generation Computer Systems |date=January 2018 |volume=78 |pages=516\u2013530 |doi=10.1016/j.future.2017.07.026 |url=http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/841839/1/LCC_pre_final%20%281%29.pdf }}</ref>\n\n===Social and political applications===\nSocial networking sites have recently showed a value in social and political movements.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Auer |first1=Matthew R. |title=The Policy Sciences of Social Media |journal=Policy Studies Journal |date=November 2011 |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=709\u2013736 |doi=10.1111/j.1541-0072.2011.00428.x |ssrn=1974080 }}</ref> In the [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egyptian revolution]], [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] both played an allegedly pivotal role in keeping people connected to the revolt.

It was the first of its kind, as it successfully incorporated social media into its campaign winning strategy, evolving the way of political campaigns forevermore in the ever-changing technological world we find ourselves in today.

JFK was the first president who really understood television, and similarly, Obama is the first president to fully understand the power of social media.<ref name=Rutledge>{{cite web |title=How Obama Won the Social Media Battle in the 2012 Presidential Campaign |url=http://mprcenter.org/blog/2013/01/how-obama-won-the-social-media-battle-in-the-2012-presidential-campaign/ |website=Media Psychology Research Center }}</ref> Obama has recognized social media is about creating relationships and connections and therefore used social media to the advantage of presidential election campaigns, in which Obama has dominated his opponents in terms of social media space.\n\nOther political campaigns have followed on from Obama's successful social media campaigns, recognizing the power of social media and incorporating it as a key factor embedded within their political campaigns, for example, Donald Trump's presidential electoral campaign, 2016.

The most basic of these are visible profiles with a list of \"friends\" who are also users of the site.<ref name=Boyd2007/> In an article entitled \"Social Network Sites: Definition, History, and Scholarship,\" Boyd and Ellison adopt Sunden's (2003) description of profiles as unique pages where one can \"type oneself into being\".<ref name=\"Boyd & Ellison 2007\"/> A profile is generated from answers to questions, such as age, location, interests, etc. Some sites allow users to upload pictures, add multimedia content or modify the look and feel of the profile. Others, e.g., Facebook, allow users to enhance their profile by adding modules or \"Applications\".<ref name=\"Boyd & Ellison 2007\"/> Many sites allow users to post blog entries, search for others with similar interests and compile and share lists of contacts. User profiles often have a section dedicated to comments from friends and other users. To protect user privacy, social networks typically have controls that allow users to choose who can view their profile, contact them, add them to their list of contacts, and so on.\n\n===Additional features===\nThere is a trend towards more [[Social network aggregation|interoperability between social networks]] led by technologies such as [[OpenID]] and [[OpenSocial]]. In most mobile communities, mobile phone users can now create their own profiles, make friends, participate in chat rooms, create chat rooms, hold private conversations, share photos and videos, and share blogs by using their mobile phone. Some companies provide wireless services that allow their customers to build their own mobile community and brand it; one of the most popular wireless services for social networking in [[North America]] and [[Nepal]] is Facebook Mobile.\n\n==Emerging trends==\n{{Rquote|right|The things you share are things that make you look good, things which you are happy to tie into your identity.|Hilary Mason, chief data scientist, [[bitly]]|{{nowrap|[[VentureBeat]], 2012}}<ref name=\"VentureBeat Byrne 2012\">{{cite news|last=Byrne|first=Ciara|title=What you read is not what you share|url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/08/23/bitly-realtime-hilary-mason/|accessdate=September 10, 2012|newspaper=[[VentureBeat]]|date=August 23, 2012}}</ref>}}\nWhile the popularity of social networking consistently rises,<ref>[http://www.google.com/trends?q=e-commerce%2C+social+networking&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=1 Search for \"e-commerce, social networking\"].

Real-time allows users to contribute contents, which is then broadcast as it is being uploaded\u2014the concept is analogous to live radio and television broadcasts. [[Twitter]] set the trend for \"real-time\" services, wherein users can broadcast to the world what they are doing, or what is on their minds within a 140-character limit. [[Facebook]] followed suit with their \"Live Feed\" where users' activities are streamed as soon as it happens. While Twitter focuses on words, [[Clixtr]], another real-time service, focuses on group photo sharing wherein users can update their photo streams with photos while at an event. Facebook, however, remains the largest photo sharing site\u2014Facebook application and photo aggregator Pixable estimates that Facebook will have 100 billion photos by Summer 2012.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sarah Kessler|url=http://mashable.com/2011/02/14/facebook-photo-infographic/?asid=c228f21b |title=Facebook Photos By the Numbers [INFOGRAPHIC]|publisher=[[Mashable]]|date=February 14, 2011 |accessdate=August 7, 2013}}</ref> In April 2012, the image-based social media network [[Pinterest]] had become the third largest social network in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2012/04/06/pinterest-number-3-social-network/|title=Pinterest is Now the No. 3 Social Network in the U.S. [STUDY]|first=Todd|last=Wasserman|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nCompanies have begun to merge business technologies and solutions, such as [[cloud computing]], with social networking concepts. Instead of connecting individuals based on social interest, companies are developing interactive communities that connect individuals based on shared business needs or experiences. Many provide specialized networking tools and [[Application software|applications]] that can be accessed via their websites, such as [[LinkedIn]]. Others companies, such as [[Monster.com]], have been steadily developing a more \"socialized\" feel to their career center sites to harness some of the power of social networking sites. These more business related sites have their own nomenclature for the most part but the most common naming conventions are \"Vocational Networking Sites\" or \"Vocational Media Networks\", with the former more closely tied to individual networking relationships based on social networking principles.\n\n[[Foursquare (service)|Foursquare]] gained popularity as it allowed for users to check into places that they are frequenting at that moment. [[Gowalla]] is another such service that functions in much the same way that Foursquare does, leveraging the [[GPS]] in phones to create a location-based user experience. Clixtr, though in the real-time space, is also a location-based social networking site, since events created by users are automatically geotagged, and users can view events occurring nearby through the Clixtr [[iPhone]] app. Recently, [[Yelp, Inc.|Yelp]] announced its entrance into the location-based social networking space through check-ins with their mobile app; whether or not this becomes detrimental to Foursquare or Gowalla is yet to be seen, as it is still considered a new space in the Internet technology industry.<ref>{{cite web|author=MG Siegler |url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/15/yelp-iphone-app-4-check-ins/ |title=Yelp Enables Check-Ins On Its iPhone App; Foursquare, Gowalla Ousted As Mayors |publisher=Techcrunch.com |date=January 15, 2010 |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOne popular use for this new technology is social networking between businesses. Companies have found that social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are great ways to build their brand image. According to Jody Nimetz, author of Marketing Jive,<ref name=\"marketing-jive.com\">Nimetz, Jody. [http://www.marketing-jive.com/2007/11/jody-nimetz-on-emerging-trends-in-b2b.html \"Jody Nimetz on Emerging Trends in B2B Social Networking\"]. Marketing-Jive, November 18, 2007.

As of September 2013, 71% of online adults use Facebook, 17% use Instagram, 21% use Pinterest, and 22% use LinkedIn.<ref>{{cite web|date=Oct 23, 2014|title=Social Networking Fact Sheet|publisher=[[Pew Research]]|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/social-networking-fact-sheet/}}</ref>\n\n===Niche networks===\nIn 2012, it was reported that in the past few years, the niche social network has steadily grown in popularity, thanks to better levels of user interaction and engagement. In 2012, a survey by Reuters and research firm Ipsos<ref>{{cite news|date=Jan 4, 2012|title=Facebook comments, ads don't sway most users|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/05/net-us-facebook-survey-idUSBRE85400C20120605/}}</ref>\nfound that one in three users were getting bored with Facebook and in 2014 the GlobalWebIndex found that this figured had risen to almost 50%. The niche social network offers a specialized space that's designed to appeal to a very specific market with a clearly defined set of needs. Where once the streams of social minutia on networks such as Facebook and Twitter were the ultimate in online voyeurism, now users are looking for connections, community and shared experiences. Social networks that tap directly into specific activities, hobbies, tastes, and lifestyles are seeing a consistent rise in popularity. Niche social networks such as [[Fishbrain]] for [[fishing]] and [[Strava]] for [[cycling]]. These social platforms offer brands a rich space in which to engage with their target market and build awareness.\n\n===Science===\nOne other use that is being discussed is the use of social networks in the science communities. Julia Porter Liebeskind et al. have published a study on how new biotechnology firms are using social networking sites to share exchanges in scientific knowledge.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Liebeskind |first1=Julia Porter |last2=Oliver |first2=Amalya Lumerman |last3=Zucker |first3=Lynne |last4=Brewer |first4=Marilynn |title=Social Networks, Learning, and Flexibility: Sourcing Scientific Knowledge in New Biotechnology Firms |journal=Organization Science |date=1996 |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=428\u2013443 |jstor=2635102 |doi=10.1287/orsc.7.4.428 |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4480h6s7 }}</ref> They state in their study that by sharing information and knowledge with one another, they are able to \"increase both their learning and their flexibility in ways that would not have been possible within a self-contained hierarchical organization\".

For a number of years, Prensky's (2001) dichotomy between [[Digital Natives]] and Digital Immigrants has been considered a relatively accurate representation of the ease with which people of a certain age range\u2014in particular those born before and after 1980\u2014use technology. Prensky's theory has been largely disproved, however, and not least on account of the burgeoning popularity of social networking sites and other metaphors such as White and Le Cornu's \"Visitors\" and \"Residents\" (2011) are greater currency. The use of online social networks by school libraries is also increasingly prevalent and they are being used to communicate with potential library users, as well as extending the services provided by individual school libraries. Social networks and their educational uses are of interest to many researchers. According to Livingstone and Brake (2010), \"[[Social networking sites]], like much else on the Internet, represent a moving target for researchers and policymakers.\"<ref name=group>{{cite journal|last=Livingstone|first=Sonia|author2=Brake, David R |title=On the Rapid Rise of Social Networking Sites: New Findings and Policy Implications|journal=Children & Society|date=December 2010|volume=24|issue=1|pages=75\u201383|doi=10.1111/j.1099-0860.2009.00243.x|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/30124/1/On_the_rapid_rise_of_social_networking_(LSERO_version).pdf|accessdate=July 16, 2012}}</ref> Pew Research Center project, called Pew Internet, did a USA-wide survey in 2009 and in 2010 February published that 47% of American adults use a social networking website.<ref name=Lenhart>{{Cite book\n| publisher = Pew Internet & American Life Project\n| last = Lenhart\n| first = Amanda\n| first2 = Kristen\n| last2 = Purcell\n| first3 = Aaron\n| last3 = Smith\n| first4 = Kathryn\n| last4 = Zickuhr\n| title = Social Media & Mobile Internet Use Among Teens and Young Adults.

However, there are constraints in this area. Researches, especially in Africa, have disclosed that the use of social networks among students has been known to affect their academic life negatively. This is buttressed by the fact that their use constitutes distractions, as well as that the students tend to invest a good deal of time in the use of such technologies.\n\nAlbayrak and Yildirim (2015) examined the educational use of social networking sites. They investigated students' involvement in Facebook as a Course Management System (CMS) and the findings of their study support that Facebook as a CMS has the potential to increase student involvement in discussions and out-of-class communication among instructors and students.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albayrak | first1 = D. | last2 = Yildirim | first2 = Z | year = 2015 | title = Using Social Networking Sites for Teaching and Learning: Students' Involvement in and Acceptance of Facebook as a Course Management System | journal = Journal of Educational Computing Research | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 155\u2013179 | doi = 10.1177/0735633115571299 | hdl = 11693/23247 }}</ref>\n\n====Professional use====\nProfessional use of social networking services refers to the employment of a network site to connect with other professionals within a given field of interest.

A number of scholars have done research on the negative effects of Internet communication as well. These researchers have contended that this form of communication is an impoverished version of conventional face-to-face social interactions, and therefore produce negative outcomes such as loneliness and depression for users who rely on social networking entirely. By engaging solely in online communication, interactions between communities, families, and other social groups are weakened.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bargh |first1=John A. |last2=McKenna |first2=Katelyn Y.

Users of these services also need to be aware of [[Computer insecurity|data theft]] or [[computer virus|viruses]]. However, large services, such as [[MySpace|Myspace]] and [[Netlog]], often work with law enforcement to try to prevent such incidents.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}} In addition, there is a perceived privacy threat in relation to placing too much personal information in the hands of large corporations or governmental bodies, allowing a profile to be produced on an individual's behavior on which decisions, detrimental to an individual, may be taken. Furthermore, there is an issue over the control of data and information that was altered or removed by the user may, in fact, be retained and passed to third parties. This danger was highlighted when the controversial social networking site [[Quechup]] harvested e-mail addresses from users' e-mail accounts for use in a [[e-mail spam|spamming]] operation.<ref>[http://www.e-consultancy.com/news-blog/364182/social-network-launches-worldwide-spam-campaign.html Social network launches worldwide spam campaign] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909161205/http://www.e-consultancy.com/news-blog/364182/social-network-launches-worldwide-spam-campaign.html |date=September 9, 2007 }} E-consultancy.com.

Personality measures [[Openness to experience|openness]], [[Extraversion and introversion|extraversion]], and [[conscientiousness]] were found to positively affect the willingness to disclose data, while [[neuroticism]] decreases the willingness to disclose personal information.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-39062-3_11 |chapter=The Impact of User Diversity on the Willingness to Disclose Personal Information in Social Network Services |title=Human Factors in Computing and Informatics |volume=7946 |pages=174\u2013193 |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |year=2013 |last1=Schaar |first1=Anne Kathrin |last2=Calero Valdez |first2=Andr\u00e9 |last3=Ziefle |first3=Martina |isbn=978-3-642-39061-6 |chapter-url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4284b110f431910cf4ec72e1add50844f7a45f37 }}</ref>\n\nAnother debate lies in the design of [[algorithm]]ic<nowiki/>systems to target specific audiences on social networking sites. With multiple formats for marketing, [[Facebook]] offers a variety of direct marketing options for advertisers to reach their intended audience. For example, these ads may appear as suggested ad posts on the home [[News Feed (Facebook)|News Feed]] or on the right side of the feed as a banner. Businesses may create a page to outline their company and post related information, promotions and contact information to it, directly reaching their interested audience. Users who \"like\" a business page will be subscribed to receive these business' updates on their home News Feed. Banner ads and suggested posts are paid for by marketers and advertisers to reach their intended audience.<ref name=\"Morris et al 2016\">{{cite journal |last1=Morris |first1=Jon D. |last2=Choi |first2=Yunmi |last3=Ju |first3=Ilyoung |title=Are Social Marketing and Advertising Communications (SMACs) Meaningful?: A Survey of Facebook User Emotional Responses, Source Credibility, Personal Relevance, and Perceived Intrusiveness |journal=Journal of Current Issues & Research in Advertising |date=25 May 2016 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=165\u2013182 |doi=10.1080/10641734.2016.1171182 }}</ref> Like other methods of marketing, emotional connections are critical to reaching the user. From the fourth quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2013, Facebook increased its [[advertising]] click-through rate by 365%, having 2.5 million promoted suggested posts on user's news feeds.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://expandedramblings.com/index.php/facebook-advertising-statistics/|title=135 Amazing Facebook Advertising Statistics|date=March 13, 2014|work=DMR|access-date=April 12, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> This surge of posts resulted in an influx of information that was difficult to organize. A study of the emotional responses to advertising on Facebook found that Business Pages found the highest appeal to users because they were only recommended when liked by the user or the user's friends. \u201cLiked\u201d pages have higher credibility to users. However, a change in algorithm announced on April 10, 2014, said that Business Pages were receiving a reduced reach after engaging in \u201cclick bait\u201d tactics (fooling users to click links to things other than what discretely said on Facebook). The quantity of engagement on Facebook posts are measured, relaying important information about the user audience and their actions online.<ref name=\"Morris et al 2016\"/>\n\nThe debate questions to what extent the design of these systems is compromising the needs, privacy and information of the users. More research is needed to evaluate if allowing advertising to access user information to specifically tailor content to their choices and interactions, for example by placing ads within their personal feeds and throughout their use of the site, is compromising the user's information and social wellbeing. John Herrman (2018) compares the function of algorithms in adjusting content to omniscience and recounts the unpleasant experiences that coincide as a result. He calls to web browsing on Amazon, where products he browsed through briefly reappear on other news feeds, including his Instagram feed. He outlines the experience as if the networks \u201c[have] got eyes everywhere,\u201d and suggests that this looming omniscience may alter how we interact online, even \u201crisk driving away followers in the process.\u201d This may deter users from engaging in social interactions online and points to how much advertisers are able to tailor information to their intended audience.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Algorithmic surveillance has put humanity in touch with a new sort of omniscience -- the kind we can fool.|last=|first=|date=|work=New York Times Magazine|access-date=}}</ref> This debate was further ignited in early 2018. On April 10, 2018, Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress on questions defining Facebook's policy, information handling and data design systems. Congress placed emphasis on addressing Facebook's tracking of user data online, skeptical that the social networking site can regulate itself.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/us/politics/mark-zuckerberg-testimony.html|title=Mark Zuckerberg Testimony: Senators Question Facebook's Commitment to Privacy|last=Times|first=The New York|date=April 10, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 12, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n===Data mining===\nThrough [[data mining]], companies are able to improve their sales and profitability. With this data, companies create customer profiles that contain customer [[demographic]]s and online behavior. A recent strategy has been the purchase and production of \"[[Social network analysis|network analysis]] software\". This software is able to sort out through the influx of social networking data for any specific company.<ref>{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Andy|title=Mining Social Networks: Untangling the Social Web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16910031|work=The Economist|date=September 2, 2010}}</ref> Facebook has been especially important to marketing strategists. Facebook's controversial \"Social Ads\" program gives companies access to the millions of profiles in order to tailor their ads to a Facebook user's own interests and hobbies. However, rather than sell actual user information, Facebook sells tracked \"social actions\". That is, they track the websites a user uses outside of Facebook through a program called [[Facebook Beacon]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Elkins|first=Sarah|title=A Social Network's Faux Pas?|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2007/11/08/a-social-network-s-faux-pas.html|work=Newsweek|date=2007-11-09}}</ref>\n\n===Notifications ===\nThere has been a trend for social networking sites to send out only \"positive\" notifications to users. For example, sites such as Bebo, Facebook, and MySpace will not send notifications to users when they are removed from a person's friends list. Likewise, Bebo will send out a notification if a user is moved to the top of another user's friends list but no notification is sent if they are moved down the list. This allows users to purge undesirables from their list extremely easily and often without confrontation since a user will rarely notice if one person disappears from their friends list. It also enforces the general positive atmosphere of the website without drawing attention to unpleasant happenings such as friends falling out, rejection and failed relationships.\n\n===Access to information===\n{{See also|Unauthorized access in online social networks}}\n\nMany social networking services, such as [[Facebook]], provide the user with a choice of who can view their profile. This is supposed to prevent unauthorized users from accessing their information.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} Parents who want to access their child's MySpace or Facebook account have become a big problem for teenagers who do not want their profile seen by their parents. By making their profile private, teens can select who may see their page, allowing only people added as \"friends\" to view their profile and preventing unwanted viewing of the profile by parents. Most teens are constantly trying to create a structural barrier between their private life and their parents.<ref name=Boyd2007/> To edit information on a certain social networking service account, the social networking sites require you to [[login|log in]] or provide a [[password]]. This is designed to prevent unauthorized users from adding, changing, or removing personal information, pictures, or other data.\n\n===Impact on employability===\nSocial networking sites have created issues among getting hired for jobs and losing jobs because of exposing inappropriate content, posting photos of embarrassing situations or posting comments that contain potentially offensive comments (e.g., racist, homophobic or defamatory comments), or even political comments that are contrary to those of the employer. There are works which recommend friends to social networking users based on their political opinions.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1109/ANTS.2015.7413659 |chapter=PoliticAlly: Finding political friends on twitter |title=2015 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommuncations Systems (ANTS) |pages=1\u20133 |year=2015 |last1=Jain |first1=Suchita |last2=Sharma |first2=Vanya |last3=Kaushal |first3=Rishabh |isbn=978-1-5090-0293-1 }}</ref> Many people use social networking sites to express their personal opinions about current events and news issues to their friends. If a potential applicant expresses personal opinions on political issues or makes potentially embarrassing posts online on a publicly available social networking platform, employers can access their employees' and applicants' profiles, and judge them based on their social behavior or political views. According to ''Silicon Republic's'' statistics, 17,000 young people in six countries were interviewed in a survey. 1 in 10 people aged 16 to 34 have been rejected for a job because of comments made on an online profile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconrepublic.com/careers/item/32880-1-in-10-young-people-losing|title=1 in 10 young people losing out on jobs because of pics and comments on social media|work=Silicon Republic}}</ref> This shows the effects that social networks have had on people's lives. There have been numerous cases where employees have lost jobs because their opinions represented their companies negatively. In September 2013, a woman got fired over Facebook because she posted disruptive information about her company stating that military patrons should not receive special treatment or discounts. A manager of the company found her opinion online, disagreed with it, and fired her because it went against the company's mission statement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcbtv.com/story/23548618/facebook-flub-woman-gets-fired-over-post|title=Facebook flub: woman gets fired over post|author=NBC News|date=September 27, 2013|work=wrcbtv.com}}</ref> In November 2012, a woman posted a racist remark about the President of the United States and mentioned a possible assassination.

In April 2011, a Lloyd's banking group employee in the United Kingdom was fired for making a sarcastic post about the higher salary of her boss in relation to hers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/bank-worker-stephanie-bon-fired-after-criticising-lloyds-bank-bosss-6295-an-hour-salary/story-e6frfm9r-1226034503421|title=Stephanie Bon fired for sarcastic Facebook post on Lloyds TSB CEO's \u00a34000-an-hour salary|work=NewsComAu|date=April 5, 2011}}</ref> In February 2013 there was another case where a flight attendant working for a Russian airline lost her job because she posted a photo of herself giving the middle finger to a plane full of passengers.

In March 2012, Facebook decided they might take legal action against employers for gaining access to employee's profiles through their passwords.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2012/03/23/facebook-says-it-may-launch-legal-action-against-employers-who-ask-for-user-passwords/|title=Facebook May Take Legal Action Over Employer Password Requests|author=Matt Brian|work=The Next Web|date=2012-03-23}}</ref> According to Facebook Chief Privacy Officer for policy, Erin Egan, the company has worked hard to give its users the tools to control who sees their information. He also said users shouldn't be forced to share private information and communications just to get a job. According to the network's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, sharing or soliciting a password is a violation to Facebook. Employees may still give their password information out to get a job, but according to Erin Egan, Facebook will continue to do their part to protect the privacy and security of their users.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=326598317390057|title=Protecting Your Passwords and Your Privacy|work=facebook.com}}</ref>\n\n===Potential for misuse===\nThe relative freedom afforded by social networking services has caused concern regarding the potential of its misuse by individual patrons. In October 2006, a fake [[MySpace]] profile created in the name of Josh Evans by Lori Janine Drew led to the suicide of [[Suicide of Megan Meier|Megan Meier]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,21775032-11869,00.html |title=Fatal MySpace internet hoax mother is charged, ''Herald Sun'', 17 May 2008 |work=News.com.au |date=May 22, 2007 |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=October 2011}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Story?id=3882520 |title=Parents: Cyber Bullying Led to Teen's Suicide: Megan Meier's Parents Now Want Measures to Protect Children Online |date=November 29, 2007 |publisher=ABC News }}</ref> The event incited global concern regarding the use of social networking services for bullying purposes. In July 2008, a Briton and a former friend was ordered to pay a total of GBP \u00a322,000 (about US$44,000) for libel and breach of privacy. He had posted a fake page on [[Facebook]] purporting to be that of a former school friend Matthew Firsht, with whom he had fallen out in 2000. The page falsely claimed that Firsht was homosexual and that he was dishonest.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nAt the same time, genuine use of social networking services has been treated with suspicion on the ground of the services' misuse. In September 2008, the profile of Australian Facebook user Elmo Keep was banned by the site's administrators on the grounds that it violated the site's terms of use. Keep is one of several users of Facebook who were banned from the site on the presumption that their names aren't real, as they bear resemblance to the names of characters like [[Sesame Street]]'s Elmo.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/biztech/banned-for-keeps-on-facebook-for-odd-name/2008/09/25/1222217399252.html |title=Banned for keeps on Facebook for odd name, ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 24 September 2008 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=September 25, 2008 |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOnline social networks have also become a platform for spread of rumors, one such study has analyzed rumors in retrospect.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1109/ANTS.2015.7413660 |chapter=Rumor detection in twitter: An analysis in retrospect |title=2015 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommuncations Systems (ANTS) |pages=1\u20133 |year=2015 |last1=Dayani |first1=Raveena |last2=Chhabra |first2=Nikita |last3=Kadian |first3=Taruna |last4=Kaushal |first4=Rishabh |isbn=978-1-5090-0293-1 }}</ref> One of the approaches to detect rumors (or misinformation)<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732347 |chapter=Towards automated real-time detection of misinformation on Twitter |title=2016 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI) |pages=2015\u20132020 |year=2016 |last1=Jain |first1=Suchita |last2=Sharma |first2=Vanya |last3=Kaushal |first3=Rishabh |isbn=978-1-5090-2029-4 }}</ref> is to compare the spread of topic over social network (say Twitter) with those spread by reliable and authorized news agencies.\n\n===Unauthorized access===\nThere are different forms where user data in social networks are accessed and updated without a user's permission.

Such actions are often referred to as \"trolling\". Confrontations in the [[reality|real world]] can also be transferred to the online world. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Trolling can occur in many different forms, such as (but not limited to) defacement of deceased person(s) tribute pages, name-calling, playing online pranks on individuals and making [[Flame bait|controversial or inflammatory comments with the intention to cause anger and cause arguments]]. Individuals troll for many reasons. The psychology behind why people troll according to ''[[Psychology Today]]'' is due to anonymity, perceived obscurity, and a perceived lack of consequences for online misbehavior. Trolls may also do their activities due to a perceived majority status, social identity salience and due to a sense by the troll that she or he is surrounded by online 'friends'. Trolls may also engage in harmful acts due to desensitization or negative personality traits (Fox, 2014).<ref>{{cite web|last=Fox|first= J. |year=2014|title= Why the Online Trolls Troll|url= https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/better-living-technology/201408/why-the-online-trolls-troll|website=psychologytoday.com}} Last accessed April 25, 2016.</ref> As these eight reasons behind the thought processes of trolls suggest individuals thrive behind being able to create a false identity or pseudonym to hide behind and the premise that they have 'friends' on social networks that agree with their outlook on certain topics, thus join in on trolling. The reason for the perceived lack of consequences is that they believe they have created an identity in which they can not be seen as a real life human and more of a persona/[[avatar]] that they have created, which leads them to feel that they will not face the consequences of being an online troll.\n\nTrolling is a prominent issue in the 2010s, and as the Internet and social media is consistently expanding and more individuals sign up to social networking sites, more people come under fire and become the target of trolls. As more people sign up to social networking sites, more celebrities are also becoming more prominent on these sites. With a variety of celebrities joining social networking sites, trolls tend to target abuse towards them. With some famous people gaining an influx of negative comments and slew of abuse from trolls it causes them to 'quit' social media. One prime example of a celebrity quitting social media is [[Stephen Fry]]. He left Twitter due to \"too much aggression and unkindness around\" emphasizing how trolls can negatively impact people's lives (Cohen, 2014).<ref>{{cite news|last=Cohen|first= C. |year=2014|title= Twitter trolls: The celebrities who've been driven off social media by abuse|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11238018/Celebrity-Twitter-trolls-The-famous-people-whove-been-driven-off-social-media-by-abuse.html|work=telegraph.co.uk}} Last accessed April 25, 2016.</ref> As celebrities face trolls and backlash on social media forcing them to quit, it can mean that they become less in touch with their fans, potentially losing a fan base, as they are not as relevant as people enjoy interacting with celebrities and makes them feel as though they are valued. As trolling can lead to celebrities deleting their social networks such as Twitter, it emphasizes how trolls can win, and can ruin people's lives.\n\nWhile trolls believe that they do not face consequences and can troll others on the Internet without repercussions, in the 2000s, due to high-profile cases where cyberbullies have allegedly been factors in [[suicides attributed to bullying]], more laws have been put in place by governments. Trolls can face going to prison for certain actions that they take on the Internet, such as spreading [[hate speech]] such as racist messages. One of the highest profile cases is racist trolling. Racist trolling has seen individuals been sent to prison for Tweets they have sent that to them may have seemed harmless and not racist. One case of this in recent years is Liam Stacey who was jailed for fifty-six days for tweeting offensive messages such as 'Muamba is dead, hahahaha', referring to when footballer [[Fabrice Muamba]] collapsed during a professional football game for Bolton Wanders (Williams, 2012).<ref>{{cite news|last=Williams|first= Z. |year=2012|title= What is an Internet Troll?|url= https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jun/12/what-is-an-internet-troll|work=theguardian.com}} Last accessed April 25, 2016.</ref> This highlights how offensive tweets and messages sent on any social networking platform does have repercussions for individuals and they have to be aware that they have to face the consequences of their actions.\n\n===Online bullying===\nOnline bullying, also called [[cyberbullying]], is a relatively common occurrence and it can often result in emotional trauma for the victim. Depending on the networking outlet, up to 39% of users admit to being \"cyber-bullied\".<ref>''Computer Science Illuminated''</ref> In her article, \"Why Youth (Heart) Social Network Sites\", [[danah boyd]], published in December 2007, a researcher of social networks, quotes a teenager. The teenager expresses frustration towards networking sites like MySpace because it causes drama and too much emotional stress.<ref name=Boyd2007/> There are not many limitations as to what individuals can post when online. Individuals are given the power to post offensive remarks or pictures that could potentially cause a great amount of emotional pain for another individual.\n\n===Interpersonal communication===\nInterpersonal communication has been a growing issue as more and more people have turned to social networking as a means of communication. \"Benniger (1987) describes how mass media has gradually replaced interpersonal communication as a socializing force. Further, social networking sites have become popular sites for youth culture to explore themselves, relationships, and share cultural artifacts\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/1394/1312#note4 | title=A Privacy Paradox}}</ref>\n\nThe convenience that social network sites give users to communicate with one another can also damage their interpersonal communication. Sherry Turkle, the founder and director of the MIT Initiative on Technology and Self, stated, \"Networked, we are together, but so lessened are our expectations of each other that we feel utterly alone. And there is the risk that we come to see others as objects to be accessed--and only for the parts we find useful, comforting, or amusing\".<ref>{{cite book |last= Turkle |first= Sherry |title= Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other |publisher= [[Basic Books]] |year= 2011 |page=154 |isbn= 978-0-465-02234-2}}</ref> Furthermore, social network sites can create insincere friendships, Turkle also noted, \"They nurture friendships on social-networking sites and then wonder if they are among friends.

This has led researchers to debate the establishment of Internet addiction as an actual clinical disorder.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/06/24/earlyshow/main4205009.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody |title= CBS \"Social Networking: An Internet Addiction?\", CBS News, June 24, 2008 |publisher= CBS News |date=June 24, 2008 |accessdate=May 13, 2011}}</ref>\nSocial networking can also affect the extent to which a person feels lonely. In a ''[[Newsweek]]'' article, Johannah Cornblatt explains \"Social-networking sites like Facebook and MySpace may provide people with a false sense of connection that ultimately increases loneliness in people who feel alone.\" John T. Cacioppo, a neuroscientist at the University of Chicago, claims that social networking can foster feelings of sensitivity to disconnection, which can lead to loneliness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2009/08/20/lonely-planet.html |title= Cornblatt, Johannah, \"Lonely Planet\", Newsweek, August 21, 2009 |work= Newsweek |date=August 29, 2009 |accessdate=May 13, 2011}}</ref> Fabio Sabatini and Francesco Sarracino found that if an individual tends to (a) trust people and (b) have a significant number of face-to-face interactions, the individual is likely to assess their own well-being as relatively high. The researchers found that online social networking plays a positive role in subjective well-being when the networking is used to facilitate physical interactions, but networking activities that do not facilitate face-to-face interactions tend to erode trust, and this erosion can then negatively affect subjective well-being (independent of the online social interaction itself). Sabatini and Sarracino conclude that \"The overall effect of networking on individual welfare is significantly negative.\"<ref>[http://www.technologyreview.com/view/530401/evidence-grows-that-online-social-networks-have-insidious-negative-effects/ Evidence Grows That Online Social Networks Have Insidious Negative Effects], ''[[MIT Technology Review]]''</ref>\n\nHowever, some scholars have expressed that concerns about social networking are often exaggerated and poorly researched.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-19518_3-20048148-238.html|title= Magid, Larry, \"Is there really 'Facebook depression?'\" |website= CNET|date=March 29, 2011 |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}</ref> Social Media can be argued to have a positive influence on society by giving those who are highly introverted or socially inept a low risk means of communication that removes interpersonal cues that could cause anxiety or panic attacks.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Campbell |first1=Andrew J. |last2=Cumming |first2=Steven R. |last3=Hughes |first3=Ian |title=Internet Use by the Socially Fearful: Addiction or Therapy? |journal=CyberPsychology & Behavior |date=February 2006 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=69\u201381 |doi=10.1089/cpb.2006.9.69 |pmid=16497120 }}</ref> It has also been argued among academics that correct moderation by an authority figure such as a boss or parent can improve the perceived well being of an individual who navigates social media.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Coyne |first1=Sarah M. |last2=Padilla-Walker |first2=Laura M. |last3=Day |first3=Randal D. |last4=Harper |first4=James |last5=Stockdale |first5=Laura |title=A Friend Request from Dear Old Dad: Associations Between Parent\u2013Child Social Networking and Adolescent Outcomes |journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking |date=January 2014 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=8\u201313 |doi=10.1089/cyber.2012.0623 |pmid=23845157 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fa6bb65447610c16d03154b31f0f5c50659c2126 }}</ref> As well as a variety of longitudinal studies that look at children at the start of the social media digital era up to the present, finding no correlation between social media screen time and mental health.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Coyne |first1=Sarah M. |last2=Padilla-Walker |first2=Laura M. |last3=Holmgren |first3=Hailey G. |last4=Stockdale |first4=Laura A. |title=Instagrowth: A Longitudinal Growth Mixture Model of Social Media Time Use Across Adolescence |journal=Journal of Research on Adolescence |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=897\u2013907 |doi=10.1111/jora.12424 |pmid=29953692 |year=2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Coyne |first1=Sarah M. |last2=Rogers |first2=Adam A. |last3=Zurcher |first3=Jessica D. |last4=Stockdale |first4=Laura |last5=Booth |first5=McCall |title=Does time spent using social media impact mental health?: An eight year longitudinal study |journal=Computers in Human Behavior |date=March 2020 |volume=104 |pages=106160 |doi=10.1016/j.chb.2019.106160 }}</ref>\n\n===Patents===\n[[File:Soc-net-paten-growth-chart.png|thumb|right|300px|Number of US social network patent applications published per year and patents issued per year]]\n\nThere has been rapid growth in the number of U.S. patent applications that cover new technologies related to social networking.

A 2013 study in the journal ''Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking'' investigated this phenomenon from the perspective of Facebook users. The number one reason for these users was privacy concerns (48%), being followed by a general dissatisfaction with the social networking website (14%), negative aspects regarding social network friends (13%) and the feeling of getting addicted to the social networking website (6%).

The problem with that is that you are left with no closure and the entire online world now knows you are no longer in a relationship.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vlahakis|first=George|title=The Breakup 2.0': A Look at How New Media Is Used to End Relationships|url=http://homepages.indiana.edu/web/page/normal/15705.html|publisher=Indiana University|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625120226/http://homepages.indiana.edu/web/page/normal/15705.html|archive-date=June 25, 2013|df=}}</ref> In a 2010 study conducted online, nearly one-quarter of the 1,000 individuals surveyed found out that their own relationship was over by seeing it on Facebook.<ref name=\"O'Dell\">{{cite web|last=O'Dell|first=Jolie|title=Would You Break Up via Facebook?|url=http://mashable.com/2010/06/21/facebook-break-up/|publisher=Mashable}}</ref> New media websites have made our private lives much more public, especially when it comes to breaking up, since updates are able to be immediately viewed by everyone in our networks (which tend to be more people than we would normally tell personally); for example, having friends comment on your newly changed \"single\" relationship status, and having to explain what happened can be distressing.\n\nThis creates further problems, as it is even more crucial to 'save face' after one's relationship has been broken when one is connected to new media technologies. [[Erving Goffman]] argues that all social life boils down to face-to-face interactions. These interpersonal interactions are mediated by what Goffman terms as \"face-work\", which are the actions undertaken to maintain consistency with one's face and to uphold the expressive order of social situations. Individuals attempt to keep a positive image of the self when interacting with others, and in order to do so, they may have to alter their appearance or manner in some way.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goffman|first=Erving|title=On Face-Work: Interactions Ritual: Essays on Face-to-Face Behavior|year=1967|publisher=Anchor|location=Garden City, NY|pages=5\u201345}}</ref> Such face-work can also be seen in new technologies, especially social media websites such as Facebook. If someone breaks up with you, you can actively choose what \"face\" you want to present to your friends, including your ex. You can choose to either post sad updates, which is the most natural thing you would want to do, or you can \"save face\" by posting happy updates and pictures of you going out with your friends. Even though you may be absolutely heartbroken within, Facebook allows you to hide your true feelings from the online world, and from your ex, by manipulating your profile. New media is being utilized as a tool for helping users present a desirable image of themselves, enabling them to save face in difficult situations. Nearly 35% of respondents in a study admitted to using their Facebook status to make someone think that they had plans, even if they did not.<ref name=\"O'Dell\"/>\n\nMany people find that the only way to really move on from a past relationship is to cut the person out of their life completely. Social media has made this process much more complicated and difficult. In a 2012 study, 48% of the participants stated they had remained friends with their ex on Facebook, and of these people, 88% stated they 'creeped' their ex after the breakup. Many digital social networking sites leave behind a trail of a user's interactions,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Melander|first=L.A.|title=College students' perceptions of intimate partner cyber harassment|journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|year=2010|volume=13|issue=3|pages=263\u2013268|doi=10.1089/cyber.2009.0221|pmid=20557245|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6c47d8b6027814a346ac7a11f57914aac66dc7ee}}</ref> so deleting content may be an arduous process, more difficult than simply burning or throwing away an entire box of letters, photos, and mementos.<ref>{{cite book|last=Van Dijck|first=Jose|title=Mediated memories in the digital age|year=2007|publisher=Stanford University Press}}</ref> Additionally, this content can still remain online.\n\n===Social overload===\nThe increasing number of messages and social relationships embedded in SNS also increases the amount of social information demanding a reaction from SNS users. Consequently, SNS users perceive they are giving too much social support to other SNS friends.

The eager to know what everyone was saying and the tendency to see if anyone shared new things are typical \"symptoms\" of this anxiety called [[Fear of missing out|FoMO]]. There is a study that examined possible connections between FOMO and social media engagement indicating that FoMO was associated with lower need satisfaction, mood and [[life satisfaction]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Przybylski|first=Andrew K.|last2=Murayama|first2=Kou|last3=DeHaan|first3=Cody R.|last4=Gladwell|first4=Valerie|date=July 2013|title=Motivational, emotional, and behavioral correlates of fear of missing out|url= |journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=29|issue=4|pages=1841\u20131848|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2013.02.014}}</ref>\n\nAnother type of social anxiety is the FoBM (fear of being missed).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2012/12/18/the-devolution-of-friendship-full-essay-pts-i-ii/|title=Social Media and the Devolution of Friendship: Full Essay (Pts I & II)|last=Boesel|first=Whitney Erin|date=December 18, 2012|work=Cyborgology|access-date=June 21, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> It comes from the situation that we can't produce share-content for people to consume.

Indeed, people tend to add friends to compensate low self-esteem and there is a high correlation between the number of \"friends\" on social media platforms and feeling social anxiety, leading to symptoms of major depression and dysthymia.  If we consider this aspect with regards to the relationships maintained through social media platforms, we can easily point out a change in our understanding of friendship. As a matter of fact, online platforms and social media services altered the old definition of friendship. Indeed, friendship \"redoubleth joys, and cutteth griefs in halves\" as stated by Francis Bacon.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.authorama.com/essays-of-francis-bacon-27.html| title=Of Friendship|publisher=Francis Bacon| date = 1601}}</ref> However, nowadays we see that Facebook friends, for instance, encourage negative feelings, such as envy, revenge and sadness.\n\nWhen it comes to friendship, we can wonder whether friendship on online platforms is a real form of friendship, or it is just a sort of metaphor to compensate for social communication problems. Actually, a lot of changes can be spotted in its old definition compared to the one in the era of social media. Friendship used to relate to the public sphere as explained in ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', however nowadays friendship is rather exposed publicly on different social media platforms.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n \nCroom et al. found that Facebook users know only a bit more than two thirds of their \"friends\" on the platform, meaning that they did not know one-third of the individuals in their friend-lists.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Croom |first1=Charles |last2=Gross |first2=Bay |last3=Rosen |first3=Larry D. |last4=Rosen |first4=Brad |title=What's Her Face(book)?

Social networking tools serve as a quick and easy way for the government to get the suggestion of the public and to keep the public updated on their activity, however this comes with a significant risk of abuse, for example, to cultivate a [[culture of fear]] such as that outlined in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' or ''[[THX-1138]]''.\n\nThe [[Centers for Disease Control]] demonstrated the importance of [[vaccinations]] on the popular children's site [[Whyville]] and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] has a virtual island on [[Second Life]] where people can explore caves or explore the [[effects of global warming]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itbusinessedge.com/topics/reader.aspx?oss=37848 |title=Government Agencies Establishing Presence on Social-Networking Sites |publisher=Itbusinessedge.com |accessdate=March 13, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=October 2019|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Likewise, NASA has taken advantage of a few social networking tools, including [[Twitter]] and [[Flickr]].

Social networks connect people at low cost; this can be beneficial for [[entrepreneur]]s and [[small business]]es looking to expand their contact bases. These networks often act as a customer relationship management tool for companies selling products and services. Companies can also use social networks for advertising in the form of banners and text ads. Since businesses operate globally, social networks can make it easier to keep in touch with contacts around the world. Applications for social networking sites have extended toward businesses and brands are creating their own, high functioning sites, a sector known as [[brand networking]]. It is the idea that a brand can build its consumer relationship by connecting their consumers to the brand image on a platform that provides them relative content, elements of participation, and a ranking or score system. Brand networking is a new way to capitalize on social trends as a marketing tool. The power of social networks is beginning to permeate into internal culture of businesses where they are finding uses for [[collaboration]], [[file sharing]] and [[knowledge transfer]]. The term \"[[enterprise social software]]\" is becoming increasingly popular for these types of applications.\n\n===Dating applications===\n{{See also|Online dating service}}\nMany social networks provide an online environment for people to communicate and exchange personal information for dating purposes. Intentions can vary from looking for a one time date, short-term relationships, and long-term relationships.<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,396461,00.html ''MySpace, Facebook Add Opportunity for Love, Trouble to Online Dating''], [[Fox News Channel|FoxNews.com]] website.</ref> Most of these social networks, just like online dating services, require users to give out certain pieces of information. This usually includes a user's age, gender, location, interests, and perhaps a picture. Releasing very personal information is usually discouraged for safety reasons.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5336688 ''MySpace Adds a Security Monitor''], [[NPR.com]] website.</ref> This allows other users to search or be searched by some sort of criteria, but at the same time, people can maintain a degree of anonymity similar to most online dating services. Online dating sites are similar to social networks in the sense that users create profiles to meet and communicate with others, but their activities on such sites are for the sole purpose of finding a person of interest to date. Social networks do not necessarily have to be for dating; many users simply use it for keeping in touch with friends, and colleagues.<ref>[http://www.internetnews.com/ec-news/article.php/3659911 ''Online Dating: Can Social Networks Cut In?''], [[internetnews.com]] website.</ref>\n\nHowever, an important difference between social networks and online dating services is the fact that online dating sites usually require a fee, where social networks are free.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://localtechwire.com/business/local_tech_wire/opinion/story/2449164/ |title=Online Dating vs. Social Networking \u2013 Which Will Emerge as Premier Matchmaker? |publisher=localtechwire.com|date=2008-08-18 }}</ref>\nThis difference is one of the reasons the online dating industry is seeing a massive decrease in revenue due to many users opting to use social networking services instead. Many popular online dating services such as [[Match.com]], [[Yahoo Personals]], and [[eHarmony.com]] are seeing a decrease in users, where social networks like [[MySpace]] and Facebook are experiencing an increase in users.<ref>[http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/story.aspx?guid={4640E6FF-17B8-40D5-901C-098EE74B03DD} ''Social networks vs. dating sites Commentary: Fragmenting may save online dating sites''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203122438/http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/story.aspx?guid=%7B4640E6FF-17B8-40D5-901C-098EE74B03DD%7D |date=December 3, 2007 }}, [[marketwatch.com]] website.</ref> The number of Internet users in the United States that visit online dating sites has fallen from a peak of 21% in 2003 to 10% in 2006.<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/2007/12/20/online-dating-love-tech-personal-cx_wt_1221dating.html ''Seeking Love Around The Web ''], ''[[Forbes]]'' website.</ref> Whether it is the cost of the services, the variety of users with different intentions, or any other reason, it is undeniable that social networking sites are quickly becoming the new way to find dates online.\n\n===Educational applications===\nThe [[National School Boards Association]] reports that almost 60% of students who use social networking talk about education topics online, and more than 50% talk specifically about schoolwork. Yet the vast majority of school districts have stringent rules against nearly all forms of social networking during the school day\u2014even though students and parents report few problem behaviors online. Social networks focused on supporting relationships between teachers and their students are now used for learning, educators professional development, and content sharing. [[HASTAC]] is a collaborative social network space for new modes of learning and research in higher education, K-12, and lifelong learning; [[Ning (website)|Ning]] supports teachers; [[TermWiki]], [[TeachStreet]] and other sites are being built to foster relationships that include educational blogs, portfolios, formal and ad hoc communities, as well as communication such as chats, discussion threads, and synchronous forums. These sites also have content sharing and rating features. Social networks are also emerging as online [[yearbook]]s, both public and private. One such service is [[MyYearbook]], which allows anyone from the general public to register and connect. A new trend emerging is <!--Predicate agrees in number with its subject.--> private label yearbooks accessible only by students, parents, and teachers of a particular school, similar to [[Facebook]]'s beginning within Harvard.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n===Finance applications===\nThe use of [[virtual economy|virtual currency]] systems inside social networks create new opportunities for global finance. [[Hub Culture]] operates a virtual currency [[Ven (currency)|Ven]] used for global transactions among members, product sales<ref>{{cite web|last=Jordan |first=Andy |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2009/09/09/the-currency-revolution/ |title=Wall street journal blog article about Ven |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=September 9, 2009 |accessdate=August 7, 2013}}</ref> and financial trades in commodities and carbon credits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finextra.com/news/fullstory.aspx?newsitemid=22475 |title=Virtual currency used for commodity trade|publisher=finextra.com |accessdate=August 7, 2013|date=2011-04-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2018/12/03/virtual-currencies-as-commodities/ |title=Virtual Currencies as Commodities?|publisher=}}</ref> In May 2010, [[carbon pricing]] contracts were introduced to the weighted basket of currencies and commodities that determine the floating exchange value of Ven.

The advantage of using a dedicated medical social networking site is that all the members are screened against the state licensing board list of practitioners.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.primarypsychiatry.com/aspx/articledetail.aspx?articleid=975 |title=Social Networking: Now Professionally Ready |publisher= primarypsychiatry.com }}</ref> A new trend is emerging with social networks created to help its members with various physical and mental ailments.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090529191957/http://www.doseofdigital.com/healthcare-pharma-social-media-wiki/ Comprehensive listing of medical applications using social networking] via Dose of Digital</ref> For people suffering from life-altering diseases or chronic health conditions, companies such as [[HealthUnlocked]] and [[PatientsLikeMe]] offers their members the chance to connect with others dealing with similar issues and share experiences. For alcoholics and addicts, SoberCircle gives people in recovery the ability to communicate with one another and strengthen their recovery through the encouragement of others who can relate to their situation. [[DailyStrength]] is also a website that offers support groups for a wide array of topics and conditions, including the support topics offered by [[PatientsLikeMe]] and SoberCircle. Some social networks aim to encourage healthy lifestyles in their users. [[SparkPeople]] and [[HealthUnlocked]] offer community and social networking tools for peer support during weight loss. [[Fitocracy]] and [[QUENTIQ]] are focused on exercise, enabling users to share their own workouts and comment on those of other users. Other aspects of social network usage include the analysis of data coming from existing social networks (such as Twitter) to discover large crowd concentration events (based on tweets location statistical analysis) and disseminate the information to e.g. mobility-challenged individuals for e.g. avoiding the specific areas and optimizing their journey in an urban environment.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kousiouris |first1=George |last2=Akbar |first2=Adnan |last3=Sancho |first3=Juan |last4=Ta-shma |first4=Paula |last5=Psychas |first5=Alexandros |last6=Kyriazis |first6=Dimosthenis |last7=Varvarigou |first7=Theodora |title=An integrated information lifecycle management framework for exploiting social network data to identify dynamic large crowd concentration events in smart cities applications |journal=Future Generation Computer Systems |date=January 2018 |volume=78 |pages=516\u2013530 |doi=10.1016/j.future.2017.07.026 |url=http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/841839/1/LCC_pre_final%20%281%29.pdf }}</ref>\n\n===Social and political applications===\nSocial networking sites have recently showed a value in social and political movements.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Auer |first1=Matthew R. |title=The Policy Sciences of Social Media |journal=Policy Studies Journal |date=November 2011 |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=709\u2013736 |doi=10.1111/j.1541-0072.2011.00428.x |ssrn=1974080 }}</ref> In the [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egyptian revolution]], [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] both played an allegedly pivotal role in keeping people connected to the revolt.

It was the first of its kind, as it successfully incorporated social media into its campaign winning strategy, evolving the way of political campaigns forevermore in the ever-changing technological world we find ourselves in today.

However, a year later, Obama was sending out voting reminders to thousands of people through Twitter, showing just how fast social media moves. Obama's campaign was current and needed to be successful in incorporating social media, as social media acts best and is most effective in real time.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nBuilding up to the 2012 presidential election, it was interesting to see how strong the influence of social media would be following the 2008 campaigns, where Obama's winning campaign had been social media-heavy, whereas McCain's campaign did not really grasp social media. JFK was the first president who really understood television, and similarly, Obama is the first president to fully understand the power of social media.<ref name=Rutledge>{{cite web |title=How Obama Won the Social Media Battle in the 2012 Presidential Campaign |url=http://mprcenter.org/blog/2013/01/how-obama-won-the-social-media-battle-in-the-2012-presidential-campaign/ |website=Media Psychology Research Center }}</ref> Obama has recognized social media is about creating relationships and connections and therefore used social media to the advantage of presidential election campaigns, in which Obama has dominated his opponents in terms of social media space.\n\nOther political campaigns have followed on from Obama's successful social media campaigns, recognizing the power of social media and incorporating it as a key factor embedded within their political campaigns, for example, Donald Trump's presidential electoral campaign, 2016. Dan Pfeiffer, Obama's former digital and social media guru, commented that Donald Trump is \"way better at the internet than anyone else in the GOP which is partly why he is winning\".<ref>{{cite news |first1=Hannah Jane |last1=Parkinson |year=2015 |title=Can Donald Trump's social media genius take him all the way to the White House?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/23/donald-trump-social-media-strategy-internet-republican-nomination-president |accessdate=April 25, 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian }}</ref>\n\nResearch has shown that 66% of social media users actively engage in political activity online, and like many other behaviors, online activities translate into offline ones.<ref name=Rutledge/> With research from the 'MacArthur Research Network on Youth and Participatory Politics' stating that young people who are politically active online are double as likely to vote than those who are not politically active online.<ref name=Rutledge/> Therefore, political applications of social networking sites are crucial, particularly to engage with the youth, who perhaps are the least educated in politics and the most in social networking sites.

It stars [[Amelia Kinkade]], [[Vlasta Vr\u00e1na]], [[Gregory Calpakis]], [[Tara Slone]], [[Christian Tessier]], [[Joel Gordon]], [[Larry Day]], [[Kristen Holden-Reid]], [[Stephanie Bauder]], and Patricia Rodriguez.\n\n==Plot==\nSeveral years have passed after the massacre at St. Rita's Academy and on [[Halloween]] night, [[police officer|Officer]] Larry ([[Larry Day]]) is on night watch at Hull House, where he is confronted and murdered by Angela ([[Amelia Kinkade]]) with his own police [[badge]].\n\nBad boy Vince ([[Kristen Holden-Ried]]), his promiscuous girlfriend Lois ([[Tara Slone]]), and their friends Nick ([[Gregory Calpakis]]) and Reggie ([[Joel Gordon]]) are cruising through town in Vince's sidekick Orson's ([[Christian Tessier]]) [[van]]. They stop to pick up head [[cheerleader]] Holly (Stephanie Bauder) and her shy friend Abbie (Patricia Rodriguez), who broke down on their way to the school dance, on the side of the road. Holly remembers Nick from [[algebra]] class on the first day of school, and Nick speculates Holly likes him.\n\nWhile stopped at a [[convenience store]], Reggie tries to buy beer with his brother's fake ID, but the unfriendly clerk pulls out a [[shotgun]]. Tempers escalate, and Vince steals the gun just as two police officers enter the store. One of the officers is accidentally shot when the clerk grabs Vince, and the other shoots Reggie in the stomach twice. A fight between the officer and Vince breaks out, destroying the store. The teenagers and a wounded Reggie pile into the van, Vince brings the shotgun, and Orson steals the police officer's gun, and they drive away. Fortunately, the officer they shot is wearing a [[bulletproof vest]] and is not harmed. Lieutenant Dewhurst ([[Vlasta Vr\u00e1na]]), who is due to retire at midnight that night, watches the [[security camera]] playback of what happened, and deduces that the clerk's story of a robbery is a cover for stealing the money from the [[cash register]], and that the kids are frightened teens, rather than vicious cop killers.\n\nIn the van, Vince notices that the gas tank is almost empty, and they decide to hide out at Hull House. Abbie tells Vince that the place is possessed and not to cross over the underground stream, since demons cannot cross over running water, but Vince forces them all to enter at gunpoint. Vince, trying to prove demons do not exist, taunts them and shoots a hole in the wall, causing the evil spirit that possesses the house to rush upstairs from the basement [[crematorium]] in the guise of Angela. Orson decides to stand up for himself and reveal that he has the cop's pistol, and tells Vince that he'll watch the others and Angela while Nick, Lois, and Vince make sure Angela is alone in the house.\n\nAngela puts on some music and does an [[erotic]] dance to distract Orson, and Abbie and Holly see this as an opportunity to escape with Reggie. Holly tries [[Hotwiring|hot wiring]] the van, but remembers that Nick is still inside. Angela begins to [[seduce]] Orson, simulating [[fellatio]] by sucking the bullets out of the gun through the barrel. Then she kisses Orson and her long, demon tongue shoots through the back of his head, killing him. Meanwhile, upstairs, Nick sneaks up on Vince and Lois who are making out, but fails to take the shotgun, and Vince fires the gun at Nick but misses. Outside, Holly hears the shot, and then overhears a voice over Larry's police radio and finds his car. Abbie leaves Reggie in the van to look for Holly, but Angela takes Abbie to a small chapel and plays on her insecurities and says she can make her an irresistible woman, and the demonic Angela kisses her and possesses her as well.\n\nThe badly wounded Reggie hears his name called, and leaves the van, only to be run over by the now possessed Orson. Abbie, who has been turned into a demonic version of her cat costume, seduces Vince until he hears the van crash. Lois, who is angry at Abbie because she thinks that she is now the perfect woman to fall in love with Vince, is scratched by Abbie after slapping her, then is pursued by Angela, who causes her hand to transform into a [[snake]] head which bites her. Holly smashes the police car window to call the police, but is attacked by Officer Larry. He chases Holly across the courtyard when she steps over the underground stream; Larry tries to step over it and is disintegrated. Nick finds Holly going back into the house to get everyone out. After encountering Orson, they hide in the attic and share a kiss. Orson appears, and Holly throws a can of [[lye]] in his face. They rush down to the hall when Dewhurst appears and he explains that he wants to help, then handcuffs them and takes them outside. Vince runs outside using Angela as a hostage. Dewhurst tells Vince that the officer he shot did not die, but Angela convinces Vince that Dewhurst is lying. Vince opens fire, but is shot through the eye and killed, and Angela returns to her demon form. The other demons appear, and Angela offers to let Dewhurst and Nick go free if she will willingly give up her pure and powerful soul. Holly agrees, and Angela turns Vince into a demon. The other demons make their way inside to [[Hell]].\n\nDewhurst creates a diversion, and stabs Angela with Nick's switchblade. Nick gets in the police car and rams Angela against a tree. As dawn breaks, Angela disappears inside the house. As the three make their way to the gate, Dewhurst tells Nick and Holly that they were not on the security camera at the store and no one will ever know they were there. Angela reappears just as they're about to escape and pulls Dewhurst's [[heart]] from his chest. She chases Holly and Nick and just before they cross the underground stream, Angela grabs Holly's arm. Nick ends up pulling Holly and Angela both over the stream and Angela dissolves. Holly leaves a cross made of sticks at the gate and promises she'll be back every Halloween to make sure no one ever goes inside again.  Holly and Nick then walk home and the last screen shot of the house shows the lights turning on and Angela laughing and saying \"Happy Halloween\".\n\n==Cast==\n* Larry Day as Officer Larry\n* [[Amelia Kinkade]] as [[Angela Franklin]]\n* [[Kristen Holden-Ried]] as Vince\n* Gregory Calpakis as Nick\n* [[Tara Slone]] as Lois\n* [[Christian Tessier]] as Orson\n* [[Joel Gordon]] as Reggie\n* Patricia Rodriguez as Abbie\n* Stephanie Bauder as Holly\n* Ian McDonald as Mr. Morris (Quicky Mart Clerk)\n* Richard Jutras as Officer Tony (Rookie Cop)\n* Minor Mustain as Veteran Cop\n* [[Vlasta Vr\u00e1na]] as Lieutenant Dewhurst\n* Richard Zeman as Macho Cop\n\n==Reception==\nCritical reception for the film was mostly negative, with [[JoBlo.com]] stating the film was \"too routine, uninspired, badly shot and cheap to deliver as a satisfying Night of the Demons sequel\".<ref>[http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/reviews/night-of-the-demons-3 Night of the Demons 3] JoBlo.com</ref> [[Deseret News]] panned the film, writing it was \"another sequel to a horror movie no one liked the first time around\".<ref>Deseret News.
