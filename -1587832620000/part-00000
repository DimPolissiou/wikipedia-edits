{"title_page": "Music on hold", "text_new": "{{more footnotes|date=February 2017}}\n{{refimprove|date=February 2017}}\n'''Music on hold''' ('''MOH''') is the business practice of playing recorded [[music]] to fill the silence that would be heard by [[telephone]] callers who have been placed [[Hold (telephone)|on hold]].  It is especially common in situations involving [[customer service]].\n\nMusic on hold is sometimes referred to as phone on hold, message on hold, on hold messaging, or hold music.\n\n==Development==\nMusic on hold was created by Alfred Levy, an inventor, factory owner, and entrepreneur. In 1962, Levy discovered a problem with the phone lines at his factory : a loose wire was touching a metal girder on the building. This made the building a giant receiver so that the audio broadcast signal from a radio station next door would transmit through the loose wire and could be heard when calls were put on hold.<ref>Article{{cite web|url=http://callsonhold.com/recognition.htm|title=Smithsonian recognizes Music on Hold. |publisher=CallsonHold.com |date=2005-01-01 |accessdate=2012-07-03}}</ref> Levy patented his work in 1966.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=PZ9lAAAAEBAJ&printsec=abstract&zoom=4#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Google Patent for Telephone Hold Program System  |date=2013-07-06 |accessdate=2012-07-03}}</ref> While other advancements have come to change and enhance the technology, it was this initial patent creation that began the evolution for today's music on hold.\n\n==Equipment and formats==\nMost MOH systems are integrated into a telephone system designed for businesses via an [[jack (connector)|audio jack]] on the [[telephone]] equipment labeled \"MOH\". There are also some units with built-in message on hold capabilities and units designed for small businesses without an extensive phone system.\n\nToday, equipment that supports physical media usually plays [[Compact disk|CDs]]. Some older systems may still use [[Compact audio cassette|cassette tapes]] (sometimes employing endless-loops), or [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel]] tape players. In each case, the unit loads the media into a digital memory chip to prevent premature wearing of the mechanical parts.\n\nEquipment that supports virtual media generally plays [[MP3]] files. Several types of units play these files. [[USB Flash Drive]] units allow an MP3 file to be received electronically, downloaded to a flash drive and connected to the player. Ethernet based remote load units connect via the network to a remote IP address. Phone line based remote load systems allow for a connection via an analog telephone line and dialing the number belonging to the unit.  For [[Voice over internet protocol|VoIP]] phone systems, MP3s are loaded without any equipment.\n\nNewer technology allows MP3 files to be downloaded automatically from the internet so that messages (or interesting content in the form of news and weather, amongst many) can be changed daily. The new \"online on hold\" technology makes the older technology redundant since it requires no additional hardware.  All these systems allow analog-to-digital audio storage and playback.\n\nAs of 2011 technology allows productions to be downloaded or streamed via the Internet or played through a USB flash drive. \n\n==Consumer perceptions==\nA number of studies have been conducted, which highlight consumer perceptions of music on hold, reinforcing its use by businesses to improve standards of call handling.\n\nA survey of more than 2,000 UK consumers commissioned by audio branding specialist [[PHMG (company)|PHMG]] revealed 70% of consumers are put on hold for more than 50% of their calls. When put on hold, 73% of callers want to hear something other than beeps or silence.<ref>Article{{cite web|url=http://www.freshbusinessthinking.com/news.php?NID=14476&Title=Seventy+per+cent+of+consumers+put+on+hold+for+longer+than+a+minute |title=Seventy per cent of consumers put on hold for longer than a minute |publisher=freshbusinessthinking.com |date=2012-06-30 |accessdate=2012-07-03}}</ref><ref>Article{{cite web|url=http://www.smallbusiness.co.uk/channels/sales-and-marketing/news/2110543/customers-perennially-on-hold.thtml |title=Customers perennially on hold |publisher=smallbusiness.co.uk |date=2012-06-29 |accessdate=2012-07-03}}</ref>\n\nA CNN survey found that 70 percent of callers in the United States who hold the line in silence hang up within 60 seconds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://work.chron.com/importance-onhold-messages-4665.html |title=The Importance of On-Hold Messages |author=Anna Assad |publisher=Houston Chronicle |accessdate=14 February 2013}}</ref> Meanwhile, research by North American Telecom found callers hearing music on hold will stay on the line 30 seconds longer than callers experiencing silence.\n\n==Source of music==\n\n===Radio===\nThe musical source may be as simple as playing a local [[radio station]] through the MOH jack.  This is unlawful without the express permission of the music title and mechanical copyright holders, or their representatives.\n* Although radio stations may provide the desired [[List of music radio formats|musical format]], there is no control over the specific songs that are played, some of which may be offensive to the callers, or depending on the music played, sound harsh in [[monaural]] sound. This kind of system is also vulnerable to interference.\n* Radio stations typically do not [[license]] their music for MOH systems.  In the United States, the radio broadcaster has no legal right to provide such a license as they, themselves, obtain a usage license from the music title owner for the right to broadcast said music for limited and personal use.  As mentioned above, re-broadcasting of a radio program over a phone system calls for licensing and [[copyright]] arrangements to be made for the owner of the MOH system.\n* Most radio stations (excluding those that are part of [[non-commercial educational]] radio networks) will play [[advertising|commercials]], which may be offensive or annoying to the caller.  Furthermore, it is possible that a [[competition|competitor's]] commercial may be played, which would be counter-productive.\n\n:See ''[[#Legal aspects|Legal aspects]]''.\n\nOwners of radio stations will usually air their broadcast signal as music on hold, using their main program signal, if there are several.  Examples include [[R\u00daV]] from [[Iceland]] using [[R\u00e1s 1]] as the on-hold music.\n\n===Off-the-shelf commercial CDs===\n{{main article|Commercial off-the-shelf}}\n\nCommercial CDs eliminate the problems encountered with radio commercials, and they offer control over the selection of music; they do not, however, grant proper license for MOH use unless users first obtain permission from the song title copyright owner (when the song is not in the \"public domain\") and the mechanical copyright owner, or bodies that represent them, such as BMI or ASCAP. (See \"Radio,\" above, for more details.)\n\n===Stock MOH CDs (with or without voice-overs)===\nCDs are available that have been specifically recorded and licensed for MOH systems.  These may contain only music, or may include periodic [[voice-over]]s with messages such as \"Your call is important\" or \"Please stay on the line\".  Such off-the-shelf recordings may be generic or may be specific to individual industries, but will not be customized for individual companies.\n\n===Custom-designed MOH===\nIn general, custom music on hold is advised to:\n#Control content\n#Control music genre\n#Use the on hold time to sell to a captive audience\n#Through a reputable on hold company be fully licensed and legal for on hold playback\n#Reduce hang-ups and make the business look more professional\n#Control length of programming based on average caller hold-time\n\nCDs (or other MOH formats, such as MP3 files) can be custom-created to suit the particular needs of a business.  The announcements can be scripted to emphasize particular attributes of the business such as location, store hours, or special promotions or services. These are typically used for up-selling and cross-selling callers. Companies can either record the messages themselves, or hire a music on hold production company.\n\n===Online on hold===\nA program loaded onto an existing computer and connected to the phone system can allow automatic content updates interspersed with company information.\n\n===Streaming MOH===\nStreaming MOH refers to a live music on hold stream (URL-based delivery) which can also include custom content. Streaming MOH can also refer to a streaming media server, as with Cisco Unified Call Manager, in which case RTP format is utilized.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Cisco Unified Communications SRND Based on Cisco Unified CallManager 4.x - Music on Hold [Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CallManager)] - Cisco Systems|url = http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/srnd/4x/42moh.html#wp1043752|website = www.cisco.com|access-date = 2016-01-15}}</ref>\n\n===Free on-hold programs===\nPrograms available to non-profit organizations at no cost. Very few companies offer absolutely free programs. The programs are available in generic and custom formats, and are delivered at no cost to the requesting organization.\n\n==Styles of music==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Opus Number One single cover.png|thumb|Opus Number One, a garage recording by then high schools students, is the default on hold music for Cisco Call Manager]] -->{{Redirect|Opus Number One|the 1943 song|Opus No. 1}}\n\nThe style of music played by MOH systems depends largely on the type of business offering the service.  It is generally best to present music that will not be offensive to the audience, but that would also be of particular interest to the typical caller. A western apparel store may choose to play [[country music]]. A Christian book store may choose to play popular [[Christian music]]. A university may choose to play [[European classical music|classical music]]. An athletic ticket office may choose to play the team or school's [[fight song]]. Light classics, [[smooth jazz]], and [[beautiful music]] are common choices, as is fully [[synthesizer|synthesized]] melodic music.\n\nAmong the best known is \"Opus Number One\", largely forgotten by Tim Carleton and high-school friend Darrick Deel, the teenagers that recorded it on a four-track tape recorder in 1989.  Deel went on to work for [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]] in building the company's first [[VoIP phone]].  When a need for default on hold music came up, he recalled the track he and Carleton had recorded and reached out to Carleton for approval.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/516/stuck-in-the-middle|title=Stuck in the Middle|last=Glass|first=Ira|date=January 14, 2014|website=|publisher=This American Life|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=23 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.cisco.com/collaboration/ciscos-musical-legacy-the-story-behind-the-song-youll-definitely-recognize|title=The Story Behind the Song You\u2019ll Definitely Recognize|last=Gunasena|first=Nadee|date=February 3, 2014|website=Cisco Blog|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130124028/https://blogs.cisco.com/collaboration/ciscos-musical-legacy-the-story-behind-the-song-youll-definitely-recognize|archive-date=2018-11-30|access-date=}}</ref> The song has been sampled by electronic artists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Tim-Carleton/Opus-No.-1/|title=Opus No. 1 by Tim Carleton and Darrick Deel on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\n==Recent trends==\nWith the application of newer equipment, music on hold devices can now interact with the caller. No additional programs are required on the platform, as all the logic is done with the MoH device. This can include services such as 'polling on hold', rating your customer service officer anonymously, etc. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nThe trend toward hosted IP telephony for business phone systems is demanding changes in music on hold message technology.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wheeler|first=Tom|title=The IP Transition: Starting Now|journal=FCC Blog|date=November 19, 2013|pages=1|url=http://www.fcc.gov/blog/ip-transition-starting-now}}</ref>\n\n==Legal aspects==\n\n===Copyright law===\nIn the US, and other countries where [[copyright law]]s are practiced, authors are granted copyright protection on their musical compositions. Such copyright protection has existed since just after the turn of the 20th century and most music written prior to 1900\u20131910\u2014from impressionism back to baroque and antiquity are said to be \"in the [[public domain]].\" Use of any said music prior to the creation of these copyright laws may be presumed to be free for use by all\u2014although individual titles may have been later copyrighted through a change in the composition or arrangement. The use of copyrighted music is not for free use in the public domain.\n\nAll music written after this period, which is copyrighted under multiple acts of congress, are owned by the author(s) or their assignees. The use of this music is protected and controlled in order that the owner may derive usage income. Specific to telephonic MOH (music-on-hold), the US laws currently protect the copyright owners from unlawful, unpermitted use of their music titles in over-the-phone broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soundcommunication.holdcom.com/bid/96828/Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-Music-Licensing |title=Everything You Need To Know About Music Licensing |author=J. Durante |publisher=Sound Communication}}</ref> Any person or business wishing to use current, popular, post 1900\u20131910, copyrighted music for MOH purposes may only lawfully do so by obtaining permission from the owner. Currently, performance rights societies such as ASCAP, BMI and SESAC will sell blanket permission to use music titles in their catalog for MOH purposes\u2014for an express annual fee\u2014calculated by size and frequency of usage. Failure to obtain this paid permission is a violation of US copyright laws.\n\nThis same copyright protection is also true in the rebroadcast of any radio program. As mentioned earlier, the broadcaster has been assigned a narrow and specific usage license to air copyrighted song titles. This does not include permission to any person or business to re-broadcast that program on telephonic MOH. The broadcaster may not promote such unlawful use and is not an owner who has any lawful right to grant MOH usage permission. They do not hold the ownership of the title and have no right to license use in any way. Those who plug radio broadcast into their telephone MOH without first obtaining paid permission through the owner's agents (ASCAP, BMI or SESAC) may be in violation of copyright law and may be prosecuted under existing federal laws.\n\n===Mechanical copyright===\nA second copyright exists when it comes to licensing use for telephonic MOH. A piece of music, as mentioned above, is copyrighted and may be licensed for use as a music title and is understood to be a combination of melody, harmony and, where applicable, lyrics.  However, neither radio listeners nor MOH listeners could hear this music unless it was recorded - providing a delivery medium whereby the \"music\" becomes a \"performance.\"  As mentioned elsewhere, in countries such as the US, where said copyright laws are enforced, nearly every recording of a song title holds its own \"mechanical copyright.\"\n\nFor most of the 20th century, music was recorded in studios, produced by record company executives, producers, arrangers and engineers who were hired to deliver the artist's finished recordings for mastering and duplication - for sale on the varied media: 78, 45 and 33 RPM vinyl, reel-to-reel, 8-track tape, cassette and [[compact disc]].  To protect their investment, the record companies obtain a mechanical copyright in order to protect and control the recording with which they derive usage and sales income.  (For those still uncertain of the difference between \"song title\" and \"mechanical\" copyrights,  consider the Capitol Records lawsuit for copyright infringement against Nike some 20 years ago.  Nike legally obtained permission to use the Beatles song title \"Revolution\" from the title's owner, Michael Jackson. They used the Capitol Records owned recording of the Beatles' performance, but failed to obtain and pay for permission and use.  Capitol Records sued and prevailed because Nike ONLY had a license to use the title and did not have a license to use the mechanical recording.)\n\nTherefore, persons or businesses wishing to play music that falls \"in the public domain\" are still legally required to obtain permission to use the mechanical recording of this music, from the mechanical copyright holder.'''  '''And where the use is of copyrighted music, the same applies.  In all cases, before a song title may be broadcast on a telephone MOH, said use must be approved and licensed from BOTH the \"song title\" copyright owner (if it is NOT in public domain) and the \"mechanical\" copyright owner. '''\n\n===Enforcement===\nIt is generally known within the on-hold industry that some performance rights societies, with regional offices and staff, both monitor and prosecute persons and businesses that infringe on the copyright of title holders in their libraries. [[ASCAP]] and [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] are both aggressive about this, from time to time. It is not known whether any record companies are currently or actively monitoring and prosecuting violators of their mechanical license.\n\n==See also==\n\n===Genres===\n*[[Background music]]\n*[[Elevator music]]\n<!-- Please only link Wikipedia articles, not external sites -->\n\n===Notable companies===\n<!-- only companies with existing Wikipedia pages, please -->\nAs of 2010, the music-on-hold/message-on-hold business was a 100+ million dollar industry{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} with more than 300 different vendors to choose from producing custom content amounting to less than $1M in sales per company - including various manufacturers of specific-duty, message-on-hold devices.\n\n*[[Muzak Corporation]]\n*[[Grace Digital]]\n*[[PH Media Group]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Music On Hold}}\n[[Category:Customer service]]\n[[Category:Music industry]]\n", "text_old": "{{more footnotes|date=February 2017}}\n{{refimprove|date=February 2017}}\n'''Music on hold''' ('''MOH''') is the business practice of playing recorded [[music]] to fill the silence that would be heard by [[telephone]] callers who have been placed [[Hold (telephone)|on hold]].

No additional programs are required on the platform, as all the logic is done with the MoH device. This can include services such as 'polling on hold', rating your customer service officer anonymously, etc. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nThe trend toward hosted IP telephony for business phone systems is demanding changes in music on hold message technology.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wheeler|first=Tom|title=The IP Transition: Starting Now|journal=FCC Blog|date=November 19, 2013|pages=1|url=http://www.fcc.gov/blog/ip-transition-starting-now}}</ref>\n\n==Legal aspects==\n\n===Copyright law===\nIn the US, and other countries where [[copyright law]]s are practiced, authors are granted copyright protection on their musical compositions. Such copyright protection has existed since just after the turn of the 20th century and most music written prior to 1900\u20131910\u2014from impressionism back to baroque and antiquity are said to be \"in the [[public domain]].\" Use of any said music prior to the creation of these copyright laws may be presumed to be free for use by all\u2014although individual titles may have been later copyrighted through a change in the composition or arrangement. The use of copyrighted music is not for free use in the public domain.\n\nAll music written after this period, which is copyrighted under multiple acts of congress, are owned by the author(s) or their assignees.  The use of this music is protected and controlled in order that the owner may derive usage income. Specific to telephonic MOH (music-on-hold), the US laws currently protect the copyright owners from unlawful, unpermitted use of their music titles in over-the-phone broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soundcommunication.holdcom.com/bid/96828/Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-Music-Licensing |title=Everything You Need To Know About Music Licensing |author=J. Durante |publisher=Sound Communication}}</ref> Any person or business wishing to use current, popular, post 1900-1910, copyrighted music for MOH purposes may only lawfully do so by obtaining permission from the owner. Currently, performance rights societies such as ASCAP, BMI and SESAC will sell blanket permission to use music titles in their catalog for MOH purposes\u2014for an express annual fee\u2014calculated by size and frequency of usage. Failure to obtain this paid permission is a violation of US copyright laws.\n\nThis same copyright protection is also true in the rebroadcast of any radio program. As mentioned earlier, the broadcaster has been assigned a narrow and specific usage license to air copyrighted song titles. This does not include permission to any person or business to re-broadcast that program on telephonic MOH. The broadcaster may not promote such unlawful use and is not an owner who has any lawful right to grant MOH usage permission. They do not hold the ownership of the title and have no right to license use in any way. Those who plug radio broadcast into their telephone MOH without first obtaining paid permission through the owner's agents (ASCAP, BMI or SESAC) may be in violation of copyright law and may be prosecuted under existing federal laws.\n\n===Mechanical copyright===\nA second copyright exists when it comes to licensing use for telephonic MOH. A piece of music, as mentioned above, is copyrighted and may be licensed for use as a music title and is understood to be a combination of melody, harmony and, where applicable, lyrics.  However, neither radio listeners nor MOH listeners could hear this music unless it was recorded - providing a delivery medium whereby the \"music\" becomes a \"performance.\"  As mentioned elsewhere, in countries such as the US, where said copyright laws are enforced, nearly every recording of a song title holds its own \"mechanical copyright.\"\n\nFor most of the 20th century, music was recorded in studios, produced by record company executives, producers, arrangers and engineers who were hired to deliver the artist's finished recordings for mastering and duplication - for sale on the varied media: 78, 45 and 33 RPM vinyl, reel-to-reel, 8-track tape, cassette and [[compact disc]].  To protect their investment, the record companies obtain a mechanical copyright in order to protect and control the recording with which they derive usage and sales income.  (For those still uncertain of the difference between \"song title\" and \"mechanical\" copyrights,  consider the Capitol Records lawsuit for copyright infringement against Nike some 20 years ago.  Nike legally obtained permission to use the Beatles song title \"Revolution\" from the title's owner, Michael Jackson. They used the Capitol Records owned recording of the Beatles' performance, but failed to obtain and pay for permission and use.  Capitol Records sued and prevailed because Nike ONLY had a license to use the title and did not have a license to use the mechanical recording.)\n\nTherefore, persons or businesses wishing to play music that falls \"in the public domain\" are still legally required to obtain permission to use the mechanical recording of this music, from the mechanical copyright holder.'''  '''And where the use is of copyrighted music, the same applies.  In all cases, before a song title may be broadcast on a telephone MOH, said use must be approved and licensed from BOTH the \"song title\" copyright owner (if it is NOT in public domain) and the \"mechanical\" copyright owner. '''\n\n===Enforcement===\nIt is generally known within the on-hold industry that some performance rights societies, with regional offices and staff, both monitor and prosecute persons and businesses that infringe on the copyright of title holders in their libraries. [[ASCAP]] and [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] are both aggressive about this, from time to time. It is not known whether any record companies are currently or actively monitoring and prosecuting violators of their mechanical license.\n\n==See also==\n\n===Genres===\n*[[Background music]]\n*[[Elevator music]]\n<!-- Please only link Wikipedia articles, not external sites -->\n\n===Notable companies===\n<!-- only companies with existing Wikipedia pages, please -->\nAs of 2010, the music-on-hold/message-on-hold business was a 100+ million dollar industry{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} with more than 300 different vendors to choose from producing custom content amounting to less than $1M in sales per company - including various manufacturers of specific-duty, message-on-hold devices.\n\n*[[Muzak Corporation]]\n*[[Grace Digital]]\n*[[PH Media Group]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Music On Hold}}\n[[Category:Customer service]]\n[[Category:Music industry]]\n", "name_user": "Jprg1966", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCopyright law", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_on_hold"}

Gregory was captain of the [[clipper ship]] ''[[Tejuca]]'' when she foundered and sank in an 1856 hurricane, with Gregory and most of his crew only being rescued at the last moment by the courageous intervention of a passing ship. Gregory was later commander of the [[barque|bark]] ''Albers'', when in 1857 he is said to have put down a riot on his ship virtually singlehanded. \n\nWith the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in April 1861, Gregory took a temporary commission in the [[United States Navy]] and was given command of the [[brig]] {{USS|Bohio}}. ''Bohio'' under Gregory's command took a number of prizes, the most remarkable example of which involved a ruse carried out by Gregory to disguise his vessel as a steamship in order to deceive the enemy into surrendering. \n\nAfter resigning from the Navy, Gregory struggled to find a new command due to the exigencies of war. His last voyage as a mariner was reportedly made in 1866.\n\n== Life and career ==\n\nWilliam D.

Here Gregory left the vessel and returned to San Francisco in another ship, arriving April 4, 1861.<ref name=lindsey1915_p69/> \n\nAn anecdote from Gregory's service on ''Albers'' appeared in an article printed later in ''[[The Boston Globe]]''. According to the article, Gregory had been obliged to hire a new crew at the port of [[Macau]] during his 1857 voyage. On the advice of the American [[Consul (representative)|consul]], he paid the crew in advance, but he later heard that his new crew included a number of men known for jumping ship with their wages.<ref name=bostonglobe_21jan1900>{{cite news |last= Roads |first= Samuel Jr |date= 1900-01-21 |title= Mutinies on New England Ships |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49278477/w-d-gregory-puts-down-riot-on-bark/ |work= The Boston Globe |page= 33 }}</ref>\n\nWhile sharing a meal with the new owner of ''Albers'' at the latter's residence, Gregory received word that the new crew were running wild aboard ship. Hurrying back to the vessel, Gregory caught one crew member attempting to swim ashore, and dragged him back aboard.<ref name=bostonglobe_21jan1900/> Arriving on deck, he found other crew members \"running about brandishing knives\",<ref name=bostonglobe_21jan1900/> while the mate and a loyal shipmate were at a loss to stop them. The ''Globe'' describes what occurred next:<ref name=bostonglobe_21jan1900/> \n\n<blockquote>Capt. Gregory was armed with a stout cane, and as he stepped on the deck began knocking the rioters down, right and left. Then he went at them with his fists, fighting so effectually that order was soon restored. The ship was taken down the stream, and the voyage to [[Manila]], thence to [[Hong Kong]], was made without further trouble.<ref name=bostonglobe_21jan1900/></blockquote> \n\nNot long after Gregory's return to the United States, his employers, Bush & Wilder, purchased a new ship for him to take on another voyage to China. Before he could do so however, the United States Navy requisitioned the vessel for service in the [[American Civil War]] which had recently broken out, thus depriving him of his new command.<ref name=lindsey1915_p69/>\n\n=== Naval service (1861&ndash;1862) ===  \n[[ File:E.

To address the resulting critical shortage of personnel, the Navy created temporary commissions, enabling volunteers from the [[merchant marine]] to become naval officers with little or no additional training.<ref name=schultz1990_pp89-90/> In the autumn of 1861, William D.

Here, Gregory received intelligence that a \"suspicious-looking\" schooner flying the British flag had been recently hailed in the vicinity by a US Navy ship, but allowed to proceed because her papers seemed to be in order. Gregory requested and received permission to pursue the vessel, and at 11 pm set sail on an interception course.<ref name=roads1880_pp306-307>Roads 1880. pp. [https://hdl.handle.net/2027/loc.ark:/13960/t9668m935?urlappend=%3Bseq=348 306\u2013307].</ref> \n\nAt 5 am the next morning, ''Bohio'' sighted the vessel, but the latter immediately set all sails to evade her pursuer, and a chase eventuated. Finding after some hours that he was unable to gain on the other ship, Gregory devised a ruse by which he hoped to deceive her captain. He had his crew erect a 12-foot length of [[stovepipe]], fastened to some barrels on deck, to resemble a [[smokestack]]. Sand was placed in the bottom barrel to protect the deck, and a fire was then started in the stovepipe \"with bits of rope, old junk, tar and other materials\"<ref name=roads1880_pp306-307/> to create smoke. Simultaneously, he had the crew constantly wet the sails to increase ''Bohio''{{'}}s speed. Seeing ''Bohio'' gaining on his ship, and the smoke coming from the stovepipe, the captain of the fleeing vessel was deceived into thinking that ''Bohio'' was a steamship, and concluding that the race was futile, [[heaving to|hove to]] at about 2 pm and surrendered.

recorded in 1070, soon after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]]. Jews living in the United Kingdom at this time experienced religious discrimination and it is thought that the [[blood libel]] which accused Jews of ritual murder originated in Northern England, leading to [[York Massacre|massacres]] and increasing discrimination.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-2|[2]]]</sup> The Jewish presence continued until [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]]'s [[Edict of Expulsion]] in 1290.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-3|[3]]]</sup>\n\nJews were readmitted to the United Kingdom by [[Oliver Cromwell]] in 1655, though it is believed that [[Crypto-Judaism|crypto-Jews]] lived in England during the expulsion.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-4|[4]]]</sup> Jews were regularly subjected to discrimination and humiliation which waxed and waned over the centuries, gradually declining.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-5|[5]]]</sup>\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the number of Jews in Britain greatly increased due to the exodus from [[Russia]], which resulted in a large community forming in the [[East End of London]].<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-6|[6]]]</sup> Popular sentiment against immigration was used by the [[British Union of Fascists]] to incite hatred against Jews, leading to the [[Battle of Cable Street]] in 1936, when the fascists were forced to abandon their march through an area with a large Jewish population when the police clearing the way were unable to remove barricades defended by trade unionists, left wing groups and residents.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-7|[7]]]</sup>\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Holocaust]], undisguised racial hatred of [[Jews]] became unacceptable in [[British society]]. Outbursts of antisemitism emanating from [[Far right in the United Kingdom|far right groups]] continued, however, leading to the formation of the [[43 Group]] led by Jewish ex-servicemen which broke up fascist meetings from 1945 to early 1950.\n\nRecords of antisemitic incidents have been compiled since 1984, although changing reporting practices and levels of reporting make comparison over time difficult.

recorded in 1070, soon after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]]. Jews living in the United Kingdom at this time experienced religious discrimination and it is thought that the [[blood libel]] which accused Jews of ritual murder originated in Northern England, leading to [[York Massacre|massacres]] and increasing discrimination.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-2|[2]]]</sup> The Jewish presence continued until [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]]'s [[Edict of Expulsion]] in 1290.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-3|[3]]]</sup>\n\nJews were readmitted to the United Kingdom by [[Oliver Cromwell]] in 1655, though it is believed that [[Crypto-Judaism|crypto-Jews]] lived in England during the expulsion.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-4|[4]]]</sup> Jews were regularly subjected to discrimination and humiliation which waxed and waned over the centuries, gradually declining.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-5|[5]]]</sup>\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the number of Jews in Britain greatly increased due to the exodus from [[Russia]], which resulted in a large community forming in the [[East End of London]].<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-6|[6]]]</sup> Popular sentiment against immigration was used by the [[British Union of Fascists]] to incite hatred against Jews, leading to the [[Battle of Cable Street]] in 1936, when the fascists were forced to abandon their march through an area with a large Jewish population when the police clearing the way were unable to remove barricades defended by trade unionists, left wing groups and residents.<sup>[[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom#cite note-7|[7]]]</sup>\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Holocaust]], undisguised racial hatred of [[Jews]] became unacceptable in [[British society]]. Outbursts of antisemitism emanating from [[Far right in the United Kingdom|far right groups]] continued, however, leading to the formation of the [[43 Group]] led by Jewish ex-servicemen which broke up fascist meetings from 1945 to early 1950.\n\nThe [[Community Security Trust]] (CST) was formed in 1994 to \"[protect] British Jews from antisemitism and related threats\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cst.org.uk/about-cst|title=About CST \u2013 CST \u2013 Protecting Our Jewish Community|website=cst.org.uk|access-date=2019-07-31}}</ref> It works in conjunction with the police and other authorities to protect Jewish schools, Synagogues, and other community institutions.\n\nWhile records of antisemitic incidents have been compiled since 1984, changing reporting practices and levels of reporting make comparison over time difficult.\n\n==Communal institutions==\n<!--more specific inclusion criteria useful: include only Jewish orgs based in UK that have articles (no redlinks or EXT), sorted alphabetically, these can be found in [[Category:Jewish organisations based in the United Kingdom]] (and sub cats), and other cats-->\nBritish Jewish communal organisations include:\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Anglo-Jewish Association]]\n* [[Association of Jewish Refugees]]\n* [[Board of Deputies of British Jews|Board of Deputies]] (1760)\n* [[CCJO Ren\u00e9 Cassin]]\n* [[Community Security Trust]]\n* [[Institute for Jewish Policy Research]]\n* [[Jewish Board of Guardians (United Kingdom)|Jewish Board of Guardians]]\n* [[Jewish Book Week|Jewish Book Council]]\n* [[Jewish Care]]\n* [[Jewish Council for Racial Equality]]\n* [[Jewish Genealogical Society of Great Britain]]\n* [[Jewish Leadership Council]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejlc.org/members|title=Members|publisher=}}</ref>\n* [[JW3]] \u2013 a London venue\n* [[Kisharon]]\n* [[League of British Jews]]\n* [[League of Jewish Women]]\n* [[Leo Baeck Institute London]]\n* [[Liberal Judaism (United Kingdom)|Liberal Judaism]]\n* [[Limmud]]\n* [[London Jewish Forum]]\n* [[London Jewish Cultural Centre]]\n* [[Maccabaeans]]\n* [[Mitzvah Day International]]\n* [[Movement for Reform Judaism]]\n* [[Norwood (charity)|Norwood]]\n* [[Scottish Council of Jewish Communities]]\n* [[Tzelem]]\n* [[UCL Institute of Jewish Studies]]\n* [[UK Jewish Film Festival]]\n* [[Union of Jewish Students]]\n* [[United Restitution Organization]]\n* [[United Synagogue]]\n* [[Union of Jewish Women]]\n* [[World Jewish Relief]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United Kingdom|Judaism}}\n* [[List of British Jews]]\n* [[List of Jewish communities in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[History of the Jews in England]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Scotland]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Ireland]]\n* [[History of the Jews in the Isle of Man]]\n* [[Emancipation of the Jews in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|group= n}}\n\n===References===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite web |url= http://www.antisemitism.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/All-Party-Parliamentary-Inquiry-into-Antisemitism-REPORT.pdf |title= Report of the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Antisemitism |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130822190807/http://www.antisemitism.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/All-Party-Parliamentary-Inquiry-into-Antisemitism-REPORT.pdf |archivedate= 22 August 2013 }}&nbsp;{{small|(430&nbsp;KB)}}.
