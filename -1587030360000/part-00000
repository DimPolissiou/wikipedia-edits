He held the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] [[heavyweight]] title twice, from 2007 to 2009 and from 2014 to 2016, and was the first Asian boxer to win a world heavyweight title by any of the four major sanctioning bodies.\n\nChagaev is one of a few professional boxers to resume his [[Amateur boxing|amateur]] career after a few professional bouts in 1997. Chagaev was reinstated as an amateur by [[AIBA]] the following year as his professional bouts were declared [[exhibition fight|exhibitions]].\n\nIn 2007, Chagaev defeated then-unbeaten [[Nikolai Valuev]] to win his first WBA heavyweight title, and would make two successful defences. Due to injuries and being unable to grant Valuev a rematch in 2009, the WBA stripped Chagaev of the title. He went on to suffer his first professional loss in the same year to unified heavyweight champion [[Wladimir Klitschko]].\n\nChagaev won the [[WBA (Regular)]] heavyweight title by defeating [[Fres Oquendo]] in 2014. He made one successful defence, then lost the title to [[Lucas Browne]] in 2016. However, after Browne [[doping in sport|failed a drug test]], the WBA reinstated Chagaev as champion, but he was once again stripped of the title in July after failing to pay sanctioning fees. On 28 July 2016 he announced his retirement from boxing due to ongoing eye injuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allboxing.ru/news/20160728-0832/smi-ruslan-chagaev-reshil-zavershit-kareru-iz-za-problem-s-glazami|title=\u0421\u041c\u0418: \u0420\u0443\u0441\u043b\u0430\u043d \u0427\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b \u0437\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0440\u0443 \u0438\u0437-\u0437\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c \u0441 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043c\u0438|date=July 28, 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAs an amateur, Chagaev won gold medals at the [[2001 World Amateur Boxing Championships|2001 World Championships]] and [[1999 Asian Amateur Boxing Championships|1999 Asian Championships]], in the heavyweight and [[super-heavyweight]] divisions respectively.\n\n==Amateur career==\nChagaev won gold at the [[1997 World Amateur Boxing Championships]] heavyweight, defeating [[F\u00e9lix Sav\u00f3n]] in the finals, but later he was stripped of the championship for having 2 professional bouts in the United States before the tournament.

However, the fight had to be cancelled after Chagaev suffered a complete tear of an [[Achilles tendon]] during his final sparring session in preparation for the defense, causing Chagaev's second postponement of the match. The WBA elected to make Chagaev \"Champion in Recess\" due to the injury that Chagaev sustained and necessary recovery time and mandated that top-contenders Valuev and John Ruiz meet for the vacated title.

The winner would take the vacant ''[[The Ring (magazine)|Ring]]'' magazine heavyweight title in the battle between their number 1 ranked heavyweight, Klitschko, and third ranked Chagaev.  Klitschko was defending his [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]], [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] and [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] heavyweight titles. Chagaev's [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] champion in recess title was not on the line. There were 61,000 fans in attendance at the [[Veltins-Arena|Veltins Arena]]. Klitschko controlled the tempo of the fight from the very beginning and hit Chagaev at will with the jab. He hit Chagaev with several hard right crosses and never allowed him to build momentum.

He held the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] [[heavyweight]] title twice, from 2007 to 2009 and from 2014 to 2016, and was the first Asian boxer to win a world heavyweight title by any of the four major sanctioning bodies.\n\nChagaev is one of a few professional boxers to resume his [[Amateur boxing|amateur]] career after a few professional bouts in 1997. Chagaev was reinstated as an amateur by [[AIBA]] the following year as his professional bouts were declared [[exhibition fight|exhibitions]].\n\nIn 2007, Chagaev defeated then-unbeaten [[Nikolai Valuev]] to win his first WBA heavyweight title, and would make two successful defences. Due to injuries and being unable to grant Valuev a rematch in 2009, the WBA stripped Chagaev of the title. He went on to suffer his first professional loss in the same year to unified heavyweight champion [[Wladimir Klitschko]].\n\nChagaev won the [[WBA (Regular)]] heavyweight title by defeating [[Fres Oquendo]] in 2014. He made one successful defence, then lost the title to [[Lucas Browne]] in 2016. However, after Browne [[doping in sport|failed a drug test]], the WBA reinstated Chagaev as champion, but he was once again stripped of the title in July after failing to pay sanctioning fees. On 28 July 2016 he announced his retirement from boxing due to ongoing eye injuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allboxing.ru/news/20160728-0832/smi-ruslan-chagaev-reshil-zavershit-kareru-iz-za-problem-s-glazami|title=\u0421\u041c\u0418: \u0420\u0443\u0441\u043b\u0430\u043d \u0427\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b \u0437\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0440\u0443 \u0438\u0437-\u0437\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c \u0441 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043c\u0438|date=July 28, 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAs an amateur, Chagaev won gold medals at the [[2001 World Amateur Boxing Championships|2001 World Championships]] and [[1999 Asian Amateur Boxing Championships|1999 Asian Championships]], in the heavyweight and [[super-heavyweight]] divisions respectively.\n\n==Amateur career==\nChagaev won gold at the [[1997 World Amateur Boxing Championships]] heavyweight, defeating [[F\u00e9lix Sav\u00f3n]] in the finals, but later he was stripped of the championship for having 2 professional bouts in the United States before the tournament.

Klitschko was defending his [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]], [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] and [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] heavyweight titles.

Klitschko controlled the tempo of the fight from the very beginning and hit Chagaev at will with the jab. He hit Chagaev with several hard right crosses and never allowed him to build momentum.

[[Maurice Peress]] and [[Hershy Kay]] contributed orchestrations. Although unsuccessful at its premiere, ''Candide'' has now overcome the unenthusiastic reaction of early audiences and critics and achieved enormous popularity. It is very popular among major music schools as a student show because of the quality of its music and the opportunities it offers to student singers.{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\n==Origins==\n''Candide'' was originally conceived by [[Lillian Hellman]] as a play with incidental music in the style of her previous work, ''[[The Lark (play)|The Lark]]''. Bernstein, however, was so excited about this idea that he convinced Hellman to do it as a \"comic operetta\"; she then wrote the original libretto for the operetta. Many lyricists worked on the show: first [[James Agee]] (whose work was ultimately not used), then [[Dorothy Parker]], [[John La Touche (lyricist)|John Latouche]] and [[Richard Wilbur]]. In addition, the lyrics to \"I Am Easily Assimilated\" were done by Leonard and [[Felicia Bernstein]], and Hellman wrote the words to \"Eldorado\". [[Hershy Kay]] orchestrated all but the [[overture]], which Bernstein did himself.<ref name=Peyser>{{cite book | last=Peyser | first=Joan | authorlink=Joan Peyser | title=Bernstein, a biography | location=New York | publisher=Beech Tree Books | year=1987 | isbn=0-688-04918-4 | page=[https://archive.org/details/bernsteinbiograp00peys/page/248 248] | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/bernsteinbiograp00peys }}</ref>\n\n==Performance history==\n\n===1956 original Broadway production===\n''Candide'' first opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] as a [[musical theatre|musical]] on December 1, 1956 at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]].

It featured [[Robert Rounseville]] as Candide, [[Barbara Cook]] as Cunegonde, [[Max Adrian]] as Dr. Pangloss, and [[Irra Petina]] as the Old Lady. This production was a box office disaster, running only two months for a total of 73 performances. Hellman's libretto was criticized in a ''[[New York Times]]'' review as being too serious:<ref name=Peyser />\n{{quote|When Voltaire is ironic and bland, [Hellman] is explicit and vigorous. When he makes lightning, rapier thrusts, she provides body blows. Where he is diabolical, [she] is humanitarian ... the libretto ... seems too serious for the verve and mocking lyricism of Leonard Bernstein's score which, without being strictly 18th century, maintains, with its gay pastiche of past styles and forms, a period quality.<ref name=Peyser />}}\n\n===European premieres===\nThe first London production debuted at the [[Saville Theatre]] on [[Shaftesbury Avenue]] on 30 April 1959 (after playing for a short time at the [[New Theatre Oxford]] and the [[Manchester Opera House]]). This production used Lillian Hellman's book with an additional credit 'assisted by Michael Stewart', and it was directed by [[Robert Lewis (director)|Robert Lewis]] with choreography by [[Jack Cole (choreographer)|Jack Cole]]. The cast included [[Denis Quilley]] as Candide, [[Mary Costa]] as Cunegonde, [[Laurence Naismith]] as Dr. Pangloss and [[Edith Coates]] as the Old Lady. The Musical Director was Alexander Faris. It ran for 60 performances.{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Later productions===\n{{Refimprove section|date=February 2010}}\nWithout Bernstein's involvement, the show underwent a series of Broadway revivals under the direction of [[Harold Prince]]. [[Lillian Hellman]], the author of the original book, refused to let any of her work be used in the revival, so Prince commissioned a new, one-act book from [[Hugh Wheeler]]. The sole element of Hellman's book that remained was her invented name (Maximilian) for Cunegonde's brother. (The character has no given name in Voltaire's novella, and is referred to as \"Cundegonde's brother\" or \"the young Baron\".)\n\nThe lyrics were worked on by the team of artists listed above. This 105-minute version, omitting over half of the musical numbers, was known as the \"Chelsea version\", and opened in 1973 at [[Robert Kalfin]]'s [[Chelsea Theater Center]] in the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]], before moving to the [[Broadway Theatre (53rd Street)|Broadway Theatre]] in 1974 and running there for nearly two years, closing in 1976 after 740 performances. The 1974 Broadway revival starred [[Mark Baker (actor)|Mark Baker]] (Candide), Maureen Brennan (Cunegonde), [[Sam Freed]] (Maximilian), [[Lewis J. Stadlen]] (Dr. Pangloss), and [[June Gable]] as the Old Lady.<ref>{{IBDB title|3708|Candide{{noitalic| (1974)}}}}</ref>\n\nThe Chelsea version was marked by a unique production style. [[Eugene Lee (designer)|Eugene Lee]] helped Prince make sure that the multi-scene show would not get bogged down in set changes \u2013 he created platforms for the action that allowed scenes to change by refocusing attention instead of changing scenery. Actors performed on platforms in front, behind, and sometimes between audience members. Some sat on bleachers, others on stools on the stage floor. As the story unfolded, so did the stage, with sections falling from above, opening, closing, flying apart or coming together. A 13-member orchestra played from four areas. The conductor, who wore period costume and gold braid, could be seen by audience and musicians alike on television monitors.<ref>Napoleon, Davi. ''[[Chelsea on the Edge: The Adventures of an American Theater]]''</ref>\n\nIn response to requests from opera companies for a more legitimate version, the show was expanded on the basis of Wheeler's book. The two-act \"opera house version\" contains most of Bernstein's music, including some songs that were not orchestrated for the original production. It was first performed by the [[New York City Opera]] in 1982 under Prince's direction, and ran for thirty-four performances. Opera companies around the world have performed this version, and the production was a staple of New York City Opera's repertoire.\n\nThe Australian premiere in 1982 by the [[Nimrod Theatre Company]] and directed by [[John Bell (Australian actor)|John Bell]] at Sydney's [[Seymour Centre]] featured [[Philip Quast]] in the title role.<ref>[http://www.empirenet.com/~wildcard/quast/candide.htm ''Candide'' \u2013 Sydney's Nimrod Theatre Company, York Theatre 1982 Australia], details, reviews</ref>\n\nIn 1988, by which point Hellman had died, Bernstein started working alongside [[John Mauceri]], then director of [[Scottish Opera]], to produce a version that expressed his final wishes regarding ''Candide''. Wheeler died before he could work again on the text, and [[John Wells (satirist)|John Wells]] was engaged.  The new show was first produced by [[Scottish Opera]] with the credit \"Adapted for Scottish Opera by John Wells and John Mauceri\".  After Bernstein had attended the final rehearsals and the opening in Glasgow, he decided that the time had come for the composer himself to re-examine ''Candide''. Taking the Scottish Opera version as a basis, he made changes in orchestration, shuffled the order of numbers in the second act, and altered the endings of several numbers.  Bernstein then conducted and recorded what he called his \"final revised version\" with [[Jerry Hadley]] as Candide, [[June Anderson]] as Cunegonde, [[Christa Ludwig]] as the Old Lady, [[Kurt Ollmann]] as Maximilian and [[Adolph Green]] as Dr. Pangloss/Martin.  Deutsche Grammophon released a DVD (2006, 147 min.), in 5.0 [[surround sound]], of the 13 December 1989 recording at the London [[Barbican Centre]], with a bonus video prologue and epilogue from the composer and a printed insert \"Bernstein and Voltaire\" by narrative collaborator [[John Wells (satirist)|Wells]] explaining what Bernstein wanted in this final revised version. A CD version, without Bernstein's commentary or audience applause, was also released by [[Deutsche Grammophon]].\n\nIt was produced by [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]], performed in the [[Civic Opera House (Chicago)|Civic Opera House]], with direction by Harold Prince, opening November 26, 1994. Book adapted from Voltaire by Hugh Wheeler, lyrics by Richard Wilbur, with additional lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and John Latouche. This revised opera house version formed the basis for the 1997 Broadway Revival.<ref>http://www.sondheimguide.com/Candide/94chicago.html retrieved August 27,2017</ref>\n\n''Candide'' was revived on Broadway in 1997, directed again by Harold Prince in a revised version of his 1982 New York City Opera staging. The cast included: [[Jason Danieley]] (Candide), [[Harolyn Blackwell]] (Cunegonde), [[Jim Dale]] (Dr. Pangloss), [[Andrea Martin]] (Old Lady), and [[Brent Barrett]] (Maximilian).\n\nWhen the [[Royal National Theatre]] in the UK (1999) decided to produce ''Candide'', another revision was deemed necessary, and Wheeler's book was rewritten by [[John Caird (director)|John Caird]]. This book stuck far closer to Voltaire's original text than any previous version. The songs remained largely as Bernstein intended, bar a few more tweaks from Sondheim and Wilbur. This, the \"RNT version\", has subsequently been performed a number of times.\n\n[[Lonny Price]] directed a 2004 semi-staged concert production with the [[New York Philharmonic]] under conductor [[Marin Alsop]]. It ran for four performances, May 5\u20138, 2004. This production was also broadcast on [[PBS]]'s ''[[Great Performances]]''. The first-night performance was recorded and released as a DVD in 2005. The cast featured [[Paul Groves (tenor)|Paul Groves]] as Candide, [[Kristin Chenoweth]] as Cunegonde, Sir [[Thomas Allen (baritone)|Thomas Allen]] as Dr. Pangloss, [[Patti LuPone]] as the Old Lady, [[Jeff Blumenkrantz]] as Maximillian, and [[Stanford Olsen]] as the Governor/Vanderdendur/Ragotski with choruses from both [[Westminster Choir College]] and the [[Juilliard School]] completing the cast. This production included two rarely sung duets between Cunegonde and the Old Lady, \"We Are Women\" and \"Quiet\", which were included in the more extensive Bernstein's 1989 final revised version.\n\nIn 2005 the first Polish production premiered at the [[Grand Theatre, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a|Grand Theatre]] at [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] (conducted by Tadeusz Koz\u0142owski, directed by [[Tomasz Konina]]).\n\nIn 2006, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the creation of ''Candide'', the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet]] in Paris produced a new production under the direction of [[Robert Carsen]].\n\nThe [[Goodman Theatre]] in Chicago in a co-production with The [[Shakespeare Theatre Company]] in Washington DC mounted a revised version adapted and directed by [[Mary Zimmerman]] featuring [[Hollis Resnik]] (2010), Lauren Molina (Cunegonde), Geoff Packard (Candide) and Larry Yando (Pangloss). The production, staged in a vast wooden box, with Candide's travels being portrayed through the use of maps and model ships, featured significant amounts of narration adapted directly from Voltaire's novel. <ref>Jones, Kenneth.

Dr. Pangloss, Candide's teacher, expounds his famous philosophy, to the effect that all is for the best (\"The Best of All Possible Worlds\")  The happy couple sing their marriage duet (\"Oh, Happy We\"), and the ceremony is about to take place (\"Wedding Chorale\") when war breaks out between Westphalia and [[Hesse]].  Westphalia is destroyed, and Cunegonde is seemingly killed.  Candide takes comfort in the Panglossian doctrine (\"It Must Be So\") and sets out on his journeys.\n\nIn the public square of [[Lisbon]] (\"Lisbon Fair\"), the Infant Casmira, a deranged mystic in the caravan of an Arab conjuror, predicts dire happenings (\"The Prediction\"), leaving the public in terror (\"Pray For Us\"). Candide discovers Pangloss, who has contracted [[syphilis]], yet remains optimistic (\"Dear Boy\"*). The [[Inquisition]] appears, in the persons of two ancient Inquisitors and their lawyer, and many citizens are tried and sentenced to hang, including Candide and Dr. Pangloss (\"The Inquisition: Auto-da-F\u00e9\"*).  Suddenly an [[earthquake]] occurs, killing Dr. Pangloss, and Candide barely escapes.\n\nCandide, faced with the loss of both Cunegonde and Dr. Pangloss, starts out for [[Paris]].  He is unable to reconcile Dr. Pangloss's ideas with the bitter events that have occurred, but concludes that the fault must lie within himself, rather than in the philosophy of [[optimism]] (\"It Must Be Me\").\n\nCunegonde turns up alive in Paris (\"The Paris Waltz\"), a demi-mondaine in a house shared by a Marquis and a [[Sultan]].  A party is in progress.  Urged by the Old Lady, who serves as her [[Chaperone (social)|duenna]], Cunegonde arrays herself in her jewels (\"Glitter and Be Gay\").  Candide stumbles into the scene and is amazed to find Cunegonde still alive (\"You Were Dead, You Know\"). In a duel, he kills both the Marquis and the Sultan, and flees with Cunegonde, accompanied by the Old Lady.\n\nThey fall in with a band of devout [[Pilgrim|Pilgrims]] on their way to the New World and sail with them (\"Pilgrims' Procession\" / \"Alleluia\").  Arriving in Buenos Aires, the group is brought to the Governor's Palace (where Maximilian is alive and working for the Governor), where all except Cunegonde and the Old Lady are immediately enslaved.  A street cleaner appears in the person of the pessimistic Martin, warning Candide of the future. Candide and Maximilian are joyfully reunited, but when Candide states his intention to marry Cunegonde Maximilian starts to strike him with a glove. Candide starts to strike him back, but before he actually does Maximilian drops, apparently dead.  The Governor serenades Cunegonde (\"My Love\") and she, abetted by the Old Lady, agrees to live in the palace (\"I Am Easily Assimilated\"). The Old Lady urges Candide to flee, but Candide, fired by reports of [[El Dorado|Eldorado]] from Martin, sets off to seek his fortune, planning to return for Cunegonde later (\"Quartet Finale\").\n\n'''Act 2'''\n\nIn the heat of Buenos Aires, Cunegonde, the Old Lady and the Governor display their fraying nerves  (\"Quiet\"), and the Governor resolves to get rid of the tiresome ladies.  Candide returns from Eldorado (\"Eldorado\"), his pockets full of [[gold]] and searches for Cunegonde.  The Governor, however, has had both Cunegonde and the Old Lady tied up in sacks and carried to a boat in the harbor.  He tells Candide that the women have sailed for Europe, and Candide eagerly purchases a leaky ship from the Governor and dashes off.  As the Governor and his suite watch from his terrace, the ship with Candide and Martin casts off and almost immediately sinks (\"Bon Voyage\").\n\nCandide and Martin have been rescued from the ship, and are floating about the ocean on a raft.  Martin is devoured by a [[shark]], but Dr. Pangloss miraculously reappears.  Candide is overjoyed to find his old teacher, and Pangloss sets about repairing the damage done to his philosophy by Candide's experiences.\n\nIn a luxurious palazzo of [[Venice]] (\"Money, Money, Money\"), Cunegonde turns up as a scrubwoman and the Old Lady as a woman of fashion (Madame Sofronia) (\"What's the Use?\"), both working as [[shill]]s for Ferone, the owner of a gambling hall.  Candide and Dr. Pangloss, both wearing masks, appear and are caught up by the merriment, the wine and the gambling. Candide is accosted by a masked Cunegonde and Old Lady, who try to steal his remaining gold (\"The Venice Gavotte\"), but recognizes Cunegonde when her mask falls off. His last hopes and dreams shattered, he drops his money at her feet and leaves.  Cunegonde and the Old Lady are fired by Ferone and Pangloss is now penniless, having been completely swindled out of all his money.\n\nWith Candide now completely disillusioned, he and Pangloss return to the ruined Westphalia.  Cunegonde, Maximilian (minus his teeth) and the Old Lady appear and within them a spark of optimism still flickers.  Candide, however, has had enough of the foolish Panglossian ideal and tells them all that the only way to live is to try to make some sense of life (\"Make Our Garden Grow\").\n\n===Bernstein \"Final Revised Version\" (1989)===\n\n'''Act 1'''\n\nThe operetta begins with an overture. The chorus welcomes everyone to Westphalia (\"Westphalia Chorale\") and Voltaire begins to narrate his story. Candide, the illegitimate nephew of Baron Thunder-ten-Tronck, lives in the Baron's castle Schloss Thunder-ten-Tronck. He is snubbed by the Baroness and bullied by her son Maximilian. Paquette, a very accommodating serving girl, also lives in the castle. However, Candide is in love with Cunegonde, the Baroness' daughter as Maximilian, Candide, Cunegonde and Paquette find their happiness in life (\"Life is Happiness Indeed\"). The four discover that Dr. Pangloss, a man thought to be the world's greatest philosopher, has taught them happiness (\"The Best of All Possible Worlds\"). The philosopher asks his four students to summarize what they have learned (\"Universal Good\"). When Cunegonde spies Dr. Pangloss being physically intimate with Paquette, he explains it away as being a \"physical experiment\", and she decides to share the \"experiment\" with Candide. Professing their love to each other at a park, Candide and Cunegonde dream of what married life would look like (\"Oh, Happy We\"). The Baron, however, is angered at what Candide has done to Cunegonde, as he is a social inferior. Candide is promptly exiled, wandering alone with his faith and optimism to cling to (\"It Must Be So\"). He is then shanghaied by and into the Bulgar Army, which plots to \"liberate\" all of Westphalia. His escape attempt fails, and is recaptured by the Army. The Bulgar Army attacks Schloss Thunder-ten-Tronck and in the castle the Baron's family prays as the chorus joins in (\"Westphalia\"). However, the Baron, the Baroness, Maximilian, Paquette, Pangloss and (after being repeatedly ravished by the Bulgar Army) Cunegonde are all killed in the attack (\"Battle Music\"). Candide returns to the castle's ruins and searches for Cunegonde (\"Candide's Lament\").\n\nSome time later, Candide becomes a beggar. He gives the last of his coins to Pangloss, who reveals that he was revived by an anatomist's [[scalpel]]. He then tells Candide of his [[syphilis]] condition brought on by Paquette (\"Dear Boy\"). A merchant offers the two employment before sailing off to [[Lisbon]], Portugal. However, as they arrive, a [[volcano]] erupts and the ensuing earthquake results in the death of 30,000 people. Pangloss and Candide are blamed for the disaster, arrested as heretics and publicly tortured by order of the Grand Inquisitor. Pangloss is [[Hanging|hanged]] and Candide is [[Flagellation|flogged]] (\"Auto-da-F\u00e9\"). Candide eventually ends up in [[Paris]], France, where Cunegonde shares her favors (on different mutually-agreed-upon days of the week) with wealthy Jew Don Issachar and the city's Cardinal Archbishop (\"The Paris Waltz\"). She contemplates what she has done to survive while in Paris (\"Glitter and Be Gay\"). Candide finds Cunegonde and reunites with her (\"You Were Dead, You Know\"). However, the Old Lady, Cunegonde's companion, forewarns Cunegonde and Candide of Issachar and the Archbishop's arrival. Candide inadvertently kills both of them by stabbing them with a sword.\n\nThe three flee to [[Cadiz]], Spain with Cunegonde's jewels, where the Old Lady tells Candide and Cunegonde about her past. The jewels are stolen and the Old Lady offers to sing for their dinner (\"I Am Easily Assimilated\"). The French police arrive, intending to arrest Candide for murdering Don Issachar and the Archbishop. Accepting an offer to fight for the Jesuits in South America, Candide decides to take Cunegonde and the Old Lady to the New World, and the three begin their journey on a ship (\"Quartet Finale\").\n\n'''Act 2'''\n\nIn [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, Maximilian and Paquette, now revived and disguised as slave girls, reunite. Soon after, Don Fernando d'Ibaraa y Figueroa y Mascarenes y Lampourdos y Souza, the governor of the city, falls in love with Maximilian, but quickly realizes his mistake and sells him to a priest. Meanwhile, Candide, Cunegonde and the Old Lady also arrive in [[Montevideo]], where the Governor falls in love with Cunegonde (\"My Love\"). The Old Lady convinces Cunegonde that her marriage to the governor will support her financially (\"We Are Women\"). Candide soon befriends Cacambo and accepts him as his valet. Convinced by the Old Lady that the police are still after Candide for the Archbishop's murder, Candide and Cacambo flee Montevideo and eventually stumble upon a Jesuit camp and are joined by the Father and Mother Superiors (\"The Pilgrims' Procession \u2013 Alleluia\"). Candide soon discovers that the Mother Superior is actually Paquette and the Father Superior is Maximilian. When Candide tells Maximilian that he will marry Cunegonde, however, Maximilian angrily challenges him to a fight. However, Maximilian is once again inadvertently stabbed to death by Candide. Candide is forced to flee into the jungle as a result.\n\nThree years later, Cunegonde and the Old Lady discuss the miseries shared by the upper classes while the Governor doesn't want to hear their complaints (\"Quiet\"). Meanwhile, Candide and Cacambo are starving and lost in the [[Jungle|jungles]]. Finding a boat in the ocean, they float downriver into a cavern for 24 hours until they finally reach [[El Dorado|Eldorado]], the city of gold (\"Introduction to Eldorado\"). The two discover that the locals worship one god as opposed to three, palaces of science, [[Rose water|rosewater]] and stones with [[cinnamon]] and [[clove]] scents. Dissatisfied without Cunegonde, Candide decides to leave.  The locals think him foolish, but offer to help, giving him some of the town's golden sheep and constructing a lift that will guide him, Cacambo and the sheep over the mountain (\"The Ballad of Eldorado\"). One by one, the sheep die until only two remain. Unwilling to go back to Montevideo, Candide gives Cacambo one of the golden sheep to ransom Cunegonde, telling them that they will meet again in [[Venice]], Italy.\n\nArriving at [[Suriname]], Candide meets Martin, a local pessimist. He shows him a slave with one hand and one foot lost while harvesting [[sugar]]-cane, which is the result of Europeans eating sugar; Candide is unable to convince Martin otherwise (\"Words, Words, Words\"). Vanderdendur, a Dutch villain, offers his ship, the Santa Rosalia, in exchange for the golden sheep. Candide is excited when he is told that the ''Santa Rosalia'' is to depart for Venice. The locals and Vandendur wish Candide a safe journey to Venice (\"Bon Voyage\"). However, the ship sinks and Martin drowns as a result. After reuniting with his golden sheep, Candide is picked up by a [[galley]], meeting five deposed kings. The galley is rowed by slaves, including Pangloss, revived once again. The kings say that they will live humbly, serving both god and men, and Pangloss leads their debate (\"The Kings' Barcarolle\").\n\nThe ship arrives in Venice, where the Carnival festival is taking place (\"Money, Money, Money\"). While the kings play roulette and baccarat, Candide searches for Cunegonde. Maximilian, revived once again, is now the corrupt Prefect of Police and the town's leader. Paquette is now the town's reigning prostitute. Cunegonde and the Old Lady are employed to encourage the gamblers (\"What's the Use?\"). Pangloss celebrates a victory after winning roulette and spends his money on the other ladies (\"The Venice Gavotte\"). Candide, however, masked for the Carnival, is accosted by Cunegonde and the Old Lady (both of whom are also masked), who try to swindle him out of his money. During the exchange, all the masks come off and they are horrified to recognize each other.  Seeing what Cunegonde has become, Candide's image of and belief in her is shattered (\"Nothing More Than This\"). Candide does not speak for several days; with what little money they have left, they purchase a small farm outside Venice and the chorus says that life is just life and paradise is nothing (\"Universal Good\"). Candide finally speaks and resolves to marry Cunegonde (\"Make Our Garden Grow\").\n\n==Music==\nThough the show as a whole received mixed reviews at its opening, the music was immediately a hit.

If sung as written throughout (alternative phrases are provided at several points in the score), there are three high E-flats (above [[C (musical note)|high C]]), two [[staccato]] and one sustained; there are also numerous uses of high C and D-flat. Some of the florid passages are very intricate. Theatrically, it demands an elaborate comic staging, in which Cunegonde adorns herself with jewelry while singing and dancing around the stage, and has a satirical quality that is a challenge to perform.\n\nSubsequent performers of the role of Cunegonde have included:\n* [[Mary Costa]] (in the 1959 London premiere)\n* [[Madeline Kahn]] (in a 1968 concert version)\n* Maureen Brennan (In [[Hal Prince]]'s first Broadway revival of the show in 1974)\n* [[Erie Mills]] (at the [[New York City Opera]] in 1982)\n* [[June Anderson]] (under Bernstein's direction in concerts and a 1989 recording shortly before his death)\n* [[Constance Hauman]] (understudy to Anderson, filled in for at least one performance)\n* [[Elizabeth Futral]] (at [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]] in 1994)\n* [[Michael Callen]] (in his 1996 posthumously released LEGACY 2-CD album)\n* [[Harolyn Blackwell]] (in Hal Prince's 1997 Broadway revival of the show).\n* [[Kristin Chenoweth]] (in a 2004 concert production with the [[New York Philharmonic]]; recorded with many other orchestras including the [[Boston Pops Orchestra|Boston Pops]])\n* [[Lauren Molina]] (in [[Mary Zimmerman]]'s 2010 production at the [[Goodman Theatre]])\n* [[Jessica Pratt (soprano)|Jessica Pratt]] (at [[Teatro dell'Opera di Roma]] in 2012)\n* [[Scarlett Strallen]] (in the 2013 [[Menier Chocolate Factory]] production)\n\nThis aria has been performed in concert by many musical theatre and opera stars, including (in addition to those listed above): [[Natalie Dessay]], [[Diana Damrau]], [[Sumi Jo]], [[Edita Gruberov\u00e1]], [[Ren\u00e9e Fleming]], [[Simone Kermes]], [[Roberta Peters]], Lenneke Ruiten, and [[Dawn Upshaw]].<!--please keep alphabetical order of listing-->\n\n===Overture===\nThe [[overture]] to ''Candide'' soon earned a place in the orchestral repertoire. After a successful first concert performance on January 26, 1957, by the [[New York Philharmonic]] under the composer's baton, it quickly became popular and was performed by nearly 100 other orchestras within the next two years.<ref>[http://nyphil.org/programNotes/Bernstein%20Overture%20to%20Candide.pdf New York Philharmonic: Program Notes for ''Overture to Candide'']{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Since that time, it has become one of the most frequently performed orchestral compositions by a [[20th-century classical music|20th century]] [[Music of the United States|American]] composer; in 1987, it was the most often performed piece of concert music by Bernstein.<ref name=Peyser />\n\nThe overture incorporates tunes from the songs \"The Best of All Possible Worlds\", \"Battle Music\", \"Oh, Happy We\", and \"Glitter and Be Gay\" and melodies composed specifically for the overture. \n\nWhile many [[orchestration]]s of the overture exist, in its current incarnation for full symphony orchestra, which incorporates changes made by Bernstein during performances in December 1989, the piece requires a standard-sized contemporary orchestra of [[piccolo]], two [[flute]]s, two [[oboe]]s, an E-flat and two B-flat [[clarinet]]s, [[bass clarinet]], two [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], four [[French horn|horns]], two [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], a large but standard [[percussion instrument|percussion]] contingent, [[harp]], and a standard [[Bowed string instrument|string]] section.<ref>MacDonald, Malcolm. Preface to the score of the Overture to ''Candide''. ''Bernstein: Orchestral Anthology'', volume 2. Boosey & Hawkes, 1998. {{ISBN|0-85162-218-6}}; ISMN M060107627</ref> It is approximately four and a half minutes long. The theatre-sized orchestration, as in the published full score of the operetta, includes one flute doubling on piccolo, one oboe, two clarinets rotating between an E-flat, B-flat, and bass, one bassoon, two horns, two trumpets, two trombones, one tuba, standard orchestral percussion, harp, and strings. Main differences between the two are doublings and increased use of percussion effects (especially the addition of a drum roll during the opening fanfares) in the symphony orchestral arrangement. Differences between the first publication and later printings (of both orchestrations) include a slowed opening tempo (half note equal 132 instead of 152). An arrangement for standard [[wind ensemble]] also exists, composed by Clare Grundman in 1991, published under Boosey and Hawkes.  Peter Richard Conte has also transcribed it for the [[Wanamaker Organ]].\n\n[[Dick Cavett]] used the \"Glitter and Be Gay\" portion of the overture at the midpoint of his [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] late-night TV show ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]''. The song also served as his signature introduction during the years the Cavett show aired on [[PBS]].\n\nAt a memorial concert for Bernstein in 1990, the [[New York Philharmonic]] paid tribute to their Laureate Conductor by performing the overture without a conductor. This practice has become a performance tradition still maintained by the Philharmonic.<ref>[http://www.wnyc.org/articles/music/2004/may/03/bernsteins-emcandideem/ Bernstein's Candide: WNYC Program Notes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002050018/http://www.wnyc.org/articles/music/2004/may/03/bernsteins-emcandideem/ |date=2012-10-02 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[New York Philharmonic]] performed the Overture to Candide as part of its [[2008 New York Philharmonic visit to North Korea|historic concert]] in [[Pyongyang]], [[North Korea]], on February 26, 2008.\n\n==Musical numbers==\n\n===Original production (1956)===\nAll music by Bernstein, and lyrics by Richard Wilbur unless noted otherwise\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\nAct 1\n*Overture \u2013 Orchestra\n\nScene 1: Westphalia\n*Opening: The Best of All Possible Worlds \u2013 Dr. Pangloss, Chorus, Cunegonde, Candide\n*Duet: Oh, Happy We \u2013 Candide and Cunegonde \n*Chorus: Wedding Chorale \u2013 Chorus\n\nScene 1A: Candide Travels to Lisbon\n*Meditation: It Must Be So \u2013 Candide\n\nScene 2: Lisbon\n*Ensemble: Lisbon Sequence: Lisbon Fair / The Prediction / Dear Boy / The Inquisition: Auto-da-F\u00e9* \u2013 Infant Casmira, Conjuror, Pangloss, The Inquisitors, and Chorus (Lyrics by Bernstein)\n*Ensemble: Lisbon Sequence: Lisbon Fair / The Prediction / Pray For Us \u2013 Infant Casmira, Conjuror, and Chorus (Lyrics by Bernstein)\n\nScene 2A: Candide Travels to Paris\n*Meditation: It Must Be Me \u2013 Candide\n\nScene 3: Paris\n*Mazurka: The Paris Waltz \u2013 Orchestra\n*Aria: Glitter and Be Gay \u2013 Cunegonde\n*Duet: You Were Dead, You Know \u2013 Candide and Cunegonde (Lyrics by John Latouche and Wilbur)\n\nScene 3A: They Travel to Buenos Aires\n*Ensemble: Pilgrims' Procession \u2013 Pilgrim Mother, Pilgrim Father, Cunegonde, Old Lady, Candide, Chorus\n*Chorus: Alleluia \u2013 Pilgrims\n\nScene 4: Buenos Aires\n*Serenade: My Love \u2013 Governor of Buenos Aires, Cunegonde, Old Lady (Lyrics by Latouche and Wilbur) \n*Tango: I Am Easily Assimilated \u2013 Old Lady, Chorus, Cunegonde (Lyrics by Bernstein)\n*Quartet: Finale Act I \u2013 Candide, Cunegonde, Governor of Buenos Aires, Old Lady\n{{col-break}}\n\nAct 2\n\nEntr'acte \u2013 Orchestra\n\nScene 1: Buenos Aires\n*Trio: Quiet \u2013 Old Lady, Governor of Buenos Aires, Cunegonde\n*Ballad: Eldorado \u2013 Candide, Chorus (Lyrics by Lillian Hellman)\n*Schottische: Bon Voyage \u2013 Chorus, Governor of Buenos Aires\n\nScene 2: Venice\n*Ensemble: Money, Money, Money (Venice Gambling Scene) \u2013 Croupier and Gamblers\n*Waltz: What's the Use? \u2013 Madame Sofronia, Ferone, Prefect of Police, Prince Ivan, Chorus\n*Gavotte: The Venice Gavotte \u2013 Madame Sofronia, Candide, Dr. Pangloss, Cunegonde (Lyrics by Dorothy Parker)\n\nScene 3: Westphalia\n*Finale: Make Our Garden Grow \u2013 Candide, Cunegonde, Company\n{{col-end}}\n\n:* This version of the \"Lisbon Sequence\" was rewritten after the Boston try-out; it introduced the songs \"Auto-da-F\u00e9\" and \"Dear Boy\", reinstated in most revivals.\n:* The 1973 revival had a couple of songs added (music by Bernstein and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim unless otherwise noted); \"Life Is Happiness Indeed\", \"Auto Da Fe\u2014What a Day\" (lyrics by Sondheim and Latouche), \"This World\", \"The Sheep's Song\", and \"O Misere\".<ref>[http://www.sondheim.com/works/candide/ ''Candide''], sondheim.com</ref>\n\n===1989 production===\nBernstein's \"final revised version\", recorded in 1989:<ref name=\"Hutchins\"/><ref>Hutchins.

Other contributors to the text were [[John La Touche (lyricist)|John Latouche]], [[Dorothy Parker]], [[Lillian Hellman]], [[Stephen Sondheim]], [[John Mauceri]], [[John Wells (satirist)|John Wells]], and Bernstein himself. [[Maurice Peress]] and [[Hershy Kay]] contributed orchestrations. Although unsuccessful at its premiere, ''Candide'' has now overcome the unenthusiastic reaction of early audiences and critics and achieved enormous popularity. It is very popular among major music schools as a student show because of the quality of its music and the opportunities it offers to student singers.{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\n==Origins==\n''Candide'' was originally conceived by [[Lillian Hellman]] as a play with incidental music in the style of her previous work, ''[[The Lark (play)|The Lark]]''. Bernstein, however, was so excited about this idea that he convinced Hellman to do it as a \"comic operetta\"; she then wrote the original libretto for the operetta. Many lyricists worked on the show: first [[James Agee]] (whose work was ultimately not used), then [[Dorothy Parker]], [[John La Touche (lyricist)|John Latouche]] and [[Richard Wilbur]]. In addition, the lyrics to \"I Am Easily Assimilated\" were done by Leonard and [[Felicia Bernstein]], and Hellman wrote the words to \"Eldorado\". [[Hershy Kay]] orchestrated all but the [[overture]], which Bernstein did himself.<ref name=Peyser>{{cite book | last=Peyser | first=Joan | authorlink=Joan Peyser | title=Bernstein, a biography | location=New York | publisher=Beech Tree Books | year=1987 | isbn=0-688-04918-4 | page=[https://archive.org/details/bernsteinbiograp00peys/page/248 248] | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/bernsteinbiograp00peys }}</ref>\n\n==Performance history==\n\n===1956 original Broadway production===\n''Candide'' first opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] as a [[musical theatre|musical]] on December 1, 1956 at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]]. The premiere production was directed by [[Tyrone Guthrie]] and conducted by [[Samuel Krachmalnick]]. The sets and costumes were designed by [[Oliver Smith (designer)|Oliver Smith]] and [[Irene Sharaff]], respectively.<ref name=Peyser/> It was choreographed by [[Anna Sokolow]]. It featured [[Robert Rounseville]] as Candide, [[Barbara Cook]] as Cunegonde, [[Max Adrian]] as Dr. Pangloss, and [[Irra Petina]] as the Old Lady. This production was a box office disaster, running only two months for a total of 73 performances. Hellman's libretto was criticized in a ''[[New York Times]]'' review as being too serious:<ref name=Peyser />\n{{quote|When Voltaire is ironic and bland, [Hellman] is explicit and vigorous. When he makes lightning, rapier thrusts, she provides body blows. Where he is diabolical, [she] is humanitarian ... the libretto ... seems too serious for the verve and mocking lyricism of Leonard Bernstein's score which, without being strictly 18th century, maintains, with its gay pastiche of past styles and forms, a period quality.<ref name=Peyser />}}\n\n===European premieres===\nThe first London production debuted at the [[Saville Theatre]] on [[Shaftesbury Avenue]] on 30 April 1959 (after playing for a short time at the [[New Theatre Oxford]] and the [[Manchester Opera House]]). This production used Lillian Hellman's book with an additional credit 'assisted by Michael Stewart', and it was directed by [[Robert Lewis (director)|Robert Lewis]] with choreography by [[Jack Cole (choreographer)|Jack Cole]]. The cast included [[Denis Quilley]] as Candide, [[Mary Costa]] as Cunegonde, [[Laurence Naismith]] as Dr. Pangloss and [[Edith Coates]] as the Old Lady. The Musical Director was Alexander Faris. It ran for 60 performances.{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Later productions===\n{{Refimprove section|date=February 2010}}\nWithout Bernstein's involvement, the show underwent a series of Broadway revivals under the direction of [[Harold Prince]]. [[Lillian Hellman]], the author of the original book, refused to let any of her work be used in the revival, so Prince commissioned a new, one-act book from [[Hugh Wheeler]]. The sole element of Hellman's book that remained was her invented name (Maximilian) for Cunegonde's brother. (The character has no given name in Voltaire's novella, and is referred to as \"Cundegonde's brother\" or \"the young Baron\".)\n\nThe lyrics were worked on by the team of artists listed above. This 105-minute version, omitting over half of the musical numbers, was known as the \"Chelsea version\", and opened in 1973 at [[Robert Kalfin]]'s [[Chelsea Theater Center]] in the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]], before moving to the [[Broadway Theatre (53rd Street)|Broadway Theatre]] in 1974 and running there for nearly two years, closing in 1976 after 740 performances. The 1974 Broadway revival starred [[Mark Baker (actor)|Mark Baker]] (Candide), Maureen Brennan (Cunegonde), [[Sam Freed]] (Maximilian), [[Lewis J. Stadlen]] (Dr. Pangloss), and [[June Gable]] as the Old Lady.<ref>{{IBDB title|3708|Candide{{noitalic| (1974)}}}}</ref>\n\nThe Chelsea version was marked by a unique production style. [[Eugene Lee (designer)|Eugene Lee]] helped Prince make sure that the multi-scene show would not get bogged down in set changes \u2013 he created platforms for the action that allowed scenes to change by refocusing attention instead of changing scenery. Actors performed on platforms in front, behind, and sometimes between audience members. Some sat on bleachers, others on stools on the stage floor. As the story unfolded, so did the stage, with sections falling from above, opening, closing, flying apart or coming together. A 13-member orchestra played from four areas. The conductor, who wore period costume and gold braid, could be seen by audience and musicians alike on television monitors.<ref>Napoleon, Davi. ''[[Chelsea on the Edge: The Adventures of an American Theater]]''</ref>\n\nIn response to requests from opera companies for a more legitimate version, the show was expanded on the basis of Wheeler's book. The two-act \"opera house version\" contains most of Bernstein's music, including some songs that were not orchestrated for the original production. It was first performed by the [[New York City Opera]] in 1982 under Prince's direction, and ran for thirty-four performances. Opera companies around the world have performed this version, and the production was a staple of New York City Opera's repertoire.\n\nThe Australian premiere in 1982 by the [[Nimrod Theatre Company]] and directed by [[John Bell (Australian actor)|John Bell]] at Sydney's [[Seymour Centre]] featured [[Philip Quast]] in the title role.<ref>[http://www.empirenet.com/~wildcard/quast/candide.htm ''Candide'' \u2013 Sydney's Nimrod Theatre Company, York Theatre 1982 Australia], details, reviews</ref>\n\nIn 1988, by which point Hellman had died, Bernstein started working alongside [[John Mauceri]], then director of [[Scottish Opera]], to produce a version that expressed his final wishes regarding ''Candide''. Wheeler died before he could work again on the text, and [[John Wells (satirist)|John Wells]] was engaged.  The new show was first produced by [[Scottish Opera]] with the credit \"Adapted for Scottish Opera by John Wells and John Mauceri\".  After Bernstein had attended the final rehearsals and the opening in Glasgow, he decided that the time had come for the composer himself to re-examine ''Candide''. Taking the Scottish Opera version as a basis, he made changes in orchestration, shuffled the order of numbers in the second act, and altered the endings of several numbers.  Bernstein then conducted and recorded what he called his \"final revised version\" with [[Jerry Hadley]] as Candide, [[June Anderson]] as Cunegonde, [[Christa Ludwig]] as the Old Lady, [[Kurt Ollmann]] as Maximilian and [[Adolph Green]] as Dr. Pangloss/Martin.  Deutsche Grammophon released a DVD (2006, 147 min.), in 5.0 [[surround sound]], of the 13 December 1989 recording at the London [[Barbican Centre]], with a bonus video prologue and epilogue from the composer and a printed insert \"Bernstein and Voltaire\" by narrative collaborator [[John Wells (satirist)|Wells]] explaining what Bernstein wanted in this final revised version. A CD version, without Bernstein's commentary or audience applause, was also released by [[Deutsche Grammophon]].\n\nIt was produced by [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]], performed in the [[Civic Opera House (Chicago)|Civic Opera House]], with direction by Harold Prince, opening November 26, 1994. Book adapted from Voltaire by Hugh Wheeler, lyrics by Richard Wilbur, with additional lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and John Latouche. This revised opera house version formed the basis for the 1997 Broadway Revival.<ref>http://www.sondheimguide.com/Candide/94chicago.html retrieved August 27,2017</ref>\n\n''Candide'' was revived on Broadway in 1997, directed again by Harold Prince in a revised version of his 1982 New York City Opera staging. The cast included: [[Jason Danieley]] (Candide), [[Harolyn Blackwell]] (Cunegonde), [[Jim Dale]] (Dr. Pangloss), [[Andrea Martin]] (Old Lady), and [[Brent Barrett]] (Maximilian).\n\nWhen the [[Royal National Theatre]] in the UK (1999) decided to produce ''Candide'', another revision was deemed necessary, and Wheeler's book was rewritten by [[John Caird (director)|John Caird]]. This book stuck far closer to Voltaire's original text than any previous version. The songs remained largely as Bernstein intended, bar a few more tweaks from Sondheim and Wilbur. This, the \"RNT version\", has subsequently been performed a number of times.\n\n[[Lonny Price]] directed a 2004 semi-staged concert production with the [[New York Philharmonic]] under conductor [[Marin Alsop]]. It ran for four performances, May 5\u20138, 2004. This production was also broadcast on [[PBS]]'s ''[[Great Performances]]''. The first-night performance was recorded and released as a DVD in 2005. The cast featured [[Paul Groves (tenor)|Paul Groves]] as Candide, [[Kristin Chenoweth]] as Cunegonde, Sir [[Thomas Allen (baritone)|Thomas Allen]] as Dr. Pangloss, [[Patti LuPone]] as the Old Lady, [[Jeff Blumenkrantz]] as Maximillian, and [[Stanford Olsen]] as the Governor/Vanderdendur/Ragotski with choruses from both [[Westminster Choir College]] and the [[Juilliard School]] completing the cast. This production included two rarely sung duets between Cunegonde and the Old Lady, \"We Are Women\" and \"Quiet\", which were included in the more extensive Bernstein's 1989 final revised version.\n\nIn 2005 the first Polish production premiered at the [[Grand Theatre, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a|Grand Theatre]] at [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] (conducted by Tadeusz Koz\u0142owski, directed by [[Tomasz Konina]]).\n\nIn 2006, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the creation of ''Candide'', the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet]] in Paris produced a new production under the direction of [[Robert Carsen]].\n\nThe [[Goodman Theatre]] in Chicago in a co-production with The [[Shakespeare Theatre Company]] in Washington DC mounted a revised version adapted and directed by [[Mary Zimmerman]] featuring [[Hollis Resnik]] (2010), Lauren Molina (Cunegonde), Geoff Packard (Candide) and Larry Yando (Pangloss). The production, staged in a vast wooden box, with Candide's travels being portrayed through the use of maps and model ships, featured significant amounts of narration adapted directly from Voltaire's novel. <ref>Jones, Kenneth.

Dr. Pangloss, Candide's teacher, expounds his famous philosophy, to the effect that all is for the best (\"The Best of All Possible Worlds\")  The happy couple sing their marriage duet (\"Oh, Happy We\"), and the ceremony is about to take place (\"Wedding Chorale\") when war breaks out between Westphalia and [[Hesse]].  Westphalia is destroyed, and Cunegonde is seemingly killed.  Candide takes comfort in the Panglossian doctrine (\"It Must Be So\") and sets out on his journeys.\n\nIn the public square of [[Lisbon]] (\"Lisbon Fair\"), the Infant Casmira, a deranged mystic in the caravan of an Arab conjuror, predicts dire happenings (\"The Prediction\"), leaving the public in terror (\"Pray For Us\"). Candide discovers Pangloss, who has contracted [[syphilis]], yet remains optimistic (\"Dear Boy\"*). The [[Inquisition]] appears, in the persons of two ancient Inquisitors and their lawyer, and many citizens are tried and sentenced to hang, including Candide and Dr. Pangloss (\"The Inquisition: Auto-da-F\u00e9\"*).  Suddenly an [[earthquake]] occurs, killing Dr. Pangloss, and Candide barely escapes.\n\nCandide, faced with the loss of both Cunegonde and Dr. Pangloss, starts out for [[Paris]].  He is unable to reconcile Dr. Pangloss's ideas with the bitter events that have occurred, but concludes that the fault must lie within himself, rather than in the philosophy of [[optimism]] (\"It Must Be Me\").\n\nCunegonde turns up alive in Paris (\"The Paris Waltz\"), a demi-mondaine in a house shared by a Marquis and a [[Sultan]].  A party is in progress.  Urged by the Old Lady, who serves as her [[Chaperone (social)|duenna]], Cunegonde arrays herself in her jewels (\"Glitter and Be Gay\").  Candide stumbles into the scene and is amazed to find Cunegonde still alive (\"You Were Dead, You Know\"). In a duel, he kills both the Marquis and the Sultan, and flees with Cunegonde, accompanied by the Old Lady.\n\nThey fall in with a band of devout [[Pilgrim|Pilgrims]] on their way to the New World and sail with them (\"Pilgrims' Procession\" / \"Alleluia\").  Arriving in Buenos Aires, the group is brought to the Governor's Palace (where Maximilian is alive and working for the Governor), where all except Cunegonde and the Old Lady are immediately enslaved.  A street cleaner appears in the person of the pessimistic Martin, warning Candide of the future. Candide and Maximilian are joyfully reunited, but when Candide states his intention to marry Cunegonde Maximilian starts to strike him with a glove. Candide starts to strike him back, but before he actually does Maximilian drops, apparently dead.  The Governor serenades Cunegonde (\"My Love\") and she, abetted by the Old Lady, agrees to live in the palace (\"I Am Easily Assimilated\"). The Old Lady urges Candide to flee, but Candide, fired by reports of [[El Dorado|Eldorado]] from Martin, sets off to seek his fortune, planning to return for Cunegonde later (\"Quartet Finale\").\n\n'''Act 2'''\n\nIn the heat of Buenos Aires, Cunegonde, the Old Lady and the Governor display their fraying nerves  (\"Quiet\"), and the Governor resolves to get rid of the tiresome ladies.  Candide returns from Eldorado (\"Eldorado\"), his pockets full of [[gold]] and searches for Cunegonde.  The Governor, however, has had both Cunegonde and the Old Lady tied up in sacks and carried to a boat in the harbor.  He tells Candide that the women have sailed for Europe, and Candide eagerly purchases a leaky ship from the Governor and dashes off.  As the Governor and his suite watch from his terrace, the ship with Candide and Martin casts off and almost immediately sinks (\"Bon Voyage\").\n\nCandide and Martin have been rescued from the ship, and are floating about the ocean on a raft.  Martin is devoured by a [[shark]], but Dr. Pangloss miraculously reappears.  Candide is overjoyed to find his old teacher, and Pangloss sets about repairing the damage done to his philosophy by Candide's experiences.\n\nIn a luxurious palazzo of [[Venice]] (\"Money, Money, Money\"), Cunegonde turns up as a scrubwoman and the Old Lady as a woman of fashion (Madame Sofronia) (\"What's the Use?\"), both working as [[shill]]s for Ferone, the owner of a gambling hall.  Candide and Dr. Pangloss, both wearing masks, appear and are caught up by the merriment, the wine and the gambling. Candide is accosted by a masked Cunegonde and Old Lady, who try to steal his remaining gold (\"The Venice Gavotte\"), but recognizes Cunegonde when her mask falls off. His last hopes and dreams shattered, he drops his money at her feet and leaves.  Cunegonde and the Old Lady are fired by Ferone and Pangloss is now penniless, having been completely swindled out of all his money.\n\nWith Candide now completely disillusioned, he and Pangloss return to the ruined Westphalia.  Cunegonde, Maximilian (minus his teeth) and the Old Lady appear and within them a spark of optimism still flickers.  Candide, however, has had enough of the foolish Panglossian ideal and tells them all that the only way to live is to try to make some sense of life (\"Make Our Garden Grow\").\n\n===Bernstein \"Final Revised Version\" (1989)===\n\n'''Act 1'''\n\nThe operetta begins with an overture. The chorus welcomes everyone to Westphalia (\"Westphalia Chorale\") and Voltaire begins to narrate his story. Candide, the illegitimate nephew of Baron Thunder-ten-Tronck, lives in the Baron's castle Schloss Thunder-ten-Tronck. He is snubbed by the Baroness and bullied by her son Maximilian. Paquette, a very accommodating serving girl, also lives in the castle. However, Candide is in love with Cunegonde, the Baroness' daughter as Maximilian, Candide, Cunegonde and Paquette find their happiness in life (\"Life is Happiness Indeed\"). The four discover that Dr. Pangloss, a man thought to be the world's greatest philosopher, has taught them happiness (\"The Best of All Possible Worlds\"). The philosopher asks his four students to summarize what they have learned (\"Universal Good\"). When Cunegonde spies Dr. Pangloss being physically intimate with Paquette, he explains it away as being a \"physical experiment\", and she decides to share the \"experiment\" with Candide. Professing their love to each other at a park, Candide and Cunegonde dream of what married life would look like (\"Oh, Happy We\"). The Baron, however, is angered at what Candide has done to Cunegonde, as he is a social inferior. Candide is promptly exiled, wandering alone with his faith and optimism to cling to (\"It Must Be So\"). He is then shanghaied by and into the Bulgar Army, which plots to \"liberate\" all of Westphalia. His escape attempt fails, and is recaptured by the Army. The Bulgar Army attacks Schloss Thunder-ten-Tronck and in the castle the Baron's family prays as the chorus joins in (\"Westphalia\"). However, the Baron, the Baroness, Maximilian, Paquette, Pangloss and (after being repeatedly ravished by the Bulgar Army) Cunegonde are all killed in the attack (\"Battle Music\"). Candide returns to the castle's ruins and searches for Cunegonde (\"Candide's Lament\").\n\nSome time later, Candide becomes a beggar. He gives the last of his coins to Pangloss, who reveals that he was revived by an anatomist's [[scalpel]]. He then tells Candide of his [[syphilis]] condition brought on by Paquette (\"Dear Boy\"). A merchant offers the two employment before sailing off to [[Lisbon]], Portugal. However, as they arrive, a [[volcano]] erupts and the ensuing earthquake results in the death of 30,000 people. Pangloss and Candide are blamed for the disaster, arrested as heretics and publicly tortured by order of the Grand Inquisitor. Pangloss is [[Hanging|hanged]] and Candide is [[Flagellation|flogged]] (\"Auto-da-F\u00e9\"). Candide eventually ends up in [[Paris]], France, where Cunegonde shares her favors (on different mutually-agreed-upon days of the week) with wealthy Jew Don Issachar and the city's Cardinal Archbishop (\"The Paris Waltz\"). She contemplates what she has done to survive while in Paris (\"Glitter and Be Gay\"). Candide finds Cunegonde and reunites with her (\"You Were Dead, You Know\"). However, the Old Lady, Cunegonde's companion, forewarns Cunegonde and Candide of Issachar and the Archbishop's arrival. Candide inadvertently kills both of them by stabbing them with a sword.\n\nThe three flee to [[Cadiz]], Spain with Cunegonde's jewels, where the Old Lady tells Candide and Cunegonde about her past. The jewels are stolen and the Old Lady offers to sing for their dinner (\"I Am Easily Assimilated\"). The French police arrive, intending to arrest Candide for murdering Don Issachar and the Archbishop. Accepting an offer to fight for the Jesuits in South America, Candide decides to take Cunegonde and the Old Lady to the New World, and the three begin their journey on a ship (\"Quartet Finale\").\n\n'''Act 2'''\n\nIn [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, Maximilian and Paquette, now revived and disguised as slave girls, reunite. Soon after, Don Fernando d'Ibaraa y Figueroa y Mascarenes y Lampourdos y Souza, the governor of the city, falls in love with Maximilian, but quickly realizes his mistake and sells him to a priest. Meanwhile, Candide, Cunegonde and the Old Lady also arrive in [[Montevideo]], where the Governor falls in love with Cunegonde (\"My Love\"). The Old Lady convinces Cunegonde that her marriage to the governor will support her financially (\"We Are Women\"). Candide soon befriends Cacambo and accepts him as his valet. Convinced by the Old Lady that the police are still after Candide for the Archbishop's murder, Candide and Cacambo flee Montevideo and eventually stumble upon a Jesuit camp and are joined by the Father and Mother Superiors (\"The Pilgrims' Procession \u2013 Alleluia\"). Candide soon discovers that the Mother Superior is actually Paquette and the Father Superior is Maximilian. When Candide tells Maximilian that he will marry Cunegonde, however, Maximilian angrily challenges him to a fight. However, Maximilian is once again inadvertently stabbed to death by Candide. Candide is forced to flee into the jungle as a result.\n\nThree years later, Cunegonde and the Old Lady discuss the miseries shared by the upper classes while the Governor doesn't want to hear their complaints (\"Quiet\"). Meanwhile, Candide and Cacambo are starving and lost in the [[Jungle|jungles]]. Finding a boat in the ocean, they float downriver into a cavern for 24 hours until they finally reach [[El Dorado|Eldorado]], the city of gold (\"Introduction to Eldorado\"). The two discover that the locals worship one god as opposed to three, palaces of science, [[Rose water|rosewater]] and stones with [[cinnamon]] and [[clove]] scents. Dissatisfied without Cunegonde, Candide decides to leave.  The locals think him foolish, but offer to help, giving him some of the town's golden sheep and constructing a lift that will guide him, Cacambo and the sheep over the mountain (\"The Ballad of Eldorado\"). One by one, the sheep die until only two remain. Unwilling to go back to Montevideo, Candide gives Cacambo one of the golden sheep to ransom Cunegonde, telling them that they will meet again in [[Venice]], Italy.\n\nArriving at [[Suriname]], Candide meets Martin, a local pessimist. He shows him a slave with one hand and one foot lost while harvesting [[sugar]]-cane, which is the result of Europeans eating sugar; Candide is unable to convince Martin otherwise (\"Words, Words, Words\"). Vanderdendur, a Dutch villain, offers his ship, the Santa Rosalia, in exchange for the golden sheep. Candide is excited when he is told that the ''Santa Rosalia'' is to depart for Venice. The locals and Vandendur wish Candide a safe journey to Venice (\"Bon Voyage\"). However, the ship sinks and Martin drowns as a result. After reuniting with his golden sheep, Candide is picked up by a [[galley]], meeting five deposed kings. The galley is rowed by slaves, including Pangloss, revived once again. The kings say that they will live humbly, serving both god and men, and Pangloss leads their debate (\"The Kings' Barcarolle\").\n\nThe ship arrives in Venice, where the Carnival festival is taking place (\"Money, Money, Money\"). While the kings play roulette and baccarat, Candide searches for Cunegonde. Maximilian, revived once again, is now the corrupt Prefect of Police and the town's leader. Paquette is now the town's reigning prostitute. Cunegonde and the Old Lady are employed to encourage the gamblers (\"What's the Use?\"). Pangloss celebrates a victory after winning roulette and spends his money on the other ladies (\"The Venice Gavotte\"). Candide, however, masked for the Carnival, is accosted by Cunegonde and the Old Lady (both of whom are also masked), who try to swindle him out of his money. During the exchange, all the masks come off and they are horrified to recognize each other.  Seeing what Cunegonde has become, Candide's image of and belief in her is shattered (\"Nothing More Than This\"). Candide does not speak for several days; with what little money they have left, they purchase a small farm outside Venice and the chorus says that life is just life and paradise is nothing (\"Universal Good\"). Candide finally speaks and resolves to marry Cunegonde (\"Make Our Garden Grow\").\n\n==Music==\nThough the show as a whole received mixed reviews at its opening, the music was immediately a hit. Much of the score was recorded on an [[original cast album]],<ref>Leonard Bernstein, Lillian Hellman, and Richard Wilbur et al. ''Candide: Original Broadway Cast Recording.'' Columbia Masterworks, 1957.</ref> which was a success and is still in print as of 2009.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Candide-1956-Original-Broadway-Cast/dp/B0000996FW Amazon.com.

[[Barbara Cook]]'s performance of the aria at its introduction impressed audience and critics, bringing her wide recognition.<ref name=\"Grove\">Howard Goldstein: \"Barbara Cook\", ''Grove Music Online'' ed. L. Macy (Accessed December 04, 2008), [http://www.grovemusic.com (subscription access)]</ref>\n\nThis aria poses some difficulties. If sung as written throughout (alternative phrases are provided at several points in the score), there are three high E-flats (above [[C (musical note)|high C]]), two [[staccato]] and one sustained; there are also numerous uses of high C and D-flat. Some of the florid passages are very intricate. Theatrically, it demands an elaborate comic staging, in which Cunegonde adorns herself with jewelry while singing and dancing around the stage, and has a satirical quality that is a challenge to perform.\n\nSubsequent performers of the role of Cunegonde have included:\n* [[Mary Costa]] (in the 1959 London premiere)\n* [[Madeline Kahn]] (in a 1968 concert version)\n* Maureen Brennan (In [[Hal Prince]]'s first Broadway revival of the show in 1974)\n* [[Erie Mills]] (at the [[New York City Opera]] in 1982)\n* [[June Anderson]] (under Bernstein's direction in concerts and a 1989 recording shortly before his death)\n* [[Constance Hauman]] (understudy to Anderson, filled in for at least one performance)\n* [[Elizabeth Futral]] (at [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]] in 1994)\n* [[Michael Callen]] (in his 1996 posthumously released LEGACY 2-CD album)\n* [[Harolyn Blackwell]] (in Hal Prince's 1997 Broadway revival of the show).\n* [[Kristin Chenoweth]] (in a 2004 concert production with the [[New York Philharmonic]]; recorded with many other orchestras including the [[Boston Pops Orchestra|Boston Pops]])\n* [[Lauren Molina]] (in [[Mary Zimmerman]]'s 2010 production at the [[Goodman Theatre]])\n* [[Jessica Pratt (soprano)|Jessica Pratt]] (at [[Teatro dell'Opera di Roma]] in 2012)\n* [[Scarlett Strallen]] (in the 2013 [[Menier Chocolate Factory]] production)\n\nThis aria has been performed in concert by many musical theatre and opera stars, including (in addition to those listed above): [[Natalie Dessay]], [[Diana Damrau]], [[Sumi Jo]], [[Edita Gruberov\u00e1]], [[Ren\u00e9e Fleming]], [[Simone Kermes]], [[Roberta Peters]], and [[Dawn Upshaw]].<!--please keep alphabetical order of listing-->\n\n===Overture===\nThe [[overture]] to ''Candide'' soon earned a place in the orchestral repertoire. After a successful first concert performance on January 26, 1957, by the [[New York Philharmonic]] under the composer's baton, it quickly became popular and was performed by nearly 100 other orchestras within the next two years.<ref>[http://nyphil.org/programNotes/Bernstein%20Overture%20to%20Candide.pdf New York Philharmonic: Program Notes for ''Overture to Candide'']{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Since that time, it has become one of the most frequently performed orchestral compositions by a [[20th-century classical music|20th century]] [[Music of the United States|American]] composer; in 1987, it was the most often performed piece of concert music by Bernstein.<ref name=Peyser />\n\nThe overture incorporates tunes from the songs \"The Best of All Possible Worlds\", \"Battle Music\", \"Oh, Happy We\", and \"Glitter and Be Gay\" and melodies composed specifically for the overture. \n\nWhile many [[orchestration]]s of the overture exist, in its current incarnation for full symphony orchestra, which incorporates changes made by Bernstein during performances in December 1989, the piece requires a standard-sized contemporary orchestra of [[piccolo]], two [[flute]]s, two [[oboe]]s, an E-flat and two B-flat [[clarinet]]s, [[bass clarinet]], two [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], four [[French horn|horns]], two [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], a large but standard [[percussion instrument|percussion]] contingent, [[harp]], and a standard [[Bowed string instrument|string]] section.<ref>MacDonald, Malcolm.

Boosey & Hawkes, 1998. {{ISBN|0-85162-218-6}}; ISMN M060107627</ref> It is approximately four and a half minutes long. The theatre-sized orchestration, as in the published full score of the operetta, includes one flute doubling on piccolo, one oboe, two clarinets rotating between an E-flat, B-flat, and bass, one bassoon, two horns, two trumpets, two trombones, one tuba, standard orchestral percussion, harp, and strings. Main differences between the two are doublings and increased use of percussion effects (especially the addition of a drum roll during the opening fanfares) in the symphony orchestral arrangement. Differences between the first publication and later printings (of both orchestrations) include a slowed opening tempo (half note equal 132 instead of 152). An arrangement for standard [[wind ensemble]] also exists, composed by Clare Grundman in 1991, published under Boosey and Hawkes.  Peter Richard Conte has also transcribed it for the [[Wanamaker Organ]].\n\n[[Dick Cavett]] used the \"Glitter and Be Gay\" portion of the overture at the midpoint of his [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] late-night TV show ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]''. The song also served as his signature introduction during the years the Cavett show aired on [[PBS]].\n\nAt a memorial concert for Bernstein in 1990, the [[New York Philharmonic]] paid tribute to their Laureate Conductor by performing the overture without a conductor. This practice has become a performance tradition still maintained by the Philharmonic.<ref>[http://www.wnyc.org/articles/music/2004/may/03/bernsteins-emcandideem/ Bernstein's Candide: WNYC Program Notes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002050018/http://www.wnyc.org/articles/music/2004/may/03/bernsteins-emcandideem/ |date=2012-10-02 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[New York Philharmonic]] performed the Overture to Candide as part of its [[2008 New York Philharmonic visit to North Korea|historic concert]] in [[Pyongyang]], [[North Korea]], on February 26, 2008.\n\n==Musical numbers==\n\n===Original production (1956)===\nAll music by Bernstein, and lyrics by Richard Wilbur unless noted otherwise\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\nAct 1\n*Overture \u2013 Orchestra\n\nScene 1: Westphalia\n*Opening: The Best of All Possible Worlds \u2013 Dr. Pangloss, Chorus, Cunegonde, Candide\n*Duet: Oh, Happy We \u2013 Candide and Cunegonde \n*Chorus: Wedding Chorale \u2013 Chorus\n\nScene 1A: Candide Travels to Lisbon\n*Meditation: It Must Be So \u2013 Candide\n\nScene 2: Lisbon\n*Ensemble: Lisbon Sequence: Lisbon Fair / The Prediction / Dear Boy / The Inquisition: Auto-da-F\u00e9* \u2013 Infant Casmira, Conjuror, Pangloss, The Inquisitors, and Chorus (Lyrics by Bernstein)\n*Ensemble: Lisbon Sequence: Lisbon Fair / The Prediction / Pray For Us \u2013 Infant Casmira, Conjuror, and Chorus (Lyrics by Bernstein)\n\nScene 2A: Candide Travels to Paris\n*Meditation: It Must Be Me \u2013 Candide\n\nScene 3: Paris\n*Mazurka: The Paris Waltz \u2013 Orchestra\n*Aria: Glitter and Be Gay \u2013 Cunegonde\n*Duet: You Were Dead, You Know \u2013 Candide and Cunegonde (Lyrics by John Latouche and Wilbur)\n\nScene 3A: They Travel to Buenos Aires\n*Ensemble: Pilgrims' Procession \u2013 Pilgrim Mother, Pilgrim Father, Cunegonde, Old Lady, Candide, Chorus\n*Chorus: Alleluia \u2013 Pilgrims\n\nScene 4: Buenos Aires\n*Serenade: My Love \u2013 Governor of Buenos Aires, Cunegonde, Old Lady (Lyrics by Latouche and Wilbur) \n*Tango: I Am Easily Assimilated \u2013 Old Lady, Chorus, Cunegonde (Lyrics by Bernstein)\n*Quartet: Finale Act I \u2013 Candide, Cunegonde, Governor of Buenos Aires, Old Lady\n{{col-break}}\n\nAct 2\n\nEntr'acte \u2013 Orchestra\n\nScene 1: Buenos Aires\n*Trio: Quiet \u2013 Old Lady, Governor of Buenos Aires, Cunegonde\n*Ballad: Eldorado \u2013 Candide, Chorus (Lyrics by Lillian Hellman)\n*Schottische: Bon Voyage \u2013 Chorus, Governor of Buenos Aires\n\nScene 2: Venice\n*Ensemble: Money, Money, Money (Venice Gambling Scene) \u2013 Croupier and Gamblers\n*Waltz: What's the Use? \u2013 Madame Sofronia, Ferone, Prefect of Police, Prince Ivan, Chorus\n*Gavotte: The Venice Gavotte \u2013 Madame Sofronia, Candide, Dr. Pangloss, Cunegonde (Lyrics by Dorothy Parker)\n\nScene 3: Westphalia\n*Finale: Make Our Garden Grow \u2013 Candide, Cunegonde, Company\n{{col-end}}\n\n:* This version of the \"Lisbon Sequence\" was rewritten after the Boston try-out; it introduced the songs \"Auto-da-F\u00e9\" and \"Dear Boy\", reinstated in most revivals.\n:* The 1973 revival had a couple of songs added (music by Bernstein and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim unless otherwise noted); \"Life Is Happiness Indeed\", \"Auto Da Fe\u2014What a Day\" (lyrics by Sondheim and Latouche), \"This World\", \"The Sheep's Song\", and \"O Misere\".<ref>[http://www.sondheim.com/works/candide/ ''Candide''], sondheim.com</ref>\n\n===1989 production===\nBernstein's \"final revised version\", recorded in 1989:<ref name=\"Hutchins\"/><ref>Hutchins.
