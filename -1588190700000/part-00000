The creation of these plans was ordered by British prime minister [[Winston Churchill]] in 1945 and developed by the [[British Armed Forces]]' Joint Planning Staff at the [[end of World War II in Europe]].\n\nThe first of the two assumed a surprise attack on the Soviet forces stationed in Germany in order to \"impose the will of the Western Allies\" on the Soviets. \"The will\" was qualified as \"a square deal for [[Poland]]\"<ref name=\"OpRep-1\"/>&nbsp;\u2013 which probably meant enforcing the recently signed [[Yalta Agreement]].{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} When the odds were judged \"fanciful\", the original plan was abandoned. The code name was used instead for a defensive scenario, in which the British were to defend against a Soviet drive towards the North Sea and the Atlantic following the withdrawal of the American forces from the continent.\n\nThe study became the first [[Cold War]]-era [[contingency plan]] for [[World War III|war with the Soviet Union]].<ref name=\"Costigliola-336\"/> Both plans were highly secret at the time of their creation and it was not until 1998 that they were made public,<ref name=\"Gibbons-158\"/> although a British spy for the Soviets, [[Guy Burgess]], had passed on some details at the time.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Operations==\n===Offensive===\nThe initial primary goal of the operation was declared as \"to impose upon Russia the will of the United States and the British Empire. Even though 'the will' of these two countries may be defined as no more than a square deal for Poland, that does not necessarily limit the military commitment\".<ref name=\"OpRep-1\"/> (The Soviet Union is referred to as \"[[Russia]]\" throughout the document, a [[metonymy|metonym]] common in the West during the Cold War.)\n\nThe chiefs of staff were concerned that given the enormous size of Soviet forces deployed in Europe at the end of the war, and the perception that the Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] was unreliable, there existed a Soviet threat to Western Europe. The Soviet Union had yet to launch its [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|attack on Japanese forces]], and so one assumption in the report was that the Soviet Union would instead ally with Japan if the Western Allies commenced hostilities.\n\nThe hypothetical date for the start of the Allied invasion of Soviet-held Europe was scheduled for 1 July 1945, four days before the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|UK general election]].<ref name=\"Reynolds-250\"/> The plan assumed a [[Preventive war|surprise attack]] by up to 47 British and American [[Division (military)|divisions]] in the area of [[Dresden]], in the middle of Soviet lines.<ref name=\"Reynolds-250\"/> This represented almost half of the roughly 100 divisions available to the British, American and Canadian headquarters at that time.<ref name=\"Gibbons-158\"/>\n\nThe plan was taken by the British [[Chiefs of Staff Committee]] as militarily unfeasible due to an anticipated 2.5 to 1 superiority in divisions of Soviet land forces in Europe and the Middle East by 1 July, where the conflict was projected to take place.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20101116152301/http://www.history.neu.edu/PRO2/ Operation Unthinkable p. 22] Retrieved 2 May 2017</ref> The majority of any offensive operation would have been undertaken by American and British forces, as well as [[Polish Armed Forces in the West|Polish]] forces and up to 10 divisions of the former [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Wehrmacht]], re-mobilized from POW status. Any quick success would be due to surprise alone. If a quick success could not be obtained before the onset of winter, the assessment was that the Allies would be committed to a protracted [[total war]]. In the report of 22 May 1945, an offensive operation was deemed \"hazardous\".\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|+ The balance of forces in Western Europe and Italy, Spring 1945{{efn|Excludes Soviet non-operational forces, Soviet equipment in storage/repair/replacement depots, and Allied forces in other theatres}}\n|-\n!\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background: #E6EEFF;\" | Allied\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background: #FFE6E6;\" | Soviet<ref>\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u044f \u041e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430: \u0414\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f \u0430\u0440\u043c\u0438\u044f, \"1 January 1945\"</ref>\n!\n|-\n!\n! style=\"background: #E6EEFF;\" | W.

The report concluded that if the United States focused on the Pacific Theatre, Great Britain's odds \"would become fanciful.\"<ref name=\"OpRep-24\"/>\n\nThe Joint Planning Staff rejected Churchill's notion of retaining [[bridgehead]]s on the continent as having no operational advantage. It was envisaged that Britain would use its air force and navy to resist, although a threat from mass rocket attack was anticipated, with no means of resistance except for [[strategic bombing]].\n\n==Subsequent discussions==\nBy 1946, tensions and conflicts were developing between Allied-occupied and Soviet-occupied areas of Europe. These were seen as being potential triggers for a wider conflict. One such area was the [[Julian March]] (an area of southeastern Europe, today split among Croatia, Slovenia, and Italy), and on 30 August 1946 informal discussions took place between the British and US chiefs of staff concerning how such a conflict could develop and the best strategy for conducting a European war.<ref name=\"OpRep-35\"/> Again the issue of retaining a bridgehead on the continent was discussed, with [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] preferring a withdrawal to the [[Low Countries]], rather than [[Italy]], for their proximity to the United Kingdom.\n\n==Possible Soviet awareness==\n\nIn June 1945 senior Soviet Army commander Marshal Georgi [[Zhukov]]  suddenly ordered Soviet forces in Poland to regroup and prepare their positions for defence.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} According to Edinburgh University professor John Erickson, Operation Unthinkable helps to explain why he did it. Had the plans of the operation been transmitted to Moscow by the [[Cambridge Five]] it would explain the sudden orders to regroup and prepare for defence, however, it is just as possible that it was Soviet mistrust of Western Allies. If the Soviets had indeed known that the Western Allies were planning a possible attack, the element of surprise would have been lost before operations against the Soviets even began, further reducing the chances of Operation Unthinkable's success.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Operation Dropshot]]\n* [[Operation Pike]]\n* [[Plan Totality]]\n* [[Seven Days to the River Rhine]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist\n|refs =\n<ref name=\"Reynolds-250\">Reynolds, p. 250</ref>\n<ref name=\"Costigliola-336\">Costigliola, p. 336</ref>\n<ref name=\"Gibbons-158\">Gibbons, p. 158</ref>\n<ref name=\"OpRep-1\">Operation Unthinkable..., p. {{cite web |url=http://www.history.neu.edu/PRO2/pages/002.htm |title=1 |access-date=2015-09-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101116160624/http://www.history.neu.edu/PRO2/pages/002.htm |archive-date=16 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"OpRep-30\">Operation Unthinkable..., p. {{cite web |url=http://www.history.neu.edu/PRO2/pages/030.htm |title=30 (Annex) |access-date=2010-11-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116160624/http://www.history.neu.edu/PRO2/pages/030.htm |archive-date=16 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"OpRep-24\">Operation Unthinkable..., p. {{cite web |url=http://www.history.neu.edu/PRO2/pages/024.htm |title=24 |access-date=2015-05-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116160324/http://www.history.neu.edu/PRO2/pages/024.htm |archive-date=16 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"OpRep-35\">Operation Unthinkable..., p. {{cite web |url=http://www.history.neu.edu/PRO2/pages/035.htm |title=35 |access-date=2010-11-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116160624/http://www.history.neu.edu/PRO2/pages/035.htm |archivedate=16 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n;

The code name was used instead for a defensive scenario, in which the British were to defend against a Soviet drive towards the North Sea and the Atlantic following the withdrawal of the American forces from the continent.\n\nThe study became the first [[Cold War]]-era [[contingency plan]] for [[World War III|war with the Soviet Union]].<ref name=\"Costigliola-336\"/> Both plans were highly secret at the time of their creation and it was not until 1998 that they were made public,<ref name=\"Gibbons-158\"/> although a British spy for the Soviets, [[Guy Burgess]], had passed on some details at the time.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Operations==\n===Offensive===\nThe initial primary goal of the operation was declared as \"to impose upon Russia the will of the United States and the British Empire. Even though 'the will' of these two countries may be defined as no more than a square deal for Poland, that does not necessarily limit the military commitment\".<ref name=\"OpRep-1\"/> (The Soviet Union is referred to as \"[[Russia]]\" throughout the document, a [[metonymy|metonym]] common in the West during the Cold War.)\n\nThe chiefs of staff were concerned that given the enormous size of Soviet forces deployed in Europe at the end of the war, and the perception that the Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] was unreliable, there existed a Soviet threat to Western Europe. The Soviet Union had yet to launch its [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|attack on Japanese forces]], and so one assumption in the report was that the Soviet Union would instead ally with Japan if the Western Allies commenced hostilities.\n\nThe hypothetical date for the start of the Allied invasion of Soviet-held Europe was scheduled for 1 July 1945, four days before the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|UK general election]].<ref name=\"Reynolds-250\"/> The plan assumed a [[Preventive war|surprise attack]] by up to 47 British and American [[Division (military)|divisions]] in the area of [[Dresden]], in the middle of Soviet lines.<ref name=\"Reynolds-250\"/> This represented almost half of the roughly 100 divisions available to the British, American and Canadian headquarters at that time.<ref name=\"Gibbons-158\"/>\n\nThe plan was taken by the British [[Chiefs of Staff Committee]] as militarily unfeasible due to an anticipated 2.5 to 1 superiority in divisions of Soviet land forces in Europe and the Middle East by 1 July, where the conflict was projected to take place.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20101116152301/http://www.history.neu.edu/PRO2/ Operation Unthinkable p. 22] Retrieved 2 May 2017</ref> The majority of any offensive operation would have been undertaken by American and British forces, as well as [[Polish Armed Forces in the West|Polish]] forces and up to 10 divisions of the former [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Wehrmacht]], re-mobilized from POW status. Any quick success would be due to surprise alone. If a quick success could not be obtained before the onset of winter, the assessment was that the Allies would be committed to a protracted [[total war]]. In the report of 22 May 1945, an offensive operation was deemed \"hazardous\".\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|+ The balance of forces in Western Europe and Italy, Spring 1945{{efn|Excludes Soviet non-operational forces, Soviet equipment in storage/repair/replacement depots, and Allied forces in other theatres}}\n|-\n!\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background: #E6EEFF;\" | Allied\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background: #FFE6E6;\" | Soviet<ref>\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u044f \u041e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430: \u0414\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f \u0430\u0440\u043c\u0438\u044f, \"1 January 1945\"</ref>\n!\n|-\n!\n! style=\"background: #E6EEFF;\" | W.

The report concluded that if the United States focused on the Pacific Theatre, Great Britain's odds \"would become fanciful.\"<ref name=\"OpRep-24\"/>\n\nThe Joint Planning Staff rejected Churchill's notion of retaining [[bridgehead]]s on the continent as having no operational advantage. It was envisaged that Britain would use its air force and navy to resist, although a threat from mass rocket attack was anticipated, with no means of resistance except for [[strategic bombing]].\n\n==Subsequent discussions==\nBy 1946, tensions and conflicts were developing between Allied-occupied and Soviet-occupied areas of Europe. These were seen as being potential triggers for a wider conflict. One such area was the [[Julian March]] (an area of southeastern Europe, today split among Croatia, Slovenia, and Italy), and on 30 August 1946 informal discussions took place between the British and US chiefs of staff concerning how such a conflict could develop and the best strategy for conducting a European war.<ref name=\"OpRep-35\"/> Again the issue of retaining a bridgehead on the continent was discussed, with [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] preferring a withdrawal to the [[Low Countries]], rather than [[Italy]], for their proximity to the United Kingdom.\n\n==Possible Soviet awareness==\n\nIn June 1945 senior Soviet Army commander Marshal Georgi [[Zhukov]]  suddenly ordered Soviet forces in Poland to regroup and prepare their positions for defence.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} According to Edinburgh University professor John Erickson, Operation Unthinkable helps to explain why he did it. Had the plans of the operation been transmitted to Moscow by the [[Cambridge Five]] it would explain the sudden orders to regroup and prepare for defence, however, it is just as possible that it was Soviet mistrust of Western Allies. If the Soviets had indeed known that the Western Allies were planning a possible attack, the element of surprise would have been lost before operations against the Soviets even began, further reducing the chances of Operation Unthinkable's success.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Operation Dropshot]]\n* [[Operation Pike]]\n* [[Plan Totality]]\n* [[Seven Days to the River Rhine]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist\n|refs =\n<ref name=\"Reynolds-250\">Reynolds, p. 250</ref>\n<ref name=\"Costigliola-336\">Costigliola, p. 336</ref>\n<ref name=\"Gibbons-158\">Gibbons, p. 158</ref>\n<ref name=\"OpRep-1\">Operation Unthinkable..., p. {{cite web |url=http://www.history.neu.edu/PRO2/pages/002.htm |title=1 |access-date=2015-09-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101116160624/http://www.history.neu.edu/PRO2/pages/002.htm |archive-date=16 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"OpRep-30\">Operation Unthinkable..., p. {{cite web |url=http://www.history.neu.edu/PRO2/pages/030.htm |title=30 (Annex) |access-date=2010-11-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116160624/http://www.history.neu.edu/PRO2/pages/030.htm |archive-date=16 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"OpRep-24\">Operation Unthinkable..., p. {{cite web |url=http://www.history.neu.edu/PRO2/pages/024.htm |title=24 |access-date=2015-05-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116160324/http://www.history.neu.edu/PRO2/pages/024.htm |archive-date=16 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"OpRep-35\">Operation Unthinkable..., p. {{cite web |url=http://www.history.neu.edu/PRO2/pages/035.htm |title=35 |access-date=2010-11-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116160624/http://www.history.neu.edu/PRO2/pages/035.htm |archivedate=16 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n; Books\n* {{cite book |first=Jonathan |last=Walker |title=Operation Unthinkable: The Third World War|year=2013 |publisher=[[The History Press]] |isbn=9780752487182 |page=192 }}\n*  {{cite book |first=David |last=Reynolds |authorlink=David Reynolds (English historian) |title=From World War to Cold War: Churchill, Roosevelt, and the International History of the 1940s  |year=2006 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-928411-5 |oclc= |page = 376 }}\n*  {{cite book |first=Joel Clarke |last=Gibbons |title=The Empire Strikes a Match in a World Full of Oil |year=2009 |publisher=Xlibris Corporation |location=Bloomington, IN |isbn=9781450008693 |oclc= |page = 352 }}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}\n*  {{cite book |first=Frank |last=Costigliola |title=Roosevelt's Lost Alliances: How Personal Politics Helped Start the Cold War |year=2011 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |location= |isbn=9780691121291 |oclc= |page = 544 }}\n\n; Documents\n*  {{cite web | last = [[Churchill War Ministry|British War Cabinet]], [[Joint Planning Staff]], Public Record Office, CAB 120/691/109040 / 002 | date = 11 August 1945 | url = http://www.history.neu.edu/PRO2/ | title = Operation Unthinkable: 'Russia: Threat to Western Civilization' | format = online photocopy | publisher=Department of History, [[Northeastern University]] | accessdate = 9 May 2006 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101116160624/http://www.history.neu.edu/PRO2/ | archive-date = 16 November 2010 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* Richard Norton-Taylor: Churchill plotted invasion of Russia; Richard Norton-Taylor on allied blueprint to crush Soviet system after the end of the war in Europe, The Guardian, 2 October 1998\n* Julian Lewis: [https://www.routledge.com/products/9780415491716 ''Changing Direction: British Military Planning for Post-war Strategic Defence''], 2nd edn., Routledge, 2008, pp.xxx-xl ({{ISBN|0-415-49171-1}})\n*[http://indrus.in/blogs/2013/06/13/operation_unthinkable_churchills_plan_to_start_world_war_iii_26091.html Operation Unthinkable: Churchill\u2019s plan to start World War III]\n* {{cite book |first=Sam |last=Hines |url=http://www.grin.com/en/e-book/336255/operation-unthinkable-its-significance-in-the-development-of-the-cold |title=Operation Unthinkable: Its significance in the development of the Cold War|year=2016 |publisher=[[GRIN Verlag]] |isbn=9783668261228}}\n\n{{Cold War}}\n{{Winston Churchill}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Unthinkable}}\n[[Category:Cancelled military operations involving the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Cancelled military operations involving the United States]]\n[[Category:Cold War military history of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Soviet Union\u2013United Kingdom relations]]\n[[Category:Cancelled invasions]]\n[[Category:Military plans]]\n", "name_user": "Citadel2811", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Unthinkable"}

It is the sixth and final Eon film to star [[Sean Connery]], who returned to the role as the fictional [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]], having declined to reprise the role in ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' (1969).\n\nThe film is based on [[Ian Fleming]]'s 1956 [[Diamonds Are Forever (novel)|novel of the same name]], and is the second of four ''James Bond'' films directed by [[Guy Hamilton]]. The story has Bond impersonating a diamond smuggler to infiltrate a smuggling ring, and soon uncovering a plot by his old enemy [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] to use the diamonds to build a space-based laser weapon. Bond has to battle his enemy for one last time, to stop the smuggling and stall Blofeld's plan of destroying [[Washington, D.C.]], and extorting the world with nuclear supremacy.\n\nAfter [[George Lazenby]] left the series, producers [[Harry Saltzman]] and [[Albert R. Broccoli]] tested other actors, but studio [[United Artists]] wanted [[Sean Connery]] back, paying a then-record $1.25 million salary for him to return. The producers were inspired by ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]''; as with that film, Guy Hamilton was hired to direct, and [[Shirley Bassey]] performs vocals on the title theme song. Locations included [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], California, [[Amsterdam]] and [[Lufthansa]]'s hangar in West Germany. ''Diamonds Are Forever'' was a commercial success, and received positive reviews upon initial release, but it retrospectively was met with criticism for its humorous [[camp (style)|camp]] tone. The film marked the final appearance of the [[SPECTRE]] organization (though not by name) in Eon's Bond films until the [[Spectre (2015 film)|2015 film of the same name]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words. -->\nJames Bond\u2014agent 007\u2014pursues [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] and eventually finds him at a facility where Blofeld look-alikes are being created through surgery. Bond kills a test subject, and later the \"real\" Blofeld, by drowning him in a pool of superheated mud.\n\nWhile assassins [[Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd]] systematically kill several diamond smugglers, [[M (James Bond)|M]] suspects [[South Africa]]n diamonds are being stockpiled to depress prices by [[Dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]], and orders Bond to uncover the smuggling ring. Posing as professional smuggler and assassin Peter Franks, Bond travels to [[Amsterdam]] to meet contact [[Tiffany Case]]. The real Franks shows up, but Bond intercepts and kills him, and switches IDs to make it seem like Franks is Bond. Case and Bond then go to [[Los Angeles]], smuggling the diamonds inside Franks' corpse.\n\nAt the airport Bond meets his CIA ally [[Felix Leiter]], then travels to [[Las Vegas]]. At a funeral home, Franks' body is cremated and the diamonds passed on to another smuggler, Shady Tree. Bond is nearly killed by Wint and Kidd when they put him in a casket to be burned in a cremation retort, but Tree stops the process when he discovers that the diamonds in Franks' body were fakes planted by Bond and the CIA.\n\nBond tells Leiter to ship him the real diamonds. Bond then goes to the Whyte House, a casino-hotel owned by the reclusive billionaire Willard Whyte, where Tree works as a stand-up comedian. Bond discovers there that Tree has been killed by Wint and Kidd, who did not know that the diamonds were fake.\n\nAt the [[craps]] table Bond meets the opportunistic [[Bond girl|Plenty O'Toole]], and after gambling, brings her to his room. Gang members ambush them, throwing O'Toole out the window and into the pool. Bond spends the rest of the night with Tiffany Case, instructing her to retrieve the real diamonds at the [[Circus Circus Las Vegas|Circus Circus]] casino.\n\nTiffany reneges on her deal to meet back with Bond and instead flees, passing off the diamonds to the next smuggler. However, seeing that O'Toole was killed after being mistaken for her, Tiffany changes her mind. She drives Bond to the airport, where the diamonds are given to Professor Metz, a laser refraction specialist, who is followed to a remote facility. Bond enters the apparent destination of the diamonds; a research laboratory owned by Whyte, where a satellite is being built by Metz. When Bond's cover is blown, he escapes by stealing a [[moon buggy]] and reunites with Tiffany.\n\nBond scales the walls to the Whyte House's top floor to confront Whyte. He is instead met by two identical Blofelds, who use an electronic device to sound like Whyte. Bond kills one of the Blofelds, which turns out to be a look-alike. He is then knocked out by gas, picked up by Wint and Kidd, and taken out to [[Las Vegas Valley]], where he is placed in a pipeline and left to die.\n\nBond escapes, then calls Blofeld, using a similar electronic device to pose as Whyte's assistant Saxby. He finds out Whyte's location and rescues him, Saxby being killed in the gunfight. In the meantime, Blofeld abducts Case. With the help of Whyte, Bond raids the lab and uncovers Blofeld's plot to create a [[sun gun|laser satellite]] using the diamonds, which by now has already been sent into orbit. With the satellite, Blofeld destroys nuclear weapons in China, the [[Soviet Union]] and the United States, then proposes an international auction for global nuclear supremacy.\n\nWhyte identifies an [[oil platform]] off the coast of [[Baja California]] as Blofeld's likely base of operations. After Bond's attempt to change the cassette containing the satellite control codes fails due to a mistake by Tiffany, a helicopter attack on the oil rig is launched by Leiter and the CIA. Blofeld tries to escape in a [[midget submarine]], but Bond gains control of the submarine's launch crane and crashes the sub into the control room, causing both the satellite control and the base to be destroyed. Bond and Tiffany then head for Britain on a [[SS Canberra|cruise ship]], where Wint and Kidd pose as room-service stewards and attempt to kill them with a hidden bomb. Bond kills them instead.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[James Bond]]: [[United Kingdom|British]] MI6 agent 007.\n* [[Jill St. John]] as [[Tiffany Case]]: A diamond smuggler.\n* [[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]] as [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]]: The head of [[SPECTRE]] and Bond's arch-enemy.

But action there is, plenty of it in the familiar Bond manner.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Diamonds Are Forever (British\u2013Color)|url=https://variety.com/1970/film/reviews/diamonds-are-forever-1200422521/|work=Variety|page=6|date=15 December 1971|accessdate=24 April 2020}}</ref> \n\n===Retrospective reviews===\nTwenty-five years after its release, [[James Berardinelli]] criticised the concept of a laser-shooting [[satellite]], and the performances of [[Jill St. John]], [[Norman Burton]] and [[Jimmy Dean]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/d/diamonds.html | title=Diamonds Are Forever: A film review| last=Berardinelli| first=James| year=1996| website=ReeViews| accessdate=5 February 2008}}</ref> [[Christopher Null]] called St. John \"one of the least effective Bond girls \u2013 beautiful, but shrill and helpless\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/reviews/Diamonds-Are-Forever|title=Diamonds are Forever|last=Null|first=Christopher|publisher=Filmcritic.com|accessdate=5 February 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211215830/http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/reviews/Diamonds-Are-Forever|archivedate=11 February 2010}}</ref> Steve Rhodes said, \"looking and acting like a couple of pseudo-country bumpkins, [Putter Smith and Bruce Glover] seem to have wandered by accident from the adjoining sound stage into the filming of this movie.\" But he also extolled the car chase as \"classic\".<ref>{{cite web|year=1998 |url=https://www.imdb.com/Reviews/110/11069| title=Diamonds are Forever| last=Rhodes| first=Steve| work=IMDb Reviews| accessdate=5 February 2008}}</ref> \n\nAccording to [[Danny Peary]], ''Diamonds are Forever'' is \"one of the most forgettable movies of the entire Bond series\" and that \"until Blofeld's reappearance we must watch what is no better than a mundane diamond-smuggling melodrama, without the spectacle we associate with James Bond: the Las Vegas setting isn't exotic enough, there's little humour, assassins Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint are similar to characters you'd find on ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'', but not nearly as amusing \u2013 and the trouble Bond gets into, even [[Maxwell Smart]] could escape.\"<ref>Danny Peary, ''Guide for the Film Fanatic'' (Simon & Schuster, 1986) p.123</ref> [[IGN]] chose it as the third worst James Bond film, behind only ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' and ''[[Die Another Day]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/746/746573p1.html|title=James Bond's Top 20|website=IGN|date=17 November 2006|accessdate=21 December 2007}}</ref> ''[[Total Film]]'' listed Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, and Bambi and Thumper, as the first and second worst villains in the Bond series (respectively).{{wbr}}\n<ref>{{cite news|author=Chris Hicks|title=Bond Month: The crappest Bond {{sic|villians|nolink=y}} of all time|work=[[Total Film]]|date=13 October 2008|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/features/bond-month-the-crappest-bond-villians-of-all-time/bambi-and-thumper|url-status=dead\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729172602/http://www.totalfilm.com/features/bond-month-the-crappest-bond-villians-of-all-time/bambi-and-thumper\n|archive-date=July 29, 2012}}</ref> The film was more positively received by Xan Brooks of ''[[The Guardian]]'', who said it was \"oddly brilliant, the best of the bunch: the perfect bleary Bond film for an imperfect bleary western world.\"<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=My favourite Bond film: Diamonds Are Forever|first=Xan|last=Brooks|date=27 September 2012|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/sep/27/favourite-bond-diamonds-are-forever}}</ref> On the [[review aggregate]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 66% based on 47 reviews with an average rating of 6.3/10.

It is the sixth and final Eon film to star [[Sean Connery]], who returned to the role as the fictional [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]], having declined to reprise the role in ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' (1969).\n\nThe film is based on [[Ian Fleming]]'s 1956 [[Diamonds Are Forever (novel)|novel of the same name]], and is the second of four ''James Bond'' films directed by [[Guy Hamilton]]. The story has Bond impersonating a diamond smuggler to infiltrate a smuggling ring, and soon uncovering a plot by his old enemy [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] to use the diamonds to build a space-based laser weapon. Bond has to battle his enemy for one last time, to stop the smuggling and stall Blofeld's plan of destroying [[Washington, D.C.]], and extorting the world with nuclear supremacy.\n\nAfter [[George Lazenby]] left the series, producers [[Harry Saltzman]] and [[Albert R. Broccoli]] tested other actors, but studio [[United Artists]] wanted [[Sean Connery]] back, paying a then-record $1.25 million salary for him to return. The producers were inspired by ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]''; as with that film, Guy Hamilton was hired to direct, and [[Shirley Bassey]] performs vocals on the title theme song. Locations included [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], California, [[Amsterdam]] and [[Lufthansa]]'s hangar in West Germany. ''Diamonds Are Forever'' was a commercial success, and received positive reviews upon initial release, but it retrospectively was met with criticism for its humorous [[camp (style)|camp]] tone. The film marked the final appearance of the [[SPECTRE]] organization (though not by name) in Eon's Bond films until the [[Spectre (2015 film)|2015 film of the same name]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are 400 to 700 words. -->\nJames Bond\u2014agent 007\u2014pursues [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] and eventually finds him at a facility where Blofeld look-alikes are being created through surgery. Bond kills a test subject, and later the \"real\" Blofeld, by drowning him in a pool of superheated mud.\n\nWhile assassins [[Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd]] systematically kill several diamond smugglers, [[M (James Bond)|M]] suspects [[South Africa]]n diamonds are being stockpiled to depress prices by [[Dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]], and orders Bond to uncover the smuggling ring. Posing as professional smuggler and assassin Peter Franks, Bond travels to [[Amsterdam]] to meet contact [[Tiffany Case]]. The real Franks shows up, but Bond intercepts and kills him, and switches IDs to make it seem like Franks is Bond. Case and Bond then go to [[Los Angeles]], smuggling the diamonds inside Franks' corpse.\n\nAt the airport Bond meets his CIA ally [[Felix Leiter]], then travels to [[Las Vegas]]. At a funeral home, Franks' body is cremated and the diamonds passed on to another smuggler, Shady Tree. Bond is nearly killed by Wint and Kidd when they put him in a casket to be burned in a cremation retort, but Tree stops the process when he discovers that the diamonds in Franks' body were fakes planted by Bond and the CIA.\n\nBond tells Leiter to ship him the real diamonds. Bond then goes to the Whyte House, a casino-hotel owned by the reclusive billionaire Willard Whyte, where Tree works as a stand-up comedian. Bond discovers there that Tree has been killed by Wint and Kidd, who did not know that the diamonds were fake.\n\nAt the [[craps]] table Bond meets the opportunistic [[Bond girl|Plenty O'Toole]], and after gambling, brings her to his room. Gang members ambush them, throwing O'Toole out the window and into the pool. Bond spends the rest of the night with Tiffany Case, instructing her to retrieve the real diamonds at the [[Circus Circus Las Vegas|Circus Circus]] casino.\n\nTiffany reneges on her deal to meet back with Bond and instead flees, passing off the diamonds to the next smuggler. However, seeing that O'Toole was killed after being mistaken for her, Tiffany changes her mind. She drives Bond to the airport, where the diamonds are given to Professor Metz, a laser refraction specialist, who is followed to a remote facility. Bond enters the apparent destination of the diamonds; a research laboratory owned by Whyte, where a satellite is being built by Metz. When Bond's cover is blown, he escapes by stealing a [[moon buggy]] and reunites with Tiffany.\n\nBond scales the walls to the Whyte House's top floor to confront Whyte. He is instead met by two identical Blofelds, who use an electronic device to sound like Whyte. Bond kills one of the Blofelds, which turns out to be a look-alike. He is then knocked out by gas, picked up by Wint and Kidd, and taken out to [[Las Vegas Valley]], where he is placed in a pipeline and left to die.\n\nBond escapes, then calls Blofeld, using a similar electronic device to pose as Whyte's assistant Saxby. He finds out Whyte's location and rescues him, Saxby being killed in the gunfight. In the meantime, Blofeld abducts Case. With the help of Whyte, Bond raids the lab and uncovers Blofeld's plot to create a [[sun gun|laser satellite]] using the diamonds, which by now has already been sent into orbit. With the satellite, Blofeld destroys nuclear weapons in China, the [[Soviet Union]] and the United States, then proposes an international auction for global nuclear supremacy.\n\nWhyte identifies an [[oil platform]] off the coast of [[Baja California]] as Blofeld's likely base of operations. After Bond's attempt to change the cassette containing the satellite control codes fails due to a mistake by Tiffany, a helicopter attack on the oil rig is launched by Leiter and the CIA. Blofeld tries to escape in a [[midget submarine]], but Bond gains control of the submarine's launch crane and crashes the sub into the control room, causing both the satellite control and the base to be destroyed. Bond and Tiffany then head for Britain on a [[SS Canberra|cruise ship]], where Wint and Kidd pose as room-service stewards and attempt to kill them with a hidden bomb. Bond kills them instead.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[James Bond]]: [[United Kingdom|British]] MI6 agent 007.\n* [[Jill St. John]] as [[Tiffany Case]]: A diamond smuggler.\n* [[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]] as [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]]: The head of [[SPECTRE]] and Bond's arch-enemy.

The plot was later changed after Broccoli had a dream, where his close friend [[Howard Hughes]] was replaced by an imposter.

Bond was to rouse the allies into action with a spoof of [[England expects that every man will do his duty|Lord Nelson's famous cry]], \"Las Vegas expects every man to do his duty.\" Maibaum was misinformed; there were no Roman galleys or Chinese junks in Las Vegas, and the idea was too expensive to replicate, so it was dropped.<ref name=\"hamilton\">{{cite AV media|people=[[Guy Hamilton]]|title = Commentary track: Diamonds Are Forever Ultimate Edition, Region 4 |medium = DVD |publisher = MGM Home Entertainment }}</ref><ref name=\"maibaum\">{{cite magazine|magazine=Starlog|date=1983|first=Lee|last=Goldberg|url=https://archive.org/stream/starlog_magazine-068/068#page/n26/mode/1up/search/%22richard+maibaum%22|page=27|title=Richard Maibaum 007's Puppermaster}}</ref>\n\nMaibaum may have thought the eventual oil-rig finale a poor substitute, but it was originally intended to be much more spectacular. Armed frogmen would jump from the [[helicopter]]s into the sea and attach limpet mines to the rig's legs (this explains why frogmen appear on the movie's poster). Blofeld would have escaped in his BathoSub and Bond would have pursued him, hanging from a weather balloon.<ref>{{cite AV media|title = Oil Rig Attack: Diamonds Are Forever Ultimate Edition, Disc 2 |medium = DVD |publisher = MGM Home Entertainment}}</ref> The chase would have continued across a salt mine, with the two mortal enemies scrambling over white hills of salt before Blofeld would fall to his death in a salt granulator.

We shot every night, I caught all the shows and played golf all day. On the weekend I collapsed \u2013 boy, did I collapse. Like a skull with legs.\" He also played the slot machines, and once delayed a scene because he was collecting his winnings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/sections/articles/history_press_daf_sean_connery_las_vegas_interview.php3|title=Rare interview with Sean Connery on the set of Diamonds Are Forever in Las Vegas|publisher=[[MI6-HQ.com]]|accessdate=30 March 2011}}</ref> While shooting in Las Vegas Connery dated his co-star Lana Wood.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.mi6-hq.com/news/index.php?itemid=9956 |title = Bond girl Lana Wood talks about Sean Connery affair}}</ref>\n\nThe site used for the Willard Whyte Space Labs (where Bond gets away in the Moon Buggy) was actually, at that time, a [[Johns-Manville]] [[gypsum]] plant located just outside Las Vegas. The home of [[Kirk Douglas]] was used for the scene in Tiffany's house, while the [[Elrod House]] in [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], designed by [[John Lautner]], became Willard Whyte's house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hgtv.com/decorating/diamonds-are-forever/index.html|title=Decorating: Diamonds are Forever|publisher=[[HGTV]]|accessdate=15 February 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625022615/http://www.hgtv.com/decorating/diamonds-are-forever/index.html|archivedate=25 June 2010}}</ref> The exterior shots of the Slumber mortuary were of the Palm Mortuary in [[Henderson, NV|Henderson]], [[Nevada]]. The interiors were a set constructed at Pinewood Studios, where Ken Adam imitated the real building's [[lozenge]]-shaped stained glass window in its [[nave]]. During location filming, Adam visited several funeral homes in the Las Vegas area, the inspiration behind the gaudy design of the Slumber mortuary (the use of tasteless [[Art Nouveau]] furniture and Tiffany lamps) came from these experiences.<ref name=\"locations\" /> Production wrapped with the crematorium sequence, on 13 August 1971.<ref name=\"cork\" />\n\nSince the car chase in Las Vegas would have many car crashes, the filmmakers had an arrangement with [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] to use their vehicles. Ford's only demand was that Sean Connery had to drive the [[Ford Mustang Mach 1|1971 Mustang Mach 1]] which serves as Tiffany Case's car.<ref name=\"hamilton\" /> The Moon Buggy was inspired by the [[Lunar rover|actual NASA vehicle]], but with additions such as flailing arms since the producers didn't find the design \"outrageous\" enough. Built by custom car fabricator [[Dean Jeffries]] on a rear-engined Corvair chassis, it was capable of road speeds. The [[fiberglass|fibreglass]]  tires had to be replaced during the chase sequence because the heat and irregular desert soil ruined them.<ref>{{cite AV media|people=[[Ken Adam]]|title = Commentary track: Diamonds Are Forever Ultimate Edition, Region 4 |medium = DVD|publisher = MGM Home Entertainment }}</ref>\n\nHamilton had the idea of making a fight scene inside a lift, which was choreographed and done by Sean Connery and stuntman [[Joe Robinson (actor)|Joe Robinson]].<ref>{{cite AV media|title=Double-O Stuntmen|location=The Man with the Golden Gun Ultimate Edition, Disk 2|publisher=MGM Home Entertainment}}</ref>  The car chase where the red Mustang comes outside of the narrow street on the opposite side in which it was rolled, was filmed over three nights on Fremont Street in Las Vegas. The alleyway car roll sequence is actually filmed in two locations. The entrance was at the car park at [[Universal Studios]] and the exit was at Fremont Street, Las Vegas. It eventually inspired a continuity mistake, as the car enters the alley on the right side tires and exits the street driving on the left side.<ref name=\"inside\" /> During the car chase where the police are chasing Bond in a small parking lot the Mustang was to jump a small ramp over several cars. [[Bill Hickman]] did this stunt; the hired stunt driver they had couldn't perform this and wrecked two or three cars. The stunt team had only one automobile left so they called Hickman \u2013 who drove for hours to the location, jumped into the Mustang, and did the stunt in one take.<ref name=tcm>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=235282&mainArticleId=235259|title=Diamonds Are Forever|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|accessdate=25 January 2011}}</ref> While filming the scene of finding Plenty O'Toole drowned in Tiffany's swimming pool, [[Lana Wood]] actually had her feet loosely tied to a cement block on the bottom. Film crew members held a rope across the pool for her, with which she could lift her face out of the water to breathe between takes. The pool's sloping bottom made the block slip into deeper water with each take. Eventually, Wood was submerged but was noticed by on-lookers and rescued before actually drowning. Wood, being a certified diver, took some water but remained calm during the ordeal, although she later admitted to a few \"very uncomfortable moments and quite some struggling until they pulled me out.\"<ref>{{cite AV media|people=[[Lana Wood]]|title= Commentary track: Diamonds Are Forever Ultimate Edition, Region 4 |medium = DVD |publisher = MGM Home Entertainment }}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Diamonds Are Forever (soundtrack)}}\n\n\"Diamonds Are Forever\", the title song, was the second James Bond theme to be performed by [[Shirley Bassey]], after \"[[Goldfinger (Shirley Bassey song)|Goldfinger]]\" in 1964. In an interview for the television programme ''James Bond's Greatest Hits'', composer [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] revealed that he told Bassey to imagine she was singing about a penis. Bassey would later return for a third performance for 1979's ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]''.\n\nThe original soundtrack was once again composed by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]], his sixth time composing for a Bond film.\n\nWith Connery back in the lead role, the \"[[James Bond Theme]]\" was played by an electric guitar in the somewhat unusual, blued [[gun barrel sequence]] accompanied with prismatic ripples of light, in the pre-credits sequence, and in a full orchestral version during a hovercraft sequence in Amsterdam.\n\n==Release and reception==\n''Diamonds are Forever'' premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square. It was released on 14 December 1971. It grossed [[$]]116 million worldwide,<ref name=\"numbers\">{{cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Diamonds-Are-Forever#tab=summary|title=Diamonds Are Forever (1971) - Financial Information|work=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]]|accessdate=24 December 2007}}</ref> of which [[$]]43 million was from the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=diamondsareforever.htm|title=Diamonds Are Forever|work=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=9 December 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Contemporary reviews===\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' noted, in a positive review, the irrelevance of the plot and \"moments of silliness\", such as Bond finding himself driving a moon buggy with antennae revolving and robot arms flapping.

A lot of things have changed since ''You Only Live Twice'' (1967), the last real Bond adventure, but 007 has remained a steadfast agent for the military-industrial complex, a friend to the C.I.A. and a triumphant sexist. It's enough to make one weepy with gratitude. I mean, not everything must be mutable. ''Diamonds Are Forever'' is also great, absurd fun, not only because it recalls the moods and manners of the sixties (which, being over, now seem safely comprehensible), but also because all of the people connected with the movie obviously know what they are up to.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Canby|first=Vincent|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/12/18/archives/a-benign-bond007-stars-in-diamonds-are-forever.html|title=Screen: 'A Benign Bond'|newspaper=The New York Times|page=34|date=18 December 1971|accessdate=24 April 2020}}</ref> \n\n[[Jay Cocks]], reviewing for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', felt ''Diamonds Are Forever'' was \"in some ways the best of the lot. It is by all odds the broadest\u2014which is to say wackiest, not sexiest.\" He further praised Connery as \"a fine, forceful actor with an undeniable presence [who] turns his well-publicized contempt for the Bond character into some wry moments of self-parody.

Yet ''Diamonds Are Forever'' doesn't carry the same quality or flair as its many predecessors. Apparently Messrs. Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, who have made a fortune producing these Ian Fleming-inspired mellers, have reached that point where a sustained story means little in prepping an 007 picture. That is what this latest in the series lacks, and for this reason there can be no suspense. But action there is, plenty of it in the familiar Bond manner.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Diamonds Are Forever (British\u2013Color)|url=https://variety.com/1970/film/reviews/diamonds-are-forever-1200422521/|work=Variety|page=6|date=15 December 1971|accessdate=24 April 2020}}</ref> \n\n===Retrospective reviews===\nTwenty-five years after its release, [[James Berardinelli]] criticised the concept of a laser-shooting [[satellite]], and the performances of [[Jill St. John]], [[Norman Burton]] and [[Jimmy Dean]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/d/diamonds.html | title=Diamonds Are Forever: A film review| last=Berardinelli| first=James| year=1996| website=ReeViews| accessdate=5 February 2008}}</ref> [[Christopher Null]] called St. John \"one of the least effective Bond girls \u2013 beautiful, but shrill and helpless\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/reviews/Diamonds-Are-Forever|title=Diamonds are Forever|last=Null|first=Christopher|publisher=Filmcritic.com|accessdate=5 February 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211215830/http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/reviews/Diamonds-Are-Forever|archivedate=11 February 2010}}</ref> Steve Rhodes said, \"looking and acting like a couple of pseudo-country bumpkins, [Putter Smith and Bruce Glover] seem to have wandered by accident from the adjoining sound stage into the filming of this movie.\" But he also extolled the car chase as \"classic\".<ref>{{cite web|year=1998 |url=https://www.imdb.com/Reviews/110/11069| title=Diamonds are Forever| last=Rhodes| first=Steve| work=IMDb Reviews| accessdate=5 February 2008}}</ref> \n\nAccording to [[Danny Peary]], ''Diamonds are Forever'' is \"one of the most forgettable movies of the entire Bond series\" and that \"until Blofeld's reappearance we must watch what is no better than a mundane diamond-smuggling melodrama, without the spectacle we associate with James Bond: the Las Vegas setting isn't exotic enough, there's little humour, assassins Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint are similar to characters you'd find on ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'', but not nearly as amusing \u2013 and the trouble Bond gets into, even [[Maxwell Smart]] could escape.\"<ref>Danny Peary, ''Guide for the Film Fanatic'' (Simon & Schuster, 1986) p.123</ref> [[IGN]] chose it as the third worst James Bond film, behind only ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' and ''[[Die Another Day]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/746/746573p1.html|title=James Bond's Top 20|website=IGN|date=17 November 2006|accessdate=21 December 2007}}</ref> ''[[Total Film]]'' listed Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, and Bambi and Thumper, as the first and second worst villains in the Bond series (respectively).{{wbr}}\n<ref>{{cite news|author=Chris Hicks|title=Bond Month: The crappest Bond {{sic|villians|nolink=y}} of all time|work=[[Total Film]]|date=13 October 2008|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/features/bond-month-the-crappest-bond-villians-of-all-time/bambi-and-thumper|url-status=dead\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729172602/http://www.totalfilm.com/features/bond-month-the-crappest-bond-villians-of-all-time/bambi-and-thumper\n|archive-date=July 29, 2012}}</ref> The film was more positively received by Xan Brooks of ''[[The Guardian]]'', who said it was \"oddly brilliant, the best of the bunch: the perfect bleary Bond film for an imperfect bleary western world.\"<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=My favourite Bond film: Diamonds Are Forever|first=Xan|last=Brooks|date=27 September 2012|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/sep/27/favourite-bond-diamonds-are-forever}}</ref> On the [[review aggregate]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 66% based on 47 reviews with an average rating of 6.3/10.

During [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]], Christians considered [[Christian heresy|heresy]] and [[Dissenter|dissent]] punishable offenses. However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by deists like [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Contemporary Christians generally agree that heresy and dissent are not punishable offenses.<ref name=\"Coffey00-206\">Coffey 2000: 206.</ref>\n\n==Historical background ==\n====Early Christianity====\n\n[[Early Christianity]] was a minority religion in the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|the early Christians were persecuted, on and off, during their first 300 years]]. Christianity's definition and practice of tolerance/intolerance were influenced by that persecution in a largely negative way. However, according to Guy Stroumsa, there is still a history in early Christian thought of tolerance as a concept, though not a fully developed one, and with some ambivalence, presenting both inclusivity and inventing the concept of heresy in Christian thought.<ref name=\"Stroumsa\">{{cite book|last=Stroumsa|first=Guy|editor1=Graham N.Stanton|editor2=Guy G.

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198\u2013199}}\n\nConstantine used forced conversion and his Bishop Alcuin wrote him a rebuke against it.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200\u2013201}}\n\nThe crusades evidence a dramatic shift in Christian thought on tolerance and persecution.\n\n====High Middle Ages====\n\nFeudalism declined and persecution changed during the High Middle Ages as kings began centralizing power into themselves and the state.  Under feudalism, a noble Lord gave military support to his king, but when so many nobles sold or leased their land and left for the East on crusade, kings began building armies of mercenaries for themselves and taking over legal processes that had traditionally been local. This process led to the development of persecution of minorities between the tenth to the thirteenth centuries in Europe.<ref name =\"Moore\">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=R.

Inquisitions were formed. The church began passing the punishment of heretics to the civil authorities who practiced corporal punishments and death.\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] continued to pitch Christians and Muslims against each other in wars lasting into the late middle ages with massacres and atrocities on both sides.\n\n====Late Middle Ages====\nAfter the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and the later [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]]s in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were banned. This persecution only ended during the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century.\n\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades.

Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]]s also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to grant Muslims the right to freely practice their religion in 1492, this promise was frequently broken. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 the Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].)

He makes no mention of any role that Hypatia's paganism, or her science, or her philosophy might have played in her death. It was most likely politics which killed her. Christian thought of the time reflect genuine mourning of her death with no approval of mob violence.  However, rumors of [[Cyril of Alexandria|Bishop Cyril's]] involvement persist to this day.

Charlemagne was king. As king, he advocated Christian principles, had at least one Christian advisor, and openly supported Christian missions. The Franks had been fighting the Saxons since  Charlemagne's grandfather, with Charlemagne himself beginning in earnest in 772, taking years to finally defeat them.  They made treaties.  The events of 782 began when Widukind, the Saxon leader, persuaded a group of Saxons who had submitted to Charlemagne, to break their treaty and rebel. Charlemagne was elsewhere, so they went to battle with the Frankish army that had been left behind and annihilated it.  They killed two of the King\u2019s chief lieutenants, and some of his closest companions and counsellors. Charlemagne gathered his forces, returned to Saxony, conquered the Saxon rebels, giving them the option of convert or die. The Saxons largely refused, and though no one knows the number for sure, it is said 4500 unarmed prisoners were murdered in what is called the \"[[Massacre of Verden]].\" Massive deportations followed, and death was decreed as the penalty for any Saxon who refused baptism thereafter.<ref name =\"Logan\">{{cite book|last=Logan|first=F.

Clouse:<ref name=\"Clouse\"/>{{rp|18}}<blockquote>It is clear from the crusades that what finally overpowered the early Christian teaching against violence was not merely a just war theory but rather a merger of violence and holiness at all levels of Christian life. ... The liturgy was expanded to include the blessing of weapons and standards. Knights were consecrated by ceremonies which were often a revival of old pagan customs.  There were new militant religious orders established such as the Templars who promised to fight the enemies of God in addition to taking the normal vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.  When violence became sacred, the enemy was believed to be diabolical.  Thus the Turks were looked upon as opponents of the kingdom of God, a fulfillment of the forces of the antichrist as predicted in the book of Revelation.</blockquote>\n\nThis view of holiness and violence as merged in Christian thought is supported in Riley-Smith who says the crusades were products of the renewed spirituality of the central Middle Ages, with its concern for living the [[Vita apostolica|''vita apostolica'']] and expressing Christian ideals in active works of charity, exemplified by the new hospitals, the pastoral work of the Augustinians and Premonstratensians, and the service of the friars.

The king was a monarch in distress. He had little control of his fractious nobles in the north, and had absolutely no control over the southern nobles.<ref name=\"Moore2\"/>  He needed a way to channel the aggressive nature in the north and establish dominance in the South. All the men who marched from town to town, burning, killing, raping and looting, were from northern France.  And, under law in the Middle Ages, the lands of defeated barons could be legally confiscated. Moore says the Pope supplied an excuse for something the king wanted anyway. Markale states that it was Phillip who actually petitioned Innocent for permission to conduct the Crusade because he had heard of a treasure the Cathars had brought back from crusading.<ref name=\"Markale\">Markale,\u00a0J.\u00a0(2003).\u00a0Monts\u00e9gur and the Mystery of the Cathars.\u00a0United States:\u00a0Inner Traditions/Bear.</ref>.<ref name=\"Moore2\"/> \n\nThe Albigensian war was indisputably a case of the interlinking of religion and politics.<ref name=\"Repgen\"/> \n\n=====Massacre at B\u00e9ziers=====\nOn 22 July, 1209, the crusaders were busy setting up camp and getting settled in \u2014 still days away from starting the actual siege \u2014 when a group of people from the town came out of the gate overlooking the river Orb.

Soon the attackers from the town found themselves outnumbered and they retreated back into the town in disarray. The mercenaries quickly took advantage of the chaos and followed their retreat, storming the walls of the city that were not yet properly manned. The walls were easily taken, and the mercenaries entered the gate, seemingly without orders from their leaders. The crusader knights, soon realizing that the defenses had been broken, joined the mercenaries in battle, easily overwhelming the town garrison. The mercenaries began  rampaging through the streets, killing and plundering, while those citizens who could run, sought refuge in the churches and cathedrals, but there was no safety from the raging mob of mercenaries.

It included the Episcopal Inquisition (1184\u20131230s) which began when Pope Lucius the third issued a decree through the papal bull ''Ad abolendam,'' and the Papal Inquisition, which started in the 1230s. Canon law was still developing at this time, and it was based on Roman law to such a degree that it can be said the church reintroduced Roman law in Europe in the form of the Inquisition when it seemed that Germanic law had failed.<ref name=\"Monter\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Inquisition, The: The Inquisition In The Old World|author=William Monter|date=April 7, 2020|publisher=Encyclopedia.com| url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/inquisition-inquisition-old-world}}</ref>  In the Late Roman Empire, an inquisitorial system of justice had developed that allowed magistrates to investigate crimes in the absence of formal charges. The roles of evidence collector, prosecutor, and judge were combined in the inquisitor.  This inquisitorial process was in place when the Roman Empire converted to Christianity in the fourth century and it is the system that was revived in the middle ages. As a result, in his decretal of 1199, ''Vergentis in senium'', [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] (1198\u20131216), took the crucial step of combining heresy with the Roman-law doctrine of ''l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9'', thereby accusing heretics of treason against God.<ref name=\"Monter\"/>\n\nThe cultural and religious process of centralizing power included the development, between the tenth to the thirteenth centuries, of a new kind of persecution aimed at minorities who provided much of the fodder for inquisition.<ref name =\"Moore\"/>  For example, Peter Comestor (d.1197) was the first influential scholar to interpret biblical injunctions against sodomy as referring specifically to homosexual intercourse. The Third Lateran council of 1179 then became the first to legislate on it as deserving of being deprived of office or excommunicated.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|87}} The Fourth Lateran council reduced those penalties, but later Gregory IX ordered the Dominicans to extirpate homosexuality from Germany.  A series of legal codes were thereafter promulgated from the 1250s on in Spain, France, Italy and Germany. By 1300, places where sodomy was not a capitol offense had become the exception rather than the rule.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|87}}\n\nThe historian Robert Moore says most complex traditional societies, including those in early and medieval Europe, have always contained some kind of persecution that occurred and subsided and occurred again, but that twelfth century Europe's persecution was more serious because it was characterized by the demonization of the accused, a new attitude, and mechanisms such as new laws, and the inquisitions, a new method.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|154}}\n\n===The Jews===\nIn the centuries after the fall of the Roman empire, Jews established small communities, engaged in commerce, and were seldom singled out as targets of verbal abuse or physical violence.<ref name=\"Berger\">{{cite book|last=Berger|first=D|title=New Perspectives on Jewish-Christian Relations: In Honor of David Berger| year=2012|publisher=Brill|location=Netherlands|isbn=978-9-00422-117-8}}</ref>{{rp|2}}  However, historians agree that the eleventh to the thirteenth century was a turning point in Jewish-Christian relations.<blockquote> \"[[Bernard of Clairvaux]], (1090-1153) pillar of European monasticism and powerful twelfth century preacher, provides a perfect example of a Christian thinker balancing on a precipice, preaching hateful images of Jews at the same time as he sounded Scripture based admonitions that they must be protected despite their nature.<ref name=\"Berger\"/>{{rp|2}}</blockquote> Low level theological repartee had long existed between Jews and Christians. These interchanges attest to neighborly relations as Jew and Christian both struggled to fit \"other\" into their sense of the demands of their faith, and balance the human opponents facing them with the traditions they inherited.<ref name=\"Berger\"/>{{rp|3}} By the thirteenth century that repartee had changed in both tone and quality, growing more polemical.<ref name=\"Berger\"/>{{rp|3-7}} \n\nIn 1215, the [[Fourth Lateran Council]], known as the Great Council, met and accepted 70 canons that reflect Christian thinking as both militant and victorious in tone.<ref name=\"Berger\"/>{{rp|58}} It hammered out a working definition of Christian community, and stated the essentials of membership in it, thereby defining \"other\" within Christian thought for the next three centuries.  The last three canons required Jews to distinguish themselves from Christians in their dress, prohibited them from holding public office, and prohibited Jewish converts from continuing to practice Jewish rituals.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|7}} As Berger has articulated it: \"The other side of a coin of unique toleration was a unique persecution.\"<ref name=\"Berger\"/>{{rp|2}}.

As they learned how the central figures of Christianity were mocked, inquisitors went after the Talmud, and other Jewish writings.<ref name=\"Mundy\"/>{{rp|64}} The Fourth Lateran council, in its 68th canon, placed on the secular authorities the responsibility for obtaining an answer from the Jews to the charge of blasphemy. For the first time in history, Jews had to answer in public trial. There is no consensus in the sources as to who instigated the trial against the Talmud, but in June of 1239, [[Gregory IX]] (1237-1241) issued letters to various Archbishops and Kings across Europe to seize all Jewish books and take them to the Dominicans for examination.  The order was heeded only in Paris where, on June 25th, the Royal court was opened to hear the case. Eventually, each side claimed victory; a final verdict of guilt and condemnation was not announced until May of 1248, but the books had been burned six years before.<ref name=\"Rosenthal\">{{cite journal|last=Rosenthal|first= Judah M.|title=The Talmud on Trial: The Disputation at Paris in the Year 1240|journal= The Jewish Quarterly Review|volume= 47| issue= 1|year= 1956|pages=58\u201376|publisher= JSTOR|doi= 10.2307/1453186|jstor= 1453186}}</ref>{{rp|68-72}}  \n\nAs a result of this trial, the people of Europe thought that, even if they had once had an obligation to preserve the Jews for the sake of the Old Testament, Talmudic Judaism was so different from its biblical sources that the old obligation no longer applied.

They often filled the role of financial agent or manager for the Lords; they and their posessions were considered the property of the King in England; and they were often exempted from taxes and other laws because of the importance of their usury.  This attracted unpopularity, jealousy and resentment.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|110}} As J. H.

The unique culture of the High middle ages with its union of the spiritual and the secular began to come apart. Rival European states at war with each other dimmed the church's dream of a united Christendom.  New military weapons and tactics rendered chivalry obsolete.  In the Universities, new intellectual currents moved away from Christian thought, and new secular voices began to be heard. <ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|243,248}}\n\nFrom its pinnacle of power in the 1200s, the church entered a period of decline, internal conflict, and corruption.  Devoted and virtuous nuns and monks become increasingly rare. Monastic reform had been a major force in the High Middle Ages but is largely unknown in the Late Middle ages. This led to the development of lay piety--the ''devotio moderna''--the new devotion, which worked toward the ideal of a pious society of ordinary non-ordained people.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|248-250}}\n\nLeaders who attempted to reform the church in England and Bohemia met strong resistance from the Popes. [[John Wycliffe]] (1320-1384) urged the church to give up ownership of property, which produced much of the church's wealth, and to once again embrace poverty and simplicity. He urged the church to stop being subservient to the state and its politics. He denied papal authority. John Wycliff died of a stroke, but his followers, called ''Lollards,'' were declared heretics.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|249}}  The first large scale attack on the Lollards came the year after the [[Peasant revolt]] of 1381.

These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state.

It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by deists like [[Thomas Jefferson]].

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198\u2013199}}\n\nConstantine used forced conversion and his Bishop Alcuin wrote him a rebuke against it.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200\u2013201}}\n\nThe crusades evidence a dramatic shift in Christian thought on tolerance and persecution.\n\n====High Middle Ages====\n\nFeudalism declined and persecution changed during the High Middle Ages as kings began centralizing power into themselves and the state.  Under feudalism, a noble Lord gave military support to his king, but when so many nobles sold or leased their land and left for the East on crusade, kings began building armies of mercenaries for themselves and taking over legal processes that had traditionally been local. This process led to the development of persecution of minorities between the tenth to the thirteenth centuries in Europe.<ref name =\"Moore\">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=R.

Inquisitions were formed. The church began passing the punishment of heretics to the civil authorities who practiced corporal punishments and death.\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] continued to pitch Christians and Muslims against each other in wars lasting into the late middle ages with massacres and atrocities on both sides.\n\n====Late Middle Ages====\nAfter the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and the later [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]]s in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were banned. This persecution only ended during the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century.\n\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to grant Muslims the right to freely practice their religion in 1492, this promise was frequently broken. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 the Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].) Some recent political conflicts are sometimes considered [[religious persecution]]s.

Charlemagne was king. As king, he advocated Christian principles, had at least one Christian advisor, and openly supported Christian missions. The Franks had been fighting the Saxons since  Charlemagne's grandfather, with Charlemagne himself beginning in earnest in 772, taking years to finally defeat them.  They made treaties.  The events of 782 began when Widukind, the Saxon leader, persuaded a group of Saxons who had submitted to Charlemagne, to break their treaty and rebel. Charlemagne was elsewhere, so they went to battle with the Frankish army that had been left behind and annihilated it.  They killed two of the King\u2019s chief lieutenants, and some of his closest companions and counsellors. Charlemagne gathered his forces, returned to Saxony, conquered the Saxon rebels, giving them the option of convert or die. The Saxons largely refused, and though no one knows the number for sure, it is said 4500 unarmed prisoners were murdered in what is called the \"[[Massacre of Verden]].\" Massive deportations followed, and death was decreed as the penalty for any Saxon who refused baptism thereafter.<ref name =\"Logan\">{{cite book|last=Logan|first=F.

Clouse:<ref name=\"Clouse\"/>{{rp|18}}<blockquote>It is clear from the crusades that what finally overpowered the early Christian teaching against violence was not merely a just war theory but rather a merger of violence and holiness at all levels of Christian life. ... The liturgy was expanded to include the blessing of weapons and standards. Knights were consecrated by ceremonies which were often a revival of old pagan customs.  There were new militant religious orders established such as the Templars who promised to fight the enemies of God in addition to taking the normal vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.  When violence became sacred, the enemy was believed to be diabolical.  Thus the Turks were looked upon as opponents of the kingdom of God, a fulfillment of the forces of the antichrist as predicted in the book of Revelation.</blockquote>\n\nThis view of holiness and violence as merged in Christian thought is supported in Riley-Smith who says the crusades were products of the renewed spirituality of the central Middle Ages, with its concern for living the [[Vita apostolica|''vita apostolica'']] and expressing Christian ideals in active works of charity, exemplified by the new hospitals, the pastoral work of the Augustinians and Premonstratensians, and the service of the friars.

The king was a monarch in distress. He had little control of his fractious nobles in the north, and had absolutely no control over the southern nobles.<ref name=\"Moore2\"/>  He needed a way to channel the aggressive nature in the north and establish dominance in the South. All the men who marched from town to town, burning, killing, raping and looting, were from northern France.  And, under law in the Middle Ages, the lands of defeated barons could be legally confiscated. Moore says the Pope supplied an excuse for something the king wanted anyway.

The mercenaries quickly took advantage of the chaos and followed their retreat, storming the walls of the city that were not yet properly manned. The walls were easily taken, and the mercenaries entered the gate, seemingly without orders from their leaders. The crusader knights, soon realizing that the defenses had been broken, joined the mercenaries in battle, easily overwhelming the town garrison. The mercenaries began  rampaging through the streets, killing and plundering, while those citizens who could run, sought refuge in the churches and cathedrals, but there was no safety from the raging mob of mercenaries.

It included the Episcopal Inquisition (1184\u20131230s) which began when Pope Lucius the third issued a decree through the papal bull ''Ad abolendam,'' and the Papal Inquisition, which started in the 1230s. Canon law was still developing at this time, and it was based on Roman law to such a degree that it can be said the church reintroduced Roman law in Europe in the form of the Inquisition when it seemed that Germanic law had failed.<ref name=\"Monter\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Inquisition, The: The Inquisition In The Old World|author=William Monter|date=April 7, 2020|publisher=Encyclopedia.com| url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/inquisition-inquisition-old-world}}</ref>  In the Late Roman Empire, an inquisitorial system of justice had developed that allowed magistrates to investigate crimes in the absence of formal charges. The roles of evidence collector, prosecutor, and judge were combined in the inquisitor.  This inquisitorial process was in place when the Roman Empire converted to Christianity in the fourth century and it is the system that was revived in the middle ages. As a result, in his decretal of 1199, ''Vergentis in senium'', [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] (1198\u20131216), took the crucial step of combining heresy with the Roman-law doctrine of ''l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9'', thereby accusing heretics of treason against God.<ref name=\"Monter\"/>\n\nThe cultural and religious process of centralizing power included the development, between the tenth to the thirteenth centuries, of a new kind of persecution aimed at minorities who provided much of the fodder for inquisition.<ref name =\"Moore\"/>  For example, Peter Comestor (d.1197) was the first influential scholar to interpret biblical injunctions against sodomy as referring specifically to homosexual intercourse. The Third Lateran council of 1179 then became the first to legislate on it as deserving of being deprived of office or excommunicated.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|87}} The Fourth Lateran council reduced those penalties, but later Gregory IX ordered the Dominicans to extirpate homosexuality from Germany.  A series of legal codes were thereafter promulgated from the 1250s on in Spain, France, Italy and Germany. By 1300, places where sodomy was not a capitol offense had become the exception rather than the rule.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|87}}\n\nThe historian Robert Moore says most complex traditional societies, including those in early and medieval Europe, have always contained some kind of persecution that occurred and subsided and occurred again, but that twelfth century Europe's persecution was more serious because it was characterized by the demonization of the accused, a new attitude, and mechanisms such as new laws, and the inquisitions, a new method.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|154}}\n\n===The Jews===\nIn the centuries after the fall of the Roman empire, Jews established small communities, engaged in commerce, and were seldom singled out as targets of verbal abuse or physical violence.<ref name=\"Berger\">{{cite book|last=Berger|first=D|title=New Perspectives on Jewish-Christian Relations: In Honor of David Berger| year=2012|publisher=Brill|location=Netherlands|isbn=978-9-00422-117-8}}</ref>{{rp|2}}  However, historians agree that the eleventh to the thirteenth century was a turning point in Jewish-Christian relations.<blockquote> \"[[Bernard of Clairvaux]], (1090-1153) pillar of European monasticism and powerful twelfth century preacher, provides a perfect example of a Christian thinker balancing on a precipice, preaching hateful images of Jews at the same time as he sounded Scripture based admonitions that they must be protected despite their nature.<ref name=\"Berger\"/>{{rp|2}}</blockquote> Low level theological repartee had long existed between Jews and Christians. These interchanges attest to neighborly relations as Jew and Christian both struggled to fit \"other\" into their sense of the demands of their faith, and balance the human opponents facing them with the traditions they inherited.<ref name=\"Berger\"/>{{rp|3}} By the thirteenth century that repartee had changed in both tone and quality, growing more polemical.<ref name=\"Berger\"/>{{rp|3-7}} \n\nIn 1215, the [[Fourth Lateran Council]], known as the Great Council, met and accepted 70 canons that reflect Christian thinking as both militant and victorious in tone.<ref name=\"Berger\"/>{{rp|58}} It hammered out a working definition of Christian community, and stated the essentials of membership in it, thereby defining \"other\" within Christian thought for the next three centuries.  The last three canons required Jews to distinguish themselves from Christians in their dress, prohibited them from holding public office, and prohibited Jewish converts from continuing to practice Jewish rituals.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|7}} As Berger has articulated it: \"The other side of a coin of unique toleration was a unique persecution.\"<ref name=\"Berger\"/>{{rp|2}}.

As they learned how the central figures of Christianity were mocked, inquisitors went after the Talmud, and other Jewish writings.<ref name=\"Mundy\"/>{{rp|64}} The Fourth Lateran council, in its 68th canon, placed on the secular authorities the responsibility for obtaining an answer from the Jews to the charge of blasphemy. For the first time in history, Jews had to answer in public trial. There is no consensus in the sources as to who instigated the trial against the Talmud, but in June of 1239, [[Gregory IX]] (1237-1241) issued letters to various Archbishops and Kings across Europe to seize all Jewish books and take them to the Dominicans for examination.  The order was heeded only in Paris where, on June 25th, the Royal court was opened to hear the case. Eventually, each side claimed victory; a final verdict of guilt and condemnation was not announced until May of 1248, but the books had been burned six years before.<ref name=\"Rosenthal\">{{cite journal|last=Rosenthal|first= Judah M.|title=The Talmud on Trial: The Disputation at Paris in the Year 1240|journal= The Jewish Quarterly Review|volume= 47| issue= 1|year= 1956|pages=58\u201376|publisher= JSTOR|doi= 10.2307/1453186|jstor= 1453186}}</ref>{{rp|68-72}}  \n\nAs a result of this trial, the people of Europe thought that, even if they had once had an obligation to preserve the Jews for the sake of the Old Testament, Talmudic Judaism was so different from its biblical sources that the old obligation no longer applied.

They often filled the role of financial agent or manager for the Lords; they and their posessions were considered the property of the King in England; and they were often exempted from taxes and other laws because of the importance of their usury.  This attracted unpopularity, jealousy and resentment.<ref name=\"Moore\"/>{{rp|110}} As J. H.

The unique culture of the High middle ages with its union of the spiritual and the secular began to come apart. Rival European states at war with each other dimmed the church's dream of a united Christendom.  New military weapons and tactics rendered chivalry obsolete.  In the Universities, new intellectual currents moved away from Christian thought, and new secular voices began to be heard. <ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|243,248}}\n\nFrom its pinnacle of power in the 1200s, the church entered a period of decline, internal conflict, and corruption.  Devoted and virtuous nuns and monks become increasingly rare. Monastic reform had been a major force in the High Middle Ages but is largely unknown in the Late Middle ages. This led to the development of lay piety--the ''devotio moderna''--the new devotion, which worked toward the ideal of a pious society of ordinary non-ordained people.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|248-250}}\n\nLeaders who attempted to reform the church in England and Bohemia met strong resistance from the Popes. [[John Wycliffe]] (1320-1384) urged the church to give up ownership of property, which produced much of the church's wealth, and to once again embrace poverty and simplicity. He urged the church to stop being subservient to the state and its politics. He denied papal authority. John Wycliff died of a stroke, but his followers, called ''Lollards,'' were declared heretics.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|249}}  The first large scale attack on the Lollards came the year after the [[Peasant revolt]] of 1381.

These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]]. Anglicans who argued against persecution were: [[John Locke]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jeremy Taylor]],  [[Henry More]], [[John Tillotson]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>This list is taken from: Coffey (2000), 50</ref>\n\nAll of these considered themselves Christians or were actual churchmen.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions.

It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

His research is supported by the Nazis, since he professes to be looking for evidence of the [[Aryan]] origins of German civilisation.\n\nHowever, he has a secret agenda: to free inmates of the concentration camps. During one such daring rescue, he hides disguised as a [[scarecrow]] in a field and is inadvertently shot by a German soldier idly engaging in a bit of target practice. Wounded, he still manages to free a celebrated pianist from a work gang. Later, his students guess his secret when they see his injury and connect it to a story about the latter-day [[The Scarlet Pimpernel|Scarlet Pimpernel]] in a newspaper. They enthusiastically volunteer to assist him.\n\nGerman [[Gestapo]] general von Graum (Francis Sullivan) is determined to find out the identity of the \"Pimpernel\" and eliminate him. Von Graum forces Ludmilla Koslowska (Mary Morris) to help him by threatening the life of her father, a leading Polish democrat held prisoner by the Nazis. When Smith finds out, he promises her he will free Koslowski.\n\nSmith and his students, masquerading as American journalists, visit the camp in which Koslowski is being held. They overpower their escort, put on their uniforms, and leave with Koslowski and some other inmates. By now, von Graum is sure Smith is the man he is after, so he stops the train transporting the professor and various packing crates out of the country. However, when he has the crates opened, he is disappointed to find only ancient artefacts from Smith's excavations.\n\nVon Graum still has Ludmilla, so Smith comes back for her. The general catches the couple at a border crossing. The Nazis are not even interested in Ludmilla, happy to have caught Smith. Smith tells Graum that the artefacts he has discovered disprove Nazi claims about the Aryan origins of the Germans. He predicts the Nazis will destroy themselves. In the end, Smith manages to distract his adversary and escape into the fog, but promises to come back.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] as Professor Horatio Smith{{#tag:ref|Professor Smith is also addressed as \"Horace\" Smith in the film.|group=Note}}\n*[[Francis L.

His research is supported by the Nazis, since he professes to be looking for evidence of the [[Aryan]] origins of German civilisation.\n\nHowever, he has a secret agenda: to free inmates of the concentration camps. During one such daring rescue, he hides disguised as a [[scarecrow]] in a field and is inadvertently shot by a German soldier idly engaging in a bit of target practice. Wounded, he still manages to free a celebrated pianist from a work gang. Later, his students guess his secret when they see his injury and connect it to a story about the latter-day [[The Scarlet Pimpernel|Scarlet Pimpernel]] in a newspaper. They enthusiastically volunteer to assist him.\n\nGerman [[Gestapo]] general von Graum (Francis Sullivan) is determined to find out the identity of the \"Pimpernel\" and eliminate him. Von Graum forces Ludmilla Koslowska (Mary Morris) to help him by threatening the life of her father, a leading Polish democrat held prisoner by the Nazis. When Smith finds out, he promises her he will free Koslowski.\n\nSmith and his students, masquerading as American journalists, visit the camp in which Koslowski is being held. They overpower their escort, put on their uniforms, and leave with Koslowski and some other inmates. By now, von Graum is sure Smith is the man he is after, so he stops the train transporting the professor and various packing crates out of the country. However, when he has the crates opened, he is disappointed to find only ancient artefacts from Smith's excavations.\n\nVon Graum still has Ludmilla, so Smith comes back for her. The general catches the couple at a border crossing. The Nazis are not even interested in Ludmilla, happy to have caught Smith. Smith tells Graum that the artefacts he has discovered disprove Nazi claims about the Aryan origins of the Germans. He predicts the Nazis will destroy themselves. In the end, Smith manages to distract his adversary and escape into the fog, but promises to come back.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] as Professor Horatio Smith{{#tag:ref|Professor Smith is also addressed as \"Horace\" Smith in the film.|group=Note}}\n*[[Francis L.

Wallace is one of the few criminals Goren encounters who is able to outwit him and even get to him emotionally, particularly by confronting him about his unhappy childhood. Goren comes to think of her as his \"[[Moby Dick|white whale]]\".<ref name=\"Frame\"/> When Wallace murders his brother Frank, Goren is convinced that she is trying to destroy him at last; it turns out, however, that she was manipulated and murdered by the true mastermind of the plot - his old mentor, Declan Gage.<ref name=\"Frame\"/>\n\nIn the episode \"[[Untethered (Law & Order: Criminal Intent)|Untethered]]\", Goren, on his own, goes undercover at an abusive prison where his nephew Donny ([[Trevor Morgan (actor)|Trevor Morgan]]) is incarcerated; he is then suspended and sent for a psychological fitness evaluation.<ref name=\"Untethered\"/> While waiting for his reinstatement, Goren decides to go undercover to take down a high-level drug dealer, but does not inform Eames of this decision, causing tension between them.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Purgatory|episodelink=Purgatory (Law & Order: Criminal Intent)|series=Law & Order: Criminal Intent|serieslink=Law & Order: Criminal Intent|network=NBC|airdate= June 8, 2008|season=7|number=11}}</ref>\n\nIn the two-part season 9 premiere \"[[Loyalty (Law & Order: Criminal Intent)|Loyalty]],\" he and Eames are pulled off a pair of homicides by Capt.

When Ross is subsequently murdered, Goren and Eames team up with Detectives [[Zack Nichols]] ([[Jeff Goldblum]]) and [[List of Law & Order: Criminal Intent characters#Serena Stevens|Serena Stevens]] ([[Saffron Burrows]]) to find his killer. Goren soon gets into a physical altercation with the prime suspect, leading to his suspension, though Eames and Nichols covertly help him with his side investigation. By the end of \"Loyalty\", Eames is promoted to Lieutenant and assigned as Captain (''pro tem'', pending her Captain's exams) of the Major Case Squad. Her first assignment is to fire Goren, upon which he tells her not to worry, kisses her on the cheek and they share an embrace before he leaves. Eames then places her own gun and badge on her new desk and calls the Chief to resign from the force.

Reddington surrenders to the FBI and offers to identify and help capture the criminals he has worked with, whom he calls \"The Blacklist,\" but only if he is allowed to work with Liz Keen, a rookie profiler at the FBI.  He refuses to explain why Liz must be involved.  The Reddington Task Force, led by Assistant Director Harold Cooper ([[Harry Lennix]]), becomes the lead law enforcement agency responsible for capturing or killing the members of the Blacklist at Reddington's behest (usually to Red's benefit), which causes conflicts particularly for Special Agent Donald Ressler ([[Diego Klattenhoff]]), who was originally tasked with capturing Reddington.  This is the only season for Meera Malik ([[Parminder Nagra]]), a CIA officer and member of the Task Force, who is killed in the season finale.  The season also introduces antagonist Milos Kirchoff ([[Peter Stormare]]), AKA Berlin, a former Russian KGB officer with a longstanding hatred of Reddington.  A major subplot for the season is Elizabeth Keen's discovery that her husband Tom Keen ([[Ryan Eggold]]), a schoolteacher to all appearances, is actually a covert operative with an unknown agenda and Liz's efforts to discover who he actually is and who sent him.  A second subplot involves the Cabal, a shadowy multinational group that holds positions of influence in government and business, and their interest in Reddington's activities.  The Cabal is usually represented by Alan Fitch ([[Alan Alda]]), the Deputy Director of National Intelligence, who tries to maintain a civil relationship with Reddington despite the Cabal's misgivings while trying to determine what Reddington actually knows.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of The Blacklist characters}}\n\n===Main cast===\n* [[James Spader]] as [[List of The Blacklist characters#Raymond .22Red.22 Reddington|Raymond \"Red\" Reddington]]\n* [[Megan Boone]] as [[List of The Blacklist characters#FBI Special Agent Elizabeth Keen|FBI Special Agent Elizabeth Keen]]\n* [[Diego Klattenhoff]] as [[List of The Blacklist characters#FBI Special Agent Donald Ressler|FBI Special Agent Donald Ressler]]\n* [[Ryan Eggold]] as [[List of The Blacklist characters#Tom Keen|Tom Keen]]\n* [[Harry Lennix]] as [[List of The Blacklist characters#Harold Cooper|FBI Assistant Director Harold Cooper]]\n* [[Parminder Nagra]] as [[List of The Blacklist characters#CIA Agent Meera Malik|Meera Malik]]\n\n===Recurring cast===\n* [[Amir Arison]] as [[List of The Blacklist characters#Aram Mojtabai|Aram Mojtabai]], a quirky and skilled technician who regularly assists the FBI.\n* [[Charles Baker (actor)|Charles Baker]] as Grey (Newton Phillips), Red's aide.\n* [[Hisham Tawfiq]] as Dembe Zuma, Red's trusted bodyguard.\n* Deborah S.

Furthermore, Zamani breaks into Elizabeth's house and stabs her husband Tom (Eggold). As Tom recovers, Zamani meets with Red and informs him of Tom's injury, which Red apparently ordered. The meeting turns out to be a setup, and Agent Donald Ressler (Klattenhoff) kills Zamani. Elizabeth realises that Zamani intends to detonate a chemical bomb strapped to Ryker's daughter. Elizabeth finds the girl in a zoo, and Red sends an associate to disarm the device. Red then reveals that he has [[military intelligence|intelligence]] to help the FBI find unknown threats he has compiled on a \"blacklist\" gathered over the years.

The two attend one of Campo's charity events where Red identifies the Freelancer, whom Ressler apprehends. The Freelancer confesses that he is just a decoy Red hired to poison Campo. It is revealed that Red knew Campo was a fraud; she is actually running a sex slavery ring and uses the charity to eliminate competition. Meanwhile, as part of Red's [[Witness immunity|immunity]] agreement, CIA agent Meera Malik (Nagra) is assigned to his security detail.

The entire FBI team is under investigation as internal affairs tries to find the mole. Aram is initially suspected, but Red is able to prove he was set up. Meanwhile, a serial killer from Liz's past, \"The Good Samaritan\" (guest star [[Frank Whaley]]), strikes again. Elizabeth is allowed to join the hunt for the killer, as Cooper knows Red will likely realize how much this unsolved case means to Elizabeth and reach out to help her. Soon Elizabeth discovers the victims are all linked through abusing a family member, and that the killer was likely an abuse victim himself. Though she finally kills the Good Samaritan, she gives the man's final near-victim (guest star [[Frank Pando]]) a warning to treat his wife better or she'll make him regret hurting her. Red confronts a financier named Henry Krueger ([[Victor Slezak]]) for betraying him and shoots him, forcing the wounded Kreuger to give up the name Newton Phillips, who is in fact Red's aide. Red later confronts Phillips for leaking his location to Garrick and kills him via suffocation even though he asked him to make it look like an accident. Red then visits Elizabeth to tell her that \"his house is clean\" now, but hers isn't, explaining that Phillips couldn't have pulled this off by himself and that there's another mole inside the unit.\n |LineColor       = DFE4E1\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Blacklist (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 12\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 12\n |Title           = [[The Alchemist (The Blacklist)|The Alchemist]]\n |Aux1            = No. 101\n |DirectedBy      = Vince Misiano\n |WrittenBy       = [[Anthony Sparks]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2014|1|20}}\n |Viewers         = 8.83<ref name=S01E12>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/01/22/monday-final-tv-ratings-how-i-met-your-mother-adjusted-up-beauty-the-beast-adjusted-down-final-sleepy-hollow-numbers/231083|title=Monday Final TV Ratings: 'How I Met Your Mother' Adjusted Up, 'Beauty & the Beast' Adjusted Down & Final 'Sleepy Hollow' Numbers|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Bibel|first=Sara|date=January 22, 2014|accessdate=January 22, 2014}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Red informs the team that \"The Alchemist\" (guest star [[Ryan O'Nan]]), a man who relies upon science to transform a person's DNA and their appearance into someone else's, has been contracted to protect a well-known mob informant and his wife.

Meanwhile Elizabeth and Tom find themselves at another bump in their relationship and Ressler debates whether or not he should give his ex-fiancee his blessing.

Ultimately, the task force discovers the Cyprus Agency's secret: it kidnaps young women and keeps them in captivity as breeders for the babies it puts up for adoption, and that Mallory is the father of all the children. Meanwhile, Meera willingly aids Red in his investigation for the mole. Covertly using Cooper's badge, Meera's intelligence leads Red to Diane Fowler as the ringleader of the leak, prompting him to kill Fowler in her own home. She tells him that she knows about \"that day\", about what happened to his family. But Red still kills her, responding that he wants to know it more than anything in the world, but if she knows, someone else does also. He then calls Mr. Kaplan to clean up.

The statue secretly contains coordinates for [[Soviet]] nuclear detonation codes, which has the interest of the [[Russian Mob]].  Red enlists Elizabeth's aid in the operation, with her posing as a grifter and an associate of Red's, only for the pair to be double-crossed by Pratt. Faking their capture, Red succeeds in getting the location of the Effigy and the coordinates from Pratt. The statue is secured and one of Pratt's allies is arrested. Pratt is able to free herself and steals a precious painting from Red.

Red gets Elizabeth going on that case, then tackles his own agenda in wanting to find out about the past of Lucy Brooks. Lucy, as it turns out, is Jolene, the woman seducing Tom at a teacher conference in Orlando. As Elizabeth works the case of The Judge (revealed to be a woman named Ruth Kipling, played by [[Dianne Wiest]]), a man named Alan Ray Rifkin is about to be executed for treason, and it is discovered that Cooper is the Federal agent who put him away. Cooper becomes The Judge's next target and is nearly electrocuted, until Red arrives with proof that Rifkin really did commit the crimes for which he was executed. Cooper is released, The Judge is apprehended, and later sent to prison. When Cooper suggests Red brought him this case to gain leverage on him, Red replies that \"a war is coming\", and he may need Cooper's help.

After another FBI agent turns up dead in America, Ressler fears he may be next, as he was part of the team searching for Red back then. He grabs Audrey and attempts to take her somewhere safe, but his car is rammed by Tanida's driver. In the ensuing melee, Tanida shoots and kills Audrey. Ressler vows to take out Tanida, despite warnings from Cooper and Red to let other agents take it from here. Collaborating with an old FBI buddy named Bobby Jonica who was also on that task force, Ressler locates Tanida, but later learns that Bobby is the mysterious \"Tensei\"\u2014the man who took over Tanida's crime operation while the latter was in prison. Bobby murdered Mako's brother, Aiko, and covered up his death in order to steal his identity.

Reddington initially believes an elusive Russian hacker named Ivan ([[Mark Ivanir]]) was responsible for the theft, but a personal meeting with him reveals that Ivan never had any problems with the United States and is solely focused on the Russian government. Ivan claims that someone else has been masquerading as him. Further investigation into Ivan's claims leads the task force to high school student Harrison Lee, who was responsible for the theft of the Skeleton Key. Lee stole the key and used it to begin a romantic relationship with the daughter of one of the Skeleton Key scientists.

They manage to arrest the doctor and let Bobbit commit suicide. In Cooper's office, Red has a look at Bobbit's client list, which seems to matter a lot to him. Meanwhile, Tom proposes that he and Elizabeth renew their marriage vows, given all they've been through, and has his brother Craig ([[Peter Scanavino]]) officiate the ceremony. Craig pulls Tom aside and says he's certain Elizabeth knows the truth about him, but Tom isn't convinced. In their new safe house, Elizabeth demands answers from Red regarding Tom as well as Red's interest in her, but all Red will say is that he's watched her closely ever since Tom came into her life. After Red gets some DNA results on Tom, he determines that Craig (real name \"Christopher\") is not Tom's brother. Elizabeth traps Chris in his hotel room and tries to get answers. Tom calls Chris while Elizabeth, Red and Dembe are in the room, and mentions \"Berlin\". Red demands to know what's in Berlin, but a frightened-looking Chris says he cannot say anything. After Red threatens that he'll find a way to make him talk, Chris hurls himself through the hotel room's window, falling to his death, after which Tom attempts to convince Liz that Craig had to fly home.

Elizabeth views the photos that Tom had led her to, which show Red at the hospital where her adoptive father Sam had died. She confronts Red about it, but he steers her toward the more urgent matter of The Kingmaker being in the U.S. Elizabeth and the team are able to uncover a plot by The Kingmaker to run the car of a New York Congressman off a bridge, making him look like a hero by saving his family. This puts him in the best position to win a special election for a Senate seat, which The Kingmaker vacates by killing the senator.

Red tries to explain to her that the outbreak is connected to Tom, and asks if her anger towards him (Red) is more important than putting lives at risk. Elizabeth agrees to work on the case but declares it will be her last. Red is certain that the Cullen virus is part of a plan to kill him, as well as being capable of creating a widespread epidemic. Red and Elizabeth meet with Dr. Sanders ([[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]]), an expert on the virus, who is also a mental patient. The conversation gets loony when Dr. Sanders speaks of Space Agent UD-4126 and omens of the Cullen virus leading to the apocalypse. Elizabeth storms out, accusing Red of using the visit as a diversion to change her mind about quitting. Meanwhile, Cooper is given an ultimatum by his superiors: if Elizabeth walks, Red no longer has immunity and the task force is no more. Elizabeth learns that Dr. Sanders had created an antidote for the virus and the team suspects that he was working with another doctor from outside the mental institution. Elizabeth pays Dr. Sanders another visit and notices the nurse's ID badge number, UD-4126. This leads to one Dr. Nikolaus Vogel ([[Brennan Brown]]). Once he's arrested, he refuses to talk to Elizabeth except to warn her about Berlin's coming. Elizabeth had laced his drinking water with the virus, and uses the antidote to blackmail him into talking. Using Tom's code book\u2014which Red had given her earlier as an \"[[olive branch]]\"\u2014Elizabeth discovers connections among several members of Red's Blacklist, deciphering that he knew someone was targeting his interests, but not specifically who it is. He's been using his relationship with the FBI task force to systematically eliminate his enemies and draw Berlin out of hiding. Dr. Vogel gives up the names of 5 people involved in a prison plane transport, all airport employees infected with Cullen. Elizabeth begins to have a change of heart about leaving, but Cooper tells her it's too late. She finds Red and warns him about the FBI's pursuit and his immunity. She begs him to run, but he refuses, asking about her sudden change of heart. Elizabeth goes on to tell him how much she wants to kill him for ruining her life, but that she also needs answers from him. He tells her that he needs things from her also, and that nothing is worse than losing her. It becomes apparent to both that they are stuck with each other.

A guard ([[Peter Stormare]]) who was severely injured in the crash is questioned in the hospital, and tells a story of a man in prison whose enemy sent him parts of his dead daughter, one by one, until he managed to escape. Fitch meets with Red, saying that his organization has finally agreed to join forces with Red against Berlin, and he arranges to give Red an opportunity to escape from FBI custody. Red meets with Elizabeth and they continue to try to find Berlin. Red encounters a man ([[Andrew Howard]]) believed to be Berlin and tortures him for information. Tom ambushes Elizabeth in her car and drags her into the room with a gun pointed to her head, imploring Red to give himself up. Red kills \"Berlin\" and inches closer to Tom. Tom shoots Red in the shoulder, prompting Liz to break free. Elizabeth and Tom scuffle and he is shot by her. With his dying breath, Tom whispers something to Elizabeth. Red says that he realized the man he had just tortured and killed was not Berlin, who is instead revealed to be the injured guard the FBI questioned in the hospital. As Cooper recovers under Ressler's watch, Elizabeth and Ressler discover that Berlin escaped and is at large. When agents investigate the room where the bodies of Tom and the fake Berlin should be, Tom's body is gone. Liz meets with Red and says that Tom told her that her father is alive. Red assures Elizabeth that her father definitely died in a fire. Berlin walks the streets carrying a pocket watch with the picture of a little girl, with Red concurrently carrying the same picture that he recovered from the Stewmaker. The season ends with Red removing his shirt to treat his bullet wound, revealing burn scars on his back.\n |LineColor       = DFE4E1\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Reception==\nThe first season of ''The Blacklist'' received strong reviews from television critics.

Reddington surrenders to the FBI and offers to identify and help capture the criminals he has worked with, whom he calls \"The Blacklist,\" but only if he is allowed to work with Liz Keen, a rookie profiler at the FBI.  He refuses to explain why Liz must be involved.  The Reddington Task Force, led by Assistant Director Harold Cooper ([[Harry Lennix]]), becomes the lead law enforcement agency responsible for capturing or killing the members of the Blacklist at Reddington's behest (usually to Red's benefit), which causes conflicts particularly for Special Agent Donald Ressler ([[Diego Klattenhoff]]), who was originally tasked with capturing Reddington.  This is the only season for Meera Malik ([[Parminder Nagra]]), a CIA officer and member of the Task Force, who is killed in the season finale.  The season also introduces antagonist Milos Kirchoff ([[Peter Stormare]]), AKA Berlin, a former Russian KGB officer with a longstanding hatred of Reddington.  A major subplot for the season is Elizabeth Keen's discovery that her husband Tom Keen ([[Ryan Eggold]]), a schoolteacher to all appearances, is actually a covert operative with an unknown agenda and Liz's efforts to discover who he actually is and who sent him.  A second subplot involves the The Cabal, a shadowy multinational group that holds positions of influence in government and business, and their interest in Reddington's activities.  The Cabal is usually represented by Alan Fitch ([[Alan Alda]]), the Deputy Director of National Intelligence, who tries to maintain a civil relationship with Reddington despite the Cabal's misgivings while trying to determine what Reddington actually knows.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of The Blacklist characters}}\n\n===Main cast===\n* [[James Spader]] as [[List of The Blacklist characters#Raymond .22Red.22 Reddington|Raymond \"Red\" Reddington]]\n* [[Megan Boone]] as [[List of The Blacklist characters#FBI Special Agent Elizabeth Keen|FBI Special Agent Elizabeth Keen]]\n* [[Diego Klattenhoff]] as [[List of The Blacklist characters#FBI Special Agent Donald Ressler|FBI Special Agent Donald Ressler]]\n* [[Ryan Eggold]] as [[List of The Blacklist characters#Tom Keen|Tom Keen]]\n* [[Harry Lennix]] as [[List of The Blacklist characters#Harold Cooper|FBI Assistant Director Harold Cooper]]\n* [[Parminder Nagra]] as [[List of The Blacklist characters#CIA Agent Meera Malik|Meera Malik]]\n\n===Recurring cast===\n* [[Amir Arison]] as [[List of The Blacklist characters#Aram Mojtabai|Aram Mojtabai]], a quirky and skilled technician who regularly assists the FBI.\n* [[Charles Baker (actor)|Charles Baker]] as Grey (Newton Phillips), Red's aide.\n* [[Hisham Tawfiq]] as Dembe Zuma, Red's trusted bodyguard.\n* Deborah S.

After being informed that Zamani intends to kidnap the daughter of General Daniel Ryker ([[Chance Kelly]]), Elizabeth picks her up, only for her convoy to be ambushed and the girl taken. Furthermore, Zamani breaks into Elizabeth's house and stabs her husband Tom (Eggold). As Tom recovers, Zamani meets with Red and informs him of Tom's injury, which Red apparently ordered. The meeting turns out to be a setup, and Agent Donald Ressler (Klattenhoff) kills Zamani. Elizabeth realises that Zamani intends to detonate a chemical bomb strapped to Ryker's daughter. Elizabeth finds the girl in a zoo, and Red sends an associate to disarm the device.

Red gets Elizabeth going on that case, then tackles his own agenda in wanting to find out about the past of Lucy Brooks. Lucy, as it turns out, is Jolene, the woman seducing Tom at a teacher conference in Orlando. As Elizabeth works the case of The Judge (revealed to be a woman named Ruth Kipling, played by [[Dianne Wiest]]), a man named Alan Ray Rifkin is about to be executed for treason, and it is discovered that Cooper is the Federal agent who put him away. Cooper becomes The Judge's next target and is nearly electrocuted, until Red arrives with proof that Rifkin really did commit the crimes for which he was executed. Cooper is released, The Judge is apprehended, and later sent to prison. When Cooper suggests Red brought him this case to gain leverage on him, Red replies that \"a war is coming\", and he may need Cooper's help. Back in Orlando, Tom declines \"Jolene's\" offer of an affair, proclaiming his love for Elizabeth.

After another FBI agent turns up dead in America, Ressler fears he may be next, as he was part of the team searching for Red back then. He grabs Audrey and attempts to take her somewhere safe, but his car is rammed by Tanida's driver. In the ensuing melee, Tanida shoots and kills Audrey. Ressler vows to take out Tanida, despite warnings from Cooper and Red to let other agents take it from here. Collaborating with an old FBI buddy named Bobby Jonica who was also on that task force, Ressler locates Tanida, but later learns that Bobby is the mysterious \"Tensei\"\u2014the man who took over Tanida's crime operation while the latter was in prison. Bobby murdered Mako's brother, Aiko, and covered up his death in order to steal his identity. Lucy/Jolene announces plans to move in next to Tom and Elizabeth, but Tom later meets Lucy in a hideout and the two discuss mutual, though possibly conflicting, plans to get to Red in order to provide an unknown entity named \"Berlin\" with answers. Tom convinces Lucy to call Liz and tell her the moving plan has been called off; then he kills Jolene and her assailant. Ressler attempts to coerce Bobby into committing suicide before being stopped by Elizabeth, though Bobby ultimately does kill himself. Later at home, Ressler receives a gift from Reddington: a box containing Tanida's severed head.

While investigating the programmer's death, the task force learns that the NSA's [[Tailored Access Operations]] unit was working on a prototype device called the \"Skeleton Key\", capable of hacking into the entire American electronics infrastructure. Reddington initially believes an elusive Russian hacker named Ivan ([[Mark Ivanir]]) was responsible for the theft, but a personal meeting with him reveals that Ivan never had any problems with the United States and is solely focused on the Russian government. Ivan claims that someone else has been masquerading as him. Further investigation into Ivan's claims leads the task force to high school student Harrison Lee, who was responsible for the theft of the Skeleton Key. Lee stole the key and used it to begin a romantic relationship with the daughter of one of the Skeleton Key scientists. Elizabeth investigates the disappearance of Jolene/Lucy after being approached by Lucy's former parole officer. Elizabeth discovers Tom's makeshift headquarters after Aram traces the origin of Lucy's last voice message, but Tom has just torn down and burned all photos of Red and Elizabeth.

Finally understanding Red's repeated warnings about Tom and upset by the recent revelation, Elizabeth turns to Red for emotional support.

The murder victims are ultimately discovered to all be part of a clinical drug trial for type 2 diabetes that caused people to die, and Bobbit himself is found to be terminal. Elizabeth, Ressler and the team must catch up with Bobbit before he himself takes out the next victim: the doctor who headed up the trial. They manage to arrest the doctor and let Bobbit commit suicide. In Cooper's office, Red has a look at Bobbit's client list, which seems to matter a lot to him. Meanwhile, Tom proposes that he and Elizabeth renew their marriage vows, given all they've been through, and has his brother Craig ([[Peter Scanavino]]) officiate the ceremony. Craig pulls Tom aside and says he's certain Elizabeth knows the truth about him, but Tom isn't convinced. In their new safe house, Elizabeth demands answers from Red regarding Tom as well as Red's interest in her, but all Red will say is that he's watched her closely ever since Tom came into her life. After Red gets some DNA results on Tom, he determines that Craig (real name \"Christopher\") is not Tom's brother. Elizabeth traps Chris in his hotel room and tries to get answers. Tom calls Chris while Elizabeth, Red and Dembe are in the room, and mentions \"Berlin\". Red demands to know what's in Berlin, but a frightened-looking Chris says he cannot say anything. After Red threatens that he'll find a way to make him talk, Chris hurls himself through the hotel room's window, falling to his death, after which Tom attempts to convince Liz that Craig had to fly home. Elizabeth has her own hideout where she watches surveillance footage of herself and Tom which Red gave her.

Red is seen meeting with an ally about the Prague matter, and the man tells him that the recent news of a siege on Red's interests is causing several key people to start distancing themselves. Elizabeth views the photos that Tom had led her to, which show Red at the hospital where her adoptive father Sam had died. She confronts Red about it, but he steers her toward the more urgent matter of The Kingmaker being in the U.S. Elizabeth and the team are able to uncover a plot by The Kingmaker to run the car of a New York Congressman off a bridge, making him look like a hero by saving his family. This puts him in the best position to win a special election for a Senate seat, which The Kingmaker vacates by killing the senator. Alarms go off in the home where the murder is committed, with Ressler and Liz entering the home. The Kingmaker attacks and chokes Elizabeth before being fatally shot by Ressler. Red meets with Fitch, telling him his businesses are under attack and suggesting it's a mutual problem and that they should cooperate against their common enemy. Fitch meets with members of his global alliance, then tells Red they have chosen not to ally themselves with him despite Red's threats to expose them. Elizabeth phones Red to inform him about The Kingmaker. Red says he wants 10 minutes with the man to find out who ordered the Prague incident, but Liz has to tell him that The Kingmaker is dead.

In the midst of a virus outbreak inside a bank, Elizabeth refuses to work with Red and sends Cooper her resignation, informing him that Red killed her father. Red tries to explain to her that the outbreak is connected to Tom, and asks if her anger towards him (Red) is more important than putting lives at risk. Elizabeth agrees to work on the case but declares it will be her last. Red is certain that the Cullen virus is part of a plan to kill him, as well as being capable of creating a widespread epidemic. Red and Elizabeth meet with Dr. Sanders ([[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]]), an expert on the virus, who is also a mental patient. The conversation gets loony when Dr. Sanders speaks of Space Agent UD-4126 and omens of the Cullen virus leading to the apocalypse. Elizabeth storms out, accusing Red of using the visit as a diversion to change her mind about quitting. Meanwhile, Cooper is given an ultimatum by his superiors: if Elizabeth walks, Red no longer has immunity and the task force is no more. Elizabeth learns that Dr. Sanders had created an antidote for the virus and the team suspects that he was working with another doctor from outside the mental institution. Elizabeth pays Dr. Sanders another visit and notices the nurse's ID badge number, UD-4126. This leads to one Dr. Nikolaus Vogel ([[Brennan Brown]]). Once he's arrested, he refuses to talk to Elizabeth except to warn her about Berlin's coming. Elizabeth had laced his drinking water with the virus, and uses the antidote to blackmail him into talking. Using Tom's code book\u2014which Red had given her earlier as an \"[[olive branch]]\"\u2014Elizabeth discovers connections among several members of Red's Blacklist, deciphering that he knew someone was targeting his interests, but not specifically who it is. He's been using his relationship with the FBI task force to systematically eliminate his enemies and draw Berlin out of hiding. Dr. Vogel gives up the names of 5 people involved in a prison plane transport, all airport employees infected with Cullen. Elizabeth begins to have a change of heart about leaving, but Cooper tells her it's too late. She finds Red and warns him about the FBI's pursuit and his immunity. She begs him to run, but he refuses, asking about her sudden change of heart. Elizabeth goes on to tell him how much she wants to kill him for ruining her life, but that she also needs answers from him. He tells her that he needs things from her also, and that nothing is worse than losing her. It becomes apparent to both that they are stuck with each other.

Fitch meets with Red, saying that his organization has finally agreed to join forces with Red against Berlin, and he arranges to give Red an opportunity to escape from FBI custody. Red meets with Elizabeth and they continue to try to find Berlin. Red encounters a man ([[Andrew Howard]]) believed to be Berlin and tortures him for information.

Tom shoots Red in the shoulder, prompting Liz to break free. Elizabeth and Tom scuffle and he is shot by her. With his dying breath, Tom whispers something to Elizabeth. Red says that he realized the man he had just tortured and killed was not Berlin, who is instead revealed to be the injured guard the FBI questioned in the hospital.
