The vast majority of the artists who had signed to Blackwell's fledgling label while he was in Jamaica agreed to allow the musical entrepreneur to release their music in the UK. While in England, Blackwell travelled throughout the city carrying his stock with him and sold to record stores in the city. He did not provide any copies to radio stations, as they would not play any of the Island music; the music was also not reviewed by the press.<ref name=\"Full\" /> Meanwhile, Goodall left to start the [[Doctor Bird (label)|Doctor Bird]] record label in 1965.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11340584/Graeme-Goodall-obituary.html|title=Graeme Goodall - obituary|date=2015|access-date=2017-12-30|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\nBlackwell signed the [[Spencer Davis Group]] to the label (at that time, many Island releases were being distributed by [[Philips Records|Philips]]/[[Fontana Records|Fontana]]). The group became very popular and Island started their own independent series to spotlight UK rock talent. They signed artists such as [[John Martyn]], [[Fairport Convention]], [[Free (band)|Free]], and greatly influenced the growing [[FM radio]] market. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, they were a major label in England with artists including [[Roxy Music]], [[King Crimson]], [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]], [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], [[Bob Marley and the Wailers|The Wailers]], [[Cat Stevens]], [[Steve Winwood]] and many others.  (In the US, many of their releases were issued on A&M prior to Island signing up an unsuccessful distribution deal with Capitol. After that failed, Island was largely an independently distributed label in the US.)\n\nFor [[Toots and the Maytals]], the group that introduced the term \"[[reggae]]\" in song with their 1968 single \"[[Do the Reggay]]\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/reggae |title=reggae |publisher=Dictionary.com Unabridged.

Blackwell had signed [[Bob Marley]], and now Toots and the Maytals. In November 2016, Jackie Jackson described the formation of the group in a radio interview for Kool 97 FM Jamaica.<ref name=\":1\">[http://www.kool97fm.com T interview with Jackie Jackson, Paul Douglas, and Radcliffe \"Dougie\" Bryan].

First it was Toots and the Maytals, three guys: [[Toots Hibbert|Toots]], Raleigh, and Jerry. ... And then they were signed to Island Records, Chris Blackwell. And we were their recording band. One day we were summoned to Chris' house. And he says, \"Alright gentleman, I think it's time. This Toots and the Maytals looks like it's going to be a big thing\". By this time he had already signed Bob (Marley). So in his camp, Island Records, there was Toots and the Maytals]/ the late Bob Marley; we were talking about reggae is going international now.  We kept on meeting and he (Blackwell) decided that the backing band that back all of the songs, the recording band, should be the Maytals band.  So everything came under Toots and the Maytals. So we became Maytals also. And then we hit the road in 1975 ... we were the opening act for the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], and [[Jackson Browne]].

Bob Marley's 1981 death was detrimental to the company, especially after its having engineered Marley's international breakthrough only a few years earlier, while Irish rock band [[U2]], which had signed to Island in March 1980, was growing in popularity, but had not yet reached the international superstar status that was to come. In 1981, Blackwell also used the label to finance a new film production and distribution company, producing the film ''[[Countryman (film)|Countryman]]''.<ref name=IA>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|page=1|date=September 20, 1985|last=Greenberg|first=James|title=Island And Alive Dissolving Joint Prod'n Venture}}</ref> In 1982, [[Paul Morley]] and producer [[Trevor Horn]] started the [[ZTT]] label under the Island banner and Blackwell was known to approve excessive spending by the label.<ref name=\"May\" /> Morley recalls in a 2009 book about Island Records:\n\n<blockquote>I eventually grew to appreciate how Chris Blackwell, and therefore Island Records, was not about one thing, or one style, or one system, or one way of doing things ... [I began] reflecting how the world functions and reinvents itself precisely because it is a fluid, sometimes dangerous, always exhilarating union of systems and beliefs and the best way of allowing the world to progress is to mix up and place in glorious conflict these various systems and beliefs.<ref name=\"Cool\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn 1983, the film production company formed a partnership with [[Shep Gordon]]'s Alive Enterprises to form Island Alive and had success with ''[[Kiss of the Spider Woman (film)|Kiss of the Spider Woman]]'', ''[[Koyaanisqatsi]]'', and ''[[Stop Making Sense]]''.<ref name=IA/> The partnership was dissolved in 1985.<ref name=IA/> In August 1987, the company was not able to pay a US$5 million sum that it owed to U2 in royalties for ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' album, as it had diverted the funds to finance several unsuccessful films. U2 responded by negotiating a deal whereby they invested the unpaid royalties into the company in exchange for a stake in the company that was estimated to be around 10 per cent.<ref>{{Cite book | last = McGee | first = Matt | title = U2:A Diary | publisher = Omnibus Press | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-84772-108-2}}</ref>\n\nThe label's [[4th & Broadway]] division, operating since the mid-1980s, achieved some success marketing alternative [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and dance-pop music with artists such as [[Eric B. & Rakim|Eric B. and Rakim]] and the [[Stereo MCs]].

The exhibition contained 800 prints showcasing the work for Island of the photographers Adrian Boot, [[Jean-Paul Goude]], [[Anton Corbijn]], [[Gered Mankowitz]], [[Keith Morris (photographer)|Keith Morris]] and Brian Cooke, and the London exhibition also featured live performances at the Vinyl Factory Gallery by [[DJ Shadow]] and [[PJ Harvey]].\n\n===Into Island's sixth decade: 2009\u20132017===\nFollowing its 50th anniversary in 2009, Island Records entered its sixth decade on a tide of optimism. The years that followed saw fresh success for a number of established acts, including [[PJ Harvey]], [[Keane (band)|Keane]], [[Paul Weller]] and [[Bombay Bicycle Club]] and an exciting wave of new signings. In its largest live production since its 2009 anniversary, the label also staged a concert by [[The Weeknd]] and [[Jack Garratt]] on [[Osea Island]], a small island in [[Essex]], as part of a bespoke one-day festival for 400 guests, including label staff, media and 200 fans who obtained tickets via a ballot.\n\n2016 proved a particularly successful year for the label in the UK: over a seven-week period between April and June, four separate Island acts spent at least one week at number one. The albums concerned were [[PJ Harvey]]'s ''[[The Hope Six Demolition Project]]'', [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]]'s ''[[Views (album)|Views]]'' (which spent two weeks at number one), [[Ariana Grande]]'s ''[[Dangerous Woman]]'' and [[Catfish and the Bottlemen|Catfish & The Bottlemen's]] ''[[The Ride (Catfish and the Bottlemen album)|The Ride]]''.\n\n====Island's sixth decade: the artists====\n[[PJ Harvey]]'s eighth studio album, 2011's ''[[Let England Shake]]'', was one of the key records of Island's sixth decade. Made in a cliff-top church in [[Dorset]], it won the 2011 [[Mercury Music Prize]], making Harvey the only artist to land the prestigious award twice (she had prevailed ten years previously with ''[[Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea]]''). [[Mumford & Sons]], who grew out of a series of jam sessions in London in 2007, signed a licensing deal with Island in 2009. Heralded as standard bearers for a vibrant new wave of folkish, countrified rock, their debut album, ''[[Sigh No More (Mumford & Sons album)|Sigh No More]]'', sold two million, reaching number two in Britain and America. It also won best British album at the [[BRIT Awards]] in February 2011. The follow-up, ''[[Babel (Mumford & Sons album)|Babel]]'', did even better in 2012, becoming the UK's fastest-selling album of that year, going to number one in Britain and the US and winning album of the year at the 2013 [[Grammy Awards]]. Island also secured the signing of [[Florence + The Machine]] after songwriter [[Florence Welch]] dropped out of her local art college in [[Camberwell]], South London. Her 2009 debut album, ''[[Lungs (album)|Lungs]]'', sold four million and spent over 12 months in the UK chart before being crowned British album of the year at the [[BRIT Awards]] in 2010. ''Lungs'' was followed by 2011's theatrical ''[[Ceremonials]]'', and 2015's more introspective ''[[How Big How Blue How Beautiful]]''.\n\n[[Keane (band)|Keane]] were another of the big successes of Island's sixth decade. Having topped the charts with their five million-selling debut album ''[[Hopes and Fears]]'' in 2004, they went on to secure five consecutive number-one albums in the UK (a feat bettered only by [[The Beatles]]), with subsequent releases ''[[Under the Iron Sea]]'' (2006), ''[[Perfect Symmetry (Keane album)|Perfect Symmetry]]'' (2008), ''[[Night Train (EP)|Night Train]]'' (2010) and ''[[Strangeland (album)|Strangeland]]'' (2012) all topping the charts. [[Paul Weller]]'s relationship with Island dates back to his fourth solo album, 1997's ''[[Heavy Soul (Paul Weller album)|Heavy Soul]]'', and its 2000 follow-up [[Heliocentric (Paul Weller album)|Heliocentric]]. He returned to the label in 2008 and began an outstanding trilogy of releases that contained some of his strongest solo work ''[[22 Dreams]]'' (2008), the [[Mercury Music Prize]]-nominated ''[[Wake Up The Nation]]'' (2010) and ''[[Sonik Kicks]]'' (2012).\n\nNorth London quartet [[Bombay Bicycle Club]] also released four albums on Island, with each one signalling a change of direction: the indie-rock of 2009's ''[[Bombay Bicycle Club#I Had the Blues But I Shook Them Loose (2008-09)|I Had The Blues But I Shook Them Loose]]'' paved the way for 2010's folkier ''[[Flaws (album)|Flaws]]'', the modern rock of 2011's ''[[Bombay Bicycle Club#A Different Kind of Fix (2011-12)|A Different Kind Of Fix]]'' and the broad-based invention of 2014's ''[[So Long, See You Tomorrow (album)|So Long, See You Tomorrow]]''. Having built a loyal live following, [[Catfish and the Bottlemen|Catfish & The Bottlemen]] signed to Island in 2014. After reaching platinum sales status in the UK with their Top Ten debut album, ''[[The Balcony (album)|The Balcony]]'', the Welsh rock band won the BBC Introducing Award at the first [[BBC Music Awards]] in 2014 and were crowned British Breakthrough Act at the [[BRIT Awards]] in 2016 (an award voted for by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] listeners). Their second album, 2016's ''[[The Ride (Catfish and the Bottlemen album)|The Ride]]'', was a UK number one.\n\nIsland was also responsible for securing major British breakthroughs for two of the 21st century's biggest international superstars in [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] and [[The Weeknd]]. The success of Toronto hip-hop artist Drake came after the label had worked patiently to build his profile over a number of years, culminating in the success of his fourth album ''[[Views (album)|Views]]'' and its attendant singles in 2016. \"[[One Dance]]\", Drake's first number one single in the UK, had 1.95 million sales<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-official-top-40-biggest-songs-of-2016__17517/ |title=The Official Top 40 Biggest Songs of 2016 |date=2016-12-30 |publisher=The Official UK Charts Company |accessdate=2017-03-19}}</ref> to become Britain's biggest-selling single of 2016. The single's 15-week run at number one equalled the mark for the second longest in UK chart history. With the Island-signed [[Mike Posner]] having held the number one spot with \"[[I Took a Pill in Ibiza]]\" for four consecutive weeks before being replaced by \"One Dance\", Island held the top spot in the UK singles chart for 19 consecutive weeks between March and August 2016. To crown a record-breaking year, Drake was named the world's best-selling recording artist of 2016 by international music industry organisation [[IFPI]] in February 2017.\n\nCanadian singer and songwriter [[The Weeknd]] also cemented his position as one of the world's leading recording artists, with the 2016 success of his third album ''[[Starboy (album)|Starboy]]''. Its success was the culmination of a strategy that had seen Island build his UK profile over a four-year period that dated from his 2013 studio album ''[[Kiss Land]]''. Island's commitment to further nurturing the careers of global superstars was reiterated in June 2016 with the signing of [[Sean Paul]]. The Jamaican singer, rapper and songwriter released \"[[No Lie (Sean Paul song)|No Lie]]\", his first single for Island, in November 2016.\n\nSigned to Island via a licensing deal with independent label PMR, [[Disclosure (band)|Disclosure]] were formed by two brothers from [[Reigate]] in [[Surrey]], Guy and Howard Lawrence. The duo discovered the joys of nineties [[House music|house]], [[techno]] and [[two-step garage]] while studying music production at college, and went on to enjoy success with their two Island albums ''[[Settle (album)|Settle]]'' (2013) and ''[[Caracal (album)|Caracal]]'' (2015), making extensive use of an array of guest vocalists including [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]], [[Jamie Woon]], [[Eliza Doolittle]], [[Lorde]] and [[Gregory Porter]]. One of the acts who guested on ''Settle'' was [[AlunaGeorge]], a boy-girl duo from London (singer Aluna Francis and musician and producer George Reid), who released their debut album, ''Body Music'', on Island in 2013. Like Disclosure, [[Jessie Ware]] signed to Island through a link with independent label [[PMR Records|PMR]]. A soulful singer-songwriter from Brixton, Ware was nominated for the 2012 [[Mercury Music Prize]] with her smooth debut album, [[Devotion (Jessie Ware album)|Devotion]], and enjoyed further success with 2014's [[Tough Love (Jessie Ware album)|Tough Love]]. Another Island act to enjoy a significant breakthrough was Yorkshire singer [[John Newman (singer)|John Newman]], who topped the UK charts with his first solo single, \"[[Love Me Again (song)|Love Me Again]]\", and his debut album [[Tribute (John Newman album)|Tribute]].\n\nIn May 2018, incumbent president [[David Massey (music executive)|David Massey]] left Island to join [[Sony Music Entertainment]]'s relaunch of [[Arista Records]]. [[Darcus Beese]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] took on the role of president upon Massey's departure. To make the transition, Beese relocated from the United Kingdom to Island's offices at [[Universal Music Group]]'s New York City building.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.universalmusic.com/darcus-beese-named-president-island-records/|title=DARCUS BEESE NAMED PRESIDENT OF ISLAND RECORDS|date=2018-05-24|website=UMG|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref>\n\n==Manga Entertainment==\nIsland World Communications, under the leadership of Blackwell and Andy Frain, created [[Manga Entertainment]] Ltd, the anime and live action Japanese film division of Island in 1991.

While in England, Blackwell travelled throughout the city carrying his stock with him and sold to record stores in the city.

One day we were summoned to Chris' house. And he says, \"Alright gentleman, I think it's time. This Toots and the Maytals looks like it's going to be a big thing\". By this time he had already signed Bob (Marley). So in his camp, Island Records, there was Toots and the Maytals]/ the late Bob Marley; we were talking about reggae is going international now.  We kept on meeting and he (Blackwell) decided that the backing band that back all of the songs, the recording band, should be the Maytals band.  So everything came under Toots and the Maytals. So we became Maytals also. And then we hit the road in 1975 ... we were the opening act for the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], and [[Jackson Browne]].

Bob Marley's 1981 death was detrimental to the company, especially after its having engineered Marley's international breakthrough only a few years earlier, while Irish rock band [[U2]], which had signed to Island in March 1980, was growing in popularity, but had not yet reached the international superstar status that was to come. In 1981, Blackwell also used the label to finance a new film production and distribution company, producing the film ''[[Countryman (film)|Countryman]]''.<ref name=IA>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|page=1|date=September 20, 1985|last=Greenberg|first=James|title=Island And Alive Dissolving Joint Prod'n Venture}}</ref> In 1982, [[Paul Morley]] and producer [[Trevor Horn]] started the [[ZTT]] label under the Island banner and Blackwell was known to approve excessive spending by the label.<ref name=\"May\" /> Morley recalls in a 2009 book about Island Records:\n\n<blockquote>I eventually grew to appreciate how Chris Blackwell, and therefore Island Records, was not about one thing, or one style, or one system, or one way of doing things ...

The events were a celebration of the street-cool, independent outlook and striking visual imagery at the label's creative core. These festivities centred around a week-long run of shows at Shepherd's Bush Empire and [[Bush Hall]] in London. The concerts featured performances tracing the label's history from its reggae and jazz roots to the modern era. Among the artists who appeared were [[Sly & Robbie]], [[Ernest Ranglin]], [[Paul Weller]], The Compass Point All Stars, [[The I Threes]], [[Aswad]], [[Kid Creole and the Coconuts|Kid Creole & the Coconuts]], [[Grace Jones]], [[Steel Pulse]], [[Keane (band)|Keane]], [[Tom Tom Club]], [[Toots & The Maytals]], [[The Mighty Diamonds]], Yusuf Islam/ [[Cat Stevens]], [[Bombay Bicycle Club]], [[Baaba Maal]] and [[U2]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/andrew-perry/5393263/Island-Records-50th-anniversary-concert-Grace-Jones-Sly-and-Robbie-and-other-guests-review.html|title=Island Records' 50th anniversary concert: Grace Jones, Sly & Robbie and other guests - review|last=Perry|first=Andrew|date=2009-05-27|access-date=2017-12-14|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Another Island 50 tribute event was held over four nights at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in Switzerland, with [[Marianne Faithfull]], Grace Jones and Sly & Robbie all appearing, and Chris Blackwell holding a Question & Answer session.\n\nThere was also a major exhibition at the [[The Vinyl Factory|Vinyl Factory]] Gallery in Soho, held in an open space beneath the record shop Phonica. The exhibition featured a display of treasured musical artifacts, including the [[Trabant]] car from the sleeve of [[U2]]'s ''[[Achtung Baby]]'', [[Nick Drake]]'s guitar, the dress worn by [[Amy Winehouse]] at the 2008 Grammy Awards, the handwritten lyric sheet for Winehouse's song \"[[Love Is a Losing Game]]\" and Bob Marley's passport application form. The exhibition contained 800 prints showcasing the work for Island of the photographers Adrian Boot, [[Jean-Paul Goude]], [[Anton Corbijn]], [[Gered Mankowitz]], [[Keith Morris (photographer)|Keith Morris]] and Brian Cooke, and the London exhibition also featured live performances at the Vinyl Factory Gallery by [[DJ Shadow]] and [[PJ Harvey]].\n\n===Into Island's sixth decade: 2009\u20132017===\nFollowing its 50th anniversary in 2009, Island Records entered its sixth decade on a tide of optimism. The years that followed saw fresh success for a number of established acts, including [[PJ Harvey]], [[Keane (band)|Keane]], [[Paul Weller]] and [[Bombay Bicycle Club]] and an exciting wave of new signings. In its largest live production since its 2009 anniversary, the label also staged a concert by [[The Weeknd]] and [[Jack Garratt]] on [[Osea Island]], a small island in [[Essex]], as part of a bespoke one-day festival for 400 guests, including label staff, media and 200 fans who obtained tickets via a ballot.\n\n2016 proved a particularly successful year for the label in the UK: over a seven-week period between April and June, four separate Island acts spent at least one week at number one. The albums concerned were [[PJ Harvey]]'s ''[[The Hope Six Demolition Project]]'', [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]]'s ''[[Views (album)|Views]]'' (which spent two weeks at number one), [[Ariana Grande]]'s ''[[Dangerous Woman]]'' and [[Catfish and the Bottlemen|Catfish & The Bottlemen's]] ''[[The Ride (Catfish and the Bottlemen album)|The Ride]]''.\n\n====Island's sixth decade: the artists====\n[[PJ Harvey]]'s eighth studio album, 2011's ''[[Let England Shake]]'', was one of the key records of Island's sixth decade. Made in a cliff-top church in [[Dorset]], it won the 2011 [[Mercury Music Prize]], making Harvey the only artist to land the prestigious award twice (she had prevailed ten years previously with ''[[Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea]]''). [[Mumford & Sons]], who grew out of a series of jam sessions in London in 2007, signed a licensing deal with Island in 2009. Heralded as standard bearers for a vibrant new wave of folkish, countrified rock, their debut album, ''[[Sigh No More (Mumford & Sons album)|Sigh No More]]'', sold two million, reaching number two in Britain and America. It also won best British album at the [[BRIT Awards]] in February 2011. The follow-up, ''[[Babel (Mumford & Sons album)|Babel]]'', did even better in 2012, becoming the UK's fastest-selling album of that year, going to number one in Britain and the US and winning album of the year at the 2013 [[Grammy Awards]]. Island also secured the signing of [[Florence + The Machine]] after songwriter [[Florence Welch]] dropped out of her local art college in [[Camberwell]], South London. Her 2009 debut album, ''[[Lungs (album)|Lungs]]'', sold four million and spent over 12 months in the UK chart before being crowned British album of the year at the [[BRIT Awards]] in 2010. ''Lungs'' was followed by 2011's theatrical ''[[Ceremonials]]'', and 2015's more introspective ''[[How Big How Blue How Beautiful]]''.\n\n[[Keane (band)|Keane]] were another of the big successes of Island's sixth decade. Having topped the charts with their five million-selling debut album ''[[Hopes and Fears]]'' in 2004, they went on to secure five consecutive number-one albums in the UK (a feat bettered only by [[The Beatles]]), with subsequent releases ''[[Under the Iron Sea]]'' (2006), ''[[Perfect Symmetry (Keane album)|Perfect Symmetry]]'' (2008), ''[[Night Train (EP)|Night Train]]'' (2010) and ''[[Strangeland (album)|Strangeland]]'' (2012) all topping the charts. [[Paul Weller]]'s relationship with Island dates back to his fourth solo album, 1997's ''[[Heavy Soul (Paul Weller album)|Heavy Soul]]'', and its 2000 follow-up [[Heliocentric (Paul Weller album)|Heliocentric]]. He returned to the label in 2008 and began an outstanding trilogy of releases that contained some of his strongest solo work ''[[22 Dreams]]'' (2008), the [[Mercury Music Prize]]-nominated ''[[Wake Up The Nation]]'' (2010) and ''[[Sonik Kicks]]'' (2012).\n\nNorth London quartet [[Bombay Bicycle Club]] also released four albums on Island, with each one signalling a change of direction: the indie-rock of 2009's ''[[Bombay Bicycle Club#I Had the Blues But I Shook Them Loose (2008-09)|I Had The Blues But I Shook Them Loose]]'' paved the way for 2010's folkier ''[[Flaws (album)|Flaws]]'', the modern rock of 2011's ''[[Bombay Bicycle Club#A Different Kind of Fix (2011-12)|A Different Kind Of Fix]]'' and the broad-based invention of 2014's ''[[So Long, See You Tomorrow (album)|So Long, See You Tomorrow]]''. Having built a loyal live following, [[Catfish and the Bottlemen|Catfish & The Bottlemen]] signed to Island in 2014. After reaching platinum sales status in the UK with their Top Ten debut album, ''[[The Balcony (album)|The Balcony]]'', the Welsh rock band won the BBC Introducing Award at the first [[BBC Music Awards]] in 2014 and were crowned British Breakthrough Act at the [[BRIT Awards]] in 2016 (an award voted for by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] listeners). Their second album, 2016's ''[[The Ride (Catfish and the Bottlemen album)|The Ride]]'', was a UK number one.\n\nIsland was also responsible for securing major British breakthroughs for two of the 21st century's biggest international superstars in [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] and [[The Weeknd]]. The success of Toronto hip-hop artist Drake came after the label had worked patiently to build his profile over a number of years, culminating in the success of his fourth album ''[[Views (album)|Views]]'' and its attendant singles in 2016. \"[[One Dance]]\", Drake's first number one single in the UK, had 1.95 million sales<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-official-top-40-biggest-songs-of-2016__17517/ |title=The Official Top 40 Biggest Songs of 2016 |date=2016-12-30 |publisher=The Official UK Charts Company |accessdate=2017-03-19}}</ref> to become Britain's biggest-selling single of 2016. The single's 15-week run at number one equalled the mark for the second longest in UK chart history. With the Island-signed [[Mike Posner]] having held the number one spot with \"[[I Took a Pill in Ibiza]]\" for four consecutive weeks before being replaced by \"One Dance\", Island held the top spot in the UK singles chart for 19 consecutive weeks between March and August 2016. To crown a record-breaking year, Drake was named the world's best-selling recording artist of 2016 by international music industry organisation [[IFPI]] in February 2017.\n\nCanadian singer and songwriter [[The Weeknd]] also cemented his position as one of the world's leading recording artists, with the 2016 success of his third album ''[[Starboy (album)|Starboy]]''. Its success was the culmination of a strategy that had seen Island build his UK profile over a four-year period that dated from his 2013 studio album ''[[Kiss Land]]''. Island's commitment to further nurturing the careers of global superstars was reiterated in June 2016 with the signing of [[Sean Paul]]. The Jamaican singer, rapper and songwriter released \"[[No Lie (Sean Paul song)|No Lie]]\", his first single for Island, in November 2016.\n\nSigned to Island via a licensing deal with independent label PMR, [[Disclosure (band)|Disclosure]] were formed by two brothers from [[Reigate]] in [[Surrey]], Guy and Howard Lawrence. The duo discovered the joys of nineties [[House music|house]], [[techno]] and [[two-step garage]] while studying music production at college, and went on to enjoy success with their two Island albums ''[[Settle (album)|Settle]]'' (2013) and ''[[Caracal (album)|Caracal]]'' (2015), making extensive use of an array of guest vocalists including [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]], [[Jamie Woon]], [[Eliza Doolittle]], [[Lorde]] and [[Gregory Porter]]. One of the acts who guested on ''Settle'' was [[AlunaGeorge]], a boy-girl duo from London (singer Aluna Francis and musician and producer George Reid), who released their debut album, ''Body Music'', on Island in 2013. Like Disclosure, [[Jessie Ware]] signed to Island through a link with independent label [[PMR Records|PMR]]. A soulful singer-songwriter from Brixton, Ware was nominated for the 2012 [[Mercury Music Prize]] with her smooth debut album, [[Devotion (Jessie Ware album)|Devotion]], and enjoyed further success with 2014's [[Tough Love (Jessie Ware album)|Tough Love]]. Another Island act to enjoy a significant breakthrough was Yorkshire singer [[John Newman (singer)|John Newman]], who topped the UK charts with his first solo single, \"[[Love Me Again (song)|Love Me Again]]\", and his debut album [[Tribute (John Newman album)|Tribute]].\n\nIn May 2018, incumbent president [[David Massey (music executive)|David Massey]] left Island to join [[Sony Music Entertainment]]'s relaunch of [[Arista Records]]. [[Darcus Beese]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] took on the role of president upon Massey's departure. To make the transition, Beese relocated from the United Kingdom to Island's offices at [[Universal Music Group]]'s New York City building.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.universalmusic.com/darcus-beese-named-president-island-records/|title=DARCUS BEESE NAMED PRESIDENT OF ISLAND RECORDS|date=2018-05-24|website=UMG|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref>\n\n==Manga Entertainment==\nIsland World Communications, under the leadership of Blackwell and Andy Frain, created [[Manga Entertainment]] Ltd, the anime and live action Japanese film division of Island in 1991.

Each episode included live \"inserts\" before broadcasting a full live episode on 20 February. There were two episodes  broadcast on 19 February; following its usual broadcast, the show aired a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] episode, in which viewers were shown the hours leading up to [[Lucy Beale]]'s ([[Hetti Bywater]]) death (see [[Who Killed Lucy Beale?]]).\n\n=== 17 February 2015 ===\n\nThe residents of Albert Square are haunted by the death of Lucy as Ian and Jane's wedding dawns over Walford. [[Lauren Branning]]'s ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]) quest to out the killer continues; she gives Jane the wedding card, however Jane is shocked when it is revealed what Lauren wrote \u2013 \"I know what happened to Lucy. She was killed at home.\" A worried [[Stacey Slater|Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) informs [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) that Lauren knows what happened to Lucy. Max is unnerved and when [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) confronts him, he tells her that Lauren knows that she killed Lucy. Meanwhile, [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) returns to the square with [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]] ([[Perry Fenwick]]) and [[Peggy Mitchell]] ([[Barbara Windsor]]) by his side. Phil is determined to find Ian as he has found something that he should know, whilst Peggy confronts [[Dot Cotton|Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]) over her son, [[Nick Cotton]] ([[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]]). However, it soon becomes apparent that they have been followed by a mysterious man called [[Vincent Hubbard]] ([[Richard Blackwood]]). He approaches Phil in search for [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]) before going to the hospital, leaving a single rose for her. It's also the day that Ronnie is due to be woken up from her coma; doctors are successful when she starts breathing on her own, and an overwhelmed [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]) tells [[Charlie Cotton (2014 character)|Charlie Cotton]] ([[Declan Bennett]]) not to breathe a word of their recent affair; Ronnie awakens as the conversation happens.\n\n=== 18 February 2015 ===\n\nPhil is about to explain to Ian what he has found out, but after [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] ([[Harry Reid (actor)|Harry Reid]]) walks in on their conversation, he cannot do it. After some encouragement from [[Christian Clarke]] ([[John Partridge (actor)|John Partridge]]) and an appearance from [[Tanya Branning|Tanya Cross]] ([[Jo Joyner]]), Jane makes it to the restaurant where, after some hesitation, she makes her vows to Ian. Meanwhile, Max and Abi find out that Lauren is at an abortion clinic. Max follows her, whilst Abi awaits nervously at the wedding. Max tries to talk some sense into Lauren but is unable to get through to her; she goes ahead with the consultation meeting but [[Peter Beale]] ([[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]]) interrupts her. He tells her that he would be a good father and would support Lauren through all her issues. Lauren replies that she is confused on what to do, before confessing to Peter what she knows about Lucy. At the reception, Jane returns home where she calls [[Masood Ahmed]] ([[Nitin Ganatra]]) over with [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby Beale]] (Eliot Carrington) and asks him to take the boy to his home. Ian catches up with Jane, and Peter walks in with [[Cindy Williams (EastEnders)|Cindy Williams]] ([[Mimi Keene]]) and says he thinks that it was either Cindy, Ian or Jane who killed Lucy. Max returns home and shouts at Abi, whilst Tanya walks in and demands to know what's going on. Max is hesitant, but Abi delivers her the truth and denies that she killed Lucy, but did have a fight with her. Dot confesses to an unconscious Ronnie about what she has done, but as she is revealing all she is overheard by Charlie and [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Arthur \"Fatboy\" Chubb]] ([[Ricky Norwood]]). Dot then confesses all to them as well, but before she can finish Charlie announces that he is going to kill Nick and Dot states that she has already done so.\n\n=== 19 February 2015 ===\n\n==== \"Look Back in Anger\" ====\n\n[[Mick Carter]] ([[Danny Dyer]]) reveals to [[Nancy Carter]] ([[Maddy Hill]]) that he has seen [[Dean Wicks]] ([[Matt Di Angelo]]) on the square and goes to look for him without success. Dean gains entry to the cellar of the pub armed with a jerry can of petrol. Nancy discovers him and he takes her hostage but is released after Mick finds them. Dean repeats that he is not a rapist and does not want to hurt anyone, but wants revenge by burning down the pub. However, before Dean can light the petrol Mick attacks him with a fire extinguisher before pressing on his throat with his foot leaving Dean unconscious. At the reception, [[Kim Fox-Hubbard]] ([[Tameka Empson]]) has been feeling pain in her stomach and goes into premature labour after a heated argument with her sister, [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]). Kim names her baby [[Pearl Fox-Hubbard|Pearl]] as she is so small and precious. As Kim is about to leave for the hospital, she tells Denise that she is to blame for her unexpected arrival and that she doesn't want anyone near her and her baby. Away from the reception, Stacey, [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]) and [[Kush Kazemi]] ([[Davood Ghadami]]) find Nick's body in 23 Albert Square. They realise that Dot knew and that they have to call the police. While Dot is confessing all to [[Sharon Watts|Sharon Mitchell]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) and Ian, Charlie realises that they can get rid of the body and then no one would believe what Dot is saying. However, while they find [[Les Coker]] ([[Roger Sloman]]) and [[Carol Jackson]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]) to devise a plan, Dot phones the police and confesses to Nick's death. After showing [[Samantha Keeble|DI Samantha Keeble]] ([[Alison Newman]]) where Nick's body is she is taken in for questioning. When Sharon confronts Phil over his recent behavior, he tells her he has been receiving a lot of money but says no more than that, and Sharon pressures him to focus on his family and his businesses and to stay away from dealing which would see him in prison. As Phil has his conversation with Sharon he receives several texts from an unknown person. Away from the square Phil arranges to meet up with the unknown person who is revealed to be his former wife [[Kathy Beale|Kathy Sullivan]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]), who has been presumed dead for nine years. Peter's family are stunned following his shocking revelation and he, Cindy, Jane and Ian all start to suspect one another; before Peter blames Denise. He asks Ian to go and confront her and after hesitating he leaves to find Denise only to be distracted by the drama at Dot's. Later Peter confronts Denise himself and Ian stops him stating that she did not kill Lucy. After Peter returns home to Cindy and Jane the phone begins to ring, with all three reluctant to answer. Ian, meanwhile, is having a phone conversation with a mystery person and tells them that he knows and to get everyone out, as he is coming home. Ian returns home finding Jane and asks her to tell him what exactly happened on the night Lucy died.\n\n==== Flashback episode ====\n\nThe episode casts back to the night of Lucy's murder. The puzzle begins to piece itself together, and previous mysteries are reaching a conclusion. Whitney continues to envy Lucy after she slept with her crush, [[Lee Carter (EastEnders)|Lee Carter]] ([[Danny-Boy Hatchard]]). Lucy catches Billy stealing fish from the chip shop and the pair arguing seen by Lee, during which Billy suggests that they take their relationship further. Lucy then makes her way to the flat to meet a client and boards the same bus as [[Jay Brown]] ([[Jamie Borthwick]]). As she alights the bus her brother Peter is seen meeting up with a drug dealer to score cocaine for her. Lucy is unhappy when Jay and Ben appear at the flat, with Ben demanding that she get rid of the client so that they can talk. The client is revealed to be a drunken [[Jake Stone (EastEnders)|Jake Stone]] ([[Jamie Lomas]]) who is looking to restart his fling with Lauren. She takes pity on him and the pair take an unlicensed mini cab home. Back in Walford the driver leaves Lucy to take care of him after seeing the state of Jake. While Max walks the dog he comes across the pair and helps Lucy get Jake inside, unknown to him he has been followed by Abi who sees this. Inside, Jake attempts to attack Max and accidentally punches Lucy causing her to lose an earring and have a nose bleed. Meanwhile, Ronnie obtains a gun from Vincent and the pair are revealed to be longstanding acquaintances. Ben and Jay have also returned to Walford and Jay encourages Ben to see Phil. It is revealed that Ben robbed the shop on his own and as Lucy has cancelled a trip to Miami he believes she owes him and steals her belongings. Left with nothing, Lucy returns home, but on her way meets Abi, who confronts her about her relationship with Max before attacking Lucy. Abi returns home following the incident and happily tells Max what she has done. Billy while attempting to get rid of the fish and his pictures of Lucy is interrupted by Peter, causing him to hide the images under the fridge. He discreetly gets rid of the fish and whilst he is out Peter starts to organise Lucy's cocaine. When Billy returns Peter expresses his feelings about Lucy being the favourite child, before deciding that she is on her own and discards of the drugs. As Lucy arrives home, she has a heart to heart with Jane. Upon going inside she overhears a conversation in which Denise tells her daughter [[Chelsea Fox]] ([[Tiana Benjamin]]) that she is going to leave Ian. Lucy is angered by this and orders her to leave immediately, which results in the pair of them fighting which Bobby overhears. Cindy, Ian and Lee are then seen making voicemails on Lucy's phone while she sits outside of the Beale house. Upon going back in Lucy with her jewellery box on the table writes an note but is interrupted. Jane and Masood, meanwhile, have been arguing all evening about Jane rushing to the Beale house to help resolve various issues. When her phone rings again Masood storms off assuming it's Ian. When Jane answers she calms the person on the other line down and arrives at the Beale house. Jane finds the front door ajar and Lucy unconscious in the living room. Upon checking Lucy for vital signs she realises that she is dead and turns to find Bobby holding Lucy's jewellery box.\n\n=== 20 February 2015 ===\n\nThis episode returns to the present day, with Ian confronting Jane over what happened to Lucy. Jane continues to cover for Bobby by saying that she killed Lucy. When Peter and Cindy return to the house, Jane begins to go into her version of the details of what happened, but Ian realises she is lying when he sees that Bobby has tried to reach Jane, and thus did the same on the night that Lucy died. Jane reveals that she convinced Bobby that it was someone else had killed Lucy, and that she carried Lucy lovingly to the place where her body would be found. Ian calls Bobby over to tell him what he did, but changes his mind after Jane tells him to view it from her point of view. Ian returns and insists that the whole family must deal with the situation together, which everyone agrees to, except Peter who storms out during the ensuing argument saying that he'll never forgive his father. Bobby overhears the argument and drops Lucy's note, which Cindy discovers when she goes to find him; while Ian and Jane insist that Bobby should not discover the truth and they start their marriage anew.

There were two episodes  broadcast on 19 February; following its usual broadcast, the show aired a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] episode, in which viewers were shown the hours leading up to [[Lucy Beale]]'s ([[Hetti Bywater]]) death (see [[Who Killed Lucy Beale?]]).\n\n=== 17 February 2015 ===\n\nThe residents of Albert Square are haunted by the death of Lucy as Ian and Jane's wedding dawns over Walford. [[Lauren Branning]]'s ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]) quest to out the killer continues; she gives Jane the wedding card, however Jane is shocked when it is revealed what Lauren wrote \u2013 \"I know what happened to Lucy. She was killed at home.\" A worried [[Stacey Slater|Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) informs [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) that Lauren knows what happened to Lucy. Max is unnerved and when [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) confronts him, he tells her that Lauren knows that she killed Lucy. Meanwhile, [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) returns to the square with [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]] ([[Perry Fenwick]]) and [[Peggy Mitchell]] ([[Barbara Windsor]]) by his side. Phil is determined to find Ian as he has found something that he should know, whilst Peggy confronts [[Dot Cotton|Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]) over her son, [[Nick Cotton]] ([[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]]). However, it soon becomes apparent that they have been followed by a mysterious man called [[Vincent Hubbard]] ([[Richard Blackwood]]). He approaches Phil in search for [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]) before going to the hospital, leaving a single rose for her. It's also the day that Ronnie is due to be woken up from her coma; doctors are successful when she starts breathing on her own, and an overwhelmed [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]) tells [[Charlie Cotton (2014 character)|Charlie Cotton]] ([[Declan Bennett]]) not to breathe a word of their recent affair; Ronnie awakens as the conversation happens.\n\n=== 18 February 2015 ===\n\nPhil is about to explain to Ian what he has found out, but after [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] ([[Harry Reid (actor)|Harry Reid]]) walks in on their conversation, he cannot do it. After some encouragement from [[Christian Clarke]] ([[John Partridge (actor)|John Partridge]]) and an appearance from [[Tanya Branning|Tanya Cross]] ([[Jo Joyner]]), Jane makes it to the restaurant where, after some hesitation, she makes her vows to Ian. Meanwhile, Max and Abi find out that Lauren is at an abortion clinic. Max follows her, whilst Abi awaits nervously at the wedding. Max tries to talk some sense into Lauren but is unable to get through to her; she goes ahead with the consultation meeting but [[Peter Beale]] ([[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]]) interrupts her. He tells her that he would be a good father and would support Lauren through all her issues. Lauren replies that she is confused on what to do, before confessing to Peter what she knows about Lucy. At the reception, Jane returns home where she calls [[Masood Ahmed]] ([[Nitin Ganatra]]) over with [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby Beale]] (Eliot Carrington) and asks him to take the boy to his home. Ian catches up with Jane, and Peter walks in with [[Cindy Williams (EastEnders)|Cindy Williams]] ([[Mimi Keene]]) and says he thinks that it was either Cindy, Ian or Jane who killed Lucy. Max returns home and shouts at Abi, whilst Tanya walks in and demands to know what's going on. Max is hesitant, but Abi delivers her the truth and denies that she killed Lucy, but did have a fight with her. Dot confesses to an unconscious Ronnie about what she has done, but as she is revealing all she is overheard by Charlie and [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Arthur \"Fatboy\" Chubb]] ([[Ricky Norwood]]). Dot then confesses all to them as well, but before she can finish Charlie announces that he is going to kill Nick and Dot states that she has already done so.\n\n=== 19 February 2015 ===\n\n==== \"Look Back in Anger\" ====\n\n[[Mick Carter]] ([[Danny Dyer]]) reveals to [[Nancy Carter]] ([[Maddy Hill]]) that he has seen [[Dean Wicks]] ([[Matt Di Angelo]]) on the square and goes to look for him without success. Dean gains entry to the cellar of the pub armed with a jerry can of petrol. Nancy discovers him and he takes her hostage but is released after Mick finds them. Dean repeats that he is not a rapist and does not want to hurt anyone, but wants revenge by burning down the pub. However, before Dean can light the petrol Mick attacks him with a fire extinguisher before pressing on his throat with his foot leaving Dean unconscious. At the reception, [[Kim Fox-Hubbard]] ([[Tameka Empson]]) has been feeling pain in her stomach and goes into premature labour after a heated argument with her sister, [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]). Kim names her baby [[Pearl Fox-Hubbard|Pearl]] as she is so small and precious. As Kim is about to leave for the hospital, she tells Denise that she is to blame for her unexpected arrival and that she doesn't want anyone near her and her baby. Away from the reception, Stacey, [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]) and [[Kush Kazemi]] ([[Davood Ghadami]]) find Nick's body in 23 Albert Square. They realise that Dot knew and that they have to call the police. While Dot is confessing all to [[Sharon Watts|Sharon Mitchell]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) and Ian, Charlie realises that they can get rid of the body and then no one would believe what Dot is saying. However, while they find [[Les Coker]] ([[Roger Sloman]]) and [[Carol Jackson]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]) to devise a plan, Dot phones the police and confesses to Nick's death. After showing [[Samantha Keeble|DI Samantha Keeble]] ([[Alison Newman]]) where Nick's body is she is taken in for questioning. When Sharon confronts Phil over his recent behavior, he tells her he has been receiving a lot of money but says no more than that, and Sharon pressures him to focus on his family and his businesses and to stay away from dealing which would see him in prison. As Phil has his conversation with Sharon he receives several texts from an unknown person. Away from the square Phil arranges to meet up with the unknown person who is revealed to be his former wife [[Kathy Beale|Kathy Sullivan]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]), who has been presumed dead for nine years. Peter's family are stunned following his shocking revelation and he, Cindy, Jane and Ian all start to suspect one another; before Peter blames Denise. He asks Ian to go and confront her and after hesitating he leaves to find Denise only to be distracted by the drama at Dot's. Later Peter confronts Denise himself and Ian stops him stating that she did not kill Lucy. After Peter returns home to Cindy and Jane the phone begins to ring, with all three reluctant to answer. Ian, meanwhile, is having a phone conversation with a mystery person and tells them that he knows and to get everyone out, as he is coming home. Ian returns home finding Jane and asks her to tell him what exactly happened on the night Lucy died.\n\n==== Flashback episode ====\n\nThe episode casts back to the night of Lucy's murder. The puzzle begins to piece itself together, and previous mysteries are reaching a conclusion. Whitney continues to envy Lucy after she slept with her crush, [[Lee Carter (EastEnders)|Lee Carter]] ([[Danny-Boy Hatchard]]). Lucy catches Billy stealing fish from the chip shop and the pair arguing seen by Lee, during which Billy suggests that they take their relationship further. Lucy then makes her way to the flat to meet a client and boards the same bus as [[Jay Brown]] ([[Jamie Borthwick]]). As she alights the bus her brother Peter is seen meeting up with a drug dealer to score cocaine for her. Lucy is unhappy when Jay and Ben appear at the flat, with Ben demanding that she get rid of the client so that they can talk. The client is revealed to be a drunken [[Jake Stone (EastEnders)|Jake Stone]] ([[Jamie Lomas]]) who is looking to restart his fling with Lauren. She takes pity on him and the pair take an unlicensed mini cab home. Back in Walford the driver leaves Lucy to take care of him after seeing the state of Jake. While Max walks the dog he comes across the pair and helps Lucy get Jake inside, unknown to him he has been followed by Abi who sees this. Inside, Jake attempts to attack Max and accidentally punches Lucy causing her to lose an earring and have a nose bleed. Meanwhile, Ronnie obtains a gun from Vincent and the pair are revealed to be longstanding acquaintances. Ben and Jay have also returned to Walford and Jay encourages Ben to see Phil. It is revealed that Ben robbed the shop on his own and as Lucy has cancelled a trip to Miami he believes she owes him and steals her belongings. Left with nothing, Lucy returns home, but on her way meets Abi, who confronts her about her relationship with Max before attacking Lucy. Abi returns home following the incident and happily tells Max what she has done. Billy while attempting to get rid of the fish and his pictures of Lucy is interrupted by Peter, causing him to hide the images under the fridge. He discreetly gets rid of the fish and whilst he is out Peter starts to organise Lucy's cocaine. When Billy returns Peter expresses his feelings about Lucy being the favourite child, before deciding that she is on her own and discards of the drugs. As Lucy arrives home, she has a heart to heart with Jane. Upon going inside she overhears a conversation in which Denise tells her daughter [[Chelsea Fox]] ([[Tiana Benjamin]]) that she is going to leave Ian. Lucy is angered by this and orders her to leave immediately, which results in the pair of them fighting which Bobby overhears. Cindy, Ian and Lee are then seen making voicemails on Lucy's phone while she sits outside of the Beale house. Upon going back in Lucy with her jewellery box on the table writes an note but is interrupted. Jane and Masood, meanwhile, have been arguing all evening about Jane rushing to the Beale house to help resolve various issues. When her phone rings again Masood storms off assuming it's Ian. When Jane answers she calms the person on the other line down and arrives at the Beale house. Jane finds the front door ajar and Lucy unconscious in the living room. Upon checking Lucy for vital signs she realises that she is dead and turns to find Bobby holding Lucy's jewellery box.\n\n=== 20 February 2015 ===\n\nThis episode returns to the present day, with Ian confronting Jane over what happened to Lucy. Jane continues to cover for Bobby by saying that she killed Lucy. When Peter and Cindy return to the house, Jane begins to go into her version of the details of what happened, but Ian realises she is lying when he sees that Bobby has tried to reach Jane, and thus did the same on the night that Lucy died. Jane reveals that she convinced Bobby that it was someone else had killed Lucy, and that she carried Lucy lovingly to the place where her body would be found. Ian calls Bobby over to tell him what he did, but changes his mind after Jane tells him to view it from her point of view. Ian returns and insists that the whole family must deal with the situation together, which everyone agrees to, except Peter who storms out during the ensuing argument saying that he'll never forgive his father. Bobby overhears the argument and drops Lucy's note, which Cindy discovers when she goes to find him; while Ian and Jane insist that Bobby should not discover the truth and they start their marriage anew. Cindy reads Lucy's note to Ian and Jane and when Bobby returns the four embrace. Meanwhile, Mick and Nancy are unable find signs of life from Dean and in a panic leave the cellar locking the door. In The Queen Vic, [[Linda Carter]] ([[Kellie Bright]]) proposes to Mick who accepts the invitation, sparking calls for more champagne leading to the discovery of the locked door. When a key is found the cellar is discovered to be a mess, with no sign of Dean.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Nitin Ganatra]] as [[Masood Ahmed]]\n* [[Kim Vithana]] as [[List of EastEnders characters (2015)#Margaret Badini|Dr. Margaret Badini]]\n* Eliot Carrington as [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby Beale]]\n* [[Adam Woodyatt]] as [[Ian Beale]]\n* [[Laurie Brett]] as [[Jane Beale]]\n* [[Hetti Bywater]] as [[Lucy Beale]]\n* [[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]] as [[Peter Beale]]\n* [[Lorna Fitzgerald]] as [[Abi Branning]]\n* [[June Brown]] as [[Dot Cotton|Dot Branning]]\n* [[Jacqueline Jossa]] as [[Lauren Branning]]\n* Aine Garvey as [[Lily Branning]]\n* [[Jake Wood]] as [[Max Branning]]\n* [[Lacey Turner]] as [[Stacey Slater|Stacey Branning]]\n* [[Jamie Borthwick]] as [[Jay Brown]]\n* James Forde as [[Liam Butcher]]\n* [[Danny-Boy Hatchard]] as [[Lee Carter (EastEnders)|Lee Carter]]\n* [[Kellie Bright]] as [[Linda Carter]]\n* [[Danny Dyer]] as [[Mick Carter]]\n* [[Maddy Hill]] as [[Nancy Carter]]\n* [[Linda Henry]] as [[Shirley Carter]]\n* [[Timothy West]] as [[Stan Carter]]\n* [[Luisa Bradshaw-White]] as [[Tina Carter]]\n* [[Ricky Norwood]] as [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Arthur \"Fatboy\" Chubb]]\n* [[John Partridge (actor)|John Partridge]] as [[Christian Clarke]]\n* [[Roger Sloman]] as [[Les Coker]]\n* [[Lin Blakley]] as [[Pam Coker]]\n* [[Declan Bennett]] as [[Charlie Cotton (2014 character)|Charlie Cotton]]\n* [[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]] as [[Nick Cotton]]\n* [[Ann Mitchell]] as [[Cora Cross]]\n* [[Tanya Franks]] as [[Rainie Cross]]\n* [[Jo Joyner]] as [[Tanya Branning|Tanya Cross]]\n* [[Shona McGarty]] as [[Whitney Dean]]\n* [[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]] as [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]]\n* [[Natalie Cassidy]] as [[Sonia Fowler]]\n* [[Diane Parish]] as [[Denise Fox]]\n* [[Tameka Empson]] as [[Kim Fox|Kim Fox-Hubbard]]\n* [[Richard Blackwood]] as [[Vincent Hubbard]]\n* [[Lindsey Coulson]] as [[Carol Jackson]]\n* [[Davood Ghadami]] as [[Kush Kazemi]]\n* [[Alison Newman]] as [[DI Samantha Keeble]]\n* Tomasz Aleksander as [[List of EastEnders characters (2014)#Arsim Kelmendi|Arsim Kelmendi]]\n* [[Rakhee Thakrar]] as [[Shabnam Masood]]\n* [[Himesh Patel]] as [[Tamwar Masood]]\n* Abbie Knowles as [[Amy Mitchell]]\n* [[Harry Reid (actor)|Harry Reid]] as [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]]\n* [[Perry Fenwick]] as [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]]\n* Grace as [[Janet Mitchell]]\n* [[Barbara Windsor]] as [[Peggy Mitchell]]\n* [[Steve McFadden]] as [[Phil Mitchell]]\n* [[Samantha Womack]] as [[Ronnie Mitchell]]\n* [[Rita Simons]] as [[Roxy Mitchell]]\n* [[Letitia Dean]] as [[Sharon Watts|Sharon Mitchell]]\n* [[Shane Richie]] as [[Alfie Moon]]\n* [[Jessie Wallace]] as [[Kat Slater|Kat Moon]]\n* [[Danielle Harold]] as [[Lola Pearce]]\n* [[Kristian Kiehling]] as [[Aleks Shirovs]]\n* Gledisa Osmani as [[Ineta Shirovs]]\n* [[Annette Badland]] as [[Babe Smith]]\n* [[Jamie Lomas]] as [[Jake Stone (EastEnders)|Jake Stone]]\n* [[Gillian Taylforth]] as [[Kathy Beale|Kathy Sullivan]]\n* [[Jane Slaughter (actress)|Jane Slaughter]] as [[Tracey (EastEnders)|Tracey]]\n* [[Rudolph Walker]] as [[Patrick Trueman]]\n* [[Mimi Keene]] as [[Cindy Williams (EastEnders)|Cindy Williams]]\n* [[Matt Di Angelo]] as [[Dean Wicks]]\n* [[Lisa Hammond (actress)|Lisa Hammond]] as [[Donna Yates]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Background==\nShow bosses confirmed on 1 October 2014 that ''EastEnders'' would air a full 30-minute live episode to celebrate 30 years of ''EastEnders'' and culminate the \"Who Killed Lucy Beale?\" storyline.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\n[[File:Covid 19 new cases and deaths China showing Hubei lockdown.png|thumb|325px|Semi-log graph of new cases and deaths in China during Covid-19 epidemic showing the lockdown and lifting]]\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Ryan further stated that the current data did not warrant public health officials to declare a global pandemic, saying such a declaration would mean \"we're essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to that virus.\"<ref name=\"qg2TX\" />\n\n====March 2020====\n\nOn 11 March, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.<ref name=\"gBXFp\" /> The Director-General said the WHO was \"deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction\".<ref name=\"WHOpandemic2\"/>\n\n===Economic and social policy responses===\n\nInternational governmental organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] has launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as viewpoints and advice. From policies to strengthen health systems and the world economy to addressing the effects of lock-down and restrictions on travel, the digital hub includes a Country Policy Tracker, and aims to help countries learn from each other and to facilitate a co-ordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.<ref>{{cite web

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\n[[File:Covid 19 new cases and deaths China showing Hubei lockdown.png|thumb|325px|Semi-log graph of new cases and deaths in China during Covid-19 epidemic showing the lockdown and lifting]]\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Ryan further stated that the current data did not warrant public health officials to declare a global pandemic, saying such a declaration would mean \"we're essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to that virus.\"<ref name=\"qg2TX\" />\n\n====March 2020====\n\nOn 11 March, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.<ref name=\"gBXFp\" /> The Director-General said the WHO was \"deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction\".<ref name=\"WHOpandemic2\"/>\n\n===Economic and social policy responses===\n\nInternational governmental organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] has launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as viewpoints and advice. From policies to strengthen health systems and the world economy to addressing the effects of lock-down and restrictions on travel, the digital hub includes a Country Policy Tracker, and aims to help countries learn from each other and to facilitate a co-ordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.<ref>{{cite web
