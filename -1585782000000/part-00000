[[George Shinn]], an entrepreneur from [[Kannapolis, North Carolina|Kannapolis]], wanted to bring an NBA team to the Charlotte area, and he assembled a group of prominent local businessmen to head the prospective franchise. The Charlotte area had long been a hotbed for [[college basketball]]. Charlotte was also one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States, and was previously one of the three in-state regional homes to the [[American Basketball Association]]'s [[Carolina Cougars]] from 1969 to 1974.\n\nDespite doubt from critics, Shinn's [[:wikt:ace in the hole|ace in the hole]] was the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], a state-of-the-art arena that would seat almost 24,000 spectators \u2013 the largest basketball-specific arena ever to serve as a full-time home for an NBA team. On April 5, 1987, then-[[Commissioner of the NBA|NBA Commissioner]] [[David Stern]] called Shinn to tell him his group had been awarded the 24th NBA franchise, to begin play in [[1988\u201389 NBA season|1988]]. Franchises were also granted to [[Miami Heat|Miami]], [[Minnesota Timberwolves|Minneapolis-Saint Paul]], and [[Orlando Magic|Orlando]].\n\nOriginally, the new team was going to be called the ''Charlotte Spirit'', but a name-the-team contest yielded \"Hornets\" as the winning choice. The team received further attention when it chose [[teal]] as its primary color, setting off a sports fashion craze in the late 1980s and early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Creamer|first=Chris|title=A closer look at the uniforms and logos of the 90s|url=https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/537646|publisher=[[theScore Inc.]]|date=July 14, 2014|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}</ref> The team's uniforms, designed by international designer and North Carolina native [[Alexander Julian]], featured a first for NBA uniforms\u2014[[pin stripes]]. Similar designs by other teams followed, as they became a hit.\n\nShinn hired Carl Scheer as the team's first President and General Manager. Scheer preferred a roster of veteran players, hoping to put together a competitive team as soon as possible. Former college coach and veteran NBA assistant [[Dick Harter]] was hired as the team's first head coach. In 1988, the Hornets and the [[Miami Heat]] were part of the [[1988 NBA Expansion Draft]]. Unlike many expansion franchises that invest in the future with a team composed entirely of young players, Charlotte stocked its inaugural roster with several veterans in hopes of putting a competitive lineup on the court right away. The team also had three draft picks at the [[1988 NBA draft]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_1988.html|title=1988 NBA Draft|publisher=Pro-Basketball Reference.Com|access-date=December 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====1988\u20131992: Early seasons====\n[[File:1988-89 Charlotte Hornets Season Ticket Book 01.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Season tickets for the Hornets' inaugural season.]]\nThe Hornets' first NBA game took place on November 4, 1988, at the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], losing 133\u201393 to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198811040CHH.html |title=Cleveland Cavaliers 133, Charlotte Hornets 93 |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |date=November 4, 1988 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> Four days later, the team notched its first-ever victory over the [[Los Angeles Clippers]], 117\u2013105.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198811080CHH.html |title=Los Angeles Clippers 105, Charlotte Hornets 117 |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |date=November 8, 1988 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> On December 23, 1988, the Hornets really gave their fans something to cheer about, beating [[Michael Jordan]] and the [[Chicago Bulls]] 103\u2013101 in Jordan's first return to [[North Carolina]] as a professional.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jennifer Armstrong |title=1988 Charlotte Hornets started off with a bang, became wildly popular with their fans |url=http://blog.nola.com/hornetsbeat/2009/03/1998_charlotte_hornets_started.html |work=[[The Times-Picayune]] |date=March 14, 2009 |accessdate=December 7, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905123227/http://blog.nola.com/hornetsbeat/2009/03/1998_charlotte_hornets_started.html |archive-date=September 5, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Hornets finished their inaugural season with a record of 20\u201362. Scheer left prior to the 1989\u201390 season.\n\nDespite initial concerns that the Coliseum was too big, the Hornets were a runaway hit, leading the NBA in attendance, a feat they would achieve seven more times in Charlotte. Eventually, the Hornets would sell out 364 consecutive games.\n\nThe Hornets' [[1989\u201390 Charlotte Hornets season|second season]] was a struggle from start to finish. Members of the team rebelled against Dick Harter's defense-oriented style, and he was replaced mid-season by assistant [[Gene Littles]] following an 8\u201332 start. Despite the change, the team continued to struggle, finishing the season with a disappointing 19\u201363 record.\n\nThe team showed improvement during the [[1990\u201391 Charlotte Hornets season|following season]]. They won eight of their first fifteen games, including a 120\u2013105 victory over the [[Washington Bullets]]. However, the team went cold, losing their next eleven games. The Hornets, who hosted the [[1991 NBA All-Star Game]], finished with a 26\u201356 record. Despite the team's seven-game improvement over the previous season, Gene Littles was fired at the end of the season and replaced by general manager [[Allan Bristow]].\n\nWith the first pick in the [[1991 NBA draft]], the Hornets drafted [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]] from the [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|University of Nevada, Las Vegas]]. Johnson had an impact season, finishing among the league leaders in points and rebounds, and winning the 1992 [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]]. Additionally, Guard [[Kendall Gill]] led the club in scoring, averaging over 20 points per game. The team stayed in contention for a playoff spot until March, but finished the year with a 31\u201351 record.\n\n====1992\u20131995: Johnson/Mourning era====\nThe Hornets were in the lottery again in 1992 and won the second overall pick in the draft, using it to select [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]] center [[Alonzo Mourning]].

With Wesley, Phills, Rice, Mason, and Divac, the Hornets romped through the regular season, finishing with a 51\u201331 record.

Additionally, [[Glen Rice]] was traded to the Lakers for [[Eddie Jones (basketball)|Eddie Jones]] and [[Elden Campbell]], and [[Dave Cowens]] resigned midway through the season.

A change to a less vibrant orange and blue, while retaining the same look, was made in 2007. Further color changes in 2012 made the bobcat gray, extended the blue background up to the 'Charlotte' name, which changed from blue to orange. A Carolina blue outline around the entire logo was also added. In 2007 the Bobcats unveiled a secondary logo, consisting of a snarling bobcat head facing forward with one side shaded orange, and the other blue. A silver basketball was placed behind the right of the head, all encased in an orange-blue-gray circle. During the 2012 rebranding, the colors were changed, with gray and Carolina blue replacing orange on the head and circle outline, respectively, and the basketball changing to orange.

The navy away uniforms featured 'Charlotte' in white and Carolina blue trim, with the numbers featured the same trim as the city name, with Carolina blue side stripes. In both uniforms, the pinstripes were relegated to the sides. The uniforms bore a close resemblance to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] uniforms.

The Coliseum hosted 364 consecutive NBA sell-outs from December 1988 to November 1997. The Hornets would go on to lead the NBA in attendance over the course of their first seven seasons. When they returned as the Bobcats, they temporarily played in the Coliseum in the 2004\u201305 season while their new arena (the Charlotte Bobcats Arena) was being built. After its completion, the city closed the old Coliseum in the 2005 off-season and opened the new arena with a [[Rolling Stones]] concert.\nIn April 2008, the Bobcats reached a [[naming rights]] deal with [[Time Warner Cable]], North Carolina's largest [[cable television]] provider.

The Honey Bees perform sideline dances as well as center-court dances during games. They also represent the Hornets brand as ambassadors to the community and are involved in community service activities and charity functions. When the team was known as the Bobcats, the cheerleaders were called the Lady Cats.\n\n==Media coverage==\n{{main|List of Charlotte Hornets broadcasters}}\nFrom 1988 to 1992, the Hornets aired most road games, and occasional home games, on a network of stations in North Carolina, [[South Carolina]] and [[Virginia]] fronted by [[WCCB]] in Charlotte. WCCB's longtime owner, [[Cy Bahakel]], was a minority partner in the Hornets' original ownership group. Starting with the 1990\u201391 season, several games also aired on the original SportSouth, forerunner of [[Fox Sports South]], for customers in North and South Carolina. [[WJZY]] became the Hornets' over-the-air flagship in 1992, and remained as such until 1998. From 1995 to 1998, some games aired on WJZY's sister station, WFVT-TV (now [[WMYT-TV]]). [[WAXN-TV]] became the flagship for the 1998\u201399 season, and remained as such until the original team departed in 2002. Generally, most home games slated for telecast aired on SportSouth/Fox Sports South.\n\nWhen the team returned as the Bobcats in 2004, Johnson partnered with Time Warner to create [[Carolinas Sports Entertainment Television]] (C-SET), a [[regional sports network]]. It aired 60 Bobcats games that also aired on [[Comporium Communications|Comporium Cable]] in the South Carolina portion of the Charlotte market. However, Time Warner placed C-SET on its [[digital cable|digital package]] as an incentive to try to get customers to switch to its digital service, leaving analog customers in the dark. It also refused to allow [[DirecTV]] or [[Dish Network]] to pick up C-SET on their local feeds. As a result, Time Warner customers without digital cable, as well as [[western North Carolina]] and most of South Carolina, were left to rely on radio coverage.\n\nC-SET folded on the day of the 2005 NBA draft, and most games then moved to [[News 14 Carolina]], a cable news channel available on Time Warner Cable's systems in Charlotte, the [[Piedmont Triad|Triad]] and the [[Research Triangle|Triangle]]. However, this still left viewers in most of South Carolina (except for the South Carolina side of the Charlotte area, which saw games on Comporium) as well as [[Eastern North Carolina|eastern]] and western North Carolina, out in the cold. News 14 was also not available on satellite.\n\nAs part of the Time Warner Cable Arena deal, the Bobcats signed over broadcasting rights to Fox Sports South. Starting with the last five games of the 2007\u201308 season, about 70 games per season were shown on [[Fox Sports Carolinas]] (Fox Sports South's new regional feed) and sister network Sportsouth (renamed [[Fox Sports Southeast]] in 2015) in North and South Carolina. The deal is believed to be the first simultaneous naming rights and broadcast rights deal in the history of North American professional sports.<ref name=\"BobcatsTWFS\" /> Since the 2008\u201309 season, all Bobcats/Hornets games that are not slated for national broadcast have aired on either Fox Sports Carolinas or Sportsouth/Fox Sports Southeast.\n\nFor the team's first four seasons after their return to the league, select games also aired on a network of over-the-air stations across North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, fronted by WJZY from 2004 to 2006 and WMYT from 2006 to 2008.\n\nThe team's radio flagship is all-sports station [[WFNZ]]. Before 2010, games had aired on [[WOLS]]. WOLS switched its non-sports programming from [[oldies]] to Spanish language on January 1, 2009, making Bobcats and Duke basketball the station's only non-Spanish language programming. [[WBT (radio station)|WBT]] was the Hornets' radio flagship during the original franchise's entire run.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Charlotte Hornets}}\n* {{Official website}}\n\n{{Charlotte Bobcats}}\n{{Navboxes|titlestyle = {{NBA color cell|Charlotte Hornets|border=2}}|list =\n{{Charlotte Bobcats seasons}}\n{{NBA}}\n{{North Carolina Sports}}\n{{Charlotte, North Carolina}}\n}}\n{{Portal bar|Sports|United States}}\n\n[[Category:Charlotte Hornets| ]]\n[[Category:Charlotte Bobcats| ]]\n[[Category:National Basketball Association teams]]\n[[Category:Basketball teams established in 1988]]\n[[Category:1988 establishments in North Carolina]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n{{short description|American professional basketball team based in Charlotte, North Carolina}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2019}}\n{{Infobox basketball club\n| name = Charlotte Hornets\n| current = 2019\u201320 Charlotte Hornets season\n| logo = Charlotte Hornets (2014).svg\n| imagesize = 200px\n| conference = [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern]]\n| division = [[Southeast Division (NBA)|Southeast]]\n| founded = 1988\n| history = '''Charlotte Hornets'''<br />1988\u20132002, 2014\u2013present<br />'''Charlotte Bobcats'''<br />2004\u20132014<!-- Please DO NOT change the history in the infobox; it is official. --><ref name=hornets_name_returns>{{cite news|title=Charlotte Hornets Name Returns to Carolinas|url=http://www.nba.com/hornets/charlotte-hornets-name-returns-carolinas|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Hornets.com|date=May 20, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522200148/http://www.nba.com/hornets/charlotte-hornets-name-returns-carolinas|archive-date=May 22, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=NBA.com/Stats\u2013Charlotte Hornets seasons|url=http://stats.nba.com/team/#!/1610612766/seasons/|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Stats.NBA.com|access-date=March 19, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=History: Team by Team|url=https://cdn.nba.net/assets/pdfs/2018-19-NBA-Guide-10-8.pdf#page=105|publisher=NBA Properties, Inc.|work=2018-19 Official NBA Guide|date=October 8, 2018|access-date=June 1, 2019}}</ref>\n| arena = [[Spectrum Center (arena)|Spectrum Center]]\n| location = [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]\n| colors = Teal, dark purple, gray<ref name=\"HornetsColors2014\">{{cite news|title=Purple and Teal Color Palette to Re-Join Hornets Name in Charlotte|url=http://www.nba.com/hornets/purple-and-teal-color-palette-re-join-hornets-name-charlotte/|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Hornets.com|date=November 24, 2013|access-date=January 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|last=Wash|first=Quinton|title=NBA Unveils Logo For 2019 All-Star Weekend In Charlotte|url=https://www.nba.com/hornets/press-releases/nba-unveils-logo-2019-all-star-weekend-charlotte|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Hornets.com|date=January 31, 2018|access-date=February 18, 2019|quote=The NBA today unveiled the logo for NBA All-Star 2019, which will take place February 15\u201317, 2019, in Charlotte.

[[George Shinn]], an entrepreneur from [[Kannapolis, North Carolina|Kannapolis]], wanted to bring an NBA team to the Charlotte area, and he assembled a group of prominent local businessmen to head the prospective franchise. The Charlotte area had long been a hotbed for [[college basketball]]. Charlotte was also one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States, and was previously one of the three in-state regional homes to the [[American Basketball Association]]'s [[Carolina Cougars]] from 1969 to 1974.\n\nDespite doubt from critics, Shinn's [[:wikt:ace in the hole|ace in the hole]] was the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], a state-of-the-art arena that would seat almost 24,000 spectators \u2013 the largest basketball-specific arena ever to serve as a full-time home for an NBA team. On April 5, 1987, then-[[Commissioner of the NBA|NBA Commissioner]] [[David Stern]] called Shinn to tell him his group had been awarded the 24th NBA franchise, to begin play in [[1988\u201389 NBA season|1988]]. Franchises were also granted to [[Miami Heat|Miami]], [[Minnesota Timberwolves|Minneapolis-Saint Paul]], and [[Orlando Magic|Orlando]].\n\nOriginally, the new team was going to be called the ''Charlotte Spirit'', but a name-the-team contest yielded \"Hornets\" as the winning choice. The team received further attention when it chose [[teal]] as its primary color, setting off a sports fashion craze in the late 1980s and early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Creamer|first=Chris|title=A closer look at the uniforms and logos of the 90s|url=https://www.thescore.com/nba/news/537646|publisher=[[theScore Inc.]]|date=July 14, 2014|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}</ref> The team's uniforms, designed by international designer and North Carolina native [[Alexander Julian]], featured a first for NBA uniforms\u2014[[pin stripes]]. Similar designs by other teams followed, as they became a hit.\n\nShinn hired Carl Scheer as the team's first President and General Manager. Scheer preferred a roster of veteran players, hoping to put together a competitive team as soon as possible. Former college coach and veteran NBA assistant [[Dick Harter]] was hired as the team's first head coach. In 1988, the Hornets and the [[Miami Heat]] were part of the [[1988 NBA Expansion Draft]]. Unlike many expansion franchises that invest in the future with a team composed entirely of young players, Charlotte stocked its inaugural roster with several veterans in hopes of putting a competitive lineup on the court right away. The team also had three draft picks at the [[1988 NBA draft]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_1988.html|title=1988 NBA Draft|publisher=Pro-Basketball Reference.Com|access-date=December 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====1988\u20131992: Early seasons====\n[[File:1988-89 Charlotte Hornets Season Ticket Book 01.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Season tickets for the Hornets' inaugural season.]]\nThe Hornets' first NBA game took place on November 4, 1988, at the [[Charlotte Coliseum]], losing 133\u201393 to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198811040CHH.html |title=Cleveland Cavaliers 133, Charlotte Hornets 93 |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |date=November 4, 1988 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> Four days later, the team notched its first-ever victory over the [[Los Angeles Clippers]], 117\u2013105.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/198811080CHH.html |title=Los Angeles Clippers 105, Charlotte Hornets 117 |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |date=November 8, 1988 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> On December 23, 1988, the Hornets really gave their fans something to cheer about, beating [[Michael Jordan]] and the [[Chicago Bulls]] 103\u2013101 in Jordan's first return to [[North Carolina]] as a professional.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jennifer Armstrong |title=1988 Charlotte Hornets started off with a bang, became wildly popular with their fans |url=http://blog.nola.com/hornetsbeat/2009/03/1998_charlotte_hornets_started.html |work=[[The Times-Picayune]] |date=March 14, 2009 |accessdate=December 7, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905123227/http://blog.nola.com/hornetsbeat/2009/03/1998_charlotte_hornets_started.html |archive-date=September 5, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Hornets finished their inaugural season with a record of 20\u201362. Scheer left prior to the 1989\u201390 season.\n\nDespite initial concerns that the Coliseum was too big, the Hornets were a runaway hit, leading the NBA in attendance, a feat they would achieve seven more times in Charlotte. Eventually, the Hornets would sell out 364 consecutive games.\n\nThe Hornets' [[1989\u201390 Charlotte Hornets season|second season]] was a struggle from start to finish. Members of the team rebelled against Dick Harter's defense-oriented style, and he was replaced mid-season by assistant [[Gene Littles]] following an 8\u201332 start. Despite the change, the team continued to struggle, finishing the season with a disappointing 19\u201363 record.\n\nThe team showed improvement during the [[1990\u201391 Charlotte Hornets season|following season]]. They won eight of their first fifteen games, including a 120\u2013105 victory over the [[Washington Bullets]]. However, the team went cold, losing their next eleven games. The Hornets, who hosted the [[1991 NBA All-Star Game]], finished with a 26\u201356 record. Despite the team's seven-game improvement over the previous season, Gene Littles was fired at the end of the season and replaced by general manager [[Allan Bristow]].\n\nWith the first pick in the [[1991 NBA draft]], the Hornets drafted [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]] from the [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|University of Nevada, Las Vegas]]. Johnson had an impact season, finishing among the league leaders in points and rebounds, and winning the 1992 [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]]. Additionally, Guard [[Kendall Gill]] led the club in scoring, averaging over 20 points per game. The team stayed in contention for a playoff spot until March, but finished the year with a 31\u201351 record.\n\n====1992\u20131995: Johnson/Mourning era====\nThe Hornets were in the lottery again in 1992 and won the second overall pick in the draft, using it to select [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]] center [[Alonzo Mourning]]. Charlotte now had two 20\u201310 threats in Johnson and Mourning, who with Kendall Gill, formed perhaps the league's top young trio. The team finished [[1992\u201393 Charlotte Hornets season|their fifth season]] at 44\u201338, their first-ever winning record and good enough for the first [[1993 NBA Playoffs|playoff berth]] in franchise history. Finishing fifth in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]], the Hornets upset the [[Boston Celtics]] in the first round, with Mourning winning the series with a 20-footer in game four.<ref>{{cite web |last=Smith, Jr. |first=Pat |title=ESPN \u2013 The Mourning After \u2013 Classic |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/classic/news/story?page=add_mourning_alonzo |work=[[ESPN.com]] |date=June 23, 2006 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> However, the Hornets lacked the experience and depth to defeat the [[New York Knicks]], falling in five games in the second round.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHH/1993.html|title=1992\u201393 Charlotte Hornets Roster and Stats|publisher=Basketball Reference.Com|access-date=February 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Hornets finished the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394 season]] with a 41\u201341 record, narrowly missing the playoffs. Despite injuries to both Johnson and Mourning, the two led the team in points-per-game.\n\nIn the [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994\u201395 season]], the Hornets finished with a 50\u201332 record, returning to [[1995 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHH/1995.html|title=Charlotte Hornets 1994\u20131995 Summary|publisher=Pro-Basketball Reference.com|access-date=December 14, 2016}}</ref> Johnson and Mourning again led the team in points-per-game, while also leading the club in rebounding. However, Charlotte was bounced from the playoffs in the first round, falling to the [[Chicago Bulls]] in four games. Following the season, the Hornets traded Mourning to the [[Miami Heat]] for forward [[Glen Rice]], center [[Matt Geiger]], and guard [[Khalid Reeves]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1995-11-04-9511040064-story.html|title=Mourning OFF To Miami|last=Smith|first=Sam|date=November 4, 1995|publisher=Chicago Tribune|access-date=February 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====1995\u20131998: Glen Rice era====\n[[Glen Rice]] would make an immediate impact after joining the Hornets, leading the team in scoring and points-per-game during the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]]. While Rice and Johnson provided high-powered scoring, Geiger tied with Johnson for the team lead in rebounds, and All-Star guard [[Kenny Anderson (basketball)|Kenny Anderson]] ran the point for the injured [[Muggsy Bogues]]. The Hornets were competitive but failed to qualify for the playoffs, again finishing with a 41\u201341 record. [[Allan Bristow]] resigned at the end of the season, and was replaced by [[Dave Cowens]].\n\nThe 1996 off-season was again marked by vast changes: Anderson declined to re-sign, Johnson was shipped to the Knicks for power forward [[Anthony Mason (basketball)|Anthony Mason]], and the team made a trade on [[1996 NBA draft|draft day 1996]], acquiring center [[Vlade Divac]] from the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in exchange for the rights to rookie and future Hall of Famer [[Kobe Bryant]], whom the Hornets picked 13th overall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kobe-bryant-and-the-draft-day-trade-that-changed-nba-history/|title=Kobe Bryant and the draft day trade that changed NBA history|last=Harper|first=Zach|date=April 4, 2016|publisher=CBS Sports|access-date=April 4, 2016}}</ref> The new-look Hornets were successful, with Divac and Geiger providing the center combination, Mason averaging a double-double, Bogues back at the point, and Rice having the finest season of his career. The team achieved the best season in its history at the time, finishing 54\u201328, and making it [[1997 NBA Playoffs|back to the playoffs]]. Despite the success during the regular season, the Hornets went down rather meekly to the Knicks in three games.\n\nThe [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398 season]] was also successful. [[Muggsy Bogues]] was traded two games into the season, and the team picked up point guard [[David Wesley]] and shooting guard [[Bobby Phills]]. With Wesley, Phills, Rice, Mason, and Divac, the Hornets romped through the regular season, finishing with a 51\u201331 record. The Hornets made it to back-to-back playoffs for the first time in franchise history, advancing to the second round, only to be stopped by the Bulls.\n\n====1998\u20132002: Final years of original personnel====\nThe [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399 season]] was shortened. The season did not start until February, as the lockout shortened the regular season to only 50 games. Additionally, [[Glen Rice]] was traded to the Lakers for [[Eddie Jones (basketball)|Eddie Jones]] and [[Elden Campbell]], and [[Dave Cowens]] resigned midway through the season. He was replaced by former Celtics teammate [[Paul Silas]], who became the team's fifth head coach. The team finished with a 26\u201324 record, but failed to qualify for the playoffs.\n\nThe next three seasons ([[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000]], [[2000\u201301 NBA season|2000\u201301]] and [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302]]) saw the Hornets in the playoffs each year, reaching the conference semifinals twice. Before the Hornets were eliminated from the 2002 playoffs, the NBA approved a deal for the team to move to New Orleans following the season.

A change to a less vibrant orange and blue, while retaining the same look, was made in 2007. Further color changes in 2012 made the bobcat gray, extended the blue background up to the 'Charlotte' name, which changed from blue to orange. A Carolina blue outline around the entire logo was also added. In 2007 the Bobcats unveiled a secondary logo, consisting of a snarling bobcat head facing forward with one side shaded orange, and the other blue. A silver basketball was placed behind the right of the head, all encased in an orange-blue-gray circle. During the 2012 rebranding, the colors were changed, with gray and Carolina blue replacing orange on the head and circle outline, respectively, and the basketball changing to orange.

Home uniforms were white with pinstripes in teal, green, blue and purple, while the away jerseys were teal with pinstripes in white, green, blue and purple. The '[[Hugo (mascot)|Hugo]]' logo was prominently featured on the shorts' beltline, beginning in early 1992.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn 1994, the Hornets unveiled a purple alternate uniform, with pinstripes in white, green, blue and teal.

Hugo was moved from the beltline to the left leg, while side stripes with pinstripes were added, in purple (away) and teal (home) colors. A tricolor featuring teal, purple and blue was featured on the beltline and the piping.\n\n====Bobcats====\nThe Bobcats' first home [[Jersey (clothing)|jerseys]] were white, reading \"Bobcats\" in orange with blue and black trimming.

Both designs featured silver pinstripes, similar to what the Hornets wore. The NASCAR uniform was also updated to include the pinstripes.

The navy away uniforms featured 'Charlotte' in white and Carolina blue trim, with the numbers featured the same trim as the city name, with Carolina blue side stripes. In both uniforms, the pinstripes were relegated to the sides. The uniforms bore a close resemblance to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] uniforms.

The Coliseum hosted 364 consecutive NBA sell-outs from December 1988 to November 1997. The Hornets would go on to lead the NBA in attendance over the course of their first seven seasons. When they returned as the Bobcats, they temporarily played in the Coliseum in the 2004\u201305 season while their new arena (the Charlotte Bobcats Arena) was being built. After its completion, the city closed the old Coliseum in the 2005 off-season and opened the new arena with a [[Rolling Stones]] concert.\nIn April 2008, the Bobcats reached a [[naming rights]] deal with [[Time Warner Cable]], North Carolina's largest [[cable television]] provider. In exchange for the naming rights, Time Warner agreed to tear up the cable television deal that had limited the Bobcats' exposure over the team's first four years (see below).<ref name=\"BobcatsTWFS\">{{cite press release|title=Bobcats, Time Warner Cable, Fox Sports Strike Unprecedented Deal|url=http://www.nba.com/bobcats/arena_tv_rights_release.html|publisher=Charlotte Bobcats|date=April 8, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420070145/http://www.nba.com/bobcats/arena_tv_rights_release.html|archivedate=April 20, 2008|accessdate=June 16, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=AP: Time Warner gets naming rights for Bobcats Arena|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/bobcats/2008-04-07-time-warner-rights_N.htm|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=USA Today|date=April 7, 2008|accessdate=June 30, 2009}}</ref> When the Hornets returned to Charlotte, \"The Hive\" nickname also returned to the arena.

The Honey Bees perform sideline dances as well as center-court dances during games. They also represent the Hornets brand as ambassadors to the community and are involved in community service activities and charity functions. When the team was known as the Bobcats, the cheerleaders were called the Lady Cats.\n\n==Media coverage==\n{{main|List of Charlotte Hornets broadcasters}}\nFrom 1988 to 1992, the Hornets aired most road games, and occasional home games, on a network of stations in North Carolina, [[South Carolina]] and [[Virginia]] fronted by [[WCCB]] in Charlotte. WCCB's longtime owner, [[Cy Bahakel]], was a minority partner in the Hornets' original ownership group. Starting with the 1990\u201391 season, several games also aired on the original SportSouth, forerunner of [[Fox Sports South]], for customers in North and South Carolina. [[WJZY]] became the Hornets' over-the-air flagship in 1992, and remained as such until 1998. From 1995 to 1998, some games aired on WJZY's sister station, WFVT-TV (now [[WMYT-TV]]). [[WAXN-TV]] became the flagship for the 1998\u201399 season, and remained as such until the original team departed in 2002. Generally, most home games slated for telecast aired on SportSouth/Fox Sports South.\n\nWhen the team returned as the Bobcats in 2004, Johnson partnered with Time Warner to create [[Carolinas Sports Entertainment Television]] (C-SET), a [[regional sports network]]. It aired 60 Bobcats games that also aired on [[Comporium Communications|Comporium Cable]] in the South Carolina portion of the Charlotte market. However, Time Warner placed C-SET on its [[digital cable|digital package]] as an incentive to try to get customers to switch to its digital service, leaving analog customers in the dark. It also refused to allow [[DirecTV]] or [[Dish Network]] to pick up C-SET on their local feeds. As a result, Time Warner customers without digital cable, as well as [[western North Carolina]] and most of South Carolina, were left to rely on radio coverage.\n\nC-SET folded on the day of the 2005 NBA draft, and most games then moved to [[News 14 Carolina]], a cable news channel available on Time Warner Cable's systems in Charlotte, the [[Piedmont Triad|Triad]] and the [[Research Triangle|Triangle]]. However, this still left viewers in most of South Carolina (except for the South Carolina side of the Charlotte area, which saw games on Comporium) as well as [[Eastern North Carolina|eastern]] and western North Carolina, out in the cold. News 14 was also not available on satellite.\n\nAs part of the Time Warner Cable Arena deal, the Bobcats signed over broadcasting rights to Fox Sports South. Starting with the last five games of the 2007\u201308 season, about 70 games per season were shown on [[Fox Sports Carolinas]] (Fox Sports South's new regional feed) and sister network Sportsouth (renamed [[Fox Sports Southeast]] in 2015) in North and South Carolina. The deal is believed to be the first simultaneous naming rights and broadcast rights deal in the history of North American professional sports.<ref name=\"BobcatsTWFS\" /> Since the 2008\u201309 season, all Bobcats/Hornets games that are not slated for national broadcast have aired on either Fox Sports Carolinas or Sportsouth/Fox Sports Southeast.\n\nFor the team's first four seasons after their return to the league, select games also aired on a network of over-the-air stations across North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, fronted by WJZY from 2004 to 2006 and WMYT from 2006 to 2008.\n\nThe team's radio flagship is all-sports station [[WFNZ]]. Before 2010, games had aired on [[WOLS]].

He gained recognition for his role as Inspector Todd in the [[Beverly Hills Cop (franchise)|''Beverly Hills Cop'' film series]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nBorn in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], Hill was the son of Mary Lee Hill, who raised him and his sister Toni, alone.  In the 1940s, Hill moved with his mother and sister to Washington, D.C.  Hill attended Cardozo High School, graduating in 1949.  Hill had wished to attend [[Howard University]], but was not able due to strained financial resources.\n\nInstead, Hill joined the [[United States Air Force]] in 1950 and was stationed at [[Selfridge Air Force Base]] near Detroit. After leaving the Air Force in 1953, he returned to the Detroit area, where he worked a number of jobs for the next four years.\n\n===Law enforcement career===\nHill joined the Wayne County Sheriff's Department in 1957, but quickly became disillusioned with the slow pace, so he joined the [[Detroit Police Department]] in 1959. In 1969 he was promoted to detective and was assigned to the homicide division the following year. Over the next decade, Hill rose to national attention for his ability to obtain confessions out of the most notorious killers.  He was involved in the investigation surrounding the [[Atlanta Child Murders]] in 1979 that ultimately resulted in the trial and conviction of [[Wayne Williams]].\n\nAllegedly, he was involved in corruption scandals in the city of Detroit as well as failed assassination attempt of Richard Wershe Jr. and his prolonged unlawful imprisonment.{{Citation needed}}\n\nHill was promoted to the rank of Inspector in charge of the Homicide Division by 1982, and in 1989, retired from the Detroit Police Department at the rank of Commander.<ref>\n\nGil Hill Dies.

He was initially considered to be the leading candidate, and had support from many people connected with incumbent mayor [[Dennis Archer]].<ref name=\"hoodresearch\">{{cite web|title=Did Freman and His Supporters Sabotage Gil Hill|url=http://hoodresearch.org/TheThinkersReport/?p=338|website=Hoodresearch.org|accessdate=October 26, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629132303/http://hoodresearch.org/TheThinkersReport/?p=338|archivedate=June 29, 2015|date=October 17, 2005}}</ref>{{better source|date=October 2017}}.

They remained married until her death in 2015.

He gained recognition for his role as Inspector Todd in the [[Beverly Hills Cop (franchise)|''Beverly Hills Cop'' film series]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nBorn in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], Hill was the son of Mary Lee Hill, who raised him and his sister Toni, alone.  In the 1940s, Hill moved with his mother and sister to Washington, D.C.  Hill attended Cardozo High School, graduating in 1949.  Hill had wished to attend [[Howard University]], but was not able due to strained financial resources.\n\nInstead, Hill joined the [[United States Air Force]] in 1950 and was stationed at [[Selfridge Air Force Base]] near Detroit. After leaving the Air Force in 1953, he returned to the Detroit area, where he worked a number of jobs for the next four years.\n\n===Law enforcement career===\nHill joined the Wayne County Sheriff's Department in 1957, but quickly became disillusioned with the slow pace, so he joined the [[Detroit Police Department]] in 1959. In 1969 he was promoted to detective and was assigned to the homicide division the following year. Over the next decade, Hill rose to national attention for his ability to obtain confessions out of the most notorious killers.  He was involved in the investigation surrounding the [[Atlanta Child Murders]] in 1979 that ultimately resulted in the trial and conviction of [[Wayne Williams]].\n\nAllegedly, he was involved in corruption scandals in the city of Detroit as well as failed assassination attempt of Richard Wershe Jr. and his prolonged unlawful imprisonment.\n\nHill was promoted to the rank of Inspector in charge of the Homicide Division by 1982, and in 1989, retired from the Detroit Police Department at the rank of Commander.<ref>\n\nGil Hill Dies.

{"title_page": "FEMA camps conspiracy theory", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2018}}\nThe FEMA camps conspiracy theory holds that the United States [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) is planning to imprison US citizens in [[concentration camp]]s.{{R|\"Keller2011\"}}{{R|\"Potok2014\"}}{{R|\"Lewis2008\"}} This is typically described as following the imposition of [[martial law]] in the United States after a major disaster or crisis. In some versions of the theory, only suspected dissidents will be imprisoned. In more extreme versions, large numbers of US citizens will be imprisoned for the purposes of extermination as a [[New World Order New World Order]] is established.\n\nThe theory has existed since the late 1970s, but it has picked up greatly in popularity with the advent of the internet and [[social media]] platforms.{{R|\"Keller2011\"}}\n\n== About FEMA ==\n{{Main|Federal Emergency Management Agency}}\n\nFEMA is a United States government agency tasked with the effective management of major emergencies within the country, including ensuring the [[continuity of government]] during a large-scale disaster such as a [[nuclear war]]. It provides federal relief to areas afflicted by natural disasters.{{R|\"Graff2017\"}}\n\nThe precursor agency to FEMA was the [[Federal Civil Defense Administration]] established by [[President Harry S Truman]] in 1950 pursuant to executive order #10186.{{R|\"#10186\"}}\n\nFEMA was established in 1979 under executive order by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]]. It was established to coordinate the response to a major disaster that has occurred in the United States and that overwhelms local and state authorities.{{R|\"#12127\"}}\n\nIn 2002 it was finally codified into law and made a component of the [[Department of Homeland Security]]. As well as providing large-scale emergency-management, FEMA is also the largest flood-insurer in the United States, mainly because most private insurance companies don't offer flood-insurance.{{R|\"Flood\"}}\n\nProponents of the conspiracy theory argue FEMA's mission is a cover up for real purpose \u2014 to assume control of the United States following a major disaster or threat \u2014 and that the organization is 'the [[executive (government)|executive]] arm of the coming [[police state]]'.{{R|\"Keller2011\"}}\n\n== Variations ==\n\nThe theory in general states that once a disaster or threat of one comes into being, martial law will be declared and FEMA's emergency powers will come into operation, and it will effectively become the [[government]]. {{R|\"Knight2003\"}} The [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] will be suspended, and citizens will be moved into camps.{{R|\"Keller2011\"}}{{RP|251}}\n\nIn many versions, 'dissidents' (typically defined as constitutionalists/[[patriot movement|patriots]] etc...) will merely be imprisoned.{{R|\"Zaitchik2010\"}} Others have gone so far as to argue that they will be sent to these camps to be murdered.{{R|\"Lewis2008\"}}\n\nExtreme versions state that plans are in place to imprison and kill apolitical American citizens in camps as part of a '[[human population control|population control]]' plot.{{R|\"Lewis2008\"}} In April 2014 Snopes posted a claim that FEMA was marking houses by political affiliation to round people up for these camps. In reality the bright, color coded stickers serve varying purposes for newspaper and mail delivery personnel.{{R|\"Mikkelson2014\"}}\n\nAlthough they do not mention FEMA specifically, the [[Oath Keepers]] list of 10 \"Orders We Will Not Obey,\" contains many of the fears shared by proponents of FEMA conspiracies.{{R|\"Williams2016\"}}\n\nProponents often play into [[racism|racial]] fear, asserting that FEMA will use 'urban gangs' as [[auxiliaries]] to ensure order.{{R|\"Zaitchik2010\"}}\n\nFEMA conspiracies are often worked in larger conspiracy narratives about ushering in a 'New World Order', meaning a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[world government|global government]].{{R|\"Pipes1997\"}}\n\n==History==\nOne of the first known references to FEMA concentration camps comes from a newsletter issued by [[Posse Comitatus (organization)|Posse Comitatus]] in 1982, with the warning that 'hardcore patriots' were to be detained in them.{{R|\"Keller2011\"}} The prevalence of the conspiracy theory increased in line with the rise of the [[militia movement]] in the 1990s.{{R|\"Keller2011\"}}\n\nThe conspiracy was part of the rhetoric of the now largely disbanded [[Militia of Montana]]. The self-styled congressional analyst David Fletcher was their spokesman and brought it up in meetings, even pointing out \"[[United Nations]] Reserves\" that the government was building concentration camps for in the [[Cascade Range|Northern Cascades]].{{R|\"Neiwert2009\"}}\n\nA supposed FEMA camp was featured in [[Linda Thompson (attorney)|Linda Thompson's]] 1994 film ''America Under Siege'' (in reality, the 'FEMA camp' was an [[Amtrak]] repair facility).{{R|\"PM\"}}{{R|\"Amtrak\"}} She accused the government of using \"[[black helicopter]]s\" against patriots to prevent them from interfering with plans to establish a \"[[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]]\".{{R|\"Goodrick-Clarke\"}}{{R|\"Vest\"}}{{R|\"PartyFear\"}}\n\nFollowing the 1995 [[Oklahoma City bombing]], the conspiracy theory was discussed by the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Domestic Terrorism.{{R|\"Zaitchik2010\"}}\n\nThe theory's inclusion in the plot of the 1998 [[The X-Files (film)|''X-Files'' movie]] showed its growing reach.{{R|\"Knight2003\"}}\n\nFears of FEMA declined in the early 2000s as foreign terrorists were perceived as the major threat but the [[Great Recession|late-2000s recession]] and the election of [[Barack Obama]] had renewed opposition among conservatives to the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]. Obama's election also enabled the theory to reach more mainstream right-wing circles whereas it had previously been confined to the fringes. There was a resurgence in the militia movement and with it a resurgence of the FEMA camps conspiracy theory{{R|\"Zaitchik2010\"}} and a corresponding boom in the \"[[prepper]]\" economy.{{R|\"Blake2013\"}}\n\nEmails from the magazine ''[[National Review]]'' have also promoted the theory.{{R|\"Potok2014\"}}\n\nCongresswoman [[Michele Bachmann]] alluded to the theory while in office,{{R|\"Amato2009\"}} as have other [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] politicians.{{R|\"Montgomery2014\"}}\n\nIn December 2011 [[Camille Marino]] of the hard-left animal liberation website Negotiation is Over posted an alert on her website titled \"Military Now Recruiting Guards for FEMA Domestic Detainment/Internment Camps.\" containing the usual warnings about the end of civil liberties and the announcement that the [[U.S. Army]] is looking for \"a Few Good Totalitarians\" to herd dissenters into camps.{{R|\"Nelson2011\"}}\n\nIn 2015, fears of the FEMA roundup beginning surfaced with the announcement of a domestic [[military training]] operation called [[Jade Helm 15]]. County and state officials in [[Texas]] denounced the fears{{R|\"Reinhard2015\"}} and the exercise was completed with no one being placed into an [[internment camp]].{{R|\"Smith2015\"}}\n\nAlso in 2015 additional speculation about the theory was stoked by retired general [[Wesley Clark]] when he called for World War II-style internment camps to be revived to combat Muslim extremism. He stated, \"If these people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to the United States as a matter of principle, fine, that's their right. It\u2019s our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community for the duration of the conflict.\"{{R|\"Salon2015\"}}\n\nWith the end of Obama's presidency and the 2016 election approaching conspiracy theories (including the FEMA death camp idea) were heavily promoted by many on the right, from [[Alex Jones]] to [[Donald Trump]].{{R|\"Burleigh2016\"}}\n\nAccording to the [[Las Vegas Police Department]] and witnesses in the weeks leading up to the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting]] gunman [[Stephen Paddock]] reportedly espoused right-wing anti-government and conspiratorial views, including FEMA conspiracies. He reportedly told a friend that \"sometimes, sacrifices have to be made\" in order to encourage the American public to arm themselves.{{R|\"Raymond2018\"}}{{R|\"Wilson2018\"}}\n\n== Evidence ==\n\n''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' has published a debunking of some of the various claims proponents of the theory make{{R|\"PM\"}} and [[FOX News]] personality [[Glenn Beck]] did a 2009 interview with James Meigs, editor-in-chief there, where he walked through a debunking of one purported camp.{{R|\"Beck2009\"}} \"This video,\" Meigs said, \"actually dates from about 1995. But like so many of these conspiracy theories, it gets re-cut and re-edited and circulated around the Internet.\"{{R|\"Salon2015\"}}\n\nBloggers at the [[Skeptic]] Project have posted detailed lists where they claim to debunk many of the FEMA camp locations in the U.S. elsewhere.{{R|\"Winston2009\"}}\n\n[[Newsweek]] emailed FEMA to inquire about the FEMA camps rumors. Press Secretary Alexa Lopez replied, \"We are currently focusing our efforts on providing assistance to disaster survivors, and the ongoing response and recovery efforts in Louisiana. As to your first question, over the years there have been many myths or rumors surrounding FEMA, and I am glad I have the chance to set the record straight with you. There is absolutely no truth to these rumors\u2014they are nothing more than conspiracy theories.\"{{R|\"Burleigh2016\"}}\n\nHowever, an internal FEMA memo shows the management understands the nature of trying to quell the conspiracies, \"Most people know us as the agency that responds to natural disasters. Others believe we have a somewhat sinister role.

In some versions of the theory, only suspected dissidents will be imprisoned. In more extreme versions, large numbers of US citizens will be imprisoned for the purposes of extermination as a [[New World Order New World Order]] is established.\n\nThe theory has existed since the late 1970s, but it has picked up greatly in popularity with the advent of the internet and [[social media]] platforms.{{R|\"Keller2011\"}}\n\n== About FEMA ==\n{{Main|Federal Emergency Management Agency}}\n\nFEMA is a United States government agency tasked with the effective management of major emergencies within the country, including ensuring the [[continuity of government]] during a large-scale disaster such as a [[nuclear war]]. It provides federal relief to areas afflicted by natural disasters.{{R|\"Graff2017\"}}\n\nThe precursor agency to FEMA was the [[Federal Civil Defense Administration]] established by [[President Harry S Truman]] in 1950 pursuant to executive order #10186.{{R|\"#10186\"}}\n\nFEMA was established in 1979 under executive order by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]]. It was established to coordinate the response to a major disaster that has occurred in the United States and that overwhelms local and state authorities.{{R|\"#12127\"}}\n\nIn 2002 it was finally codified into law and made a component of the [[Department of Homeland Security]]. As well as providing large-scale emergency-management, FEMA is also the largest flood-insurer in the United States, mainly because most private insurance companies don't offer flood-insurance.{{R|\"Flood\"}}\n\nProponents of the conspiracy theory argue FEMA's mission is a cover up for real purpose \u2014 to assume control of the United States following a major disaster or threat \u2014 and that the organization is 'the [[executive (government)|executive]] arm of the coming [[police state]]'.{{R|\"Keller2011\"}}\n\n== Variations ==\n\nThe theory in general states that once a disaster or threat of one comes into being, martial law will be declared and FEMA's emergency powers will come into operation, and it will effectively become the [[government]]. {{R|\"Knight2003\"}} The [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] will be suspended, and citizens will be moved into camps.{{R|\"Keller2011\"}}{{RP|251}}\n\nIn many versions, 'dissidents' (typically defined as constitutionalists/[[patriot movement|patriots]] etc...) will merely be imprisoned.{{R|\"Zaitchik2010\"}} Others have gone so far as to argue that they will be sent to these camps to be murdered.{{R|\"Lewis2008\"}}\n\nExtreme versions state that plans are in place to imprison and kill apolitical American citizens in camps as part of a '[[human population control|population control]]' plot.{{R|\"Lewis2008\"}} In April 2014 Snopes posted a claim that FEMA was marking houses by political affiliation to round people up for these camps. In reality the bright, color coded stickers serve varying purposes for newspaper and mail delivery personnel.{{R|\"Mikkelson2014\"}}\n\nAlthough they do not mention FEMA specifically, the [[Oath Keepers]] list of 10 \"Orders We Will Not Obey,\" contains many of the fears shared by proponents of FEMA conspiracies.{{R|\"Williams2016\"}}\n\nProponents often play into [[racism|racial]] fear, asserting that FEMA will use 'urban gangs' as [[auxiliaries]] to ensure order.{{R|\"Zaitchik2010\"}}\n\nFEMA conspiracies are often worked in larger conspiracy narratives about ushering in a 'New World Order', meaning a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[world government|global government]].{{R|\"Pipes1997\"}}\n\n==History==\nOne of the first known references to FEMA concentration camps comes from a newsletter issued by [[Posse Comitatus (organization)|Posse Comitatus]] in 1982, with the warning that 'hardcore patriots' were to be detained in them.{{R|\"Keller2011\"}} The prevalence of the conspiracy theory increased in line with the rise of the [[militia movement]] in the 1990s.{{R|\"Keller2011\"}}\n\nThe conspiracy was part of the rhetoric of the now largely disbanded [[Militia of Montana]]. The self-styled congressional analyst David Fletcher was their spokesman and brought it up in meetings, even pointing out \"[[United Nations]] Reserves\" that the government was building concentration camps for in the [[Cascade Range|Northern Cascades]].{{R|\"Neiwert2009\"}}\n\nA supposed FEMA camp was featured in [[Linda Thompson (attorney)|Linda Thompson's]] 1994 film ''America Under Siege'' (in reality, the 'FEMA camp' was an [[Amtrak]] repair facility).{{R|\"PM\"}}{{R|\"Amtrak\"}} She accused the government of using \"[[black helicopter]]s\" against patriots to prevent them from interfering with plans to establish a \"[[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]]\".{{R|\"Goodrick-Clarke\"}}{{R|\"Vest\"}}{{R|\"PartyFear\"}}\n\nFollowing the 1995 [[Oklahoma City bombing]], the conspiracy theory was discussed by the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Domestic Terrorism.{{R|\"Zaitchik2010\"}}\n\nThe theory's inclusion in the plot of the 1998 [[The X-Files (film)|''X-Files'' movie]] showed its growing reach.{{R|\"Knight2003\"}}\n\nFears of FEMA declined in the early 2000s as foreign terrorists were perceived as the major threat but the [[Great Recession|late-2000s recession]] and the election of [[Barack Obama]] had renewed opposition among conservatives to the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]. Obama's election also enabled the theory to reach more mainstream right-wing circles whereas it had previously been confined to the fringes. There was a resurgence in the militia movement and with it a resurgence of the FEMA camps conspiracy theory{{R|\"Zaitchik2010\"}} and a corresponding boom in the \"[[prepper]]\" economy.{{R|\"Blake2013\"}}\n\nEmails from the magazine ''[[National Review]]'' have also promoted the theory.{{R|\"Potok2014\"}}\n\nCongresswoman [[Michele Bachmann]] alluded to the theory while in office,{{R|\"Amato2009\"}} as have other [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] politicians.{{R|\"Montgomery2014\"}}\n\nIn December 2011 [[Camille Marino]] of the hard-left animal liberation website Negotiation is Over posted an alert on her website titled \"Military Now Recruiting Guards for FEMA Domestic Detainment/Internment Camps.\" containing the usual warnings about the end of civil liberties and the announcement that the [[U.S. Army]] is looking for \"a Few Good Totalitarians\" to herd dissenters into camps.{{R|\"Nelson2011\"}}\n\nIn 2015, fears of the FEMA roundup beginning surfaced with the announcement of a domestic [[military training]] operation called [[Jade Helm 15]]. County and state officials in [[Texas]] denounced the fears{{R|\"Reinhard2015\"}} and the exercise was completed with no one being placed into an [[internment camp]].{{R|\"Smith2015\"}}\n\nAlso in 2015 additional speculation about the theory was stoked by retired general [[Wesley Clark]] when he called for World War II-style internment camps to be revived to combat Muslim extremism. He stated, \"If these people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to the United States as a matter of principle, fine, that's their right. It\u2019s our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community for the duration of the conflict.\"{{R|\"Salon2015\"}}\n\nWith the end of Obama's presidency and the 2016 election approaching conspiracy theories (including the FEMA death camp idea) were heavily promoted by many on the right, from [[Alex Jones]] to [[Donald Trump]].{{R|\"Burleigh2016\"}}\n\nAccording to the [[Las Vegas Police Department]] and witnesses in the weeks leading up to the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting]] gunman [[Stephen Paddock]] reportedly espoused right-wing anti-government and conspiratorial views, including FEMA conspiracies. He reportedly told a friend that \"sometimes, sacrifices have to be made\" in order to encourage the American public to arm themselves.{{R|\"Raymond2018\"}}{{R|\"Wilson2018\"}}\n\n== Evidence ==\n\n''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' has published a debunking of some of the various claims proponents of the theory make{{R|\"PM\"}} and [[FOX News]] personality [[Glenn Beck]] did a 2009 interview with James Meigs, editor-in-chief there, where he walked through a debunking of one purported camp.{{R|\"Beck2009\"}} \"This video,\" Meigs said, \"actually dates from about 1995. But like so many of these conspiracy theories, it gets re-cut and re-edited and circulated around the Internet.\"{{R|\"Salon2015\"}}\n\nBloggers at the [[Skeptic]] Project have posted detailed lists where they claim to debunk many of the FEMA camp locations in the U.S. elsewhere.{{R|\"Winston2009\"}}\n\n[[Newsweek]] emailed FEMA to inquire about the FEMA camps rumors. Press Secretary Alexa Lopez replied, \"We are currently focusing our efforts on providing assistance to disaster survivors, and the ongoing response and recovery efforts in Louisiana. As to your first question, over the years there have been many myths or rumors surrounding FEMA, and I am glad I have the chance to set the record straight with you. There is absolutely no truth to these rumors\u2014they are nothing more than conspiracy theories.\"{{R|\"Burleigh2016\"}}\n\nHowever, an internal FEMA memo shows the management understands the nature of trying to quell the conspiracies, \"Most people know us as the agency that responds to natural disasters. Others believe we have a somewhat sinister role. For the latter, it is not realistic to think that we can convince them otherwise and it is advisable not to enter into debate on the subject.\"{{R|\"Zaitchik2010\"}}\n\nProponents have cited a [[contingency plan]] ([[Rex 84]]) drafted in part by [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] Colonel [[Oliver North]] calling for the suspension of the Constitution and the detainment of citizens in the event of a national crisis.{{R|\"Keller2011\"}} This was aimed at left-wing activists, not the [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] and right-wingers generally associated with FEMA theories.{{R|\"PRA\"}}  This has been linked to a 1970 document by [[Louis O.

Buddhism can be traced back to before the formation of the Tibetan Empire. The region has a number of surviving Buddhist archaeological sites. These include the [[Manthal Buddha Rock]], a rock relief of the [[Buddha]] at the edge of the village (near Skardu) and the [[Sacred Rock of Hunza]]. Nearby are former sites of Buddhist shelters.\n\nBaltistan had Buddhist majority till the 15th century, before the arrival of Islam in this region. Since then most of the people converted to Islam, the presence of Buddhism in this region has now been limited to archeological sites, as the remaining  Buddhists of this region moved east to [[ladakh]] where Buddhism is the majority religion.\n\n==== Gandhara ====\nThe majority of people in [[Gandhara]], present-day Southern [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province, were Buddhist. Gandhara was largely [[Mahayana]] Buddhist, but also a stronghold of [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism. The [[Swat, Pakistan|Swat]] Valley, known in antiquity as Uddiyana, was a kingdom tributary to Gandhara. There are many archaeological sites from the Buddhist era in Swat. Buddhist scholar Kum\u0101ralabdha of the [[Ruins at Taxila|Taxila]] was comparable to [[Aryadeva]], [[A\u015bvagho\u1e63a]]<nowiki/>and [[Nagarjuna]].\n\n==== Uddiyana ====\nThe Buddhist sage [[Padmasambhava]] is said to have been born in a village near the present day town of Chakdara in [[Lower Dir District]], which was then a part of [[Oddiyana]]. Padmasambhava is known as Guru Rinpoche in Tibetan and it is he who introduced Vajrayana Buddhism in Tibet.\n\n==== Punjab region ====\nBuddhism was practiced in the [[Punjab region]], with many [[Buddhist monastery]] and [[stupa]] sites in the [[Taxila]] [[World Heritage Site]] locale. It was also practiced in the [[Sindh]] regions.\n\n==== Sindh ====\nBuddhist sites in Sindh are numerous but ill preserved and various stages of deterioration. Sites at [[Mansura (Brahmanabad)|Brahmanabad]] (Mansura Sanghar district, Buddhist stupa at [[Mohenjo-daro|mohen jo daro]], [[Siraj-ji-Takri|Sirah-ji-takri]] near Rohri, Sukkur, [[Kahu-Jo-Darro|Kahu Jo Daro]] at Mirpur Khas, Nawabshah, Sudheran jo Thul near Hyderabad, [[Thul Mir Rukan]] stupa, [[Thul Hairo Khan (Buddhist Stupa)|Thul Hairo Khan Stupa]] and Bhaleel Shah Thul square stupas (5th-7th century A.D) at [[Dadu District|Dadu]], Kot Bambhan Thul buddhist tower near Tando Muhammad Khan.

The monks defied appeals from Seoul to abandon their trip for safety reasons and were guarded by Pakistani security forces on their visit to the monastery, built of ochre-coloured stone and nestled on a mountainside. From around 1,000 years BC until the seventh century AD, northern Pakistan and parts of modern Afghanistan formed the Gandhara kingdom, where Greek and Buddhist customs mixed to create what became the Mahayana strand of the religion. The monk Marananta set out from what is now northwest Pakistan to cross China and spread Buddhism on the Korean peninsula during the fourth century.

The monks defied appeals from Seoul to abandon their trip for safety reasons and were guarded by Pakistani security forces on their visit to the monastery, built of ochre-coloured stone and nestled on a mountainside. From around 1,000 years BC until the seventh century AD, northern Pakistan and parts of modern Afghanistan formed the Gandhara kingdom, where Greek and Buddhist customs mixed to create what became the Mahayana strand of the religion. The monk Marananta set out from what is now northwest Pakistan to cross China and spread Buddhism on the Korean peninsula during the fourth century.

However, since 1890, the islands have had a separate local authority. Since the passing of the Isles of Scilly Order 1930, this authority has had the status of a county council and today is known as the [[Council of the Isles of Scilly]].\n\nThe adjective \"Scillonian\" is sometimes used for people or things related to the archipelago.

Tourism is a major part of the local economy, along with agriculture\u2014particularly the production of [[cut flowers]].\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nThe islands may correspond to the [[Cassiterides]] ('Tin Isles') believed by some to have been visited by the [[Phoenicia]]ns and mentioned by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]. However, the archipelago itself does not contain much [[tin]].\n\nThe isles were off the coast of the [[Celtic Britons|Brittonic Celtic]] kingdom of [[Dumnonia]] and later its offshoot, Kernow ([[Cornwall]]), and may have been a part of these polities until their conquest by the English in the 10th century AD.\n\nIt is likely that until relatively recent times the islands were much larger and perhaps joined together into one island named Ennor. Rising sea levels flooded the central plain around 400\u2013500 AD, forming the current 55 islands and islets, if an island is defined as \"land surrounded by water at high tide and supporting land vegetation\".<ref>'The Fortunate Islands' by R.L.

Born {{circa}} 960, Olaf had raided various European cities and fought in several wars. In 986 he met a Christian [[clairvoyance|seer]] on the Isles of Scilly. He was probably a follower of [[Priscillian]] and part of the tiny Christian community that was exiled here from Spain by [[Emperor Maximus]] for [[Priscillianism]]. In [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s Royal Sagas of Norway, it is stated that this seer told him:\n<blockquote>Thou wilt become a renowned king, and do celebrated deeds. Many men wilt thou bring to faith and baptism, and both to thy own and others' good; and that thou mayst have no doubt of the truth of this answer, listen to these tokens. When thou comest to thy ships many of thy people will conspire against thee, and then a battle will follow in which many of thy men will fall, and thou wilt be wounded almost to death, and carried upon a shield to thy ship; yet after seven days thou shalt be well of thy wounds, and immediately thou shalt let thyself be baptised.</blockquote>\n\nThe legend continues that, as the seer foretold, Olaf was attacked by a group of [[Mutiny|mutineers]] upon returning to his ships. As soon as he had recovered from his wounds, he let himself be baptised. He then stopped raiding Christian cities, and lived in England and Ireland. In 995, he used an opportunity to return to Norway. When he arrived, the [[Haakon Jarl]] was facing a revolt. Olaf Tryggvason persuaded the rebels to accept him as their king, and Jarl Haakon was murdered by his own slave, while he was hiding from the rebels in a pig sty.\n\nWith the [[Norman Conquest]], the Isles of Scilly came more under centralised control. About 20 years later, the [[Domesday Book|Domesday survey]] was conducted. The islands would have formed part of the \"[[Exeter]] Domesday\" circuit, which included Cornwall, [[Devon]], Dorset, [[Somerset]], and [[Wiltshire]].\n\nIn the mid-12th century, there was reportedly a Viking attack on the Isles of Scilly, called '''{{lang|non|Syllingar}}''' by the Norse,<ref name=\"OrkSaga\">Anderson, Joseph (Ed.) (1893) ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]''. Translated by J\u00f3n A. Hjaltalin & Gilbert Goudie. Edinburgh.

The name does not make it clear if it referred to a harbour on a larger island than today's St Mary's, or a whole island.\n\nIt is generally considered that Cornwall, and possibly the Isles of Scilly, came under the dominion of the English Crown late in the reign of [[\u00c6thelstan]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} 924\u2013939). In early times one group of islands was in the possession of a confederacy of hermits. [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] (r. 1100\u201335) gave it to the [[Tavistock Abbey|abbey of Tavistock]] who established a priory on [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]], which was abolished at the [[English Reformation|Reformation]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cornish Church Guide |last=Henderson |first=Charles |location=Truro |publisher=Oscar Blackford |year=1925 |page=194 }}</ref>\n\n===Later Middle Ages and early modern period===\n[[File:Kernow Hundreds.png|thumb|Scilly was one of the [[Hundreds of Cornwall]] (formerly known as Cornish Shires) in the early 19th century.]]\n[[File:Scilly-bartholomew02 large.jpg|thumb|Scilly Isles: map by John Bartholomew (1874)]]\n\nAt the turn of the 14th century, the Abbot and convent of Tavistock Abbey petitioned the king,\n\n<blockquote>stat[ing] that they hold certain isles in the sea between Cornwall and Ireland, of which the largest is called Scilly, to which ships come passing between France, Normandy, Spain, [[Bayonne]], [[Gascony]], Scotland, Ireland, Wales and Cornwall: and, because they feel that in the event of a war breaking out between the kings of England and France, or between any of the other places mentioned, they would not have enough power to do justice to these sailors, they ask that they might exchange these islands for lands in Devon, saving the churches on the islands appropriated to them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7710638&queryType=1&resultcount=7 |title=Petitioners: Abbot and convent of Tavistock.

The names provide a wide variety of origins, e.g. Robert and Henry Sage (English), Richard de Tregenestre (Cornish), Ace de Veldre (French), Davy Gogch (possibly Welsh, or Cornish), and Adam le Fuiz Yaldicz (Spanish?).\n\nIt is not known at what point the islanders stopped speaking the [[Cornish language]], but the language seems to have gone into decline in Cornwall beginning in the [[Late Middle Ages]]; it was still dominant between the islands and Bodmin at the time of the Reformation, but it suffered an accelerated decline thereafter. The islands appear to have lost the old Celtic language before parts of [[Penwith]] on the mainland, in contrast to the history of [[Irish language|Irish]] or [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] captured the isles, only to see their garrison mutiny and return the isles to the [[Cavalier|Royalists]]. By 1651 the Royalist governor, [[John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath|Sir John Grenville]], was using the islands as a base for [[privateering]] raids on Commonwealth and Dutch shipping. The Dutch admiral [[Maarten Tromp]] sailed to the isles and on arriving on 30 May 1651 demanded compensation. In the absence of compensation or a satisfactory reply, he declared war on England in June, but declined to challenge Blake for the isles.<ref>Blakemore, Richard J. and Marphy, Elaine. (2018).

Blake's initial attack on [[Old Grimsby]] failed, but the next attacks succeeded in taking [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] and [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]]. Blake placed a battery on Tresco to fire on [[St. Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], but one of the guns exploded, killing its crew and injuring Blake. A second battery proved more successful. Subsequently, Grenville and Blake negotiated terms that permitted the Royalists to surrender honourably. The Parliamentary forces then set to fortifying the islands. They built [[Cromwell's Castle]]\u2014a gun platform on the west side of Tresco\u2014using materials scavenged from an earlier gun platform further up the hill. Although this poorly sited earlier platform dated back to the 1550s, it is now referred to as [[King Charles's Castle]]. In March 1646 the [[Charles II of England|Prince of Wales]] escaped from Falmouth to the isles before seeking a safer base in Jersey.<ref>Blakemore & Murphy.

The chief agricultural product is cut flowers, mostly [[daffodil]]s. Exposure to [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] winds also means that spectacular winter gales lash the islands from time to time.

The peak time of year for this is generally in October when it is not unusual for several of the rarest birds in Europe to share this archipelago. One reason for the success of these islands in producing rarities is the extensive coverage these islands get from birdwatchers, but archipelagos are often favoured by rare birds which like to make landfall and eat there before continuing their journeys and often arrive on far-flung islands first.\n[[File:Isles of Scilly NASA.jpg|thumb|The Isles of Scilly, viewed from the [[International Space Station]].]]\n\n===Tidal influx===\nThe tidal range at the Isles of Scilly is high for an open sea location; the maximum for St.&nbsp;Mary's is {{convert|5.99|m|abbr=on}}. Additionally, the inter-island waters are mostly shallow, which at [[spring tides]] allows for dry land walking between several of the islands. Many of the northern islands can be reached from Tresco, including Bryher, Samson and St.&nbsp;Martin's (requires very low tides). From St.&nbsp;Martin's White Island, Little Ganilly and Great Arthur are reachable. Although the sound between St.&nbsp;Mary's and Tresco, The Road, is fairly shallow, it never becomes totally dry, but according to some sources it should be possible to wade at extreme low tides. Around St.&nbsp;Mary's several minor islands become accessible, including Taylor's Island on the west coast and Tolls Island on the east coast. From St.&nbsp;Agnes, Gugh becomes accessible at each low tide, via a [[tombolo]].\n\n===Climate===\nThe Isles of Scilly features an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] : ''Cfb'') bordering on a rare 49\u00b0N [[humid subtropical climate]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/featurednews/title_528495_en.html |title=Isles of Scilly climate |department=news |website=exeter.ac.uk}}</ref> The average annual temperature is {{convert|11.8|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}, by far the warmest place in the British Isles.

Suitably qualified students after age eighteen attend universities and colleges on the mainland.\n\n==Economy==\n===Historical context===\nSince the mid-18th century the Scillonian economy has relied on trade with the mainland and beyond as a means of sustaining its population. Over the years the nature of this trade has varied, due to wider economic and political factors that have seen the rise and fall of industries such as [[kelp]] harvesting, [[harbour pilot|pilotage]], smuggling, fishing, [[shipbuilding]] and, latterly, [[floriculture|flower farming]]. In a 1987 study of the Scillonian economy, Neate found that many farms on the islands were struggling to remain profitable due to increasing costs and strong competition from overseas producers, with resulting diversification into tourism. Recent statistics suggest that agriculture on the islands now represents less than 2% of all employment.<ref>Gibson, F, ''My Scillionian Home... its past, its present, its future'', St Ives, 1980</ref><ref name=\"partnership\">''Isles of Scilly Integrated Area Plan 2001\u20132004'', Isles of Scilly Partnership 2001</ref><ref>Neate, S, ''The role of tourism in sustaining farm structures and communities on the Isles of Scilly'' in M Bouquet and M Winter (eds) ''Who From Their Labours Rest?  Conflict and practice in rural tourism'' Aldershot, 1987</ref>\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:St Martins Daymark.jpg|thumb|The [[Daymark]] (daylight version of a [[lighthouse]]) on St Martins, the nearest point to the mainland of [[Cornwall]].]]\n\nToday, tourism is estimated to account for 85 percent of the islands' income. The islands have been successful in attracting this investment due to their special environment, favourable summer climate, relaxed culture, efficient co-ordination of tourism providers and good transport links by sea and air to the mainland, uncommon in scale to similar-sized island communities.<ref name=\"council\">''Isles of Scilly Local Plan: A 2020 Vision'', Council of the Isles of Scilly, 2004</ref><ref name=\"touristboard\">''Isles of Scilly 2004, imagine...'', Isles of Scilly Tourist Board, 2004</ref> The majority of visitors stay on [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], which has a concentration of holiday accommodation and other amenities. Of the other inhabited islands, [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] is run as a timeshare resort, and is consequently the most obviously tourist-oriented. [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]] and [[St Martin's, Isles of Scilly|St Martin's]] are more unspoilt, although each has a hotel and other accommodation. [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] has no hotel and is the least-developed of the inhabited islands.\n\nThe islands' economy is highly dependent on tourism, even by the standards of other island communities. \"The concentration [on] a small number of sectors is typical of most similarly sized UK island communities. However, it is the degree of concentration, which is distinctive along with the overall importance of tourism within the economy as a whole and the very limited manufacturing base that stands out\".<ref name=\"partnership\" />\n\nTourism is also a highly seasonal industry owing to its reliance on outdoor recreation, and the lower number of tourists in winter results in a significant constriction of the islands' commercial activities. However, the tourist season benefits from an extended period of business in October when many [[birding|birdwatchers]] (\"birders\") arrive.\n\n====Ornithology====\nBecause of its position, Scilly is the first landing for many migrant birds, including extreme rarities from North America and [[Siberia]]. Scilly is situated far into the Atlantic Ocean, so many American vagrant birds will make first European landfall in the archipelago.\n\nScilly is responsible for many firsts for Britain, and is particularly good at producing vagrant American [[passerine]]s. If an extremely rare bird turns up, the island will see a significant increase in numbers of birders. This type of birding, chasing after rare birds, is called \"[[Birdwatching#Birding, birdwatching and twitching|twitching]]\".\n\nThe islands are home to [[ornithologist]] [[Will Wagstaff]].\n\n===Employment===\nThe predominance of tourism means that \"tourism is by far the main sector throughout each of the individual islands, in terms of employment... [and] this is much greater than other remote and rural areas in the United Kingdom\". Tourism accounts for approximately 63% of all employment.<ref name=\"partnership\" />\n\nBusinesses dependent on tourism, with the exception of a few hotels, tend to be small enterprises typically employing fewer than four people; many of these are family run, suggesting an entrepreneurial culture among the local population.<ref name=\"partnership\" /> However, much of the work generated by this, with the exception of management, is low skilled and thus poorly paid, especially for those involved in cleaning, catering and retail.<ref>J.Urry, ''The Tourist Gaze'' (2nd edition), London, 2002</ref>\n\nBecause of the seasonality of tourism, many jobs on the islands are seasonal and part-time, so work cannot be guaranteed throughout the year. Some islanders take up other temporary jobs 'out of season' to compensate for this. Due to a lack of local casual labour at peak holiday times, many of the larger employers accommodate guest workers, who come to the islands for the summer to have a \u2018[[volunteer travel|working holiday]]\u2019.\n\n===Taxation===\nThe islands were not subject to [[Income Tax|income tax]] until 1954, and there was no motor [[vehicle excise duty]] levied until 1971.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/travel-living-in-a-world-of-their-own-on-the-shortest-day-of-the-year-simon-calder-took-the-high-road-to-shetland-and-frank-barrett-took-the-low-road-to-the-scillies-as-britains-extremities-made-ready-for-christmas-1469283.html |title=Travel: Living in a world of their own: On the shortest day of the year, Simon Calder took the high road to Shetland and Frank Barrett took the low road to the Scillies, as Britain's extremities made ready for Christmas |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=24 December 1993 }}</ref>\n\n===Transport===\n[[File:Electric golf buggy on St Marys.jpg|thumb|An electric golf buggy on St Mary's; these are road licensed and available for hire, as are bicycles, for use on public roads on the island.]]\n[[File:RMV Scillonian III docked at St Mary's harbour.jpg|thumb|''[[Scillonian III]]'' in St Mary's Harbour]]\n\nSt Mary's is the only island with a significant road network and the only island with public highways; in 2005 there were 619 registered vehicles on the island.

[[Fixed-wing aircraft]] services, operated by [[Isles of Scilly Skybus]], operate from [[Land's End Airport|Land's End]], [[Newquay Cornwall Airport|Newquay]] and [[Exeter International Airport|Exeter]].<ref name=iossb>{{cite web |url=http://www.islesofscilly-travel.co.uk/timetable_skybus.asp |title=Skybus Timetables |publisher=Skybus |accessdate=8 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116023855/http://www.islesofscilly-travel.co.uk/timetable_skybus.asp |archivedate=16 November 2013}}</ref>  There is currently no Sunday air transport.\n\nAt present all air and sea, passenger and freight transport between the Isles of Scilly and the mainland is owned by one company - The Isles of Scilly Steamship Company.  This is often blamed for high year-on-year fare increases.  There have been various local attempts to create competition, but as yet none have succeeded.\n\nThe scheduled [[helicopter]] service, which previously linked [[Penzance Heliport]] with St Mary's Airport and [[Tresco Heliport]], ceased at the end of October 2012. A new heliport is currently under construction in Penzance and helicopter services to Tresco and St Mary's are expected to commence in 2019 or 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://penzanceheliport.co.uk/|title=Isles of Scilly Helicopter from Penzance Heliport|website=Penzance Heliport|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-26}}</ref>\n\n===Tenure===\nThe [[freehold (law)|freehold land]] of the islands is the property of the Duchy of Cornwall (except for [[Hugh Town]] on St Mary's, which was sold to the inhabitants in 1949).

The Trust pays a rent to the Duchy of one daffodil per year!}}</ref> The trust currently has four full-time salaried staff and 12 trustees, who are all residents of the Isles. The full trust board is responsible for policy whilst a management team is responsible for day-to-day administration. Its small income and the small number of staff have led to the trust adopting a policy of recruiting volunteers to help it carry out its extensive work programme. While volunteers of all ages are welcome, most are young people who are studying for qualifications in related fields, such as conservation and land management.\n\nLimited housing availability is a contentious yet critical issue for the Isles of Scilly, especially as it affects the feasibility of residency on the islands. Few properties are privately owned, with many units being let by the [[Duchy of Cornwall]], the council and a few by [[housing association]]s. The management of these subsequently affects the possibility of residency on the islands.<ref name=\"martin\">Martin D, 'Heaven and Hell', in ''Inside Housing'', 31 October 2004</ref> The [[Duchy Tenants Association]] was formed in 1996 by a number of tenants of the Duchy of Cornwall.\n\nHousing demand outstrips supply, a problem compounded by restrictions on further development designed to protect the islands' unique environment and prevent the infrastructural carrying capacity from being exceeded. This has pushed up the prices of the few private properties that become available and, significantly for the majority of the islands' populations, it has also affected the rental sector where rates have likewise drastically increased.<ref name=\"SWHB\">''Sub Regional Housing Markets in the South West'', South West Housing Board, 2004</ref><ref name=\"fleming\">S. Fleming et al., ''\"In from the cold\" A report on Cornwall\u2019s Affordable Housing Crisis'', Liberal Democrats, Penzance, 2003</ref>\n\nHigh housing costs pose significant problems for the local population, especially as local incomes (in Cornwall) are only 70% of the national average, whilst house prices are almost \u00a35,000 higher than the national average. This in turn affects the retention of 'key workers' and the younger generation, which consequently affects the viability of schools and other essential community services.<ref name=\"council\" /><ref name=\"fleming\" />\n\nThe limited access to housing provokes strong local politics. It is often assumed that tourism is to blame for this, attracting newcomers to the area who can afford to outbid locals for available housing. Many buildings are used for tourist accommodation which reduces the number available for local residents. Second homes are also thought to account for a significant proportion of the housing stock, leaving many buildings empty for much of the year.<ref name=\"The Cornishman\">''The Cornishman'', \"Islanders in dispute with Duchy over housing policy\", 19 August 2004</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n===People===\n{{Main|Cornish people|English people}}\nAccording to the 2001 UK census, 97% of the population of the islands are [[white British]],<ref name=ONS1 /> with nearly 93% of the inhabitants born in the islands, in mainland Cornwall or elsewhere in England.<ref name=ONS2>{{cite web |title=Isles of Scilly \u2013 Country of Birth |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=276909&c=TR21+0LW&d=13&e=13&g=431427&i=1x1003x1004&m=0&r=0&s=1354783435942&enc=1&dsFamilyId=11 |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=6 December 2012 }}</ref> Since EU enlargement in 2004, a number of [[A8 countries|central Europeans]] have moved to the island, joining the Australians, New Zealanders and South Africans who traditionally made up most of the islands' overseas workers.

Gig racing has been said to derive from the race to collect [[marine salvage|salvage]] from shipwrecks on the rocks around Scilly, but the race was actually to deliver a [[harbour pilot|pilot]] onto incoming vessels, to guide them through the hazardous reefs and shallows. (The boats are correctly termed \"pilot gigs\"). The [[World Pilot Gig Championships]] are held annually over the May Day bank holiday weekend. The event originally involved crews from the Islands and a few crews from Cornwall, but in the intervening years the number of gigs attending has increased, with crews coming from all over the South-West and as far afield as the Netherlands and the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldgigs.co.uk/|title=World Pilot Gig Championships&nbsp;\u2013 Isles of Scilly |author1=Rick Persich |author2=Chairman World Pilot Gigs Championships Committee |accessdate=26 September 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe Isles of Scilly feature what is reportedly the smallest [[association football|football]] league in the world, the [[Isles of Scilly Football League]].<ref>Smith, Rory (22 December 2016).

The island of [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] is considered the most southerly point in the United Kingdom, being over {{convert|4|mi}} further south than the most southerly point of the [[British mainland]] at [[Lizard Point, Cornwall|Lizard Point]], while this \"point\" is in fact some shoals southwest of this island that are {{convert|1.4|mi}} south of St Agnes.\n\nThe population of all the islands at the 2011 census was 2,203.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/scilly-islands/e06000053 |title=UK Census Data 2011 |work=UK Census Data |accessdate=9 June 2015 }}</ref> Scilly forms part of the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of Cornwall, and some services are combined with those of Cornwall. However, since 1890, the islands have had a separate local authority. Since the passing of the Isles of Scilly Order 1930, this authority has had the status of a county council and today is known as the [[Council of the Isles of Scilly]].\n\nThe adjective \"Scillonian\" is sometimes used for people or things related to the archipelago. The [[Duchy of Cornwall]] owns most of the [[freehold (law)|freehold]] land on the islands. Tourism is a major part of the local economy, along with agriculture\u2014particularly the production of [[cut flowers]].\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nThe islands may correspond to the [[Cassiterides]] ('Tin Isles') believed by some to have been visited by the [[Phoenicia]]ns and mentioned by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]. However, the archipelago itself does not contain much [[tin]].\n\nThe isles were off the coast of the [[Celtic Britons|Brittonic Celtic]] kingdom of [[Dumnonia]] and later its offshoot, Kernow ([[Cornwall]]), and may have been a part of these polities until their conquest by the English in the 10th century AD.\n\nIt is likely that until relatively recent times the islands were much larger and perhaps joined together into one island named Ennor. Rising sea levels flooded the central plain around 400\u2013500 AD, forming the current 55 islands and islets, if an island is defined as \"land surrounded by water at high tide and supporting land vegetation\".<ref>'The Fortunate Islands' by R.L.

Born {{circa}} 960, Olaf had raided various European cities and fought in several wars. In 986 he met a Christian [[clairvoyance|seer]] on the Isles of Scilly. He was probably a follower of [[Priscillian]] and part of the tiny Christian community that was exiled here from Spain by [[Emperor Maximus]] for [[Priscillianism]]. In [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s Royal Sagas of Norway, it is stated that this seer told him:\n<blockquote>Thou wilt become a renowned king, and do celebrated deeds. Many men wilt thou bring to faith and baptism, and both to thy own and others' good; and that thou mayst have no doubt of the truth of this answer, listen to these tokens. When thou comest to thy ships many of thy people will conspire against thee, and then a battle will follow in which many of thy men will fall, and thou wilt be wounded almost to death, and carried upon a shield to thy ship; yet after seven days thou shalt be well of thy wounds, and immediately thou shalt let thyself be baptised.</blockquote>\n\nThe legend continues that, as the seer foretold, Olaf was attacked by a group of [[Mutiny|mutineers]] upon returning to his ships. As soon as he had recovered from his wounds, he let himself be baptised. He then stopped raiding Christian cities, and lived in England and Ireland. In 995, he used an opportunity to return to Norway. When he arrived, the [[Haakon Jarl]] was facing a revolt. Olaf Tryggvason persuaded the rebels to accept him as their king, and Jarl Haakon was murdered by his own slave, while he was hiding from the rebels in a pig sty.\n\nWith the [[Norman Conquest]], the Isles of Scilly came more under centralised control. About 20 years later, the [[Domesday Book|Domesday survey]] was conducted. The islands would have formed part of the \"[[Exeter]] Domesday\" circuit, which included Cornwall, [[Devon]], Dorset, [[Somerset]], and [[Wiltshire]].\n\nIn the mid-12th century, there was reportedly a Viking attack on the Isles of Scilly, called '''{{lang|non|Syllingar}}''' by the Norse,<ref name=\"OrkSaga\">Anderson, Joseph (Ed.) (1893) ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]''. Translated by J\u00f3n A. Hjaltalin & Gilbert Goudie. Edinburgh. James Thin and Mercat Press (1990 reprint). {{ISBN|0-901824-25-9}}</ref> recorded in the ''{{lang|non|[[Orkneyinga saga]]}}''\u2014 [[Sweyn Asleifsson]] \"went south, under Ireland, and seized a barge belonging to some monks in Syllingar and plundered it\".<ref name=OrkSaga /> (Chap LXXIII)\n\n<blockquote>...the three chiefs \u2013 Swein, \u00deorbj\u00f6rn and Eirik \u2013 went out on a plundering expedition.

Then they returned to the Orkneys.<ref name=OrkSaga /></blockquote>\n\n\"{{lang|non|Mar\u00eduh\u00f6fn}}\" literally means \"Mary's Harbour/Haven\". The name does not make it clear if it referred to a harbour on a larger island than today's St Mary's, or a whole island.\n\nIt is generally considered that Cornwall, and possibly the Isles of Scilly, came under the dominion of the English Crown late in the reign of [[\u00c6thelstan]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} 924\u2013939). In early times one group of islands was in the possession of a confederacy of hermits. [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] (r. 1100\u201335) gave it to the [[Tavistock Abbey|abbey of Tavistock]] who established a priory on [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]], which was abolished at the [[English Reformation|Reformation]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cornish Church Guide |last=Henderson |first=Charles |location=Truro |publisher=Oscar Blackford |year=1925 |page=194 }}</ref>\n\n===Later Middle Ages and early modern period===\n[[File:Kernow Hundreds.png|thumb|Scilly was one of the [[Hundreds of Cornwall]] (formerly known as Cornish Shires) in the early 19th century.]]\n[[File:Scilly-bartholomew02 large.jpg|thumb|Scilly Isles: map by John Bartholomew (1874)]]\n\nAt the turn of the 14th century, the Abbot and convent of Tavistock Abbey petitioned the king,\n\n<blockquote>stat[ing] that they hold certain isles in the sea between Cornwall and Ireland, of which the largest is called Scilly, to which ships come passing between France, Normandy, Spain, [[Bayonne]], [[Gascony]], Scotland, Ireland, Wales and Cornwall: and, because they feel that in the event of a war breaking out between the kings of England and France, or between any of the other places mentioned, they would not have enough power to do justice to these sailors, they ask that they might exchange these islands for lands in Devon, saving the churches on the islands appropriated to them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7710638&queryType=1&resultcount=7 |title=Petitioners: Abbot and convent of Tavistock.

The names provide a wide variety of origins, e.g. Robert and Henry Sage (English), Richard de Tregenestre (Cornish), Ace de Veldre (French), Davy Gogch (possibly Welsh, or Cornish), and Adam le Fuiz Yaldicz (Spanish?).\n\nIt is not known at what point the islanders stopped speaking the [[Cornish language]], but the language seems to have gone into decline in Cornwall beginning in the [[Late Middle Ages]]; it was still dominant between the islands and Bodmin at the time of the Reformation, but it suffered an accelerated decline thereafter. The islands appear to have lost the old Celtic language before parts of [[Penwith]] on the mainland, in contrast to the history of [[Irish language|Irish]] or [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] captured the isles, only to see their garrison mutiny and return the isles to the [[Cavalier|Royalists]]. By 1651 the Royalist governor, [[John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath|Sir John Grenville]], was using the islands as a base for [[privateering]] raids on Commonwealth and Dutch shipping. The Dutch admiral [[Maarten Tromp]] sailed to the isles and on arriving on 30 May 1651 demanded compensation. In the absence of compensation or a satisfactory reply, he declared war on England in June, but declined to challenge Blake for the isles.<ref>Blakemore, Richard J. and Marphy, Elaine. (2018).

Blake's initial attack on [[Old Grimsby]] failed, but the next attacks succeeded in taking [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] and [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]]. Blake placed a battery on Tresco to fire on [[St. Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], but one of the guns exploded, killing its crew and injuring Blake. A second battery proved more successful. Subsequently, Grenville and Blake negotiated terms that permitted the Royalists to surrender honourably. The Parliamentary forces then set to fortifying the islands. They built [[Cromwell's Castle]]\u2014a gun platform on the west side of Tresco\u2014using materials scavenged from an earlier gun platform further up the hill. Although this poorly sited earlier platform dated back to the 1550s, it is now referred to as [[King Charles's Castle]]. In March 1646 the [[Charles II of England|Prince of Wales]] escaped from Falmouth to the isles before seeking a safer base in Jersey.<ref>Blakemore & Murphy.

The designation covers the entire archipelago, including the uninhabited islands and rocks, and is the smallest such area in the UK. The islands of Annet and Samson have large [[tern]]eries and the islands are well populated by [[pinniped|seals]]. The Isles of Scilly are the only British haunt of the [[lesser white-toothed shrew]] (''Crocidura suaveolens''), where it is known locally as a \"''teak''\" or \"''teke''\".<ref>{{cite news |author=Robinson, H.W. |year=1925 |title=A new British animal discovered in Scilly |newspaper=Scillonian |volume=4 |pages=123\u2013124}}</ref>\n\nThe islands are famous among [[birdwatching|birdwatchers]] for their ability to attract rare birds from all corners of the globe. The peak time of year for this is generally in October when it is not unusual for several of the rarest birds in Europe to share this archipelago. One reason for the success of these islands in producing rarities is the extensive coverage these islands get from birdwatchers, but archipelagos are often favoured by rare birds which like to make landfall and eat there before continuing their journeys and often arrive on far-flung islands first.\n[[File:Isles of Scilly NASA.jpg|thumb|The Isles of Scilly, viewed from the [[International Space Station]].]]\n\n===Tidal influx===\nThe tidal range at the Isles of Scilly is high for an open sea location; the maximum for St.&nbsp;Mary's is {{convert|5.99|m|abbr=on}}. Additionally, the inter-island waters are mostly shallow, which at [[spring tides]] allows for dry land walking between several of the islands. Many of the northern islands can be reached from Tresco, including Bryher, Samson and St.&nbsp;Martin's (requires very low tides). From St.&nbsp;Martin's White Island, Little Ganilly and Great Arthur are reachable. Although the sound between St.&nbsp;Mary's and Tresco, The Road, is fairly shallow, it never becomes totally dry, but according to some sources it should be possible to wade at extreme low tides. Around St.&nbsp;Mary's several minor islands become accessible, including Taylor's Island on the west coast and Tolls Island on the east coast. From St.&nbsp;Agnes, Gugh becomes accessible at each low tide, via a [[tombolo]].\n\n===Climate===\nThe Isles of Scilly features an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] : ''Cfb'') bordering on a rare 49\u00b0N [[humid subtropical climate]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/featurednews/title_528495_en.html |title=Isles of Scilly climate |department=news |website=exeter.ac.uk}}</ref> The average annual temperature is {{convert|11.8|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}, by far the warmest place in the British Isles.

The maximum snowfall was {{convert|23|cm|0|abbr=on}} on 12 January 1987.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/c/n/MetLIB_13_013_FactSheet_7_Final.pdf |publisher=Met Office |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524004028/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/c/n/MetLIB_13_013_FactSheet_7_Final.pdf |archive-date=24 May 2014  |title=Fact Sheet \u2013 South West England |page=17}}</ref> Summers are not as warm as on the mainland.

Suitably qualified students after age eighteen attend universities and colleges on the mainland.\n\n==Economy==\n===Historical context===\nSince the mid-18th century the Scillonian economy has relied on trade with the mainland and beyond as a means of sustaining its population. Over the years the nature of this trade has varied, due to wider economic and political factors that have seen the rise and fall of industries such as [[kelp]] harvesting, [[harbour pilot|pilotage]], smuggling, fishing, [[shipbuilding]] and, latterly, [[floriculture|flower farming]]. In a 1987 study of the Scillonian economy, Neate found that many farms on the islands were struggling to remain profitable due to increasing costs and strong competition from overseas producers, with resulting diversification into tourism. Recent statistics suggest that agriculture on the islands now represents less than 2% of all employment.<ref>Gibson, F, ''My Scillionian Home... its past, its present, its future'', St Ives, 1980</ref><ref name=\"partnership\">''Isles of Scilly Integrated Area Plan 2001\u20132004'', Isles of Scilly Partnership 2001</ref><ref>Neate, S, ''The role of tourism in sustaining farm structures and communities on the Isles of Scilly'' in M Bouquet and M Winter (eds) ''Who From Their Labours Rest?  Conflict and practice in rural tourism'' Aldershot, 1987</ref>\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:St Martins Daymark.jpg|thumb|The [[Daymark]] (daylight version of a [[lighthouse]]) on St Martins, the nearest point to the mainland of [[Cornwall]].]]\n\nToday, tourism is estimated to account for 85 percent of the islands' income. The islands have been successful in attracting this investment due to their special environment, favourable summer climate, relaxed culture, efficient co-ordination of tourism providers and good transport links by sea and air to the mainland, uncommon in scale to similar-sized island communities.<ref name=\"council\">''Isles of Scilly Local Plan: A 2020 Vision'', Council of the Isles of Scilly, 2004</ref><ref name=\"touristboard\">''Isles of Scilly 2004, imagine...'', Isles of Scilly Tourist Board, 2004</ref> The majority of visitors stay on [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], which has a concentration of holiday accommodation and other amenities. Of the other inhabited islands, [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] is run as a timeshare resort, and is consequently the most obviously tourist-oriented. [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]] and [[St Martin's, Isles of Scilly|St Martin's]] are more unspoilt, although each has a hotel and other accommodation. [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] has no hotel and is the least-developed of the inhabited islands.\n\nThe islands' economy is highly dependent on tourism, even by the standards of other island communities. \"The concentration [on] a small number of sectors is typical of most similarly sized UK island communities. However, it is the degree of concentration, which is distinctive along with the overall importance of tourism within the economy as a whole and the very limited manufacturing base that stands out\".<ref name=\"partnership\" />\n\nTourism is also a highly seasonal industry owing to its reliance on outdoor recreation, and the lower number of tourists in winter results in a significant constriction of the islands' commercial activities. However, the tourist season benefits from an extended period of business in October when many [[birding|birdwatchers]] (\"birders\") arrive.\n\n====Ornithology====\nBecause of its position, Scilly is the first landing for many migrant birds, including extreme rarities from North America and [[Siberia]]. Scilly is situated far into the Atlantic Ocean, so many American vagrant birds will make first European landfall in the archipelago.\n\nScilly is responsible for many firsts for Britain, and is particularly good at producing vagrant American [[passerine]]s. If an extremely rare bird turns up, the island will see a significant increase in numbers of birders. This type of birding, chasing after rare birds, is called \"[[Birdwatching#Birding, birdwatching and twitching|twitching]]\".\n\nThe islands are home to [[ornithologist]] [[Will Wagstaff]].\n\n===Employment===\nThe predominance of tourism means that \"tourism is by far the main sector throughout each of the individual islands, in terms of employment... [and] this is much greater than other remote and rural areas in the United Kingdom\". Tourism accounts for approximately 63% of all employment.<ref name=\"partnership\" />\n\nBusinesses dependent on tourism, with the exception of a few hotels, tend to be small enterprises typically employing fewer than four people; many of these are family run, suggesting an entrepreneurial culture among the local population.<ref name=\"partnership\" /> However, much of the work generated by this, with the exception of management, is low skilled and thus poorly paid, especially for those involved in cleaning, catering and retail.<ref>J.Urry, ''The Tourist Gaze'' (2nd edition), London, 2002</ref>\n\nBecause of the seasonality of tourism, many jobs on the islands are seasonal and part-time, so work cannot be guaranteed throughout the year. Some islanders take up other temporary jobs 'out of season' to compensate for this. Due to a lack of local casual labour at peak holiday times, many of the larger employers accommodate guest workers, who come to the islands for the summer to have a \u2018[[volunteer travel|working holiday]]\u2019.\n\n===Taxation===\nThe islands were not subject to [[Income Tax|income tax]] until 1954, and there was no motor [[vehicle excise duty]] levied until 1971.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/travel-living-in-a-world-of-their-own-on-the-shortest-day-of-the-year-simon-calder-took-the-high-road-to-shetland-and-frank-barrett-took-the-low-road-to-the-scillies-as-britains-extremities-made-ready-for-christmas-1469283.html |title=Travel: Living in a world of their own: On the shortest day of the year, Simon Calder took the high road to Shetland and Frank Barrett took the low road to the Scillies, as Britain's extremities made ready for Christmas |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=24 December 1993 }}</ref>\n\n===Transport===\n[[File:Electric golf buggy on St Marys.jpg|thumb|An electric golf buggy on St Mary's; these are road licensed and available for hire, as are bicycles, for use on public roads on the island.]]\n[[File:RMV Scillonian III docked at St Mary's harbour.jpg|thumb|''[[Scillonian III]]'' in St Mary's Harbour]]\n\nSt Mary's is the only island with a significant road network and the only island with public highways; in 2005 there were 619 registered vehicles on the island.

The full trust board is responsible for policy whilst a management team is responsible for day-to-day administration. Its small income and the small number of staff have led to the trust adopting a policy of recruiting volunteers to help it carry out its extensive work programme. While volunteers of all ages are welcome, most are young people who are studying for qualifications in related fields, such as conservation and land management.\n\nLimited housing availability is a contentious yet critical issue for the Isles of Scilly, especially as it affects the feasibility of residency on the islands. Few properties are privately owned, with many units being let by the [[Duchy of Cornwall]], the council and a few by [[housing association]]s. The management of these subsequently affects the possibility of residency on the islands.<ref name=\"martin\">Martin D, 'Heaven and Hell', in ''Inside Housing'', 31 October 2004</ref> The [[Duchy Tenants Association]] was formed in 1996 by a number of tenants of the Duchy of Cornwall.\n\nHousing demand outstrips supply, a problem compounded by restrictions on further development designed to protect the islands' unique environment and prevent the infrastructural carrying capacity from being exceeded. This has pushed up the prices of the few private properties that become available and, significantly for the majority of the islands' populations, it has also affected the rental sector where rates have likewise drastically increased.<ref name=\"SWHB\">''Sub Regional Housing Markets in the South West'', South West Housing Board, 2004</ref><ref name=\"fleming\">S. Fleming et al., ''\"In from the cold\" A report on Cornwall\u2019s Affordable Housing Crisis'', Liberal Democrats, Penzance, 2003</ref>\n\nHigh housing costs pose significant problems for the local population, especially as local incomes (in Cornwall) are only 70% of the national average, whilst house prices are almost \u00a35,000 higher than the national average. This in turn affects the retention of 'key workers' and the younger generation, which consequently affects the viability of schools and other essential community services.<ref name=\"council\" /><ref name=\"fleming\" />\n\nThe limited access to housing provokes strong local politics. It is often assumed that tourism is to blame for this, attracting newcomers to the area who can afford to outbid locals for available housing. Many buildings are used for tourist accommodation which reduces the number available for local residents. Second homes are also thought to account for a significant proportion of the housing stock, leaving many buildings empty for much of the year.<ref name=\"The Cornishman\">''The Cornishman'', \"Islanders in dispute with Duchy over housing policy\", 19 August 2004</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n===People===\n{{Main|Cornish people|English people}}\nAccording to the 2001 UK census, 97% of the population of the islands are [[white British]],<ref name=ONS1 /> with nearly 93% of the inhabitants born in the islands, in mainland Cornwall or elsewhere in England.<ref name=ONS2>{{cite web |title=Isles of Scilly \u2013 Country of Birth |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=276909&c=TR21+0LW&d=13&e=13&g=431427&i=1x1003x1004&m=0&r=0&s=1354783435942&enc=1&dsFamilyId=11 |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=6 December 2012 }}</ref> Since EU enlargement in 2004, a number of [[A8 countries|central Europeans]] have moved to the island, joining the Australians, New Zealanders and South Africans who traditionally made up most of the islands' overseas workers.

In seemingly premeditated aggression, the beaver rammed the boat from behind, capsizing the canoe and sending the man into the river whereupon the rodent used its claws horizontally across the mans mid-section spilling his viscera into the water. The beaver continued its aggression towards the fisherman, and in a display of behavior wholly uncharacteristic of rodents native to the area, gnawed directly into the mans face causing damage from which the man was unable to recover. The influx of organs into the river attracted 10 to 20 additional beavers; it has been shown that the nose of the Eurasian beaver can detect a human pancreas from over 2 miles. It was at this point that a passerby attempted to intervene but was quickly overwhelmed and suffered a fatal wound to the neck caused by a beaver who chewed on his neck.  \n\nNon-fatal attacks on humans have included: an attack on a saltwater snorkeler off the coast of [[Nova Scotia]], which was unusual given that beavers are usually limited to fresh water;<ref name=ch/> the mauling of an elderly woman in [[Virginia]] by a rabid beaver;<ref name=huget/> an attack on a [[Boy Scout]] leader in [[Pennsylvania]], after which members of the Scout troop killed the rabid animal by [[stoning]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/scouts-stone-rabid-beaver-to-death-after-attack/|publisher=CBS|title=Scouts stone rabid beaver to death after attack|date=13 August 2012}}</ref> and an attack on a man swimming in [[Dobra (Kupa)|Dobra River]], [[Croatia]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/karlovcanina-ugrizao-dabar-na-rijeci-dobri-nevjerojatan-slucaj-je-tek-treci-napad-dabra-na-covjeka-zabiljezen-u-europi/1116612/|title=Karlov\u010danina ugrizao dabar dok se kupao u Dobri|work=[[Jutarnji list]]|date=26 July 2013|language=Croatian}}</ref>\n\nBeaver attacks can also be fatal for domestic animals.
