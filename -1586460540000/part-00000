The series narrative follows [[Buffy Summers]] (played by [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]), the latest in a line of young women known as \"Vampire Slayers\", or simply \"[[Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Slayer]]s\". In the story, Slayers, or the \u201dChosen Ones\u201d, are \"called\" (chosen by [[destiny|fate]]) to battle against [[Vampire (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|vampires]], [[demon]]s, and other forces of darkness. Buffy wants to live a normal life, but as the series progresses, she learns to embrace her destiny. Like previous Slayers, Buffy is aided by a [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watcher]], who guides, teaches, and trains her. Unlike her predecessors, Buffy surrounds herself with a circle of loyal friends who become known as the \"Scooby Gang\".\n\nThe series received critical and popular acclaim, frequently being listed as one of the greatest TV shows of all time,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thisisinsider.com/best-tv-shows-of-all-time-2017-6#buffy-the-vampire-slayer-1997-to-2003-12|title=50 TV shows everyone should watch in their lifetime|work=INSIDER|first=Jacob|last=Shamsian|date=March 8, 2018|access-date=October 16, 2018}}</ref> and usually reached between four and six million viewers on original airings.<ref name = \"insightbb-buffy\">{{cite web |author=Wahoske, Matthew J. |url=http://home.insightbb.com/~wahoskem/buffy.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216043137/http://home.insightbb.com/~wahoskem/buffy.html |archivedate=February 16, 2008 |title=Nielsen Ratings For Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Angel, And Firefly |work=Insightbb.com}}</ref> Although such [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] are lower than successful shows on the \"big four\" networks ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[NBC]], and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Orders/2001/fcc01133.txt |title=The Dual Network Rule |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |date=May 15, 2001 |quote=[T]he four major broadcast networks are unique among the media in their ability to reach a wide audience}}</ref> they were a success for the relatively new and smaller WB Television Network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf#search=%22%20Dawson's%20Creek%2C%20Buffy%20is%20often%20associated%20with%20the%20early%20success%20of%20the%20Warner%20Brothers%20Network.%22 |title=Generation M: Media in the Lives of 8\u201318 Year Olds |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |date=March 9, 2005 |quote=Mr. Levin was a key player in establishing The WB's distinct brand and youth appeal through programming such as ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'', ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'', ''[[Charmed]]'', ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'', ''[[Everwood]]'', and ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804080910/http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf |archivedate=August 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\nDespite the fact that ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' was almost entirely ignored by major award shows during its run, the series was nominated for the [[American Film Institute Awards 2001|American Film Institute Award for Drama Series of the Year]], Gellar was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Television Series Drama]] for her performance in the show, and the series was nominated five times for [[TCA Awards|Television Critics Association Awards]], winning once in 2003 for the [[19th TCA Awards|Television Critics Association Heritage Award]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.goldderby.com/article/2017/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-20-years-later-emmys/ |title=\u2018Buffy the Vampire Slayer\u2019: 20 years later, it still remains Emmy\u2019s biggest snub |website=Gold Derby |first=Ralph |last=Galvan |date=March 10, 2017 |accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/article/2002/09/10/five-reasons-buffy-gets-snubbed-emmys/ |title=Five reasons ''Buffy'' gets snubbed by the Emmys |website=Entertainment Weekly |first=Ken |last=Tucker |date=September 10, 2002 |accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/biggest-emmys-snubs-all-time/ |title=14 Jaw-Dropping Emmys Snubs We're Still Not Over |website=TV Guide |first=Kaitlin |last=Thomas |date=September 18, 2016 |accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe success of ''Buffy'' has led to hundreds of tie-in products, including [[List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer novels|novels]], [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer comics|comics]], and [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer video games|video games]].

Giles, rarely referred to by his first name (it is later revealed that in his rebellious younger days he went by \"Ripper\"), is a member of the [[Watchers' Council]], whose job is to train and guide the Slayers. Giles researches the supernatural creatures that Buffy must face, offers insights into their origins and advice on how to defeat them, and helps her train to stay in fighting form.\n\nBuffy is also helped by friends she meets at Sunnydale High: [[Willow Rosenberg]] ([[Alyson Hannigan]]) and [[Xander Harris]] ([[Nicholas Brendon]]). Willow is originally a [[Wallflower (people)|wallflower]] who excels at academics, providing a contrast to Buffy's outgoing personality and less-than-stellar educational record. They share the social isolation that comes with being different, and especially from being exceptional young women. As the series progresses, Willow becomes a more assertive character and a powerful witch, and [[coming out|comes out]] as a [[lesbian]]. In contrast, Xander, with no supernatural abilities, provides [[comic relief]] and a grounded perspective. It is Xander who often provides the heart to the series, and in season six, becomes the hero in place of Buffy who defeats the \"[[Big Bad]]\". Buffy and Willow are the only characters who appear in all 144 episodes; Xander is missing in [[Conversations with Dead People|only one]].\n\nThe cast of characters grew over the course of the series. Buffy first arrives in Sunnydale with her mother, [[Joyce Summers]] (portrayed by [[Kristine Sutherland]]), who functions as an anchor of normality in the Summers' lives even after she learns of Buffy's role in the supernatural world (\"[[Becoming, Part Two]]\"). Buffy's younger sister [[Dawn Summers]] ([[Michelle Trachtenberg]]) is introduced in season five (\"[[Buffy vs. Dracula]]\"). A vampire tortured with a soul in return for horrific deeds committed in the past to many, including a young gypsy girl and her family, [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] (portrayed by [[David Boreanaz]]), is Buffy's love interest throughout the first three seasons. He leaves Buffy after realizing he will never be able to give her a normal life. He goes on to make amends for his sins and to search for redemption in his own spin-off, ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]''. He makes several guest appearances in the remaining seasons, including the last episode.\n\nAt Sunnydale High, Buffy meets several other students besides Willow and Xander willing to join her fight for good, an informal group eventually tagged the \"Scooby Gang\" or \"Scoobies\". [[Cordelia Chase]] ([[Charisma Carpenter]]), the archetypal shallow cheerleader, reluctantly becomes involved. [[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne]] ([[Seth Green]]), a fellow student, rock guitarist and werewolf, joins the group through his relationship with Willow. [[Jenny Calendar]] ([[Robia LaMorte]]), Sunnydale's computer science teacher, joins the group after helping destroy a demon trapped in cyberspace during season 1. She later becomes Giles' love interest. [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]] ([[Emma Caulfield]]), a former vengeance demon (Anyanka) who specialized in avenging scorned women, becomes Xander's lover after losing her powers and joins the group in season four.\n\nIn Buffy's senior year at high school, she meets [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]] ([[Eliza Dushku]]), the other current Slayer, who was \"called\" forth when Slayer [[Kendra (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Kendra Young]] ([[Bianca Lawson]]) was killed by vampire [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]] ([[Juliet Landau]]), in season two. Although Faith initially fights on the side of good with Buffy and the rest of the group, she comes to stand against them and sides with [[Richard Wilkins (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Mayor Richard Wilkins]] ([[Harry Groener]]) after accidentally killing a human in season three. She reappears briefly in the fourth season, looking for vengeance, and moves to ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' where she voluntarily goes to jail for her murders. Faith reappears in season seven of ''Buffy'', after having helped Angel and his crew, and fights alongside Buffy against The First Evil.\n\nBuffy gathers other allies: [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] ([[James Marsters]]), a vampire, is an old companion of Angelus (Angel) and one of Buffy's major enemies in early seasons, although they later become allies and lovers. At the end of season six, Spike regains his soul. Spike is known for his [[Billy Idol]]-style [[peroxide blond]] hair and his black leather coat, stolen from a previous Slayer, [[Nikki Wood]]; her son, [[Robin Wood (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Robin Wood]] ([[D. B. Woodside]]), joins the group in the final season. [[Tara Maclay]] ([[Amber Benson]]) is a fellow member of Willow's [[Wicca]] group during season four, and their friendship eventually turns into a romantic relationship. Buffy becomes involved personally and professionally with [[Riley Finn]] ([[Marc Blucas]]), a military operative in \"the Initiative\", which hunts demons using science and technology. The final season sees [[geek]]y wannabe-villain [[Andrew Wells]] ([[Tom Lenk]]) come to side with the Scoobies after initially being their captive/hostage; they regard him more as a nuisance than an ally.\n\n''Buffy'' featured dozens of recurring characters, both major and minor. For example, the \"Big Bad\" (villain) characters were featured for at least one season (for example, [[Glory (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Glory]] is a character who appeared in 12 episodes, spanning much of season five). Similarly, characters who allied themselves to the group and characters who attended the same institutions were sometimes featured in multiple episodes.\n\n===Setting and filming locations===\n{{Main|Sunnydale}}\n[[File:Torrance High School.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Torrance High School]] was used for the fictional Sunnydale High School.]]\nThe show is set in the fictional California town of Sunnydale, whose suburban [[Sunnydale High|Sunnydale High School]] sits on top of a \"Hellmouth\", a gateway to demon realms. The Hellmouth, located beneath the school library, is a source of mystical energies as well as a [[wikt:nexus|nexus]] for a wide variety of evil creatures and supernatural phenomena. In addition to being an open-ended plot device, Joss Whedon has cited the Hellmouth and \"[[High school (North America)|High school]] as [[Hell]]\" as one of the primary metaphors in creating the series.<ref>Yovanovich, Linda, \"Young Blood\", ''Smgfan.com'', originally from ''OnSat'' (July 14, 1997), Whedon said: \"[High school as hell] was always the basis of the show. When they said, 'Do you want to turn it into a show?' The character was not enough alone to sustain it. But you know when I thought of the idea of the horror movies as a metaphor for high school, [I said] okay this is something that will work week to week.\"</ref>\n\nMost of ''Buffy'' was shot on location in [[Los Angeles, California]]. The high school used in the first three seasons is actually [[Torrance High School]], in [[Torrance, California]], the same high school used for [[Beverly Hills, 90210]].<ref name=\"torrence\">\"[http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/b/buffy.html Buffy the Vampire Slayer film locations]\", ''Movie-locations.com''</ref> The show was initially very dependent on location shooting, because the production budget allowed for few permanent sets to be built.<ref name=\"autogenerated1998\">{{cite video |title=Designing Buffy Featurette |medium=dvd |year=1998 |publisher=20th Century Fox Home Video}}</ref> In Season One this was limited to the interior of Sunnydale High (the library, hallways, and classrooms), Buffy's bedroom, and the Master's underground lair.

While the show is mainly a [[drama]] with frequent [[comic relief]], most episodes blend different [[genre]]s, including [[horror film|horror]], [[martial arts]], [[Romance film|romance]], [[melodrama]], [[farce]], [[science fiction]], [[Screwball comedy film|comedy]], and even, in [[Once More, with Feeling (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|one episode]], [[musical comedy]].\n\nThe series' narrative revolves around Buffy and her friends, collectively dubbed the \"Scooby Gang\", who struggle to balance the fight against [[supernatural]] evils with their complex social lives.<ref name=\"FtF-Intro\" /> The show mixes complex, season-long storylines with a [[Villain of the week|villain-of-the-week]] format; a typical episode contains one or more [[villain]]s, or supernatural phenomena, that are thwarted or defeated by the end of the episode. Though elements and relationships are explored and ongoing subplots are included, the show focuses primarily on Buffy and her role as an [[archetype|archetypal]] [[hero]]ine. Gellar described the show as \"the ultimate metaphor: horrors of adolescence manifesting through these actual monsters. It's the hardest time of life.\"<ref name = \"Guardian 21 July 2018\">{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jul/21/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-to-be-remade-21-years-after-first-episode |title=Buffy the Vampire Slayer to be remade 21 years after first episode |date=July 21, 2018 |accessdate=July 22, 2018 |first=Vanessa |last=Thorpe}}</ref>\n\nIn the first few seasons, the most prominent monsters in the [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings|''Buffy'' bestiary]] are [[Vampire (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|vampires]], which are based on traditional myths, lore, and literary conventions. As the series continues, Buffy and her companions fight an increasing variety of [[Grimslaw demon|demons]], as well as [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Ghosts and spirits|ghosts]], [[Werewolf|werewolves]], [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Undead|zombies]], and [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Dangerous Mortals|unscrupulous humans]].

[[Buffy Summers]] has just moved to [[Sunnydale]] after burning down her old school's gym, and hopes to escape her Slayer duties. Her plans are complicated by [[Rupert Giles]], her new [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watcher]], who reminds her of the inescapable presence of evil. Sunnydale High is built atop a Hellmouth, a portal to demon dimensions that attracts supernatural phenomena to the area. Buffy befriends two schoolmates, [[Xander Harris]] and [[Willow Rosenberg]], who help her fight evil throughout the series, but they must first prevent [[Master (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Master]], an ancient and especially threatening vampire, from opening the Hellmouth and taking over Sunnydale.\n\nThe emotional stakes are raised in [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 2)|season two]]. Vampires [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] and [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]] (weakened from a mob in [[Prague]], which, it is implied, caused her debilitating injury), come to town along with a new slayer, [[Kendra Young]], who was activated as a result of Buffy's brief death in the [[Prophecy Girl|season one finale]]. Xander becomes involved with [[Cordelia Chase|Cordelia]], while Willow becomes involved with witchcraft and [[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne]], who is a werewolf. The romantic relationship between Buffy and the vampire [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] develops over the course of the season, but after they have sex, Angel's soul, given to him by a Gypsy curse in the past, is lost, and he once more becomes Angelus, a sadistic killer. Kendra is killed by a restored Drusilla. Angelus torments much of the \"Scooby Gang\" throughout the rest of the season and murders multiple innocents and Giles' new girlfriend [[Jenny Calendar]], a [[Romani people|gypsy]] who was sent to maintain Angel's curse. To avert an apocalypse, Buffy is forced to banish Angel to a demon dimension just moments after Willow has restored his soul. The ordeal leaves Buffy emotionally shattered, and she leaves Sunnydale.\n\nAfter attempting to start a new life in Los Angeles, Buffy returns to town in [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 3)|season three]]. Angel has mysteriously been released from the demon dimension, but is close to insanity due to the torment he suffered there, and is nearly driven to [[suicide]] by the [[First Evil]]. He and Buffy realize that a relationship between them can never happen; he eventually leaves Sunnydale at the end of the season. A new watcher named Wesley is put in Giles' place when Giles is fired from the Watcher's Council because he has developed a \"father's love\" for Buffy; and towards the end of the season, Buffy announces that she will no longer be working for the Council. Early in the season, she meets [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]], the Slayer activated after Kendra's death. She also encounters the affable [[Mayor (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Mayor Richard Wilkins]], who secretly has plans to \"ascend\" (become a \"pure\" demon) on Sunnydale High's Graduation Day. Although Faith initially works well with Buffy, she becomes increasingly unstable after accidentally killing a human and forms a relationship with the paternal yet manipulative Mayor, eventually landing in a coma after a fight with Buffy. At the end of the season, after the Mayor becomes a huge snake-like demon, Buffy and the entire graduating class destroy him by blowing up Sunnydale High.\n\n[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 4)|Season four]] sees Buffy and Willow enroll at [[University of California|UC]] Sunnydale, while Xander joins the workforce and begins dating [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]], a former vengeance demon. Spike returns as a series regular and is abducted by The Initiative, a top-secret military installation based beneath the UC Sunnydale campus. They implant a [[Integrated circuit|microchip]] in his head that punishes him whenever he tries to harm a human. He makes a truce with the Scooby Gang and begins to fight on their side, purely for the joy of fighting, upon learning that he can still harm other demons. Oz leaves town after realizing that he is too dangerous as a werewolf, and Willow falls in love with [[Tara Maclay]], another witch. Buffy begins dating [[Riley Finn]], a graduate student and member of The Initiative. Although appearing to be a well-meaning anti-demon operation, The Initiative's sinister plans are revealed when [[Adam (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Adam]], a monster secretly built from parts of humans, demons and machinery, escapes and begins to wreak havoc on the town. Adam is destroyed by a magical composite of Buffy and her three friends, and The Initiative is shut down.\n\nDuring [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 5)|season five]], a younger sister, [[Dawn Summers|Dawn]], suddenly appears in Buffy's life; although she is new to the series, to the characters it is as if she has always been there. Buffy is confronted by [[Glory (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Glory]], an exiled Hell God who is searching for a [[The Key (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|\"Key\"]] that will allow her to return to her Hell dimension and in the process blur the lines between dimensions and unleash Hell on Earth. It is later discovered that the Key's protectors have used Buffy's blood to turn the Key into human form \u2013 Dawn \u2013 concurrently implanting everybody with lifelong memories of her. The Watcher's Council aids in Buffy's research on Glory, and she and Giles are both reinstated on their own terms. Riley leaves early in the season after realizing that Buffy does not love him and joins a military demon-hunting operation. Spike, still implanted with the Initiative chip, realizes he is in love with Buffy and increasingly helps the Scoobies in their fight. Buffy's mother [[Joyce Summers|Joyce]] dies of a brain [[aneurysm]], while at the end of the season, Xander proposes to Anya. Glory finally discovers that Dawn is the key and kidnaps her, using Dawn's blood to open a portal to the Hell dimension. To save Dawn, Buffy sacrifices her own life by diving into the portal and thus closes it with her death.\n\nAt the beginning of [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 6)|season six]], Buffy has been dead for 147 days, but Buffy's friends resurrect her through a powerful spell, believing they have rescued her from a Hell dimension. Buffy returns in a deep depression, explaining (several episodes later) that she had been in [[Heaven]] and is devastated to be pulled back to Earth. Giles returns to England because he has concluded that Buffy has become too reliant on him, while Buffy takes up a fast-food job to support herself and Dawn, and develops a secret, mutually abusive sexual relationship with Spike. Dawn suffers from [[kleptomania]] and feelings of alienation, Xander leaves Anya at the altar (after which she once again becomes a vengeance demon), and Willow becomes addicted to magic, causing Tara to temporarily leave her. They also begin to deal with [[Trio (Buffyverse)|The Trio]], a group of [[nerd]]s led by [[Warren Mears]] who use their proficiency in technology and magic to attempt to kill Buffy and take over Sunnydale. Warren is shown to be the only competent villain of the group and, after Buffy thwarts his plans multiple times and the Trio breaks apart, he becomes unhinged and attacks Buffy with a gun, accidentally killing Tara in the process. This causes Willow to descend into nihilistic darkness and unleash all of her dark magical powers, killing Warren and attempting to kill his friends. Giles returns to face her in battle and infuses her with light magic, tapping into her remaining humanity. This overwhelms Willow with guilt and pain, whereupon she attempts to destroy the world to end everyone's suffering, although it eventually allows Xander to reach through her pain and end her rampage. Late in the season, after losing control and trying to rape Buffy, Spike leaves Sunnydale and travels to see a demon and asks him to \"return him to what he used to be\" so that he can \"give Buffy what she deserves\". After Spike passes a series of brutal tests, the demon restores his soul.\n\nDuring [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 7)|season seven]], it is revealed that Buffy's second resurrection caused instability that is allowing the First Evil to begin tipping the balance between good and evil. It begins by hunting down and killing inactive [[Potential Slayers]], and soon raises an army of ancient, powerful [[Turok-Han]] vampires. After the Watchers' Council is destroyed, a number of Potential Slayers (some brought by Giles) take refuge in Buffy's house. Faith returns to help fight The First Evil, and the new Sunnydale High School's principal, [[Robin Wood (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Robin Wood]], also joins the cause. The Turok-Han vampires and a sinister, [[misogyny|misogynistic]] preacher known as [[Caleb (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Caleb]] begin causing havoc for the Scoobies. As the Hellmouth becomes more active, nearly all of Sunnydale's population \u2013 humans and demons alike \u2013 flee. In the series finale, Buffy kills Caleb, and Angel returns to Sunnydale with an amulet, which Buffy gives to Spike; the Scoobies then surround the Hellmouth and the Potential Slayers descend into its cavern, while Willow casts a spell that activates their Slayer powers. Anya dies in the fight, as do some of the new Slayers. Spike's amulet channels the power of the sun to destroy the Hellmouth and all the vampires within it, including himself. The collapse of the cavern creates a crater that swallows all of Sunnydale, while the survivors of the battle escape in a [[school bus]]. In the final scene, as the survivors survey the crater, Dawn asks, \"What are we going to do now?\" Buffy slowly begins to enigmatically smile as she contemplates the future ahead of her, ending the series on a hopeful note.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Joss Whedon by Gage Skidmore 8.jpg|200px|thumb|''Buffy'' creator Joss Whedon also served as executive producer, head writer, and director on the series.]]\nWriter [[Joss Whedon]] says that \"Rhonda the Immortal Waitress\" was really the first incarnation of the ''Buffy'' concept, \"the idea of some woman who seems to be completely insignificant who turns out to be extraordinary\".<ref>{{cite AV media |title=''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'': Television with a Bite |people=Jack Walworth (Director), [[Bill Mumy]] (Narrator) |series=[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]] |via=''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 6)#DVD release|Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Season 6)]]'' DVD set, disc 6 ([[DVD region code|region 1]] release: May 25, 2004) |date=May 14, 2003 |minutes=2:15 |publisher=[[A&E Network]]}}</ref> This early, unproduced idea evolved into ''Buffy'', which Whedon developed to invert the Hollywood formula of \"the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every [[horror film|horror movie]]\".<ref name=blondegirl>{{cite book |last=Billson |first=Anne |title=Buffy the Vampire Slayer |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |date=December 5, 2005 |pages=24\u201325|title-link=Buffy the Vampire Slayer (BFI TV Classics) }}</ref> Whedon wanted \"to subvert that idea and create someone who was a hero\".<ref name=blondegirl /> He explained, \"The very first mission statement of the show was the joy of female power: having it, using it, sharing it.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Gottlieb |first=Allie |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/09.26.02/buffy1-0239.html |title=Buffy's Angels |publisher=Metroactive.com |date=September 26, 2002}}</ref>\n\nThe idea was first visited through Whedon's script for the 1992 movie ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', which featured [[Kristy Swanson]] in the title role.

Then the episode's story was \"broken\" into acts and scenes. Act breaks were designed as key moments to intrigue viewers so that they would stay with the episode following the [[television advertisement|commercial break]]. The writers collectively filled in scenes surrounding these act breaks for a more fleshed-out story. A whiteboard marked their progress by mapping brief descriptions of each scene. Once \"breaking\" was done, the credited author wrote an outline for the episode, which was checked by Whedon or Noxon. The writer then wrote a full script, which went through a series of drafts, and finally a quick rewrite from the showrunner. The final article was used as the shooting script.\n\n===Broadcast history and syndication===\n[[File:UPN Promo Buffy Season 6.jpg|thumb|upright|UPN took great advantage promoting the network switch by teasing fans of Buffy's resurrection from The WB's series finale.]]\n''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' first aired on March 10, 1997, (as a mid season replacement for the show ''[[Savannah (TV series)|Savannah]]'') on the [[The WB Television Network|WB network]], and played a key role in the growth of the [[Warner Bros.]] television network in its early years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf |title=Generation M: Media in the Lives of 8\u201318 Year Olds |publisher=Kff.org |date=March 9, 2005 |accessdate=March 9, 2013 |format=PDF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804080910/http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf |archivedate=August 4, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author1=Schneider, Michael |author2=Adalian, Josef |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117946199?cs=1&s=h&p=0 |title=WB revisits glory days |work=Variety |date=June 29, 2006 |accessdate=March 9, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218025029/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117946199?cs=1&s=h&p=0 |archivedate=February 18, 2012}}</ref> After five seasons, it transferred to the United Paramount Network ([[UPN]]) for its final two seasons.

Hannigan decided on an upbeat and happy delivery of the line \"most of it\", as opposed to a sad, depressed delivery. Hannigan figured Willow would be happy and proud that she got \"most of it\" back.

The series was created by ''Buffy'''s creator [[Joss Whedon]] in collaboration with [[David Greenwalt]]. Like ''Buffy'', it was produced by the production company [[Mutant Enemy Productions|Mutant Enemy]]. At times, it performed better in the [[Nielsen ratings]] than its parent series did.<ref name = \"insightbb-buffy\"/>\n\nThe series was given a darker tone, focusing on the ongoing trials of Angel in Los Angeles. His character is tormented by guilt following the return of his soul, punishment for more than a century of murder and torture. During the first four seasons of the show, he works as a [[private detective]] in a fictionalized version of [[Los Angeles, California]], where he and his associates work to \"help the helpless\", to restore the faith and \"save the souls\" of those who have lost their way. Typically, this mission involves doing battle with demons or demonically allied humans (primarily the law firm Wolfram & Hart), while Angel must also contend with his own violent nature. In season five, the Senior Partners of Wolfram and Hart take a bold gamble in their campaign to corrupt Angel, giving him control of their Los Angeles office. Angel accepts the deal as an opportunity to fight evil from the inside.\n\nIn addition to Boreanaz, ''Angel'' inherited ''Buffy'' series cast regular [[Charisma Carpenter]] ([[Cordelia Chase]]). When [[Glenn Quinn]] ([[Doyle (Angel)|Doyle]]) left the series during its first season, [[Alexis Denisof]] ([[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce]]), who played a recurring character in the last nine episodes of season three of ''Buffy'', took his place. Carpenter and Denisof were followed later by [[Mercedes McNab]] ([[Harmony Kendall]]) and [[James Marsters]] ([[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]]). Several actors and actresses who played ''Buffy'' characters made guest appearances on ''Angel'', including [[Seth Green]] ([[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne]]), [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] ([[Buffy Summers]]), [[Eliza Dushku]] ([[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]]), [[Tom Lenk]] ([[Andrew Wells]]), [[Alyson Hannigan]] ([[Willow Rosenberg]]), [[Julie Benz]] ([[Darla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Darla]]), [[Mark Metcalf]] ([[Master (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Master]]), [[Julia Lee (actress)|Julia Lee]] ([[Anne Steele (Buffyverse)|Anne Steele]]) and [[Juliet Landau]] ([[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]]). Angel also continued to appear occasionally on ''Buffy''.\n\nOther actors that appeared in both the ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ''Angel'' series but as different characters include: Bob Fimiani as Mr. Ward, a head of the Department of Defense in ''Buffy'' and Glith-roo, a Codger Demon in ''Angel''; [[Carlos Jacott]] as a demon named Ken in ''Buffy'' and a different demon named Richard Stanley in ''Angel''; [[Jonathan M. Woodward]] as a vampire and former classmate in ''Buffy'' named Holden Webster and Knox, a Wolfram and Heart scientist in ''Angel''; and [[Andy Umberger]] who played a demon name D'Hoffryn in ''Buffy'' and predator named Ronald Meltzer in ''Angel''.\n\nThe storyline has been continued in the comic book series ''[[Angel: After the Fall]]'' published by [[IDW Publishing]] and later ''[[Angel and Faith]]'' published by [[Dark Horse Comics]].\n\n===Expanded universe===\n{{Main|Buffyverse canon|Buffy the Vampire Slayer video games|List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer novels|List of Buffyverse comics}}\n[[File:Long way home tpb.jpg|thumb|upright|Trade paperback cover of ''Buffy: Season Eight'' [[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|Volume One]], written by Joss Whedon.]]\nOutside of the TV series, the Buffyverse has been officially expanded and elaborated on by authors and artists in the so-called \"Buffyverse [[Expanded Universe]]\".

Following the publication of ''[[Tales of the Vampires]]'' in 2004, ''Dark Horse Comics'' halted publication on Buffyverse-related comics and graphic novels. The company produced Whedon's ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight]]'' with forty issues from March 2007 to January 2011, picking up where the television show left off\u2014taking the place of an eighth [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] season.<ref name=\"ew-firstlook\"/> The first story arc is also written by Whedon, and is called \"[[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|The Long Way Home]]\" which has been widely well-received, with circulation rivaling industry leaders [[DC Comics|DC]] and [[Marvel Comics|Marvel's]] top-selling titles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://comicsbeat.com/dc-comics-month-to-month-sales-april-2007/ |title=DC Comics Month-to-month Sales: April 2007 |date=June 5, 2007 |accessdate=June 4, 2007 |publisher=The Beat}}</ref> Also after \"[[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|The Long Way Home]]\" came other story arcs like Faith's return in \"[[No Future for You]]\" and a ''Fray'' cross-over in \"[[Time of Your Life (Buffy comic)|Time of Your Life]]\". Dark Horse later followed ''Season Eight'' with ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine]]'', starting in 2011, and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten]]'', which began in 2014. Dark Horse continued to publish ''Buffy'' comics continuing the story after the television show until September 2018 when they released the final issue of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Twelve]]'' which intended to bring closure to the series. Following the end of Dark Horse's ''Buffy'' series, [[Boom! Studios]] acquired the license to publish ''Buffy'' comics. Taking a different approach from Dark Horse, Boom! Studios decided to publish a new rebooted ''Buffy'' series in 2019 with many elements updated to be more contemporary. Boom!

[[20th Century Fox Television|20th Century Fox]] showed an interest in developing and selling the show to another network. A three-minute pilot was completed in 2004 but was never picked up.

[[UPN]] in 2001, viewing figures had fallen. The series' high came during the third season, with 5.3 million viewers (including repeats). This was probably due to the fact that both Gellar and Hannigan had hit movies out during the season (''[[Cruel Intentions]]'' and ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' respectively). The series' low was in season one at 3.7 million. The show's series finale \"[[Chosen (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Chosen]]\" pulled in a season high of 4.9&nbsp;million viewers on the UPN network.<ref name=\"s7 ratings\">{{cite web |url=http://tv.zap2it.com/news/tvnewsdaily.html?31651 |title='Buffy' Finale Stakes Strong Ratings for UPN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030524173301/http://tv.zap2it.com/news/tvnewsdaily.html?31651 |archivedate=May 24, 2003 |date=May 21, 2003 |accessdate=December 29, 2012 |publisher=Zap2it}}</ref>\n\n''Buffy'' did not compete with shows on the main four networks ([[CBS]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]), but The WB was impressed with the young audience that the show was bringing in. Because of this, The WB ordered a full season of 22 episodes for the series' second season. Beginning with the episode \"[[Innocence (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Innocence]]\", which was watched by 8.2&nbsp;million people, ''Buffy'' was moved from Monday at 9:00&nbsp;pm to launch The WB's new night of programming on Tuesday. Due to its large success in that time slot, it remained on Tuesdays at 8:00&nbsp;pm for the remainder of its original run. With its new timeslot on The WB, the show quickly climbed to the top of The WB ratings and became one of their highest-rated shows for the remainder of its time on the network. The show always placed in the top 3, usually only coming in behind ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]''. Between seasons three and five, ''Buffy'' flip-flopped with ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' and ''[[Charmed]]'' as the network's second highest-rated show.\n\nIn the 2001\u20132002 season, the show had moved to UPN after a negotiation dispute with The WB. While it was still one of the highest rated shows on their network, The WB felt that the show had already peaked and was not worth giving a salary increase to the cast and crew. UPN on the other hand had strong faith in the series and picked it up for a two-season renewal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2001-04-23/entertainment/buffy_1_dean-valentine-key-upn-affiliates-buffy?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ |title='Buffy' picks up stakes, leaves WB for UPN |publisher=CNN |date=April 23, 2001 |accessdate=December 29, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211104047/http://articles.cnn.com/2001-04-23/entertainment/buffy_1_dean-valentine-key-upn-affiliates-buffy?_s=PM%3ASHOWBIZ |archivedate=December 11, 2011}}</ref> UPN dedicated a two-hour premiere to the series to help re-launch it.

Buffy wants to live a normal life, but as the series progresses, she learns to embrace her destiny. Like previous Slayers, Buffy is aided by a [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watcher]], who guides, teaches, and trains her. Unlike her predecessors, Buffy surrounds herself with a circle of loyal friends who become known as the \"Scooby Gang\".\n\nThe series received critical and popular acclaim, frequently being listed as one of the greatest TV shows of all time,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thisisinsider.com/best-tv-shows-of-all-time-2017-6#buffy-the-vampire-slayer-1997-to-2003-12|title=50 TV shows everyone should watch in their lifetime|work=INSIDER|first=Jacob|last=Shamsian|date=March 8, 2018|access-date=October 16, 2018}}</ref> and usually reached between four and six million viewers on original airings.<ref name = \"insightbb-buffy\">{{cite web |author=Wahoske, Matthew J. |url=http://home.insightbb.com/~wahoskem/buffy.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216043137/http://home.insightbb.com/~wahoskem/buffy.html |archivedate=February 16, 2008 |title=Nielsen Ratings For Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Angel, And Firefly |work=Insightbb.com}}</ref> Although such [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] are lower than successful shows on the \"big four\" networks ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[NBC]], and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Orders/2001/fcc01133.txt |title=The Dual Network Rule |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |date=May 15, 2001 |quote=[T]he four major broadcast networks are unique among the media in their ability to reach a wide audience}}</ref> they were a success for the relatively new and smaller WB Television Network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf#search=%22%20Dawson's%20Creek%2C%20Buffy%20is%20often%20associated%20with%20the%20early%20success%20of%20the%20Warner%20Brothers%20Network.%22 |title=Generation M: Media in the Lives of 8\u201318 Year Olds |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |date=March 9, 2005 |quote=Mr. Levin was a key player in establishing The WB's distinct brand and youth appeal through programming such as ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'', ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'', ''[[Charmed]]'', ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'', ''[[Everwood]]'', and ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804080910/http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf |archivedate=August 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\nDespite the fact that ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' was almost entirely ignored by major award shows during its run, the series was nominated for the [[American Film Institute Awards 2001|American Film Institute Award for Drama Series of the Year]], Gellar was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Television Series Drama]] for her performance in the show, and the series was nominated five times for [[TCA Awards|Television Critics Association Awards]], winning once in 2003 for the [[19th TCA Awards|Television Critics Association Heritage Award]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.goldderby.com/article/2017/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-20-years-later-emmys/ |title=\u2018Buffy the Vampire Slayer\u2019: 20 years later, it still remains Emmy\u2019s biggest snub |website=Gold Derby |first=Ralph |last=Galvan |date=March 10, 2017 |accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/article/2002/09/10/five-reasons-buffy-gets-snubbed-emmys/ |title=Five reasons ''Buffy'' gets snubbed by the Emmys |website=Entertainment Weekly |first=Ken |last=Tucker |date=September 10, 2002 |accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/biggest-emmys-snubs-all-time/ |title=14 Jaw-Dropping Emmys Snubs We're Still Not Over |website=TV Guide |first=Kaitlin |last=Thomas |date=September 18, 2016 |accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe success of ''Buffy'' has led to hundreds of tie-in products, including [[List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer novels|novels]], [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer comics|comics]], and [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer video games|video games]].

Giles, rarely referred to by his first name (it is later revealed that in his rebellious younger days he went by \"Ripper\"), is a member of the [[Watchers' Council]], whose job is to train and guide the Slayers. Giles researches the supernatural creatures that Buffy must face, offers insights into their origins and advice on how to defeat them, and helps her train to stay in fighting form.\n\nBuffy is also helped by friends she meets at Sunnydale High: [[Willow Rosenberg]] ([[Alyson Hannigan]]) and [[Xander Harris]] ([[Nicholas Brendon]]). Willow is originally a [[Wallflower (people)|wallflower]] who excels at academics, providing a contrast to Buffy's outgoing personality and less-than-stellar educational record. They share the social isolation that comes with being different, and especially from being exceptional young women. As the series progresses, Willow becomes a more assertive character and a powerful witch, and [[coming out|comes out]] as a [[lesbian]]. In contrast, Xander, with no supernatural abilities, provides [[comic relief]] and a grounded perspective. It is Xander who often provides the heart to the series, and in season six, becomes the hero in place of Buffy who defeats the \"[[Big Bad]]\". Buffy and Willow are the only characters who appear in all 144 episodes; Xander is missing in [[Conversations with Dead People|only one]].\n\nThe cast of characters grew over the course of the series. Buffy first arrives in Sunnydale with her mother, [[Joyce Summers]] (portrayed by [[Kristine Sutherland]]), who functions as an anchor of normality in the Summers' lives even after she learns of Buffy's role in the supernatural world (\"[[Becoming, Part Two]]\"). Buffy's younger sister [[Dawn Summers]] ([[Michelle Trachtenberg]]) is introduced in season five (\"[[Buffy vs. Dracula]]\"). A vampire tortured with a soul in return for horrific deeds committed in the past to many, including a young gypsy girl and her family, [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] (portrayed by [[David Boreanaz]]), is Buffy's love interest throughout the first three seasons. He leaves Buffy after realizing he will never be able to give her a normal life. He goes on to make amends for his sins and to search for redemption in his own spin-off, ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]''. He makes several guest appearances in the remaining seasons, including the last episode.\n\nAt Sunnydale High, Buffy meets several other students besides Willow and Xander willing to join her fight for good, an informal group eventually tagged the \"Scooby Gang\" or \"Scoobies\". [[Cordelia Chase]] ([[Charisma Carpenter]]), the archetypal shallow cheerleader, reluctantly becomes involved. [[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne]] ([[Seth Green]]), a fellow student, rock guitarist and werewolf, joins the group through his relationship with Willow. [[Jenny Calendar]] ([[Robia LaMorte]]), Sunnydale's computer science teacher, joins the group after helping destroy a demon trapped in cyberspace during season 1. She later becomes Giles' love interest. [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]] ([[Emma Caulfield]]), a former vengeance demon (Anyanka) who specialized in avenging scorned women, becomes Xander's lover after losing her powers and joins the group in season four.\n\nIn Buffy's senior year at high school, she meets [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]] ([[Eliza Dushku]]), the other current Slayer, who was \"called\" forth when Slayer [[Kendra (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Kendra Young]] ([[Bianca Lawson]]) was killed by vampire [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]] ([[Juliet Landau]]), in season two. Although Faith initially fights on the side of good with Buffy and the rest of the group, she comes to stand against them and sides with [[Richard Wilkins (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Mayor Richard Wilkins]] ([[Harry Groener]]) after accidentally killing a human in season three. She reappears briefly in the fourth season, looking for vengeance, and moves to ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' where she voluntarily goes to jail for her murders. Faith reappears in season seven of ''Buffy'', after having helped Angel and his crew, and fights alongside Buffy against The First Evil.\n\nBuffy gathers other allies: [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] ([[James Marsters]]), a vampire, is an old companion of Angelus (Angel) and one of Buffy's major enemies in early seasons, although they later become allies and lovers. At the end of season six, Spike regains his soul. Spike is known for his [[Billy Idol]]-style [[peroxide blond]] hair and his black leather coat, stolen from a previous Slayer, [[Nikki Wood]]; her son, [[Robin Wood (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Robin Wood]] ([[D. B. Woodside]]), joins the group in the final season. [[Tara Maclay]] ([[Amber Benson]]) is a fellow member of Willow's [[Wicca]] group during season four, and their friendship eventually turns into a romantic relationship. Buffy becomes involved personally and professionally with [[Riley Finn]] ([[Marc Blucas]]), a military operative in \"the Initiative\", which hunts demons using science and technology. The final season sees [[geek]]y wannabe-villain [[Andrew Wells]] ([[Tom Lenk]]) come to side with the Scoobies after initially being their captive/hostage; they regard him more as a nuisance than an ally.\n\n''Buffy'' featured dozens of recurring characters, both major and minor. For example, the \"Big Bad\" (villain) characters were featured for at least one season (for example, [[Glory (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Glory]] is a character who appeared in 12 episodes, spanning much of season five). Similarly, characters who allied themselves to the group and characters who attended the same institutions were sometimes featured in multiple episodes.\n\n===Setting and filming locations===\n{{Main|Sunnydale}}\n[[File:Torrance High School.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Torrance High School]] was used for the fictional Sunnydale High School.]]\nThe show is set in the fictional California town of Sunnydale, whose suburban [[Sunnydale High|Sunnydale High School]] sits on top of a \"Hellmouth\", a gateway to demon realms. The Hellmouth, located beneath the school library, is a source of mystical energies as well as a [[wikt:nexus|nexus]] for a wide variety of evil creatures and supernatural phenomena. In addition to being an open-ended plot device, Joss Whedon has cited the Hellmouth and \"[[High school (North America)|High school]] as [[Hell]]\" as one of the primary metaphors in creating the series.<ref>Yovanovich, Linda, \"Young Blood\", ''Smgfan.com'', originally from ''OnSat'' (July 14, 1997), Whedon said: \"[High school as hell] was always the basis of the show. When they said, 'Do you want to turn it into a show?' The character was not enough alone to sustain it. But you know when I thought of the idea of the horror movies as a metaphor for high school, [I said] okay this is something that will work week to week.\"</ref>\n\nMost of ''Buffy'' was shot on location in [[Los Angeles, California]]. The high school used in the first three seasons is actually [[Torrance High School]], in [[Torrance, California]], the same high school used for [[Beverly Hills, 90210]].<ref name=\"torrence\">\"[http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/b/buffy.html Buffy the Vampire Slayer film locations]\", ''Movie-locations.com''</ref> The show was initially very dependent on location shooting, because the production budget allowed for few permanent sets to be built.<ref name=\"autogenerated1998\">{{cite video |title=Designing Buffy Featurette |medium=dvd |year=1998 |publisher=20th Century Fox Home Video}}</ref> In Season One this was limited to the interior of Sunnydale High (the library, hallways, and classrooms), Buffy's bedroom, and the Master's underground lair.

While the show is mainly a [[drama]] with frequent [[comic relief]], most episodes blend different [[genre]]s, including [[horror film|horror]], [[martial arts]], [[Romance film|romance]], [[melodrama]], [[farce]], [[science fiction]], [[Screwball comedy film|comedy]], and even, in [[Once More, with Feeling (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|one episode]], [[musical comedy]].\n\nThe series' narrative revolves around Buffy and her friends, collectively dubbed the \"Scooby Gang\", who struggle to balance the fight against [[supernatural]] evils with their complex social lives.<ref name=\"FtF-Intro\" /> The show mixes complex, season-long storylines with a [[Villain of the week|villain-of-the-week]] format; a typical episode contains one or more [[villain]]s, or supernatural phenomena, that are thwarted or defeated by the end of the episode. Though elements and relationships are explored and ongoing subplots are included, the show focuses primarily on Buffy and her role as an [[archetype|archetypal]] [[hero]]ine. Gellar described the show as \"the ultimate metaphor: horrors of adolescence manifesting through these actual monsters. It's the hardest time of life.\"<ref name = \"Guardian 21 July 2018\">{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jul/21/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-to-be-remade-21-years-after-first-episode |title=Buffy the Vampire Slayer to be remade 21 years after first episode |date=July 21, 2018 |accessdate=July 22, 2018 |first=Vanessa |last=Thorpe}}</ref>\n\nIn the first few seasons, the most prominent monsters in the [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings|''Buffy'' bestiary]] are [[Vampire (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|vampires]], which are based on traditional myths, lore, and literary conventions. As the series continues, Buffy and her companions fight an increasing variety of [[Grimslaw demon|demons]], as well as [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Ghosts and spirits|ghosts]], [[Werewolf|werewolves]], [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Undead|zombies]], and [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Dangerous Mortals|unscrupulous humans]].

PLEASE DO NOT ENLARGE IT. ALSO, KEEP IN MIND THIS SECTION NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD BY PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT BTVS. KEEP IT SIMPLE! -->\n\n[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 1)|Season one]] exemplifies the \"high school is hell\" concept. [[Buffy Summers]] has just moved to [[Sunnydale]] after burning down her old school's gym, and hopes to escape her Slayer duties. Her plans are complicated by [[Rupert Giles]], her new [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watcher]], who reminds her of the inescapable presence of evil. Sunnydale High is built atop a Hellmouth, a portal to demon dimensions that attracts supernatural phenomena to the area. Buffy befriends two schoolmates, [[Xander Harris]] and [[Willow Rosenberg]], who help her fight evil throughout the series, but they must first prevent [[Master (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Master]], an ancient and especially threatening vampire, from opening the Hellmouth and taking over Sunnydale.\n\nThe emotional stakes are raised in [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 2)|season two]]. Vampires [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] and [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]] (weakened from a mob in [[Prague]], which, it is implied, caused her debilitating injury), come to town along with a new slayer, [[Kendra Young]], who was activated as a result of Buffy's brief death in the [[Prophecy Girl|season one finale]]. Xander becomes involved with [[Cordelia Chase|Cordelia]], while Willow becomes involved with witchcraft and [[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne]], who is a werewolf. The romantic relationship between Buffy and the vampire [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] develops over the course of the season, but after they have sex, Angel's soul, given to him by a Gypsy curse in the past, is lost, and he once more becomes Angelus, a sadistic killer. Kendra is killed by a restored Drusilla. Angelus torments much of the \"Scooby Gang\" throughout the rest of the season and murders multiple innocents and Giles' new girlfriend [[Jenny Calendar]], a [[Romani people|gypsy]] who was sent to maintain Angel's curse. To avert an apocalypse, Buffy is forced to banish Angel to a demon dimension just moments after Willow has restored his soul. The ordeal leaves Buffy emotionally shattered, and she leaves Sunnydale.\n\nAfter attempting to start a new life in Los Angeles, Buffy returns to town in [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 3)|season three]]. Angel has mysteriously been released from the demon dimension, but is close to insanity due to the torment he suffered there, and is nearly driven to [[suicide]] by the [[First Evil]]. He and Buffy realize that a relationship between them can never happen; he eventually leaves Sunnydale at the end of the season. A new watcher named Wesley is put in Giles' place when Giles is fired from the Watcher's Council because he has developed a \"father's love\" for Buffy; and towards the end of the season, Buffy announces that she will no longer be working for the Council. Early in the season, she meets [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]], the Slayer activated after Kendra's death. She also encounters the affable [[Mayor (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Mayor Richard Wilkins]], who secretly has plans to \"ascend\" (become a \"pure\" demon) on Sunnydale High's Graduation Day. Although Faith initially works well with Buffy, she becomes increasingly unstable after accidentally killing a human and forms a relationship with the paternal yet manipulative Mayor, eventually landing in a coma after a fight with Buffy. At the end of the season, after the Mayor becomes a huge snake-like demon, Buffy and the entire graduating class destroy him by blowing up Sunnydale High.\n\n[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 4)|Season four]] sees Buffy and Willow enroll at [[University of California|UC]] Sunnydale, while Xander joins the workforce and begins dating [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]], a former vengeance demon. Spike returns as a series regular and is abducted by The Initiative, a top-secret military installation based beneath the UC Sunnydale campus. They implant a [[Integrated circuit|microchip]] in his head that punishes him whenever he tries to harm a human. He makes a truce with the Scooby Gang and begins to fight on their side, purely for the joy of fighting, upon learning that he can still harm other demons. Oz leaves town after realizing that he is too dangerous as a werewolf, and Willow falls in love with [[Tara Maclay]], another witch. Buffy begins dating [[Riley Finn]], a graduate student and member of The Initiative. Although appearing to be a well-meaning anti-demon operation, The Initiative's sinister plans are revealed when [[Adam (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Adam]], a monster secretly built from parts of humans, demons and machinery, escapes and begins to wreak havoc on the town. Adam is destroyed by a magical composite of Buffy and her three friends, and The Initiative is shut down.\n\nDuring [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 5)|season five]], a younger sister, [[Dawn Summers|Dawn]], suddenly appears in Buffy's life; although she is new to the series, to the characters it is as if she has always been there. Buffy is confronted by [[Glory (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Glory]], an exiled Hell God who is searching for a [[The Key (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|\"Key\"]] that will allow her to return to her Hell dimension and in the process blur the lines between dimensions and unleash Hell on Earth. It is later discovered that the Key's protectors have used Buffy's blood to turn the Key into human form \u2013 Dawn \u2013 concurrently implanting everybody with lifelong memories of her. The Watcher's Council aids in Buffy's research on Glory, and she and Giles are both reinstated on their own terms. Riley leaves early in the season after realizing that Buffy does not love him and joins a military demon-hunting operation. Spike, still implanted with the Initiative chip, realizes he is in love with Buffy and increasingly helps the Scoobies in their fight. Buffy's mother [[Joyce Summers|Joyce]] dies of a brain [[aneurysm]], while at the end of the season, Xander proposes to Anya. Glory finally discovers that Dawn is the key and kidnaps her, using Dawn's blood to open a portal to the Hell dimension. To save Dawn, Buffy sacrifices her own life by diving into the portal and thus closes it with her death.\n\nAt the beginning of [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 6)|season six]], Buffy has been dead for 147 days, but Buffy's friends resurrect her through a powerful spell, believing they have rescued her from a Hell dimension. Buffy returns in a deep depression, explaining (several episodes later) that she had been in [[Heaven]] and is devastated to be pulled back to Earth. Giles returns to England because he has concluded that Buffy has become too reliant on him, while Buffy takes up a fast-food job to support herself and Dawn, and develops a secret, mutually abusive sexual relationship with Spike. Dawn suffers from [[kleptomania]] and feelings of alienation, Xander leaves Anya at the altar (after which she once again becomes a vengeance demon), and Willow becomes addicted to magic, causing Tara to temporarily leave her. They also begin to deal with [[Trio (Buffyverse)|The Trio]], a group of [[nerd]]s led by [[Warren Mears]] who use their proficiency in technology and magic to attempt to kill Buffy and take over Sunnydale. Warren is shown to be the only competent villain of the group and, after Buffy thwarts his plans multiple times and the Trio breaks apart, he becomes unhinged and attacks Buffy with a gun, accidentally killing Tara in the process. This causes Willow to descend into nihilistic darkness and unleash all of her dark magical powers, killing Warren and attempting to kill his friends. Giles returns to face her in battle and infuses her with light magic, tapping into her remaining humanity. This overwhelms Willow with guilt and pain, whereupon she attempts to destroy the world to end everyone's suffering, although it eventually allows Xander to reach through her pain and end her rampage. Late in the season, after losing control and trying to rape Buffy, Spike leaves Sunnydale and travels to see a demon and asks him to \"return him to what he used to be\" so that he can \"give Buffy what she deserves\". After Spike passes a series of brutal tests, the demon restores his soul.\n\nDuring [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 7)|season seven]], it is revealed that Buffy's second resurrection caused instability that is allowing the First Evil to begin tipping the balance between good and evil. It begins by hunting down and killing inactive [[Potential Slayers]], and soon raises an army of ancient, powerful [[Turok-Han]] vampires. After the Watchers' Council is destroyed, a number of Potential Slayers (some brought by Giles) take refuge in Buffy's house. Faith returns to help fight The First Evil, and the new Sunnydale High School's principal, [[Robin Wood (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Robin Wood]], also joins the cause. The Turok-Han vampires and a sinister, [[misogyny|misogynistic]] preacher known as [[Caleb (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Caleb]] begin causing havoc for the Scoobies. As the Hellmouth becomes more active, nearly all of Sunnydale's population \u2013 humans and demons alike \u2013 flee. In the series finale, Buffy kills Caleb, and Angel returns to Sunnydale with an amulet, which Buffy gives to Spike; the Scoobies then surround the Hellmouth and the Potential Slayers descend into its cavern, while Willow casts a spell that activates their Slayer powers.

Then the episode's story was \"broken\" into acts and scenes. Act breaks were designed as key moments to intrigue viewers so that they would stay with the episode following the [[television advertisement|commercial break]]. The writers collectively filled in scenes surrounding these act breaks for a more fleshed-out story. A whiteboard marked their progress by mapping brief descriptions of each scene. Once \"breaking\" was done, the credited author wrote an outline for the episode, which was checked by Whedon or Noxon. The writer then wrote a full script, which went through a series of drafts, and finally a quick rewrite from the showrunner. The final article was used as the shooting script.\n\n===Broadcast history and syndication===\n[[File:UPN Promo Buffy Season 6.jpg|thumb|upright|UPN took great advantage promoting the network switch by teasing fans of Buffy's resurrection from The WB's series finale.]]\n''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' first aired on March 10, 1997, (as a mid season replacement for the show ''[[Savannah (TV series)|Savannah]]'') on the [[The WB Television Network|WB network]], and played a key role in the growth of the [[Warner Bros.]] television network in its early years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf |title=Generation M: Media in the Lives of 8\u201318 Year Olds |publisher=Kff.org |date=March 9, 2005 |accessdate=March 9, 2013 |format=PDF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804080910/http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf |archivedate=August 4, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author1=Schneider, Michael |author2=Adalian, Josef |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117946199?cs=1&s=h&p=0 |title=WB revisits glory days |work=Variety |date=June 29, 2006 |accessdate=March 9, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218025029/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117946199?cs=1&s=h&p=0 |archivedate=February 18, 2012}}</ref> After five seasons, it transferred to the United Paramount Network ([[UPN]]) for its final two seasons.

Buffy asks her if she ever got it back. Willow's line was to reply \"most of it\". Hannigan decided on an upbeat and happy delivery of the line \"most of it\", as opposed to a sad, depressed delivery. Hannigan figured Willow would be happy and proud that she got \"most of it\" back.

At times, it performed better in the [[Nielsen ratings]] than its parent series did.<ref name = \"insightbb-buffy\"/>\n\nThe series was given a darker tone, focusing on the ongoing trials of Angel in Los Angeles. His character is tormented by guilt following the return of his soul, punishment for more than a century of murder and torture. During the first four seasons of the show, he works as a [[private detective]] in a fictionalized version of [[Los Angeles, California]], where he and his associates work to \"help the helpless\", to restore the faith and \"save the souls\" of those who have lost their way. Typically, this mission involves doing battle with demons or demonically allied humans (primarily the law firm Wolfram & Hart), while Angel must also contend with his own violent nature. In season five, the Senior Partners of Wolfram and Hart take a bold gamble in their campaign to corrupt Angel, giving him control of their Los Angeles office. Angel accepts the deal as an opportunity to fight evil from the inside.\n\nIn addition to Boreanaz, ''Angel'' inherited ''Buffy'' series cast regular [[Charisma Carpenter]] ([[Cordelia Chase]]). When [[Glenn Quinn]] ([[Doyle (Angel)|Doyle]]) left the series during its first season, [[Alexis Denisof]] ([[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce]]), who played a recurring character in the last nine episodes of season three of ''Buffy'', took his place. Carpenter and Denisof were followed later by [[Mercedes McNab]] ([[Harmony Kendall]]) and [[James Marsters]] ([[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]]). Several actors and actresses who played ''Buffy'' characters made guest appearances on ''Angel'', including [[Seth Green]] ([[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne]]), [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] ([[Buffy Summers]]), [[Eliza Dushku]] ([[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]]), [[Tom Lenk]] ([[Andrew Wells]]), [[Alyson Hannigan]] ([[Willow Rosenberg]]), [[Julie Benz]] ([[Darla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Darla]]), [[Mark Metcalf]] ([[Master (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Master]]), [[Julia Lee (actress)|Julia Lee]] ([[Anne Steele (Buffyverse)|Anne Steele]]) and [[Juliet Landau]] ([[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]]). Angel also continued to appear occasionally on ''Buffy''.\n\nOther actors that appeared in both the ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ''Angel'' series but as different characters include: Bob Fimiani as Mr. Ward, a head of the Department of Defense in ''Buffy'' and Glith-roo, a Codger Demon in ''Angel''; [[Carlos Jacott]] as a demon named Ken in ''Buffy'' and a different demon named Richard Stanley in ''Angel''; [[Jonathan M. Woodward]] as a vampire and former classmate in ''Buffy'' named Holden Webster and Knox, a Wolfram and Heart scientist in ''Angel''; and [[Andy Umberger]] who played a demon name D'Hoffryn in ''Buffy'' and predator named Ronald Meltzer in ''Angel''.\n\nThe storyline has been continued in the comic book series ''[[Angel: After the Fall]]'' published by [[IDW Publishing]] and later ''[[Angel and Faith]]'' published by [[Dark Horse Comics]].\n\n===Expanded universe===\n{{Main|Buffyverse canon|Buffy the Vampire Slayer video games|List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer novels|List of Buffyverse comics}}\n[[File:Long way home tpb.jpg|thumb|upright|Trade paperback cover of ''Buffy: Season Eight'' [[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|Volume One]], written by Joss Whedon.]]\nOutside of the TV series, the Buffyverse has been officially expanded and elaborated on by authors and artists in the so-called \"Buffyverse [[Expanded Universe]]\". The creators of these works may or may not keep to established continuity. Similarly, writers for the TV series were under no obligation to use information which had been established by the Expanded Universe, and sometimes contradicted such continuity.\n\n[[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]] has published the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer comics|''Buffy'' comics]] since 1998.<ref>\"[http://www.darkhorse.com/Comics/98-372-a/Buffy-the-Vampire-Slayer-1-photo-cover Buffy the Vampire Slayer#1]\" ''Dark Horse Comics'' (\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer #1\" released September 23, 1998).</ref> In 2003, Whedon wrote an eight-issue miniseries for Dark Horse Comics titled ''[[Fray (comic)|Fray]]'', about a Slayer in the future. Following the publication of ''[[Tales of the Vampires]]'' in 2004, ''Dark Horse Comics'' halted publication on Buffyverse-related comics and graphic novels. The company produced Whedon's ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight]]'' with forty issues from March 2007 to January 2011, picking up where the television show left off\u2014taking the place of an eighth [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] season.<ref name=\"ew-firstlook\"/> The first story arc is also written by Whedon, and is called \"[[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|The Long Way Home]]\" which has been widely well-received, with circulation rivaling industry leaders [[DC Comics|DC]] and [[Marvel Comics|Marvel's]] top-selling titles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://comicsbeat.com/dc-comics-month-to-month-sales-april-2007/ |title=DC Comics Month-to-month Sales: April 2007 |date=June 5, 2007 |accessdate=June 4, 2007 |publisher=The Beat}}</ref> Also after \"[[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|The Long Way Home]]\" came other story arcs like Faith's return in \"[[No Future for You]]\" and a ''Fray'' cross-over in \"[[Time of Your Life (Buffy comic)|Time of Your Life]]\". Dark Horse later followed ''Season Eight'' with ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine]]'', starting in 2011, and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten]]'', which began in 2014. Dark Horse continued to publish ''Buffy'' comics continuing the story after the television show until September 2018 when they released the final issue of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Twelve]]'' which intended to bring closure to the series. Following the end of Dark Horse's ''Buffy'' series, [[Boom! Studios]] acquired the license to publish ''Buffy'' comics. Taking a different approach from Dark Horse, Boom! Studios decided to publish a new rebooted ''Buffy'' series in 2019 with many elements updated to be more contemporary. Boom!

These projects remain undeveloped and may never be [[greenlight|greenlit]]. In 2002, two potential spinoffs were in discussion: ''[[Buffy: The Animated Series]]'' and [[Undeveloped Buffyverse productions#Ripper|''Ripper'']]. ''Buffy: The Animated Series'' was a proposed animated TV show based on ''Buffy''; Whedon and [[Jeph Loeb]] were to be executive producers for the show, and most of the cast from ''Buffy'' were to return to voice their characters. [[20th Century Fox Television|20th Century Fox]] showed an interest in developing and selling the show to another network. A three-minute pilot was completed in 2004 but was never picked up. Whedon revealed to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'': \"We just could not find a home for it. We had six or seven hilarious scripts from our own staff \u2013 and nobody wanted it.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1889839 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204043/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1889839 |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |title=Dialogue with 'Buffy' creator Joss Whedon |author=Hockensmith, Steve |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=May 16, 2003 |accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref> Neither the pilot nor the scripts have been seen outside of the entertainment industry, though writer [[Jane Espenson]] has teasingly revealed small extracts from some of her scripts for the show.<ref>Espenson, Jane, \"[http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000095.php Reading what's been written to sound written as it's spoken]\", ''Janeespenson.com'' (May 9, 2006) & \"[http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000097.php Sorry, JVC, but it's simply true]\", ''Janeespenson.com'' (May 11, 2006).</ref>\n\n''Ripper'' was originally a proposed television show based upon the character of [[Rupert Giles]] portrayed by [[Anthony Stewart Head]]. More recent information has suggested that if ''Ripper'' were ever made, it would be a TV movie or a [[Direct-to-video|DVD movie]].<ref>''[[Buffyverse Magazines (UK)|UK Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel Magazine]]''.

[[UPN]] in 2001, viewing figures had fallen. The series' high came during the third season, with 5.3 million viewers (including repeats). This was probably due to the fact that both Gellar and Hannigan had hit movies out during the season (''[[Cruel Intentions]]'' and ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' respectively). The series' low was in season one at 3.7 million. The show's series finale \"[[Chosen (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Chosen]]\" pulled in a season high of 4.9&nbsp;million viewers on the UPN network.<ref name=\"s7 ratings\">{{cite web |url=http://tv.zap2it.com/news/tvnewsdaily.html?31651 |title='Buffy' Finale Stakes Strong Ratings for UPN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030524173301/http://tv.zap2it.com/news/tvnewsdaily.html?31651 |archivedate=May 24, 2003 |date=May 21, 2003 |accessdate=December 29, 2012 |publisher=Zap2it}}</ref>\n\n''Buffy'' did not compete with shows on the main four networks ([[CBS]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]), but The WB was impressed with the young audience that the show was bringing in. Because of this, The WB ordered a full season of 22 episodes for the series' second season. Beginning with the episode \"[[Innocence (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Innocence]]\", which was watched by 8.2&nbsp;million people, ''Buffy'' was moved from Monday at 9:00&nbsp;pm to launch The WB's new night of programming on Tuesday. Due to its large success in that time slot, it remained on Tuesdays at 8:00&nbsp;pm for the remainder of its original run. With its new timeslot on The WB, the show quickly climbed to the top of The WB ratings and became one of their highest-rated shows for the remainder of its time on the network. The show always placed in the top 3, usually only coming in behind ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]''. Between seasons three and five, ''Buffy'' flip-flopped with ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' and ''[[Charmed]]'' as the network's second highest-rated show.\n\nIn the 2001\u20132002 season, the show had moved to UPN after a negotiation dispute with The WB. While it was still one of the highest rated shows on their network, The WB felt that the show had already peaked and was not worth giving a salary increase to the cast and crew. UPN on the other hand had strong faith in the series and picked it up for a two-season renewal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2001-04-23/entertainment/buffy_1_dean-valentine-key-upn-affiliates-buffy?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ |title='Buffy' picks up stakes, leaves WB for UPN |publisher=CNN |date=April 23, 2001 |accessdate=December 29, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211104047/http://articles.cnn.com/2001-04-23/entertainment/buffy_1_dean-valentine-key-upn-affiliates-buffy?_s=PM%3ASHOWBIZ |archivedate=December 11, 2011}}</ref> UPN dedicated a two-hour premiere to the series to help re-launch it.

It was filmed on March 25 and 26, 2020 and broadcast as a two-night event on April 4 and 5, marking the first time the event was broadcast over two nights as well as aired on [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]]. On PPV, the two productions were sold as individual shows, with both available as a [[Product bundling|package deal]].\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place solely on April 5, 2020, at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]] and was to air live. In mid-March 2020, all WWE programming was relocated to the [[WWE Performance Center]] training facility in [[Orlando]] due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], with [[Behind closed doors (sport)|no audience]] and only essential staff present. WWE subsequently announced that WrestleMania would also be presented from the facility, and air across two nights. The majority of its matches were pre-recorded at the Performance Center between March 25 and 26. Taking advantage of the format, two matches  \u2014 a \"[[Buried Alive match|Boneyard match]]\" featuring [[The Undertaker]], and a \"Firefly Fun House match\" featuring [[\"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt]] \u2014 were filmed off-site in atypical, [[filmmaking|cinematic]] styles.\n\nThe card comprised nineteen matches which were divided between the two nights, including one match on each night's Kickoff pre-show and a [[Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms#dark_match|dark match]] on the second night. In the main event for Part 1, The Undertaker, returning to his \"American Bad Ass\" gimmick, defeated [[AJ Styles]] in a Boneyard match. In other prominent matches, [[Braun Strowman]] defeated [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] to win the [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]], [[Becky Lynch]] defeated [[Shayna Baszler]] to retain the [[Raw Women's Championship]], and [[Kevin Owens]] defeated [[Seth Rollins]] in a [[No Disqualification match]].\n\nIn the main event for Part 2, [[Drew McIntyre]] defeated [[Brock Lesnar]] to win the [[WWE Championship]], after which, McIntyre retained the title in an impromptu dark match against [[Big Show]] (which was later shown on the April 6 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''). In other prominent matches, \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt defeated [[John Cena]] in a \"Firefly Fun House match\", [[Charlotte Flair]] defeated [[Rhea Ripley]] to win the [[NXT Women's Championship]] for a second time, which was the first time an NXT championship was defended at the event, [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] defeated [[Randy Orton]] in a [[Last Man Standing match]], which was Edge's first singles match since 2011, and [[Otis Dozovic|Otis]] defeated [[Dolph Ziggler]].\n\nWrestleMania 36 received mostly positive reactions from fans and critics. While it was noted that the event suffered from the absence of a live audience and a poor lead-up (partly due to a number of wrestlers being pulled from the event shortly before its filming, mostly in relation to the pandemic, including [[Roman Reigns]], [[The Miz]], [[Andrade (wrestler)|Andrade]], and [[Dana Brooke]], all of whom were slated to defend or challenge for championships), most felt that WWE exceeded expectations. The Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches were singled out as highlights due to for their uniqueness and over-the-top tone.\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\n[[WrestleMania]] is considered [[WWE]]'s flagship event, having first been held in [[WrestleMania I|1985]].

The climax saw Cesaro perform a U.F.O. on Gulak, followed by a pin to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view portion of Part 1 opened with host Rob Gronkowski hyping WrestleMania, who was then joined by his friend [[Mojo Rawley]].<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the first match, The Kabuki Warriors ([[Asuka (wrestler)|Asuka]] and [[Kairi Sane]]) defended the [[WWE Women's Tag Team Championship]] against [[Alexa Bliss]] and [[Nikki Cross]]. In the end, Cross performed The Purge on Sane followed by Bliss performing a Twisted Bliss to win and become the first two-time champions in the titles' history.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, [[Elias (wrestler)|Elias]] faced [[Baron Corbin|King Corbin]]. In the end, as Corbin attempted a pin on Elias with his legs on the rope, the referee noticed it and voided the pin; Elias then performed a roll-up on a distracted Corbin, who was arguing with the referee, to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Becky Lynch defended the Raw Women's Championship against Shayna Baszler. In the closing moments, as Baszler applied the Kirifuda Clutch on Lynch, Lynch countered into a roll-up to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, [[Sami Zayn]] (accompanied by Cesaro and [[Shinsuke Nakamura]]) defended the Intercontinental Championship against [[Daniel Bryan]] (accompanied by Drew Gulak). In the first half of the match, Zayn refused to face Bryan and continuously scurried away from him. Bryan would run after Zayn only for Cesaro and Nakamura to get in his way. This led to Gulak getting involved and temporarily taking out Cesaro and Nakamura. As Zayn wanted a countout victory, Bryan brought Zayn back into the ring and eventually started to perform his offensive attacks on him. In the end, Cesaro and Nakamura recovered and attacked Gulak. As Bryan attempted a slam on Zayn, Zayn performed a Helluva Kick in mid-air to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, the SmackDown Tag Team Championship was defended in a Triple Threat Ladder match. The match was originally scheduled as a tag team Triple Threat Ladder match in which The Miz and John Morrison were to defend the title against [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] ([[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and Kofi Kingston) and [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), but due to The Miz becoming ill, the match was contested between Morrison, Jimmy, and Kingston, each representing their respective team. In the end, all three competitors, who were atop ladders, managed to unhook the gold hook with the titles still intact. After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder. As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[No Disqualification match]], which was accepted. During the match, Owens attacked Rollins with the ring bell and performed a diving elbow drop off the WrestleMania sign. In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium. Gronkowski attempted to pin Truth to win the title, however, Rawley moved Gronkowski and pinned Truth instead to win the 24/7 title for the seventh time.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the penultimate and final match from the Performance Center, Goldberg defended the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed the fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted a Jackhammer on Strowman, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse in the Orlando area. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+'''Other on-screen personnel \u2013 Part 2'''\n!|Role\n!|Name\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|Spanish commentator\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]<ref name=\"Spanishannouncers\"/>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Ring announcers\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"|Referees\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, [[Liv Morgan]] faced [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]]. In the end, Morgan pinned Natalya with a roll-up to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view portion of Part 2 opened with Rhea Ripley defending the NXT Women's Championship against Charlotte Flair. In the climax, After a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the title for a second time \u2013 and the first time since [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|NXT TakeOver]] in 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, Aleister Black faced [[Bobby Lashley]] (accompanied by [[Lana (wrestler)|Lana]]). In the end, as Lashley attempted a Spear on Black, Black performed a Black Mass on Lashley to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Otis faced Dolph Ziggler (accompanied by Sonya Deville). In the closing moments, as Otis attempted to perform the Caterpillar on Ziggler, Deville distracted Otis on the ring apron, which allowed Ziggler to attack Otis with a low blow from behind. Deville's tag team partner, Mandy Rose, came out and attacked Deville. With the referee distracted, Rose also performed a low blow on Ziggler. Otis then performed the Caterpillar on Ziggler to win the match. Following the match, Otis and Rose shared a kiss in the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, Edge faced Randy Orton in a Last Man Standing match. As Edge waited for Orton to make his entrance, Orton \u2013 who had been disguised as a cameraman \u2013 attacked Edge from behind with an RKO. Orton then attacked Edge with a second RKO and a camera, but Edge rose to his feet. Edge and Orton then fought in the Performance Center's gym area, where Orton placed Edge's arms in a sling and proceeded to attack him. As Orton attempted to attack Edge with a weight, Edge performed a dropkick on him. The two then fought back to the ringside area, where Orton threw Edge into a barricade off a raised platform. After fighting all throughout the Performance Center, they eventually fought atop a production truck where Edge performed a spear on Orton and Orton performed an RKO on Edge. In the end, Edge applied a sleeper hold on Orton, who passed out on a chair. A conflicted Edge then performed the Conchairto on Orton. Edge won the match after Orton was unable to answer the referee's 10 count.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against Angel Garza and Austin Theory (with Zelina Vega). In the closing moments, Ford performed a Springboard Frogsplash on Theory, who was then pinned by Dawkins. After the match, Garza, Theory, and Vega attacked the Street Profits. NXT's [[Bianca Belair]] then ran out and attacked Vega, clearing the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, new 24/7 Champion, Mojo Rawley ran away from multiple wrestlers into the Performance Center. They cornered Rawley near the podium host Rob Gronkowski was standing on. Gronkowski witnessed this and performed a dive on top of the wrestlers. Gronkowski then pinned Rawley to win the 24/7 Championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Bayley defended the SmackDown Women's Championship in a fatal five-way elimination match against Sasha Banks, Lacey Evans, Naomi, and Tamina. Tamina was the first competitor eliminated after all the other wrestlers piled on top of her for the pin. Naomi was next eliminated by Sasha Banks after submitting her to the Bank Statement. Bayley then accidentally attacked Banks after Evans had moved out of the way of an attack meant for her. After Bayley tried apologizing, Bayley pushed Banks to avoid Evans, but Evans managed to connect the Woman's Right on Banks to eliminate her, with Bayley not attempting to break the pin to help Banks. Finally, as Evans was about to perform the Woman's Right on Bayley, Banks returned to the ring and performed a Backstabber on Evans. Bayley then pinned Evans to win the match and retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nThe penultimate match was the Firefly Fun House match between John Cena and \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt. Cena came out for his match in the Performance Center, assuming his match was taking place in the ring. Wyatt was then shown in the Firefly Fun House, stating that Cena would actually be facing himself before exiting through the fun house's door. Cena was then teleported to the Firefly Fun House. After also going through the door, Cena was transported through a series of [[dream sequence]]s where Wyatt demonstrated his perceived personality flaws (such as being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did), including his debut appearance on ''SmackDown'' (with Wyatt reprising [[Kurt Angle]]'s promo against Cena from the episode, and Cena seemingly unable to say anything but \"[[History of WWE#Ruthless Aggression Era (2002-2008)|ruthless aggression]]\"), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' (where Wyatt introduced Cena as his tag team partner \"Johnny Largemeat\", who was tired out from repeatedly lifting weights). After reminiscing about his defeat against Cena at WrestleMania XXX, with Wyatt appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Cena and Wyatt suddenly appeared in a ring where Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|nWo Monday Nitro]]''\u2014with Cena acting as [[Hulk Hogan|\"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan]] and Wyatt acting as [[Eric Bischoff]]. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt. After a fury of fists, Wyatt disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind and performed Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw on Cena to win the match, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin. Just before The Fiend performed Sister Abigail, the audio of Cena's promo from ''SmackDown'' was played, where Cena had stated that at WrestleMania, he would end the existence of the \"most over hyped, over valued, over privileged WWE Superstar\".<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-firefly-funhouse-boneyard-matches-lead-best-moments-from-surreal-2020-show/|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 results: Firefly FunHouse, Boneyard matches lead best moments from surreal 2020 show|website=CBSSports.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://africa.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/28997784/wwe-wrestlemania-36-live-results-recaps-analysis|title=WrestleMania 36: McIntyre stops Lesnar, Gronk wins 24/7 title|date=2020-04-05|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre. McIntyre started off with a Claymore Kick on Lesnar for a nearfall. Lesnar performed three German suplexes and an F-5, but McIntyre kicked out at one. Lesnar then performed two more F-5's, both of which again resulted in nearfalls. As Lesnar went for a fourth F-5, McIntyre countered and performed three more Claymore Kicks on Lesnar to win the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/> After the show went off the air, McIntyre was confronted by [[Big Show]], who McIntyre then faced in a title defense described by WWE as the \"hidden WrestleMania main event.\"<ref>{{cite tweet |author=WWE WrestleMania|user=WrestleMania|number=1247357532789768194|date=April 6, 2020 |title=Your hidden #WrestleMania main event has been unlocked. #WWERaw @WWETheBigShow @DMcIntyreWWE |access-date=April 7, 2020}}</ref> McIntyre performed a Claymore Kick on Big Show to retain the title.<ref name=BSMATCH/> This dark match aired on the April 6 episode of ''Raw''.<ref name=BSTIME/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe event was positively received by fans and received mixed\u2013to\u2013positive reviews from critics.

Club]]'' gave the event a B\u2013; while praising WWE for making the most out of its \"weirdest WrestleMania of all time\", particularly praising the Boneyard match, he did point out that most matches suffered from its poor lead-up and lack of live audience, stating notably that Becky Lynch and Shayna Baszler's match was \"a listless and too\u2013short battle that, when you consider the response both performers tend to extract from crowds, might have shifted into another gear in a packed stadium.\" He also cited examples of \"shoddy storytelling\", noting that it \"[was] great that Braun Strowman beat the snot out of Goldberg, but it might have resonated more if the company hadn't just had the 53-year old Goldberg destroy The Fiend, a heretofore untouchable star, during a [[Super ShowDown (2020)|blood money PPV in Saudi Arabia]]\u2014and, you know, done anything with Braun over the past few years.\"<ref name=\"AVCReview\">{{Cite web |last=Colbrun |first=Randall |url=https://tv.avclub.com/the-weirdest-wrestlemania-of-all-time-at-least-figured-1842699373 |title=The Weirdest Wrestlemania of All Time at Least Figured Out How to Use Its Legends |work=[[The A.

Others decided to play to a crowd that wasn't actually there. [...] the WWE style\u2014with its emphasis on overwrought capital\u2013P 'performance,' over-rehearsed matches, and flowery mannerisms\u2014looked more like a parody when staged in front of zero spectators. Still, expectations for this WrestleMania were low, albeit with some minor optimism over the show being divided up into two nights instead of the marathon one-night slogs of recent years.\" However, he stated that after two lackluster opening matches, the card from Lynch vs. Baszler onward was \"very physical matches [which] made the best of the setting, and with most of the matches fitting that bill, Night One was really strong overall\", although he found Night Two much weaker, stating that Edge vs. Randy Orton was \"glacially slow, and it appeared to somehow be edited out of an even longer match\", and that Lesnar vs. McIntyre felt \"more like a formality than anything cool, because it was so paint-by-numbers.\" ''Slate'' considered the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches to be the best matches.<ref name=\"SlateReview\"/>\n\n''[[Bleacher Report]]'' stated \"It's hard to judge this event.

It was filmed on March 25 and 26, 2020 and broadcast as a two-night event on April 4 and 5, marking the first time the event was broadcast over two nights as well as aired on [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]]. On PPV, the two productions were sold as individual shows, with both available as a [[Product bundling|package deal]].\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place solely on April 5, 2020, at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]] and was to air live. In mid-March 2020, all WWE programming was relocated to the [[WWE Performance Center]] training facility in [[Orlando]] due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], with [[Behind closed doors (sport)|no audience]] and only essential staff present. WWE subsequently announced that WrestleMania would also be presented from the facility, and air across two nights. The majority of its matches were pre-recorded at the Performance Center between March 25 and 26. Taking advantage of the format, two matches  \u2014 a \"[[Buried Alive match|Boneyard match]]\" featuring [[The Undertaker]], and a \"Firefly Fun House match\" featuring [[\"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt]] \u2014 were filmed off-site in atypical, [[filmmaking|cinematic]] styles.\n\nThe card comprised nineteen matches which were divided between the two nights, including one match on each night's Kickoff pre-show and a [[Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms#dark_match|dark match]] on the second night. In the main event for Part 1, The Undertaker, returning to his \"American Bad Ass\" gimmick, defeated [[AJ Styles]] in a Boneyard match. In other prominent matches, [[Braun Strowman]] defeated [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] to win the [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]], [[Becky Lynch]] defeated [[Shayna Baszler]] to retain the [[Raw Women's Championship]], and [[Kevin Owens]] defeated [[Seth Rollins]] in a [[No Disqualification match]].\n\nIn the main event for Part 2, [[Drew McIntyre]] defeated [[Brock Lesnar]] to win the [[WWE Championship]], after which, McIntyre retained the title in an impromptu dark match against [[Big Show]] (which was later shown on the April 6 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''). In other prominent matches, \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt defeated [[John Cena]] in a \"Firefly Fun House match\", [[Charlotte Flair]] defeated [[Rhea Ripley]] to win the [[NXT Women's Championship]] for a second time, which was the first time an NXT championship was defended at the event, [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] defeated [[Randy Orton]] in a [[Last Man Standing match]], which was Edge's first singles match since 2011, and [[Otis Dozovic|Otis]] defeated [[Dolph Ziggler]].\n\nWrestleMania 36 received mostly positive reactions from fans and critics. While it was noted that the event suffered from the absence of a live audience and a poor lead-up (partly due to a number of wrestlers being pulled from the event shortly before its filming, mostly in relation to the pandemic, including [[Roman Reigns]], [[The Miz]], [[Andrade (wrestler)|Andrade]], and [[Dana Brooke]], all of whom were slated to defend or challenge for championships), most felt that WWE exceeded expectations. The Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches were singled out as highlights due to for their uniqueness and over-the-top tone.\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\n[[WrestleMania]] is considered [[WWE]]'s flagship event, having first been held in [[WrestleMania I|1985]].

As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[No Disqualification match]], which was accepted. During the match, Owens attacked Rollins with the ring bell and performed a diving elbow drop off the WrestleMania sign. In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium. Gronkowski attempted to pin Truth to win the title, however, Rawley moved Gronkowski and pinned Truth instead to win the 24/7 title for the seventh time.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the penultimate and final match from the Performance Center, Goldberg defended the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed the fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted a Jackhammer on Strowman, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse in the Orlando area. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+'''Other on-screen personnel \u2013 Part 2'''\n!|Role\n!|Name\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|Spanish commentator\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]<ref name=\"Spanishannouncers\"/>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Ring announcers\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"|Referees\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, [[Liv Morgan]] faced [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]]. In the end, Morgan pinned Natalya with a roll-up to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view portion of Part 2 opened with Rhea Ripley defending the NXT Women's Championship against Charlotte Flair. In the climax, After a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the title for a second time \u2013 and the first time since [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|NXT TakeOver]] in 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, Aleister Black faced [[Bobby Lashley]] (accompanied by [[Lana (wrestler)|Lana]]). In the end, as Lashley attempted a Spear on Black, Black performed a Black Mass on Lashley to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Otis faced Dolph Ziggler (accompanied by Sonya Deville). In the closing moments, as Otis attempted to perform the Caterpillar on Ziggler, Deville distracted Otis on the ring apron, which allowed Ziggler to attack Otis with a low blow from behind. Deville's tag team partner, Mandy Rose, came out and attacked Deville. With the referee distracted, Rose also performed a low blow on Ziggler. Otis then performed the Caterpillar on Ziggler to win the match. Following the match, Otis and Rose shared a kiss in the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, Edge faced Randy Orton in a Last Man Standing match. As Edge waited for Orton to make his entrance, Orton \u2013 who had been disguised as a cameraman \u2013 attacked Edge from behind with an RKO. Orton then attacked Edge with a second RKO and a camera, but Edge rose to his feet. Edge and Orton then fought in the Performance Center's gym area, where Orton placed Edge's arms in a sling and proceeded to attack him. As Orton attempted to attack Edge with a weight, Edge performed a dropkick on him. The two then fought back to the ringside area, where Orton threw Edge into a barricade off a raised platform. After fighting all throughout the Performance Center, they eventually fought atop a production truck where Edge performed a spear on Orton and Orton performed an RKO on Edge. In the end, Edge applied a sleeper hold on Orton, who passed out on a chair. A conflicted Edge then performed the Conchairto on Orton. Edge won the match after Orton was unable to answer the referee's 10 count.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against Angel Garza and Austin Theory (with Zelina Vega). In the closing moments, Ford performed a Springboard Frogsplash on Theory, who was then pinned by Dawkins. After the match, Garza, Theory, and Vega attacked the Street Profits. NXT's [[Bianca Belair]] then ran out and attacked Vega, clearing the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, new 24/7 Champion, Mojo Rawley ran away from multiple wrestlers into the Performance Center. They cornered Rawley near the podium host Rob Gronkowski was standing on. Gronkowski witnessed this and performed a dive on top of the wrestlers. Gronkowski then pinned Rawley to win the 24/7 Championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Bayley defended the SmackDown Women's Championship in a fatal five-way elimination match against Sasha Banks, Lacey Evans, Naomi, and Tamina. Tamina was the first competitor eliminated after all the other wrestlers piled on top of her for the pin. Naomi was next eliminated by Sasha Banks after submitting her to the Bank Statement. Bayley then accidentally attacked Banks after Evans had moved out of the way of an attack meant for her. After Bayley tried apologizing, Bayley pushed Banks to avoid Evans, but Evans managed to connect the Woman's Right on Banks to eliminate her, with Bayley not attempting to break the pin to help Banks. Finally, as Evans was about to perform the Woman's Right on Bayley, Banks returned to the ring and performed a Backstabber on Evans. Bayley then pinned Evans to win the match and retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nThe penultimate match was the Firefly Fun House match between John Cena and \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt. Cena came out for his match in the Performance Center, assuming his match was taking place in the ring. Wyatt was then shown in the Firefly Fun House, stating that Cena would actually be facing himself before exiting through the fun house's door. Cena was then teleported to the Firefly Fun House. After also going through the door, Cena was transported through a series of [[dream sequence]]s where Wyatt demonstrated his perceived personality flaws (such as being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did), including his debut appearance on ''SmackDown'' (with Wyatt reprising [[Kurt Angle]]'s promo against Cena from the episode, and Cena seemingly unable to say anything but \"[[History of WWE#Ruthless Aggression Era (2002-2008)|ruthless aggression]]\"), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' (where Wyatt introduced Cena as his tag team partner \"Johnny Largemeat\", who was tired out from repeatedly lifting weights). After reminiscing about his defeat against Cena at WrestleMania XXX, with Wyatt appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Cena and Wyatt suddenly appeared in a ring where Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|nWo Monday Nitro]]''\u2014with Cena acting as [[Hulk Hogan|\"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan]] and Wyatt acting as [[Eric Bischoff]]. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt. After a fury of fists, Wyatt disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind and performed Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw on Cena to win the match, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin. Just before The Fiend performed Sister Abigail, the audio of Cena's promo from ''SmackDown'' was played, where Cena had stated that at WrestleMania, he would end the existence of the \"most over hyped, over valued, over privileged WWE Superstar\".<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-firefly-funhouse-boneyard-matches-lead-best-moments-from-surreal-2020-show/|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 results: Firefly FunHouse, Boneyard matches lead best moments from surreal 2020 show|website=CBSSports.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://africa.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/28997784/wwe-wrestlemania-36-live-results-recaps-analysis|title=WrestleMania 36: McIntyre stops Lesnar, Gronk wins 24/7 title|date=2020-04-05|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre. McIntyre started off with a Claymore Kick on Lesnar for a nearfall. Lesnar performed three German suplexes and an F-5, but McIntyre kicked out at one. Lesnar then performed two more F-5's, both of which again resulted in nearfalls. As Lesnar went for a fourth F-5, McIntyre countered and performed three more Claymore Kicks on Lesnar to win the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/> After the show went off the air, McIntyre was confronted by [[Big Show]], who McIntyre then faced in a title defense described by WWE as the \"hidden WrestleMania main event.\"<ref>{{cite tweet |author=WWE WrestleMania|user=WrestleMania|number=1247357532789768194|date=April 6, 2020 |title=Your hidden #WrestleMania main event has been unlocked. #WWERaw @WWETheBigShow @DMcIntyreWWE |access-date=April 7, 2020}}</ref> McIntyre performed a Claymore Kick on Big Show to retain the title.<ref name=BSMATCH/> This dark match aired on the April 6 episode of ''Raw''.<ref name=BSTIME/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe event was positively received by fans and received mixed\u2013to\u2013positive reviews from critics. While most agreed that WrestleMania 36 suffered from both a poor lead-up and the absence of a live audience, many felt that the event exceeded expectations, with both critics and fans largely praising the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches as the best of the event for their uniqueness and over-the-top tone (and in the case of the latter, its inventiveness and humor); the SmackDown Tag Team Championship match and Owens vs. Rollins were also singled out by most critics.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\">{{Cite web |last=Szalai |first=Georg |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-wwe-pulled-wrestlemania-36-fans-business-impact-1288659 |title=How WWE Pulled Off WrestleMania 36 Without Fans and What It Means for Its Business and Future |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"SlateReview\">{{Cite web |last=Bixenspan |first=David |url=https://slate.com/culture/2020/04/wrestlemania-36-no-fans-audience-coronavirus-undertaker-john-cena.html |title=WrestleMania Still Happened Last Weekend.

Club]]'' gave the event a B\u2013; while praising WWE for making the most out of its \"weirdest WrestleMania of all time\", particularly praising the Boneyard match, he did point out that most matches suffered from its poor lead-up and lack of live audience, stating notably that Becky Lynch and Shayna Baszler's match was \"a listless and too\u2013short battle that, when you consider the response both performers tend to extract from crowds, might have shifted into another gear in a packed stadium.\" He also cited examples of \"shoddy storytelling\", noting that it \"[was] great that Braun Strowman beat the snot out of Goldberg, but it might have resonated more if the company hadn't just had the 53-year old Goldberg destroy The Fiend, a heretofore untouchable star, during a [[Super ShowDown (2020)|blood money PPV in Saudi Arabia]]\u2014and, you know, done anything with Braun over the past few years.\"<ref name=\"AVCReview\">{{Cite web |last=Colbrun |first=Randall |url=https://tv.avclub.com/the-weirdest-wrestlemania-of-all-time-at-least-figured-1842699373 |title=The Weirdest Wrestlemania of All Time at Least Figured Out How to Use Its Legends |work=[[The A.

Others decided to play to a crowd that wasn't actually there. [...] the WWE style\u2014with its emphasis on overwrought capital\u2013P 'performance,' over-rehearsed matches, and flowery mannerisms\u2014looked more like a parody when staged in front of zero spectators. Still, expectations for this WrestleMania were low, albeit with some minor optimism over the show being divided up into two nights instead of the marathon one-night slogs of recent years.\" However, he stated that after two lackluster opening matches, the card from Lynch vs. Baszler onward was \"very physical matches [which] made the best of the setting, and with most of the matches fitting that bill, Night One was really strong overall\", although he found Night Two much weaker, stating that Edge vs. Randy Orton was \"glacially slow, and it appeared to somehow be edited out of an even longer match\", and that Lesnar vs. McIntyre felt \"more like a formality than anything cool, because it was so paint-by-numbers.\" ''Slate'' considered the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches to be the best matches.<ref name=\"SlateReview\"/>\n\n''[[Bleacher Report]]'' stated \"It's hard to judge this event. You have to take the good with the bad, maintain honest integrity with criticism, but also be forgiving and acknowledge that this was not how WrestleMania was supposed to be.\" They gave a positive review, although they ranked Elias vs. Corbin, Black vs. Lashley, and the SmackDown Women's title match as the low points of the event.<ref name=\"BleacherReview1\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883707-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-1 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 1 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 5, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"BleacherReview2\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883709-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-2 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 2 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref> Additionally, ''Bleacher Report'' gave the Boneyard match a 4.5 star ratings on a scale of 5, their highest rated match from both nights, while giving the Universal Championship match a 0.5 star, their lowest rated match from the event.<ref>{{cit web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2885202-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-star-ratings-for-all-matches-from-full-show|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Star Ratings for All Matches from Full Show|author=Rill, Jake|date=April 6, 2020|accessdate=April 8, 2020|work=Bleacher Report}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' noted that the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches could set a precedent for WWE using more \"cinematic experiences\" in its programming to make up for the closed door tapings.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\"/>\n\n==Results==\n{{Pro Wrestling results table\n|caption = <!--Do not change to Night 1.

Two alternative frameworks for quantum physics offer different explanations for the uncertainty principle. The [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|wave mechanics]] picture of the uncertainty principle is more visually intuitive, but the more abstract [[matrix mechanics]] picture formulates it in a way that generalizes more easily.\n\nMathematically, in wave mechanics, the uncertainty relation between position and momentum arises because the expressions of the wavefunction in the two corresponding [[orthonormal]] [[basis (linear algebra)|bases]] in [[Hilbert space]] are [[Fourier transforms]] of one another (i.e., position and momentum are [[conjugate variables]]). A nonzero function and its Fourier transform cannot both be sharply localized. A similar tradeoff between the variances of Fourier conjugates arises in all systems underlain by Fourier analysis, for example in sound waves: A pure tone is a [[Dirac delta function|sharp spike]] at a single frequency, while its Fourier transform gives the shape of the sound wave in the time domain, which is a completely delocalized sine wave. In quantum mechanics, the two key points are that the position of the particle takes the form of a [[matter wave]], and momentum is its Fourier conjugate, assured by the de Broglie relation {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''\u0127k''}}, where {{mvar|k}} is the [[wavenumber]].\n\nIn [[matrix mechanics]], the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics#Postulates of quantum mechanics|mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]], any pair of non-[[commutator|commuting]] [[self-adjoint operator]]s representing [[observable]]s are subject to similar uncertainty limits. An eigenstate of an observable represents the state of the wavefunction for a certain measurement value (the eigenvalue). For example, if a measurement of an observable {{mvar|A}} is performed, then the system is in a particular eigenstate {{mvar|\u03a8}} of that observable. However, the particular eigenstate of the observable {{mvar|A}} need not be an eigenstate of another observable {{mvar|B}}: If so, then it does not have a unique associated measurement for it, as the system is not in an eigenstate of that observable.<ref>{{Citation|author1=Claude Cohen-Tannoudji |author2=Bernard Diu |author3=Franck Lalo\u00eb |title=Quantum mechanics|year=1996|publisher=Wiley|location=Wiley-Interscience|isbn=978-0-471-56952-7|pages=231\u2013233}}</ref>\n\n===Wave mechanics interpretation===\n(Ref <ref name=\"L&L\">{{cite book\n |author=[[Lev Landau|L.D.

The position of the particle is described by a [[wave function]] <math>\\Psi(x,t)</math>. The time-independent wave function of a single-moded plane wave of wavenumber ''k''<sub>0</sub> or momentum ''p''<sub>0</sub> is\n\n:<math>\\psi(x) \\propto e^{ik_0 x} = e^{ip_0 x/\\hbar} ~.</math>\n\nThe [[Born rule]] states that this should be interpreted as a [[probability density function|probability density amplitude function]] in the sense that the probability of finding the particle between ''a'' and ''b'' is\n\n:<math> \\operatorname P [a \\leq X \\leq b] = \\int_a^b |\\psi(x)|^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}x ~.</math>\n\nIn the case of the single-moded plane wave, <math>|\\psi(x)|^2</math> is a [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]]. In other words, the particle position is extremely uncertain in the sense that it could be essentially anywhere along the wave packet. \n\nOn the other hand, consider a wave function that is a [[superposition principle|sum of many waves]], which we may write this as\n\n:<math>\\psi(x) \\propto \\sum_n A_n e^{i p_n x/\\hbar}~, </math>\nwhere ''A''<sub>''n''</sub> represents the relative contribution of the mode ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> to the overall total. The figures to the right show how with the addition of many plane waves, the wave packet can become more localized. We may take this a step further to the continuum limit, where the wave function is an [[integral]] over all possible modes\n\n:<math>\\psi(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\hbar}} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\varphi(p) \\cdot e^{i p x/\\hbar} \\, dp ~, </math>\n\nwith <math>\\varphi(p)</math> representing the amplitude of these modes and is called the wave function in [[momentum space]]. In mathematical terms, we say that <math>\\varphi(p)</math> is the ''[[Fourier transform]]'' of <math>\\psi(x)</math> and that ''x'' and ''p'' are [[conjugate variables]]. Adding together all of these plane waves comes at a cost, namely the momentum has become less precise, having become a mixture of waves of many different momenta.\n\nOne way to quantify the precision of the position and momentum is the [[standard deviation]]&nbsp;''\u03c3''. Since <math>|\\psi(x)|^2</math> is a probability density function for position, we calculate its standard deviation.\n\nThe precision of the position is improved, i.e. reduced \u03c3<sub>x</sub>, by using many plane waves, thereby weakening the precision of the momentum, i.e. increased \u03c3<sub>p</sub>. Another way of stating this is that \u03c3<sub>x</sub> and \u03c3<sub>p</sub> have an [[inverse relationship]] or are at least bounded from below. This is the uncertainty principle, the exact limit of which is the Kennard bound.

A similar result would hold for ''any'' pair of conjugate variables.\n|}\n\n===Matrix mechanics interpretation===\n(Ref <ref name=\"L&L\"/>) \n{{Main article|Matrix mechanics}}\nIn matrix mechanics, observables such as position and momentum are represented by [[self-adjoint operator]]s. When considering pairs of observables,  an important quantity is the ''[[commutator]]''. For a pair of operators {{mvar|\u00c2}} and {{mvar|B\u0302}},  one defines their commutator as\n:<math>[\\hat{A},\\hat{B}]=\\hat{A}\\hat{B}-\\hat{B}\\hat{A}.</math>\nIn the case of position and momentum, the commutator is the [[canonical commutation relation]]\n:<math>[\\hat{x},\\hat{p}]=i \\hbar.</math>\n\nThe physical meaning of the non-commutativity can be understood by considering the effect of the commutator on position and momentum [[eigenstate]]s. Let <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math> be a right eigenstate of position with a constant eigenvalue {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}}. By definition, this means that <math>\\hat{x}|\\psi\\rangle = x_0 |\\psi\\rangle.</math> Applying the commutator to <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math> yields\n:<math>[\\hat{x},\\hat{p}] | \\psi \\rangle = (\\hat{x}\\hat{p}-\\hat{p}\\hat{x}) | \\psi \\rangle = (\\hat{x} - x_0 \\hat{I}) \\hat{p} \\, | \\psi \\rangle = i \\hbar | \\psi \\rangle,</math>\nwhere {{mvar|\u00ce}} is  the [[identity matrix|identity operator]].\n\nSuppose, for the sake of [[proof by contradiction]], that <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math> is also a right eigenstate of momentum, with constant eigenvalue {{mvar|''p''<sub>0</sub>}}. If this were true, then  one could write\n:<math>(\\hat{x} - x_0 \\hat{I}) \\hat{p} \\, | \\psi \\rangle = (\\hat{x} - x_0 \\hat{I}) p_0 \\, | \\psi \\rangle = (x_0 \\hat{I} - x_0 \\hat{I})  p_0 \\, | \\psi \\rangle=0.</math>\nOn the other hand, the above canonical commutation relation requires that\n:<math>[\\hat{x},\\hat{p}] | \\psi \\rangle=i \\hbar | \\psi \\rangle \\ne 0.</math>\nThis implies that no quantum state can simultaneously be both a position and a momentum eigenstate.\n\nWhen a state is measured, it is projected onto an eigenstate in the basis of the relevant observable. For example, if a particle's position is measured, then the state amounts to a position eigenstate. This means that the state is ''not'' a momentum eigenstate, however, but rather it can be represented  as a sum of multiple momentum basis eigenstates. In other words, the momentum must be less precise. This precision may be quantified by the [[standard deviation]]s,  \n:<math>\\sigma_x=\\sqrt{\\langle \\hat{x}^2 \\rangle-\\langle \\hat{x}\\rangle^2}</math>\n:<math>\\sigma_p=\\sqrt{\\langle \\hat{p}^2 \\rangle-\\langle \\hat{p}\\rangle^2}.</math>\n\nAs in the wave mechanics interpretation above, one sees a tradeoff between the respective precisions of the two, quantified by the uncertainty principle.\n\n==Robertson\u2013Schr\u00f6dinger uncertainty relations==\nThe most common general form of the uncertainty principle is the ''[[Howard Percy Robertson|Robertson]] uncertainty relation''.<ref name=\"Robertson1929\">{{Citation|last=Robertson|first=H.

A few of the most common relations found in the literature are given below.\n* For position and linear momentum, the [[canonical commutation relation]] <math>[\\hat{x}, \\hat{p}] = i\\hbar</math> implies the Kennard inequality from above:\n:: <math>\\sigma_x \\sigma_p \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}.</math>\n* For two orthogonal components of the [[angular momentum|total angular momentum]] operator of an object:\n:: <math>\\sigma_{J_i} \\sigma_{J_j} \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\big|\\langle J_k\\rangle\\big|,</math>\n: where ''i'', ''j'', ''k'' are distinct, and ''J''<sub>''i''</sub> denotes angular momentum along the ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> axis. This relation implies that unless all three components vanish together, only a single component of a system's angular momentum can be defined with arbitrary precision, normally the component parallel to an external (magnetic or electric) field. Moreover, for <math>[J_x, J_y] = i \\hbar \\varepsilon_{xyz} J_z</math>, a choice <math>\\hat{A} = J_x</math>, <math>\\hat{B} = J_y</math>, in angular momentum multiplets, ''\u03c8'' = |''j'', ''m''\u3009, bounds the [[Casimir invariant]] (angular momentum squared, <math>\\langle J_x^2+ J_y^2 + J_z^2 \\rangle</math>) from below and thus yields useful constraints such as {{nobr|''j''(''j'' + 1) \u2265 ''m''(''m'' + 1)}}, and hence ''j''\u00a0\u2265\u00a0''m'', among others.\n*{{anchor|Time\u2013energy uncertainty relation}} In non-relativistic mechanics, time is privileged as an [[independent variable]].

Although the second factor in the left-hand side has dimension of time, it is different from the time parameter that enters the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]]. It is a ''lifetime'' of the state {{mvar|\u03c8}} with respect to the observable ''B'': In other words, this is the ''time interval'' (\u0394''t'') after which the expectation value <math>\\langle\\hat B\\rangle</math> changes appreciably.\n: An informal, heuristic meaning of the principle is the following: A state that only exists for a short time cannot have a definite energy. To have a definite energy, the frequency of the state must be defined accurately, and this requires the state to hang around for many cycles, the reciprocal of the required accuracy. For example, in [[Electromagnetic spectroscopy|spectroscopy]], excited states have a finite lifetime. By the time\u2013energy uncertainty principle, they do not have a definite energy, and, each time they decay, the energy they release is slightly different. The average energy of the outgoing photon has a peak at the theoretical energy of the state, but the distribution has a finite width called the [[Spectral linewidth|''natural linewidth'']]. Fast-decaying states have a broad linewidth, while slow-decaying states have a narrow linewidth.<ref>The broad linewidth of fast-decaying states makes it difficult to accurately measure the energy of the state, and researchers have even used detuned microwave cavities to slow down the decay rate, to get sharper peaks. {{Citation |last=Gabrielse |first=Gerald |author2=H.

The energy\u2013time uncertainty relation is not, however, an obvious consequence of the general Robertson\u2013Schr\u00f6dinger relation. Since energy bears the same relation to time as momentum does to space in [[special relativity]], it was clear to many early founders, [[Niels Bohr]] among them, that the following relation should hold:<ref name=\"Heisenberg_1927\"/><ref name=\"Heisenberg_1930\"/>\n\n::<math> \\Delta E \\Delta t \\gtrsim h,</math>\n\nbut it was not always obvious what <math>\\Delta t</math> precisely meant. The problem is that the time at which the particle has a given state is not an operator belonging to the particle, it is a parameter describing the evolution of the system. As [[Lev Landau]] once joked \"To violate the time\u2013energy uncertainty relation all I have to do is measure the energy very precisely and then look at my watch!\"<ref name=\"C Jansson\">[https://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.3625 The GMc-interpretation of Quantum Mechanics], by Christian Jansson, February 25, 2008</ref>\n\nOne ''false'' formulation of the energy\u2013time uncertainty principle says that measuring the energy of a quantum system to an accuracy <math>\\Delta E</math> requires a time interval <math>\\Delta t > h/\\Delta E</math>. This formulation is similar to the one alluded to in Landau's joke, and was explicitly invalidated by [[Yakir Aharonov|Y. Aharonov]] and [[David Bohm|D. Bohm]] in 1961.<ref>http://148.216.10.84/archivoshistoricosMQ/ModernaHist/Aharonov%20a.pdf</ref> The time <math>\\Delta t</math> in the uncertainty relation is the time during which the system exists unperturbed, not the time during which the experimental equipment is turned on, whereas the position in the other version of the principle refers to where the particle has some probability to be and not where the observer might look.\n\nAnother common misconception is that the energy\u2013time uncertainty principle says that the [[conservation of energy]] can be temporarily violated\u2014energy can be \"borrowed\" from the universe as long as it is \"returned\" within a short amount of time.<ref name=\"Griffiths2005\"/>   Although this agrees with the ''spirit'' of [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], it is based on the false axiom that the energy of the universe is an exactly known parameter at all times. More accurately, when events transpire at shorter time intervals, there is a greater uncertainty in the energy of these events. Therefore it is not that the conservation of energy is ''violated'' when [[quantum field theory]] uses temporary electron\u2013positron pairs in its calculations, but that the energy of quantum systems is not known with enough precision to limit their behavior to a single, simple history. Thus the influence of ''all histories'' must be incorporated into quantum calculations, including those with much greater or much less energy than the mean of the measured/calculated energy distribution.\n\nIn 1932 Dirac offered a precise definition and derivation of the time\u2013energy uncertainty relation in a relativistic quantum theory of \"events\".<ref>see here, and the linked references: http://www.springerlink.com/content/nwq557633112kxk2/</ref>\n-->\n\n===A counterexample===\nSuppose we consider a quantum [[particle in a ring|particle on a ring]], where the wave function depends on an angular variable <math>\\theta</math>, which we may take to lie in the interval <math>[0,2\\pi]</math>.

The definition of <math>\\hat{A}</math> depends on our choice to have <math>\\theta</math> range from 0 to <math>2\\pi</math>. These operators satisfy the usual commutation relations for position and momentum operators, <math>[\\hat{A},\\hat{B}]=i\\hbar</math>.<ref>More precisely, <math>\\hat{A}\\hat{B}\\psi-\\hat{B}\\hat{A}\\psi=i\\hbar\\psi</math> whenever both <math>\\hat{A}\\hat{B}\\psi</math> and <math>\\hat{B}\\hat{A}\\psi</math> are defined, and the space of such <math>\\psi</math> is a dense subspace of the quantum Hilbert space.

These states are normalizable, unlike the eigenstates of the momentum operator on the line. Also the operator <math>\\hat{A}</math> is bounded, since <math>\\theta</math> ranges over a bounded interval.

A few remarks on these inequalities. First, the choice of [[base e]] is a matter of popular convention in physics. The logarithm can alternatively be in any base, provided that it be consistent on both sides of the inequality.  Second, recall the [[Shannon entropy]] has been used, ''not'' the quantum [[von Neumann entropy]].  Finally, the normal distribution saturates the inequality, and it is the only distribution with this property, because it is the [[maximum entropy probability distribution]] among those with fixed variance (cf. [[differential entropy#Maximization in the normal distribution|here]] for proof).\n\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"70%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!Entropic uncertainty of the normal distribution\n|-\n|We demonstrate this method on the ground state of the QHO, which as discussed above saturates the usual uncertainty based on standard deviations.

The basic result, which follows from \"Benedicks's theorem\", below, is that a function cannot be both [[time limited]] and [[band limited]] (a function and its Fourier transform cannot both have bounded domain)\u2014see [[Bandlimiting#Bandlimited versus timelimited|bandlimited versus timelimited]].

In practice, the Gabor limit limits the ''simultaneous'' time\u2013frequency resolution one can achieve without interference; it is possible to achieve higher resolution, but at the cost of different components of the signal interfering with each other.\n\nAs a result, in order to analyze signals where the transients are important, the [[Wavelet Transform|wavelet transform]] is often used instead of the Fourier.\n\n===DFT-Uncertainty principle===\nThere is an uncertainty principle that uses signal sparsity (or the number of non-zero coefficients).<ref name=\"Donoho\">{{cite journal |last1=Donoho |first1=D.L. |last2=Stark |first2=P.B |year=1989 |title=Uncertainty principles and signal recovery |journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=906\u2013931 |doi=10.1137/0149053}}</ref>\n\nLet <math>\\left \\{ \\mathbf{ x_n } \\right \\} := x_0, x_1, \\ldots, x_{N-1}</math> be a sequence of ''N'' complex numbers and <math>\\left \\{ \\mathbf{X_k} \\right \\} := X_0, X_1, \\ldots, X_{N-1},</math> its [[discrete Fourier transform]].\n\nDenote by <math>\\|x\\|_0</math> the number of non-zero elements in the time sequence <math>x_0,x_1,\\ldots,x_{N-1}</math> and by <math>\\|X\\|_0</math> the number of non-zero elements in the frequency sequence <math>X_0,X_1,\\ldots,X_{N-1}</math>.

The central premise was that the classical concept of motion does not fit at the quantum level, as [[electron]]s in an atom do not travel on sharply defined orbits. Rather, their motion is smeared out in a strange way: the [[Fourier transform]] of its time dependence only involves those frequencies that could be observed in the quantum jumps of their radiation.\n\nHeisenberg's paper did not admit any unobservable quantities like the exact position of the electron in an orbit at any time; he only allowed the theorist to talk about the Fourier components of the motion. Since the Fourier components were not defined at the classical frequencies, they could not be used to construct an exact [[trajectory]], so that the formalism could not answer certain overly precise questions about where the electron was or how fast it was going.\n\nIn March 1926, working in Bohr's institute, Heisenberg realized that the non-[[commutativity]] implies the uncertainty principle. This implication provided a clear physical interpretation for the non-commutativity, and it laid the foundation for what became known as the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. Heisenberg showed that the commutation relation implies an uncertainty, or in Bohr's language a [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]].<ref>{{Citation |first=Niels |last=Bohr |year=1958 |title=Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |page=38 |isbn= |bibcode=1958AmJPh..26..596B |volume=26 |journal=American Journal of Physics |doi=10.1119/1.1934707 |issue=8 |last2=Noll |first2=Waldemar }}</ref> Any two variables that do not commute cannot be measured simultaneously\u2014the more precisely one is known, the less precisely the other can be known.

One way in which Heisenberg originally illustrated the intrinsic impossibility of violating the uncertainty principle is by utilizing the [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]] of  an imaginary microscope as a measuring device.<ref name=\"Heisenberg_1930\"/>\n\nHe imagines an experimenter trying to measure the position and momentum of an [[electron]] by shooting a [[photon]] at it.<ref name=GreensteinZajonc2006>{{cite book|author1=George Greenstein|author2=Arthur Zajonc|title=The Quantum Challenge: Modern Research on the Foundations of Quantum Mechanics|year=2006|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-0-7637-2470-2}}</ref>{{rp|49\u201350}}\n:Problem 1 \u2013 If the photon has a short [[wavelength]], and therefore, a large momentum, the position can be measured accurately. But the photon scatters in a random direction, transferring a large and uncertain amount of momentum to the electron.

If a small aperture is used, the accuracy of both resolutions is the other way around.\n\nThe combination of these trade-offs implies that no matter what photon wavelength and aperture size are used, the product of the uncertainty in measured position and measured momentum is greater than or equal to a lower limit, which is (up to a small numerical factor) equal to [[Planck's constant]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Tipler |first=Paul A. |first2=Ralph A. |last2=Llewellyn |title=Modern Physics |edition=3rd |publisher=W.

According to the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, there is no fundamental reality that the [[quantum state]] describes, just a prescription for calculating experimental results. There is no way to say what the state of a system fundamentally is, only what the result of observations might be.\n\n[[Albert Einstein]] believed that randomness is a reflection of our ignorance of some fundamental property of reality, while [[Niels Bohr]] believed that the probability distributions are fundamental and irreducible, and depend on which measurements we choose to perform. [[Bohr\u2013Einstein debates|Einstein and Bohr debated]] the uncertainty principle for many years.\n\n===The ideal of the detached observer===\n[[Wolfgang Pauli]] called Einstein's fundamental objection to the uncertainty principle \"the ideal of the detached observer\" (phrase translated from the German):\n{{blockquote|\"Like the moon has a definite position\" Einstein said to me last winter, \"whether or not we look at the moon, the same must also hold for the atomic objects, as there is no sharp distinction possible between these and macroscopic objects. Observation cannot ''create'' an element of reality like a position, there must be something contained in the complete description of physical reality which corresponds to the ''possibility'' of observing a position, already before the observation has been actually made.\" I hope, that I quoted Einstein correctly; it is always difficult to quote somebody out of memory with whom one does not agree. It is precisely this kind of postulate which I call the ideal of the detached observer.\n*Letter from Pauli to Niels Bohr, February 15, 1955<ref>{{cite book|editor=Enz, Charles P.|editor2=Meyenn, Karl von|title=Writings on physics and philosophy by Wolfgang Pauli|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1994|page=43|postscript=; translated by Robert Schlapp|isbn=3-540-56859-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ueTd4g7pc5MC&pg=PA43}}</ref>}}\n===Einstein's slit===\nThe first of Einstein's [[thought experiment]]s challenging the uncertainty principle went as follows:\n\n:Consider a particle passing through a slit of width {{mvar|d}}. The slit introduces an uncertainty in momentum of approximately {{mvar|{{sfrac|h|d}}}} because the particle passes through the wall. But let us determine the momentum of the particle by measuring the recoil of the wall. In doing so, we find the momentum of the particle to arbitrary accuracy by conservation of momentum.\n\nBohr's response was that the wall is quantum mechanical as well, and that to measure the recoil to accuracy {{math|\u0394''p''}}, the momentum of the wall must be known to this accuracy before the particle passes through. This introduces an uncertainty in the position of the wall and therefore the position of the slit equal to {{math|{{sfrac|''h''|\u0394''p''}}}}, and if the wall's momentum is known precisely enough to measure the recoil, the slit's position is uncertain enough to disallow a position measurement.\n\nA similar analysis with particles diffracting through multiple slits is given by [[Richard Feynman]].<ref>Feynman lectures on Physics, vol 3, 2\u20132</ref>\n\n===Einstein's box===\nBohr was present when Einstein proposed the thought experiment which has become known as [[Einstein's box]]. Einstein argued that \"Heisenberg's uncertainty equation implied that the uncertainty in time was related to the uncertainty in energy, the product of the two being related to [[Planck's constant]].\"<ref name=\"Gamow\">Gamow, G., ''The great physicists from Galileo to Einstein'', Courier Dover, 1988, p.260.</ref> Consider, he said, an ideal box, lined with mirrors so that it can contain light indefinitely. The box could be weighed before a clockwork mechanism opened an ideal shutter at a chosen instant to allow one single photon to escape. \"We now know, explained Einstein, precisely the time at which the photon left the box.\"<ref>Kumar, M., ''Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality'', Icon, 2009, p. 282.</ref> \"Now, weigh the box again. The change of mass tells the energy of the emitted light. In this manner, said Einstein, one could measure the energy emitted and the time it was released with any desired precision, in contradiction to the uncertainty principle.\"<ref name=\"Gamow\" />\n\nBohr spent a sleepless night considering this argument, and eventually realized that it was flawed. He pointed out that if the box were to be weighed, say by a spring and a pointer on a scale, \"since the box must move vertically with a change in its weight, there will be uncertainty in its vertical velocity and therefore an uncertainty in its height above the table. ... Furthermore, the uncertainty about the elevation above the earth's surface will result in an uncertainty in the rate of the clock,\"<ref>Gamow, G., ''The great physicists from Galileo to Einstein'', Courier Dover, 1988, p. 260\u2013261.</ref> because of Einstein's own theory of [[Gravitational time dilation|gravity's effect on time]].\n\"Through this chain of uncertainties, Bohr showed that Einstein's light box experiment could not simultaneously measure exactly both the energy of the photon and the time of its escape.\"<ref>Kumar, M., ''Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality'', Icon, 2009, p. 287.</ref>\n\n===EPR paradox for entangled particles===\nBohr was compelled to modify his understanding of the uncertainty principle after another thought experiment by Einstein. In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (see [[EPR paradox]]) published an analysis of widely separated [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]] particles. Measuring one particle, Einstein realized, would alter the probability distribution of the other, yet here the other particle could not possibly be disturbed. This example led Bohr to revise his understanding of the principle, concluding that the uncertainty was not caused by a direct interaction.<ref>{{Citation |first=Walter |last=Isaacson |year=2007 |title=Einstein: His Life and Universe |location=New York |publisher=Simon & Schuster |page=[https://archive.org/details/einsteinhislifeu0000isaa/page/452 452] |isbn=978-0-7432-6473-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/einsteinhislifeu0000isaa/page/452 }}</ref>\n\nBut Einstein came to much more far-reaching conclusions from the same thought experiment. He believed the \"natural basic assumption\" that a complete description of reality would have to predict the results of experiments from \"locally changing deterministic quantities\" and therefore would have to include more information than the maximum possible allowed by the uncertainty principle.\n\nIn 1964, [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] showed that this assumption can be falsified, since it would imply a certain inequality between the probabilities of different experiments. Experimental results confirm the predictions of quantum mechanics, ruling out Einstein's basic assumption that led him to the suggestion of his ''hidden variables''. These hidden variables may be \"hidden\" because of an illusion that occurs during observations of objects that are too large or too small.  This illusion can be likened to rotating fan blades that seem to pop in and out of existence at different locations and sometimes seem to be in the same place at the same time when observed.  This same illusion manifests itself in the observation of subatomic particles.  Both the fan blades and the subatomic particles are moving so fast that the illusion is seen by the observer.  Therefore, it is possible that there would be predictability of the subatomic particles behavior and characteristics to a recording device capable of very high speed tracking....Ironically this fact is one of the best pieces of evidence supporting [[Karl Popper]]'s philosophy of [[Falsifiability|invalidation of a theory by falsification-experiments]]. That is to say, here Einstein's \"basic assumption\" became falsified by [[Bell test experiments|experiments based on Bell's inequalities]]. For the objections of Karl Popper to the Heisenberg inequality itself, see below.\n\nWhile it is possible to assume that quantum mechanical predictions are due to nonlocal, hidden variables, and in fact [[David Bohm]] invented such a formulation, this resolution is not satisfactory to the vast majority of physicists. The question of whether a random outcome is predetermined by a nonlocal theory can be philosophical, and it can be potentially intractable. If the hidden variables were not constrained, they could just be a list of random digits that are used to produce the measurement outcomes. To make it sensible, the assumption of nonlocal hidden variables is sometimes augmented by a second assumption\u2014that the [[size of the observable universe]] puts a limit on the computations that these variables can do. A nonlocal theory of this sort predicts that a [[quantum computer]] would encounter fundamental obstacles when attempting to factor numbers of approximately 10,000 digits or more; a potentially [[Shor's algorithm|achievable task]] in quantum mechanics.<ref>[[Gerardus 't Hooft]] has at times advocated this point of view.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n=== Popper's criticism ===\n{{main article|Popper's experiment}}\n[[Karl Popper]] approached the problem of indeterminacy as a logician and [[Philosophical realism|metaphysical realist]].<ref name=\"Popper1959\">{{Citation | last1 = Popper | first1 = Karl | authorlink1 = Karl Popper | title = The Logic of Scientific Discovery | publisher = Hutchinson & Co. | year = 1959| title-link = The Logic of Scientific Discovery }}</ref> He disagreed with the application of the uncertainty relations to individual particles rather than to [[Quantum ensemble|ensembles]] of identically prepared particles, referring to them as \"statistical scatter relations\".<ref name=\"Popper1959\" /><ref name=\"Jarvie2006\">{{Citation | last1 = Jarvie | first1 = Ian Charles | last2 = Milford | first2 = Karl | last3 = Miller | first3 = David W | title = Karl Popper: a centenary assessment | volume = 3 | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-7546-5712-5}}</ref> In this statistical interpretation, a ''particular'' measurement may be made to arbitrary precision without invalidating the quantum theory.

Two alternative frameworks for quantum physics offer different explanations for the uncertainty principle. The [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|wave mechanics]] picture of the uncertainty principle is more visually intuitive, but the more abstract [[matrix mechanics]] picture formulates it in a way that generalizes more easily.\n\nMathematically, in wave mechanics, the uncertainty relation between position and momentum arises because the expressions of the wavefunction in the two corresponding [[orthonormal]] [[basis (linear algebra)|bases]] in [[Hilbert space]] are [[Fourier transforms]] of one another (i.e., position and momentum are [[conjugate variables]]). A nonzero function and its Fourier transform cannot both be sharply localized. A similar tradeoff between the variances of Fourier conjugates arises in all systems underlain by Fourier analysis, for example in sound waves: A pure tone is a [[Dirac delta function|sharp spike]] at a single frequency, while its Fourier transform gives the shape of the sound wave in the time domain, which is a completely delocalized sine wave. In quantum mechanics, the two key points are that the position of the particle takes the form of a [[matter wave]], and momentum is its Fourier conjugate, assured by the de Broglie relation {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''\u0127k''}}, where {{mvar|k}} is the [[wavenumber]].\n\nIn [[matrix mechanics]], the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics#Postulates of quantum mechanics|mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]], any pair of non-[[commutator|commuting]] [[self-adjoint operator]]s representing [[observable]]s are subject to similar uncertainty limits. An eigenstate of an observable represents the state of the wavefunction for a certain measurement value (the eigenvalue). For example, if a measurement of an observable {{mvar|A}} is performed, then the system is in a particular eigenstate {{mvar|\u03a8}} of that observable. However, the particular eigenstate of the observable {{mvar|A}} need not be an eigenstate of another observable {{mvar|B}}: If so, then it does not have a unique associated measurement for it, as the system is not in an eigenstate of that observable.<ref>{{Citation|author1=Claude Cohen-Tannoudji |author2=Bernard Diu |author3=Franck Lalo\u00eb |title=Quantum mechanics|year=1996|publisher=Wiley|location=Wiley-Interscience|isbn=978-0-471-56952-7|pages=231\u2013233}}</ref>\n\n===Wave mechanics interpretation===\n(Ref <ref name=\"L&L\">{{cite book\n |author=[[Lev Landau|L.D.

The position of the particle is described by a [[wave function]] <math>\\Psi(x,t)</math>. The time-independent wave function of a single-moded plane wave of wavenumber ''k''<sub>0</sub> or momentum ''p''<sub>0</sub> is\n\n:<math>\\psi(x) \\propto e^{ik_0 x} = e^{ip_0 x/\\hbar} ~.</math>\n\nThe [[Born rule]] states that this should be interpreted as a [[probability density function|probability density amplitude function]] in the sense that the probability of finding the particle between ''a'' and ''b'' is\n\n:<math> \\operatorname P [a \\leq X \\leq b] = \\int_a^b |\\psi(x)|^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}x ~.</math>\n\nIn the case of the single-moded plane wave, <math>|\\psi(x)|^2</math> is a [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]]. In other words, the particle position is extremely uncertain in the sense that it could be essentially anywhere along the wave packet. \n\nOn the other hand, consider a wave function that is a [[superposition principle|sum of many waves]], which we may write this as\n\n:<math>\\psi(x) \\propto \\sum_n A_n e^{i p_n x/\\hbar}~, </math>\nwhere ''A''<sub>''n''</sub> represents the relative contribution of the mode ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> to the overall total. The figures to the right show how with the addition of many plane waves, the wave packet can become more localized. We may take this a step further to the continuum limit, where the wave function is an [[integral]] over all possible modes\n\n:<math>\\psi(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\hbar}} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\varphi(p) \\cdot e^{i p x/\\hbar} \\, dp ~, </math>\n\nwith <math>\\varphi(p)</math> representing the amplitude of these modes and is called the wave function in [[momentum space]]. In mathematical terms, we say that <math>\\varphi(p)</math> is the ''[[Fourier transform]]'' of <math>\\psi(x)</math> and that ''x'' and ''p'' are [[conjugate variables]]. Adding together all of these plane waves comes at a cost, namely the momentum has become less precise, having become a mixture of waves of many different momenta.\n\nOne way to quantify the precision of the position and momentum is the [[standard deviation]]&nbsp;''\u03c3''. Since <math>|\\psi(x)|^2</math> is a probability density function for position, we calculate its standard deviation.\n\nThe precision of the position is improved, i.e. reduced \u03c3<sub>x</sub>, by using many plane waves, thereby weakening the precision of the momentum, i.e. increased \u03c3<sub>p</sub>. Another way of stating this is that \u03c3<sub>x</sub> and \u03c3<sub>p</sub> have an [[inverse relationship]] or are at least bounded from below. This is the uncertainty principle, the exact limit of which is the Kennard bound.

A few of the most common relations found in the literature are given below.\n* For position and linear momentum, the [[canonical commutation relation]] <math>[\\hat{x}, \\hat{p}] = i\\hbar</math> implies the Kennard inequality from above:\n:: <math>\\sigma_x \\sigma_p \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}.</math>\n* For two orthogonal components of the [[angular momentum|total angular momentum]] operator of an object:\n:: <math>\\sigma_{J_i} \\sigma_{J_j} \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\big|\\langle J_k\\rangle\\big|,</math>\n: where ''i'', ''j'', ''k'' are distinct, and ''J''<sub>''i''</sub> denotes angular momentum along the ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> axis. This relation implies that unless all three components vanish together, only a single component of a system's angular momentum can be defined with arbitrary precision, normally the component parallel to an external (magnetic or electric) field. Moreover, for <math>[J_x, J_y] = i \\hbar \\varepsilon_{xyz} J_z</math>, a choice <math>\\hat{A} = J_x</math>, <math>\\hat{B} = J_y</math>, in angular momentum multiplets, ''\u03c8'' = |''j'', ''m''\u3009, bounds the [[Casimir invariant]] (angular momentum squared, <math>\\langle J_x^2+ J_y^2 + J_z^2 \\rangle</math>) from below and thus yields useful constraints such as {{nobr|''j''(''j'' + 1) \u2265 ''m''(''m'' + 1)}}, and hence ''j''\u00a0\u2265\u00a0''m'', among others.\n*{{anchor|Time\u2013energy uncertainty relation}} In non-relativistic mechanics, time is privileged as an [[independent variable]].

To have a definite energy, the frequency of the state must be defined accurately, and this requires the state to hang around for many cycles, the reciprocal of the required accuracy. For example, in [[Electromagnetic spectroscopy|spectroscopy]], excited states have a finite lifetime. By the time\u2013energy uncertainty principle, they do not have a definite energy, and, each time they decay, the energy they release is slightly different. The average energy of the outgoing photon has a peak at the theoretical energy of the state, but the distribution has a finite width called the [[Spectral linewidth|''natural linewidth'']]. Fast-decaying states have a broad linewidth, while slow-decaying states have a narrow linewidth.<ref>The broad linewidth of fast-decaying states makes it difficult to accurately measure the energy of the state, and researchers have even used detuned microwave cavities to slow down the decay rate, to get sharper peaks. {{Citation |last=Gabrielse |first=Gerald |author2=H.

The energy\u2013time uncertainty relation is not, however, an obvious consequence of the general Robertson\u2013Schr\u00f6dinger relation. Since energy bears the same relation to time as momentum does to space in [[special relativity]], it was clear to many early founders, [[Niels Bohr]] among them, that the following relation should hold:<ref name=\"Heisenberg_1927\"/><ref name=\"Heisenberg_1930\"/>\n\n::<math> \\Delta E \\Delta t \\gtrsim h,</math>\n\nbut it was not always obvious what <math>\\Delta t</math> precisely meant. The problem is that the time at which the particle has a given state is not an operator belonging to the particle, it is a parameter describing the evolution of the system. As [[Lev Landau]] once joked \"To violate the time\u2013energy uncertainty relation all I have to do is measure the energy very precisely and then look at my watch!\"<ref name=\"C Jansson\">[https://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.3625 The GMc-interpretation of Quantum Mechanics], by Christian Jansson, February 25, 2008</ref>\n\nOne ''false'' formulation of the energy\u2013time uncertainty principle says that measuring the energy of a quantum system to an accuracy <math>\\Delta E</math> requires a time interval <math>\\Delta t > h/\\Delta E</math>. This formulation is similar to the one alluded to in Landau's joke, and was explicitly invalidated by [[Yakir Aharonov|Y. Aharonov]] and [[David Bohm|D. Bohm]] in 1961.<ref>http://148.216.10.84/archivoshistoricosMQ/ModernaHist/Aharonov%20a.pdf</ref> The time <math>\\Delta t</math> in the uncertainty relation is the time during which the system exists unperturbed, not the time during which the experimental equipment is turned on, whereas the position in the other version of the principle refers to where the particle has some probability to be and not where the observer might look.\n\nAnother common misconception is that the energy\u2013time uncertainty principle says that the [[conservation of energy]] can be temporarily violated\u2014energy can be \"borrowed\" from the universe as long as it is \"returned\" within a short amount of time.<ref name=\"Griffiths2005\"/>   Although this agrees with the ''spirit'' of [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], it is based on the false axiom that the energy of the universe is an exactly known parameter at all times. More accurately, when events transpire at shorter time intervals, there is a greater uncertainty in the energy of these events. Therefore it is not that the conservation of energy is ''violated'' when [[quantum field theory]] uses temporary electron\u2013positron pairs in its calculations, but that the energy of quantum systems is not known with enough precision to limit their behavior to a single, simple history. Thus the influence of ''all histories'' must be incorporated into quantum calculations, including those with much greater or much less energy than the mean of the measured/calculated energy distribution.\n\nIn 1932 Dirac offered a precise definition and derivation of the time\u2013energy uncertainty relation in a relativistic quantum theory of \"events\".<ref>see here, and the linked references: http://www.springerlink.com/content/nwq557633112kxk2/</ref>\n-->\n\n===A counterexample===\nSuppose we consider a quantum [[particle in a ring|particle on a ring]], where the wave function depends on an angular variable <math>\\theta</math>, which we may take to lie in the interval <math>[0,2\\pi]</math>.

The central premise was that the classical concept of motion does not fit at the quantum level, as [[electron]]s in an atom do not travel on sharply defined orbits. Rather, their motion is smeared out in a strange way: the [[Fourier transform]] of its time dependence only involves those frequencies that could be observed in the quantum jumps of their radiation.\n\nHeisenberg's paper did not admit any unobservable quantities like the exact position of the electron in an orbit at any time; he only allowed the theorist to talk about the Fourier components of the motion. Since the Fourier components were not defined at the classical frequencies, they could not be used to construct an exact [[trajectory]], so that the formalism could not answer certain overly precise questions about where the electron was or how fast it was going.\n\nIn March 1926, working in Bohr's institute, Heisenberg realized that the non-[[commutativity]] implies the uncertainty principle. This implication provided a clear physical interpretation for the non-commutativity, and it laid the foundation for what became known as the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. Heisenberg showed that the commutation relation implies an uncertainty, or in Bohr's language a [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]].<ref>{{Citation |first=Niels |last=Bohr |year=1958 |title=Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |page=38 |isbn= |bibcode=1958AmJPh..26..596B |volume=26 |journal=American Journal of Physics |doi=10.1119/1.1934707 |issue=8 |last2=Noll |first2=Waldemar }}</ref> Any two variables that do not commute cannot be measured simultaneously\u2014the more precisely one is known, the less precisely the other can be known.

There is no way to say what the state of a system fundamentally is, only what the result of observations might be.\n\n[[Albert Einstein]] believed that randomness is a reflection of our ignorance of some fundamental property of reality, while [[Niels Bohr]] believed that the probability distributions are fundamental and irreducible, and depend on which measurements we choose to perform. [[Bohr\u2013Einstein debates|Einstein and Bohr debated]] the uncertainty principle for many years.\n\n===The ideal of the detached observer===\n[[Wolfgang Pauli]] called Einstein's fundamental objection to the uncertainty principle \"the ideal of the detached observer\" (phrase translated from the German):\n{{blockquote|\"Like the moon has a definite position\" Einstein said to me last winter, \"whether or not we look at the moon, the same must also hold for the atomic objects, as there is no sharp distinction possible between these and macroscopic objects. Observation cannot ''create'' an element of reality like a position, there must be something contained in the complete description of physical reality which corresponds to the ''possibility'' of observing a position, already before the observation has been actually made.\" I hope, that I quoted Einstein correctly; it is always difficult to quote somebody out of memory with whom one does not agree. It is precisely this kind of postulate which I call the ideal of the detached observer.\n*Letter from Pauli to Niels Bohr, February 15, 1955<ref>{{cite book|editor=Enz, Charles P.|editor2=Meyenn, Karl von|title=Writings on physics and philosophy by Wolfgang Pauli|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1994|page=43|postscript=; translated by Robert Schlapp|isbn=3-540-56859-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ueTd4g7pc5MC&pg=PA43}}</ref>}}\n===Einstein's slit===\nThe first of Einstein's [[thought experiment]]s challenging the uncertainty principle went as follows:\n\n:Consider a particle passing through a slit of width {{mvar|d}}. The slit introduces an uncertainty in momentum of approximately {{mvar|{{sfrac|h|d}}}} because the particle passes through the wall. But let us determine the momentum of the particle by measuring the recoil of the wall. In doing so, we find the momentum of the particle to arbitrary accuracy by conservation of momentum.\n\nBohr's response was that the wall is quantum mechanical as well, and that to measure the recoil to accuracy {{math|\u0394''p''}}, the momentum of the wall must be known to this accuracy before the particle passes through. This introduces an uncertainty in the position of the wall and therefore the position of the slit equal to {{math|{{sfrac|''h''|\u0394''p''}}}}, and if the wall's momentum is known precisely enough to measure the recoil, the slit's position is uncertain enough to disallow a position measurement.\n\nA similar analysis with particles diffracting through multiple slits is given by [[Richard Feynman]].<ref>Feynman lectures on Physics, vol 3, 2\u20132</ref>\n\n===Einstein's box===\nBohr was present when Einstein proposed the thought experiment which has become known as [[Einstein's box]]. Einstein argued that \"Heisenberg's uncertainty equation implied that the uncertainty in time was related to the uncertainty in energy, the product of the two being related to [[Planck's constant]].\"<ref name=\"Gamow\">Gamow, G., ''The great physicists from Galileo to Einstein'', Courier Dover, 1988, p.260.</ref> Consider, he said, an ideal box, lined with mirrors so that it can contain light indefinitely. The box could be weighed before a clockwork mechanism opened an ideal shutter at a chosen instant to allow one single photon to escape. \"We now know, explained Einstein, precisely the time at which the photon left the box.\"<ref>Kumar, M., ''Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality'', Icon, 2009, p. 282.</ref> \"Now, weigh the box again. The change of mass tells the energy of the emitted light. In this manner, said Einstein, one could measure the energy emitted and the time it was released with any desired precision, in contradiction to the uncertainty principle.\"<ref name=\"Gamow\" />\n\nBohr spent a sleepless night considering this argument, and eventually realized that it was flawed. He pointed out that if the box were to be weighed, say by a spring and a pointer on a scale, \"since the box must move vertically with a change in its weight, there will be uncertainty in its vertical velocity and therefore an uncertainty in its height above the table. ... Furthermore, the uncertainty about the elevation above the earth's surface will result in an uncertainty in the rate of the clock,\"<ref>Gamow, G., ''The great physicists from Galileo to Einstein'', Courier Dover, 1988, p. 260\u2013261.</ref> because of Einstein's own theory of [[Gravitational time dilation|gravity's effect on time]].\n\"Through this chain of uncertainties, Bohr showed that Einstein's light box experiment could not simultaneously measure exactly both the energy of the photon and the time of its escape.\"<ref>Kumar, M., ''Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality'', Icon, 2009, p. 287.</ref>\n\n===EPR paradox for entangled particles===\nBohr was compelled to modify his understanding of the uncertainty principle after another thought experiment by Einstein. In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (see [[EPR paradox]]) published an analysis of widely separated [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]] particles. Measuring one particle, Einstein realized, would alter the probability distribution of the other, yet here the other particle could not possibly be disturbed. This example led Bohr to revise his understanding of the principle, concluding that the uncertainty was not caused by a direct interaction.<ref>{{Citation |first=Walter |last=Isaacson |year=2007 |title=Einstein: His Life and Universe |location=New York |publisher=Simon & Schuster |page=[https://archive.org/details/einsteinhislifeu0000isaa/page/452 452] |isbn=978-0-7432-6473-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/einsteinhislifeu0000isaa/page/452 }}</ref>\n\nBut Einstein came to much more far-reaching conclusions from the same thought experiment. He believed the \"natural basic assumption\" that a complete description of reality would have to predict the results of experiments from \"locally changing deterministic quantities\" and therefore would have to include more information than the maximum possible allowed by the uncertainty principle.\n\nIn 1964, [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] showed that this assumption can be falsified, since it would imply a certain inequality between the probabilities of different experiments. Experimental results confirm the predictions of quantum mechanics, ruling out Einstein's basic assumption that led him to the suggestion of his ''hidden variables''. These hidden variables may be \"hidden\" because of an illusion that occurs during observations of objects that are too large or too small.  This illusion can be likened to rotating fan blades that seem to pop in and out of existence at different locations and sometimes seem to be in the same place at the same time when observed.  This same illusion manifests itself in the observation of subatomic particles.  Both the fan blades and the subatomic particles are moving so fast that the illusion is seen by the observer.  Therefore, it is possible that there would be predictability of the subatomic particles behavior and characteristics to a recording device capable of very high speed tracking....Ironically this fact is one of the best pieces of evidence supporting [[Karl Popper]]'s philosophy of [[Falsifiability|invalidation of a theory by falsification-experiments]]. That is to say, here Einstein's \"basic assumption\" became falsified by [[Bell test experiments|experiments based on Bell's inequalities]]. For the objections of Karl Popper to the Heisenberg inequality itself, see below.\n\nWhile it is possible to assume that quantum mechanical predictions are due to nonlocal, hidden variables, and in fact [[David Bohm]] invented such a formulation, this resolution is not satisfactory to the vast majority of physicists. The question of whether a random outcome is predetermined by a nonlocal theory can be philosophical, and it can be potentially intractable. If the hidden variables were not constrained, they could just be a list of random digits that are used to produce the measurement outcomes. To make it sensible, the assumption of nonlocal hidden variables is sometimes augmented by a second assumption\u2014that the [[size of the observable universe]] puts a limit on the computations that these variables can do. A nonlocal theory of this sort predicts that a [[quantum computer]] would encounter fundamental obstacles when attempting to factor numbers of approximately 10,000 digits or more; a potentially [[Shor's algorithm|achievable task]] in quantum mechanics.<ref>[[Gerardus 't Hooft]] has at times advocated this point of view.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n=== Popper's criticism ===\n{{main article|Popper's experiment}}\n[[Karl Popper]] approached the problem of indeterminacy as a logician and [[Philosophical realism|metaphysical realist]].<ref name=\"Popper1959\">{{Citation | last1 = Popper | first1 = Karl | authorlink1 = Karl Popper | title = The Logic of Scientific Discovery | publisher = Hutchinson & Co. | year = 1959| title-link = The Logic of Scientific Discovery }}</ref> He disagreed with the application of the uncertainty relations to individual particles rather than to [[Quantum ensemble|ensembles]] of identically prepared particles, referring to them as \"statistical scatter relations\".<ref name=\"Popper1959\" /><ref name=\"Jarvie2006\">{{Citation | last1 = Jarvie | first1 = Ian Charles | last2 = Milford | first2 = Karl | last3 = Miller | first3 = David W | title = Karl Popper: a centenary assessment | volume = 3 | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-7546-5712-5}}</ref> In this statistical interpretation, a ''particular'' measurement may be made to arbitrary precision without invalidating the quantum theory. This directly contrasts with the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, which is [[Determinism|non-deterministic]] but lacks local hidden variables.\n\nIn 1934, Popper published ''Zur Kritik der Ungenauigkeitsrelationen'' (''Critique of the Uncertainty Relations'') in ''[[Naturwissenschaften]]'',<ref name=\"Popper1934\">{{Citation | title = Zur Kritik der Ungenauigkeitsrelationen (Critique of the Uncertainty Relations) | journal = Naturwissenschaften | year = 1934 | first = Karl | last = Popper | author2 = Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker | volume = 22 | issue = 48 | pages = 807\u2013808 | doi=10.1007/BF01496543|bibcode = 1934NW.....22..807P | postscript = . }}</ref> and in the same year ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery|Logik der Forschung]]'' (translated and updated by the author as ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' in 1959), outlining his arguments for the statistical interpretation. In 1982, he further developed his theory in ''Quantum theory and the schism in Physics'', writing:\n<blockquote>[Heisenberg's] formulae are, beyond all doubt, derivable ''statistical formulae'' of the quantum theory. But they have been ''habitually misinterpreted'' by those quantum theorists who said that these formulae can be interpreted as determining some upper limit to the ''precision of our measurements''.

On 20 April 1912, the school was renamed as the ''\u0130stanbul Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbnu'' (Istanbul House of Multiple Sciences) while the number of courses were increased and the curricula were modernized with the establishment of the Schools of Medicine, Law, Applied Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics), Literature and Theology.\n\nOn 21 April 1924, the [[Republic of Turkey]] recognized the ''\u0130stanbul Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbnu'' as a state school, and on 7 October 1925, the administrative autonomy of ''\u0130stanbul Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbnu'' was recognized while the ''Schools'' (within the old Medrese system) became modern ''Faculties''.\n\nOn 1 August 1933, ''\u0130stanbul Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbnu'' was reorganized as ''\u0130stanbul \u00dcniversitesi'' (Istanbul University) following the [[Atat\u00fcrk's Reforms|educational reforms]] of [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]]. Classes officially began on 1 November 1933.\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:Istanbul University campus ruins March 2008d.JPG|thumb|Late [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and early [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] remains at the Istanbul University campus next to [[Beyaz\u0131t Tower]].]]\n[[File:University Istanbul main building interior March 2008pano.jpg|thumb|upright|Interior of the main building]]The university has seventeen faculties on five campuses; the main campus being on [[Beyaz\u0131t Square]], which was originally built by [[Constantine the Great]] as the ''Forum Tauri'' and was later enlarged by [[Theodosius I|Theodosius the Great]] as the ''[[Forum of Theodosius]]'' during the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] period.\n\nThe main campus building with its landmark gate was previously used as the headquarters of the ''Harbiye Nezareti'' (Ministry of War) by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] government.
