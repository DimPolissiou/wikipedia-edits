As the climate changes, distributors of infectious diseases such as mosquitoes and ticks spread to new areas and transmit illnesses to regions which may not have experienced them otherwise. Epidemics are also made more likely after severe weather events, such as heavy rainfall or flooding. Food scarcity may lead some communities to a more meat-based diet, which raises the risk of outbreaks of diseases such as [[Ebola virus disease|ebola]]. Melting permafrost also threatens to release diseases that have been dormant for many years, as was the case in August 2016 when a thawed reindeer carcass that was almost a century old infected several individuals in [[Siberia]] with [[anthrax]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.contagionlive.com/news/the-ripple-effect-of-climate-change-on-epidemic-risk|title=The Ripple Effect of Climate Change on Epidemic Risk|website=ContagionLive|access-date=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\n=== Food scarcity ===\nMany plants have a maximum temperature at which they can grow, and climate change may mean that new pests are introduced to areas where it was too cold for them to survive before.

There have been several explanations put forward for these changes, but the prevailing paradigm is that these changes were a result of changes in ocean currents, specifically the northward transport of heat by the [[Atlantic meridional overturning circulation]] (AMOC). One example of this is the [[Younger Dryas]], in which a rapid decline in temperature, recorded in Greenland as a drop of 4 to 10\u00b0C (7.2 to 18\u00b0F) over just a few decades, is thought to have been caused by the melting of the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] providing extra freshwater to the North Atlantic and interrupting the AMOC.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lynch-Stieglitz|first=Jean|date=2017-01-03|title=The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and Abrupt Climate Change|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-marine-010816-060415|journal=Annual Review of Marine Science|volume=9|issue=1|pages=83\u2013104|doi=10.1146/annurev-marine-010816-060415|issn=1941-1405}}</ref>\n\nIt is believed that recent climate change has caused a 15-20% slowing of the [[Gulf Stream]], a current which transports warm water from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] towards north-west Europe, due to a melting of the [[Greenland Ice Sheet]] resulting in large amounts of freshwater pouring into the North Atlantic.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Connor|first=Steve|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/gulf-stream-is-slowing-down-faster-than-ever-scientists-say-10128700.html|title=Gulf Stream is slowing down faster than ever, scientists say|date=|work=Independent|access-date=15 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Although it is likely to continue to slow, it is unproven whether the Gulf Stream could come to a complete halt this century, if ever.

A 200-year drought caused cities of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] to be abandoned; the [[Khmer Empire]] collapsed as a result of successive droughts and monsoon floods which led to political and social unrest; and a period of cooling called the [[Little Ice Age]] made it more difficult for [[Vikings]] to farm in Greenland, which was one of the reasons that they were forced to abandon their settlements.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nMore recently, a severe drought in the late 2000s which is likely to have been intensified by anthropogenic climate change contributed to failing agricultural production in [[Syria]], leading to high unemployment, large amounts of internal displacement, heightened ethnic tensions and increased violence. Poor governance and [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic policies also contributed to the resulting [[Syrian Civil War|civil war]] and societal collapse in 2011.<ref name=\":72\" />\n\nAlthough the entire planet is affected by climate change, the worst impacts will be felt by the world's poorest countries, and these countries are both more likely to face the effects of societal collapse and more likely to face such effects sooner.

Studies have shown that extreme weather events can damage economies, lower food production and raise inequality, which can increase risks of violence when combined with other factors.

Climate change can also lead to heavier rainfall in some areas, leading to rapid movement of water to the oceans and reducing the capacity of people to use and store it. In other areas rainfall is reduced, and overall the world experiences more extreme floods and droughts as a result of climate change. Warmer air also results in higher rainfall and less snowfall and an increase in evaporation rates.

This has many impacts including the cooling of the Earth and oceans leading to lower rainfall and more droughts. These pollutants also lead to the formation of [[smog]] and [[acid rain]] and cause various [[Respiratory disease|respiratory diseases]].

It described this as the \"[[Hothouse Earth]]\" scenario and proposed a threshold of around 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, arguing that decisions taken over the next decade could influence the climate of the planet for tens to hundreds of thousands of years and potentially even lead to conditions which are inhospitable to current human societies. The report also states that there is a possibility of a cascade of tipping points being triggered even if the goal outlined in the [[Paris Agreement]] to limit warming to 1.5-2.0\u00b0C (2.7-3.6\u00b0F) is achieved.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Point of collapse ===\nEven in mid-range scenarios of around 3\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, extreme weather events, large-scale loss of agricultural land and freshwater sources, and collapsing ecosystems could lead to widespread suffering and instability and over a billion people who currently live in major coastal cities would need to be relocated due to sea-level rise.

One example of this is the [[Younger Dryas]], in which a rapid decline in temperature, recorded in Greenland as a drop of 4 to 10\u00b0C (7.2 to 18\u00b0F) over just a few decades, is thought to have been caused by the melting of the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] providing extra freshwater to the North Atlantic and interrupting the AMOC.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lynch-Stieglitz|first=Jean|date=2017-01-03|title=The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and Abrupt Climate Change|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-marine-010816-060415|journal=Annual Review of Marine Science|volume=9|issue=1|pages=83\u2013104|doi=10.1146/annurev-marine-010816-060415|issn=1941-1405}}</ref>\n\nIt is believed that recent climate change has caused a 15-20% slowing of the [[Gulf Stream]], a current which transports warm water from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] towards north-west Europe, due to a melting of the [[Greenland Ice Sheet]] resulting in large amounts of freshwater pouring into the North Atlantic.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Connor|first=Steve|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/gulf-stream-is-slowing-down-faster-than-ever-scientists-say-10128700.html|title=Gulf Stream is slowing down faster than ever, scientists say|date=|work=Independent|access-date=15 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Although it is likely to continue to slow, it is unproven whether the Gulf Stream could come to a complete halt this century, if ever.

A 200-year drought caused cities of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] to be abandoned; the [[Khmer Empire]] collapsed as a result of successive droughts and monsoon floods which led to political and social unrest; and a period of cooling called the [[Little Ice Age]] made it more difficult for [[Vikings]] to farm in Greenland, which was one of the reasons that they were forced to abandon their settlements.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nMore recently, a severe drought in the late 2000s which is likely to have been intensified by anthropogenic climate change contributed to failing agricultural production in [[Syria]], leading to high unemployment, large amounts of internal displacement, heightened ethnic tensions and increased violence.

In other areas rainfall is reduced, and overall the world experiences more extreme floods and droughts as a result of climate change.

The authors write that in this scenario climate change causes humanity to undergo a permanent shift in its relationship to nature.<ref name=\":42\" />\n\nIn the \"catastrophic\" scenario, the authors write that human society would struggle to adapt, and note that this scenario is so extreme that its impacts are difficult to imagine. The authors encourage readers to compare the scenario to the threat of terrorism, emphasising that the solution to both threats relies on a transformation of the world's energy economy.<ref name=\":42\" />\n\n=== \"The 2050 scenario\" ===\nIn May 2019, [[Breakthrough - National Centre for Climate Restoration]] released a report which argued that climate change represents an existential threat to human civilisation in the near to mid-term, calling for a wartime level of response to combat it.<ref name=\":22\">Spratt, David; Dunlop, Ian T.

Within this scenario, policy-makers fail to act sufficiently and global emissions do not peak until 2030. Climate feedbacks are triggered which lead to global warming of 1.6\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels by 2030, and 3\u00b0C by 2050, leading the Earth into the \"hothouse Earth\" scenario. Sea levels increase by 2-3 metres by 2100, with an eventual 25 metres of sea-level rise locked in. Some regions become unlivable due to the intense heat and lack of adaptive capacity and around a billion people are displaced, while two billion people suffer from water shortages. There is not enough food to feed the global population and many of the world's most populous cities are abandoned due to sea level rise.<ref name=\":22\" />\n\n=== Famous figures ===\nIn an interview for [[The Ecologist]], the Emeritus Director of the [[Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research]] [[Hans Joachim Schellnhuber|Prof. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber]] warned that if we continue as we are now, then over the next century we may bring civilization to an end.

It reports on events in Earth's natural history.\n\n==Typical content==\n''Earthweek'' provides a weekly overview of headline events affecting the planet\u2014cyclones, floods, brushfires, oil spills and climate change. Other stories are a bit more unusual\u2014monkey attacks, snake infestations and a bounty of phenomena as diverse as nature itself.\n\n''Earthweek'' initially focused mainly on breaking weather news stories, along with a complement of items about volcanic eruptions, [[El Ni\u00f1o]] outbreaks and unusual animal stories.  That focus has widened in recent years to be more inclusive of [[global warming]] issues and how wildlife is reacting to the changing climate.\n\n==Format==\nThe feature was the first fully paginated newspaper column to be distributed with placed graphics, thanks to the growing popularity of the [[Macintosh]] computer platform in newspaper graphics departments during the late 1980s.\n\nDue to the slow [[modem]] speeds common in 1988, early versions of ''Earthweek'' were limited to low-resolution graphics.

It reports on events in Earth's natural history.\n\n==Typical content==\n''Earthweek'' provides a weekly overview of headline events affecting the planet\u2014cyclones, floods, brushfires, oil spills and climate change. Other stories are a bit more unusual\u2014monkey attacks, snake infestations and a bounty of phenomena as diverse as nature itself.\n\n''Earthweek'' initially focused mainly on breaking weather news stories, along with a complement of items about volcanic eruptions, [[El Ni\u00f1o]] outbreaks and unusual animal stories.  That focus has widened in recent years to be more inclusive of [[global warming]] issues and how wildlife is reacting to the changing climate.\n\n==Format==\nThe feature was the first fully paginated newspaper column to be distributed with placed graphics, thanks to the growing popularity of the [[Macintosh]] computer platform in newspaper graphics departments during the late 1980s.\n\nDue to the slow [[modem]] speeds common in 1988, early versions of ''Earthweek'' were limited to low-resolution graphics. Subscribing newspapers maintained a library of individual [[icon (computing)|icons]] and the base map, which were used by the \"wire frame\" of the [[Pagemaker]] document distributed to them each week.
