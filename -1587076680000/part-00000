Gacy regularly performed at children's hospitals and charitable events as \"Pogo the Clown\" or \"Patches the Clown\", clowning persona he devised. He was also active in his local community as a precinct captain and building contractor.\n\nIt is believed all of Gacy's known murders were committed inside his [[Ranch-style house|ranch house]] in [[Norwood Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Norwood Park]], a part of [[Chicago metropolitan area|metropolitan Chicago]]. Once lured to his home, Gacy typically duped his victims into donning [[handcuffs]] on the pretext of being shown a [[Magic (illusion)|magic trick]]. He then raped and tortured his captive before killing his victim by either [[asphyxiation]] or [[strangulation]] with a makeshift [[garrote]]. 26 of Gacy's victims were buried in the [[crawl space]] of his home. Three others were buried elsewhere on his property, while his last four victims were discarded in the [[Des Plaines River]].\n\nGacy was convicted of the [[sodomy]] of a teenage boy in Iowa in 1968. He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, but was released after serving 18 months of his sentence. His first murder occurred in 1972 and at least 30 subsequent murders were committed after the divorce of his second wife in 1976. Investigation into the case of missing [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]] teenager Robert Piest led to Gacy's arrest on December 21, 1978.\n\nThe conviction for 33 murders was then the largest number of murders charged to one individual in United States history. Gacy was sentenced to death on March 13, 1980. He remained on death row at [[Menard Correctional Center]] for 14 years, spending much of his time painting, and was executed by [[lethal injection]] at [[Stateville Correctional Center]] on May 10, 1994. \n\n==Early life==\nJohn Wayne Gacy was born in Chicago, [[Illinois]] on March 17, 1942, the second child and only son of John Stanley Gacy (June 20, 1900 \u2013 December 25, 1969) and Marion Elaine Robinson (May 4, 1908 \u2013 December 6, 1989).<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 63.</ref> His father was an auto repair machinist and [[World War I]] veteran,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=24}} and his mother was a homemaker.<ref>Cook County marriage records provide his mother's name as Marion E.

He was close to his two sisters and mother but endured a difficult relationship with his father, an [[alcoholic]] who was [[physical abuse|physically abusive]] to his wife and children.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=256\u2013257}} Gacy seldom received his father's approval, later recollecting that, no matter what he achieved, he was \"never good enough\" in his father's eyes.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=31}}  His father regularly belittled him, calling him \"dumb and stupid\" and comparing him unfavorably with his sisters.<ref>''Serial Killers.'' pp. 54\u201355.</ref> Despite this, Gacy always denied ever hating his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=21}} \n\nOne of Gacy's earliest childhood memories was of being beaten with a leather belt at the age of four for accidentally disarranging car engine components his father had assembled.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=18\u201319}} On another occasion, he was struck across the head with a broomstick and rendered [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]].<ref>{{cite book | first1=Jason| last1=Moss| first2=Jeffrey| last2=Kottler| title=The Last Victim: A True-life Journey into the Mind of the Serial Killer| publisher=Grand Central Publishing| location=New York City| date=2000|isbn=0-7535-0398-0| p=103}}</ref> When he was six years old, Gacy stole a toy truck from a neighborhood store. His mother made him walk back to the store, return the toy and apologize to the owners. His mother informed his father, who beat Gacy with a belt as punishment. After this incident, Gacy's mother attempted to shield her son from his father's verbal and physical abuse,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=26}} yet this only succeeded in Gacy earning accusations that he was a \"[[sissy]]\" and a \"Mama's boy\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} who would \"probably grow up [[queer]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=40}}\n\nIn 1949, Gacy's father was informed that his son and another boy had been caught sexually fondling a young girl.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=218}} Gacy's father whipped him with a [[razor strop]] as punishment. The same year,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=17}} Gacy was [[child molestation|molested]] by a family friend,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} a contractor who would take Gacy for rides in his truck and then fondle him. Gacy never told his father about these incidents, afraid that his father would blame him.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\">''Serial Killers''. p. 54.</ref>\n\nBecause of a heart condition, Gacy was ordered to avoid all sports at school.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\" /> During the fourth grade, Gacy began to experience [[Syncope (medicine)|blackout]]s. He was occasionally hospitalized because of these seizures, and also in 1957 for a [[appendicitis|burst appendix]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=18}} Gacy later estimated that between the ages of 14 and 18, he had spent almost a year in the hospital for these episodes, and attributed the decline of his grades to his missing school. His father suspected the episodes were an effort to gain sympathy and attention, and openly accused his son of faking the condition as the boy lay in a hospital bed.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |issn=1364-5803 |page=5}}</ref> Although his mother, sisters, and few close friends never doubted his illness, Gacy's medical condition was never conclusively diagnosed.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=32}}\n\nOne of Gacy's friends at high school recalled several instances in which his father ridiculed or beat his son without provocation. On one occasion in 1957, the same friend witnessed an incident at the Gacy household in which Gacy's father began shouting at his son for no reason, then began hitting him.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=33}} Gacy's mother attempted to intervene. The friend recalled that Gacy simply \"put up his hands to defend himself\", adding that he never struck his father back during these physical altercations.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n===Career origins===\nIn 1960, at the age of 18, Gacy became involved in politics, working as an assistant [[precinct captain]] for a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] candidate in his neighborhood. This decision earned more criticism from his father, who accused his son of being a \"[[wikt:Special:Search/dupe|patsy]]\". Gacy later speculated the decision may have been an attempt to seek the acceptance from others that he never received from his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=36}}\n\nThe same year Gacy became a Democratic candidate, his father bought him a car, with the title of the vehicle being in his father's name until Gacy had completed the monthly repayments.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=42}} These repayments took several years to complete, and his father would confiscate the keys to the vehicle if Gacy did not do as his father said. On one occasion in 1962, Gacy bought an extra set of keys after his father confiscated the original set. In response, his father removed the [[distributor cap]] from the vehicle, withholding the component for three days. Gacy recalled that as a result of this incident, he felt \"totally sick; drained\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=44}} When his father replaced the distributor cap, Gacy left the family home and drove to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he found work within the ambulance service before he was transferred to work as an attendant at Palm Mortuary.\n\nIn his role as a mortuary attendant, Gacy slept on a cot behind the [[embalming]] room.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Cahill|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OF6itYw0HT0C&pg=PT30&lpg=PT30#v=onepage&q/ |title=Buried Dreams: Inside the Mind of a Serial Killer|publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=New York City|date=1986|access-date=March 14, 2013|isbn=978-0553051155}}</ref> He worked in this role for three months.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} In this role, he observed morticians embalming dead bodies and later confessed that, on one evening while alone, he had clambered into the coffin of a deceased teenage male, embracing and caressing the body before experiencing a sense of shock.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}}{{efn|Gacy later claimed to have engaged in acts of [[necrophilia]] on approximately two occasions while he worked at Palm Mortuary. He justified his actions by claiming the bodies he had defiled were \"just dead things\" who \"couldn't tell anybody\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=346}}}} This prompted Gacy to call his mother the next day and ask whether his father would allow him to return home.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}} His father agreed and the same day, Gacy drove back to live with his family in Chicago.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=347}}\n\nUpon his return, despite the fact he had failed to graduate from high school, Gacy successfully enrolled in the [[Northwestern College (Illinois)|Northwestern Business College]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=47}} from which he graduated in 1963. Gacy subsequently took a management trainee position within the Nunn-Bush Shoe Company.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=18\u201319}} In 1964, the shoe company transferred Gacy to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] to work as a salesman.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} He was eventually promoted to manager of his department. In March of that year, he became engaged to Marlynn Myers, a co-worker in the department he managed.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}\n\nDuring his courtship with Marlynn, Gacy joined the local [[Jaycees]] and became a tireless worker for the organization, being named Key Man for the organization in April 1964.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 58.</ref> The same year, Gacy had his second homosexual experience. According to Gacy, he acquiesced to this incident after one of his colleagues in the Springfield Jaycees plied him with drinks and invited him to spend the evening upon his sofa; the colleague then performed [[oral sex]] upon him while he was drunk.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish Printworks|location=London, England|issn=1364-5803 |page=7}}</ref> By 1965, Gacy had risen to the position of vice-president of the Springfield Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=20\u201322}} The same year, he was named as the third most outstanding Jaycee within the state of Illinois.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=48}}\n\n==Waterloo, Iowa==\nAfter a nine-month courtship, Gacy and Myers married in September 1964. Marlynn's father subsequently purchased three [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] restaurants in [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], [[Iowa]], and the couple moved to Waterloo so he could manage the restaurants, with the understanding that they would move into Marlynn's parents' home (which was vacated for the couple).{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=261\u2013262}} The offer was lucrative: Gacy would receive $15,000 per year (the equivalent of $115,513 {{as of|2020|lc=y|df=US}}), plus a share of profits earned via the restaurants.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=50}} Following his obligatory completion of a managerial course, Gacy relocated to Waterloo with his wife later that year.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=23\u201325}}\n\n=== Waterloo Jaycees ===\nIn Waterloo, Gacy joined the local chapter of the Jaycees, regularly offering extended hours to the organization in addition to the 12- and 14-hour days he worked managing three restaurants. Although considered ambitious and something of a braggart by his colleagues in the Jaycees, he was highly regarded as a worker on several fund-raising projects. In 1967, he was named \"outstanding vice-president\" of the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=28}} At Jaycee meetings, Gacy often provided free fried chicken to his colleagues and insisted upon being given the nickname \"[[Colonel Sanders|Colonel]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=51}} The same year, Gacy served on the Board of Directors for the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=51}}\n\nGacy's wife gave birth to two children: a son was born in February 1966, followed by a daughter in March 1967. Gacy himself later described this period of his life as \"perfect\", adding that he finally earned the long-sought approval of his father. On one occasion in July 1966, Gacy's parents paid a visit to Iowa, during which his father apologized privately to him for the physical and emotional abuse he had inflicted on him throughout his childhood, before proudly informing him: \"Son, I was wrong about you.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=53}}\n\nHowever, there was an unseemlier side of Jaycee life in Waterloo that involved [[wife swapping]],<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> [[prostitution]], [[pornography]], and drug use. Gacy was deeply involved in many of these activities and regularly cheated on his wife with local prostitutes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=263}} Much of this  happened at the Clayton House Motel. He is also known to have opened a \"club\" in his basement, where he allowed his employees to drink alcohol and play pool. Although Gacy employed teenagers of both sexes at his restaurants, he socialized only with his young male employees. Many were given alcohol before Gacy made sexual advances toward them, which, if rebuffed, he would claim were jokes or a test of morals.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}}\n\n====Assault of Donald Voorhees====\nIn August 1967, Gacy committed his first known [[sexual assault]] upon a teenage boy. The victim was 15-year-old Donald Voorhees, the son of a fellow Jaycee. Gacy lured Voorhees to his house with the promise of showing him pornographic films.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=55}} Gacy plied Voorhees with alcohol and persuaded the youth to perform oral sex upon him. Over the following months, several other youths were sexually abused in a similar manner, including one whom Gacy encouraged to have sex with his own wife before [[blackmail]]ing the youth into performing oral sex upon him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}} Gacy tricked several teenagers into believing he was commissioned with conducting homosexual experiments in the interests of \"scientific research\", for which each was paid up to $50.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=266}}\n\nIn March 1968, Voorhees reported to his father that Gacy had sexually assaulted him. Voorhees Sr. immediately informed the police and Gacy was arrested and subsequently charged with oral [[Sodomy law|sodomy]] in relation to Voorhees and the attempted assault of 16-year-old Edward Lynch.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=267}} Gacy vehemently denied the charges and demanded to take a [[polygraph test]]. This request was granted, although the results indicated Gacy was nervous when he denied any wrongdoing in relation to either Voorhees or Lynch.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n\nGacy publicly denied any wrongdoing and insisted the charges against him were politically motivated \u2013 Voorhees Sr. had opposed Gacy's nomination for appointment as president of the Iowa Jaycees.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=66}} Several fellow Jaycees found Gacy's story credible and rallied to his support. However, on May 10, 1968, Gacy was indicted on the sodomy charge.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = ''\"The most striking aspect of the test results is the patient's total denial of responsibility for everything that has happened to him. He can produce an 'alibi' for everything. He presents himself as a victim of circumstances and blames other people who are out to get him ... the patient attempts to assure a sympathetic response by depicting himself as being at the mercy of a hostile environment.\"''\n| source = Section of report detailing Gacy's 1968 psychiatric evaluation.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=270}}\n| width = 30em\n}}\nOn August 30, 1968, Gacy persuaded one of his employees, 18-year-old Russell Schroeder, to [[assault|physically assault]] Voorhees in an effort to discourage the boy from testifying against him at the upcoming trial. Schroeder agreed to lure Voorhees to a secluded spot, spray [[Mace (spray)|Mace]] in his face and beat him. Gacy promised to pay Schroeder $300 if he followed through on the plot. In early September, Schroeder lured Voorhees to an isolated county park, sprayed Mace supplied by Gacy into the youth's eyes, then beat him, all the while shouting that he was not to testify against Gacy at his upcoming trial.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=72}}<ref name=\"Michael H.

The New Evil: Understanding the Emergence of Modern Violent Crime (Amherst, New York: Prometheus Books, 2019), pp. 196-203.</ref>\n\nVoorhees managed to escape, and immediately reported the assault to the police, identifying Schroeder as his attacker. Schroeder was arrested the following day. Despite initially denying any involvement, he soon confessed to having assaulted Voorhees, indicating that he had done so at Gacy's request. Gacy was arrested and additionally charged in relation to hiring Schroeder to assault and [[Witness tampering|intimidate]] Voorhees.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=268\u2013270}}\n\nOn September 12, Gacy was ordered to undergo a [[Psychological evaluation|psychiatric evaluation]] at the Psychiatric Hospital of the State University of Iowa.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=270}} Two doctors had examined Gacy over a period of 17 days before concluding he had an [[antisocial personality disorder]] (a disorder which incorporates constructs such as [[sociopathy]] and [[psychopathy]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/antisocial-personality-disorder |title=Antisocial Personality Disorder |magazine=[[Psychology Today]]|publisher=Sussex Publishers|location=New York City |date=April 19, 2017 |accessdate=January 13, 2018 }}</ref> was unlikely to benefit from any therapy or medical treatment, and that his behavior pattern was likely to bring him into repeated conflict with society.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} The doctors also concluded he was mentally competent to stand trial.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}}\n\n=====Conviction and imprisonment=====\n[[File:John Wayne Gacy (mugshot).jpg|thumb|[[Mug shot]]s of Gacy, following his December 1968 sodomy conviction.]]\nUpon advice from his attorney, Gacy entered a plea of guilty to one count of sodomy in relation to the charges filed against him by Donald Voorhees. He pleaded not guilty to the other charges lodged against him by other youths at a formal [[arraignment]] held on November 7, 1968. Before the judge, Gacy contended that he and Voorhees had indeed engaged in sexual relations, yet he insisted Voorhees had offered his sexual services to him and that he had acted out of curiosity.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} His story was not believed. Despite his lawyers' recommendations for [[probation]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=84}} Gacy was convicted of sodomy on December 3, 1968,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} and sentenced to 10 years at the [[Anamosa State Penitentiary]].{{sfn|Peck|Dolch|2001|p=260}} On the day Gacy was convicted and sentenced, his wife petitioned for [[divorce]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=85}} requesting possession of the couple's home, property, sole custody of their two children and subsequent [[alimony]] payments.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=40}} The Court ruled in her favor and the divorce was finalized on September 18, 1969. Gacy never saw his first wife or children again.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=274}}\n\nDuring his incarceration in the Anamosa State Penitentiary, Gacy rapidly acquired a reputation as a model prisoner.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=273}} Within months of his arrival, he had risen to the position of head cook. He also joined the inmate Jaycee chapter and increased their membership figure from 50 to 650 in the span of less than 18 months. He is also known to have both secured an increase in the inmates' daily pay in the prison mess hall{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=88}} and to have supervised several projects to improve conditions for inmates at the prison.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=89}} On one occasion, Gacy oversaw the installation of a [[miniature golf]] course in the prison's recreation yard.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 62.</ref>\n\nIn June 1969, Gacy first applied to the State of Iowa Board of Parole for early release: this application was denied. In preparation for a second scheduled parole hearing in May 1970, Gacy completed 16 high school courses, for which he obtained his diploma in November 1969.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}}\n\nOn [[Christmas Day]] 1969, Gacy's father died from [[cirrhosis]] of the [[liver]].{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}} Gacy was not informed that his father had died until two days after his death. When he heard the news, Gacy was said to have collapsed to the floor, sobbing uncontrollably, and had to be supported by prison staff.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}} Gacy requested supervised compassionate leave from prison to attend his father's funeral in Chicago, but his request was denied.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|page=92}}\n\n==Return to Chicago==\nGacy was granted parole with 12 months' probation on June 18, 1970, after serving 18 months of his 10-year sentence.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=277}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}}{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=63}}{{sfn|Linedecker|1986|p=47}} Two of the conditions of his probation were for Gacy to relocate to Chicago to live with his mother and to observe a 10:00&nbsp;p.m. [[curfew]],{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}} with the Iowa Board of Parole receiving regular updates as to his progress.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=96}}\n\nUpon his release, Gacy told friend and fellow Jaycee Clarence Lane\u2014who picked him up from the prison upon release and had remained steadfast in his belief of Gacy's innocence\u2014that he would \"never go back to jail\" and that he intended to re-establish himself in Waterloo. However, within 24 hours of his release, Gacy relocated to Chicago to live with his mother.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}} He arrived in Chicago on June 19 and shortly thereafter obtained a job as a [[short-order cook]] in a restaurant.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=49}}\n\nOn February 12, 1971, Gacy was charged with sexually assaulting a teenage boy.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=95}} The youth claimed that Gacy had lured him into his car at Chicago's [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus]] terminal and driven him to his home, where he had attempted to force the youth into sex. This complaint was subsequently dismissed when the youth failed to appear in court. The Iowa Board of Parole did not learn of this incident (which violated the conditions of his parole) and eight months later, in October 1971, Gacy's parole ended.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=96}} The following month, records of Gacy's previous criminal convictions in Iowa were subsequently [[Record sealing|sealed]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=53}}{{efn|Gacy successfully hid his [[criminal record]] from friends, business associates and political acquaintances; they only learned the truth of his past after police had begun investigating him for his later murders.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=72}}{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=73}}}}\n\n===8213 West Summerdale Avenue===\nWith financial assistance from his mother, Gacy bought a house in Norwood Park Township, an [[unincorporated area]] of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], a part of metropolitan Chicago. The address, 8213 West Summerdale Avenue, is where he resided until his arrest in December 1978 and where all his known murders were committed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=175}} He became active in his local community, and his neighbors considered him helpful; willing to loan his construction tools and plowing snow from neighborhood walks free of charge.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=86\u201387}} Between 1974 and 1978, he hosted annual summer parties attended by hundreds of people, including politicians.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=150}} \n\nIn August 1971, shortly after Gacy and his mother moved into the house, he became engaged to Carole Hoff, a [[divorcee]] with two young daughters. Hoff, whom he had briefly dated in high school, had been a friend of his younger sister. His fianc\u00e9e and stepdaughters moved into his home soon after the couple announced their engagement.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=55\u201359}} Gacy's mother subsequently moved out of the house shortly before his wedding, which was held on July 1, 1972.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=278}}\n\nOne week before Gacy's wedding, on June 22, he was arrested and charged with aggravated [[Sexual battery|battery]] and reckless conduct. The arrest was in response to a complaint filed by a youth, Jackie Dee, who informed police that Gacy, [[impersonating a police officer]], had flashed a sheriff's badge, lured him into his car, and forced him to perform oral sex.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=112}} These charges were later dropped after the complainant attempted to blackmail Gacy into paying money in exchange for dropping the charges.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=61\u201362}}\n\n===PDM Contractors===\nIn 1971, Gacy established a part-time construction business, PDM Contractors (PDM being the initials for 'Painting, Decorating, and Maintenance').{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=65}} With the approval of his probation officer, he was allowed to work evenings to commit to his employment contracts while working as a cook during the day. The business initially undertook minor repair work, such as sign-writing, pouring concrete, and redecorating, but later expanded to include projects such as interior design, [[remodeling]], installation, assembly, and [[landscaping]]. In mid-1973, Gacy quit his job as a cook in order that he could fully commit to his construction business.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=115}}\n\nMuch of the labor workforce consisted of high school students and young men.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=1}} In 1973, Gacy and a teenage employee of PDM Contractors traveled to [[Florida]] to view property Gacy had purchased. On the first night in Florida, Gacy raped the youth in their hotel room.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=118}} As a result, the youth refused to stay in the same hotel room as Gacy and instead slept on the beach. Upon returning to Chicago, he drove to Gacy's house and beat him in his yard. Gacy's mother-in-law stopped the assault and he drove away. Gacy explained to his wife that the attack happened because he had refused to pay the youth for poor quality painting work.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\nAnother employee of Gacy's was 15-year-old Anthony Antonucci, whom he had hired in May 1975. In July 1975, Gacy arrived at Antonucci's home while the youth was alone, having injured his foot at work the day prior. Gacy plied him with alcohol, wrestled him to the floor and cuffed his hands behind his back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} The cuff upon Antonucci's right wrist was loose: Antonucci freed his arm from the [[handcuffs|handcuff]] after Gacy left the room. When Gacy returned, Antonucci\u2014a member of his high school wrestling team\u2014pounced upon him. He wrestled Gacy to the floor, obtained possession of the handcuff key and cuffed Gacy's hands behind his back. Gacy screamed threats, then calmed down and promised to leave if Antonucci removed the handcuffs. The youth agreed and Gacy left the house.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} Antonucci later recalled that Gacy had told him as he lay prone on the floor: \"Not only are you the only one who got out of the cuffs; you got them on me.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=123}}\n\nOn July 26, 1976, Gacy employed 18-year-old David Cram. On August 21,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=168}} Cram moved into his house. The following day, Gacy conned Cram into donning handcuffs while the youth was [[inebriated]]. Gacy swung Cram around while holding the chain linking the cuffs, then informed him that he intended to rape him. Cram, who had spent a year in the [[US Army|Army]], kicked Gacy in the face, then freed himself from the handcuffs as Gacy lay prone. One month later, Gacy appeared at Cram's bedroom door with the intention to rape him and said: \"Dave, you really don't know who I am. Maybe it would be good if you give me what I want.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=172}} Cram resisted Gacy's attempts to assault him and Gacy left his bedroom. After this incident, Cram moved out of Gacy's home and subsequently left PDM Contractors, although he did periodically work for Gacy over the following two years.<ref name=\"The Montreal Gazette Feb. 13, 1980\">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&dat=19800213&id=slsxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=laQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1116,946568|title=The Montreal Gazette \u2013 Google News Archive Search|publisher=}}</ref> Shortly after Cram had vacated Gacy's residence, another employee of PDM Contractors, 18-year-old Michael Rossi, moved into Gacy's house.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=177}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=184}}{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=67}}{{efn|Rossi had worked for PDM Contractors since May 1976.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=58\u201360}} He lived with Gacy until April 1977.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=179}}}}\n\nBy 1975, PDM Contractors was expanding rapidly; by his own later admission, he began working 12- and 16-hour days to fulfill agreed commitments upon an increasing number of contracts.

As a result of this contract, Gacy regularly traveled to other states to supervise construction projects and he later stated that, through both businesses (PDM Contractors and PE Systems), he often simultaneously worked on up to four construction projects,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=180}} with almost 80 buildings being successfully remodeled in 1977 alone.

Sequential burial patterns of victims within the crawl space, plus the [[circumstantial evidence|circumstantial]] fact that Cram had not lived with Gacy until August 21, leave a possible date of between August 6 and 20, 1976 as the time this particular man was murdered.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=311}} The second unidentified male likely to have been murdered between August and October 1976 is a youth with dark brown, wavy hair, aged between 18 and 22 years old, who is known to have suffered from an [[tooth abscess|abscessed tooth]] at the time of his murder. This male was buried in the northeast corner of the crawl space. Subsequent recollections by an employee of PDM Contractors of a trench Gacy had directed him to dig before the termination of his employment on October 5, 1976 being the location where this particular victim was buried suggests a date between August and October 1976 as being when this particular victim was murdered.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=311}}\n\nOn October 24, 1976, Gacy abducted and killed teenage friends Kenneth Parker and Michael Marino:<ref>{{cite news|title=Two Apparent Gacy Victims Identified |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UO9eAAAAIBAJ&sjid=K1QNAAAAIBAJ&pg=5070,3504589&dq/ |publisher=St. Joseph Gazette |accessdate=March 14, 2013}}</ref> the two were last seen outside a restaurant on [[Clark Street (Chicago)|Clark Street]].

Don't you have any respect for the dead?\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=240}}\n\nAt 3:20&nbsp;a.m., Gacy, covered in mud, arrived at the police station, claiming he had been involved in a car accident.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=23}} Upon returning to the police station later that day, Gacy denied any involvement in the disappearance of Piest and repeated that he had not offered him a job. When asked why he had returned to the pharmacy at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Gacy claimed he had done so in response to a phone call from Torf informing him he had left his appointment book at the store. Detectives had already spoken with Torf, who had stated he had placed no such call to Gacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=27}} At the request of detectives, Gacy prepared a written statement detailing his movements on December 11.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=28}}\n\n===Revelations===\nDes Plaines police were convinced Gacy was behind Piest's disappearance and checked Gacy's record, discovering that he had an outstanding battery charge against him in Chicago and had served a prison sentence in Iowa for the sodomy of a 15-year-old boy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=17}} A search of Gacy's house on December 13 was ordered by a judge at the request of detectives and revealed several suspicious items. These included a [[syringe]], several police badges, and a 6mm Brevettata [[starter pistol]].

In an interview with Gacy's former wife the same day, they learned of the disappearance of John Butkovich.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=84}} The same day, the Maine West High School ring was traced to a John Alan Szyc.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=53\u201355}} In an interview with Szyc's mother the same day, she informed officers of the January 1977 disappearance of her son and that several items from his apartment were also missing, including a Motorola TV set.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 117</ref>\n\nBy December 16, Gacy was becoming affable with the surveillance detectives, regularly inviting them to join him for meals in restaurants and occasionally for drinks in bars or within his home. He repeatedly denied that he had anything to do with Piest's disappearance and accused the officers of harassing him because of his political connections or because of his recreational drug use. Knowing these officers were unlikely to arrest him on anything trivial, he openly taunted them by flouting traffic laws and succeeded in losing his pursuers on more than one occasion.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=89}}\n\nOn December 17, investigators conducted a formal interview of Michael Rossi, who informed them Gacy had sold Szyc's vehicle to him with the explanation that he had bought the car from Szyc because the youth needed money to move to California. A further examination of Gacy's Oldsmobile was conducted on this date. In the course of examining the trunk of the car, the investigators discovered a small cluster of fibers which may have been human hair. These fibers were sent for further analysis. That evening, officers conducted a test using three trained [[German shepherd]] [[Search and rescue dog|search dogs]] to determine whether Piest had been present in any of Gacy's vehicles.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}} The dogs were allowed to examine each of Gacy's vehicles, whereupon one dog approached Gacy's Oldsmobile and lay upon the passenger seat in what the dog's handler informed investigators was a \"death reaction\", indicating the body of Robert Piest had been present in this vehicle.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}}\n\nThat evening, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives to a restaurant for a meal. In the early hours of December 18, he invited the same officers into another restaurant where, over breakfast, he talked of his business, his marriages and his activities as a registered clown. At one point during this conversation, Gacy remarked to one of the two surveillance detectives: \"You know\u2026 clowns can get away with murder.\"{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=226}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=90}}\n\n===Civil suit===\nBy December 18, Gacy was beginning to show visible signs of strain as a result of the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired, appeared anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers' office to prepare a $750,000 [[civil suit]] against the Des Plaines police,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}} demanding that they cease their surveillance. The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to 17-year-old Kim Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy, who admitted when contacted in person the following day that she had worn the jacket and had placed the receipt in the [[Anorak|parka]] pocket just before she gave the parka to Piest as he left the store to talk with a contractor.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=110}} This revelation contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\nThe same evening, Michael Rossi was interviewed a second time: on this occasion, Rossi was more cooperative, informing detectives that in the summer of 1977, Gacy had had him spread ten bags of [[Lime (material)|lime]] in the crawl space of the house.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}}\n\nOn December 19, investigators began compiling evidence for a second search warrant of Gacy's house. The same day, Gacy's lawyers filed the civil suit against the Des Plaines police. The hearing of the suit was scheduled for December 22. That afternoon, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives inside his house. On this occasion, as one officer distracted Gacy with conversation, another officer walked into Gacy's bedroom in an unsuccessful attempt to write down the serial number of the Motorola TV set they suspected belonged to John Szyc. While flushing Gacy's toilet, this officer noticed a smell he suspected could be that of rotting corpses emanating from a [[heating duct]]; the officers who previously searched Gacy's house had failed to notice this, as on that occasion the house had been cold.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nBoth David Cram and Michael Rossi were interviewed by investigators on December 20. Rossi had agreed to be interviewed in relation to his possible links with John Szyc as well as the disappearance of Robert Piest. When questioned by Kozenczak as to where he believed Gacy had placed Piest's body, Rossi replied: \"In the crawl space; he could have put him in the crawl space.\"<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 147</ref> A polygraph test showed his responses to questions to be inconclusive; however, upon his agreeing to a subsequent visual test in which a map of Cook County was divided into 12 [[Grid plan|grid sections]] numbered 1 to 12, with Gacy's home marked in the fourth grid section, Kozenczak noted an extreme response in Rossi's [[blood pressure]] when asked: \"Is the body of Robert Piest buried in grid number 4?\"<ref>Kozenczak, Joseph R.; Kozenczak, Karen M.

Cram then stated Gacy had grabbed a flashlight and immediately entered the crawl space to look for evidence of digging. When asked whether he had been to the crawl space, Cram replied he had been asked by Gacy to spread lime down there and also dug trenches upon Gacy's behest with the explanation they were for plumbing.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}} Cram stated these trenches were {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} wide, {{convert|6|ft|m|sp=us}} long and {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} deep\u2014the size of graves.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=143\u2013145}}\n\n===Verbal confession===\nOn the evening of December 20, Gacy drove to his lawyers' office in [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]] to attend a pre-scheduled meeting he had arranged with them, ostensibly to discuss the progress of his civil suit. Upon his arrival, Gacy appeared disheveled and immediately asked for an alcoholic drink, whereupon Sam Amirante fetched a bottle of whiskey from his car. Upon his return, Amirante asked Gacy what he had to discuss with them. Gacy picked up a copy of the ''[[Chicago Daily Herald|Daily Herald]]'' from Amirante's desk; he pointed to a front-page article covering the disappearance of Robert Piest and informed his lawyers: \"This boy is dead. He's in a river.\"{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=136}}\n\nOver the following hours, Gacy gave a rambling confession that ran into the early hours of the following morning. He began by informing Amirante and Stevens he had \"been the judge ... jury and executioner of many, many people\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 127</ref> most of whom he stated were buried in his crawl space, and others in the Des Plaines River. Some victims he referred to by name; most he dismissed as \"[[Male prostitution|male prostitutes]]\", \"hustlers\" and \"liars\" to whom he gave \"the rope trick\".

Jacobson immediately handed the bag to the surveillance officers, adding that Gacy had told him: \"The end is coming (for me). These guys are going to kill me.\" Gacy then drove to the home of a fellow contractor, Ronald Rhode. Inside Rhode's living room, Gacy hugged Rhode before bursting into tears and saying: \"I killed thirty people, give or take a few.\" Gacy then left Rhode's home to meet with Michael Rossi and David Cram. As he drove along the expressway, the surveillance officers noted he was holding a [[Catholic rosary|rosary]] to his chin as he prayed while driving.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=152}}\n\nAfter talking with Cram and Rossi at Cram's home, Gacy had Cram drive him to a scheduled meeting with Leroy Stevens. As he spoke with his lawyer, Cram informed the officers that Gacy had earlier divulged to both himself and Rossi that the previous evening, he had confessed to his lawyers his guilt in over thirty murders. Upon concluding his meeting with his lawyer, Gacy had Cram drive him to Maryhill Cemetery, where his father was buried.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=259}}\n\nAs Gacy drove to various locations that morning, police outlined their formal draft of their second search warrant. The purpose of the warrant was specifically to search for the body of Robert Piest in the crawl space. Upon hearing radioed reports from the surveillance detectives that, in light of his erratic behavior, Gacy might be about to commit suicide, police decided to arrest him upon a charge of possession and distribution of marijuana{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=157}} in order to hold him in custody as the formal request for a second search warrant was presented. At 4:30 on the afternoon of December 21, the eve of the hearing of Gacy's civil suit, the request for a second search warrant was granted by Judge Marvin J. Peters.<ref>Kozenczak, (2012) p. 158</ref>\n\nArmed with the signed search warrant, police and evidence technicians quickly drove to Gacy's home. Upon their arrival, officers found that Gacy had unplugged his [[sump pump]] and that the crawl space was flooded with water; to clear the water they simply replaced the plug and waited for the water to drain. After it had done so, evidence technician Daniel Genty entered the {{convert|28|x|38|ft|adj=on}} crawl space,<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 50.</ref> crawled to the southwest area, and began digging.

Amirante argued against the testimony delivered by the doctors who had testified for the prosecution, repeatedly citing the testimony of the four psychiatrists and psychologists who had testified on behalf of the defense.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=360}} Amirante also accused Sullivan of scarcely referring to the evidence presented throughout the trial in his own closing argument, and of arousing hatred against his client. The defense lawyer attempted to portray Gacy as a \"man driven by compulsions he was unable to control\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=363}}\n\nIn support of these arguments, the defense counsel repeatedly referred to the testimony of the doctors who had appeared for the defense, in addition to the testimony of defense witnesses such as Jeffrey Rignall and Gacy's former business associate Mickel Reed\u2014both of whom had testified to their belief that Gacy had been unable to control his actions.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=359}} Amirante then urged the jury to put aside any prejudice they held against his client, and requested they deliver a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, adding that the psychology of Gacy's behavior would be of benefit to scientific research and that the psychology of his mind should be studied.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=361}}\n\n[[File:Kunkletrial.jpg|200px|thumb|William Kunkle, prosecutor at Gacy's trial, standing before a board depicting the 22 victims identified by February 1980.]]\nOn the morning of March 12,{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=364}} William Kunkle continued to argue for the prosecution. Kunkle referred to the defense's contention of insanity as \"a [[falsity|sham]]\", arguing that the facts of the case demonstrated Gacy's ability to think logically and control his actions. Kunkle also referred to the testimony of a doctor who had examined Gacy in 1968. This doctor had diagnosed Gacy as an [[antisocial personality]], capable of committing crimes without remorse. Kunkle indicated that had the recommendations of this doctor been heeded, Gacy would have not been freed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}}\n\nAt the close of his argument, Kunkle pulled each of the 22 photos of Gacy's identified victims off a board displaying the images and asked the jury not to show sympathy but to \"show justice\". Kunkle then asked the jury to \"show the same sympathy this man showed when he took these lives and put them ''there!''{{-\"}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}} before throwing the stack of photos into the opening of the trap door of Gacy's crawl space, which had been introduced as evidence and was on display in the courtroom.

The following year, Gacy filed a further post-conviction petition, seeking a new trial. His then-defense lawyer, [[Richard Kling]], argued that Gacy had been provided with ineffective legal counsel at his 1980 trial.

Other states across America subsequently adopted similar procedures and sensibilities, as a result of which a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed.

Gacy regularly performed at children's hospitals and charitable events as \"Pogo the Clown\" or \"Patches the Clown\", clowning persona he devised. He was also active in his local community as a precinct captain and building contractor.\n\nIt is believed all of Gacy's known murders were committed inside his [[Ranch-style house|ranch house]] in [[Norwood Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Norwood Park]], a part of [[Chicago metropolitan area|metropolitan Chicago]]. Once lured to his home, Gacy typically duped his victims into donning [[handcuffs]] on the pretext of being shown a [[Magic (illusion)|magic trick]]. He then raped and tortured his captive before killing his victim by either [[asphyxiation]] or [[strangulation]] with a makeshift [[garrote]]. 26 of Gacy's victims were buried in the [[crawl space]] of his home. Three others were buried elsewhere on his property, while his last four victims were discarded in the [[Des Plaines River]].\n\nGacy was convicted of the [[sodomy]] of a teenage boy in Iowa in 1968. He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, but was released after serving 18 months of his sentence. His first murder occurred in 1972 and at least 30 subsequent murders were committed after the divorce of his second wife in 1976. Investigation into the case of missing [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]] teenager Robert Piest led to Gacy's arrest on December 21, 1978.\n\nThe conviction for 33 murders was then the largest number of murders charged to one individual in United States history. Gacy was sentenced to death on March 13, 1980. He remained on death row at [[Menard Correctional Center]] for 14 years, spending much of his time painting, and was executed by [[lethal injection]] at [[Stateville Correctional Center]] on May 10, 1994. \n\n==Early life==\nJohn Wayne Gacy was born in Chicago, [[Illinois]] on March 17, 1942, the second child and only son of John Stanley Gacy (June 20, 1900 \u2013 December 25, 1969) and Marion Elaine Robinson (May 4, 1908 \u2013 December 6, 1989).<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 63.</ref> His father was an auto repair machinist and [[World War I]] veteran,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=24}} and his mother was a homemaker.<ref>Cook County marriage records provide his mother's name as Marion E.

He was close to his two sisters and mother but endured a difficult relationship with his father, an [[alcoholic]] who was [[physical abuse|physically abusive]] to his wife and children.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=256\u2013257}} Gacy seldom received his father's approval, later recollecting that, no matter what he achieved, he was \"never good enough\" in his father's eyes.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=31}}  His father regularly belittled him, calling him \"dumb and stupid\" and comparing him unfavorably with his sisters.<ref>''Serial Killers.'' pp. 54\u201355.</ref> Despite this, Gacy always denied ever hating his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=21}} \n\nOne of Gacy's earliest childhood memories was of being beaten with a leather belt at the age of four for accidentally disarranging car engine components his father had assembled.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=18\u201319}} On another occasion, he was struck across the head with a broomstick and rendered [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]].<ref>{{cite book | first1=Jason| last1=Moss| first2=Jeffrey| last2=Kottler| title=The Last Victim: A True-life Journey into the Mind of the Serial Killer| publisher=Grand Central Publishing| location=New York City| date=2000|isbn=0-7535-0398-0| p=103}}</ref> When he was six years old, Gacy stole a toy truck from a neighborhood store. His mother made him walk back to the store, return the toy and apologize to the owners. His mother informed his father, who beat Gacy with a belt as punishment. After this incident, Gacy's mother attempted to shield her son from his father's verbal and physical abuse,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=26}} yet this only succeeded in Gacy earning accusations that he was a \"[[sissy]]\" and a \"Mama's boy\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} who would \"probably grow up [[queer]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=40}}\n\nIn 1949, Gacy's father was informed that his son and another boy had been caught sexually fondling a young girl.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=218}} Gacy's father whipped him with a [[razor strop]] as punishment. The same year,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=17}} Gacy was [[child molestation|molested]] by a family friend,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} a contractor who would take Gacy for rides in his truck and then fondle him. Gacy never told his father about these incidents, afraid that his father would blame him.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\">''Serial Killers''. p. 54.</ref>\n\nBecause of a heart condition, Gacy was ordered to avoid all sports at school.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\" /> During the fourth grade, Gacy began to experience [[Syncope (medicine)|blackout]]s. He was occasionally hospitalized because of these seizures, and also in 1957 for a [[appendicitis|burst appendix]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=18}} Gacy later estimated that between the ages of 14 and 18, he had spent almost a year in the hospital for these episodes, and attributed the decline of his grades to his missing school. His father suspected the episodes were an effort to gain sympathy and attention, and openly accused his son of faking the condition as the boy lay in a hospital bed.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |issn=1364-5803 |page=5}}</ref> Although his mother, sisters, and few close friends never doubted his illness, Gacy's medical condition was never conclusively diagnosed.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=32}}\n\nOne of Gacy's friends at high school recalled several instances in which his father ridiculed or beat his son without provocation. On one occasion in 1957, the same friend witnessed an incident at the Gacy household in which Gacy's father began shouting at his son for no reason, then began hitting him.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=33}} Gacy's mother attempted to intervene. The friend recalled that Gacy simply \"put up his hands to defend himself\", adding that he never struck his father back during these physical altercations.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n===Career origins===\nIn 1960, at the age of 18, Gacy became involved in politics, working as an assistant [[precinct captain]] for a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] candidate in his neighborhood. This decision earned more criticism from his father, who accused his son of being a \"[[wikt:Special:Search/dupe|patsy]]\". Gacy later speculated the decision may have been an attempt to seek the acceptance from others that he never received from his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=36}}\n\nThe same year Gacy became a Democratic candidate, his father bought him a car, with the title of the vehicle being in his father's name until Gacy had completed the monthly repayments.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=42}} These repayments took several years to complete, and his father would confiscate the keys to the vehicle if Gacy did not do as his father said. On one occasion in 1962, Gacy bought an extra set of keys after his father confiscated the original set. In response, his father removed the [[distributor cap]] from the vehicle, withholding the component for three days. Gacy recalled that as a result of this incident, he felt \"totally sick; drained\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=44}} When his father replaced the distributor cap, Gacy left the family home and drove to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he found work within the ambulance service before he was transferred to work as an attendant at Palm Mortuary.\n\nIn his role as a mortuary attendant, Gacy slept on a cot behind the [[embalming]] room.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Cahill|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OF6itYw0HT0C&pg=PT30&lpg=PT30#v=onepage&q/ |title=Buried Dreams: Inside the Mind of a Serial Killer|publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=New York City|date=1986|access-date=March 14, 2013|isbn=978-0553051155}}</ref> He worked in this role for three months.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} In this role, he observed morticians embalming dead bodies and later confessed that, on one evening while alone, he had clambered into the coffin of a deceased teenage male, embracing and caressing the body before experiencing a sense of shock.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}}{{efn|Gacy later claimed to have engaged in acts of [[necrophilia]] on approximately two occasions while he worked at Palm Mortuary. He justified his actions by claiming the bodies he had defiled were \"just dead things\" who \"couldn't tell anybody\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=346}}}} This prompted Gacy to call his mother the next day and ask whether his father would allow him to return home.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}} His father agreed and the same day, Gacy drove back to live with his family in Chicago.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=347}}\n\nUpon his return, despite the fact he had failed to graduate from high school, Gacy successfully enrolled in the [[Northwestern College (Illinois)|Northwestern Business College]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=47}} from which he graduated in 1963. Gacy subsequently took a management trainee position within the Nunn-Bush Shoe Company.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=18\u201319}} In 1964, the shoe company transferred Gacy to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] to work as a salesman.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} He was eventually promoted to manager of his department. In March of that year, he became engaged to Marlynn Myers, a co-worker in the department he managed.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}\n\nDuring his courtship with Marlynn, Gacy joined the local [[Jaycees]] and became a tireless worker for the organization, being named Key Man for the organization in April 1964.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 58.</ref> The same year, Gacy had his second homosexual experience. According to Gacy, he acquiesced to this incident after one of his colleagues in the Springfield Jaycees plied him with drinks and invited him to spend the evening upon his sofa; the colleague then performed [[oral sex]] upon him while he was drunk.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish Printworks|location=London, England|issn=1364-5803 |page=7}}</ref> By 1965, Gacy had risen to the position of vice-president of the Springfield Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=20\u201322}} The same year, he was named as the third most outstanding Jaycee within the state of Illinois.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=48}}\n\n==Waterloo, Iowa==\nAfter a nine-month courtship, Gacy and Myers married in September 1964. Marlynn's father subsequently purchased three [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] restaurants in [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], [[Iowa]], and the couple moved to Waterloo so he could manage the restaurants, with the understanding that they would move into Marlynn's parents' home (which was vacated for the couple).{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=261\u2013262}} The offer was lucrative: Gacy would receive $15,000 per year (the equivalent of $115,513 {{as of|2020|lc=y|df=US}}), plus a share of profits earned via the restaurants.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=50}} Following his obligatory completion of a managerial course, Gacy relocated to Waterloo with his wife later that year.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=23\u201325}}\n\n=== Waterloo Jaycees ===\nIn Waterloo, Gacy joined the local chapter of the Jaycees, regularly offering extended hours to the organization in addition to the 12- and 14-hour days he worked managing three restaurants. Although considered ambitious and something of a braggart by his colleagues in the Jaycees, he was highly regarded as a worker on several fund-raising projects. In 1967, he was named \"outstanding vice-president\" of the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=28}} At Jaycee meetings, Gacy often provided free fried chicken to his colleagues and insisted upon being given the nickname \"[[Colonel Sanders|Colonel]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=51}} The same year, Gacy served on the Board of Directors for the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=51}}\n\nGacy's wife gave birth to two children: a son was born in February 1966, followed by a daughter in March 1967. Gacy himself later described this period of his life as \"perfect\", adding that he finally earned the long-sought approval of his father. On one occasion in July 1966, Gacy's parents paid a visit to Iowa, during which his father apologized privately to him for the physical and emotional abuse he had inflicted on him throughout his childhood, before proudly informing him: \"Son, I was wrong about you.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=53}}\n\nHowever, there was an unseemlier side of Jaycee life in Waterloo that involved [[wife swapping]],<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> [[prostitution]], [[pornography]], and drug use. Gacy was deeply involved in many of these activities and regularly cheated on his wife with local prostitutes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=263}} Much of this  happened at the Clayton House Motel. He is also known to have opened a \"club\" in his basement, where he allowed his employees to drink alcohol and play pool. Although Gacy employed teenagers of both sexes at his restaurants, he socialized only with his young male employees. Many were given alcohol before Gacy made sexual advances toward them, which, if rebuffed, he would claim were jokes or a test of morals.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}}\n\n====Assault of Donald Voorhees====\nIn August 1967, Gacy committed his first known [[sexual assault]] upon a teenage boy. The victim was 15-year-old Donald Voorhees, the son of a fellow Jaycee. Gacy lured Voorhees to his house with the promise of showing him pornographic films.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=55}} Gacy plied Voorhees with alcohol and persuaded the youth to perform oral sex upon him. Over the following months, several other youths were sexually abused in a similar manner, including one whom Gacy encouraged to have sex with his own wife before [[blackmail]]ing the youth into performing oral sex upon him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}} Gacy tricked several teenagers into believing he was commissioned with conducting homosexual experiments in the interests of \"scientific research\", for which each was paid up to $50.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=266}}\n\nIn March 1968, Voorhees reported to his father that Gacy had sexually assaulted him. Voorhees Sr. immediately informed the police and Gacy was arrested and subsequently charged with oral [[Sodomy law|sodomy]] in relation to Voorhees and the attempted assault of 16-year-old Edward Lynch.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=267}} Gacy vehemently denied the charges and demanded to take a [[polygraph test]]. This request was granted, although the results indicated Gacy was nervous when he denied any wrongdoing in relation to either Voorhees or Lynch.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n\nGacy publicly denied any wrongdoing and insisted the charges against him were politically motivated \u2013 Voorhees Sr. had opposed Gacy's nomination for appointment as president of the Iowa Jaycees.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=66}} Several fellow Jaycees found Gacy's story credible and rallied to his support. However, on May 10, 1968, Gacy was indicted on the sodomy charge.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = ''\"The most striking aspect of the test results is the patient's total denial of responsibility for everything that has happened to him.

Schroeder agreed to lure Voorhees to a secluded spot, spray [[Mace (spray)|Mace]] in his face and beat him. Gacy promised to pay Schroeder $300 if he followed through on the plot. In early September, Schroeder lured Voorhees to an isolated county park, sprayed Mace supplied by Gacy into the youth's eyes, then beat him, all the while shouting that he was not to testify against Gacy at his upcoming trial.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=72}}<ref name=\"Michael H.

Schroeder was arrested the following day. Despite initially denying any involvement, he soon confessed to having assaulted Voorhees, indicating that he had done so at Gacy's request. Gacy was arrested and additionally charged in relation to hiring Schroeder to assault and [[Witness tampering|intimidate]] Voorhees.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=268\u2013270}}\n\nOn September 12, Gacy was ordered to undergo a [[Psychological evaluation|psychiatric evaluation]] at the Psychiatric Hospital of the State University of Iowa.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=270}} Two doctors had examined Gacy over a period of 17 days before concluding he had an [[antisocial personality disorder]] (a disorder which incorporates constructs such as [[sociopathy]] and [[psychopathy]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/antisocial-personality-disorder |title=Antisocial Personality Disorder |magazine=[[Psychology Today]]|publisher=Sussex Publishers|location=New York City |date=April 19, 2017 |accessdate=January 13, 2018 }}</ref> was unlikely to benefit from any therapy or medical treatment, and that his behavior pattern was likely to bring him into repeated conflict with society.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} The doctors also concluded he was mentally competent to stand trial.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}}\n\n=====Conviction and imprisonment=====\n[[File:John Wayne Gacy (mugshot).jpg|thumb|[[Mug shot]]s of Gacy, following his December 1968 sodomy conviction.]]\nUpon advice from his attorney, Gacy entered a plea of guilty to one count of sodomy in relation to the charges filed against him by Donald Voorhees. He pleaded not guilty to the other charges lodged against him by other youths at a formal [[arraignment]] held on November 7, 1968. Before the judge, Gacy contended that he and Voorhees had indeed engaged in sexual relations, yet he insisted Voorhees had offered his sexual services to him and that he had acted out of curiosity.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} His story was not believed. Despite his lawyers' recommendations for [[probation]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=84}} Gacy was convicted of sodomy on December 3, 1968,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} and sentenced to 10 years at the [[Anamosa State Penitentiary]].{{sfn|Peck|Dolch|2001|p=260}} On the day Gacy was convicted and sentenced, his wife petitioned for [[divorce]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=85}} requesting possession of the couple's home, property, sole custody of their two children and subsequent [[alimony]] payments.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=40}} The Court ruled in her favor and the divorce was finalized on September 18, 1969. Gacy never saw his first wife or children again.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=274}}\n\nDuring his incarceration in the Anamosa State Penitentiary, Gacy rapidly acquired a reputation as a model prisoner.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=273}} Within months of his arrival, he had risen to the position of head cook. He also joined the inmate Jaycee chapter and increased their membership figure from 50 to 650 in the span of less than 18 months. He is also known to have both secured an increase in the inmates' daily pay in the prison mess hall{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=88}} and to have supervised several projects to improve conditions for inmates at the prison.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=89}} On one occasion, Gacy oversaw the installation of a [[miniature golf]] course in the prison's recreation yard.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 62.</ref>\n\nIn June 1969, Gacy first applied to the State of Iowa Board of Parole for early release: this application was denied. In preparation for a second scheduled parole hearing in May 1970, Gacy completed 16 high school courses, for which he obtained his diploma in November 1969.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}}\n\nOn [[Christmas Day]] 1969, Gacy's father died from [[cirrhosis]] of the [[liver]].{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}} Gacy was not informed that his father had died until two days after his death.

However, within 24 hours of his release, Gacy relocated to Chicago to live with his mother.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}} He arrived in Chicago on June 19 and shortly thereafter obtained a job as a [[short-order cook]] in a restaurant.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=49}}\n\nOn February 12, 1971, Gacy was charged with sexually assaulting a teenage boy.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=95}} The youth claimed that Gacy had lured him into his car at Chicago's [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus]] terminal and driven him to his home, where he had attempted to force the youth into sex. This complaint was subsequently dismissed when the youth failed to appear in court. The Iowa Board of Parole did not learn of this incident (which violated the conditions of his parole) and eight months later, in October 1971, Gacy's parole ended.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=96}} The following month, records of Gacy's previous criminal convictions in Iowa were subsequently [[Record sealing|sealed]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=53}}{{efn|Gacy successfully hid his [[criminal record]] from friends, business associates and political acquaintances; they only learned the truth of his past after police had begun investigating him for his later murders.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=72}}{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=73}}}}\n\n===8213 West Summerdale Avenue===\nWith financial assistance from his mother, Gacy bought a house in Norwood Park Township, an [[unincorporated area]] of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], a part of metropolitan Chicago. The address, 8213 West Summerdale Avenue, is where he resided until his arrest in December 1978 and where all his known murders were committed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=175}} He became active in his local community, and his neighbors considered him helpful; willing to loan his construction tools and plowing snow from neighborhood walks free of charge.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=86\u201387}} Between 1974 and 1978, he hosted annual summer parties attended by hundreds of people, including politicians.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=150}} \n\nIn August 1971, shortly after Gacy and his mother moved into the house, he became engaged to Carole Hoff, a [[divorcee]] with two young daughters. Hoff, whom he had briefly dated in high school, had been a friend of his younger sister. His fianc\u00e9e and stepdaughters moved into his home soon after the couple announced their engagement.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=55\u201359}} Gacy's mother subsequently moved out of the house shortly before his wedding, which was held on July 1, 1972.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=278}}\n\nOne week before Gacy's wedding, on June 22, he was arrested and charged with aggravated [[Sexual battery|battery]] and reckless conduct. The arrest was in response to a complaint filed by a youth, Jackie Dee, who informed police that Gacy, [[impersonating a police officer]], had flashed a sheriff's badge, lured him into his car, and forced him to perform oral sex.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=112}} These charges were later dropped after the complainant attempted to blackmail Gacy into paying money in exchange for dropping the charges.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=61\u201362}}\n\n===PDM Contractors===\nIn 1971, Gacy established a part-time construction business, PDM Contractors (PDM being the initials for 'Painting, Decorating, and Maintenance').{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=65}} With the approval of his probation officer, he was allowed to work evenings to commit to his employment contracts while working as a cook during the day. The business initially undertook minor repair work, such as sign-writing, pouring concrete, and redecorating, but later expanded to include projects such as interior design, [[remodeling]], installation, assembly, and [[landscaping]]. In mid-1973, Gacy quit his job as a cook in order that he could fully commit to his construction business.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=115}}\n\nMuch of the labor workforce consisted of high school students and young men.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=1}} In 1973, Gacy and a teenage employee of PDM Contractors traveled to [[Florida]] to view property Gacy had purchased. On the first night in Florida, Gacy raped the youth in their hotel room.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=118}} As a result, the youth refused to stay in the same hotel room as Gacy and instead slept on the beach. Upon returning to Chicago, he drove to Gacy's house and beat him in his yard. Gacy's mother-in-law stopped the assault and he drove away. Gacy explained to his wife that the attack happened because he had refused to pay the youth for poor quality painting work.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\nAnother employee of Gacy's was 15-year-old Anthony Antonucci, whom he had hired in May 1975. In July 1975, Gacy arrived at Antonucci's home while the youth was alone, having injured his foot at work the day prior. Gacy plied him with alcohol, wrestled him to the floor and cuffed his hands behind his back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} The cuff upon Antonucci's right wrist was loose: Antonucci freed his arm from the [[handcuffs|handcuff]] after Gacy left the room. When Gacy returned, Antonucci\u2014a member of his high school wrestling team\u2014pounced upon him. He wrestled Gacy to the floor, obtained possession of the handcuff key and cuffed Gacy's hands behind his back. Gacy screamed threats, then calmed down and promised to leave if Antonucci removed the handcuffs. The youth agreed and Gacy left the house.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} Antonucci later recalled that Gacy had told him as he lay prone on the floor: \"Not only are you the only one who got out of the cuffs; you got them on me.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=123}}\n\nOn July 26, 1976, Gacy employed 18-year-old David Cram. On August 21,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=168}} Cram moved into his house. The following day, Gacy conned Cram into donning handcuffs while the youth was [[inebriated]]. Gacy swung Cram around while holding the chain linking the cuffs, then informed him that he intended to rape him. Cram, who had spent a year in the [[US Army|Army]], kicked Gacy in the face, then freed himself from the handcuffs as Gacy lay prone. One month later, Gacy appeared at Cram's bedroom door with the intention to rape him and said: \"Dave, you really don't know who I am. Maybe it would be good if you give me what I want.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=172}} Cram resisted Gacy's attempts to assault him and Gacy left his bedroom.

This behavior included hearing his car arrive and depart in the early hours of the morning; noting lights switching on and off in his home at odd hours and his keeping company with young males.<ref name=\"autogenerated28\" /> One neighbor later recollected that, for several years, she and her son had repeatedly been awoken by the repeated sounds of muffled screaming, shouting, and crying in the early morning hours, which she and her son identified as emanating from a house adjacent to theirs on Summerdale Avenue.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=274}}\n\n====1976====\n[[File:CousinKevinscreenshot1980.jpg|115px|right|thumb|Darrell Samson]]\nOne month after his divorce was finalized, Gacy abducted and murdered 18-year-old Darrell Samson.

This male was buried in the northeast corner of the crawl space. Subsequent recollections by an employee of PDM Contractors of a trench Gacy had directed him to dig before the termination of his employment on October 5, 1976 being the location where this particular victim was buried suggests a date between August and October 1976 as being when this particular victim was murdered.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=311}}\n\nOn October 24, 1976, Gacy abducted and killed teenage friends Kenneth Parker and Michael Marino:<ref>{{cite news|title=Two Apparent Gacy Victims Identified |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UO9eAAAAIBAJ&sjid=K1QNAAAAIBAJ&pg=5070,3504589&dq/ |publisher=St. Joseph Gazette |accessdate=March 14, 2013}}</ref> the two were last seen outside a restaurant on [[Clark Street (Chicago)|Clark Street]].

While Gacy was within earshot of 15-year-old, part-time employee Robert Piest, he mentioned that his firm hired teenage boys at a starting wage of $5 per hour\u2014almost double the pay Piest earned at the pharmacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=5\u20136}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=4}}\n\nShortly after Gacy left the pharmacy, Piest informed his mother\u2014who had arrived at the pharmacy to drive her son home\u2014that \"some contractor wants to talk to me about a job\". Piest left the store, promising to return shortly.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=7}}  He was murdered shortly after 10:00&nbsp;p.m. at Gacy's home. Gacy later stated that as he placed the tourniquet around Piest's neck, the youth was \"crying, scared\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 140</ref> He also admitted to having received a phone call from a business acquaintance as Piest lay dying on his bedroom floor.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=231}}\n\n==Investigation==\nWhen Piest failed to return, his family filed a [[missing person]] report on their son with the Des Plaines police.

Kozenczak|Joseph Kozenczak]] chose to investigate Gacy further.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), pp. 26-27</ref>\n\nKozenczak and two other Des Plaines police officers visited Gacy at his home the following evening. Gacy indicated he had seen two youths working at the pharmacy and that he had asked one of them\u2014whom he believed to be Piest\u2014whether any remodeling materials were present in the rear of the store.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=19\u201321}} He was adamant, however, that he had not offered Piest a job and promised to come to the station later that evening to make a statement confirming this, indicating he was unable to do so at that moment as his uncle had just died. When questioned as to how soon he could come to the police station, he responded: \"You guys are very rude. Don't you have any respect for the dead?\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=240}}\n\nAt 3:20&nbsp;a.m., Gacy, covered in mud, arrived at the police station, claiming he had been involved in a car accident.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=23}} Upon returning to the police station later that day, Gacy denied any involvement in the disappearance of Piest and repeated that he had not offered him a job. When asked why he had returned to the pharmacy at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Gacy claimed he had done so in response to a phone call from Torf informing him he had left his appointment book at the store. Detectives had already spoken with Torf, who had stated he had placed no such call to Gacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=27}} At the request of detectives, Gacy prepared a written statement detailing his movements on December 11.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=28}}\n\n===Revelations===\nDes Plaines police were convinced Gacy was behind Piest's disappearance and checked Gacy's record, discovering that he had an outstanding battery charge against him in Chicago and had served a prison sentence in Iowa for the sodomy of a 15-year-old boy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=17}} A search of Gacy's house on December 13 was ordered by a judge at the request of detectives and revealed several suspicious items. These included a [[syringe]], several police badges, and a 6mm Brevettata [[starter pistol]]. They also found handcuffs, books on homosexuality and [[pederasty]], a 39 inch long [[Dimensional lumber#Dimensional lumber|two-by-four]] with two holes drilled into each end,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=33}} several driver's licenses, a blue hooded parka and underwear too small to fit Gacy.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 61</ref>\n\nIn the northwest bedroom, investigators found a [[Maine West High School]] ring. This item initially interested investigators as Piest had attended Maine West, but the ring was not his. It was a class of 1975 ring engraved with the initials J.A.S.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=243}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=87}} A photo receipt from Nisson Pharmacy was also recovered from a trash can.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 61</ref>\n\nGacy's Oldsmobile and other PDM work vehicles were confiscated by the Des Plaines police, who assigned two two-man [[surveillance]] teams to monitor Gacy on a rotational twelve-hour basis as they continued their investigation into his background and potential involvement in Piest's disappearance.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Murder casebook number 84 {{ISBN|0-7485-1454-6}}, p. 1915</ref> These surveillance teams consisted of officers Mike Albrecht and David Hachmeister, and Ronald Robinson and Robert Schultz.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=41}} The following day, investigators received a phone call from Michael Rossi, who informed the investigators both of Gregory Godzik's disappearance and the fact that another PDM employee, Charles Hattula, had been found drowned in an Illinois river the previous year.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=53}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=123}}\n\nOn December 15, Des Plaines investigators obtained further details upon Gacy's battery charge, learning the complainant, Jeffrey Rignall, had reported that Gacy had lured him into his car, chloroformed him, raped him and dumped him, with severe chest and facial burns and rectal bleeding, in Lincoln Park the following morning. In an interview with Gacy's former wife the same day, they learned of the disappearance of John Butkovich.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=84}} The same day, the Maine West High School ring was traced to a John Alan Szyc.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=53\u201355}} In an interview with Szyc's mother the same day, she informed officers of the January 1977 disappearance of her son and that several items from his apartment were also missing, including a Motorola TV set.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 117</ref>\n\nBy December 16, Gacy was becoming affable with the surveillance detectives, regularly inviting them to join him for meals in restaurants and occasionally for drinks in bars or within his home. He repeatedly denied that he had anything to do with Piest's disappearance and accused the officers of harassing him because of his political connections or because of his recreational drug use. Knowing these officers were unlikely to arrest him on anything trivial, he openly taunted them by flouting traffic laws and succeeded in losing his pursuers on more than one occasion.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=89}}\n\nOn December 17, investigators conducted a formal interview of Michael Rossi, who informed them Gacy had sold Szyc's vehicle to him with the explanation that he had bought the car from Szyc because the youth needed money to move to California. A further examination of Gacy's Oldsmobile was conducted on this date. In the course of examining the trunk of the car, the investigators discovered a small cluster of fibers which may have been human hair. These fibers were sent for further analysis. That evening, officers conducted a test using three trained [[German shepherd]] [[Search and rescue dog|search dogs]] to determine whether Piest had been present in any of Gacy's vehicles.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}} The dogs were allowed to examine each of Gacy's vehicles, whereupon one dog approached Gacy's Oldsmobile and lay upon the passenger seat in what the dog's handler informed investigators was a \"death reaction\", indicating the body of Robert Piest had been present in this vehicle.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}}\n\nThat evening, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives to a restaurant for a meal. In the early hours of December 18, he invited the same officers into another restaurant where, over breakfast, he talked of his business, his marriages and his activities as a registered clown. At one point during this conversation, Gacy remarked to one of the two surveillance detectives: \"You know\u2026 clowns can get away with murder.\"{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=226}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=90}}\n\n===Civil suit===\nBy December 18, Gacy was beginning to show visible signs of strain as a result of the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired, appeared anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers' office to prepare a $750,000 [[civil suit]] against the Des Plaines police,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}} demanding that they cease their surveillance. The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to 17-year-old Kim Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy, who admitted when contacted in person the following day that she had worn the jacket and had placed the receipt in the [[Anorak|parka]] pocket just before she gave the parka to Piest as he left the store to talk with a contractor.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=110}} This revelation contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\nThe same evening, Michael Rossi was interviewed a second time: on this occasion, Rossi was more cooperative, informing detectives that in the summer of 1977, Gacy had had him spread ten bags of [[Lime (material)|lime]] in the crawl space of the house.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}}\n\nOn December 19, investigators began compiling evidence for a second search warrant of Gacy's house. The same day, Gacy's lawyers filed the civil suit against the Des Plaines police. The hearing of the suit was scheduled for December 22. That afternoon, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives inside his house. On this occasion, as one officer distracted Gacy with conversation, another officer walked into Gacy's bedroom in an unsuccessful attempt to write down the serial number of the Motorola TV set they suspected belonged to John Szyc. While flushing Gacy's toilet, this officer noticed a smell he suspected could be that of rotting corpses emanating from a [[heating duct]]; the officers who previously searched Gacy's house had failed to notice this, as on that occasion the house had been cold.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nBoth David Cram and Michael Rossi were interviewed by investigators on December 20. Rossi had agreed to be interviewed in relation to his possible links with John Szyc as well as the disappearance of Robert Piest. When questioned by Kozenczak as to where he believed Gacy had placed Piest's body, Rossi replied: \"In the crawl space; he could have put him in the crawl space.\"<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 147</ref> A polygraph test showed his responses to questions to be inconclusive; however, upon his agreeing to a subsequent visual test in which a map of Cook County was divided into 12 [[Grid plan|grid sections]] numbered 1 to 12, with Gacy's home marked in the fourth grid section, Kozenczak noted an extreme response in Rossi's [[blood pressure]] when asked: \"Is the body of Robert Piest buried in grid number 4?\"<ref>Kozenczak, Joseph R.; Kozenczak, Karen M.

Cram then stated Gacy had grabbed a flashlight and immediately entered the crawl space to look for evidence of digging. When asked whether he had been to the crawl space, Cram replied he had been asked by Gacy to spread lime down there and also dug trenches upon Gacy's behest with the explanation they were for plumbing.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}} Cram stated these trenches were {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} wide, {{convert|6|ft|m|sp=us}} long and {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} deep\u2014the size of graves.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=143\u2013145}}\n\n===Verbal confession===\nOn the evening of December 20, Gacy drove to his lawyers' office in [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]] to attend a pre-scheduled meeting he had arranged with them, ostensibly to discuss the progress of his civil suit. Upon his arrival, Gacy appeared disheveled and immediately asked for an alcoholic drink, whereupon Sam Amirante fetched a bottle of whiskey from his car. Upon his return, Amirante asked Gacy what he had to discuss with them. Gacy picked up a copy of the ''[[Chicago Daily Herald|Daily Herald]]'' from Amirante's desk; he pointed to a front-page article covering the disappearance of Robert Piest and informed his lawyers: \"This boy is dead. He's in a river.\"{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=136}}\n\nOver the following hours, Gacy gave a rambling confession that ran into the early hours of the following morning. He began by informing Amirante and Stevens he had \"been the judge ... jury and executioner of many, many people\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 127</ref> most of whom he stated were buried in his crawl space, and others in the Des Plaines River. Some victims he referred to by name; most he dismissed as \"[[Male prostitution|male prostitutes]]\", \"hustlers\" and \"liars\" to whom he gave \"the rope trick\". On other occasions, he stated he woke up to find \"dead, strangled kids\" on his floor, with their hands cuffed behind their back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=171}}\n\nAs a result of the alcohol he had consumed, Gacy fell asleep midway through his confession and Amirante immediately arranged a psychiatric appointment for Gacy at 9:00&nbsp;a.m. that morning. Upon awakening several hours later, Gacy simply shook his head when informed by Amirante he had earlier confessed to killing approximately 30 people, stating: \"Well, I can't think about this right now. I've got things to do.\"<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\">Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150</ref> Ignoring his lawyers' advice regarding his scheduled appointment, Gacy left their office to attend to the needs of his business.<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\" />\n\nGacy later recollected his memories of his final day of freedom as being \"hazy\", adding that he knew his arrest was inevitable and that, in his final hours of freedom, he intended to visit his friends and say his final farewells.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=255\u2013258}} Upon leaving his lawyers' office, Gacy drove to a Shell gas station where, in the course of filling his rental car, he handed a small bag of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to the attendant, Lance Jacobson. Jacobson immediately handed the bag to the surveillance officers, adding that Gacy had told him: \"The end is coming (for me). These guys are going to kill me.\" Gacy then drove to the home of a fellow contractor, Ronald Rhode. Inside Rhode's living room, Gacy hugged Rhode before bursting into tears and saying: \"I killed thirty people, give or take a few.\" Gacy then left Rhode's home to meet with Michael Rossi and David Cram. As he drove along the expressway, the surveillance officers noted he was holding a [[Catholic rosary|rosary]] to his chin as he prayed while driving.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=152}}\n\nAfter talking with Cram and Rossi at Cram's home, Gacy had Cram drive him to a scheduled meeting with Leroy Stevens. As he spoke with his lawyer, Cram informed the officers that Gacy had earlier divulged to both himself and Rossi that the previous evening, he had confessed to his lawyers his guilt in over thirty murders. Upon concluding his meeting with his lawyer, Gacy had Cram drive him to Maryhill Cemetery, where his father was buried.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=259}}\n\nAs Gacy drove to various locations that morning, police outlined their formal draft of their second search warrant. The purpose of the warrant was specifically to search for the body of Robert Piest in the crawl space. Upon hearing radioed reports from the surveillance detectives that, in light of his erratic behavior, Gacy might be about to commit suicide, police decided to arrest him upon a charge of possession and distribution of marijuana{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=157}} in order to hold him in custody as the formal request for a second search warrant was presented. At 4:30 on the afternoon of December 21, the eve of the hearing of Gacy's civil suit, the request for a second search warrant was granted by Judge Marvin J. Peters.<ref>Kozenczak, (2012) p. 158</ref>\n\nArmed with the signed search warrant, police and evidence technicians quickly drove to Gacy's home. Upon their arrival, officers found that Gacy had unplugged his [[sump pump]] and that the crawl space was flooded with water; to clear the water they simply replaced the plug and waited for the water to drain. After it had done so, evidence technician Daniel Genty entered the {{convert|28|x|38|ft|adj=on}} crawl space,<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 50.</ref> crawled to the southwest area, and began digging. Within minutes, he had uncovered [[putrefaction|putrefied]] flesh and a human arm bone. Genty immediately shouted to the investigators that they could charge Gacy with murder.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}} Genty added the remark: \"I think this place is full of kids.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}}\n\n==Arrest and confession==\n[[File:Gacysmilemugshot.png|thumb|150px|Gacy's [[mug shot]], taken December 22.]]\nAfter being informed that the police had found human remains in his crawl space and that he would now face murder charges, Gacy told officers he wanted to \"clear the air\",{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} adding that he had known his arrest was inevitable since the previous evening, which he had spent on the couch in his lawyers' office.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=170}}\n\nIn the early hours of December 22, 1978, Gacy confessed to police that since 1972, he had committed 25 to 30 murders, all of whom he falsely claimed were of teenage male [[Runaway (dependent)|runaway]]s or male prostitutes, the majority of whom he had buried in his crawl space.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=174}} He also confessed he had buried the body of John Butkovich in his garage.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=188}} When asked where he drew the inspiration for the two-by-four attached with manacles at either end found at his house, Gacy stated he had been inspired to construct the device from reading about the [[Dean Corll|Houston Mass Murders]].{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=197}}{{efn|The Houston Mass Murders were a series of killings uncovered in 1973 in which Dean Corll, with two teenaged accomplices, had also used a wooden device (in their case a board fitted with handcuffs at each corner) to restrain their male victims throughout their sexual abuse and torture.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Man with the Candy: The Story of the Houston Mass Murders|last = Olsen|first = Jack|publisher = Simon and Schuster|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-439-12870-1 |page = 146}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = How to Make a Serial Killer: The Twisted Development of Innocent Children Into the World's Most Sadistic Murderers|last = Berry-Dee|first = Christopher|publisher = Ulysses Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-569-75943-1|location = |page = 202}}</ref> Gacy was likely inspired to construct this device, and to initially restrain his victims by tricking them into handcuffs, by press coverage relating to the Houston Mass Murders.{{sfn|Berry-Dee|2009|p=138}}}} In January 1979, he had planned to further conceal the corpses by covering the entire crawl space with concrete.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=222}} \n\nWhen specifically questioned about Piest, Gacy confessed to strangling him at his house on the evening of December 11 after luring him there.

Those doctors refuted the defense doctors' claims of multiple personality and insanity. Cram and Rossi both confessed that Gacy had made them dig trenches in his crawl space. Cram testified that in August 1977, Gacy had marked a location in the crawl space with sticks and told him to dig a [[Drainage#Drainage in construction|drainage]] trench.<ref name=\"The Montreal Gazette Feb. 13, 1980\" />{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=311}}\n\nImmediately after Cram had completed his testimony, Rossi testified for the state. When asked where he had dug in the crawl space, Rossi turned to a diagram of Gacy's home on display in the courtroom. This diagram showed where the bodies were found in the crawl space and elsewhere on the property. Rossi pointed to the location of the remains of an unidentified victim known as \"Body 13\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=311}} Rossi stated he had not dug any other trenches, but\u2014at Gacy's request\u2014had supervised other PDM employees digging trenches in the crawl space.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}\n\nBoth Rossi and Cram also testified that Gacy periodically looked into the crawl space to ensure they and other employees ordered to dig trenches in the crawl space did not deviate from the precise locations he had marked.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=312}} Gacy had testified after his arrest that he had only dug five of the victims' graves in his crawl space{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=142}} and had his employees (including Gregory Godzik) dig the remaining trenches so that he would \"have graves available\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=360}}\n\nOn February 18, Dr. Robert Stein,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=321}} the Cook County medical examiner appointed to supervise the exhumation of the victims' bodies from Gacy's home, testified as to how he and his colleagues had conducted the recovery of the remains.

Rignall repeatedly wept as he recounted his ordeal. In response to questioning relating to whether Gacy appreciated the criminality of his actions, Rignall stated his belief that Gacy was unable to conform his actions to the conduct of law because of the \"beastly and animalistic ways he attacked me\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 290</ref> Upon specific cross-examination relating to the torture he had endured, Rignall vomited before he was excused from further testimony.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=300}}\n\nOn February 29, Donald Voorhees, whom Gacy had sexually assaulted in 1967, testified to his ordeal at Gacy's hands, and that Gacy had subsequently paid another youth to beat him and spray Mace in his face so he would not testify against him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}} Voorhees felt unable to testify, but did briefly attempt to do so, before being asked to step down.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}}\n\nRobert Donnelly testified the week after Voorhees, recounting his ordeal at Gacy's hands in December 1977. Donnelly was visibly distressed as he recollected the abuse he endured at Gacy's hands and came close to breaking down on several occasions. As Donnelly testified, Gacy repeatedly laughed at him,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=333}} but Donnelly finished his testimony. One of Gacy's defense attorneys, Robert Motta, during Donnelly's cross-examination, attempted to discredit his testimony, but Donnelly did not waver from his testimony of what had occurred.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=345}}\n\nDuring the fifth week of the trial, Gacy wrote a personal letter to Judge Garippo requesting a [[mistrial]]{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=342}} on a number of bases, including that he did not approve his lawyers' insanity plea approach; that his lawyers had not allowed him to take the witness stand (as he had desired to do); that his defense had not called enough witnesses, and that the police were lying about statements he had purportedly made to detectives after his arrest and that, in any event, the statements were \"self-serving\" for use by the prosecution.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=350\u2013351}} Judge Garippo addressed Gacy's letter by informing him that under the law he had the choice as to whether he wished to testify, and he was free to indicate as much to the judge if he wished to do so.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=312}}\n\n===Closing arguments===\nOn March 11, final arguments from both prosecution and defense attorneys began, with the arguments concluding on the following day. Prosecuting attorney Terry Sullivan argued first, outlining Gacy's history of abusing youths, the testimony of his efforts to avoid detection and describing Gacy's surviving victims\u2014Voorhees and Donnelly\u2014as \"living dead\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}} Referring to Gacy as the \"worst of all murderers\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 324</ref> Sullivan stated: \"John Gacy has accounted for more human devastation than many earthly catastrophes, but one must tremble. I tremble when thinking about just how close he came to getting away with it all.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}}\n\nAfter the state's four-hour closing, counsel Sam Amirante argued for the defense. Amirante argued against the testimony delivered by the doctors who had testified for the prosecution, repeatedly citing the testimony of the four psychiatrists and psychologists who had testified on behalf of the defense.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=360}} Amirante also accused Sullivan of scarcely referring to the evidence presented throughout the trial in his own closing argument, and of arousing hatred against his client. The defense lawyer attempted to portray Gacy as a \"man driven by compulsions he was unable to control\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=363}}\n\nIn support of these arguments, the defense counsel repeatedly referred to the testimony of the doctors who had appeared for the defense, in addition to the testimony of defense witnesses such as Jeffrey Rignall and Gacy's former business associate Mickel Reed\u2014both of whom had testified to their belief that Gacy had been unable to control his actions.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=359}} Amirante then urged the jury to put aside any prejudice they held against his client, and requested they deliver a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, adding that the psychology of Gacy's behavior would be of benefit to scientific research and that the psychology of his mind should be studied.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=361}}\n\n[[File:Kunkletrial.jpg|200px|thumb|William Kunkle, prosecutor at Gacy's trial, standing before a board depicting the 22 victims identified by February 1980.]]\nOn the morning of March 12,{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=364}} William Kunkle continued to argue for the prosecution. Kunkle referred to the defense's contention of insanity as \"a [[falsity|sham]]\", arguing that the facts of the case demonstrated Gacy's ability to think logically and control his actions. Kunkle also referred to the testimony of a doctor who had examined Gacy in 1968. This doctor had diagnosed Gacy as an [[antisocial personality]], capable of committing crimes without remorse. Kunkle indicated that had the recommendations of this doctor been heeded, Gacy would have not been freed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}}\n\nAt the close of his argument, Kunkle pulled each of the 22 photos of Gacy's identified victims off a board displaying the images and asked the jury not to show sympathy but to \"show justice\". Kunkle then asked the jury to \"show the same sympathy this man showed when he took these lives and put them ''there!''{{-\"}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}} before throwing the stack of photos into the opening of the trap door of Gacy's crawl space, which had been introduced as evidence and was on display in the courtroom.

Given the gap of over four months between the dates of the murders of the first and second victims known to have been disposed in the river, it is possible that this unknown victim may have been killed between June and November 1978.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=220}}\n\nRetired Chicago police officer Bill Dorsch<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-03-30/news/chi-sheriff-wants-new-dig-for-gacy-victims-20120329_1_bill-dorsch-gacy-victims-west-miami-avenue/|title=Sheriff barred from digging for more Gacy victims|publisher=}}</ref> has stated he has reason to believe there may be more victims buried within the grounds of the apartment building located at the 6100 block of West Miami Avenue in Chicago; a property which Gacy is known to have been the caretaker of for several years prior to his 1978 arrest.

Amirante has since stated that the primary inspiration for this legislation was the fact that at the time of the Gacy murders, there had been a 72-hour period which police in Illinois had to allow to elapse before initiating a search for a missing child or adolescent.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\nThe Illinois Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984 removed this 72-hour waiting period. Other states across America subsequently adopted similar procedures and sensibilities, as a result of which a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed. This national network has since developed into the Child Abduction Emergency\u2014commonly known today as an [[Amber Alert]].{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\n==Potential accomplices and connections==\nOne of the first things Gacy told investigators after his arrest was that he had not acted alone in several of the murders: he asked whether \"my associates\" had also been arrested.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} When questioned as to whether these associates had participated directly or indirectly in the killings, Gacy replied, \"Directly.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}}\n\nGacy specifically named Cram and Rossi as being involved in several of the murders.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} In the 1980s, he also informed [[Robert Ressler]] that \"two or three\" PDM employees had assisted him in several murders.<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} pp 341\u2013342</ref> Ressler replied that he believed there were unexplained avenues to the case and stated his belief that Gacy had killed more than 33 victims.

At the bar, the surveillance officers overheard a hushed conversation between Gacy and one of his employees in which the youth asked Gacy the question: \"And what? Buried like the other five?\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}}\n\nIn interviews following his arrest and conviction, Gacy repeatedly claimed that he was not present in Chicago when 16 of the identified victims had disappeared. In one interview, he stated that at the time of his arrest, four PDM employees were also considered suspects in the disappearances of the missing boys investigators had linked to Gacy\u2014all of whom he stated were in possession of keys to his house.<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} pp=341\u2013342</ref> One of these employees was Philip Paske, a young man who is known to have been a close associate of John Norman.

To Nelson's family, Young had stated Nelson failed to arrive at a bar at a prearranged time; to investigators, Young claimed he had last seen Nelson standing among a crowd who had gathered outside a Chicago bar and when his attention was diverted for a few moments, Nelson simply disappeared.

The footage was shot in 1967 in [[Northern California]], and has since been subjected to many attempts to authenticate or debunk it.\n\nThe footage was filmed alongside Bluff Creek, a tributary of the [[Klamath River]], about 25 logging-road miles northwest of [[Orleans, California|Orleans]], [[California]], in Del Norte County. The film site is roughly 38 miles south of [[Oregon]] and 18 miles east of the [[Pacific Ocean]].<ref>Murphy (2008), 32</ref> For decades, the exact location of the site was lost, primarily because of re-growth of foliage in the streambed after the flood of 1964. It was rediscovered in 2011.<ref>\"BIGFOOT'S bLOG,\" January 21, 2013, at http://bigfootbooksblog.blogspot.com/2013/01/gps-coordinates-for-bluff-creek-pgf.html</ref><ref>''Bigfoot Times'' newsletter, August 2012</ref><ref>\"BIGFOOT'S bLOG,\" at http://bigfootbooksblog.blogspot.com/2015/06/corrections-and-clarifications-to-peter.html</ref> It is just south of a north-running segment of the creek informally known as \"the bowling alley\".\n\nThe filmmakers were Roger Patterson (February 14, 1933&nbsp;\u2013 January 15, 1972) and Robert \"'Bob\" Gimlin (born October 18, 1931). Patterson died of cancer in 1972 and \"maintained right to the end that the creature on the film was real\".<ref>McLeod, 128\u201329, 140</ref> Patterson's friend, Gimlin, has always denied being involved in any part of a hoax with Patterson. Gimlin mostly avoided publicly discussing the subject from at least the early 1970s until about 2005 (except for three appearances),<ref>In Toronto for Dahinden's book launch in 1973 (McLeod, 173); at the 1978 [[University of British Columbia]] Museum of Anthropology (McLeod, 140) Conference; and on ''[[Arthur C.

If the film was shot at 18 fps, as [[Grover Krantz]] believed,<ref>Krantz, 89, caption</ref> the event lasted 53 seconds. The date was October 20, 1967, according to the filmmakers, although some critics believe it was shot earlier.<ref>Long, 373\u201374, 401, 420\u201321</ref><ref>Daegling, 147\u201349</ref><ref>McLeod, 81\u201382</ref><ref>Munns, 5</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\nPatterson said he became interested in Bigfoot after reading an article about the creature by [[Ivan T. Sanderson]] in ''[[True (magazine)|True]]'' magazine in December 1959.<ref>Perez, 6</ref> In 1961 Sanderson published his encyclopedic ''Abominable Snowmen: Legend Come to Life,'' a worldwide survey of accounts of Bigfoot-type creatures, including recent track finds, etc. in the Bluff Creek area, which heightened his interest. Thereafter, Marian Place wrote:\n\n{{quote|In 1962 he visited Bluff Creek and talked with a whole host of Bigfoot-believers. In 1964<ref>However, Cliff Barackman's site notes that the year carved in the casts while they were drying is 1963. Cliff contends that the 1964 date in Patterson's book is likely an error. See http://cliffbarackman.com/bigfoot-prints/cast-index/1963-laird-meadow/</ref> he returned and met a timber-cruiser named Pat Graves, who drove him to Laird Meadows.<ref>Murphy (2009) 51, 120, 146, 170; It is mistakenly spelt \"Leard\" in a couple of books</ref> There Patterson saw fresh tracks\u2014for him an almost unbearably exciting, spine-chilling experience. What a tremendous feat it would be\u2014what a scientific breakthrough\u2014if he could obtain unshakable evidence that these tracks were not the work of a prankster, but the actual mark of a hitherto unknown creature! If he succeeded, he would be famous! And rich!\n\nAlas, fame and fortune were not gained that year, nor the next, nor the next. Patterson invested thousands of hours and dollars combing Bigfoot and Sasquatch territory. He fought constant ridicule and a shortage of funds. ... he founded ... the Northwest Research Foundation. Through it he solicited funds . ... The response was encouraging and enabled him to lead several expeditions. ... In 1966 he published a paperback book at his own expense. ... He added the income from its sales and his lectures to the search fund. As each wilderness jaunt failed to see or capture the monster, one by one the thrill-seekers dropped out. But Patterson never gave up.<ref>Marian Place, 135\u201336</ref>}}\n\nPatterson's book, ''Do Abominable Snowmen of America Really Exist?'', was [[self-published]] in 1966. The book has been characterized as \"little more than a collection of newspaper clippings laced together with Patterson's circus-poster style prose\".<ref>Hunter and Dahinden, 113</ref> The book, however, contains 20 pages of previously unpublished interviews and letters, 17 drawings by Patterson of the encounters described in the text, 5 hand-drawn maps (rare in subsequent Bigfoot books), and almost 20 photos and illustrations from other sources.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} It was first reprinted in 1996 by Chris Murphy,<ref>(under his publishing company, Pyramid Productions) in a very limited number (approximately 200, according to Murphy)</ref> and then again re-issued by Murphy<ref>under [[Hancock House Publishers|Hancock House]] Publishing</ref> in 2005 under the title ''The Bigfoot Film Controversy,'' with 81 pages of additional material by Murphy.\n\nIn May/June 1967 Patterson began filming a [[docudrama]] or [[pseudo-documentary]] about cowboys being led by an old miner and a wise Indian [[tracking (hunting)|tracker]] on a hunt for Bigfoot. The storyline called for Patterson, his Indian guide (Gimlin in a wig), and the cowboys to recall in flashbacks the stories of Fred Beck (of the 1924 [[Ape Canyon]] incident) and others as they tracked the beast on horseback. For actors and cameraman, Patterson used at least nine volunteer acquaintances, including Gimlin and Bob Heironimus, for three days of shooting, perhaps over the Memorial Day weekend.<ref>Long, 39, 109\u201310, 115, 228\u201329</ref><ref>This is the only stretch in that period that all the men would have had 3 free days.</ref> Patterson would have needed a costume to represent Bigfoot, if the time came to shoot such climactic scenes.\n\nPrior to the October 1967 filming, Patterson apparently visited [[Los Angeles]] on these occasions:\n*Roger drove to [[Hollywood]] in 1964 and visited rockabilly songwriter and guitarist Jerry Lee Merritt, a [[Yakima, Washington|Yakima]] native who was living there in Hollywood then.<ref>Long, 132</ref><ref>Patterson and Murphy, 15</ref> He was trying to sell his hoop-toy invention.<ref>Long, 176\u201377; Al Hodgson remembers that this was his mission on \"the first time I met him [1964]\" on his way south.</ref><ref>McLeod, 79</ref>\n*In 1966 he visited Merritt again while he was still trying to sell his hoop-toy invention.<ref>Long, 107, 126</ref> \nMerritt soon moved back to Yakima and became Patterson's neighbor, and later his collaborator on his Bigfoot documentary.<ref>Long, 99; see also Long, 100\u201333 and 312</ref> \n*Later in 1966 he and Merritt drove down there for several purposes. Patterson visited cowboy film star [[Roy Rogers]] for help.<ref>Long, 73, 91, 230</ref> He tried to sell his ponies-and-wagon to [[Disneyland]] or [[Knott's Berry Farm]].<ref>Long, 230</ref> \n*In the summer of 1967, apparently after getting $700 from the Radfords and shooting some of his documentary, they tried unsuccessfully to attract investors to help further fund his Bigfoot movie.<ref>Long, 110\u201311, 114, 130</ref> They copyrighted or trademarked the term \"Bigfoot\".<ref>Long, 127, 140</ref>\n\nBoth Patterson <ref>Long, 90. (This citation does not cover this entire sentence.)</ref> and Gimlin had been rodeo riders and amateur boxers\u2014and local champions in their weight classes. Patterson had played high school football.\n\nIn October 1967, Patterson and his friend Gimlin set out for the [[Six Rivers National Forest]] in far [[Northern California]]. They drove in Gimlin's truck, carrying his provisions and three horses, positioned sideways. Patterson chose the area because of intermittent reports of the creatures in the past, and of their enormous footprints since 1958. (His familiarity with the area and its residents from prior visits may also have been a factor.)\n\nThe most recent of these reports was the nearby Blue Creek Mountain track find, which was investigated by journalist [[John Willison Green|John Green]], Bigfoot hunter [[Ren\u00e9 Dahinden]], and archaeologist Don Abbott on and after August 28, 1967.<ref>Perez, 8</ref> This find was reported to Patterson (via his wife) soon thereafter by Al Hodgson, owner of the Willow Creek [[Variety Store]].<ref>Byrne, 138</ref><ref>Jevning, ''Notes from the Field: Tracking North America's Sasquatch,'' 105, quoting Hodgson in an interview. Later, Hodgson said, he \"branched out\" into selling, e.g., clothing (and the \"variety store\" designation was dropped).</ref>\n\nThough Gimlin says he doubted the existence of Sasquatch-like creatures, he agreed to Patterson's insistence that they should not attempt to shoot one.<ref>Daegling, 115</ref>\n\n==Encounter==\nAs their stories went, in the early afternoon of Friday, October 20, 1967, Patterson and Gimlin were riding generally northeast (upstream) on horseback along the east bank of Bluff Creek. At sometime between 1:15 and 1:40 PM, they \"came to an overturned tree with a large root system at a turn in the creek, almost as high as a room\".<ref>Perez, 9, 20</ref><ref>Gimlin, quoted in Perez, 9</ref>\n\nWhen they rounded it, \"there was a logjam\u2014a 'crow's nest'\u2014left over from the flood of '64,\" and then they spotted the figure behind it nearly simultaneously. It was either \"crouching beside the creek to their left\" or \"standing\" there, on the opposite bank. Gimlin later described himself as in a mild state of shock after first seeing the figure.<ref name=\"Meldrum, 139\">Meldrum, 139</ref><ref name=\"Krantz, 87\">Krantz, 87</ref><ref name=\"Meldrum, 139\"/>\n\nPatterson initially estimated its height at {{convert|6|ft|6|in}} to {{convert|7|ft}},<ref>Patterson & Murphy, 195</ref> and later raised his estimate to about {{convert|7|ft|6|in}}. Some later analysts, anthropologist [[Grover Krantz]] among them, have suggested Patterson's later estimate was about {{convert|1|ft}} too tall. Gimlin's estimate was {{convert|6|ft}}.\n\nThe film shows what Patterson and Gimlin claimed was a large, hairy, [[bipedalism|bipedal]], apelike figure with short, \"silvery brown\"<ref>Patterson and Murphy, 195</ref> or \"dark reddish-brown\"<ref>Napier, 90</ref> or \"black\"<ref>Sanderson (1969), 66</ref> hair covering most of its body, including its prominent breasts. The figure in the film generally matches the descriptions of Bigfoot offered by others who claim to have seen one.\n\nPatterson estimated he was about {{Convert|25|ft}} away from the creature at his closest. Patterson said that his horse reared upon sensing the figure, and he spent about 20 seconds extricating himself from the saddle, controlling his horse, getting around to its other side,<ref>Perez, 9</ref> and getting his camera from a saddlebag before he could run toward the figure while operating his camera. He yelled \"Cover me\" to Gimlin, \"meaning to get the gun out\".<ref name=\"Perez, 10\">Perez, 10</ref> Gimlin crossed the creek on horseback after Patterson had run well beyond it, riding on a path somewhat to the left of Patterson's and somewhat beyond his position. Perez estimates he came within {{convert|60\u201390|ft}} of \"Patty\".<ref name=\"Perez, 10\"/> Then, rifle in hand, he dismounted, but did not point his rifle at the creature.<ref>Meldrum, 140</ref>\n\nThe figure had walked away from them to a distance of about {{convert|120|ft}} before Patterson began to run after it. The resulting film (about 59.5 seconds long at 16 fps) is initially quite shaky until Patterson got about {{convert|80|ft}} from the figure. At that point, the figure glanced over its right shoulder at the men and Patterson fell to his knees; on Krantz's map this corresponds to frame 264.<ref name=\"Perez, 12\">Perez, 12</ref> To researcher [[John Willison Green|John Green]], Patterson would later characterize the creature's expression as one of \"contempt and disgust ... you know how it is when the umpire tells you 'one more word and you're out of the game.' That's the way it felt.\"\n\nShortly after this point the steady, middle portion of the film begins, containing the famous look-back frame 352. Patterson said, \"it turned a total of I think three times,\"<ref>Wasson, 69</ref> the other times therefore being before the filming began and/or while he was running with his finger off the trigger. Shortly after glancing over its shoulder on film, the creature disappeared behind a grove of trees for 14 seconds, then reappeared in the film's final 15 seconds after Patterson moved {{convert|10|ft}} to a better vantage point, fading into the trees again and being lost to view at a distance of {{convert|265|ft}} as the reel of film ran out.<ref>Krantz, 89\u201390</ref>\n\nGimlin remounted and followed it on horseback, keeping his distance, until it disappeared around a bend in the road three hundred yards away. Patterson called him back at that point, feeling vulnerable on foot without a rifle, because he feared the creature's mate might approach. The entire encounter had lasted less than two minutes.\n\nNext, Gimlin and Patterson rounded up Patterson's horses, which had run off in the opposite direction, downstream, before the filming began. Patterson got his second roll of film from his saddlebag and filmed the tracks.<ref>Wylie, 12</ref> Then the men tracked \"Patty\" for either one mile<ref name=\"Perez, 12\"/> or {{Convert|3|mi|spell=in}},<ref>Sanderson (1969), 68; Sanderson might have mixed up this with the three-mile distance they traveled back to the campsite.</ref> but \"lost it in the heavy undergrowth\".<ref>Coleman and Clark, 198</ref> They went to their campsite three miles south, picked up plaster, returned to the initial site, measured the creature's step-length, and made two [[plaster cast]]s, one each of the best-quality right and left prints.\n\n===Details===\n\nAccording to Patterson and Gimlin, they were the only witnesses to their brief encounter with what they claimed was a sasquatch. Their statements agree in general, but author Greg Long notes a number of inconsistencies. They offered somewhat different sequences in describing how they and the horses reacted upon seeing the creature. Patterson in particular increased his estimates of the creature's size in subsequent retellings of the encounter.<ref>Long, 162\u201365</ref> In a different context, Long argues, these discrepancies would probably be considered minor, but given the extraordinary claims made by Patterson and Gimlin, any apparent disagreements in perception or memory are worth noting.\n\nThe film's defenders have responded by saying that commercially motivated hoaxers would have \"got their stories straight\" beforehand so they wouldn't have disagreed immediately upon being interviewed, and on so many points, and so they wouldn't have created a suit and a creature with foreseeably objectionable features and behaviors.<ref>For instance, see \"How Not to Plan a Hoaxed Filming,\" ''Bigfoot Times'', March 2004.</ref>\n\nA more serious objection concerns the film's \"timeline\". This is important because Kodachrome II movie film, as far as is known, could only be developed by a lab containing a $60,000+ machine, and the few West Coast labs known to possess one did not do developing over weekends. Patterson's brother-in-law Al DeAtley claims not to remember where he took the film for development or where he picked it up.<ref>Long, 252\u201354</ref>\n\nCritics claim that too much happened between the filming (at 1:15 at the earliest) and the filmmakers' arrival in Willow Creek (at 6:30 at the latest). Daegling wrote, \"All of the problems with the timeline disappear if the film is shot a few days or hours beforehand. If that is the case, one has to wonder what other details of this story are wrong.\"<ref>Daegling, ''Bigfoot Exposed'', 147\u201349.</ref><ref>McLeod, ''Anatomy of a Beast'', 79\u201382.</ref> The film's defenders retort that although the time window was tight, it was do-able.<ref>Perez, ''Bigfoot Times'',</ref>\n\nChris Murphy wrote, \"I have confirmed with Bob Gimlin that Patterson definitely rode a small quarter horse (which he owned), not his Welsh pony 'Peanuts'. Also, that Patterson had arranged to borrow a horse by the name of 'Chico' from Bob Heironimus for Gimlin to use ... Gimlin did not have a horse that was suitable (old enough) for the expedition.\"<ref>Murphy (2008), 39</ref> Heironimus stated that Chico (a middle-aged gelding) \"wouldn't jump or buck ...\"<ref>Long, 347</ref>\n\n==Immediate aftermath==\n\nAt approximately 6:30 PM,<ref>McLeod, 79, quoting Hodgson in an interview with him</ref> Patterson and Gimlin met up with Al Hodgson at his [[variety store]] in [[Willow Creek, California|Willow Creek]], approximately 54.3 miles south by road, about 28.8 miles by Bluff Creek Road from their camp to the 1967 roadhead by Bluff Creek, and 25.5 miles down [[California State Route 96]] to Willow Creek. Patterson intended to drive on to [[Eureka, California|Eureka]] to ship his film. Either at that time, or when he arrived in the Eureka/[[Arcata, California|Arcata]] area, he called Al DeAtley (his brother-in-law in Yakima) and told him to expect the film he was shipping. He requested Hodgson to call Donald Abbott,<ref>Murphy, ''Bigfoot Film Journal'', 34\u201335</ref> whom [[Grover Krantz]] described as \"the only scientist of any stature to have demonstrated any serious interest in the [Bigfoot] subject,\" hoping he would help them search for the creature by bringing a tracking dog.<ref>Murphy, ''Bigfoot Film Journal'', 34, 39</ref> Hodgson called, but Abbott declined. Krantz argued that this call the same day of the encounter is evidence against a hoax, at least on Patterson's part.<ref>Krantz, 122</ref>\n\nAfter shipping the film, they headed back toward their camp, where they had left their horses. On their way they \"stopped at the Lower Trinity Ranger Station, as planned, arriving about 9:00 p.m. Here they met with Syl McCoy [another friend] and Al Hodgson.\"<ref name=\"Murphy, Bigfoot Film Journal, p 35\">Murphy, ''Bigfoot Film Journal'', p 35</ref> At this point Patterson called the daily ''[[Times-Standard]]'' newspaper in Eureka and related his story.<ref>Murphy (2008), 40</ref> They arrived back at their campsite at about midnight.

His Cine-Kodak K-100 camera had markings on its continuously variable dial at 16, 24, 32, 48, and 64 frames per second, but no click-stops, and was capable of filming at any frame speed within this range. [[Grover Krantz]] wrote, \"Patterson clearly told [[John Willison Green|John Green]] that he found, after the filming, that the camera was set on 18 frames per second (fps). ... \"<ref>Krantz, 306</ref><ref>Green (1978), 126</ref> It has been suggested that Patterson simply misread \"16\" as \"18\".\n\n*\"Dr. D.W. Grieve, an anatomist with expertise in human biomechanics ... evaluated the various possibilities\" regarding film speed and did not come to a conclusion between them. He \"confessed to being perplexed and unsettled\" by \"the tangible possibility that it [the film subject] was real\".<ref>Daegling, 109\u201311</ref>\n*[[John Napier (primatologist)|John Napier]], a primatologist, claimed that \"if the movie was filmed at 24 frame/s then the creature's walk cannot be distinguished from a normal human walk. If it was filmed at 16 or 18 frame/s, there are a number of important respects in which it is quite unlike man's gait.\"<ref name=\"Napier, 94, 2nd printing\">Napier, 94 [2nd printing]</ref> Napier, who published before Dahinden and Krantz,<ref>Bayanov, 70</ref> contended it was \"likely that Patterson would have used 24 frame/s\" because it \"is best suited to TV transmission,\" while conceding that \"this is entirely speculative.\"<ref name=\"Napier, 94, 2nd printing\"/><ref>Regal, 120, writes: \"Krantz also found a copy of the camera's manual. It states, 'For normal screen action, when using a silent projector, use the 16 frames per second speed.'\"</ref>\n*[[Grover Krantz|Krantz]] argued, on the basis of an analysis by Igor Bourtsev, that since Patterson's height is known (5'2\" or 5'3\"), a reasonable calculation can be made of his pace. This running pace can be synchronized with the regular bounces in the initial jumpy portions of the film that were caused by each fast step Patterson took to approach the creature. On the basis of this analysis, Krantz argued that a speed of 24 frames per second can be quickly dismissed and that \"[we] may safely rule out 16 frames per second and accept the speed of 18.\"<ref>Krantz, 96</ref>\n*[[Ren\u00e9 Dahinden]] stated that \"the footage of the horses prior to the Bigfoot film looks jerky and unnatural when projected at 24 frame/s.\"<ref name=\"Perez, 21\">Perez, 21</ref> And Dahinden experimented at the film site by having people walk rapidly over the creature's path and reported: \"None of us ... could walk that distance in 40 seconds [952 frames / 24 frame/s = 39.6 s], ... so I eliminated 24 frame/s.\"<ref name=\"Perez, 21\"/>\n*Bill Munns wrote, \"One researcher, Bill Miller, found technical data from a [[Kodak]] technician that stated the K-100 cameras were tweaked so even when the dial is set to 16 fps, the camera actually runs at 18 fps. ... I have nine K-100 cameras now. ... I tried it on one camera, and got 18 fps, but the rest still need testing [and all with \"film running through the camera\"].\"<ref>Munns, 326\u201327</ref>\n\n==Analysis==\nThe Patterson\u2013Gimlin film has seen relatively little interest from mainstream scientists. Statements of scientists who viewed the film at a screening, or who conducted a study, are reprinted in Chris Murphy's ''Bigfoot Film Journal''.<ref>Murphy (2008), 59\u201366, 72\u201382</ref> Typical objections include: Neither humans nor chimpanzees have hairy breasts as does the figure in the film, and Napier has noted that a [[sagittal crest]] is \"only very occasionally seen, to an insignificant extent, in chimpanzees {{sic}} females\".<ref>Cited in Wasson, 74</ref> Critics have argued these features are evidence against authenticity. Krantz countered the latter point, saying \"a sagittal crest ... is a consequence of absolute size alone.\"<ref>Krantz, 304</ref>\n\nAs anthropologist [[David Daegling]] writes, \"[t]he skeptics have not felt compelled to offer much of a detailed argument against the film; the burden of proof, rightly enough, should lie with the advocates.\" Yet, without a detailed argument against authenticity, Daegling notes that \"the film has not gone away.\"<ref>Daegling, 119</ref> Similarly, [[Grover Krantz|Krantz]] argues that of the many opinions offered about the Patterson film, \"[o]nly a few of these opinions are based on technical expertise and careful study of the film itself.\"<ref name=\"Krantz, 92\">Krantz, 92</ref>\n\nRegarding the quality of the film, second-generation copies or copies from TV and DVD productions are inferior to first-generation copies. Many early frames are blurry due to camera shake, and the quality of subsequent frames varies for the same reason. Stabilization of the film (e.g., by M. K. Davis) to counter the effect of camera shake has improved viewers' ability to analyze it. Regarding \"graininess,\" Bill Munns writes, \"Based on transparencies taken off the camera original, ... the PGF original is as fine grain as any color 16mm film can achieve.\" He adds that graininess increases as images are magnified.<ref>Munns, 366\u201370</ref>\n\n===Scientific studies favorable to the film===\n\n====Bayanov et al.====\nDimitri Bayanov, Igor Bourtsev, and [[Ren\u00e9 Dahinden]] authored \"Analysis of the Patterson\u2013Gimlin Film, Why We Find It Authentic\". It is a study with sections examining the technical characteristics of the footage, the filming speed, the morphology of the creature, and the specimen's movements.

He inferred the film's subject was weighty from the ponderous momentum he observed in the movements of its arms and legs, in the sagging of the knee as weight came onto it, and in the flatness of the foot. Its gait he considered non-artificial because it was confident and unwavering, \"neatly expressive,\" and well-coordinated\u2014and yet non-human because its arm motion and glide resembled a cross-country skier's. Krantz describes Donskoy's conclusion as being that the film depicts \"a very massive animal that is definitely not a human being\".<ref name=\"Krantz, 92\"/>\n\n====Reuben Steindorf====\nJeff Meldrum wrote, \"Animator and computer-generated effects expert Reuben Steindorf, of Vision Realm, created a computer model of 'Patty,' as the film subject has been nicknamed. ... Steindorf reconstructed Patty's skeletal anatomy from the ground up, using 'reverse kinematics.'\"<ref>Meldrum, 172</ref> Among other findings, \"Steindorf confirmed ... that the upper extremity was rather long compared to the lower.

An average human IM is 71.\"<ref>Meldrum, 174</ref>\n\n====Gordon Strasenburgh====\nGordon Strasenburgh authored \"The Crested Australopithecus Robustus and the Patterson\u2013Gimlin Film\". After an introduction, it reviews four other studies and opinions by scientists on the film, then goes on with the following sections: Testing Hypotheses, Anthropological Attitudes, Alternatives to ''A. robustus'', The Basic Problem, and Conclusion. The last section begins, \"The Patterson\u2013Gimlin film and its analytical results to date are the best data.\"<ref>in Markotic and Krantz, eds.

He was unable to find evidence of fakery, but noted several indications of authenticity. His conclusions are summed up on one page in two of Christopher Murphy's books.<ref name=\"Murphy 2004, 80\"/><ref>Murphy (2009), 90</ref> Background information on Glickman's project, sponsored by his \"North American Science Institute\" (NASI), can be found in another of Murphy's books.<ref>Murphy (2008), 83\u201385</ref>\n\n====Grover Krantz====\nAnthropologist [[Grover Krantz]] was originally skeptical of the Patterson film, based on the still photos in [[Argosy Magazine]], but changed his mind in 1969 after seeing the film because \"the realism of the creature's locomotion impressed him.\"<ref>Regal, 87\u201388</ref> He later offered an in-depth examination of the Patterson film.<ref>Krantz, 88\u2013124</ref> He concluded that the film depicts a genuine unknown creature. Primarily, Krantz's argument is based on a detailed analysis of the figure's stride, [[center of gravity]], and biomechanics. Krantz argues that the creature's leg and foot motions are quite different from a human's and could not have been duplicated by a person wearing a [[gorilla suit]].<ref>Krantz, 111\u201316</ref> Krantz wrote, \"the knee is regularly bent more than 90\u00b0, while the human leg bends less than 70\u00b0.\" Daniel Perez brought out the implication of this, writing, \"The subject['s] ... toes lift off the soil at least ten inches in every walking cycle. ... Ren\u00e9 Dahinden ... filmed and studied how modern man walks, finding ... a maximum of 2\u20133 inches of distance between toes and the surface it is walking over. ... \"<ref name=\"Perez, 22\"/> No human has yet replicated this 10-inch-high lower leg lift while maintaining the smoothness, posture, and stride length (41\") of the creature.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nKrantz pointed out the tremendous width of the creature's shoulders, which (after deducting 1\" for hair) he estimated at 28.2&nbsp;inches, or 35.1% of its full standing height of 78\", or a higher percentage of its 72-inch \"walking height,\" which was a bit stooped, crouched, and sunk into the sand.<ref>Krantz, 106\u201308</ref> The creature's shoulders are almost 50% wider than the human mean. (For comparison, [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] had a typical human ratio of 24%. Wide-shouldered Bob Heironimus (see below) has 27.4%. Only very rarely do humans have a shoulder breadth of 30%.) Krantz argued that a suited person could not mimic this breadth and still have the naturalistic hand and arm motions present on the film.\n\nKrantz and others have noted natural-looking [[muscle|musculature]] visible as the creature moved, arguing this would be highly difficult or impossible to fake. Hunter and Dahinden also note that \"the bottom of the figure's head seems to become part of the heavy back and shoulder muscles ... [and] the muscles of the buttocks were distinct.\"<ref>Hunter and Dahinden, 114</ref>\n\n====Jeffrey Meldrum====\n[[D. Jeffrey Meldrum|Jeffrey Meldrum]] of [[Idaho State University]] cites efforts by [[John Willison Green|John Green]] as important in his own studies of the Patterson film. \"It has been obvious to even the casual viewer that the film subject possesses arms that are disproportionately long for its stature.\" Meldrum writes that \"Anthropologists typically express limb proportions as an [[intermembral index]] (IM)\" and notes that humans have an average IM index of 72, gorillas an average IM index of 117 and chimpanzees an average IM index of 106.<ref name=\"Meldrum BFRO\">{{cite web|last1=Meldrum|first1=Jeffrey|title=The Truth Before our Eyes|url=http://www.bfro.net/news/challenge/green.asp|publisher=BFRO|accessdate=April 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn determining an IM index for the figure in the Patterson film, Meldrum concludes the figure has \"an IM index somewhere between 80 and 90, intermediate between humans and African apes. In spite of the imprecision of this preliminary estimate, it is well beyond the mean for humans and effectively rules out a man-in-a-suit explanation for the Patterson\u2013Gimlin film without invoking an elaborate, if not inconceivable, prosthetic contrivance to account for the appropriate positions and actions of wrist and elbow and finger [[flexion]] visible on the film. This point deserves further examination and may well rule out the probability of hoaxing.\"<ref name=\"Meldrum BFRO\"/>\n\nIn his book, Meldrum says, \"[Reuben] Steindorf tracked the joint centers through 116 frames of the film, yielding a reliable estimate of the film subject's limb proportions. ... The combination of these proportions with the exceptional breadth dimensions argue[s] compellingly against the simplistic hypothesis of an average man, even one wearing shoulder pads ... or using artificial arm extensions.\"<ref>Meldrum, 174; see also 180</ref>\n\nHowever, scientist [[Esteban Sarmiento]] (see below) disagrees that the subject has a non-human IMI.\n\nDr. Scott Lynn, Associate Professor of Kinesiology, California State University, was another scientist who reached a favorable conclusion.<ref>He appeared on the TV series ''American Paranormal'', Season 1, Episode 3, \"Bigfoot,\" 13 June 2010</ref>\n\n====D. W. Grieve====\nAnatomist D. W. Grieve of the [[Royal Free Hospital]] School of Medicine studied a copy of the film in 1971, and wrote a detailed analysis.<ref>Reprinted in Murphy (2004), 76\u201379</ref><ref>Reprinted in Murphy (2009), 86\u201389</ref><ref>Reprinted in Byrne, 152\u201357</ref> He notes, \"The possibility of a very clever fake cannot be ruled out on the evidence of the film\" but also writes that his analysis hinges largely on the question of filming speed.<ref name=\"Grieve Report\">{{cite web|last1=Grieve|first1=D. W.|title=Report on the Film of a Supposed Sasquatch|url=http://www.bigfoot-lives.com/html/report_on_the_film_of_a_suppos.html|publisher=Bigfoot-lives.com|accessdate=April 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\nGrieve concluded that \"the possibility of fakery is ruled out if the speed of the film was 16 or 18 frames per second. In these conditions a normal human being could not duplicate the observed pattern, which would suggest that the Sasquatch must possess a very different locomotor system to that of man.\" If filmed at the higher speed, Grieve concluded that the creature \"walked with a gait pattern very similar in most respects to a man walking at high speed\".<ref name=\"Grieve Report\"/>\n\nGrieve stated, \"I can see the muscle masses in the appropriate places ... If it is a fake, it is an extremely clever one.\"<ref>Hunter and Dahinden, 120</ref> Like Krantz, Grieve thought the figure's shoulders were quite broad. Also like Krantz, Grieve thought Patterson's estimate of the figure's height was inaccurate. Grieve concluded the figure in the Patterson film revealed \"an estimated standing height for the subject of not more than {{convert|6|ft|5|in|m|abbr=on}}\". He notes that a tall human is consistent with the figure's height but also notes that for a tall human \"[t]he shoulder breadth however would be difficult to achieve without giving an unnatural appearance to the arm swing and shoulder contours.\"<ref name=\"Grieve Report\"/>\n\nGrieve notes that his \"subjective impressions have oscillated between total acceptance of the Sasquatch based on the grounds that the film would be difficult to fake, to one of irrational rejection based on an emotional response to the possibility that the Sasquatch actually exists. This seems worth stating because others have reacted similarly to the film.\"<ref>cited in Byrne, 157</ref>\n\nKrantz claimed Grieve made errors in his measurements and reference points.<ref>Krantz, 111\u201312</ref> Canadian Bigfoot researcher [[John Willison Green|John Green]] also criticized Grieve's measurements and his reasoning.<ref>Green (1978), 124\u201328</ref>\n\n====M. K. Davis====\nDevelopments in computer technology permitted enhancements of the Patterson\u2013Gimlin films to be made. Bigfoot enthusiast M. K. Davis created a version that removes the shakiness of the camera, permitting the creature to be seen from a more stable perspective.<ref>http://www.bigfootencounters.com/files/mk_davis_pgf.gif</ref> Davis has produced a second stabilized version incorporating enlargements of specific elements that he believes are significant.<ref>http://www.bigfootencounters.com/files/Walkingwithbigfoot.gif</ref> On a YouTube posting, he claims the odds that the film is fake to be \"about zero.\"\n\n===Scientific studies unfavorable to the film===\n\n====Bernard Heuvelmans====\n[[Bernard Heuvelmans]]\u2014a [[zoology|zoologist]] and the so-called \"father of [[cryptozoology]]\"\u2014thought the creature in the Patterson film was a suited human.<ref>Sanderson, 78\u201379</ref><ref name=\"Strange 1997\">{{cite news|last1=Chorvinsky|first1=Mark|author-link=Mark Chorvinsky|title=Some Thoughts About the Patterson Bigfoot Film on its 30th Anniversary|url=http://www.strangemag.com/pattersonfilm30th.html|accessdate=May 20, 2015|work=Strange Magazine|date=October 1997}}</ref><ref>Krantz, 301\u201304</ref> He objected to the film subject's hair-flow pattern as being too uniform; to the hair on the breasts as not being like a primate; to its buttocks as being insufficiently separated; and to its too-calm retreat from the pursuing men.\n\n====John Napier====\nProminent primate expert [[John R. Napier|John Napier]] (one-time director of the [[Smithsonian]]'s Primate Biology Program) was one of the few mainstream scientists not only to critique the Patterson\u2013Gimlin film but also to study then-available Bigfoot evidence in a generally sympathetic manner, in his 1973 book, ''Bigfoot: The Sasquatch and Yeti in Myth and Reality''.\n\nNapier conceded the likelihood of Bigfoot as a real creature, stating, \"I am convinced that Sasquatch exists.\"<ref>Napier, 205\u20142nd printing</ref> But he argued against the film being genuine: \"There is little doubt that the scientific evidence taken collectively points to a hoax of some kind. The creature shown in the film does not stand up well to functional analysis.\"<ref name=\"Napier, 95\">Napier, 95</ref> Napier gives several reasons for his and other's skepticism<ref>Napier, 90\u201394</ref> that are commonly raised, but apparently his main reasons are original with him. First, the length of \"the footprints are totally at variance with its calculated height\".<ref>Napier, 94</ref> Second, the footprints are of the \"hourglass\" type, which he is suspicious of.<ref>Napier, 126</ref> (In response, Barbara Wasson criticized Napier's logic at length.)<ref>Wasson, 72\u201376, 78\u201379</ref>\n\nHe adds, \"I could not see the zipper; and I still can't. There I think we must leave the matter. Perhaps it was a man dressed up in a monkey-skin; if so it was a brilliantly executed hoax and the unknown perpetrator will take his place with the great hoaxers of the world. Perhaps it was the first film of a new type of hominid, quite unknown to science, in which case Roger Patterson deserves to rank with Dubois, the discoverer of ''Pithecanthropus erectus'', or Raymond Dart of Johannesburg, the man who introduced the world to its immediate human ancestor, ''Australopithecus africanus''.\"<ref name=\"Napier, 95\"/>\n\nThe skeptical views of Grieve and Napier are summarized favorably by Kenneth Wylie (and those of Bayanov and Donskoy negatively) in Appendix A of his 1980 book, ''Bigfoot: A Personal Inquiry into a Phenomenon''.<ref>Wylie, ''Bigfoot: A Personal Inquiry into a Phenomenon'', 237\u201342.</ref>\n\n====Esteban Sarmiento====\n[[Esteban Sarmiento]] is a specialist in physical anthropology at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. He has 25 years of experience with great apes in the wild. He writes,<ref>\"Conclusions Reached by Dr. Esteban Sarmiento ... (affiliations follow),\" in Murphy (2009), pp. 94\u201399</ref> \"I did find some inconsistencies in appearance and behavior that might suggest a fake ... but nothing that conclusively shows that this is the case.\"<ref>Murphy (2009), 94</ref> His most original criticism is this: \"The plantar surface of the feet is decidedly pale, but the palm of the hand seems to be dark. There is no mammal I know of in which the plantar sole differs so drastically in color from the palm.\"<ref>Murphy (2009), 95</ref> (But see Meldrum, 170\u201371.) His most controversial statements are these: \"The gluteals, although large, fail to show a humanlike cleft (or crack).\"<ref>Murphy (2009), 96</ref> \"Body proportions: ... In all of the above relative values, bigfoot is well within the human range and differs markedly from any living ape and from the 'australopithecine' fossils.\"<ref>Murphy (2009), 97</ref> (E.g., the IM index is in the normal human range.) And: \"I estimate bigfoot's weight to be between 190 and 240 lbs.\"<ref>Murphy (2009), 98\u201399</ref>\n\n====David J. Daegling and Daniel O. Schmitt====\nWhen anthropologists David J. Daegling of the [[University of Florida]] and Daniel O. Schmitt examined the film, they concluded it was impossible to conclusively determine if the subject in the film is nonhuman, and additionally argued that flaws in the studies by Krantz and others invalidated their claims. Daegling and Schmitt noted problems of uncertainties in the subject and camera positions, camera movement, poor image quality, and artifacts of the subject. They concluded: \"Based on our analysis of gait and problems inherent in estimating subject dimensions, it is our opinion that it is not possible to evaluate the identity of the film subject with any confidence.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Daegling|first1=David J.|last2=Schmitt|first2=Daniel O.|title=Bigfoot's screen test|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|date=May\u2013June 1999|volume=23|issue=3|page=20|url=http://www.bigfootencounters.com/articles/SI_99_daegling.htm|accessdate=June 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\nDaegling has asserted that the creature's odd walk could be replicated: \"Supposed peculiarities of subject speed, stride length, and posture are all reproducible by a human being employing this type of locomotion [a \"compliant gait\"].\"<ref>Daegling, 127</ref>\n\nDaegling notes that in 1967, movie and television [[special effect]]s were primitive compared to the more sophisticated effects in later decades, and allows that if the Patterson film depicts a man in a suit that \"it is not unreasonable to suggest that it is better than some of the tackier monster outfits that got thrown together for television at that time.\"<ref name=\"Daegling, 112\">Daegling, 112</ref>\n\n====Jessica Rose and James Gamble====\nJessica Rose and James Gamble are authors of \"the definitive text on human gait\",<ref>publisher's blurb on Amazon</ref> ''Human Walking''. They operate the Motion and Gait Analysis Lab at [[Stanford University]]. They conducted a high-tech human-replication attempt of \"Patty's\" gait, in cooperation with Jeff Meldrum. Rose was certain their subject had matched Patty's gait, while Gamble was not quite as sure. Meldrum was impressed and acknowledged that \"some aspects\" of the creature's walk had been replicated, but not all. The narrator said, \"even the experts can see the gait test could not replicate all parameters of the gait.\" It was shown in an episode of the [[Discovery Channel]]'s ''[[Best Evidence]]'' series.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Bigfoot |episodelink= |series=Best Evidence |serieslink=Best Evidence |network=[[Discovery Channel]] |airdate= |season= |number=2}}</ref>\n\n====Cliff Crook and Chris Murphy====\nA computerized visual analysis of the video conducted by Cliff Crook, who once devoted rooms to sasquatch memorabilia in his home in Bothell, Washington,<ref name=jan111999 /> and Chris Murphy, a Canadian Bigfoot buff from Vancouver, British Columbia, was released in January 1999 and exposed an object which appeared to be the suit's zip-fastener.<ref name=jan111999 /> Zooming in on four magnified frames of the 16&nbsp;mm footage video exposed what appeared to be tracings of a bell-shaped fastener on the creature's waist area, presumably used to hold a person's suit together.<ref name=jan111999>{{Cite web |url=http://amarillo.com/stories/011199/usn_fake.shtml#.WeU8_oXnu48 |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 16, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017093515/http://amarillo.com/stories/011199/usn_fake.shtml#.WeU8_oXnu48 |archive-date=October 17, 2017 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Since both Crook and Murphy were previously staunch supporters of the video's authenticity,<ref name=jan111999 /> Associated Press journalist John W.

One pair of scientists, Jurgen Konczak (Director, Human Sensorimotor Control Laboratory, University of Minnesota) and [[Esteban Sarmiento]], attempts and fails to get a [[mime]] outfitted with [[LED]]s on his joints to mimic the Patterson Bigfoot's gait. A second pair, [[Daris Swindler]] and Owen Caddy, employs digital enhancement and observes facial movements, such as moving eyelids, lips that compress like an upset chimp's, and a mouth that is lower than it appears, due to a false-lip anomaly like that of a chimp's. (Unfortunately, the show's narrator falsely claims, three times, that the original film shot by Patterson was used.)

For instance, most of Bill Munns' book makes detailed examinations of film features that he argues could not have been created with 1967 special effects technology. He filmed recreation attempts of his own that failed. Daniel Perez wrote, \"If the film is in fact a fake, a costumed man or a machine, surely science could duplicate the film with ease.

But he also argued that Patterson had \"nowhere near the knowledge or facilities to do so\u2014nor for that matter, did anyone else ... When I talked about some of the more technical details of [[biomechanics]], he (Patterson) showed the familiar blank look of a student who had lost the drift of the explanation, but was still trying hard to pay attention.

Oh, yes they can! When you're wearing long clown's feet, you can't place the ball of your foot down first. You have to put your foot down flat. Otherwise, you'll stumble. Another thing, when you put on the gorilla head, you can only turn your head maybe a quarter of the way. And to look behind you, you've got to turn your head and your shoulders and your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are in the way of the jaw. That's why the Bigfoot turns and looks the way he does in the film.

Opal said she saw the suit two days after the film was shot.<ref>Long, 363\u201364</ref>\n*Russ Bohannon, a longtime friend, says that Heironimus revealed the hoax privately in 1968 or 1969.<ref>Long, 414</ref>\n*Bernard Hammermeister, another longtime friend, said he was shown an ape suit in Heironimus' car. No date was given by Long for Hammermeister's observation, but it apparently came well after the relatives' observation, as implied by the word \"still\" in the justification Heironimus gave Hammermeister for requesting his silence: \"There was still supposed to be a [[payola]] on this thing, and he didn't have it.\"<ref>Long, 398</ref>\n\nLong argues that the suit Morris says he sold to Patterson was the same suit Heironimus claims to have worn in the Patterson film. However, Long quotes Heironimus and Morris describing different ape suits in many respects. Among the notable differences are:\n*Suit Material: Horsehide vs. Dynel. Heironimus says he was told by his brother Howard that Patterson claimed he manufactured the suit from [[horsehide]].<ref name=\"Long, 345\">Long, 345</ref> When Long asked how heavy the suit was, Bob replied, \"It weighed maybe twenty, twenty-five pounds. ... Horsehide would be heavy.\"<ref name=\"Long, 345\"/> Bob added, \"It stunk. Roger skinned out a dead, red horse.\"\n\n:But Morris reports that the suit was made of [[Dynel]], a lighter-weight synthetic material with little or no odor. Morris said that it was his \"standard suit that we sold to all our customers\"<ref name=\"Long, 446\"/> that cost $435<ref name=\"Long, 447\"/> (cheaper than the competition).<ref>Long, 445</ref>\n\n:Another contrast is that Howard reported that the horsehide was a \"real dark brown\" and Long writes that Morris \"was using brown Dynel in 1967\".<ref name=\"Long, 449\">Long, 449</ref> But Morris wouldn't have wanted a \"real dark\" brown color, as he chose brown to contrast against the black background of the girl-to-gorilla illusion.<ref name=\"Long, 449\"/>\n*Suit: Top-and-Trousers vs. a Back-Zipped Onesie. Heironimus described the suit as having no metal pieces and an upper \"torso part\" that he donned \"like putting on a T-shirt\".<ref>Long, 344\u201345</ref> At Bluff Creek he put on \"the top\".<ref>Long, 349</ref> Asked about the \"bottom portion,\" he guessed it was cinched with a drawstring.\n\n:But Morris made a one-piece [[union suit]] with a metal zipper up the back.<ref name=\"Long, 449\"/> Presumably one stepped into it first, then wiggled in one's arms; in any event, donning it like a T-shirt would be impossible.\n*Hands & Feet: Suit-Attached vs. Separate. Heironimus described the suit as having hands and feet that were attached to the arms and legs.\n\n:But Morris made a suit whose hands and feet were separate pieces. Long speculates that Patterson riveted or glued these parts to the suit, but offers no evidence to support this idea. If Patterson had done so, he must have done it before Heironimus did his test fitting and walk (because Heironimus describes a three-piece suit\u2014head, torso, and legs, omitting separate hands and feet)\u2014i.e., without adjusting their location to his dimensions. And Heironimus never described being measured beforehand.\n\nLong speculates that Patterson modified the costume, but only by attaching Morris's loose hands and feet to the costume,<ref>His only comments are in items 7 and 12 of \"Q & A\u2014The Making of Bigfoot,\" by Greg Long, April 6, 2004,  where he wrote, \"We know Roger Patterson owned a tool shed and worked in leather, clay, and wood. Modifying the suit parts\u2014such as gluing or riveting the hands to the cuffs of the suit, as well as the feet to the leg cuffs\u2014was well within his skill set.\"</ref> and by replacing Morris's mask.<ref>Long, 459</ref> However, there's nothing he wrote on ''suit'' modification. There's no evidence or testimony that Patterson changed the Morris suit to horsehide, or dyed it a darker color, or cut it in half at the waist to agree with Heironimus's description.\n\nSome film proponents<ref>Murphy (2005), 242\u201343</ref><ref>Murphy (2008), 93</ref><ref>Daegling, 143, paraphrasing Green</ref> say that Heironimus' arms are too short to match that of a Bigfoot and that he was a few inches shorter than the creature on the film (up to 14 inches shorter).<ref>Murphy (2009), 90\u201391</ref>\n\n:But Heironimus said that he wore football shoulder pads,<ref name=\"Long, 448\"/> which might explain why the shoulders and arms appear to be out of proportion to the rest of the body.

The film site is roughly 38 miles south of [[Oregon]] and 18 miles east of the [[Pacific Ocean]].<ref>Murphy (2008), 32</ref> For decades, the exact location of the site was lost, primarily because of re-growth of foliage in the streambed after the flood of 1964.

Patterson died of cancer in 1972 and \"maintained right to the end that the creature on the film was real\".<ref>McLeod, 128\u201329, 140</ref> Patterson's friend, Gimlin, has always denied being involved in any part of a hoax with Patterson. Gimlin mostly avoided publicly discussing the subject from at least the early 1970s until about 2005 (except for three appearances),<ref>In Toronto for Dahinden's book launch in 1973 (McLeod, 173); at the 1978 [[University of British Columbia]] Museum of Anthropology (McLeod, 140) Conference; and on ''[[Arthur C.

If the film was shot at 18 fps, as [[Grover Krantz]] believed,<ref>Krantz, 89, caption</ref> the event lasted 53 seconds.

Sanderson]] in ''[[True (magazine)|True]]'' magazine in December 1959.<ref>Perez, 6</ref> In 1961 Sanderson published his encyclopedic ''Abominable Snowmen: Legend Come to Life,'' a worldwide survey of accounts of Bigfoot-type creatures, including recent track finds, etc. in the Bluff Creek area, which heightened his interest. Thereafter, Marian Place wrote:\n\n{{quote|In 1962 he visited Bluff Creek and talked with a whole host of Bigfoot-believers. In 1964<ref>However, Cliff Barackman's site notes that the year carved in the casts while they were drying is 1963. Cliff contends that the 1964 date in Patterson's book is likely an error. See http://cliffbarackman.com/bigfoot-prints/cast-index/1963-laird-meadow/</ref> he returned and met a timber-cruiser named Pat Graves, who drove him to Laird Meadows.<ref>Murphy (2009) 51, 120, 146, 170; It is mistakenly spelt \"Leard\" in a couple of books</ref> There Patterson saw fresh tracks\u2014for him an almost unbearably exciting, spine-chilling experience. What a tremendous feat it would be\u2014what a scientific breakthrough\u2014if he could obtain unshakable evidence that these tracks were not the work of a prankster, but the actual mark of a hitherto unknown creature! If he succeeded, he would be famous! And rich!\n\nAlas, fame and fortune were not gained that year, nor the next, nor the next. Patterson invested thousands of hours and dollars combing Bigfoot and Sasquatch territory. He fought constant ridicule and a shortage of funds. ... he founded ... the Northwest Research Foundation. Through it he solicited funds . ... The response was encouraging and enabled him to lead several expeditions. ... In 1966 he published a paperback book at his own expense. ... He added the income from its sales and his lectures to the search fund. As each wilderness jaunt failed to see or capture the monster, one by one the thrill-seekers dropped out. But Patterson never gave up.<ref>Marian Place, 135\u201336</ref>}}\n\nPatterson's book, ''Do Abominable Snowmen of America Really Exist?'', was [[self-published]] in 1966. The book has been characterized as \"little more than a collection of newspaper clippings laced together with Patterson's circus-poster style prose\".<ref>Hunter and Dahinden, 113</ref> The book, however, contains 20 pages of previously unpublished interviews and letters, 17 drawings by Patterson of the encounters described in the text, 5 hand-drawn maps (rare in subsequent Bigfoot books), and almost 20 photos and illustrations from other sources.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} It was first reprinted in 1996 by Chris Murphy,<ref>(under his publishing company, Pyramid Productions) in a very limited number (approximately 200, according to Murphy)</ref> and then again re-issued by Murphy<ref>under [[Hancock House Publishers|Hancock House]] Publishing</ref> in 2005 under the title ''The Bigfoot Film Controversy,'' with 81 pages of additional material by Murphy.\n\nIn May/June 1967 Patterson began filming a [[docudrama]] or [[pseudo-documentary]] about cowboys being led by an old miner and a wise Indian [[tracking (hunting)|tracker]] on a hunt for Bigfoot. The storyline called for Patterson, his Indian guide (Gimlin in a wig), and the cowboys to recall in flashbacks the stories of Fred Beck (of the 1924 [[Ape Canyon]] incident) and others as they tracked the beast on horseback. For actors and cameraman, Patterson used at least nine volunteer acquaintances, including Gimlin and Bob Heironimus, for three days of shooting, perhaps over the Memorial Day weekend.<ref>Long, 39, 109\u201310, 115, 228\u201329</ref><ref>This is the only stretch in that period that all the men would have had 3 free days.</ref> Patterson would have needed a costume to represent Bigfoot, if the time came to shoot such climactic scenes.\n\nPrior to the October 1967 filming, Patterson apparently visited [[Los Angeles]] on these occasions:\n*Roger drove to [[Hollywood]] in 1964 and visited rockabilly songwriter and guitarist Jerry Lee Merritt, a [[Yakima, Washington|Yakima]] native who was living there in Hollywood then.<ref>Long, 132</ref><ref>Patterson and Murphy, 15</ref> He was trying to sell his hoop-toy invention.<ref>Long, 176\u201377; Al Hodgson remembers that this was his mission on \"the first time I met him [1964]\" on his way south.</ref><ref>McLeod, 79</ref>\n*In 1966 he visited Merritt again while he was still trying to sell his hoop-toy invention.<ref>Long, 107, 126</ref> \nMerritt soon moved back to Yakima and became Patterson's neighbor, and later his collaborator on his Bigfoot documentary.<ref>Long, 99; see also Long, 100\u201333 and 312</ref> \n*Later in 1966 he and Merritt drove down there for several purposes. Patterson visited cowboy film star [[Roy Rogers]] for help.<ref>Long, 73, 91, 230</ref> He tried to sell his ponies-and-wagon to [[Disneyland]] or [[Knott's Berry Farm]].<ref>Long, 230</ref> \n*In the summer of 1967, apparently after getting $700 from the Radfords and shooting some of his documentary, they tried unsuccessfully to attract investors to help further fund his Bigfoot movie.<ref>Long, 110\u201311, 114, 130</ref> They copyrighted or trademarked the term \"Bigfoot\".<ref>Long, 127, 140</ref>\n\nBoth Patterson <ref>Long, 90. (This citation does not cover this entire sentence.)</ref> and Gimlin had been rodeo riders and amateur boxers\u2014and local champions in their weight classes. Patterson had played high school football.\n\nIn October 1967, Patterson and his friend Gimlin set out for the [[Six Rivers National Forest]] in far [[Northern California]]. They drove in Gimlin's truck, carrying his provisions and three horses, positioned sideways. Patterson chose the area because of intermittent reports of the creatures in the past, and of their enormous footprints since 1958. (His familiarity with the area and its residents from prior visits may also have been a factor.)\n\nThe most recent of these reports was the nearby Blue Creek Mountain track find, which was investigated by journalist [[John Willison Green|John Green]], Bigfoot hunter [[Ren\u00e9 Dahinden]], and archaeologist Don Abbott on and after August 28, 1967.<ref>Perez, 8</ref> This find was reported to Patterson (via his wife) soon thereafter by Al Hodgson, owner of the Willow Creek [[Variety Store]].<ref>Byrne, 138</ref><ref>Jevning, ''Notes from the Field: Tracking North America's Sasquatch,'' 105, quoting Hodgson in an interview. Later, Hodgson said, he \"branched out\" into selling, e.g., clothing (and the \"variety store\" designation was dropped).</ref>\n\nThough Gimlin says he doubted the existence of Sasquatch-like creatures, he agreed to Patterson's insistence that they should not attempt to shoot one.<ref>Daegling, 115</ref>\n\n==Encounter==\nAs their stories went, in the early afternoon of Friday, October 20, 1967, Patterson and Gimlin were riding generally northeast (upstream) on horseback along the east bank of Bluff Creek. At sometime between 1:15 and 1:40 PM, they \"came to an overturned tree with a large root system at a turn in the creek, almost as high as a room\".<ref>Perez, 9, 20</ref><ref>Gimlin, quoted in Perez, 9</ref>\n\nWhen they rounded it, \"there was a logjam\u2014a 'crow's nest'\u2014left over from the flood of '64,\" and then they spotted the figure behind it nearly simultaneously. It was either \"crouching beside the creek to their left\" or \"standing\" there, on the opposite bank. Gimlin later described himself as in a mild state of shock after first seeing the figure.<ref name=\"Meldrum, 139\">Meldrum, 139</ref><ref name=\"Krantz, 87\">Krantz, 87</ref><ref name=\"Meldrum, 139\"/>\n\nPatterson initially estimated its height at {{convert|6|ft|6|in}} to {{convert|7|ft}},<ref>Patterson & Murphy, 195</ref> and later raised his estimate to about {{convert|7|ft|6|in}}. Some later analysts, anthropologist [[Grover Krantz]] among them, have suggested Patterson's later estimate was about {{convert|1|ft}} too tall. Gimlin's estimate was {{convert|6|ft}}.\n\nThe film shows what Patterson and Gimlin claimed was a large, hairy, [[bipedalism|bipedal]], apelike figure with short, \"silvery brown\"<ref>Patterson and Murphy, 195</ref> or \"dark reddish-brown\"<ref>Napier, 90</ref> or \"black\"<ref>Sanderson (1969), 66</ref> hair covering most of its body, including its prominent breasts. The figure in the film generally matches the descriptions of Bigfoot offered by others who claim to have seen one.\n\nPatterson estimated he was about {{Convert|25|ft}} away from the creature at his closest. Patterson said that his horse reared upon sensing the figure, and he spent about 20 seconds extricating himself from the saddle, controlling his horse, getting around to its other side,<ref>Perez, 9</ref> and getting his camera from a saddlebag before he could run toward the figure while operating his camera. He yelled \"Cover me\" to Gimlin, \"meaning to get the gun out\".<ref name=\"Perez, 10\">Perez, 10</ref> Gimlin crossed the creek on horseback after Patterson had run well beyond it, riding on a path somewhat to the left of Patterson's and somewhat beyond his position. Perez estimates he came within {{convert|60\u201390|ft}} of \"Patty\".<ref name=\"Perez, 10\"/> Then, rifle in hand, he dismounted, but did not point his rifle at the creature.<ref>Meldrum, 140</ref>\n\nThe figure had walked away from them to a distance of about {{convert|120|ft}} before Patterson began to run after it. The resulting film (about 59.5 seconds long at 16 fps) is initially quite shaky until Patterson got about {{convert|80|ft}} from the figure. At that point, the figure glanced over its right shoulder at the men and Patterson fell to his knees; on Krantz's map this corresponds to frame 264.<ref name=\"Perez, 12\">Perez, 12</ref> To researcher [[John Willison Green|John Green]], Patterson would later characterize the creature's expression as one of \"contempt and disgust ... you know how it is when the umpire tells you 'one more word and you're out of the game.' That's the way it felt.\"\n\nShortly after this point the steady, middle portion of the film begins, containing the famous look-back frame 352. Patterson said, \"it turned a total of I think three times,\"<ref>Wasson, 69</ref> the other times therefore being before the filming began and/or while he was running with his finger off the trigger. Shortly after glancing over its shoulder on film, the creature disappeared behind a grove of trees for 14 seconds, then reappeared in the film's final 15 seconds after Patterson moved {{convert|10|ft}} to a better vantage point, fading into the trees again and being lost to view at a distance of {{convert|265|ft}} as the reel of film ran out.<ref>Krantz, 89\u201390</ref>\n\nGimlin remounted and followed it on horseback, keeping his distance, until it disappeared around a bend in the road three hundred yards away. Patterson called him back at that point, feeling vulnerable on foot without a rifle, because he feared the creature's mate might approach. The entire encounter had lasted less than two minutes.\n\nNext, Gimlin and Patterson rounded up Patterson's horses, which had run off in the opposite direction, downstream, before the filming began. Patterson got his second roll of film from his saddlebag and filmed the tracks.<ref>Wylie, 12</ref> Then the men tracked \"Patty\" for either one mile<ref name=\"Perez, 12\"/> or {{Convert|3|mi|spell=in}},<ref>Sanderson (1969), 68; Sanderson might have mixed up this with the three-mile distance they traveled back to the campsite.</ref> but \"lost it in the heavy undergrowth\".<ref>Coleman and Clark, 198</ref> They went to their campsite three miles south, picked up plaster, returned to the initial site, measured the creature's step-length, and made two [[plaster cast]]s, one each of the best-quality right and left prints.\n\n===Details===\n\nAccording to Patterson and Gimlin, they were the only witnesses to their brief encounter with what they claimed was a sasquatch. Their statements agree in general, but author Greg Long notes a number of inconsistencies. They offered somewhat different sequences in describing how they and the horses reacted upon seeing the creature. Patterson in particular increased his estimates of the creature's size in subsequent retellings of the encounter.<ref>Long, 162\u201365</ref> In a different context, Long argues, these discrepancies would probably be considered minor, but given the extraordinary claims made by Patterson and Gimlin, any apparent disagreements in perception or memory are worth noting.\n\nThe film's defenders have responded by saying that commercially motivated hoaxers would have \"got their stories straight\" beforehand so they wouldn't have disagreed immediately upon being interviewed, and on so many points, and so they wouldn't have created a suit and a creature with foreseeably objectionable features and behaviors.<ref>For instance, see \"How Not to Plan a Hoaxed Filming,\" ''Bigfoot Times'', March 2004.</ref>\n\nA more serious objection concerns the film's \"timeline\". This is important because Kodachrome II movie film, as far as is known, could only be developed by a lab containing a $60,000+ machine, and the few West Coast labs known to possess one did not do developing over weekends. Patterson's brother-in-law Al DeAtley claims not to remember where he took the film for development or where he picked it up.<ref>Long, 252\u201354</ref>\n\nCritics claim that too much happened between the filming (at 1:15 at the earliest) and the filmmakers' arrival in Willow Creek (at 6:30 at the latest). Daegling wrote, \"All of the problems with the timeline disappear if the film is shot a few days or hours beforehand. If that is the case, one has to wonder what other details of this story are wrong.\"<ref>Daegling, ''Bigfoot Exposed'', 147\u201349.</ref><ref>McLeod, ''Anatomy of a Beast'', 79\u201382.</ref> The film's defenders retort that although the time window was tight, it was do-able.<ref>Perez, ''Bigfoot Times'',</ref>\n\nChris Murphy wrote, \"I have confirmed with Bob Gimlin that Patterson definitely rode a small quarter horse (which he owned), not his Welsh pony 'Peanuts'. Also, that Patterson had arranged to borrow a horse by the name of 'Chico' from Bob Heironimus for Gimlin to use ... Gimlin did not have a horse that was suitable (old enough) for the expedition.\"<ref>Murphy (2008), 39</ref> Heironimus stated that Chico (a middle-aged gelding) \"wouldn't jump or buck ...\"<ref>Long, 347</ref>\n\n==Immediate aftermath==\n\nAt approximately 6:30 PM,<ref>McLeod, 79, quoting Hodgson in an interview with him</ref> Patterson and Gimlin met up with Al Hodgson at his [[variety store]] in [[Willow Creek, California|Willow Creek]], approximately 54.3 miles south by road, about 28.8 miles by Bluff Creek Road from their camp to the 1967 roadhead by Bluff Creek, and 25.5 miles down [[California State Route 96]] to Willow Creek. Patterson intended to drive on to [[Eureka, California|Eureka]] to ship his film. Either at that time, or when he arrived in the Eureka/[[Arcata, California|Arcata]] area, he called Al DeAtley (his brother-in-law in Yakima) and told him to expect the film he was shipping. He requested Hodgson to call Donald Abbott,<ref>Murphy, ''Bigfoot Film Journal'', 34\u201335</ref> whom [[Grover Krantz]] described as \"the only scientist of any stature to have demonstrated any serious interest in the [Bigfoot] subject,\" hoping he would help them search for the creature by bringing a tracking dog.<ref>Murphy, ''Bigfoot Film Journal'', 34, 39</ref> Hodgson called, but Abbott declined. Krantz argued that this call the same day of the encounter is evidence against a hoax, at least on Patterson's part.<ref>Krantz, 122</ref>\n\nAfter shipping the film, they headed back toward their camp, where they had left their horses. On their way they \"stopped at the Lower Trinity Ranger Station, as planned, arriving about 9:00 p.m. Here they met with Syl McCoy [another friend] and Al Hodgson.\"<ref name=\"Murphy, Bigfoot Film Journal, p 35\">Murphy, ''Bigfoot Film Journal'', p 35</ref> At this point Patterson called the daily ''[[Times-Standard]]'' newspaper in Eureka and related his story.<ref>Murphy (2008), 40</ref> They arrived back at their campsite at about midnight. At either 5<ref>Perez, 14</ref> or 5:30<ref>Murphy (2008), 35</ref> the next morning, after it started to rain heavily, Gimlin returned to the filmsite from the camp and covered the other prints with bark to protect them. The cardboard boxes he had been given by Al Hodgson for this purpose and had left outside were so soggy they were useless, so he left them.<ref name=\"Murphy, Bigfoot Film Journal, p 35\"/><ref>Meldrum, 145</ref>\n\nWhen he returned to the camp he and Patterson aborted their plan to remain looking for more evidence and departed for home, fearing the rain would wash out their exit. After attempting to go out along \"the low road\"\u2014Bluff Creek Road\u2014and finding it blocked by a mudslide,<ref>Bob Gimlin's talk at the Lake Chautauqua (NY) conference, April 28, 2013; transcribed by Todd Prescott</ref> they went instead up the steep Onion Mountain Road, off whose [[shoulder (road)|shoulder]] their truck slipped; extracting it required the (unauthorized) borrowing of a nearby [[front-end loader]]. The drive home from their campsite covered about 580 miles, the initial 28.8 miles on a low-speed logging road, and then about 110 miles on twisty Route 96. Driving a truck with three horses, and allowing for occasional stops, it would have taken 13 hours to get home Saturday evening, at an average speed of 45&nbsp;mph; it would have taken 14.5 hours at a 40&nbsp;mph average speed.\n\nUS Forest Service \"Timber Management Assistant\"<ref name=\"Perez, 22\">Perez, 22</ref> Lyle Laverty said, \"I [and his team of three, in a [[Jeep]]] passed the site on either Thursday the 19th or Friday the 20th\"<ref>''Bigfoot Times'' newsletter, Sept. 2006, p. 1</ref> and noticed no tracks. After reading the news of Patterson's encounter on their weekend break, Laverty and his team returned to the site on Monday, the 23rd, and made six photos of the tracks. (Laverty later served as an Assistant [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] under [[George W. Bush]].) [[Taxidermist]] and outdoorsman Robert Titmus went to the site with his sister and brother-in-law nine days later.<ref>Green (1978), 119\u201323, writes, quoting Titmus: \"Aline was a skeptic and Harry a hard-headed non-believer. Both of them left there believing. ... Harry has hunted [[big-game hunting|big game]] all of his life. ... \" (p. 123)</ref> Titmus made [[plaster casts]] of ten successive prints<ref>Murphy (2008), 33</ref> of the creature and, as best he could, plotted Patterson's and the creature's movements on a map.<ref>Titmus is profiled in Chris Murphy's ''Know the Sasquatch'', pages 225\u201326, and in Coleman and Clark's ''Cryptozoology A to Z'', pages 239\u201340.</ref>\n\n==Long-term aftermath==\n\n===Film-related===\n[[File:Bigfoot Museum Willow Creek.jpg|thumb|The \"Bigfoot Museum\" in [[Willow Creek, California]]]]\n[[Grover Krantz]] writes that \"Patterson had the film developed as soon as possible. At first he thought he had brought in proof of [[Bigfoot]]'s existence and really expected the scientists to accept it. But only a few scientists were willing to even look at the film,\"<ref>Krantz, 91</ref> usually at showings at [[scientific organization]]s. These were usually arranged at the behest of zoologist, author, and media figure [[Ivan Sanderson]], a supporter of Patterson's film.<ref name=\"Regal, 129\"/> Seven showings occurred, in Vancouver, [[Manhattan]],<ref>Regal, 105\u201306</ref> [[The Bronx]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Atlanta]], and Washington, D.C. again (all by the end of 1968); then, later, in [[Beaverton, Oregon]].

He visited England, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland and Russia. Although scientists in these countries were somewhat more open-minded than those in North America, their findings were basically the same . ...

He made a deal with the [[BBC]], allowing the use of his footage in a [[docudrama]] made in return for letting him tour with their docudrama, into which he melded material from his own documentary and additional material he and Al DeAtley filmed.<ref>Long, 111, 248, 261\u201362</ref> This film was shown in local movie houses around the [[Pacific Northwest]] and [[Midwest]].<ref>Long, 263\u201364</ref><ref>McLeod, 118</ref> A technique commonly used for [[nature film]]s called \"[[Four wall distribution|four-walling]]\" was employed, involving heavy local advertising, mostly on TV, of a few days of showings.<ref>Long, 263</ref> It was a modest financial success.

And Roger didn't get his share of it. ... Roger told me, and several other people too, you know, that I trust.\" (Long, 206) And Bigfoot-book author [[Michael McLeod (author)|Michael McLeod]] concluded similarly. (McLeod, 112:  \"A lot of money was coming in (DeAtley has admitted to personally making several hundred thousand dollars from the film), but people close to the action agree that an awful lot was also going out. Whatever money filtered down to Roger Patterson wasn't near enough.\")</ref>\n\nThe film generated a fair amount of national publicity. Patterson appeared on a few popular TV [[talk show]]s to promote the film and belief in Bigfoot by showing excerpts from it: for instance, on the ''[[Joe Pyne]] Show'' in Los Angeles, in 1967, which covered most of the western US;<ref>Long, 203</ref> on [[Merv Griffin]]'s program, with [[Grover Krantz|Krantz]] offering his analysis of the film; on [[Joey Bishop]]'s talk show,<ref>Long, 258</ref> and also on [[Johnny Carson]]'s ''[[Tonight Show]]''.<ref>M.

The show attracted fifty million viewers. In 1975, [[Sunn Classic Pictures]] released \"Bigfoot: The Mysterious Monster\" aka \"The Mysterious Monsters\", which remixed parts of \"Monsters!

His Cine-Kodak K-100 camera had markings on its continuously variable dial at 16, 24, 32, 48, and 64 frames per second, but no click-stops, and was capable of filming at any frame speed within this range. [[Grover Krantz]] wrote, \"Patterson clearly told [[John Willison Green|John Green]] that he found, after the filming, that the camera was set on 18 frames per second (fps). ... \"<ref>Krantz, 306</ref><ref>Green (1978), 126</ref> It has been suggested that Patterson simply misread \"16\" as \"18\".\n\n*\"Dr. D.W. Grieve, an anatomist with expertise in human biomechanics ... evaluated the various possibilities\" regarding film speed and did not come to a conclusion between them. He \"confessed to being perplexed and unsettled\" by \"the tangible possibility that it [the film subject] was real\".<ref>Daegling, 109\u201311</ref>\n*[[John Napier (primatologist)|John Napier]], a primatologist, claimed that \"if the movie was filmed at 24 frame/s then the creature's walk cannot be distinguished from a normal human walk. If it was filmed at 16 or 18 frame/s, there are a number of important respects in which it is quite unlike man's gait.\"<ref name=\"Napier, 94, 2nd printing\">Napier, 94 [2nd printing]</ref> Napier, who published before Dahinden and Krantz,<ref>Bayanov, 70</ref> contended it was \"likely that Patterson would have used 24 frame/s\" because it \"is best suited to TV transmission,\" while conceding that \"this is entirely speculative.\"<ref name=\"Napier, 94, 2nd printing\"/><ref>Regal, 120, writes: \"Krantz also found a copy of the camera's manual. It states, 'For normal screen action, when using a silent projector, use the 16 frames per second speed.'\"</ref>\n*[[Grover Krantz|Krantz]] argued, on the basis of an analysis by Igor Bourtsev, that since Patterson's height is known (5'2\" or 5'3\"), a reasonable calculation can be made of his pace. This running pace can be synchronized with the regular bounces in the initial jumpy portions of the film that were caused by each fast step Patterson took to approach the creature. On the basis of this analysis, Krantz argued that a speed of 24 frames per second can be quickly dismissed and that \"[we] may safely rule out 16 frames per second and accept the speed of 18.\"<ref>Krantz, 96</ref>\n*[[Ren\u00e9 Dahinden]] stated that \"the footage of the horses prior to the Bigfoot film looks jerky and unnatural when projected at 24 frame/s.\"<ref name=\"Perez, 21\">Perez, 21</ref> And Dahinden experimented at the film site by having people walk rapidly over the creature's path and reported: \"None of us ... could walk that distance in 40 seconds [952 frames / 24 frame/s = 39.6 s], ... so I eliminated 24 frame/s.\"<ref name=\"Perez, 21\"/>\n*Bill Munns wrote, \"One researcher, Bill Miller, found technical data from a [[Kodak]] technician that stated the K-100 cameras were tweaked so even when the dial is set to 16 fps, the camera actually runs at 18 fps. ... I have nine K-100 cameras now. ... I tried it on one camera, and got 18 fps, but the rest still need testing [and all with \"film running through the camera\"].\"<ref>Munns, 326\u201327</ref>\n\n==Analysis==\nThe Patterson\u2013Gimlin film has seen relatively little interest from mainstream scientists. Statements of scientists who viewed the film at a screening, or who conducted a study, are reprinted in Chris Murphy's ''Bigfoot Film Journal''.<ref>Murphy (2008), 59\u201366, 72\u201382</ref> Typical objections include: Neither humans nor chimpanzees have hairy breasts as does the figure in the film, and Napier has noted that a [[sagittal crest]] is \"only very occasionally seen, to an insignificant extent, in chimpanzees {{sic}} females\".<ref>Cited in Wasson, 74</ref> Critics have argued these features are evidence against authenticity. Krantz countered the latter point, saying \"a sagittal crest ... is a consequence of absolute size alone.\"<ref>Krantz, 304</ref>\n\nAs anthropologist [[David Daegling]] writes, \"[t]he skeptics have not felt compelled to offer much of a detailed argument against the film; the burden of proof, rightly enough, should lie with the advocates.\" Yet, without a detailed argument against authenticity, Daegling notes that \"the film has not gone away.\"<ref>Daegling, 119</ref> Similarly, [[Grover Krantz|Krantz]] argues that of the many opinions offered about the Patterson film, \"[o]nly a few of these opinions are based on technical expertise and careful study of the film itself.\"<ref name=\"Krantz, 92\">Krantz, 92</ref>\n\nRegarding the quality of the film, second-generation copies or copies from TV and DVD productions are inferior to first-generation copies. Many early frames are blurry due to camera shake, and the quality of subsequent frames varies for the same reason. Stabilization of the film (e.g., by M. K. Davis) to counter the effect of camera shake has improved viewers' ability to analyze it. Regarding \"graininess,\" Bill Munns writes, \"Based on transparencies taken off the camera original, ... the PGF original is as fine grain as any color 16mm film can achieve.\" He adds that graininess increases as images are magnified.<ref>Munns, 366\u201370</ref>\n\n===Scientific studies favorable to the film===\n\n====Bayanov et al.====\nDimitri Bayanov, Igor Bourtsev, and [[Ren\u00e9 Dahinden]] authored \"Analysis of the Patterson\u2013Gimlin Film, Why We Find It Authentic\". It is a study with sections examining the technical characteristics of the footage, the filming speed, the morphology of the creature, and the specimen's movements. It ended with an assessment and a conclusion favorable to the film subject's reality.<ref>In Markotic and Krantz, eds. (1984), 219\u201333</ref><ref>''America's Bigfoot: Fact, Not Fiction'', Bayanov</ref> The most notable sentences are these: \"[Sculptor Nikita Lavinsky argues that] the better a costume from the anatomical point of view, the worse it would be from the viewpoint of biomechanics. A clever costume on a moving hoaxer would ''expose, not conceal'' a fraud.\"<ref>Markotic and Krantz, 231</ref> Later, Bayanov \"felt the North American monster enthusiasts did not pursue the [PGF] issues with enough vigor\" and more funding from the ISC.<ref>Regal, 155</ref>\n\n====Dmitri Donskoy====\nA formal academic study of the Patterson film was conducted by Dmitri Donskoy, Chief of the Dept. of Biomechanics at the USSR Central Institute of Physical Culture, and later associated with [[Moscow]]'s Darwin Museum.<ref>Daegling, 45</ref><ref>Reprinted in Murphy (2004), 74\u201376</ref><ref>Reprinted in Murphy (2009), 84\u201385</ref><ref>Reprinted in Byrne, 164\u201365</ref>\n\nDonskoy concluded the creature was non-human on the basis of its weight, and especially its gait, which Donskoy judged would be difficult, if not impossible, for a human to replicate. He inferred the film's subject was weighty from the ponderous momentum he observed in the movements of its arms and legs, in the sagging of the knee as weight came onto it, and in the flatness of the foot. Its gait he considered non-artificial because it was confident and unwavering, \"neatly expressive,\" and well-coordinated\u2014and yet non-human because its arm motion and glide resembled a cross-country skier's. Krantz describes Donskoy's conclusion as being that the film depicts \"a very massive animal that is definitely not a human being\".<ref name=\"Krantz, 92\"/>\n\n====Reuben Steindorf====\nJeff Meldrum wrote, \"Animator and computer-generated effects expert Reuben Steindorf, of Vision Realm, created a computer model of 'Patty,' as the film subject has been nicknamed. ... Steindorf reconstructed Patty's skeletal anatomy from the ground up, using 'reverse kinematics.'\"<ref>Meldrum, 172</ref> Among other findings, \"Steindorf confirmed ... that the upper extremity was rather long compared to the lower. This ratio can be expressed as an intermembral index (IM). ... The intermembral index for the film subject was approximately 88. ... An average human IM is 71.\"<ref>Meldrum, 174</ref>\n\n====Gordon Strasenburgh====\nGordon Strasenburgh authored \"The Crested Australopithecus Robustus and the Patterson\u2013Gimlin Film\". After an introduction, it reviews four other studies and opinions by scientists on the film, then goes on with the following sections: Testing Hypotheses, Anthropological Attitudes, Alternatives to ''A. robustus'', The Basic Problem, and Conclusion. The last section begins, \"The Patterson\u2013Gimlin film and its analytical results to date are the best data.\"<ref>in Markotic and Krantz, eds.

He was unable to find evidence of fakery, but noted several indications of authenticity. His conclusions are summed up on one page in two of Christopher Murphy's books.<ref name=\"Murphy 2004, 80\"/><ref>Murphy (2009), 90</ref> Background information on Glickman's project, sponsored by his \"North American Science Institute\" (NASI), can be found in another of Murphy's books.<ref>Murphy (2008), 83\u201385</ref>\n\n====Grover Krantz====\nAnthropologist [[Grover Krantz]] was originally skeptical of the Patterson film, based on the still photos in [[Argosy Magazine]], but changed his mind in 1969 after seeing the film because \"the realism of the creature's locomotion impressed him.\"<ref>Regal, 87\u201388</ref> He later offered an in-depth examination of the Patterson film.<ref>Krantz, 88\u2013124</ref> He concluded that the film depicts a genuine unknown creature. Primarily, Krantz's argument is based on a detailed analysis of the figure's stride, [[center of gravity]], and biomechanics. Krantz argues that the creature's leg and foot motions are quite different from a human's and could not have been duplicated by a person wearing a [[gorilla suit]].<ref>Krantz, 111\u201316</ref> Krantz wrote, \"the knee is regularly bent more than 90\u00b0, while the human leg bends less than 70\u00b0.\" Daniel Perez brought out the implication of this, writing, \"The subject['s] ... toes lift off the soil at least ten inches in every walking cycle. ... Ren\u00e9 Dahinden ... filmed and studied how modern man walks, finding ... a maximum of 2\u20133 inches of distance between toes and the surface it is walking over. ... \"<ref name=\"Perez, 22\"/> No human has yet replicated this 10-inch-high lower leg lift while maintaining the smoothness, posture, and stride length (41\") of the creature.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nKrantz pointed out the tremendous width of the creature's shoulders, which (after deducting 1\" for hair) he estimated at 28.2&nbsp;inches, or 35.1% of its full standing height of 78\", or a higher percentage of its 72-inch \"walking height,\" which was a bit stooped, crouched, and sunk into the sand.<ref>Krantz, 106\u201308</ref> The creature's shoulders are almost 50% wider than the human mean. (For comparison, [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] had a typical human ratio of 24%. Wide-shouldered Bob Heironimus (see below) has 27.4%. Only very rarely do humans have a shoulder breadth of 30%.) Krantz argued that a suited person could not mimic this breadth and still have the naturalistic hand and arm motions present on the film.\n\nKrantz and others have noted natural-looking [[muscle|musculature]] visible as the creature moved, arguing this would be highly difficult or impossible to fake. Hunter and Dahinden also note that \"the bottom of the figure's head seems to become part of the heavy back and shoulder muscles ... [and] the muscles of the buttocks were distinct.\"<ref>Hunter and Dahinden, 114</ref>\n\n====Jeffrey Meldrum====\n[[D. Jeffrey Meldrum|Jeffrey Meldrum]] of [[Idaho State University]] cites efforts by [[John Willison Green|John Green]] as important in his own studies of the Patterson film. \"It has been obvious to even the casual viewer that the film subject possesses arms that are disproportionately long for its stature.\" Meldrum writes that \"Anthropologists typically express limb proportions as an [[intermembral index]] (IM)\" and notes that humans have an average IM index of 72, gorillas an average IM index of 117 and chimpanzees an average IM index of 106.<ref name=\"Meldrum BFRO\">{{cite web|last1=Meldrum|first1=Jeffrey|title=The Truth Before our Eyes|url=http://www.bfro.net/news/challenge/green.asp|publisher=BFRO|accessdate=April 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn determining an IM index for the figure in the Patterson film, Meldrum concludes the figure has \"an IM index somewhere between 80 and 90, intermediate between humans and African apes. In spite of the imprecision of this preliminary estimate, it is well beyond the mean for humans and effectively rules out a man-in-a-suit explanation for the Patterson\u2013Gimlin film without invoking an elaborate, if not inconceivable, prosthetic contrivance to account for the appropriate positions and actions of wrist and elbow and finger [[flexion]] visible on the film. This point deserves further examination and may well rule out the probability of hoaxing.\"<ref name=\"Meldrum BFRO\"/>\n\nIn his book, Meldrum says, \"[Reuben] Steindorf tracked the joint centers through 116 frames of the film, yielding a reliable estimate of the film subject's limb proportions. ... The combination of these proportions with the exceptional breadth dimensions argue[s] compellingly against the simplistic hypothesis of an average man, even one wearing shoulder pads ... or using artificial arm extensions.\"<ref>Meldrum, 174; see also 180</ref>\n\nHowever, scientist [[Esteban Sarmiento]] (see below) disagrees that the subject has a non-human IMI.\n\nDr. Scott Lynn, Associate Professor of Kinesiology, California State University, was another scientist who reached a favorable conclusion.<ref>He appeared on the TV series ''American Paranormal'', Season 1, Episode 3, \"Bigfoot,\" 13 June 2010</ref>\n\n====D. W. Grieve====\nAnatomist D. W. Grieve of the [[Royal Free Hospital]] School of Medicine studied a copy of the film in 1971, and wrote a detailed analysis.<ref>Reprinted in Murphy (2004), 76\u201379</ref><ref>Reprinted in Murphy (2009), 86\u201389</ref><ref>Reprinted in Byrne, 152\u201357</ref> He notes, \"The possibility of a very clever fake cannot be ruled out on the evidence of the film\" but also writes that his analysis hinges largely on the question of filming speed.<ref name=\"Grieve Report\">{{cite web|last1=Grieve|first1=D. W.|title=Report on the Film of a Supposed Sasquatch|url=http://www.bigfoot-lives.com/html/report_on_the_film_of_a_suppos.html|publisher=Bigfoot-lives.com|accessdate=April 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\nGrieve concluded that \"the possibility of fakery is ruled out if the speed of the film was 16 or 18 frames per second. In these conditions a normal human being could not duplicate the observed pattern, which would suggest that the Sasquatch must possess a very different locomotor system to that of man.\" If filmed at the higher speed, Grieve concluded that the creature \"walked with a gait pattern very similar in most respects to a man walking at high speed\".<ref name=\"Grieve Report\"/>\n\nGrieve stated, \"I can see the muscle masses in the appropriate places ... If it is a fake, it is an extremely clever one.\"<ref>Hunter and Dahinden, 120</ref> Like Krantz, Grieve thought the figure's shoulders were quite broad. Also like Krantz, Grieve thought Patterson's estimate of the figure's height was inaccurate. Grieve concluded the figure in the Patterson film revealed \"an estimated standing height for the subject of not more than {{convert|6|ft|5|in|m|abbr=on}}\". He notes that a tall human is consistent with the figure's height but also notes that for a tall human \"[t]he shoulder breadth however would be difficult to achieve without giving an unnatural appearance to the arm swing and shoulder contours.\"<ref name=\"Grieve Report\"/>\n\nGrieve notes that his \"subjective impressions have oscillated between total acceptance of the Sasquatch based on the grounds that the film would be difficult to fake, to one of irrational rejection based on an emotional response to the possibility that the Sasquatch actually exists. This seems worth stating because others have reacted similarly to the film.\"<ref>cited in Byrne, 157</ref>\n\nKrantz claimed Grieve made errors in his measurements and reference points.<ref>Krantz, 111\u201312</ref> Canadian Bigfoot researcher [[John Willison Green|John Green]] also criticized Grieve's measurements and his reasoning.<ref>Green (1978), 124\u201328</ref>\n\n====M. K. Davis====\nDevelopments in computer technology permitted enhancements of the Patterson\u2013Gimlin films to be made. Bigfoot enthusiast M. K. Davis created a version that removes the shakiness of the camera, permitting the creature to be seen from a more stable perspective.<ref>http://www.bigfootencounters.com/files/mk_davis_pgf.gif</ref> Davis has produced a second stabilized version incorporating enlargements of specific elements that he believes are significant.<ref>http://www.bigfootencounters.com/files/Walkingwithbigfoot.gif</ref> On a YouTube posting, he claims the odds that the film is fake to be \"about zero.\"\n\n===Scientific studies unfavorable to the film===\n\n====Bernard Heuvelmans====\n[[Bernard Heuvelmans]]\u2014a [[zoology|zoologist]] and the so-called \"father of [[cryptozoology]]\"\u2014thought the creature in the Patterson film was a suited human.<ref>Sanderson, 78\u201379</ref><ref name=\"Strange 1997\">{{cite news|last1=Chorvinsky|first1=Mark|author-link=Mark Chorvinsky|title=Some Thoughts About the Patterson Bigfoot Film on its 30th Anniversary|url=http://www.strangemag.com/pattersonfilm30th.html|accessdate=May 20, 2015|work=Strange Magazine|date=October 1997}}</ref><ref>Krantz, 301\u201304</ref> He objected to the film subject's hair-flow pattern as being too uniform; to the hair on the breasts as not being like a primate; to its buttocks as being insufficiently separated; and to its too-calm retreat from the pursuing men.\n\n====John Napier====\nProminent primate expert [[John R. Napier|John Napier]] (one-time director of the [[Smithsonian]]'s Primate Biology Program) was one of the few mainstream scientists not only to critique the Patterson\u2013Gimlin film but also to study then-available Bigfoot evidence in a generally sympathetic manner, in his 1973 book, ''Bigfoot: The Sasquatch and Yeti in Myth and Reality''.\n\nNapier conceded the likelihood of Bigfoot as a real creature, stating, \"I am convinced that Sasquatch exists.\"<ref>Napier, 205\u20142nd printing</ref> But he argued against the film being genuine: \"There is little doubt that the scientific evidence taken collectively points to a hoax of some kind. The creature shown in the film does not stand up well to functional analysis.\"<ref name=\"Napier, 95\">Napier, 95</ref> Napier gives several reasons for his and other's skepticism<ref>Napier, 90\u201394</ref> that are commonly raised, but apparently his main reasons are original with him. First, the length of \"the footprints are totally at variance with its calculated height\".<ref>Napier, 94</ref> Second, the footprints are of the \"hourglass\" type, which he is suspicious of.<ref>Napier, 126</ref> (In response, Barbara Wasson criticized Napier's logic at length.)<ref>Wasson, 72\u201376, 78\u201379</ref>\n\nHe adds, \"I could not see the zipper; and I still can't. There I think we must leave the matter. Perhaps it was a man dressed up in a monkey-skin; if so it was a brilliantly executed hoax and the unknown perpetrator will take his place with the great hoaxers of the world. Perhaps it was the first film of a new type of hominid, quite unknown to science, in which case Roger Patterson deserves to rank with Dubois, the discoverer of ''Pithecanthropus erectus'', or Raymond Dart of Johannesburg, the man who introduced the world to its immediate human ancestor, ''Australopithecus africanus''.\"<ref name=\"Napier, 95\"/>\n\nThe skeptical views of Grieve and Napier are summarized favorably by Kenneth Wylie (and those of Bayanov and Donskoy negatively) in Appendix A of his 1980 book, ''Bigfoot: A Personal Inquiry into a Phenomenon''.<ref>Wylie, ''Bigfoot: A Personal Inquiry into a Phenomenon'', 237\u201342.</ref>\n\n====Esteban Sarmiento====\n[[Esteban Sarmiento]] is a specialist in physical anthropology at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. He has 25 years of experience with great apes in the wild. He writes,<ref>\"Conclusions Reached by Dr. Esteban Sarmiento ... (affiliations follow),\" in Murphy (2009), pp. 94\u201399</ref> \"I did find some inconsistencies in appearance and behavior that might suggest a fake ... but nothing that conclusively shows that this is the case.\"<ref>Murphy (2009), 94</ref> His most original criticism is this: \"The plantar surface of the feet is decidedly pale, but the palm of the hand seems to be dark. There is no mammal I know of in which the plantar sole differs so drastically in color from the palm.\"<ref>Murphy (2009), 95</ref> (But see Meldrum, 170\u201371.) His most controversial statements are these: \"The gluteals, although large, fail to show a humanlike cleft (or crack).\"<ref>Murphy (2009), 96</ref> \"Body proportions: ... In all of the above relative values, bigfoot is well within the human range and differs markedly from any living ape and from the 'australopithecine' fossils.\"<ref>Murphy (2009), 97</ref> (E.g., the IM index is in the normal human range.) And: \"I estimate bigfoot's weight to be between 190 and 240 lbs.\"<ref>Murphy (2009), 98\u201399</ref>\n\n====David J. Daegling and Daniel O. Schmitt====\nWhen anthropologists David J. Daegling of the [[University of Florida]] and Daniel O. Schmitt examined the film, they concluded it was impossible to conclusively determine if the subject in the film is nonhuman, and additionally argued that flaws in the studies by Krantz and others invalidated their claims. Daegling and Schmitt noted problems of uncertainties in the subject and camera positions, camera movement, poor image quality, and artifacts of the subject. They concluded: \"Based on our analysis of gait and problems inherent in estimating subject dimensions, it is our opinion that it is not possible to evaluate the identity of the film subject with any confidence.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Daegling|first1=David J.|last2=Schmitt|first2=Daniel O.|title=Bigfoot's screen test|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|date=May\u2013June 1999|volume=23|issue=3|page=20|url=http://www.bigfootencounters.com/articles/SI_99_daegling.htm|accessdate=June 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\nDaegling has asserted that the creature's odd walk could be replicated: \"Supposed peculiarities of subject speed, stride length, and posture are all reproducible by a human being employing this type of locomotion [a \"compliant gait\"].\"<ref>Daegling, 127</ref>\n\nDaegling notes that in 1967, movie and television [[special effect]]s were primitive compared to the more sophisticated effects in later decades, and allows that if the Patterson film depicts a man in a suit that \"it is not unreasonable to suggest that it is better than some of the tackier monster outfits that got thrown together for television at that time.\"<ref name=\"Daegling, 112\">Daegling, 112</ref>\n\n====Jessica Rose and James Gamble====\nJessica Rose and James Gamble are authors of \"the definitive text on human gait\",<ref>publisher's blurb on Amazon</ref> ''Human Walking''. They operate the Motion and Gait Analysis Lab at [[Stanford University]]. They conducted a high-tech human-replication attempt of \"Patty's\" gait, in cooperation with Jeff Meldrum. Rose was certain their subject had matched Patty's gait, while Gamble was not quite as sure.

But it would have to be really well planned by Roger [Patterson].\"<ref>Long, 166</ref>\n*Author Greg Long uncovered circumstantial evidence, of varying strength, of footprint hoaxing, and possibly even sighting and photo hoaxing, in the Yakima vicinity by Patterson.<ref>Long, 219\u201320, 389\u201394</ref> Long argues that this means that he faked the film, too. \n:(One possible motive for Yakima fakery would have been to make Bigfoot seem more real to a local millionaire he was acquainted with from whom he hoped to obtain funding for an expedition, Floyd Paxton.<ref>Long, 220\u201321, 223</ref>)\n:The film's proponents' position is that what is seen in the film is unfakable\u2014especially not by a costume beginner like Patterson. For instance, most of Bill Munns' book makes detailed examinations of film features that he argues could not have been created with 1967 special effects technology. He filmed recreation attempts of his own that failed. Daniel Perez wrote, \"If the film is in fact a fake, a costumed man or a machine, surely science could duplicate the film with ease.

(Roger was an accomplished 2-D artist whose drawings and painting of horses and other wildlife showed a detailed understanding of musculature and anatomy.) But he also argued that Patterson had \"nowhere near the knowledge or facilities to do so\u2014nor for that matter, did anyone else ... When I talked about some of the more technical details of [[biomechanics]], he (Patterson) showed the familiar blank look of a student who had lost the drift of the explanation, but was still trying hard to pay attention.

Oh, yes they can! When you're wearing long clown's feet, you can't place the ball of your foot down first. You have to put your foot down flat. Otherwise, you'll stumble. Another thing, when you put on the gorilla head, you can only turn your head maybe a quarter of the way. And to look behind you, you've got to turn your head and your shoulders and your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are in the way of the jaw. That's why the Bigfoot turns and looks the way he does in the film.

Opal said she saw the suit two days after the film was shot.<ref>Long, 363\u201364</ref>\n*Russ Bohannon, a longtime friend, says that Heironimus revealed the hoax privately in 1968 or 1969.<ref>Long, 414</ref>\n*Bernard Hammermeister, another longtime friend, said he was shown an ape suit in Heironimus' car. No date was given by Long for Hammermeister's observation, but it apparently came well after the relatives' observation, as implied by the word \"still\" in the justification Heironimus gave Hammermeister for requesting his silence: \"There was still supposed to be a [[payola]] on this thing, and he didn't have it.\"<ref>Long, 398</ref>\n\nLong argues that the suit Morris says he sold to Patterson was the same suit Heironimus claims to have worn in the Patterson film. However, Long quotes Heironimus and Morris describing different ape suits in many respects. Among the notable differences are:\n*Suit Material: Horsehide vs. Dynel. Heironimus says he was told by his brother Howard that Patterson claimed he manufactured the suit from [[horsehide]].<ref name=\"Long, 345\">Long, 345</ref> When Long asked how heavy the suit was, Bob replied, \"It weighed maybe twenty, twenty-five pounds. ... Horsehide would be heavy.\"<ref name=\"Long, 345\"/> Bob added, \"It stunk. Roger skinned out a dead, red horse.\"\n\n:But Morris reports that the suit was made of [[Dynel]], a lighter-weight synthetic material with little or no odor. Morris said that it was his \"standard suit that we sold to all our customers\"<ref name=\"Long, 446\"/> that cost $435<ref name=\"Long, 447\"/> (cheaper than the competition).<ref>Long, 445</ref>\n\n:Another contrast is that Howard reported that the horsehide was a \"real dark brown\" and Long writes that Morris \"was using brown Dynel in 1967\".<ref name=\"Long, 449\">Long, 449</ref> But Morris wouldn't have wanted a \"real dark\" brown color, as he chose brown to contrast against the black background of the girl-to-gorilla illusion.<ref name=\"Long, 449\"/>\n*Suit: Top-and-Trousers vs. a Back-Zipped Onesie. Heironimus described the suit as having no metal pieces and an upper \"torso part\" that he donned \"like putting on a T-shirt\".<ref>Long, 344\u201345</ref> At Bluff Creek he put on \"the top\".<ref>Long, 349</ref> Asked about the \"bottom portion,\" he guessed it was cinched with a drawstring.\n\n:But Morris made a one-piece [[union suit]] with a metal zipper up the back.<ref name=\"Long, 449\"/> Presumably one stepped into it first, then wiggled in one's arms; in any event, donning it like a T-shirt would be impossible.\n*Hands & Feet: Suit-Attached vs. Separate. Heironimus described the suit as having hands and feet that were attached to the arms and legs.\n\n:But Morris made a suit whose hands and feet were separate pieces. Long speculates that Patterson riveted or glued these parts to the suit, but offers no evidence to support this idea. If Patterson had done so, he must have done it before Heironimus did his test fitting and walk (because Heironimus describes a three-piece suit\u2014head, torso, and legs, omitting separate hands and feet)\u2014i.e., without adjusting their location to his dimensions. And Heironimus never described being measured beforehand.\n\nLong speculates that Patterson modified the costume, but only by attaching Morris's loose hands and feet to the costume,<ref>His only comments are in items 7 and 12 of \"Q & A\u2014The Making of Bigfoot,\" by Greg Long, April 6, 2004,  where he wrote, \"We know Roger Patterson owned a tool shed and worked in leather, clay, and wood. Modifying the suit parts\u2014such as gluing or riveting the hands to the cuffs of the suit, as well as the feet to the leg cuffs\u2014was well within his skill set.\"</ref> and by replacing Morris's mask.<ref>Long, 459</ref> However, there's nothing he wrote on ''suit'' modification. There's no evidence or testimony that Patterson changed the Morris suit to horsehide, or dyed it a darker color, or cut it in half at the waist to agree with Heironimus's description.\n\nSome film proponents<ref>Murphy (2005), 242\u201343</ref><ref>Murphy (2008), 93</ref><ref>Daegling, 143, paraphrasing Green</ref> say that Heironimus' arms are too short to match that of a Bigfoot and that he was a few inches shorter than the creature on the film (up to 14 inches shorter).<ref>Murphy (2009), 90\u201391</ref>\n\n:But Heironimus said that he wore football shoulder pads,<ref name=\"Long, 448\"/> which might explain why the shoulders and arms appear to be out of proportion to the rest of the body. However, Heironimus disclaimed the use of arm-extending sticks in his costume<ref>author Greg Long: \"Bob told me about two nights ago there were no sticks in the arms.\" Speech to the Int'l.

Wallace|Ray Wallace]] in 2002, following a request by [[Loren Coleman]] to ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' reporter Bob Young to investigate, the family of Wallace went public with claims that he had started the Bigfoot phenomenon with fake footprints (made from a wooden foot-shaped cutout) left in Californian sites in 1958.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Bob|title=Lovable trickster created a monster with Bigfoot hoax|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20021205&slug=raywallaceobit05m|accessdate=April 27, 2015|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=December 5, 2002}}</ref>\n\n*Mark Chorvinsky, editor of ''Strange'' magazine, promoted Wallace's claim that he tipped off Patterson exactly where to look for a Bigfoot.<ref>See, for instance, \"New $10k Bigfoot Photo Investigation 1993,\" by Mark Chorvinsky, at http://www.bigfootencounters.com/articles/10K-photograph.htm</ref> Chorvinsky wrote, \"'Roger Patterson came [over] dozens of times pumping me on this Bigfoot,' Ray Wallace explained to researcher Dennis Pilchis in 1982. 'I felt sorry for Roger Patterson. He told me he had cancer of the lymph glands and he was desperately broke and he wanted to try to get something where he could have a little income. Well, he went down there exactly where I told him. I told him, 'You go down there and hang around on that bank.

Coleman has asserted that Wallace had nothing to do with Patterson's footage in 1967, and has argued in an analysis of the media treatment of the death of Wallace that the international media inappropriately confused the Wallace films of the 1970s with the Patterson\u2013Gimlin 1967 film.<ref>Coleman, 2007</ref>\n*Dr. Meldrum has written extensively about Wallace, his allegations (continued by his family after his death), and the significant problems with them in his book, ''Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Meldrum|first1=Jeff|authorlink1=Jeffrey Meldrum|title=Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science|date=2007|publisher=[[Forge Books]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0765312174}}, 55\u201371</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Skeptical===\n* {{cite book|\n author=Joshua Blu Buhs|\n title=[[Bigfoot: The Life and Times of a Legend]]|\n year=2009|\n pages=[https://archive.org/details/bigfootlifetimes0000buhs/page/131 131\u201356, 187\u201392]|\n publisher=University of Chicago Press|\n isbn=978-0-226-07979-0}}\n* {{cite book|\n author=[[David Daegling]]|  url=https://archive.org/details/bigfootexposedan0000daeg|  url-access=registration|\n title=Bigfoot Exposed: An Anthropologist Examines America's Enduring Legend|\n publisher=[[Altamira Press]]|\n year=2004|  pages=[https://archive.org/details/bigfootexposedan0000daeg/page/105 105]\u201355|\n isbn=0-7591-0539-1}}\n* {{cite book|\n author=Greg Long|\n title=The Making of Bigfoot: The Inside Story|\n publisher=Prometheus Books|\n year=2004|\n isbn=1-59102-139-1}}\n* {{cite book|\n author=[[Michael McLeod (author)|Michael McLeod]]|\n title=Anatomy of a Beast: Obsession and Myth on the Trail of Bigfoot|\n pages=79\u2013141|\n chapter=Part II, Obsession|\n publisher=University of California Press|\n year=2009|\n isbn=978-0-520-25571-5}}\n* {{cite book|\n author=[[John R.

There was such a fleet in 1473 or 1476, commanded by John of Kolno, supposed to be a Polish navigator at the service of the king of Denmark. According to speculations lacking surviving written references, the fleet was commanded by two Baltic sailors and pirate hunters, [[Didrik Pining]] and [[Hans Pothorst]], possibly also including the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Jo\u00e3o Vaz Corte-Real]] on one of the journeys. It has been claimed that from the Western coast of Greenland they may have reached the North American mainland. The story can not be verified today, since the only surviving records tell us that Pothorst and Pining saw a \"rocky island called Hvitsark, halfway between Iceland and Greenland\" in 1494, as described by Samuel Eliot Morison in his \"The European Discovery of America, The Northern Voyages\". John of Kolno (\"Jan z Kolna\" in Polish, eventually \"Jan Scolvo\") by contrast, was a navigator who led a Danish fleet to the coast of Labrador in 1476, or even 1473, according to one source, at the command of Christian I of Denmark.\n\n==Sources for his alleged existence==\nIt is not certain if John Scolvus really existed and whether he reached America aboard these ships. All sources mentioning him were written long afterwards. Some evidence could suggest that Scolvus did exist and sailed to some location in the North Atlantic. Primarily, a 1536 globe of cartographer [[Gemma Frisius]] depicts an area within the Arctic Circle, north of a strait dividing ''Terra Corterealis'' and ''Baccalearum Regio'' from the westward projection of Greenland. Within this area is the inscription, \"Quij, the people to whom Joes Scoluss, a Dane, penetrated about the year 1476.\"<ref group=\"n\">Original caption: ''Quij populi ad quos Joes Scoluss danus peruenit circa annum 1476.''</ref><ref name=\"encyclopedia\">''[[Encyclopedia of Newfoundland and Labrador]] vol. 5, p. 107-108'', {{ISBN|0-9693422-1-7}}.</ref>\n\nSpanish author [[Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara]] wrote in his ''Historia de las Indias'' (1553) about [[Labrador|la Tierra de Labrador]]; \"Hither also came men from Norway with the pilot [navigator] Joan Scoluo, and Englishmen with Sebastian [should be John] Gaboto.\"<ref name=\"Nansen\"/> (In the sixteenth century, Greenland is known to have been referred to as \"Labrador\" by south European sources).<ref>Hughes, 2004, p.517.</ref> G\u00f3mara had supposedly met [[Olaus Magnus]] in [[Bologna]] and [[Venice]], perhaps in 1548. This suggests that the source of the statement about \"Joan Scoluo\" may have been from him.<ref name=\"Nansen\">Nansen and Chater, 1911.</ref>\n\nAnother possible reference to John Scolvus visiting Labrador is a document prepared in about 1575 for the first voyage of [[Martin Frobisher]]. After stating that Sebastian (should be [[John Cabot|John]]) \"Cabotte\" was sent out by King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] in 1496 (should be 1497) to find the passage from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], and that \"one [[Gaspar Corte-Real|Caspar Cortesreales]], a pilot of Portingale\", had visited these islands on the north coast of North America in 1500, the document continues:\n\"But to find oute the passage oute of the North Sea into the Southe we must sayle to the 60 degree, that is, from 66 unto 68. And this passage is called the Narowe Sea or Streicte of the three Brethren [i.e., the three brothers Corte-Real]; in which passage, at no tyme in the yere, is ise wonte to be found. The cause is the swifte ronnyng downe of sea into sea. In the north side of this passage, John Scolus, a pilot of Denmerke, was in anno 1476.\" While further containing complete impossibilities, the text also contain statements that have a sure historical foundation, like the voyage of Gaspar Corte-Real.<ref name=\"encyclopedia\"/><ref name=\"Nansen\"/>\n\nOn an English map from 1582 by [[Michael Lok]] there is a country to the north-west of Greenland, on which is written : \"Jac. Scolvus [[Croetland]].\". The corresponding country on Mercator's map of 1569 is \"Croclant, island whose inhabitants are Swedes by descent\".<ref name=\"Nansen\"/>\n\nIn 1597 the [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabanter]] [[Cornelius Wytfliet]] wrote in his ''Continens Indica'' that the northern parts of America were first discovered by \"[[Frisland]]ish\" fishermen, and later were further explored about 1390 by the [[Zeno brothers]]. He further writes; \"but the honour of its second discovery fell to the Pole Johannes Scoluus (''Johannes Scoluus Polonus''), who in the year 1476 \u2014 eighty-six years after its first discovery \u2014 sailed beyond Norway, Greenland, Frisland, penetrated the Northern Strait, under the very Arctic Circle, and arrived at the country of Labrador and [[Estotiland]]\". It has been suggested that ''Polonus'' was a misreading of ''piloto'' from the earlier account by Gomara which Wytfliet's writings is thought to have relied on.<ref name=\"Nansen\"/>\n\nOn the [[L'Ecuy globe]], of the sixteenth century, it is written in Latin that between 70\u00b0 and 80\u00b0 N. lat. and in long. \"''These are the people to whom the Dane Johannes Scowus penetrated in the year 1476.''\" The description of Scolvus as a Dane may indicate the same source as the English mention of him in 1576.<ref name=\"Nansen\"/>\n\nGenerally, the later sources about Scolvus are less reliable, since the writers probably read the earlier accounts and more or less copied from them.\n\n==Speculations==\nSome historians have variously described Scolvus as a Norwegian pilot, Catalan corsair, Welsh shipmaster and Polish navigator. Such claims have been criticised as being opportunistic in nature.<ref>Hughes, 2004, p. 511.</ref> Some writers (initially [[Peru]]vian librarian Louis Ulloa in 1934) have even speculated that ''Johannes Scolvus'' may have been the young [[Christopher Columbus]], and others that he is identical with [[Hans Pothorst]] or [[Jo\u00e3o Vaz Corte-Real]].<ref>Hughes, 2004, pp. 512-13.</ref>\n\n===Polish origin theory===\n[[File:0905 JohnScolvus JanzKolna SZN.jpg|thumb|right|100px|John Scolvus as depicted by a statue from modern times in [[Szczecin]], Poland with the Polish origin theory name rendering of ''Jan z Kolna''.]]\nPolish historian and cartographer [[Joachim Lelewel]] (1786 - 1861) was the first to gather all available mentions of Johannes Scolnus. He quoted a sources from 1570 by [[Fran\u00e7ois de Belleforest]], source from 1599 by  Wytfliet, and another from 1671 which claimed that Scolvus was Polish. Lelewel claimed that his name was really ''Jan z Kolna'' ({{lang-en|John of [[Kolno]]}}), and was the navigator of the Danish fleet. He also found mentions of a ''Joannis de Colno'' who studied at the [[Krakow Academy]] in 1455, and a Colno or Cholno family of merchants and sailors living in [[Danzig]] (Gda\u0144sk).\n\n====Criticisms====\nBoles\u0142aw Olszewicz, one of the modern historians who criticize Lelewel, argues there is not enough evidence to prove that Scolvus was actually Polish. Most of the works that mention Johannes Scolvus were published more than a century after the voyage and no contemporary evidence has been found.\n\nAs early as 1911 [[Fridtjof Nansen]] had speculated in his study ''Northern Mist'' that \"Pilotus\" (pilot) had been misread as \"Polonus\" (Polish).<ref name=\"Nansen\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Citation|title=The German discovery of America.

They inhabit a contiguous region in the [[Balkans|Balkan Peninsula]] and the eastern [[Alps]], and in the modern era are geographically separated from the body of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] and [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] people by the [[Romanians]], [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], and [[Austrians]] in between. The South Slavs today include the nations of [[Bosniaks]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Croats]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]], [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], [[Serbs]] and [[Slovenes]]. They are the main population of the [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southeastern Europe]]an countries of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Serbia]], and [[Slovenia]].\n\nIn the 20th century, the country of [[Yugoslavia]] (lit. \"South Slavia\"/\"Southern Slavland\") united the regions inhabited by South Slavic nations{{spaced ndash}} with the key exception of [[Bulgaria]]{{spaced ndash}} into a single state. The concept of ''Yugoslavia'', a single state for all South Slavic peoples, emerged in the late 17th century and gained prominence through the 19th-century [[Illyrian movement]]. The [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, was proclaimed on 1 December 1918, following the unification of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] with the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]].\n\n==Terminology==\nThe South Slavs are known in Serbian, Macedonian and Montenegrin as ''Ju\u017eni Sloveni'' ({{cyrl|\u0408\u0443\u0436\u043d\u0438 \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438}}); in Bulgarian as ''Yuzhni Slavyani'' ({{cyrl|\u042e\u0436\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0438}}); in Croatian and Bosnian as ''Ju\u017eni Slaveni''; in Slovene as ''Ju\u017eni Slovani''. The Slavic root ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/jug\u044a|*jug\u044a]]'' means \"south\". The [[Slavic ethnonym]] itself was used by 6th-century writers to describe the southern group of Early Slavs (the ''[[Sclaveni]]''); West Slavs were called ''[[Vistula Veneti|Veneti]]'' and East Slavs ''[[Antes (people)|Antes]]''.{{sfn|Kmietowicz|1976}} The South Slavs are also called \"Balkan Slavs\",<ref>{{harvnb|Kmietowicz|1976}}, {{harvnb|Vlasto|1970}}</ref> although this term does not encompass the Slovenes.\n\nAnother name popular in the early modern period was \"Illyrians\", the name of a pre-Slavic Balkan people, a name first adopted by Dalmatian intellectuals in the late 15th century to refer to South Slavic lands and population.{{sfn|URI|2000|p=104}} It was then used by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], [[Illyrian Provinces|France]], and notably adopted by the 19th-century Croatian nationalist and Pan-Slavist [[Illyrian movement]].{{sfn|Hupchick|2002|p=199}} Eventually, the idea of [[Yugoslavism]] appeared, aimed at uniting all South Slav-populated territories into a common state. From this idea emerged [[Yugoslavia]], which however did not include [[Bulgaria]].\n\n==History==\n{{Hatnote|'Slavic invasion of the Balkans' redirects here.}}\n===Early South Slavs===\n {{main article|Early Slavs|Sclaveni}}\n\nThe Proto-Slavic [[Urheimat|homeland]] is the area of Slavic settlement in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] during the first millennium AD, with its precise location debated by archaeologists, ethnographers and historians.<ref>{{harvnb|Kobyli\u0144ski|2005|pp=525\u2013526}}, {{harvnb|Barford|2001|p=37}}</ref> None of the proposed homelands reaches the [[Volga River]] in the east, over the [[Dinaric Alps]] in the southwest or the [[Balkan Mountains]] in the south, or past [[Bohemia]] in the west.<ref>{{harvnb|Kobyli\u0144ski|2005|p=526}}, {{harvnb|Barford|2001|p=332}}</ref> Traditionally, scholars put it in the marshes of Ukraine, or alternatively between the [[Bug River|Bug]] and the [[Dnieper]];{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=25}} however, according to F. Curta, the homeland of the southern Slavs mentioned by 6th-century writers was just north of the [[Lower Danube]].{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=56}} Little is known about the Slavs before the 5th century, when they began to spread out in all directions.\n\n[[Jordanes]], [[Procopius]] and other [[Late Antiquity|late Roman]] authors provide the probable earliest references to southern Slavs in the second half of the 6th century.{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=71\u201373}} Procopius described the [[Sclaveni]] and [[Antes (people)|Antes]] as two barbarian peoples with the same institutions and customs since ancient times, not ruled by a single leader but living under democracy,<ref>{{harvnb|James|2014|p=95}}, {{harvnb|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=524}}</ref> while Pseudo-Maurice called them a numerous people, undisciplined, unorganized and leaderless, who did not allow enslavement and conquest, and resistant to hardship, bearing all weathers.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|pp=524\u2013525}} They were portrayed by Procopius as unusually tall and strong, of dark skin and \"reddish\" hair (neither [[blond]] nor [[black hair|black]]), leading a primitive life and living in scattered huts, often changing their residence.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=524}} Procopius said they were [[henotheistic]], believing in the god of lightning ([[Perun]]), the ruler of all, to whom they sacrificed cattle.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=524}} They went into battle on foot, charging straight at their enemy, armed with spears and small shields, but they did not wear armour.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=524}}\n\nWhile archaeological evidence for a large-scale migration is lacking, most present-day historians claim that Slavs invaded and settled the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=26\u201341}} According to this dominant narrative, up until the late 560s their main activity across the Danube was raiding, though with limited Slavic settlement mainly through Byzantine colonies of ''[[foederati]]''.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=29}} The [[Danube]] and [[Sava]] frontier was overwhelmed by large-scale Slavic settlement in the late 6th and early 7th century.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=33}} What is today [[central Serbia]] was an important geo-strategical province, through which the ''[[Via Militaris]]'' crossed.{{sfn|\u017divkovi\u0107|2002|p=187}} This area was frequently intruded upon by [[Barbarians in the Byzantine Empire|barbarians]] in the 5th and 6th centuries.{{sfn|\u017divkovi\u0107|2002|p=187}} From the Danube, the Slavs commenced raiding the Byzantine Empire on an annual basis from the 520s, spreading destruction, taking loot and herds of cattle, seizing prisoners and taking fortresses. Often, the Byzantine Empire was stretched, defending its rich Asian provinces from Arabs, Persians and others. This meant that even numerically small, disorganised early Slavic raids were capable of causing much disruption, but could not capture the larger, fortified cities.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=29}} The first Slavic raid south of the Danube was recorded by Procopius, who mentions an attack of the Antes, \"who dwell close to the Sclaveni\", probably in 518.<ref>{{harvnb|James|2014|p=95}}, {{harvnb|Curta|2001|p=75}}</ref> Sclaveni are first mentioned in the context of the military policy on the Danube frontier of Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian I]] (r. 527\u2013565).{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=76}} Throughout the century, Slavs raided and plundered deep into the Balkans, from Dalmatia to Greece and Thrace, and were also at times recruited as mercenaries, fighting the [[Ostrogoths]].{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=78\u201386}} Justinian seems to have used the strategy of '[[Divide and rule|divide and conquer]]', and the Sclaveni and Antes are mentioned as fighting each other.{{sfn|James|2014|p=97}} The Antes are last mentioned as anti-Byzantine belligerents in 545, and the Sclaveni continued to raid the Balkans.<ref name=Byzantinoslavica-2003-78>{{cite book|title=Byzantinoslavica |volume=61\u201362 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twwrAQAAIAAJ |year=2003 |publisher=Academia|pp=78\u201379}}</ref> In 558 the [[Avar Khaganate|Avars]] arrived at the Black Sea steppe, and defeated the Antes between the Dnieper and Dniester.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=536}} The Avars subsequently allied themselves with the Sclaveni,{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=537\u2013539}} although there was an episode in which the Sclavene [[Daurentius]] (fl. 577\u2013579), the first Slavic chieftain recorded by name, dismissed Avar suzerainty and retorted that \"Others do not conquer our land, we conquer theirs [...] so it shall always be for us\", and had the Avar envoys slain.{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=47, 91}} By the 580s, as the Slav communities on the Danube became larger and more organized, and as the Avars exerted their influence, raids became larger and resulted in permanent settlement. Most scholars consider the period of 581-584 as the beginning of large-scale Slavic settlement in the Balkans.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=31}} F. Curta points out that evidence of substantial Slavic presence does not appear before the 7th century and remains qualitatively different from the \"Slavic culture\" found north of the [[Danube]].{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=308}} In the mid-6th century, the Byzantines re-asserted their control of the Danube frontier, thereby reducing the economic value of Slavic raiding. This growing economic isolation, combined with external threats from the Avars and Byzantines, led to political and military mobilisation. Meanwhile, the itinerant form of agriculture (lacking [[crop rotation]]) may have encouraged micro-regional mobility. Seventh-century archaeological sites show earlier hamlet collections evolving into larger communities with differentiated zones for public feasts, craftmanship, etc.{{sfn|Curta|2007|p=61}} It has been suggested that the Sclaveni were the ancestors of the Serbo-Croatian group while the Antes were that of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] [[Seven Slavic tribes|Slavs]], with much mixture in the contact zones.<ref>{{harvnb|Hupchick|2004}}, {{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=26}}</ref> The diminished pre-Slavic inhabitants, also including also Romanized native peoples,{{Cref2|a}} fled from the barbarian invasions and sought refuge inside fortified cities and islands, whilst others fled to remote mountains and forests and adopted a [[transhumant]] lifestyle.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=37}} The Romance speakers within the fortified [[Dalmatian city-states]] managed to retain their culture and language for a long time.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=35}} Meanwhile, the numerous Slavs mixed with and assimilated the descendants of the indigenous population.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=38, 41}}\n\nSubsequent information about Slavs' interaction with the Greeks and early Slavic states comes from the 10th-century ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' (DAI) by Emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]], the 7th-century compilations of the ''[[Miracles of Saint Demetrius]]'' (MSD) and the ''History'' by [[Theophylact Simocatta]]. DAI mentions the beginnings of the Croatian, Serbian and Bulgarian states from the early 7th to the mid-10th century. MSD and Theophylact Simocatta mention the Slavic tribes in Thessaly and Macedonia at the beginning of the 7th century. The 9th-century ''[[Royal Frankish Annals]]'' (RFA) also mention Slavic tribes in contact with the [[Franks]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\nBy 700 AD, Slavs had settled in most of the Central and Southeast Europe, from Austria even down to the Peloponnese of Greece, and from the Adriatic to the Black Sea, with the exception of the coastal areas and certain mountainous regions of the Greek peninsula.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=36}} The [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], who arrived in Europe in the late 550s and had a great impact in the Balkans, had from their base in the Carpathian plain, west of main Slavic settlements, asserted control over Slavic tribes with whom they besieged Roman cities. Their influence in the Balkans however diminished by the early 7th century and they were finally defeated and disappeared as a power at the turn of the 9th century by [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] and the [[Frankish Empire]].{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=29\u201343}} The first South Slavic polity and regional power was [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], a state formed in 681 as a union between the much numerous [[Seven Slavic tribes|Slavic]] [[Sclaveni|tribes]] and the [[bulgars]] of [[Asparuh of Bulgaria|Khan Asparuh]]. The scattered Slavs in Greece, the ''Sklavinia'', were Hellenized.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=41}} Romance-speakers lived within the fortified [[Dalmatian city-states]].{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=35}} Traditional historiography, based on DAI, holds that the migration of [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]] to the Balkans was part of a second Slavic wave, placed during Heraclius' reign.{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=66}}\n \nInhabiting the territory between the Franks in the north and Byzantium in the south, the Slavs were exposed to competing influences.{{sfn|Portal|1969|p=90}} In 863 to Christianized [[Great Moravia]] were sent two Byzantine brothers monks [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]], Slavs from Thessaloniki on missionary work.

In 1371, the Ottomans defeated a large Serbian army at the [[Battle of Maritsa]], and in 1389 defeated the Serbian army at the [[Battle of Kosovo]]. By now, Serbian and Bulgarian rulers became Ottoman vassals, the southern Serbian provinces and Bulgaria holding out until annexation in the 1390s. The Ottomans conquered Constantinople (1453), Greece (1453\u201360), the [[Serbian Despotate]] (1459) and [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnia]] (1463). Much of the Balkans was under Ottoman rule throughout the [[early modern period]]. Ottoman rule lasted from the 14th into the early 20th century in some territories. Ottoman society was multi-ethnic and multi-religious, and confessional groups were divided according to the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|''millet'' system]], in which Orthodox Christians (Greeks, Bulgarians, Serbs, etc.) constituted the [[Rum Millet]]. In Islamic jurisprudence, the Christians had ''[[dhimmi]]'' status, which entailed certain taxes and lesser rights. Through Islamization, communities of [[Slavic Muslims]] emerged, which survive until today in Bosnia, south Serbia, North Macedonia, and Bulgaria. \n\nIn the 16th century, the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] controlled what is today Slovenia, Croatia and northern Serbia. The [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]], which included smaller parts of what is today Croatia, was a crown land of the Habsburg emperor. The early modern period saw large-scale migrations of Orthodox Slavs (mainly Serbs) to the north and west. The [[Military Frontier]] was set up as the ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' against Ottoman incursions. There were several rebellions against Ottoman rule, but it was not until the 18th century that parts of the Balkans, namely [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788\u201392)|Serbia, were liberated]] for a longer period. While [[Pan-Slavism]] has its origins in the 17th-century Slavic Catholic clergymen in the Republic of Venice and Republic of Ragusa, it crystallized only in the mid-19th century amidst rise of nationalism in the Ottoman and Habsburg empires.\n\n==Statistics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!

These Serbo-Croatian standards are all based on the [[Shtokavian]] dialect group. Other dialect groups, which have lower intelligibility with Shtokavian, are [[Chakavian]] in [[Dalmatia]] and [[Kajkavian]] in [[Croatia proper]]. The dominance of Shtokavian across Serbo-Croatian speaking lands is due to historical westward migration during the Ottoman period. Slovene is South Slavic but has many features shared with West Slavic languages. The [[Prekmurje Slovene]] and [[Kajkavian]] are especially close, and there is no sharp delineation between them. In southeastern Serbia, dialects enter a transitional zone with Bulgarian and Macedonian, with features of both groups, and are commonly called [[Torlakian]].\n\nThe Eastern South Slavic languages are Bulgarian and Macedonian. Bulgarian has retained more archaic Slavic features in relation to the other languages. Bulgarian has two main [[yat]] splits. Slavic Macedonian was codified in Communist Yugoslavia in 1945 and was historically classified as Bulgarian. The [[Macedonian dialects]], divided into three main groups, are regarded overall as being transitional to Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian. The westernmost [[Bulgarian dialects]] (called [[Shopi]]) share features with Serbo-Croatian. Furthermore, in Greece there is a notable Slavic-speaking population [[Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia|in Greek Macedonia]] and [[Pomaks|western Thrace]].\n\nBalkan Slavic languages are part of a \"[[Balkan sprachbund]]\" with [[areal feature]]s shared with other non-Slavic languages in the Balkans.\n\n==Genetics==\n[[File:Plos.Balkans.2.png|thumb|400px|\"Admixture plot\" of automosal SNPs in 7 major population groups, including in Balkans (middle columns).]]\nThe earliest [[Genetic analysis|genetic studies]] for population affinities were according to 'classical markers', i.e. protein and blood group polymorphisms, according to which Cavalli-Sforza's team suggested several European cluster groups: \"Germanic\", \"Scandinavian\", \"Celtic\", south-western European and eastern European. The Yugoslavs (Bulgarians were not tested) did not group into any of the above but formed a group of their own, attributed to internal heterogeneity.\n\nAccording to a 2006 Y-DNA study, most South Slavs clustered together, while western Croats and Slovenians were instead clustered with West and East Slavic populations.

South of the [[Jire\u010dek line]] were the [[Greeks]]. To the north, there were [[Illyrians]], [[Thracians]] and [[Dacians]]. They were mainly tribalistic and generally lacked awareness of any ethno-political affiliation. Over the classical ages, they were at times invaded, conquered and influenced by [[Celts]], [[ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]]. Roman influence, however, was initially limited to cities concentrated along the Dalmatian coast, later spreading to a few scattered cities inside the Balkan interior, particularly along the river Danube ([[Sirmium]], [[Belgrade]], [[Ni\u0161]]). Roman citizens from throughout the empire settled in these cities and in the adjacent countryside. Following the fall of Rome and numerous barbarian raids, the population in the Balkans dropped, as did commerce and general standards of living. Many people were killed or taken prisoner by invaders. This demographic decline was particularly attributed to a drop in the number of indigenous peasants living in rural areas. They were the most vulnerable to raids and were also hardest hit by the financial crises that plagued the falling empire. However, the Balkans were not desolate, and considerable numbers of indigenous people remained. Only certain areas tended to be affected by the raids (e.g. lands around major land routes, such as the Morava corridor).{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=9\u201312, 37}} In addition to the autochthons, there were remnants of previous invaders such as \"[[Huns]]\" and various [[Germanic peoples]] when the Slavs arrived. [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian tribes]] such as the [[Iazyges]] were still recorded as living in the [[Banat]] region of the Danube.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=57}} The mixing of Slavs and other peoples is evident in

The South Slavs today include the nations of [[Bosniaks]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Croats]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]], [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], [[Serbs]] and [[Slovenes]]. They are the main population of the [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southeastern Europe]]an countries of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Serbia]], and [[Slovenia]].\n\nIn the 20th century, the country of [[Yugoslavia]] (lit. \"South Slavia\"/\"Southern Slavland\") united the regions inhabited by South Slavic nations{{spaced ndash}} with the key exception of [[Bulgaria]]{{spaced ndash}} into a single state. The concept of ''Yugoslavia'', a single state for all South Slavic peoples, emerged in the late 17th century and gained prominence through the 19th-century [[Illyrian movement]]. The [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, was proclaimed on 1 December 1918, following the unification of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] with the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]].\n\n==Terminology==\nThe South Slavs are known in Serbian, Macedonian and Montenegrin as ''Ju\u017eni Sloveni'' ({{cyrl|\u0408\u0443\u0436\u043d\u0438 \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438}}); in Bulgarian as ''Yuzhni Slavyani'' ({{cyrl|\u042e\u0436\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0438}}); in Croatian and Bosnian as ''Ju\u017eni Slaveni''; in Slovene as ''Ju\u017eni Slovani''. The Slavic root ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/jug\u044a|*jug\u044a]]'' means \"south\". The [[Slavic ethnonym]] itself was used by 6th-century writers to describe the southern group of Early Slavs (the ''[[Sclaveni]]''); West Slavs were called ''[[Vistula Veneti|Veneti]]'' and East Slavs ''[[Antes (people)|Antes]]''.{{sfn|Kmietowicz|1976}} The South Slavs are also called \"Balkan Slavs\",<ref>{{harvnb|Kmietowicz|1976}}, {{harvnb|Vlasto|1970}}</ref> although this term does not encompass the Slovenes.\n\nAnother name popular in the early modern period was \"Illyrians\", the name of a pre-Slavic Balkan people, a name first adopted by Dalmatian intellectuals in the late 15th century to refer to South Slavic lands and population.{{sfn|URI|2000|p=104}} It was then used by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], [[Illyrian Provinces|France]], and notably adopted by the 19th-century Croatian nationalist and Pan-Slavist [[Illyrian movement]].{{sfn|Hupchick|2002|p=199}} Eventually, the idea of [[Yugoslavism]] appeared, aimed at uniting all South Slav-populated territories into a common state.

Often, the Byzantine Empire was stretched, defending its rich Asian provinces from Arabs, Persians and others. This meant that even numerically small, disorganised early Slavic raids were capable of causing much disruption, but could not capture the larger, fortified cities.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=29}} The first Slavic raid south of the Danube was recorded by Procopius, who mentions an attack of the Antes, \"who dwell close to the Sclaveni\", probably in 518.<ref>{{harvnb|James|2014|p=95}}, {{harvnb|Curta|2001|p=75}}</ref> Sclaveni are first mentioned in the context of the military policy on the Danube frontier of Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian I]] (r. 527\u2013565).{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=76}} Throughout the century, Slavs raided and plundered deep into the Balkans, from Dalmatia to Greece and Thrace, and were also at times recruited as mercenaries, fighting the [[Ostrogoths]].{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=78\u201386}} Justinian seems to have used the strategy of '[[Divide and rule|divide and conquer]]', and the Sclaveni and Antes are mentioned as fighting each other.{{sfn|James|2014|p=97}} The Antes are last mentioned as anti-Byzantine belligerents in 545, and the Sclaveni continued to raid the Balkans.<ref name=Byzantinoslavica-2003-78>{{cite book|title=Byzantinoslavica |volume=61\u201362 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twwrAQAAIAAJ |year=2003 |publisher=Academia|pp=78\u201379}}</ref> In 558 the [[Avar Khaganate|Avars]] arrived at the Black Sea steppe, and defeated the Antes between the Dnieper and Dniester.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=536}} The Avars subsequently allied themselves with the Sclaveni,{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=537\u2013539}} although there was an episode in which the Sclavene [[Daurentius]] (fl. 577\u2013579), the first Slavic chieftain recorded by name, dismissed Avar suzerainty and retorted that \"Others do not conquer our land, we conquer theirs [...] so it shall always be for us\", and had the Avar envoys slain.{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=47, 91}} By the 580s, as the Slav communities on the Danube became larger and more organized, and as the Avars exerted their influence, raids became larger and resulted in permanent settlement. Most scholars consider the period of 581-584 as the beginning of large-scale Slavic settlement in the Balkans.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=31}} F. Curta points out that evidence of substantial Slavic presence does not appear before the 7th century and remains qualitatively different from the \"Slavic culture\" found north of the [[Danube]].{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=308}} In the mid-6th century, the Byzantines re-asserted their control of the Danube frontier, thereby reducing the economic value of Slavic raiding. This growing economic isolation, combined with external threats from the Avars and Byzantines, led to political and military mobilisation. Meanwhile, the itinerant form of agriculture (lacking [[crop rotation]]) may have encouraged micro-regional mobility. Seventh-century archaeological sites show earlier hamlet collections evolving into larger communities with differentiated zones for public feasts, craftmanship, etc.{{sfn|Curta|2007|p=61}} It has been suggested that the Sclaveni were the ancestors of the Serbo-Croatian group while the Antes were that of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] [[Seven Slavic tribes|Slavs]], with much mixture in the contact zones.<ref>{{harvnb|Hupchick|2004}}, {{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=26}}</ref> The diminished pre-Slavic inhabitants, also including also Romanized native peoples,{{Cref2|a}} fled from the barbarian invasions and sought refuge inside fortified cities and islands, whilst others fled to remote mountains and forests and adopted a [[transhumant]] lifestyle.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=37}} The Romance speakers within the fortified [[Dalmatian city-states]] managed to retain their culture and language for a long time.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=35}} Meanwhile, the numerous Slavs mixed with and assimilated the descendants of the indigenous population.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=38, 41}}\n\nSubsequent information about Slavs' interaction with the Greeks and early Slavic states comes from the 10th-century ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' (DAI) by Emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]], the 7th-century compilations of the ''[[Miracles of Saint Demetrius]]'' (MSD) and the ''History'' by [[Theophylact Simocatta]]. DAI mentions the beginnings of the Croatian, Serbian and Bulgarian states from the early 7th to the mid-10th century. MSD and Theophylact Simocatta mention the Slavic tribes in Thessaly and Macedonia at the beginning of the 7th century. The 9th-century ''[[Royal Frankish Annals]]'' (RFA) also mention Slavic tribes in contact with the [[Franks]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\nBy 700 AD, Slavs had settled in most of Central and Southeast Europe, from Austria even down to the Peloponnese of Greece, and from the Adriatic to the Black Sea, with the exception of the coastal areas and certain mountainous regions of the Greek peninsula.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=36}} The [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], who arrived in Europe in the late 550s and had a great impact in the Balkans, had from their base in the Carpathian plain, west of main Slavic settlements, asserted control over Slavic tribes with whom they besieged Roman cities.

In 1371, the Ottomans defeated a large Serbian army at the [[Battle of Maritsa]], and in 1389 defeated the Serbian army at the [[Battle of Kosovo]]. By now, Serbian and Bulgarian rulers became Ottoman vassals, the southern Serbian provinces and Bulgaria holding out until annexation in the 1390s. The Ottomans conquered Constantinople (1453), Greece (1453\u201360), the [[Serbian Despotate]] (1459) and [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnia]] (1463). Much of the Balkans was under Ottoman rule throughout the [[early modern period]]. Ottoman rule lasted from the 14th into the early 20th century in some territories. Ottoman society was multi-ethnic and multi-religious, and confessional groups were divided according to the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|''millet'' system]], in which Orthodox Christians (Greeks, Bulgarians, Serbs, etc.) constituted the [[Rum Millet]]. In Islamic jurisprudence, the Christians had ''[[dhimmi]]'' status, which entailed certain taxes and lesser rights. Through Islamization, communities of [[Slavic Muslims]] emerged, which survive until today in Bosnia, south Serbia, North Macedonia, and Bulgaria. \n\nIn the 16th century, the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] controlled what is today Slovenia, Croatia and northern Serbia. The [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]], which included smaller parts of what is today Croatia, was a crown land of the Habsburg emperor. The early modern period saw large-scale migrations of Orthodox Slavs (mainly Serbs) to the north and west. The [[Military Frontier]] was set up as the ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' against Ottoman incursions. There were several rebellions against Ottoman rule, but it was not until the 18th century that parts of the Balkans, namely [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788\u201392)|Serbia, were liberated]] for a longer period. While [[Pan-Slavism]] has its origins in the 17th-century Slavic Catholic clergymen in the Republic of Venice and Republic of Ragusa, it crystallized only in the mid-19th century amidst rise of nationalism in the Ottoman and Habsburg empires.\n\n==Statistics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!

These Serbo-Croatian standards are all based on the [[Shtokavian]] dialect group. Other dialect groups, which have lower intelligibility with Shtokavian, are [[Chakavian]] in [[Dalmatia]] and [[Kajkavian]] in [[Croatia proper]]. The dominance of Shtokavian across Serbo-Croatian speaking lands is due to historical westward migration during the Ottoman period. Slovene is South Slavic but has many features shared with West Slavic languages. The [[Prekmurje Slovene]] and [[Kajkavian]] are especially close, and there is no sharp delineation between them. In southeastern Serbia, dialects enter a transitional zone with Bulgarian and Macedonian, with features of both groups, and are commonly called [[Torlakian]].\n\nThe Eastern South Slavic languages are Bulgarian and Macedonian. Bulgarian has retained more archaic Slavic features in relation to the other languages. Bulgarian has two main [[yat]] splits. Slavic Macedonian was codified in Communist Yugoslavia in 1945 and was historically classified as Bulgarian. The [[Macedonian dialects]], divided into three main groups, are regarded overall as being transitional to Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian. The westernmost [[Bulgarian dialects]] (called [[Shopi]]) share features with Serbo-Croatian. Furthermore, in Greece there is a notable Slavic-speaking population [[Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia|in Greek Macedonia]] and [[Pomaks|western Thrace]].\n\nBalkan Slavic languages are part of a \"[[Balkan sprachbund]]\" with [[areal feature]]s shared with other non-Slavic languages in the Balkans.\n\n==Genetics==\n[[File:Plos.Balkans.2.png|thumb|400px|\"Admixture plot\" of automosal SNPs in 7 major population groups, including in Balkans (middle columns).]]\nThe earliest [[Genetic analysis|genetic studies]] for population affinities were according to 'classical markers', i.e. protein and blood group polymorphisms, according to which Cavalli-Sforza's team suggested several European cluster groups: \"Germanic\", \"Scandinavian\", \"Celtic\", south-western European and eastern European. The Yugoslavs (Bulgarians were not tested) did not group into any of the above but formed a group of their own, attributed to internal heterogeneity.\n\nAccording to a 2006 Y-DNA study, most South Slavs clustered together, while western Croats and Slovenians were instead clustered with West and East Slavic populations. Southern-Slavic populations (Serbs, Bosnians, Macedonians, and northern Croats) are\ngenetically distinct from their northern linguistic relatives.<ref name=\"R\u0119ba\u0142a ''et al.'' 2007\">{{cite journal | pmid = 17364156 | year = 2007 | last1 = Reba\u0142a | first1 = K | last2 = Mikulich | first2 = AI | last3 = Tsybovsky | first3 = IS | last4 = Siv\u00e1kov\u00e1 | first4 = D | last5 = Dzupinkov\u00e1 | first5 = Z | last6 = Szczerkowska-Dobosz | first6 = A | last7 = Szczerkowska | first7 = Z | title = Y-STR variation among Slavs: Evidence for the Slavic homeland in the middle Dnieper basin | volume = 52 | issue = 5 | pages = 406\u201314 | doi = 10.1007/s10038-007-0125-6 | journal = Journal of Human Genetics | doi-access = free }}</ref> A 2008 study concluded that except for some isolated communities, Europeans are somewhat genetically homogeneous, and individual population groups are often closely related to their immediate neighbours (irrespective of language or ethnicity).<ref>{{Citation |last=Novembre |first=J |last2=Johnson |first2=T |last3=Bryc |first3=K |title=Genes mirror geography within Europe |journal=Nature |volume=456 |issue=7218 |pages=98\u2013101 |date=November 2008 |pmid=18758442 |doi=10.1038/nature07331 |pmc=2735096|bibcode = 2008Natur.456...98N |displayauthors=1 |last4=Kutalik |last5=Boyko |first5=AR |last6=Auton |first6=A |last7=Indap |first7=A |last8=King |first8=KS |last9=Bergmann |first9=S |last10=Nelson |first10=MR |last11=Stephens |first11=M |last12=Bustamante|first12=CD}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |vauthors=Lao O, Lu TT, Nothnagel M, etal |title=Correlation between genetic and geographic structure in Europe |journal=Curr.

South of the [[Jire\u010dek line]] were the [[Greeks]]. To the north, there were [[Illyrians]], [[Thracians]] and [[Dacians]]. They were mainly tribalistic and generally lacked awareness of any ethno-political affiliation. Over the classical ages, they were at times invaded, conquered and influenced by [[Celts]], [[ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]]. Roman influence, however, was initially limited to cities concentrated along the Dalmatian coast, later spreading to a few scattered cities inside the Balkan interior, particularly along the river Danube ([[Sirmium]], [[Belgrade]], [[Ni\u0161]]). Roman citizens from throughout the empire settled in these cities and in the adjacent countryside. Following the fall of Rome and numerous barbarian raids, the population in the Balkans dropped, as did commerce and general standards of living. Many people were killed or taken prisoner by invaders. This demographic decline was particularly attributed to a drop in the number of indigenous peasants living in rural areas. They were the most vulnerable to raids and were also hardest hit by the financial crises that plagued the falling empire. However, the Balkans were not desolate, and considerable numbers of indigenous people remained. Only certain areas tended to be affected by the raids (e.g. lands around major land routes, such as the Morava corridor).{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=9\u201312, 37}} In addition to the autochthons, there were remnants of previous invaders such as \"[[Huns]]\" and various [[Germanic peoples]] when the Slavs arrived. [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian tribes]] such as the [[Iazyges]] were still recorded as living in the [[Banat]] region of the Danube.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=57}} The mixing of Slavs and other peoples is evident in
