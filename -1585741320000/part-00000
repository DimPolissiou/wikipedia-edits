In her solo career, Mercury has sold over 20 million records worldwide and had 24 Top 10 singles in the country, with 14 of them reached No. 1. Winner of a Latin Grammy for her album ''[[Bal\u00e9 Mulato \u2013 Ao Vivo]]'', she also received six Brazilian Music Award, an [[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Paulista de Cr\u00edticos de Arte|APCA]] award, three Multishow Brazilian Music Awards and two awards at [[VMB]]: Best Music Video and Photography.\n\nIn 1991, Mercury released her [[self-titled]] album, which was followed by ''[[O Canto da Cidade]]'' a year later, boosting her career as a national artist and taking the [[ax\u00e9 music]] to the evidence. Over the years, Mercury released several albums, generating great singles like \"[[Swing da Cor]]\", \"[[O Canto da Cidade (song)|O Canto da Cidade]]\", \"[[\u00c0 Primeira Vista (song)|\u00c0 Primeira Vista]]\", \"[[Rapunzel (Daniela Mercury song)|Rapunzel]]\", \"[[Nobre Vagabundo]]\", \"[[Il\u00ea P\u00e9rola Negra (song)|Il\u00ea P\u00e9rola Negra]]\", \"[[Mutante (song)|Mutante]]\", \"[[Maimb\u00ea Dand\u00e1]]\", \"[[Levada Brasileira]]\", \"[[Oy\u00e1 Por N\u00f3s]]\", among others. She recorded a commemorative DVD of [[Cirque du Soleil]]'s 25th anniversary, and was part of the [[Montreal Jazz Festival]]. In addition, Mercury was invited to participate in the [[Alejandro Sanz]]'s DVD, and sing with [[Paul McCartney]] in Oslo, [[Norway]], during the delivery of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].\n\nIn 2009 she released her album called ''[[Canib\u00e1lia]]'', along with the album, Daniela launched an international tour. The album spawned three singles: \"[[Preta]]\" with [[Seu Jorge]], \"[[Oy\u00e1 Por N\u00f3s]]\" with [[Margareth Menezes]] and \"[[Sol do Sul]]\". That same year, writer and intellectual [[Camille Paglia]], who had an intellectual \"passion\" for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], said Daniela Mercury is the artist who Madonna would like to be.\n\nIn 2011 the American TV channel [[CBS]], elected Daniela Mercury as the \"[[Carmen Miranda]] of the new times\". The ''Canib\u00e1lia'' album was released in the United States yielded a critique of [[The New York Times]] saying: \"Daniela Mercury goes beyond the concepts that were stressed during her career (...) with a contemporary pop, embracing ethnic and cultural diversity of Brazil (particularly african-Brazilian culture, while Daniela Mercury is white), remembering the past and transforming it.\"\n\n==Early life==\nDaniela Mercuri de Almeida was born on July 28, 1965,<ref name=\"IMDB\">[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0580536/bio Daniela Mercury biography].

As the 1990s began, Mercury decided to pursue a solo career.<ref name=\"dic\" />\n\n===Rise to fame (1991\u20131993)===\nMercury's self-titled debut album was released in 1991 through independent record company [[Eldorado]]. The lead single of the album, \"[[Swing da Cor]]\", which features [[Olodum]], became a number-one hit in Brazil,<ref name=\"dic\" /> and the album was soon known as ''[[Daniela Mercury (album)|Swing da Cor]]''. Another song from the album, \"Menino do Pel\u00f4\", which also features Olodum, became Mercury's second top-ten hit in Brazil, charting at number four. On the following year, Mercury shut off from the record company and, ever since, produces her own albums to negotiate the distribution of them later with the labels that are interested.\n\nIn 1992, she presented the project \"Som do Meio-Dia\" (Midday Sound) at the Art Museum of S\u00e3o Paulo ([[S\u00e3o Paulo Museum of Art|MASP]]). The show brought together over thirty thousand spectators, which eventually leave the traffic jam in the vicinity of the Paulista Avenue. After forty-minutes concert, Daniela was removed from the stage by representatives of the S\u00e3o Paulo tourist office, that concerned with the museum structure, obtained an order from the military police to remove it from the local.\n\nSoon after the show, Daniela was hired by [[Sony Music]] label and through this, released her second solo album, ''[[O Canto da Cidade]]''. The album sold over 2.5&nbsp;million copies in [[Brazil]] alone (which made Mercury the first artist to receive a double-diamond certification in her country) and was considered by journalist [[Andr\u00e9 Domingues]] <!--(in his book ''The 100 Best MPB Albums'')--> one of the best [[M\u00fasica popular brasileira|MPB]] albums ever. ''O Canto da Cidade'' is Mercury's album with most number-one songs (four in total; \"[[O Canto da Cidade (song)|O Canto da Cidade]]\", \"[[O Mais Belo dos Belos (song)|O Mais Belo dos Belos]]\", \"[[Batuque (song)|Batuque]]\" and \"[[Voc\u00ea N\u00e3o Entende Nada/Cotidiano (song)|Voc\u00ea N\u00e3o Entende Nada/Cotidiano]]\"). ''O Canto da Cidade'' is recognized as the album responsible for taking [[Ax\u00e9 Music]] to mainstream audiences in Brazil.\n\nThe album also yielded Mercury, a year-end special on [[Rede Globo]] channel, which were mixed with live performances in the square of Apotheosis in [[Rio de Janeiro]], and video clips with [[Caetano Veloso]], [[Herbert Vianna]] and [[Tom Jobim]]. Years later, the special, previously unreleased in video was released on DVD to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the release of the album. In July 1993, Mercury was one of Brazil's attractions at the prestigious [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in Switzerland.\n\nSome consider ''O Canto da Cidade'' was the forerunner of the [[samba-reggae]] movement, then called [[Ax\u00e9 Music]], gaining strength in all regions of the country and allowing other genre artists, were featured in the Brazilian music scene. It is believed that after this album, the Carnival of Bahia gained a massive media coverage. Mercury experienced during this period, a peak of popularity rarely seen in the history of Brazilian music industry, being dubbed \"the hurricane of Bahia\" and \"Queen of the Ax\u00e9\".\n\n===Artistic development (1994\u20132000)===\nIn 1994, ''[[M\u00fasica de Rua]]'' was released through Sony. The album was received with lukewarm reviews, with some critics complaining about the similarities between this album and its predecessor. Nevertheless, the album was very well received by the public, selling more than one million copies and producing the hits \"[[M\u00fasica de Rua (song)|M\u00fasica de Rua]]\", \"O Reggae e o Mar\" (both number-one hits), \"Por Amor ao Il\u00ea\" (a top-ten hit) and \"A Rosa\" (top-twenty). This was Mercury's first album to produce singles which have failed to chart.\n\nIn 1996, ''[[Feij\u00e3o com Arroz]]'' was released through [[Sony]]. This album was much better received by the critics than its predecessor. It is Mercury's most well rated album at [[Allmusic]], with four and a half stars. As of today, ''Feij\u00e3o com Arroz'' is Mercury's second best selling album, behind only ''O Canto da Cidade''. It produced the hits \"[[\u00c0 Primeira Vista (song)|\u00c0 Primeira Vista]]\", \"[[Nobre Vagabundo]]\", \"[[Rapunzel (Daniela Mercury song)|Rapunzel]]\" (all number-one hits), \"[[Minas com Bahia (song)|Minas com Bahia]]\" (which features [[Samuel Rosa]] from [[Skank (band)|Skank]] and was a top-twenty hit) and \"Feij\u00e3o de Corda\" (a top-ten hit).\n\nIn 1998, Mercury's first live album, ''[[El\u00e9trica]]'' was released through Sony. It sold almost half a million copies and produced the top-ten hit \"Trio Metal\", which charted at number eight.\n\n===Experimentation with electronica (2000\u20132004)===\n[[Image:Daniela Mercury.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Mercury performing in the concert ''Solidariedade Brasil-Noruega'' on October 7, 2003 in Teatro Nacional, [[Bras\u00edlia]]]]\nIn 2000, Mercury released her fifth studio album, ''Sol da Liberdade'', through [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]. The album sold almost a million copies and produced two number-one singles (\"[[Il\u00ea P\u00e9rola Negra (song)|Il\u00ea P\u00e9rola Negra]]\" and a cover of Antonio Marcus' \"Como Vai Voc\u00ea\"). The album, which was produced by Suba, was innovative in Mercury's career for its fusion with [[electronic music]] sounds.\n\nThe following year, Mercury released ''Sou de Qualquer Lugar'' through [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]. The album sold half of its predecessor, but was able to produce the number-one single \"[[Mutante (song)|Mutante]]\", a cover of [[Rita Lee]]. In this album, Mercury also experimented with electronic sounds.\n\nIn April 2003, Mercuy's second live album, ''MTV ao Vivo \u2013 Eletrodom\u00e9stico'', was released through [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]. It was recorded on January 23 and 24 of that same year at the Castro Alves Theater in Salvador for [[MTV Brasil]]. It was also released in the DVD format, Mercury's first. Among the artists who performed with the singer were [[Dulce Pontes]], [[Rosario Flores]], [[Jovanotti]], [[Carlinhos Brown]] and [[Olodum]]. The sales were very inferior to Mercury's previous and it only produced one top twenty hit (\"Meu Plano\").\n\nIn 2004, ''Carnaval Eletr\u00f4nico'' was released through [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]. For the recording of this album, Mercury invited DJs and producers of electronic music in [[Brazil]], as well as [[Gilberto Gil]], [[Carlinhos Brown]], and Lenine. It is a commemorative disc celebrating the five years of her having formed ''TrioTechno'', the first trio el\u00e9trico of electronic music in [[Bahian Carnaval]]. The disc received a Latin Grammy nomination for best pop album of the year and Mercury was nominated for a TIM Award for best female pop/rock vocalist. Internet users voted ''Carnaval Eletr\u00f4nico'' the best pop album of the year online in one of Brazil's most important weekly magazines ''Revista Isto \u00c9''.\n\n===Back to basics (2005\u20132007)===\nIn 2005, ''Cl\u00e1ssica'' was released through [[Som Livre]] on both CD and DVD. Recorded from a concert Mercury gave the year before at [[S\u00e3o Paulo]]'s Casa de Espet\u00e1culo, the album is a sampler of [[bossa nova]], [[jazz]], and some of her biggest MPB hits. The record signaled a new phase for Mercury, who chose independence from record companies to gain full control of her work. Mercury was in London, during the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|July 7 bombings]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ilustrada/ult90u51823.shtml|title=Folha Online - Ilustrada - Em Londres, Daniela Mercury relata horror das explos\u00f5es - 07/07/2005|website=www1.folha.uol.com.br}}</ref>\n\nThat same year, Mercury's eighth studio album, ''[[Bal\u00e9 Mulato]]'', was released, but through [[EMI]]. The album was very well received by the critics, with some even saying it was Mercury's best album since ''[[Feij\u00e3o com Arroz]]'' (1996). It was not, however, very well received by the public, with none of the singles being able to chart on the top-ten; a large part due to lack of record company support. The next year, the [[Latin Grammy Award]]-winning [[Bal\u00e9 Mulato - Ao Vivo|live version]] of ''Bal\u00e9 Mulato'', was released. Daniela Mercury has completed her newest release, ''[[Canib\u00e1lia]]''. Canibalia was launched in October 2009.\n\n===Reinventing popular culture with Canib\u00e1lia and working with Cabe\u00e7a de N\u00f3s Todos (2007\u20132013)===\n[[File:Brazilian singer, Daniela Mercury.jpg|thumb|Mercury in 2010.]]\n\nOn November 19, 2007, the singer released \"[[Preta]]\", which features [[Seu Jorge]]. The song, which is strongly influenced by [[samba]], was one of the most played in the country during the carnival. For the 2009's Carnival, Mercury recorded the song \"[[Oy\u00e1 Por N\u00f3s]]\", who wrote with Alfredo Moura and [[Margareth Menezes]]. The theme, based on the song \"Ketu de Ians\u00e3\" was first used by Moura in the doctoral ceremony honoris-cause of [[Gilberto Gil]] at the University of Aveiro in Portugal. After that, Moura used the theme in a play in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], at the University of Musicology. A year later, he showed the theme for Daniela, who did not know and she immediately wanted to record it to launch in the Carnival. In 2009, [[Rolling Stone Brasil]] magazine named Daniela as one of the 100 greatest artists of Brazilian music of all time. The names chosen by the expert jury, only 16 were women.\n\nFinally in November 2009, Daniela released the album entitled ''[[Canib\u00e1lia]]''. The album marks her return to the studio after five years. The recording sessions for the album takes almost three years to be done, ''Canib\u00e1lia'' hit stores with five different covers \u2013 a Gringo Cardia project. And five different track lists for the album, according to the singer, is an extensive project that combines music, dance, video and plastic arts \u2013 various expressions of art covered by it.\n\nDaniela Mercury has said that \"Canib\u00e1lia is an embrace, a swallow of Tropic\u00e1lia, the Clube da Esquina and everything that has since been created in the arts in Brazil since the \u2013 \u2018Semana de 22\u2019 [\u2018Semana de Arte Moderna de 1922 \u2019-The Week of Modern Art] \u2013  I yearn for the liberty that comes from this anthropophagic movement, of the Cannibalist Manifesto by Oswald de Andrade and its practice by Mario [de Andrade), who spoke that these mixtures reinforce our [Brazilian] identity\".\n\n[[Jos\u00e9 Oswald de Andrade Souza]] (1890 \u2013 October 1954) was a Brazilian poet and a controversial thinker. Born in S\u00e3o Paulo, Andrade was one of the founders of the Brazilian Modernist movement and a member of the Group of Five, including M\u00e1rio de Andrade, Anita Malfatti, Tarsila do Amaral Oswald de Andrade]. Andrade is recognized by his nationalist, ''[[Manifesto Antrop\u00f3fago]]'' (Cannibalist Manifesto), published in 1928.\nThe manifesto argues that based on the premise that the history of Brazil has, as its greatest strength, the power to cannibalize others and simultaneously plays with the idea of cannibalism as a modern primitivism; like a presumed tribal rite.\nCannibalism then, becomes a way for Brazil to reaffirm itself against the cultural domination of Post Colonial Europe.\nThe iconic phrase of the manifesto \"Tupi or not Tupi\" is as much a celebration of the Tupinamba, a documented tribe of cannibals, as it is an act of genius cannibalizing Shakespeare's, \"To be or not to be\".\n\nIn 2009, her tour named by the album title started in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], and traveled to several Brazilian cities and abroad. The work pays tribute to [[Carmen Miranda]], at her centenary, with songs like \"[[Tico-Tico no Fub\u00e1]]\" and \"[[O Que \u00c9 Que A Baiana Tem?]]\".\n\nFor 2010's Carnival, Daniela Mercury recorded \"[[Andarilho Encantado]]\", song released officially in the special project of the singer called ''P\u00f4r do Som'' (Sunset Sound), the show that brings Mercury as headliner each year on the first day of the year at the [[Farol da Barra]], in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], Bahia. The song was written by Mercury and Marcelo Quintanilha. Also in 2010, the year that the Electric Trio celebrates 60 years and Ax\u00e9 Music 25 years, the singer reaches 20 years of solo career \u2013 with significant-selling records. To commemorate the date, the media raised the possibility it make a documentary film about this invention of Bahian carnival, the ax\u00e9 music, praising percussionists.\n\nIn February 2013, the singer was invited to be interviewed in the ''[[Leading Women]]'' program of [[CNN International]], and was announced by the issuer as the \"Brazilian Madonna\". The attraction highlights the most influential women in the world in their fields. Already in 2012, the Bahian singer had attracted the attention of American writer and feminist Camille Paglia, who declared to the British newspaper [[The Independent]], that had a \"crush\" by the Bahian star. Since she had been in the country, for a conference in Bahia, Paglia has written enthusiastic articles about Mercury, saying that Daniela Mercury is the artist who's Madonna wanted to be. Paglia said, a Canadian television station, which is \"in love with a Brazilian superstar. I'm watching her work. She is Daniela Mercury. In fact, this has been very important. This is the point where I am in my life\" . In an interview with the Brazilian magazine [[Veja (magazine)|Veja]], intellectual revealed her plans to write two books about the Bahian singer.\n\nAt the end of 2013, released the album ''[[Daniela Mercury & Cabe\u00e7a de N\u00f3s Todos]]'', a partnership with the Brazilian group [[Cabe\u00e7a de N\u00f3s Todos]], with songs like \"[[Couch\u00e9]]\", \"[[Alma Feminina]]\", \"Paula e Bebeto\", \"Aquele Abra\u00e7o\" and \"Cheia de Gra\u00e7a\" are some of the tracks are presented in this work. It is an urban and pop-rock album, which does not show Daniela's rhythmic signature; it was launched with a book called \"Daniela and Malu, A Love Story\", a partnership with her wife Malu Ver\u00e7osa.

In her solo career, Mercury has sold over 20 million records worldwide and had 24 Top 10 singles in the country, with 14 of them reached No. 1. Winner of a Latin Grammy for her album ''[[Bal\u00e9 Mulato \u2013 Ao Vivo]]'', she also received six Brazilian Music Award, an [[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Paulista de Cr\u00edticos de Arte|APCA]] award, three Multishow Brazilian Music Awards and two awards at [[VMB]]: Best Music Video and Photography.\n\nIn 1991, Mercury released her [[self-titled]] album, which was followed by ''[[O Canto da Cidade]]'' a year later, boosting her career as a national artist and taking the [[ax\u00e9 music]] to the evidence. Over the years, Mercury released several albums, generating great singles like \"[[Swing da Cor]]\", \"[[O Canto da Cidade (song)|O Canto da Cidade]]\", \"[[\u00c0 Primeira Vista (song)|\u00c0 Primeira Vista]]\", \"[[Rapunzel (Daniela Mercury song)|Rapunzel]]\", \"[[Nobre Vagabundo]]\", \"[[Il\u00ea P\u00e9rola Negra (song)|Il\u00ea P\u00e9rola Negra]]\", \"[[Mutante (song)|Mutante]]\", \"[[Maimb\u00ea Dand\u00e1]]\", \"[[Levada Brasileira]]\", \"[[Oy\u00e1 Por N\u00f3s]]\", among others. She recorded a commemorative DVD of [[Cirque du Soleil]]'s 25th anniversary, and was part of the [[Montreal Jazz Festival]]. In addition, Mercury was invited to participate in the [[Alejandro Sanz]]'s DVD, and sing with [[Paul McCartney]] in Oslo, [[Norway]], during the delivery of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].\n\nIn 2009 she released her album called ''[[Canib\u00e1lia]]'', along with the album, Daniela launched an international tour. The album spawned three singles: \"[[Preta]]\" with [[Seu Jorge]], \"[[Oy\u00e1 Por N\u00f3s]]\" with [[Margareth Menezes]] and \"[[Sol do Sul]]\". That same year, writer and intellectual [[Camille Paglia]], who had an intellectual \"passion\" for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], said Daniela Mercury is the artist who Madonna would like to be.\n\nIn 2011 the American TV channel [[CBS]], elected Daniela Mercury as the \"[[Carmen Miranda]] of the new times\". The ''Canib\u00e1lia'' album was released in the United States yielded a critique of [[The New York Times]] saying: \"Daniela Mercury goes beyond the concepts that were stressed during her career (...) with a contemporary pop, embracing ethnic and cultural diversity of Brazil (particularly african-Brazilian culture, while Daniela Mercury is white), remembering the past and transforming it.\"\n\n==Early life==\nDaniela Mercuri de Almeida was born on July 28, 1965,<ref name=\"IMDB\">[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0580536/bio Daniela Mercury biography].

As the 1990s began, Mercury decided to pursue a solo career.<ref name=\"dic\" />\n\n===Rise to fame (1991\u20131993)===\nMercury's self-titled debut album was released in 1991 through independent record company [[Eldorado]]. The lead single of the album, \"[[Swing da Cor]]\", which features [[Olodum]], became a number-one hit in Brazil,<ref name=\"dic\" /> and the album was soon known as ''[[Daniela Mercury (album)|Swing da Cor]]''. Another song from the album, \"Menino do Pel\u00f4\", which also features Olodum, became Mercury's second top-ten hit in Brazil, charting at number four. On the following year, Mercury shut off from the record company and, ever since, produces her own albums to negotiate the distribution of them later with the labels that are interested.\n\nIn 1992, she presented the project \"Som do Meio-Dia\" (Midday Sound) at the Art Museum of S\u00e3o Paulo ([[S\u00e3o Paulo Museum of Art|MASP]]). The show brought together over thirty thousand spectators, which eventually leave the traffic jam in the vicinity of the Paulista Avenue. After forty-minutes concert, Daniela was removed from the stage by representatives of the S\u00e3o Paulo tourist office, that concerned with the museum structure, obtained an order from the military police to remove it from the local.\n\nSoon after the show, Daniela was hired by [[Sony Music]] label and through this, released her second solo album, ''[[O Canto da Cidade]]''. The album sold over 2.5&nbsp;million copies in [[Brazil]] alone (which made Mercury the first artist to receive a double-diamond certification in her country) and was considered by journalist [[Andr\u00e9 Domingues]] <!--(in his book ''The 100 Best MPB Albums'')--> one of the best [[M\u00fasica popular brasileira|MPB]] albums ever. ''O Canto da Cidade'' is Mercury's album with most number-one songs (four in total; \"[[O Canto da Cidade (song)|O Canto da Cidade]]\", \"[[O Mais Belo dos Belos (song)|O Mais Belo dos Belos]]\", \"[[Batuque (song)|Batuque]]\" and \"[[Voc\u00ea N\u00e3o Entende Nada/Cotidiano (song)|Voc\u00ea N\u00e3o Entende Nada/Cotidiano]]\"). ''O Canto da Cidade'' is recognized as the album responsible for taking [[Ax\u00e9 Music]] to mainstream audiences in Brazil.\n\nThe album also yielded Mercury, a year-end special on [[Rede Globo]] channel, which were mixed with live performances in the square of Apotheosis in [[Rio de Janeiro]], and video clips with [[Caetano Veloso]], [[Herbert Vianna]] and [[Tom Jobim]]. Years later, the special, previously unreleased in video was released on DVD to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the release of the album. In July 1993, Mercury was one of Brazil's attractions at the prestigious [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in Switzerland.\n\nSome consider ''O Canto da Cidade'' was the forerunner of the [[samba-reggae]] movement, then called [[Ax\u00e9 Music]], gaining strength in all regions of the country and allowing other genre artists, were featured in the Brazilian music scene. It is believed that after this album, the Carnival of Bahia gained a massive media coverage. Mercury experienced during this period, a peak of popularity rarely seen in the history of Brazilian music industry, being dubbed \"the hurricane of Bahia\" and \"Queen of the Ax\u00e9\".\n\n===Artistic development (1994\u20132000)===\nIn 1994, ''[[M\u00fasica de Rua]]'' was released through Sony. The album was received with lukewarm reviews, with some critics complaining about the similarities between this album and its predecessor. Nevertheless, the album was very well received by the public, selling more than one million copies and producing the hits \"[[M\u00fasica de Rua (song)|M\u00fasica de Rua]]\", \"O Reggae e o Mar\" (both number-one hits), \"Por Amor ao Il\u00ea\" (a top-ten hit) and \"A Rosa\" (top-twenty). This was Mercury's first album to produce singles which have failed to chart.\n\nIn 1996, ''[[Feij\u00e3o com Arroz]]'' was released through [[Sony]]. This album was much better received by the critics than its predecessor. It is Mercury's most well rated album at [[Allmusic]], with four and a half stars. As of today, ''Feij\u00e3o com Arroz'' is Mercury's second best selling album, behind only ''O Canto da Cidade''. It produced the hits \"[[\u00c0 Primeira Vista (song)|\u00c0 Primeira Vista]]\", \"[[Nobre Vagabundo]]\", \"[[Rapunzel (Daniela Mercury song)|Rapunzel]]\" (all number-one hits), \"[[Minas com Bahia (song)|Minas com Bahia]]\" (which features [[Samuel Rosa]] from [[Skank (band)|Skank]] and was a top-twenty hit) and \"Feij\u00e3o de Corda\" (a top-ten hit).\n\nIn 1998, Mercury's first live album, ''[[El\u00e9trica]]'' was released through Sony. It sold almost half a million copies and produced the top-ten hit \"Trio Metal\", which charted at number eight.\n\n===Experimentation with electronica (2000\u20132004)===\n[[Image:Daniela Mercury.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Mercury performing in the concert ''Solidariedade Brasil-Noruega'' on October 7, 2003 in Teatro Nacional, [[Bras\u00edlia]]]]\nIn 2000, Mercury released her fifth studio album, ''Sol da Liberdade'', through [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]. The album sold almost a million copies and produced two number-one singles (\"[[Il\u00ea P\u00e9rola Negra (song)|Il\u00ea P\u00e9rola Negra]]\" and a cover of Antonio Marcus' \"Como Vai Voc\u00ea\"). The album, which was produced by Suba, was innovative in Mercury's career for its fusion with [[electronic music]] sounds.\n\nThe following year, Mercury released ''Sou de Qualquer Lugar'' through [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]. The album sold half of its predecessor, but was able to produce the number-one single \"[[Mutante (song)|Mutante]]\", a cover of [[Rita Lee]]. In this album, Mercury also experimented with electronic sounds.\n\nIn April 2003, Mercuy's second live album, ''MTV ao Vivo \u2013 Eletrodom\u00e9stico'', was released through [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]. It was recorded on January 23 and 24 of that same year at the Castro Alves Theater in Salvador for [[MTV Brasil]]. It was also released in the DVD format, Mercury's first. Among the artists who performed with the singer were [[Dulce Pontes]], [[Rosario Flores]], [[Jovanotti]], [[Carlinhos Brown]] and [[Olodum]]. The sales were very inferior to Mercury's previous and it only produced one top twenty hit (\"Meu Plano\").\n\nIn 2004, ''Carnaval Eletr\u00f4nico'' was released through [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]. For the recording of this album, Mercury invited DJs and producers of electronic music in [[Brazil]], as well as [[Gilberto Gil]], [[Carlinhos Brown]], and Lenine. It is a commemorative disc celebrating the five years of her having formed ''TrioTechno'', the first trio el\u00e9trico of electronic music in [[Bahian Carnaval]]. The disc received a Latin Grammy nomination for best pop album of the year and Mercury was nominated for a TIM Award for best female pop/rock vocalist. Internet users voted ''Carnaval Eletr\u00f4nico'' the best pop album of the year online in one of Brazil's most important weekly magazines ''Revista Isto \u00c9''.\n\n===Back to basics (2005\u20132007)===\nIn 2005, ''Cl\u00e1ssica'' was released through [[Som Livre]] on both CD and DVD. Recorded from a concert Mercury gave the year before at [[S\u00e3o Paulo]]'s Casa de Espet\u00e1culo, the album is a sampler of [[bossa nova]], [[jazz]], and some of her biggest MPB hits. The record signaled a new phase for Mercury, who chose independence from record companies to gain full control of her work. Mercury was in London, during the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|July 7 bombings]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ilustrada/ult90u51823.shtml|title=Folha Online - Ilustrada - Em Londres, Daniela Mercury relata horror das explos\u00f5es - 07/07/2005|website=www1.folha.uol.com.br}}</ref>\n\nThat same year, Mercury's eighth studio album, ''[[Bal\u00e9 Mulato]]'', was released, but through [[EMI]]. The album was very well received by the critics, with some even saying it was Mercury's best album since ''[[Feij\u00e3o com Arroz]]'' (1996). It was not, however, very well received by the public, with none of the singles being able to chart on the top-ten; a large part due to lack of record company support. The next year, the [[Latin Grammy Award]]-winning [[Bal\u00e9 Mulato - Ao Vivo|live version]] of ''Bal\u00e9 Mulato'', was released. Daniela Mercury has completed her newest release, ''[[Canib\u00e1lia]]''. Canibalia was launched in October 2009.\n\n===Reinventing popular culture with Canib\u00e1lia and working with Cabe\u00e7a de N\u00f3s Todos (2007\u20132013)===\n[[File:Brazilian singer, Daniela Mercury.jpg|thumb|Mercury in 2010.]]\n\nOn November 19, 2007, the singer released \"[[Preta]]\", which features [[Seu Jorge]]. The song, which is strongly influenced by [[samba]], was one of the most played in the country during the carnival. For the 2009's Carnival, Mercury recorded the song \"[[Oy\u00e1 Por N\u00f3s]]\", who wrote with Alfredo Moura and [[Margareth Menezes]]. The theme, based on the song \"Ketu de Ians\u00e3\" was first used by Moura in the doctoral ceremony honoris-cause of [[Gilberto Gil]] at the University of Aveiro in Portugal. After that, Moura used the theme in a play in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], at the University of Musicology. A year later, he showed the theme for Daniela, who did not know and she immediately wanted to record it to launch in the Carnival. In 2009, [[Rolling Stone Brasil]] magazine named Daniela as one of the 100 greatest artists of Brazilian music of all time. The names chosen by the expert jury, only 16 were women.\n\nFinally in November 2009, Daniela released the album entitled ''[[Canib\u00e1lia]]''. The album marks her return to the studio after five years. The recording sessions for the album takes almost three years to be done, ''Canib\u00e1lia'' hit stores with five different covers \u2013 a Gringo Cardia project. And five different track lists for the album, according to the singer, is an extensive project that combines music, dance, video and plastic arts \u2013 various expressions of art covered by it.\n\nDaniela Mercury has said that \"Canib\u00e1lia is an embrace, a swallow of Tropic\u00e1lia, the Clube da Esquina and everything that has since been created in the arts in Brazil since the \u2013 \u2018Semana de 22\u2019 [\u2018Semana de Arte Moderna de 1922 \u2019-The Week of Modern Art] \u2013  I yearn for the liberty that comes from this anthropophagic movement, of the Cannibalist Manifesto by Oswald de Andrade and its practice by Mario [de Andrade), who spoke that these mixtures reinforce our [Brazilian] identity\".\n\n[[Jos\u00e9 Oswald de Andrade Souza]] (1890 \u2013 October 1954) was a Brazilian poet and a controversial thinker. Born in S\u00e3o Paulo, Andrade was one of the founders of the Brazilian Modernist movement and a member of the Group of Five, including M\u00e1rio de Andrade, Anita Malfatti, Tarsila do Amaral Oswald de Andrade]. Andrade is recognized by his nationalist, ''[[Manifesto Antrop\u00f3fago]]'' (Cannibalist Manifesto), published in 1928.\nThe manifesto argues that based on the premise that the history of Brazil has, as its greatest strength, the power to cannibalize others and simultaneously plays with the idea of cannibalism as a modern primitivism; like a presumed tribal rite.\nCannibalism then, becomes a way for Brazil to reaffirm itself against the cultural domination of Post Colonial Europe.\nThe iconic phrase of the manifesto \"Tupi or not Tupi\" is as much a celebration of the Tupinamba, a documented tribe of cannibals, as it is an act of genius cannibalizing Shakespeare's, \"To be or not to be\".\n\nIn 2009, her tour named by the album title started in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], and traveled to several Brazilian cities and abroad. The work pays tribute to [[Carmen Miranda]], at her centenary, with songs like \"[[Tico-Tico no Fub\u00e1]]\" and \"[[O Que \u00c9 Que A Baiana Tem?]]\".\n\nFor 2010's Carnival, Daniela Mercury recorded \"[[Andarilho Encantado]]\", song released officially in the special project of the singer called ''P\u00f4r do Som'' (Sunset Sound), the show that brings Mercury as headliner each year on the first day of the year at the [[Farol da Barra]], in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], Bahia. The song was written by Mercury and Marcelo Quintanilha. Also in 2010, the year that the Electric Trio celebrates 60 years and Ax\u00e9 Music 25 years, the singer reaches 20 years of solo career \u2013 with significant-selling records. To commemorate the date, the media raised the possibility it make a documentary film about this invention of Bahian carnival, the ax\u00e9 music, praising percussionists.\n\nIn February 2013, the singer was invited to be interviewed in the ''[[Leading Women]]'' program of [[CNN International]], and was announced by the issuer as the \"Brazilian Madonna\". The attraction highlights the most influential women in the world in their fields. Already in 2012, the Bahian singer had attracted the attention of American writer and feminist Camille Paglia, who declared to the British newspaper [[The Independent]], that had a \"crush\" by the Bahian star. Since she had been in the country, for a conference in Bahia, Paglia has written enthusiastic articles about Mercury, saying that Daniela Mercury is the artist who's Madonna wanted to be. Paglia said, a Canadian television station, which is \"in love with a Brazilian superstar. I'm watching her work. She is Daniela Mercury. In fact, this has been very important. This is the point where I am in my life\" . In an interview with the Brazilian magazine [[Veja (magazine)|Veja]], intellectual revealed her plans to write two books about the Bahian singer.\n\nAt the end of 2013, released the album ''[[Daniela Mercury & Cabe\u00e7a de N\u00f3s Todos]]'', a partnership with the Brazilian group [[Cabe\u00e7a de N\u00f3s Todos]], with songs like \"[[Couch\u00e9]]\", \"[[Alma Feminina]]\", \"Paula e Bebeto\", \"Aquele Abra\u00e7o\" and \"Cheia de Gra\u00e7a\" are some of the tracks are presented in this work. It is an urban and pop-rock album, which does not show Daniela's rhythmic signature; it was launched with a book called \"Daniela and Malu, A Love Story\", a partnership with her wife Malu Ver\u00e7osa. The book tells the story of their relationship, from the moment of friendship to marriage.\n\n===The Voice Kids and Vinil Virtual (2014\u2013present)===\n\nIn 2014, she was mentor on [[The Voice Kids (Portuguese TV series)|The Voice Kids]] (the version for children of the traditional show [[The Voice (TV series)|The Voice]]) of Portugal, because of her popularity in Portuguese lands. In the same year she released the single \"[[A Rainha do Ax\u00e9 (Rainha M\u00e1)]]\", an electronic ijex\u00e1 that speaks about the strength of women, love and faith which was sung by revelers during the 2015's Carnival of Salvador.

''Dulha Mil Gaya'' was panned by critics and did poorly at the domestic box office, earning back roughly half its budget, but was a hit overseas; it was the final film of Fardeen Khan's career.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe story focuses on Donsai ([[Fardeen Khan]]), the heir to Dhanraj Empire. Donsai is extremely against marriage and believes one should never ruin his life by getting married. After the passing of his father, Suraj Rattan Dhanraj, the only way to inherit his father's five-billion-rupee company, is to marry his friend's Punjabi daughter, Samarpreet ([[Ishita Sharma]]). Donsai gets married in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], and tells Samarpreet that he will return to Punjab after three months of business, though Donsai plans not to come back.\n\nAfter three months, Samarpreet comes to Donsai's home in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] to look for him, where she finds him with another woman. She runs out crying, until she is hit by a car. The car owner, Shimmer ([[Sushmita Sen]]), picks her up and takes Samarpreet to her home. When they get to Shimmer's home, it turns out Shimmer is one of Donsai's best friends. After Samarpreet gains consciousness, she tells Shimmer everything Donsai did to her. Shimmer decides to help Samarpreet and gives her a complete makeover\u2014she even changes her name to \"Samara\".\n\nAfter Donsai sees Samara (not knowing that she is his wife), he falls in love with her, and asks her out. Shimmer tells Samara to reject him; she accepts. Donsai then meets her at a yacht, where the two begin a conversation, and slowly Donsai decides to marry her. At the same time, Shimmer's plan is ruined, due to her boyfriend Pawan Raj Gandhi ([[Shah Rukh Khan|Shahrukh Khan]]) arriving unexpectedly for [[Karwa Chauth]]. Pawan realizes Samarpreet's problem, and offers to help out in the plan as well. Shimmer realises her feelings for PRG and she goes to meet him at the airport. At last Donsai accepts Samarpreet as his wife.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Fardeen Khan]] as Tej \u201cDonsai\u201d Dhanraj\n* [[Sushmita Sen]] as Shimmer Canhai\n* [[Ishita Sharma]] as Samarpreet K Tej Dhanraj / Samara Capore \n* [[Shah Rukh Khan]] as Pawan Raj Gandhi (PRG)\n* [[Tara Sharma]] as [[Tara Sutaria]] Tanvi\n* [[Mohit Chadda]] as Jigar\n* [[Colin Farrell]] as Amit\n* [[Suchitra Pillai]] as Jasmine\n* [[Johnny Lever]] as Hussain Bhai\n* [[Vivek Vaswani]] as Vakil\n* Howard Rosemeyer as Lotus\n* [[Parikshat Sahni]] as Mr. Kapoor\n* [[Beena Kak]] as Gurnaam Kapoor\n* [[Anushka Manchanda]] as Shyla (special appearance)\n* [[Randhir Kapoor]] as Suraj Rattan Dhanraj (special appearance)\n* [[Nataliya Kozhenova]] as Jenny\n\n==Production==\n\n===Casting===\nShahrukh Khan was set to make a 60-minute appearance in the film.

''Dulha Mil Gaya'' was panned by critics and did poorly at the domestic box office, earning back roughly half its budget, but was a hit overseas; it was the final film of Fardeen Khan's career.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe story focuses on Donsai ([[Fardeen Khan]]), the heir to Dhanraj Empire. Donsai is extremely against marriage and believes one should never ruin his life by getting married. After the passing of his father, Suraj Rattan Dhanraj, the only way to inherit his father's five billion empire company, is to get married to his friend's Punjabi daughter, Samarpreet ([[Ishita Sharma]]). Donsai gets married in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], and tells Samarpreet that he will return to Punjab after three months of business, though Donsai plans not to come back.\n\nAfter three months, Samarpreet comes to Donsai's home in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] to look for him, where she finds him with another woman. She runs out crying, until she is hit by a car. The car owner, Shimmer ([[Sushmita Sen]]), picks her up and takes Samarpreet to her home. When they get to Shimmer's home, it turns out Shimmer is one of Donsai's best friends. After Samarpreet gains consciousness, she tells Shimmer everything Donsai did to her. Shimmer decides to help Samarpreet and gives her a complete makeover\u2014she even changes her name to \"Samara\".\n\nAfter Donsai sees Samara (not knowing that she is his wife), he falls in love with her, and asks her out. Shimmer tells Samara to reject him; she accepts. Donsai then meets her at a yacht, where the two begin a conversation, and slowly Donsai decides to get married to her. At the same time, Shimmer's plan is ruined, due to her boyfriend Pawan Raj Gandhi ([[Shah Rukh Khan|Shahrukh Khan]]) arriving unexpectedly for [[Karwa Chauth]]. Pawan realizes Samarpreet's problem, and offers to help out in the plan as well. Shimmer realises her feelings for PRG and she goes to meet him at the airport. At last Donsai accepts Samarpreet as his wife.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Fardeen Khan]] as Tej \u201cDonsai\u201d Dhanraj\n* [[Sushmita Sen]] as Shimmer Canhai\n* [[Ishita Sharma]] as Samarpreet K Tej Dhanraj / Samara Capore \n* [[Shah Rukh Khan]] as Pawan Raj Gandhi (PRG)\n* [[Tara Sharma]] as [[Tara Sutaria]] Tanvi\n* [[Mohit Chadda]] as Jigar\n* [[Colin Farrell]] as Amit\n* [[Suchitra Pillai]] as Jasmine\n* [[Johnny Lever]] as Hussain Bhai\n* [[Vivek Vaswani]] as Vakil\n* Howard Rosemeyer as Lotus\n* [[Parikshat Sahni]] as Mr. Kapoor\n* [[Beena Kak]] as Gurnaam Kapoor\n* [[Anushka Manchanda]] as Shyla (special appearance)\n* [[Randhir Kapoor]] as Suraj Rattan Dhanraj (special appearance)\n* [[Nataliya Kozhenova]] as Jenny\n\n==Production==\n\n===Casting===\nShahrukh Khan was set to make a 60-minute appearance in the film.

The Bowery Boys dominated the theater in the early 19th century and theater was considered to be a \"male club\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Butsch|first1=Richard|title=Bowery B'hoys and Matinee Ladies: The Re-Gendering of Nineteenth-Century American Theater Audiences}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=200px>\nFile:Bowery Theatre, Manhattan.jpg|[[Bowery Theatre]], the [[Bowery]], [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]\nFile:Bowery-Theatre-Leslie-1856.jpeg|The interior of the [[Bowery Theatre]]\n</gallery>\n\n==In popular culture==\n*The main character of [[Patricia Beatty (writer)|Patricia Beatty]]'s 1987 historical children's fiction novel ''[[Charley Skedaddle]]'' is a Bowery Boy before enlisting as a drummer in the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] army.\n*The 2002 [[Martin Scorsese]] film ''[[Gangs of New York]]'' features a semi-fictionalized version of [[William Poole|\"Bill the Butcher\"]] as a central character belonging to a gang of nativists.
