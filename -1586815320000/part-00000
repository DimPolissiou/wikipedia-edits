In response, the original An-225 was re-engined, modified for heavy cargo transport, and placed back in service under the management of Antonov Airlines.\n\n[[File:An-225 Mriya.jpg|thumb|Antonov An-225 at [[Gostomel Airport]], [[Ukraine]]]]\nOn 23 May 2001, the An-225 received its type certificate from the Interstate Aviation Committee Aviation Register (IAC AR).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mak.ru/english/kommissions/aviareg/certificates/sertifikati_tipa_na_vozdushnie_suda.html |title=Type Certificates for Aircraft |accessdate=8 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430200431/http://www.mak.ru/english/kommissions/aviareg/certificates/sertifikati_tipa_na_vozdushnie_suda.html |archivedate=30 April 2008  }}</ref> On 11 September 2001, carrying four [[main battle tank]]s<ref name=\"ramAn225\"/> at a record load of {{convert|253.82|t|ST}} of cargo,<ref name=\"FAI_payload_record\"/> the An-225 flew at an altitude of up to {{convert|10750|m|ft|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"FAI_250t_height\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=7133 |title=Height record with 250t payload in the FAI database |access-date=2 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202104240/http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=7133 |archive-date=2 February 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> over a closed circuit of {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on}} at a speed of {{convert|763.2|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"FAI_250t_speed_record\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=7131 |title=Speed record with 250t payload over 1000km closed circuit in the official FAI database |accessdate=2 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202104236/http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=7131 |archive-date=2 February 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Special planes: The Antonov-225 Mriya\">{{Cite journal |url= http://www.eurotrib.com/story/2006/4/8/13392/35796 |title= Special planes: The Antonov-225 \"Mriya\" |publisher=European Tribune |date= 8 April 2006 |postscript=.}}</ref> The hire cost can be $30,000 per hour.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Skyba |first1=Christian Borys / Pictures by Anton |title=The world\u2019s biggest plane may have a new mission |url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170503-the-worlds-biggest-plane-may-have-a-new-mission |website=www.bbc.com |language=en |date=5 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe An-225 attracts a high degree of public interest, so much that it has managed to attain a global following due to its size and its uniqueness.

One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is [[Turing complete]] and can simulate a [[von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]] or any other [[Turing machine]].\n\n==Rules==\nThe universe of the ''Game of Life'' is an infinite, two-dimensional [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] grid of square ''cells'', each of which is in one of two possible states, ''alive'' or ''dead'', (or ''populated'' and ''unpopulated'', respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight ''[[Moore neighborhood|neighbours]]'', which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:\n# Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.\n# Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\n# Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.\n# Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nThese rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:\n# Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.\n# Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.\n# All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.\n\nThe initial pattern constitutes the ''seed'' of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a ''tick''. Each generation is a ''[[pure function]]'' of the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.\n\n==Origins==\nIn late 1940, [[John von Neumann]] defined life as a creation (as a ''being'' or organism) which can reproduce itself and simulate a [[Turing machine]]. Von Neumann was thinking about an engineering solution which would use electromagnetic components floating randomly in liquid or gas.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1179 1179]|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1179}}</ref> This turned out not to be realistic with the technology available at the time. [[Stanislaw Ulam]] invented [[cellular automata]], which were intended to simulate von Neumann's theoretical electromagnetic constructions. Ulam discussed using computers to simulate his cellular automata in a two-dimensional lattice in several papers. In parallel, Von Neumann attempted to construct Ulam's cellular automaton. Although successful, he was busy with other projects and left some details unfinished. His construction was complicated because it tried to simulate his own engineering design. Over time, simpler life constructions were provided by other researchers, and published in papers and books.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nMotivated by questions in mathematical logic and in part by work on simulation games by Ulam, among others, [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] began doing experiments in 1968 with a variety of different 2D cellular automaton rules.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/877 877]|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/877}}</ref> [[John Horton Conway|Conway's]] initial goal was to define an interesting and unpredictable cell automaton. Thus, he wanted some configurations to last for a long time before dying, other configurations to go on forever without allowing cycles, etc. It was a significant challenge and an open problem for years before experts on cell automatons managed to prove that, indeed, ''Conway's Game of Life'' admitted of a configuration which was alive in the sense of satisfying Von Neumann's two general requirements. While the definitions before ''Conway's Life'' were proof-oriented, Conway's construction aimed at simplicity without ''a priori'' providing proof the automaton was alive.\n\nConway chose his rules carefully, after considerable experimentation, to meet these criteria:\n# There should be no explosive growth.\n# There should exist small initial patterns with chaotic, unpredictable outcomes.\n# There should be potential for [[von Neumann universal constructor]]s.\n# The rules should be as simple as possible, whilst adhering to the above constraints.<ref>Conway, private communication to the 'Life list', 14 April 1999.</ref>\n\nThe game made its first public appearance in the October 1970 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'', in [[Martin Gardner]]'s \"[[Mathematical Games (column)|Mathematical Games]]\" column. Theoretically, ''Conway's Life'' has the power of a [[universal Turing machine]]: anything that can be computed [[algorithm]]ically can be computed within ''Life''.<ref name=\"chapman\"> It is a model and simulation that is interesting to watch and can show that simple things can become complicated problems.{{cite web|url=http://www.igblan.free-online.co.uk/igblan/ca/|title=Life Universal Computer|author=Paul Chapman|accessdate=12 July 2009|date=11 November 2002}}</ref><ref name=\"bcg\">{{Cite book | last1=Berlekamp | first1=E.

''Life'' provides an example of [[emergence]] and [[self-organization]]. Scholars in various fields, such as [[computer science]], [[physics]], [[biology]], [[biochemistry]], [[economics]], [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], and [[generative science]]s have made use of the way that complex patterns can emerge from the implementation of the game's simple rules.{{citation needed|reason=Example from philosophy given, but claim made across various fields, some evidence to substantiate, elucidate the implicit claim of \"diverse academic use of this game\" should be provided|date=April 2015}} The game can also serve as a didactic [[analogy]], used to convey the somewhat counter-intuitive notion that design and organization can spontaneously emerge in the absence of a designer. For example, cognitive scientist [[Daniel Dennett]] has used the analogy of ''Conway's Life'' \"universe\" extensively to illustrate the possible evolution of complex philosophical constructs, such as [[consciousness]] and [[free will]], from the relatively simple set of deterministic physical laws, which might govern our universe.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dennett|first=D.

The game could be run for hours on these machines, which would otherwise have remained unused at night. In this respect, it foreshadowed the later popularity of computer-generated [[fractal]]s. For many, ''Life'' was simply a programming challenge: a fun way to use otherwise wasted [[Central processing unit|CPU]] cycles. For some, however, ''Life'' had more philosophical connotations. It developed a cult following through the 1970s and beyond; current developments have gone so far as to create theoretic emulations of computer systems within the confines of a Life board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm|title=A Turing Machine in Conway's Game of Life|author=Paul Rendell|date=January 12, 2005|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=Spartan_universal_computer-constructor|title=Spartan universal computer-constructor|author=Adam P.

Common pattern types include: ''[[Still life (cellular automaton)|still lifes]]'', which do not change from one generation to the next; ''[[Oscillator (cellular automaton)|oscillators]]'', which return to their initial state after a finite number of generations; and ''[[spaceship (cellular automaton)|spaceships]]'', which translate themselves across the grid.\n\nThe earliest interesting patterns in the ''Game of Life'' were discovered without the use of computers. The simplest still lifes and oscillators were discovered while tracking the fates of various small starting configurations using [[graph paper]], [[blackboard]]s, and physical game boards, such as those used in [[Go (board game)|Go]]. During this early research, Conway discovered that the R-[[pentomino]] failed to stabilize in a small number of generations. In fact, it takes 1103 generations to stabilize, by which time it has a population of 116 and has generated six escaping [[Glider (Conway's Life)|gliders]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=R-pentomino|title=R-pentomino|publisher=LifeWiki|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> these were the first spaceships ever discovered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_g.htm#glider|author=Stephen A.

In the game's original appearance in \"Mathematical Games\", Conway offered a prize of fifty dollars to the first person who could prove or disprove the conjecture before the end of 1970. The prize was won in November by a team from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], led by [[Bill Gosper]]; the \"Gosper glider gun\" produces its first glider on the 15th generation, and another glider every 30th generation from then on. For many years, this glider gun was the smallest one known.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_g.htm#gosperglidergun|title=Gosper glider gun|author=Stephen A.

All three of the patterns shown below grow indefinitely.

For example, if two gliders are shot at a block in a specific position, the block will move closer to the source of the gliders. If three gliders are shot in just the right way, the block will move farther away. This ''sliding block memory'' can be used to simulate a [[Counter (digital)|counter]]. It is possible to construct [[logic gate]]s such as ''[[logical conjunction|AND]]'', ''[[Logical disjunction|OR]]'' and ''[[Negation|NOT]]'' using gliders. It is possible to build a pattern that acts like a [[finite-state machine]] connected to two counters. This has the same computational power as a [[universal Turing machine]], so the Game of Life is theoretically as powerful as any computer with unlimited memory and no time constraints; it is [[Turing complete]].<ref name=\"chapman\"/><ref name=\"bcg\"/> In fact, several different programmable computer architectures<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=2561#p37428|title=Programmable computer|publisher=conwaylife.com forums|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm|title=A Turing Machine in Conway's Game of Life, extendable to a Universal Turing Machine|publisher=Paul Rendell|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref> have been implemented in Conway's Life, including a pattern that simulates Tetris.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/11880/build-a-working-game-of-tetris-in-conways-game-of-life/142673#142673|title=Build a working game of Tetris in Conway's Game of Life|publisher=StackExchange|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, a pattern can contain a collection of guns that fire gliders in such a way as to construct new objects, including copies of the original pattern. A ''universal constructor'' can be built which contains a Turing complete computer, and which can build many types of complex objects, including more copies of itself.<ref name=\"bcg\"/>\n\nOn March 6, 2018, the first truly elementary knightship, Sir Robin, was discovered by Adam P. Goucher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=3303|title=Elementary knightship|access-date=9 March 2018}}</ref> A ''knightship'' is a spaceship that moves two squares left for every one square it moves down (like a [[Knight (chess)|knight in chess]]), as opposed to moving orthogonally or along a 45\u00b0 diagonal.

A pattern may stay chaotic for a very long time until it eventually settles to such a combination.\n\n''Life'' is [[undecidable problem|undecidable]], which means that given an initial pattern and a later pattern, no algorithm exists that can tell whether the later pattern is ever going to appear. This is a corollary of the [[halting problem]]: the problem of determining whether a given program will finish running or continue to run forever from an initial input.<ref>Elwyn R. Berlekamp, John H. Conway, and Richard K. Guy, Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays. Academic Press, 1982</ref>\n\nIndeed, since ''Life'' includes a pattern that is equivalent to a [[universal Turing machine]] (UTM), this deciding algorithm, if it existed, could be used to solve the halting problem by taking the initial pattern as the one corresponding to a UTM plus an input, and the later pattern as the one corresponding to a halting state of the UTM. It also follows that some patterns exist that remain chaotic forever. If this were not the case, one could progress the game sequentially until a non-chaotic pattern emerged, then compute whether a later pattern was going to appear.\n\n==Self-replication==\nOn May 18, 2010, Andrew J. Wade announced a self-constructing pattern, dubbed \"Gemini\", that creates a copy of itself while destroying its parent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=399&p=2327#p2327 |title=Universal Constructor Based Spaceship |publisher=Conwaylife.com |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=Gemini |title=Gemini \u2013 LifeWiki |publisher=Conwaylife.com |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> This pattern replicates in 34 million generations, and uses an instruction tape made of gliders oscillating between two stable configurations made of Chapman\u2013Greene construction arms.

The patterns that emerge from the simple rules may be considered a form of [[mathematical beauty]]. Small isolated sub patterns with no initial symmetry tend to become symmetrical. Once this happens, the symmetry may increase in richness, but it cannot be lost unless a nearby sub pattern comes close enough to disturb it. In a very few cases the society eventually dies out, with all living cells vanishing, though this may not happen for a great many generations. Most initial patterns eventually burn out, producing either stable figures or patterns that oscillate forever between two or more states;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/conwaylife/|author=Andrzej Okrasinski|title=Game of Life Object Statistics|accessdate=July 12, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727010353/http://geocities.com/conwaylife/ |archivedate=2009-07-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/soup/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910010849/http://conwaylife.com/soup/ |archivedate=2009-09-10|author=Nathaniel Johnston|title=The Online Life-Like CA Soup Search|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> many also produce one or more gliders or spaceships that travel indefinitely away from the initial location. Because of the nearest-neighbour based rules, no information can travel through the grid at a greater rate than one cell per unit time, so this velocity is said to be the [[Speed of light (cellular automaton)|cellular automaton speed of light]] and denoted ''c''.\n\n==Algorithms==\nEarly patterns with unknown futures, such as the R-pentomino, led computer programmers across the world to write programs to track the evolution of Life patterns. Most of the early [[algorithm]]s were similar: they represented ''Life'' patterns as two-dimensional arrays in computer memory. Typically two arrays are used: one to hold the current generation, and one to calculate its successor. Often 0 and 1 represent dead and live cells respectively. A nested [[for loop]] considers each element of the current array in turn, counting the live neighbours of each cell to decide whether the corresponding element of the successor array should be 0 or 1. The successor array is displayed. For the next iteration, the arrays swap roles so that the successor array in the last iteration becomes the current array in the next iteration.\n\nA variety of minor enhancements to this basic scheme are possible, and there are many ways to save unnecessary computation. A cell that did not change at the last time step, and none of whose neighbours changed, is guaranteed not to change at the current time step as well. So, a program that keeps track of which areas are active can save time by not updating inactive zones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/lifepatterns/lifeapplet.html|title=About my Conway's Game of Life Applet|author=Alan Hensel|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref>\n[[File:Trefoil knot conways game of life.gif|alt=Game of Life on the surface of a trefoil knot|thumb|Game of Life on the surface of a [[trefoil knot]]]]\nTo avoid decisions and branches in the counting loop, the rules can be rearranged from an [[Egocentrism|egocentric]] approach of the inner field regarding its neighbours to a scientific observer's viewpoint: if the sum of all nine fields in a given neighbourhood is three, the inner field state for the next generation will be life; if the all-field sum is four, the inner field retains its current state; and every other sum sets the inner field to death.\n\nIf it is desired to save memory, the storage can be reduced to one array plus two line buffers. One line buffer is used to calculate the successor state for a line, then the second line buffer is used to calculate the successor state for the next line. The first buffer is then written to its line and freed to hold the successor state for the third line. If a [[torus|toroidal]] array is used, a third buffer is needed so that the original state of the first line in the array can be saved until the last line is computed.\n\n[[File:Long gun.gif|thumb|right|Glider gun within a toroidal array. The stream of gliders eventually wraps around and destroys the gun.]]\n[[File:\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \"\u0416\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c\".gif|thumb|right|Red glider on the square lattice with periodic boundary conditions]]\n\nIn principle, the ''Life'' field is infinite, but computers have finite memory. This leads to problems when the active area encroaches on the border of the array. Programmers have used several strategies to address these problems. The simplest strategy is simply to assume that every cell outside the array is dead. This is easy to program but leads to inaccurate results when the active area crosses the boundary. A more sophisticated trick is to consider the left and right edges of the field to be stitched together, and the top and bottom edges also, yielding a [[torus|toroidal]] array. The result is that active areas that move across a field edge reappear at the opposite edge. Inaccuracy can still result if the pattern grows too large, but there are no pathological edge effects. Techniques of dynamic storage allocation may also be used, creating ever-larger arrays to hold growing patterns. ''Life'' on a finite field is sometimes explicitly studied; some implementations, such as ''[[Golly (program)|Golly]]'', support a choice of the standard infinite field, a field infinite only in one dimension or a finite field, with a choice of topologies such as a cylinder, a torus or a [[M\u00f6bius strip]].\n\nAlternatively, the programmer may abandon the notion of representing the ''Life'' field with a 2-dimensional array, and use a different data structure, such as a vector of coordinate pairs representing live cells. This approach allows the pattern to move about the field unhindered, as long as the population does not exceed the size of the live-coordinate array. The drawback is that counting live neighbours becomes a hash-table lookup or search operation, slowing down simulation speed. With more sophisticated data structures this problem can also be largely solved.\n\nFor exploring large patterns at great time depths, sophisticated algorithms such as [[Hashlife]] may be useful. There is also a method, applicable to other cellular automata too, for implementation of the ''Game of Life'' using arbitrary asynchronous updates whilst still exactly emulating the behaviour of the synchronous game.<ref>{{cite conference|title=Self-Reproduction in Asynchronous Cellular Automata |first=Chrystopher L. |last=Nehaniv |date=15\u201318 July 2002 |conference=2002 NASA/DoD Conference on Evolvable Hardware |conference-url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/mostRecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8000 |publisher=IEEE Computer Society Press |location=Alexandria, Virginia, USA |pages=201\u2013209 |isbn=0-7695-1718-8 |doi=10.1109/EH.2002.1029886 }}</ref> [[Source code]] examples that implement the basic ''Game of Life'' scenario in various programming languages, including [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] can be found at [[Rosetta Code]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life|title=Conway's Game of Life}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\n{{main | Life-like cellular automaton }}\nSince ''Life''{{'}}s inception, new, similar cellular automata have been developed. The standard ''Game of Life'' is symbolized as B3/S23. A cell is born if it has exactly three neighbours, survives if it has two or three living neighbours, and dies otherwise. The first number, or list of numbers, is what is required for a dead cell to be born. The second set is the requirement for a live cell to survive to the next generation. Hence B6/S16 means \"a cell is born if there are six neighbours, and lives on if there are either one or six neighbours\". Cellular automata on a two-dimensional grid that can be described in this way are known as [[Life-like cellular automaton|{{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} cellular automata]]. Another common {{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} automaton, ''[[Highlife (cellular automaton)|Highlife]]'', is described by the rule B36/S23, because having six neighbours, in addition to the original game's B3/S23 rule, causes a birth. ''HighLife'' is best known for its frequently occurring replicators.<ref>[http://www.tip.net.au/~dbell/articles/HighLife.zip HighLife \u2013 An Interesting Variant of Life] by David Bell (.zip file)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_r.htm#replicator|title=Replicator|publisher=The Life Lexicon|author=Stephen A.

These are rules that use the same square grid as the ''Life''-like rules and the same eight-cell neighbourhood, and are likewise invariant under rotation and reflection. However, in isotropic rules, the positions of neighbour cells relative to each other may be taken into account in determining a cell's future state\u2014not just the total number of those neighbours.\n\n[[File:Oscillator.gif|right|frame|A sample of a 48-step oscillator along with a 2-step oscillator and a 4-step oscillator from a 2-D hexagonal Game of Life (rule H:B2/S34)]]\n\nSome variations on ''Life'' modify the geometry of the universe as well as the rule. The above variations can be thought of as 2-D square, because the world is two-dimensional and laid out in a square grid. One-dimensional square variations, known as [[elementary cellular automaton|elementary cellular automata]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html|publisher=Wolfram Mathworld|title=Elementary Cellular Automaton|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> and 3-D square variations have been developed, as have 2-D hexagonal and 2-D triangular variations.

State transitions are then determined either by a weighting system or by a table specifying separate transition rules for each state; for example, ''[[Mirek's Cellebration]]''{{'}}s multi-coloured ''Rules Table'' and ''Weighted Life'' rule families each include sample rules equivalent to ''Conway's Life''.\n\nPatterns relating to fractals and fractal systems may also be observed in certain {{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} variations. For example, the automaton B1/S12 generates four very close approximations to the [[Sierpinski triangle]] when applied to a single live cell. The Sierpinski triangle can also be observed in Conway's Game of Life by examining the long-term growth of a long single-cell-thick line of live cells,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=One_cell_thick_pattern|title=One cell thick pattern|publisher=LifeWiki|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> as well as in ''Highlife'', [[Seeds (cellular automaton)|''Seeds'' (B2/S)]], and Wolfram's [[Rule 90]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=90|title=Life Imitates Sierpinski|publisher=ConwayLife.com forums|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref>\n\n''Immigration'' is a variation that is very similar to ''Conway's Game of Life'', except that there are two ''on'' states, often expressed as two different colours.

One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is [[Turing complete]] and can simulate a [[von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]] or any other [[Turing machine]].\n\n==Rules==\nThe universe of the ''Game of Life'' is an infinite, two-dimensional [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] grid of square ''cells'', each of which is in one of two possible states, ''alive'' or ''dead'', (or ''populated'' and ''unpopulated'', respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight ''[[Moore neighborhood|neighbours]]'', which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:\n# Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.\n# Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\n# Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.\n# Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nThese rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:\n# Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.\n# Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.\n# All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.\n\nThe initial pattern constitutes the ''seed'' of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a ''tick''. Each generation is a ''[[pure function]]'' of the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.\n\n==Origins==\nIn late 1940, [[John von Neumann]] defined life as a creation (as a ''being'' or organism) which can reproduce itself and simulate a [[Turing machine]]. Von Neumann was thinking about an engineering solution which would use electromagnetic components floating randomly in liquid or gas.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1179 1179]|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1179}}</ref> This turned out not to be realistic with the technology available at the time. [[Stanislaw Ulam]] invented [[cellular automata]], which were intended to simulate von Neumann's theoretical electromagnetic constructions. Ulam discussed using computers to simulate his cellular automata in a two-dimensional lattice in several papers. In parallel, Von Neumann attempted to construct Ulam's cellular automaton. Although successful, he was busy with other projects and left some details unfinished. His construction was complicated because it tried to simulate his own engineering design. Over time, simpler life constructions were provided by other researchers, and published in papers and books.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nMotivated by questions in mathematical logic and in part by work on simulation games by Ulam, among others, [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] began doing experiments in 1968 with a variety of different 2D cellular automaton rules.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/877 877]|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/877}}</ref> [[John Horton Conway|Conway's]] initial goal was to define an interesting and unpredictable cell automaton. Thus, he wanted some configurations to last for a long time before dying, other configurations to go on forever without allowing cycles, etc. It was a significant challenge and an open problem for years before experts on cell automatons managed to prove that, indeed, ''Conway's Game of Life'' admitted of a configuration which was alive in the sense of satisfying Von Neumann's two general requirements. While the definitions before ''Conway's Life'' were proof-oriented, Conway's construction aimed at simplicity without ''a priori'' providing proof the automaton was alive.\n\nConway chose his rules carefully, after considerable experimentation, to meet these criteria:\n# There should be no explosive growth.\n# There should exist small initial patterns with chaotic, unpredictable outcomes.\n# There should be potential for [[von Neumann universal constructor]]s.\n# The rules should be as simple as possible, whilst adhering to the above constraints.<ref>Conway, private communication to the 'Life list', 14 April 1999.</ref>\n\nThe game made its first public appearance in the October 1970 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'', in [[Martin Gardner]]'s \"[[Mathematical Games (column)|Mathematical Games]]\" column.

''Life'' provides an example of [[emergence]] and [[self-organization]]. Scholars in various fields, such as [[computer science]], [[physics]], [[biology]], [[biochemistry]], [[economics]], [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], and [[generative science]]s have made use of the way that complex patterns can emerge from the implementation of the game's simple rules.{{citation needed|reason=Example from philosophy given, but claim made across various fields, some evidence to substantiate, elucidate the implicit claim of \"diverse academic use of this game\" should be provided|date=April 2015}} The game can also serve as a didactic [[analogy]], used to convey the somewhat counter-intuitive notion that design and organization can spontaneously emerge in the absence of a designer. For example, cognitive scientist [[Daniel Dennett]] has used the analogy of ''Conway's Life'' \"universe\" extensively to illustrate the possible evolution of complex philosophical constructs, such as [[consciousness]] and [[free will]], from the relatively simple set of deterministic physical laws, which might govern our universe.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dennett|first=D.

The game could be run for hours on these machines, which would otherwise have remained unused at night. In this respect, it foreshadowed the later popularity of computer-generated [[fractal]]s. For many, ''Life'' was simply a programming challenge: a fun way to use otherwise wasted [[Central processing unit|CPU]] cycles. For some, however, ''Life'' had more philosophical connotations. It developed a cult following through the 1970s and beyond; current developments have gone so far as to create theoretic emulations of computer systems within the confines of a Life board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm|title=A Turing Machine in Conway's Game of Life|author=Paul Rendell|date=January 12, 2005|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=Spartan_universal_computer-constructor|title=Spartan universal computer-constructor|author=Adam P.

Common pattern types include: ''[[Still life (cellular automaton)|still lifes]]'', which do not change from one generation to the next; ''[[Oscillator (cellular automaton)|oscillators]]'', which return to their initial state after a finite number of generations; and ''[[spaceship (cellular automaton)|spaceships]]'', which translate themselves across the grid.\n\nThe earliest interesting patterns in the ''Game of Life'' were discovered without the use of computers. The simplest still lifes and oscillators were discovered while tracking the fates of various small starting configurations using [[graph paper]], [[blackboard]]s, and physical game boards, such as those used in [[Go (board game)|Go]]. During this early research, Conway discovered that the R-[[pentomino]] failed to stabilize in a small number of generations. In fact, it takes 1103 generations to stabilize, by which time it has a population of 116 and has generated six escaping [[Glider (Conway's Life)|gliders]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=R-pentomino|title=R-pentomino|publisher=LifeWiki|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> these were the first spaceships ever discovered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_g.htm#glider|author=Stephen A.

In the game's original appearance in \"Mathematical Games\", Conway offered a prize of fifty dollars to the first person who could prove or disprove the conjecture before the end of 1970. The prize was won in November by a team from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], led by [[Bill Gosper]]; the \"Gosper glider gun\" produces its first glider on the 15th generation, and another glider every 30th generation from then on. For many years, this glider gun was the smallest one known.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_g.htm#gosperglidergun|title=Gosper glider gun|author=Stephen A.

All three of the patterns shown below grow indefinitely.

For example, if two gliders are shot at a block in a specific position, the block will move closer to the source of the gliders. If three gliders are shot in just the right way, the block will move farther away. This ''sliding block memory'' can be used to simulate a [[Counter (digital)|counter]]. It is possible to construct [[logic gate]]s such as ''[[logical conjunction|AND]]'', ''[[Logical disjunction|OR]]'' and ''[[Negation|NOT]]'' using gliders. It is possible to build a pattern that acts like a [[finite-state machine]] connected to two counters. This has the same computational power as a [[universal Turing machine]], so the Game of Life is theoretically as powerful as any computer with unlimited memory and no time constraints; it is [[Turing complete]].<ref name=\"chapman\"/><ref name=\"bcg\"/> In fact, several different programmable computer architectures<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=2561#p37428|title=Programmable computer|publisher=conwaylife.com forums|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rendell-attic.org/gol/tm.htm|title=A Turing Machine in Conway's Game of Life, extendable to a Universal Turing Machine|publisher=Paul Rendell|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref> have been implemented in Conway's Life, including a pattern that simulates Tetris.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/11880/build-a-working-game-of-tetris-in-conways-game-of-life/142673#142673|title=Build a working game of Tetris in Conway's Game of Life|publisher=StackExchange|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, a pattern can contain a collection of guns that fire gliders in such a way as to construct new objects, including copies of the original pattern. A ''universal constructor'' can be built which contains a Turing complete computer, and which can build many types of complex objects, including more copies of itself.<ref name=\"bcg\"/>\n\nOn March 6, 2018, the first truly elementary knightship, Sir Robin, was discovered by Adam P. Goucher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=3303|title=Elementary knightship|access-date=9 March 2018}}</ref> A ''knightship'' is a spaceship that moves two squares left for every one square it moves down (like a [[Knight (chess)|knight in chess]]), as opposed to moving orthogonally or along a 45\u00b0 diagonal.

A pattern may stay chaotic for a very long time until it eventually settles to such a combination.\n\n''Life'' is [[undecidable problem|undecidable]], which means that given an initial pattern and a later pattern, no algorithm exists that can tell whether the later pattern is ever going to appear. This is a corollary of the [[halting problem]]: the problem of determining whether a given program will finish running or continue to run forever from an initial input.<ref>Elwyn R. Berlekamp, John H. Conway, and Richard K. Guy, Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays. Academic Press, 1982</ref>\n\nIndeed, since ''Life'' includes a pattern that is equivalent to a [[universal Turing machine]] (UTM), this deciding algorithm, if it existed, could be used to solve the halting problem by taking the initial pattern as the one corresponding to a UTM plus an input, and the later pattern as the one corresponding to a halting state of the UTM. It also follows that some patterns exist that remain chaotic forever. If this were not the case, one could progress the game sequentially until a non-chaotic pattern emerged, then compute whether a later pattern was going to appear.\n\n==Self-replication==\nOn May 18, 2010, Andrew J.

The patterns that emerge from the simple rules may be considered a form of [[mathematical beauty]]. Small isolated sub patterns with no initial symmetry tend to become symmetrical. Once this happens, the symmetry may increase in richness, but it cannot be lost unless a nearby sub pattern comes close enough to disturb it. In a very few cases the society eventually dies out, with all living cells vanishing, though this may not happen for a great many generations. Most initial patterns eventually burn out, producing either stable figures or patterns that oscillate forever between two or more states;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/conwaylife/|author=Andrzej Okrasinski|title=Game of Life Object Statistics|accessdate=July 12, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727010353/http://geocities.com/conwaylife/ |archivedate=2009-07-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/soup/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910010849/http://conwaylife.com/soup/ |archivedate=2009-09-10|author=Nathaniel Johnston|title=The Online Life-Like CA Soup Search|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> many also produce one or more gliders or spaceships that travel indefinitely away from the initial location. Because of the nearest-neighbour based rules, no information can travel through the grid at a greater rate than one cell per unit time, so this velocity is said to be the [[Speed of light (cellular automaton)|cellular automaton speed of light]] and denoted ''c''.\n\n==Algorithms==\nEarly patterns with unknown futures, such as the R-pentomino, led computer programmers across the world to write programs to track the evolution of Life patterns. Most of the early [[algorithm]]s were similar: they represented ''Life'' patterns as two-dimensional arrays in computer memory. Typically two arrays are used: one to hold the current generation, and one to calculate its successor. Often 0 and 1 represent dead and live cells respectively. A nested [[for loop]] considers each element of the current array in turn, counting the live neighbours of each cell to decide whether the corresponding element of the successor array should be 0 or 1. The successor array is displayed. For the next iteration, the arrays swap roles so that the successor array in the last iteration becomes the current array in the next iteration.\n\nA variety of minor enhancements to this basic scheme are possible, and there are many ways to save unnecessary computation. A cell that did not change at the last time step, and none of whose neighbours changed, is guaranteed not to change at the current time step as well. So, a program that keeps track of which areas are active can save time by not updating inactive zones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/lifepatterns/lifeapplet.html|title=About my Conway's Game of Life Applet|author=Alan Hensel|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref>\n[[File:Trefoil knot conways game of life.gif|alt=Game of Life on the surface of a trefoil knot|thumb|Game of Life on the surface of a [[trefoil knot]]]]\nTo avoid decisions and branches in the counting loop, the rules can be rearranged from an [[Egocentrism|egocentric]] approach of the inner field regarding its neighbours to a scientific observer's viewpoint: if the sum of all nine fields in a given neighbourhood is three, the inner field state for the next generation will be life; if the all-field sum is four, the inner field retains its current state; and every other sum sets the inner field to death.\n\nIf it is desired to save memory, the storage can be reduced to one array plus two line buffers. One line buffer is used to calculate the successor state for a line, then the second line buffer is used to calculate the successor state for the next line. The first buffer is then written to its line and freed to hold the successor state for the third line. If a [[torus|toroidal]] array is used, a third buffer is needed so that the original state of the first line in the array can be saved until the last line is computed.\n\n[[File:Long gun.gif|thumb|right|Glider gun within a toroidal array. The stream of gliders eventually wraps around and destroys the gun.]]\n[[File:\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \"\u0416\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c\".gif|thumb|right|Red glider on the square lattice with periodic boundary conditions]]\n\nIn principle, the ''Life'' field is infinite, but computers have finite memory. This leads to problems when the active area encroaches on the border of the array. Programmers have used several strategies to address these problems. The simplest strategy is simply to assume that every cell outside the array is dead. This is easy to program but leads to inaccurate results when the active area crosses the boundary. A more sophisticated trick is to consider the left and right edges of the field to be stitched together, and the top and bottom edges also, yielding a [[torus|toroidal]] array. The result is that active areas that move across a field edge reappear at the opposite edge. Inaccuracy can still result if the pattern grows too large, but there are no pathological edge effects. Techniques of dynamic storage allocation may also be used, creating ever-larger arrays to hold growing patterns. ''Life'' on a finite field is sometimes explicitly studied; some implementations, such as ''[[Golly (program)|Golly]]'', support a choice of the standard infinite field, a field infinite only in one dimension or a finite field, with a choice of topologies such as a cylinder, a torus or a [[M\u00f6bius strip]].\n\nAlternatively, the programmer may abandon the notion of representing the ''Life'' field with a 2-dimensional array, and use a different data structure, such as a vector of coordinate pairs representing live cells. This approach allows the pattern to move about the field unhindered, as long as the population does not exceed the size of the live-coordinate array. The drawback is that counting live neighbours becomes a hash-table lookup or search operation, slowing down simulation speed. With more sophisticated data structures this problem can also be largely solved.\n\nFor exploring large patterns at great time depths, sophisticated algorithms such as [[Hashlife]] may be useful. There is also a method, applicable to other cellular automata too, for implementation of the ''Game of Life'' using arbitrary asynchronous updates whilst still exactly emulating the behaviour of the synchronous game.<ref>{{cite conference|title=Self-Reproduction in Asynchronous Cellular Automata |first=Chrystopher L. |last=Nehaniv |date=15\u201318 July 2002 |conference=2002 NASA/DoD Conference on Evolvable Hardware |conference-url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/mostRecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8000 |publisher=IEEE Computer Society Press |location=Alexandria, Virginia, USA |pages=201\u2013209 |isbn=0-7695-1718-8 |doi=10.1109/EH.2002.1029886 }}</ref> [[Source code]] examples that implement the basic ''Game of Life'' scenario in various programming languages, including [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] can be found at [[Rosetta Code]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life|title=Conway's Game of Life}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\n{{main | Life-like cellular automaton }}\nSince ''Life''{{'}}s inception, new, similar cellular automata have been developed. The standard ''Game of Life'' is symbolized as B3/S23. A cell is born if it has exactly three neighbours, survives if it has two or three living neighbours, and dies otherwise. The first number, or list of numbers, is what is required for a dead cell to be born. The second set is the requirement for a live cell to survive to the next generation. Hence B6/S16 means \"a cell is born if there are six neighbours, and lives on if there are either one or six neighbours\". Cellular automata on a two-dimensional grid that can be described in this way are known as [[Life-like cellular automaton|{{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} cellular automata]]. Another common {{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} automaton, ''[[Highlife (cellular automaton)|Highlife]]'', is described by the rule B36/S23, because having six neighbours, in addition to the original game's B3/S23 rule, causes a birth. ''HighLife'' is best known for its frequently occurring replicators.<ref>[http://www.tip.net.au/~dbell/articles/HighLife.zip HighLife \u2013 An Interesting Variant of Life] by David Bell (.zip file)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_r.htm#replicator|title=Replicator|publisher=The Life Lexicon|author=Stephen A.

The vast majority of these 2<sup>18</sup> different rules<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conwaylife.com/wiki/Life-like#Life-like_cellular_automata |title=Life-like cellular automata - LifeWiki |publisher=Conwaylife.com |accessdate=March 4, 2019}}</ref> produce universes that are either too chaotic or too desolate to be of interest, but a large subset do display interesting behavior.

These are rules that use the same square grid as the ''Life''-like rules and the same eight-cell neighbourhood, and are likewise invariant under rotation and reflection. However, in isotropic rules, the positions of neighbour cells relative to each other may be taken into account in determining a cell's future state\u2014not just the total number of those neighbours.\n\n[[File:Oscillator.gif|right|frame|A sample of a 48-step oscillator along with a 2-step oscillator and a 4-step oscillator from a 2-D hexagonal Game of Life (rule H:B2/S34)]]\n\nSome variations on ''Life'' modify the geometry of the universe as well as the rule. The above variations can be thought of as 2-D square, because the world is two-dimensional and laid out in a square grid. One-dimensional square variations, known as [[elementary cellular automaton|elementary cellular automata]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html|publisher=Wolfram Mathworld|title=Elementary Cellular Automaton|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> and 3-D square variations have been developed, as have 2-D hexagonal and 2-D triangular variations. A variant using non-periodic tile grids has also been made.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22134-first-gliders-navigate-everchanging-penrose-universe.html|magazine=New Scientist|title=First gliders navigate ever-changing Penrose universe}}</ref>\n\nConway's rules may also be generalized such that instead of two states, ''live'' and ''dead'', there are three or more. State transitions are then determined either by a weighting system or by a table specifying separate transition rules for each state; for example, ''[[Mirek's Cellebration]]''{{'}}s multi-coloured ''Rules Table'' and ''Weighted Life'' rule families each include sample rules equivalent to ''Conway's Life''.\n\nPatterns relating to fractals and fractal systems may also be observed in certain {{Not a typo|''Life''-like}} variations. For example, the automaton B1/S12 generates four very close approximations to the [[Sierpinski triangle]] when applied to a single live cell. The Sierpinski triangle can also be observed in Conway's Game of Life by examining the long-term growth of a long single-cell-thick line of live cells,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=One_cell_thick_pattern|title=One cell thick pattern|publisher=LifeWiki|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> as well as in ''Highlife'', [[Seeds (cellular automaton)|''Seeds'' (B2/S)]], and Wolfram's [[Rule 90]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=90|title=Life Imitates Sierpinski|publisher=ConwayLife.com forums|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref>\n\n''Immigration'' is a variation that is very similar to ''Conway's Game of Life'', except that there are two ''on'' states, often expressed as two different colours. Whenever a new cell is born, it takes on the on state that is the majority in the three cells that gave it birth. This feature can be used to examine interactions between [[Spaceship (CA)|spaceships]] and other objects within the game.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex_i.htm#immigration |title=Immigration |publisher=The Life Lexicon|author=Stephen A.

This was tedious and prone to errors.

This program showed that the configuration had not reached a stable state after 1000 generations.\n\nThe first interactive ''Life'' program was written in an early version of [[ALGOL 68C]] for the [[PDP-7]] by [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|M.

His first collection, ''La muse chrestienne'' (1574) contains \u2018L\u2019Uranie\u2019, a verse prosopographia in which the Christian muse urges the poet to commit himself to composing serious poetry on scriptural themes. The other two items in the volume, the biblical epic ''Judit'' and 'Le Triomphe de la Foi', were examples of this new religious verse.\n\n=== The ''Semaines'' ===\nDu Bartas' masterpiece is his ''Semaines'' ('Weeks'), two epic poems which freely expand on the account in the [[Book of Genesis]] of the creation of the world and the first eras of world history. Each ''Semaine'' consists of individual ''jours'' (days) which can be read separately.\n\n==== ''La Semaine ou creation du Monde'' ====\n''La Semaine ou creation du Monde'' ('The Week, or creation of the World'), subsequently also known as ''La Premiere Sepmaine'' was first printed in Paris in 1578, and was immediately popular. ''La Sepmaine'' is a [[hexameral]] poem consisting of seven ''jours'', each containing around 700 lines, devoted to the aspect of the world created on that day in the first week. Because the poem's structure follows Genesis 1:1-8 closely, it is easy to navigate to particular sections; for example, readers wanting to find what Du Bartas writes about cuttlefish or mullet could know to turn to 'Le Cinquiesme Jour' (The Fifth Day) and in most editions would have had marginal annotations to help them locate the description of each creature.\n\n'Le Premier Jour' (The First Day) describes the creation of the world out of chaos (Du Bartas advocates the theory of creation ''[[ex nihilo]]'' - 'Nothing, but ''Nothing'' had the Lord Almighty, | Whereof, wherewith, whereby, to build this City' (Sylvester, I.i.228-29), forecasts the Day of Judgement and concludes with a discussion of angels. 'Le Second Jour' (The Second Day) concerns the creation of the four elements - water, air, earth and fire - and their meteorological effects. Land, seas and vegetation are created in 'Le Troisiesme Jour' (The Third Day). The earth is populated with particular species of natural life during the next three days: the sun, stars and seasons in 'Le Quatriesme Jour' (The Fourth Day); fish and birds in 'Le Cinquiesme Jour' (The Fifth Day); and land animals and human beings in 'Le Sixiesme Jour' (The Sixth Day). In 'Le Septiesme Jour' (The Seventh Day) Gods surveys the world he has created, and the poet meditates on the created world.[[File:Sallusti.png|thumb|La Sepmaine ou creation du Monde (1578)]]\n\n==== ''La Seconde Semaine'' ====\nFollowing the success of his First Week, Du Bartas embarked upon a sequel that would survey world history from Adam to the apocalypse, following the plan in Augustine's ''City of God''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Saint Augustine|title=City of God|origyear=1972|year= 2003|publisher=Penguin|page=1091 (Book 22, Chapter 30)}}</ref> He only completed four ''jours'', each divided into four parts, that covered the eras of Adam, Noah, Abraham and David (the final three were to cover [[Zedekiah]], the Messiah and the Eternal Sabbath).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sylvester|first1=Josuah|title=Devine Weekes and Workes|date=1621|page=Q6v}}</ref>\n\nThe first two ''jours'' of ''La Seconde Semaine'' were first printed in 1584. 'Le Premier Jour' (the era of Adam) contains 'Eden' (II.i.1) describing the Garden of Paradise; 'L'Imposture' ('The Imposture' in Sylvester's translation, II.i.2) which relates the Fall of Man; 'Les Furies' ('The Furies', II.i.3) which describes the diseases, conflicts and vices that plague mankind; and 'Les Artifices' ('The Handy Crafts', II.i.4) which is about the various crafts that humankind learnt, and Cain and Abel. 'Le Second Jour' (Noah) consists of 'L'Arche' ('The Arke', II.ii.1) retelling the Great Flood; 'Babylone' ('Babylon', II.ii.2) about the [[Tower of Babel]] and European literary cultures; 'Les Colonies' ('The Colonies', Ii.ii.3) which describes the spread of different tribes across the world; and 'Les Colomnes' ('The Columnes', II.ii.4) in which the tale (originally found in [[Josephus]]) of [[Seth]] writing scientific and astronomical knowledge on two pillars to safeguard it against fire and flood is a point of departure for a review of learning in those areas.\n\n''Les Suites de la Second Semaine,'' containing the third and fourth ''jours'', were printed in parts between 1591 and 1603. James VI of Scotland received a manuscript copy containing six of the eight sections of the ''Suites'' (including a version of 'Les Peres' with 830 lines not found in the printed texts) in the late 1580s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Auger|first=Peter|date=2016|title=Le Manuscrit Royal de la Suite de la Seconde Semaine de Du Bartas|url=|journal=Biblioth\u00e8que d'Humanisme et Renaissance|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> 'Le Troisieme Jour' continues the narrative into the age of Abraham: La Vocation ('The Vocation', II.iii.1) and 'Les Peres' ('The Fathers', II.iii.2) cover the end of the Book of Genesis in relating the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] and the sacrifice of [[Isaac]] respectively, while 'La Loy' ('The Law', II.iii.3) moves into the Exodus narrative and 'Les Captaines' ('The Captains', II.iii.4) to [[Joshua]] and [[Samuel]]. 'Le Quatrieme Jour' is devoted to [[David]]: 'Les Trophees' ('The Trophies', II.iv.1), 'La Magnificence' ('The Magnificence', II.iv.2) is about [[Solomon]], and the final two completed sections, 'Le Schisme' ('The Schism', II.iv.3) and finally 'La Decadence' ('The Decay', II.iv.4), reviews the monarchs of the [[Books of Kings]] and [[Book of Chronicles]].\n\n=== Miscellaneous Poems ===\n\nBesides ''Le muse chrestienne'' and the two ''Semaines,'' Du Bartas wrote a number of occasional poems and lyrics.  Among these are two of some length, about battles that occurred in the author's lifetime: 'Cantique d'Yvry' ('Song of Ivry'), on the [[Battle of Ivry]] (1590), not long before the poet's death, and 'La Lepanthe' ('Lepanto'), a translation of [[James VI and I|James VI]]'s poem on the [[Battle of Lepanto]] (1571).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Holmes |title=Works of Du Bartas |date=1940 |page=III:490\u2013526}}  King James' original poem was published in ''His Majesties Poeticall Exercises,'' ed.

See Holmes (1940), ''Works of Du Bartas,'' III:506.</ref>\n\n== Reputation ==\n\n===France===\n''La Sepmaine'' was instantly successful in France: there were 42 editions between 1578 and 1632, often printed with [[Simon Goulart]]'s marginal annotations and commentary.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Holmes|title=Works of Du Bartas|page=I.77|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Du Bartas was the most highly esteemed French poet in France at the turn of the seventeenth century, even more so than [[Ronsard]], and in 1620 was still regarded as the apogee of French 'grand poesie'.<ref name=\"Garapon\">{{cite journal|last1=Garapon|title=Sur la Renomm\u00e9e posthume de Ronsard et de Du Bartas|pages=53\u201359}}</ref> However, there were no further French editions of the ''Semaines'' after 1630.<ref name=\"Garapon\" /> What were once regarded as the stylistic merits of Du Bartas' were later deemed to be weaknesses: his use of compound epithets, duplication of initial syllables, frequent inclusion of metaphors and similes and a highly compressed and accumulative style all contributed to a sense that his poetry was over-wrought and over-elaborate.\n\nNonetheless there were over thirty poems influenced by Du Bartas printed in France between 1601 and 1697, including direct continuations or parodies such as Christophe de Gamon's ''La Sepmaine'' (1609) and A. D\u2019Argent's ''Sepmaine'' (1629), and printed references praising Du Bartas in works written throughout this period.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Magnien|first1=Michel|title='Du Bartas en France au XVIIe si\u00e8cle' in Du Bartas: 1590\u20131990|date=1992|location=Mont-de-Marsan|pages=69\u201380}}</ref> As late as 1684 [[Madeleine de Scud\u00e9ry]] recalled the often-cited anecdote that Ronsard had once remarked that Du Bartas had achieved more in a week than he had in his entire life.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Magnien|title=Du Bartas en France|pages=55, 75}}</ref> Du Bartas was, however, an object of criticism: he was, for example, cited for examples of mistakes to avoid in a ''Br\u00e8ve instruction'' (1667). Du Bartas' reputation remained low in subsequent centuries: in 1842 [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]] wrote that Du Bartas \u2018a pu s\u2019\u00e9garer et c\u00e9der au mauvais go\u00fbt de son temps dans le gros de ces oeuvres\u2019 (\u2018was led astray and gave into the poor taste of his times in most of his work\u2019).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sainte-Beuve|first1=Charles Augustin|date=1842|title=Anciens Po\u00e8tes Fran\u00e7ais: Du Bartas|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k86880r/f550|journal=Revue des Deux Mondes|volume=29|pages=549\u201375|via=Gallica}}</ref>\n\nThough Du Bartas is still not widely known in France today, critical re-appraisals in the twentieth century, led by James Dauphin\u00e9, Yvonne Bellenger and other, have shown how Du Bartas' encyclopedic writing was representative of its time and is still worthy of attention.\n\n===Scotland===\n[[James VI]] of [[Scotland]]'s enthusiasm for Du Bartas made the Frenchman's poetry uniquely popular in sixteenth-century Scotland. James possessed a copy of ''La Sepmaine'' given to him by his nurse,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Warner|first1=George Frederick|title=The Library of James VI, 1573\u20131583|date=1893|location=Edinburgh|page=xliii}}</ref> and a year later wrote in the preface to his ''Essayes of a Prentise'' (Edinburgh, 1584) that\n\n:Hauing oft reuolued, and red ouer (fauorable Reader) the booke and Poems of the deuine and Illuster Poete, Salust du Bartas, I was moved by the oft reading & perusing of them, with a restles and lofty desire, to preas to attaine to the like vertue. (''Essayes'', C3r)\n\nThe volume contained James's Scots translation of ''L'Uranie''. Du Bartas' synthesis of sacred and secular verse matched the King's own aesthetic preferences, and also his political imperative to consolidate his divine and political authority. The King shared Urania's sense that more poets should write about the highest matters:\n\n:O ye that wolde your browes with Laurel bind,\n:What larger feild I pray you can you find,\n:Then is his praise, who brydles heavens most cleare\n:Makes mountaines tremble, and howest hells to feare?\n\n[[Thomas Hudson (poet)|Thomas Hudson]], a court musician, was (so he writes in the preface) commissioned by the King to prepare a translation of ''Judit'', which was printed in 1584 with prefatory sonnets by James and others. Du Bartas was evidently quickly made aware of the King's attention, for a publisher's contract which Du Bartas signed in 1585 mentions printing the King's translation (as well as Du Bartas\u2019 translation of the King's \u2018Ane Schort Poeme of Tyme\u2019).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Holmes |title=Works of Du Bartas|page=I. 205\u20136}}</ref>\n\nDu Bartas and James subsequently met in the summer of 1587 when the French poet travelled on a diplomatic mission to Scotland, via the English Court, to propose a marriage match between James and [[Henry IV of France|Henri de Navarre]]\u2019s sister, [[Catherine de Bourbon]]. Though the match never happened, Du Bartas remained in high esteem with James: he received expensive gifts on departure, and the King invited him to return.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Auger|title=Du Bartas' Visit to England and Scotland}}</ref> It may well have been during this visit that Du Bartas translated James\u2019 mini-epic on [[The Battle of Lepanto]] which was printed alongside James\u2019 original poem and his translation of \u2018Les Furies\u2019 in his ''[[Poeticall Exercises at Vacant Houres]]'' (1591).\n\nPoets writing at the Jacobean Court (members of the so-called \"[[Castalian Band]]\") all knew of Du Bartas, who was \u2018aesthetically and ideologically a role-model for James\u2019 and \u2018emblematic of the direction, spiritually, philosophically and aesthetically, in which James sought to lead his imagined renaissance\u2019 (Sarah Dunnigan) at the Scottish Court.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dunnigan|first1=Sarah|title=Eros and Poetry at the Courts of Mary Queen of Scots and James VI|date=2002|location=Basingstoke|pages=5}}</ref> [[William Fowler (makar)|William Fowler]]<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Craigie |editor-first1=James|title=Thomas Hudson's Historie of Judith|date=1941|location=Edinburgh and London|pages=4}}</ref> and [[John Stewart of Baldynneis]]<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Crockett |editor-first1=Thomas|title=Poems of John Stewart of Baldynneis|pages=II, p. 196}}</ref> are two poets who refer to Urania as a symbolic figurehead for the kind of poetic inspiration to which they aspired in vain. Hadrian Damman's Latin translation was dedicated to James when printed in 1600 (a manuscript copy dated 1596 also survives, National Library of Scotland MS Adv. 19.2.10).<ref>{{cite web|title=English Short Title Catalogue|url=http://estc.bl.uk/S116418}}</ref> [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]], [[William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling|William Alexander]] and [[Zachary Boyd]] are three seventeenth-century Scottish poets who knew Du Bartas\u2019 works well; the latter two imitate his works (Sylvester's translation in Boyd's case) extensively.\n\nJames had a major impact on English responses both before and after his accession to the English throne. Gabriel Harvey is one of numerous writers in London who were reading James' translation in the 1590s: when Harvey praised Du Bartas as the \u2018Treasurer of Humanity and 'Ieweller of Diuinity\u2019 and \u2018a right inspired, and enravished Poet\u2019 in the preface to ''Pierces Supererogation'' (1593) and other works, he was in part drawing on notes made in his copy of James's ''Essayes''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Relle|first1=Eleanor|title=Some New Marginalia and Poems of Gabriel Harvey|journal=Review of English Studies|date=1972|volume=23|pages=401\u201316}}</ref> A passage in the King's ''[[Basilikon Doron]]'' exhorting more poets to 'bee well versed' in Du Bartas' poetry<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Craigie |editor-first1=James|title=Basilicon Doron|date=1944|location=Edinburgh and London|pages=I, p. 199}}</ref> was cited, for instance, by [[Thomas Winter (M.A.)|Thomas Winter]] in the dedicatory epistle of his translation of the ''Third Dayes Creation'' (1604). [[Joshua Sylvester]] dedicated his translation ''Devine Weekes and Workes'' (1605) to James, having presented a manuscript extract to the King in the previous year.\n\n===England===\nDu Bartas was extremely popular in early modern England, and was still being read widely in the later seventeenth century even as his reputation in France began to decline. Around two hundred texts printed in England before 1700 make direct reference to Du Bartas, including seventy-five from the period 1641-1700.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Auger|title=Snapshots|pages=3\u20134, 8}}</ref> There were numerous translations of sections of the ''Semaines'' into English, of which the most significant is [[Josuah Sylvester]]'s ''Devine Weekes and Workes'' (1605 et seq.; re-printed six times by 1641). Du Bartas was quickly regarded as a divine epic poet whose works took their place among the great European classics: [[Gabriel Harvey]], for example, compared Du Bartas to Homer, Virgil and Dante.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Relle|first1=Eleanor|title=Some New Marginalia and Poems of Gabriel Harvey|journal=Review of English Studies|date=1972|volume=23|pages=403, 411}}</ref>\n\n[[Sir Philip Sidney]] apparently admired Du Bartas' works later in life, and his translation of 'Salust Du Bartas' was entered into the Stationers\u2019 Register in 1588, but is now unknown.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ringler|first1=William A.|title=The Poems of Philip Sidney|date=1962|location=Oxford|page=339}}</ref> Du Bartas had in effect synthesized the two highest forms of poetry, divine and philosophical, described in Sidney's ''[[An Apology for Poetry|Apology for Poetry]]''. S. K. Heninger, reflecting on similarities between Sidney and Du Bartas\u2019 conception of poetry, writes that: \u2018the reader could ponder the wide-ranging mysteries of creation. He could contemplate God\u2019s intention, His methods, His results. The text is characterized by a Protestant passion for the truth\u2014the truth, at once universal and concrete.

Though Bradstreet's poetry owes much to Du Bartas' methods, her work is not derivative, and she denied that her poetry imitates Du Bartas in her dedicatory poem to her father Thomas Dudley: 'I honour him, but dare not wear his wealth\u2019 (ll. 38-9).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hensley|first1=Jeannine|title=THe Works of Anne Bradstreet|date=2005|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=4, 14}}</ref> [[Lucy Hutchinson]] would have read ''Devine Weekes'' before writing ''Order and Disorder''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Norbrook|first1=David|title=Lucy Hutchinson, Order and Disorder|date=2001|page=xxv}}</ref>\n\n===Rest of Europe===\nDu Bartas' works, particularly and often exclusively ''La Sepmaine'', were translated into numerous other European languages in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bellenger|last2= Ternaux|title=Bibliographie|pages=29\u201336}}</ref> There were translations into Latin (by Gabriel de Lerm (1583), Jean \u00c9douard Du Monin (1579), Hadrian Damman (1600) and Samuel Beno\u00eet (1609)), Italian (by Ferrante Guisone, first printed in 1592 and reprinted five times before 1613), Spanish (Joan Dessi, 1610, and Francisco de C\u00e1ceres in 1612) and German (Tobias H\u00fcbner, 1622 and 1631).

Trained as a doctor of law, he served in the court of [[Henry IV of France|Henri de Navarre]] for most of his career. Du Bartas was celebrated across sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe for his divine poetry, particularly ''L'Uranie ''(1584), ''Judit ''(1584), ''La Sepmaine; ou, Creation du monde'' (1578), and ''La Seconde Semaine'' (1584-1603).\n[[File:Le Bartas.jpg|framed|right|Ch\u00e2teau du Bartas (built 1569)]]\n\n== Life ==\nRelatively little is known about Du Bartas\u2019 life. Born in 1544, Guillaume Sallustre descended from a family of wealthy merchants in Montfort (in the [[Armagnac (province)|Armagnac]] region).<ref name=Bellenger>{{cite book|last1=Bellenger|first1=Yvonne|title=La Sepmaine (texte de 1581)|date=1981|location=Paris|pages=xix\u2013xxiii}}</ref> His family name later became \u2018Salluste\u2019 rather than 'Sallustre', perhaps to invite comparison with the Roman historian [[Sallust]]. He was possibly a student at [[College de Guyenne]] in Bordeaux ([[Montaigne|Michel de Montaigne]]\u2019s school), and studied law in Toulouse under [[Jacques Cujas]]: he became a doctor of law in 1567, and subsequently a judge in Montfort in 1571.<ref name=Bellenger /> He gained the lordship of nearby Bartas (becoming Sieur Du Bartas) on his father\u2019s death in 1566. He married Catherine de Manas, a local noblewoman, in 1570, and they had four daughters together: Anne, Jeanne, Marie and Isabeau.\n\nHe entered the service of [[Henri de Navarre]] in 1576, who would become Henri IV of France in 1589.<ref>{{Cite book|last = Pellissier|title=Du Bartas}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = Du Bartas et ses Divines Semaines|last = Bellenger|first = Yvonne|year = 1993|isbn = |location = Paris|pages = 15\u201324}}</ref> He was sent on various diplomatic missions, including to Montmorency in 1580, and Scotland and England in 1587. The poet left Scotland from [[Dumbarton Castle]] for [[La Rochelle]] laden with presents. [[James VI of Scotland|James Vi]] hired one of the best ships in the kingdom for him, knighted him, and gave him a gold chain, and 2000 [[\u00c9cu|gold crowns]], \"with a tablett of gold, having in itt his Majesties pourtraict\", besides several hackney horses and other presents from the nobility and courtiers.<ref>Edmund Lodge, ''Illustrations of British History'', vol. 2 (London, 1791), p. 352 no. 215.</ref>\n\nHe died in 1590, just weeks after composing a poem that celebrated Henri's victory at the [[Battle of Ivry]], though it is not thought that he fought in the battle.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bellenger|title=La Sepmaine|page=xxiii}}</ref>\n\nCh\u00e2teau Du Bartas, found in Saint Georges, was Du Bartas' residence in the later part of his life.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.au-chateau.com/Barthas.php|title = Ch\u00e2teau du Barthas |date = |accessdate = 11 November 2014|website = }}</ref> A statue of Du Bartas stands in a square named after him in [[Auch]], the historic capital of [[Gascony]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.monnuage.fr/point-d-interet/statue-du-bartas-a100888|title = Statue du Bartas|date = |accessdate = 11 November 2014|website = MonNuage}}</ref>\n\n== Poetry ==\n\n=== ''La muse chrestienne'' ===\nDu Bartas began writing poetry in the 1560s after being invited to do so by [[Jeanne d'Albret|Jeanne d'Albret de Navarre]]. His first collection, ''La muse chrestienne'' (1574) contains \u2018L\u2019Uranie\u2019, a verse prosopographia in which the Christian muse urges the poet to commit himself to composing serious poetry on scriptural themes. The other two items in the volume, the biblical epic ''Judit'' and 'Le Triomphe de la Foi', were examples of this new religious verse.\n\n=== The ''Semaines'' ===\nDu Bartas' masterpiece is his ''Semaines'' ('Weeks'), two epic poems which freely expand on the account in the [[Book of Genesis]] of the creation of the world and the first eras of world history. Each ''Semaine'' consists of individual ''jours'' (days) which can be read separately.\n\n==== ''La Semaine ou creation du Monde'' ====\n''La Semaine ou creation du Monde'' ('The Week, or creation of the World'), subsequently also known as ''La Premiere Sepmaine'' was first printed in Paris in 1578, and was immediately popular. ''La Sepmaine'' is a [[hexameral]] poem consisting of seven ''jours'', each containing around 700 lines, devoted to the aspect of the world created on that day in the first week. Because the poem's structure follows Genesis 1:1-8 closely, it is easy to navigate to particular sections; for example, readers wanting to find what Du Bartas writes about cuttlefish or mullet could know to turn to 'Le Cinquiesme Jour' (The Fifth Day) and in most editions would have had marginal annotations to help them locate the description of each creature.\n\n'Le Premier Jour' (The First Day) describes the creation of the world out of chaos (Du Bartas advocates the theory of creation ''[[ex nihilo]]'' - 'Nothing, but ''Nothing'' had the Lord Almighty, | Whereof, wherewith, whereby, to build this City' (Sylvester, I.i.228-29), forecasts the Day of Judgement and concludes with a discussion of angels. 'Le Second Jour' (The Second Day) concerns the creation of the four elements - water, air, earth and fire - and their meteorological effects. Land, seas and vegetation are created in 'Le Troisiesme Jour' (The Third Day). The earth is populated with particular species of natural life during the next three days: the sun, stars and seasons in 'Le Quatriesme Jour' (The Fourth Day); fish and birds in 'Le Cinquiesme Jour' (The Fifth Day); and land animals and human beings in 'Le Sixiesme Jour' (The Sixth Day). In 'Le Septiesme Jour' (The Seventh Day) Gods surveys the world he has created, and the poet meditates on the created world.[[File:Sallusti.png|thumb|La Sepmaine ou creation du Monde (1578)]]\n\n==== ''La Seconde Semaine'' ====\nFollowing the success of his First Week, Du Bartas embarked upon a sequel that would survey world history from Adam to the apocalypse, following the plan in Augustine's ''City of God''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Saint Augustine|title=City of God|origyear=1972|year= 2003|publisher=Penguin|page=1091 (Book 22, Chapter 30)}}</ref> He only completed four ''jours'', each divided into four parts, that covered the eras of Adam, Noah, Abraham and David (the final three were to cover [[Zedekiah]], the Messiah and the Eternal Sabbath).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sylvester|first1=Josuah|title=Devine Weekes and Workes|date=1621|page=Q6v}}</ref>\n\nThe first two ''jours'' of ''La Seconde Semaine'' were first printed in 1584. 'Le Premier Jour' (the era of Adam) contains 'Eden' (II.i.1) describing the Garden of Paradise; 'L'Imposture' ('The Imposture' in Sylvester's translation, II.i.2) which relates the Fall of Man; 'Les Furies' ('The Furies', II.i.3) which describes the diseases, conflicts and vices that plague mankind; and 'Les Artifices' ('The Handy Crafts', II.i.4) which is about the various crafts that humankind learnt, and Cain and Abel. 'Le Second Jour' (Noah) consists of 'L'Arche' ('The Arke', II.ii.1) retelling the Great Flood; 'Babylone' ('Babylon', II.ii.2) about the [[Tower of Babel]] and European literary cultures; 'Les Colonies' ('The Colonies', Ii.ii.3) which describes the spread of different tribes across the world; and 'Les Colomnes' ('The Columnes', II.ii.4) in which the tale (originally found in [[Josephus]]) of [[Seth]] writing scientific and astronomical knowledge on two pillars to safeguard it against fire and flood is a point of departure for a review of learning in those areas.\n\n''Les Suites de la Second Semaine,'' containing the third and fourth ''jours'', were printed in parts between 1591 and 1603. James VI of Scotland received a manuscript copy containing six of the eight sections of the ''Suites'' (including a version of 'Les Peres' with 830 lines not found in the printed texts) in the late 1580s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Auger|first=Peter|date=2016|title=Le Manuscrit Royal de la Suite de la Seconde Semaine de Du Bartas|url=|journal=Biblioth\u00e8que d'Humanisme et Renaissance|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> 'Le Troisieme Jour' continues the narrative into the age of Abraham: La Vocation ('The Vocation', II.iii.1) and 'Les Peres' ('The Fathers', II.iii.2) cover the end of the Book of Genesis in relating the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] and the sacrifice of [[Isaac]] respectively, while 'La Loy' ('The Law', II.iii.3) moves into the Exodus narrative and 'Les Captaines' ('The Captains', II.iii.4) to [[Joshua]] and [[Samuel]]. 'Le Quatrieme Jour' is devoted to [[David]]: 'Les Trophees' ('The Trophies', II.iv.1), 'La Magnificence' ('The Magnificence', II.iv.2) is about [[Solomon]], and the final two completed sections, 'Le Schisme' ('The Schism', II.iv.3) and finally 'La Decadence' ('The Decay', II.iv.4), reviews the monarchs of the [[Books of Kings]] and [[Book of Chronicles]].\n\n=== Miscellaneous Poems ===\n\nBesides ''Le muse chrestienne'' and the two ''Semaines,'' Du Bartas wrote a number of occasional poems and lyrics.  Among these are two of some length, about battles that occurred in the author's lifetime: 'Cantique d'Yvry' ('Song of Ivry'), on the [[Battle of Ivry]] (1590), not long before the poet's death, and 'La Lepanthe' ('Lepanto'), a translation of [[James VI and I|James VI]]'s poem on the [[Battle of Lepanto]] (1571).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Holmes |title=Works of Du Bartas |date=1940 |page=III:490\u2013526}}  King James' original poem was published in ''His Majesties Poeticall Exercises,'' ed.

See Holmes (1940), ''Works of Du Bartas,'' III:506.</ref>\n\n== Reputation ==\n\n===France===\n''La Sepmaine'' was instantly successful in France: there were 42 editions between 1578 and 1632, often printed with [[Simon Goulart]]'s marginal annotations and commentary.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Holmes|title=Works of Du Bartas|page=I.77|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Du Bartas was the most highly esteemed French poet in France at the turn of the seventeenth century, even more so than [[Ronsard]], and in 1620 was still regarded as the apogee of French 'grand poesie'.<ref name=\"Garapon\">{{cite journal|last1=Garapon|title=Sur la Renomm\u00e9e posthume de Ronsard et de Du Bartas|pages=53\u201359}}</ref> However, there were no further French editions of the ''Semaines'' after 1630.<ref name=\"Garapon\" /> What were once regarded as the stylistic merits of Du Bartas' were later deemed to be weaknesses: his use of compound epithets, duplication of initial syllables, frequent inclusion of metaphors and similes and a highly compressed and accumulative style all contributed to a sense that his poetry was over-wrought and over-elaborate.\n\nNonetheless there were over thirty poems influenced by Du Bartas printed in France between 1601 and 1697, including direct continuations or parodies such as Christophe de Gamon's ''La Sepmaine'' (1609) and A. D\u2019Argent's ''Sepmaine'' (1629), and printed references praising Du Bartas in works written throughout this period.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Magnien|first1=Michel|title='Du Bartas en France au XVIIe si\u00e8cle' in Du Bartas: 1590\u20131990|date=1992|location=Mont-de-Marsan|pages=69\u201380}}</ref> As late as 1684 [[Madeleine de Scud\u00e9ry]] recalled the often-cited anecdote that Ronsard had once remarked that Du Bartas had achieved more in a week than he had in his entire life.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Magnien|title=Du Bartas en France|pages=55, 75}}</ref> Du Bartas was, however, an object of criticism: he was, for example, cited for examples of mistakes to avoid in a ''Br\u00e8ve instruction'' (1667). Du Bartas' reputation remained low in subsequent centuries: in 1842 [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]] wrote that Du Bartas \u2018a pu s\u2019\u00e9garer et c\u00e9der au mauvais go\u00fbt de son temps dans le gros de ces oeuvres\u2019 (\u2018was led astray and gave into the poor taste of his times in most of his work\u2019).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sainte-Beuve|first1=Charles Augustin|date=1842|title=Anciens Po\u00e8tes Fran\u00e7ais: Du Bartas|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k86880r/f550|journal=Revue des Deux Mondes|volume=29|pages=549\u201375|via=Gallica}}</ref>\n\nThough Du Bartas is still not widely known in France today, critical re-appraisals in the twentieth century, led by James Dauphin\u00e9, Yvonne Bellenger and other, have shown how Du Bartas' encyclopedic writing was representative of its time and is still worthy of attention.\n\n===Scotland===\n[[James VI]] of [[Scotland]]'s enthusiasm for Du Bartas made the Frenchman's poetry uniquely popular in sixteenth-century Scotland. James possessed a copy of ''La Sepmaine'' given to him by his nurse,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Warner|first1=George Frederick|title=The Library of James VI, 1573\u20131583|date=1893|location=Edinburgh|page=xliii}}</ref> and a year later wrote in the preface to his ''Essayes of a Prentise'' (Edinburgh, 1584) that\n\n:Hauing oft reuolued, and red ouer (fauorable Reader) the booke and Poems of the deuine and Illuster Poete, Salust du Bartas, I was moved by the oft reading & perusing of them, with a restles and lofty desire, to preas to attaine to the like vertue. (''Essayes'', C3r)\n\nThe volume contained James's Scots translation of ''L'Uranie''. Du Bartas' synthesis of sacred and secular verse matched the King's own aesthetic preferences, and also his political imperative to consolidate his divine and political authority. The King shared Urania's sense that more poets should write about the highest matters:\n\n:O ye that wolde your browes with Laurel bind,\n:What larger feild I pray you can you find,\n:Then is his praise, who brydles heavens most cleare\n:Makes mountaines tremble, and howest hells to feare?\n\n[[Thomas Hudson (poet)|Thomas Hudson]], a court musician, was (so he writes in the preface) commissioned by the King to prepare a translation of ''Judit'', which was printed in 1584 with prefatory sonnets by James and others. Du Bartas was evidently quickly made aware of the King's attention, for a publisher's contract which Du Bartas signed in 1585 mentions printing the King's translation (as well as Du Bartas\u2019 translation of the King's \u2018Ane Schort Poeme of Tyme\u2019).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Holmes |title=Works of Du Bartas|page=I. 205\u20136}}</ref>\n\nDu Bartas and James subsequently met in the summer of 1587 when the French poet travelled on a diplomatic mission to Scotland, via the English Court, to propose a marriage match between James and [[Henry IV of France|Henri de Navarre]]\u2019s sister, [[Catherine de Bourbon]]. Though the match never happened, Du Bartas remained in high esteem with James: he received expensive gifts on departure, and the King invited him to return.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Auger|title=Du Bartas' Visit to England and Scotland}}</ref> It may well have been during this visit that Du Bartas translated James\u2019 mini-epic on [[The Battle of Lepanto]] which was printed alongside James\u2019 original poem and his translation of \u2018Les Furies\u2019 in his ''[[Poeticall Exercises at Vacant Houres]]'' (1591).\n\nPoets writing at the Jacobean Court (members of the so-called \"[[Castalian Band]]\") all knew of Du Bartas, who was \u2018aesthetically and ideologically a role-model for James\u2019 and \u2018emblematic of the direction, spiritually, philosophically and aesthetically, in which James sought to lead his imagined renaissance\u2019 (Sarah Dunnigan) at the Scottish Court.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dunnigan|first1=Sarah|title=Eros and Poetry at the Courts of Mary Queen of Scots and James VI|date=2002|location=Basingstoke|pages=5}}</ref> [[William Fowler (makar)|William Fowler]]<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Craigie |editor-first1=James|title=Thomas Hudson's Historie of Judith|date=1941|location=Edinburgh and London|pages=4}}</ref> and [[John Stewart of Baldynneis]]<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Crockett |editor-first1=Thomas|title=Poems of John Stewart of Baldynneis|pages=II, p. 196}}</ref> are two poets who refer to Urania as a symbolic figurehead for the kind of poetic inspiration to which they aspired in vain. Hadrian Damman's Latin translation was dedicated to James when printed in 1600 (a manuscript copy dated 1596 also survives, National Library of Scotland MS Adv. 19.2.10).<ref>{{cite web|title=English Short Title Catalogue|url=http://estc.bl.uk/S116418}}</ref> [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]], [[William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling|William Alexander]] and [[Zachary Boyd]] are three seventeenth-century Scottish poets who knew Du Bartas\u2019 works well; the latter two imitate his works (Sylvester's translation in Boyd's case) extensively.\n\nJames had a major impact on English responses both before and after his accession to the English throne. Gabriel Harvey is one of numerous writers in London who were reading James' translation in the 1590s: when Harvey praised Du Bartas as the \u2018Treasurer of Humanity and 'Ieweller of Diuinity\u2019 and \u2018a right inspired, and enravished Poet\u2019 in the preface to ''Pierces Supererogation'' (1593) and other works, he was in part drawing on notes made in his copy of James's ''Essayes''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Relle|first1=Eleanor|title=Some New Marginalia and Poems of Gabriel Harvey|journal=Review of English Studies|date=1972|volume=23|pages=401\u201316}}</ref> A passage in the King's ''[[Basilikon Doron]]'' exhorting more poets to 'bee well versed' in Du Bartas' poetry<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Craigie |editor-first1=James|title=Basilicon Doron|date=1944|location=Edinburgh and London|pages=I, p. 199}}</ref> was cited, for instance, by [[Thomas Winter (M.A.)|Thomas Winter]] in the dedicatory epistle of his translation of the ''Third Dayes Creation'' (1604). [[Joshua Sylvester]] dedicated his translation ''Devine Weekes and Workes'' (1605) to James, having presented a manuscript extract to the King in the previous year.\n\n===England===\nDu Bartas was extremely popular in early modern England, and was still being read widely in the later seventeenth century even as his reputation in France began to decline. Around two hundred texts printed in England before 1700 make direct reference to Du Bartas, including seventy-five from the period 1641-1700.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Auger|title=Snapshots|pages=3\u20134, 8}}</ref> There were numerous translations of sections of the ''Semaines'' into English, of which the most significant is [[Josuah Sylvester]]'s ''Devine Weekes and Workes'' (1605 et seq.; re-printed six times by 1641). Du Bartas was quickly regarded as a divine epic poet whose works took their place among the great European classics: [[Gabriel Harvey]], for example, compared Du Bartas to Homer, Virgil and Dante.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Relle|first1=Eleanor|title=Some New Marginalia and Poems of Gabriel Harvey|journal=Review of English Studies|date=1972|volume=23|pages=403, 411}}</ref>\n\n[[Sir Philip Sidney]] apparently admired Du Bartas' works later in life, and his translation of 'Salust Du Bartas' was entered into the Stationers\u2019 Register in 1588, but is now unknown.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ringler|first1=William A.|title=The Poems of Philip Sidney|date=1962|location=Oxford|page=339}}</ref> Du Bartas had in effect synthesized the two highest forms of poetry, divine and philosophical, described in Sidney's ''[[An Apology for Poetry|Apology for Poetry]]''. S. K. Heninger, reflecting on similarities between Sidney and Du Bartas\u2019 conception of poetry, writes that: \u2018the reader could ponder the wide-ranging mysteries of creation. He could contemplate God\u2019s intention, His methods, His results. The text is characterized by a Protestant passion for the truth\u2014the truth, at once universal and concrete.

Jensen-tribunen (North) and Carlsberg-tribunen (West). Three stands are all-seaters (except the away section on the North End) while the South End is terracing. Each stand has two tiers.\n\n=== Sydsiden (South End) ===\nSydsiden, literally \"South Side\" in English, was inaugurated as the new South Stand on 29 March 1992 in a match against [[Lyngby Boldklub]], due to a rise in interest for Br\u00f8ndby IF.<ref name=\"FiB07\"/><ref name=Sydsiden2>{{cite web |url=https://sydsiden.brondby.com/ |title=Sydsiden 25 \u00e5r |date=15 March 2017 |publisher=Br\u00f8ndby IF |accessdate=15 March}}</ref> The lower part of the stand has a standing capacity of 5,600 spectators.

This had to change as there was a conflict of interest as [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] moved in as new sponsors. Sydsiden was chosen by a panel representing a broad section of the active fan base at Br\u00f8ndby Stadion, as fans had called the stand this before.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://brondby.com/nyhed/2011/01/18/faxe-tribunen-bliver-til-sydsiden |title=Faxe-tribunen bliver til Sydsiden |date=18 January 2011 |publisher=Br\u00f8ndby IF |accessdate=4 March 2017}}</ref> Halfway through the 2017\u201318 season, the hole in the middle of the stand was partly closed, after continuous requests by fans.<ref name=\"VaerMed\"/>\n\nA permanent fanzone was inaugurated outside Sydsiden in 2018 for spectators and fans before, during and after the games. The fanzone is the first of its kind in Scandinavia, and consists of stands for live concerts, bars, foodstands and toilet facilities.\n\nSydsiden popularised the \"Fenerbah\u00e7e greeting\" in Denmark, imported through the transfer of [[Brian Steen Nielsen]] to the Turkish club. A cooperation between goalkeeper [[Mogens Krogh]] and [[Br\u00f8ndby IF#Support|Br\u00f8ndby Support]] effectually made the greeting get foothold in Denmark.<ref name=Sydsiden/>\n\n=== North End ===\nThe North Stand, now known as \"J. Jensen-tribunen\" for sponsorship reasons, was originally known as \"da:OBS!-tribunen\". The lower section of the stand was constructed in 1992 as terracing, and has among fans been known as \"P\u00f8lseenden\" ({{lang-da|[[:da:Rosinen i p\u00f8lseenden|the sausage end]]}}) due to its former major sponsor, sausage producer Steff-Houlberg. Fans from the away team are assigned a section on this stand, usually in the eastern part of the North Stand, separated from Br\u00f8ndby's home fans.\n\n=== West Stand ===\nThe West Stand, known as \"[[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]]-tribunen\", was originally named \"Frisko-tribunen and later also \"SAS-tribunen\" and \"Apollo-tribunen\". The original part of the stand was completed in 1979 as the first stand of the stadium, and it has been preserved through the large expansion in 1999\u20132000. It can also accommodate a few fans in executive boxes and hospitality suites, and is the ground's main grandstand.\n\n=== East Stand ===\nThe East Stand, now known as \"GSV-tribunen\" for sponsorship reasons, was formerly called \"LOXAM-tribunen\", \"[[Codan]]-tribunen and \"DNE-tribunen\". The lower section of the stand was constructed in 1982 and 1990. The East Stand was originally without a roof, and consisted of terraces. Today, it is the largest stand of Br\u00f8ndby Stadion with a total of 34 rows of seats. In 2006, a larger extension was established behind the stand from the facade, consisting of sponsor facilities, a sports bar and classrooms for Br\u00f8ndby Gymnasium. The classrooms were inaugurated on 8 January 2007. In April 2018, a new family lounge was opened behind the East Stand with both physical and Esports facilities.\n\n==Transportation==\nThe easiest way of getting to the stadium with public transport is with the [[S-tog]] or S-train. Line B (green) will stop at both Br\u00f8ndby\u00f8ster and Glostrup stations, where there are shuttle buses on match days. One can also walk from the stations, with the walk taking 15 minutes from Glostrup, and slightly longer from Br\u00f8ndby\u00f8ster.\n\n==National games==\nBr\u00f8ndby Stadion has been used five times as home ground for the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national team]]. Further it has been the venue of four youth national matches and a league national match:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dbu.dk/page.aspx?id=5641 |title=Landsholdsdatabasen |publisher=[[Danish Football Association]] |accessdate=2010-03-01 |language=Danish }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|-\n!Date\n!Home team\n!Res.\n!Away team\n!Competition\n!Spectators\n|-\n|11 September 1982||[[Denmark national under-19 football team|Denmark U-19]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\u20130||[[West Germany national under-19 football team|West Germany U-19]]||[[Friendly match]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|?\n|-\n|5 May 1984||[[Denmark national under-19 football team|Denmark U-19]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\u20131||[[East Germany national under-19 football team|East Germany U-19]]||[[Friendly match]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|?\n|-\n|19 November 1986||[[Denmark national under-17 football team|Denmark U-17]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\u20130||[[Cyprus national under-17 football team|Cyprus U-17]]||[[1987 UEFA European Under-16 Football Championship]] qualifying||style=\"text-align:center;\"|?\n|-\n|6 March 2002||[[Denmark League XI national football team|Denmark League XI]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\u20131||[[Norway League XI national football team|Norway League XI]]||Non-official match||style=\"text-align:center;\"|?\n|-\n|1 September 2006||[[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\u20132||[[Portugal national football team|Portugal]]||[[Friendly match]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|13,186\n|-\n|19 November 2008||[[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\u20131||[[Wales national football team|Wales]]||[[Friendly match]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|10,271\n|-\n|12 August 2009||[[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\u20132||[[Chile national football team|Chile]]||[[Friendly match]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|8,700\n|-\n|30 May 2013||[[Denmark national under-19 football team|Denmark U-19]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\u20131||[[Germany national under-19 football team|Germany U-19]]||[[Friendly match]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|1,060\n|-\n|6 June 2017||[[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\u20131||[[German national football team|Germany]]||[[Friendly match]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|15,488\n|-\n|22 March 2018||[[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\u20130||[[Panama national football team|Panama]]||[[Friendly match]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|11,150\n|-\n|7 June 2020||[[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|-||[[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]||[[Friendly match]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* {{cite book |last1=Barnak |first1=S\u00f8ren |title=Br\u00f8ndby IF --fordi de ville! : Br\u00f8ndbyernes Idr\u00e6tsforening 1964-2004 |year=2004 |publisher=Br\u00f8nden |isbn=8790667042 |edition=1. udgave}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Laursen Brock |first1=Jeppe |title=Br\u00f8ndby IF : historien om drengene fra Vestegnen |date=2011 |publisher=Gyldendal |location=K\u00f8benhavn K |isbn=978-87-02-10258-1 |edition=1. udgave, 1. oplag}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Rasmussen |first1=Jens Jam |title=Formanden.

It is the second largest stadium in [[Denmark]]. Built in 1965 and inaugurated on 31 June 1966 where it had no stands, it saw a major redevelopment in 2000 which increased capacity to 31,500 spectators, of which 19,700 were seated. Continuous adjustments to the spectator facilities have since resulted in the stadium having a total capacity of 28,000 spectators, of which 23,400 are seated. Record attendance dates to 18 June 2003, where a crowd of 31,508 were present in a [[Copenhagen Derby]] against [[F.C. Copenhagen]].\n\nWhen hosting the [[UEFA]] competitions [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] and [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]], seats are installed on the South End [[Terrace (stadium)|terraces]] ({{lang-da|Sydsiden}}) in accordance with UEFA regulations, which reduces the total capacity to 26,000.\n\nThe stadium has also hosted the [[Denmark national football team]] in five matches.

Jensen-tribunen (North) and Carlsberg-tribunen (West). Three stands are all-seaters (except the away section on the North End) while the South End is terracing. Each stand has two tiers.\n\n=== Sydsiden (South End) ===\nSydsiden, literally \"South Side\" in English, was inaugurated as the new South Stand on 29 March 1992 in a match against [[Lyngby Boldklub]], due to a rise in interest for Br\u00f8ndby IF.<ref name=\"FiB07\"/><ref name=Sydsiden2>{{cite web |url=https://sydsiden.brondby.com/ |title=Sydsiden 25 \u00e5r |date=15 March 2017 |publisher=Br\u00f8ndby IF |accessdate=15 March}}</ref> The lower part of the stand has a standing capacity of 5,600 spectators.

This had to change as there was a conflict of interest as [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] moved in as new sponsors. Sydsiden was chosen by a panel representing a broad section of the active fan base at Br\u00f8ndby Stadion, as fans had called the stand this before.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://brondby.com/nyhed/2011/01/18/faxe-tribunen-bliver-til-sydsiden |title=Faxe-tribunen bliver til Sydsiden |date=18 January 2011 |publisher=Br\u00f8ndby IF |accessdate=4 March 2017}}</ref> Halfway through the 2017\u201318 season, the hole in the middle of the stand was partly closed, after continuous requests by fans.<ref name=\"VaerMed\"/>\n\nA permanent fanzone was inaugurated outside Sydsiden in 2018 for spectators and fans before, during and after the games. The fanzone is the first of its kind in Scandinavia, and consists of stands for live concerts, bars, foodstands and toilet facilities.\n\nSydsiden popularised the \"Fenerbah\u00e7e greeting\" in Denmark, imported through the transfer of [[Brian Steen Nielsen]] to the Turkish club. A cooperation between goalkeeper [[Mogens Krogh]] and [[Br\u00f8ndby IF#Support|Br\u00f8ndby Support]] effectually made the greeting get foothold in Denmark.<ref name=Sydsiden/>\n\n=== North End ===\nThe North Stand, now known as \"J. Jensen-tribunen\" for sponsorship reasons, was originally known as \"da:OBS!-tribunen\". The lower section of the stand was constructed in 1992 as terracing, and has among fans been known as \"P\u00f8lseenden\" ({{lang-da|[[:da:Rosinen i p\u00f8lseenden|the sausage end]]}}) due to its former major sponsor, sausage producer Steff-Houlberg. Fans from the away team are assigned a section on this stand, usually in the eastern part of the North Stand, seperated from Br\u00f8ndby's home fans.\n\n=== West Stand ===\nThe West Stand, known as \"[[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]]-tribunen\", was originally named \"Frisko-tribunen and later also \"SAS-tribunen\" and \"Apollo-tribunen\". The original part of the stand was completed in 1979 as the first stand of the stadium, and it has been preserved through the large expansion in 1999\u20132000. It can also accommodate a few fans in executive boxes and hospitality suites, and is the ground's main grandstand.\n\n=== East Stand ===\nThe East Stand, now known as \"GSV-tribunen\" for sponsorship reasons, was formerly called \"LOXAM-tribunen\", \"[[Codan]]-tribunen and \"DNE-tribunen\". The lower section of the stand was constructed in 1982 and 1990. The East Stand was originally without a roof, and consisted of terraces. Today, it is the largest stand of Br\u00f8ndby Stadion with a total of 34 rows of seats. In 2006, a larger extension was established behind the stand from the facade, consisting of sponsor facilities, a sports bar and classrooms for Br\u00f8ndby Gymnasium. The classrooms were inaugurated on 8 January 2007. In April 2018, a new family lounge was opened behind the East Stand with both physical and Esports facilities.\n\n==Transportation==\nThe easiest way of getting to the stadium with public transport is with the [[S-tog]] or S-train. Line B (green) will stop at both Br\u00f8ndby\u00f8ster and Glostrup stations, where there are shuttle buses on match days. One can also walk from the stations, with the walk taking 15 minutes from Glostrup, and slightly longer from Br\u00f8ndby\u00f8ster.\n\n==National games==\nBr\u00f8ndby Stadion has been used five times as home ground for the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national team]]. Further it has been the venue of four youth national matches and a league national match:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dbu.dk/page.aspx?id=5641 |title=Landsholdsdatabasen |publisher=[[Danish Football Association]] |accessdate=2010-03-01 |language=Danish }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|-\n!Date\n!Home team\n!Res.\n!Away team\n!Competition\n!Spectators\n|-\n|11 September 1982||[[Denmark national under-19 football team|Denmark U-19]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\u20130||[[West Germany national under-19 football team|West Germany U-19]]||[[Friendly match]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|?\n|-\n|5 May 1984||[[Denmark national under-19 football team|Denmark U-19]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\u20131||[[East Germany national under-19 football team|East Germany U-19]]||[[Friendly match]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|?\n|-\n|19 November 1986||[[Denmark national under-17 football team|Denmark U-17]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\u20130||[[Cyprus national under-17 football team|Cyprus U-17]]||[[1987 UEFA European Under-16 Football Championship]] qualifying||style=\"text-align:center;\"|?\n|-\n|6 March 2002||[[Denmark League XI national football team|Denmark League XI]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\u20131||[[Norway League XI national football team|Norway League XI]]||Non-official match||style=\"text-align:center;\"|?\n|-\n|1 September 2006||[[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\u20132||[[Portugal national football team|Portugal]]||[[Friendly match]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|13,186\n|-\n|19 November 2008||[[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\u20131||[[Wales national football team|Wales]]||[[Friendly match]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|10,271\n|-\n|12 August 2009||[[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\u20132||[[Chile national football team|Chile]]||[[Friendly match]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|8,700\n|-\n|30 May 2013||[[Denmark national under-19 football team|Denmark U-19]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\u20131||[[Germany national under-19 football team|Germany U-19]]||[[Friendly match]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|1,060\n|-\n|6 June 2017||[[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\u20131||[[German national football team|Germany]]||[[Friendly match]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|15,488\n|-\n|22 March 2018||[[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\u20130||[[Panama national football team|Panama]]||[[Friendly match]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|11,150\n|-\n|7 June 2020||[[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|-||[[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]||[[Friendly match]]||style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* {{cite book |last1=Barnak |first1=S\u00f8ren |title=Br\u00f8ndby IF --fordi de ville! : Br\u00f8ndbyernes Idr\u00e6tsforening 1964-2004 |year=2004 |publisher=Br\u00f8nden |isbn=8790667042 |edition=1. udgave}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Laursen Brock |first1=Jeppe |title=Br\u00f8ndby IF : historien om drengene fra Vestegnen |date=2011 |publisher=Gyldendal |location=K\u00f8benhavn K |isbn=978-87-02-10258-1 |edition=1. udgave, 1. oplag}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Rasmussen |first1=Jens Jam |title=Formanden.

The state bordered the [[Gilgit Agency]] to the south and the former princely state of [[Nagar (princely state)|Nagar]] to the east. The state capital was the town of Baltit (also known as [[Karimabad (Hunza)|Karimabad]]); another old settlement is [[Ganish Village]] which means \"ancient gold\" village. Hunza was an independent principality for more than 900 years until the [[British Raj|British]] gained control of it and the neighboring valley of Nagar between 1889 and 1891 through military conquest. The then [[Tham (title)|Mir/Tham]] (ruler), branch of [[Katoor Dynasty|Katur Dynasty]], Safdar Khan of Hunza fled to [[Kashghar]] in China and sought what would now be called political asylum.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Valley|first1=Hunza|title=Hunza Valley|url=http://www.skardu.pk/hunza-valley/|website=www.skardu.pk|publisher=Skardu.pk|accessdate=23 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Mir/Tham===\n{{main|Mir of Hunza}}\n\nAn account wrote by John Biddulph in his book ''[[Tribes of the Hindoo Koosh]]'' {{cquote|The ruling family of Hunza is called Ayesha (heavenly).

After the introduction of [[Islam]] to Gilgit, married a daughter of Trakhan of [[Gilgit]], who bore him twin sons, named Moghlot and Girkis. From the former, the present ruling family of Nager is descended. The twins are said to have shown hostility to one another from birth. Thereupon their father, unable to settle the question of succession, divided his state between them, giving Girkis the north/west, and to Moghlot the south/east bank of the river.<ref>Tribes of the Hindoo Koosh by John Biddulph page 26</ref>}}\n\n===2010 landslide===\nIn 2010, a landslide blocked the river and created [[Attabad Lake]] (also called shishket Lake), resulting in 20 deaths and 8 injuries and has effectively blocked about {{convert|26|km}} of the [[Karakoram Highway]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Waheed |first1=Abdul |title=The Attabad Landslide Disaster |url=https://pamirtimes.net/2013/01/04/the-attabad-landslide-disaster/ |accessdate=12 October 2019 |publisher=Pamir Times |date=4 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=SHISHKET LAKE CRISES \u2013 2010 \u2013 CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS |url=http://www.ndma.gov.pk/new/aboutus/SHISHKET_lake_2010.pdf |website=ndma.gov.pk |publisher=[[National Disaster Management Authority (Pakistan)|NDMA]] |accessdate=12 October 2019 |date=27 July 2010}}</ref> The new lake extends {{convert|30|km|mi}} and rose to a depth of {{convert|400|ft|m}} when it was formed as the Hunza River backed up.<ref name=\"fourworlds_HiMaT_2013\">{{cite web | url=http://www.fourworlds.ca/documents/ASecondGreenRevolution.pdf | title=Needed: a second green revolution in Hunza | publisher=HiMaT | date=May 2013 | accessdate=26 November 2015 | pages=4 | author1=Michael Bopp | author2=Judie Bopp}} Karakorum Area Development Organization (KADO), Aliabad</ref> The landslide completely covered sections of the Karakoram Highway.<ref name=\"fourworlds_HiMaT_2013\" />\n\n===2018 Rescue mission===\n[[File:Hunza Tunnel.jpg|thumb|right|Tunnel]]\nOn 1 July 2018, [[Pakistan Army]] pilots in a daring mission rescued 3 foreign mountaineers stuck in snow avalanche at above the height of {{Convert|19000|ft}} on [[Ultar Sar|Ultar Sar Peak]] near Hunza.

The state bordered the [[Gilgit Agency]] to the south and the former princely state of [[Nagar (princely state)|Nagar]] to the east. The state capital was the town of Baltit (also known as [[Karimabad (Hunza)|Karimabad]]); another old settlement is [[Ganish Village]] which means \"ancient gold\" village. Hunza was an independent principality for more than 900 years until the [[British Raj|British]] gained control of it and the neighboring valley of Nagar between 1889 and 1891 through military conquest. The then [[Tham (title)|Mir/Tham]] (ruler), branch of [[Katoor Dynasty|Katur Dynasty]], Safdar Khan of Hunza fled to [[Kashghar]] in China and sought what would now be called political asylum.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Valley|first1=Hunza|title=Hunza Valley|url=http://www.skardu.pk/hunza-valley/|website=www.skardu.pk|publisher=Skardu.pk|accessdate=23 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Mir/Tham===\n{{main|Mir of Hunza}}\n\nAn account wrote by John Biddulph in his book ''[[Tribes of the Hindoo Koosh]]'' {{cquote|The ruling family of Hunza is called Ayesha (heavenly). The two states of [[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]] and [[Nagar (princely state)|Nagar]] were formerly one, ruled by a branch of the Shahreis, the ruling family of [[Gilgit]], whose seat of government was Nager. First muslim came to Hunza-Nagar Valley some 1000 years (At the time of Imam Isl\u0101m Sh\u0101h 30th Imam Ismaili Muslims). After the introduction of [[Islam]] to Gilgit, married a daughter of Trakhan of [[Gilgit]], who bore him twin sons, named Moghlot and Girkis. From the former, the present ruling family of Nager is descended. The twins are said to have shown hostility to one another from birth. Thereupon their father, unable to settle the question of succession, divided his state between them, giving Girkis the north/west, and to Moghlot the south/east bank of the river.<ref>Tribes of the Hindoo Koosh by John Biddulph page 26</ref>}}\n\n===2010 landslide===\nIn 2010, a landslide blocked the river and created [[Attabad Lake]] (also called shishket Lake), resulting in 20 deaths and 8 injuries and has effectively blocked about {{convert|26|km}} of the [[Karakoram Highway]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Waheed |first1=Abdul |title=The Attabad Landslide Disaster |url=https://pamirtimes.net/2013/01/04/the-attabad-landslide-disaster/ |accessdate=12 October 2019 |publisher=Pamir Times |date=4 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=SHISHKET LAKE CRISES \u2013 2010 \u2013 CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS |url=http://www.ndma.gov.pk/new/aboutus/SHISHKET_lake_2010.pdf |website=ndma.gov.pk |publisher=[[National Disaster Management Authority (Pakistan)|NDMA]] |accessdate=12 October 2019 |date=27 July 2010}}</ref> The new lake extends {{convert|30|km|mi}} and rose to a depth of {{convert|400|ft|m}} when it was formed as the Hunza River backed up.<ref name=\"fourworlds_HiMaT_2013\">{{cite web | url=http://www.fourworlds.ca/documents/ASecondGreenRevolution.pdf | title=Needed: a second green revolution in Hunza | publisher=HiMaT | date=May 2013 | accessdate=26 November 2015 | pages=4 | author1=Michael Bopp | author2=Judie Bopp}} Karakorum Area Development Organization (KADO), Aliabad</ref> The landslide completely covered sections of the Karakoram Highway.<ref name=\"fourworlds_HiMaT_2013\" />\n\n===2018 Rescue mission===\n[[File:Hunza Tunnel.jpg|thumb|right|Tunnel]]\nOn 1 July 2018, [[Pakistan Army]] pilots in a daring mission rescued 3 foreign mountaineers stuck in snow avalanche at above the height of {{Convert|19000|ft}} on [[Ultar Sar|Ultar Sar Peak]] near Hunza.
