Shaw's version was released as a single, but did not match the success of Hopkin's version.\n\nAt the peak of the song's success, a New York company used the melody in a commercial for Rokeach [[gefilte fish]], arguing that the tune was an old Russian folk-tune and thus in the public domain. (The commercial included the line \"The perfect dish, Rokeach Gefilte Fish\" where the English-language song would go \"Those were the days, oh yes, those were the days.\") Raskin successfully sued and won a settlement, since he had slightly altered the tune to fit his lyrics and had taken out the valid new copyright.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIn the mid-1970s, after Hopkin's contract with Apple ended, \"Those Were the Days\" and \"Goodbye\" were re-recorded with producer [[Tony Visconti]], whom she had married in 1971. These re-recorded versions can be found on music compilations.\n\nOn 25 October 2010, Apple Records released ''[[Come and Get It: The Best of Apple Records]]'', which included the original recordings of \"Those Were the Days\" and \"Goodbye\".

In the United States, Hopkin's recording reached number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] (held out of the top spot for three weeks by \"[[Hey Jude]]\" by [[The Beatles]]) and topped the Billboard [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Easy Listening]] charts for six weeks.<ref>{{cite book|first= Joel |last= Whitburn |authorlink= Joel Whitburn |title= Top Adult Contemporary: 1961-2001 |year= 2002 |publisher= Record Research |page= 118}}</ref> In the Netherlands, it topped the charts for two consecutive weeks.<ref name=\"NL\"/> The Russian origin of the melody was accentuated by an instrumentation that was unusual for a top-ten pop record, including [[balalaika]], [[clarinet]], [[hammered dulcimer]] or [[cimbalom]], [[tenor banjo]] and children's chorus, giving a [[klezmer]] feel to the song. Mary Hopkin played acoustic guitar on the recording, and [[Paul McCartney]] also played acoustic guitar and possibly percussion.

Shaw's version was released as a single, but did not match the success of Hopkin's version.\n\nAt the peak of the song's success, a New York company used the melody in a commercial for Rokeach [[gefilte fish]], arguing that the tune was an old Russian folk-tune and thus in the public domain. (The commercial included the line \"The perfect dish, Rokeach Gefilte Fish\" where the English-language song would go \"Those were the days, oh yes, those were the days.\") Raskin successfully sued and won a settlement, since he had slightly altered the tune to fit his lyrics and had taken out the valid new copyright.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIn the mid-1970s, after Hopkin's contract with Apple ended, \"Those Were the Days\" and \"Goodbye\" were re-recorded with producer [[Tony Visconti]], whom she had married in 1971. These re-recorded versions can be found on music compilations.\n\nOn 25 October 2010, Apple Records released ''[[Come and Get It: The Best of Apple Records]]'', which included the original recordings of \"Those Were the Days\" and \"Goodbye\".

Most gemstones are hard, but some soft minerals are used in jewelry because of their [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]] or other physical properties that have [[aesthetic value]]. Rarity is another characteristic that lends value to a gemstone.\n\nApart from jewelry, from earliest antiquity [[engraved gem]]s and [[hardstone carving]]s, such as cups, were major luxury art forms. A gem maker is called a [[lapidary]] or [[gemcutter]]; a [[diamond]] cutter is called a [[diamantaire]].\n\n==Characteristics and classification==\n[[File:Gem.pebbles.800pix.labelled.jpg|thumb|250px|A selection of gemstone pebbles made by tumbling rough rock with abrasive grit, in a rotating drum. The biggest pebble here is {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} long.]]\n\nThe traditional classification in the West, which goes back to the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], begins with a distinction between ''precious'' and ''semi-precious''; similar distinctions are made in other cultures. In modern use the precious stones are [[diamond]], [[ruby]], [[sapphire]] and [[emerald]], with all other gemstones being semi-precious.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=crc7ZtRHItgC&pg=PA1 ''Precious Stones''], Max Bauer, p. 2</ref> This distinction reflects the rarity of the respective stones in ancient times, as well as their quality: all are  [[translucent]] with fine color in their purest forms, except for the colorless diamond, and very hard, with hardnesses of 8 to 10 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]]. Other stones are classified by their color, [[translucency]] and hardness. The traditional distinction does not necessarily reflect modern values, for example, while [[garnet]]s are relatively inexpensive, a green garnet called [[tsavorite]] can be far more valuable than a mid-quality emerald.<ref>Wise, R. W., 2006, ''Secrets Of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones'', Brunswick House Pr, pp. 3\u20138 {{ISBN|0-9728223-8-0}}</ref>  Another unscientific term for semi-precious gemstones used in [[art history]] and [[archaeology]] is [[hardstone]]. Use of the terms 'precious' and 'semi-precious' in a commercial context is, arguably, misleading in that it deceptively implies certain stones are intrinsically more valuable than others, which is not necessarily the case.\n\nIn modern times gemstones are identified by [[gemology|gemologists]], who describe gems and their characteristics using [[technical terminology]] specific to the field of [[gemology]]. The first characteristic a gemologist uses to identify a gemstone is its [[chemical composition]]. For example, [[diamond]]s are made of [[carbon]] (C) and rubies of [[aluminium oxide]] ({{chem|Al|2|O|3}}). Many gems are crystals which are classified by their [[crystal system]] such as [[Cubic crystal system|cubic]] or [[trigonal]] or [[monoclinic]]. Another term used is [[crystal habit|habit]], the form the gem is usually found in. For example, diamonds, which have a cubic crystal system, are often found as [[octahedron]]s.\n\nGemstones are classified into different ''groups'', ''species'', and ''varieties''.<ref name=\"Gem Hunt\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Az2_CQAAQBAJ&pg=PT11|title=GEM HUNTER|first=George|last=Frangoulis|date=18 April 2015|publisher=Lulu.com}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}} For example, ruby is the red variety of the species [[corundum]], while any other color of corundum is considered sapphire. Other examples are the [[emerald]] (green), [[Aquamarines|aquamarine]] (blue), [[red beryl]] (red), [[goshenite]] (colorless), [[heliodor]] (yellow) and [[morganite]] (pink), which are all varieties of the mineral species [[beryl]].\n\nGems are characterized in terms of [[refractive index]], [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]], [[specific gravity]], [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|hardness]], [[Cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]], [[fracture]] and luster. They may exhibit [[pleochroism]] or [[double refraction]]. They may have [[luminescence]] and a distinctive [[absorption spectrum]].\n\nMaterial or flaws within a stone may be present as [[inclusion (mineral)|inclusions]].\n\nGemstones may also be classified in terms of their \"water\". This is a recognized grading of the gem's luster, transparency, or \"brilliance\".<ref>AskOxford.com Concise Oxford English dictionary online.</ref> Very transparent gems are considered \"[[first water]]\", while \"second\" or \"third water\" gems are those of a lesser transparency.<ref>Desirable diamonds: The world's most famous gem. by Sarah Todd.</ref>\n\n==Value==\n[[File:Spanish jewellery-Gold and emerald pendant at VAM-01.jpg|thumb|upright|Spanish emerald and gold pendant at [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]]] [[File:Pendant.jpg|thumb|upright|Enamelled gold, amethyst and pearl pendant, about 1880, Pasquale Novissimo (1844\u20131914), V&A Museum number M.36-1928]]\nGemstones have no universally accepted grading system. Diamonds are graded{{by whom?|date=April 2020}} using a system developed by the [[Gemological Institute of America]] (GIA) in the early 1950s. Historically, all gemstones were graded using the naked eye. The GIA system included a major innovation: the introduction of 10x magnification as the standard for grading clarity. Other gemstones are still graded using the naked eye (assuming 20/20 vision).<ref>Wise, R. W., 2006, ''Secrets of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones'', Brunswick House Pr, p.36 {{ISBN| 0-9728223-8-0}}</ref>\n\nA [[mnemonic device]], the \"four Cs\" (color, cut, clarity, and carats), has been introduced{{by whom?|date=April 2020}} to help the consumer understand the factors used to grade a diamond.<ref>Wise, R. W., 2006, ''Secrets Of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones'', Brunswick House Pr, p. 15</ref> With modification, these categories can be useful in understanding the grading of all gemstones. The four criteria carry different weight depending upon whether they are applied to colored gemstones or to colorless diamonds. In diamonds, cut is the primary determinant of value, followed by clarity and color. The ideal cut diamond will sparkle, to break down light into its constituent rainbow colors (dispersion), chop it up into bright little pieces (scintillation), and deliver it to the eye (brilliance). In its rough crystalline form, a diamond will do none of these things; it requires proper fashioning and this is called \"cut\". In gemstones that have color, including colored diamonds, the purity and beauty of that color is the primary determinant of quality.\n\nPhysical characteristics that make a colored stone valuable are color, clarity to a lesser extent (emeralds will always have a number of inclusions), cut, unusual [[optical phenomena]] within the stone such as color zoning (the uneven distribution of coloring within a gem) and [[star stone| asteria]] (star effects). Ancient Greeks, for example, greatly valued asteria gemstones, which they regarded as powerful [[love charm]]s, and [[Helen of Troy]] was known to have worn star-[[corundum]].<ref name=burnham>{{cite book | last = Burnham | first = S.M. | title = Precious Stones in Nature, Art and Literature | publisher = Bradlee Whidden | date = 1868}} Page 251 URL: [http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/burnham-precious-stones/page_252 Helen of Troy and star corundum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013073718/http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/burnham-precious-stones/page_252 |date=2010-10-13 }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=April 2020}}\n\nAside from the [[diamond]], the [[ruby]], [[sapphire]], [[emerald]], [[pearl]] (not, strictly speaking, a gemstone), and [[opal]]<ref name=church>{{cite book | last = Church | first = A.H. | title = Precious Stones considered in their scientific and artistic relations | publisher = His Majesty's Stationery Office, Wyman & Sons | date = 1905|page = 11|chapter = Definition of Precious Stones |url = http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/church-precious-stones/page_011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092547/http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/church-precious-stones/page_011 |archivedate= 2007-09-29 | via = Farlang.com}}</ref> have also been considered{{by whom?|date=April 2020}} to be precious.

Amsterdam. 2012.jpg|thumb|right|A diamond cutter in [[Amsterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]] in 2012]]\n\nA few gemstones are used as gems in the crystal or other form in which they are found. Most however, are cut and polished for usage as jewelry. The picture to the left is of a rural, commercial cutting operation in Thailand. This small factory cuts thousands of carats of sapphire annually. The two main classifications are stones cut as smooth, dome shaped stones called [[cabochon]]s, and stones which are cut with a [[faceting machine]] by polishing small flat windows called [[facet]]s at regular intervals at exact angles.\n\nStones which are opaque or semi-opaque such as [[opal]], [[turquoise]], [[variscite]], etc. are commonly cut as cabochons. These gems are designed to show the stone's color or surface properties as in opal and star sapphires. Grinding wheels and polishing agents are used to grind, shape and polish the smooth dome shape of the stones.<ref>{{cite book|title = Introduction to Lapidary|first = Pansy D.|last = Kraus|publisher = Krause Publications|date = 2007|isbn = 9780801972669|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/introductiontola00krau}}</ref>\n\nGems which are transparent are normally faceted, a method which shows the optical properties of the stone's interior to its best advantage by maximizing reflected light which is perceived by the viewer as sparkle. There are many commonly used shapes for [[diamond cut|faceted stones]]. The facets must be cut at the proper angles, which varies depending on the [[optical]] properties of the gem. If the angles are too steep or too shallow, the light will pass through and not be reflected back toward the viewer. The faceting machine is used to hold the stone onto a flat lap for cutting and polishing the flat facets.<ref>{{cite book|title = Faceting For Amateurs |first1= Glenn|last1= Vargas|first2= Martha|last2= Vargas|date = 2002 |isbn = 9780917646096}}</ref> Rarely, some cutters use special curved laps to cut and polish curved facets.\n\n==Colors==\n[[File:Aurora Pyramid of Hope.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Nearly 300 variations of diamond color exhibited at [[Aurora Pyramid of Hope|the Aurora display]] at the Natural History Museum in London.]]\nThe color of any material is due to the nature of light itself. Daylight, often called white light, is all of the colors of the spectrum combined. When light strikes a material, most of the light is absorbed while a smaller amount of a particular frequency or wavelength is reflected. The part that is reflected reaches the eye as the perceived color. A ruby appears red because it absorbs all the other colors of white light, while reflecting the red.\n\nA material which is mostly the same can exhibit different colors. For example, ruby and sapphire have the same primary chemical composition (both are [[corundum]]) but exhibit different colors because of impurities. Even the same named gemstone can occur in many different colors: sapphires show different shades of blue and pink and \"fancy sapphires\" exhibit a whole range of other colors from yellow to orange-pink, the latter called \"[[Padparadscha|padparadscha sapphire]]\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenaturalsapphirecompany.com/blog/padparadscha-sapphires-a-buying-guide|title=Padparadscha Sapphires : 10 Tips On Judging The Rare Gem|date=2015-04-06|work=The Natural Sapphire Company Blog|access-date=2018-01-19|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThis difference in color is based on the atomic structure of the stone. Although the different stones formally have the same chemical composition and structure, they are not exactly the same. Every now and then an atom is replaced by a completely different atom, sometimes as few as one in a million atoms. These so-called [[impurities]] are sufficient to absorb certain colors and leave the other colors unaffected.\n\nFor example, [[beryl]], which is colorless in its pure mineral form, becomes emerald with chromium impurities. If [[manganese]] is added instead of [[chromium]], beryl becomes pink [[morganite]]. With iron, it becomes [[Aquamarines|aquamarine]].\n\nSome gemstone treatments make use of the fact that these impurities can be \"manipulated\", thus changing the color of the gem.<ref name=\"Gem Hunt\"/>\n\n==Treatment==\nGemstones are often treated to enhance the color or clarity of the stone. Depending on the type and extent of treatment, they can affect the value of the stone. Some treatments are used widely because the resulting gem is stable, while others are not accepted most commonly because the gem color is unstable and may revert to the original tone.<ref>Gemstone Enhancement: History, Science and State of the Art by Kurt Nassau</ref>\n\n===Heat===\nHeat can improve gemstone color or clarity. The heating process has been well known to gem miners and cutters for centuries, and in many stone types heating is a common practice. Most [[citrine quartz|citrine]] is made by heating [[amethyst]], and partial heating with a strong gradient results in \u201c[[ametrine]]\u201d \u2013 a stone partly amethyst and partly citrine. [[Aquamarine (gemstone)|Aquamarine]] is often heated to remove yellow tones, or to change green colors into the more desirable blue, or enhance its existing blue color to a purer blue.<ref name=Nassau>{{cite book | last = Nassau | first = Kurt | title = Gem Enhancements | publisher = Butterworth Heineman | date = 1994}}</ref>\n\nNearly all [[tanzanite]] is heated at low temperatures to remove brown undertones and give a more desirable blue / purple color.<ref>[http://www.lapigems.com/blog/post/2013/01/17/Tanzanite-Heating-The-Facts.aspx Tanzanite Heating - The Science] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620222334/http://www.lapigems.com/blog/post/2013/01/17/Tanzanite-Heating-The-Facts.aspx |date=2016-06-20 }}</ref> A considerable portion of all [[sapphire]] and [[ruby]] is treated with a variety of heat treatments to improve both color and clarity.\n\nWhen jewelry containing diamonds is heated (for repairs) the diamond should be protected with [[boric acid]]; otherwise the diamond (which is pure carbon) could be burned on the surface or even burned completely up. When jewelry containing [[sapphires]] or [[rubies]] is heated, those stones should not be coated with boracic acid (which can etch the surface) or any other substance. They do not have to be protected from burning, like a diamond (although the stones ''do'' need to be protected from heat stress fracture by immersing the part of the jewelry with stones in water when metal parts are heated).\n\n===Radiation===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}\nVirtually all [[blue topaz]], both the lighter and the darker blue shades such as \"London\" blue, has been [[Irradiation|irradiated]] to change the color from white to blue. Most greened quartz (Oro Verde) is also irradiated to achieve the yellow-green color. Diamonds are [[Artificially irradiated diamond|irradiated]] to produce fancy-color diamonds (which occur naturally, though rarely in gem quality).\n\n===Waxing/oiling===\nEmeralds containing natural fissures are sometimes filled with wax or oil to disguise them. This wax or oil is also colored to make the emerald appear of better color as well as clarity. Turquoise is also commonly treated in a similar manner.\n\n===Fracture filling===\nFracture filling has been in use with different gemstones such as diamonds, emeralds and sapphires. In 2006 \"glass filled rubies\" received publicity. Rubies over 10 carats (2&nbsp;g) with large fractures were filled with lead glass, thus dramatically improving the appearance (of larger rubies in particular). Such treatments are fairly easy to detect.\n\n==Synthetic and artificial gemstones==\nSynthetic gemstones are distinct from imitation or simulated gems.\n\nSynthetic gems are physically, optically and chemically identical to the natural stone, but are created in controlled conditions in a laboratory.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HrESAQAAMAAJ|title=Jewelers' Circular-keystone: JCK.|date=1994|publisher=Chilton Company|language=en}}</ref> Imitation or simulated stones are chemically different from the natural stone but may be optically similar to it; they can be glass, plastic, resins or other compounds.\n\nExamples of simulated or imitation stones include [[cubic zirconia]], composed of [[zirconium]] oxide and simulated [[moissanite]], which are both [[diamond simulants]]. The imitations copy the look and color of the real stone but possess neither their chemical nor physical characteristics. Moissanite actually has a higher refractive index than diamond and when presented beside an equivalently sized and cut diamond will have more \"fire\" than the diamond.\n\nSynthetic, cultured or lab-created gemstones are not imitations. For example, [[diamond]]s, [[Ruby|rubies]], [[sapphire]]s and [[emerald]]s have been manufactured in labs to possess identical chemical and physical characteristics to the naturally occurring variety. Synthetic (lab created) [[corundum]], including ruby and sapphire, is very common and costs much less than the natural stones. Smaller [[synthetic diamond]]s have been manufactured in large quantities as industrial [[abrasive]]s, although larger gem-quality synthetic diamonds are becoming available in multiple carats.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Process Promises Bigger, Better Diamond Crystals|url=http://carnegiescience.edu/news/new_process_promises_bigger_better_diamond_crystals|publisher=Carnegie Institution for Science|accessdate=7 January 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201005848/http://carnegiescience.edu/news/new_process_promises_bigger_better_diamond_crystals|archivedate=1 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nWhether a gemstone is a natural stone or lab-created (synthetic), the physical characteristics are the same. Lab-created stones tend to have a more vivid color to them, as impurities are not present in a lab and do not modify the clarity or color of the stone, unless added intentionally for a specific purpose.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==List of rare gemstones==\n* [[Painite]] was discovered in 1956 in Ohngaing in Myanmar.

Most gemstones are hard, but some soft minerals are used in jewelry because of their [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]] or other physical properties that have [[aesthetic value]]. Rarity is another characteristic that lends value to a gemstone.\n\nApart from jewelry, from earliest antiquity [[engraved gem]]s and [[hardstone carving]]s, such as cups, were major luxury art forms. A gem maker is called a [[lapidary]] or [[gemcutter]]; a [[diamond]] cutter is called a [[diamantaire]].\n\n==Characteristics and classification==\n[[File:Gem.pebbles.800pix.labelled.jpg|thumb|250px|A selection of gemstone pebbles made by tumbling rough rock with abrasive grit, in a rotating drum. The biggest pebble here is {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} long.]]\n\nThe traditional classification in the West, which goes back to the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], begins with a distinction between ''precious'' and ''semi-precious''; similar distinctions are made in other cultures. In modern use the precious stones are [[diamond]], [[ruby]], [[sapphire]] and [[emerald]], with all other gemstones being semi-precious.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=crc7ZtRHItgC&pg=PA1 ''Precious Stones''], Max Bauer, p. 2</ref> This distinction reflects the rarity of the respective stones in ancient times, as well as their quality: all are  [[translucent]] with fine color in their purest forms, except for the colorless diamond, and very hard, with hardnesses of 8 to 10 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]]. Other stones are classified by their color, [[translucency]] and hardness. The traditional distinction does not necessarily reflect modern values, for example, while [[garnet]]s are relatively inexpensive, a green garnet called [[tsavorite]] can be far more valuable than a mid-quality emerald.<ref>Wise, R. W., 2006, ''Secrets Of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones'', Brunswick House Pr, pp. 3\u20138 {{ISBN|0-9728223-8-0}}</ref>  Another unscientific term for semi-precious gemstones used in [[art history]] and [[archaeology]] is [[hardstone]]. Use of the terms 'precious' and 'semi-precious' in a commercial context is, arguably, misleading in that it deceptively implies certain stones are intrinsically more valuable than others, which is not necessarily the case.\n\nIn modern times gemstones are identified by [[gemology|gemologists]], who describe gems and their characteristics using [[technical terminology]] specific to the field of [[gemology]]. The first characteristic a gemologist uses to identify a gemstone is its [[chemical composition]]. For example, [[diamond]]s are made of [[carbon]] (C) and rubies of [[aluminium oxide]] ({{chem|Al|2|O|3}}). Many gems are crystals which are classified by their [[crystal system]] such as [[Cubic crystal system|cubic]] or [[trigonal]] or [[monoclinic]]. Another term used is [[crystal habit|habit]], the form the gem is usually found in. For example, diamonds, which have a cubic crystal system, are often found as [[octahedron]]s.\n\nGemstones are classified into different ''groups'', ''species'', and ''varieties''.<ref name=\"Gem Hunt\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Az2_CQAAQBAJ&pg=PT11|title=GEM HUNTER|first=George|last=Frangoulis|date=18 April 2015|publisher=Lulu.com}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}} For example, ruby is the red variety of the species [[corundum]], while any other color of corundum is considered sapphire. Other examples are the [[emerald]] (green), [[Aquamarines|aquamarine]] (blue), [[red beryl]] (red), [[goshenite]] (colorless), [[heliodor]] (yellow) and [[morganite]] (pink), which are all varieties of the mineral species [[beryl]].\n\nGems are characterized in terms of [[refractive index]], [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]], [[specific gravity]], [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|hardness]], [[Cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]], [[fracture]] and luster. They may exhibit [[pleochroism]] or [[double refraction]]. They may have [[luminescence]] and a distinctive [[absorption spectrum]].\n\nMaterial or flaws within a stone may be present as [[inclusion (mineral)|inclusions]].\n\nGemstones may also be classified in terms of their \"water\". This is a recognized grading of the gem's luster, transparency, or \"brilliance\".<ref>AskOxford.com Concise Oxford English dictionary online.</ref> Very transparent gems are considered \"[[first water]]\", while \"second\" or \"third water\" gems are those of a lesser transparency.<ref>Desirable diamonds: The world's most famous gem. by Sarah Todd.</ref>\n\n==Value==\n[[File:Spanish jewellery-Gold and emerald pendant at VAM-01.jpg|thumb|upright|Spanish emerald and gold pendant at [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]]] [[File:Pendant.jpg|thumb|upright|Enamelled gold, amethyst and pearl pendant, about 1880, Pasquale Novissimo (1844\u20131914), V&A Museum number M.36-1928]]\nGemstones have no universally accepted grading system. Diamonds are graded{{by whom?|date=April 2020}} using a system developed by the [[Gemological Institute of America]] (GIA) in the early 1950s. Historically, all gemstones were graded using the naked eye. The GIA system included a major innovation: the introduction of 10x magnification as the standard for grading clarity. Other gemstones are still graded using the naked eye (assuming 20/20 vision).<ref>Wise, R. W., 2006, ''Secrets of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones'', Brunswick House Pr, p.36 {{ISBN| 0-9728223-8-0}}</ref>\n\nA [[mnemonic device]], the \"four Cs\" (color, cut, clarity, and carats), has been introduced{{by whom?|date=April 2020}} to help the consumer understand the factors used to grade a diamond.<ref>Wise, R. W., 2006, ''Secrets Of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones'', Brunswick House Pr, p. 15</ref> With modification, these categories can be useful in understanding the grading of all gemstones. The four criteria carry different weight depending upon whether they are applied to colored gemstones or to colorless diamonds. In diamonds, cut is the primary determinant of value, followed by clarity and color. The ideal cut diamond will sparkle, to break down light into its constituent rainbow colors (dispersion), chop it up into bright little pieces (scintillation), and deliver it to the eye (brilliance). In its rough crystalline form, a diamond will do none of these things; it requires proper fashioning and this is called \"cut\". In gemstones that have color, including colored diamonds, the purity and beauty of that color is the primary determinant of quality.\n\nPhysical characteristics that make a colored stone valuable are color, clarity to a lesser extent (emeralds will always have a number of inclusions), cut, unusual [[optical phenomena]] within the stone such as color zoning (the uneven distribution of coloring within a gem) and [[star stone| asteria]] (star effects). Ancient Greeks, for example, greatly valued asteria gemstones, which they regarded as powerful [[love charm]]s, and [[Helen of Troy]] was known to have worn star-[[corundum]].<ref name=burnham>{{cite book | last = Burnham | first = S.M. | title = Precious Stones in Nature, Art and Literature | publisher = Bradlee Whidden | date = 1868}} Page 251 URL: [http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/burnham-precious-stones/page_252 Helen of Troy and star corundum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013073718/http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/burnham-precious-stones/page_252 |date=2010-10-13 }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=April 2020}}\n\nAside from the [[diamond]], the [[ruby]], [[sapphire]], [[emerald]], [[pearl]] (not, strictly speaking, a gemstone), and [[opal]]<ref name=church>{{cite book | last = Church | first = A.H. | title = Precious Stones considered in their scientific and artistic relations | publisher = His Majesty's Stationery Office, Wyman & Sons | date = 1905|page = 11|chapter = Definition of Precious Stones |url = http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/church-precious-stones/page_011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092547/http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/church-precious-stones/page_011 |archivedate= 2007-09-29 | via = Farlang.com}}</ref> have also been considered{{by whom?|date=April 2020}} to be precious.

Amsterdam. 2012.jpg|thumb|right|A diamond cutter in [[Amsterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]] in 2012]]\n\nA few gemstones are used as gems in the crystal or other form in which they are found. Most however, are cut and polished for usage as jewelry. The picture to the left is of a rural, commercial cutting operation in Thailand. This small factory cuts thousands of carats of sapphire annually. The two main classifications are stones cut as smooth, dome shaped stones called [[cabochon]]s, and stones which are cut with a [[faceting machine]] by polishing small flat windows called [[facet]]s at regular intervals at exact angles.\n\nStones which are opaque or semi-opaque such as [[opal]], [[turquoise]], [[variscite]], etc. are commonly cut as cabochons. These gems are designed to show the stone's color or surface properties as in opal and star sapphires. Grinding wheels and polishing agents are used to grind, shape and polish the smooth dome shape of the stones.<ref>{{cite book|title = Introduction to Lapidary|first = Pansy D.|last = Kraus|publisher = Krause Publications|date = 2007|isbn = 9780801972669|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/introductiontola00krau}}</ref>\n\nGems which are transparent are normally faceted, a method which shows the optical properties of the stone's interior to its best advantage by maximizing reflected light which is perceived by the viewer as sparkle. There are many commonly used shapes for [[diamond cut|faceted stones]]. The facets must be cut at the proper angles, which varies depending on the [[optical]] properties of the gem. If the angles are too steep or too shallow, the light will pass through and not be reflected back toward the viewer. The faceting machine is used to hold the stone onto a flat lap for cutting and polishing the flat facets.<ref>{{cite book|title = Faceting For Amateurs |first1= Glenn|last1= Vargas|first2= Martha|last2= Vargas|date = 2002 |isbn = 9780917646096}}</ref> Rarely, some cutters use special curved laps to cut and polish curved facets.\n\n==Colors==\n[[File:Aurora Pyramid of Hope.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Nearly 300 variations of diamond color exhibited at [[Aurora Pyramid of Hope|the Aurora display]] at the Natural History Museum in London.]]\nThe color of any material is due to the nature of light itself. Daylight, often called white light, is all of the colors of the spectrum combined. When light strikes a material, most of the light is absorbed while a smaller amount of a particular frequency or wavelength is reflected. The part that is reflected reaches the eye as the perceived color. A ruby appears red because it absorbs all the other colors of white light, while reflecting the red.\n\nA material which is mostly the same can exhibit different colors. For example, ruby and sapphire have the same primary chemical composition (both are [[corundum]]) but exhibit different colors because of impurities. Even the same named gemstone can occur in many different colors: sapphires show different shades of blue and pink and \"fancy sapphires\" exhibit a whole range of other colors from yellow to orange-pink, the latter called \"[[Padparadscha|padparadscha sapphire]]\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenaturalsapphirecompany.com/blog/padparadscha-sapphires-a-buying-guide|title=Padparadscha Sapphires : 10 Tips On Judging The Rare Gem|date=2015-04-06|work=The Natural Sapphire Company Blog|access-date=2018-01-19|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThis difference in color is based on the atomic structure of the stone. Although the different stones formally have the same chemical composition and structure, they are not exactly the same. Every now and then an atom is replaced by a completely different atom, sometimes as few as one in a million atoms. These so-called [[impurities]] are sufficient to absorb certain colors and leave the other colors unaffected.\n\nFor example, [[beryl]], which is colorless in its pure mineral form, becomes emerald with chromium impurities. If [[manganese]] is added instead of [[chromium]], beryl becomes pink [[morganite]]. With iron, it becomes [[Aquamarines|aquamarine]].\n\nSome gemstone treatments make use of the fact that these impurities can be \"manipulated\", thus changing the color of the gem.<ref name=\"Gem Hunt\"/>\n\n==Treatment==\nGemstones are often treated to enhance the color or clarity of the stone. Depending on the type and extent of treatment, they can affect the value of the stone. Some treatments are used widely because the resulting gem is stable, while others are not accepted most commonly because the gem color is unstable and may revert to the original tone.<ref>Gemstone Enhancement: History, Science and State of the Art by Kurt Nassau</ref>\n\n===Heat===\nHeat can improve gemstone color or clarity. The heating process has been well known to gem miners and cutters for centuries, and in many stone types heating is a common practice. Most [[citrine quartz|citrine]] is made by heating [[amethyst]], and partial heating with a strong gradient results in \u201c[[ametrine]]\u201d \u2013 a stone partly amethyst and partly citrine. [[Aquamarine (gemstone)|Aquamarine]] is often heated to remove yellow tones, or to change green colors into the more desirable blue, or enhance its existing blue color to a purer blue.<ref name=Nassau>{{cite book | last = Nassau | first = Kurt | title = Gem Enhancements | publisher = Butterworth Heineman | date = 1994}}</ref>\n\nNearly all [[tanzanite]] is heated at low temperatures to remove brown undertones and give a more desirable blue / purple color.<ref>[http://www.lapigems.com/blog/post/2013/01/17/Tanzanite-Heating-The-Facts.aspx Tanzanite Heating - The Science] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620222334/http://www.lapigems.com/blog/post/2013/01/17/Tanzanite-Heating-The-Facts.aspx |date=2016-06-20 }}</ref> A considerable portion of all [[sapphire]] and [[ruby]] is treated with a variety of heat treatments to improve both color and clarity.\n\nWhen jewelry containing diamonds is heated (for repairs) the diamond should be protected with [[boric acid]]; otherwise the diamond (which is pure carbon) could be burned on the surface or even burned completely up. When jewelry containing [[sapphires]] or [[rubies]] is heated, those stones should not be coated with boracic acid (which can etch the surface) or any other substance. They do not have to be protected from burning, like a diamond (although the stones ''do'' need to be protected from heat stress fracture by immersing the part of the jewelry with stones in water when metal parts are heated).\n\n===Radiation===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}\nVirtually all [[blue topaz]], both the lighter and the darker blue shades such as \"London\" blue, has been [[Irradiation|irradiated]] to change the color from white to blue. Most greened quartz (Oro Verde) is also irradiated to achieve the yellow-green color. Diamonds are [[Artificially irradiated diamond|irradiated]] to produce fancy-color diamonds (which occur naturally, though rarely in gem quality).\n\n===Waxing/oiling===\nEmeralds containing natural fissures are sometimes filled with wax or oil to disguise them. This wax or oil is also colored to make the emerald appear of better color as well as clarity. Turquoise is also commonly treated in a similar manner.\n\n===Fracture filling===\nFracture filling has been in use with different gemstones such as diamonds, emeralds and sapphires. In 2006 \"glass filled rubies\" received publicity. Rubies over 10 carats (2&nbsp;g) with large fractures were filled with lead glass, thus dramatically improving the appearance (of larger rubies in particular). Such treatments are fairly easy to detect.\n\n==Synthetic and artificial gemstones==\nSynthetic gemstones are distinct from imitation or simulated gems.\n\nSynthetic gems are physically, optically and chemically identical to the natural stone, but are created in controlled conditions in a laboratory.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HrESAQAAMAAJ|title=Jewelers' Circular-keystone: JCK.|date=1994|publisher=Chilton Company|language=en}}</ref> Imitation or simulated stones are chemically different from the natural stone but may be optically similar to it; they can be glass, plastic, resins or other compounds.\n\nExamples of simulated or imitation stones include [[cubic zirconia]], composed of [[zirconium]] oxide and simulated [[moissanite]], which are both [[diamond simulants]]. The imitations copy the look and color of the real stone but possess neither their chemical nor physical characteristics. Moissanite actually has a higher refractive index than diamond and when presented beside an equivalently sized and cut diamond will have more \"fire\" than the diamond.\n\nSynthetic, cultured or lab-created gemstones are not imitations. For example, [[diamond]]s, [[Ruby|rubies]], [[sapphire]]s and [[emerald]]s have been manufactured in labs to possess identical chemical and physical characteristics to the naturally occurring variety. Synthetic (lab created) [[corundum]], including ruby and sapphire, is very common and costs much less than the natural stones. Smaller [[synthetic diamond]]s have been manufactured in large quantities as industrial [[abrasive]]s, although larger gem-quality synthetic diamonds are becoming available in multiple carats.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Process Promises Bigger, Better Diamond Crystals|url=http://carnegiescience.edu/news/new_process_promises_bigger_better_diamond_crystals|publisher=Carnegie Institution for Science|accessdate=7 January 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201005848/http://carnegiescience.edu/news/new_process_promises_bigger_better_diamond_crystals|archivedate=1 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nWhether a gemstone is a natural stone or lab-created (synthetic), the physical characteristics are the same. Lab-created stones tend to have a more vivid color to them, as impurities are not present in a lab and do not modify the clarity or color of the stone, unless added intentionally for a specific purpose.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==List of rare gemstones==\n* [[Painite]] was discovered in 1956 in Ohngaing in Myanmar.

Although the difference between modelling and performing is not always clear, appearing in a film or a play is not generally considered to be \"modelling\".\n\nTypes of modelling include: fashion, glamour, fitness, bikini, fine art, body-part, promotional, and commercial print models. Models are featured in a variety of media formats including: books, magazines, films, newspapers, [[Internet modelling|internet]] and television.

Eventually, this became common practice for [[French fashion#Final 19th, the Belle \u00e9poque and early 20th century|Parisian fashion houses]]. There were no standard physical measurement requirements for a model, and most designers would use women of varying sizes to demonstrate variety in their [[Fashion design|designs]].\n\nWith the development of [[fashion photography]], the modelling profession expanded to photo modelling. Models remained fairly anonymous, and relatively poorly paid, until the late 1940s, when the world's first three supermodels, [[Barbara Goalen]], [[Bettina Graziani]] and [[Lisa Fonssagrives]] began commanding very large sums. During the 1940s and 1950s, Graziani was the most photographed woman in France and the undisputed queen of couture, while Fonssagrives appeared on over 200 ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' covers; her name recognition led to the importance of ''Vogue'' in shaping the careers of fashion models.

Throughout Europe, secretarial services acted as models' agents charging them weekly rates for their messages and bookings. For the most part, models were responsible for their own billing. In Germany, agents were not allowed to work for a percentage of a person's earnings, so referred to themselves as secretaries. With the exception of a few models travelling to Paris or New York, travelling was relatively unheard of for a model. Most models only worked in one market due to different labor laws governing modelling in various countries. In the 1960s, Italy had many fashion houses and [[fashion magazines]] but was in dire need of models. Italian agencies would often coerce models to return to Italy without work visas by withholding their pay.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708041838/http://www.modelscomposites.com/history.htm|url=http://www.modelscomposites.com/history.htm|archive-date=8 July 2008|date=January 2007|title=A Brief History Of Modelling|author=Peter Marlowe|website=The Peter Marlowe Model Composite Archives}}</ref> They would also pay their models in cash, which models would have to hide from [[customs]] agents. It was not uncommon for models staying in hotels such as La Louisiana in [[Paris]] or the Arena in [[Milan]] to have their hotel rooms raided by the police looking for their work visas. It was rumoured that competing agencies were behind the raids. This led many agencies to form worldwide chains; for example, the [[Marilyn Agency]] has branches in Paris and New York.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nBy the late 1960s, [[London]] was considered the best market in Europe due to its more organised and innovative approach to modelling. It was during this period that models began to become household names.

The formation of this association helped legitimize modelling and changed the fashion industry. Even with a more professional attitude towards modelling, models were still expected to have their hair and makeup done before they arrived at a shoot.

[[Kate Moss]] became its poster child through her ads for [[Calvin Klein]]. In spite of the heroin chic movement, model [[Claudia Schiffer]] earned $12&nbsp;million. With the popularity of lingerie retailer [[Victoria's Secret]], and the ''[[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]'', there was a need for healthier-looking{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} supermodels such as [[Tyra Banks]] and [[Heidi Klum]] to meet commercial modelling demand. The mid\u20111990s also saw many Asian countries establishing modelling agencies.\n\nBy the late 1990s, the heroin chic era had run its course. Teen-inspired clothing infiltrated mainstream fashion, teen [[pop music]] was on the rise, and artists such as [[Britney Spears]], [[Aaliyah]] and [[Christina Aguilera]] popularized [[Artificial leather|pleather]] and bare midriffs. As fashion changed to a more youthful [[Demography|demographic]], the models who rose to fame had to be sexier for the digital age. Following [[Gisele Bundchen]]'s breakthrough, a wave of [[Brazil]]ian models including [[Adriana Lima]] and [[Alessandra Ambrosio]] rose to fame on runways and became popular in commercial modelling throughout the 2000s. Some have tied this increase in Brazilian models to the trend of magazines featuring celebrities instead of models on their covers.<ref name=\"um\">''Death of the Supermodels'' by C. L.

Key new protections included the following: underage models are not to work before 5:00 pm or after 10:00 pm on school nights, nor were they to work later than 12:30 am on non-school nights; the models may not return to work less than twelve hours after they leave; a pediatric nurse must be on site; models under sixteen must be accompanied by an adult chaperone; parents or guardians of underage models must create a trust fund account into which employers will transfer a minimum of 15% of the [[child model]]'s gross earnings; and employers must set aside time and a dedicated space for educational instruction.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Darwell|first=Robert A.|author2=Theodore C.

Second-tier international fashion center cities include [[Rome]], [[Florence]], [[Venice]], [[Brescia]], [[Barcelona]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Tokyo]], and [[Moscow]].\n\nThe criteria for runway models include certain height and weight requirements. During runway shows, models have to constantly change clothes and makeup. Models walk, turn, and stand in order to demonstrate a garment's key features.

Therefore, plus-size models do not exclusively wear garments marketed as plus-size clothing. This is especially true when participating in fashion editorials for mainstream fashion magazines.

It began most notably from the need of advertisers and a rise of African American photography magazines. The women who advanced in such careers were those in a middle-class system that emphasized the conservative value of marriage, motherhood, and domesticity. Originally titled the \u201cBrownskin\u201d model, African American women refined the social, sexual, and racial realities confined in the gender expectations of the modeling world. There was a profound need for black women to partake in the advertising process for the new \u201cNegro Market\u201d.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Haidarali|first=Laila|date=2005|title=Polishing Brown Diamonds: African American Women, Popular Magazines, and the Advent of Modeling in Early Postwar America|journal=Journal of Women's History|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=10\u201337|doi=10.1353/jowh.2005.0007|issn=1527-2036}}</ref> With the help of Branford Models, the first African American agency, 1946 was the beginning of the black modeling era. Branford Models\u2019 was able to \u201coverturn the barriers facing African American in the early postwar period\u201d especially by lifting at least one economic freedom.<ref name=\":0\" /> In this postwar America, the demand for such presence in magazines advanced \u201cas a stage for models to display consumer goods\u201d while assisting \u201cin constructing a new visual discourse of urban middle-class African America\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhile they represented diversity, a major gap in the fashion industry, it was only until the 1970s that black models had a substantial presence in the modeling world. Known as the \u201cBlack is Beautiful\u201d movement, the 1970s became the era of the black model. With growing disenfranchisement and racial in-equality, the United States recognized the urgency of opening the \u201cdoors of social access and visibility to black Americans\u201d.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Newman|first=Scarlett L.|date=2017|title=Black Models Matter: Challenging the Racism of Aesthetics and the Facade of Inclusion in the Fashion Industry|url=https://academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_etds/2143|journal=CUNY Academic Works|volume=|pages=|via=Academic Works}}</ref> The world of fashion was the gateway for social change. \u201cThe world of fashion was similarly looked to as a place where the culture could find signs of racial progress. Expressions of beauty and glamour mattered. Good race relations required taking note of who was selling women lipsticks and mini skirts, which meant that advertisers began looking for black models\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> Black models were looked to as the vehicle of social change. They were given the opportunity to balance out the lack of presence of black individuals in the mainstream culture. Agencies were beginning to scout black models and focus on the social change they were contributing too. [[Life (magazine)|Life Magazine]] in October 1969, covered their issue with [[Naomi Sims|Noami Sims]], one of the most influential black models in the industry. Her rise to fame lead her to international magazine jobs and individual projects with designers across the globe.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/news/naomi-campbell-famous-black-models|title=Naomi Campbell and 10 Black Models Who Owned the Runway|last=Haynes|first=Clarence|date=June 24, 2019|website=Biography|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 11, 2019}}</ref> In the Life Magazine issue, Black Beauty, a new agency that represented black models, had a spread in the magazine that showcased 39 black models. Each one of the models had their own unique features, allowing black expression to progress through this historic magazine spread.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWith the movement's presence both in magazines and the runway, designers began to realize the need to include black models on their runways and advertisements. The battle of Versallies was one of the most notable moments in fashion history that put black models on the map. [[Eleanor Lambert]], creator of Fashion Week and a major \u201c[controller] of the narrative of American fashion\u201d, set up a dinner and a fundraiser to both increase American fashion visibility and restore the palace of Versailles.<ref name=\":1\" /> Five French designers and five American designers battled it out on the runway, showing off the fashion, and for the Americans, black models as well. [[Oscar de la Renta]] stated \u201cit was the black models that had made the difference.\u201d [[Pat Cleveland]], [[Bethann Hardison|Bethann Hardiason]], [[Billie Blair]], Jennifer Brice, Alva Chinn, and [[The Battle of Versailles Fashion Show|Ramona Saunders,]] were among the many black models that helped Team America win and stun the French competition. This competition made the black model a worldwide phenomenon. The French were beginning to welcome diversity on the runway and in their advertising. With the recognition Versaillies had given, black presence in the modeling world carried out into the 1980s and the 1990s. The models were now known by name and the publicity that came with the designers they were modeling for. With the rise of the \u201csupermodel\u201d, models like [[Naomi Campbell|Noami Campbell]] and [[Tyra Banks]] paved the way for black success.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Naomi Campbell|Noami Campbell]], born in London, was the first black model to cover [[Vogue (magazine)|American Vogue]], [[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]], Russian Vogue, and the first British black model to cover British vogue. She, till this day, is one of the most iconic and distinguished models to work in the industry. Brands like [[Chanel]], [[Louis Vuitton|Louis Vitton]], [[Balmain (fashion house)|Balmain]], [[Prada]], and more have all featured Campbell in their campaigns. She used her remarkable success to achieve more than fashion excelience.\n[[File:Tyra Banks 1995.jpg|thumb|Tyra Banks (1995)]]\nBy the mid-1990s, black presence in the modeling world had dramatically decreased. Designers began to favor a consistent aesthetic and elected for skinner white models. This reality was paved by models like [[Kate Moss]] and [[Stella Tennant]] who provided a more consistent look for the runway. At this time, \u201cthe number of working black models in high-profile runway presentation...became so dire that stories began appearing in the mainstream media about the whitewashing of the runway\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2013/09/givhan-confronting-the-lack-of-black-models.html|title=Robin Givhan: Confronting the Lack of Black Models on the Runway|last=Givhan|first=Robin|date=September 6, 2013|website=The Cut|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref> In response, models like Campbell, Iman, and Bethann Hardison, joined forces throughout the \u201cDiversity Coalition\u201d in an attempt to \u201ccall out and accuse prominent fashion houses for snubbing Black and Asian models on the catwalk, editorial spreads, and campaigns\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> The lack of representation was, in part, due to the belief that \u201cblack girls don\u2019t push products,\u201d which \u201cencouraged people who work directly and indirectly in the industry to speak out on the injustices that go on within it\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> In the 1990s, it was quite clear that the top designers simply preferred a new aesthetic that excluded models of color, which resulted in only 6% of runway models to be women of color.<ref name=\":1\" /> Campbell's Diversity Coalition's main mission was to \u201cexpedite inclusion on the runway by deliberately calling out designers who have executed acts of racism on the runway\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> According to Campbell, it was their choice to not include black models on the runway and desire a uniformed runway that resulted in a racist act. Although such a dramatic effort to exclude black presence from the fashion world, models like [[Tyra Banks]] and [[Veronica Webb]] persisted. Banks not only dominated the runway as a teen, she took over countless pop culture platforms. Being the first black model to cover [[Sports Illustrated]], Banks was one of the most prominent models in the early 2000s. Covering [[Sports Illustrated]], Elle, [[Essence (magazine)|Essence]], [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]], and walking for [[Chanel]], [[Christian Dior (fashion house)|Chrisitan Dior]], and Claude Motnanta, Banks was truly dominating the fashion world. In addition, she acted in ''French Prince of Bel Air'' and created her own reality competition show called [[America's Next Top Model]].<ref name=\":2\" /> In conversation with Trebay of Los the New York Times, Banks stated that her first cover on Sport Illustrated \u201cchanged [her] life overnight.. You have to think back to remember what that did for an appreciation of black beauty to have a black girl, a girl next door type, on the cover of one of the most mass mainstream magazines of our lives.

Glamour models can be any size or shape. There is no industry standard for glamour modelling and it varies greatly by country. For the most part, glamour models are limited to modelling in [[calendar]]s, [[men's magazine]]s, such as ''[[Playboy]]'', [[bikini]] modelling, [[lingerie]] modelling, fetish modelling, music videos, and extra work in films. However, some extremely popular glamour models transition into commercial print modelling, appearing in [[swimwear]], [[bikini]] and [[lingerie]] campaigns.\n\nIt is widely considered{{By whom|date=March 2015}} that England created the market for glamour modelling when ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' established [[Page Three|Page 3]] in 1969,<ref name=\"bbc3651850\">{{cite news |last=Braid |first=Mary |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3651850.stm |title=UK &#124; Magazine &#124; Page Three girls \u2013 the naked truth |work=BBC News |date=2004-09-14 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904054436/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3651850.stm |archive-date=2012-09-04 |url-status=live }}</ref> a section in their newspaper which featured sexually suggestive images of ''Penthouse'' and ''Playboy'' models.

In the 1980s, ''The Sun''{{'s}} competitors followed suit and produced their own Page 3 sections.<ref name=\"bbc3651850\"/> It was during this time that glamour models first came to prominence with the likes of [[Samantha Fox]]. As a result, the United Kingdom has a very large glamour market and has numerous glamour modelling agencies to this day.\n\nIt was not until the 1990s that modern glamour modelling was established. During this time, the fashion industry was promoting models with waif bodies and androgynous looking women, which left a void. Several fashion models, who were deemed too commercial, and too curvaceous, were frustrated with industry standards, and took a different approach. Models such as [[Victoria Silvstedt]] left the fashion world and began modelling for men's magazines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://victoriasilvstedt.com/Biography/tabid/53/Default.aspx |title=Biography |publisher=Victoriasilvstedt.com |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918175550/http://victoriasilvstedt.com/Biography/tabid/53/Default.aspx |archive-date=2012-09-18 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the previous decades, posing nude for ''Playboy''  resulted in models losing their agencies and endorsements.<ref>{{cite book |author=Rebel Heart: An American Rock 'n' Roll Journey |title=Rebel Heart: An American Rock 'n' Roll Journey: Bebe Buell, Victor Bockris: 9780312266943: Amazon.com: Books |df= |isbn=0312266944 |date=2001-08-13 |url=https://archive.org/details/rebelheart00bebe }}</ref> ''Playboy'' was a stepping stone which catapulted the careers of Victoria Silvstedt, [[Pamela Anderson]], and [[Anna Nicole Smith]]. Pamela Anderson became so popular from her ''Playboy'' spreads that she was able to land roles on ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' and ''[[Baywatch]]''.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, a series of men's magazines were established such as ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'', ''[[FHM]]'', and ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]''. At the same time, magazines including Sweden's ''[[Slitz]]'' re-branded themselves as men's magazines. Pre-internet, these magazines were popular among men in their late teens and early twenties because they were considered to be more tasteful than their predecessors. With the glamour market growing, fashion moved away from the waifs and onto Brazilian bombshells. The glamour market, which consisted mostly of commercial fashion models and commercial print models, became its own genre due to its popularity. Even in a large market like the United Kingdom, however, glamour models are not usually signed exclusively to one agency as they can not rely financially on one agency to provide them with enough work. It was, and still is, a common practice for glamour models to partake in kiss-and-tell interviews about their dalliances with famous men.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} The notoriety of their alleged bed-hopping often propels their popularity and they are often promoted by their current or former fling.<ref>{{cite web |author=Gente |url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/373321/0/novia/cristiano/desnuda/ |title='Intervi\u00fa' desnuda a Nereida Gallardo, la novia de Cristiano Ronaldo |publisher=20minutos.es |date=2008-04-26 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221153140/http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/373321/0/novia/cristiano/desnuda/ |archive-date=2011-12-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> With Page 3 models becoming fixtures in the British tabloids, glamour models such as Jordan, now known as [[Katie Price]], became household names.

Petite models typically work more often in commercial, and print modeling (rather than runway modeling)\n\nThe height of models is typically above {{convert|5|ft|9|in}} for women, and above {{convert|6|ft|2|in}} for men. Models who are of heights such as {{convert|5|ft|5|in}} fall under the category of petite models.\n\nPetite models typically model shoes because their feet are of more common sizes compared to the average fashion model.\n\n===Fitness models===\n{{See also|Fitness and figure competition}}\n[[File:Fitness Model Britt 2007.JPG|thumb|upright|Fitness model posing with [[dumbbell]]]]\nFitness modelling focuses on displaying a healthy, toned physique. Fitness models usually have defined muscle groups. The model's body weight is greater due to muscle weighing more than fat; however, they have a lower body fat percentage because the muscles are toned and sculpted. Fitness models are often used in magazine advertising; they can also in some cases be certified personal fitness trainers. However, other fitness models are also athletes and compete as professionals in [[fitness and figure competition]]s. There are several agencies in large markets such as New York, London, and Germany that have fitness modelling agencies. While there is a large market for these models, most of these agencies are a secondary agency promoting models who typically earn their primary income as commercial models. There are also magazines that gear towards specifically fitness modelling or getting fit and in shape.\n\n===Gravure idols===\n\n{{see also|List of Japanese gravure idols}}\n\nIn Japan, a {{nihongo4|gravure idol|\u30b0\u30e9\u30d3\u30a2\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb|gurabia aidoru}}, often abbreviated to {{nihongo4|gradol|\u30b0\u30e9\u30c9\u30eb|guradoru}}, is a female model who primarily models for magazines, especially men's magazines, photobooks or DVDs. {{nihongo4|\"Gurabia\"|\u30b0\u30e9\u30d3\u30a2}} is a [[Wasei-eigo]] term derived from \"[[rotogravure]]\", which is a type of [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] [[printing]] process that was once a staple of newspaper photo features. The rotogravure process is still used for commercial printing of magazines, [[postcard]]s, and [[Cardboard (paper product)|cardboard]] product packaging.<ref name=\"kelana\">{{cite news|last1=Jimi Okelana|title=Japan 101: Guide to Gravure Idols|url=http://www.axiommagazine.jp/2012/03/10/japanese-gravure-idols-101/|accessdate=2 August 2016|work=Axiom Magazine|date=March 10, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728194637/http://www.axiommagazine.jp/2012/03/10/japanese-gravure-idols-101/|archivedate=28 July 2016|df=}}</ref>\n\t \nGravure idols appear in a wide range of photographic styles and genres. Their photos are largely aimed at male audiences with poses or activities intended to be provocative or suggestive, generally accentuated by an air of playfulness and innocence rather than aggressive sexuality. Although gravure idols may sometimes wear clothing that exposes most of their body, they seldom appear fully nude. Gravure idols may be as young as pre-teen age up to their early thirties. In addition to appearing in mainstream magazines, gravure idols often release their own professional photobooks and DVDs for their fans. Many popular [[Japanese idol|female idols in Japan]] launched their careers by starting out as gravure idols.<ref name=\"kelana\"/><ref name=\"Springer\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Galbraith |editor1-first=P.

Many famous AV idols started out as gravure idols.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.tokyokinky.com/akb48-idols-nude-models-porn-careers/ |title = Former AKB48 idols who have \"graduated\" to porn careers |website=Tokyo Kinky |author=Tadashi Anahori |date=3 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Commercial print and on-camera models===\nCommercial print models generally appear in print ads for non-fashion products, and in television commercials. Commercial print models can earn up to $250 an hour. Commercial print models are usually non-exclusive, and primarily work in one location.\n\nThere are several large fashion agencies that have commercial print divisions, including Ford Models in the United States.\n\n===Promotional models===\n{{Main|Promotional model}}\n[[File:IZIBA2004 056 (1924606).jpg|thumb|Two models with the logo of [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel]], a cigarette brand they are promoting, printed on the backside of their shorts in [[Ibiza]], 2004]]\nA promotional model is a model hired to drive [[consumer demand]] for a product, service, brand, or concept by directly interacting with potential consumers. The vast majority of promotional models tend to be attractive in physical appearance. They serve to provide information about the product or service and make it appealing to consumers. While the length of interaction may be short, the promotional model delivers a live experience that reflects on the product or service he or she is representing.  This form of marketing touches fewer consumers for the cost than traditional [[advertising media]] (such as print, radio, and television); however, the consumer's perception of a brand, product, service, or company is often more profoundly affected by a live person-to-person experience.\n\n[[Marketing campaign]]s that make use of promotional models may take place in [[Retailing|stores]] or [[shopping mall]]s, at [[tradeshow]]s, special promotional events, clubs, or even at outdoor public spaces. Promotional models may also be used as TV host/anchor for interviewing celebrities such as at film awards, sports events, etc. They are often held at high traffic locations to reach as many consumers as possible, or at venues at which a particular type of target consumer is expected to be present.\n\n====Spokesmodels====\n{{main|Spokesmodel}}\n\"Spokesmodel\" is a term used for a model who is employed to be associated with a specific [[brand]] in [[advertisement]]s. A spokesmodel may be a celebrity used only in advertisements (in contrast to a brand ambassador who is also expected to represent the company at various events), but more often the term refers to a model who is not a celebrity in their own right. A classic example of the spokesmodel are the models hired to be the [[Marlboro Man]] between 1954 and 1999.\n\n====Trade show models====\n[[Trade show]] models work a trade show floorspace or booth, and represent a company to attendees. Trade show models are typically not regular employees of the company, but are [[freelancer]]s hired by the company renting the booth space. They are hired for several reasons: trade show models can make a company's booth more visibly distinguishable from the hundreds of other booths with which it competes for attendee attention. They are articulate and quickly learn and explain or disseminate information on the company and its product(s) and service(s). And they can assist a company in handling a large number of attendees which the company might otherwise not have enough employees to accommodate, possibly increasing the number of sales or leads resulting from participation in the show.\n\n====Atmosphere models====\n[[File:Atmosphere Models 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Atmosphere models at a sexy costume party]]\n'''Atmosphere models''' are hired by the producers of themed events to enhance the atmosphere or ambience of their event. They are usually dressed in costumes exemplifying the theme of the event and are often placed strategically in various locations around the venue. It is common for event guests to have their picture taken with atmosphere models. For example, if someone is throwing a \"Brazilian Day\" celebration, they would hire models dressed in samba costumes and headdresses to stand or walk around the party{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}.\n\n====Podium models====\n[[File:Podium Model 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|Podium model modeling a dress by [[Sue Wong]]]]\n'''Podium models''' differ from runway models in that they don't walk down a runway, but rather just stand on an elevated platform. They are kind of like live mannequins placed in various places throughout an event. Attendees can walk up to the models and inspect and even feel the clothing.  Podium Modeling is a practical alternative way of presenting a fashion show when space is too limited to have a full runway fashion show.\n\n===Art models===\n{{Main|Model (art)}}\n[[File:2009-08-31-akt-muehle-099.jpg|thumb|left|Art school model]]\n'''Art models''' pose for any [[visual artist]] as part of the [[creative process]]. Art models are often paid [[professionals]] who provide a reference or inspiration for a [[work of art]] that includes the human figure. The most common types of art created using models are [[figure drawing]], [[figure painting]], [[sculpture]] and [[photography]], but almost any medium may be used. Although commercial motives dominate over aesthetics in [[illustration]], its artwork commonly employs models. Models are most frequently employed for [[art school|art classes]] or by informal groups of experienced artists that gather to share the expense of a model.\n\n===Instagram models===\n'''Instagram models''' have become popular due to the widespread use of [[social media]]. They are models who gain their success as a result of the large number of followers they have on [[Instagram]] and other social media. They should not be confused with established models such as [[Cara Delevingne]], @karrynwieda on instagram, and [[Gigi Hadid]], who use Instagram to promote their traditional modelling careers,<ref name=ABC/> although some models, such as [[Playboy]] model [[Lindsey Pelas]], begin their modelling careers conventionally and subsequently become Instagram models. Some models use Instagram success to develop their careers, such as [[Rosie Roff]] who worked as a fashion model before being discovered via Instagram and gaining work as a [[ring girl]] in American boxing. In some cases, Instagram provides unsigned models with a platform to attract the attention of agencies and talent scouts.<ref name=Saul>{{cite newspaper|title=Instafamous: Meet the social media influencers redefining celebrity|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/instagram-model-natasha-oakley-iskra-lawrence-kayla-itsines-kendall-jenner-jordyn-woods-a6907551.html|date=27 March 2016|author=Heather Saul|newspaper=Independent|access-date=2017-09-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901063025/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/instagram-model-natasha-oakley-iskra-lawrence-kayla-itsines-kendall-jenner-jordyn-woods-a6907551.html|archive-date=2017-09-01|url-status=live}}</ref> American model [[Matthew Noszka]] entered the profession as a result of being discovered on Instagram by [[Wilhelmina Models]].<ref name=ABC>{{cite news|title=From Construction to High Fashion: How Instagram Helped This Male Model Get Discovered|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/construction-high-fashion-instagram-helped-male-model-discovered/story?id=29253900|date=26 February 2015|author1=Mara Schiavocampo|author2=Claire Pedersen|author3=Timor Balaish|author4=Lauren Effron|publisher=ABC News|access-date=2017-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229052246/http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/construction-high-fashion-instagram-helped-male-model-discovered/story?id=29253900|archive-date=2017-12-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Instagram model concept originated in the late 2000s, when the boyfriends of fashion bloggers such as [[Rumi Neely]] and [[Chiara Ferragni]] began photographing their girlfriends in various outfits.<ref name=Spinks>{{cite web|title=What It's Actually Like to Be an Instagram Model|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/what-instagram-models-actually-do|work=Vice|author=Rosie Spinks|date=7 August 2016}}</ref> Instagram models often attempt to become social media influencers and engage in [[influencer marketing]],<ref name=Saul/> promoting products such as fashion brands and detox teas.<ref name=Spinks/> High-profile influencers are able to earn thousands of US dollars for promoting commercial brands. When choosing whom to employ, brands have become less concerned with the number of followers an influencer has and more focussed on their [[engagement marketing]] strategy.

Models are featured in a variety of media formats including: books, magazines, films, newspapers, [[Internet modelling|internet]] and television.

Eventually, this became common practice for [[French fashion#Final 19th, the Belle \u00e9poque and early 20th century|Parisian fashion houses]]. There were no standard physical measurement requirements for a model, and most designers would use women of varying sizes to demonstrate variety in their [[Fashion design|designs]].\n\nWith the development of [[fashion photography]], the modelling profession expanded to photo modelling. Models remained fairly anonymous, and relatively poorly paid, until the late 1940s, when the world's first three supermodels, [[Barbara Goalen]], [[Bettina Graziani]] and [[Lisa Fonssagrives]] began commanding very large sums. During the 1940s and 1950s, Graziani was the most photographed woman in France and the undisputed queen of couture, while Fonssagrives appeared on over 200 ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' covers; her name recognition led to the importance of ''Vogue'' in shaping the careers of fashion models. One of the most popular models during the 1940s was [[Jinx Falkenburg]] who was paid $25 per hour, a large sum at the time; <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldmagazinearticles.com/Fashion_1940s_Modeling |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401102507/http://www.oldmagazinearticles.com/Fashion_1940s_Modeling |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-04-01 |title=fashion models 1940s, fashion modeling in 1940, Forties Fashion modeling agencies, first fashion modeling agency in New York, 1940s fashion models, John Powers modeling agency, girls of the John Roberts Powers modeling agency, Powers Girls Photographs, popular 1 |publisher=Oldmagazinearticles.com |accessdate=2012-09-19 }}</ref> through the 1950s, [[Wilhelmina Cooper]], [[Jean Patchett]], [[Dovima]], [[Dorian Leigh]], [[Suzy Parker]], [[Evelyn Tripp]], and [[Carmen Dell'Orefice]] also dominated fashion.<ref>{{cite newspaper |author=Cathy Horyn|date=4 February 2002 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/04/nyregion/jean-patchett-75-a-model-who-helped-define-the-50-s.html |title=Jean Patchett, 75, a Model Who Helped Define the 50s |newspaper=New York Times |accessdate=19 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829054807/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/04/nyregion/jean-patchett-75-a-model-who-helped-define-the-50-s.html |archive-date=29 August 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Dorothea Church]] was among the first black models in the industry to gain recognition in Paris.

Throughout Europe, secretarial services acted as models' agents charging them weekly rates for their messages and bookings. For the most part, models were responsible for their own billing. In Germany, agents were not allowed to work for a percentage of a person's earnings, so referred to themselves as secretaries. With the exception of a few models travelling to Paris or New York, travelling was relatively unheard of for a model. Most models only worked in one market due to different labor laws governing modelling in various countries. In the 1960s, Italy had many fashion houses and [[fashion magazines]] but was in dire need of models. Italian agencies would often coerce models to return to Italy without work visas by withholding their pay.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708041838/http://www.modelscomposites.com/history.htm|url=http://www.modelscomposites.com/history.htm|archive-date=8 July 2008|date=January 2007|title=A Brief History Of Modelling|author=Peter Marlowe|website=The Peter Marlowe Model Composite Archives}}</ref> They would also pay their models in cash, which models would have to hide from [[customs]] agents. It was not uncommon for models staying in hotels such as La Louisiana in [[Paris]] or the Arena in [[Milan]] to have their hotel rooms raided by the police looking for their work visas. It was rumoured that competing agencies were behind the raids. This led many agencies to form worldwide chains; for example, the [[Marilyn Agency]] has branches in Paris and New York.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nBy the late 1960s, [[London]] was considered the best market in Europe due to its more organised and innovative approach to modelling. It was during this period that models began to become household names. Models such as [[Jean Shrimpton]], [[Tania Mallet]], [[Celia Hammond]], [[Twiggy]], [[Penelope Tree]], and dominated the London fashion scene and were well paid, unlike their predecessors.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG9013918/David-Baileys-favourite-model-Jean-Shrimpton-was-the-Shrimp-who-sparked-the-Sixties.html |title=David Bailey's favourite model Jean Shrimpton was the Shrimp who sparked the Sixties \u2013 Telegraph |publisher=Fashion.telegraph.co.uk |accessdate=2012-09-19 |location=London |first=Lisa |last=Armstrong |date=2012-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827035540/http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG9013918/David-Baileys-favourite-model-Jean-Shrimpton-was-the-Shrimp-who-sparked-the-Sixties.html |archive-date=2012-08-27 |url-status=live }}</ref> Twiggy became The Face of '66 at the age of 16.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.twiggylawson.co.uk/fashion.html/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030211153058/http://www.twiggylawson.co.uk/fashion.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2003-02-11 |title=Twiggy \u2013 The Official Site |publisher=Twiggylawson.co.uk |date=1966-02-23 |accessdate=2012-09-19 }}</ref> At this time, model agencies were not as restrictive about the models they represented, although it was uncommon for them to sign shorter models. Twiggy, who stood at {{convert|5|ft|6|in|cm}} with a 32\" bust and had a boy's haircut, is credited with changing model ideals. At that time, she earned \u00a380 an hour, while the average wage was \u00a315 a week.[[File:Jean Shrimpton (1965).jpg|thumb|[[Jean Shrimpton]] in 1965|298x298px]]In 1967, seven of the top model agents in London formed the Association of London Model Agents. The formation of this association helped legitimize modelling and changed the fashion industry. Even with a more professional attitude towards modelling, models were still expected to have their hair and makeup done before they arrived at a shoot. Meanwhile, agencies took responsibility for a model's promotional materials and branding. That same year, former top fashion model [[Wilhelmina Cooper]] opened up her own fashion agency with her husband called [[Wilhelmina Models]].

[[Kate Moss]] became its poster child through her ads for [[Calvin Klein]]. In spite of the heroin chic movement, model [[Claudia Schiffer]] earned $12&nbsp;million. With the popularity of lingerie retailer [[Victoria's Secret]], and the ''[[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]'', there was a need for healthier-looking{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} supermodels such as [[Tyra Banks]] and [[Heidi Klum]] to meet commercial modelling demand. The mid\u20111990s also saw many Asian countries establishing modelling agencies.\n\nBy the late 1990s, the heroin chic era had run its course. Teen-inspired clothing infiltrated mainstream fashion, teen [[pop music]] was on the rise, and artists such as [[Britney Spears]], [[Aaliyah]] and [[Christina Aguilera]] popularized [[Artificial leather|pleather]] and bare midriffs. As fashion changed to a more youthful [[Demography|demographic]], the models who rose to fame had to be sexier for the digital age. Following [[Gisele Bundchen]]'s breakthrough, a wave of [[Brazil]]ian models including [[Adriana Lima]] and [[Alessandra Ambrosio]] rose to fame on runways and became popular in commercial modelling throughout the 2000s. Some have tied this increase in Brazilian models to the trend of magazines featuring celebrities instead of models on their covers.<ref name=\"um\">''Death of the Supermodels'' by C. L.

Key new protections included the following: underage models are not to work before 5:00 pm or after 10:00 pm on school nights, nor were they to work later than 12:30 am on non-school nights; the models may not return to work less than twelve hours after they leave; a pediatric nurse must be on site; models under sixteen must be accompanied by an adult chaperone; parents or guardians of underage models must create a trust fund account into which employers will transfer a minimum of 15% of the [[child model]]'s gross earnings; and employers must set aside time and a dedicated space for educational instruction.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Darwell|first=Robert A.|author2=Theodore C.

Second-tier international fashion center cities include [[Rome]], [[Florence]], [[Venice]], [[Brescia]], [[Barcelona]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Tokyo]], and [[Moscow]].\n\nThe criteria for runway models include certain height and weight requirements. During runway shows, models have to constantly change clothes and makeup. Models walk, turn, and stand in order to demonstrate a garment's key features.

Therefore, plus-size models do not exclusively wear garments marketed as plus-size clothing. This is especially true when participating in fashion editorials for mainstream fashion magazines.

It began most notably from the need of advertisers and a rise of African American photography magazines. The women who advanced in such careers were those in a middle-class system that emphasized the conservative value of marriage, motherhood, and domesticity. Originally titled the \u201cBrownskin\u201d model, African American women refined the social, sexual, and racial realities confined in the gender expectations of the modeling world. There was a profound need for black women to partake in the advertising process for the new \u201cNegro Market\u201d.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Haidarali|first=Laila|date=2005|title=Polishing Brown Diamonds: African American Women, Popular Magazines, and the Advent of Modeling in Early Postwar America|journal=Journal of Women's History|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=10\u201337|doi=10.1353/jowh.2005.0007|issn=1527-2036}}</ref> With the help of Branford Models, the first African American agency, 1946 was the beginning of the black modeling era. Branford Models\u2019 was able to \u201coverturn the barriers facing African American in the early postwar period\u201d especially by lifting at least one economic freedom.<ref name=\":0\" /> In this postwar America, the demand for such presence in magazines advanced \u201cas a stage for models to display consumer goods\u201d while assisting \u201cin constructing a new visual discourse of urban middle-class African America\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhile they represented diversity, a major gap in the fashion industry, it was only until the 1970s that black models had a substantial presence in the modeling world. Known as the \u201cBlack is Beautiful\u201d movement, the 1970s became the era of the black model. With growing disenfranchisement and racial in-equality, the United States recognized the urgency of opening the \u201cdoors of social access and visibility to black Americans\u201d.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Newman|first=Scarlett L.|date=2017|title=Black Models Matter: Challenging the Racism of Aesthetics and the Facade of Inclusion in the Fashion Industry|url=https://academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_etds/2143|journal=CUNY Academic Works|volume=|pages=|via=Academic Works}}</ref> The world of fashion was the gateway for social change. \u201cThe world of fashion was similarly looked to as a place where the culture could find signs of racial progress. Expressions of beauty and glamour mattered. Good race relations required taking note of who was selling women lipsticks and mini skirts, which meant that advertisers began looking for black models\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> Black models were looked to as the vehicle of social change. They were given the opportunity to balance out the lack of presence of black individuals in the mainstream culture. Agencies were beginning to scout black models and focus on the social change they were contributing too. [[Life (magazine)|Life Magazine]] in October 1969, covered their issue with [[Naomi Sims|Noami Sims]], one of the most influential black models in the industry. Her rise to fame lead her to international magazine jobs and individual projects with designers across the globe.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/news/naomi-campbell-famous-black-models|title=Naomi Campbell and 10 Black Models Who Owned the Runway|last=Haynes|first=Clarence|date=June 24, 2019|website=Biography|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 11, 2019}}</ref> In the Life Magazine issue, Black Beauty, a new agency that represented black models, had a spread in the magazine that showcased 39 black models. Each one of the models had their own unique features, allowing black expression to progress through this historic magazine spread.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWith the movement's presence both in magazines and the runway, designers began to realize the need to include black models on their runways and advertisements. The battle of Versallies was one of the most notable moments in fashion history that put black models on the map. [[Eleanor Lambert]], creator of Fashion Week and a major \u201c[controller] of the narrative of American fashion\u201d, set up a dinner and a fundraiser to both increase American fashion visibility and restore the palace of Versailles.<ref name=\":1\" /> Five French designers and five American designers battled it out on the runway, showing off the fashion, and for the Americans, black models as well. [[Oscar de la Renta]] stated \u201cit was the black models that had made the difference.\u201d [[Pat Cleveland]], [[Bethann Hardison|Bethann Hardiason]], [[Billie Blair]], Jennifer Brice, Alva Chinn, and [[The Battle of Versailles Fashion Show|Ramona Saunders,]] were among the many black models that helped Team America win and stun the French competition. This competition made the black model a worldwide phenomenon. The French were beginning to welcome diversity on the runway and in their advertising. With the recognition Versaillies had given, black presence in the modeling world carried out into the 1980s and the 1990s. The models were now known by name and the publicity that came with the designers they were modeling for. With the rise of the \u201csupermodel\u201d, models like [[Naomi Campbell|Noami Campbell]] and [[Tyra Banks]] paved the way for black success.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Naomi Campbell|Noami Campbell]], born in London, was the first black model to cover [[Vogue (magazine)|American Vogue]], [[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]], Russian Vogue, and the first British black model to cover British vogue. She, till this day, is one of the most iconic and distinguished models to work in the industry. Brands like [[Chanel]], [[Louis Vuitton|Louis Vitton]], [[Balmain (fashion house)|Balmain]], [[Prada]], and more have all featured Campbell in their campaigns. She used her remarkable success to achieve more than fashion excelience.\n[[File:Tyra Banks 1995.jpg|thumb|Tyra Banks (1995)]]\nBy the mid-1990s, black presence in the modeling world had dramatically decreased. Designers began to favor a consistent aesthetic and elected for skinner white models. This reality was paved by models like [[Kate Moss]] and [[Stella Tennant]] who provided a more consistent look for the runway. At this time, \u201cthe number of working black models in high-profile runway presentation...became so dire that stories began appearing in the mainstream media about the whitewashing of the runway\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2013/09/givhan-confronting-the-lack-of-black-models.html|title=Robin Givhan: Confronting the Lack of Black Models on the Runway|last=Givhan|first=Robin|date=September 6, 2013|website=The Cut|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref> In response, models like Campbell, Iman, and Bethann Hardison, joined forces throughout the \u201cDiversity Coalition\u201d in an attempt to \u201ccall out and accuse prominent fashion houses for snubbing Black and Asian models on the catwalk, editorial spreads, and campaigns\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> The lack of representation was, in part, due to the belief that \u201cblack girls don\u2019t push products,\u201d which \u201cencouraged people who work directly and indirectly in the industry to speak out on the injustices that go on within it\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> In the 1990s, it was quite clear that the top designers simply preferred a new aesthetic that excluded models of color, which resulted in only 6% of runway models to be women of color.<ref name=\":1\" /> Campbell's Diversity Coalition's main mission was to \u201cexpedite inclusion on the runway by deliberately calling out designers who have executed acts of racism on the runway\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> According to Campbell, it was their choice to not include black models on the runway and desire a uniformed runway that resulted in a racist act. Although such a dramatic effort to exclude black presence from the fashion world, models like [[Tyra Banks]] and [[Veronica Webb]] persisted. Banks not only dominated the runway as a teen, she took over countless pop culture platforms. Being the first black model to cover [[Sports Illustrated]], Banks was one of the most prominent models in the early 2000s. Covering [[Sports Illustrated]], Elle, [[Essence (magazine)|Essence]], [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]], and walking for [[Chanel]], [[Christian Dior (fashion house)|Chrisitan Dior]], and Claude Motnanta, Banks was truly dominating the fashion world. In addition, she acted in ''French Prince of Bel Air'' and created her own reality competition show called [[America's Next Top Model]].<ref name=\":2\" /> In conversation with Trebay of Los the New York Times, Banks stated that her first cover on Sport Illustrated \u201cchanged [her] life overnight.. You have to think back to remember what that did for an appreciation of black beauty to have a black girl, a girl next door type, on the cover of one of the most mass mainstream magazines of our lives.

Glamour models can be any size or shape. There is no industry standard for glamour modelling and it varies greatly by country. For the most part, glamour models are limited to modelling in [[calendar]]s, [[men's magazine]]s, such as ''[[Playboy]]'', [[bikini]] modelling, [[lingerie]] modelling, fetish modelling, music videos, and extra work in films. However, some extremely popular glamour models transition into commercial print modelling, appearing in [[swimwear]], [[bikini]] and [[lingerie]] campaigns.\n\nIt is widely considered{{By whom|date=March 2015}} that England created the market for glamour modelling when ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' established [[Page Three|Page 3]] in 1969,<ref name=\"bbc3651850\">{{cite news |last=Braid |first=Mary |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3651850.stm |title=UK &#124; Magazine &#124; Page Three girls \u2013 the naked truth |work=BBC News |date=2004-09-14 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904054436/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3651850.stm |archive-date=2012-09-04 |url-status=live }}</ref> a section in their newspaper which featured sexually suggestive images of ''Penthouse'' and ''Playboy'' models.

In the 1980s, ''The Sun''{{'s}} competitors followed suit and produced their own Page 3 sections.<ref name=\"bbc3651850\"/> It was during this time that glamour models first came to prominence with the likes of [[Samantha Fox]]. As a result, the United Kingdom has a very large glamour market and has numerous glamour modelling agencies to this day.\n\nIt was not until the 1990s that modern glamour modelling was established. During this time, the fashion industry was promoting models with waif bodies and androgynous looking women, which left a void. Several fashion models, who were deemed too commercial, and too curvaceous, were frustrated with industry standards, and took a different approach. Models such as [[Victoria Silvstedt]] left the fashion world and began modelling for men's magazines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://victoriasilvstedt.com/Biography/tabid/53/Default.aspx |title=Biography |publisher=Victoriasilvstedt.com |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918175550/http://victoriasilvstedt.com/Biography/tabid/53/Default.aspx |archive-date=2012-09-18 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the previous decades, posing nude for ''Playboy''  resulted in models losing their agencies and endorsements.<ref>{{cite book |author=Rebel Heart: An American Rock 'n' Roll Journey |title=Rebel Heart: An American Rock 'n' Roll Journey: Bebe Buell, Victor Bockris: 9780312266943: Amazon.com: Books |df= |isbn=0312266944 |date=2001-08-13 |url=https://archive.org/details/rebelheart00bebe }}</ref> ''Playboy'' was a stepping stone which catapulted the careers of Victoria Silvstedt, [[Pamela Anderson]], and [[Anna Nicole Smith]]. Pamela Anderson became so popular from her ''Playboy'' spreads that she was able to land roles on ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' and ''[[Baywatch]]''.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, a series of men's magazines were established such as ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'', ''[[FHM]]'', and ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]''. At the same time, magazines including Sweden's ''[[Slitz]]'' re-branded themselves as men's magazines. Pre-internet, these magazines were popular among men in their late teens and early twenties because they were considered to be more tasteful than their predecessors. With the glamour market growing, fashion moved away from the waifs and onto Brazilian bombshells. The glamour market, which consisted mostly of commercial fashion models and commercial print models, became its own genre due to its popularity. Even in a large market like the United Kingdom, however, glamour models are not usually signed exclusively to one agency as they can not rely financially on one agency to provide them with enough work. It was, and still is, a common practice for glamour models to partake in kiss-and-tell interviews about their dalliances with famous men.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} The notoriety of their alleged bed-hopping often propels their popularity and they are often promoted by their current or former fling.<ref>{{cite web |author=Gente |url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/373321/0/novia/cristiano/desnuda/ |title='Intervi\u00fa' desnuda a Nereida Gallardo, la novia de Cristiano Ronaldo |publisher=20minutos.es |date=2008-04-26 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221153140/http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/373321/0/novia/cristiano/desnuda/ |archive-date=2011-12-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> With Page 3 models becoming fixtures in the British tabloids, glamour models such as Jordan, now known as [[Katie Price]], became household names.

Petite models typically work more often in commercial, and print modeling (rather than runway modeling)\n\nThe height of models is typically above {{convert|5|ft|9|in}} for women, and above {{convert|6|ft|2|in}} for men. Models who are of heights such as {{convert|5|ft|5|in}} fall under the category of petite models.\n\nPetite models typically model shoes because their feet are of more common sizes compared to the average fashion model.\n\n===Fitness models===\n{{See also|Fitness and figure competition}}\n[[File:Fitness Model Britt 2007.JPG|thumb|upright|Fitness model posing with [[dumbbell]]]]\nFitness modelling focuses on displaying a healthy, toned physique. Fitness models usually have defined muscle groups. The model's body weight is greater due to muscle weighing more than fat; however, they have a lower body fat percentage because the muscles are toned and sculpted. Fitness models are often used in magazine advertising; they can also in some cases be certified personal fitness trainers. However, other fitness models are also athletes and compete as professionals in [[fitness and figure competition]]s. There are several agencies in large markets such as New York, London, and Germany that have fitness modelling agencies. While there is a large market for these models, most of these agencies are a secondary agency promoting models who typically earn their primary income as commercial models. There are also magazines that gear towards specifically fitness modelling or getting fit and in shape.\n\n===Gravure idols===\n\n{{see also|List of Japanese gravure idols}}\n\nIn Japan, a {{nihongo4|gravure idol|\u30b0\u30e9\u30d3\u30a2\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb|gurabia aidoru}}, often abbreviated to {{nihongo4|gradol|\u30b0\u30e9\u30c9\u30eb|guradoru}}, is a female model who primarily models for magazines, especially men's magazines, photobooks or DVDs. {{nihongo4|\"Gurabia\"|\u30b0\u30e9\u30d3\u30a2}} is a [[Wasei-eigo]] term derived from \"[[rotogravure]]\", which is a type of [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] [[printing]] process that was once a staple of newspaper photo features. The rotogravure process is still used for commercial printing of magazines, [[postcard]]s, and [[Cardboard (paper product)|cardboard]] product packaging.<ref name=\"kelana\">{{cite news|last1=Jimi Okelana|title=Japan 101: Guide to Gravure Idols|url=http://www.axiommagazine.jp/2012/03/10/japanese-gravure-idols-101/|accessdate=2 August 2016|work=Axiom Magazine|date=March 10, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728194637/http://www.axiommagazine.jp/2012/03/10/japanese-gravure-idols-101/|archivedate=28 July 2016|df=}}</ref>\n\t \nGravure idols appear in a wide range of photographic styles and genres. Their photos are largely aimed at male audiences with poses or activities intended to be provocative or suggestive, generally accentuated by an air of playfulness and innocence rather than aggressive sexuality. Although gravure idols may sometimes wear clothing that exposes most of their body, they seldom appear fully nude. Gravure idols may be as young as pre-teen age up to their early thirties. In addition to appearing in mainstream magazines, gravure idols often release their own professional photobooks and DVDs for their fans. Many popular [[Japanese idol|female idols in Japan]] launched their careers by starting out as gravure idols.<ref name=\"kelana\"/><ref name=\"Springer\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Galbraith |editor1-first=P.

Many famous AV idols started out as gravure idols.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.tokyokinky.com/akb48-idols-nude-models-porn-careers/ |title = Former AKB48 idols who have \"graduated\" to porn careers |website=Tokyo Kinky |author=Tadashi Anahori |date=3 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Commercial print and on-camera models===\nCommercial print models generally appear in print ads for non-fashion products, and in television commercials. Commercial print models can earn up to $250 an hour. Commercial print models are usually non-exclusive, and primarily work in one location.\n\nThere are several large fashion agencies that have commercial print divisions, including Ford Models in the United States.\n\n===Promotional models===\n{{Main|Promotional model}}\n[[File:IZIBA2004 056 (1924606).jpg|thumb|Two models with the logo of [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel]], a cigarette brand they are promoting, printed on the backside of their shorts in [[Ibiza]], 2004]]\nA promotional model is a model hired to drive [[consumer demand]] for a product, service, brand, or concept by directly interacting with potential consumers. The vast majority of promotional models tend to be attractive in physical appearance. They serve to provide information about the product or service and make it appealing to consumers. While the length of interaction may be short, the promotional model delivers a live experience that reflects on the product or service he or she is representing.  This form of marketing touches fewer consumers for the cost than traditional [[advertising media]] (such as print, radio, and television); however, the consumer's perception of a brand, product, service, or company is often more profoundly affected by a live person-to-person experience.\n\n[[Marketing campaign]]s that make use of promotional models may take place in [[Retailing|stores]] or [[shopping mall]]s, at [[tradeshow]]s, special promotional events, clubs, or even at outdoor public spaces. Promotional models may also be used as TV host/anchor for interviewing celebrities such as at film awards, sports events, etc. They are often held at high traffic locations to reach as many consumers as possible, or at venues at which a particular type of target consumer is expected to be present.\n\n====Spokesmodels====\n{{main|Spokesmodel}}\n\"Spokesmodel\" is a term used for a model who is employed to be associated with a specific [[brand]] in [[advertisement]]s. A spokesmodel may be a celebrity used only in advertisements (in contrast to a brand ambassador who is also expected to represent the company at various events), but more often the term refers to a model who is not a celebrity in their own right. A classic example of the spokesmodel are the models hired to be the [[Marlboro Man]] between 1954 and 1999.\n\n====Trade show models====\n[[Trade show]] models work a trade show floorspace or booth, and represent a company to attendees. Trade show models are typically not regular employees of the company, but are [[freelancer]]s hired by the company renting the booth space. They are hired for several reasons: trade show models can make a company's booth more visibly distinguishable from the hundreds of other booths with which it competes for attendee attention. They are articulate and quickly learn and explain or disseminate information on the company and its product(s) and service(s). And they can assist a company in handling a large number of attendees which the company might otherwise not have enough employees to accommodate, possibly increasing the number of sales or leads resulting from participation in the show.\n\n====Atmosphere models====\n[[File:Atmosphere Models 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Atmosphere models at a sexy costume party]]\n'''Atmosphere models''' are hired by the producers of themed events to enhance the atmosphere or ambience of their event. They are usually dressed in costumes exemplifying the theme of the event and are often placed strategically in various locations around the venue. It is common for event guests to have their picture taken with atmosphere models. For example, if someone is throwing a \"Brazilian Day\" celebration, they would hire models dressed in samba costumes and headdresses to stand or walk around the party{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}.\n\n====Podium models====\n[[File:Podium Model 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|Podium model modeling a dress by [[Sue Wong]]]]\n'''Podium models''' differ from runway models in that they don't walk down a runway, but rather just stand on an elevated platform. They are kind of like live mannequins placed in various places throughout an event. Attendees can walk up to the models and inspect and even feel the clothing.  Podium Modeling is a practical alternative way of presenting a fashion show when space is too limited to have a full runway fashion show.\n\n===Art models===\n{{Main|Model (art)}}\n[[File:2009-08-31-akt-muehle-099.jpg|thumb|left|Art school model]]\n'''Art models''' pose for any [[visual artist]] as part of the [[creative process]]. Art models are often paid [[professionals]] who provide a reference or inspiration for a [[work of art]] that includes the human figure. The most common types of art created using models are [[figure drawing]], [[figure painting]], [[sculpture]] and [[photography]], but almost any medium may be used. Although commercial motives dominate over aesthetics in [[illustration]], its artwork commonly employs models. Models are most frequently employed for [[art school|art classes]] or by informal groups of experienced artists that gather to share the expense of a model.\n\n===Instagram models===\n'''Instagram models''' have become popular due to the widespread use of [[social media]]. They are models who gain their success as a result of the large number of followers they have on [[Instagram]] and other social media. They should not be confused with established models such as [[Cara Delevingne]] and [[Gigi Hadid]], who use Instagram to promote their traditional modelling careers,<ref name=ABC/> although some models, such as [[Playboy]] model [[Lindsey Pelas]], begin their modelling careers conventionally and subsequently become Instagram models. Some models use Instagram success to develop their careers, such as [[Rosie Roff]] who worked as a fashion model before being discovered via Instagram and gaining work as a [[ring girl]] in American boxing. In some cases, Instagram provides unsigned models with a platform to attract the attention of agencies and talent scouts.<ref name=Saul>{{cite newspaper|title=Instafamous: Meet the social media influencers redefining celebrity|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/instagram-model-natasha-oakley-iskra-lawrence-kayla-itsines-kendall-jenner-jordyn-woods-a6907551.html|date=27 March 2016|author=Heather Saul|newspaper=Independent|access-date=2017-09-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901063025/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/instagram-model-natasha-oakley-iskra-lawrence-kayla-itsines-kendall-jenner-jordyn-woods-a6907551.html|archive-date=2017-09-01|url-status=live}}</ref> American model [[Matthew Noszka]] entered the profession as a result of being discovered on Instagram by [[Wilhelmina Models]].<ref name=ABC>{{cite news|title=From Construction to High Fashion: How Instagram Helped This Male Model Get Discovered|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/construction-high-fashion-instagram-helped-male-model-discovered/story?id=29253900|date=26 February 2015|author1=Mara Schiavocampo|author2=Claire Pedersen|author3=Timor Balaish|author4=Lauren Effron|publisher=ABC News|access-date=2017-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229052246/http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/construction-high-fashion-instagram-helped-male-model-discovered/story?id=29253900|archive-date=2017-12-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Instagram model concept originated in the late 2000s, when the boyfriends of fashion bloggers such as [[Rumi Neely]] and [[Chiara Ferragni]] began photographing their girlfriends in various outfits.<ref name=Spinks>{{cite web|title=What It's Actually Like to Be an Instagram Model|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/what-instagram-models-actually-do|work=Vice|author=Rosie Spinks|date=7 August 2016}}</ref> Instagram models often attempt to become social media influencers and engage in [[influencer marketing]],<ref name=Saul/> promoting products such as fashion brands and detox teas.<ref name=Spinks/> High-profile influencers are able to earn thousands of US dollars for promoting commercial brands. When choosing whom to employ, brands have become less concerned with the number of followers an influencer has and more focussed on their [[engagement marketing]] strategy.

Young Douglas was the son of William Young Kinleyside, a businessman and lawyer. Business brought his father to New York on several occasions, and eventually, five-year old Douglas, with his sister Hazel, were brought to America as second cabin class passengers, on board the British steamer ''[[Mauritania]]'', which sailed from the Port of Liverpool on 29 October 1910, and arrived at the Port of New York, 4 November. He became an American citizen in 1939. Adopting the stage name \"Don Douglas\", he became a singer and actor in musical shows such as ''Footlites''. In 1928, his big break came when he won glowing revues for his performance in ''[[The Desert Song]]'' in the Orpheum Theatre in Chicago. This would eventually lead to his career in talking pictures.\n\n==Film==\nDouglas appeared in over 100 films from the late 1920s to the 1940s including ''[[The Great Gabbo]]'' (1929), ''[[Life Begins (film)|Life Begins]]'' (1932), ''[[Men in White (1934 film)|Men in White]]'' (1934), ''[[Madame X (1937 film)|Madame X]]'' (1937), ''[[Cheers for Miss Bishop]]'' (1941), ''[[Now, Voyager]]'' (1942), ''[[Little Tokyo, U.S.A.]]'' (1942), ''[[Tall in the Saddle]]'' (1944), ''[[Murder, My Sweet]]'' (1944) and ''[[Show Business (1944 film)|Show Business]]'' (1944). One of his more prominent roles was also one of his last: In ''[[Gilda]]'' (1946), he plays the man who pretends to marry [[Rita Hayworth]] but is really a henchman of [[Glenn Ford]]'s character.\n\n==Radio==\nDouglas was a one-man cast on ''[[The Black Castle (radio program)|The Black Castle]]''. He played all roles in each episode and was the announcer.<ref name=\"dunningota\">{{cite book |url= https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn |url-access= registration |quote= The Black Castle, mystery-terror. |last=Dunning |first=John |authorlink=John Dunning (detective fiction author) |title=On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio |date=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-19-507678-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn/page/95 95] |edition=Revised |accessdate=2019-10-02}}</ref> A review of ''The Black Castle'' in the trade publication [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] complimented Douglas's handling of multiple roles in the drama.

Young Douglas was the son of William Young Kinleyside, a businessman and lawyer. Business brought his father to New York on several occasions, and eventually, five-year old Douglas, with his sister Hazel, were brought to America as second cabin class passengers, on board the British steamer ''[[Mauritania]]'', which sailed from the Port of Liverpool on 29 October 1910, and arrived at the Port of New York, 4 November. He became an American citizen in 1939. Adopting the stage name \"Don Douglas\", he became a singer and actor in musical shows such as ''Footlites''. In 1928, his big break came when he won glowing revues for his performance in ''[[The Desert Song]]'' in the Orpheum Theatre in Chicago. This would eventually lead to his career in talking pictures.\n\n==Film==\nDouglas appeared in over 100 films from the late 1920s to the 1940s including ''[[The Great Gabbo]]'' (1929), ''[[Life Begins (film)|Life Begins]]'' (1932), ''[[Men in White (1934 film)|Men in White]]'' (1934), ''[[Madame X (1937 film)|Madame X]]'' (1937), ''[[Cheers for Miss Bishop]]'' (1941), ''[[Now, Voyager]]'' (1942), ''[[Little Tokyo, U.S.A.]]'' (1942), ''[[Tall in the Saddle]]'' (1944), ''[[Murder, My Sweet]]'' (1944) and ''[[Show Business (1944 film)|Show Business]]'' (1944). One of his more prominent roles was also one of his last: In ''[[Gilda]]'' (1946), he plays the man who pretends to marry [[Rita Hayworth]] but is really a henchman of [[Glenn Ford]]'s character.\n\n==Radio==\nDouglas was a one-man cast on ''[[The Black Castle (radio program)|The Black Castle]]''. He played all roles in each episode and was the announcer.<ref name=\"dunningota\">{{cite book |url= https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn |url-access= registration |quote= The Black Castle, mystery-terror. |last=Dunning |first=John |authorlink=John Dunning (detective fiction author) |title=On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio |date=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-19-507678-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn/page/95 95] |edition=Revised |accessdate=2019-10-02}}</ref> A review of ''The Black Castle'' in the trade publication [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] complimented Douglas's handling of multiple roles in the drama. Bob Francis wrote: \"Except for the fact that he is inclined to ham the wizard, making the role often seem more silly than awesome, Douglas puts on a good 15 minutes.
