In particular, Woods was instrumental in the construction and then utilization of [[geiger counter]]s for analysis during experimentation. She was the only woman present when the reactor went [[Criticality (status)|critical]]. She worked with Fermi on the [[Manhattan Project]], and, together with her first husband John Marshall, she subsequently helped solve the problem of [[xenon]] poisoning at the [[Hanford Site|Hanford]] [[plutonium]] production site, and supervised the construction and operation of Hanford's plutonium production reactors.\n\nAfter the war, she became a fellow at Fermi's [[Institute for Nuclear Studies]] at the University of Chicago. She later worked at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], and [[New York University]], where she became a professor in 1962. Her research involved [[Particle physics|high-energy physics]], [[astrophysics]] and [[cosmology]]. In 1966 she divorced Marshall and married Nobel laureate [[Willard Libby]]. She became a professor at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], and a staff member at [[RAND Corporation]]. In later life she became interested in ecological and environmental issues, and she devised a method of using the isotope ratios in tree rings to study [[Climate change (general concept)|climate change]]. She was a strong advocate of [[food irradiation]] as a means of killing harmful [[bacteria]].\n\n== Early life ==\nLeona Harriet Woods was born on a farm in [[La Grange, Illinois]] on August 9, 1919, the second of five children of Weightstill Arno Woods, a lawyer, and his wife Mary Leona Holderness Woods. She had two sisters and two brothers.<ref name=\"NNDB\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/280/000225602/ |title=Leona Woods |publisher=Soylent Communications |accessdate=April 15, 2013 }}</ref>{{sfn|Ware|Braukman|2004|pp=385\u2013387}} She graduated from [[Lyons Township High School]] in La Grange at 14,<ref name=\"NNDB\" /> and received her [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] in [[chemistry]] from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1938, at the age of 18.{{sfn|Ware|Braukman|2004|pp=385\u2013387}}{{sfn|Libby|1979|pp=28\u201329}}\n\nAfter passing her qualifying exams in chemistry, she approached the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] laureate [[James Franck]] about being his graduate student, having been impressed by a talk he gave in 1939 on [[Brillouin zone]]s.{{sfn|Libby|1979|p=29}}  Franck accepted, but told her that when he was young his professor had warned him that as a Jewish academic, he would starve to death. Franck therefore warned Woods that \"You are a woman and you will starve to death.\"{{sfn|Libby|1979|p=30}} Despite the fact that Franck did not look malnourished, she took the warning seriously, and decided to instead become a graduate student of [[Robert Mulliken]], who would one day become a Nobel laureate himself.{{sfn|Libby|1979|p=30}}\n\nMulliken allowed her to choose her own research problem, and edited the final version before it appeared in the ''[[Physical Review]]''.{{sfn|Libby|1979|p=30}} Her doctoral thesis, \"On the Silicon Oxide Bands\",<ref>{{cite journal |  title = On the Silicon Oxide Bands |last = Woods |first=L.

She met [[Herbert L. Anderson|Herbert Anderson]], who was working for [[Enrico Fermi]]. The two would go swimming together in [[Lake Michigan]] every afternoon at 5 pm. Anderson discovered that Woods was adept with vacuum technology from her research, and as soon as her PhD was finished, he hired her to work with the [[boron trifluoride]] detectors used to measure [[neutron flux]].{{sfn|Libby|1979|p=85}}\n\nFermi's group constructed a [[nuclear reactor]] known as [[Chicago Pile-1]] under the stands of [[Stagg Field]], the University's abandoned [[American football|football]] stadium, where Woods had once played [[Squash (sport)|squash]]. [[Walter Zinn]] did not want a woman involved in the dirty work of placing the [[graphite]] blocks, but Woods had plenty of work to do with the detectors and [[thermocouple]]s, and used a small stack of graphite of her own to measure the effects of a [[radium]]-[[beryllium]] source on [[manganese]] foil to obtain a measure of the [[neutron cross section]] in order to calibrate the detectors.{{sfn|Libby|1979|pp=86\u201387}} Woods was the only woman present when the reactor went critical, asking Fermi \"When do we become scared?\"{{sfn|Fermi|1954|p=197}}\n\n[[File:ChicagoPileTeam.png|left|thumb|360px|In this 1946 photo of the Chicago pile team, Woods is the only woman, fourth from the left in the middle row.]]\n[[Laura Fermi]] remembered Woods as \"a tall young girl built like an athlete, who could do a man's job and do it well. She was the only woman physicist in Enrico's group. At that time, her mother, who was also endowed with inexhaustible energy, was running a small farm near Chicago almost by herself. To relieve Mrs. Woods of some work, Leona divided her time between atoms and potatoes.\"{{sfn|Fermi|1954|p=179}}\n\nLike many scientists working on the project, Woods affected a casual attitude towards the danger posed by radiation. After a morning with [[Willard Libby]] soldering a canister containing a mixture of radium salt and beryllium metal, Woods absorbed about 200 [[Roentgen (unit)|roentgens]], and her [[white blood cell]] count halved. The doctors gave her a lecture on how a woman has only a fixed number of egg cells, a proposition that Woods was skeptical of.

In particular, Woods was instrumental in the construction and then utilization of [[geiger counter]]s for analysis during experimentation. She was the only woman present when the reactor went [[Criticality (status)|critical]]. She worked with Fermi on the [[Manhattan Project]], and, together with her first husband John Marshall, she subsequently helped solve the problem of [[xenon]] poisoning at the [[Hanford Site|Hanford]] [[plutonium]] production site, and supervised the construction and operation of Hanford's plutonium production reactors.\n\nAfter the war, she became a fellow at Fermi's [[Institute for Nuclear Studies]] at the University of Chicago. She later worked at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], and [[New York University]], where she became a professor in 1962. Her research involved [[Particle physics|high-energy physics]], [[astrophysics]] and [[cosmology]]. In 1966 she divorced Marshall and married Nobel laureate [[Willard Libby]]. She became a professor at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], and a staff member at [[RAND Corporation]]. In later life she became interested in ecological and environmental issues, and she devised a method of using the isotope ratios in tree rings to study [[Climate change (general concept)|climate change]]. She was a strong advocate of [[food irradiation]] as a means of killing harmful [[bacteria]].\n\n== Early life ==\nLeona Harriet Woods was born on a farm in [[La Grange, Illinois]] on August 9, 1919, the second of five children of Weightstill Arno Woods, a lawyer, and his wife Mary Leona Holderness Woods.

Franck therefore warned Woods that \"You are a woman and you will starve to death.\"{{sfn|Libby|1979|p=30}} Despite the fact that Franck did not look malnourished, she took the warning seriously, and decided to instead become a graduate student of [[Robert Mulliken]], who would one day become a Nobel laureate himself.{{sfn|Libby|1979|p=30}}\n\nMulliken allowed her to choose her own research problem, and edited the final version before it appeared in the ''[[Physical Review]]''.{{sfn|Libby|1979|p=30}} Her doctoral thesis, \"On the Silicon Oxide Bands\",<ref>{{cite journal |  title = On the Silicon Oxide Bands |last = Woods |first=L.

She met [[Herbert L. Anderson|Herbert Anderson]], who was working for [[Enrico Fermi]]. The two would go swimming together in [[Lake Michigan]] every afternoon at 5 pm. Anderson discovered that Woods was adept with vacuum technology from her research, and as soon as her PhD was finished, he hired her to work with the [[boron trifluoride]] detectors used to measure [[neutron flux]].{{sfn|Libby|1979|p=85}}\n\nFermi's group constructed a [[nuclear reactor]] known as [[Chicago Pile-1]] under the stands of [[Stagg Field]], the University's abandoned [[American football|football]] stadium, where Woods had once played [[Squash (sport)|squash]]. [[Walter Zinn]] did not want a woman involved in the dirty work of placing the [[graphite]] blocks, but Woods had plenty of work to do with the detectors and [[thermocouple]]s, and used a small stack of graphite of her own to measure the effects of a [[radium]]-[[beryllium]] source on [[manganese]] foil to obtain a measure of the [[neutron cross section]] in order to calibrate the detectors.{{sfn|Libby|1979|pp=86\u201387}} Woods was the only woman present when the reactor went critical, asking Fermi \"When do we become scared?\"{{sfn|Fermi|1954|p=197}}\n\n[[File:ChicagoPileTeam.png|left|thumb|360px|In this 1946 photo of the Chicago pile team, Woods is the only woman, fourth from the left in the middle row.]]\n[[Laura Fermi]] remembered Woods as \"a tall young girl built like an athlete, who could do a man's job and do it well.

To relieve Mrs. Woods of some work, Leona divided her time between atoms and potatoes.\"{{sfn|Fermi|1954|p=179}}\n\nLike many scientists working on the project, Woods affected a casual attitude towards the danger posed by radiation. After a morning with [[Willard Libby]] soldering a canister containing a mixture of radium salt and beryllium metal, Woods absorbed about 200 [[Roentgen (unit)|roentgens]], and her [[white blood cell]] count halved. The doctors gave her a lecture on how a woman has only a fixed number of egg cells, a proposition that Woods was skeptical of. She considered that the important thing was that the solder was done correctly.{{sfn|Libby|1979|p=155}} When the team moved to their new home at [[Argonne National Laboratory|Argonne]], Woods had a dormitory all to herself.{{sfn|Libby|1979|p=156}}\n\nWoods married John Marshall in July 1943.

Within a few years she became the first person to successfully breed rattlesnakes in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]].<ref name=Tribune>\u201cDeadly snakes are just pets to this woman\u201d.

At the time, it was very unusual for a woman to be a curator of reptiles,<ref name=Ross>Ross, Andrea Friederici. ''Let the Lions Roar''.

We are not born with it.  Children love snakes as naturally as they love dogs and cats.  Don\u2019t be afraid of a reptile\u2019s tongue.

Wiley quickly found new work as a curator of reptiles at the [[Brookfield Zoo]], which opened in the western suburbs of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] in 1934, and she brought the library's collection of 236 reptiles and amphibians with her.<ref name=Ross/><ref name=NewZoo>\"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,754329,00.html New Zoo]\".

''Chicago Daily Tribune''.

She restrained it, but was bitten, and she requested to be taken to a hospital.  Unfortunately, her only vial of cobra [[antivenom]] (from the [[Haffkine Institute]]) was accidentally broken<ref name=SafetyIssues/> and the hospital had antivenom serums only for [[North America]]n snakes.
