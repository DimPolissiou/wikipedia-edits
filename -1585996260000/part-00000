As of 2020, the series is the 2nd longest-running Cartoon Network show.\n\nBocquelet based several of the series' characters on rejected characters from his previous commercial work and making its premise a mixture of \"family shows and school shows\", which Cartoon Network was heavily interested in. He pitched ''The Amazing World of Gumball'' to the network and [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner Broadcasting]] executive Daniel Lennard subsequently greenlit production of the series. It is the first series to be produced by Cartoon Network Studios Europe, and is currently co-produced with Studio SOI in [[Germany]] and Great Marlborough Productions Limited.\n\nOne unique feature of the series is its lack of stylistic unity. Characters are designed, filmed, and animated using multiple styles and techniques (stylised [[traditional animation]], [[puppetry]], [[computer animation|CGI]], [[stop motion]], [[Flash animation]], [[live-action]], etc.)<ref>[http://www.toonzone.net/2011/04/toonzone-interviews-the-amazing-world-of-gumball-creator-ben-bocquelet/ Interview with Ben Bocquelet] in Toonzone</ref>\n\nThe series has made multiple stylistic changes throughout its production, specifically in the transition between its first and second seasons. Such changes include character redesigns, an increase in the use of [[Visual effects|VFX]], higher quality animation, and a shift towards a much darker, more [[Satire|satirical]] comedic style.\n\nBocquelet later stated on September 6, 2016 that the sixth season would be his last time working on the show, but production could continue without him. However, 2 years later on October 7, 2018, he retweeted an article stating that the sixth season will be the last, though the author of the article made a follow-up article saying that more seasons are still possible.<ref name=\"regularcapital.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.regularcapital.com/2018/10/more-seasons-of-the-amazing-world-of-gumball-is-still-a-possiblity/|title=More Seasons Of The Amazing World Of Gumball Is Still A Possibility|website=RegularCapital|date=October 12, 2018}}</ref> A six-episode miniseries titled ''Darwin's Yearbook'' was announced for the series in November.<ref>https://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/cn-brings-back-gumball-with-special-darwins-yearbook-episodes/</ref>\n\n==Production==\nWhen [[Cartoon Network Studios Europe]] was created in 2007, [[Ben Bocquelet]] was hired to help people pitch their projects to [[Cartoon Network|the network]].

Gumball attends school with his siblings at Elmore Junior High, where throughout the series he interacts with his various middle school classmates, most prominently his love interest Penny Fitzgerald (also Gallagher).\n\nOne prominent feature of the series since its third season is \"The Void\", a dimension inside of Elmore where all the universe's mistakes reside. This includes references to aspects of reality as well as in-series elements. Rob (Charles Phillip, [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] for episodes \"The Nemesis\" to \"The Disaster\") is a background character from the first two seasons who became trapped in The Void after becoming \"irrelevant\". He later escapes in Season 3, after which he becomes Gumball's nemesis and main antagonist. He is shown to be aware of his fictional existence in the Season 4 episode \"The Disaster\", and his hatred towards Gumball is a result of his role as the protagonist.<ref>{{Citation|last=Cartoon Network|title=Gumball {{!}} Gumball VS Rob {{!}} Cartoon Network|date=2016-09-06|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnn9eZ8Ap74|accessdate=2016-09-29}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of The Amazing World of Gumball episodes}}\n{{: List of The Amazing World of Gumball episodes}}\n\n===Crossovers===\nOn September 17, 2015, series creator [[Ben Bocquelet]] announced on his Twitter page that a crossover episode with an unknown show would air as part of the [[The Amazing World of Gumball (season 5)|fifth season]].

They frequently find themselves involved in various shenanigans around the city, during which time they interact with fellow family members\u2014younger sister Anais, mother Nicole and father Richard\u2014[[List of The Amazing World of Gumball characters|and an extended supporting cast of characters]]. As of 2020, the series is the 2nd longest-running Cartoon Network show.\n\nBocquelet based several of the series' characters on rejected characters from his previous commercial work and making its premise a mixture of \"family shows and school shows\", which Cartoon Network was heavily interested in. He pitched ''The Amazing World of Gumball'' to the network and [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner Broadcasting]] executive Daniel Lennard subsequently greenlit production of the series. It is the first series to be produced by Cartoon Network Studios Europe, and is currently co-produced with Studio SOI in [[Germany]] and Great Marlborough Productions Limited.\n\nOne unique feature of the series is its lack of stylistic unity. Characters are designed, filmed, and animated using multiple styles and techniques (stylised [[traditional animation]], [[puppetry]], [[computer animation|CGI]], [[stop motion]], [[Flash animation]], [[live-action]], etc.)<ref>[http://www.toonzone.net/2011/04/toonzone-interviews-the-amazing-world-of-gumball-creator-ben-bocquelet/ Interview with Ben Bocquelet] in Toonzone</ref>\n\nThe series has made multiple stylistic changes throughout its production, specifically in the transition between its first and second seasons.

Gumball attends school with his siblings at Elmore Junior High, where throughout the series he interacts with his various middle school classmates, most prominently his love interest Penny Fitzgerald (also Gallagher).\n\nOne prominent feature of the series since its third season is \"The Void\", a dimension inside of Elmore where all the universe's mistakes reside. This includes references to aspects of reality as well as in-series elements. Rob (Charles Phillip, [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] for episodes \"The Nemesis\" to \"The Disaster\") is a background character from the first two seasons who became trapped in The Void after becoming \"irrelevant\". He later escapes in Season 3, after which he becomes Gumball's nemesis and main antagonist. He is shown to be aware of his fictional existence in the Season 4 episode \"The Disaster\", and his hatred towards Gumball is a result of his role as the protagonist.<ref>{{Citation|last=Cartoon Network|title=Gumball {{!}} Gumball VS Rob {{!}} Cartoon Network|date=2016-09-06|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnn9eZ8Ap74|accessdate=2016-09-29}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of The Amazing World of Gumball episodes}}\n{{: List of The Amazing World of Gumball episodes}}\n\n===Crossovers===\nOn September 17, 2015, series creator [[Ben Bocquelet]] announced on his Twitter page that a crossover episode with an unknown show would air as part of the [[The Amazing World of Gumball (season 5)|fifth season]].

Negative [[chronotropic]] properties of beta blockers allow the lifesaving property of heart rate control. Beta blockers are readily titrated to optimal rate control in many pathologic states.\n\nThe antiarrhythmic effects of beta blockers arise from sympathetic nervous system blockade\u2014resulting in depression of [[sinus node]] function and [[atrioventricular node]] conduction, and prolonged [[atrium (anatomy)|atrial]] [[refractory period (cardiac)|refractory period]]s. [[Sotalol]], in particular, has additional antiarrhythmic properties and prolongs [[action potential]] duration through [[potassium channel]] blockade.\n\nBlockade of the sympathetic nervous system on renin release leads to reduced aldosterone via the [[Renin\u2013angiotensin system|renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system]], with a resultant decrease in blood pressure due to decreased sodium and water retention.\n\n==Intrinsic sympathomimetic activity==\n\nAlso referred to as intrinsic sympathomimetic effect, this term is used particularly with beta blockers that can show both agonism and antagonism at a given beta receptor, depending on the concentration of the agent (beta blocker) and the concentration of the antagonized agent (usually an endogenous compound, such as norepinephrine). See [[partial agonist]] for a more general description.\n\nSome beta blockers (e.g. [[oxprenolol]], [[pindolol]], [[penbutolol]], [[labetalol]] and [[acebutolol]]) exhibit intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA).  These agents are capable of exerting low-level [[receptor agonist|agonist]] activity at the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor while simultaneously acting as a receptor site [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]]. These agents, therefore, may be useful in individuals exhibiting excessive [[bradycardia]] with sustained beta blocker therapy.\n\nAgents with ISA are not used after myocardial infarctions, as they have not been demonstrated to be beneficial. They may also be less effective than other beta blockers in the management of [[Angina pectoris|angina]] and [[tachyarrhythmia]].<ref name=\"Rossi\">{{cite book | editor= Rossi S | title=Australian

However, this effect tends to be small because the activity of \u03b2<sub>2</sub> receptors is overshadowed by the more dominant vasoconstricting \u03b1<sub>1</sub> receptors. By far the greatest effect of beta blockers remains in the heart.

Negative [[chronotropic]] properties of beta blockers allow the lifesaving property of heart rate control. Beta blockers are readily titrated to optimal rate control in many pathologic states.\n\nThe antiarrhythmic effects of beta blockers arise from sympathetic nervous system blockade\u2014resulting in depression of [[sinus node]] function and [[atrioventricular node]] conduction, and prolonged [[atrium (anatomy)|atrial]] [[refractory period (cardiac)|refractory period]]s. [[Sotalol]], in particular, has additional antiarrhythmic properties and prolongs [[action potential]] duration through [[potassium channel]] blockade.\n\nBlockade of the sympathetic nervous system on renin release leads to reduced aldosterone via the [[Renin\u2013angiotensin system|renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system]], with a resultant decrease in blood pressure due to decreased sodium and water retention.\n\n==Intrinsic sympathomimetic activity==\n\nAlso referred to as intrinsic sympathomimetic effect, this term is used particularly with beta blockers that can show both agonism and antagonism at a given beta receptor, depending on the concentration of the agent (beta blocker) and the concentration of the antagonized agent (usually an endogenous compound, such as norepinephrine). See [[partial agonist]] for a more general description.\n\nSome beta blockers (e.g. [[oxprenolol]], [[pindolol]], [[penbutolol]], [[labetalol]] and [[acebutolol]]) exhibit intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA).  These agents are capable of exerting low-level [[receptor agonist|agonist]] activity at the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor while simultaneously acting as a receptor site [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]]. These agents, therefore, may be useful in individuals exhibiting excessive [[bradycardia]] with sustained beta blocker therapy.\n\nAgents with ISA are not used after myocardial infarctions, as they have not been demonstrated to be beneficial. They may also be less effective than other beta blockers in the management of [[Angina pectoris|angina]] and [[tachyarrhythmia]].<ref name=\"Rossi\">{{cite book | editor= Rossi S | title=Australian
