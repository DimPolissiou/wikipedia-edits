French explorers, missionaries, and fur traders began exploring the region in the 17th century, encountering the [[Dakota people|Dakota]] and [[Ojibwe]]/[[Anishinaabe]] tribes. Much of what is now Minnesota was part of the [[Louisiana Territory|vast French holding of Louisiana]], which was [[Louisiana Purchase|purchased by the United States]] in 1803. Following several territorial reorganizations, Minnesota in its current form was admitted as the country's 32nd state on May 11, 1858. Like many Midwestern states, it remained sparsely populated and centered on lumber and agriculture. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, many European immigrants, mainly from [[Scandinavia]] and [[Germany]], began to settle the state, which remains a center of [[Scandinavian American]] and [[German American]] culture.\n\nMinnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Frohlich |first1=Thomas |title=America's Most (and Least) Educated States |url=http://247wallst.com/special-report/2014/09/23/americas-most-and-least-educated-states/2/ |website=24/7 WallStreet |accessdate=February 2, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203020651/http://247wallst.com/special-report/2014/09/23/americas-most-and-least-educated-states/2/ |archive-date=February 3, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> In recent years, its economy has greatly diversified, shifting from traditional activities such as agriculture and resource extraction to services and finance.

Nevertheless, farming remained prevalent. Minnesota's economy was hit hard by the [[Great Depression]], resulting in lower prices for farmers, layoffs among iron miners, and labor unrest. Compounding the adversity, western Minnesota and the Dakotas were hit by drought from 1931 to 1935. [[New Deal]] programs provided some economic turnaround. The [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] and other programs around the state established some jobs for Indians on their reservations, and the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] of 1934 provided the tribes with a mechanism of self-government. This gave Natives a greater voice within the state, and promoted more respect for tribal customs because religious ceremonies and [[native language]]s were no longer suppressed.<ref name=\"Gilman\"/>\n\nAfter [[World War II]], industrial development quickened. New technology increased farm productivity through automation of [[feedlot]]s for hogs and cattle, machine milking at dairy farms, and raising chickens in large buildings.

Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota is the only state in the nation that did not vote for [[Ronald Reagan]] in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota has gone for the Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Republican [[Richard Nixon]].\n\nBoth the Democratic and Republican parties have major-party status in Minnesota, but its state-level \"Democratic\" party is actually a separate party, officially known as the [[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party]] (DFL). It was formed out of a 1944 alliance of the Minnesota Democratic and [[Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party|Farmer-Labor]] parties.\n\nThe state has had active third-party movements. The [[Reform Party of the United States|Reform Party]], now the [[Independence Party of Minnesota|Independence Party]], was able to elect former mayor of [[Brooklyn Park, Minnesota|Brooklyn Park]] and [[professional wrestler]] [[Jesse Ventura]] to the [[Minnesota gubernatorial election, 1998|governorship in 1998]].

In the 2006 mid-term election, Democrats were elected to all state offices, except governor and lieutenant governor, where Republicans [[Tim Pawlenty]] and [[Carol Molnau]] narrowly won re-election. The DFL posted double-digit gains in both houses of the legislature, elected Amy Klobuchar to the U.S. Senate, and increased the party's U.S. House caucus by one.

French explorers, missionaries, and fur traders began exploring the region in the 17th century, encountering the [[Dakota people|Dakota]] and [[Ojibwe]]/[[Anishinaabe]] tribes. Much of what is now Minnesota was part of the [[Louisiana Territory|vast French holding of Louisiana]], which was [[Louisiana Purchase|purchased by the United States]] in 1803. Following several territorial reorganizations, Minnesota in its current form was admitted as the country's 32nd state on May 11, 1858. Like many Midwestern states, it remained sparsely populated and centered on lumber and agriculture.

Compounding the adversity, western Minnesota and the Dakotas were hit by drought from 1931 to 1935. [[New Deal]] programs provided some economic turnaround. The [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] and other programs around the state established some jobs for Indians on their reservations, and the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] of 1934 provided the tribes with a mechanism of self-government.

Following this, unlikely hero and backup quarterback [[Todd Collins (quarterback)|Todd Collins]] led the Redskins to the victory, keeping their playoff hopes alive. Things continued to turn in the right direction behind Collins, who led the Redskins to a 22\u201310 victory on ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' over the [[2007 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] and routs of the [[2007 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] and rival [[2007 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] in the final two weeks to propel the Redskins to 9\u20137 and the final playoff spot in the [[2007\u201308 NFL playoffs|NFL playoffs]].\n\nThe Washington Redskins trailed 13\u20130 entering the 4th quarter to the [[2007 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] in the Wild Card Playoffs, but rallied back to take a 14\u201313 lead, but Redskins kicker [[Shaun Suisham]] missed a field goal later in the game, and the Seahawks scored on the next drive and converted the [[two-point conversion]]. To close the game, Todd Collins threw two interceptions, each returned for touchdowns, and the Redskins fell 35\u201314.\n\n====Jim Zorn era (2008\u20132009)====\n=====2008=====\n[[File:Jason Campbell.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Quarterback [[Jason Campbell]] played for the Redskins from 2005\u20132009]]\n{{Main|2008 Washington Redskins season}}\n\nThe Washington Redskins looked to return to the playoffs in [[2008 NFL season|2008]] but did not succeed, finishing 8\u20138. After Joe Gibbs announced his retirement, [[Jim Zorn]] was hired as head coach, and brought in a [[West Coast Offense]].\n\nThe season started about as well as it could have, as the Washington Redskins started the season 6\u20132, with their two losses coming by a combined 11 points to the [[2008 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] and [[2008 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]]. Furthermore, Redskins star [[Clinton Portis]] led the NFL in rushing yards and Jason Campbell was just 40 pass attempts away from breaking [[Bernie Kosar]]'s record of consecutive passes to start the season without an interception. However, things turned for the worse on the eve of the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 Presidential Election]], when they were routed 23\u20136 by the [[2008 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] and Clinton Portis' injuries finally caught up to him. The Redskins continued to struggle, falling all the way to 7\u20137, with their only win during that six-week period being a 3-point victory of the then-2\u20138 [[2008 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]], who would finish the season 4-12. The Redskins managed to upset the [[2008 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] in Week 16, but were eliminated from playoff contention after the [[2008 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] defeated the [[2008 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] 24\u201317 that same week. The Redskins lost the final game of the season 27\u201324 to the [[2008 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]], despite having a 17\u20137 lead at halftime, losing on a [[Joe Nedney]] field goal as time expired.\n\n=====2009=====\n{{Main|2009 Washington Redskins season}}\nThe Redskins' fortunes continued to slide in 2009, as they lost two of the first four matches, one of which was a 19\u201314 defeat at the hands of the Lions, a team that had not won a game since December 2007. After that, they lost to Carolina on the road and Kansas City at home, the latter match handing another victory to a winless team. On Monday Night Football, the Redskins lost to Philadelphia in a game where Jim Zorn was temporarily relieved of his duties by offensive coordinator [[Sherman Lewis]]. In Week 10, they inflicted a surprise defeat on the Denver Broncos before losing two divisional matches to Dallas and Philadelphia. The Week 13 game against an undefeated Saints team proved another surprise. The Redskins managed to tie at the end of regulation, and in overtime had a chance to break New Orleans' winning streak. However, kicker [[Shaun Suisham]] missed a field goal that would have given them the victory. On their next possession, the Saints scored a FG and won the game 33\u201330. Suisham was cut after the game and signed with Dallas (his original team). The Redskins then routed Oakland in Week 14 before losing their last three games to finish 4-12. The second match with the Cowboys ended in a 16-0 shutout, making for only the second season since 1970 where Washington lost all of its divisional matches. Jim Zorn was fired and replaced by [[Mike Shanahan]] afterwards.\n\n====Mike Shanahan era (2010\u20132013)====\n=====2010=====\n{{main|2010 Washington Redskins season}}\nThe 2010 off-season would bring a surprise when on April 4, Eagles QB [[Donovan McNabb]] forced his team to trade him to the Redskins and was also marred by contract disputes with [[Albert Haynesworth]]. Washington continued an old tradition of playing its arch-rival Cowboys in the first week of the season. Both teams were unimpressive and the Redskins' offense sputtered throughout the game, but they finally won 13-10 after a touchdown pass by [[Tony Romo]] was nullified after a holding call. They hosted the Texans in Week 2, but good all-around offensive performance (especially by McNabb, who passed for 426 yards and a touchdown) failed to secure a win. The game tied at 27-27 and went into overtime where Houston kicker Neil Rackers made a 37-yard FG, ending the match at 30\u201327. After this, the Redskins lost to St. Louis 30-16 before McNabb's return to Philadelphia. Although Washington did not deliver a particularly strong performance, they won 16-12 after Eagles QB Michael Vick was injured and replaced by Kevin Kolb. In Week 5, they hosted Green Bay for only the second time since 1979 (the first was in 2004) and beat them 16\u201313. After losing a Sunday Night match to the Colts, Washington beat Chicago in Week 7. Although McNabb threw two interceptions, the team took advantage of their opponent's porous O-line to sack and pick off [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] four times, winning 17\u201314. After losing a 37-25 trap game in Detroit, the Redskins went on their bye week and returned to host Philadelphia on MNF for the second straight year. As rain fell on Fedex Field, the Eagles proceeded to crush Washington 59\u201328 with eight touchdowns. In contrast to the huge numbers put up by Michael Vick, McNabb looked decidedly unimpressive, with two touchdown passes and three interceptions (one returned for a TD). Just before the game, he had finalized his contract with the Redskins, who gave him a 5-year, $78 million deal and allowing him to (barring unforeseen circumstances) finish out his career in Washington. After beating Tennessee, the Redskins lost four straight games and were removed from playoff contention before beating Jacksonville in Week 16. After losing to New York at home, the Redskins finished the year at 6-10 and once again 4th place in the division.\n\n=====2011=====\n{{main|2011 Washington Redskins season}}\n[[File:Adam Carriker.jpg|thumb|190px|Redskins training camp, 2011]]\nThe McNabb era came to an abrupt end when he was traded to Minnesota in August 2011. The troublesome Albert Haynesworth also headed to New England. After cutting the injury-rattled Clinton Portis, the Redskins had no important offensive players left except for Santana Moss. Mike Shanahan surprised most observers by his decision to name [[John Beck (gridiron football)|John Beck]], an obscure free agent QB, as the starter.\n\nHowever, Shanahan suddenly reversed direction by naming veteran backup [[Rex Grossman]] to the starting position. In Week 1, Grossman threw for 305 yards and two TD passes as the Redskins crushed the Giants 28\u201314, ending a six-game losing streak against that team. After beating the Cardinals in Week 2, the Redskins got off to a surprise 2\u20130 start. In Week 3, they played the Cowboys on MNF and lost a poorly played game where the latter edged them out with six field goals to win 18\u201316.\n\nAfter beating the Rams in Week 4, the Redskins disintegrated from injuries and didn't win another game until Seattle in Week 12. They finished 5-11 following a second win over the eventual champion Giants.\n\n=====2012=====\n{{main|2012 Washington Redskins season}}\n[[File:RG3 2014.jpg|thumb|275px|upright|Quarterback [[Robert Griffin III]] won the league's Offensive Rookie of the Year award in 2012, while also leading the team to their first division title since 1999.]]\nThe Redskins traded several of their high level draft picks to the [[St. Louis Rams]] in order to take Baylor quarterback [[Robert Griffin III]] second overall in the [[2012 NFL Draft]]. These picks included their original sixth selection in the first round, as well as their second round selection, #39 overall, in addition to their first round picks in the 2013 and 2014 drafts. Although the need for a franchise quarterback was obvious, many journalists had doubtes about the value of giving up a lot for a single player. In the opening game of the season, Griffin threw for 320 yards and two TD passes in a 40\u201332 victory over the New Orleans Saints to give the Redskins' their highest scoring game since 2005.\n\nIn Week 2, the team traveled to St. Louis where they lost 24\u201322. A major defensive loss was suffered when linebacker [[Brian Orakpo]] went down from a tear to his left pectoral muscle. Despite widespread complaints from Redskins fans and players about the Rams playing dirty, there was nothing to do but move on to the home opener against Cincinnati. The game started on a bad omen when the Bengals threw a 76-yard TD pass on the opening drive. Although the Redskins responded furiously and played another close match, they lost and injuries continued to pile up as CB Josh Wilson and WR [[Pierre Gar\u00e7on]] went down. They would win their next game on a late game field goal at Tampa Bay, 24\u201322, after the Buccaneers made a 4th quarter comeback to take the lead. The Redskins only won one of their next five games, going into the bye week at 3\u20136.\n\nIn Week 11, the Redskins would face the struggling Philadelphia Eagles in Washington. RGIII would have one of his best games of his career to date, as the Redskins won 31\u20136 with long touchdowns to Santana Moss and Aldrick Robinson. The Redskins would win their next 6 games after that, including a Thanksgiving Day win over the Dallas Cowboys, an overtime win against the eventual champs, the Baltimore Ravens, and a 38\u201321 win over the Cleveland Browns that featured backup rookie quarterback Kirk Cousins as the starter, filling in for RGIII who got an injured knee against the Ravens. The Redskins would win their crucial last game against the Cowboys, which would clinch the division for them and send the Redskins to the playoffs.\n\n=====2013=====\n{{main|2013 Washington Redskins season}}\nAfter winning the NFC East in the previous season, hopes were high for a repeat in 2013. However, these hopes were in vain, as poor play and controversy stirred during the entire year, leading to the disastrous record of 3\u201313. This was the worst record the Redskins have posted since [[1994 Washington Redskins season|1994]]. Even though most players had a down year compared to last season, [[Pierre Gar\u00e7on]] had his greatest season statistically yet. Garcon eventually broke [[Art Monk]]'s 29-year-old franchise record for catches in a single season. Garcon had 113 catches total, which broke Monk's 106 catches in [[1984 Washington Redskins season|1984]] by seven.<ref>{{cite news|last=Maske|first=Mark|title=Pierre Gar\u00e7on breaks Art Monk's Redskins record for catches in a season|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/football-insider/wp/2013/12/22/pierre-garcon-breaks-art-monks-redskins-record-for-catches-in-a-season/|work=Washington Post|accessdate=February 12, 2014|date=December 22, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229134644/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/football-insider/wp/2013/12/22/pierre-garcon-breaks-art-monks-redskins-record-for-catches-in-a-season/|archive-date=December 29, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Washington Redskins fired Shanahan and most of his staff on December 30, 2013.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pelissero|first=Tom|title=Reskins Fire Coach Mike Shanahan|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/redskins/2013/12/30/mike-shanahan-fired-washington/4248213/|work=USA Today|accessdate=December 30, 2013|date=December 30, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231033412/http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/redskins/2013/12/30/mike-shanahan-fired-washington/4248213/|archive-date=December 31, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Jay Gruden era (2014\u20132019)====\n=====2014=====\n{{main|2014 Washington Redskins season}}\nOn January 9, 2014, the Redskins hired [[Jay Gruden]] as their head coach.

Gold face masks were introduced in 1978 and remain as such to this day; previous to that they were grey. From the start of the Joe Gibbs era until 2010, the Redskins were one of three NFL teams that primarily wore their white jerseys at home (the others being the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and [[Miami Dolphins]]). The tradition of wearing white jerseys over burgundy pants at home, which is considered the \"classic\" look, was started by [[Joe Gibbs]] when he took over as coach in 1981. Gibbs was an assistant for the [[History of the San Diego Chargers|San Diego Chargers]] in 1979 and 1980, and the Chargers wore white at home during the tenure of coach [[Don Coryell]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nFrom 1981\u20132009, their burgundy jerseys were primarily used when the opposing team decided to wear white at home, which comes mostly against the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and occasionally the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], and was normally worn over white pants. It was worn on the road against other teams that like to wear white at home for games occurring early in the season. From 1981 through 2000, the Redskins wore their white jerseys over burgundy pants at home almost exclusively. In 1994, as part of a league-wide celebration of the NFL's 75th Anniversary, during certain games the Redskins wore special uniforms which emulated the uniforms worn by the team in its inaugural season as the Washington Redskins, 1937. Both worn over gold pants, the burgundy jerseys featured gold numbers bordered in white and the white jerseys featured burgundy numbers bordered in gold. The most distinctive feature of both colors of the jersey was the patches worn on both sleeves, which were a reproduction of the patches worn on the full-length sleeves of the 1937 jerseys. Worn with these uniforms was a plain burgundy helmet with a gold facemask. In 2001, the Redskins wore burgundy for all home games in the preseason and regular season per a decision by Marty Schottenheimer, their coach for that year. In 2002, the team celebrated the passing of 70 years since its creation as the Boston Braves in 1932, and wore a special home uniform of burgundy jersey over gold pants which roughly resembled the home uniforms used from 1969\u20131978. The helmets used with this special home uniform during that year were a reproduction of the helmets used by the team from 1965\u201369, though they wore white at home in Week 1 against the [[Arizona Cardinals]] and again in Week 17, the latter forcing the Cowboys to use their blue jerseys.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Redskins Adopt 'Retro' Look; 70 Greatest Redskins to be Selected|url=http://www.redskins.com/story.asp?ContentID=10789|publisher=Washington Redskins|date=February 6, 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021013201106/http://www.redskins.com/story.asp?ContentID=10789 |archivedate=October 13, 2002|accessdate=July 23, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Washington Redskins New Uniforms |url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/newlook/redskins/uniforms.html |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=August 27, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519170507/http://espn.go.com/page2/s/newlook/redskins/uniforms.html |archive-date=May 19, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> This special home uniform was also worn during one game in 2003. In 2004, when Joe Gibbs became the coach of the Redskins once again, the team switched back to wearing white jerseys at home; in Gibbs's 16 years as head coach, the team never wore burgundy jerseys at home, even wearing a white throwback jersey in 2007.\n\nTheir white jerseys have provided three basic color combinations, two of which have been previously alluded to in this article. The last combination consists of both white jerseys and pants. That particular combination surfaced in the first game of the 2003 season, when the team was coached by Steve Spurrier, during a nationally televised game against the [[New York Jets]], which led many sports fans and Redskins faithful alike to point out that they had never seen that particular combination before. That year the Redskins wore it two more times. That look didn't appear again until midway through the 2005 season when the Redskins wore it in a road game against the [[History of the St. Louis Rams|St. Louis Rams]]. The Redskins won six straight games, including one in the playoffs against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, wearing that combination and the local media jokingly pointed out that the reason the Redskins were winning was their use of the white over white combination. In the NFC Divisional Playoff game against the eventual 2005 NFC Champion [[2005 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]], the Redskins wore the all-white uniforms, in hopes that they could keep their streak going; however, they lost 20\u201310. The Redskins continued to wear the white jerseys and white pants into the 2006 preseason. In the 2006 season, the Redskins started wearing black cleats, something that hadn't been done for quite a while. It was a surprise because they wore white cleats during the preseason. They would have to wear that color for the rest of the season, because the NFL usually asks teams to choose either black or white cleats to be worn throughout the season.\n\nAfter the white-over-white period which lasted from the mid/late 2005 season into 2006, the classic uniform of white jerseys over burgundy pants reappeared on November 26, 2006, in a home game against the [[2006 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]]. The decision to return to the classic look may have symbolized a desire by the team to turn a new page on their 2006 season, which had been very lackluster previous to that game, the period of success with the white jerseys over white pants having come to an end the previous season. The move may have also been related to the fact that this home game was the second start and first home start of second-year quarterback Jason Campbell, and that the game and the previous week's game were, in the hopes and perceptions of many Redskins fans, the start of the \"Jason Campbell era.\" The Redskins went on to win that game against Carolina, preserving slim hopes of the team's being able to make it to the 2006 playoffs, although they ultimately missed the playoffs.\n\nIn celebration of the franchise's 75th anniversary, the Redskins wore a special [[throwback uniform]] for the September 23, 2007 home game against the [[2007 New York Giants season|New York Giants]]. Players wore a white jersey (in keeping with Gibbs's exclusive use of the color, whereas most other NFL throwback jerseys tend to be dark) with 3 burgundy and 2 gold stripes on each sleeve and the 75th anniversary logo on the left chest. The pants were gold, with one white stripe bordered by a burgundy stripe on each side, running down each side. The helmet was gold-colored with a burgundy \"R\" logo. The helmet and uniform styles (besides the anniversary patch and the position of the upper-most, \"TV\", numbers) were the same as the ones the franchise used during the 1970\u201371 seasons. While this throwback uniform was worn during a home game, it was actually the away uniform for 1970\u201371. (The helmet was discontinued after the 1971 season, while this basic away uniform design, minus the helmet, was used through the 1978 season, as well as during most of the 1969 season.) [[Vince Lombardi]], who coached the Redskins in 1969 before dying during the 1970 pre-season, was the inspiration behind the helmet. Lombardi pushed for the logo, which sat inside a white circle enclosed within a burgundy circle border, with Indian feathers hanging down from the side, because of its similarity to the \"G\" on the helmets worn by his Green Bay Packers for many years.\n\nIn a ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game against the against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in 2008, the Redskins wore a [[monochrome]] look by wearing burgundy jerseys over burgundy pants.<ref>{{cite news|title=Roethlisberger leaves at halftime, Leftwich leads Steelers past Skins|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=281103028|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures, LLC|website=[[ESPN.com]]|date=November 3, 2008|accessdate=November 22, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107195557/http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=281103028|archive-date=January 7, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> This combination made two further appearances the following season against the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and [[New York Giants]].

The following year, the team would wear an updated throwback uniform of the 1937 team - notable for a helmet which, rather than being blank or including team insignia, featured a pattern intended to invoke the simple leather helmets worn at the time - in a game against the [[Carolina Panthers]], in honor of the team's first championship season.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sessler|first=Marc|title=Washington Redskins' alternate unis revealed|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000088275/article/washington-redskins-alternate-unis-revealed|website=National Football League|date=October 31, 2012|accessdate=June 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121021450/http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000088275/article/washington-redskins-alternate-unis-revealed|archive-date=November 21, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Redskins Launch 80th Anniversary Campaign|url=https://www.redskins.com/news/redskins-launch-80th-anniversary-campaign-7335687|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Redskins.com|date=May 10, 2012|accessdate=April 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, a newly implemented NFL rule stated that teams could not wear alternate helmets (thus limiting them to one helmet) on account of player safety.

Following this, unlikely hero and backup quarterback [[Todd Collins (quarterback)|Todd Collins]] led the Redskins to the victory, keeping their playoff hopes alive. Things continued to turn in the right direction behind Collins, who led the Redskins to a 22\u201310 victory on ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' over the [[2007 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] and routs of the [[2007 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] and rival [[2007 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] in the final two weeks to propel the Redskins to 9\u20137 and the final playoff spot in the [[2007\u201308 NFL playoffs|NFL playoffs]].\n\nThe Washington Redskins trailed 13\u20130 entering the 4th quarter to the [[2007 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] in the Wild Card Playoffs, but rallied back to take a 14\u201313 lead, but Redskins kicker [[Shaun Suisham]] missed a field goal later in the game, and the Seahawks scored on the next drive and converted the [[two-point conversion]]. To close the game, Todd Collins threw two interceptions, each returned for touchdowns, and the Redskins fell 35\u201314.\n\n====Jim Zorn era (2008\u20132009)====\n=====2008=====\n[[File:Jason Campbell.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Quarterback [[Jason Campbell]] played for the Redskins from 2005\u20132009]]\n{{Main|2008 Washington Redskins season}}\n\nThe Washington Redskins looked to return to the playoffs in [[2008 NFL season|2008]] but did not succeed, finishing 8\u20138. After Joe Gibbs announced his retirement, [[Jim Zorn]] was hired as head coach, and brought in a [[West Coast Offense]].\n\nThe season started about as well as it could have, as the Washington Redskins started the season 6\u20132, with their two losses coming by a combined 11 points to the [[2008 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] and [[2008 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]]. Furthermore, Redskins star [[Clinton Portis]] led the NFL in rushing yards and Jason Campbell was just 40 pass attempts away from breaking [[Bernie Kosar]]'s record of consecutive passes to start the season without an interception. However, things turned for the worse on the eve of the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 Presidential Election]], when they were routed 23\u20136 by the [[2008 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] and Clinton Portis' injuries finally caught up to him. The Redskins continued to struggle, falling all the way to 7\u20137, with their only win during that six-week period being a 3-point victory of the then-2\u20138 [[2008 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]], who would finish the season 4-12. The Redskins managed to upset the [[2008 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] in Week 16, but were eliminated from playoff contention after the [[2008 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] defeated the [[2008 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] 24\u201317 that same week. The Redskins lost the final game of the season 27\u201324 to the [[2008 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]], despite having a 17\u20137 lead at halftime, losing on a [[Joe Nedney]] field goal as time expired.\n\n=====2009=====\n{{Main|2009 Washington Redskins season}}\nThe Redskins' fortunes continued to slide in 2009, as they lost two of the first four matches, one of which was a 19\u201314 defeat at the hands of the Lions, a team that had not won a game since December 2007. After that, they lost to Carolina on the road and Kansas City at home, the latter match handing another victory to a winless team. On Monday Night Football, the Redskins lost to Philadelphia in a game where Jim Zorn was temporarily relieved of his duties by offensive coordinator [[Sherman Lewis]]. In Week 10, they inflicted a surprise defeat on the Denver Broncos before losing two divisional matches to Dallas and Philadelphia. The Week 13 game against an undefeated Saints team proved another surprise. The Redskins managed to tie at the end of regulation, and in overtime had a chance to break New Orleans' winning streak. However, kicker [[Shaun Suisham]] missed a field goal that would have given them the victory. On their next possession, the Saints scored a FG and won the game 33\u201330. Suisham was cut after the game and signed with Dallas (his original team). The Redskins then routed Oakland in Week 14 before losing their last three games to finish 4-12. The second match with the Cowboys ended in a 16-0 shutout, making for only the second season since 1970 where Washington lost all of its divisional matches. Jim Zorn was fired and replaced by [[Mike Shanahan]] afterwards.\n\n====Mike Shanahan era (2010\u20132013)====\n=====2010=====\n{{main|2010 Washington Redskins season}}\nThe 2010 off-season would bring a surprise when on April 4, Eagles QB [[Donovan McNabb]] forced his team to trade him to the Redskins and was also marred by contract disputes with [[Albert Haynesworth]]. Washington continued an old tradition of playing its arch-rival Cowboys in the first week of the season. Both teams were unimpressive and the Redskins' offense sputtered throughout the game, but they finally won 13-10 after a touchdown pass by [[Tony Romo]] was nullified after a holding call. They hosted the Texans in Week 2, but good all-around offensive performance (especially by McNabb, who passed for 426 yards and a touchdown) failed to secure a win. The game tied at 27-27 and went into overtime where Houston kicker Neil Rackers made a 37-yard FG, ending the match at 30\u201327. After this, the Redskins lost to St. Louis 30-16 before McNabb's return to Philadelphia. Although Washington did not deliver a particularly strong performance, they won 16-12 after Eagles QB Michael Vick was injured and replaced by Kevin Kolb. In Week 5, they hosted Green Bay for only the second time since 1979 (the first was in 2004) and beat them 16\u201313. After losing a Sunday Night match to the Colts, Washington beat Chicago in Week 7. Although McNabb threw two interceptions, the team took advantage of their opponent's porous O-line to sack and pick off [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] four times, winning 17\u201314. After losing a 37-25 trap game in Detroit, the Redskins went on their bye week and returned to host Philadelphia on MNF for the second straight year. As rain fell on Fedex Field, the Eagles proceeded to crush Washington 59\u201328 with eight touchdowns. In contrast to the huge numbers put up by Michael Vick, McNabb looked decidedly unimpressive, with two touchdown passes and three interceptions (one returned for a TD). Just before the game, he had finalized his contract with the Redskins, who gave him a 5-year, $78 million deal and allowing him to (barring unforeseen circumstances) finish out his career in Washington. After beating Tennessee, the Redskins lost four straight games and were removed from playoff contention before beating Jacksonville in Week 16. After losing to New York at home, the Redskins finished the year at 6-10 and once again 4th place in the division.\n\n=====2011=====\n{{main|2011 Washington Redskins season}}\n[[File:Adam Carriker.jpg|thumb|190px|Redskins training camp, 2011]]\nThe McNabb era came to an abrupt end when he was traded to Minnesota in August 2011. The troublesome Albert Haynesworth also headed to New England. After cutting the injury-rattled Clinton Portis, the Redskins had no important offensive players left except for Santana Moss. Mike Shanahan surprised most observers by his decision to name [[John Beck (gridiron football)|John Beck]], an obscure free agent QB, as the starter.\n\nHowever, Shanahan suddenly reversed direction by naming veteran backup [[Rex Grossman]] to the starting position. In Week 1, Grossman threw for 305 yards and two TD passes as the Redskins crushed the Giants 28\u201314, ending a six-game losing streak against that team. After beating the Cardinals in Week 2, the Redskins got off to a surprise 2\u20130 start. In Week 3, they played the Cowboys on MNF and lost a poorly played game where the latter edged them out with six field goals to win 18\u201316.\n\nAfter beating the Rams in Week 4, the Redskins disintegrated from injuries and didn't win another game until Seattle in Week 12. They finished 5-11 following a second win over the eventual champion Giants.\n\n=====2012=====\n{{main|2012 Washington Redskins season}}\n[[File:RG3 2014.jpg|thumb|275px|upright|Quarterback [[Robert Griffin III]] won the league's Offensive Rookie of the Year award in 2012, while also leading the team to their first division title since 1999.]]\nThe Redskins traded several of their high level draft picks to the [[St. Louis Rams]] in order to take Baylor quarterback [[Robert Griffin III]] second overall in the [[2012 NFL Draft]]. These picks included their original sixth selection in the first round, as well as their second round selection, #39 overall, in addition to their first round picks in the 2013 and 2014 drafts. Although the need for a franchise quarterback was obvious, many journalists had doubtes about the value of giving up a lot for a single player. In the opening game of the season, Griffin threw for 320 yards and two TD passes in a 40\u201332 victory over the New Orleans Saints to give the Redskins' their highest scoring game since 2005.\n\nIn Week 2, the team traveled to St. Louis where they lost 24\u201322. A major defensive loss was suffered when linebacker [[Brian Orakpo]] went down from a tear to his left pectoral muscle. Despite widespread complaints from Redskins fans and players about the Rams playing dirty, there was nothing to do but move on to the home opener against Cincinnati. The game started on a bad omen when the Bengals threw a 76-yard TD pass on the opening drive. Although the Redskins responded furiously and played another close match, they lost and injuries continued to pile up as CB Josh Wilson and WR [[Pierre Gar\u00e7on]] went down. They would win their next game on a late game field goal at Tampa Bay, 24\u201322, after the Buccaneers made a 4th quarter comeback to take the lead. The Redskins only won one of their next five games, going into the bye week at 3\u20136.\n\nIn Week 11, the Redskins would face the struggling Philadelphia Eagles in Washington. RGIII would have one of his best games of his career to date, as the Redskins won 31\u20136 with long touchdowns to Santana Moss and Aldrick Robinson. The Redskins would win their next 6 games after that, including a Thanksgiving Day win over the Dallas Cowboys, an overtime win against the eventual champs, the Baltimore Ravens, and a 38\u201321 win over the Cleveland Browns that featured backup rookie quarterback Kirk Cousins as the starter, filling in for RGIII who got an injured knee against the Ravens. The Redskins would win their crucial last game against the Cowboys, which would clinch the division for them and send the Redskins to the playoffs.\n\n=====2013=====\n{{main|2013 Washington Redskins season}}\nAfter winning the NFC East in the previous season, hopes were high for a repeat in 2013. However, these hopes were in vain, as poor play and controversy stirred during the entire year, leading to the disastrous record of 3\u201313. This was the worst record the Redskins have posted since [[1994 Washington Redskins season|1994]]. Even though most players had a down year compared to last season, [[Pierre Gar\u00e7on]] had his greatest season statistically yet. Garcon eventually broke [[Art Monk]]'s 29-year-old franchise record for catches in a single season. Garcon had 113 catches total, which broke Monk's 106 catches in [[1984 Washington Redskins season|1984]] by seven.<ref>{{cite news|last=Maske|first=Mark|title=Pierre Gar\u00e7on breaks Art Monk's Redskins record for catches in a season|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/football-insider/wp/2013/12/22/pierre-garcon-breaks-art-monks-redskins-record-for-catches-in-a-season/|work=Washington Post|accessdate=February 12, 2014|date=December 22, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229134644/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/football-insider/wp/2013/12/22/pierre-garcon-breaks-art-monks-redskins-record-for-catches-in-a-season/|archive-date=December 29, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Washington Redskins fired Shanahan and most of his staff on December 30, 2013.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pelissero|first=Tom|title=Reskins Fire Coach Mike Shanahan|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/redskins/2013/12/30/mike-shanahan-fired-washington/4248213/|work=USA Today|accessdate=December 30, 2013|date=December 30, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231033412/http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/redskins/2013/12/30/mike-shanahan-fired-washington/4248213/|archive-date=December 31, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Jay Gruden era (2014\u20132019)====\n=====2014=====\n{{main|2014 Washington Redskins season}}\nOn January 9, 2014, the Redskins hired [[Jay Gruden]] as their head coach.

Gold face masks were introduced in 1978 and remain as such to this day; previous to that they were grey. From the start of the Joe Gibbs era until 2010, the Redskins were one of three NFL teams that primarily wore their white jerseys at home (the others being the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and [[Miami Dolphins]]). The tradition of wearing white jerseys over burgundy pants at home, which is considered the \"classic\" look, was started by [[Joe Gibbs]] when he took over as coach in 1981. Gibbs was an assistant for the [[History of the San Diego Chargers|San Diego Chargers]] in 1979 and 1980, and the Chargers wore white at home during the tenure of coach [[Don Coryell]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nFrom 1981\u20132009, their burgundy jerseys were primarily used when the opposing team decided to wear white at home, which comes mostly against the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and occasionally the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], and was normally worn over white pants. It was worn on the road against other teams that like to wear white at home for games occurring early in the season. From 1981 through 2000, the Redskins wore their white jerseys over burgundy pants at home almost exclusively. In 1994, as part of a league-wide celebration of the NFL's 75th Anniversary, during certain games the Redskins wore special uniforms which emulated the uniforms worn by the team in its inaugural season as the Washington Redskins, 1937. Both worn over gold pants, the burgundy jerseys featured gold numbers bordered in white and the white jerseys featured burgundy numbers bordered in gold. The most distinctive feature of both colors of the jersey was the patches worn on both sleeves, which were a reproduction of the patches worn on the full-length sleeves of the 1937 jerseys. Worn with these uniforms was a plain burgundy helmet with a gold facemask. In 2001, the Redskins wore burgundy for all home games in the preseason and regular season per a decision by Marty Schottenheimer, their coach for that year. In 2002, the team celebrated the passing of 70 years since its creation as the Boston Braves in 1932, and wore a special home uniform of burgundy jersey over gold pants which roughly resembled the home uniforms used from 1969\u20131978. The helmets used with this special home uniform during that year were a reproduction of the helmets used by the team from 1965\u201369, though they wore white at home in Week 1 against the [[Arizona Cardinals]] and again in Week 17, the latter forcing the Cowboys to use their blue jerseys.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Redskins Adopt 'Retro' Look; 70 Greatest Redskins to be Selected|url=http://www.redskins.com/story.asp?ContentID=10789|publisher=Washington Redskins|date=February 6, 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021013201106/http://www.redskins.com/story.asp?ContentID=10789 |archivedate=October 13, 2002|accessdate=July 23, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Washington Redskins New Uniforms |url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/newlook/redskins/uniforms.html |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=August 27, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519170507/http://espn.go.com/page2/s/newlook/redskins/uniforms.html |archive-date=May 19, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> This special home uniform was also worn during one game in 2003. In 2004, when Joe Gibbs became the coach of the Redskins once again, the team switched back to wearing white jerseys at home; in Gibbs's 16 years as head coach, the team never wore burgundy jerseys at home, even wearing a white throwback jersey in 2007.\n\nTheir white jerseys have provided three basic color combinations, two of which have been previously alluded to in this article. The last combination consists of both white jerseys and pants. That particular combination surfaced in the first game of the 2003 season, when the team was coached by Steve Spurrier, during a nationally televised game against the [[New York Jets]], which led many sports fans and Redskins faithful alike to point out that they had never seen that particular combination before. That year the Redskins wore it two more times. That look didn't appear again until midway through the 2005 season when the Redskins wore it in a road game against the [[History of the St. Louis Rams|St. Louis Rams]]. The Redskins won six straight games, including one in the playoffs against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, wearing that combination and the local media jokingly pointed out that the reason the Redskins were winning was their use of the white over white combination. In the NFC Divisional Playoff game against the eventual 2005 NFC Champion [[2005 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]], the Redskins wore the all-white uniforms, in hopes that they could keep their streak going; however, they lost 20\u201310. The Redskins continued to wear the white jerseys and white pants into the 2006 preseason. In the 2006 season, the Redskins started wearing black cleats, something that hadn't been done for quite a while. It was a surprise because they wore white cleats during the preseason. They would have to wear that color for the rest of the season, because the NFL usually asks teams to choose either black or white cleats to be worn throughout the season.\n\nAfter the white-over-white period which lasted from the mid/late 2005 season into 2006, the classic uniform of white jerseys over burgundy pants reappeared on November 26, 2006, in a home game against the [[2006 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]]. The decision to return to the classic look may have symbolized a desire by the team to turn a new page on their 2006 season, which had been very lackluster previous to that game, the period of success with the white jerseys over white pants having come to an end the previous season. The move may have also been related to the fact that this home game was the second start and first home start of second-year quarterback Jason Campbell, and that the game and the previous week's game were, in the hopes and perceptions of many Redskins fans, the start of the \"Jason Campbell era.\" The Redskins went on to win that game against Carolina, preserving slim hopes of the team's being able to make it to the 2006 playoffs, although they ultimately missed the playoffs.\n\nIn celebration of the franchise's 75th anniversary, the Redskins wore a special [[throwback uniform]] for the September 23, 2007 home game against the [[2007 New York Giants season|New York Giants]]. Players wore a white jersey (in keeping with Gibbs's exclusive use of the color, whereas most other NFL throwback jerseys tend to be dark) with 3 burgundy and 2 gold stripes on each sleeve and the 75th anniversary logo on the left chest. The pants were gold, with one white stripe bordered by a burgundy stripe on each side, running down each side. The helmet was gold-colored with a burgundy \"R\" logo. The helmet and uniform styles (besides the anniversary patch and the position of the upper-most, \"TV\", numbers) were the same as the ones the franchise used during the 1970\u201371 seasons. While this throwback uniform was worn during a home game, it was actually the away uniform for 1970\u201371. (The helmet was discontinued after the 1971 season, while this basic away uniform design, minus the helmet, was used through the 1978 season, as well as during most of the 1969 season.) [[Vince Lombardi]], who coached the Redskins in 1969 before dying during the 1970 pre-season, was the inspiration behind the helmet. Lombardi pushed for the logo, which sat inside a white circle enclosed within a burgundy circle border, with Indian feathers hanging down from the side, because of its similarity to the \"G\" on the helmets worn by his Green Bay Packers for many years.\n\nIn a ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game against the against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in 2008, the Redskins wore a [[monochrome]] look by wearing burgundy jerseys over burgundy pants.<ref>{{cite news|title=Roethlisberger leaves at halftime, Leftwich leads Steelers past Skins|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=281103028|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures, LLC|website=[[ESPN.com]]|date=November 3, 2008|accessdate=November 22, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107195557/http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=281103028|archive-date=January 7, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> This combination made two further appearances the following season against the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and [[New York Giants]].

The following year, the team would wear an updated throwback uniform of the 1937 team - notable for a helmet which, rather than being blank or including team insignia, featured a pattern intended to invoke the simple leather helmets worn at the time - in a game against the [[Carolina Panthers]], in honor of the team's first championship season.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sessler|first=Marc|title=Washington Redskins' alternate unis revealed|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000088275/article/washington-redskins-alternate-unis-revealed|website=National Football League|date=October 31, 2012|accessdate=June 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121021450/http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000088275/article/washington-redskins-alternate-unis-revealed|archive-date=November 21, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Redskins Launch 80th Anniversary Campaign|url=https://www.redskins.com/news/redskins-launch-80th-anniversary-campaign-7335687|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Redskins.com|date=May 10, 2012|accessdate=April 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, a newly implemented NFL rule stated that teams could not wear alternate helmets (thus limiting them to one helmet) on account of player safety.

C. Sproul]] and [[William Lane Craig]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== Jewish Precursors ===\nAccording to [[Edgar J.

Paul's preaching on Mars Hill in Acts 17:22-31). During the [[Apostolic Fathers|subapostolic]] age Christianity was already competing with Judaism as well as with various other religions and sects in the Greco-Roman world. Christian apologetics can be first seen in the <nowiki>''</nowiki>Preaching of Peter<nowiki>''</nowiki> ([[Gospel of Peter]]), but the first explicitly apologetic work comes from [[Quadratus of Athens]] (c. 125 CE) in which he writes a defense of the faith to emperor [[Hadrian]]. Only a fragment, quoted by [[Eusebius]], has survived to our day:<ref name=\":0\" /><blockquote>\"But the works of our Saviour were always present, for they were genuine:\u2014those that were healed, and those that were raised from the dead, who were seen not only when they were healed and when they were raised, but were also always present; and not merely while the Saviour was on earth, but also after his death, they were alive for quite a while, so that some of them lived even to our day.\" (''Church History'' iv. 3. 2)</blockquote>One of the first comprehensive attacks on Christianity came from the Greek philosopher [[Celsus]], who wrote ''[[The True Word]]'' (c.175 CE), a polemic criticizing Christians as being unprofitable members of society.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ferguson|first1=Everett|title=Backgrounds of Early Christianity|date=1993|publisher=William B.

In the first half of the 20th century many [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalists]] became well known apologists. Some of the best known are [[R. A. Torrey]] and [[John Gresham Machen]]. [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Norman Geisler, [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[John Warwick Montgomery]] and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] [[Francis Schaeffer]] were among the most prolific Christian apologists in the latter half of the 20th century and into the 21st, while [[Gordon Clark]] and [[Cornelius Van Til]] started a new school of philosophical apologetics called [[presuppositional apologetics|presuppositionalism]], which is popular in [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] circles.\n\nOthers include [[Douglas Groothuis]], [[Josh McDowell]], [[Hugo Anthony Meynell]], [[Timothy J. Keller]], [[Francis Collins]], [[Vishal Mangalwadi]], [[Richard Bauckham]], [[Craig A. Evans|Craig Evans]], [[Darrell Bock]], [[John F. MacArthur]], [[Michael R. Licona]] and [[John Lennox]].\n\n==Terminology and origin==\nThe original Greek ''[[apologia]]'' (\u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1, from \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03ad\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9, ''apologeomai'', \"speak in return, defend oneself\") was a formal verbal defense, either in response to accusation or prosecution in a court of law.  The defense of [[Socrates]] as presented by [[Apology (Plato)|Plato]] and [[Apology (Xenophon)|Xenophon]] was an ''apologia'' against charges of \"corrupting the young, and \u2026 not believing in the gods in whom the city believes, but in other [[daemon (classical mythology)|''daimonia'']] that are novel\".<ref>Plato, ''Apology'' 24b; compared to Christian apologetics by Anders-Christian Jacobsen, \"Apologetics and Apologies\u2014Some Definitions,\" in ''Continuity and Discontinuity in Early Christian Apologetics'' (Peter Lang, 2009), p. 14.</ref>\n\nIn later use 'apologia' sometimes took a literary form in early Christian discourse as an example of the integration of educated Christians into the cultural life of the [[Roman Empire]], particularly during the [[Little Peace of the Church|\"little peace\" of the 3rd century]],<ref>Kevin Butcher, ''Roman Syria and the Near East'' (Getty Publications, 2003) p. 378.</ref> and of their participation in the Greek intellectual movement broadly known as the [[Second Sophistic]].<ref>Graham Anderson,  ''The Second Sophistic: A Cultural Phenomenon in the Roman Empire'' (Routledge, 1993, 2003), p. 203.</ref> The Christian apologists of the early Church did not reject [[Greek philosophy]], but attempted to show the positive value of Christianity in dynamic relation to the Greek rationalist tradition.<ref>Jacobsen, \"Apologetics and Apologies,'' p. 6.''</ref>\n\nIn the 2nd century, apologetics was a defense or explanation of Christianity,<ref>Jacobsen, \"Apologetics and Apologies,'' p. 8.''</ref> addressed to those standing in opposition and those yet to form an opinion, such as [[Roman emperor|emperors]] and other authority figures, or potential converts.<ref name=\"Jacobsen p. 14\">Jacobsen, \"Apologetics and Apologies,'' p. 14.''</ref> The earliest [[Acts of the Martyrs|martyr narrative]] has the spokesman for the persecuted present a defense in the apologetic mode: Christianity was a rational religion that worshiped only God, and although Christians were law-abiding citizens willing to honor the emperor, their belief in a single divinity prevented them from taking the loyalty oaths that acknowledged the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|emperor's divinity]].<ref>Maureen A. Tillby, \"North Africa\", in ''Cambridge History of Christianity: Origins to Constantine'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), vol. 1, p. 388, citing the ''[[Scillitan Martyrs|Martyrum Scillitanorum Acta]]''.</ref>\n\nThe apologetic [[historiography]] in the ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]'' presented Christianity as a religious movement at home within the Roman Empire and no threat to it and was a model for the first major [[church history|historian of the Church]], Eusebius.<ref>Margaret M. Mitchell, \"Gentile Christianity,\" p. 107, and \"Emergence of the Written Record\" p. 193, in ''Cambridge History of Christianity'', vol. 1.</ref> Apologetics might also be directed to Christians already within the community explain their beliefs and justify positions.<ref name=\"Jacobsen p. 14\"/> [[Origen]]'s apologetic ''[[Celsus|Contra Celsum]]'', for instance, provided a defense against the arguments of a critic dead for decades to provide answers to doubting Christians lacking immediate answers to the questions raised. Apologetic literature was an important medium for the formation of early Christian identity.<ref>Jacobsen, \"Apologetics and Apologies,'' p. 14 ''et passim''.''</ref>\n\nIn addition to Origen and Tertullian, early Christian apologists include [[Justin Martyr]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], and the author of the [[Epistle to Diognetus]].<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of Apologetics|last=Dulles|first=Avery Robert Cardinal|publisher=Ignatius Press|year=2005|isbn=0898709334|location=San Francisco|pages=31\u201342}}</ref> [[Augustine of Hippo]] was a significant apologist of the [[Patristics|Patristic]] era.<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of Apologetics|last=Dulles|first=Avery Robert Cardinal|publisher=Ignatius Press|year=2005|isbn=0898709334|location=San Francisco}}</ref> Some scholars regard apologetics as a distinct [[literary genre]] exhibiting commonalities of style and form, content, and strategies of [[argumentation]].

Christian apologists defend and comment on various books of the Bible. Some scholars who have engaged in the defense of biblical inerrancy include [[Robert Dick Wilson]], [[Gleason Archer]], Norman Geisler and [[R. C. Sproul]].

Two very popular arguments against the existence of God are the hiddenness argument and the argument from evil. The hiddenness argument tries to show that a perfectly loving God's existence is incompatible with the existence of nonresistant nonbelievers. The argument from evil tries to show that the existence of evil renders God's existence unlikely or impossible. \n\n====Presuppositional apologetics====\n{{Main article|Presuppositional apologetics}}\n\nPresuppositional apologetics is a [[Calvinism|Reformed]] [[Protestantism|Protestant]] methodology which claims that [[presupposition (philosophy)|presuppositions]] are essential to any philosophical position and that there are no \"neutral\" assumptions from which a Christian can reason in common with a non-Christian.<ref name=\"Presup\">{{cite_encyclopedia|author=John M.

H. Th. Vollenhoven]], [[Herman Dooyeweerd]], [[Hendrik G. Stoker]], [[Herman Bavinck]], and [[Abraham Kuyper]]. Bahnsen describes Van Til's approach to Christian apologetics as pointing out the difference in ultimate principles between Christians and non-Christians and then showing that the non-Christian principles reduce to absurdity.<ref>Greg Bahnsen, ''Van Til's Apologetic'', P&R Publishing, 1998, {{ISBN|0-87552-098-7}}, pp. 275\u201377.</ref> In practice, this school utilizes what has come to be known as the [[transcendental argument for the existence of God]].\n\nClark held that the Scriptures constituted the [[axiom]]s of Christian thought, which could not be questioned, though their consistency could be discussed.<ref name=\"Presup\" /> A consequence of this position is that God's existence can never be demonstrated, either by empirical means or by philosophical argument. In ''The Justification of Knowledge'', the Calvinist theologian [[Robert L.

Torrey]] and [[John Gresham Machen]]. [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Norman Geisler, [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[John Warwick Montgomery]] and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] [[Francis Schaeffer]] were among the most prolific Christian apologists in the latter half of the 20th century and into the 21st, while [[Gordon Clark]] and [[Cornelius Van Til]] started a new school of philosophical apologetics called [[presuppositional apologetics|presuppositionalism]], which is popular in [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] circles.\n\nOthers include [[Douglas Groothuis]], [[Josh McDowell]], [[Hugo Anthony Meynell]], [[Timothy J. Keller]], [[Francis Collins]], [[Vishal Mangalwadi]], [[Richard Bauckham]], [[Craig A. Evans|Craig Evans]], [[Darrell Bock]], [[John F. MacArthur]], [[Michael R.

The defense of [[Socrates]] as presented by [[Apology (Plato)|Plato]] and [[Apology (Xenophon)|Xenophon]] was an ''apologia'' against charges of \"corrupting the young, and \u2026 not believing in the gods in whom the city believes, but in other [[daemon (classical mythology)|''daimonia'']] that are novel\".<ref>Plato, ''Apology'' 24b; compared to Christian apologetics by Anders-Christian Jacobsen, \"Apologetics and Apologies\u2014Some Definitions,\" in ''Continuity and Discontinuity in Early Christian Apologetics'' (Peter Lang, 2009), p. 14.</ref>\n\nIn later use 'apologia' sometimes took a literary form in early Christian discourse as an example of the integration of educated Christians into the cultural life of the [[Roman Empire]], particularly during the [[Little Peace of the Church|\"little peace\" of the 3rd century]],<ref>Kevin Butcher, ''Roman Syria and the Near East'' (Getty Publications, 2003) p. 378.</ref> and of their participation in the Greek intellectual movement broadly known as the [[Second Sophistic]].<ref>Graham Anderson,  ''The Second Sophistic: A Cultural Phenomenon in the Roman Empire'' (Routledge, 1993, 2003), p. 203.</ref> The Christian apologists of the early Church did not reject [[Greek philosophy]], but attempted to show the positive value of Christianity in dynamic relation to the Greek rationalist tradition.<ref>Jacobsen, \"Apologetics and Apologies,'' p. 6.''</ref>\n\nIn the 2nd century, apologetics was a defense or explanation of Christianity,<ref>Jacobsen, \"Apologetics and Apologies,'' p. 8.''</ref> addressed to those standing in opposition and those yet to form an opinion, such as [[Roman emperor|emperors]] and other authority figures, or potential converts.<ref name=\"Jacobsen p. 14\">Jacobsen, \"Apologetics and Apologies,'' p. 14.''</ref> The earliest [[Acts of the Martyrs|martyr narrative]] has the spokesman for the persecuted present a defense in the apologetic mode: Christianity was a rational religion that worshiped only God, and although Christians were law-abiding citizens willing to honor the emperor, their belief in a single divinity prevented them from taking the loyalty oaths that acknowledged the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|emperor's divinity]].<ref>Maureen A.

Christian apologists defend and comment on various books of the Bible. Some scholars who have engaged in the defense of biblical inerrancy include [[Robert Dick Wilson]], [[Gleason Archer]], Norman Geisler and [[R. C. Sproul]].

The term ''contemporary history'' has been in use at least since the early 19th century.<ref>For example, ''Edinburgh review'', Volume 12 (1808) [https://books.google.com/books?id=szEeAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA480 p. 480] (cf., There is this general distinction between contemporary history and all other history, \u2014that the former is a witness, the latter a judge. The opinions of a contemporary author on the events which he records, are only then authority, when the impression made on a bystander happens to be a material part of the case; nor is this any exception to the maxim, that his business is to testify, not to lecture. On facts, however, he is paramount evidence; and that, not only in the age immediately succeeding him, but also, which is generally forgotten, to the latest times. The modern historian, who consults original authorities through the-medium of some later predecessor, descends from the character of a judge to that of a faithful reporter of decisions.)</ref>\n\nContemporary history is [[Political history|politically]] dominated by the [[Cold War]] (1945\u201391) between the United States and [[Soviet Union]] whose effects were felt across the world. The confrontation, which was mainly fought through [[proxy war]]s and through intervention in the internal politics of smaller nations, ultimately ended with the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and [[Warsaw Pact]] in 1991, following the [[Revolutions of 1989]]. The latter stages and aftermath of the Cold War enabled the [[democratisation]] of much of Europe, Africa, and Latin America. In the Middle East, the period after 1945 was dominated by [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|conflict involving the new state of Israel]] and the rise of [[petroleum politics]], as well as the growth of [[Islamism]] after the 1980s. The first supranational organisations of government, such as the United Nations and [[European Union]], emerged during the period after 1945, while the European [[colonial empire]]s in Africa and Asia collapsed, gone by 1975. [[Counterculture]]s rose and the [[sexual revolution]] transformed [[Social history|social]] relations in western countries between the 1960s and 1980s, epitomised by the [[Protests of 1968]]. Living standards rose sharply across the [[Developed country|developed world]] because of the [[Post-World War II economic boom|post-war economic boom]], whereby such major economies as Japan and [[West Germany]] emerged. The [[culture of the United States]], especially [[consumerism]], spread widely. By the 1960s, many western countries had begun [[deindustrialization|deindustrializing]]; in their place, [[globalization]] led to the emergence of new industrial centres, such as Japan, [[Taiwan]] and later China, which exported consumer goods to [[developed countries]].\n\n[[history of science|Science]] began transforming after 1945: [[History of spaceflight|spaceflight]], [[nuclear technology]], [[laser]] and [[semiconductor]] technology were developed alongside [[molecular biology]] and [[genetics]], [[particle physics]], and the [[Standard Model]] of [[history of quantum field theory|quantum field theory]].  Meanwhile, the first computers were created, followed by the Internet, beginning the [[Information Age]].\n\nNuclear technology gave rise to the 1950-epoch of the scientific timescale of [[Before Present]] (alternatively \"Before Physics\") (BP), making the [[postmodern]] contemporary the first era of the \"After Present\".\n\n==Timeline==\n{{main|Timelines of modern history#Contemporary period}}\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:800 height:185\nPlotArea = width:725 height:155 left:65 bottom:20\nAlignBars = justify\nColors = \n    id:time value:rgb(0.7,0.7,1) # \n    id:period value:rgb(1,0.7,0.5) # \n    id:age value:rgb(0.95,0.85,0.5) # \n    id:era value:rgb(1,0.85,0.5) # \n    id:eon value:rgb(1,0.85,0.7) # \n    id:filler value:gray(0.8) # background bar\n    id:black value:black\n\nPeriod     = from:1900 till:2020\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:10 start:1900 \nScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:1900\n\nPlotData =\n  align:center textcolor:black fontsize:8 mark:(line,black) width:11 shift:(0,-5)\n \n  bar:Technology color:era \n  from:1900 till:1945.67 text:[[Machine Age]]\n  from:1945.67 till:1948.5 text:[[Vacuum tube|Tube]]\n  from:1948.5 till:1958.7 text:[[Transistor]]\n  from:1958.7 till:1970 shift:(0,2) text:[[Integrated circuits|Integrated]]\n  from:1958.7 till:1970 shift:(0,-8) text:[[Integrated circuits|circuit]]\n  from:1970 till:2019.3333 text:[[Information Age]]\n  from:2010 till:2019.3333 text:[[Big Data]]\n  bar:Conflicts color:era \n  from:1914.57 till:1918.86 text:[[WWI]]\n  from:1918.86 till:1939.666 text:[[Interwar period]]\n  from:1939.666 till:1945.667 text:[[WWII]]\n  from:1945.67 till:1962 text:[[Post-war era]]\n  from:2001.69 till:2019.3333 text:[[War on Terror]]\n  bar:Depressions color:era \n  from:1929.83 till:1939 shift:(0,1) text:[[Great Depression|Great]]\n  from:1929.83 till:1939 shift:(0,-9) text:[[Great Depression|Depression]]\n  bar:Cold&nbsp;War color:era \n  from:1945 till:1991.98 text:[[Cold War]]\n  bar:Atomic color:era \n  from:1945.54 till:2019.3333 text:[[Atomic Age]]\n  bar:Space color:era \n  from:1957.76 till:2019.3333 text:[[Space Age]]\n  bar:US&nbsp;Trends color:era \n  from:1900 till:1933.25 shift:(0,-7) text:[[Progressive Era]]\n  from:1900 till:1941.93 shift:(0,7) text:[[Social liberalism]]\n  from:1933.25 till:1941.93 text:[[New Deal]]\n  from:1941.93 till:1960 text:[[Beat Generation|Beatniks]]\n  from:1960 till:1973 text:[[Counterculture of the 1960s|Counterculture]]\n  from:1973 till:1985 shift:(0,1) text:[[New Left]]\n  from:1973 till:1985 shift:(0,-9) text:[[New Right]]\n  from:1985 till:2019.3333 shift:(0,3) text:[[Neoliberalism]]\n  from:1985 till:2019.3333 shift:(0,-7) text:[[Neoconservatism]]\n  bar:Decades color:era \n  from:1900 till:1945 shift:(0,5) text:[[Modernity|Late modernity]]\n  from:1945 till:2020 shift:(0,5) text:[[Postmodernity|Post-Modern]]\n  from:1900 till:1910 text:Aughts\n  from:1910 till:1920 text:Teens\n  from:1920 till:1930 text:Twenties\n  from:1930 till:1940 text:Thirties\n  from:1940 till:1950 text:Forties\n  from:1950 till:1960 text:Fifties\n  from:1960 till:1970 text:Sixties\n  from:1970 till:1980 text:Seventies\n  from:1980 till:1990 text:Eighties\n  from:1990 till:2000 text:Nineties\n  from:2000 till:2010 text:Noughties\n  from:2010 till:2020 text:Tens\n</timeline>\n\n==Modern era==\n{{Main|Modern_history#European decline and the 20th century}}\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the world saw a series of great conflagrations, [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. Near the end of the first world war, there were a series of [[Russian Revolution]]s and a [[Russian Civil War]]. In between the world wars, the 1920s saw a great rise in prosperity where much of the world saw progress and new technology, but this was soon ended by the [[Great Depression]]. During this time, the [[League of Nations]] was formed to deal with global issues, but failed to garner enough support by the leading powers, and a series of crises once again led the world into another epoch of violence.\n\n===Post-1945===\n{{See also|1940s|1950s|1960s|1970s|1980s|1990s|2000s (decade)|Modernity|Postmodernity}}\n\nNotable events during the modern period of [[universal history]] include two [[world war]]s and the [[Cold War]], characterized by the rivalry between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nThe Cold War began in 1947 and lasted until 1991. The [[Space Age]] was concurrent with this time, encompassing the activities related to the [[Space Race]], [[space exploration]], space technology, and the cultural developments influenced by these events. [[Pax Americana]] is an appellation applied to the historical concept of relative liberal peace in the Western world, resulting from the preponderance of power enjoyed by the United States of America after the end of World War II in 1945.\n\nThe post-1945 world experienced the establishment of many new [[State (polity)|states]]. Throughout the post-1945 period, the Cold War was expressed through military coalitions, espionage, weapons development, invasions, propaganda, and competitive technological development. The Soviet Union created the [[Eastern Bloc]] of countries that it occupied, annexing some as [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] and maintaining others as [[satellite state]]s that would later form the [[Warsaw Pact]]. The United States and various Western European countries began a [[Containment]] policy for [[communism]] and forged alliances to this end, including [[NATO]]. The conflict included defense spending, a [[Conventional weapon|conventional]] and [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] [[arms race]], and various [[proxy war]]s; the two superpowers never fought one another directly.\n\nThe post-1989 world saw the end of the totalitarian regimes of the Cold War and the ending of [[client state]] status for many states. The Cold war was effectively ended by the [[Revolutions of 1989]], and the [[Malta Summit]] on 3 December 1989. The [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union was dissolved]] on 26 December 1991. Various \"post-Cold War regimes\" established were democratic republics, though some were [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]]/[[oligarchy|oligarchic]] republics.<ref>Steven Levitsky, Lucan A. Way. Competitive Authoritarianism: Hybrid Regimes After the Cold War. 2010. Pg 3.</ref>\n\nIn Latin America, military regimes supported by the [[CIA]], such as that facilitated by the [[United States intervention in Chile]], also fell (see also [[Covert United States foreign regime change actions]]). The [[Pinochet]] regime collapsed in 1990. In Southeast Asia, the right-wing ''developmental dictatorships''<!-- such as [[Philipine]] (in 1986), [[Indonesia]] (in 1998)--> were overthrown by popular uprisings.<ref>With the [[People Power Revolution]], Corazon Aquino's assumption into power marked the restoration of democracy in the country.</ref>\n\n====Information age and computers====\n[[File:Internet map 1024.jpg|thumb|right|A Visualization of the various routes through a portion of the Internet. Partial map of the Internet based in 2005.]]\nThe [[Information Age]] or Information Era, also commonly known as the Age of the Computer, is an idea that the current age will be characterized by the ability of individuals to transfer information freely, and to have instant access to knowledge that would have been difficult or impossible to find previously. The idea is heavily linked to the concept of a [[Digital Age]] or [[Digital Revolution]], and carries the ramifications of a shift from traditional industry that the Industrial Revolution brought through industrialization, to an economy based around the manipulation of information. The period is generally said to have begun in the latter half of the 20th century, though the particular date varies. The term began its use around the late 1980s and early 1990s, and has been used up to the present with the availability of the Internet.\n\nDuring the late 1990s, both [[Internet directory|Internet directories]] and [[search engine]]s were popular\u2014[[Yahoo!]] and [[Altavista]] (both founded 1995) were the respective industry leaders. By late 2001, the directory model had begun to give way to search engines, tracking the rise of Google (founded 1998), which had developed new approaches to [[relevance (information retrieval)|relevancy ranking]]. Directory features, while still commonly available, became after-thoughts to search engines.

Many other countries also strengthened their anti-terrorism legislation and expanded law enforcement powers. The 'Global War on Terrorism' is the military, political, legal and ideological conflict against [[Islamic terrorism]] and [[Islamic militants]] since the 2001 attacks.\n\n[[File:US Army Afghanistan 2006.jpg|thumb|right|[[U.S. Army]] troops in [[Kunar province]]]]\nThe [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] began in late 2001 and was launched by the United States with the United Kingdom, and [[NATO]]-led, UN authorized [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]] in response to the 11 September attacks. The aim of the invasion was to find the whereabouts of [[Osama bin Laden]] and other high-ranking al-Qaeda members and put them on trial, to destroy the whole organization of [[al-Qaeda]], and to remove the [[Taliban]] regime which supported and gave safe harbor to al-Qaeda. The [[Foreign policy of the George W.

The IS was able to take advantage of social media platforms including Twitter to recruit foreign fighters from around the world and seized significant portions of territory in [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Afghanistan]], and the [[Sinai Peninsula]] of [[Egypt]] from 2013 and ongoing. On the other hand, some violent militant organizations were able to negotiate peace with governments including the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] in the [[Philippines]] in 2014. The presence of IS and the stalemate in the [[Syrian Civil War]] created a [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|migration of refugees to Europe]] and also galvanized and encouraged high-profile terrorism attacks and armed conflicts around the world, such as the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]] and the [[Battle of Marawi]] in the Philippines in 2017.

On 9 May 2010, Europe's Finance Ministers approved a rescue package worth \u20ac750&nbsp;billion aimed at ensuring financial stability across Europe. The [[European Financial Stability Facility]] (EFSF) was a special purpose vehicle financed by members of the eurozone to combat the European sovereign debt crisis. In October 2011 eurozone leaders agreed on another package of measures designed to prevent the collapse of member economies. The three most affected countries, Greece, Ireland and Portugal, collectively account for six percent of eurozone's gross domestic product (GDP). In 2012, [[Eurozone]] finance ministers reached an agreement on a second \u20ac130-billion Greek bailout.

The remaining part of the 21st century and longer-term trends are researched by [[futures studies]], an approach that uses various models and several methods (such as \"[[forecasting]]\" and \"[[backcasting]]\"). Ever since the invention of history, people have searched for \"lessons\" that might be drawn from its study, on the principle that to understand the past is potentially to control the [[future]].<ref>Robert V.

This effort includes collecting quantitative and qualitative data about the possibility, probability, and desirability of change. The plurality of the term \"futures\" in futurology denotes the rich variety of alternative futures, including the subset of preferable futures (normative futures), that can be studied.\n\nPractitioners of the discipline previously concentrated on [[extrapolation|extrapolating]] present [[technological]], economic or social [[wikt:trend|trend]]s, or on attempting to [[prediction|predict]] future trends, but more recently they have started to examine social [[system]]s and [[uncertainty|uncertainties]] and to build [[scenario planning|scenario]]s, question the worldviews behind such scenarios via the [[causal layered analysis]] method (and others) create preferred visions of the future, and use backcasting to derive alternative implementation strategies. Apart from extrapolation and scenarios, many dozens of methods and techniques are used in futures research.<ref>For the multidisciplinary area of research focused at mathematical modeling of historical dynamics that can be applied to events, see [[Cliodynamics]]</ref>\n\n====Socio-technological trends====\nAt the end of the 20th century, the world was at a major crossroads. Throughout the century, more technological advances had been made than in all of preceding history. Computers, the Internet, and other [[modern technology]] radically altered daily lives. Increased [[globalization]], specifically [[Americanization]], had occurred. While not necessarily a threat, it has sparked anti-Western and [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]] sentiment in parts of the developing world, especially the Middle East. The English language has become a leading [[global language]], with people who did not speak it becoming increasingly disadvantaged.\n\nA trend connecting economic and political events in North America, Asia, and the Middle East is the rapidly increasing demand for fossil fuels, which, along with fewer new petroleum finds, greater extraction costs (see [[peak oil]]), and political turmoil, saw the price of gas and oil soar ~500% between 2000 and 2005. In some places, especially in Europe, gas could be $5 a gallon, depending on the currency. Less influential, but omnipresent, is the debate on Turkey's participation in the [[European Union]]. [[New urbanism]] and urban revival continue to be forces in urban planning in the United States.<ref>[http://www.salon.com/2011/12/31/the_bold_urban_future_starts_now/ The bold urban future starts now \u2013 Dream City \u2013 Salon.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, evidence shows that growth of American suburbs still outpaces urban growth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://trends.truliablog.com/2012/10/even-after-the-housing-bust-americans-still-love-the-suburbs/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=13 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130412015232/http://trends.truliablog.com/2012/10/even-after-the-housing-bust-americans-still-love-the-suburbs/ |archivedate=12 April 2013  }}</ref>\n\n===Challenges and problems===\n[[File:World distributionofwealth GDP and population by region.gif|thumb|right|World [[distribution of wealth]] and population in 2000.]]\nIn the contemporary era, several issues are faced in the world.\n\nFirst of all, wealth is concentrated among the [[G8]] and Western [[industrialized nations]], along with several Asian nations and [[OPEC]] countries.

The changes of climate over the past century, have been [[attribution of recent climate change|attributed to various factors]] which have resulted in a [[global warming]]. This warming is the increase in the [[Instrumental temperature record|average temperature]] of the Earth's near-surface air and oceans since the mid-20th century and its projected continuation. Some effects on both the [[natural environment]] and [[civilization|human life]] are, at least in part, already being attributed to global warming. A 2001 report by the IPCC suggests that [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|glacier retreat]], [[Ice shelf#Ice shelf disruption|ice shelf disruption]] such as that of the [[Larsen Ice Shelf]], [[sea level rise]], changes in rainfall patterns, and increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events are attributable in part to global warming.<ref name=\"tar_wg2\">{{Cite web|title=Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.

[[Emerging technologies]] cover various cutting-edge developments in the emergence and convergence of technology, including transportation, information technology, [[biotechnology]], [[robotics]] and [[applied mechanics]], and [[material science]]. Their status and possible effects involve controversy over the degree of social impact or the viability of the technologies. Though, these represent new and significant developments within a field; converging technologies represent previously distinct fields which are in some way moving towards stronger inter-connection and similar goals.\n\nThe first fully functional [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] was Columbia (designated OV-102), launched into Earth orbit in April 1981. In 1996, Shuttle mission [[STS-75]] conducted research in space with the [[electrodynamic tether]] generator and other tether configurations. In 135 missions, the program suffered with two shuttles destroyed.<ref>For more, see [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]].</ref> The successful landing at Kennedy Space Center after completing STS-135 concluded the shuttle program.  The [[Commercial Orbital Transportation Services]] (COTS) program began in 2006. The [[Space Shuttle retirement|retirement of NASA's Space Shuttle fleet]] took place from March to July 2011.\n\nThere are [[list of spaceports|various spaceports]], including [[spaceport]]s of [[human spaceflight]] and other [[launch system]]s ([[space logistics]]). [[Private spaceflight]] is flight beyond the [[K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line]]<ref>This is above the nominal [[edge of space]] at 100 km (62 mi) Earth's altitude. See also: [[Turbopause]]; [[Low Earth orbit|Low]], [[Medium Earth orbit|Medium]], and [[High Earth orbit]].</ref> that is conducted and paid for by an entity other than a government agency. [[Commercialization of space]] is the use of equipment sent into or through outer space to provide goods or services of commercial value, either by a corporation or state. [[Space trade]] plans and predictions began in the 1960s. [[Spacecraft propulsion]]<ref>There are many different methods, in conventional and unconventional propulsion systems. Each method has drawbacks and advantages, and spacecraft propulsion is an active area of research. However, most spacecraft today are propelled by forcing a gas from the back/rear of the vehicle at very high speed through a [[rocket engine nozzle|supersonic de Laval nozzle]]. This sort of engine is called a [[rocket engine]].</ref> is any [[propulsion|method used to accelerate]] [[spacecraft]] and artificial [[satellite]]s.\n\nNASA announced in 2011 that its [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] captured photographic evidence of possible liquid water on Mars during warm seasons. On 6 August 2012, the Mars Science Laboratory [[Curiosity (rover)|Curiosity]], the most elaborate Martian exploration vehicle to date, landed on Mars. After the [[WMAP]] observations of the [[cosmic microwave background]], information was released in 2011 of the work done by the [[Planck Surveyor]], estimating the age of the Universe to 13.8&nbsp;billion years old (a 100 million years older than previously thought).

On facts, however, he is paramount evidence; and that, not only in the age immediately succeeding him, but also, which is generally forgotten, to the latest times. The modern historian, who consults original authorities through the-medium of some later predecessor, descends from the character of a judge to that of a faithful reporter of decisions.)</ref>\n\nContemporary history is [[Political history|politically]] dominated by the [[Cold War]] (1945\u201391) between the United States and [[Soviet Union]] whose effects were felt across the world. The confrontation, which was mainly fought through [[proxy war]]s and through intervention in the internal politics of smaller nations, ultimately ended with the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and [[Warsaw Pact]] in 1991, following the [[Revolutions of 1989]]. The latter stages and aftermath of the Cold War enabled the [[democratisation]] of much of Europe, Africa, and Latin America. In the Middle East, the period after 1945 was dominated by [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|conflict involving the new state of Israel]] and the rise of [[petroleum politics]], as well as the growth of [[Islamism]] after the 1980s. The first supranational organisations of government, such as the United Nations and [[European Union]], emerged during the period after 1945, while the European [[colonial empire]]s in Africa and Asia collapsed, gone by 1975. [[Counterculture]]s rose and the [[sexual revolution]] transformed [[Social history|social]] relations in western countries between the 1960s and 1980s, epitomised by the [[Protests of 1968]]. Living standards rose sharply across the [[Developed country|developed world]] because of the [[Post-World War II economic boom|post-war economic boom]], whereby such major economies as Japan and [[West Germany]] emerged. The [[culture of the United States]], especially [[consumerism]], spread widely. By the 1960s, many western countries had begun [[deindustrialization|deindustrializing]]; in their place, [[globalization]] led to the emergence of new industrial centres, such as Japan, [[Taiwan]] and later China, which exported consumer goods to [[developed countries]].\n\n[[history of science|Science]] began transforming after 1945: [[History of spaceflight|spaceflight]], [[nuclear technology]], [[laser]] and [[semiconductor]] technology were developed alongside [[molecular biology]] and [[genetics]], [[particle physics]], and the [[Standard Model]] of [[history of quantum field theory|quantum field theory]].  Meanwhile, the first computers were created, followed by the Internet, beginning the [[Information Age]].\n\nNuclear technology gave rise to the 1950-epoch of the scientific timescale of [[Before Present]] (alternatively \"Before Physics\") (BP), making the [[postmodern]] contemporary the first era of the \"After Present\".\n\n==Timeline==\n{{main|Timelines of modern history#Contemporary period}}\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:800 height:185\nPlotArea = width:725 height:155 left:65 bottom:20\nAlignBars = justify\nColors = \n    id:time value:rgb(0.7,0.7,1) # \n    id:period value:rgb(1,0.7,0.5) # \n    id:age value:rgb(0.95,0.85,0.5) # \n    id:era value:rgb(1,0.85,0.5) # \n    id:eon value:rgb(1,0.85,0.7) # \n    id:filler value:gray(0.8) # background bar\n    id:black value:black\n\nPeriod     = from:1900 till:2020\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:10 start:1900 \nScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:1900\n\nPlotData =\n  align:center textcolor:black fontsize:8 mark:(line,black) width:11 shift:(0,-5)\n \n  bar:Technology color:era \n  from:1900 till:1945.67 text:[[Machine Age]]\n  from:1945.67 till:1948.5 text:[[Vacuum tube|Tube]]\n  from:1948.5 till:1958.7 text:[[Transistor]]\n  from:1958.7 till:1970 shift:(0,2) text:[[Integrated circuits|Integrated]]\n  from:1958.7 till:1970 shift:(0,-8) text:[[Integrated circuits|circuit]]\n  from:1970 till:2019.3333 text:[[Information Age]]\n  from:2010 till:2019.3333 text:[[Big Data]]\n  bar:Conflicts color:era \n  from:1914.57 till:1918.86 text:[[WWI]]\n  from:1918.86 till:1939.666 text:[[Interwar period]]\n  from:1939.666 till:1945.667 text:[[WWII]]\n  from:1945.67 till:1962 text:[[Post-war era]]\n  from:2001.69 till:2019.3333 text:[[War on Terror]]\n  bar:Depressions color:era \n  from:1929.83 till:1939 shift:(0,1) text:[[Great Depression|Great]]\n  from:1929.83 till:1939 shift:(0,-9) text:[[Great Depression|Depression]]\n  bar:Cold&nbsp;War color:era \n  from:1945 till:1991.98 text:[[Cold War]]\n  bar:Atomic color:era \n  from:1945.54 till:2019.3333 text:[[Atomic Age]]\n  bar:Space color:era \n  from:1957.76 till:2019.3333 text:[[Space Age]]\n  bar:US&nbsp;Trends color:era \n  from:1900 till:1933.25 shift:(0,-7) text:[[Progressive Era]]\n  from:1900 till:1941.93 shift:(0,7) text:[[Social liberalism]]\n  from:1933.25 till:1941.93 text:[[New Deal]]\n  from:1941.93 till:1960 text:[[Beat Generation|Beatniks]]\n  from:1960 till:1973 text:[[Counterculture of the 1960s|Counterculture]]\n  from:1973 till:1985 shift:(0,1) text:[[New Left]]\n  from:1973 till:1985 shift:(0,-9) text:[[New Right]]\n  from:1985 till:2019.3333 shift:(0,3) text:[[Neoliberalism]]\n  from:1985 till:2019.3333 shift:(0,-7) text:[[Neoconservatism]]\n  bar:Decades color:era \n  from:1900 till:1945 shift:(0,5) text:[[Modernity|Late modernity]]\n  from:1945 till:2020 shift:(0,5) text:[[Postmodernity|Post-Modern]]\n  from:1900 till:1910 text:Aughts\n  from:1910 till:1920 text:Teens\n  from:1920 till:1930 text:Twenties\n  from:1930 till:1940 text:Thirties\n  from:1940 till:1950 text:Forties\n  from:1950 till:1960 text:Fifties\n  from:1960 till:1970 text:Sixties\n  from:1970 till:1980 text:Seventies\n  from:1980 till:1990 text:Eighties\n  from:1990 till:2000 text:Nineties\n  from:2000 till:2010 text:Noughties\n  from:2010 till:2020 text:Tens\n</timeline>\n\n==Modern era==\n{{Main|Modern_history#European decline and the 20th century}}\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the world saw a series of great conflagrations, [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. Near the end of the first world war, there were a series of [[Russian Revolution]]s and a [[Russian Civil War]]. In between the world wars, the 1920s saw a great rise in prosperity where much of the world saw progress and new technology, but this was soon ended by the [[Great Depression]]. During this time, the [[League of Nations]] was formed to deal with global issues, but failed to garner enough support by the leading powers, and a series of crises once again led the world into another epoch of violence.\n\n===Post-1945===\n{{See also|1940s|1950s|1960s|1970s|1980s|1990s|2000s (decade)|Modernity|Postmodernity}}\n\nNotable events during the modern period of [[universal history]] include two [[world war]]s and the [[Cold War]], characterized by the rivalry between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nThe Cold War began in 1947 and lasted until 1991. The [[Space Age]] was concurrent with this time, encompassing the activities related to the [[Space Race]], [[space exploration]], space technology, and the cultural developments influenced by these events. [[Pax Americana]] is an appellation applied to the historical concept of relative liberal peace in the Western world, resulting from the preponderance of power enjoyed by the United States of America after the end of World War II in 1945.\n\nThe post-1945 world experienced the establishment of many new [[State (polity)|states]]. Throughout the post-1945 period, the Cold War was expressed through military coalitions, espionage, weapons development, invasions, propaganda, and competitive technological development. The Soviet Union created the [[Eastern Bloc]] of countries that it occupied, annexing some as [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] and maintaining others as [[satellite state]]s that would later form the [[Warsaw Pact]]. The United States and various Western European countries began a [[Containment]] policy for [[communism]] and forged alliances to this end, including [[NATO]]. The conflict included defense spending, a [[Conventional weapon|conventional]] and [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] [[arms race]], and various [[proxy war]]s; the two superpowers never fought one another directly.\n\nThe post-1989 world saw the end of the totalitarian regimes of the Cold War and the ending of [[client state]] status for many states. The Cold war was effectively ended by the [[Revolutions of 1989]], and the [[Malta Summit]] on 3 December 1989. The [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union was dissolved]] on 26 December 1991. Various \"post-Cold War regimes\" established were democratic republics, though some were [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]]/[[oligarchy|oligarchic]] republics.<ref>Steven Levitsky, Lucan A. Way. Competitive Authoritarianism: Hybrid Regimes After the Cold War. 2010. Pg 3.</ref>\n\nIn Latin America, military regimes supported by the [[CIA]], such as that facilitated by the [[United States intervention in Chile]], also fell (see also [[Covert United States foreign regime change actions]]). The [[Pinochet]] regime collapsed in 1990. In Southeast Asia, the right-wing ''developmental dictatorships''<!-- such as [[Philipine]] (in 1986), [[Indonesia]] (in 1998)--> were overthrown by popular uprisings.<ref>With the [[People Power Revolution]], Corazon Aquino's assumption into power marked the restoration of democracy in the country.</ref>\n\n====Information age and computers====\n[[File:Internet map 1024.jpg|thumb|right|A Visualization of the various routes through a portion of the Internet. Partial map of the Internet based in 2005.]]\nThe [[Information Age]] or Information Era, also commonly known as the Age of the Computer, is an idea that the current age will be characterized by the ability of individuals to transfer information freely, and to have instant access to knowledge that would have been difficult or impossible to find previously. The idea is heavily linked to the concept of a [[Digital Age]] or [[Digital Revolution]], and carries the ramifications of a shift from traditional industry that the Industrial Revolution brought through industrialization, to an economy based around the manipulation of information. The period is generally said to have begun in the latter half of the 20th century, though the particular date varies. The term began its use around the late 1980s and early 1990s, and has been used up to the present with the availability of the Internet.\n\nDuring the late 1990s, both [[Internet directory|Internet directories]] and [[search engine]]s were popular\u2014[[Yahoo!]] and [[Altavista]] (both founded 1995) were the respective industry leaders. By late 2001, the directory model had begun to give way to search engines, tracking the rise of Google (founded 1998), which had developed new approaches to [[relevance (information retrieval)|relevancy ranking]]. Directory features, while still commonly available, became after-thoughts to search engines. Database size, which had been a significant marketing feature through the early 2000s (decade), was similarly displaced by emphasis on relevancy ranking, the methods by which search engines attempt to sort the best results first.\n\n\"[[Web 2.0]]\" is characterized as facilitating communication, [[information sharing]], [[interoperability]], [[User-centered design]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.techpluto.com/web-20-services/|title=Core Characteristics of Web 2.0 Services}}</ref> and [[collaboration]] on the [[World Wide Web]]. It has led to the development and evolution of web-based communities, [[Web service|hosted services]], and [[web application]]s. Examples include [[Social network service|social-networking sites]], [[video sharing|video-sharing sites]], [[wiki]]s, blogs, [[Mashup (digital)|mashup]]s and [[Folksonomy|folksonomies]]. [[Social networking]] emerged in the early 21st century as a popular social communication, largely replacing much of the function of email, [[message board]]s and [[instant messaging]] services. Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube are all major examples of social websites that gained widespread popularity. The information distribution continued into the early 21st century with [[mobile interaction]] and [[Internet access]] growing massively in the early 21st century. By the 2010s, a majority of people in the developed world had Internet access and a majority of people worldwide had a mobile phone.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.mobiletracker.net/archives/2005/05/18/mobile-subcribers-worldwide\n |title=Total mobile subscribers top 1.8&nbsp;billion\n |accessdate=31 December 2008\n |date=18 May 2005\n |work=[[MobileTracker Cell Phone News and Reviews]]\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119070741/http://www.mobiletracker.net/archives/2005/05/18/mobile-subcribers-worldwide\n |archivedate=19 January 2008\n }}\n</ref> Marking the rise of [[mobile computing]], worldwide sales of personal computers fall 14% during the first quarter of 2013. The [[Semantic Web]] (dubbed, \"[[Web 3.0]]\") begins the inclusion of [[semantics|semantic]] content in web pages, converting the current web dominated by unstructured and semi-structured documents into a \"web of data\".\n\nWith the rise of information technology, [[computer security]], and [[information security]] in general, is a concern for computers and networks. Concerns include information and services which are protected from unintended or unauthorized access, change or destruction. This has also raised questions of [[Internet privacy]] and [[personal privacy]] globally.\n\n==== Late contemporary times ====\n\n=====Terrorism and warfare=====\nMajor political developments in the 2000s (decade) for the United States and the Middle East revolved around [[modern terrorism|recent modern terrorism]], the [[War on Terrorism]], the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan War]], and the [[Iraq War]].\n\n[[File:National Park Service 9-11 Statue of Liberty and WTC fire.jpg|thumb|right|The [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] on fire and the [[Statue of Liberty]].]]\nThe [[September 11 attacks]] \u2013 which were described as a \"watershed moment\" of contemporary history \u2013 were a series of coordinated [[suicide attack]]s by [[Al-Qaeda]] upon the United States on 11 September 2001.

The hijackers crashed a third airliner into [[the Pentagon]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], just outside Washington, D.C. The fourth plane crashed into a field near [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania|Shanksville]] in rural [[Somerset County, Pennsylvania]], after some of its passengers and flight crew attempted to retake control of the plane, which the hijackers had redirected toward Washington, D.C. Major terrorist events after the 11 September 2001 Attacks include the [[Moscow Theatre Siege]], the [[2003 Istanbul bombings]], the [[2004 Madrid train bombings|Madrid train bombings]], the [[Beslan school hostage crisis]], the [[July 2005 London bombings|2005 London bombings]], the [[29 October 2005 Delhi bombings|October 2005 New Delhi bombings]], and the [[2008 Mumbai attacks|2008 Mumbai Hotel Siege]].\n\nThe United States responded to the 11 September 2001 attacks by launching a \"Global War on Terrorism\", invading [[Afghanistan]] to depose the [[Taliban]], who had harbored al-Qaeda terrorists, and enacting the [[USA PATRIOT Act|Patriot Act]]. Many other countries also strengthened their anti-terrorism legislation and expanded law enforcement powers. The 'Global War on Terrorism' is the military, political, legal and ideological conflict against [[Islamic terrorism]] and [[Islamic militants]] since the 2001 attacks.\n\n[[File:US Army Afghanistan 2006.jpg|thumb|right|[[U.S. Army]] troops in [[Kunar province]]]]\nThe [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] began in late 2001 and was launched by the United States with the United Kingdom, and [[NATO]]-led, UN authorized [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]] in response to the 11 September attacks. The aim of the invasion was to find the whereabouts of [[Osama bin Laden]] and other high-ranking al-Qaeda members and put them on trial, to destroy the whole organization of [[al-Qaeda]], and to remove the [[Taliban]] regime which supported and gave safe harbor to al-Qaeda. The [[Foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration|Bush administration policy]] and the [[Bush Doctrine]] stated forces would not distinguish between terrorist organizations and nations or governments that harbor them. Two military operations in Afghanistan are fighting for control over the country. [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] (OEF) is a United States combat operation involving some coalition partners and operating primarily in the eastern and southern parts of the country along the [[Pakistan]] border. The second operation is the [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF), which was established by the [[UN Security Council]] at the end of 2001 to secure [[Kabul]] and the surrounding areas. NATO assumed control of ISAF in 2003.\n\nThe multinational infantry actions, with additional ground forces supplied by the [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|Afghan Northern Alliance]], and [[strategic bombing|aerial bombing]] campaign removed the Taliban from power, but Taliban forces have since regained some strength.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/10551/|title=The Taliban Resurgence in Afghanistan|access-date=9 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927101915/http://www.cfr.org/publication/10551/|archive-date=27 September 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> The war has been less successful in achieving the goal of restricting al-Qaeda's movement than anticipated.<ref name=\"rothstein\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=w7fmg1cCjskC&dq=Afghanistan+and+the+troubled+future+of+unconventional+warfare&q=Al+Qaeda|title=Afghanistan: and the troubled future of unconventional warfare By Hy S.

The IS was able to take advantage of social media platforms including Twitter to recruit foreign fighters from around the world and seized significant portions of territory in [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Afghanistan]], and the [[Sinai Peninsula]] of [[Egypt]] from 2013 and ongoing. On the other hand, some violent militant organizations were able to negotiate peace with governments including the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] in the [[Philippines]] in 2014. The presence of IS and the stalemate in the [[Syrian Civil War]] created a [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|migration of refugees to Europe]] and also galvanized and encouraged high-profile terrorism attacks and armed conflicts around the world, such as the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]] and the [[Battle of Marawi]] in the Philippines in 2017.

Concerns intensified early 2010 and thereafter making it difficult or impossible for sovereigns to re-finance their debts. On 9 May 2010, Europe's Finance Ministers approved a rescue package worth \u20ac750&nbsp;billion aimed at ensuring financial stability across Europe. The [[European Financial Stability Facility]] (EFSF) was a special purpose vehicle financed by members of the eurozone to combat the European sovereign debt crisis. In October 2011 eurozone leaders agreed on another package of measures designed to prevent the collapse of member economies. The three most affected countries, Greece, Ireland and Portugal, collectively account for six percent of eurozone's gross domestic product (GDP). In 2012, [[Eurozone]] finance ministers reached an agreement on a second \u20ac130-billion Greek bailout.

The plurality of the term \"futures\" in futurology denotes the rich variety of alternative futures, including the subset of preferable futures (normative futures), that can be studied.\n\nPractitioners of the discipline previously concentrated on [[extrapolation|extrapolating]] present [[technological]], economic or social [[wikt:trend|trend]]s, or on attempting to [[prediction|predict]] future trends, but more recently they have started to examine social [[system]]s and [[uncertainty|uncertainties]] and to build [[scenario planning|scenario]]s, question the worldviews behind such scenarios via the [[causal layered analysis]] method (and others) create preferred visions of the future, and use backcasting to derive alternative implementation strategies. Apart from extrapolation and scenarios, many dozens of methods and techniques are used in futures research.<ref>For the multidisciplinary area of research focused at mathematical modeling of historical dynamics that can be applied to events, see [[Cliodynamics]]</ref>\n\n====Socio-technological trends====\nAt the end of the 20th century, the world was at a major crossroads. Throughout the century, more technological advances had been made than in all of preceding history. Computers, the Internet, and other [[modern technology]] radically altered daily lives. Increased [[globalization]], specifically [[Americanization]], had occurred. While not necessarily a threat, it has sparked anti-Western and [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]] sentiment in parts of the developing world, especially the Middle East. The English language has become a leading [[global language]], with people who did not speak it becoming increasingly disadvantaged.\n\nA trend connecting economic and political events in North America, Asia, and the Middle East is the rapidly increasing demand for fossil fuels, which, along with fewer new petroleum finds, greater extraction costs (see [[peak oil]]), and political turmoil, saw the price of gas and oil soar ~500% between 2000 and 2005. In some places, especially in Europe, gas could be $5 a gallon, depending on the currency. Less influential, but omnipresent, is the debate on Turkey's participation in the [[European Union]]. [[New urbanism]] and urban revival continue to be forces in urban planning in the United States.<ref>[http://www.salon.com/2011/12/31/the_bold_urban_future_starts_now/ The bold urban future starts now \u2013 Dream City \u2013 Salon.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, evidence shows that growth of American suburbs still outpaces urban growth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://trends.truliablog.com/2012/10/even-after-the-housing-bust-americans-still-love-the-suburbs/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=13 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130412015232/http://trends.truliablog.com/2012/10/even-after-the-housing-bust-americans-still-love-the-suburbs/ |archivedate=12 April 2013  }}</ref>\n\n===Challenges and problems===\n[[File:World distributionofwealth GDP and population by region.gif|thumb|right|World [[distribution of wealth]] and population in 2000.]]\nIn the contemporary era, several issues are faced in the world.\n\nFirst of all, wealth is concentrated among the [[G8]] and Western [[industrialized nations]], along with several Asian nations and [[OPEC]] countries.

The changes of climate over the past century, have been [[attribution of recent climate change|attributed to various factors]] which have resulted in a [[global warming]]. This warming is the increase in the [[Instrumental temperature record|average temperature]] of the Earth's near-surface air and oceans since the mid-20th century and its projected continuation. Some effects on both the [[natural environment]] and [[civilization|human life]] are, at least in part, already being attributed to global warming. A 2001 report by the IPCC suggests that [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|glacier retreat]], [[Ice shelf#Ice shelf disruption|ice shelf disruption]] such as that of the [[Larsen Ice Shelf]], [[sea level rise]], changes in rainfall patterns, and increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events are attributable in part to global warming.<ref name=\"tar_wg2\">{{Cite web|title=Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.

[[Emerging technologies]] cover various cutting-edge developments in the emergence and convergence of technology, including transportation, information technology, [[biotechnology]], [[robotics]] and [[applied mechanics]], and [[material science]]. Their status and possible effects involve controversy over the degree of social impact or the viability of the technologies. Though, these represent new and significant developments within a field; converging technologies represent previously distinct fields which are in some way moving towards stronger inter-connection and similar goals.\n\nThe first fully functional [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] was Columbia (designated OV-102), launched into Earth orbit in April 1981. In 1996, Shuttle mission [[STS-75]] conducted research in space with the [[electrodynamic tether]] generator and other tether configurations. In 135 missions, the program suffered with two shuttles destroyed.<ref>For more, see [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]].</ref> The successful landing at Kennedy Space Center after completing STS-135 concluded the shuttle program.  The [[Commercial Orbital Transportation Services]] (COTS) program began in 2006. The [[Space Shuttle retirement|retirement of NASA's Space Shuttle fleet]] took place from March to July 2011.\n\nThere are [[list of spaceports|various spaceports]], including [[spaceport]]s of [[human spaceflight]] and other [[launch system]]s ([[space logistics]]). [[Private spaceflight]] is flight beyond the [[K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line]]<ref>This is above the nominal [[edge of space]] at 100 km (62 mi) Earth's altitude. See also: [[Turbopause]]; [[Low Earth orbit|Low]], [[Medium Earth orbit|Medium]], and [[High Earth orbit]].</ref> that is conducted and paid for by an entity other than a government agency. [[Commercialization of space]] is the use of equipment sent into or through outer space to provide goods or services of commercial value, either by a corporation or state. [[Space trade]] plans and predictions began in the 1960s. [[Spacecraft propulsion]]<ref>There are many different methods, in conventional and unconventional propulsion systems. Each method has drawbacks and advantages, and spacecraft propulsion is an active area of research. However, most spacecraft today are propelled by forcing a gas from the back/rear of the vehicle at very high speed through a [[rocket engine nozzle|supersonic de Laval nozzle]]. This sort of engine is called a [[rocket engine]].</ref> is any [[propulsion|method used to accelerate]] [[spacecraft]] and artificial [[satellite]]s.\n\nNASA announced in 2011 that its [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] captured photographic evidence of possible liquid water on Mars during warm seasons. On 6 August 2012, the Mars Science Laboratory [[Curiosity (rover)|Curiosity]], the most elaborate Martian exploration vehicle to date, landed on Mars. After the [[WMAP]] observations of the [[cosmic microwave background]], information was released in 2011 of the work done by the [[Planck Surveyor]], estimating the age of the Universe to 13.8&nbsp;billion years old (a 100 million years older than previously thought).

It first appeared on 18 February 1967, and with its 52nd issue on 10 February 1968 it merged with its sister title ''[[Terrific (comic)|Terrific]]''. The 89th and final issue of ''Fantastic'' appeared on 7 September 1968, after which it was merged into ''[[Smash! (comics)|Smash!]]''.\n\n''Fantastic'' was different from the earlier Power Comics such as ''Smash!'' and ''[[Pow! (comic)|Pow!]]'', which were essentially traditional ''[[The Beano|Beano]]''-style British comic papers supplemented by a small amount of material reprinted from [[Marvel Comics]]. In contrast, ''Fantastic'' (and later ''Terrific'' as well) were more American in appearance, resembling the black-and-white comic anthologies of the time such as ''[[Creepy (magazine)|Creepy]]'' and ''[[Eerie]]''. However, they were aimed at a younger audience than such magazines (although an older audience than the ''Beano''-style British fare).\n\n==The Launch of ''Fantastic''==\n\nFollowing the successes of ''[[Wham! (comic)|Wham!]]'' (1964) and ''[[Smash! (comics)|Smash!]]'' (1966) Odhams were keen to expand their line of weekly ''Power Comics'' in 1967. In January they launched ''[[Pow! (comic)|Pow!]]'' with 'Spider-Man' as the lead strip, and a month later saw the arrival of a comic that consisted almost entirely of Marvel reprints: ''Fantastic''.\n\n''Fantastic'' No.1, which launched on Saturday February 11, 1967, came with a pennant flag with interchangeable inserts of various superheroes. This the first of several free gifts given away with each issue, as was traditional on the launch of a new comic. ''Fantastic'' had a different format to its three predecessors, being slightly smaller in size and on better paper, it featured 40 pages and a higher cover price (9d, compared to Smash's 7d for 28 pages). This made it three times more expensive than the 3d cover price of D C Thomson's perennials ''Beano'' and ''Dandy''. It could not sustain a profit in the increasingly crowded market of 1960s comics, but it did gain a faithful following, and served as an introduction to many of Marvel's superhero characters.\n\n==Marvel Superheroes==\n\nTo match its more American appearance, the contents of ''Fantastic'' were also predominantly American, starting in the first issue with reprints of Marvel's ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|The Mighty Thor]]'' and the ''[[X-Men]]'', as well as [[Iron Man]] stories from ''[[Tales of Suspense]]''. The only original content featured a British [[superhero]] called Johnny Future, who started out as a prehistoric \"[[Transitional fossil#Missing_links|Missing Link]]\" (who was, in appearance, very much a Hulk-lookalike), before evolving (literally) into a superman of the future. The Johnny Future stories were drawn by [[Luis Bermejo]].\n\nThis line-up continued until issue 51, when ''Fantastic'' absorbed ''[[Terrific (comic)|Terrific]]'': becoming ''Fantastic and Terrific'', but continuing the sequential numbering from ''Fantastic''. The ''Thor'' and ''X-Men'' features continued until the end of the comic's run (when ''Thor'' then continued in ''Smash!''), but ''Iron Man'' and Johnny Future were replaced by reprints of ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[Doctor Strange]]'', both continuing from ''Terrific''.\n\nA distinctive feature of ''Fantastic'' was the full-colour pin-up that appeared on the back cover of most issues. Many of these were reprinted from American Marvel comics, but at least some (including a Johnny Future pin-up) were produced by a young [[Barry Windsor-Smith]].\n\nAll the Marvel strips inside ''Fantastic'' were printed in black-and-white, with colour used only for the front and back covers. The first issue commenced with Thor's origin story from ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #83 ('The Stone Men from Saturn'), plus the first X-Men story (the arrival of Miss Jean Grey) from the original ''[[X-Men]]'' #1, and the origin of Iron Man ('Iron Man is Born') from ''[[Tales of Suspense]]''.\n\n==Merger with ''Terrific'' and closure==\n[[Image:FantasticSummerSpecial 1968 FantasticAd.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Advertisement for '''Fantastic''' in the 1968 ''Fantastic Summer Special'']]\n\nIssue 52 of ''Fantastic'' saw the comic re-launched, in effect, as it absorbed companion paper ''[[Terrific (comics)|Terrific]]'' to form ''Fantastic and Terrific'', featuring Thor and the X-Men (from ''Fantastic''), plus the Avengers and Doctor Strange (from ''Terrific'').\n\nThat issue again saw the first of several free gifts given away with each issue. The cover numbering was continued from ''Fantastic''.\n\nThe merger of the two titles bought ''Fantastic'' another nine months of life, but ultimately this was not enough to save it. Issue 89, published in September 1968, was the final issue. The Thor strip was thereafter transferred to ''Smash'', and the others were discontinued.\n\n==References==\n* [http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/m/marvuk.htm History of Marvel UK]\n* [http://www.26pigs.com/fantastic/index.html The Power Comics: Fantastic]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://bp3.blogger.com/_448y6kVhntg/Rc9Kk14r9fI/AAAAAAAAAi8/GySjnYBVEUQ/s1600-h/fantastic1.jpg ''Fantastic'' #1 cover art]\n* [http://bp3.blogger.com/_448y6kVhntg/Rc9Hd14r9ZI/AAAAAAAAAhw/-hKnTqbrqTw/s1600-h/ironman_comparison.jpg ''Fantastic'' #19 cover art]\n* [http://bp0.blogger.com/_448y6kVhntg/Rc9HeF4r9cI/AAAAAAAAAiI/mRQwMlL9Z50/s1600-h/alf.jpg ''Fantastic'' editorial page] from 18th March 1967\n* [http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/j/jonfutur.htm A page about Johnny Future]\n* [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2007/02/40-year-flashback-fantastic-is-launched.html 40 year flashback - ''Fantastic'' is launched]\n* [http://clitheroekid.ihostfull.com/links2.htm#comics 1960s British Comics review]\n* [https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2015/03/30/fantastic/ British Comics at Wordpress.com site]\n\n\n\n[[Category:Fleetway and IPC Comics titles]]\n[[Category:British comics magazines]]\n[[Category:Defunct British comics]]\n[[Category:1967 comics debuts]]\n[[Category:1968 comics endings]]\n[[Category:Magazines established in 1967]]\n[[Category:Magazines disestablished in 1968]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the UK comic|the American comic|Fantastic Comics}}\n[[Image:FantasticSummerSpecial 1968 FrontCover.jpg|right|thumb|300px|''Fantastic Summer Special'' 1968]]\n\n'''''Fantastic''''' was a weekly [[British comic]] book magazine published by [[Odhams Press]] under the [[Power Comics]] imprint.
