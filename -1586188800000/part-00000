In 1993, aluminium-bronze 50-ruble coins and cupro-nickel-zinc 100-ruble coins were issued, and the material of 10- and 20-ruble coins was changed to nickel-plated steel.

Denominations of 10 almost always have a red tinge, and are called \"chervonets\" ({{lang-ru|\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446}}), which comes from the old Russian word \"chervony\" ({{lang-ru|\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043d\u044b\u0439}}) meaning \"red\". In the Russian Empire, the high-grade gold from which the coins were made was called \"red gold\". Then the corresponding denominations worth 10 rubles began to be issued with a red tinge that were subject to exchange for gold. In the USSR (which included almost all the regions of the former Russian Empire) in the early 1920s, banknotes of one chervonets were also issued, which were provided with gold.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{numis cite SCWC |date = 1991 }}\n* {{numis cite SCWPM |date = 1994 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Russian ruble}}\n* [http://www.goznak.ru/en/ Goznak official site] {{in lang|en|ru}}\n* [http://banknoter.com/s/russia Russian Ruble (Catalog of banknotes)] {{in lang|en|ru}}\n* [http://www.cbr.ru/eng/currency_base/daily/ Foreign Currency Market | Bank of Russia] {{in lang|en|ru}}\n* [http://www.tititudorancea.com/z/euro_to_rub_exchange_rates_russian_ruble.htm Russian Currency Exchange Rate History]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100515011419/http://www.tx.am/world-currency-exchange-rates/russian-ruble-exchange-rates-rub/ Historical Russian Ruble eXchange Rates: RUB]\n* [http://russianmoney.info/ History of the Russian paper money]\n* [http://colnect.com/en/banknotes/list/country/4146 Images of historic and modern Russian bank notes]\n* {{CISCoins|Russia}} {{in lang|en|es|ru}}\n* [http://www.bis-ans-ende-der-welt.net/Russland-B-En.htm Historical and current banknotes of Russia] [http://www.bis-ans-ende-der-welt.net/UdSSR-B-En.htm including banknotes of the Soviet Union] {{in lang|en|de|fr}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{Russia topics}}\n{{Economy of Russia}}\n{{Currencies of post-Soviet states}}\n{{Currencies of Europe}}\n{{Currencies of Asia}}\n{{Ruble}}\n{{Portal bar|Money|Numismatics|Russia}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Economy of Russia]]\n[[Category:Economic history of Russia]]\n[[Category:Currencies of Russia]]\n[[Category:Currencies of Ukraine]]\n", "text_old": "{{use dmy dates|date=May 2011}}\n{{Refimprove|date=January 2020}}\n\n{{Infobox currency\n| currency_name_in_local = {{native name|ru|\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0443\u0431\u043b\u044c|italics=off}}{{NoteTag|{{lang-ab|\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0430\u04ad}} ''amaat''; {{lang-ba|\u04bb\u0443\u043c}} ''hum''; {{lang-cv|\u0442\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0115}} ''tenke''; {{lang-kv|\u0448\u0430\u0439\u0442}} ''shayt''; [[Lak language|Lak]]: \u043a\u044a\u0443\u0440\u0443\u0448 ''k'urush''; [[Mari language|Mari]]: \u0442\u0435\u04a5\u0433\u0435 ''tenge''; {{lang-os|\u0441\u043e\u043c}} ''som''; {{lang-tt|\u0441\u0443\u043c}} ''sum''; {{lang-udm|\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442}} ''manet''; {{lang-sah|\u0441\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0443\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0439}} ''solkuobay''}}\n|image_1 =  [[File:2000 rubles 2017 obverse.jpg|140px]]<br />\n[[File:200 rubles 2017 reverse.jpg|140px]]\n|image_title_1 = 2,000 \u20bd and 200 \u20bd banknotes (2017)\n|image_2 = [[File:Rouble coins.png|120px]]\n|image_title_2 = Coins\n| iso_code = RUB\n| iso_number = 643\n| iso_exponent = 2\n| using_countries = {{Flag|Russia}}\n|unofficial_users = {{collapsible list|titlestyle = font-weight:normal; background:transparent; text-align:left;\n|title = {{small|'''Partially recognized<br />republics'''}}|''{{Flag|Abkhazia}}''|''{{Flag|South Ossetia}}''}}\n{{collapsible list |titlestyle = font-weight:normal; background:transparent; text-align:left;\n|title = {{small|'''Unrecognized republics'''}}|''{{Flag|Donetsk People's Republic}}''|''{{Flag|Luhansk People's Republic}}''|{{NoteTag|Donetsk and Luhansk are recognized by the partially recognized [[South Ossetia]], though lack recognition from member states of the United Nations, including Russia.

[[Crude oil]], a major [[export]] of Russia, declined in price by nearly 50% between its yearly high in June 2014 and 16 December 2014.

Denominations of 10 almost always have a red tinge, and are called \"chervonets\" ({{lang-ru|\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446}}), which comes from the old Russian word \"chervony\" ({{lang-ru|\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043d\u044b\u0439}}) meaning \"red\". In the Russian Empire, the high-grade gold from which the coins were made was called \"red gold\". Then the corresponding denominations worth 10 rubles began to be issued with a red tinge that were subject to exchange for gold. In the USSR (which included almost all the regions of the former Russian Empire) in the early 1920s, banknotes of one chervonets were also issued, which were provided with gold.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{numis cite SCWC |date = 1991 }}\n* {{numis cite SCWPM |date = 1994 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Russian ruble}}\n* [http://www.goznak.ru/en/ Goznak official site] {{in lang|en|ru}}\n* [http://banknoter.com/s/russia Russian Ruble (Catalog of banknotes)] {{in lang|en|ru}}\n* [http://www.cbr.ru/eng/currency_base/daily/ Foreign Currency Market | Bank of Russia] {{in lang|en|ru}}\n* [http://www.tititudorancea.com/z/euro_to_rub_exchange_rates_russian_ruble.htm Russian Currency Exchange Rate History]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100515011419/http://www.tx.am/world-currency-exchange-rates/russian-ruble-exchange-rates-rub/ Historical Russian Ruble eXchange Rates: RUB]\n* [http://russianmoney.info/ History of the Russian paper money]\n* [http://colnect.com/en/banknotes/list/country/4146 Images of historic and modern Russian bank notes]\n* {{CISCoins|Russia}} {{in lang|en|es|ru}}\n* [http://www.bis-ans-ende-der-welt.net/Russland-B-En.htm Historical and current banknotes of Russia] [http://www.bis-ans-ende-der-welt.net/UdSSR-B-En.htm including banknotes of the Soviet Union] {{in lang|en|de|fr}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{Russia topics}}\n{{Economy of Russia}}\n{{Currencies of post-Soviet states}}\n{{Currencies of Europe}}\n{{Currencies of Asia}}\n{{Ruble}}\n{{Portal bar|Money|Numismatics|Russia}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Economy of Russia]]\n[[Category:Economic history of Russia]]\n[[Category:Currencies of Russia]]\n[[Category:Currencies of Ukraine]]\n", "name_user": "Orenburg1", "label": "safe", "comment": "sp", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_ruble"}

[[Ireland]] is an island to the north-west of [[continental Europe]]. Politically, Ireland is divided between the [[Republic of Ireland]], which covers just under five-sixths of the island, and [[Northern Ireland]], a part of the [[United Kingdom]], which covers the remainder and is located in the north-east of the island. [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] is the largest religious denomination, representing over 73% for the island and about 87% of the Republic of Ireland.\n\n==Introduction of Christianity==\nThe introduction of [[Christianity in Ireland|Christianity to Ireland]] dates to sometime before the 5th century, presumably in interactions with Roman Britain. Christian worship had reached pagan Ireland around 400 AD. It is often misstated that [[St. Patrick]] brought the faith to Ireland, but it was already present on the island before Patrick arrived. Monasteries were built for monks who wanted permanent communion with God. The lengths they went to for tranquility are evident from the monastery of [[Skellig Michael]]. Via [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|Aidan]], Christianity spread among the [[Picts]] and [[Northumbrians]].\n\nScholars have long considered the term \"[[Celtic Church]]\" to be inappropriate for describing Christianity among [[Celtic languages|Celtic-speaking]] peoples, since this would imply a notion of unity, or a self-identifying entity, that did not exist.<ref>D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn, ''Early Medieval Ireland 400\u20131200'' (London, 1995); T.

Stephen Baxter (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2006), pp. 207\u2013208, 220 n. 3</ref> Some scholars have chosen to apply the term \"[[Insular Christianity]]\" to this Christian practice that arose around the [[Irish Sea]].\n\n==Palladius and Patrick==\nAccording to [[Prosper of Aquitaine]], [[Palladius (bishop of Ireland)|Palladius]] was from a noble family in [[Gaul]]. In 429, he was serving as a deacon in Rome. The Pope commissioned him to send [[Germanus of Auxerre|Germanus]], Bishop of Auxerre, to investigate rumors of [[Pelagianism]] in Britain. In 431, [[Pope Celestine I]] consecrated Palladius a bishop and sent him to minister to the \"Scots believing in Christ\".<ref name=cusack>{{Cite web|url=https://www.libraryireland.com/HistoryIreland/Mission-St-Palladius.php|title=Mission of St. Palladius - Illustrated History of Ireland|website=www.libraryireland.com}}</ref> His mission mainly seems to have been to Irish Christians in the east midlands, Leinster, and perhaps east Munster. It is uncertain if he converted any Irish. What little is known of his mission appears to have been successful, though it was later downplayed by partisans of Patrick.\n\nSaint Patrick's dates are uncertain. All that can be said is that he was alive sometime in the fifth century, and was a missionary bishop rather than ministering to Christians. His areas appear to have been Ulster and north Connacht, but very little can be said with certainty about him. Later tradition from the seventh-century onwards is known to be unreliable.{{cn|date=June 2017}}\n\n==Native ministry==\n\nMonastic establishments arose in the sixth century, such as [[Clonard Abbey|Clonard]], founded by [[Finnian of Clonard|St. Finian]], [[Clonfert]] by [[St. Brendan]], [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]] by [[St. Comgall]], [[Clonmacnoise]] by [[Ciar\u00e1n of Clonmacnoise|St. Kieran]], [[Killeaney]] by [[St. Enda of Aran|St. Enda]]; and, in the seventh century, [[Lismore, County Waterford|Lismore]] by [[St. Carthage]] and [[Glendalough]] by [[St Kevin|St. Kevin]].\n\nIn 563, [[St. Columba]], a native of Donegal, accompanied by a few companions, crossed the sea to [[Caledonia]] and founded a monastery on the desolate island of [[Iona]].\n\n==Irish monasteries==\n{{expand section|date=October 2018}}\nFresh arrivals came from Ireland; the monastery with Columba as its abbot was soon a flourishing institution, from which the [[Dal Riada|Dalriadian]] Scots in the south and the Picts beyond the Grampians were evangelized. When Columba died in 597, Christianity had been preached and received in every district in Caledonia, and in every island along its west coast. In the next century Iona had so prospered that its abbot, [[St. Adamnan]], wrote in excellent Latin the \"Life of St. Columba\". From Iona had gone south the Irish Aidan and his Irish companions to evangelize Northumbria, Mercia, and Essex.\n\n==Missionaries abroad==\n[[Image:KellsFol292rIncipJohn.jpg|thumb|A page from the ''[[Book of Kells]]'' that opens the [[Gospel of John]]]]\n\n[[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Missionaries from Ireland]] to [[England]] and [[Continental Europe]] spread news of the flowering of learning, and scholars from other nations came to Irish monasteries. The excellence and isolation of these monasteries helped preserve Latin learning during the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The period of [[Insular art]], mainly in the fields of [[illuminated manuscript]]s, metalworking, and sculpture flourished and produced such treasures as the [[Book of Kells]], the [[Ardagh Chalice]], and the many carved [[high cross|stone crosses]] that dot the island.\n\nThese monasteries served as sanctuary to many of the continents great scholars and theologians. It was here that the lamp of Latin learning was preserved for the ages. During this age, the great illuminated manuscripts of Ireland were produced. Arguably the finest such work is ''[[The Book of Kells]]'' which may still be viewed at [[Trinity College, Dublin]].\n\nThe first significant renewal of learning in the West came with the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] of the [[Early Middle Ages]]. [[Charlemagne]], advised by [[Peter of Pisa]] and [[Alcuin of York]], attracted the scholars of England and Ireland, and by decree in AD 787 established schools in every abbey in his empire.  These schools, from which the name ''scholasticism'' is derived, became centres of medieval learning.  During the early [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] period, knowledge (hi) of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek language]] had vanished in the west except in Ireland, where it was widely dispersed in the monastic schools.<ref>MacManus, p 215</ref>\n\nIrish scholars had a considerable presence in the [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish court]], where they were renowned for their learning.<ref name=\"StanfordEriugena\">{{Cite web|title=John Scottus Eriugena |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scottus-eriugena/ |work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |date=2004-10-17 |accessdate=2008-07-21 }}</ref> Among them was [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]], one of the founders of scholasticism.<ref name=\"Gothic\">Toman, p 10: \"[[Peter Abelard|Abelard]] himself was\u2026 together with John Scotus Erigena (9th century), and [[Lanfranc]] and [[Anselm of Canterbury]] (both 11th century), one of the founders of scholasticism.\"</ref> Eriugena was the most significant Irish intellectual of the early monastic period, and an outstanding philosopher in terms of originality.<ref name=\"StanfordEriugena\"/> He had considerable familiarity with the Greek language, and translated many works into Latin, affording access to the [[Cappadocian Fathers]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|Greek theological tradition]].<ref name=\"StanfordEriugena\"/>\n\n==Arrival of the Vikings==\n{{cleanup|section|date=March 2010}}\nDuring the ninth and tenth centuries, waves of Norse warriors ransacked the countryside. The monasteries were favourite targets for their treasures of golden religious ornaments.\n\nAs the eighth century neared its close, religion and learning still flourished, but unexpected dangers approached and a new enemy came, before whose assaults monk and monastery and saint and scholar disappeared. These invaders were the Danes from the coasts of Scandinavia. Pagans and pirates, they were formidable foes both on land and sea.\n\nIn Ireland as elsewhere they attacked the monasteries and churches, desecrated the altars, carried away the gold and silver vessels, and smoking ruins and murdered monks attested the fury of their assaults. Under native and Christian chiefs churches were destroyed, church lands appropriated by laymen, monastic schools deserted, and lay abbots ruled at Armagh and elsewhere. Bishops were consecrated without sees and conferred orders for money, there was chaos in church government and corruption everywhere.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nIn a series of synods beginning with [[Synod of R\u00e1th Breasail|R\u00e1th Breasail]] (1118) and including [[Synod of Kells|Kells]] (1152), at which the [[Papal legate|pope's legate]] presided, many salutary enactments were passed, and for the first time [[Diocesan bishop|diocesan episcopacy]] was established. Meanwhile, [[St. Malachy]], Archbishop of Armagh, had done very remarkable work in his own diocese and elsewhere. His early death in 1148 was a heavy blow to the cause of church reform. Nor could so many evils be cured in a single life, or by the labours of a single man; and in spite of his efforts and the efforts of others the decrees of synods were often flouted, and the new diocesan boundaries ignored.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==Anglo-Normans==\nIn December 1154, Henry Plantagenet, Duke of Normandy and Aquitaine, by the [[Treaty of Wallingford]] and a large fleet, became in addition [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], King of England. In that same month an Englishman, [[Nicholas Breakspeare]], was elected [[Pope Adrian IV]]. Henry intended, as shown by his later [[Constitutions of Clarendon]], to establish the supremacy of the civil law and courts above the [[ecclesiastical]] law and courts. In the first full year of Henry's reign (1155) he procured the Papal Bull [[Laudabiliter]] from the Hertfordshire born [[Pope Adrian IV]] authorizing Henry to proceed to conquer Ireland \"to check the torrent of wickedness to reform evil manners, to sow the seeds of virtue\". The quid pro quo was the condition that a penny should be yearly paid from each house to the See of Rome (the still extant Peter's Pence). Henry and the Pope also had other reasons (see [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], section \"Lordship over Ireland\"). The invasion was put aside while Henry attended to other matters. Henry continued to battle the supreme power of the Church, and [[Thomas Becket]] in England. In 1166, Henry took the opportunity to accede to the request by displaced Irish [[R\u00ed]] of Leinster, [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]] for assistance in regaining his Irish territory. A first contingent of the [[Norman Invasion of Ireland]] came to Ireland in 1169 under [[Maurice FitzGerald, Lord of Lanstephan|Maurice Fitzgerald]], followed by a stronger force under Strongbow ([[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]]) in 1170, the year Thomas \u00e0 Beckett was murdered. In 1171 Henry himself landed at Waterford and proceeded to Dublin, where he spent the winter, and received the submission of most of the Irish chiefs. This submission was outlined in the [[Treaty of Windsor 1175]].\n\n==Reformation and beyond==\nIt was not until the end of the 17th centuries that the Crown of England gained full control of Ireland by means of [[History of Ireland (1536\u20131691)|a series of military campaigns]] in the period 1534\u20131691.  During this period, the island was progressively [[Plantations of Ireland|colonised]] by English and Scottish Protestant settlers.  Most of the Irish remained Roman Catholic.\n\n===Henry VIII===\n[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] decided to destroy the power of the Anglo-Norman kings and take control of Ireland. As he did so, he put English lords in charge of confiscated land and plundered the Catholic monasteries and churches, as he had done in England. In 1536 during the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], Henry arranged to be declared head of the Church in Ireland through an act of the Irish Parliament. When the [[Church of England]] was reformed under [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], so too was the Church of Ireland.\n\nIn the beginning of his reign, Henry VIII was preoccupied with more pressing matters in England and on the European Continent, and therefore paid little attention to Ireland.  It was not until he had reigned for a quarter of a century on the throne that he turned his attention to Ireland and then it was primarily due his conflict with the Church over his marriage to Catherine of Aragon.  Then Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy, which invested Henry with spiritual jurisdiction over England and proclaimed him head of the Church of England rather than the Pope.  When the proctors of the clergy refused to agree to this measure, the irate monarch deprived them of the right of voting, confiscated church lands and suppressed monasteries, in some cases shedding the blood of their inmates, in the remaining cases evicting them and making them homeless and poor.\n\n===Elizabeth I===\nFearing Ireland's Catholicism and strategic value for her enemies, Elizabeth consolidated English power in Ireland.\n\nThe [[established church]] in Ireland underwent a period of more radical [[Calvinist]] doctrine than occurred in England. [[James Ussher]] (later [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Armagh]]) authored the [[Irish Articles]], adopted in 1615. In 1634, the [[Irish Convocation]] adopted the English [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] alongside the Irish Articles.  After the Restoration of 1660, it seems that the Thirty-Nine Articles took precedence; they remain the official doctrine of the Church of Ireland even after disestablishment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds1.ix.vi.x.html|title=Creeds of Christendom, with a History and Critical notes.

The History of Creeds. - Christian Classics Ethereal Library|website=www.ccel.org}}</ref>\n\nThe English-speaking minority mostly adhered to the Church of Ireland or to Presbyterianism, while the Irish-speaking majority remained faithful to the Latin liturgy of Roman Catholicism. From this period on, sectarian conflict became a recurrent theme in Irish history.\n\n===Translation of the Bible into Irish===\nThe first Irish translation of the New Testament was begun by [[Nicholas Walsh (Bishop of Ossory)|Nicholas Walsh]], [[Bishop of Ossory]], who worked on it until he was murdered in 1585. The work was continued by John Kearny, his assistant, and [[Nehemiah Donellan]], [[Church of Ireland Archdiocese of Tuam|Archbishop of Tuam]]; it was finally completed by [[William O'Domhnuill]] (William Daniell, Archbishop of Tuam in succession to Donellan). Their work was printed in 1602. The work of translating the Old Testament was undertaken by [[William Bedel]] (1571\u20131642), [[Bishop of Kilmore (Church of Ireland)|Bishop of Kilmore]], who completed his translation within the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], although it was not published until 1680 in a revised version by [[Narcissus Marsh]] (1638\u20131713), Archbishop of Dublin. William Bedell had undertaken a translation of the [[Book of Common Prayer]] in 1606. An Irish translation of the revised prayer book of 1662 was effected by John Richardson (1664\u20131747) and published in 1712.\n\nThe first translation of the entire Bible that was approved by the church was ''An B\u00edobla Naofa'', supervised by [[P\u00e1draig \u00d3 Fiannachta]] at [[Maynooth]] and published in 1981.\n\n==Persecution and Penal Laws==\n\nThe [[Irish Confederate Wars]] resulted in much destruction of church property. Irish Catholics were severely persecuted under [[Oliver Cromwell]], their situation only slightly improving under the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] kings. The land settlements in the aftermath of these wars, and the defeat of James II in 1691, reduced Irish Catholic freeholders to a fraction of their previous size. The introduction of the [[Penal Laws]] further proscribed the practise of Roman Catholicism, with many priests and bishops forced into hiding or exile. Not until the 1770s did the religious climate relax, somewhat.\n\n==Protestant ascendancy (1691\u20131801)==\n{{Main article|Ireland 1691\u20131801}}\n\nBefore the Stuart accession, Ireland was divided into thirty-four [[borough]]s. In 1613, forty new boroughs were created, all of them dominated by Protestants.  The consequence of this was the reduction of the Catholic majority in the Irish parliament to a minority.  By the end of the seventeenth century all Catholics, representing some 85% of Ireland's population then, were banned from the Irish parliament. As a result, political power rested entirely in the hands of a British settler-colonial, and more specifically [[Anglican]], minority while the [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] population suffered severe [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|political and economic privations]].\n\nBy the late 18th century, many of the [[Anglo-Irish]] [[ruling class]] had come to see Ireland as their native country. A Parliamentary faction led by [[Henry Grattan]] agitated for a more favourable trading relationship with England and for greater legislative independence for the [[Parliament of Ireland]]. However, reform in Ireland stalled over the more radical proposals to [[Catholic Emancipation|enfranchise Irish Catholics]]. This was enabled in 1793, but Catholics could not yet enter parliament or become government officials.\n\n===Oath of Allegiance===\nBy the [[Treaty of Limerick]] the Catholic soldiers of King James were pardoned, protected against forfeiture of their estates, and were free to go abroad if they chose. All Catholics might substitute an oath of allegiance for the oath of supremacy, and were to have such privileges \"as were consistent with the laws of Ireland, or as they did enjoy in the reign of Charles II\". King William also promised to have the Irish Parliament grant a further relaxation of the penal laws in force. This treaty, however, was soon torn to shreds, and in spite of William's appeals the Irish Parliament refused to ratify it, and embarked on fresh penal legislation. Under these new laws Catholics were excluded from Parliament, from the bench and bar, from the army and navy, from all civil offices, from the corporations, and even from the corporate towns. They could not have Catholic schools at home or attend foreign schools, or inherit landed property, or hold land under lease, or act as executors or administrators, or have arms or ammunition, or a horse worth \u00a35. Neither could they bury their dead in Catholic ruins, or make pilgrimages to holy wells, or observe Catholic holidays. They could not intermarry with the Protestants, the clergyman assisting at such marriages being liable to death. The wife of a Catholic landlord turning Protestant got separate maintenance; the son turning Protestant got the whole estate; and the Catholic landlord having only Catholic children was obliged at death to divide his estate among his children in equal shares. All the [[regular clergy]], as well as bishops and vicars-general should quit the kingdom. The [[secular clergy]] might remain, but must be registered, nor could they have on their churches either steeple or bell.\n\nIn 1728, the Catholics outnumbered Protestants 5 to 1. A few Catholics managed to hold their estates with the collaboration of friendly Protestants; the remainder gradually sank to the level of [[Cotter (farmer)|cottiers]] and day-labourers, reduced to a standard of living far below what they had been used to. Many Catholics chose to emigrate in the hopes of finding a more congenial environment.\n\n===Irish Parliament and the Passing of Tolerance===\nIn the Irish Parliament meanwhile a spirit of independence appeared. As the Parliament of the Pale it had been so often used for factious purposes that in 1496 [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|Poynings' Law]] was passed, providing that henceforth no Irish Parliament could meet, and no law could be proposed, without the previous consent of both the [[Irish Privy Council|Irish]] and [[Privy Council of England|English Privy Council]]s. Further, the English Parliament claimed the right to legislate for Ireland; and in the laws prohibiting the importation of Irish cattle (1665), and Irish woollen manufactures (1698), and that dealing with the Irish forfeited estates (1700), it asserted its supposed right.\n\nWhen one member, Molyneux, protested, the English Parliament condemned him, and ordered his book to be burned by the common hangman. Moreover, it passed [[Dependency of Ireland on Great Britain Act 1719|an Act in 1719]] expressly declaring that it had power to legislate for Ireland, taking away also the appellate jurisdiction of the [[Irish House of Lords]]. The fight made by Swift against Wood's halfpence showed that, though Molyneux was dead, his spirit lived; Lucas continued the fight, and [[Henry Grattan|Grattan]] in [[Repeal of Act for Securing Dependence of Ireland Act 1782|1782 obtained legislative independence]].\n\nIn 1778 by an Act enabling Catholics to hold all lands under lease; and in 1782 by a further Act allowing them to erect Catholic schools, with the permission of the Protestant bishop of the diocese, to own a horse worth more than \u00a35, and to assist at Mass without being compelled to accuse the officiating priest. Nor were Catholic bishops any longer compelled to quit the kingdom, nor Catholic children specially rewarded if they turned Protestant. Not for ten years was there any further concession, and then an Act was passed allowing Catholics to erect schools without seeking Protestant permission, admitting Catholics to the Bar, and legalizing marriages between Protestants and Catholics. Much more important was the Act of 1793 giving the Catholics the Parliamentary and municipal franchise, admitting them to the universities and to military and civil offices, and removing all restrictions in regard to the tenure of land. They were still excluded from Parliament, from the inner Bar, and from a few of the higher civil and military offices.\n\nAlways in favour of religious liberty, Grattan would have swept away every vestige of the Penal code. But, in 1782, he mistakenly thought that his work was done when legislative independence was conceded. He forgot that the executive was still left independent of Parliament, answerable only to the English ministry; and that, with rotten boroughs controlled by a few great families, with an extremely limited franchise in the counties, and with pensioners and [[Wikt:placeman|placemen]] filling so many seats, the Irish Parliament was but a mockery of representation.\n\nLike Grattan, [[Henry Flood|Flood]] and Charlemont favoured Parliamentary reform, but, unlike him, they were opposed to Catholic concessions. As for Foster and Fitzgibbon, who led the forces of corruption and bigotry, they opposed every attempt at reform, and consented to the Act of 1793 only under strong pressure from [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] and [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville|Dundas]]. These English ministers, alarmed at the progress of [[French revolution]]ary principles in Ireland, fearing a foreign invasion, wished to have the Catholics contented. In 1795 further concessions seemed imminent. In that year an illiberal [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|viceroy]], [[John Fane, 10th Earl of Westmorland|Lord Westmoreland]], was replaced by the liberal-minded [[William Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam|Lord Fitzwilliam]], who came understanding it to be the wish of Pitt that the Catholic claims were to be conceded. He at once dismissed from office a rapacious office-holder named [[John Beresford (statesman)|Beresford]], so powerful that he was called the \"King of Ireland\"; he refused to consult [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland|Lord Chancellor]] [[John FitzGibbon, 1st Earl of Clare|Fitzgibbon]] or [[John Foster, 1st Baron Oriel|Foster]], the Speaker; he took Grattan and [[William Ponsonby, 1st Baron Ponsonby|Ponsonby]] into his confidence, and declared his intention to support Grattan's bill admitting Catholics to Parliament. The high hopes raised by these events were dashed to the earth when Fitzwilliam was suddenly recalled, after having been allowed to go so far without any protest from [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland|Portland]], the home secretary, or from the premier, Pitt. The latter, disliking the Irish Parliament because it had rejected his commercial propositions in 1785, and disagreed with him on the regency in 1789, already mediated a legislative union, and felt that the admission of Catholics to Parliament would thwart his plans. He was probably also influenced by Beresford, who had powerful friends in England, and by [[George III of the United Kingdom|the king]], whom Fitzgibbon had mischievously convinced that to admit Catholics to Parliament would be to violate his coronation oath. Possibly, other causes concurred with these to bring about the sudden and disastrous change which filled Catholic Ireland with grief, and the whole nation with dismay.\n\nThe new viceroy, [[John Pratt, 1st Marquess Camden|Lord Camden]], was instructed to conciliate the Catholic bishops by setting up a Catholic college for the training of Irish priests; this was done by the establishment of [[Maynooth College]]. But he was to set his face against all Parliamentary reform and all Catholic concessions. These things he did with a will. He at once restored Beresford to office and Foster and Fitzgibbon to favour, the latter being made Earl of Clare. And he stirred up but too successfully the dying embers of sectarian hate, with the result that the Ulster factions, the Protestant \"[[Peep-of-Day Boys]]\" and the Catholic \"[[Defenders (Ireland)|Defenders]]\", became embittered with a change of names. The latter, turning to republican and revolutionary ways, joined the [[United Irish Society]]; the former became merged in the recently{{when|date=January 2011}} formed [[Orange Institution|Orange Society]], taking its name from William of Orange and having Protestant ascendancy and hatred of Catholicism as its battle cries. Extending from Ulster, these rival societies brought into the other provinces the curse of sectarian strife. Instead of putting down both, the Government took sides with the Orangemen; and, while their lawless acts were condoned, the Catholics were hunted down. An Arms' Act, an Insurrection Act, an Indemnity Act, a suspension of the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679|Habeas Corpus Act]] placed them outside the pale of law. An undisciplined soldiery, recruited from the Orange lodges, were then let loose among them. Martial law, free quarters, flogging, picketing, [[half-hanging]], destruction of Catholic property and life, outrages on women followed, until at last Catholic blood was turned into flame. Then [[Wexford Rebellion|Wexford rose]]. Looking back, it now seems certain that, had [[Lazare Hoche|Hoche]] landed at Bantry in 1796, had even a small force landed at Wexford in 1798, or a few other counties displayed the heroism of Wexford, English power in Ireland would, temporarily at least, have been destroyed. But one county could not fight the British Empire, and the rebellion was soon quenched in blood.\n\nCamden's place was then given to [[Lord Cornwallis]], who came to Ireland for the express purpose of carrying a Legislative Union. Foster refused to support him and joined the opposition. Fitzgibbon, however, aided Cornwallis, and so did [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Castlereagh]], who for some time had discharged the duties of chief secretary in the absence of [[Henry Pelham|Mr. Pelham]], and who was now formally appointed to the office. And then began one of the most shameful chapters in Irish history. Even the corrupt Irish Parliament was reluctant to vote away its existence, and in 1799 the opposition was too strong for Castlereagh. But Pitt directed him to persevere, and the great struggle went on. On one side were eloquence and debating power, patriotism, and public virtue, Grattan, Plunket, and Bushe, Foster, Fitzgerald, Ponsonby, and Moore, a truly formidable combination. On the other side were the baser elements of in Parliament, the needy, the spendthrift, the meanly ambitious, operated upon by Castlereagh, with the whole resources of the British Empire at his command. The pensioners and placemen who voted against him at once lost their places and pensions, the military officer was refused promotion, the magistrate was turned off the bench. And while anti-Unionists were unsparingly punished, the Unionists got lavish rewards. The impecunious got well-paid sinecures; the briefless barrister was made a judge or a commissioner; the rich man, ambitious of social distinction, got a peerage, and places and pensions for his friends; and the owners of rotten boroughs to large sums for their interests. The Catholics were promised emancipation in a united Parliament, and in consequence many bishops, some clergy, and a few of the laity supported the Union, not grudging to end an assembly so bigoted and corrupt as the Irish Parliament. By these means Castlereagh triumphed, and in 1801 the United Parliament of Great Britain and Ireland opened its doors.\n\n===Catholic Emancipation===\nThe next quarter of a century was a period of unrequited hope. [[Dr. Troy]], the Archbishop of Dublin, had been a strong advocate of the Union, and had induced nine of his brother bishops to concede a veto on episcopal appointments, not uncommon in European monarchies. In return, he wanted [[Catholic Emancipation|Emancipation]] linked with the Union.  Castlereagh was not averse; but Pitt was publicly non-committal and vague, though the Catholic Unionists had no doubt that he favoured linking concession with passage of the Union thereby creating a totally new dispensation for a United Kingdom. Disappointment ensued when nothing was done in the first session of the United Parliament, and it was increased when Pitt resigned office and was succeeded by [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Addington]], the narrow-minded Speaker. Cornwallis, however, assured Dr. Troy that Pitt had resigned, unable to overcome the reluctance of King George III, who believed it contravened the Act of Settlement, and his coronation oath. Pitt declared that he would never again take office if emancipation were not conceded. In spite of this, he became Premier again in 1804, no longer an advocate of emancipation having pledged never again to raise the question in Parliament during the lifetime of the king. To this pledge he was as faithful as he had been false to his former assurances; when [[Charles James Fox|Fox]] presented the Catholic petition in 1805, Pitt opposed it. After 1806, when both Pitt and Fox died, the Catholic champion was Grattan, who had entered the British Parliament in 1805. In the vain hope of conciliating opponents he was willing, in 1808, to concede the veto. Dr. Troy and the higher Catholics acquiesced. The other bishops were unwilling, and rejected  the offer of a state-paid clergy or state-appointed bishops. The agitation of the question, however, did not cease, and for many years it distracted Catholic plans and weakened Catholic effort. Further complications arose when, in 1814, the prefect of the Propaganda, Quarantotti, issued a rescript favouring the veto. He acted, however, beyond his powers in the absence of [[Pius VII]], who was in France. When the Pope returned to Rome, after the fall of [[Napoleon]], the rescript was disavowed.\n\nIn these years the Catholics badly needed a leader. [[John Keogh]], the able leader of 1793, was then old, and Lords Fingall and Gormanstone, Mr. Scully and Dr. Dromgoole, were not the men to grapple with great difficulties and powerful opponents. An abler and more vigorous leader was required, one with less faith in petitions and protestations of loyalty. Such a leader was found in [[Daniel O'Connell]], a Catholic barrister whose first public appearance in 1800 was on an anti-Unionist platform. A great lawyer and orator, a great debater, of boundless courage and resources, he took a prominent part on Catholic committees, and from 1810 he held the first place in Catholic esteem. Yet the Catholic cause advanced slowly, and, when Grattan died in 1820, emancipation had not come. Nor would the House of Lords accept Plunket's Bill of 1821, even though it passed the House of Commons and conceded the veto. At last O'Connell determined to rouse the masses, and in 1823, with the help of [[Richard Lalor Sheil]], he founded the [[Catholic Association]]. Its progress at first was slow, but gradually it gathered strength. [[Daniel Murray (archbishop)|Dr. Murray]], the new Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, joined it, and [[James Warren Doyle|Dr. Doyle]], the great Bishop of Kildare; other bishops followed; the clergy and people also came in; and thus rose a great national organization, supervising from its central office in Dublin subsidiary associations in every parish; maintained by a Catholic rent; watching over local and national affairs, discharging, as Mr. Canning described it, \"all the functions of a regular government, and having obtained a complete mastery and control over the masses of the Irish people\". The Association was suppressed in 1825 by Act of Parliament; but O'Connell merely changed the name; and the New Catholic Association with its New Catholic rent continued the work of agitation as of old. Nor was this all. By the Catholic Relief Act of 1793 the forty-shilling freeholders obtained the franchise. These freeholders were in the power of the landlords. Protected by a powerful association, and encouraged by the priests and by O'Connell, the freeholders broke free. In Waterford, Louth, Meath, and elsewhere they voted for the nominees of the Catholic Association at elections, and humbled the landlords. They returned O'Connell himself for Clare in 1828. The Tory ministers, [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] and [[Robert Peel|Peel]], steered the passage of the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Relief Bill of 1829]]. The forty-shilling freeholders, however, were temporarily disfranchised, and provisions excluding Catholics from some of the higher civil and military offices, prohibiting priests from wearing vestments outside their churches, bishops from assuming the titles of their sees, and clergy from obtaining charitable bequests. In other respects U.K. Roman Catholics were placed on a level with other denominations, and at last were fully admitted within to the benefits fruits of the constitution.\n\nThe Irish Catholics had several grievances still calling for redress: the [[Church of Ireland|established state Church]], landlordism, and educational inequality. Mr. Gladstone commenced with the Church of Ireland. He introduced [[Irish Church Act 1869|a Bill]] disendowing and disestablishing it. Commissioners were appointed to wind it up, taking charge of its property, then computed at more than \u00a315,000,000. Of this sum, \u00a311,000,000, was given to the disestablished Church, part to the holders of existing offices, part to enable the Church to continue its work. A further sum of nearly \u00a31,000,000 was distributed between Maynooth College, deprived of its annual grant, and the Presbyterian Church deprived of the [[Regium Donum]], the latter getting twice as much as the former. The surplus was to be disposed of by Parliament for such public objects as it might determine.\n\n==Free State and Republic (1922\u2013present)==\n[[Image:Ei-map.svg|right|thumb|Political map of Ireland]]\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church has had a powerful influence over the Irish state since its inception in 1922 although that influence has diminished somewhat in recent decades. The clergy's influence meant that the Irish state had very conservative social policies, banning, for example, [[divorce]], [[contraception]], [[abortion]] and [[pornography]] as well as encouraging the censoring of many books and films. In addition the church largely controlled the state's hospitals, schools and remained the largest provider of many other social services.\n\nWith the partition of Ireland in 1922, 92.6% of the Free State's population were Catholic while 7.4% were Protestant.<ref>M.E.Collins, Ireland 1868\u20131966, (1993) p.431</ref> By the 1960s, the Protestant population had fallen by half. Although emigration was high among all the population, due to a lack of economic opportunity, the rate of Protestant emigration was disproportionate in this period. Many Protestants left the country in the early 1920s, either because they felt unwelcome in a predominantly Catholic and nationalist state, because they were afraid due to the burning of Protestant homes (particularly of the old landed class) by republicans during the civil war, because they regarded themselves as  British and did not wish to live in an independent Irish state, or because of the economic disruption caused by the recent violence. The Catholic Church had also issued a decree, known as ''[[Ne Temere]]'', whereby the children of marriages between Catholics and Protestants had to be brought up as Catholics.\n\n==Sexual abuse scandals==\n\nSince the early 1990s, the church in Ireland has been rocked by many cases of sexual abuse. Enquiries established that hundreds of priests had abused thousands of children in previous decades. In many cases, the abusing priests were moved to other parishes to avoid embarrassment or a scandal, assisted by senior clergy. By 2010 a number of in-depth judicial reports had been published, but with relatively few prosecutions.\n\nSee [[Roman Catholic Church sexual abuse scandal in Ireland]] and [[Magdalene asylum]]\n\n==Influence on Irish society==\n\n===Ireland===\n\n====Politics====\nIn the [[Irish Free State]], now [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the church had a great influence on public opinion as it had supervised public education for about 90% of the population since at least the 1830s. Historically it was associated with the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] movement until 1766, and with [[Irish nationalism]] after [[Catholic emancipation]] was secured in 1829. The church was resurgent between 1829 and the disestablishment of the [[Church of Ireland]] in 1869\u201371, when its most significant leaders included [[Bishop James Doyle]], [[Cardinal Cullen]] and [[John MacHale|Archbishop MacHale]]. The hierarchy supported the democratic and mainly non-violent [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] in the 1880s, and its offshoots, and the policy of [[Irish Home Rule bills|Irish Home Rule]] in 1886\u20131920. It did not support the [[Irish republican]] movement until 1921, as it espoused violence, in spite of support from many individual priests, and opposed the anti-Treaty side in the [[Irish Civil War]]. Despite this relative moderation, Irish Protestants were concerned that a self-governing Ireland would result in \"[[Rome Rule]]\" instead of home rule, and this became an element in the creation of [[Northern Ireland]].\n\nMajor popular church events attended by the political world have included the [[Eucharistic Congress]] in 1932 and the [[Pope John Paul II's visit to Ireland|Papal Visit]] in 1979. The last prelate with strong social and political interests was [[John Charles McQuaid|Archbishop McQuaid]], who retired in 1972.\n\n====Education====\nAfter independence in 1922, the Church remained heavily involved in health care and education, raising money and running institutions which were staffed by Catholic [[religious institute]]s, largely because the new state remained impoverished. Its main political effect was to continue to run schools where religious education was a major element. The hierarchy opposed the free public secondary schools service introduced in 1968 by [[Donogh O'Malley]], in part because they ran almost all such schools. Some have argued that the church's strong efforts since the 1830s to continue the control of Catholic education was primarily to guarantee a continuing source of candidates for the priesthood, as they would have years of training before entering a seminary.<ref>E. Brian Titley \"''Church, State and the control of schooling in Ireland 1900\u20131944''\"; McGill-Queen's Univ. Press, New York 1983.</ref>\n\n====Health care====\nFrom 1930 hospitals were funded by a [[Irish Hospitals' Sweepstake|sweepstake]] (lottery) with tickets frequently distributed or sold by nuns or priests{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}.  On health matters it was seen as unsympathetic to women's needs and in 1950 it opposed the [[Mother and Child Scheme]].\n\n====Morality and censorship====\nIt helped reinforce public [[censorship]] and maintained its own list of banned literature which influenced the State's list. Divorce allowing remarriage was banned in 1924 (though it had been rare), and selling artificial contraception was made illegal. The Church's influence slipped somewhat after 1970, impacted partly by the media and the growing [[feminist]] movement. For instance the [[An Irish solution to an Irish problem|Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979]] showed the ability of the Catholic Church to force the government into a compromise situation over artificial [[contraception]], though unable to get the result it wanted; contraception could now be bought, but only with a prescription from a doctor and supplied only by registered chemists. In the 1983 Amendment to the [[Irish constitution|constitution]] introduced the constitutional prohibition of [[abortion]], which the Church supported, though abortion for social reasons remains illegal under Irish statute law. However the Church failed to influence the  June 1996, removal of the constitutional prohibition of divorce. While the church had opposed divorce allowing remarriage in civil law, its [[canon law]] allowed for a law of [[nullity (conflict)|nullity]] and a limited divorce \"''a mensa et thoro''\", effectively a form of marital separation.  In a further repudiation of the church's teaching, on 22 May 2015, 62% of Irish voters approved the legalization of [[Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|same sex marriage]] in Ireland.\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nThe [[Government of Ireland Act 1920|Government of Ireland Act of 1920]] acted as the constitution of [[Northern Ireland]], in which was enshrined freedom of religion for all of Northern Ireland's citizens.<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/docs/goi231220.htm#1\n| title = The Constitution of Northern Ireland being the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, as amended (Clause 5)\n| accessdate = 13 February 2007\n| author = His Majesty's Government\n| date = 23 December 1920\n| work = Government of Ireland Act, 1920\n| publisher = Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1956\n}}</ref> Here Roman Catholics formed a minority of some 35% of the population, which had mostly supported Irish nationalism and was therefore historically opposed to the creation of Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Roman Catholic schools' council was at first resistant in accepting the role of the government of Northern Ireland, and initially accepted funding only from the government of the [[Irish Free State]] and admitting no school inspectors. Thus it was that the [[Sir Robert Lynn|Lynn]] Committee presented a report to the government, from which an Education Bill was created to update the education system in Northern Ireland, without any co-operation from the Roman Catholic section in education. Instead, in regard to the Roman Catholic schools, the report relied on the guidance of a Roman Catholic who was to become the Permanent Secretary to the Minister of Education \u2014 [[Andrew Nicholas Bonaparte Wyse|A. N. Bonaparte Wyse]].\n\n{{Cquote|We hope that, notwithstanding the disadvantage at which we were placed by this action, it will be found that Roman Catholic interests have not suffered. We have throughout been careful to keep in mind and to make allowance for the particular points of view of Roman Catholics in regard to education so far as known to us, and it has been our desire to refrain as far as we could from recommending any course which might be thought to be contrary to their wishes.<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Morrison\n | first = John\n | title = The Ulster Cover-Up\n | year = 1993\n | publisher = Ulster Society (Publications)\n | location = [[Northern Ireland]]\n | isbn =1-872076-15-7\n | chapter = The Ulster Government and Internal Opposition\n | page = 40\n }}</ref>|20px|20px|Lynn Commission report, 1923}}\n\nMany commentators have suggested that the separate education systems in Northern Ireland after 1921 prolonged the sectarian divisions in that community. Cases of [[gerrymandering]] and preference in public services for non-Catholics led to the need for a [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] in 1967.\n\n===Vatican II===\nIn both parts of Ireland Church policy and practice changed markedly after the [[Vatican II]] reforms of 1962. Probably the largest change was that [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] could be said in [[vernacular]] languages and not in [[Latin]], and in 1981 the Church commissioned its first edition of the [[Bible]] in [[Irish language|Irish]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Catholic Church in Ireland]]\n* [[Eucharistic Congress of Dublin (1932)]]\n* [[History of Ireland]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book|title=History of the Christian Church, Volume IV:Mediavel christianity.

[[Ireland]] is an island to the north-west of [[continental Europe]]. Politically, Ireland is divided between the [[Republic of Ireland]], which covers just under five-sixths of the island, and [[Northern Ireland]], a part of the [[United Kingdom]], which covers the remainder and is located in the north-east of the island. [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] is the largest religious denomination, representing over 73% for the island and about 87% of the Republic of Ireland.\n\n==Introduction of Christianity==\nThe introduction of [[Christianity in Ireland|Christianity to Ireland]] dates to sometime before the 5th century, presumably in interactions with Roman Britain. Christian worship had reached pagan Ireland around 400 AD. It is often misstated that [[St. Patrick]] brought the faith to Ireland, but it was already present on the island before Patrick arrived. Monasteries were built for monks who wanted permanent communion with God. The lengths they went to for tranquility are evident from the monastery of [[Skellig Michael]]. Via [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|Aidan]], Christianity spread among the [[Picts]] and [[Northumbrians]].\n\nScholars have long considered the term \"[[Celtic Church]]\" to be inappropriate for describing Christianity among [[Celtic languages|Celtic-speaking]] peoples, since this would imply a notion of unity, or a self-identifying entity, that did not exist.<ref>D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn, ''Early Medieval Ireland 400\u20131200'' (London, 1995); T.

Stephen Baxter (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2006), pp. 207\u2013208, 220 n. 3</ref> Some scholars have chosen to apply the term \"[[Insular Christianity]]\" to this Christian practice that arose around the [[Irish Sea]].\n\n==Palladius and Patrick==\nAccording to [[Prosper of Aquitaine]], [[Palladius (bishop of Ireland)|Palladius]] was from a noble family in [[Gaul]]. In 429, he was serving as a deacon in Rome. The Pope commissioned him to send [[Germanus of Auxerre|Germanus]], Bishop of Auxerre, to investigate rumors of [[Pelagianism]] in Britain. In 431, [[Pope Celestine I]] consecrated Palladius a bishop and sent him to minister to the \"Scots believing in Christ\".<ref name=cusack>{{Cite web|url=https://www.libraryireland.com/HistoryIreland/Mission-St-Palladius.php|title=Mission of St. Palladius - Illustrated History of Ireland|website=www.libraryireland.com}}</ref> His mission mainly seems to have been to Irish Christians in the east midlands, Leinster, and perhaps east Munster. It is uncertain if he converted any Irish. What little is known of his mission appears to have been successful, though it was later downplayed by partisans of Patrick.\n\nSaint Patrick's dates are uncertain. All that can be said is that he was alive sometime in the fifth century, and was a missionary bishop rather than ministering to Christians. His areas appear to have been Ulster and north Connacht, but very little can be said with certainty about him. Later tradition from the seventh-century onwards is known to be unreliable.{{cn|date=June 2017}}\n\n==Native ministry==\n\nMonastic establishments arose in the sixth century, such as [[Clonard Abbey|Clonard]], founded by [[Finnian of Clonard|St. Finian]], [[Clonfert]] by [[St. Brendan]], [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]] by [[St. Comgall]], [[Clonmacnoise]] by [[Ciar\u00e1n of Clonmacnoise|St. Kieran]], [[Killeaney]] by [[St. Enda of Aran|St. Enda]]; and, in the seventh century, [[Lismore, County Waterford|Lismore]] by [[St. Carthage]] and [[Glendalough]] by [[St Kevin|St. Kevin]].\n\nIn 563, [[St. Columba]], a native of Donegal, accompanied by a few companions, crossed the sea to [[Caledonia]] and founded a monastery on the desolate island of [[Iona]].\n\n==Irish monasteries==\n{{expand section|date=October 2018}}\nFresh arrivals came from Ireland; the monastery with Columba as its abbot was soon a flourishing institution, from which the [[Dal Riada|Dalriadian]] Scots in the south and the Picts beyond the Grampians were evangelized. When Columba died in 597, Christianity had been preached and received in every district in Caledonia, and in every island along its west coast. In the next century Iona had so prospered that its abbot, [[St. Adamnan]], wrote in excellent Latin the \"Life of St. Columba\". From Iona had gone south the Irish Aidan and his Irish companions to evangelize Northumbria, Mercia, and Essex.\n\n==Missionaries abroad==\n[[Image:KellsFol292rIncipJohn.jpg|thumb|A page from the ''[[Book of Kells]]'' that opens the [[Gospel of John]]]]\n\n[[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Missionaries from Ireland]] to [[England]] and [[Continental Europe]] spread news of the flowering of learning, and scholars from other nations came to Irish monasteries. The excellence and isolation of these monasteries helped preserve Latin learning during the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The period of [[Insular art]], mainly in the fields of [[illuminated manuscript]]s, metalworking, and sculpture flourished and produced such treasures as the [[Book of Kells]], the [[Ardagh Chalice]], and the many carved [[high cross|stone crosses]] that dot the island.\n\nThese monasteries served as sanctuary to many of the continents great scholars and theologians. It was here that the lamp of Latin learning was preserved for the ages. During this age, the great illuminated manuscripts of Ireland were produced. Arguably the finest such work is ''[[The Book of Kells]]'' which may still be viewed at [[Trinity College, Dublin]].\n\nThe first significant renewal of learning in the West came with the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] of the [[Early Middle Ages]]. [[Charlemagne]], advised by [[Peter of Pisa]] and [[Alcuin of York]], attracted the scholars of England and Ireland, and by decree in AD 787 established schools in every abbey in his empire.  These schools, from which the name ''scholasticism'' is derived, became centres of medieval learning.  During the early [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] period, knowledge of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek language]] had vanished in the west except in Ireland, where it was widely dispersed in the monastic schools.<ref>MacManus, p 215</ref>\n\nIrish scholars had a considerable presence in the [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish court]], where they were renowned for their learning.<ref name=\"StanfordEriugena\">{{Cite web|title=John Scottus Eriugena |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scottus-eriugena/ |work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |date=2004-10-17 |accessdate=2008-07-21 }}</ref> Among them was [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]], one of the founders of scholasticism.<ref name=\"Gothic\">Toman, p 10: \"[[Peter Abelard|Abelard]] himself was\u2026 together with John Scotus Erigena (9th century), and [[Lanfranc]] and [[Anselm of Canterbury]] (both 11th century), one of the founders of scholasticism.\"</ref> Eriugena was the most significant Irish intellectual of the early monastic period, and an outstanding philosopher in terms of originality.<ref name=\"StanfordEriugena\"/> He had considerable familiarity with the Greek language, and translated many works into Latin, affording access to the [[Cappadocian Fathers]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|Greek theological tradition]].<ref name=\"StanfordEriugena\"/>\n\n==Arrival of the Vikings==\n{{cleanup|section|date=March 2010}}\nDuring the ninth and tenth centuries, waves of Norse warriors ransacked the countryside. The monasteries were favourite targets for their treasures of golden religious ornaments.\n\nAs the eighth century neared its close, religion and learning still flourished, but unexpected dangers approached and a new enemy came, before whose assaults monk and monastery and saint and scholar disappeared. These invaders were the Danes from the coasts of Scandinavia. Pagans and pirates, they were formidable foes both on land and sea.\n\nIn Ireland as elsewhere they attacked the monasteries and churches, desecrated the altars, carried away the gold and silver vessels, and smoking ruins and murdered monks attested the fury of their assaults. Under native and Christian chiefs churches were destroyed, church lands appropriated by laymen, monastic schools deserted, and lay abbots ruled at Armagh and elsewhere. Bishops were consecrated without sees and conferred orders for money, there was chaos in church government and corruption everywhere.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nIn a series of synods beginning with [[Synod of R\u00e1th Breasail|R\u00e1th Breasail]] (1118) and including [[Synod of Kells|Kells]] (1152), at which the [[Papal legate|pope's legate]] presided, many salutary enactments were passed, and for the first time [[Diocesan bishop|diocesan episcopacy]] was established. Meanwhile, [[St. Malachy]], Archbishop of Armagh, had done very remarkable work in his own diocese and elsewhere. His early death in 1148 was a heavy blow to the cause of church reform. Nor could so many evils be cured in a single life, or by the labours of a single man; and in spite of his efforts and the efforts of others the decrees of synods were often flouted, and the new diocesan boundaries ignored.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==Anglo-Normans==\nIn December 1154, Henry Plantagenet, Duke of Normandy and Aquitaine, by the [[Treaty of Wallingford]] and a large fleet, became in addition [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], King of England. In that same month an Englishman, [[Nicholas Breakspeare]], was elected [[Pope Adrian IV]]. Henry intended, as shown by his later [[Constitutions of Clarendon]], to establish the supremacy of the civil law and courts above the [[ecclesiastical]] law and courts. In the first full year of Henry's reign (1155) he procured the Papal Bull [[Laudabiliter]] from the Hertfordshire born [[Pope Adrian IV]] authorizing Henry to proceed to conquer Ireland \"to check the torrent of wickedness to reform evil manners, to sow the seeds of virtue\". The quid pro quo was the condition that a penny should be yearly paid from each house to the See of Rome (the still extant Peter's Pence). Henry and the Pope also had other reasons (see [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], section \"Lordship over Ireland\"). The invasion was put aside while Henry attended to other matters. Henry continued to battle the supreme power of the Church, and [[Thomas Becket]] in England. In 1166, Henry took the opportunity to accede to the request by displaced Irish [[R\u00ed]] of Leinster, [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]] for assistance in regaining his Irish territory. A first contingent of the [[Norman Invasion of Ireland]] came to Ireland in 1169 under [[Maurice FitzGerald, Lord of Lanstephan|Maurice Fitzgerald]], followed by a stronger force under Strongbow ([[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]]) in 1170, the year Thomas \u00e0 Beckett was murdered. In 1171 Henry himself landed at Waterford and proceeded to Dublin, where he spent the winter, and received the submission of most of the Irish chiefs. This submission was outlined in the [[Treaty of Windsor 1175]].\n\n==Reformation and beyond==\nIt was not until the end of the 17th centuries that the Crown of England gained full control of Ireland by means of [[History of Ireland (1536\u20131691)|a series of military campaigns]] in the period 1534\u20131691.  During this period, the island was progressively [[Plantations of Ireland|colonised]] by English and Scottish Protestant settlers.  Most of the Irish remained Roman Catholic.\n\n===Henry VIII===\n[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] decided to destroy the power of the Anglo-Norman kings and take control of Ireland. As he did so, he put English lords in charge of confiscated land and plundered the Catholic monasteries and churches, as he had done in England. In 1536 during the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], Henry arranged to be declared head of the Church in Ireland through an act of the Irish Parliament. When the [[Church of England]] was reformed under [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], so too was the Church of Ireland.\n\nIn the beginning of his reign, Henry VIII was preoccupied with more pressing matters in England and on the European Continent, and therefore paid little attention to Ireland.  It was not until he had reigned for a quarter of a century on the throne that he turned his attention to Ireland and then it was primarily due his conflict with the Church over his marriage to Catherine of Aragon.  Then Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy, which invested Henry with spiritual jurisdiction over England and proclaimed him head of the Church of England rather than the Pope.  When the proctors of the clergy refused to agree to this measure, the irate monarch deprived them of the right of voting, confiscated church lands and suppressed monasteries, in some cases shedding the blood of their inmates, in the remaining cases evicting them and making them homeless and poor.\n\n===Elizabeth I===\nFearing Ireland's Catholicism and strategic value for her enemies, Elizabeth consolidated English power in Ireland.\n\nThe [[established church]] in Ireland underwent a period of more radical [[Calvinist]] doctrine than occurred in England. [[James Ussher]] (later [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Armagh]]) authored the [[Irish Articles]], adopted in 1615. In 1634, the [[Irish Convocation]] adopted the English [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] alongside the Irish Articles.  After the Restoration of 1660, it seems that the Thirty-Nine Articles took precedence; they remain the official doctrine of the Church of Ireland even after disestablishment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds1.ix.vi.x.html|title=Creeds of Christendom, with a History and Critical notes.

The History of Creeds. - Christian Classics Ethereal Library|website=www.ccel.org}}</ref>\n\nThe English-speaking minority mostly adhered to the Church of Ireland or to Presbyterianism, while the Irish-speaking majority remained faithful to the Latin liturgy of Roman Catholicism. From this period on, sectarian conflict became a recurrent theme in Irish history.\n\n===Translation of the Bible into Irish===\nThe first Irish translation of the New Testament was begun by [[Nicholas Walsh (Bishop of Ossory)|Nicholas Walsh]], [[Bishop of Ossory]], who worked on it until he was murdered in 1585. The work was continued by John Kearny, his assistant, and [[Nehemiah Donellan]], [[Church of Ireland Archdiocese of Tuam|Archbishop of Tuam]]; it was finally completed by [[William O'Domhnuill]] (William Daniell, Archbishop of Tuam in succession to Donellan). Their work was printed in 1602. The work of translating the Old Testament was undertaken by [[William Bedel]] (1571\u20131642), [[Bishop of Kilmore (Church of Ireland)|Bishop of Kilmore]], who completed his translation within the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], although it was not published until 1680 in a revised version by [[Narcissus Marsh]] (1638\u20131713), Archbishop of Dublin. William Bedell had undertaken a translation of the [[Book of Common Prayer]] in 1606. An Irish translation of the revised prayer book of 1662 was effected by John Richardson (1664\u20131747) and published in 1712.\n\nThe first translation of the entire Bible that was approved by the church was ''An B\u00edobla Naofa'', supervised by [[P\u00e1draig \u00d3 Fiannachta]] at [[Maynooth]] and published in 1981.\n\n==Persecution and Penal Laws==\n\nThe [[Irish Confederate Wars]] resulted in much destruction of church property. Irish Catholics were severely persecuted under [[Oliver Cromwell]], their situation only slightly improving under the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] kings. The land settlements in the aftermath of these wars, and the defeat of James II in 1691, reduced Irish Catholic freeholders to a fraction of their previous size. The introduction of the [[Penal Laws]] further proscribed the practise of Roman Catholicism, with many priests and bishops forced into hiding or exile. Not until the 1770s did the religious climate relax, somewhat.\n\n==Protestant ascendancy (1691\u20131801)==\n{{Main article|Ireland 1691\u20131801}}\n\nBefore the Stuart accession, Ireland was divided into thirty-four [[borough]]s. In 1613, forty new boroughs were created, all of them dominated by Protestants.  The consequence of this was the reduction of the Catholic majority in the Irish parliament to a minority.  By the end of the seventeenth century all Catholics, representing some 85% of Ireland's population then, were banned from the Irish parliament. As a result, political power rested entirely in the hands of a British settler-colonial, and more specifically [[Anglican]], minority while the [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] population suffered severe [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|political and economic privations]].\n\nBy the late 18th century, many of the [[Anglo-Irish]] [[ruling class]] had come to see Ireland as their native country. A Parliamentary faction led by [[Henry Grattan]] agitated for a more favourable trading relationship with England and for greater legislative independence for the [[Parliament of Ireland]]. However, reform in Ireland stalled over the more radical proposals to [[Catholic Emancipation|enfranchise Irish Catholics]]. This was enabled in 1793, but Catholics could not yet enter parliament or become government officials.\n\n===Oath of Allegiance===\nBy the [[Treaty of Limerick]] the Catholic soldiers of King James were pardoned, protected against forfeiture of their estates, and were free to go abroad if they chose. All Catholics might substitute an oath of allegiance for the oath of supremacy, and were to have such privileges \"as were consistent with the laws of Ireland, or as they did enjoy in the reign of Charles II\". King William also promised to have the Irish Parliament grant a further relaxation of the penal laws in force. This treaty, however, was soon torn to shreds, and in spite of William's appeals the Irish Parliament refused to ratify it, and embarked on fresh penal legislation. Under these new laws Catholics were excluded from Parliament, from the bench and bar, from the army and navy, from all civil offices, from the corporations, and even from the corporate towns. They could not have Catholic schools at home or attend foreign schools, or inherit landed property, or hold land under lease, or act as executors or administrators, or have arms or ammunition, or a horse worth \u00a35. Neither could they bury their dead in Catholic ruins, or make pilgrimages to holy wells, or observe Catholic holidays. They could not intermarry with the Protestants, the clergyman assisting at such marriages being liable to death. The wife of a Catholic landlord turning Protestant got separate maintenance; the son turning Protestant got the whole estate; and the Catholic landlord having only Catholic children was obliged at death to divide his estate among his children in equal shares. All the [[regular clergy]], as well as bishops and vicars-general should quit the kingdom. The [[secular clergy]] might remain, but must be registered, nor could they have on their churches either steeple or bell.\n\nIn 1728, the Catholics outnumbered Protestants 5 to 1. A few Catholics managed to hold their estates with the collaboration of friendly Protestants; the remainder gradually sank to the level of [[Cotter (farmer)|cottiers]] and day-labourers, reduced to a standard of living far below what they had been used to. Many Catholics chose to emigrate in the hopes of finding a more congenial environment.\n\n===Irish Parliament and the Passing of Tolerance===\nIn the Irish Parliament meanwhile a spirit of independence appeared. As the Parliament of the Pale it had been so often used for factious purposes that in 1496 [[Poynings' Law (on certification of acts)|Poynings' Law]] was passed, providing that henceforth no Irish Parliament could meet, and no law could be proposed, without the previous consent of both the [[Irish Privy Council|Irish]] and [[Privy Council of England|English Privy Council]]s. Further, the English Parliament claimed the right to legislate for Ireland; and in the laws prohibiting the importation of Irish cattle (1665), and Irish woollen manufactures (1698), and that dealing with the Irish forfeited estates (1700), it asserted its supposed right.\n\nWhen one member, Molyneux, protested, the English Parliament condemned him, and ordered his book to be burned by the common hangman. Moreover, it passed [[Dependency of Ireland on Great Britain Act 1719|an Act in 1719]] expressly declaring that it had power to legislate for Ireland, taking away also the appellate jurisdiction of the [[Irish House of Lords]]. The fight made by Swift against Wood's halfpence showed that, though Molyneux was dead, his spirit lived; Lucas continued the fight, and [[Henry Grattan|Grattan]] in [[Repeal of Act for Securing Dependence of Ireland Act 1782|1782 obtained legislative independence]].\n\nIn 1778 by an Act enabling Catholics to hold all lands under lease; and in 1782 by a further Act allowing them to erect Catholic schools, with the permission of the Protestant bishop of the diocese, to own a horse worth more than \u00a35, and to assist at Mass without being compelled to accuse the officiating priest. Nor were Catholic bishops any longer compelled to quit the kingdom, nor Catholic children specially rewarded if they turned Protestant. Not for ten years was there any further concession, and then an Act was passed allowing Catholics to erect schools without seeking Protestant permission, admitting Catholics to the Bar, and legalizing marriages between Protestants and Catholics. Much more important was the Act of 1793 giving the Catholics the Parliamentary and municipal franchise, admitting them to the universities and to military and civil offices, and removing all restrictions in regard to the tenure of land. They were still excluded from Parliament, from the inner Bar, and from a few of the higher civil and military offices.\n\nAlways in favour of religious liberty, Grattan would have swept away every vestige of the Penal code. But, in 1782, he mistakenly thought that his work was done when legislative independence was conceded. He forgot that the executive was still left independent of Parliament, answerable only to the English ministry; and that, with rotten boroughs controlled by a few great families, with an extremely limited franchise in the counties, and with pensioners and [[Wikt:placeman|placemen]] filling so many seats, the Irish Parliament was but a mockery of representation.\n\nLike Grattan, [[Henry Flood|Flood]] and Charlemont favoured Parliamentary reform, but, unlike him, they were opposed to Catholic concessions. As for Foster and Fitzgibbon, who led the forces of corruption and bigotry, they opposed every attempt at reform, and consented to the Act of 1793 only under strong pressure from [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] and [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville|Dundas]]. These English ministers, alarmed at the progress of [[French revolution]]ary principles in Ireland, fearing a foreign invasion, wished to have the Catholics contented. In 1795 further concessions seemed imminent. In that year an illiberal [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|viceroy]], [[John Fane, 10th Earl of Westmorland|Lord Westmoreland]], was replaced by the liberal-minded [[William Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam|Lord Fitzwilliam]], who came understanding it to be the wish of Pitt that the Catholic claims were to be conceded. He at once dismissed from office a rapacious office-holder named [[John Beresford (statesman)|Beresford]], so powerful that he was called the \"King of Ireland\"; he refused to consult [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland|Lord Chancellor]] [[John FitzGibbon, 1st Earl of Clare|Fitzgibbon]] or [[John Foster, 1st Baron Oriel|Foster]], the Speaker; he took Grattan and [[William Ponsonby, 1st Baron Ponsonby|Ponsonby]] into his confidence, and declared his intention to support Grattan's bill admitting Catholics to Parliament. The high hopes raised by these events were dashed to the earth when Fitzwilliam was suddenly recalled, after having been allowed to go so far without any protest from [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland|Portland]], the home secretary, or from the premier, Pitt. The latter, disliking the Irish Parliament because it had rejected his commercial propositions in 1785, and disagreed with him on the regency in 1789, already mediated a legislative union, and felt that the admission of Catholics to Parliament would thwart his plans. He was probably also influenced by Beresford, who had powerful friends in England, and by [[George III of the United Kingdom|the king]], whom Fitzgibbon had mischievously convinced that to admit Catholics to Parliament would be to violate his coronation oath. Possibly, other causes concurred with these to bring about the sudden and disastrous change which filled Catholic Ireland with grief, and the whole nation with dismay.\n\nThe new viceroy, [[John Pratt, 1st Marquess Camden|Lord Camden]], was instructed to conciliate the Catholic bishops by setting up a Catholic college for the training of Irish priests; this was done by the establishment of [[Maynooth College]]. But he was to set his face against all Parliamentary reform and all Catholic concessions. These things he did with a will. He at once restored Beresford to office and Foster and Fitzgibbon to favour, the latter being made Earl of Clare. And he stirred up but too successfully the dying embers of sectarian hate, with the result that the Ulster factions, the Protestant \"[[Peep-of-Day Boys]]\" and the Catholic \"[[Defenders (Ireland)|Defenders]]\", became embittered with a change of names. The latter, turning to republican and revolutionary ways, joined the [[United Irish Society]]; the former became merged in the recently{{when|date=January 2011}} formed [[Orange Institution|Orange Society]], taking its name from William of Orange and having Protestant ascendancy and hatred of Catholicism as its battle cries. Extending from Ulster, these rival societies brought into the other provinces the curse of sectarian strife. Instead of putting down both, the Government took sides with the Orangemen; and, while their lawless acts were condoned, the Catholics were hunted down. An Arms' Act, an Insurrection Act, an Indemnity Act, a suspension of the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679|Habeas Corpus Act]] placed them outside the pale of law. An undisciplined soldiery, recruited from the Orange lodges, were then let loose among them. Martial law, free quarters, flogging, picketing, [[half-hanging]], destruction of Catholic property and life, outrages on women followed, until at last Catholic blood was turned into flame. Then [[Wexford Rebellion|Wexford rose]]. Looking back, it now seems certain that, had [[Lazare Hoche|Hoche]] landed at Bantry in 1796, had even a small force landed at Wexford in 1798, or a few other counties displayed the heroism of Wexford, English power in Ireland would, temporarily at least, have been destroyed. But one county could not fight the British Empire, and the rebellion was soon quenched in blood.\n\nCamden's place was then given to [[Lord Cornwallis]], who came to Ireland for the express purpose of carrying a Legislative Union. Foster refused to support him and joined the opposition. Fitzgibbon, however, aided Cornwallis, and so did [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Castlereagh]], who for some time had discharged the duties of chief secretary in the absence of [[Henry Pelham|Mr. Pelham]], and who was now formally appointed to the office. And then began one of the most shameful chapters in Irish history. Even the corrupt Irish Parliament was reluctant to vote away its existence, and in 1799 the opposition was too strong for Castlereagh. But Pitt directed him to persevere, and the great struggle went on. On one side were eloquence and debating power, patriotism, and public virtue, Grattan, Plunket, and Bushe, Foster, Fitzgerald, Ponsonby, and Moore, a truly formidable combination. On the other side were the baser elements of in Parliament, the needy, the spendthrift, the meanly ambitious, operated upon by Castlereagh, with the whole resources of the British Empire at his command. The pensioners and placemen who voted against him at once lost their places and pensions, the military officer was refused promotion, the magistrate was turned off the bench. And while anti-Unionists were unsparingly punished, the Unionists got lavish rewards. The impecunious got well-paid sinecures; the briefless barrister was made a judge or a commissioner; the rich man, ambitious of social distinction, got a peerage, and places and pensions for his friends; and the owners of rotten boroughs to large sums for their interests. The Catholics were promised emancipation in a united Parliament, and in consequence many bishops, some clergy, and a few of the laity supported the Union, not grudging to end an assembly so bigoted and corrupt as the Irish Parliament. By these means Castlereagh triumphed, and in 1801 the United Parliament of Great Britain and Ireland opened its doors.\n\n===Catholic Emancipation===\nThe next quarter of a century was a period of unrequited hope. [[Dr. Troy]], the Archbishop of Dublin, had been a strong advocate of the Union, and had induced nine of his brother bishops to concede a veto on episcopal appointments, not uncommon in European monarchies. In return, he wanted [[Catholic Emancipation|Emancipation]] linked with the Union.  Castlereagh was not averse; but Pitt was publicly non-committal and vague, though the Catholic Unionists had no doubt that he favoured linking concession with passage of the Union thereby creating a totally new dispensation for a United Kingdom. Disappointment ensued when nothing was done in the first session of the United Parliament, and it was increased when Pitt resigned office and was succeeded by [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Addington]], the narrow-minded Speaker. Cornwallis, however, assured Dr. Troy that Pitt had resigned, unable to overcome the reluctance of King George III, who believed it contravened the Act of Settlement, and his coronation oath. Pitt declared that he would never again take office if emancipation were not conceded. In spite of this, he became Premier again in 1804, no longer an advocate of emancipation having pledged never again to raise the question in Parliament during the lifetime of the king. To this pledge he was as faithful as he had been false to his former assurances; when [[Charles James Fox|Fox]] presented the Catholic petition in 1805, Pitt opposed it. After 1806, when both Pitt and Fox died, the Catholic champion was Grattan, who had entered the British Parliament in 1805. In the vain hope of conciliating opponents he was willing, in 1808, to concede the veto. Dr. Troy and the higher Catholics acquiesced. The other bishops were unwilling, and rejected  the offer of a state-paid clergy or state-appointed bishops. The agitation of the question, however, did not cease, and for many years it distracted Catholic plans and weakened Catholic effort. Further complications arose when, in 1814, the prefect of the Propaganda, Quarantotti, issued a rescript favouring the veto. He acted, however, beyond his powers in the absence of [[Pius VII]], who was in France. When the Pope returned to Rome, after the fall of [[Napoleon]], the rescript was disavowed.\n\nIn these years the Catholics badly needed a leader. [[John Keogh]], the able leader of 1793, was then old, and Lords Fingall and Gormanstone, Mr. Scully and Dr. Dromgoole, were not the men to grapple with great difficulties and powerful opponents. An abler and more vigorous leader was required, one with less faith in petitions and protestations of loyalty. Such a leader was found in [[Daniel O'Connell]], a Catholic barrister whose first public appearance in 1800 was on an anti-Unionist platform. A great lawyer and orator, a great debater, of boundless courage and resources, he took a prominent part on Catholic committees, and from 1810 he held the first place in Catholic esteem. Yet the Catholic cause advanced slowly, and, when Grattan died in 1820, emancipation had not come. Nor would the House of Lords accept Plunket's Bill of 1821, even though it passed the House of Commons and conceded the veto. At last O'Connell determined to rouse the masses, and in 1823, with the help of [[Richard Lalor Sheil]], he founded the [[Catholic Association]]. Its progress at first was slow, but gradually it gathered strength. [[Daniel Murray (archbishop)|Dr. Murray]], the new Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, joined it, and [[James Warren Doyle|Dr. Doyle]], the great Bishop of Kildare; other bishops followed; the clergy and people also came in; and thus rose a great national organization, supervising from its central office in Dublin subsidiary associations in every parish; maintained by a Catholic rent; watching over local and national affairs, discharging, as Mr. Canning described it, \"all the functions of a regular government, and having obtained a complete mastery and control over the masses of the Irish people\". The Association was suppressed in 1825 by Act of Parliament; but O'Connell merely changed the name; and the New Catholic Association with its New Catholic rent continued the work of agitation as of old. Nor was this all. By the Catholic Relief Act of 1793 the forty-shilling freeholders obtained the franchise. These freeholders were in the power of the landlords. Protected by a powerful association, and encouraged by the priests and by O'Connell, the freeholders broke free. In Waterford, Louth, Meath, and elsewhere they voted for the nominees of the Catholic Association at elections, and humbled the landlords. They returned O'Connell himself for Clare in 1828. The Tory ministers, [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] and [[Robert Peel|Peel]], steered the passage of the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Relief Bill of 1829]]. The forty-shilling freeholders, however, were temporarily disfranchised, and provisions excluding Catholics from some of the higher civil and military offices, prohibiting priests from wearing vestments outside their churches, bishops from assuming the titles of their sees, and clergy from obtaining charitable bequests. In other respects U.K. Roman Catholics were placed on a level with other denominations, and at last were fully admitted within to the benefits fruits of the constitution.\n\nThe Irish Catholics had several grievances still calling for redress: the [[Church of Ireland|established state Church]], landlordism, and educational inequality. Mr. Gladstone commenced with the Church of Ireland. He introduced [[Irish Church Act 1869|a Bill]] disendowing and disestablishing it. Commissioners were appointed to wind it up, taking charge of its property, then computed at more than \u00a315,000,000. Of this sum, \u00a311,000,000, was given to the disestablished Church, part to the holders of existing offices, part to enable the Church to continue its work. A further sum of nearly \u00a31,000,000 was distributed between Maynooth College, deprived of its annual grant, and the Presbyterian Church deprived of the [[Regium Donum]], the latter getting twice as much as the former. The surplus was to be disposed of by Parliament for such public objects as it might determine.\n\n==Free State and Republic (1922\u2013present)==\n[[Image:Ei-map.svg|right|thumb|Political map of Ireland]]\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church has had a powerful influence over the Irish state since its inception in 1922 although that influence has diminished somewhat in recent decades. The clergy's influence meant that the Irish state had very conservative social policies, banning, for example, [[divorce]], [[contraception]], [[abortion]] and [[pornography]] as well as encouraging the censoring of many books and films. In addition the church largely controlled the state's hospitals, schools and remained the largest provider of many other social services.\n\nWith the partition of Ireland in 1922, 92.6% of the Free State's population were Catholic while 7.4% were Protestant.<ref>M.E.Collins, Ireland 1868\u20131966, (1993) p.431</ref> By the 1960s, the Protestant population had fallen by half. Although emigration was high among all the population, due to a lack of economic opportunity, the rate of Protestant emigration was disproportionate in this period. Many Protestants left the country in the early 1920s, either because they felt unwelcome in a predominantly Catholic and nationalist state, because they were afraid due to the burning of Protestant homes (particularly of the old landed class) by republicans during the civil war, because they regarded themselves as  British and did not wish to live in an independent Irish state, or because of the economic disruption caused by the recent violence. The Catholic Church had also issued a decree, known as ''[[Ne Temere]]'', whereby the children of marriages between Catholics and Protestants had to be brought up as Catholics.\n\n==Sexual abuse scandals==\n\nSince the early 1990s, the church in Ireland has been rocked by many cases of sexual abuse. Enquiries established that hundreds of priests had abused thousands of children in previous decades. In many cases, the abusing priests were moved to other parishes to avoid embarrassment or a scandal, assisted by senior clergy. By 2010 a number of in-depth judicial reports had been published, but with relatively few prosecutions.\n\nSee [[Roman Catholic Church sexual abuse scandal in Ireland]] and [[Magdalene asylum]]\n\n==Influence on Irish society==\n\n===Ireland===\n\n====Politics====\nIn the [[Irish Free State]], now [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the church had a great influence on public opinion as it had supervised public education for about 90% of the population since at least the 1830s. Historically it was associated with the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] movement until 1766, and with [[Irish nationalism]] after [[Catholic emancipation]] was secured in 1829. The church was resurgent between 1829 and the disestablishment of the [[Church of Ireland]] in 1869\u201371, when its most significant leaders included [[Bishop James Doyle]], [[Cardinal Cullen]] and [[John MacHale|Archbishop MacHale]]. The hierarchy supported the democratic and mainly non-violent [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] in the 1880s, and its offshoots, and the policy of [[Irish Home Rule bills|Irish Home Rule]] in 1886\u20131920. It did not support the [[Irish republican]] movement until 1921, as it espoused violence, in spite of support from many individual priests, and opposed the anti-Treaty side in the [[Irish Civil War]]. Despite this relative moderation, Irish Protestants were concerned that a self-governing Ireland would result in \"[[Rome Rule]]\" instead of home rule, and this became an element in the creation of [[Northern Ireland]].\n\nMajor popular church events attended by the political world have included the [[Eucharistic Congress]] in 1932 and the [[Pope John Paul II's visit to Ireland|Papal Visit]] in 1979. The last prelate with strong social and political interests was [[John Charles McQuaid|Archbishop McQuaid]], who retired in 1972.\n\n====Education====\nAfter independence in 1922, the Church remained heavily involved in health care and education, raising money and running institutions which were staffed by Catholic [[religious institute]]s, largely because the new state remained impoverished. Its main political effect was to continue to run schools where religious education was a major element. The hierarchy opposed the free public secondary schools service introduced in 1968 by [[Donogh O'Malley]], in part because they ran almost all such schools. Some have argued that the church's strong efforts since the 1830s to continue the control of Catholic education was primarily to guarantee a continuing source of candidates for the priesthood, as they would have years of training before entering a seminary.<ref>E. Brian Titley \"''Church, State and the control of schooling in Ireland 1900\u20131944''\"; McGill-Queen's Univ. Press, New York 1983.</ref>\n\n====Health care====\nFrom 1930 hospitals were funded by a [[Irish Hospitals' Sweepstake|sweepstake]] (lottery) with tickets frequently distributed or sold by nuns or priests{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}.  On health matters it was seen as unsympathetic to women's needs and in 1950 it opposed the [[Mother and Child Scheme]].\n\n====Morality and censorship====\nIt helped reinforce public [[censorship]] and maintained its own list of banned literature which influenced the State's list. Divorce allowing remarriage was banned in 1924 (though it had been rare), and selling artificial contraception was made illegal. The Church's influence slipped somewhat after 1970, impacted partly by the media and the growing [[feminist]] movement. For instance the [[An Irish solution to an Irish problem|Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979]] showed the ability of the Catholic Church to force the government into a compromise situation over artificial [[contraception]], though unable to get the result it wanted; contraception could now be bought, but only with a prescription from a doctor and supplied only by registered chemists. In the 1983 Amendment to the [[Irish constitution|constitution]] introduced the constitutional prohibition of [[abortion]], which the Church supported, though abortion for social reasons remains illegal under Irish statute law. However the Church failed to influence the  June 1996, removal of the constitutional prohibition of divorce. While the church had opposed divorce allowing remarriage in civil law, its [[canon law]] allowed for a law of [[nullity (conflict)|nullity]] and a limited divorce \"''a mensa et thoro''\", effectively a form of marital separation.  In a further repudiation of the church's teaching, on 22 May 2015, 62% of Irish voters approved the legalization of [[Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|same sex marriage]] in Ireland.\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nThe [[Government of Ireland Act 1920|Government of Ireland Act of 1920]] acted as the constitution of [[Northern Ireland]], in which was enshrined freedom of religion for all of Northern Ireland's citizens.<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/docs/goi231220.htm#1\n| title = The Constitution of Northern Ireland being the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, as amended (Clause 5)\n| accessdate = 13 February 2007\n| author = His Majesty's Government\n| date = 23 December 1920\n| work = Government of Ireland Act, 1920\n| publisher = Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1956\n}}</ref> Here Roman Catholics formed a minority of some 35% of the population, which had mostly supported Irish nationalism and was therefore historically opposed to the creation of Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Roman Catholic schools' council was at first resistant in accepting the role of the government of Northern Ireland, and initially accepted funding only from the government of the [[Irish Free State]] and admitting no school inspectors. Thus it was that the [[Sir Robert Lynn|Lynn]] Committee presented a report to the government, from which an Education Bill was created to update the education system in Northern Ireland, without any co-operation from the Roman Catholic section in education. Instead, in regard to the Roman Catholic schools, the report relied on the guidance of a Roman Catholic who was to become the Permanent Secretary to the Minister of Education \u2014 [[Andrew Nicholas Bonaparte Wyse|A. N. Bonaparte Wyse]].\n\n{{Cquote|We hope that, notwithstanding the disadvantage at which we were placed by this action, it will be found that Roman Catholic interests have not suffered. We have throughout been careful to keep in mind and to make allowance for the particular points of view of Roman Catholics in regard to education so far as known to us, and it has been our desire to refrain as far as we could from recommending any course which might be thought to be contrary to their wishes.<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Morrison\n | first = John\n | title = The Ulster Cover-Up\n | year = 1993\n | publisher = Ulster Society (Publications)\n | location = [[Northern Ireland]]\n | isbn =1-872076-15-7\n | chapter = The Ulster Government and Internal Opposition\n | page = 40\n }}</ref>|20px|20px|Lynn Commission report, 1923}}\n\nMany commentators have suggested that the separate education systems in Northern Ireland after 1921 prolonged the sectarian divisions in that community. Cases of [[gerrymandering]] and preference in public services for non-Catholics led to the need for a [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] in 1967.\n\n===Vatican II===\nIn both parts of Ireland Church policy and practice changed markedly after the [[Vatican II]] reforms of 1962. Probably the largest change was that [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] could be said in [[vernacular]] languages and not in [[Latin]], and in 1981 the Church commissioned its first edition of the [[Bible]] in [[Irish language|Irish]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Catholic Church in Ireland]]\n* [[Eucharistic Congress of Dublin (1932)]]\n* [[History of Ireland]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book|title=History of the Christian Church, Volume IV:Mediavel christianity.

Virar is also a part of [[Vasai-Virar Municipal Corporation]] in [[Palghar district]], [[Maharashtra]] state of [[India]].\n\n[[Virar railway station]] is the northern-most railway station on the Western Line of [[Mumbai Suburban Railway]]. Real Estate has been booming in Virar because of its tourism and because of big construction players like Rustomjee, [[HDIL]], which has already constructed the buildings.\n\n==Geography==\nThe climate of Virar is tropical. Virar is in Vasai taluka, Palghar district, Maharashtra, India. Metropolitan Mumbai is located to the south of Virar.\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2013}}\n{{Main|Jivdani Mata}}\nThe name Virar, as some believe, actually comes from the God Ekavira. Just as Tunga Parvat becomes \"Tunga-ar\", similarly \"Vira\" becomes \"Vira-ar\".There is a huge temple of Eka-vira Devi on the banks of Vaitarna River at the foothills Tunga Parvat, (this is now totally broken by the continuous raids of Mohamedeans and Portuguese in the last 400 years), where people used to conclude their \"Shurpaaraka Yatra\", as described in the Puranas and local legends. There is a huge tank here dedicated to Eka veera Devi called \"Viraar Tirtha\", i.e. \"Eka- Viraa Tirtha\". Even today, on the west banks of Viraar Tirtha, one finds a carved stone about three feet long and nine inches broad. Below that is a group of female figures of the Yoginis of Ekaveera Devi. Nearby one can find a stone with a roughly cut cow and calf (Savatsa Dhenu), a symbol of Govardhana Math which symbolises eternity or Moksha. Moving ahead near the foot of a knoll of rock are two cow's feet (Go-Paad) roughly cut in rock.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{As of|2011}} India census,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.census2011.co.in/census/city/363-vasai-virar.html?|title=Web Data}}</ref> Virar have a population of 1,221,233.of which male and female are 649,535 and 571,698 respectively. Virar has an average [[literacy rate]] of 91.95%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 81%.\n\nOver a period of time Virar has become a [[wikt:cosmopolitan|cosmopolitan]] suburb with approximately 70% population being Marathi speaking and the rest a mix of other communities, mainly the Catholics and the Gujaratis. 70% of the population is below 30 years. The slow and gradual adoption of the cosmopolitan nature of the city is the result of migration from the Mumbai mainland to this part due to ever increasing cost of the real estate property.\n\nAmong minority languages, [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] is spoken by 16.16% of the population and [[Hindi]] by 25.31%.<ref>{{cite web|title=51st REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER FOR LINGUISTIC MINORITIES IN INDIA|url=http://nclm.nic.in/shared/linkimages/NCLM51stReport.pdf|website=nclm.nic.in|publisher=[[Ministry of Minority Affairs]]|date=15 July 2015|accessdate=15 February 2018|page=151|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180216025959/http://nclm.nic.in/shared/linkimages/NCLM51stReport.pdf|archive-date=16 February 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\nThe city's public school system is managed by the education ministry of the [[Government of Maharashtra]]. Hence the syllabus is under the state pattern devised by the [[Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education]]. There are also other private schools who offer syllabus under [[Central Board of Secondary Education]] (CBSE) and [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education]] (ICSE) guidelines besides the state pattern. The late Shri Vishnu Waman Thakur Charitable trust (VIVA College) and the Agashi-Virar-Arnala Education Society are the two most prominent bodies which have opened many institutes offering education ranging from Kindergarten to PhD degrees in Virar. One can get graduate and post graduate degrees in Arts, Commerce, Commerce, Management studies and Technology through these institutes.\n\nFor Primary education schools such as St.Xavier's high school(virar) John XXIII in Agashi, MGM and National English in the Virar West vicinity were the main ones for English medium in the early 90s. And now you have international schools with CBSE and ICSE like Muljibhai Mehta and Rustomjee International School.\n\n==Tourism and places of attraction==\nDespite being in close proximity to the ever busy lifestyle of [[Mumbai]], Virar manages to be a well known tourist place for many reasons.\n\n===Jivdani Temple===\n\nThis temple of [[Jivdani Mata|Goddess Jivdani]] is located around 1375 steps above the ground level, atop a hill in the eastern part of the city.

Other historical churches in neighbourhood are St. James Church (Agashi) and Church of Holy Spirit (Nandakhal).\n\n===St. James Church===\n[[File:Sunset at arnala.jpg|thumb|Sunset at Arnala beach, Virar]]\nThe St. James church located at Agashi on the road connecting Virar and Arnala, was first built in 1558. Portuguese were the best known seafarers among the European clans who built homes near the sea wherever they went. 'Agasi', the then small port village was one such place. Owing to its nearness to the sea and availability of wood from the jungles, which the Portuguese needed for boat building and constructions, Agashi soon became a permanent settlement for the Portuguese. The St. James Church that came into being during this early period was built using stones and bricks hence it withheld during the Muslim attacks of 1594. But during the raids of Marathas of 1739 it was mostly destroyed. The Marathas however permitted the priests to carry on religious ceremonies in the region and the church was rebuilt by 1760. In the year 1900 the church was renovated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.east-indians.net/Agashi.htm |title=The East- Indians of Agashi |publisher=http://www.east-indians.net |accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Jain Temple===\n\nFor [[Jain Community]] (Sthanakwasi jain, Deravasi and Others) all around Mumbai, this Jain Temple located at Agashi, about 5 kilometres from the Station is very famous{{fact|date=October 2019}} amongst Jains who visit this place Daily and specially on Saturdays, as it is one of the very old temples in Mumbai and the adjoining region.

The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] called the island \"Ilha das vacas\" which means 'Island of the cows' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. Before the Portuguese control of the island, the island was controlled by the Muslim rulers of Gujarat. The island is near the mouth of Vaitarna river and the Portuguese used it to observe and control shipping and navigation along the western coast. The Portuguese captain of [[Vasai|Bassein]] donated the island to a Portuguese nobleman. The nobleman tore down the old fort and began construction of 700-foot by 700-foot fort. The fort was never completed by the nobleman but remained under Portuguese control.\n* Vasai fort (Bassein fort) is also located nearby. The Portuguese established a fort in Bassein, present day Vasai, on the mainland just north of the Bombay [[archipelago]]. The fort was fronted by a harbour. With this as the main base, they built other smaller forts, and strong houses in many of the islands. In the 18th century the fort was attacked by the [[Marathas]] under [[Baji Rao Peshwa]], and fell in 1739 after a three-year-long campaign. The remains of the fort can be reached by bus or taxi from the Vasai railway station. The ramparts overlook Vasai creek and are almost complete, though overgrown.

The Rs 10,000-crore project is expected to provide seamless connectivity by the metro as well as by road from [[Alibaug]] to Virar. The corridor will bypass the western and eastern suburbs and also the routes which will witness growth in the future. The proposed alignment will connect four crucial national highways, [[National Highway 8 (India)|NH8]] (Mumbai-Ahmedabad), [[National Highway 3 (India)|NH3]] (Mumbai-Agra-Delhi), [[National Highway 4 (India)|NH4]] (Mumbai-Chennai) and [[National Highway 17 (India)|NH17]] (Goa-Mangalore-Kerala).

Virar is also a part of [[Vasai-Virar Municipal Corporation]] in [[Palghar district]], [[Maharashtra]] state of [[India]].\n\n[[Virar railway station]] is the northern-most railway station on the Western Line of [[Mumbai Suburban Railway]]. Real Estate has been booming in Virar because of its tourism and because of big construction players like Rustomjee, [[HDIL]], which has already constructed the buildings.\n\n==Geography==\nThe climate of Virar is tropical. Virar is in Vasai taluka, Palghar district, Maharashtra, India. Metropolitan Mumbai is located to the south of Virar.\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2013}}\n{{Main|Jivdani Mata}}\nThe name Virar, as some believe, actually comes from the God Ekavira. Just as Tunga Parvat becomes \"Tunga-ar\", similarly \"Vira\" becomes \"Vira-ar\".There is a huge temple of Eka-vira Devi on the banks of Vaitarna River at the foot hills Tunga Parvat, (this is now totally broken by the continuous raids of Mohamedeans and Portuguese in the last 400 years), where people used to conclude their \"Shurpaaraka Yatra\", as described in the Puranas and local legends. There is a huge tank here dedicated to Eka veera Devi called \"Viraar Tirtha\", i.e. \"Eka- Viraa Tirtha\". Even today, on the west banks of Viraar Tirtha, one finds a carved stone about three feet long and nine inches broad. Below that is a group of female figures of the Yoginis of Ekaveera Devi. Nearby one can find a stone with a roughly cut cow and calf (Savatsa Dhenu), a symbol of Govardhana Math which symbolises eternity or Moksha. Moving ahead near the foot of a knoll of rock are two cow\u2019s feet (Go-Paad) roughly cut in rock.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{As of|2011}} India census,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.census2011.co.in/census/city/363-vasai-virar.html?|title=Web Data}}</ref> Virar have a population of 1,221,233.of which male and female are 649,535 and 571,698 respectively. Virar has an average [[literacy rate]] of 91.95%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 81%.\n\nOver a period of time Virar has become a [[wikt:cosmopolitan|cosmopolitan]] suburb with approximately 70% population being Marathi speaking and the rest a mix of other communities, mainly the Catholics and the Gujaratis. 70% of the population is below 30 years. The slow and gradual adoption of the cosmopolitan nature of the city is the result of migration from the Mumbai mainland to this part due to ever increasing cost of the real estate property.\n\nAmong minority languages, [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] is spoken by 16.16% of the population and [[Hindi]] by 25.31%.<ref>{{cite web|title=51st REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER FOR LINGUISTIC MINORITIES IN INDIA|url=http://nclm.nic.in/shared/linkimages/NCLM51stReport.pdf|website=nclm.nic.in|publisher=[[Ministry of Minority Affairs]]|date=15 July 2015|accessdate=15 February 2018|page=151|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180216025959/http://nclm.nic.in/shared/linkimages/NCLM51stReport.pdf|archive-date=16 February 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\nThe city's public school system is managed by the education ministry of the [[Government of Maharashtra]]. Hence the syllabus is under the state pattern devised by the [[Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education]]. There are also other private schools who offer syllabus under [[Central Board of Secondary Education]] (CBSE) and [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education]] (ICSE) guidelines besides the state pattern. The late Shri Vishnu Waman Thakur Charitable trust (VIVA College) and the Agashi-Virar-Arnala Education Society are the two most prominent bodies which have opened many institutes offering education ranging from Kindergarten to PhD degrees in Virar. One can get graduate and post graduate degrees in Arts, Commerce, Commerce, Management studies and Technology through these institutes.\n\nFor Primary education schools such as St.Xavier's high school(virar) John XXIII in Agashi, MGM and National English in the Virar West vicinity were the main ones for English medium in the early 90s. And now you have international schools with CBSE and ICSE like Muljibhai Mehta and Rustomjee International School.\n\n==Tourism and places of attraction==\nDespite being in close proximity to the ever busy lifestyle of [[Mumbai]], Virar manages to be a well known tourist place for many reasons.\n\n===Jivdani Temple===\n\nThis temple of [[Jivdani Mata|Goddess Jivdani]] is located around 1375 steps above the ground level, atop a hill in the eastern part of the city.

It offers a commanding view of surrounding area from the temple. There are hot water springs in the Vajreshwari area as well as in [[Ganeshpuri]] and in Akloli.

Other historical churches in neighbourhood are St. James Church (Agashi) and Church of Holy Spirit (Nandakhal).\n\n===St. James Church===\n[[File:Sunset at arnala.jpg|thumb|Sunset at Arnala beach, Virar]]\nThe St. James church located at Agashi on the road connecting Virar and Arnala, was first built in 1558. Portuguese were the best known seafarers among the European clans who built homes near the sea wherever they went. 'Agasi', the then small port village was one such place. Owing to its nearness to the sea and availability of wood from the jungles, which the Portuguese needed for boat building and constructions, Agashi soon became a permanent settlement for the Portuguese. The St. James Church that came into being during this early period was built using stones and bricks hence it withheld during the Muslim attacks of 1594. But during the raids of Marathas of 1739 it was mostly destroyed. The Marathas however permitted the priests to carry on religious ceremonies in the region and the church was rebuilt by 1760. In the year 1900 the church was renovated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.east-indians.net/Agashi.htm |title=The East- Indians of Agashi |publisher=http://www.east-indians.net |accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Jain Temple===\n\nFor [[Jain Community]] (Sthanakwasi jain, Deravasi and Others) all around Mumbai, this Jain Temple located at Agashi, about 5 kilometres from the Station is very famous{{fact|date=October 2019}} amongst Jains who visit this place Daily and specially on Saturdays, as it is one of the very old temples in Mumbai and the adjoining region.

The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] called the island \"Ilha das vacas\" which means 'Island of the cows' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. Before the Portuguese control of the island, the island was controlled by the Muslim rulers of Gujarat. The island is near the mouth of Vaitarna river and the Portuguese used it to observe and control shipping and navigation along the western coast. The Portuguese captain of [[Vasai|Bassein]] donated the island to a Portuguese nobleman. The nobleman tore down the old fort and began construction of 700-foot by 700-foot fort. The fort was never completed by the nobleman but remained under Portuguese control.\n* Vasai fort (Bassein fort) is also located nearby. The Portuguese established a fort in Bassein, present day Vasai, on the mainland just north of the Bombay [[archipelago]]. The fort was fronted by a harbour. With this as the main base, they built other smaller forts, and strong houses in many of the islands. In the 18th century the fort was attacked by the [[Marathas]] under [[Baji Rao Peshwa]], and fell in 1739 after a three-year-long campaign. The remains of the fort can be reached by bus or taxi from the Vasai railway station. The ramparts overlook Vasai creek and are almost complete, though overgrown.

The Rs 10,000-crore project is expected to provide seamless connectivity by the metro as well as by road from [[Alibaug]] to Virar. The corridor will bypass the western and eastern suburbs and also the routes which will witness growth in the future. The proposed alignment will connect four crucial national highways, [[National Highway 8 (India)|NH8]] (Mumbai-Ahmedabad), [[National Highway 3 (India)|NH3]] (Mumbai-Agra-Delhi), [[National Highway 4 (India)|NH4]] (Mumbai-Chennai) and [[National Highway 17 (India)|NH17]] (Goa-Mangalore-Kerala).

From 1934 to 1963, Tripolitania was one of three administrative divisions within [[Italian Libya]] and the [[Kingdom of Libya]], alongside [[Cyrenaica]] to the east and [[Fezzan]] to the south.\n\nThe region had been settled since antiquity, first coming to prominence as part of [[Ancient Carthage|the Carthaginian empire]]. Following the defeat of Carthage in the [[Punic Wars]], Rome organized the region (along with what is now modern day [[Tunisia]]), into a [[Roman province|province]] known as [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]], and placed it under the administration of a [[proconsul]]. During the [[Diocletian#Reforms|Diocletian reforms]] of the late 3rd century, all of North Africa was placed into the newly created [[Diocese of Africa]], of which Tripolitania was a constituent province.\n\nAfter the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th century, Tripolitania changed hands between the [[Vandals]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]], until it was taken during the [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb]] in the 8th century. It was part of the region known to the Islamic world as [[Ifriqiya]], whose boundaries roughly mirrored those of the old Roman province of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa Proconsularis]]. Though nominally under the suzerainty of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], local dynasties such as the [[Aghlabids]] and later the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] were practically independent. The native [[Berbers]], who had inhabited the area locally for centuries before the arrival of the [[Arabs]], established their own native [[Hafsid dynasty]] over Ifriqiya in the 13th century, and would control the region until it was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 15th century, who established [[Ottoman Tripolitania]] as a distinct province.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Tripolitania.jpg|thumb|left|Detailed map of Tripolitania]]\n\nIn the old system, Tripolitania included [[Tripoli]], the capital city of Libya and a vast northwestern portion of the country; in the subsequent systems, the sha'biyah of Tripoli has become much smaller than the original Tripolitania, including merely the city of Tripoli and its immediate surroundings. Because the city and the sha'biyah are nowadays almost coextensive, the term \"Tripolitania\" has more historical than contemporary value.

From 1934 to 1963, Tripolitania was one of three administrative divisions within [[Italian Libya]] and the [[Kingdom of Libya]], alongside [[Cyrenaica]] to the east and [[Fezzan]] to the south.\n\nThe region had been settled since antiquity, first coming to prominence as part of [[Ancient Carthage|the Carthaginian empire]]. Following the defeat of Carthage in the [[Punic Wars]], Rome organized the region (along with what is now modern day [[Tunisia]]), into a [[Roman province|province]] known as [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]], and placed it under the administration of a [[proconsul]]. During the [[Diocletian#Reforms|Diocletian reforms]] of the late 3rd century, all of North Africa was placed into the newly created [[Diocese of Africa]], of which Tripolitania was a constituent province.\n\nAfter the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th century, Tripolitania changed hands between the [[Vandals]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]], until it was taken during the [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb]] in the 8th century. It was part of the region known to the Islamic world as [[Ifriqiya]], whose boundaries roughly mirrored those of the old Roman province of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa Proconsularis]]. Though nominally under the suzerainty of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], local dynasties such as the [[Aghlabids]] and later the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] were practically independent. The native [[Berbers]], who had inhabited the area locally for centuries before the arrival of the [[Arabs]], established their own native [[Hafsid dynasty]] over Ifriqiya in the 13th century, and would control the region until it was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 15th century, who established [[Ottoman Tripolitania]] as a distinct province.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Tripolitania.jpg|thumb|left|Detailed map of Tripolitania]]\n\nIn the old system, Tripolitania included [[Tripoli]], the capital city of Libya and a vast northwestern portion of the country; in the subsequent systems, the sha'biyah of Tripoli has become much smaller than the original Tripolitania, including merely the city of Tripoli and its immediate surroundings. Because the city and the sha'biyah are nowadays almost coextensive, the term \"Tripolitania\" has more historical than contemporary value. In Arabic the same word (\u0637\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0644\u0633) is used for both the city and the region, and that word, used alone, would be understood to mean only the city; in order to designate Tripolitania in Arabic, a qualifier such as \"state\", \"province\" or \"sha'biyah\" is required.\n\n== Administration ==\nThe system of [[Libya#Administrative divisions|administrative divisions]] that included Tripolitania was abolished in the early 1970s in favor of a system of smaller-size [[municipality|municipalities]] or ''[[baladiyah|baladiyat]]'' (singular ''baladiyah''). The baladiyat system was subsequently changed many times and has lately become the \"[[Sha'biyah|Sha'biyat]]\" system.

It then merged into ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comics.org/series/52861/|title=GCD :: Series :: Valiant and Smash!|website=www.comics.org}}</ref> But the ''Smash!'' Annual, published mainly under the Fleetway imprint, continued to appear every year: the final Annual, cover-dated 1976, was published in the autumn of 1975.\n\nDuring 1967 and 1968 ''Smash!'' was part of Odhams' [[Power Comics]] line (from #44 to #143), absorbing its sister titles ''[[Pow! (comics)|Pow!]]'' on 14 September 1968 (issue&nbsp;137) and ''[[Fantastic (comics)|Fantastic]]'' on 2 November 1968 (issue&nbsp;144). As ''Pow!'' and ''Fantastic'' had themselves already merged with ''[[Wham! (comics)|Wham!]]'' and ''[[Terrific (comics)|Terrific]]'' respectively, ''Smash!'' became the last survivor of the ''Power Comics''.\n\nUntil March 1969, alongside British humour strips, it included black-and-white reprints of superhero strips originally published in America by [[Marvel Comics]] and [[DC Comics|DC]]. The last of these, the ''[[Fantastic Four]]'', ended in issue&nbsp;162. Thereafter it featured solely British content: a mixture of humour, sporting and adventure strips.<ref name=\"lewstringer.blogspot.co.uk\">{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2008/01/crikey-its-another-hit-and-miss-issue.html|title=BLIMEY!

In 1963 Mirror Group was renamed International Publishing Corporation Ltd (IPC). The ''Fleetway'' name, a holdover from AP, was used to identify that part of IPC's comics publishing arm which derived from AP. In 1987, when the comics division was sold to Robert Maxwell, he continued to publish its comics under the ''Fleetway'' name.</ref> and [[Odhams Press|Odhams Press Ltd]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lookandlearn.com/history/Look-and-Learn-History.pdf|title=History of ''Look and Learn''}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Power Comics]] line, including ''Smash'', was published by Odhams under a three-man editorial team known as Alf, Bart and Cos. Alfred Wallace (\"Alf\") was the managing editor at Odhams, and Albert Cosser (\"Cos\") was the editor directly responsible for ''Smash''.<ref name=\"Career history of artist Ken Reid\">[http://www.fudge-the-elf.com/downloads/kenreid.doc Career history of artist Ken Reid] at DC Thomson and Odhams</ref><ref>Bart was the nickname of ''Eagle's'' Big Bartholemew</ref> Major changes of editorial policy occurred in 1969 for financial reasons, and again in 1970 when IPC was taken over by [[Albert Edwin Reed|Albert E Reed]] to form the publishing giant [[Reed Elsevier|Reed International]].<ref>[http://ketupa.net/elsevier2.htm Reed-Elsevier Group history] on Reed-Elsevier website</ref>\n\nLaunched on 5 February 1966, ''Smash'' became a Power Comic from December of that year with issue 44. The ''Power Comics'' logo, printed on the cover of each issue, was a gimmick dreamed up by Odhams to unify their five titles under a common banner. ''Smash'' remained part of that lineup for 100 issues; the logo was quietly dropped after #143 when the last of the other comics forming part of the lineup was cancelled (so that there was no longer a group of titles needing to be unified).\n\nThe other Power Comics were all ultimately absorbed into ''Smash'', which became the last survivor. On 14 September 1968, with issue 137, it merged with ''[[Pow! (comics)|Pow!]]'' (which had previously absorbed ''[[Wham! (comics)|Wham]]''), becoming ''Smash and Pow''.

Holiday Special in 1971.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1966 the initial success of ''Wham!'' (which had launched in 1964 and quickly built up strong circulation figures) encouraged Odhams' London management to publish a second title, conceived by Alf Wallace (Managing Editor of Odhams' juveniles \u2014 ''Eagle'', ''Swift'' and ''Boy's World'') and Albert Cosser.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984\">Interview with Leo Baxendale in ''British Comic World'' Issue #3 (June 1984)</ref> Leo Baxendale, who had created ''Wham!'' for Odhams in 1964, was too heavily embroiled with on-going production on it, providing much of the art for each issue, so had little time for anything else. Also, Baxendale was then still working at long range from Dundee.<ref>DC Thompson Ltd, Baxendale's former employers, were based in Dundee, Scotland</ref>\n\nAccordingly, it was Alf Wallace and Albert Cosser (soon to be known to their young audience as Alf and Cos) who determined the initial format of ''Smash!''. They also recruited the artists who would draw the early issues, as it was plain that Baxendale was fully occupied with the art for ''Wham!''. Baxendale's initial contribution to ''Smash'' was thus limited to providing a list of titles and situations for the humour strips, together with brief written scenarios (script ideas for the individual weekly issues), which he gave to Wallace to be farmed-out to other artists. ''The Swots and The Blots'' was one of these.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.4-5\">Interview with Leo Baxendale in ''British Comic World'' Issue #3 (June 1984),p.4-5</ref>\n\nBaxendale was asked only to create the ''Bad Penny'' strip, and to give ''Grimly Feendish'' (a character from his ''Eagle Eye, Junior Spy'' strip then running in ''Wham!'') a strip of his own. Wallace also had Baxendale draw the covers for the first three issues.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.4-5\"/>\n\n''Smash'' launched with the same format as the early issues of ''Wham'', namely 24 pages per issue, four of which were in colour. But it was printed on lower-quality paper than ''Wham''.\n\nThe initial line-up of strips mixed humour and adventure freely, with the comedic ''Ronnie Rich'' featuring on the cover of the first issue, inside which were adventure strips including the World War Two based ''Ghost Patrol'' \u2014 this latter a reprint strip which lasted only until issue 25. ''Ghost Patrol'' proved symptomatic of the problem with British adventure strips which plagued ''Smash'' during the Odhams years, which tended to be ''sloppy in presentation and possessed of little real character or emotion''.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.6\">Interview with Leo Baxendale in ''British Comic World'' Issue #3 (June 1984), p.6</ref>\n\nThe root of the problem with ''Smash'' was that it went through many changes in its early days \u2014 far too many. Particularly in its adventure strips: ''The Ghost Patrol'' came and went; ''The Legend Testers'' came and went; ''Moon Madness'' was particularly short-lived; and there were numerous others, equally forgettable. None proved popular enough to last.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.10</ref> Undeniably, none enjoyed the tremendous popularity of the American superhero strips which the comic would shortly feature, which genuinely had sufficient popularity to rival that of television.<ref>Marvel Comics as an independent UK publisher, in the 1970s, demonstrated that their superhero comics were capable of strong sales even in the face of competition from the newest rival -- colour television. ''Smash'' might have survived into that 1970s era of colour tv if it could have managed to retain its popular superhero strips.</ref>\n\nThose readers old enough to have become emotionally attached to comics before Odhams introduced American superhero strips to British readers tended to dislike those superhero strips.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.10</ref> Whereas, according to the letters pages each week, those same Marvel and DC heroes were enormously popular among the younger age group which had not been reading comics previously. Accordingly, ''Wham'' readers tended to resent the changes made in 1966, because British strips were cancelled in ''Wham'' and replaced with US superheroes, whereas ''Smash'' readers did not resent the superheroes, because in 1966 that comic had only just launched, so there were no real changes \u2014 ''Smash'' more or less teemed with American strips from the very beginning.\n\nThe decision, in 1969, to discontinue the American superhero strips was the real cause of the comic's demise. Other problems would contribute to the difficulties it subsequently faced \u2014 including strikes at its Printers \u2014 but the root cause of those problems was the falling circulation it suffered, which was a consequence of not having any unique elements to distinguish it from other IPC comics such as ''Lion'' and ''Valiant''. The key to understanding the situation is that the superheroes were the only element which genuinely had the necessary popularity to halt the decline in weekly sales caused by the competition from television.\n\n==Odhams Years==\n===Superheroes===\nBlack-and-white reprints of [[Marvel Comics]] strips<ref>All the Marvel stories were written by Stan Lee</ref> were introduced into ''Smash'' with issue&nbsp;16, when the ''[[Hulk|Incredible Hulk]]'' began.<ref>Issue 16 saw the first appearance of Marvel's ''[https://www.comics.org/series/25870/covers/?page=1 Incredible Hulk]'' strip, drawn by [[Jack Kirby]]</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2015/02/smash-first-20-covers.html|title=BLIMEY!

In July&nbsp;1967 ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]''<ref>Drawn at various times by Bill Everett, Wally Wood and Gene Colan</ref> replaced the Hulk, from issue&nbsp;76 onwards \u2014 ''Smash'' having exhausted all Hulk stories, from all sources, which had been published in the USA up to that time.\n\nIt's hard to overstate the significance of the introduction of ''The Hulk'', in the issue dated 21 May 1966. It was the first ''Marvel Comics'' strip featured by Odhams, the success of which led to the introduction of ''Fantastic Four'' into ''Wham'' on 6 August of that year, and to the launching of two entire comics entirely dedicated to Marvel superheroes \u2014 ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'' \u2014 in 1967. The Hulk's initial appearance in ''Smash'' took up a massive 6 pages, one-quarter of each 24 page issue, pushing fully five existing strips out of that issue, and causing the permanent cancellation of \"Space Jinx\" and \"Brian's Brain\" (although the latter would be revived much later).<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.11\">British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.11</ref>\n\nPrior to this, [[DC Comics|DC]]'s ''[[Batman (comic strip)|Batman]]'' had become the second American superhero to debut in ''Smash'', crashing onto the front cover of issue&nbsp;20 a month after the Hulk's debut, in re-edited reprints from American daily and Sunday newspaper strips: these were credited in-page to ''Batman'' creator Bob Kane, but were actually drawn by [[Al Plastino]] and ghost-written by [[Whitney Ellsworth]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comics.org/issue/368494/|title=GCD :: Issue :: Smash! #75|website=www.comics.org}}</ref> This was a response to the sudden and enormous popularity of the ''Batman'' television series starring Adam West. The impact of this hit TV show led to the ''Batman'' strip retaining the front cover of ''Smash'', in colour, for better than a year and a half, entitled ''Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder''.\n\nInitially, this syndicated newspaper strip adopted the camp style of the Adam West television series, with appearances by humorous guest stars such as American funnyman [[Jack Benny]]. In the later part of the run (which featured serious, rather than camp, stories) Batgirl, too, appeared in the strip, a response to her addition to the TV show in its 3rd season: in the newspaper strip, Batman initially believed her to be a criminal rather than a crime fighter. Superman then co-starred in the strip, which was retitled ''Superman and Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder'', as Batman and Robin attempt to save Superman from the diabolical Professor Zinkk who was secretly poisoning him with kryptonite.\n\nThe expansion of the American content, with the arrival of ''Batman'', meant the loss of two more of the initial British strips: the adventure strip ''The Ghost Patrol'', and the cartoon strip ''The Tellybugs''.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.11\"/>\n\nIn September 1968 the ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' began a six-month run in ''Smash'', when it absorbed ''Pow'' (which had previously merged with ''Wham'', in which the strip had initially featured). As one of only a handful of ''Pow'' strips to survive the merger, it was used to lure ''Pow'' readers to the new comic. The strip was introduced to readers of ''Smash'' with the wedding of Reed and Sue from ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #3. Their adventures continued with ''Defeated by the Frightful Four'', and ran through to ''Lo There Shall Be an Ending'', which was the final Marvel strip to appear in ''Smash''.\n\n''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' began a short run in November 1968 when ''Smash'' absorbed ''Fantastic''. The stories, continued from ''Fantastic'', began with ''The Ringmaster's Circus of Crime''. When the Marvel strips were discontinued the following spring, the final ''Thor'' reprint had a new ending substituted, in a rushed attempt to resolve a continuing sub-plot.\n\nThe financial crisis which overtook Odhams in 1968, resulting in the closure of all the other ''Power Comics'', also caused them to give up the expensive licence to reprint the Marvel superhero stories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/m/marvuk.htm|title=Marvel UK|website=www.internationalhero.co.uk}}</ref> This decision took effect in March&nbsp;1969, when the licence came up for renewal; the final Marvel strips appeared in issue&nbsp;162. The expensive ''Batman'' newspaper strip had already been discontinued, ending in issue&nbsp;157.\n\n===Odhams Humour Strips===\nThere were typically a dozen British humour strips in each of the first 162 issues.\n\nThe initial line-up starred ''The Man From B.U.N.G.L.E.'', which usually occupied the front cover prior to issue&nbsp;20,<ref>''Smash'': [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2015/02/smash-first-20-covers.html The first 20 covers]</ref> supported by seven other long-running humour strips (''Charlie's Choice'',<ref name=\"Brian Lewis\">Drawn by [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html Brian Lewis]</ref> ''Bad Penny'',<ref name=\"Leo Baxendale\">Drawn by [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html Leo Baxendale]</ref> ''Percy's Pets'',<ref>Drawn by [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html Stan McMurtry]</ref> ''The Nervs'',<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html|title=BLIMEY!

It is unclear why Alf and Cos chose this deeply unfunny strip for what must have been considered the pride of place in the new comic. ''Space Jinx'' was primarily another ''Jonah'' (a strip by Ken Reid which had run in ''The Beano''), except that it could not hold its own against the brilliance of Reid's sea-faring twit. Where ''Jonah'' dealt with sinking ships of the sea, Brian Lewis's ''Space Jinx'' dealt with similar situations in outer space, but (in practice) without the necessary degree of humour.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.7\">British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.7</ref>\n\nKen Reid's ''Queen of the Seas'' would last only slightly longer, at 43 issues. A masterpiece of comic artistry, telling the story of the ''Buoyant Queen'' and its two-man crew, Enoch and Bert, a pair of oafs with a love/hate relationship (mostly hate!), it was perhaps too intelligent for its target audience \u2014 its disappearance was a great loss to the comic.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.7\"/> Many readers failed to understand, amongst many things in the strip that went clear over their heads, that the two main characters were drawn in the likeness of comedians [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Oliver Hardy]], and that the strip's humour was based on the movies of Laurel & Hardy.\n\nAfter only five months \u2013 foreshadowing many, many reshuffles to come \u2013 ''Smash!'' underwent its first major overhaul: from issue&nbsp;20 the ''Batman'' newspaper strip took over the front cover, whilst ''Grimly Feendish'' lost the colour back cover to Reid's ''Queen of the Seas'' (which shrank from its original two pages each week to only a single page \u2014 the loss of the extra page was a drawback, but was compensated for by the strip now having a more prestigious location in the comic, and of course by now being in colour).\n\nFurther cover changes would follow. When, after two years, the popularity of the ''Batman'' television series eventually faded, from issue&nbsp;114 onward Batman and Robin were moved to the inside pages, yielding the front cover to the long-running success ''The Swots and the Blots'', at this point still being drawn by Mike Lacey, a humour strip in which two rival gangs vied to outwit each other at Pond Road School, with \"Teach\" caught in the crossfire. Its origins lay in Baxendale's classroom-based strip ''The Tiddlers'', which had then been running for 2 years in ''Wham''<ref>In fact it was a direct continuation of ''[https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2015/04/21/wham/ The Tiddlers]'', with only a change of name. The characters (i.e. \"Teach\" and the Blots), school buildings, and situations, were all largely as they had been in ''The Tiddlers''. The only difference was the addition of the Swots, so that Teach now had an ally.</ref> (and which continued in ''Pow'' when ''Wham'' merged with it in 1968, where it was combined with ''The Dolls of St Dominics'' to become ''The Tiddlers and The Dolls'').\n\n''The Swots and the Blots'' was one of the few strips in ''Smash'' to survive all the changes of 1969 and 1970, reaching a new standard of excellence when [[Leo Baxendale]] began drawing it for the new-look ''Smash'' from March 1969, but even during the Odhams years it had wit and a sense of style. In Baxendale's hands it had notable similarities to his earlier classroom-based strip, ''The Bash Street Kids'', in ''[[The Beano]]''.<ref>Around 1968, Baxendale quit Odhams for the better paying ''Fleetway'' comics. One of the strips he produced there was ''[http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2017/07/leo-baxendales-big-chief-pow-wow.html Big Chief Pow Wow]'' for ''Buster''\u2014the strip ran from 14 September 1968 to 31 January 1970 (some issues were fill-ins by other artists).</ref>\n\n''The Man from BUNGLE'', spoofing the popular TV series ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'', was a spin-off from Baxendale's ''Eagle-Eye Junior Spy'' strip in ''Wham''. BUNGLE was a secret spy organisation in Britain, organised along more chaotic lines than UNCLE, featuring a secret agent who employed a wide variety of hugely unlikely gadgets in his fight against his humorous opponents. Baxendale himself drew the first few editions, which appeared as large single illustrations on some of the early covers of ''Smash'', after which Mike Lacey took over.\n\nThe second spin-off from Baxendale's ''Eagle-Eye'' strip was ''[[Grimly Feendish]]'' (subtitled ''The Rottenest Crook in the World''), which Leo Baxendale himself drew. Feendish had been the most popular character in the earlier strip, thanks to his ghoulish appearance, which was based on Uncle Fester in the American television series ''[[The Addams Family]]'' (and, presumably, on Charles Adams' illustrations from which the TV series was derived).<ref>Interestingly, the strip would probably have been ''banned'' if this had been an American comic, as the [[Comics Code Authority]] prohibited presentation of crime in comics if it tended to create sympathy for the criminal, and this strip appears to fall foul of that restriction.</ref> The new strip at one point occupied a prestigious position, as the full-colour back cover feature each week, and survived throughout the entire run of 162 issues published by Odhams (even though, after giving up its cover status, it was sometimes ignominiously reduced to only a quarter-page \"filler\").\n\n''Bad Penny'' was another memorable Baxendale creation. Its title logo featured a portrait of Penny herself, alongside the 'Bad Penny' caption, and an illustration of a giant pre-decimal One Penny coin (the coin suggesting the connection with the proverb from which the character's name originated).\n\nShe had some similarities with Baxendale's earlier Minnie the Minx character in ''The Beano''. When he had been drawing Minnie, he had concentrated on experimenting with facial expressions and character traits. By the time he began working on ''Bad Penny'' his drawing style had matured, with an equal concentration on developing a zany but tight storyline, less emphasis on close-ups of facial expressions, but retaining the essentials needed to put over a character's own personality traits.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.6\"/>\n\nBad Penny was so popular that she survived the changes of 1969, and continued to appear in the new ''Smash''. When the strip was eventually dropped, in 1970, Bad Penny herself still continued to appear, albeit infrequently, making occasional appearances in Baxendale's ''The Swots and the Blots'' as a new member of the Blots.\n\nAs had happened in ''Wham'', artists such as Mike Lacey were commissioned from time to time to \"ghost\" Baxendale's style. Baxendale was allowed to sign his early work on ''Smash'', so there is a way to distinguish which strips he personally drew during his time at Odhams.<ref name=\"The Power Comics: Wham!\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817075207/http://26pigs.com/wham/index.html|title=26Pigs.com : UK Comics : Wham!|date=17 August 2018|website=web.archive.org}}</ref><ref>In practice, Baxendale signed very few of his strips, so it is quite difficult to tell which are his and which are other artists substituting for him.</ref> After he transferred to Fleetway, another IPC subsidiary, he still contributed strips to ''Smash'', but now worked \"undercover\", i.e. without signing them. He explained this in his autobiography, ''A Very Funny Business'' (Duckworth, 1978, page&nbsp;91): \"I was in a delightful situation. Working under my own name, a lot was expected of me. Publishers ''expected'' me to cram my drawings with funny detail. A double standard operated. Working undercover, I was able to reduce the layouts to the simplest terms. Backgrounds were minimal or non-existent \u2014 just a horizon line. And there was no ancillary comic detail \u2014 just the characters acting out the story line against an empty backdrop.\"\n\nThe most bizarre of the Odhams humour strips was ''The Nervs'', depicting a group of little characters inhabiting a schoolboy called Fatty: the strip showed them running Fatty like a group of workers running a factory. Allocated two pages, it followed the same formula as the strip ''Georgie's Germs'' from ''Wham!''. Fatty was aptly named, with the tiny Nervs battling to save the fat twerp's stomach from its numerous overloads, as a minute never passed which was free from him guzzling!\n\nDrawn for the majority of its run by Graham Allen,<ref name=\"auto2\"/> in its final months during 1968-69 [[Ken Reid (comics artist)|Ken Reid]]<ref>Comics artist [http://britishcomicart.blogspot.com/search/label/Ken%20Reid Ken Reid]</ref> \u2014 previously of ''Queen of the Seas'', and who had earlier contributed the ''Dare-a-Day Davy''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crazedchimp.co.uk/dadd.htm|title=Ken Reid's Dare A Day Davy|website=www.crazedchimp.co.uk}}</ref> strip to ''Pow'' \u2014 drew this double-page feature.\n\nReid's career had begun at ''The Beano'' in the 1950s, but for Odhams he had already produced the long running success ''Frankie Stein'', in ''Wham!'', before taking on ''Queen of the Seas'' in the early issues of ''Smash!'' and the  ''Dare-A-Day Davy'' strip in ''Pow!''.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.7\"/> He turned ''The Nervs'' into an extremely surreal, even visceral, strip; achieving a rare level of hilarity and bawdiness, in a subversive presentation of comical horror \u2014 and in the process alarming IPC's management !<ref name=\"Career history of artist Ken Reid\"/>\n\nHe already had some degree of notoriety, as being the only Odhams artist whose work so disturbed the management that it was actually banned.<ref>[http://www.savoy.abel.co.uk/HTML/weird1.html Review] of the banned ''Dare-A-Day Davy'' Frankenstein strip</ref><ref>''Dare-A-Day Davy'' [http://www.savoy.abel.co.uk/HTML/picts2.html Frankenstein strip], published in ''Weird Fantasy''&nbsp;#1 in 1969</ref> At the suggestion of Vance Gledhill of Blackpool, Davy was dared to dig up Frankenstein's monster (in the ''Dare-A-Day Davy'' strip) and bring him back to life \u2013 for which Reid decided to employ the \"kiss of life\"!

This was a device for featuring, as guest stars in the strip each week, an assortment of popular TV stars. The strip's debut appearance, for instance, featured Robert Vaughn and David McCallum, stars of top-rated secret agent show ''The Man From UNCLE'', maximising their appearance by splashing them across the front cover. It was hoped that by bringing popular television stars into its pages, this would make TV's growing popularity work ''for'' the comic \u2014 a not very subtle ploy to boost its circulation and sales.\n\n''Sammy Shrink'' (subtitled ''The Smallest Boy in the World'')<ref name=\"auto3\"/> was a humour strip about a boy who was only two inches tall. Sammy had the most successful \u2014 but also the most chequered \u2014 career of all the characters featured in ''Smash'', having originated in ''Wham'', then moved to ''Pow'' when they merged, arriving in ''Smash'' when it in turn absorbed ''Pow'', and would subsequently be revived in ''Knockout'', finally ending his career in ''Whizzer and Chips'' when it absorbed ''Knockout'' in June&nbsp;1973.\n\n''Ronnie Rich'' featured the richest kid in the world, who stands to inherit a fortune if only he can get rid of the money he's got. Drawn by Gordon Hogg,<ref name=\"auto2\"/> each week Ronnie spent his every last penny, in some reckless or extravagant way, only to have his scheme backfire and make him richer than ever. He never did get his hands on the fortune.\n\nOften a half-page feature, ''Percy's Pets'' drawn by Stan McMurtry (alias Mac)<ref>Comics artist [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1040731/Macs-secret-lady-Britains-cartoonist-reveals-hidden-images-wife.html Stan McMurtry]</ref> was popular enough to go on to make sporadic reappearances from time to time in the new ''Smash'' after March&nbsp;1969. Percy was a small plump schoolboy, who filled his family's home with his exotic collection of pets. These included (from time to time) an elephant, a giraffe, a hippopotamus, a snake, an ape \u2014 in fact almost every type of animal that might be found in a typical zoo \u2014 together with a parrot, a tortoise, a white mouse, and a hedgehog; thereby causing a predictable degree of comical chaos for his long suffering mum and dad.\n\nSome of the best-remembered strips were not included in all of the first 162 issues: a number of them were only acquired in #137, from the merger with ''Pow!'' (which had already absorbed the most popular strips running in ''Wham!'').\n\nOne such acquisition from ''Pow!'' was ''The Cloak''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crazedchimp.co.uk/cloak.htm|title=Mike Higgs' The Cloak|website=www.crazedchimp.co.uk}}</ref> \u2014 like ''The Man From BUNGLE'', another humorous secret agent strip. The Cloak was the top agent for Britain's Special Squad, nominally a part of Scotland Yard; but he usually operated from his personal headquarters, known as the Secret Sanctum. His ingenuity and never-ending supply of gadgets and secret weapons gave him the edge over his somewhat odd enemies (some were ''very'' odd, including Deathshead and various other agents of G.H.O.U.L.).\n\nHe had some equally odd colleagues. Assisted initially by Mole (the tall one with the bald head, big nose and specs) and Shortstuff (the short squirt with the hairy nut and big eyeballs), he then began having adventures in which he found himself also alongside the sexy and flirtatious Lady Shady, the shady lady. The strip benefited from the unusual, idiosyncratic drawing style of Mike Higgs, whose overt inclusion of pop culture imagery made the strip seem extremely modern.\n\n''Wiz War'', drawn by Mike Brown, had also begun in ''Pow!'', and would be one of a handful of strips to survive the changes of 1969. Brown seems to have been unaware of the house rule banning artists from signing their work, as the strip often bore his name. The \"War\" in the title referred to a feud between two wizards, Wizard Prang and his enemy Demon Druid. Being a humour strip, the editorial staff allowed the hero the very silly name of Wizard Prang, a piece of RAF slang from the Second World War.\n\nOther than the fact that Prang was robed entirely in white, befitting his status as the good guy, and Demon Druid was always in black, being the villain of the piece, their costumes were quite similar - a flowing wizard's robe with stars on, and a pointed hat. They would fly around on broomsticks, zapping each other with spells: which turned the other into a toad, or something equally amusing. Wizard Prang was alternately helped and hindered by Englebert, his pet bird. The best feature of the strip was the sign above Wizard Prang's front door. This usually read \"Wizard Prang is... In\" (if he was at home) or \"Wizard Prang is... Out\" (if he was out and about); but if he'd had a bad time in the story, the sign would often make a humorous remark in the final panel, such as \"Wizard Prang is... All At Sea\".\n\nThe secret of Mike Brown, unacknowledged for many years, was that Leo Baxendale needed to earn money from Odhams without disclosing to Fleetway that he was now working for both companies. Accordingly, Baxendale now pencilled the drawings, and Brown, who was a cartoon film animator, inked them in. In this way, they turned out together large numbers of ''Bad Penny'' and ''Grimly Feendish'' strips, which they sold to Odhams under Brown's name \u2014 a situation Baxendale referred to, in his 1978 autobiography, as working ''undercover''.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984),p.10</ref>\n\nLost in the merger with ''Pow'' were ''Charlie's Choice'', ''Ronnie Rich'' and ''The Man From BUNGLE''. Also lost in this merger, in effect, was Ken Reid's ''Dare-A-Day Davey'' strip, one of several established features in ''Pow'' which were dropped instead of transferring to ''Smash''.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.15</ref>\n\n===Odhams Adventure Strips===\n\nAs ''Smash'' was essentially a superhero and humour comic during the Odhams years, there were few traditional adventure strips in it; but a handful do bear special mention.\n\nThere were various well-remembered adventure strips in the first hundred issues, including some which were quite outstanding, such as ''Rubberman'', ''Experiment X'', ''The Legend Testers'', and ''The Python''.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nFrom issue 144 in November 1968 ''Smash'' was the only surviving ''Power Comic'', as this was the issue in which ''Smash and Pow'' (as it then was) merged with ''Fantastic''. Five British adventure serials were introduced in this issue, to plug the gap left by the loss of the withdrawn American superhero strips which had been major features of the four closed titles.\n\n''At Night Stalks... The Spectre'' is an adventure strip in which a crime reporter on the Daily Globe newspaper is apparently killed while investigating a news story. The world believes newspaperman Jim Jordan is dead, but he still carries on his crusade against crime... calling himself The Spectre.\n\nHe is now fighting crime, rather than merely reporting it, using an array of gadgets which make it seem he is the ghost of the missing reporter. Hence his opponents are terrified to find that if they shoot him he doesn't die (a bullet-proof raincoat was the trick here). And he has a secret underground hideout beneath the statue erected in his memory, from which he would covertly and unexpectedly emerge, or disappear into, under cover of an artificial fog, to give the impression he was coming and going from the spirit world. His first case began in issue&nbsp;144, in which he tracks down Black Murdo, the racketeer who the world believes had murdered him.\n\n''Destination Danger'', a motor racing serial, also began in issue&nbsp;144. This strip was about a feud between a young English racing driver, Jeff Jackson, who was working for Puma Motors in the US, and his enemy Vic Stafford, the Puma team's chief driver, who has taken a bribe to throw a forthcoming race.\n\nAlthough new to ''Smash'', the old-fashioned artwork in the strips ''At Night Stalks... The Spectre'' and ''Destination Danger'' marked them out as reprints. The use of reprints was a cost-cutting measure, indicating the straightened financial circumstances of ''Smash'' at this point \u2013 if any evidence were needed beyond the closure of all four of the other ''Power Comics''.\n\n''Laird of the Apes'' was a science fiction strip, milking the popularity of the big budget Charlton Heston motion picture ''Planet of the Apes'' which was released earlier that year. In the strip, set in the 18th century, a young Scottish laird returns to the Highlands to aid his outlaw clansmen in their struggle with the English Redcoats, bringing with him a band of highly trained Apes.\n\nAn adventure strip with a sporting theme was the wrestling serial ''King of the Ring'', featuring Ken King, who was a champion of the grunt-'n'-grapple game (although in the earliest strips he had begun as a boxer). As was not exactly uncommon in the Odhams years, there was a tendency to give the characters very silly names. The most outrageous example in this strip was King's manager, who (in spite of ''not'' being Irish) was called Blarney Stone!\n\nBlarney's real name was originally Tim Stone, and Blarney was only a nickname; but this was soon forgotten. In order to fulfil Ken's ambition to travel, Blarney agrees to manage him on a world tour, if he'll agree to fight his way round the world!\n\nThe fifth adventure strip added was ''Brian's Brain'', drawn by Bert Vandeput,<ref name=\"auto2\"/> a serial with science fiction elements, continued from ''Pow''. This featured two schoolboys: the eponymous Brian and his friend Duffy Rolls. Brian Kingsley possessed an electronic Brain resembling a human skull, which he carried about in a box. It could communicate with him telepathically, glowing when active; and it could control the actions of animals if they were within a few yards, which was the limit of its brain-wave transmissions.\n\nAll five strips commenced in issue&nbsp;144; and all were serials, with cliff-hanger endings each week.\n\n===The Closure of the ''Power Comics''===\nWhat must always be born in mind is that, in the comics industry, the 1960s were not the 1930s. With the advent in Britain of commercial television, in 1955 \u2014 displacing the staid, old-fashioned children's television offered by the BBC up to that point \u2014 the ever-increasing competition from the ''boob-tube'' began a continuous (and accelerating) decline in comics circulation. Throughout the 1960s, in consequence, the circulation wars fought in the comics publishing industry were fought out against a backdrop of ever-declining circulation figures.\n\nFollowing the initial success of ''Wham'' in 1964, Odhams had launched four more [[Power Comics]] during 1966 and '67, including ''Smash'', only to close them in quick succession: merging each in turn into the survivors until by 1969 only ''Smash'' remained. Whereas 1968 began with all five ''Power Comics'' apparently flourishing, by the year's end only ''Smash'' was still being published.<ref name=\"The Power Comics: Wham!\"/> Even the sleepiest of readers began to notice that something was seriously wrong, as the increasingly frantic series of mergers resulted in ever more ludicrous titles, culminating in the astonishing ''Smash and Pow incorporating Fantastic'' (commonly spoofed as ''Smash, Pow, Wham, incorporating Fantastic and Terrific'').\n\nThe question is why, in a limited market such as the UK, they took such a big risk as to launch five titles (which in hindsight looks an unwise decision by the Odhams management), if it was so quickly obvious that the market could only support one? It has been suggested<ref name=\"lewstringer.blogspot.co.uk\"/> that it was common practice for a publisher to quickly clone a successful title, in order to forestall its competitors from doing so. That does not seem to be the case here. The comic's only distinctive feature was its American superhero strips, so ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'' (which most of the time contained ''only'' Marvel superhero strips) might loosely be described as clones of ''Smash'', even though they lacked any humour strips; but IPC had an ''exclusive'' licence from Marvel Comics to reprint Marvel's strips in the UK, which precluded anyone else from doing so.\n\nThe actual answer lies in the unexpected nature of the economic crisis of 1968 that hit the British economy, resulting in the devaluation of the Pound.<ref>In Britain, the devaluation crisis was major news due to certain ill-judged remarks by Prime Minister Harold Wilson, who would be mocked for the rest of his career for his infamous falsehood, ''This will not affect the Pound in your pocket!''</ref> The economic chaos began with a Sterling crisis in Britain in 1967, leading to devaluation in the November. There then followed a crisis for the U.S. dollar in March&nbsp;1968 which had a cascade effect on the international economic system, sending first the French franc and then the West German deutschmark into devaluation, and culminating in a ''new'' Sterling crisis in Britain in November&nbsp;1968.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2170396 ''The Economic Crisis of 1968''] \u2013 published in ''American Historical Review''</ref><ref>Article, [http://www.wsws.org/articles/2005/dec2005/mccar-d30.shtml ''Eugene McCarthy \u2013 pivotal role in 1968 Political Crisis'']</ref>\n\nThese repeated falls in the value of the Pound against the U.S. dollar significantly increased the cost of publishing the American strips, which had to be paid for in dollars, and raised the daunting spectre of further increases if the Pound fell in value yet again. Increasing the cover price of the ''Power Comics'' to compensate was impossible because of stiff competition (with sales on a sharp downward spiral, as circulation fell victim to the ever increasing popularity of television); so the fall in the value of Sterling made the American strips unaffordable.\n\nThe toughness of the competition is apparent from examining other contemporary titles.<ref>Cover galleries on the [https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/ British Comics] website</ref> The first issue of its stablemate ''Fantastic'', published in February 1967, cost 9d for 40 pages (due to its very high content of American superhero strips), a cover price which forced ''Fantastic'' to close within 18 months. ''Terrific'', having the same high content of American material, also had a high cover price of 9d, and closed even quicker.\n\nIn contrast, the comics ''Dandy'' and ''Beano'' published by the rival [[D. C. Thomson & Co.|DC Thomson]] organisation sold at a cover price of 3d. ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'' cost three times as much, which (even with double the number of pages compared to many DC Thomson titles) proved unsustainable. This is not surprising, given that ''Wham'' and ''Pow'' each peaked at a cover price of 7d, and even that proved unsustainable.\n\n''Smash'' had launched in February&nbsp;1966 with a cover price of 7d for 24&nbsp;pages. By March&nbsp;1969, although its cover price had not changed, circumstances had conspired to increase its page count, such that each issue now contained 36&nbsp;pages. In fact the page count jumped overnight from 24 pages to 36 pages (a fifty percent increase), with a consequent sharp rise in production costs, and so a marked decline in profit-per-copy.\n\nThe tipping point was issue 144, in which ''Smash'', ''Pow'' and ''Fantastic'' were merged into a single title. The recently created ''Smash and Pow'' lost its ''Daredevil'' and ''Spider-Man'' strips, which together had comprised a full third of each 24 page issue, but now had to accommodate both ''Thor'' and ''Fantastic Four'' from the discontinued titles, plus a whole slew of new British adventure strips (which were being added in preparation for the comic's impending transition to solely-British content).\n\nAll this could not be achieved within the standard ''Smash'' format of 24 pages. So IPC now \"bit the bullet\" and increased the page count, at a single bound, by fifty percent \u2014 a necessity if they were to achieve their intention of reproducing with ''Smash'' the successful formula which was buoying-up sales of their most popular titles, ''Lion'' and ''Valiant'', both of which were 36-pagers (in effect, to produce another clone of them: an identical mix of adventure and humour, with an identical page count, at an identical price).\n\nOne fundamental difficulty for the ''Power Comics'', however, was always the stark economic truth that a kid could buy both ''The Dandy'' and ''The Beano'', at 3d each, and still have change left over, for what it cost to buy ''Smash!'', ''Wham!'' or ''Pow!'' at 7d each. However, the DC Thomson titles only had 16 pages, and this more than anything drove up the page count in ''Smash!'', from its original 24 pages to 36 pages, and eventually to 40 pages in 1970 (i.e. it might be more than double the price of a DC Thomson title but it was also more than double the size).<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.9</ref> The difficulty was that the much lower price of ''The Dandy'' and ''The Beano'' gave those titles a significant advantage, since a kid could choose to buy only one of them, at 3d \u2014 a winning competitive advantage which, as of 1966, would keep both of the DC Thomson titles afloat for more than 30 years to come.\n\nThe highly competitive nature of the UK's publishing industry meant margins were thin: a minimum number of sales each week were needed to reach break-even point, and the lower the cover price, the greater was the number of sales needed to reach that point; but the higher the cover price, the fewer were the number of sales that could actually be achieved.\n\nThe juvenile readers (or their parents) might be able to afford two or three comics a week, but by publishing five ''Power Comics'' IPC were pricing themselves out of the market. For the situation in Britain was not like that in America, where, with comics published just once a month, a child might afford five titles. In Britain, comics were published weekly.\n\nUnder those conditions the ''Power Comics'' were effectively competing with each other \u2014 a factor IPC were certainly aware of, as the letters pages in ''Smash'', in 1968, actually carried readers' complaints that they couldn't afford all five ''Power'' titles. The five together cost an astonishing three shillings and threpence a week (39d), to buy them all, far beyond the reach of the average child's weekly pocket money.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.13</ref>\n\nThe ''Power Comics'' were also competing with IPC's other titles, including [[Lion (comics)|Lion]], [[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]] and [[Buster (comics)|Buster]], potentially dragging the Group's entire line into bankruptcy. Rationalisation, by closing some of the titles, would produce an overall benefit, as it would dramatically cut IPC's production costs. Although it would mean fewer titles, as IPC's comics were actually competing against each other it ought to result in better sales for the survivors. In theory, there would be no overall loss of sales or revenue, provided readers switched from the closing titles to surviving IPC ones (rather than to rival [[D. C. Thomson & Co.|DC Thomson]] ones).\n\nAnother factor Odhams had not anticipated was the distribution of American comic books within the UK. Although this had always been a consideration, the volume of such comics arriving in Britain had traditionally been small, and their distribution haphazard. In 1968, distribution and quantity suddenly underwent a marked improvement: in America, Marvel Comics' owner, Martin Goodman, pulled off a business coup that overnight freed Marvel from a restrictive distribution agreement, which for a decade had limited it to publishing only 8 titles a month: Marvel was suddenly quadrupeling its monthly output, and dozens of new titles were flooding into Britain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://emagazinepdf.com/2017/05/marvel_comics_-_the_untold_story/|title=''Marvel Comics \u2014 The Untold Story'', Sean Howe (2012)}}</ref> Odhams' black-and-white [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] reprints in their ''Power Comics'' range suddenly faced much more extensive competition from four-colour Marvel originals, and this began to harm sales.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2009/03/40-year-flashback-smash-regenerates.html|title=BLIMEY! The Blog of British Comics: 40 Year Flashback: SMASH! regenerates|first=Lew|last=Stringer|date=8 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn the turbulent economic conditions, any part of IPC's business which was loss-making had no future. Standard industry practice was to close a comic or magazine if its revenues dipped ''towards'' the break-even point; publishers did not wait for a title to actually incur losses.<ref name=\"lewstringer.blogspot.co.uk\"/> Hence, merely to anticipate losses on the other four titles (''Pow'', ''Wham'', ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'') was enough to doom them. And the closures represented a major cost-cutting exercise, reducing the ongoing production costs on the ''Power Comics'' line by four-fifths.\n\nAs for actual losses incurred due to the sudden and unexpected nature of the problem, and the inability to quickly terminate the long-term contracts with the Americans, ''Smash'' as sole survivor couldn't hope to generate enough income on its own to meet these. In fact it didn't need to. The fortunate circumstance that the ''Power Comics'' were all published by Odhams Press Ltd, a subsidiary company with limited liability, meant that it was possible to ring-fence all debts on the Odhams publications within that one company, thus preventing any losses affecting the rest of the IPC Group (since IPC's other titles were all published by other IPC subsidiaries). Accordingly, with effect from 1 January 1969 ''Smash'' was transferred to IPC Magazines Ltd, a new IPC subsidiary formed during 1968,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comics.org/publisher/1946/|title=GCD :: Publisher :: IPC|website=www.comics.org}}</ref> leaving Odhams with no continuing titles, and ''Smash'' started again from scratch.<ref>[http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk//companysearch?disp=1&frfsh=1414205283&#result Odhams Press Ltd] continued in being until 7 January 1998, when it changed its name to Formpart (No.11) Limited, which still exists today; currently a dormant private company.</ref>\n\nDespite being the longest survivor, and inheriting many popular strips from the other four titles, ''Smash'' was only a limited success. It was plainly on shakey ground: for, hard on the heels of the closure of the other titles, in the spring of 1969 IPC quickly made extensive changes to it, dropping the last remaining Marvel superhero strips, to shed the expense of the licensing fee for using them (having already dropped ''Batman''), and ending many other strips too.\n\nIn consequence of the decision to discontinue the American reprints, as each ''Power Comic'' closed its superhero strips were given up. Only in the case of ''Fantastic'', where the existing contract with Marvel had some months to run, were those strips transferred to its replacement, the merged ''Smash incorporating Fantastic'', until the contract expired in March&nbsp;1969.\n\n''Smash'' then introduced a new cover feature, new strips, and free gifts. In all but name it was a new comic. Even so, it required yet another major shakeup 12 months later, in the spring of 1970, when further changes of editorial policy were imposed by new owners Reed International, who had bought out IPC that year. This resulted, among other things, in the dropping of the newly introduced ''Warriors of the World'' cover feature in favour of a new lead serial: an adventure series entitled ''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test''.\n\nWithin the British market, boys' comics for the age group which was too old for titles such as ''Beano'', ''Dandy'' and ''Sparky'' tended to focus around adventure, sport and war (in titles such as ''Lion'' and ''Valiant''), or humour (in titles such as ''Buster''). In abandoning its superheroes, ''Smash'' sought to attract readers of both types, by offering traditional adventure as well as humour.\n\nTo place these changes in context, the ''Power Comics'' were not the only casualties of the turmoil at IPC in 1969. Hulton's long-running adventure comic ''Eagle'' was also cancelled, merging with Fleetway's ''Lion'' from 2 May 1969. The merged comic was known briefly as ''Lion and Eagle'', but quickly reverted simply to ''Lion''. The humour comic, ''Giggle'', aimed at the slightly younger market dominated by Fleetway's ''Buster'', was also dropped, being merged into ''Buster'' in the spring of 1969 to form ''Buster and Giggle''. As ever, the name change lasted only long enough to absorb the discontinued comic's readership: the reference to ''Giggle'' failed to see out the year, and by December the title had reverted to simply ''Buster'' once more.<ref>''Buster'' [https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2018/10/29/buster-60s/ cover gallery] at Wordpress.com</ref> And ''Buster'', like ''Smash'', also now became a publication of the Group's newest subsidiary, IPC Magazines Ltd.\n\nThe surviving titles at both Odhams and at Fleetway were now transferred to a merged operation, at New Year 1969, as merely a part of IPC's newest division, IPC Magazines Ltd, and were placed under the responsibility of Jack Legrand, formerly the Managing Editor of Fleetway's juvenile publications.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.17</ref>\n\nA notable feature of the Odhams years was how few advertisements the comic carried. There were occasional quarter-page inserts, mainly advertising foreign Postage Stamps for stamp collectors, or Subbuteo table-football; but they were few and far between, and their combined total didn't usually exceed one page per issue. Reflecting its financial problems, the relaunched comic under IPC Magazines carried a significantly greater amount of advertising. One obvious change was the back cover (the only in-colour page apart from the front cover), which gradually began to carry colourful full-page advertisements. On the inside pages, too, there was a much more noticeable quantity of adverts: each issue typically carried 4 full-page ads, plus two half-page ads. It was a noticeable feature of the relaunch that the comic now expanded to 40 pages, in order to cope with the need to carry an extra 4 pages of advertising in each issue.<ref>Cover galleries on the [https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2019/04/13/smash/ British Comics] website</ref>\n\nThis was a potentially significant new strategy, and a major change of policy. No longer did the profitability of the comic rest exclusively with the income derived from its sales figures. That sales income was now supplemented by advertising revenue, and without even having to sacrifice any significant amount of page space, nor cancel any strips, thanks to adding the additional pages.\n\n===Turmoil in 1967===\nThe events of 1968 were not even the first threat to the survival of the ''Power Comics''. Odhams had faced their first serious crisis in May 1967.\nThe editorial page warned readers in issue 68 that ''Smash'', initially printed by St Clements Press Ltd of London, had to find new printers within one month, or face closure. In the event, Odhams were able to sign a contract with Southernprint Ltd of Poole in Dorset in time to maintain publication.\n\n==''SMASH'' after Odhams==\n\nIn January 1969 Odhams ceased to exist as a publishing imprint, and ''Smash'' now became an IPC Magazines publication. Most of the consequences of the change didn't become apparent until the issue cover-dated 15 March, in which the comic changed dramatically. IPC had waited three months to relaunch ''Smash'', because, on the one hand, it needed some lead-time in which to ready new strips, and, on the other, in the publishing industry Spring was traditionally considered a good time to launch a new (in this case, a virtually new) comic.<ref name=\"lewstringer.blogspot.co.uk\"/>\n\nWith the re-launch, ''Smash'' became the last ever British comic to feature a variety mix of adventure, humour and sports themed stories. Subsequent boys' comics featured exclusively sports, or war, or humour; such as ''[[Scorcher (magazine)|Scorcher and Score]]'' and ''[[Shoot (football magazine)|Shoot]]'' (which featured only soccer), and ''[[Action (comics)|Action]]'' and ''[[Battle Picture Weekly|Battle]]'' (which featured only war stories).<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817075250/http://26pigs.com/smash/index.html|title=26Pigs.com : UK Comics : Smash|date=17 August 2018|website=web.archive.org}}</ref>  A hallmark of this policy was to be the even-handedness with which the editorial staff drew the multitude of reprint strips featured in the new ''Smash'' from both ''Lion'' and ''Buster'', in seeking to appeal to readers of both (i.e. mixing serious and humorous strips without discrimination).\n\nThe symbol of the change was the new cover feature, ''Warriors of the World''. This now replaced ''The Swots and Blots'', who, drawn by Mike Lacey, had occupied the cover during the final part of the Odhams years. Happily, ''The Swots and the Blots'' survived (and prospered) on the inside pages, now drawn by Leo Baxendale.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2009/12/christmas-comics-valiant-1971.html|title=BLIMEY! The Blog of British Comics: Christmas comics: Valiant 1971|first=Lew|last=Stringer|date=17 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nWith the first relaunch issue (No.163) bearing a cover feature entitled ''Warriors of the World No.1'', the former numbering was discontinued.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/25870/ Smash! - Title Notes] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> To have maintained the original sequential numbering alongside the ''Warriors of the World'' series could only have caused confusion.\n\nThe revamped ''Smash'', now comprising 40 pages, featured all-British strips \u2014 adventure serials, humour strips, and sporting strips \u2014 many of which were reprints from ''Lion'', such as ''Eric the Viking'' (originally ''Karl the Viking''), ''The Battle of Britain'' (originally ''Britain in Chains''), and ''Nutt and Bolt, the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.''; and others which were reprints from ''Buster'', such as ''Wacker'' (originally ''Elmer''), ''Monty Muddle - The Man from Mars'' (originally ''Milkiway - The Man from Mars''), and ''Consternation Street''; but strictly no American superheroes.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The number of reprint strips was another significant indicator of its troubled financial situation, reprints being significantly cheaper than commissioning new strips.\n\nOf the former Odhams strips, only a handful survived. Humour strips which continued were ''The Swots and the Blots'', ''Wiz War'' and ''Bad Penny''. Additionally, ''Percy's Pets'' made occasional appearances (but did not appear every week). Much mourned were the loss of ''The Cloak'' and ''The Man from BUNGLE'', dropped due to the waning popularity of spy spoofs (in 1968 the TV series ''The Man from UNCLE'' had been cancelled); and especially mourned was the loss of Ken Reid and ''The Nervs''.\n\nThe serious offerings fared even worse. For although the survivors appeared to include ''Sergeant Rock - Paratrooper'' and ''Bunsen's Burner'', in reality neither of these were genuinely from the Odhams era. Both had begun only a few weeks earlier, in issues 156 and 158 respectively. They were really a part of the relaunch, but were introduced slightly ahead of time to disguise that fact. The only genuine survivor from the adventure strips of the Odhams years was ''King of the Ring'', and even that had only begun with issue&nbsp;144, in November&nbsp;1968.\n\nAfter a few months, superheroes appeared to be making a comeback. The Editorial column admitted receiving complaints from readers about the loss of the Marvel strips; and, in the autumn of 1969, six months after the ''Fantastic Four'' and ''Thor'' had been dropped, an all-British superhero called Tri-Man appeared, debuting in the issue of 13 September, and the character also featured in the ''Smash'' Annual that Christmas. Some indication of the effort put into this character is the fact that he was given sole possession of the front cover of the Annual! The adventures of Johnny Meek featured a hero who had triple-superpowers, hence the name Tri-Man. He leaped about rooftops (shades of Spider-Man, from the long-vanished ''Pow''), and got his powers from a ray device once every 24 hours (shades of DC's ''Green Lantern''). But the strip did not prove popular, and quietly vanished in the reshuffles of 1970.\n\nIn the light of how few strips of any sort survived from the Odhams era, and given that none of the superhero strips survived at all (which, according to the Letters pages,<ref>It was a feature of the Odhams years that the comic included a page for readers' letters, like the American comics published by Marvel and DC on which it was based, but the Letters Page was dropped in March 1969 in favour of extra advertising space.</ref> were the most popular feature of the ''Power Comics''), it would be stretching the truth to say that ''Smash'' inherited the best of the Odhams strips. Stylistically, ''The Swots and the Blots'' was the most creative and sophisticated Odhams strip (save only ''The Nervs''), and it did survive. But it was only one strip. And ''The Nervs'', which was objectively a more sophisticated strip in 1968, did not.\n\nMoreover, the publisher was taking a significant risk by re-launching the former ''Power Comic'' as, in effect, a clone of IPC's most popular titles, ''Lion'' and ''Valiant''. The publisher hoped it could repeat the success of ''Valiant'' and ''Lion'' by copying their successful formula. Nevertheless, without its discontinued superheroes ''Smash'' had nothing unique about it that might attract new readers, compared to its stablemates \u2014 featuring as it did a mix of strips reprinted from (or based on the style of) ''Lion'' and ''Buster''.\n\nOne other aspect of the change: under the umbrella of IPC Magazines Ltd, the editorial team of Alf and Cos was replaced by a single editor, identified only as 'Mike'.<ref>[https://www.comics.org/issue/368582/ https://www.comics.org/issue/368582/]</ref>\n\n\n===IPC Humour Strips===\n\nAs under Odhams, humour continued to play a large part in the relaunched comic (in terms of the page count): not to the extent it did in ''Buster'', but at least as much as in ''Valiant'' or ''Lion''.\n\nWith the relaunch, ''The Swots and the Blots'' (one of the handful of surviving Odhams strips) moved from the prestigious front cover to the centre pages. Nevertheless, now drawn by Leo Baxendale it became a standard bearer for sophisticated artwork. Baxendale began a five-year run on the strip (beginning in ''Smash'' and continuing in its successor, ''Valiant and Smash'', with some fill-ins by Les Barton<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicsuk.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=148&t=2818|title=Smash! comic the swots and the blots- Leo Baxendale - Comics UK|website=comicsuk.co.uk}}</ref>), by adopting a new style, one which influenced many others in the comics field, just as his earlier ''Beano'' work had done; and in the process attaining a new, deliriously daft, high standard, one rarely approached by other strips.\n\nNew humour strips featured in the relaunch (new to ''Smash'' at any rate) included a half-page cartoon strip drawn by Angel Nadal, entitled ''Big 'Ead'', detailing the humorous misadventures of a Mr&nbsp;Knowall character, summed up by the strip's catchphrase, continually bellowed at the lead character by his irate victims: \"''Have a care there, Big&nbsp;'Ead!''\" Reprinted from ''Buster'', where it had initially run \u2014 under the same title \u2014 from 28 May 1960 to 18 February 1961.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p43\">''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p43</ref>\n\n''Wacker'' was a single page cartoon strip, subtitled ''He's All at Sea''. Drawn at different times by Rafart<ref>[https://www.lambiek.net/artists/r/raf.htm Juan Rafart Rold\u00e1n] (1928 - 13 October 1997, Spain)</ref> and by Roy Wilson, it concerned the crazy antics in the Royal Navy of Mis-leading Seaman Wacker, who was forever driving the Captain of HMS Impossible toward a nervous breakdown. Despite the Liverpudlian overtones of his surname, Wacker seemed not to be a Scouser \u2013 which may have been because it was ''not'' his real name! The strip, although new to ''Smash'', had run in ''[[Buster (comics)|Buster]]'' from 29 October 1960 to 17 October 1964 under its real title, ''Elmer''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2018/10/29/buster-60s/|title=Buster 60s|date=29 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p43\"/>\n\nAnother humour strip new to ''Smash'' was the World War Two spoof, ''Nutt and Bolt the Men From W.H.E.E.Z.E.'' Set in 1940, this featured an English scientist named Professor Nutt, who was a boffin inventing eccentric secret weapons for a department of the War Office known as W.H.E.E.Z.E. (short for Weapon Handling Early Experimental and Zoning Establishment), who was kept out of trouble by his Army \"minder\", Sgt&nbsp;'Lightning' Bolt. Nutt and Bolt were perpetually clashing with a cunning Nazi scientist named Doktor Skull. This was another reprint strip, perhaps from ''Lion''. As its title implies, it was born out of the earlier popularity of the ''Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' television series. However, the strip had only a short run in ''Smash'', being replaced after just 22&nbsp;issues.\n\nYet it was not only in the plainly cartoon-style strips that humour flourished in the new ''Smash''. Many of the ostensibly more serious offerings were, in reality, humour strips: in particular, ''His Sporting Lordship'' and ''The World Wide Wanderers''; but there was also a strong humorous undercurrent in the new lead serial, ''Master of the Marsh''.\n\n===IPC Sporting Strips===\n\nSporting strips were now the order of the day. Reflecting this, the new lead, on page 3, was ''Master of the Marsh'', drawn by [[Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez (comics)|Solano Lopez]],<ref name=\"Comics artist Solano Lopez\">Comics artist [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2012/11/this-week-in-1970-smash-goes-on-hiatus.html Solano Lopez]</ref> a sports serial about Patchman, a strange hermit who lived in the East Anglian fens. He was appointed as the new sports master at Marshside Secondary School, nicknamed 'The Marsh', because he was the only person who could control the kids \u2014 a group of hooligans known as 'the Monsters of the Marsh'. There was an association of ideas between fens and marsh, reinforced by the fact that Patchman camped in the inaccessible heart of the marshes. He was a burly woodsman who had always lived in the Fens, and could communicate after a fashion with the local wildlife, for whom he acted as protector.\n\nThe strip initially featured humorous stories about the attempts of Knocker Reeves \u2013 the worst of the 'monsters' \u2013 to get the better of the new teacher. But eventually it transpired that Patchman was secretly the guardian of a collection of relics left behind by [[Hereward the Wake]], a warlord who had fought the Norman invaders in the Fens during the 11th Century. In this respect, the strip had an occasional tendency to embrace science fiction overtones.\n\nOf the sports-based stories, the only survivor from the Odhams years was ''King of the Ring'', which continued to prosper. Possibly feeling the strip was suffering in the credibility stakes, the new editorial team made a decision to change the name of King's manager, who bore the remarkable name (actually a nickname) of Blarney Stone! They threw Blarney out of the series and substituted a new manager with a less silly name. ''Ballyhoo Barnes'' wasn't all that much less silly, but it's the thought that counts! Even so, Blarney reappeared after a few weeks, by popular demand.\n\nThe most successful of the new sports-based strips (certainly the most long-running) was ''His Sporting Lordship'', drawn by Douglas Maxted.<ref>Comics artist [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2009/12/christmas-comics-valiant-1971.html Douglas Maxted]</ref> This humorous hit proved so popular that it ultimately became one of the few to outlast ''Smash'' itself. Henry Nobbins had been a labourer on a building site until he inherited the title of Earl of Ranworth and five million pounds. Before he could touch the money, however, he had to become champion at a number of sports. He also had to evade the nefarious attentions of Mr&nbsp;Parkinson, who was a rival claimant to the fortune, and Parkinson's villainous henchman, Fred Bloggs.\n\nLord Henry, as he had now become, was more than ably assisted by his Butler, Jarvis, who he had inherited from the previous Earl. And Jarvis proved indispensable. Henry was never portrayed as anything other than an able athlete and a good natured bloke, leaving Jarvis to supply the cunning which was (frequently) needed to defeat the dastardly Mr&nbsp;Parkinson, and prevent Henry's ancestral home, Castle Plonkton, from being turned into a glue factory.\n\nThe relaunch included a short-lived football strip with humorous overtones, entitled ''The World-Wide Wanderers'', about a League football team composed of eleven players from eleven different countries \u2014 not such a funny joke today! Football manager Harry Kraft found himself a passenger on a ship passing through the Suez Canal; ships from all over the world called there, and the crews conducted impromptu soccer matches to while away the time in port. Some of the crews had been stranded there, and constant soccer practice (since there was nothing else to do) had caused them to develop fantastic footballing skills. Kraft shipped eleven of them, from as many different countries, back to England; and they used their highly unorthodox individual skills to play as a team in the old Fourth Division.\n\n===IPC Adventure Strips===\n\nThe other staple of the new ''Smash'' was adventure serials, and far and away the most successful of these was ''The Incredible Adventures of [[Janus Stark]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://britishcomicart.blogspot.com/search/label/Janus%2BStark|title=British Comic Art}}</ref> written by Tom Tully,<ref>Credits for [https://www.comics.org/issue/1052666/#2183041 Janus Stark] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> featuring an escapologist in Victorian London who appeared to be simply an unusual act on the music-hall stage, but who privately used his extraordinary abilities to battle against injustice. Stark had an unusually flexible bone structure, enabling him to get out of an astonishing variety of tight situations, thanks to training received in childhood from his mentor, Blind Largo. Drawn by [[Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez (comics)|Solano Lopez]], there was more than a touch of Reed Richards, from the departed ''Fantastic Four'' strip, in Stark's uncanny abilities.<ref>Stark's flexible bone structure, which was the basis of his career as an escapologist in the theatres, was perhaps more akin to ''Rubberman'', a character who had featured in ''Smash'' in 1966</ref> Lopez's dark, moody artwork also gave the strip a perfect 19th Century setting.<ref name=\"Comics artist Solano Lopez\"/> The strip was one of the few to survive the merger of ''Smash'' into ''Valiant'' in 1971, and is still well remembered today. As a mark of its popularity, from week 30 it replaced ''Master of the Marsh'' as the lead serial on page 3 (swapping places with the latter, which was thus relegated to an inconspicuous location on pages 12 and 13).\n\nThis brings up the matter of economics once more. Solano Lopez was a foreign illustrator, born in the Argentine, who worked at a studio in Spain. For reasons of cost, IPC had taken a policy decision to source artwork from cheaper sources outside the UK.<ref name=\"blogs.birminghammail.net\"/> Along with the presence in the new ''Smash'' of reprint strips, which were much cheaper than commissioning new strips, this is yet another indicator of the financial pressure the comic was still under, and the absolute necessity of cutting production costs to the bone in order to make it financially viable.\n\nAnother long-running adventure strip was ''The Battle of Britain'', in which secret agent Simon Kane fought against Baron Rudolph, a usurper who had seized control of Britain using a secret weapon. The weapon emitted a sound wave which paralysed anyone who wasn't protected against it. Rudolph set up a police state, similar in emblems and uniforms to medieval England at the time of King John, and Kane led the resistance against him.\n\nIn spite of the title, the strip had no connection with the Second World War! Drawn for the initial 40 issues by Geoff Campion, and thereafter by [[John Stokes (comics)|John Stokes]],<ref>Fleetway Companion by Steve Holland, p109</ref> it was in fact a reprint; hence it, too, was an indication of the comic's troubled financial status (reprints being cheaper than new strips). It originally ran in ''[[Lion (comics)|Lion]]'' from 29 February 1964 to 28 May 1966 under various titles including ''Britain in Chains'' and ''The Battle for Britain'', where the hero was called Vic Gunn. The editorial staff of ''Smash'' took a decision to change the names of the leading characters from Gunn and Barrel (i.e. ''gun barrel''), to slightly less absurd ones; and so were born secret agent Simon Kane and his assistant Tubby. This had been a very long-running strip in ''Lion'', so much so that ''Smash'' actually ceased publication \u2014 in April 1971 \u2014 before it had reprinted the entire run from ''Lion'', and in the final issue created an (unconvincing) new ending for the serial.\n\n''Rebbels on the Run'' was another adventure serial, featuring three young brothers whose surname was Rebbel, who run away from an orphanage to avoid being split up. After a few months on the run, the strip took an amazing turn and \u2014 renamed ''The Rebbel Robot'' \u2014 became a science fiction serial, when the boys discovered that their late father's mind was preserved within the brain of a robot, which became their unofficial guardian. With it they embarked on a quest to track down a criminal known as The Genie, who had murdered their real father \u2014 who, in a further improbable turn of events, turned out to be a secret agent!\n\n''Eric the Viking'', a continuing serial featuring its eponymous Viking hero, and set in the Dark Ages, was another reprint from ''Lion'', where it had run under the title ''Karl the Viking'', as a set of 13 stories, from 29 October 1960 until 29 September 1964, written by Ken Bulmer.<ref name=\"Steve Holland p108\">Fleetway Companion by Steve Holland, p108</ref> The change of name to Eric probably reflects on the continuing fame (during the 1960s) of a real-life Viking leader in Dark Age Britain, Eric Bloodaxe, who history records was King in Viking York in the 10th Century. The strip is well remembered under its original title, as it was drawn by a famous comics artist, Don Lawrence.<ref>Comics artist [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2012/11/this-week-in-1970-smash-goes-on-hiatus.html Don Lawrence]</ref><ref>[http://www.donlawrence.co.uk/shop/index.php?hg=2&sg=35 Deluxe hardback collection of ''Karl the Viking'' strips] by Don Lawrence</ref> Eric (and Karl) fought a weird but impressive collection of legendary and fantasy monsters, in sword-and-sorcery epics which had some reflections in Lawrence's art for his contemporary work on the highly regarded all-colour science fiction strip ''[[The Trigan Empire]]'' then running in ''Look and Learn''. This was not even the first reprint: retitled ''Swords of the Sea Wolves'' it had initially been reprinted in ''Lion'', in part, between 1 October 1966 and 7 October 1967, with the lead character renamed Rolf the Viking.<ref name=\"Steve Holland p108\"/> And it would later be reprinted again, in the European version of ''Vulcan'': on that occasion translated into German and retitled 'Kobra'.\n\nTwo of the new IPC adventure strips \u2014 ''Sergeant Rock Paratrooper'' and ''Bunsen's Burner'' \u2014 were introduced five or six weeks early, in an attempt to conceal how few Odhams strips had actually survived, by making these appear to be existing strips although they were not. World War Two was the setting for the former, which, with occasional stories drawn by John Vernon,<ref>Fleetway Companion by Steve Holland, p88</ref> recounted the adventures of the 'Red Devils' of the Parachute Regiment. Initially, Sgt Rock was merely a narrator, introducing stories featuring other characters, so that it was actually tales-of-the-parachute-regiment, rather than tales of Sgt Rock himself. This was a device for reprinting old war stories from other comics: the strip had originally appeared in Fleetway's ''Hurricane'', from 4 July 1964 to 8 May 1965, entitled ''Paratrooper'', and continued in ''Tiger'' when that title absorbed ''Hurricane'' in the issue dated 15 May 1965. The reprints in ''Smash'' were reasonably successful, running for a year; and Sergeant Rock eventually featured as more than just narrator, with later editions sending him into action with the SAS, and marking the change by altering the title to ''Sergeant Rock - Special Air Service''. This change was noticeable, also, by a change of artist; seemingly \u2014 from the similarity of style \u2014 to the artist on the discontinued wartime strip, ''Nutt and Bolt the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.''.\n\n''Bunsen's Burner'' was a short-lived strip, lasting just a few weeks.<ref>It was discontinued during the reshuffles of August 1969, when various changes were quietly made to the comic over the course of a month.</ref> This was an adventure yarn with humorous overtones \u2013 its humorous content being trailed in its title: a reference to an item familiar to most schoolboys from their Chemistry classes. Ben Bunsen was the owner of a vintage car, which was known as \"the Burner\" because it was so old it was steam-driven! Like an old-fashioned steam train it had a boiler which had to be stoked, as it ran on coal instead of petrol. Ben and his pal had to drive the Burner around the world, as a condition of Ben inheriting his uncle's fortune; but a rival claimant (shades of ''His Sporting Lordship''!) was secretly out to stop them.\n\nAnother adventure strip which had a sadly brief run, lasting only 47 weeks, but which is very well-remembered today, was ''Cursitor Doom''. In this spooky and atmospheric series,<ref>The strip had various artists during its one year run, but far and away the most effective of them was the talented Eric Bradbury, and it is mainly his serials from which the strip's enduring reputation derives</ref> Cursitor Doom, master investigator of the strange and mystic, who openly practiced sorcery in the strip, battled against the dark forces of evil, ably assisted by the pounding fists of his assistant, Angus McCraggan. Doom battled against genuine spirits and sorcerers, in tales including ''The Case of Kalak the Dwarf'', ''The Sorcerer's Talisman'' and ''The Dark Legion of Mardarax'', in the latter encountering a haunted (and unstoppable) Roman Legion brought back to \"life\" by the evil Mardarax. Doom's pet Raven, Scarab, who could write messages in the dust for Angus McCraggan, by scratching with his claw, was often of more help to Doom in these serials than was the perpetually baffled McCraggan.\n\nThe ''Cursitor Doom'' strip was drawn by Geoff Campion (including ''The Return of the Hunter''), and \u2013 more effectively \u2013 by [[Eric Bradbury]] (including the magnificently atmospheric ''Dark Legion of Mardarax'').\n\n===Changes in August 1969===\n\nAfter 22 weeks, in August&nbsp;1969, ''Nutt and Bolt the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.'' was dropped, and replaced from the 23rd&nbsp;issue by a more serious World War Two strip entitled ''Send For... Q-Squad'', which dealt with the adventures of a hand picked group of six specialists, who were assigned to unusual missions that required special expertise both in the air and on the ground. This, too, in keeping with the need to cut costs, was a reprint, originally published in ''Buster'' from 28 May 1960 to 7 March 1964 under the title ''Phantom Force 5''.<ref>[http://www.bustercomic.com/phantomforcefive.html ''Phantom Force Five''] in ''Buster''</ref><ref>''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p36</ref>\n\nThis was another of those drawn, initially, by one of IPC's best British artists, [[Eric Bradbury]], at other times by the Spanish-based artist Luis Bermejo Rojo,<ref>[http://smashpages.net/2015/12/15/rip-luis-bermejo-rojo/ Career of Luis Bermejo] at SmashPages.net</ref> and in its final months mainly by Fred Holmes.<ref>Comics artist [http://www.bustercomic.com/phantomforcefive.html Fred Holmes] at BusterComic.com</ref> Because the strip had a regrettably short run in ''Smash'' (from 16 August 1969 to 30 January 1970 only), most of the run features art by Eric Bradbury.\n\nIt was marked out as a reprint by its unique style \u2014 which was both different from, and grimmer than, all the other strips. Whereas Sgt Rock emulated Lord Henry (and Janus Stark), by maintaining a huge and confident smile, regardless of how much trouble he was in, no one in ''Q-Squad'' ever stopped looking worried. Its reprint status was also signalled by the fact that Q-Squad was plainly ''not'' the original name of the team. Some panels showed evidence of the name having been inserted over a previous one: a change in the lettering style for the name 'Q-Squad' and any adjacent words \u2014 which used a different handwriting in a cruder style wherever the name appeared, but nowhere else.\n\nIn the same issue, a serious footballing serial entitled ''The Handcuff Hotspurs'' began, replacing the departed \u2014 and rather more humorous \u2014 ''World Wide Wanderers''. Hard-as-nails former prison sports instructor 'Toff' Morgan (so called for his habit of always wearing a top-hat) took over the management of ailing First Division side Haversham Hotspurs. Morgan began to rebuild the team by 'framing' ex-criminals who he'd known while working in various prisons, forcing them to sign on with the club in order to make use of their dishonest skills as footballing talents. These convicts became the 'handcuff hotspurs' of the title. The club's former manager, Reg Jessup, tried constantly to sabotage Morgan's efforts, in order to persuade the Directors to re-appoint him instead.\n\nSix months earlier, various humour strips had been introduced as replacements for the (far more surreal) humour of [[Ken Reid (comics)|Ken Reid]], whose strip ''The Nervs'' had so disturbed IPC's management. Now another was forthcoming, and one which reflected the pervasive sporting theme of the relaunched comic. ''The Touchline Tearaways'' (replacing ''Big 'Ead'') was another new football-themed strip, featuring three mad-keen supporters of Grimshot United: a totally useless Football League team, perpetually in danger of being relegated as it was made up entirely of ailing and decrepit players. Each week the Tearaways \u2014 Hairy, Lug'oles and Clever Dick \u2014 would execute some scheme from the touchline to help Grimshot win that week's fixture, usually involving a battle of wits with officials from the Ministry of Football, who, not unnaturally, tried to put a stop to the Tearaways well-intentioned cheating.\n\nThe name of the club, Grimshot United, was a humorous indication that the team was not very good (i.e. that the players were \"grim shots\"). Each strip featured a single match, with a plot based around helping the team overcome that week's opponent. Clever Dick masterminded all the ploys used in helping Grimshot, and apart from occasional words of congratulation or encouragement he was generally the only \"Tearaway\" who had dialogue in the strip. Hairy and Lug'oles tended to be merely a pair of walking visual gags: Hairy's features were perpetually invisible behind a vast mass of long black hair that covered his entire face and head, and Lug'oles had a pair of enormous ears.\n\nThese three new strips represented a minor change of emphasis, replacing two of the more whimsical offerings with two entirely serious strips \u2014 even though the third new entry (which was only a single-page) was simply one outright cartoon strip replacing another.\n\nThus, within six months, a number of the strips introduced in the relaunch had already bitten the dust. And more changes were looming.\n\n===The 2nd Relaunch : 1970===\n\nThe most obvious problem faced by the new-look ''Smash'' was the constant \"churn\": the incessant turnover of strips. Without its solidly popular superhero strips to rely on, the editorial staff seemed pathologically incapable of settling on a fixed line-up.<ref>Continual change of line-up was not a problem unique to ''Smash'', but was shared by all IPC's comics of this period. Editors struggled to find strips sufficiently popular to halt the decline in weekly sales; but making so many changes was self-defeating, because it harmed reader loyalty.</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the changes made in August&nbsp;1969, further changes made at the start of 1970 left ''Smash'' looking very different from its appearance in the wake of the relaunch just 12&nbsp;months earlier. A vast number of new strips were added, in a second re-launch, such that only half of those introduced in March&nbsp;1969 now survived, although those which continued included ''Master of the Marsh'', ''[[Janus Stark]]'', ''His Sporting Lordship'', ''Battle of Britain'', ''Eric the Viking'', ''Wacker'', ''The Handcuff Hotspurs'', ''The Swots and the Blots'', and ''Percy's Pets'' \u2014 the latter two now being the only remaining Odhams strips.<ref name=SP2010 />\n\nDiscontinued were ''King of the Ring'' (last survivor of the serious strips from the Odhams era), ''Sergeant Rock \u2013 Special Air Service'', and ''Cursitor Doom''. Three of the strips only recently introduced were also dropped, namely the wartime ''Q-Squad'', British superhero ''Tri-Man'', and the humour strip ''The Touchline Tearaways''.\n\nThe first changes in 1970 occurred in the issue dated 24 January, when three new strips appeared, all reprints from ''Buster'': ''The Kid Commandos'', ''Consternation Street'', and ''Monty Muddle \u2013 The Man from Mars'' (originally titled ''Milkiway \u2013 The Man from Mars''). These were introduced as part of a relaunch of the comic: by once again bringing in some of the changes a few weeks ahead of the relaunch, as had been done in the Spring of 1969, the publisher hoped to disguise the true extent of the changes.<ref name=SP2010 />\n\n''The Kid Commandos'' was a war story about three cockney children stranded in occupied France in World War Two. Drawn by Tom Kerr, the Sparrow children \u2014 Tommy, Jan and Podge \u2014 were on the run from the Germans each week, in a single page strip set in 1940. This was another reprint from ''Buster'', in which it appeared from 9 January to 24 July 1965, under the imaginative title ''The Sparrows Go To War''.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p38\">''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p38</ref>\n\nIn the humour strip ''Consternation Street'' drawn by Reg Parlett (the title spoofed that of the popular British television soap opera, ''Coronation Street''), which was usually a one-page strip, a collection of unlikely neighbours rubbed shoulders in a very small street. Watched over by the dim-witted Constable Clott were the Snobbs and the Ardupps, Colonel Curry & Caesar (his dog), Miss Primm and her pets, Cutprice the Grocer, and Roger the Lodger. This was another reprint from ''Buster'', in which it had originally run \u2013 under the same title \u2013 between 9 January and 23 October 1965.<ref>''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p44</ref> Parlett was also known from his other humour strips in ''Buster'' including ''Rent-A-Ghost Ltd'', ''The Happy Family'' and ''Bonehead''.<ref>[http://comicsuk.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=148&t=1992 Reg Parlett's contributions to ''Valiant'' and ''Buster''] (including the long running ''Billy Bunter'' strip in ''Valiant'', which continued in ''Valiant and Smash'')</ref>\n\nThe half-page humour strip ''Monty Muddle \u2013 The Man from Mars'' recounted the misadventures of spaceman Monty Muddle (a name rather less convincing than the character's original name, ''Milkiway''). It originally ran in ''Buster'' from 28 May 1960 to 10 March 1962, with art credited to Nadal/Rafart.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p43\"/> He flew about in his small bubble-domed spacecraft trying to make friends with the Earth people. However, due to his misunderstanding of Earth customs, his every attempt at contact ended in disaster; and each strip would typically end with the catchphrase ''I'll try again next week!''\n\nThe 7 February issue then saw a full re-launch: with more free gifts, another new cover feature, and no less than eight new strips (making an astonishing eleven strips added since the beginning of the year).\n\nThe ''Warriors of the World'' covers had run into a problem, in that war stories were no longer a strong element of ''Smash'', which had dropped the humour strip ''Nutt and Bolt the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.'' some time earlier. When it was decided to also drop ''Sergeant Rock \u2013 Paratrooper'' (by then renamed ''Sergeant Rock \u2013 Special Air Service''), and ''Q&nbsp;Squad'', the cover feature had to go too. It was not practical to advertise war stories on the cover if there were no war stories inside!\n\nThe newly added ''Kid Commandos'' did not count as a war story in this context, since the three fugitive children did not do any conventional fighting. The strip was more like a souped-up version of the discontinued ''Rebbels on the Run''.\n\nAccordingly, after forty seven weeks<ref>46 issues featuring the ''Warriors of the World'' cover feature, and one Christmas issue</ref> the ''Warriors of the World'' series was ended. Instead, the issue dated 7 February 1970 began ''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test'', written by Angus Allan and drawn by the ever-popular Eric Bradbury.<ref>Credits for [https://www.comics.org/issue/1052666/#2183036 ''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test'']</ref> Henceforth each week's cover featured a full-page splash advertising the task which adventurer Simon Test would undertake in a new strip on the inside pages. This strip proved so successful that when the original thirteen-week series was completed (featuring one task each week), Simon Test was given a new series of adventures, extending his hold on the cover indefinitely. He would prove particularly enduring, being one of the few strips to ultimately survive the merger with ''Valiant'' in 1971.\n\n''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test'' saw him undertake a quest for immortality by attempting the thirteen tasks of the Pharaoh Thot, believing this to be the only way to save his life, having been deceived into believing he has only a few months to live. The sinister Jabez Coppenger secretly desired Test's death as a means of restoring his own youth. This serial introduced the mute servant Karka, who would ultimately become Test's friend and assistant.\n\nTest then went on to the more lengthy series of adventures entitled ''Simon Test and the Curse of the Conqueror'', where he battled the twenty servants of the evil Ezekiel Spar, the self-styled Conqueror. This pitted him against twenty athletes and champions, each of whom was under the hypnotic control of Spar, who implanted in them an in-built impulse to kill Simon Test.\n\nNew supporting strips introduced in the 7 February issue included ''Threat of the Toymaker'', ''The Pillater Peril'', ''Birdman of Baratoga'', ''Nick and Nat \u2013 The Beat Boys'', and three humour strips with a common supernatural element: ''Sam's Spook'' (drawn by Leo Baxendale), ''The Haunts of Headless Harry'', and ''Ghost Ship''.\n\nIn ''Threat of the Toymaker'', drawn by Solano Lopez, a criminal scientist named Doctor Droll escaped from Garstone Prison with the aid of an army of remote controlled mechanical toys he had constructed, along the way taking the Prison Governor's children, Pam and Peter Keen, as hostages. Hampered by the children at every turn, Droll finds himself on the run, pursued by the Police wherever he goes. The idea of using radio controlled toys in the strip was scarcely original, since it was a straight lift from the ''House of Dolmann'', which was then running in ''Valiant'', as well as from the ''General Jumbo'' strip in ''The Beano''. The strip was scarcely original either: having been first published in ''Buster'', under the title ''The Toys of Doom'', between 27 February 1965 and 13 January 1968 (and in which it would be reprinted\u2014in part\u2014between 3 May and 6 September 1986, under the title ''The Terror Toys''), it was also reprinted in ''Eagle'', under its original title ''The Toys of Doom''.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p38\"/>\n\n''The Pillater Peril'' saw David Pillater return to Pillater House, his ancestral home on the Cornish coast, which he is to inherit on his 21st&nbsp;birthday. Along with his four cousins and his Uncle Bernard, David is imperilled by Francis Pillater, an ancestor who has seemingly returned from the dead. Francis had an evil reputation for his misdeeds in the 16th century, but was thought to have perished in a shipwreck during a storm at sea. Blaming the family for his troubles, he sets out for revenge by kidnapping them one by one. The strip had only a short run, but when discontinued it did, unusually, seemingly come to a natural conclusion (rather than merely wrapping-up many continuing plot threads unconvincingly in the final panel).\n\n''Birdman from Baratoga'' was an adventure strip about a boy who grew up on a Pacific island with only the company of birds, and learned from them the secret of flight. By the use of a feather cape, he was able to glide through the air like an albatros. When an English sailor is castaway on the island, called Baratoga, they escape together on a raft and set out on a series of adventures in the Pacific, beginning by hunting down the desperado who has stolen the man's pearl-fishing yacht, ''Enterprise''. ''Birdman from Baratoga'' was perhaps loosely based on a humour strip which had run in ''Buster'' during 1968: ''Captain Swoop \u2013 He's Half Man, Half Bird, Half Wit''.\n\nIn a very atypical move, prompted by IPC's on-going financial problems (in the year in which they were taken over by the Reed Group), the editorial team now resurrected one of the old strips which had run in ''Wham'' under Odhams, drawn by Gordon Hogg. ''Nick and Nat \u2013 The Beat Boys'' featured two young lads from Liverpool who fancied themselves as musicians, spoke in Liverpudlian slang (even the original title of the strip was derived from a slang Scouse term for a native of Liverpool: 'wacker'), sported Beatles-style haircuts, and always carried guitars. This was a reprint of ''The&nbsp;Wacks'', which had run in ''Wham'' during 1964, reprinted here with only the title and the names changed. Spoofing the pop group ''The Beatles'', it was an odd choice to run it a year ''after'' that group's demise. It was, though, a popular item: this 1964 strip had already been reprinted, under the title ''Birk 'n' 'Ed, the Mersey Dead-Beats'', from 30 January 1965 in Fleetway's ''Hurricane''.<ref>''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p.89</ref><ref>Spoken quickly for comic effect, the names of the two characters were intended to sound like that of a district in Liverpool called Birkenhead</ref>\n\nA common supernatural theme linked the three new humour strips. In ''Sam's Spook'', drawn by the ubiquitous Leo Baxendale, Sam was a schoolboy with a ghostly pal called Spooky, who used his powers to humorous effect on Sam's behalf. The strip mostly consisted of Sam's school friends catching Spooky doing a bit of ghostly cheating in order to help Sam win at sports or football, and Sam doing a lot of running away to avoid a bashing.\n\n''The Haunts of Headless Harry'' featured the amiable ghost of a 16th-century soldier who had been beheaded. Harry's head and body led separate but related ghostly existences, with the body carrying the head around everywhere, and both of them were able to talk. Harry's humorous adventures invariably involved misplacing his head; such as going to the cinema and, on leaving, calling at the cloakroom to collect it (as though it was a hat), and being asked by the attendant to identify it among all the other ghostly heads left there during the film.\n\nThe other new humour strip was ''Ghost Ship'', in which the spirit of an ancient galleon, and the ghosts of its pirate crew, sailed the Seven Seas making mischief, but usually coming off worst.\n\nFurther changes followed: such that fully thirteen strips had been introduced since the start of 1970. In the issue dated 27 June 1970, a new humour strip began entitled ''Moonie's Magic Mate'', about a schoolboy, Barry Moon, who finds a Genie in a dusty old bottle. In the issue dated 29 August, a humour strip titled ''The Fighting Three'' began, featuring the misadventures of three men: globe-trotters McGinty, Hambone and Weasel are travelling the world, trying to raise enough money to start their own construction company, but get into fights \u2013 and jail! \u2013 wherever they go. Drawn by Carlos Cruz, this was another reprint from ''Buster'', where, under its original title ''Mighty McGinty'', the strip had run in 1964.<ref>Published 29 February to 17 October 1964: ''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p38</ref> And finally, in the last addition before the comic's closure, a strip entitled ''Tyler the Tamer'' was launched in early 1971, about the adventures of the greatest film stuntman in the world. Dropped to make room for these were ''Kid Commandos'', ''Threat of the Toymaker'' and ''The Pillater Peril'' (the ''Pillater'' saga seemingly reaching a natural conclusion, instead of merely being summarily abandoned).\n\n==Merger with ''Valiant''==\n\nIn mid-November 1970, production on ''Smash'' (and many other IPC titles, including ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]'') came to a halt due to a printers' strike, and no editions were published for the next three months.<ref name=SP2010 /> By the time the strike was settled, in February of the following year, irreparable damage had been done to the comic's circulation, as its young readers had turned elsewhere in the intervening 11&nbsp;weeks. Similar harm had been suffered by ''Valiant''. In consequence of this latest financial disaster, after eight issues, in April&nbsp;1971 the two titles were merged in an attempt to combine their surviving circulation. For a brief time the merged comic was entitled ''Valiant and Smash'' (10 April to 18 September 1971<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2018/11/27/valiant-70s/|title=Valiant 70s|date=27 November 2018}}</ref>), before reverting to simply ''Valiant''.\n\nSome strips from ''Smash'' survived in the new comic, including ''His Sporting Lordship'', ''[[Janus Stark]]'' and ''The Swots and the Blots'', but most were lost,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180805023305/http://26pigs.com/valiant/index.html Merger with ''Valiant''] - ''Valiant and Smash''</ref> although the ''Smash'' Annual continued to appear for many years afterwards (continuing, in fact, until the 1976 Annual, published in the autumn of 1975).

However, it was revived in the 1972 ''Smash'' Annual, published at Christmas&nbsp;1971, and returned year after year: becoming the regular cover feature of the Annuals.<ref name=\"British Comics website\"/>\n\nThe merged title was dominated by ''Valiant'', which contributed nine strips consisting of twenty pages; whereas ''Smash!'' was represented by only four strips, totalling a meager nine pages: ''Janus Stark'', ''The Swots & The Blots'', ''Simon Test'', and ''His Sporting Lordship''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kidr77.blogspot.com/2012/10/a-valiant-attempt-at-smashing.html|title=CRIVENS!

Annual, published mainly under the Fleetway imprint, continued to appear every year: the final Annual, cover-dated 1976, was published in the autumn of 1975.\n\nDuring 1967 and 1968 ''Smash!'' was part of Odhams' [[Power Comics]] line (from #44 to #143), absorbing its sister titles ''[[Pow! (comics)|Pow!]]'' on 14 September 1968 (issue&nbsp;137) and ''[[Fantastic (comics)|Fantastic]]'' on 2 November 1968 (issue&nbsp;144). As ''Pow!'' and ''Fantastic'' had themselves already merged with ''[[Wham! (comics)|Wham!]]'' and ''[[Terrific (comics)|Terrific]]'' respectively, ''Smash!'' became the last survivor of the ''Power Comics''.\n\nUntil March 1969, alongside British humour strips, it included black-and-white reprints of superhero strips originally published in America by [[Marvel Comics]] and [[DC Comics|DC]]. The last of these, the ''[[Fantastic Four]]'', ended in issue&nbsp;162.

The ''Power Comics'' logo, printed on the cover of each issue, was a gimmick dreamed up by Odhams to unify their five titles under a common banner. ''Smash'' remained part of that lineup for 100 issues; the logo was quietly dropped after #143 when the last of the other comics forming part of the lineup was cancelled (so that there was no longer a group of titles needing to be unified).\n\nThe other Power Comics were all ultimately absorbed into ''Smash'', which became the last survivor. On 14 September 1968, with issue 137, it merged with ''[[Pow! (comics)|Pow!]]'' (which had previously absorbed ''[[Wham! (comics)|Wham]]''), becoming ''Smash and Pow''. On 2 November 1968, with issue&nbsp;144, it merged with ''[[Fantastic (comics)|Fantastic]]'' (which had previously absorbed ''[[Terrific (comics)|Terrific]]''), becoming ''Smash and Pow incorporating Fantastic''.<ref>[https://www.comics.org/series/25870/covers/?page=3 Covers Gallery for 1968] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>\n\nOn 1 January 1969 ''Smash'' ceased to be published by Odhams Press Ltd, and was thereafter published by IPC Magazines Ltd (an IPC subsidiary formed during 1968).

Holiday Special in 1971.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1966 the initial success of ''Wham!'' (which had launched in 1964 and quickly built up strong circulation figures) encouraged Odhams' London management to publish a second title, conceived by Alf Wallace (Managing Editor of Odhams' juveniles \u2014 ''Eagle'', ''Swift'' and ''Boy's World'') and Albert Cosser.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984\">Interview with Leo Baxendale in ''British Comic World'' Issue #3 (June 1984)</ref> Leo Baxendale, who had created ''Wham!'' for Odhams in 1964, was too heavily embroiled with on-going production on it, providing much of the art for each issue, so had little time for anything else. Also, Baxendale was then still working at long range from Dundee.<ref>DC Thompson Ltd, Baxendale's former employers, were based in Dundee, Scotland</ref>\n\nAccordingly, it was Alf Wallace and Albert Cosser (soon to be known to their young audience as Alf and Cos) who determined the initial format of ''Smash!''. They also recruited the artists who would draw the early issues, as it was plain that Baxendale was fully occupied with the art for ''Wham!''. Baxendale's initial contribution to ''Smash'' was thus limited to providing a list of titles and situations for the humour strips, together with brief written scenarios (script ideas for the individual weekly issues), which he gave to Wallace to be farmed-out to other artists. ''The Swots and The Blots'' was one of these.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.4-5\">Interview with Leo Baxendale in ''British Comic World'' Issue #3 (June 1984),p.4-5</ref>\n\nBaxendale was asked only to create the ''Bad Penny'' strip, and to give ''Grimly Feendish'' (a character from his ''Eagle Eye, Junior Spy'' strip then running in ''Wham!'') a strip of his own. Wallace also had Baxendale draw the covers for the first three issues.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.4-5\"/>\n\n''Smash'' launched with the same format as the early issues of ''Wham'', namely 24 pages per issue, four of which were in colour; but it was printed on lower-quality paper than ''Wham''.\n\nThe initial line-up of strips mixed humour and adventure freely, with the comedic ''Ronnie Rich'' featuring on the cover of the first issue, inside which were adventure strips including the World War Two based ''Ghost Patrol'' \u2014 this latter a reprint strip which lasted only until issue 25. ''Ghost Patrol'' proved symptomatic of the problem with British adventure strips which plagued ''Smash'' during the Odhams years, which tended to be ''sloppy in presentation and possessed of little real character or emotion''.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.6\">Interview with Leo Baxendale in ''British Comic World'' Issue #3 (June 1984), p.6</ref>\n\nThe root of the problem with ''Smash'' was that it went through many changes in its early days \u2014 far too many. Particularly in its adventure strips: ''The Ghost Patrol'' came and went; ''The Legend Testers'' came and went; ''Moon Madness'' was particularly short-lived; and there were numerous others, equally forgettable. None proved popular enough to last.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.10</ref> Undeniably, none enjoyed the tremendous popularity of the American superhero strips which the comic would shortly feature, which genuinely had sufficient popularity to rival that of television.<ref>Marvel Comics as an independent UK publisher, in the 1970s, demonstrated that their superhero comics were capable of strong sales even in the face of competition from the newest rival -- colour television. ''Smash'' might have survived into that 1970s era of colour tv if it could have managed to retain its popular superhero strips.</ref>\n\nThose readers old enough to have become emotionally attached to comics before Odhams introduced American superhero strips to British readers tended to dislike those superhero strips.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.10</ref> Whereas, according to the letters pages each week, those same Marvel and DC heroes were enormously popular among the younger age group which had not been reading comics previously. Accordingly, ''Wham'' readers tended to resent the changes made in 1966, because British strips were cancelled in ''Wham'' and replaced with US superheroes, whereas ''Smash'' readers did not resent the superheroes, because in 1966 that comic had only just launched, so there were no real changes \u2014 ''Smash'' more or less teemed with American strips from the very beginning.\n\nThe decision, in 1969, to discontinue the American superhero strips was the real cause of the comic's demise. Other problems would contribute to the difficulties it subsequently faced \u2014 including strikes at its Printers \u2014 but the root cause of those problems was the falling circulation it suffered, which was a consequence of not having any unique elements to distinguish it from other IPC comics such as ''Lion'' and ''Valiant''. The key to understanding the situation is that the superheroes were the only element which genuinely had the necessary popularity to halt the decline in weekly sales caused by the competition from television.\n\n==Odhams Years==\n===Superheroes===\nBlack-and-white reprints of [[Marvel Comics]] strips<ref>All the Marvel stories were written by Stan Lee</ref> were introduced into ''Smash'' with issue&nbsp;16, when the ''[[Hulk|Incredible Hulk]]'' began.<ref>Issue 16 saw the first appearance of Marvel's ''[https://www.comics.org/series/25870/covers/?page=1 Incredible Hulk]'' strip, drawn by [[Jack Kirby]]</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2015/02/smash-first-20-covers.html|title=BLIMEY!

In July&nbsp;1967 ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]''<ref>Drawn at various times by Bill Everett, Wally Wood and Gene Colan</ref> replaced the Hulk, from issue&nbsp;76 onwards \u2014 ''Smash'' having exhausted all Hulk stories, from all sources, which had been published in the USA up to that time.\n\nIt's hard to overstate the significance of the introduction of ''The Hulk'', in the issue dated 21 May 1966. It was the first ''Marvel Comics'' strip featured by Odhams, the success of which led to the introduction of ''Fantastic Four'' into ''Wham'' on 6 August of that year, and to the launching of two entire comics entirely dedicated to Marvel superheroes \u2014 ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'' \u2014 in 1967. The Hulk's initial appearance in ''Smash'' took up a massive 6 pages, one-quarter of each 24 page issue, pushing fully five existing strips out of that issue, and causing the permanent cancellation of \"Space Jinx\" and \"Brian's Brain\" (although the latter would be revived much later).<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.11\">British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.11</ref>\n\nPrior to this, [[DC Comics|DC]]'s ''[[Batman (comic strip)|Batman]]'' had become the second American superhero to debut in ''Smash'', crashing onto the front cover of issue&nbsp;20 a month after the Hulk's debut, in re-edited reprints from American daily and Sunday newspaper strips: these were credited in-page to ''Batman'' creator Bob Kane, but were actually drawn by [[Al Plastino]] and ghost-written by [[Whitney Ellsworth]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comics.org/issue/368494/|title=GCD :: Issue :: Smash! #75|website=www.comics.org}}</ref> This was a response to the sudden and enormous popularity of the ''Batman'' television series starring Adam West. The impact of this hit TV show led to the ''Batman'' strip retaining the front cover of ''Smash'', in colour, for better than a year and a half, entitled ''Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder''.\n\nInitially, this syndicated newspaper strip adopted the camp style of the Adam West television series, with appearances by humorous guest stars such as American funnyman [[Jack Benny]]. In the later part of the run (which featured serious, rather than camp, stories) Batgirl, too, appeared in the strip, a response to her addition to the TV show in its 3rd season: in the newspaper strip, Batman initially believed her to be a criminal rather than a crime fighter. Superman then co-starred in the strip, which was retitled ''Superman and Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder'', as Batman and Robin attempt to save Superman from the diabolical Professor Zinkk who was secretly poisoning him with kryptonite.\n\nThe expansion of the American content, with the arrival of ''Batman'', meant the loss of two more of the initial British strips: the adventure strip ''The Ghost Patrol'', and the cartoon strip ''The Tellybugs''.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.11\"/>\n\nIn September 1968 the ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' began a six-month run in ''Smash'', when it absorbed ''Pow'' (which had previously merged with ''Wham'', in which the strip had initially featured). As one of only a handful of ''Pow'' strips to survive the merger, it was used to lure ''Pow'' readers to the new comic. The strip was introduced to readers of ''Smash'' with the wedding of Reed and Sue from ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #3. Their adventures continued with ''Defeated by the Frightful Four'', and ran through to ''Lo There Shall Be an Ending'', which was the final Marvel strip to appear in ''Smash''.\n\n''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' began a short run in November 1968 when ''Smash'' absorbed ''Fantastic''. The stories, continued from ''Fantastic'', began with ''The Ringmaster's Circus of Crime''. When the Marvel strips were discontinued the following spring, the final ''Thor'' reprint had a new ending substituted, in a rushed attempt to resolve a continuing sub-plot.\n\nThe financial crisis which overtook Odhams in 1968, resulting in the closure of all the other ''Power Comics'', also caused them to give up the expensive licence to reprint the Marvel superhero stories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/m/marvuk.htm|title=Marvel UK|website=www.internationalhero.co.uk}}</ref> This decision took effect in March&nbsp;1969, when the licence came up for renewal; the final Marvel strips appeared in issue&nbsp;162. The expensive ''Batman'' newspaper strip had already been discontinued, ending in issue&nbsp;157.\n\n===Odhams Humour Strips===\nThere were typically a dozen British humour strips in each of the first 162 issues.\n\nThe initial line-up starred ''The Man From B.U.N.G.L.E.'', which usually occupied the front cover prior to issue&nbsp;20,<ref>''Smash'': [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2015/02/smash-first-20-covers.html The first 20 covers]</ref> supported by seven other long-running humour strips (''Charlie's Choice'',<ref name=\"Brian Lewis\">Drawn by [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html Brian Lewis]</ref> ''Bad Penny'',<ref name=\"Leo Baxendale\">Drawn by [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html Leo Baxendale]</ref> ''Percy's Pets'',<ref>Drawn by [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html Stan McMurtry]</ref> ''The Nervs'',<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html|title=BLIMEY!

It is unclear why Alf and Cos chose this deeply unfunny strip for what must have been considered the pride of place in the new comic. ''Space Jinx'' was primarily another ''Jonah'' (a strip by Ken Reid which had run in ''The Beano''), except that it could not hold its own against the brilliance of Reid's sea-faring twit. Where ''Jonah'' dealt with sinking ships of the sea, Brian Lewis's ''Space Jinx'' dealt with similar situations in outer space, but (in practice) without the necessary degree of humour.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.7\">British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.7</ref>\n\nKen Reid's ''Queen of the Seas'' would last only slightly longer, at 43 issues. A masterpiece of comic artistry, telling the story of the ''Buoyant Queen'' and its two-man crew, Enoch and Bert, a pair of oafs with a love/hate relationship (mostly hate!), it was perhaps too intelligent for its target audience \u2014 its disappearance was a great loss to the comic.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.7\"/> Many readers failed to understand, amongst many things in the strip that went clear over their heads, that the two main characters were drawn in the likeness of comedians [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Oliver Hardy]], and that the strip's humour was based on the movies of Laurel & Hardy.\n\nAfter only five months \u2013 foreshadowing many, many reshuffles to come \u2013 ''Smash!'' underwent its first major overhaul: from issue&nbsp;20 the ''Batman'' newspaper strip took over the front cover, whilst ''Grimly Feendish'' lost the colour back cover to Reid's ''Queen of the Seas'' (which shrank from its original two pages each week to only a single page \u2014 the loss of the extra page was a drawback, but was compensated for by the strip now having a more prestigious location in the comic, and of course by now being in colour).\n\nFurther cover changes would follow. When, after two years, the popularity of the ''Batman'' television series eventually faded, from issue&nbsp;114 onward Batman and Robin were moved to the inside pages, yielding the front cover to the long-running success ''The Swots and the Blots'', at this point still being drawn by Mike Lacey, a humour strip in which two rival gangs vied to outwit each other at Pond Road School, with \"Teach\" caught in the crossfire. Its origins lay in Baxendale's classroom-based strip ''The Tiddlers'', which had then been running for 2 years in ''Wham''<ref>In fact it was a direct continuation of ''[https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2015/04/21/wham/ The Tiddlers]'', with only a change of name. The characters (i.e. \"Teach\" and the Blots), school buildings, and situations, were all largely as they had been in ''The Tiddlers''. The only difference was the addition of the Swots, so that Teach now had an ally.</ref> (and which continued in ''Pow'' when ''Wham'' merged with it in 1968, where it was combined with ''The Dolls of St Dominics'' to become ''The Tiddlers and The Dolls'').\n\n''The Swots and the Blots'' was one of the few strips in ''Smash'' to survive all the changes of 1969 and 1970, reaching a new standard of excellence when [[Leo Baxendale]] began drawing it for the new-look ''Smash'' from March 1969, but even during the Odhams years it had wit and a sense of style. In Baxendale's hands it had notable similarities to his earlier classroom-based strip, ''The Bash Street Kids'', in ''[[The Beano]]''.<ref>Around 1968, Baxendale quit Odhams for the better paying ''Fleetway'' comics. One of the strips he produced there was ''[http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2017/07/leo-baxendales-big-chief-pow-wow.html Big Chief Pow Wow]'' for ''Buster''\u2014the strip ran from 14 September 1968 to 31 January 1970 (some issues were fill-ins by other artists).</ref>\n\n''The Man from BUNGLE'', spoofing the popular TV series ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'', was a spin-off from Baxendale's ''Eagle-Eye Junior Spy'' strip in ''Wham''. BUNGLE was a secret spy organisation in Britain, organised along more chaotic lines than UNCLE, featuring a secret agent who employed a wide variety of hugely unlikely gadgets in his fight against his humorous opponents. Baxendale himself drew the first few editions, which appeared as large single illustrations on some of the early covers of ''Smash'', after which Mike Lacey took over.\n\nThe second spin-off from Baxendale's ''Eagle-Eye'' strip was ''[[Grimly Feendish]]'' (subtitled ''The Rottenest Crook in the World''), which Leo Baxendale himself drew. Feendish had been the most popular character in the earlier strip, thanks to his ghoulish appearance, which was based on Uncle Fester in the American television series ''[[The Addams Family]]'' (and, presumably, on Charles Adams' illustrations from which the TV series was derived).<ref>Interestingly, the strip would probably have been ''banned'' if this had been an American comic, as the [[Comics Code Authority]] prohibited presentation of crime in comics if it tended to create sympathy for the criminal, and this strip appears to fall foul of that restriction.</ref> The new strip at one point occupied a prestigious position, as the full-colour back cover feature each week, and survived throughout the entire run of 162 issues published by Odhams (even though, after giving up its cover status, it was sometimes ignominiously reduced to only a quarter-page \"filler\").\n\n''Bad Penny'' was another memorable Baxendale creation. Its title logo featured a portrait of Penny herself, alongside the 'Bad Penny' caption, and an illustration of a giant pre-decimal One Penny coin (the coin suggesting the connection with the proverb from which the character's name originated).\n\nShe had some similarities with Baxendale's earlier Minnie the Minx character in ''The Beano''. When he had been drawing Minnie, he had concentrated on experimenting with facial expressions and character traits. By the time he began working on ''Bad Penny'' his drawing style had matured, with an equal concentration on developing a zany but tight storyline, less emphasis on close-ups of facial expressions, but retaining the essentials needed to put over a character's own personality traits.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.6\"/>\n\nBad Penny was so popular that she survived the changes of 1969, and continued to appear in the new ''Smash''. When the strip was eventually dropped, in 1970, Bad Penny herself still continued to appear, albeit infrequently, making occasional appearances in Baxendale's ''The Swots and the Blots'' as a new member of the Blots.\n\nAs had happened in ''Wham'', artists such as Mike Lacey were commissioned from time to time to \"ghost\" Baxendale's style. Baxendale was allowed to sign his early work on ''Smash'', so there is a way to distinguish which strips he personally drew during his time at Odhams.<ref name=\"The Power Comics: Wham!\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817075207/http://26pigs.com/wham/index.html|title=26Pigs.com : UK Comics : Wham!|date=17 August 2018|website=web.archive.org}}</ref><ref>In practice, Baxendale signed very few of his strips, so it is quite difficult to tell which are his and which are other artists substituting for him.</ref> After he transferred to Fleetway, another IPC subsidiary, he still contributed strips to ''Smash'', but now worked \"undercover\", i.e. without signing them. He explained this in his autobiography, ''A Very Funny Business'' (Duckworth, 1978, page&nbsp;91): \"I was in a delightful situation. Working under my own name, a lot was expected of me. Publishers ''expected'' me to cram my drawings with funny detail. A double standard operated. Working undercover, I was able to reduce the layouts to the simplest terms. Backgrounds were minimal or non-existent \u2014 just a horizon line. And there was no ancillary comic detail \u2014 just the characters acting out the story line against an empty backdrop.\"\n\nThe most bizarre of the Odhams humour strips was ''The Nervs'', depicting a group of little characters inhabiting a schoolboy called Fatty: the strip showed them running Fatty like a group of workers running a factory. Allocated two pages, it followed the same formula as the strip ''Georgie's Germs'' from ''Wham!''. Fatty was aptly named, with the tiny Nervs battling to save the fat twerp's stomach from its numerous overloads, as a minute never passed which was free from him guzzling!\n\nDrawn for the majority of its run by Graham Allen,<ref name=\"auto2\"/> in its final months during 1968-69 [[Ken Reid (comics artist)|Ken Reid]]<ref>Comics artist [http://britishcomicart.blogspot.com/search/label/Ken%20Reid Ken Reid]</ref> \u2014 previously of ''Queen of the Seas'', and who had earlier contributed the ''Dare-a-Day Davy''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crazedchimp.co.uk/dadd.htm|title=Ken Reid's Dare A Day Davy|website=www.crazedchimp.co.uk}}</ref> strip to ''Pow'' \u2014 drew this double-page feature.\n\nReid's career had begun at ''The Beano'' in the 1950s, but for Odhams he had already produced the long running success ''Frankie Stein'', in ''Wham!'', before taking on ''Queen of the Seas'' in the early issues of ''Smash!'' and the  ''Dare-A-Day Davy'' strip in ''Pow!''.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.7\"/> He turned ''The Nervs'' into an extremely surreal, even visceral, strip; achieving a rare level of hilarity and bawdiness, in a subversive presentation of comical horror \u2014 and in the process alarming IPC's management !<ref name=\"Career history of artist Ken Reid\"/>\n\nHe already had some degree of notoriety, as being the only Odhams artist whose work so disturbed the management that it was actually banned.<ref>[http://www.savoy.abel.co.uk/HTML/weird1.html Review] of the banned ''Dare-A-Day Davy'' Frankenstein strip</ref><ref>''Dare-A-Day Davy'' [http://www.savoy.abel.co.uk/HTML/picts2.html Frankenstein strip], published in ''Weird Fantasy''&nbsp;#1 in 1969</ref> At the suggestion of Vance Gledhill of Blackpool, Davy was dared to dig up Frankenstein's monster (in the ''Dare-A-Day Davy'' strip) and bring him back to life \u2013 for which Reid decided to employ the \"kiss of life\"!

This was a device for featuring, as guest stars in the strip each week, an assortment of popular TV stars. The strip's debut appearance, for instance, featured Robert Vaughn and David McCallum, stars of top-rated secret agent show ''The Man From UNCLE'', maximising their appearance by splashing them across the front cover. It was hoped that by bringing popular television stars into its pages, this would make TV's growing popularity work ''for'' the comic \u2014 a not very subtle ploy to boost its circulation and sales.\n\n''Sammy Shrink'' (subtitled ''The Smallest Boy in the World'')<ref name=\"auto3\"/> was a humour strip about a boy who was only two inches tall. Sammy had the most successful \u2014 but also the most chequered \u2014 career of all the characters featured in ''Smash'', having originated in ''Wham'', then moved to ''Pow'' when they merged, arriving in ''Smash'' when it in turn absorbed ''Pow'', and would subsequently be revived in ''Knockout'', finally ending his career in ''Whizzer and Chips'' when it absorbed ''Knockout'' in June&nbsp;1973.\n\n''Ronnie Rich'' featured the richest kid in the world, who stands to inherit a fortune if only he can get rid of the money he's got. Drawn by Gordon Hogg,<ref name=\"auto2\"/> each week Ronnie spent his every last penny, in some reckless or extravagant way, only to have his scheme backfire and make him richer than ever. He never did get his hands on the fortune.\n\nOften a half-page feature, ''Percy's Pets'' drawn by Stan McMurtry (alias Mac)<ref>Comics artist [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1040731/Macs-secret-lady-Britains-cartoonist-reveals-hidden-images-wife.html Stan McMurtry]</ref> was popular enough to go on to make sporadic reappearances from time to time in the new ''Smash'' after March&nbsp;1969. Percy was a small plump schoolboy, who filled his family's home with his exotic collection of pets. These included (from time to time) an elephant, a giraffe, a hippopotamus, a snake, an ape \u2014 in fact almost every type of animal that might be found in a typical zoo \u2014 together with a parrot, a tortoise, a white mouse, and a hedgehog; thereby causing a predictable degree of comical chaos for his long suffering mum and dad.\n\nSome of the best-remembered strips were not included in all of the first 162 issues: a number of them were only acquired in #137, from the merger with ''Pow!'' (which had already absorbed the most popular strips running in ''Wham!'').\n\nOne such acquisition from ''Pow!'' was ''The Cloak''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crazedchimp.co.uk/cloak.htm|title=Mike Higgs' The Cloak|website=www.crazedchimp.co.uk}}</ref> \u2014 like ''The Man From BUNGLE'', another humorous secret agent strip. The Cloak was the top agent for Britain's Special Squad, nominally a part of Scotland Yard; but he usually operated from his personal headquarters, known as the Secret Sanctum. His ingenuity and never-ending supply of gadgets and secret weapons gave him the edge over his somewhat odd enemies (some were ''very'' odd, including Deathshead and various other agents of G.H.O.U.L.).\n\nHe had some equally odd colleagues. Assisted initially by Mole (the tall one with the bald head, big nose and specs) and Shortstuff (the short squirt with the hairy nut and big eyeballs), he then began having adventures in which he found himself also alongside the sexy and flirtatious Lady Shady, the shady lady. The strip benefited from the unusual, idiosyncratic drawing style of Mike Higgs, whose overt inclusion of pop culture imagery made the strip seem extremely modern.\n\n''Wiz War'', drawn by Mike Brown, had also begun in ''Pow!'', and would be one of a handful of strips to survive the changes of 1969. Brown seems to have been unaware of the house rule banning artists from signing their work, as the strip often bore his name. The \"War\" in the title referred to a feud between two wizards, Wizard Prang and his enemy Demon Druid. Being a humour strip, the editorial staff allowed the hero the very silly name of Wizard Prang, a piece of RAF slang from the Second World War.\n\nOther than the fact that Prang was robed entirely in white, befitting his status as the good guy, and Demon Druid was always in black, being the villain of the piece, their costumes were quite similar - a flowing wizard's robe with stars on, and a pointed hat. They would fly around on broomsticks, zapping each other with spells: which turned the other into a toad, or something equally amusing. Wizard Prang was alternately helped and hindered by Englebert, his pet bird. The best feature of the strip was the sign above Wizard Prang's front door. This usually read \"Wizard Prang is... In\" (if he was at home) or \"Wizard Prang is... Out\" (if he was out and about); but if he'd had a bad time in the story, the sign would often make a humorous remark in the final panel, such as \"Wizard Prang is... All At Sea\".\n\nThe secret of Mike Brown, unacknowledged for many years, was that Leo Baxendale needed to earn money from Odhams without disclosing to Fleetway that he was now working for both companies. Accordingly, Baxendale now pencilled the drawings, and Brown, who was a cartoon film animator, inked them in. In this way, they turned out together large numbers of ''Bad Penny'' and ''Grimly Feendish'' strips, which they sold to Odhams under Brown's name \u2014 a situation Baxendale referred to, in his 1978 autobiography, as working ''undercover''.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984),p.10</ref>\n\nLost in the merger with ''Pow'' were ''Charlie's Choice'', ''Ronnie Rich'' and ''The Man From BUNGLE''. Also lost in this merger, in effect, was Ken Reid's ''Dare-A-Day Davey'' strip, one of several established features in ''Pow'' which were dropped instead of transferring to ''Smash''.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.15</ref>\n\n===Odhams Adventure Strips===\n\nAs ''Smash'' was essentially a superhero and humour comic during the Odhams years, there were few traditional adventure strips in it; but a handful do bear special mention.\n\nThere were various well-remembered adventure strips in the first hundred issues, including some which were quite outstanding, such as ''Rubberman'', ''Experiment X'', ''The Legend Testers'', and ''The Python''.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nFrom issue 144 in November 1968 ''Smash'' was the only surviving ''Power Comic'', as this was the issue in which ''Smash and Pow'' (as it then was) merged with ''Fantastic''. Five British adventure serials were introduced in this issue, to plug the gap left by the loss of the withdrawn American superhero strips which had been major features of the four closed titles.\n\n''At Night Stalks... The Spectre'' is an adventure strip in which a crime reporter on the Daily Globe newspaper is apparently killed while investigating a news story. The world believes newspaperman Jim Jordan is dead, but he still carries on his crusade against crime... calling himself The Spectre.\n\nHe is now fighting crime, rather than merely reporting it, using an array of gadgets which make it seem he is the ghost of the missing reporter. Hence his opponents are terrified to find that if they shoot him he doesn't die (a bullet-proof raincoat was the trick here). And he has a secret underground hideout beneath the statue erected in his memory, from which he would covertly and unexpectedly emerge, or disappear into, under cover of an artificial fog, to give the impression he was coming and going from the spirit world. His first case began in issue&nbsp;144, in which he tracks down Black Murdo, the racketeer who the world believes had murdered him.\n\n''Destination Danger'', a motor racing serial, also began in issue&nbsp;144. This strip was about a feud between a young English racing driver, Jeff Jackson, who was working for Puma Motors in the US, and his enemy Vic Stafford, the Puma team's chief driver, who has taken a bribe to throw a forthcoming race.\n\nAlthough new to ''Smash'', the old-fashioned artwork in the strips ''At Night Stalks... The Spectre'' and ''Destination Danger'' marked them out as reprints. The use of reprints was a cost-cutting measure, indicating the straightened financial circumstances of ''Smash'' at this point \u2013 if any evidence were needed beyond the closure of all four of the other ''Power Comics''.\n\n''Laird of the Apes'' was a science fiction strip, milking the popularity of the big budget Charlton Heston motion picture ''Planet of the Apes'' which was released earlier that year. In the strip, set in the 18th century, a young Scottish laird returns to the Highlands to aid his outlaw clansmen in their struggle with the English Redcoats, bringing with him a band of highly trained Apes.\n\nAn adventure strip with a sporting theme was the wrestling serial ''King of the Ring'', featuring Ken King, who was a champion of the grunt-'n'-grapple game (although in the earliest strips he had begun as a boxer). As was not exactly uncommon in the Odhams years, there was a tendency to give the characters very silly names. The most outrageous example in this strip was King's manager, who (in spite of ''not'' being Irish) was called Blarney Stone!\n\nBlarney's real name was originally Tim Stone, and Blarney was only a nickname; but this was soon forgotten. In order to fulfil Ken's ambition to travel, Blarney agrees to manage him on a world tour, if he'll agree to fight his way round the world!\n\nThe fifth adventure strip added was ''Brian's Brain'', drawn by Bert Vandeput,<ref name=\"auto2\"/> a serial with science fiction elements, continued from ''Pow''. This featured two schoolboys: the eponymous Brian and his friend Duffy Rolls. Brian Kingsley possessed an electronic Brain resembling a human skull, which he carried about in a box. It could communicate with him telepathically, glowing when active; and it could control the actions of animals if they were within a few yards, which was the limit of its brain-wave transmissions.\n\nAll five strips commenced in issue&nbsp;144; and all were serials, with cliff-hanger endings each week.\n\n===The Closure of the ''Power Comics''===\nWhat must always be born in mind is that, in the comics industry, the 1960s were not the 1930s. With the advent in Britain of commercial television, in 1955 \u2014 displacing the staid, old-fashioned children's television offered by the BBC up to that point \u2014 the ever-increasing competition from the ''boob-tube'' began a continuous (and accelerating) decline in comics circulation. Throughout the 1960s, in consequence, the circulation wars fought in the comics publishing industry were fought out against a backdrop of ever-declining circulation figures.\n\nFollowing the initial success of ''Wham'' in 1964, Odhams had launched four more [[Power Comics]] during 1966 and '67, including ''Smash'', only to close them in quick succession: merging each in turn into the survivors until by 1969 only ''Smash'' remained. Whereas 1968 began with all five ''Power Comics'' apparently flourishing, by the year's end only ''Smash'' was still being published.<ref name=\"The Power Comics: Wham!\"/> Even the sleepiest of readers began to notice that something was seriously wrong, as the increasingly frantic series of mergers resulted in ever more ludicrous titles, culminating in the astonishing ''Smash and Pow incorporating Fantastic'' (commonly spoofed as ''Smash, Pow, Wham, incorporating Fantastic and Terrific'').\n\nThe question is why, in a limited market such as the UK, they took such a big risk as to launch five titles (which in hindsight looks an unwise decision by the Odhams management), if it was so quickly obvious that the market could only support one? It has been suggested<ref name=\"lewstringer.blogspot.co.uk\"/> that it was common practice for a publisher to quickly clone a successful title, in order to forestall its competitors from doing so. That does not seem to be the case here. The comic's only distinctive feature was its American superhero strips, so ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'' (which most of the time contained ''only'' Marvel superhero strips) might loosely be described as clones of ''Smash'', even though they lacked any humour strips; but IPC had an ''exclusive'' licence from Marvel Comics to reprint Marvel's strips in the UK, which precluded anyone else from doing so.\n\nThe actual answer lies in the unexpected nature of the economic crisis of 1968 that hit the British economy, resulting in the devaluation of the Pound.<ref>In Britain, the devaluation crisis was major news due to certain ill-judged remarks by Prime Minister Harold Wilson, who would be mocked for the rest of his career for his infamous falsehood, ''This will not affect the Pound in your pocket!''</ref> The economic chaos began with a Sterling crisis in Britain in 1967, leading to devaluation in the November. There then followed a crisis for the U.S. dollar in March&nbsp;1968 which had a cascade effect on the international economic system, sending first the French franc and then the West German deutschmark into devaluation, and culminating in a ''new'' Sterling crisis in Britain in November&nbsp;1968.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2170396 ''The Economic Crisis of 1968''] \u2013 published in ''American Historical Review''</ref><ref>Article, [http://www.wsws.org/articles/2005/dec2005/mccar-d30.shtml ''Eugene McCarthy \u2013 pivotal role in 1968 Political Crisis'']</ref>\n\nThese repeated falls in the value of the Pound against the U.S. dollar significantly increased the cost of publishing the American strips, which had to be paid for in dollars, and raised the daunting spectre of further increases if the Pound fell in value yet again. Increasing the cover price of the ''Power Comics'' to compensate was impossible because of stiff competition (with sales on a sharp downward spiral, as circulation fell victim to the ever increasing popularity of television); so the fall in the value of Sterling made the American strips unaffordable.\n\nThe toughness of the competition is apparent from examining other contemporary titles.<ref>Cover galleries on the [https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/ British Comics] website</ref> The first issue of its stablemate ''Fantastic'', published in February 1967, cost 9d for 40 pages (due to its very high content of American superhero strips), a cover price which forced ''Fantastic'' to close within 18 months. ''Terrific'', having the same high content of American material, also had a high cover price of 9d, and closed even quicker.\n\nIn contrast, the comics ''Dandy'' and ''Beano'' published by the rival [[D. C. Thomson & Co.|DC Thomson]] organisation sold at a cover price of 3d. ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'' cost three times as much, which (even with double the number of pages compared to many DC Thomson titles) proved unsustainable. This is not surprising, given that ''Wham'' and ''Pow'' each peaked at a cover price of 7d, and even that proved unsustainable.\n\n''Smash'' had launched in February&nbsp;1966 with a cover price of 7d for 24&nbsp;pages. By March&nbsp;1969, although its cover price had not changed, circumstances had conspired to increase its page count, such that each issue now contained 36&nbsp;pages. In fact the page count jumped overnight from 24 pages to 36 pages (a fifty percent increase), with a consequent sharp rise in production costs, and so a marked decline in profit-per-copy.\n\nThe tipping point was issue 144, in which ''Smash'', ''Pow'' and ''Fantastic'' were merged into a single title. The recently created ''Smash and Pow'' lost its ''Daredevil'' and ''Spider-Man'' strips, which together had comprised a full third of each 24 page issue, but now had to accommodate both ''Thor'' and ''Fantastic Four'' from the discontinued titles, plus a whole slew of new British adventure strips (which were being added in preparation for the comic's impending transition to solely-British content).\n\nAll this could not be achieved within the standard ''Smash'' format of 24 pages. So IPC now \"bit the bullet\" and increased the page count, at a single bound, by fifty percent \u2014 a necessity if they were to achieve their intention of reproducing with ''Smash'' the successful formula which was buoying-up sales of their most popular titles, ''Lion'' and ''Valiant'', both of which were 36-pagers (in effect, to produce another clone of them: an identical mix of adventure and humour, with an identical page count, at an identical price).\n\nOne fundamental difficulty for the ''Power Comics'', however, was always the stark economic truth that a kid could buy both ''The Dandy'' and ''The Beano'', at 3d each, and still have change left over, for what it cost to buy ''Smash!'', ''Wham!'' or ''Pow!'' at 7d each. However, the DC Thomson titles only had 16 pages, and this more than anything drove up the page count in ''Smash!'', from its original 24 pages to 36 pages, and eventually to 40 pages in 1970 (i.e. it might be more than double the price of a DC Thomson title but it was also more than double the size).<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.9</ref> The difficulty was that the much lower price of ''The Dandy'' and ''The Beano'' gave those titles a significant advantage, since a kid could choose to buy only one of them, at 3d \u2014 a winning competitive advantage which, as of 1966, would keep both of the DC Thomson titles afloat for more than 30 years to come.\n\nThe highly competitive nature of the UK's publishing industry meant margins were thin: a minimum number of sales each week were needed to reach break-even point, and the lower the cover price, the greater was the number of sales needed to reach that point; but the higher the cover price, the fewer were the number of sales that could actually be achieved.\n\nThe juvenile readers (or their parents) might be able to afford two or three comics a week, but by publishing five ''Power Comics'' IPC were pricing themselves out of the market. For the situation in Britain was not like that in America, where, with comics published just once a month, a child might afford five titles. In Britain, comics were published weekly.\n\nUnder those conditions the ''Power Comics'' were effectively competing with each other \u2014 a factor IPC were certainly aware of, as the letters pages in ''Smash'', in 1968, actually carried readers' complaints that they couldn't afford all five ''Power'' titles. The five together cost an astonishing three shillings and threpence a week (39d), to buy them all, far beyond the reach of the average child's weekly pocket money.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.13</ref>\n\nThe ''Power Comics'' were also competing with IPC's other titles, including [[Lion (comics)|Lion]], [[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]] and [[Buster (comics)|Buster]], potentially dragging the Group's entire line into bankruptcy. Rationalisation, by closing some of the titles, would produce an overall benefit, as it would dramatically cut IPC's production costs. Although it would mean fewer titles, as IPC's comics were actually competing against each other it ought to result in better sales for the survivors. In theory, there would be no overall loss of sales or revenue, provided readers switched from the closing titles to surviving IPC ones (rather than to rival [[D. C. Thomson & Co.|DC Thomson]] ones).\n\nAnother factor Odhams had not anticipated was the distribution of American comic books within the UK. Although this had always been a consideration, the volume of such comics arriving in Britain had traditionally been small, and their distribution haphazard. In 1968, distribution and quantity suddenly underwent a marked improvement: in America, Marvel Comics' owner, Martin Goodman, pulled off a business coup that overnight freed Marvel from a restrictive distribution agreement, which for a decade had limited it to publishing only 8 titles a month: Marvel was suddenly quadrupeling its monthly output, and dozens of new titles were flooding into Britain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://emagazinepdf.com/2017/05/marvel_comics_-_the_untold_story/|title=''Marvel Comics \u2014 The Untold Story'', Sean Howe (2012)}}</ref> Odhams' black-and-white [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] reprints in their ''Power Comics'' range suddenly faced much more extensive competition from four-colour Marvel originals, and this began to harm sales.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2009/03/40-year-flashback-smash-regenerates.html|title=BLIMEY! The Blog of British Comics: 40 Year Flashback: SMASH! regenerates|first=Lew|last=Stringer|date=8 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn the turbulent economic conditions, any part of IPC's business which was loss-making had no future. Standard industry practice was to close a comic or magazine if its revenues dipped ''towards'' the break-even point; publishers did not wait for a title to actually incur losses.<ref name=\"lewstringer.blogspot.co.uk\"/> Hence, merely to anticipate losses on the other four titles (''Pow'', ''Wham'', ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'') was enough to doom them. And the closures represented a major cost-cutting exercise, reducing the ongoing production costs on the ''Power Comics'' line by four-fifths.\n\nAs for actual losses incurred due to the sudden and unexpected nature of the problem, and the inability to quickly terminate the long-term contracts with the Americans, ''Smash'' as sole survivor couldn't hope to generate enough income on its own to meet these. In fact it didn't need to. The fortunate circumstance that the ''Power Comics'' were all published by Odhams Press Ltd, a subsidiary company with limited liability, meant that it was possible to ring-fence all debts on the Odhams publications within that one company, thus preventing any losses affecting the rest of the IPC Group (since IPC's other titles were all published by other IPC subsidiaries). Accordingly, with effect from 1 January 1969 ''Smash'' was transferred to IPC Magazines Ltd, a new IPC subsidiary formed during 1968,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comics.org/publisher/1946/|title=GCD :: Publisher :: IPC|website=www.comics.org}}</ref> leaving Odhams with no continuing titles, and ''Smash'' started again from scratch.<ref>[http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk//companysearch?disp=1&frfsh=1414205283&#result Odhams Press Ltd] continued in being until 7 January 1998, when it changed its name to Formpart (No.11) Limited, which still exists today; currently a dormant private company.</ref>\n\nDespite being the longest survivor, and inheriting many popular strips from the other four titles, ''Smash'' was only a limited success. It was plainly on shakey ground: for, hard on the heels of the closure of the other titles, in the spring of 1969 IPC quickly made extensive changes to it, dropping the last remaining Marvel superhero strips, to shed the expense of the licensing fee for using them (having already dropped ''Batman''), and ending many other strips too.\n\nIn consequence of the decision to discontinue the American reprints, as each ''Power Comic'' closed its superhero strips were given up. Only in the case of ''Fantastic'', where the existing contract with Marvel had some months to run, were those strips transferred to its replacement, the merged ''Smash incorporating Fantastic'', until the contract expired in March&nbsp;1969.\n\n''Smash'' then introduced a new cover feature, new strips, and free gifts. In all but name it was a new comic. Even so, it required yet another major shakeup 12 months later, in the spring of 1970, when further changes of editorial policy were imposed by new owners Reed International, who had bought out IPC that year. This resulted, among other things, in the dropping of the newly introduced ''Warriors of the World'' cover feature in favour of a new lead serial: an adventure series entitled ''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test''.\n\nWithin the British market, boys' comics for the age group which was too old for titles such as ''Beano'', ''Dandy'' and ''Sparky'' tended to focus around adventure, sport and war (in titles such as ''Lion'' and ''Valiant''), or humour (in titles such as ''Buster''). In abandoning its superheroes, ''Smash'' sought to attract readers of both types, by offering traditional adventure as well as humour.\n\nTo place these changes in context, the ''Power Comics'' were not the only casualties of the turmoil at IPC in 1969. Hulton's long-running adventure comic ''Eagle'' was also cancelled, merging with Fleetway's ''Lion'' from 2 May 1969. The merged comic was known briefly as ''Lion and Eagle'', but quickly reverted simply to ''Lion''. The humour comic, ''Giggle'', aimed at the slightly younger market dominated by Fleetway's ''Buster'', was also dropped, being merged into ''Buster'' in the spring of 1969 to form ''Buster and Giggle''. As ever, the name change lasted only long enough to absorb the discontinued comic's readership: the reference to ''Giggle'' failed to see out the year, and by December the title had reverted to simply ''Buster'' once more.<ref>''Buster'' [https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2018/10/29/buster-60s/ cover gallery] at Wordpress.com</ref> And ''Buster'', like ''Smash'', also now became a publication of the Group's newest subsidiary, IPC Magazines Ltd.\n\nThe surviving titles at both Odhams and at Fleetway were now transferred to a merged operation, at New Year 1969, as merely a part of IPC's newest division, IPC Magazines Ltd, and were placed under the responsibility of Jack Legrand, formerly the Managing Editor of Fleetway's juvenile publications.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.17</ref>\n\nA notable feature of the Odhams years was how few advertisements the comic carried. There were occasional quarter-page inserts, mainly advertising foreign Postage Stamps for stamp collectors, or Subbuteo table-football; but they were few and far between, and their combined total didn't usually exceed one page per issue. Reflecting its financial problems, the relaunched comic under IPC Magazines carried a significantly greater amount of advertising. One obvious change was the back cover (the only in-colour page apart from the front cover), which gradually began to carry colourful full-page advertisements. On the inside pages, too, there was a much more noticeable quantity of adverts: each issue typically carried 4 full-page ads, plus two half-page ads. It was a noticeable feature of the relaunch that the comic now expanded to 40 pages, in order to cope with the need to carry an extra 4 pages of advertising in each issue.<ref>Cover galleries on the [https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2019/04/13/smash/ British Comics] website</ref>\n\nThis was a potentially significant new strategy, and a major change of policy. No longer did the profitability of the comic rest exclusively with the income derived from its sales figures. That sales income was now supplemented by advertising revenue, and without even having to sacrifice any significant amount of page space, nor cancel any strips, thanks to adding the additional pages.\n\n===Turmoil in 1967===\nThe events of 1968 were not even the first threat to the survival of the ''Power Comics''. Odhams had faced their first serious crisis in May 1967.\nThe editorial page warned readers in issue 68 that ''Smash'', initially printed by St Clements Press Ltd of London, had to find new printers within one month, or face closure. In the event, Odhams were able to sign a contract with Southernprint Ltd of Poole in Dorset in time to maintain publication.\n\n==''SMASH'' after Odhams==\n\nIn January 1969 Odhams ceased to exist as a publishing imprint, and ''Smash'' now became an IPC Magazines publication. Most of the consequences of the change didn't become apparent until the issue cover-dated 15 March, in which the comic changed dramatically. IPC had waited three months to relaunch ''Smash'', because, on the one hand, it needed some lead-time in which to ready new strips, and, on the other, in the publishing industry Spring was traditionally considered a good time to launch a new (in this case, a virtually new) comic.<ref name=\"lewstringer.blogspot.co.uk\"/>\n\nWith the re-launch, ''Smash'' became the last ever British comic to feature a variety mix of adventure, humour and sports themed stories. Subsequent boys' comics featured exclusively sports, or war, or humour; such as ''[[Scorcher (magazine)|Scorcher and Score]]'' and ''[[Shoot (football magazine)|Shoot]]'' (which featured only soccer), and ''[[Action (comics)|Action]]'' and ''[[Battle Picture Weekly|Battle]]'' (which featured only war stories).<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817075250/http://26pigs.com/smash/index.html|title=26Pigs.com : UK Comics : Smash|date=17 August 2018|website=web.archive.org}}</ref>  A hallmark of this policy was to be the even-handedness with which the editorial staff drew the multitude of reprint strips featured in the new ''Smash'' from both ''Lion'' and ''Buster'', in seeking to appeal to readers of both (i.e. mixing serious and humorous strips without discrimination).\n\nThe symbol of the change was the new cover feature, ''Warriors of the World''. This now replaced ''The Swots and Blots'', who, drawn by Mike Lacey, had occupied the cover during the final part of the Odhams years. Happily, ''The Swots and the Blots'' survived (and prospered) on the inside pages, now drawn by Leo Baxendale.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2009/12/christmas-comics-valiant-1971.html|title=BLIMEY! The Blog of British Comics: Christmas comics: Valiant 1971|first=Lew|last=Stringer|date=17 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nWith the first relaunch issue (No.163) bearing a cover feature entitled ''Warriors of the World No.1'', the former numbering was discontinued.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/25870/ Smash! - Title Notes] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> To have maintained the original sequential numbering alongside the ''Warriors of the World'' series could only have caused confusion.\n\nThe revamped ''Smash'', now comprising 40 pages, featured all-British strips \u2014 adventure serials, humour strips, and sporting strips \u2014 many of which were reprints from ''Lion'', such as ''Eric the Viking'' (originally ''Karl the Viking''), ''The Battle of Britain'' (originally ''Britain in Chains''), and ''Nutt and Bolt, the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.''; and others which were reprints from ''Buster'', such as ''Wacker'' (originally ''Elmer''), ''Monty Muddle - The Man from Mars'' (originally ''Milkiway - The Man from Mars''), and ''Consternation Street''; but strictly no American superheroes.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The number of reprint strips was another significant indicator of its troubled financial situation, reprints being significantly cheaper than commissioning new strips.\n\nOf the former Odhams strips, only a handful survived. Humour strips which continued were ''The Swots and the Blots'', ''Wiz War'' and ''Bad Penny''. Additionally, ''Percy's Pets'' made occasional appearances (but did not appear every week). Much mourned were the loss of ''The Cloak'' and ''The Man from BUNGLE'', dropped due to the waning popularity of spy spoofs (in 1968 the TV series ''The Man from UNCLE'' had been cancelled); and especially mourned was the loss of Ken Reid and ''The Nervs''.\n\nThe serious offerings fared even worse. For although the survivors appeared to include ''Sergeant Rock - Paratrooper'' and ''Bunsen's Burner'', in reality neither of these were genuinely from the Odhams era. Both had begun only a few weeks earlier, in issues 156 and 158 respectively. They were really a part of the relaunch, but were introduced slightly ahead of time to disguise that fact. The only genuine survivor from the adventure strips of the Odhams years was ''King of the Ring'', and even that had only begun with issue&nbsp;144, in November&nbsp;1968.\n\nAfter a few months, superheroes appeared to be making a comeback. The Editorial column admitted receiving complaints from readers about the loss of the Marvel strips; and, in the autumn of 1969, six months after the ''Fantastic Four'' and ''Thor'' had been dropped, an all-British superhero called Tri-Man appeared, debuting in the issue of 13 September, and the character also featured in the ''Smash'' Annual that Christmas. Some indication of the effort put into this character is the fact that he was given sole possession of the front cover of the Annual! The adventures of Johnny Meek featured a hero who had triple-superpowers, hence the name Tri-Man. He leaped about rooftops (shades of Spider-Man, from the long-vanished ''Pow''), and got his powers from a ray device once every 24 hours (shades of DC's ''Green Lantern''). But the strip did not prove popular, and quietly vanished in the reshuffles of 1970.\n\nIn the light of how few strips of any sort survived from the Odhams era, and given that none of the superhero strips survived at all (which, according to the Letters pages,<ref>It was a feature of the Odhams years that the comic included a page for readers' letters, like the American comics published by Marvel and DC on which it was based, but the Letters Page was dropped in March 1969 in favour of extra advertising space.</ref> were the most popular feature of the ''Power Comics''), it would be stretching the truth to say that ''Smash'' inherited the best of the Odhams strips. Stylistically, ''The Swots and the Blots'' was the most creative and sophisticated Odhams strip (save only ''The Nervs''), and it did survive. But it was only one strip. And ''The Nervs'', which was objectively a more sophisticated strip in 1968, did not.\n\nMoreover, the publisher was taking a significant risk by re-launching the former ''Power Comic'' as, in effect, a clone of IPC's most popular titles, ''Lion'' and ''Valiant''. The publisher hoped it could repeat the success of ''Valiant'' and ''Lion'' by copying their successful formula. Nevertheless, without its discontinued superheroes ''Smash'' had nothing unique about it that might attract new readers, compared to its stablemates \u2014 featuring as it did a mix of strips reprinted from (or based on the style of) ''Lion'' and ''Buster''.\n\nOne other aspect of the change: under the umbrella of IPC Magazines Ltd, the editorial team of Alf and Cos was replaced by a single editor, identified only as 'Mike'.<ref>[https://www.comics.org/issue/368582/ https://www.comics.org/issue/368582/]</ref>\n\n\n===IPC Humour Strips===\n\nAs under Odhams, humour continued to play a large part in the relaunched comic (in terms of the page count): not to the extent it did in ''Buster'', but at least as much as in ''Valiant'' or ''Lion''.\n\nWith the relaunch, ''The Swots and the Blots'' (one of the handful of surviving Odhams strips) moved from the prestigious front cover to the centre pages. Nevertheless, now drawn by Leo Baxendale it became a standard bearer for sophisticated artwork. Baxendale began a five-year run on the strip (beginning in ''Smash'' and continuing in its successor, ''Valiant and Smash'', with some fill-ins by Les Barton<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicsuk.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=148&t=2818|title=Smash! comic the swots and the blots- Leo Baxendale - Comics UK|website=comicsuk.co.uk}}</ref>), by adopting a new style, one which influenced many others in the comics field, just as his earlier ''Beano'' work had done; and in the process attaining a new, deliriously daft, high standard, one rarely approached by other strips.\n\nNew humour strips featured in the relaunch (new to ''Smash'' at any rate) included a half-page cartoon strip drawn by Angel Nadal, entitled ''Big 'Ead'', detailing the humorous misadventures of a Mr&nbsp;Knowall character, summed up by the strip's catchphrase, continually bellowed at the lead character by his irate victims: \"''Have a care there, Big&nbsp;'Ead!''\" Reprinted from ''Buster'', where it had initially run \u2014 under the same title \u2014 from 28 May 1960 to 18 February 1961.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p43\">''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p43</ref>\n\n''Wacker'' was a single page cartoon strip, subtitled ''He's All at Sea''. Drawn at different times by Rafart<ref>[https://www.lambiek.net/artists/r/raf.htm Juan Rafart Rold\u00e1n] (1928 - 13 October 1997, Spain)</ref> and by Roy Wilson, it concerned the crazy antics in the Royal Navy of Mis-leading Seaman Wacker, who was forever driving the Captain of HMS Impossible toward a nervous breakdown. Despite the Liverpudlian overtones of his surname, Wacker seemed not to be a Scouser \u2013 which may have been because it was ''not'' his real name! The strip, although new to ''Smash'', had run in ''[[Buster (comics)|Buster]]'' from 29 October 1960 to 17 October 1964 under its real title, ''Elmer''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2018/10/29/buster-60s/|title=Buster 60s|date=29 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p43\"/>\n\nAnother humour strip new to ''Smash'' was the World War Two spoof, ''Nutt and Bolt the Men From W.H.E.E.Z.E.'' Set in 1940, this featured an English scientist named Professor Nutt, who was a boffin inventing eccentric secret weapons for a department of the War Office known as W.H.E.E.Z.E. (short for Weapon Handling Early Experimental and Zoning Establishment), who was kept out of trouble by his Army \"minder\", Sgt&nbsp;'Lightning' Bolt. Nutt and Bolt were perpetually clashing with a cunning Nazi scientist named Doktor Skull. This was another reprint strip, perhaps from ''Lion''. As its title implies, it was born out of the earlier popularity of the ''Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' television series. However, the strip had only a short run in ''Smash'', being replaced after just 22&nbsp;issues.\n\nYet it was not only in the plainly cartoon-style strips that humour flourished in the new ''Smash''. Many of the ostensibly more serious offerings were, in reality, humour strips: in particular, ''His Sporting Lordship'' and ''The World Wide Wanderers''; but there was also a strong humorous undercurrent in the new lead serial, ''Master of the Marsh''.\n\n===IPC Sporting Strips===\n\nSporting strips were now the order of the day. Reflecting this, the new lead, on page 3, was ''Master of the Marsh'', drawn by [[Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez (comics)|Solano Lopez]],<ref name=\"Comics artist Solano Lopez\">Comics artist [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2012/11/this-week-in-1970-smash-goes-on-hiatus.html Solano Lopez]</ref> a sports serial about Patchman, a strange hermit who lived in the East Anglian fens. He was appointed as the new sports master at Marshside Secondary School, nicknamed 'The Marsh', because he was the only person who could control the kids \u2014 a group of hooligans known as 'the Monsters of the Marsh'. There was an association of ideas between fens and marsh, reinforced by the fact that Patchman camped in the inaccessible heart of the marshes. He was a burly woodsman who had always lived in the Fens, and could communicate after a fashion with the local wildlife, for whom he acted as protector.\n\nThe strip initially featured humorous stories about the attempts of Knocker Reeves \u2013 the worst of the 'monsters' \u2013 to get the better of the new teacher. But eventually it transpired that Patchman was secretly the guardian of a collection of relics left behind by [[Hereward the Wake]], a warlord who had fought the Norman invaders in the Fens during the 11th Century. In this respect, the strip had an occasional tendency to embrace science fiction overtones.\n\nOf the sports-based stories, the only survivor from the Odhams years was ''King of the Ring'', which continued to prosper. Possibly feeling the strip was suffering in the credibility stakes, the new editorial team made a decision to change the name of King's manager, who bore the remarkable name (actually a nickname) of Blarney Stone! They threw Blarney out of the series and substituted a new manager with a less silly name. ''Ballyhoo Barnes'' wasn't all that much less silly, but it's the thought that counts! Even so, Blarney reappeared after a few weeks, by popular demand.\n\nThe most successful of the new sports-based strips (certainly the most long-running) was ''His Sporting Lordship'', drawn by Douglas Maxted.<ref>Comics artist [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2009/12/christmas-comics-valiant-1971.html Douglas Maxted]</ref> This humorous hit proved so popular that it ultimately became one of the few to outlast ''Smash'' itself. Henry Nobbins had been a labourer on a building site until he inherited the title of Earl of Ranworth and five million pounds. Before he could touch the money, however, he had to become champion at a number of sports. He also had to evade the nefarious attentions of Mr&nbsp;Parkinson, who was a rival claimant to the fortune, and Parkinson's villainous henchman, Fred Bloggs.\n\nLord Henry, as he had now become, was more than ably assisted by his Butler, Jarvis, who he had inherited from the previous Earl. And Jarvis proved indispensable. Henry was never portrayed as anything other than an able athlete and a good natured bloke, leaving Jarvis to supply the cunning which was (frequently) needed to defeat the dastardly Mr&nbsp;Parkinson, and prevent Henry's ancestral home, Castle Plonkton, from being turned into a glue factory.\n\nThe relaunch included a short-lived football strip with humorous overtones, entitled ''The World-Wide Wanderers'', about a League football team composed of eleven players from eleven different countries \u2014 not such a funny joke today! Football manager Harry Kraft found himself a passenger on a ship passing through the Suez Canal; ships from all over the world called there, and the crews conducted impromptu soccer matches to while away the time in port. Some of the crews had been stranded there, and constant soccer practice (since there was nothing else to do) had caused them to develop fantastic footballing skills. Kraft shipped eleven of them, from as many different countries, back to England; and they used their highly unorthodox individual skills to play as a team in the old Fourth Division.\n\n===IPC Adventure Strips===\n\nThe other staple of the new ''Smash'' was adventure serials, and far and away the most successful of these was ''The Incredible Adventures of [[Janus Stark]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://britishcomicart.blogspot.com/search/label/Janus%2BStark|title=British Comic Art}}</ref> written by Tom Tully,<ref>Credits for [https://www.comics.org/issue/1052666/#2183041 Janus Stark] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> featuring an escapologist in Victorian London who appeared to be simply an unusual act on the music-hall stage, but who privately used his extraordinary abilities to battle against injustice. Stark had an unusually flexible bone structure, enabling him to get out of an astonishing variety of tight situations, thanks to training received in childhood from his mentor, Blind Largo. Drawn by [[Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez (comics)|Solano Lopez]], there was more than a touch of Reed Richards, from the departed ''Fantastic Four'' strip, in Stark's uncanny abilities.<ref>Stark's flexible bone structure, which was the basis of his career as an escapologist in the theatres, was perhaps more akin to ''Rubberman'', a character who had featured in ''Smash'' in 1966</ref> Lopez's dark, moody artwork also gave the strip a perfect 19th Century setting.<ref name=\"Comics artist Solano Lopez\"/> The strip was one of the few to survive the merger of ''Smash'' into ''Valiant'' in 1971, and is still well remembered today. As a mark of its popularity, from week 30 it replaced ''Master of the Marsh'' as the lead serial on page 3 (swapping places with the latter, which was thus relegated to an inconspicuous location on pages 12 and 13).\n\nThis brings up the matter of economics once more. Solano Lopez was a foreign illustrator, born in the Argentine, who worked at a studio in Spain. For reasons of cost, IPC had taken a policy decision to source artwork from cheaper sources outside the UK.<ref name=\"blogs.birminghammail.net\"/> Along with the presence in the new ''Smash'' of reprint strips, which were much cheaper than commissioning new strips, this is yet another indicator of the financial pressure the comic was still under, and the absolute necessity of cutting production costs to the bone in order to make it financially viable.\n\nAnother long-running adventure strip was ''The Battle of Britain'', in which secret agent Simon Kane fought against Baron Rudolph, a usurper who had seized control of Britain using a secret weapon. The weapon emitted a sound wave which paralysed anyone who wasn't protected against it. Rudolph set up a police state, similar in emblems and uniforms to medieval England at the time of King John, and Kane led the resistance against him.\n\nIn spite of the title, the strip had no connection with the Second World War! Drawn for the initial 40 issues by Geoff Campion, and thereafter by [[John Stokes (comics)|John Stokes]],<ref>Fleetway Companion by Steve Holland, p109</ref> it was in fact a reprint; hence it, too, was an indication of the comic's troubled financial status (reprints being cheaper than new strips). It originally ran in ''[[Lion (comics)|Lion]]'' from 29 February 1964 to 28 May 1966 under various titles including ''Britain in Chains'' and ''The Battle for Britain'', where the hero was called Vic Gunn. The editorial staff of ''Smash'' took a decision to change the names of the leading characters from Gunn and Barrel (i.e. ''gun barrel''), to slightly less absurd ones; and so were born secret agent Simon Kane and his assistant Tubby. This had been a very long-running strip in ''Lion'', so much so that ''Smash'' actually ceased publication \u2014 in April 1971 \u2014 before it had reprinted the entire run from ''Lion'', and in the final issue created an (unconvincing) new ending for the serial.\n\n''Rebbels on the Run'' was another adventure serial, featuring three young brothers whose surname was Rebbel, who run away from an orphanage to avoid being split up. After a few months on the run, the strip took an amazing turn and \u2014 renamed ''The Rebbel Robot'' \u2014 became a science fiction serial, when the boys discovered that their late father's mind was preserved within the brain of a robot, which became their unofficial guardian. With it they embarked on a quest to track down a criminal known as The Genie, who had murdered their real father \u2014 who, in a further improbable turn of events, turned out to be a secret agent!\n\n''Eric the Viking'', a continuing serial featuring its eponymous Viking hero, and set in the Dark Ages, was another reprint from ''Lion'', where it had run under the title ''Karl the Viking'', as a set of 13 stories, from 29 October 1960 until 29 September 1964, written by Ken Bulmer.<ref name=\"Steve Holland p108\">Fleetway Companion by Steve Holland, p108</ref> The change of name to Eric probably reflects on the continuing fame (during the 1960s) of a real-life Viking leader in Dark Age Britain, Eric Bloodaxe, who history records was King in Viking York in the 10th Century. The strip is well remembered under its original title, as it was drawn by a famous comics artist, Don Lawrence.<ref>Comics artist [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2012/11/this-week-in-1970-smash-goes-on-hiatus.html Don Lawrence]</ref><ref>[http://www.donlawrence.co.uk/shop/index.php?hg=2&sg=35 Deluxe hardback collection of ''Karl the Viking'' strips] by Don Lawrence</ref> Eric (and Karl) fought a weird but impressive collection of legendary and fantasy monsters, in sword-and-sorcery epics which had some reflections in Lawrence's art for his contemporary work on the highly regarded all-colour science fiction strip ''[[The Trigan Empire]]'' then running in ''Look and Learn''. This was not even the first reprint: retitled ''Swords of the Sea Wolves'' it had initially been reprinted in ''Lion'', in part, between 1 October 1966 and 7 October 1967, with the lead character renamed Rolf the Viking.<ref name=\"Steve Holland p108\"/> And it would later be reprinted again, in the European version of ''Vulcan'': on that occasion translated into German and retitled 'Kobra'.\n\nTwo of the new IPC adventure strips \u2014 ''Sergeant Rock Paratrooper'' and ''Bunsen's Burner'' \u2014 were introduced five or six weeks early, in an attempt to conceal how few Odhams strips had actually survived, by making these appear to be existing strips although they were not. World War Two was the setting for the former, which, with occasional stories drawn by John Vernon,<ref>Fleetway Companion by Steve Holland, p88</ref> recounted the adventures of the 'Red Devils' of the Parachute Regiment. Initially, Sgt Rock was merely a narrator, introducing stories featuring other characters, so that it was actually tales-of-the-parachute-regiment, rather than tales of Sgt Rock himself. This was a device for reprinting old war stories from other comics: the strip had originally appeared in Fleetway's ''Hurricane'', from 4 July 1964 to 8 May 1965, entitled ''Paratrooper'', and continued in ''Tiger'' when that title absorbed ''Hurricane'' in the issue dated 15 May 1965. The reprints in ''Smash'' were reasonably successful, running for a year; and Sergeant Rock eventually featured as more than just narrator, with later editions sending him into action with the SAS, and marking the change by altering the title to ''Sergeant Rock - Special Air Service''. This change was noticeable, also, by a change of artist; seemingly \u2014 from the similarity of style \u2014 to the artist on the discontinued wartime strip, ''Nutt and Bolt the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.''.\n\n''Bunsen's Burner'' was a short-lived strip, lasting just a few weeks.<ref>It was discontinued during the reshuffles of August 1969, when various changes were quietly made to the comic over the course of a month.</ref> This was an adventure yarn with humorous overtones \u2013 its humorous content being trailed in its title: a reference to an item familiar to most schoolboys from their Chemistry classes. Ben Bunsen was the owner of a vintage car, which was known as \"the Burner\" because it was so old it was steam-driven! Like an old-fashioned steam train it had a boiler which had to be stoked, as it ran on coal instead of petrol. Ben and his pal had to drive the Burner around the world, as a condition of Ben inheriting his uncle's fortune; but a rival claimant (shades of ''His Sporting Lordship''!) was secretly out to stop them.\n\nAnother adventure strip which had a sadly brief run, lasting only 47 weeks, but which is very well-remembered today, was ''Cursitor Doom''. In this spooky and atmospheric series,<ref>The strip had various artists during its one year run, but far and away the most effective of them was the talented Eric Bradbury, and it is mainly his serials from which the strip's enduring reputation derives</ref> Cursitor Doom, master investigator of the strange and mystic, who openly practiced sorcery in the strip, battled against the dark forces of evil, ably assisted by the pounding fists of his assistant, Angus McCraggan. Doom battled against genuine spirits and sorcerers, in tales including ''The Case of Kalak the Dwarf'', ''The Sorcerer's Talisman'' and ''The Dark Legion of Mardarax'', in the latter encountering a haunted (and unstoppable) Roman Legion brought back to \"life\" by the evil Mardarax. Doom's pet Raven, Scarab, who could write messages in the dust for Angus McCraggan, by scratching with his claw, was often of more help to Doom in these serials than was the perpetually baffled McCraggan.\n\nThe ''Cursitor Doom'' strip was drawn by Geoff Campion (including ''The Return of the Hunter''), and \u2013 more effectively \u2013 by [[Eric Bradbury]] (including the magnificently atmospheric ''Dark Legion of Mardarax'').\n\n===Changes in August 1969===\n\nAfter 22 weeks, in August&nbsp;1969, ''Nutt and Bolt the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.'' was dropped, and replaced from the 23rd&nbsp;issue by a more serious World War Two strip entitled ''Send For... Q-Squad'', which dealt with the adventures of a hand picked group of six specialists, who were assigned to unusual missions that required special expertise both in the air and on the ground. This, too, in keeping with the need to cut costs, was a reprint, originally published in ''Buster'' from 28 May 1960 to 7 March 1964 under the title ''Phantom Force 5''.<ref>[http://www.bustercomic.com/phantomforcefive.html ''Phantom Force Five''] in ''Buster''</ref><ref>''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p36</ref>\n\nThis was another of those drawn, initially, by one of IPC's best British artists, [[Eric Bradbury]], at other times by the Spanish-based artist Luis Bermejo Rojo,<ref>[http://smashpages.net/2015/12/15/rip-luis-bermejo-rojo/ Career of Luis Bermejo] at SmashPages.net</ref> and in its final months mainly by Fred Holmes.<ref>Comics artist [http://www.bustercomic.com/phantomforcefive.html Fred Holmes] at BusterComic.com</ref> Because the strip had a regrettably short run in ''Smash'' (from 16 August 1969 to 30 January 1970 only), most of the run features art by Eric Bradbury.\n\nIt was marked out as a reprint by its unique style \u2014 which was both different from, and grimmer than, all the other strips. Whereas Sgt Rock emulated Lord Henry (and Janus Stark), by maintaining a huge and confident smile, regardless of how much trouble he was in, no one in ''Q-Squad'' ever stopped looking worried. Its reprint status was also signalled by the fact that Q-Squad was plainly ''not'' the original name of the team. Some panels showed evidence of the name having been inserted over a previous one: a change in the lettering style for the name 'Q-Squad' and any adjacent words \u2014 which used a different handwriting in a cruder style wherever the name appeared, but nowhere else.\n\nIn the same issue, a serious footballing serial entitled ''The Handcuff Hotspurs'' began, replacing the departed \u2014 and rather more humorous \u2014 ''World Wide Wanderers''. Hard-as-nails former prison sports instructor 'Toff' Morgan (so called for his habit of always wearing a top-hat) took over the management of ailing First Division side Haversham Hotspurs. Morgan began to rebuild the team by 'framing' ex-criminals who he'd known while working in various prisons, forcing them to sign on with the club in order to make use of their dishonest skills as footballing talents. These convicts became the 'handcuff hotspurs' of the title. The club's former manager, Reg Jessup, tried constantly to sabotage Morgan's efforts, in order to persuade the Directors to re-appoint him instead.\n\nSix months earlier, various humour strips had been introduced as replacements for the (far more surreal) humour of [[Ken Reid (comics)|Ken Reid]], whose strip ''The Nervs'' had so disturbed IPC's management. Now another was forthcoming, and one which reflected the pervasive sporting theme of the relaunched comic. ''The Touchline Tearaways'' (replacing ''Big 'Ead'') was another new football-themed strip, featuring three mad-keen supporters of Grimshot United: a totally useless Football League team, perpetually in danger of being relegated as it was made up entirely of ailing and decrepit players. Each week the Tearaways \u2014 Hairy, Lug'oles and Clever Dick \u2014 would execute some scheme from the touchline to help Grimshot win that week's fixture, usually involving a battle of wits with officials from the Ministry of Football, who, not unnaturally, tried to put a stop to the Tearaways well-intentioned cheating.\n\nThe name of the club, Grimshot United, was a humorous indication that the team was not very good (i.e. that the players were \"grim shots\"). Each strip featured a single match, with a plot based around helping the team overcome that week's opponent. Clever Dick masterminded all the ploys used in helping Grimshot, and apart from occasional words of congratulation or encouragement he was generally the only \"Tearaway\" who had dialogue in the strip. Hairy and Lug'oles tended to be merely a pair of walking visual gags: Hairy's features were perpetually invisible behind a vast mass of long black hair that covered his entire face and head, and Lug'oles had a pair of enormous ears.\n\nThese three new strips represented a minor change of emphasis, replacing two of the more whimsical offerings with two entirely serious strips \u2014 even though the third new entry (which was only a single-page) was simply one outright cartoon strip replacing another.\n\nThus, within six months, a number of the strips introduced in the relaunch had already bitten the dust. And more changes were looming.\n\n===The 2nd Relaunch : 1970===\n\nThe most obvious problem faced by the new-look ''Smash'' was the constant \"churn\": the incessant turnover of strips. Without its solidly popular superhero strips to rely on, the editorial staff seemed pathologically incapable of settling on a fixed line-up.<ref>Continual change of line-up was not a problem unique to ''Smash'', but was shared by all IPC's comics of this period. Editors struggled to find strips sufficiently popular to halt the decline in weekly sales; but making so many changes was self-defeating, because it harmed reader loyalty.</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the changes made in August&nbsp;1969, further changes made at the start of 1970 left ''Smash'' looking very different from its appearance in the wake of the relaunch just 12&nbsp;months earlier. A vast number of new strips were added, in a second re-launch, such that only half of those introduced in March&nbsp;1969 now survived, although those which continued included ''Master of the Marsh'', ''[[Janus Stark]]'', ''His Sporting Lordship'', ''Battle of Britain'', ''Eric the Viking'', ''Wacker'', ''The Handcuff Hotspurs'', ''The Swots and the Blots'', and ''Percy's Pets'' \u2014 the latter two now being the only remaining Odhams strips.<ref name=SP2010 />\n\nDiscontinued were ''King of the Ring'' (last survivor of the serious strips from the Odhams era), ''Sergeant Rock \u2013 Special Air Service'', and ''Cursitor Doom''. Three of the strips only recently introduced were also dropped, namely the wartime ''Q-Squad'', British superhero ''Tri-Man'', and the humour strip ''The Touchline Tearaways''.\n\nThe first changes in 1970 occurred in the issue dated 24 January, when three new strips appeared, all reprints from ''Buster'': ''The Kid Commandos'', ''Consternation Street'', and ''Monty Muddle \u2013 The Man from Mars'' (originally titled ''Milkiway \u2013 The Man from Mars''). These were introduced as part of a relaunch of the comic: by once again bringing in some of the changes a few weeks ahead of the relaunch, as had been done in the Spring of 1969, the publisher hoped to disguise the true extent of the changes.<ref name=SP2010 />\n\n''The Kid Commandos'' was a war story about three cockney children stranded in occupied France in World War Two. Drawn by Tom Kerr, the Sparrow children \u2014 Tommy, Jan and Podge \u2014 were on the run from the Germans each week, in a single page strip set in 1940. This was another reprint from ''Buster'', in which it appeared from 9 January to 24 July 1965, under the imaginative title ''The Sparrows Go To War''.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p38\">''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p38</ref>\n\nIn the humour strip ''Consternation Street'' drawn by Reg Parlett (the title spoofed that of the popular British television soap opera, ''Coronation Street''), which was usually a one-page strip, a collection of unlikely neighbours rubbed shoulders in a very small street. Watched over by the dim-witted Constable Clott were the Snobbs and the Ardupps, Colonel Curry & Caesar (his dog), Miss Primm and her pets, Cutprice the Grocer, and Roger the Lodger. This was another reprint from ''Buster'', in which it had originally run \u2013 under the same title \u2013 between 9 January and 23 October 1965.<ref>''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p44</ref> Parlett was also known from his other humour strips in ''Buster'' including ''Rent-A-Ghost Ltd'', ''The Happy Family'' and ''Bonehead''.<ref>[http://comicsuk.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=148&t=1992 Reg Parlett's contributions to ''Valiant'' and ''Buster''] (including the long running ''Billy Bunter'' strip in ''Valiant'', which continued in ''Valiant and Smash'')</ref>\n\nThe half-page humour strip ''Monty Muddle \u2013 The Man from Mars'' recounted the misadventures of spaceman Monty Muddle (a name rather less convincing than the character's original name, ''Milkiway''). It originally ran in ''Buster'' from 28 May 1960 to 10 March 1962, with art credited to Nadal/Rafart.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p43\"/> He flew about in his small bubble-domed spacecraft trying to make friends with the Earth people. However, due to his misunderstanding of Earth customs, his every attempt at contact ended in disaster; and each strip would typically end with the catchphrase ''I'll try again next week!''\n\nThe 7 February issue then saw a full re-launch: with more free gifts, another new cover feature, and no less than eight new strips (making an astonishing eleven strips added since the beginning of the year).\n\nThe ''Warriors of the World'' covers had run into a problem, in that war stories were no longer a strong element of ''Smash'', which had dropped the humour strip ''Nutt and Bolt the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.'' some time earlier. When it was decided to also drop ''Sergeant Rock \u2013 Paratrooper'' (by then renamed ''Sergeant Rock \u2013 Special Air Service''), and ''Q&nbsp;Squad'', the cover feature had to go too. It was not practical to advertise war stories on the cover if there were no war stories inside!\n\nThe newly added ''Kid Commandos'' did not count as a war story in this context, since the three fugitive children did not do any conventional fighting. The strip was more like a souped-up version of the discontinued ''Rebbels on the Run''.\n\nAccordingly, after forty seven weeks<ref>46 issues featuring the ''Warriors of the World'' cover feature, and one Christmas issue</ref> the ''Warriors of the World'' series was ended. Instead, the issue dated 7 February 1970 began ''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test'', written by Angus Allan and drawn by the ever-popular Eric Bradbury.<ref>Credits for [https://www.comics.org/issue/1052666/#2183036 ''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test'']</ref> Henceforth each week's cover featured a full-page splash advertising the task which adventurer Simon Test would undertake in a new strip on the inside pages. This strip proved so successful that when the original thirteen-week series was completed (featuring one task each week), Simon Test was given a new series of adventures, extending his hold on the cover indefinitely. He would prove particularly enduring, being one of the few strips to ultimately survive the merger with ''Valiant'' in 1971.\n\n''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test'' saw him undertake a quest for immortality by attempting the thirteen tasks of the Pharaoh Thot, believing this to be the only way to save his life, having been deceived into believing he has only a few months to live. The sinister Jabez Coppenger secretly desired Test's death as a means of restoring his own youth. This serial introduced the mute servant Karka, who would ultimately become Test's friend and assistant.\n\nTest then went on to the more lengthy series of adventures entitled ''Simon Test and the Curse of the Conqueror'', where he battled the twenty servants of the evil Ezekiel Spar, the self-styled Conqueror. This pitted him against twenty athletes and champions, each of whom was under the hypnotic control of Spar, who implanted in them an in-built impulse to kill Simon Test.\n\nNew supporting strips introduced in the 7 February issue included ''Threat of the Toymaker'', ''The Pillater Peril'', ''Birdman of Baratoga'', ''Nick and Nat \u2013 The Beat Boys'', and three humour strips with a common supernatural element: ''Sam's Spook'' (drawn by Leo Baxendale), ''The Haunts of Headless Harry'', and ''Ghost Ship''.\n\nIn ''Threat of the Toymaker'', drawn by Solano Lopez, a criminal scientist named Doctor Droll escaped from Garstone Prison with the aid of an army of remote controlled mechanical toys he had constructed, along the way taking the Prison Governor's children, Pam and Peter Keen, as hostages. Hampered by the children at every turn, Droll finds himself on the run, pursued by the Police wherever he goes. The idea of using radio controlled toys in the strip was scarcely original, since it was a straight lift from the ''House of Dolmann'', which was then running in ''Valiant'', as well as from the ''General Jumbo'' strip in ''The Beano''. The strip was scarcely original either: having been first published in ''Buster'', under the title ''The Toys of Doom'', between 27 February 1965 and 13 January 1968 (and in which it would be reprinted\u2014in part\u2014between 3 May and 6 September 1986, under the title ''The Terror Toys''), it was also reprinted in ''Eagle'', under its original title ''The Toys of Doom''.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p38\"/>\n\n''The Pillater Peril'' saw David Pillater return to Pillater House, his ancestral home on the Cornish coast, which he is to inherit on his 21st&nbsp;birthday. Along with his four cousins and his Uncle Bernard, David is imperilled by Francis Pillater, an ancestor who has seemingly returned from the dead. Francis had an evil reputation for his misdeeds in the 16th century, but was thought to have perished in a shipwreck during a storm at sea. Blaming the family for his troubles, he sets out for revenge by kidnapping them one by one. The strip had only a short run, but when discontinued it did, unusually, seemingly come to a natural conclusion (rather than merely wrapping-up many continuing plot threads unconvincingly in the final panel).\n\n''Birdman from Baratoga'' was an adventure strip about a boy who grew up on a Pacific island with only the company of birds, and learned from them the secret of flight. By the use of a feather cape, he was able to glide through the air like an albatros. When an English sailor is castaway on the island, called Baratoga, they escape together on a raft and set out on a series of adventures in the Pacific, beginning by hunting down the desperado who has stolen the man's pearl-fishing yacht, ''Enterprise''. ''Birdman from Baratoga'' was perhaps loosely based on a humour strip which had run in ''Buster'' during 1968: ''Captain Swoop \u2013 He's Half Man, Half Bird, Half Wit''.\n\nIn a very atypical move, prompted by IPC's on-going financial problems (in the year in which they were taken over by the Reed Group), the editorial team now resurrected one of the old strips which had run in ''Wham'' under Odhams, drawn by Gordon Hogg. ''Nick and Nat \u2013 The Beat Boys'' featured two young lads from Liverpool who fancied themselves as musicians, spoke in Liverpudlian slang (even the original title of the strip was derived from a slang Scouse term for a native of Liverpool: 'wacker'), sported Beatles-style haircuts, and always carried guitars. This was a reprint of ''The&nbsp;Wacks'', which had run in ''Wham'' during 1964, reprinted here with only the title and the names changed. Spoofing the pop group ''The Beatles'', it was an odd choice to run it a year ''after'' that group's demise. It was, though, a popular item: this 1964 strip had already been reprinted, under the title ''Birk 'n' 'Ed, the Mersey Dead-Beats'', from 30 January 1965 in Fleetway's ''Hurricane''.<ref>''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p.89</ref><ref>Spoken quickly for comic effect, the names of the two characters were intended to sound like that of a district in Liverpool called Birkenhead</ref>\n\nA common supernatural theme linked the three new humour strips. In ''Sam's Spook'', drawn by the ubiquitous Leo Baxendale, Sam was a schoolboy with a ghostly pal called Spooky, who used his powers to humorous effect on Sam's behalf. The strip mostly consisted of Sam's school friends catching Spooky doing a bit of ghostly cheating in order to help Sam win at sports or football, and Sam doing a lot of running away to avoid a bashing.\n\n''The Haunts of Headless Harry'' featured the amiable ghost of a 16th-century soldier who had been beheaded. Harry's head and body led separate but related ghostly existences, with the body carrying the head around everywhere, and both of them were able to talk. Harry's humorous adventures invariably involved misplacing his head; such as going to the cinema and, on leaving, calling at the cloakroom to collect it (as though it was a hat), and being asked by the attendant to identify it among all the other ghostly heads left there during the film.\n\nThe other new humour strip was ''Ghost Ship'', in which the spirit of an ancient galleon, and the ghosts of its pirate crew, sailed the Seven Seas making mischief, but usually coming off worst.\n\nFurther changes followed: such that fully thirteen strips had been introduced since the start of 1970. In the issue dated 27 June 1970, a new humour strip began entitled ''Moonie's Magic Mate'', about a schoolboy, Barry Moon, who finds a Genie in a dusty old bottle. In the issue dated 29 August, a humour strip titled ''The Fighting Three'' began, featuring the misadventures of three men: globe-trotters McGinty, Hambone and Weasel are travelling the world, trying to raise enough money to start their own construction company, but get into fights \u2013 and jail! \u2013 wherever they go. Drawn by Carlos Cruz, this was another reprint from ''Buster'', where, under its original title ''Mighty McGinty'', the strip had run in 1964.<ref>Published 29 February to 17 October 1964: ''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p38</ref> And finally, in the last addition before the comic's closure, a strip entitled ''Tyler the Tamer'' was launched in early 1971, about the adventures of the greatest film stuntman in the world. Dropped to make room for these were ''Kid Commandos'', ''Threat of the Toymaker'' and ''The Pillater Peril'' (the ''Pillater'' saga seemingly reaching a natural conclusion, instead of merely being summarily abandoned).\n\n==Merger with ''Valiant''==\n\nIn mid-November 1970, production on ''Smash'' (and many other IPC titles, including ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]'') came to a halt due to a printers' strike, and no editions were published for the next three months.<ref name=SP2010 /> By the time the strike was settled, in February of the following year, irreparable damage had been done to the comic's circulation, as its young readers had turned elsewhere in the intervening 11&nbsp;weeks. Similar harm had been suffered by ''Valiant''. In consequence of this latest financial disaster, after eight issues, in April&nbsp;1971 the two titles were merged in an attempt to combine their surviving circulation. For a brief time the merged comic was entitled ''Valiant and Smash'' (10 April to 18 September 1971<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2018/11/27/valiant-70s/|title=Valiant 70s|date=27 November 2018}}</ref>), before reverting to simply ''Valiant''.\n\nSome strips from ''Smash'' survived in the new comic, including ''His Sporting Lordship'', ''[[Janus Stark]]'' and ''The Swots and the Blots'', but most were lost,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180805023305/http://26pigs.com/valiant/index.html Merger with ''Valiant''] - ''Valiant and Smash''</ref> although the ''Smash'' Annual continued to appear for many years afterwards (continuing, in fact, until the 1976 Annual, published in the autumn of 1975). A lot of the strips thereby continued to appear each year, including many which had not even survived into ''Valiant'', long after ''Smash'' had ceased publication as a comic.<ref name=\"British Comics website\">{{Cite web|url=https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2019/04/13/smash/|title=Smash!|date=13 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe sports themed ''His Sporting Lordship'' had enjoyed perhaps the greatest popularity, surviving the shake-ups of 1969 and 1970, and then surviving even the merger with ''Valiant'', though it was to last only a few months in its new home, finally ending in December&nbsp;1971. However, it was revived in the 1972 ''Smash'' Annual, published at Christmas&nbsp;1971, and returned year after year: becoming the regular cover feature of the Annuals.<ref name=\"British Comics website\"/>\n\nThe merged title was dominated by ''Valiant'', which contributed nine strips consisting of twenty pages; whereas ''Smash!'' was represented by only four strips, totalling a meager nine pages: ''Janus Stark'', ''The Swots & The Blots'', ''Simon Test'', and ''His Sporting Lordship''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kidr77.blogspot.com/2012/10/a-valiant-attempt-at-smashing.html|title=CRIVENS! COMICS & STUFF: A VALIANT ATTEMPT AT A SMASHING COMBINATION...|date=25 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nDespite all of the changes, the new ''Smash'' had lasted only two years. Maybe it was only marginally profitable, but no title could have survived such a lengthy loss of production. Its demise was directly attributable to the strike.<ref name=SP2010>{{Cite web|url=https://stephenpoppitt.wordpress.com/2010/12/16/comics-010/|title=Smash! : The IPC Years \u2013 Part 5: Cancellation|date=16 December 2010}}</ref>\n\n''Smash'' was the last attempt in the UK market to publish a general boys comic, mixing adventure, sports and humour strips. Subsequent comics would survive only by ruthlessly focusing on narrow, sectional interests: such as all-sports, all-war, or all-humour;<ref>The most successful of these was ''Doctor Who Weekly'', which still exists today, although it had to become a monthly title in order to survive (and adopt a magazine format)</ref> just as the American market had already specialised into all-funnies, all-horror, and all-superhero titles. The writing was on the wall for non-niche comics in the UK, for, in the face of the competition from television, even IPC's flagship, ''Valiant'', ultimately could not survive.<ref>''Note'': One trend in British comics was to ride the coat-tails of the success of television, which was gradually killing off comics, by specialising in strips based on popular tv shows: titles which attempted to ride the back of the tiger in this fashion included ''[[TV Comic]]'', ''[[TV Century 21|TV21]]'', ''TV Tornado'', ''[[Lady Penelope (comic)|Lady Penelope]]'', ''Joe 90 Top Secret'', ''[[Countdown (Polystyle Publications)|Countdown]]'', ''[[TV Action]]'', and ''[[Doctor Who Magazine|Doctor Who Weekly]]''.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.IPCmedia.com/about/companyhistory/ The history of IPC]\n* [https://BritishComics.wordpress.com/2019/04/13/smash/ ''Smash'' at the British Comics WordPress site]\n* [http://clitheroekid.ihostfull.com/links2.htm#comics 1960s British Comics review]\n* [http://BritishComicArt.blogspot.com/search/label/Smash/ ''Smash'' comic art]\n* [http://www.comicworldnews.com/crumpets/4/smash.jpg ''Smash'' #150 cover art]\n* [http://www.comics.org/series/25870/covers/ ''Smash'' cover art] at the Grand Comics Database\n* [http://britishcomicart.blogspot.com/2009/08/battle-for-britain.html ''The Battle For Britain'' - Art by John Stokes]\n* Comics UK Gallery - [http://www.comicsuk.co.uk/gallery.php ''Valiant and Smash'']\n* Baxendale, Leo - [https://www.google.com/images?hl=en&num=20&as_epq=Leo+Baxendale&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=lang_en&cr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=&as_rights=&safe=images&q=%22Leo+Baxendale%22&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=univ&ei=kFJmTIazKsiOjAfkzZ3UBA&sa=X&oi=image_result_group&ct=title&resnum=4&ved=0CCMQsAQwAw Images at Google.com]\n* Reid, Ken - [https://web.archive.org/web/20090304202443/http://www.comicsuk.co.uk/Interviews/KenReid/KenReidOverview.asp Comics UK biography of Ken Reid (1919-87)]\n* McMurtry, Stan - [http://www.cartoons.ac.uk/artists/stanmcmurtry/biography Biography: Stan McMurtry (a.k.a.

During the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] the region, like all of Britain south of the [[Firth of Forth]], was dominated by the [[Celtic Britons]] and the [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic language]].<ref name=\"KochBritons\">Koch, pp. 291\u2013292.</ref> The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], who began their [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquest of Britain]] in AD 43, first campaigned in what is now northeast Wales in 48 against the [[Deceangli]], and gained total control of the region with their defeat of the [[Ordovices]] in 79. The Romans [[End of Roman rule in Britain|departed from Britain]] in the 5th century, opening the door for the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|Anglo-Saxon invasion]]. Thereafter Brittonic language and culture began to splinter, and several distinct groups formed. The [[Welsh people]] were the largest of these groups, and are generally discussed independently of the other surviving [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]]-speaking peoples after the 11th century.<ref name=\"KochBritons\"/>\n\nA number of kingdoms formed in present-day Wales in the [[sub-Roman Britain|post-Roman]] period. While the most powerful ruler was acknowledged as [[King of the Britons]] (later ''[[Tywysog|Tywysog Cymru]]'': ''Leader'' or ''Prince of Wales''), and some rulers extended their control over other Welsh territories and into western England, none were able to unite Wales for long. Internecine struggles and external pressure from the English and later, the [[Normans|Norman]] conquerors of England, led to the Welsh kingdoms coming gradually under the sway of the English crown. In 1282, the death of [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]] led to the [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I|conquest]] of the [[Principality of Wales]] by King [[Edward I of England]]; afterwards, the [[heir apparent]] to the English monarch has borne the title \"[[Prince of Wales]]\". The Welsh launched several revolts against English rule, the last significant one being that led by [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]] in the early 15th century. In the 16th century [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], himself of Welsh extraction as a great grandson of [[Owen Tudor]], passed the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542|Laws in Wales Acts]] aiming to fully incorporate Wales into the [[Kingdom of England]]. Under England's authority, Wales became part of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1707 and then the United Kingdom in 1801. Yet, the Welsh retained their language and culture despite heavy English dominance. The publication of the extremely significant first complete [[Welsh Bible|Welsh translation of the Bible]] by [[William Morgan (Bible translator)|William Morgan]] in 1588 greatly advanced the position of Welsh as a [[literary language]].<ref name=Morgan>{{cite book|last=Davies|first=John (Ed)|authorlink=John Davies (historian)|title=The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales|publisher=University of Wales Press|year=2008|location=Cardiff|page=572|isbn=978-0-7083-1953-6 }}</ref>\n\nThe 18th century saw the beginnings of two changes that would greatly affect Wales, the [[Welsh Methodist revival]], which led the country to turn increasingly [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] in religion, and the [[Industrial Revolution]]. During the rise of the [[British Empire]], 19th century Southeast Wales in particular experienced rapid industrialisation and a dramatic rise in population as a result of the explosion of the [[Coal industry in Wales|coal]] and [[Iron and steel industry|iron industries]].<ref name=\"Williams174\">Williams G.A.''When was Wales?'' p. 174</ref> Wales played a full and willing role in World War One. The industries of Empire in Wales declined in the 20th century with the end of the British Empire following the Second World War, while [[Welsh nationalism|nationalist]] sentiment and interest in self-determination rose. The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] replaced the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] as the dominant political force in the 1920s. Wales played a considerable role during World War Two along with the rest of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Allies, and its cities were bombed extensively during the Nazi Blitz. The nationalist party [[Plaid Cymru]] gained momentum from the 1960s. In a 1997 [[1997 Welsh devolution referendum|referendum]] Welsh voters approved the [[devolution]] of governmental responsibility to a [[National Assembly for Wales]], which first met in 1999.\n\n==Prehistoric Wales==\n{{Main|Prehistoric Wales}}\nThe earliest known human remain discovered in modern-day Wales is a [[Neanderthal]] jawbone, found at the [[Bontnewydd Palaeolithic site]] in the valley of the [[River Elwy]] in [[North Wales]], whose owner lived about 230,000 years ago in the [[Lower Palaeolithic]] period.<ref name=\"jewels 1\">{{cite web\n |title       = Gathering the Jewels\n |url         = http://www.gtj.org.uk/en/small/item/GTJ27306/\n |accessdate  = 25 September 2008\n |publisher   = Culturenet Cymru\n |year        = 2008\n |work        = Early Neanderthal jaw fragment, c. 230,000 years old\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120229133222/http://www.gtj.org.uk/en/small/item/GTJ27306/\n |archivedate = 29 February 2012\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref name=Davies3>Davies, J ''A History of Wales'', p. 3.</ref> The [[Red Lady of Paviland]], a human skeleton dyed in [[red ochre]], was discovered in 1823 in one of the Paviland [[limestone]] caves of the [[Gower Peninsula]] in [[Swansea]], South Wales.

The earliest farming communities are now believed to date from about 4000 BC, marking the beginning of the [[Neolithic]] period. This period saw the construction of many [[Megalithic tomb|chambered tombs]] particularly [[dolmen]]s or ''[[Dolmen|cromlechs]]''. The most notable examples of megalithic tombs include [[Bryn Celli Ddu]] and [[Barclodiad y Gawres]] on Anglesey,<ref>Lynch, F.

The climate during the [[Bronze Age|Early Bronze Age]] (c. 2500\u20131400 BC) is thought to have been warmer than at present, as there are many remains from this period in what are now bleak uplands. The Late Bronze Age (c. 1400\u2013750 BC) saw the development of more advanced bronze implements. Much of the copper for the production of bronze probably came from the copper mine on the [[Great Orme]], where prehistoric mining on a very large scale dates largely from the middle Bronze Age.<ref>Lynch, F. ''Gwynedd'' pp. 39\u201340</ref> [[Radiocarbon dating]] has shown the earliest hillforts in what would become Wales, to have been constructed during this period. Historian [[John Davies (historian)|John Davies]], theorises that a worsening climate after around 1250 BC (lower temperatures and heavier rainfall) required more productive land to be defended.<ref name=\"Davies, J p. 23\">Davies, J ''The Making of Wales'' p. 23</ref>\n\nThe earliest iron implement found in Wales is a sword from [[Llyn Fawr]] which overlooks the head of the [[Vale of Neath]], which is thought to date to about 600 BC.<ref>Davies, J ''A history of Wales'' p. 19</ref> Hillforts continued to be built during the [[British Iron Age]]. Nearly 600 hillforts are in Wales, over 20% of those found in Britain, examples being [[Pen Dinas]] near [[Aberystwyth]] and [[Tre'r Ceiri]] on the [[Ll\u0177n peninsula]].<ref name=\"Davies, J p. 23\"/> A particularly significant find from this period was made in 1943 at [[Llyn Cerrig Bach]] on Anglesey, when the ground was being prepared for the construction of a [[Royal Air Force]] base. The cache included weapons, shields, [[chariot]]s along with their fittings and harnesses, and slave chains and tools.

As part of the [[Roman conquest of Britain]], a series of campaigns to conquer Wales was launched by his successor in 48 and would continue intermittently under successive [[Roman governors of Britain|governors]] until the conquest was completed in 78. It is these campaigns of conquest that are the most widely known feature of Wales during the [[Roman Empire|Roman era]] due to the spirited but unsuccessful defence of their homelands by two native tribes, the [[Silures]] and the [[Ordovices]].\n\nThe [[Demetae]] of southwestern Wales seem to have quickly made their peace with the Romans, as there is no indication of war with Rome, and their homeland was not heavily planted with forts nor overlaid with roads. The Demetae would be the only Welsh tribe to emerge from Roman rule with their homeland and tribal name intact.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Giles|1841|pp=27}}, ''The Works of Gildas'', ''De Excidio'', ch. 31: Gildas, writing c. 540, condemns the \"tyrant of the Demetians\".</ref>\n\nWales was a rich source of mineral wealth and the Romans used their [[Roman engineering|engineering]] [[Roman technology|technology]] to extract large amounts of gold, copper, and lead, as well as modest amounts of some other metals such as [[zinc]] and silver.<ref name=Jones3>{{Harvcolnb|Jones|1990|pp=179\u2013196}}, ''An Atlas of Roman Britain'', The Economy</ref> When the mines were no longer practical or profitable, they were abandoned.

In that year the Roman general [[Magnus Maximus]] would strip all of western and northern Britain of troops and senior administrators and launch a partly successful bid for imperial power, continuing to rule Britain from [[Gaul]] as emperor.<ref name=Frere1>{{Harvcolnb|Frere|1987|pp=354}}, ''Britannia'', The End of Roman Britain.</ref><ref>{{Harvcolnb|Giles|1841|pp=13}}, ''The Works of Gildas'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=3R1mCE7p44MC&pg=PA13 The History, ch. 14]. Gildas, writing c. 540, says that Maximus left Britain not only with all of its Roman troops, but also with all of its armed bands, governors, and the flower of its youth, never to return.</ref> Having left with the troops and Roman administrators, and planning to continue as the ruler of Britain in the future, his practical course was to transfer local authority to local rulers.

These tribes, including the [[Angles]] and [[Saxons]], who later became the English, were unable to make inroads into Wales except possibly along the Severn Valley as far as [[Llanidloes]].<ref>[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/tcga/tcgapdf/capelli-CB-03.pdf Chromosome survey]</ref> However, they gradually conquered eastern and southern Britain.

It has been suggested that this battle finally severed the land connection between Wales and the kingdoms of the [[Hen Ogledd]] (\"Old North\"), the Brythonic-speaking regions of what is now southern [[Scotland]] and [[northern England]], including [[Rheged]], [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]], [[Elmet]] and [[Gododdin]], where [[Old Welsh]] was also spoken.<ref>[http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_chester.html Rickard, J (9 September 2000), Battle of Chester, c.613\u2013616]</ref> From the 8th century on, Wales was by far the largest of the three remnant [[Brython]]ic areas in Britain, the other two being the Hen Ogledd and [[Cornwall]].\n\nWales was divided into a number of separate kingdoms, the largest of these being [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]] in northwest Wales and [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]] in east Wales.

This kingdom originally extended east into areas now in England, and its ancient capital, [[Pengwern]], has been variously identified as modern [[Shrewsbury]] or a site north of [[Baschurch]].<ref>Davies, J. ''A history of Wales'' p. 64.</ref> These areas were lost to the kingdom of [[Mercia]].

''A history of Wales'' pp. 65\u20136.</ref>\n\nFor a single man to rule the whole country during this period was rare. This is often ascribed to the inheritance system practised in Wales. All sons received an equal share of their father's property (including illegitimate sons), resulting in the division of territories. However, the [[Cyfraith Hywel|Welsh law]]s prescribe this system of division for land in general, not for kingdoms, where there is provision for an ''edling'' (or heir) to the kingdom to be chosen, usually by the king. Any son, legitimate or illegitimate, could be chosen as edling and there were frequently disappointed candidates prepared to challenge the chosen heir.<ref>For a discussion of this see Stephenson ''Governance of Gwynedd'' pp. 138\u2013141</ref>\n\n[[File:Laws of Hywel Dda (f.1.v) King Hywel cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|King Hywel Dda depicted in a 13th-century manuscript]]\nThe first to rule a considerable part of Wales was [[Rhodri Mawr]] (Rhodri The Great), originally king of [[Gwynedd]] during the 9th century, who was able to extend his rule to [[Powys]] and [[Ceredigion]].<ref>Maund, Kari ''The Welsh kings'' p. 50\u201354</ref> On his death his realms were divided between his sons.

The initial Norman successes were in the south, where [[William Fitzosbern, 1st Earl of Hereford|William Fitz Osbern]] overran [[Kingdom of Gwent|Gwent]] before 1070. By 1074 the forces of the [[Earl of Shrewsbury]] were ravaging [[Deheubarth]].<ref>Davies, R.R.

In 1081 [[Gruffudd ap Cynan]], who had just won the throne of Gwynedd from [[Trahaearn ap Caradog]] at the [[Battle of Mynydd Carn]] was enticed to a meeting with the [[Earl of Chester]] and [[Earl of Shrewsbury]] and promptly seized and imprisoned, leading to the seizure of much of Gwynedd by the Normans.<ref>Maund, Kari ''The Welsh kings'' p. 110.</ref> In the south [[William the Conqueror]] advanced into [[Dyfed]] founding castles and mints at [[St David's]] and [[Cardiff]].<ref>''Political Chronology of Wales'', 4\u20135.</ref> [[Rhys ap Tewdwr]] of Deheubarth was killed in 1093 in [[Brycheiniog]], and his kingdom was seized and divided between various Norman lordships.<ref>Lloyd, J.E.

[[Gruffudd ap Cynan]] was eventually able to build a strong kingdom in [[Gwynedd]]. His son, [[Owain Gwynedd]], allied with [[Gruffydd ap Rhys]] of Deheubarth won a crushing victory over the Normans at the [[Battle of Crug Mawr]] in 1136 and annexed [[Ceredigion]]. Owain followed his father on the throne of Gwynedd the following year and ruled until his death in 1170.<ref>Maund, Kari ''The Welsh kings'' pp. 162\u2013171.</ref> He was able to profit from disunity in England, where King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] and the [[Empress Matilda]] were engaged in a struggle for the throne, to extend the borders of Gwynedd further east than ever before.\n\n[[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]] also had a strong ruler at this time in [[Madog ap Maredudd]], but when his death in 1160 was quickly followed by the death of his heir, [[Llywelyn ap Madog]], Powys was split into two parts and never subsequently reunited.<ref>Lloyd, J.E. ''A History of Wales'' pp. 508\u20139.</ref> In the south, [[Gruffydd ap Rhys]] was killed in 1137, but his four sons, who all ruled Deheubarth in turn, were eventually able to win back most of their grandfather's kingdom from the Normans. The youngest of the four, [[Rhys ap Gruffydd]] (The Lord Rhys) ruled from 1155 to 1197. In 1171 Rhys met [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]] and came to an agreement with him whereby Rhys had to pay a tribute but was confirmed in all his conquests and was later named [[Justiciar of South Wales]]. Rhys held a [[1176 Cardigan eisteddfod|festival of poetry and song at his court]] at [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]] over Christmas 1176 which is generally regarded as the first recorded [[Eisteddfod]]. Owain Gwynedd's death led to the splitting of Gwynedd between his sons, while Rhys made Deheubarth dominant in Wales for a time.<ref>Lloyd, J.E. ''A History of Wales'' p. 536</ref>\n\n[[Image:Llywelyn5.jpg|180px|thumb|right|The Llywelyn Monument at Cilmeri]]\nOut of the power struggle in Gwynedd eventually arose one of the greatest of Welsh leaders, [[Llywelyn ab Iorwerth]], also known as '''Llywelyn ''Fawr''''' (the Great), who was sole ruler of Gwynedd by 1200<ref>Moore, D. ''The Welsh wars of independence'' p.108-9</ref> and by his death in 1240 was effectively ruler of much of Wales.<ref>Moore, D. ''The Welsh wars of independence'' p.124</ref> Llywelyn made his 'capital' and headquarters at [[Abergwyngregyn]] on the north coast, overlooking the [[Menai Strait]]. His son [[Dafydd ap Llywelyn]] followed him as ruler of Gwynedd, but king [[Henry III of England]] would not allow him to inherit his father's position elsewhere in Wales.<ref>Lloyd, J.E. ''A History of Wales'' p.693</ref> War broke out in 1241 and then again in 1245, and the issue was still in the balance when Dafydd died suddenly at Abergwyngregyn, without leaving an heir in early 1246. Llywelyn the Great's other son, [[Gruffudd ap Llywelyn Fawr|Gruffudd]] had been killed trying to escape from the [[Tower of London]] in 1244. Gruffudd had left four sons, and a period of internal conflict between three of these ended in the rise to power of [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]] (also known as ''Llywelyn Ein Llyw Olaf''; ''Llywelyn, Our Last Leader''). The [[Treaty of Montgomery]] in 1267 confirmed Llywelyn in control, directly or indirectly, over a large part of Wales. However, Llywelyn's claims in Wales conflicted with [[Edward I of England]], and war followed in 1277. Llywelyn was obliged to seek terms, and the [[Treaty of Aberconwy]] greatly restricted his authority. War broke out again when Llywelyn's brother [[Dafydd ap Gruffudd]] attacked [[Hawarden Castle (medieval)|Hawarden Castle]] on [[Palm Sunday]] 1282. On 11 December 1282, Llywelyn was lured into a meeting in [[Builth Wells]] [[castle]] with unknown Marchers, where he was killed and his army subsequently destroyed. His brother Dafydd ap Gruffudd continued an increasingly forlorn resistance. He was captured in June 1283 and was [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] at [[Shrewsbury]]. In effect Wales became England's first colony until it was finally annexed through the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542]].\n\n==Conquest: from the Statute of Rhuddlan to the Laws in Wales Acts 1283\u20131542==\n{{Main|Wales in the Late Middle Ages}}\n[[Image:SDJ Harlech Castle Gatehouse.jpg|left|250px|thumb| [[Harlech Castle]] was one of a series built by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] to consolidate his conquest.]]\n\nAfter the passing the [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] (1284), which restricted Welsh laws, King Edward I's ring of impressive stone [[castle]]s assisted in the domination of Wales, and he crowned his conquest by giving the title [[Prince of Wales]] to his [[Edward II of England|son]] and heir in 1301.<ref>Davies, R.R. ''Conquest, coexistence and change'' p. 386.</ref> Wales became, effectively, part of England, even though its people spoke a different language and had a different culture. English kings appointed a Council of Wales, sometimes presided over by the heir to the throne. This Council normally sat in [[Ludlow]], now in England but at that time still part of the disputed border area in the [[Welsh Marches]]. Welsh literature, particularly poetry, continued to flourish, however, with the lesser nobility now taking over from the princes as the patrons of the poets. Many consider [[Dafydd ap Gwilym]], who flourished in the middle of the 14th century, the greatest of the Welsh poets.\n\nThere were a number of rebellions including ones led by [[Madog ap Llywelyn]] in 1294\u20131295<ref>Moore, D. ''The Welsh wars of independence'' p. 159.</ref> and by [[Llywelyn Bren]], Lord of Senghenydd, in 1316\u20131318. In the 1370s the last representative in the male line of the ruling house of [[Gwynedd]], [[Owain Lawgoch]], twice planned an invasion of Wales with French support. The English government responded to the threat by sending an agent to assassinate Owain in [[Poitou]] in 1378.<ref>Moore, D. ''The Welsh wars of independence'' p.164-6</ref>\n\nIn 1400, a Welsh nobleman, [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]] (or ''Owen Glendower''), revolted against King [[Henry IV of England]]. Owain inflicted a number of defeats on the English forces and for a few years controlled most of Wales. Some of his achievements included holding the first Welsh Parliament at [[Machynlleth]] and plans for two universities. Eventually the king's forces were able to regain control of Wales and the rebellion died out, but Owain himself was never captured. His rebellion caused a great upsurge in Welsh identity and he was widely supported by Welsh people throughout the country.<ref>Moore, D. ''The Welsh Wars of Independence'' pp. 169\u201385.</ref>\n\nAs a response to Glynd\u0175r's rebellion, the English parliament passed the [[Penal Laws against Wales]]. These prohibited the Welsh from [[carrying arms]], from [[Elective rights|holding office]] and from dwelling in fortified towns. These prohibitions also applied to Englishmen who married Welsh women. These laws remained in force after the rebellion, although in practice they were gradually relaxed.<ref>Davies, J. ''A History of Wales'' p. 199.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Henry7England.jpg|160px|right|thumb|Henry Tudor, later King Henry VII]]\n\nIn the [[Wars of the Roses]] which began in 1455 both sides made considerable use of Welsh troops. The main figures in Wales were the two [[Earl of Pembroke|Earls of Pembroke]], the Yorkist Earl [[William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1423-1469)|William Herbert]] and the Lancastrian [[Jasper Tudor, 1st Duke of Bedford|Jasper Tudor]]. In 1485 Jasper's nephew, Henry Tudor, landed in Wales with a small force to launch his bid for the throne of England. Henry was of Welsh descent, counting princes such as Rhys ap Gruffydd (The Lord Rhys) among his ancestors, and his cause gained much support in Wales. Henry defeated King [[Richard III of England]] at the [[Battle of Bosworth]] with an army containing many Welsh soldiers and gained the throne as King [[Henry VII of England]].<ref>Williams, G. ''Recovery, reorientation and reformation'' pp. 217\u201326</ref>\n\nUnder his son, [[Henry VIII of England]], the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542]] were passed, integrating Wales with England in legal terms, abolishing the Welsh legal system, and banning the [[Welsh language]] from any official role or status, but it did for the first time define the England-Wales border and allowed members representing constituencies in Wales to be elected to the English Parliament.<ref>Williams, G. ''Recovery, reorientation and reformation'' pp. 268\u201373</ref> They also abolished any legal distinction between the Welsh and the English, thereby effectively ending the Penal Code although this was not formally repealed.<ref>Davies, J. ''A History of Wales'' p.233</ref>\n\n==Early modern period==\nFollowing [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s break with Rome and the Pope, Wales for the most part followed England in accepting [[Anglicanism]], although a number of [[Catholic Church|Catholic]]s were active in attempting to counteract this and produced some of the earliest books printed in Welsh.

The [[Second English Civil War]] began when unpaid Parliamentarian troops in [[Pembrokeshire]] changed sides in early 1648.<ref>Davies, J. ''A History of Wales'' p. 280</ref> Colonel [[Thomas Horton (soldier)|Thomas Horton]] defeated the Royalist rebels at the [[battle of St. Fagans]] in May and the rebel leaders surrendered to Cromwell on 11 July after the protracted two-month [[siege of Pembroke]].\n\nEducation in Wales was at a very low ebb in this period, with the only education available being in English while the majority of the population spoke only Welsh. In 1731 [[Griffith Jones (Llanddowror)|Griffith Jones]] started circulating schools in [[Carmarthenshire]], held in one location for about three months before moving (or \"circulating\") to another location. The language of instruction in these schools was Welsh. By Griffith Jones' death, in 1761, it is estimated that up to 250,000 people had learnt to read in schools throughout Wales.<ref>Jenkins, G. H. ''The foundations of modern Wales'' pp. 370\u2013377</ref>\n\nThe 18th century also saw the [[Welsh Methodist revival]], led by [[Daniel Rowland (preacher)|Daniel Rowland]], [[Howell Harris]] and [[William Williams Pantycelyn]].<ref>Jenkins, G.H. ''The foundations of modern Wales'' pp. 347\u201350</ref> In the early 19th century the Welsh [[Methodist]]s broke away from the [[Anglican]] church and established their own denomination, now the [[Presbyterian Church of Wales]]. This also led to the strengthening of other nonconformist denominations, and by the middle of the 19th century Wales was largely [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]] in religion. This had considerable implications for the Welsh language as it was the main language of the nonconformist churches in Wales. The [[Sunday schools]] which became an important feature of Welsh life made a large part of the population literate in Welsh, which was important for the survival of the language as it was not taught in the schools.\n\nThe end of the 18th century saw the beginnings of the [[Industrial Revolution]], and the presence of iron ore, [[limestone]] and large coal deposits in south-east Wales meant that this area soon saw the establishment of [[ironworks]] and coal mines, notably the [[Cyfarthfa Ironworks]] and the [[Dowlais Ironworks]] at [[Merthyr Tydfil]].\n\n==Modern history==\n{{Main|Modern history of Wales}}\n\n===Population===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n| width=\"60\" | '''Year'''\n| width=\"85\" | '''Population'''<ref>{{cite book|author=John Davies|title=A History of Wales|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogTq2KRuu9IC&pg=PT257|year=1993|pages=258\u201359, 319|isbn=9780141926339}}; Census 2001, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090319202324/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/bicentenary/pdfs/wales.pdf ''200 Years of the Census in ...

''Rebirth of a nation'' pp. 46\u20137</ref>\n\nThe first decade of the 20th century was the period of the coal boom in South Wales, when population growth exceeded 20 per cent.<ref name=\"P Jenkins\">Jenkins, P. (1992) ''A History of Modern Wales''.

Gareth (1989) ''A History of Wales 1815\u20131906''. Cardiff: University of Wales Press.</ref>\n\n[[Kenneth O. Morgan]] argues that the 1850\u20131914 era:\n: was a story of growing political democracy with the hegemony of the Liberals in national and local government, of an increasingly thriving economy in the valleys of south Wales, the world\u2019s dominant coal-exporting area with massive ports at Cardiff and Barry, an increasingly buoyant literature and a revival in the eisteddfod, and of much vitality in the nonconformist chapels especially after the short-lived impetus from the \u2018great revival\u2019, Y Diwygiad Mawr, of 1904\u20135. Overall, there was a pervasive sense of strong national identity, with a national museum, a national library and a national university as its vanguard.<ref>Kenneth O. Kenneth, ''Kenneth O. Morgan: My Histories'' (University of Wales Press, 2015) p 95.</ref>\n\n===1914\u20131945===\nThe world wars and interwar period were hard times for Wales, in terms of the faltering economy of antiwar losses, and a deep sense of insecurity. Men eagerly volunteered for war service.<ref>Gervase Phillips, \"Dai bach y soldiwr: Welsh soldiers in the British Army, 1914\u20131918.\" Llafur 6 (1993): 94-105.</ref>   Morgan argues:\n:1914\u201345, there was an abrupt and corrosive change.  First World War was an ordeal not only for the loss of life, but for the startling collapse of economic life in south Wales and much resultant social deprivation. The war also saw the downfall of Lloyd George\u2019s Liberal Party and the concordant national revival of pre-1914. The Welsh-speaking world went into retreat, though there was powerful compensation in the proliferating Anglo-Welsh poetry and prose of [[Dylan Thomas]] and many others. The Second World War brought more upheaval, though also the birth of a revival of the south Wales economy through the stimulus provided by the Board of Trade.<ref name=\"Morgan, 2015 p 95\">Morgan, ''My Histories'' (2015) p 95.</ref>\n\nThe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] replaced the Liberals as the dominant party in Wales after the [[First World War]], particularly in the industrial valleys of [[South Wales]].  Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 but initially its growth was slow and it gained few votes at parliamentary elections.<ref>Morgan, K.O. ''Rebirth of a nation'' p.206-8, 272</ref>\n\n===Since 1945===\nMorgan characterizes the recent period as:\n:one of broad renewal, political resurgence under the Labour Party and unions, a marked revival of economic growth, with much great material affluence and social welfare. The final period saw a phenomenon little in evidence before 1939, a strong movement towards political nationalism, some success for Plaid Cymru and, after the Kilbrandon Commission, a major attempt to pass Welsh devolution.<ref name=\"Morgan, 2015 p 95\"/>\n\nThe coal industry steadily declined after 1945.<ref>Davies, ''A history of Wales'' p. 533</ref> By the early 1990s there was only one deep pit still working in Wales. There was a similar catastrophic decline in the steel industry (the [[steel crisis]]), and the Welsh economy, like that of other developed societies, became increasingly based on the expanding service sector.\n\nIn May 1997, a Labour government was elected with a promise of creating devolved institutions in Scotland and Wales. In late 1997 a referendum was held on the issue which resulted a \"yes\" vote. The [[Welsh Assembly]] was set up in 1999 (as a consequence of the [[Government of Wales Act 1998]]) and possesses the power to determine how the government budget for Wales is spent and administered.\n\nThe results of the 2001 Census showed an increase in the number of Welsh speakers to 21% of the population aged 3 and older, compared with 18.7% in 1991 and 19.0% in 1981. This compares with a pattern of steady decline indicated by census results during the 20th century.<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=447 Results of the 2001 Census from www.statistics.gov.uk]</ref> The 2011 census showed that decline to have resumed. Though still higher than in 1991, the number of people aged 3 and over able to speak Welsh in Wales decreased from 582,000 (20.8 per cent) in 2001, to 562,000 (19.0 per cent) in 2011.<ref>http://wales.gov.uk/topics/statistics/headlines/population2012/121211/?lang=en</ref>\n\nThe Government of Wales Act 2006 (c 32) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that reformed the [[National Assembly for Wales]] and allows further powers to be granted to it more easily. The Act creates a system of government with a separate executive drawn from and accountable to the legislature. Following a successful referendum in 2011 on extending the law making powers of the National Assembly it is now able to make laws, known as Acts of the Assembly, on all matters in devolved subject areas, without needing the UK Parliament's agreement. In the 2016 referendum, Wales joined England in endorsing Brexit and rejecting membership in the European Union.\n\n==Religion==\n{{Main|Christianity in Wales|Celtic Christianity}}\n\n===Reformation===\nBishop [[Richard Davies (bishop)|Richard Davies]] and dissident Protestant cleric [[John Penry]] introduced Calvinist theology to Wales. They used the model of the [[Synod of Dort]] of 1618\u20131619. Calvinism developed through the Puritan period, following the restoration of the monarchy under Charles II, and within Wales' Methodist movement. However few copies of Calvin's works were available before the mid-19th century.<ref>D. Densil Morgan, \"Calvinism in Wales: c.1590\u20131909,\" ''Welsh Journal of Religious History'' (2009), Vol. 4, p22-36</ref>  In 1567 Davies, [[William Salesbury]], and [[Thomas Huet]] completed the first modern translation of the New Testament and the first translation of the ''Book of Common Prayer'' ({{lang-cy|Y Llyfr Gweddi Gyffredin}}). In 1588 [[William Morgan (Bible translator)|William Morgan]] completed a translation of the whole Bible. These translations were as important to the survival of the Welsh language and had the effect of conferring status on Welsh as a [[liturgical language]] and vehicle for worship. This had a significant role in its continued use as a means of everyday communication and as a literary language down to the present day despite the pressure of English.\n\n===Nonconformity===\n{{Main|Nonconformity in Wales}}\n[[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformity]] was a significant influence in Wales from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries. The [[Welsh Methodist revival]] of the 18th century was one of the most significant religious and social movements in the history of Wales. The revival began within the [[Church of England]] in Wales and at the beginning remained as a group within it, but the Welsh revival differed from the Methodist revival in England in that its theology was [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] rather than [[Arminianism|Arminian]]. Welsh Methodists gradually built up their own networks, structures, and even meeting houses (or chapels), which led eventually to the secession of 1811 and the formal establishment of the Calvinistic Methodist [[Presbyterian church of Wales]] in 1823.<ref>Peter Yalden,  \"Association, Community and the Origins of Secularisation: English and Welsh Nonconformity, c. 1850\u20131930.\" ''Journal of Ecclesiastical History'' 55#2 (2004): 293-324.</ref>\n\nThe Welsh Methodist revival also had an influence on the older [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] churches, or [[dissenter]]s&nbsp; the [[Baptists]] and the [[Congregationalist church|Congregationalists]]&nbsp; who in turn also experienced growth and renewal. As a result, by the middle of the nineteenth century, Wales was predominantly a [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] country.\n\nThe [[1904\u20131905 Welsh Revival]] was the largest full scale Christian [[Revivalism|Revival]] of Wales of the 20th century. It is believed that at least 100,000 people became Christians during the 1904\u20131905 revival, but despite this it did not put a stop to the gradual decline of Christianity in Wales, only holding it back slightly.<ref>Edward J. Gitre, \"The 1904\u201305 Welsh Revival: Modernization, Technologies, and Techniques of the Self.\" ''Church history'' 73#4 (2004): 792-827.</ref>\n\n==Historiography==\nUntil recently, says Martin Johnes:\n:the historiography of modern Wales was rather narrow. Its domain was the fortunes of the Liberals and Labour, the impact of trade unions and protest, and the cultural realms of nonconformity and the Welsh language. This was not surprising\u2014all emergent fields start with the big topics and the big questions\u2014but it did give much of Welsh academic history a rather particular flavour. It was institutional and male, and yet still concerned with fields of enquiry that lay outside the confines of the British establishment.<ref>Martin Johnes, Review, ''20 Century British History'' (2016) 27#3 p 492</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[History of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Archaeology of Wales]]\n* [[History of women in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Economic history of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[List of Anglo-Welsh Wars]]\n* [[The Red Dragon (magazine)|''The Red Dragon'']]\n* [[Cambrian Quarterly Magazine and Celtic Repertory|''The Cambrian Quarterly Magazine and Celtic Repertory'']]\n* [[British military history]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading and references==\n{{Refbegin}}\n<div style=\"{{column-width}}\">\n* Beddoe, Deirdre.

The Romans [[End of Roman rule in Britain|departed from Britain]] in the 5th century, opening the door for the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|Anglo-Saxon invasion]]. Thereafter Brittonic language and culture began to splinter, and several distinct groups formed. The [[Welsh people]] were the largest of these groups, and are generally discussed independently of the other surviving [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]]-speaking peoples after the 11th century.<ref name=\"KochBritons\"/>\n\nA number of kingdoms formed in present-day Wales in the [[sub-Roman Britain|post-Roman]] period. While the most powerful ruler was acknowledged as [[King of the Britons]] (later ''[[Tywysog|Tywysog Cymru]]'': ''Leader'' or ''Prince of Wales''), and some rulers extended their control over other Welsh territories and into western England, none were able to unite Wales for long. Internecine struggles and external pressure from the English and later, the [[Normans|Norman]] conquerors of England, led to the Welsh kingdoms coming gradually under the sway of the English crown. In 1282, the death of [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]] led to the [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I|conquest]] of the [[Principality of Wales]] by King [[Edward I of England]]; afterwards, the [[heir apparent]] to the English monarch has borne the title \"[[Prince of Wales]]\". The Welsh launched several revolts against English rule, the last significant one being that led by [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]] in the early 15th century. In the 16th century [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], himself of Welsh extraction as a great grandson of [[Owen Tudor]], passed the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542|Laws in Wales Acts]] aiming to fully incorporate Wales into the [[Kingdom of England]]. Under England's authority, Wales became part of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1707 and then the United Kingdom in 1801. Yet, the Welsh retained their language and culture despite heavy English dominance. The publication of the extremely significant first complete [[Welsh Bible|Welsh translation of the Bible]] by [[William Morgan (Bible translator)|William Morgan]] in 1588 greatly advanced the position of Welsh as a [[literary language]].<ref name=Morgan>{{cite book|last=Davies|first=John (Ed)|authorlink=John Davies (historian)|title=The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales|publisher=University of Wales Press|year=2008|location=Cardiff|page=572|isbn=978-0-7083-1953-6 }}</ref>\n\nThe 18th century saw the beginnings of two changes that would greatly affect Wales, the [[Welsh Methodist revival]], which led the country to turn increasingly [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] in religion, and the [[Industrial Revolution]].

Wales played a considerable role during World War Two along with the rest of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Allies, and its cities were bombed extensively during the Nazi Blitz. The nationalist party [[Plaid Cymru]] gained momentum from the 1960s.

Roman rule in Wales was a military occupation, save for the southern coastal region of [[South Wales]] east of the [[Gower Peninsula]], where there is a legacy of Romanisation.<ref name=Jones1>{{Harvcolnb|Jones|1990|pp=151}}, ''An Atlas of Roman Britain'', The Development of the Provinces.</ref> The only town in Wales founded by the Romans, [[Caerwent]], is located in South Wales.

As part of the [[Roman conquest of Britain]], a series of campaigns to conquer Wales was launched by his successor in 48 and would continue intermittently under successive [[Roman governors of Britain|governors]] until the conquest was completed in 78. It is these campaigns of conquest that are the most widely known feature of Wales during the [[Roman Empire|Roman era]] due to the spirited but unsuccessful defence of their homelands by two native tribes, the [[Silures]] and the [[Ordovices]].\n\nThe [[Demetae]] of southwestern Wales seem to have quickly made their peace with the Romans, as there is no indication of war with Rome, and their homeland was not heavily planted with forts nor overlaid with roads. The Demetae would be the only Welsh tribe to emerge from Roman rule with their homeland and tribal name intact.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Giles|1841|pp=27}}, ''The Works of Gildas'', ''De Excidio'', ch. 31: Gildas, writing c. 540, condemns the \"tyrant of the Demetians\".</ref>\n\nWales was a rich source of mineral wealth and the Romans used their [[Roman engineering|engineering]] [[Roman technology|technology]] to extract large amounts of gold, copper, and lead, as well as modest amounts of some other metals such as [[zinc]] and silver.<ref name=Jones3>{{Harvcolnb|Jones|1990|pp=179\u2013196}}, ''An Atlas of Roman Britain'', The Economy</ref> When the mines were no longer practical or profitable, they were abandoned. Roman economic development was concentrated in southeastern Britain, with no significant industries located in Wales.<ref name=Jones3/> This was largely a matter of circumstance, as Wales had none of the needed materials in suitable combination, and the forested, mountainous countryside was not amenable to development.\n\nThe year 383 denotes a significant point in Welsh history, remembered in literature and considered to be the foundation point of several medieval royal dynasties. In that year the Roman general [[Magnus Maximus]] would strip all of western and northern Britain of troops and senior administrators and launch a partly successful bid for imperial power, continuing to rule Britain from [[Gaul]] as emperor.<ref name=Frere1>{{Harvcolnb|Frere|1987|pp=354}}, ''Britannia'', The End of Roman Britain.</ref><ref>{{Harvcolnb|Giles|1841|pp=13}}, ''The Works of Gildas'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=3R1mCE7p44MC&pg=PA13 The History, ch. 14]. Gildas, writing c. 540, says that Maximus left Britain not only with all of its Roman troops, but also with all of its armed bands, governors, and the flower of its youth, never to return.</ref> Having left with the troops and Roman administrators, and planning to continue as the ruler of Britain in the future, his practical course was to transfer local authority to local rulers.

She asks that her father be given sovereignty over Britain, thus formalising the transfer of authority from Rome back to the Britons themselves. The marriage also makes possible British descendants, a point not lost on medieval kings.

However, the [[Cyfraith Hywel|Welsh law]]s prescribe this system of division for land in general, not for kingdoms, where there is provision for an ''edling'' (or heir) to the kingdom to be chosen, usually by the king.

In 1081 [[Gruffudd ap Cynan]], who had just won the throne of Gwynedd from [[Trahaearn ap Caradog]] at the [[Battle of Mynydd Carn]] was enticed to a meeting with the [[Earl of Chester]] and [[Earl of Shrewsbury]] and promptly seized and imprisoned, leading to the seizure of much of Gwynedd by the Normans.<ref>Maund, Kari ''The Welsh kings'' p. 110.</ref> In the south [[William the Conqueror]] advanced into [[Dyfed]] founding castles and mints at [[St David's]] and [[Cardiff]].<ref>''Political Chronology of Wales'', 4\u20135.</ref> [[Rhys ap Tewdwr]] of Deheubarth was killed in 1093 in [[Brycheiniog]], and his kingdom was seized and divided between various Norman lordships.<ref>Lloyd, J.E.

[[Gruffudd ap Cynan]] was eventually able to build a strong kingdom in [[Gwynedd]]. His son, [[Owain Gwynedd]], allied with [[Gruffydd ap Rhys]] of Deheubarth won a crushing victory over the Normans at the [[Battle of Crug Mawr]] in 1136 and annexed [[Ceredigion]]. Owain followed his father on the throne of Gwynedd the following year and ruled until his death in 1170.<ref>Maund, Kari ''The Welsh kings'' pp. 162\u2013171.</ref> He was able to profit from disunity in England, where King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] and the [[Empress Matilda]] were engaged in a struggle for the throne, to extend the borders of Gwynedd further east than ever before.\n\n[[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]] also had a strong ruler at this time in [[Madog ap Maredudd]], but when his death in 1160 was quickly followed by the death of his heir, [[Llywelyn ap Madog]], Powys was split into two parts and never subsequently reunited.<ref>Lloyd, J.E. ''A History of Wales'' pp. 508\u20139.</ref> In the south, [[Gruffydd ap Rhys]] was killed in 1137, but his four sons, who all ruled Deheubarth in turn, were eventually able to win back most of their grandfather's kingdom from the Normans. The youngest of the four, [[Rhys ap Gruffydd]] (The Lord Rhys) ruled from 1155 to 1197. In 1171 Rhys met [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]] and came to an agreement with him whereby Rhys had to pay a tribute but was confirmed in all his conquests and was later named [[Justiciar of South Wales]]. Rhys held a [[1176 Cardigan eisteddfod|festival of poetry and song at his court]] at [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]] over Christmas 1176 which is generally regarded as the first recorded [[Eisteddfod]]. Owain Gwynedd's death led to the splitting of Gwynedd between his sons, while Rhys made Deheubarth dominant in Wales for a time.<ref>Lloyd, J.E. ''A History of Wales'' p. 536</ref>\n\n[[Image:Llywelyn5.jpg|180px|thumb|right|The Llywelyn Monument at Cilmeri]]\nOut of the power struggle in Gwynedd eventually arose one of the greatest of Welsh leaders, [[Llywelyn ab Iorwerth]], also known as '''Llywelyn ''Fawr''''' (the Great), who was sole ruler of Gwynedd by 1200<ref>Moore, D. ''The Welsh wars of independence'' p.108-9</ref> and by his death in 1240 was effectively ruler of much of Wales.<ref>Moore, D. ''The Welsh wars of independence'' p.124</ref> Llywelyn made his 'capital' and headquarters at [[Abergwyngregyn]] on the north coast, overlooking the [[Menai Strait]]. His son [[Dafydd ap Llywelyn]] followed him as ruler of Gwynedd, but king [[Henry III of England]] would not allow him to inherit his father's position elsewhere in Wales.<ref>Lloyd, J.E. ''A History of Wales'' p.693</ref> War broke out in 1241 and then again in 1245, and the issue was still in the balance when Dafydd died suddenly at Abergwyngregyn, without leaving an heir in early 1246. Llywelyn the Great's other son, [[Gruffudd ap Llywelyn Fawr|Gruffudd]] had been killed trying to escape from the [[Tower of London]] in 1244. Gruffudd had left four sons, and a period of internal conflict between three of these ended in the rise to power of [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]] (also known as ''Llywelyn Ein Llyw Olaf''; ''Llywelyn, Our Last Leader''). The [[Treaty of Montgomery]] in 1267 confirmed Llywelyn in control, directly or indirectly, over a large part of Wales. However, Llywelyn's claims in Wales conflicted with [[Edward I of England]], and war followed in 1277. Llywelyn was obliged to seek terms, and the [[Treaty of Aberconwy]] greatly restricted his authority. War broke out again when Llywelyn's brother [[Dafydd ap Gruffudd]] attacked [[Hawarden Castle (medieval)|Hawarden Castle]] on [[Palm Sunday]] 1282. On 11 December 1282, Llywelyn was lured into a meeting in [[Builth Wells]] [[castle]] with unknown Marchers, where he was killed and his army subsequently destroyed. His brother Dafydd ap Gruffudd continued an increasingly forlorn resistance. He was captured in June 1283 and was [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] at [[Shrewsbury]]. In effect Wales became England's first colony until it was finally annexed through the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542]].\n\n==Conquest: from the Statute of Rhuddlan to the Laws in Wales Acts 1283\u20131542==\n{{Main|Wales in the Late Middle Ages}}\n[[Image:SDJ Harlech Castle Gatehouse.jpg|left|250px|thumb| [[Harlech Castle]] was one of a series built by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] to consolidate his conquest.]]\n\nAfter the passing the [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] (1284), which restricted Welsh laws, King Edward I's ring of impressive stone [[castle]]s assisted in the domination of Wales, and he crowned his conquest by giving the title [[Prince of Wales]] to his [[Edward II of England|son]] and heir in 1301.<ref>Davies, R.R. ''Conquest, coexistence and change'' p. 386.</ref> Wales became, effectively, part of England, even though its people spoke a different language and had a different culture. English kings appointed a Council of Wales, sometimes presided over by the heir to the throne. This Council normally sat in [[Ludlow]], now in England but at that time still part of the disputed border area in the [[Welsh Marches]]. Welsh literature, particularly poetry, continued to flourish, however, with the lesser nobility now taking over from the princes as the patrons of the poets. Many consider [[Dafydd ap Gwilym]], who flourished in the middle of the 14th century, the greatest of the Welsh poets.\n\nThere were a number of rebellions including ones led by [[Madog ap Llywelyn]] in 1294\u20131295<ref>Moore, D. ''The Welsh wars of independence'' p. 159.</ref> and by [[Llywelyn Bren]], Lord of Senghenydd, in 1316\u20131318. In the 1370s the last representative in the male line of the ruling house of [[Gwynedd]], [[Owain Lawgoch]], twice planned an invasion of Wales with French support. The English government responded to the threat by sending an agent to assassinate Owain in [[Poitou]] in 1378.<ref>Moore, D. ''The Welsh wars of independence'' p.164-6</ref>\n\nIn 1400, a Welsh nobleman, [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]] (or ''Owen Glendower''), revolted against King [[Henry IV of England]]. Owain inflicted a number of defeats on the English forces and for a few years controlled most of Wales. Some of his achievements included holding the first Welsh Parliament at [[Machynlleth]] and plans for two universities. Eventually the king's forces were able to regain control of Wales and the rebellion died out, but Owain himself was never captured. His rebellion caused a great upsurge in Welsh identity and he was widely supported by Welsh people throughout the country.<ref>Moore, D. ''The Welsh Wars of Independence'' pp. 169\u201385.</ref>\n\nAs a response to Glynd\u0175r's rebellion, the English parliament passed the [[Penal Laws against Wales]]. These prohibited the Welsh from [[carrying arms]], from [[Elective rights|holding office]] and from dwelling in fortified towns. These prohibitions also applied to Englishmen who married Welsh women. These laws remained in force after the rebellion, although in practice they were gradually relaxed.<ref>Davies, J. ''A History of Wales'' p. 199.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Henry7England.jpg|160px|right|thumb|Henry Tudor, later King Henry VII]]\n\nIn the [[Wars of the Roses]] which began in 1455 both sides made considerable use of Welsh troops. The main figures in Wales were the two [[Earl of Pembroke|Earls of Pembroke]], the Yorkist Earl [[William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1423-1469)|William Herbert]] and the Lancastrian [[Jasper Tudor, 1st Duke of Bedford|Jasper Tudor]]. In 1485 Jasper's nephew, Henry Tudor, landed in Wales with a small force to launch his bid for the throne of England. Henry was of Welsh descent, counting princes such as Rhys ap Gruffydd (The Lord Rhys) among his ancestors, and his cause gained much support in Wales. Henry defeated King [[Richard III of England]] at the [[Battle of Bosworth]] with an army containing many Welsh soldiers and gained the throne as King [[Henry VII of England]].<ref>Williams, G. ''Recovery, reorientation and reformation'' pp. 217\u201326</ref>\n\nUnder his son, [[Henry VIII of England]], the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542]] were passed, integrating Wales with England in legal terms, abolishing the Welsh legal system, and banning the [[Welsh language]] from any official role or status, but it did for the first time define the England-Wales border and allowed members representing constituencies in Wales to be elected to the English Parliament.<ref>Williams, G. ''Recovery, reorientation and reformation'' pp. 268\u201373</ref> They also abolished any legal distinction between the Welsh and the English, thereby effectively ending the Penal Code although this was not formally repealed.<ref>Davies, J. ''A History of Wales'' p.233</ref>\n\n==Early modern period==\nFollowing [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s break with Rome and the Pope, Wales for the most part followed England in accepting [[Anglicanism]], although a number of [[Catholic Church|Catholic]]s were active in attempting to counteract this and produced some of the earliest books printed in Welsh. In 1588 [[William Morgan (Bible translator)|William Morgan]] produced the first complete translation of the [[Welsh Bible]].<ref name=Morgan/><ref>Williams, G. ''Recovery, reorientation and reformation'' pp. 322\u20133</ref> Morgan's Bible is one of the most significant books in the Welsh language, and its publication greatly increased the stature and scope of the Welsh language and [[Literature of Wales (Welsh language)|literature]].<ref name=Morgan/>\n\nWales was overwhelmingly [[Cavalier|Royalist]] in the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] in the early 17th century though there were some notable exceptions such as [[John Jones Maesygarnedd]] and the [[Puritan]] writer [[Morgan Llwyd]].<ref>Jenkins, G. H. ''The foundations of modern Wales'' p. 7</ref> Wales was an important source of men for the armies of King [[Charles I of England]],<ref>Jenkins, G. H. ''The foundations of modern Wales'' p. 5-6</ref> though no major battles took place in Wales. The [[Second English Civil War]] began when unpaid Parliamentarian troops in [[Pembrokeshire]] changed sides in early 1648.<ref>Davies, J. ''A History of Wales'' p. 280</ref> Colonel [[Thomas Horton (soldier)|Thomas Horton]] defeated the Royalist rebels at the [[battle of St. Fagans]] in May and the rebel leaders surrendered to Cromwell on 11 July after the protracted two-month [[siege of Pembroke]].\n\nEducation in Wales was at a very low ebb in this period, with the only education available being in English while the majority of the population spoke only Welsh. In 1731 [[Griffith Jones (Llanddowror)|Griffith Jones]] started circulating schools in [[Carmarthenshire]], held in one location for about three months before moving (or \"circulating\") to another location. The language of instruction in these schools was Welsh. By Griffith Jones' death, in 1761, it is estimated that up to 250,000 people had learnt to read in schools throughout Wales.<ref>Jenkins, G. H. ''The foundations of modern Wales'' pp. 370\u2013377</ref>\n\nThe 18th century also saw the [[Welsh Methodist revival]], led by [[Daniel Rowland (preacher)|Daniel Rowland]], [[Howell Harris]] and [[William Williams Pantycelyn]].<ref>Jenkins, G.H. ''The foundations of modern Wales'' pp. 347\u201350</ref> In the early 19th century the Welsh [[Methodist]]s broke away from the [[Anglican]] church and established their own denomination, now the [[Presbyterian Church of Wales]]. This also led to the strengthening of other nonconformist denominations, and by the middle of the 19th century Wales was largely [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]] in religion. This had considerable implications for the Welsh language as it was the main language of the nonconformist churches in Wales. The [[Sunday schools]] which became an important feature of Welsh life made a large part of the population literate in Welsh, which was important for the survival of the language as it was not taught in the schools.\n\nThe end of the 18th century saw the beginnings of the [[Industrial Revolution]], and the presence of iron ore, [[limestone]] and large coal deposits in south-east Wales meant that this area soon saw the establishment of [[ironworks]] and coal mines, notably the [[Cyfarthfa Ironworks]] and the [[Dowlais Ironworks]] at [[Merthyr Tydfil]].\n\n==Modern history==\n{{Main|Modern history of Wales}}\n\n===Population===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n| width=\"60\" | '''Year'''\n| width=\"85\" | '''Population'''<ref>{{cite book|author=John Davies|title=A History of Wales|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogTq2KRuu9IC&pg=PT257|year=1993|pages=258\u201359, 319|isbn=9780141926339}}; Census 2001, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090319202324/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/bicentenary/pdfs/wales.pdf ''200 Years of the Census in ...

''Rebirth of a nation'' pp. 46\u20137</ref>\n\nThe first decade of the 20th century was the period of the coal boom in South Wales, when population growth exceeded 20 per cent.<ref name=\"P Jenkins\">Jenkins, P. (1992) ''A History of Modern Wales''.

Gareth (1989) ''A History of Wales 1815\u20131906''. Cardiff: University of Wales Press.</ref>\n\n[[Kenneth O. Morgan]] argues that the 1850\u20131914 era:\n: was a story of growing political democracy with the hegemony of the Liberals in national and local government, of an increasingly thriving economy in the valleys of south Wales, the world\u2019s dominant coal-exporting area with massive ports at Cardiff and Barry, an increasingly buoyant literature and a revival in the eisteddfod, and of much vitality in the nonconformist chapels especially after the short-lived impetus from the \u2018great revival\u2019, Y Diwygiad Mawr, of 1904\u20135. Overall, there was a pervasive sense of strong national identity, with a national museum, a national library and a national university as its vanguard.<ref>Kenneth O. Kenneth, ''Kenneth O. Morgan: My Histories'' (University of Wales Press, 2015) p 95.</ref>\n\n===1914\u20131945===\nThe world wars and interwar period were hard times for Wales, in terms of the faltering economy of antiwar losses, and a deep sense of insecurity. Men eagerly volunteered for war service.<ref>Gervase Phillips, \"Dai bach y soldiwr: Welsh soldiers in the British Army, 1914\u20131918.\" Llafur 6 (1993): 94-105.</ref>   Morgan argues:\n:1914\u201345, there was an abrupt and corrosive change.  First World War was an ordeal not only for the loss of life, but for the startling collapse of economic life in south Wales and much resultant social deprivation. The war also saw the downfall of Lloyd George\u2019s Liberal Party and the concordant national revival of pre-1914. The Welsh-speaking world went into retreat, though there was powerful compensation in the proliferating Anglo-Welsh poetry and prose of [[Dylan Thomas]] and many others. The Second World War brought more upheaval, though also the birth of a revival of the south Wales economy through the stimulus provided by the Board of Trade.<ref name=\"Morgan, 2015 p 95\">Morgan, ''My Histories'' (2015) p 95.</ref>\n\nThe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] replaced the Liberals as the dominant party in Wales after the [[First World War]], particularly in the industrial valleys of [[South Wales]].  Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 but initially its growth was slow and it gained few votes at parliamentary elections.<ref>Morgan, K.O. ''Rebirth of a nation'' p.206-8, 272</ref>\n\n===Since 1945===\nMorgan characterizes the recent period as:\n:one of broad renewal, political resurgence under the Labour Party and unions, a marked revival of economic growth, with much great material affluence and social welfare. The final period saw a phenomenon little in evidence before 1939, a strong movement towards political nationalism, some success for Plaid Cymru and, after the Kilbrandon Commission, a major attempt to pass Welsh devolution.<ref name=\"Morgan, 2015 p 95\"/>\n\nThe coal industry steadily declined after 1945.<ref>Davies, ''A history of Wales'' p. 533</ref> By the early 1990s there was only one deep pit still working in Wales. There was a similar catastrophic decline in the steel industry (the [[steel crisis]]), and the Welsh economy, like that of other developed societies, became increasingly based on the expanding service sector.\n\nIn May 1997, a Labour government was elected with a promise of creating devolved institutions in Scotland and Wales. In late 1997 a referendum was held on the issue which resulted a \"yes\" vote. The [[Welsh Assembly]] was set up in 1999 (as a consequence of the [[Government of Wales Act 1998]]) and possesses the power to determine how the government budget for Wales is spent and administered.\n\nThe results of the 2001 Census showed an increase in the number of Welsh speakers to 21% of the population aged 3 and older, compared with 18.7% in 1991 and 19.0% in 1981. This compares with a pattern of steady decline indicated by census results during the 20th century.<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=447 Results of the 2001 Census from www.statistics.gov.uk]</ref> The 2011 census showed that decline to have resumed. Though still higher than in 1991, the number of people aged 3 and over able to speak Welsh in Wales decreased from 582,000 (20.8 per cent) in 2001, to 562,000 (19.0 per cent) in 2011.<ref>http://wales.gov.uk/topics/statistics/headlines/population2012/121211/?lang=en</ref>\n\nThe Government of Wales Act 2006 (c 32) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that reformed the [[National Assembly for Wales]] and allows further powers to be granted to it more easily. The Act creates a system of government with a separate executive drawn from and accountable to the legislature. Following a successful referendum in 2011 on extending the law making powers of the National Assembly it is now able to make laws, known as Acts of the Assembly, on all matters in devolved subject areas, without needing the UK Parliament's agreement. In the 2016 referendum, Wales joined England in endorsing Brexit and rejecting membership in the European Union.\n\n==Religion==\n{{Main|Christianity in Wales|Celtic Christianity}}\n\n===Reformation===\nBishop [[Richard Davies (bishop)|Richard Davies]] and dissident Protestant cleric [[John Penry]] introduced Calvinist theology to Wales. They used the model of the [[Synod of Dort]] of 1618-1619. Calvinism developed through the Puritan period, following the restoration of the monarchy under Charles II, and within Wales' Methodist movement. However few copies of Calvin's works were available before the mid-19th century.<ref>D. Densil Morgan, \"Calvinism in Wales: c.1590\u20131909,\" ''Welsh Journal of Religious History'' (2009), Vol. 4, p22-36</ref>  In 1567 Davies, [[William Salesbury]], and [[Thomas Huet]] completed the first modern translation of the New Testament and the first translation of the ''Book of Common Prayer'' ({{lang-cy|Y Llyfr Gweddi Gyffredin}}). In 1588 [[William Morgan (Bible translator)|William Morgan]] completed a translation of the whole Bible. These translations were as important to the survival of the Welsh language and had the effect of conferring status on Welsh as a [[liturgical language]] and vehicle for worship. This had a significant role in its continued use as a means of everyday communication and as a literary language down to the present day despite the pressure of English.\n\n===Nonconformity===\n{{Main|Nonconformity in Wales}}\n[[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformity]] was a significant influence in Wales from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries. The [[Welsh Methodist revival]] of the 18th century was one of the most significant religious and social movements in the history of Wales. The revival began within the [[Church of England]] in Wales and at the beginning remained as a group within it, but the Welsh revival differed from the Methodist revival in England in that its theology was [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] rather than [[Arminianism|Arminian]]. Welsh Methodists gradually built up their own networks, structures, and even meeting houses (or chapels), which led eventually to the secession of 1811 and the formal establishment of the Calvinistic Methodist [[Presbyterian church of Wales]] in 1823.<ref>Peter Yalden,  \"Association, Community and the Origins of Secularisation: English and Welsh Nonconformity, c. 1850\u20131930.\" ''Journal of Ecclesiastical History'' 55#2 (2004): 293-324.</ref>\n\nThe Welsh Methodist revival also had an influence on the older [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] churches, or [[dissenter]]s&nbsp; the [[Baptists]] and the [[Congregationalist church|Congregationalists]]&nbsp; who in turn also experienced growth and renewal. As a result, by the middle of the nineteenth century, Wales was predominantly a [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] country.\n\nThe [[1904\u20131905 Welsh Revival]] was the largest full scale Christian [[Revivalism|Revival]] of Wales of the 20th century. It is believed that at least 100,000 people became Christians during the 1904\u20131905 revival, but despite this it did not put a stop to the gradual decline of Christianity in Wales, only holding it back slightly.<ref>Edward J. Gitre, \"The 1904\u201305 Welsh Revival: Modernization, Technologies, and Techniques of the Self.\" ''Church history'' 73#4 (2004): 792-827.</ref>\n\n==Historiography==\nUntil recently, says Martin Johnes:\n:the historiography of modern Wales was rather narrow. Its domain was the fortunes of the Liberals and Labour, the impact of trade unions and protest, and the cultural realms of nonconformity and the Welsh language. This was not surprising\u2014all emergent fields start with the big topics and the big questions\u2014but it did give much of Welsh academic history a rather particular flavour. It was institutional and male, and yet still concerned with fields of enquiry that lay outside the confines of the British establishment.<ref>Martin Johnes, Review, ''20 Century British History'' (2016) 27#3 p 492</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[History of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Archaeology of Wales]]\n* [[History of women in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Economic history of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[List of Anglo-Welsh Wars]]\n* [[The Red Dragon (magazine)|''The Red Dragon'']]\n* [[Cambrian Quarterly Magazine and Celtic Repertory|''The Cambrian Quarterly Magazine and Celtic Repertory'']]\n* [[British military history]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading and references==\n{{Refbegin}}\n<div style=\"{{column-width}}\">\n* Beddoe, Deirdre.
