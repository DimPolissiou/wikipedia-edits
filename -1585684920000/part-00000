At first, affected individuals may have difficulty sustaining attention and concentrating. Their judgment, insight, and memory become impaired as the condition progresses. Over time, they lose the ability to perform the activities of daily living, and most people with this condition eventually require comprehensive care.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of familial encephalopathy with [[neuroserpin]] inclusion bodies vary in their severity and age of onset. In severe cases, the condition causes seizures and episodes of sudden, involuntary muscle jerking or twitching (myoclonus) in addition to dementia. These signs can appear as early as a person's teens. Less severe cases are characterized by a progressive decline in intellectual functioning beginning in a person's forties or fifties.\n\nMutations in the ''SERPINI1'' [[gene]] cause familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies. The ''SERPINI1'' gene provides instructions for making a protein called neuroserpin. This protein is found in [[nerve cell]]s, where it plays a role in the development and function of the nervous system. Neuroserpin helps control the [[cell growth|growth]] of nerve cells and their connections with one another, which suggests that this protein may be important for learning and memory. Mutations in the gene result in the production of an abnormally shaped, unstable version of neuroserpin. Abnormal neuroserpin proteins can attach to one another and form clumps (called neuroserpin inclusion bodies or Collins bodies) within nerve cells. These clumps disrupt the cells' normal functioning and ultimately lead to cell death. Progressive dementia results from this gradual loss of nerve cells in certain parts of the brain. Researchers believe that a buildup of related, potentially toxic substances in nerve cells may also contribute to the signs and symptoms of this condition.\n\nThis condition is inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In many cases, an affected person has a parent with the condition.\n\n==See also==\n* [[PI12]]\n\n==References==\n*National Library of Medicine.

They currently play in the top division of the country.\n\n==History==\nFC Vakhsh was founded in 1960. In Soviet times was the farm club of the core team of the [[Tajik SSR]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Dushanbe]] based [[CSKA Pomir Dushanbe]]. From 1966 to 1984 the team played under the name of Pakhtakor. \"Vakhsh\" first became a champion of Tajikistan in 1961 and four years later the club won the Cup for the first time in Tajikistan.\n\nFootballers from [[Qurghonteppa]] for the first time took part in the USSR Championship in 1966, playing in the Central Asian zone of B League, when finished 16th out of 19 teams. Although from the following season the team improved their performance, in 1967 17th place (among 22 teams), in 1968 10th (out of 22), 1969&nbsp;\u2013 6th (out of 24) and in 1970 5th place (out of 18). Unfortunately, the further advancement of the team was stopped due to reorganization of the Soviet football structure in 1971.\n\nIn 1978 Pakhtakor became champion of the [[Tajik SSR]] and won a ticket to the soviet second league. From 1978 to 1984 Pakhtakor played in the second league. Again, the team was just beginning to acquire confidence as a solution of the Sports Committee of the [[Soviet Union]] removed from the rally. Since 1986, [[Qurghonteppa]] was re-introduced in the second league. To defend the honor of the city took \"Vakhsh&nbsp;\u2013 champion of the republic in 1985. This team also goes through the gradual conquest of positions. From 16th place in 1986, Vakhsh up to 4th place in 1989, after which the club has to play in the buffer zone, though not as a team, which finished in fourth place, but as the representative of [[Tajikistan]]. In those days, Vakhsh's best footballers always ended up in [[Tajikistan]]'s best team, [[CSKA Pomir Dushanbe]]. The most notable of these are [[Mukhsin Mukhamadiev]], [[Khakim Fuzailov]], [[Rustam Zabirov]], [[Sergei Mandreko]], [[Alimzhon Rafikov]], [[Alexander Asimov]] and [[Vladimir Dolganov]].\n\nSince 1992, Vakhsh plays in the [[Tajik League]]. In the same year \"Vakhsh\" took third place. The club has achieved great success in the 1997 season, having won [[Tajik Cup]], and qualified for the first time to participate in [[AFC Cup Winners Cup]]. Also in 1997, the year Vakhsh became the champion of Tajikistan. Striker [[Rustam Usmanov]] scoring 21 goals was named the best scorer of the national championship. In 2002, Vakhsh played in the [[Tajik Cup]] final and in 2003 won the [[Tajik Cup]]. In 2004, Vakhsh took second place and was awarded the silver medals of the championship in Tajikistan. In 2005, Vakhsh once again reached the final of [[Tajik Cup]], losing the deciding match [[Regar-TadAZ Tursunzoda]] in a penalty shootout. Although in the same year, Vakhsh became champions of [[Tajik League]], a 17-year-old striker by the name of [[Akhtam Khamrakulov]] was named best scorer of the championship with 12 goals.\n\nVakhsh reached her peak of success in the international arena in 2006, when the team reached the final of [[AFC President's Cup]] losing to eventual champions [[Dordoi-Dynamo Naryn]] 2\u20131 in the extra time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vakhshclub.wordpress.com/%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%8B/|title=\u0418\u0421\u0422\u041e\u0420\u0418\u042f \u041a\u041b\u0423\u0411\u0410|author=|date=11 April 2010|website=wordpress.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2018, Vakhsh was taken over by the local government of [[Qurghonteppa]] due to financial difficulties, and was renamed FC Khatlon.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=ru:\u0424\u0443\u0442\u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043b\u0443\u0431 \u00ab\u0412\u0430\u0445\u0448\u00bb \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f\u043b \u0438\u043c\u044f \u041f\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043d\u0435\u0435 |url=https://news.tj/ru/news/sports/20180206/futbolnii-klub-vahsh-stal-gosudarstvennim-i-pomenyal-imya |website=news.tj/ru/ |publisher=Asia-Plus |accessdate=10 December 2018 |language=Russian |date=6 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Domestic history===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Season\n! colspan=\"9\" | League\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Tajik Cup]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | Top goalscorer\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Manager\n|-\n!

They currently play in the top division of the country.\n\n==History==\nFC Vakhsh was founded in 1960. In Soviet times was the farm club of the core team of the [[Tajik SSR]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Dushanbe]] based [[CSKA Pomir Dushanbe]]. From 1966 to 1984 the team played under the name of Pakhtakor. \"Vakhsh\" first became a champion of Tajikistan in 1961 and four years later the club won the Cup for the first time in Tajikistan.\n\nFootballers from [[Qurghonteppa]] for the first time took part in the USSR Championship in 1966, playing in the Central Asian zone of B League, when finished 16th out of 19 teams. Although from the following season the team improved their performance, in 1967 17th place (among 22 teams), in 1968 10th (out of 22), 1969&nbsp;\u2013 6th (out of 24) and in 1970 5th place (out of 18). Unfortunately, the further advancement of the team was stopped due to reorganization of the Soviet football structure in 1971.\n\nIn 1978 Pakhtakor became champion of the [[Tajik SSR]] and won a ticket to the soviet second league. From 1978 to 1984 Pakhtakor played in the second league. Again, the team was just beginning to acquire confidence as a solution of the Sports Committee of the [[Soviet Union]] removed from the rally. Since 1986, [[Qurghonteppa]] was re-introduced in the second league. To defend the honor of the city took \"Vakhsh&nbsp;\u2013 champion of the republic in 1985. This team also goes through the gradual conquest of positions. From 16th place in 1986, Vakhsh up to 4th place in 1989, after which the club has to play in the buffer zone, though not as a team, which finished in fourth place, but as the representative of [[Tajikistan]]. In those days, Vakhsh's best footballers always ended up in [[Tajikistan]]'s best team, [[CSKA Pomir Dushanbe]]. The most notable of these are [[Mukhsin Mukhamadiev]], [[Khakim Fuzailov]], [[Rustam Zabirov]], [[Sergei Mandreko]], [[Alimzhon Rafikov]], [[Alexander Asimov]] and [[Vladimir Dolganov]].\n\nSince 1992, Vakhsh plays in the [[Tajik League]]. In the same year \"Vakhsh\" took third place. The club has achieved great success in the 1997 season, having won [[Tajik Cup]], and qualified for the first time to participate in [[AFC Cup Winners Cup]]. Also in 1997, the year Vakhsh became the champion of Tajikistan. Striker [[Rustam Usmanov]] scoring 21 goals was named the best scorer of the national championship. In 2002, Vakhsh played in the [[Tajik Cup]] final and in 2003 won the [[Tajik Cup]]. In 2004, Vakhsh took second place and was awarded the silver medals of the championship in Tajikistan. In 2005, Vakhsh once again reached the final of [[Tajik Cup]], losing the deciding match [[Regar-TadAZ Tursunzoda]] in a penalty shootout.

HSDD can be general (general lack of sexual desire) or situational (still has sexual desire, but lacks sexual desire for current partner), and it can be acquired (HSDD started after a period of normal sexual functioning) or lifelong (the person has always had no/low sexual desire.)\n\nIn the [[DSM-5]], HSDD was split into '''male hypoactive sexual desire disorder'''<ref name=\"DSM5male\">{{cite book | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition | chapter = Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder, 302.71 (F52.0) | editor = American Psychiatric Association | year = 2013 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | pages = 440\u2013443}}</ref> and '''[[female sexual interest/arousal disorder]]'''.<ref name=\"DSM5female\">{{cite book | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition | chapter = Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder, 302.72 (F52.22) | editor = American Psychiatric Association | year = 2013 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | pages = 433\u2013437}}</ref> It was first included in the DSM-III under the name inhibited sexual desire disorder,<ref>{{cite book |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |url=https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis00amer |url-access=registration |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |location=Washington DC |year=1980 |edition=3rd }}</ref> but the name was changed in the DSM-III-R. Other terms used to describe the phenomenon include sexual aversion and sexual apathy.<ref name=ummc /> More informal or colloquial terms are ''frigidity'' and ''frigidness''.<ref>Munjack, Dennis, and Pamela Kanno. \"An overview of outcome on frigidity: treatment effects and effectiveness.\" Comprehensive Psychiatry 17.3 (1976): 401-413.</ref>\n\n==Causes==\nLow sexual desire alone is not equivalent to HSDD because of the requirement in HSDD that the low sexual desire causes marked distress and interpersonal difficulty and because of the requirement that the low desire is not better accounted for by another disorder in the DSM or by a general medical problem. It is therefore difficult to say exactly what causes HSDD. It is easier to describe, instead, some of the causes of low sexual desire.\n\nIn men, though there are theoretically more types of HSDD/low sexual desire, typically men are only diagnosed with one of three subtypes.\n*Lifelong/generalised: The man has little or no desire for [[sexual stimulation]] (with a partner or alone) and never had.\n*Acquired/generalised: The man previously had sexual interest in his present partner, but lacks interest in sexual activity, partnered or solitary.\n*Acquired/situational: The man was previously sexually interested in his present partner but now lacks sexual interest in this partner but has desire for sexual stimulation (i.e. alone or with someone other than his present partner.)\n\nThough it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish between these types, they do not necessarily have the same cause. The cause of lifelong/generalized HSDD is unknown. In the case of acquired/generalized low sexual desire, possible causes include various medical/health problems, psychiatric problems, low levels of [[testosterone]] or high levels of [[prolactin]]. One theory suggests that sexual desire is controlled by a balance between inhibitory and excitatory factors.<ref>{{cite book |author=Janssen, E., Bancroft J. |chapter=The dual control model: The role of sexual inhibition & excitation in sexual arousal and behavior |editor=Janssen, E. |title=The Psychophysiology of Sex |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington IN |year=2006 }}</ref> This is thought to be expressed via neurotransmitters in selective brain areas.

As with men, various medical problems, psychiatric problems (such as mood disorders), or increased amounts of prolactin can cause HSDD. Other hormones are believed to be involved as well.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Additionally, factors such as relationship problems or stress are believed to be possible causes of reduced sexual desire in women. According to one recent study examining the affective responses and attentional capture of sexual stimuli in women with and without HSDD, women with HSDD do not appear to have a negative association to sexual stimuli, but rather a weaker positive association than women without HSDD.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Brauer M, van leeuwen M, Janssen E, Newhouse SK, Heiman JR, Laan E |title=Attentional and Affective Processing of Sexual Stimuli in Women with Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |date=September 2011 |doi=10.1007/s10508-011-9820-7|volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=891\u2013905 |pmid=21892693}}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nIn the [[DSM-5]], male hypoactive sexual desire disorder is characterized by \"persistently or recurrently deficient (or absent) sexual/erotic thoughts or fantasies and desire for sexual activity\", as judged by a clinician with consideration for the patient's age and cultural context.<ref name=\"DSM5male\" /> Female sexual interest/arousal disorder is defined as a \"lack of, or significantly reduced, sexual interest/arousal\", manifesting as at least three of the following symptoms: no or little interest in sexual activity, no or few sexual thoughts, no or few attempts to initiate sexual activity or respond to partner's initiation, no or little sexual pleasure/excitement in 75\u2013100% of sexual experiences, no or little sexual interest in internal or external erotic stimuli, and no or few genital/nongenital sensations in 75\u2013100% of sexual experiences.<ref name=\"DSM5female\" />\n\nFor both diagnoses, symptoms must persist for at least six months, cause clinically significant distress, and not be better explained by another condition. Simply having lower desire than one's partner is not sufficient for a diagnosis. Self-identification of a lifelong lack of sexual desire as asexuality precludes diagnosis.<ref name=\"DSM5male\" /><ref name=\"DSM5female\" />\n\n==Treatment==\n\n===Counseling===\nHSDD, like many sexual dysfunctions, is something that people are treated for in the context of a relationship. Theoretically, one could be diagnosed with, and treated for, HSDD without being in a relationship. However, relationship status is the most predictive factor accounting for distress in women with low desire and distress is required for a diagnosis of HSDD.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rosen RC, Shifren JL, Monz BU, Odom DM, Russo PA, Johannes CB |title=Correlates of sexually-related personal distress in women with low sexual desire |journal=Journal of Sexual Medicine |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=1549\u20131560 |date=June 2009 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2009.01252.x|pmid=19473457 }}</ref> Therefore, it is common for both partners to be involved in therapy. Typically, the therapist tries to find a psychological or biological cause of the HSDD. If the HSDD is organically caused, the clinician may try to treat it. If the clinician believes it is rooted in a psychological problem, they may recommend therapy. If not, treatment generally focuses more on relationship and communication issues, improved communication (verbal and nonverbal), working on non-sexual intimacy, or education about sexuality may all be possible parts of treatment. Sometimes problems occur because people have unrealistic perceptions about what normal sexuality is and are concerned that they do not compare well to that, and this is one reason why education can be important. If the clinician thinks that part of the problem is a result of stress, techniques may be recommended to more effectively deal with that. Also, it can be important to understand why the low level of sexual desire is a problem for the relationship because the two partners may associate different meanings with sex but not know it.<ref name=Basson07>{{cite book |author=Basson, Rosemary |chapter=Sexual Desire/Arousal Disorders in Women |editor=Leiblum, Sandra |title=Principles and Practice of Sex Therapy |publisher=The Guilford Press |location=New York |year=2007 |edition=4th }}</ref>\n\nIn the case of men, the therapy may depend on the subtype of HSDD. Increasing the level of sexual desire of a man with lifelong/generalized HSDD is unlikely. Instead the focus may be on helping the couple to adapt. In the case of acquired/generalized, it is likely that there is some biological reason for it and the clinician may attempt to deal with that. In the case of acquired/situational, some form of psychotherapy may be used, possibly with the man alone and possibly together with his partner.<ref name=Maurice07/>\n\n===Medication===\n\n====Approved====\n[[Flibanserin]] was the first medication approved by [[FDA]] for the treatment of HSDD in pre-menopausal women.

Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2011. {{ISBN|978-0-230-30345-4}}.</ref> Only in the early nineteenth century were women first described as \"frigid\", and a vast literature exists on what was considered a serious problem if a woman did not desire sex with her husband. Many medical texts between 1800-1930 focused on women's frigidity, considering it a sexual [[pathology]].<ref>Peter Cyle and Alison Moore, Frigidity at the Fin-de-Si\u00e8cle, a Slippery and Capacious Concept, ''Journal of the History of Sexuality'' 19 (2) May 2010, 243-261.</ref>\n\nThe French psychoanalyst, [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]], theorized about frigidity and considered herself to suffer from it.<ref>Relocating Marie Bonaparte\u2019s Clitoris.

Prior to [[Masters and Johnson]]'s research, [[female orgasm]] was assumed by some to originate primarily from vaginal, rather than clitoral, stimulation. Consequently, feminists have argued that \"frigidity\" was \"defined by men as the failure of women to have vaginal orgasms\".<ref>{{cite book |author=Koedt, A. |chapter=The myth of the vaginal orgasm |editor=Escoffier, J. |title=Sexual revolution |publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press |location=New York |year=1970 |isbn=978-1-56025-525-3 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781560255253/page/100 100\u20139] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781560255253/page/100 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing this book, [[sex therapy]] increased throughout the 1970s. Reports from sex-therapists about people with low sexual desire are reported from at least 1972, but labeling this as a specific disorder did not occur until 1977.<ref>{{cite book |last=Irvine |first=Janice  |title=Disorders of Desire |publisher=Temple University Press |location=Philadelphia |year=2005 |page=265 |ref=harv }}</ref> In that year, sex therapists [[Helen Singer Kaplan]] and Harold Lief independently of each other proposed creating a specific category for people with low or no sexual desire. Lief named it \"inhibited sexual desire\", and Kaplan named it \"hypoactive sexual desire\". The primary motivation for this was that previous models for sex therapy assumed certain levels of sexual interest in one's partner and that problems were only caused by abnormal functioning/non-functioning of the genitals or performance anxiety but that therapies based on those problems were ineffective for people who did not sexually desire their partner.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kaplan |first=Helen Singer |title=The Sexual Desire Disorders |publisher=Taylor & Francis Group |location=New York |year=1995 |pages=1\u20132, 7 |ref=harv }}</ref> The following year, 1978, Lief and Kaplan together made a proposal to the APA's taskforce for sexual disorders for the DSM III, of which Kaplan and Lief were both members. The diagnosis of Inhibited Sexual Desire (ISD) was added to the DSM when the 3rd edition was published in 1980.<ref>{{harvnb|Kaplan|1995|pp=7\u20138}}</ref>\n\nFor understanding this diagnosis, it is important to recognize the social context in which it was created. In some cultures, low sexual desire may be considered normal and high sexual desire is problematic. For example, sexual desire may be lower in East Asian populations than Euro-Canadian/American populations.<ref name=\"Brotto LA, Chik HM, Ryder AG, Gorzalka BB, Seal B 2005 613\u2013626\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Brotto LA, Chik HM, Ryder AG, Gorzalka BB, Seal B |title=Acculturation and sexual function in Asian women |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=613\u2013626 |date=December 2005 |doi=10.1007/s10508-005-7909-6  |pmid=16362246 }}</ref> In other cultures, this may be reversed. Some cultures try hard to restrain sexual desire. Others try to excite it. Concepts of \"normal\" levels of sexual desire are culturally dependent and rarely value-neutral. In the 1970s, there were strong cultural messages that sex is good for you and \"the more the better\". Within this context, people who were habitually uninterested in sex, who in previous times may not have seen this as a problem, were more likely to feel that this was a situation that needed to be fixed. They may have felt alienated by dominant messages about sexuality and increasingly people went to sex-therapists complaining of low sexual desire. It was within this context that the diagnosis of ISD was created.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Leiblum, Sandra |author2=Rosen, Raymond |title=Sexual Desire Disorders |publisher=The Guilford Press |year=1988 |page=1 }}</ref>\n\nIn the revision of the DSM-III, published in 1987 (DSM-III-R), ISD was subdivided into two categories: Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder and Sexual Aversion Disorder (SAD).<ref>{{harvnb|Irvine|2005|p=172}}</ref> The former is a lack of interest in sex and the latter is a phobic aversion to sex. In addition to this subdivision, one reason for the change is that the committee involved in revising the psychosexual disorders for the DSM-III-R thought that term \"inhibited\" suggests psychodynamic cause (i.e. that the conditions for sexual desire are present, but the person is, for some reason, inhibiting their own sexual interest.) The term \"hypoactive sexual desire\" is more awkward, but more neutral with respect to the cause.<ref>{{cite book |author=Apfelbaum, Bernard |chapter=An Ego Analytic Perspective on Desire Disorders |editor1=Lieblum, Sandra |editor2=Rosen, Raymond |title=Sexual Desire Disorders |publisher=The Guilford Press |year=1988 }}</ref> The DSM-III-R estimated that about 20% of the population had HSDD.<ref>American Psychological Association (1987)</ref> In the DSM-IV (1994), the criterion that the diagnosis requires \"marked distress or interpersonal difficulty\" was added.\n\nThe DSM-5, published in 2013, split HSDD into ''male hypoactive sexual desire disorder'' and ''female sexual interest/arousal disorder''. The distinction was made because men report more intense and frequent sexual desire than women.<ref name=\"DSM5male\" /> According to [[Lori Brotto]], this classification is desirable compared to the DSM-IV classification system because: (1) it reflects the finding that desire and arousal tend to overlap (2) it differentiates between women who lack desire before the onset of activity, but who are receptive to initiation and or initiate sexual activity for reasons other than desire, and women who never experience sexual arousal (3) it takes the variability in sexual desire into account.

It is therefore difficult to say exactly what causes HSDD. It is easier to describe, instead, some of the causes of low sexual desire.\n\nIn men, though there are theoretically more types of HSDD/low sexual desire, typically men are only diagnosed with one of three subtypes.\n*Lifelong/generalised: The man has little or no desire for [[sexual stimulation]] (with a partner or alone) and never had.\n*Acquired/generalised: The man previously had sexual interest in his present partner, but lacks interest in sexual activity, partnered or solitary.\n*Acquired/situational: The man was previously sexually interested in his present partner but now lacks sexual interest in this partner but has desire for sexual stimulation (i.e. alone or with someone other than his present partner.)\n\nThough it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish between these types, they do not necessarily have the same cause. The cause of lifelong/generalized HSDD is unknown. In the case of acquired/generalized low sexual desire, possible causes include various medical/health problems, psychiatric problems, low levels of [[testosterone]] or high levels of [[prolactin]]. One theory suggests that sexual desire is controlled by a balance between inhibitory and excitatory factors.<ref>{{cite book |author=Janssen, E., Bancroft J. |chapter=The dual control model: The role of sexual inhibition & excitation in sexual arousal and behavior |editor=Janssen, E. |title=The Psychophysiology of Sex |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington IN |year=2006 }}</ref> This is thought to be expressed via neurotransmitters in selective brain areas. A decrease in sexual desire may therefore be due to an imbalance between neurotransmitters with excitatory activity like dopamine and norepinephrine and neurotransmitters with inhibitory activity, like serotonin.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Clayton AH |title=The pathophysiology of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women |journal=Int J Gynaecol Obstet |volume=110 |issue=1 |pages=7\u201311 |date=July 2010 |pmid=20434725 |doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2010.02.014 }}</ref> Low sexual desire can also be a side effect of various medications. In the case of acquired/situational HSDD, possible causes include [[Fear of intimacy|intimacy difficulty]], [[Relational disorder|relationship problems]], [[sexual addiction]], and chronic illness of the man's partner. The evidence for these is somewhat in question. Some claimed causes of low sexual desire are based on empirical evidence. However, some are based merely on clinical observation.<ref name=Maurice07>{{cite book |author=Maurice, William |chapter=Sexual Desire Disorders in Men |editor=Leiblum, Sandra |title=Principles and Practice of Sex Therapy |publisher=The Guilford Press |location=New York |year=2007 |edition=4th }}</ref> In many cases, the cause of HSDD is simply unknown.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Balon, Richard |title=Toward an Improved Nosology of Sexual Dysfunction in DSM-V |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=24 |issue=9 |year=2007 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/53716?pageNumber=1}}</ref>\n\nThere are some factors that are believed to be possible causes of HSDD in women. As with men, various medical problems, psychiatric problems (such as mood disorders), or increased amounts of prolactin can cause HSDD. Other hormones are believed to be involved as well.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Additionally, factors such as relationship problems or stress are believed to be possible causes of reduced sexual desire in women. According to one recent study examining the affective responses and attentional capture of sexual stimuli in women with and without HSDD, women with HSDD do not appear to have a negative association to sexual stimuli, but rather a weaker positive association than women without HSDD.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Brauer M, van leeuwen M, Janssen E, Newhouse SK, Heiman JR, Laan E |title=Attentional and Affective Processing of Sexual Stimuli in Women with Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |date=September 2011 |doi=10.1007/s10508-011-9820-7|volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=891\u2013905 |pmid=21892693}}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nIn the [[DSM-5]], male hypoactive sexual desire disorder is characterized by \"persistently or recurrently deficient (or absent) sexual/erotic thoughts or fantasies and desire for sexual activity\", as judged by a clinician with consideration for the patient's age and cultural context.<ref name=\"DSM5male\" /> Female sexual interest/arousal disorder is defined as a \"lack of, or significantly reduced, sexual interest/arousal\", manifesting as at least three of the following symptoms: no or little interest in sexual activity, no or few sexual thoughts, no or few attempts to initiate sexual activity or respond to partner's initiation, no or little sexual pleasure/excitement in 75\u2013100% of sexual experiences, no or little sexual interest in internal or external erotic stimuli, and no or few genital/nongenital sensations in 75\u2013100% of sexual experiences.<ref name=\"DSM5female\" />\n\nFor both diagnoses, symptoms must persist for at least six months, cause clinically significant distress, and not be better explained by another condition. Simply having lower desire than one's partner is not sufficient for a diagnosis. Self-identification of a lifelong lack of sexual desire as asexuality precludes diagnosis.<ref name=\"DSM5male\" /><ref name=\"DSM5female\" />\n\n==Treatment==\n\n===Counseling===\nHSDD, like many sexual dysfunctions, is something that people are treated for in the context of a relationship. Theoretically, one could be diagnosed with, and treated for, HSDD without being in a relationship. However, relationship status is the most predictive factor accounting for distress in women with low desire and distress is required for a diagnosis of HSDD.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rosen RC, Shifren JL, Monz BU, Odom DM, Russo PA, Johannes CB |title=Correlates of sexually-related personal distress in women with low sexual desire |journal=Journal of Sexual Medicine |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=1549\u20131560 |date=June 2009 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2009.01252.x|pmid=19473457 }}</ref> Therefore, it is common for both partners to be involved in therapy. Typically, the therapist tries to find a psychological or biological cause of the HSDD. If the HSDD is organically caused, the clinician may try to treat it. If the clinician believes it is rooted in a psychological problem, they may recommend therapy. If not, treatment generally focuses more on relationship and communication issues, improved communication (verbal and nonverbal), working on non-sexual intimacy, or education about sexuality may all be possible parts of treatment. Sometimes problems occur because people have unrealistic perceptions about what normal sexuality is and are concerned that they do not compare well to that, and this is one reason why education can be important. If the clinician thinks that part of the problem is a result of stress, techniques may be recommended to more effectively deal with that. Also, it can be important to understand why the low level of sexual desire is a problem for the relationship because the two partners may associate different meanings with sex but not know it.<ref name=Basson07>{{cite book |author=Basson, Rosemary |chapter=Sexual Desire/Arousal Disorders in Women |editor=Leiblum, Sandra |title=Principles and Practice of Sex Therapy |publisher=The Guilford Press |location=New York |year=2007 |edition=4th }}</ref>\n\nIn the case of men, the therapy may depend on the subtype of HSDD. Increasing the level of sexual desire of a man with lifelong/generalized HSDD is unlikely. Instead the focus may be on helping the couple to adapt. In the case of acquired/generalized, it is likely that there is some biological reason for it and the clinician may attempt to deal with that. In the case of acquired/situational, some form of psychotherapy may be used, possibly with the man alone and possibly together with his partner.<ref name=Maurice07/>\n\n===Medication===\n\n====Approved====\n[[Flibanserin]] was the first medication approved by [[FDA]] for the treatment of HSDD in pre-menopausal women.

Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2011. {{ISBN|978-0-230-30345-4}}.</ref> Only in the early nineteenth century were women first described as \"frigid\", and a vast literature exists on what was considered a serious problem if a woman did not desire sex with her husband. Many medical texts between 1800-1930 focused on women's frigidity, considering it a sexual [[pathology]].<ref>Peter Cyle and Alison Moore, Frigidity at the Fin-de-Si\u00e8cle, a Slippery and Capacious Concept, ''Journal of the History of Sexuality'' 19 (2) May 2010, 243-261.</ref>\n\nThe French psychoanalyst, [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]], theorized about frigidity and considered herself to suffer from it.<ref>Relocating Marie Bonaparte\u2019s Clitoris.

Prior to [[Masters and Johnson]]'s research, [[female orgasm]] was assumed by some to originate primarily from vaginal, rather than clitoral, stimulation. Consequently, feminists have argued that \"frigidity\" was \"defined by men as the failure of women to have vaginal orgasms\".<ref>{{cite book |author=Koedt, A. |chapter=The myth of the vaginal orgasm |editor=Escoffier, J. |title=Sexual revolution |publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press |location=New York |year=1970 |isbn=978-1-56025-525-3 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781560255253/page/100 100\u20139] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781560255253/page/100 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing this book, [[sex therapy]] increased throughout the 1970s. Reports from sex-therapists about people with low sexual desire are reported from at least 1972, but labeling this as a specific disorder did not occur until 1977.<ref>{{cite book |last=Irvine |first=Janice  |title=Disorders of Desire |publisher=Temple University Press |location=Philadelphia |year=2005 |page=265 |ref=harv }}</ref> In that year, sex therapists [[Helen Singer Kaplan]] and Harold Lief independently of each other proposed creating a specific category for people with low or no sexual desire. Lief named it \"inhibited sexual desire\", and Kaplan named it \"hypoactive sexual desire\". The primary motivation for this was that previous models for sex therapy assumed certain levels of sexual interest in one's partner and that problems were only caused by abnormal functioning/non-functioning of the genitals or performance anxiety but that therapies based on those problems were ineffective for people who did not sexually desire their partner.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kaplan |first=Helen Singer |title=The Sexual Desire Disorders |publisher=Taylor & Francis Group |location=New York |year=1995 |pages=1\u20132, 7 |ref=harv }}</ref> The following year, 1978, Lief and Kaplan together made a proposal to the APA's taskforce for sexual disorders for the DSM III, of which Kaplan and Lief were both members. The diagnosis of Inhibited Sexual Desire (ISD) was added to the DSM when the 3rd edition was published in 1980.<ref>{{harvnb|Kaplan|1995|pp=7\u20138}}</ref>\n\nFor understanding this diagnosis, it is important to recognize the social context in which it was created. In some cultures, low sexual desire may be considered normal and high sexual desire is problematic. For example, sexual desire may be lower in East Asian populations than Euro-Canadian/American populations.<ref name=\"Brotto LA, Chik HM, Ryder AG, Gorzalka BB, Seal B 2005 613\u2013626\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Brotto LA, Chik HM, Ryder AG, Gorzalka BB, Seal B |title=Acculturation and sexual function in Asian women |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=613\u2013626 |date=December 2005 |doi=10.1007/s10508-005-7909-6  |pmid=16362246 }}</ref> In other cultures, this may be reversed. Some cultures try hard to restrain sexual desire. Others try to excite it. Concepts of \"normal\" levels of sexual desire are culturally dependent and rarely value-neutral. In the 1970s, there were strong cultural messages that sex is good for you and \"the more the better\". Within this context, people who were habitually uninterested in sex, who in previous times may not have seen this as a problem, were more likely to feel that this was a situation that needed to be fixed. They may have felt alienated by dominant messages about sexuality and increasingly people went to sex-therapists complaining of low sexual desire. It was within this context that the diagnosis of ISD was created.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Leiblum, Sandra |author2=Rosen, Raymond |title=Sexual Desire Disorders |publisher=The Guilford Press |year=1988 |page=1 }}</ref>\n\nIn the revision of the DSM-III, published in 1987 (DSM-III-R), ISD was subdivided into two categories: Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder and Sexual Aversion Disorder (SAD).<ref>{{harvnb|Irvine|2005|p=172}}</ref> The former is a lack of interest in sex and the latter is a phobic aversion to sex. In addition to this subdivision, one reason for the change is that the committee involved in revising the psychosexual disorders for the DSM-III-R thought that term \"inhibited\" suggests psychodynamic cause (i.e. that the conditions for sexual desire are present, but the person is, for some reason, inhibiting their own sexual interest.)

The distinction was made because men report more intense and frequent sexual desire than women.<ref name=\"DSM5male\" /> According to [[Lori Brotto]], this classification is desirable compared to the DSM-IV classification system because: (1) it reflects the finding that desire and arousal tend to overlap (2) it differentiates between women who lack desire before the onset of activity, but who are receptive to initiation and or initiate sexual activity for reasons other than desire, and women who never experience sexual arousal (3) it takes the variability in sexual desire into account.

The game is a [[Clone (computing)|clone]] of the ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' franchise, and as such, features nearly identical gameplay. The main draw of the game is its ability to play community-made songs, which has resulted in a large [[Fandom|fan community]] around the game.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Clone Hero'', by design, features nearly identical gameplay to ''Guitar Hero''. Specifically, the game is most similar to later entries in the series such as ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour|World Tour]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock|Warriors of Rock]]''. Gameplay involves pressing colored buttons on a [[guitar]]-shaped controller to play along to songs, although in ''Clone Hero'' these inputs can be mapped to a keyboard or any other input device. Players must hold specific buttons that line up with colored notes that appear on the screen on a \"highway\"; when the notes hit the bottom of the highway, the player must strum to hit the notes in time with the music. There is also an \"open strum\" note, represented with a purple bar, which requires the player to strum without pressing any other buttons. In addition to normal notes, there are \"HOPO\"s (\"[[Hammer-on|Hammer-ons]]\" and \"[[Pull-off|Pull-offs]]\") and \"tap notes\", which both do not require the player to strum them to hit them, with the difference between the two being that a string of HOPOs must begin with a strum, and the player must re-strum if they miss a note.

The game is a [[Clone (computing)|clone]] of the ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' franchise, and as such, features nearly identical gameplay. The main draw of the game is its ability to play community-made songs, which has resulted in a large [[Fandom|fan community]] around the game.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Clone Hero'', by design, features nearly identical gameplay to ''Guitar Hero''. Specifically, the game is most similar to later entries in the series such as ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour|World Tour]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock|Warriors of Rock]]''. Gameplay involves pressing colored buttons on a [[guitar]]-shaped controller to play along to songs, although in ''Clone Hero'' these inputs can be mapped to a keyboard or any other input device. Players must hold specific buttons that line up with colored notes that appear on the screen on a \"highway\"; when the notes hit the bottom of the highway, the player must strum to hit the notes in time with the music. There is also an \"open strum\" note, represented with a purple bar, which requires the player to strum without pressing any other buttons. In addition to normal notes, there are \"HOPO\"s (\"[[Hammer-on|Hammer-ons]]\" and \"[[Pull-off|Pull-offs]]\") and \"tap notes\", which both do not require the player to strum them to hit them, with the difference between the two being that a string of HOPOs must begin with a strum, and the player must re-strum if they miss a note.\n\n=== Fan community ===\nThe game has the ability to play community-made songs, called \"charts\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-05-01-meet-the-community-reviving-classic-guitar-hero-gameplay-in-their-own-clone|title=The spirit of Guitar Hero lives on in a bizarre community-made clone|last=Stubbs|first=Mike|date=2018-05-01|website=Eurogamer|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.avclub.com/guitar-heroes-never-die-they-just-start-playing-clone-1828254899|title=Guitar Heroes never die, they just start playing Clone Hero|last=Neilan|first=Dan|date=August 10, 2018|website=AV Club|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> However, unlike games in the ''Guitar Hero'' series, these songs do not need to be original compositions, and can instead be any audio file a member of the community wishes to turn into a playable chart.
