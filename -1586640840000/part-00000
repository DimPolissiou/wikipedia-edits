The club competes in the [[National Rugby League]] (NRL) premiership, Australia's elite rugby league competition. It is the newest of the sixteen clubs in the league, having commenced its [[2007 Gold Coast Titans season|inaugural season]] on 18 March 2007. Since 2008, the Titans have played their home games at [[Robina Stadium|Cbus Super Stadium]] in [[Robina, Queensland]].\n\nThe Titans are the second top-level rugby league club to have been based on the Gold Coast, the first being the ill-fated [[Gold Coast Chargers|Gold Coast-Tweed Giants / Gold Coast Seagulls / Gold Coast Chargers]], which existed from 1988 to 1998.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Gold Coast Titans History}}\n{{See also|Gold Coast Chargers}}\n\n===Formation===\nThe beginnings of a Gold Coast team's bid to return to the [[National Rugby League]] began when the [[Australian Rugby League]] decided to remove the financially successful [[Gold Coast Chargers]] from the [[National Rugby League]] at the end of the [[National Rugby League season 1998|1998 Season]]. The ARL wanted to have a second major team based in Brisbane and believed the best way to achieve this was by removing the Gold Coast team from the competition. The attempt to launch a second Brisbane team failed and in 1999, [[Michael Searle]], former Gold Coast Chargers player and Managing Director of International Sports Australia, formed a Gold Coast Bid Team. The team included former Chargers boss [[Paul Broughton]] and was labelled as \"The Gold Coast Consortium\" by the media. The board was constantly active in lobbying the NRL to both expand the competition and consider the Gold Coast's bid for inclusion. It was successful in organising pre-season NRL trial matches to be hosted on the Gold Coast and with average attendances of over 16,000, and peak attendances topping 20,000, the popularity of rugby league on the Coast was clear.\n\n{{Quotation|I firmly believe rugby league should be looking to expand. The Gold Coast area is growing at a phenomenal rate. There are 89 rugby league teams in Gold Coast primary schools and 59 teams in Gold Coast high schools representing about 2,300 young players. That's just schoolboys.\n\nIf the catchment area includes the region from South Brisbane to Byron Bay in northern NSW, then it covers a rugby league heartland starving for recognition.  These areas would only blossom even more if the young players had a senior team in the NRL competition to which they could aspire.\n\nSouth-east Queensland needs another NRL team desperately and for a whole host of reasons.|[[Phil Gould (rugby league)|Phil Gould]], 21 December 2003<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = Gould\n  | first = Phil\n  | authorlink = Phil Gould (rugby league)\n  | title = NRL expansion talk excites Gold Coast\n  | work = [[The Sun-Herald]]\n  | publisher = The Sydney Morning Herald\n  | date = 21 December 2003\n  | url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/12/20/1071868703349.html?from=storyrhs\n  | accessdate = 6 October 2009}}\n</ref>}}\n\nIn August 2004, the NRL rejected Michael Searle's bid for re-adding a Gold Coast team.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = English\n  | first = Ben\n  | title = A man's mission to unite NRL \n  | work = [[Herald Sun]]\n  | publisher = Herald and Weekly Times\n  | date = 10 October 2009\n  | url = http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/a-mans-mission-to-unite-nrl/story-e6frfgbo-1225785198845\n  | archive-date = 2009-10-14\n  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091014233649/http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/a-mans-mission-to-unite-nrl/story-e6frfgbo-1225785198845\n  | accessdate = 11 October 2009}}</ref> However, later, during an episode of [[Nine Network]]'s [[The NRL Footy Show]], the \"Gold Coast Consortium\" announced their team name and jersey to the public from the [[Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre]]. Initially the team was to be named the Gold Coast Dolphins, with the team colours to be white, jade and orange. While the Dolphins moniker was popular among many, the heavyweight Brisbane [[Queensland Cup]] side the [[Redcliffe Dolphins]] saw it as a threat for any prospect of entering the NRL they had, and as a result threatened severe legal action if the Gold Coast used the Dolphins name. Midway through that year the National Rugby League announced that after viewing submissions from the Gold Coast Dolphins, the [[Bring back the bears|Central Coast Bears]] and the [[Wellington Orcas]], there would not be a 16th team included in the [[NRL season 2006|2006 NRL competition]]. Reasons given to the Gold Coast was the National Rugby Leagues concern over the quality and capacity of their homeground, [[Carrara Stadium]], which is an oval and only seats 16,000 (although it has been known to fit in 23,000 after minor redevelopment).\n\nAlthough their bid was knocked back, the consortium continued to push heavily in 2005 for a Gold Coast NRL team, changing the entry year to 2007. The Gold Coast received a massive boost when the Queensland Government announced they would spend A$100 million on a new, 25,000-seat rectangular stadium in [[Robina, Queensland|Robina]] for the Gold Coast should they be accepted into the 2007 competition. The stadium would not be completed until early 2008 yet the promise of a new first-class facility was enough for the NRL to accept the Gold Coasts bid and on 27 May 2005, NRL CEO [[David Gallop]] announced that the Gold Coast franchise would be the 16th team in the [[2007 NRL season]].\n\nIn the time since the Gold Coast was admitted, the Titans completed a vigorous recruitment drive, they announced the signing of [[Sydney Roosters]] assistant coach [[John Cartwright (rugby league)|John Cartwright]] as the Titans first head-coach and successfully signed contracts with established players such as [[Dally M Medal]] winner [[Preston Campbell]], [[Queensland state rugby league team|Queensland]] & [[Australia national rugby league team|Australian]] representative [[Scott Prince]], [[New South Wales state rugby league team|New South Wales]] & [[Australia national rugby league team|Australian]] representative [[Luke Bailey (rugby league)|Luke Bailey]] and enticing former league player [[Mat Rogers]] back from rugby union.\n\n===2007\u20132008: Laying the foundations===\n{{main|2007 Gold Coast Titans season}}\n\nIn February 2007, the Titans played their historic first game in a trial against the previous season's Minor-Premiers and Grand Finalists [[Melbourne Storm]], previously the newest club in the League (apart from the merged teams). They were beaten in the club's first hit-out but over the following weeks, Cartwright fielded his full strength team in two other pre-season trials, winning 22\u201310 over the [[Parramatta Eels]] for the club's first victory. The following week in the team first played in front of their home fans on the Gold Coast, they ran out 28\u20136 winners over the [[Penrith Panthers]]. Although merely trial matches, the signs were positive for the Titans' debut season to come.\n\nThe Titans played their first official match in Round 1 of the [[National Rugby League season 2007|2007 NRL season]] against the [[St George Illawarra Dragons]]. Their first game was moved from their home ground, [[Carrara Stadium]], to [[Suncorp Stadium]] in Brisbane due to the huge demand of fans eager to see the new Gold Coast outfit in action, and on 18 March 2007, in front of over 42,000 people they made their debut. Gold Coast performed admirably but after falling 14 points behind in the second half 20\u20136 they couldn't manage a full comeback losing a tight match 20\u201318. Former Queensland State of Origin winger [[Chris Walker (rugby league)|Chris Walker]], who had been released by [[Melbourne Storm]] due to off-field troubles in 2006, started his rugby league comeback scoring two tries and two conversions for a 14-point haul for the Titans.\n\nThe close loss to the Dragons wouldn't last long in the memories of Titans fans as a week later the Gold Coast franchise recorded their first official victory in another tight match, winning 18\u201316 against the [[Cronulla Sharks]] at home. The start of the season saw the Titans only manage four wins in the first ten rounds but a mid-season five-week-long winning streak of four wins and a bye saw the Titans sitting in the top four at the conclusion of Round 15. The streak was ended in a poor 22\u20136 loss against the [[New Zealand Warriors]] at home, then they slumped to a 5-match losing streak which included a [[golden point]] loss to the [[Brisbane Broncos]] in Round 17 and a 56\u201310 loss at the hands of the [[Canberra Raiders]] in Round 18. The Titans wouldn't register another win until Round 21, but by then they had already slipped to 11th position and needed to obtain maximum points from the final four rounds to confirm a spot in the finals in their maiden season. The side only managed one win from the final four matches, however, missing out on the finals. In the final round, a 50\u20136 thrashing at the hands of [Melbourne Storm] ended the Titans' debut season on somewhat of a sour note, with the young Gold Coast franchise finishing the season in 12th position with 10 wins, 14 losses and a bye for 22 competition points.\n\nDespite having an outdated home ground ([[Carrara Stadium]]) as they waited for their new stadium ([[Skilled Park]]) to be completed, the Titans had the second-highest average attendance of all NRL clubs for 2007.<ref>{{cite news\n |last=Gallop \n |first=David \n |authorlink=David Gallop \n |title=Australian Rugby Football League Annual Report 2007 \n |page=5 \n |publisher=Australian Rugby League Limited \n |year=2007 \n |url=http://www.australianrugbyleague.com.au/files/ARL_2007_Annrep_1.pdf \n |format=PDF \n |accessdate=15 July 2009 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913145959/http://www.australianrugbyleague.com.au/files/ARL_2007_Annrep_1.pdf \n |archivedate=13 September 2009 \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of 2007 [[Luke Bailey (rugby league)|Luke Bailey]] and [[Anthony Laffranchi]] were named co-winners of the club's inaugural [[Paul Broughton]] Medal for best and fairest player of the season.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = abc.net.au\n  | title = Bailey, Laffranchi share Titans' top honour\n  | work = ABC News\n  | place =Australia\n  | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]\n  | date = 4 October 2007\n  | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/10/04/2050448.htm?site=news\n  | accessdate = 4 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn their debut season, the Gold Coast club had turned over $16 million.<ref>{{Cite news \n  | last = Badel\n  | first = Peter\n  | title = Michael Searle proud of Gold Coast Titans \n  | work = [[The Sunday Mail (Brisbane)|The Sunday Mail]]\n  | place = Australia\n  | publisher = Queensland Newspapers\n  | date = 13 September 2009\n  | url = http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/nrl/michael-searle-proud-of-gold-coast-titans/story-e6frep5x-1225772136346\n  | accessdate = 6 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n{{main|2008 Gold Coast Titans season}}\n\nThe [[2008 NRL season]] was the Titans' second in the National Rugby League. A major boost for the Titans was the signing of past [[Queensland state rugby league team|Queensland]] representative [[Ashley Harrison]] from the [[Sydney Roosters]].\n\nThe Titans played their first official match at their new Stadium, [[Skilled Park]], against the [[North Queensland Cowboys]] with the final score being 36\u201318. Rookie [[Jordan Atkins]] became only the second person in the history of Australian rugby league to score four tries on debut, alongside Canterbury's [[Tony Nash (rugby league)|Tony Nash]] in 1942. The sellout 26,974-strong crowd assisted the Titans in firmly establishing that they were a force to be reckoned with in 2008.\n\nThe club went on to hit top place on the NRL ladder for the first time after round 6. They managed to maintain top spot on the ladder all the way until round 11, when a loss to Wests Tigers saw them forfeit top spot to the Sydney Roosters, who led in points differential. At the conclusion of Round 14, the Titans were equal first on points, fourth on points differential, employing a perfect home record for inspiration. Despite facing a tough home stretch, the Titans placed admirably in their pursuit of an inaugural finals campaign.\n\nOne of the Titans' strongest points in 2008 was the form of halfback Scott Prince, who earned selection for State of Origin. However early in Game 3, his arm was broken, putting him on the sideline for the season. Subsequently, the Titans lost four straight games.\n\nThey finished their season at 13th on the NRL ladder.\n\nThis year their turnover increased to $22 million and the club posted a $1.5m profit.\n\n===2009\u20132010: First finals appearance===\n{{main|2009 Gold Coast Titans season}}\n\nThe Titans secured four new signings for the 2009 season in [[Sam Tagataese]], [[Matthew White (rugby league)|Matthew White]], [[Jackson Nicolau]] and Raiders speedster [[William Zillman]].\n\nSimilar to the Titans previous seasons, they find themselves on top of the competition ladder after six rounds sitting on ten premiership points alongside their rivals the [[Brisbane Broncos]]. Early victories against the [[Canterbury Bulldogs]] and the [[Melbourne Storm]] away from home without skipper [[Scott Prince]], silenced many of their critics who believed they could not win away from the holiday strip or without their veteran halfback.\n\nMany of the Titans NYC side made their debut and turned into regular first-graders, such as [[Esi Tonga]], [[David Mead (rugby league)|David Mead]] and [[Kevin Gordon]]. [[Kayne Lawton]], [[Bodene Thompson]] and [[Selasi Berdie]] also made their NRL debut.\n\nThe club's most successful season so far saw them finish in 3rd position, which was in 2009. They were 2 points behind the competition front-runners [[St. George Illawarra Dragons]] and the [[Canterbury Bulldogs]]. In the 2009 finals series, they lost their qualifying final 40\u201332 against the [[Brisbane Broncos]], then lost the semi-final 27\u20132 against the [[Parramatta Eels]].\n\n{{main|2010 Gold Coast Titans season}}\n\nThe Titans signed five new players for the 2010 season in [[Joe Tomane]], [[Marshall Chalk]], [[Riley Brown]], [[Clinton Toopi]], [[Greg Bird (rugby league)|Greg Bird]] and [[Steve Michaels]]\n\nThe Titans lost a number of players for the 2010 season, including [[Ben Jeffery]], [[Brenton Bowen]], [[Chris Walker (rugby league)|Chris Walker]], [[Daniel Conn]], [[Brett Delaney]] and [[Siosaia Vave]].\n\nFor the second year in succession the Titans qualified for the finals, finishing 4th and thereby earning a home qualifying final against the fifth-placed [[New Zealand Warriors]]. The Titans' 28\u201316 win, coupled with losses for two other top four teams, meant that the Titans earned the week off and a right to host a preliminary final at the larger [[Lang Park|Suncorp Stadium]], which turned out to be its 100th ever premiership match. The Titans lost to the resurgent [[Sydney Roosters]], 32\u20136, ending their season one week short of the Grand Final. After 2010 the Titans finished up 4th overall in the [[2010 NRL season]], with [[Mat Rogers]] retiring at the conclusion of the season.\n\n===2011\u20132012: The wooden spoon and player turnover===\n{{main|2011 Gold Coast Titans season}}\n\nDuring the off-season the Titans lost inspirational five-eighth [[Mat Rogers]] to retirement.\n\nTo date the Titans have recorded their worst ever start to a season, losing four of their first five matches against [[St. George Illawarra Dragons|St. George Illawarra]], [[Melbourne Storm|Melbourne]], the [[Brisbane Broncos]] and [[North Queensland Cowboys|North Queensland]] by scorelines of 16&ndash;25, 16&ndash;38, 10&ndash;12 and 16&ndash;20 respectively. They never recovered from their horror start to the year only winning 6 games all year which is their worst season to date finishing on 16 points and receiving the wooden spoon.\n\n{{main|2012 Gold Coast Titans season}}\n\nThe Titans signed seven new players for the 2012 season including former [[Australian rugby league team|Australian]] and [[New South Wales state rugby league team|NSW]] representative [[Jamal Idris]] and current [[Queensland state rugby league team|QLD]] representative [[Nate Myles]] former Cronulla Sharks prop [[Luke Douglas]] They also lost key foundation players such as [[Preston Campbell]], [[Anthony Laffranchi]], [[Nathan Friend]] and [[Mat Rogers]].\n\nThe club started their 2012 with an impressive 18\u20130 win over the [[North Queensland Cowboys]] away from home. However, the success was very short lived, losing the next 5 in a row, 4 of which were at home. Round 7 saw [[Aidan Sezer]] make his NRL Debut Against the [[Manly Sea Eagles]] at [[Brookvale Oval]]. The Titans produced a 26-14 upset, with Sezer scoring in his debut. Debutant for the Titans Jamal Idris coughing up 2 tries in the round 7 match up. The next two games were losses.\n\nFrom rounds 10\u201321, the Titans managed a mid season revival. In the period, the club only lost three times, with seven wins and two byes. The revival was not enough to push them into the finals, as they lost 4 of their last 5 matches.\n\n====Financial problems====\nIn March 2012 it was found that the Titans had fallen into $35 million debt. The team fought wind-up proceedings in the Federal Court and managed to survive the crippling situation. Newly appointed CEO David May revealed that the club was debt free in 2013.\n\n===2013\u20132014: Promising starts, mid-season fadeouts and salary cap breach===\n{{main|2013 Gold Coast Titans season}}\n\nThe Titans only signed a handful of players for the 2013 season, most notably Australian and Queensland representative [[David Taylor (rugby league)|Dave Taylor]], as well as controversial halfback [[Albert Kelly]], who had been sacked from his previous 2 clubs. The club, however, also lost their captain [[Scott Prince]] to the [[Brisbane Broncos]].\n\nThe club managed to win 4 of their first 6 matches to put themselves in the top 8. They then lost consecutive matches against the [[Newcastle Knights]] and the [[New Zealand Warriors]]. Since then, the club and won another 4 from their next 6, to put them at 5th on the ladder. An injury to form centre [[Jamal Idris]] for the rest of the season derailed their promising campaign. The club their next 4 matches, seeing them slide outside the top 8. Prop [[Ryan James (rugby league)|Ryan James]] hit a purple patch of form in the last 6 rounds. However, the club only managed to win 3 of these 6 games, which wasn't enough to push them inside the top 8. The Titans finished on 26 points, 2 points behind the 8th placed [[North Queensland Cowboys]]\n\nDuring the season, the Gold Coast Titans managed to break their biggest ever winning margin (heading into the season) 3 times. Their biggest ever win before 2013 was by 26 points against the [[Parramatta Eels]] back in 2007. In 2013, the club managed a 36-point win over the [[Canberra Raiders]], a 38-point win over the [[Parramatta Eels]], and a 28-point win over the [[Wests Tigers]]. Another positive to come out of the season was the new halves pairing of [[Albert Kelly]] and [[Aiden Sezer]], who played the majority of the season alongside one another.\n\n{{main|2014 Gold Coast Titans season}}\n\nBefore the 2014 season started, the Gold Coast Titans lost marquee centre [[Jamal Idris]] to the [[Penrith Panthers]]. The centre left the club only 2 years into his 5-year contract, because he wanted to be closer to his family in Sydney. The Titans didn't sign any marquee players for the 2014 season, but did pick up Penrith's centre [[Brad Tighe]], Melbourne utility [[Maurice Blair]], and the Bulldog's forward [[Paul Carter (rugby league)|Paul Carter]]. One of the Titan's foundation players, [[Luke O'Dwyer]], also retired.\n\nThe beginning of the 2014 season look promising for the Titans. The club managed to win 5 of their first 6 games, putting them at outright 1st on the NRL ladder. This period included a 4-game winning streak, including a nail biting Queensland derby against the [[Brisbane Broncos]], and a controversial 2-point win over the [[Melbourne Storm]] in Melbourne. In rounds 7 and 8, the club recorded a 2-point loss to the Panthers, and a 14-point win over the [[Wests Tigers]] in Sydney. However, the promising start to the year ended there. The club then suffered 6 straight losses, 5 of which were at their home ground. Round 17 saw the Titans record their first win in over 2 months, with an ugly 4-point win over the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]]. However, the club then suffered a defeat by the out of form [[Canberra Raiders]] on the Gold Coast. In round 19, the Titans travelled to Newcastle for the cornerstone match in the 'Rise for Alex Round'. The Titans managed to produce a 22-6 upset win. Since then, however, the club has lost another 6 straight games, including a dismal 42\u20130 loss to the [[New Zealand Warriors]]. This would be the first time the club has been held to nil since their inception in 2007.\n\nIn round 24, prop [[Luke Douglas]] would miss his first ever game since his debut in 2006, after being suspended as a result of the [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks supplements saga|2011 Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks supplements scandal]]. His record streak was halted at 215 consecutive games.\n\nFrom round 11 to round 20, [[David Taylor (rugby league)|David Taylor]] produced his best patch of form since joining the club. This included 5 tries in 6 games, and also earned him a recall into the Queensland State of Origin team for games 2 and 3 of the 2014 series. Halfback [[Albert Kelly]] also had a promising start to the season, scoring 5 tries in the opening 5 games, 4 of which were intercept tries. Foundation coach [[John Cartwright (rugby league)|John Cartwright]] would coach his last game in round 22, after announcing he would be standing down from the role. Assistant coach [[Neil Henry]] will coach the club for the remaining 4 rounds.\n\nThe Titans were able to end the difficult year on a high upsetting the Bulldogs who went on the play in the grand final at home 19\u201318.\n\nAfter an investigation by the NRL into the Titans and five other clubs (Brisbane Broncos, Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, Newcastle Knights and Sydney Roosters), the Titans were fined AU$300,000.\n\n===2015\u2013Present: NRL takeover; Return to the Finals and disastrous years===\n{{main|2015 Gold Coast Titans season}}\nOn 24 February, the club was placed into [[Administration (law)#Australia|voluntary administration]] and its [[licence]] was transferred to the [[National Rugby League|NRL]] in February 2015.\n\nOne day before the 2015 NRL season kicked off, [[Daly Cherry-Evans]] announced he would join the club on a four-year deal starting from 2016, with the deal reported to be worth over $1 million a season. Titans [[Chief Executive Officer]], [[Graham Annesley]], stated \"I think this signing sends a positive sign to the rugby league world that this club does have a future and it can attract quality players and it can turn itself around.\"\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sportsnews.com.au/nrl/dce-coup-proof-of-titans-bright-nrl-future/136263|title=DCE coup proof of Titans bright NRL future|date= 7 March 2015|accessdate=24 January 2018}}</ref> However, on 3 June 2015, Cherry-Evans reneged his deal with the Titans, and re-signed with the Manly Sea Eagles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/daly-cherry-evans-to-remain-at-manly-after-reneging-on-titans-deal/story-fni3gnk1-1227380941597|title=Cherry-Evans Manly deal worth up to $10m|website=Dailytelegraph.com.au|accessdate=2 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter the money from Cherry-Evans' contract was freed up, due to him no longer joining the club for the 2016 season and beyond, the Titans signed a handful of players during the off-season. Signings included halves [[Tyrone Roberts]] and [[Ashley Taylor (rugby league)|Ashley Taylor]] from the Newcastle Knights and Brisbane Broncos respectively, former Titans hooker [[Nathan Friend]] from the New Zealand Warriors, props [[David Shillington]] and [[Zeb Taia]] from the Canberra Raiders and Catalans Dragons, and premiership winning second-rower [[Chris McQueen]] from the South Sydney Rabbitohs.\n\n{{main|2016 Gold Coast Titans season}}\n\nThe first half of the Titans' season was shaky, having won six games, and also losing six games, sitting in the Top 8 by the end of Round 13. During this time, the Titans added New Zealand Warriors centre [[Konrad Hurrell]] to their roster, as well as former Parramatta hooker [[Nathan Peats]], who was forced out of his former club due to the [[Parramatta Eels salary cap breach|club's ongoing salary cap scandal]]. On 3 August, the club ultimately made up for the reneging of Daly Cherry Evans by signing 2 time Dally M medal winner and cross code superstar [[Jarryd Hayne]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrl.com/hayne-returns-to-nrl-with-titans/tabid/10874/newsid/99865/default.aspx|title=Hayne returns to NRL with Titans|website=Nrl.com|accessdate=2 May 2017}}</ref> who was available to play for the club immediately and was signed until 2017. By Round 26's end, the Titans won 11 games, drew 1 and lost 12, earning 27 premiership points in total. This allowed the Titans to return to the NRL Finals for the first time since 2010, after the 9th placed Wests Tigers lost 52-10 to the Canberra Raiders.\nThe Titans played the Brisbane Broncos in a controversial elimination final on 10 September and were knocked out 44\u201328, ending their 2016 season.\n\n2017 was a year to forget for Gold Coast as they finished 15th on the table at the end of the season. Star recruit [[Kevin Proctor]] was stripped of his co-captaincy responsibilities in May after allegations relating to drug use whilst in camp with The Kiwis and Hayne's ankle injury and shifting between fullback and centre became a distraction more than a solution.  There was also the ongoing feud between coach Neil Henry and Hayne which resulted in Henry's tenure coming to an end after their Round 24 loss to Parramatta.<ref>https://www.nrl.com/news/2017/09/05/titans-2017-season-review/</ref> To make matters worse, the Titans suffered their heaviest loss to date, losing to the Broncos 54\u20130 at Cbus Super Stadium.\n\nOn 18 October 2017, Gold Coast appointed Garth Brennan as their new coach.  At the end of 2017, Jarryd Hayne left the club to rejoin Parramatta for the 2018 season ending one of the most turbulent times in the club's history.<ref>http://www.sportingnews.com/au/league/news/nrl-coach-gold-coast-titans-garth-brennan-salary-neil-henry-new-owners-and-full-draw-2018/1uabq5k78zinm1olpsdnob4zjs</ref><ref>https://www.news.com.au/sport/nrl/hayne-triggers-titans-exit/news-story/14073e7d4a053b60c98abc2deab6b07d</ref>\n\nBefore the 2018 NRL season began most experts predicted Gold Coast to be contending for the wooden spoon come season's end but the club shocked many critics after winning 3 of their first 5 matches.  Gold Coast then went on an inconsistent run of form and ended finishing 14th on the table at the end of the regular season.<ref>https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/09/08/gold-coast-titans-2018-season-review/</ref>\n\nGold Coast started the [[2019 NRL season]] badly with the club losing the first four matches before finally recording a victory in Round 5 against Penrith.  On 14 July 2019, Gold Coast head coach [[Garth Brennan]] was terminated by the club following a 24\u20132 loss against Penrith which left them rooted to the bottom of the table.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/gold-coast-titans-sack-coach-garth-brennan/|title=Gold Coast Titans sack coach Garth Brennan|website=The Guardian}}</ref>\nIn the aftermath of Brennan's termination, Gold Coast CEO Dennis Watt refuted claims that the struggling club would be relocated to Brisbane saying \"For the benefit of Titans Members, fans and sponsors, here are the facts: We are the Gold Coast Titans, and that is how we will stay\".  Watt later said that the appointment of the next coach would be the club's last stand saying \"We're in no doubt that this is it, This is the last stand, we have to get it right, There are plenty of other people banging on the door who would probably like to launch teams elsewhere\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.katherinetimes.com.au/story/6273176/coach-choice-titans-last-stand-chairman/|title=Coach choice Titans' last stand: chairman|website=Katherine Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.news.com.au/sport/nrl/nrl-2019-gold-coast-titans-hit-back-at-relocation-rumours/news-story/8608e4283e2b452a9886d31b4e7eec7a/|title=Gold Coast Titans hit back at relocation rumours|website=News.com.au}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 July 2019, Gold Coast announced that [[St Helens R.F.C.|St Helens]] coach [[Justin Holbrook]] would be the club's new head coach starting in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/49156636/|title=St Helens head coach set to leave Super League leaders for Gold Coast|website=BBC}}</ref>\nIn Round 20 of the [[2019 NRL season]], the Gold Coast suffered their second heaviest defeat as a club losing 58-6 to the [[Sydney Roosters]] at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]].  Interim head coach [[Craig Hodges (rugby league)|Craig Hodges]] described the loss by saying \"The fear is that it is the habit they allow...that becomes acceptable for them individually whether they stay here or whether they move on to other places, And if that\u2019s what they take out of this season, if that\u2019s their legacy moving forward from this season, I think that\u2019s a terrible tragedy\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrl.com/news/2019/08/04/brett-morris-racks-up-try-150-as-roosters-outclass-titans/|title=Horror show for Holbrook as Roosters run riot|website=NRL}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/teams/titans/terrible-tragedy-why-gold-coast-titans-players-should-fear-for-their-futures-after-loss-to-roosters/news-story/1a33cdc1d26f95de59099fb343d0dbb0/|title='Terrible tragedy': Why Gold Coast Titans players should fear for their futures after loss to Roosters|website=Fox Sports}}</ref>\n\nOn 5 August 2019, Gold Coast co-captain [[Kevin Proctor]] wrote an open letter to the club's fans, apologizing for their performance against the [[Sydney Roosters]].  Proctor wrote \"As a playing group, we were humiliated, embarrassed and appalled at the result and the way that we played as a team, I don't have any explanation for why the game panned out the way it did, It has been a hard year, and you deserve better than the results we have delivered, and we're sorry.

The consortium aligned themselves with Gold Coast Radio Station [[90.9 Sea FM]], and set up a competition in which listeners could submit possible names for the new team. This was shortlisted into ten names, which through online voting was shortened to three: Titans, Stingers and Pirates. Online voting continued, with team being branded as the Gold Coast Titans on 21 September 2005. After the team name was chosen, fans were given six jerseys to vote for on the club's website, with option 6 ultimately being successful.\n\n==Stadium==\nFor their first season in the [[National Rugby League]], the Titans played out of [[Carrara Stadium]] on Nerang-Broadbeach Road, while their 27,000-seat stadium, known as [[Robina Stadium|Skilled Park]] through sponsorship in Robina, was being completed. Carrara Stadium was cited as one of the main reasons the Gold Coast bid was rejected in their first attempt to rejoin the NRL, due to the fact that Carrara only seated around 16,000, and was an oval.\n\nWork on the new stadium commenced at the end of 2005, and the facility was ready for play before the start of the 2008 NRL season. The project was managed by the same company that constructed [[Suncorp Stadium]], [[the Gabba]] \u2013 Queensland's largest and most famous stadium, and [[Telstra Stadium]] \u2013 the Sydney 2000 Olympic Stadium. The new stadium has a capacity of 27,400 \u2013 2,400 more than originally planned for. It has since been renamed Cbus Super Stadium.\n\n==Titans TV==\nThe Gold Coast Titans operate a TV channel, Titans TV, that serves the Gold Coast area and is carried by Foxtel on the Gold Coast.  Its main programming features match highlights and player biographies.\n\n==Players==\n{{details|Gold Coast Titans Players}}\nAlthough other players may play for the Gold Coast Titans during the year, all NRL clubs are required to select a top 25 First Grade squad at the beginning of the season.

The club competes in the [[National Rugby League]] (NRL) premiership, Australia's elite rugby league competition. It is the newest of the sixteen clubs in the league, having commenced its [[2007 Gold Coast Titans season|inaugural season]] on 18 March 2007. Since 2008, the Titans have played their home games at [[Robina Stadium|Cbus Super Stadium]] in [[Robina, Queensland]].\n\nThe Titans are the second top-level rugby league club to have been based on the Gold Coast, the first being the ill-fated [[Gold Coast Chargers|Gold Coast-Tweed Giants / Gold Coast Seagulls / Gold Coast Chargers]], which existed from 1988 to 1998.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Gold Coast Titans History}}\n{{See also|Gold Coast Chargers}}\n\n===Formation===\nThe beginnings of a Gold Coast team's bid to return to the [[National Rugby League]] began when the [[Australian Rugby League]] decided to remove the financially successful [[Gold Coast Chargers]] from the [[National Rugby League]] at the end of the [[National Rugby League season 1998|1998 Season]]. The ARL wanted to have a second major team based in Brisbane and believed the best way to achieve this was by removing the Gold Coast team from the competition. The attempt to launch a second Brisbane team failed and in 1999, [[Michael Searle]], former Gold Coast Chargers player and Managing Director of International Sports Australia, formed a Gold Coast Bid Team. The team included former Chargers boss [[Paul Broughton]] and was labelled as \"The Gold Coast Consortium\" by the media. The board was constantly active in lobbying the NRL to both expand the competition and consider the Gold Coast's bid for inclusion. It was successful in organising pre-season NRL trial matches to be hosted on the Gold Coast and with average attendances of over 16,000, and peak attendances topping 20,000, the popularity of rugby league on the Coast was clear.\n\n{{Quotation|I firmly believe rugby league should be looking to expand. The Gold Coast area is growing at a phenomenal rate. There are 89 rugby league teams in Gold Coast primary schools and 59 teams in Gold Coast high schools representing about 2,300 young players. That's just schoolboys.\n\nIf the catchment area includes the region from South Brisbane to Byron Bay in northern NSW, then it covers a rugby league heartland starving for recognition.  These areas would only blossom even more if the young players had a senior team in the NRL competition to which they could aspire.\n\nSouth-east Queensland needs another NRL team desperately and for a whole host of reasons.|[[Phil Gould (rugby league)|Phil Gould]], 21 December 2003<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = Gould\n  | first = Phil\n  | authorlink = Phil Gould\n  | title = NRL expansion talk excites Gold Coast\n  | work = [[The Sun-Herald]]\n  | publisher = The Sydney Morning Herald\n  | date = 21 December 2003\n  | url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/12/20/1071868703349.html?from=storyrhs\n  | accessdate = 6 October 2009}}\n</ref>}}\n\nIn August 2004, the NRL rejected Michael Searle's bid for re-adding a Gold Coast team.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = English\n  | first = Ben\n  | title = A man's mission to unite NRL \n  | work = [[Herald Sun]]\n  | publisher = Herald and Weekly Times\n  | date = 10 October 2009\n  | url = http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/a-mans-mission-to-unite-nrl/story-e6frfgbo-1225785198845\n  | archive-date = 2009-10-14\n  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091014233649/http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/a-mans-mission-to-unite-nrl/story-e6frfgbo-1225785198845\n  | accessdate = 11 October 2009}}</ref> However, later, during an episode of [[Nine Network]]'s [[The NRL Footy Show]], the \"Gold Coast Consortium\" announced their team name and jersey to the public from the [[Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre]]. Initially the team was to be named the Gold Coast Dolphins, with the team colours to be white, jade and orange. While the Dolphins moniker was popular among many, the heavyweight Brisbane [[Queensland Cup]] side the [[Redcliffe Dolphins]] saw it as a threat for any prospect of entering the NRL they had, and as a result threatened severe legal action if the Gold Coast used the Dolphins name. Midway through that year the National Rugby League announced that after viewing submissions from the Gold Coast Dolphins, the [[Bring back the bears|Central Coast Bears]] and the [[Wellington Orcas]], there would not be a 16th team included in the [[NRL season 2006|2006 NRL competition]]. Reasons given to the Gold Coast was the National Rugby Leagues concern over the quality and capacity of their homeground, [[Carrara Stadium]], which is an oval and only seats 16,000 (although it has been known to fit in 23,000 after minor redevelopment).\n\nAlthough their bid was knocked back, the consortium continued to push heavily in 2005 for a Gold Coast NRL team, changing the entry year to 2007. The Gold Coast received a massive boost when the Queensland Government announced they would spend A$100 million on a new, 25,000-seat rectangular stadium in [[Robina, Queensland|Robina]] for the Gold Coast should they be accepted into the 2007 competition. The stadium would not be completed until early 2008 yet the promise of a new first-class facility was enough for the NRL to accept the Gold Coasts bid and on 27 May 2005, NRL CEO [[David Gallop]] announced that the Gold Coast franchise would be the 16th team in the [[2007 NRL season]].\n\nIn the time since the Gold Coast was admitted, the Titans completed a vigorous recruitment drive, they announced the signing of [[Sydney Roosters]] assistant coach [[John Cartwright (rugby league)|John Cartwright]] as the Titans first head-coach and successfully signed contracts with established players such as [[Dally M Medal]] winner [[Preston Campbell]], [[Queensland state rugby league team|Queensland]] & [[Australia national rugby league team|Australian]] representative [[Scott Prince]], [[New South Wales state rugby league team|New South Wales]] & [[Australia national rugby league team|Australian]] representative [[Luke Bailey (rugby league)|Luke Bailey]] and enticing former league player [[Mat Rogers]] back from rugby union.\n\n===2007\u20132008: Laying the foundations===\n{{main|2007 Gold Coast Titans season}}\n\nIn February 2007, the Titans played their historic first game in a trial against the previous season's Minor-Premiers and Grand Finalists [[Melbourne Storm]], previously the newest club in the League (apart from the merged teams). They were beaten in the club's first hit-out but over the following weeks, Cartwright fielded his full strength team in two other pre-season trials, winning 22\u201310 over the [[Parramatta Eels]] for the club's first victory. The following week in the team first played in front of their home fans on the Gold Coast, they ran out 28\u20136 winners over the [[Penrith Panthers]]. Although merely trial matches, the signs were positive for the Titans' debut season to come.\n\nThe Titans played their first official match in Round 1 of the [[National Rugby League season 2007|2007 NRL season]] against the [[St George Illawarra Dragons]]. Their first game was moved from their home ground, [[Carrara Stadium]], to [[Suncorp Stadium]] in Brisbane due to the huge demand of fans eager to see the new Gold Coast outfit in action, and on 18 March 2007, in front of over 42,000 people they made their debut. Gold Coast performed admirably but after falling 14 points behind in the second half 20\u20136 they couldn't manage a full comeback losing a tight match 20\u201318. Former Queensland State of Origin winger [[Chris Walker (rugby league)|Chris Walker]], who had been released by [[Melbourne Storm]] due to off-field troubles in 2006, started his rugby league comeback scoring two tries and two conversions for a 14-point haul for the Titans.\n\nThe close loss to the Dragons wouldn't last long in the memories of Titans fans as a week later the Gold Coast franchise recorded their first official victory in another tight match, winning 18\u201316 against the [[Cronulla Sharks]] at home. The start of the season saw the Titans only manage four wins in the first ten rounds but a mid-season five-week-long winning streak of four wins and a bye saw the Titans sitting in the top four at the conclusion of Round 15. The streak was ended in a poor 22\u20136 loss against the [[New Zealand Warriors]] at home, then they slumped to a 5-match losing streak which included a [[golden point]] loss to the [[Brisbane Broncos]] in Round 17 and a 56\u201310 loss at the hands of the [[Canberra Raiders]] in Round 18. The Titans wouldn't register another win until Round 21, but by then they had already slipped to 11th position and needed to obtain maximum points from the final four rounds to confirm a spot in the finals in their maiden season. The side only managed one win from the final four matches, however, missing out on the finals. In the final round, a 50\u20136 thrashing at the hands of [Melbourne Storm] ended the Titans' debut season on somewhat of a sour note, with the young Gold Coast franchise finishing the season in 12th position with 10 wins, 14 losses and a bye for 22 competition points.\n\nDespite having an outdated home ground ([[Carrara Stadium]]) as they waited for their new stadium ([[Skilled Park]]) to be completed, the Titans had the second-highest average attendance of all NRL clubs for 2007.<ref>{{cite news\n |last=Gallop \n |first=David \n |authorlink=David Gallop \n |title=Australian Rugby Football League Annual Report 2007 \n |page=5 \n |publisher=Australian Rugby League Limited \n |year=2007 \n |url=http://www.australianrugbyleague.com.au/files/ARL_2007_Annrep_1.pdf \n |format=PDF \n |accessdate=15 July 2009 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913145959/http://www.australianrugbyleague.com.au/files/ARL_2007_Annrep_1.pdf \n |archivedate=13 September 2009 \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of 2007 [[Luke Bailey (rugby league)|Luke Bailey]] and [[Anthony Laffranchi]] were named co-winners of the club's inaugural [[Paul Broughton]] Medal for best and fairest player of the season.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = abc.net.au\n  | title = Bailey, Laffranchi share Titans' top honour\n  | work = ABC News\n  | place =Australia\n  | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]\n  | date = 4 October 2007\n  | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/10/04/2050448.htm?site=news\n  | accessdate = 4 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn their debut season, the Gold Coast club had turned over $16 million.<ref>{{Cite news \n  | last = Badel\n  | first = Peter\n  | title = Michael Searle proud of Gold Coast Titans \n  | work = [[The Sunday Mail (Brisbane)|The Sunday Mail]]\n  | place = Australia\n  | publisher = Queensland Newspapers\n  | date = 13 September 2009\n  | url = http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/nrl/michael-searle-proud-of-gold-coast-titans/story-e6frep5x-1225772136346\n  | accessdate = 6 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n{{main|2008 Gold Coast Titans season}}\n\nThe [[2008 NRL season]] was the Titans' second in the National Rugby League. A major boost for the Titans was the signing of past [[Queensland state rugby league team|Queensland]] representative [[Ashley Harrison]] from the [[Sydney Roosters]].\n\nThe Titans played their first official match at their new Stadium, [[Skilled Park]], against the [[North Queensland Cowboys]] with the final score being 36\u201318. Rookie [[Jordan Atkins]] became only the second person in the history of Australian rugby league to score four tries on debut, alongside Canterbury's [[Tony Nash (rugby league)|Tony Nash]] in 1942. The sellout 26,974-strong crowd assisted the Titans in firmly establishing that they were a force to be reckoned with in 2008.\n\nThe club went on to hit top place on the NRL ladder for the first time after round 6. They managed to maintain top spot on the ladder all the way until round 11, when a loss to Wests Tigers saw them forfeit top spot to the Sydney Roosters, who led in points differential. At the conclusion of Round 14, the Titans were equal first on points, fourth on points differential, employing a perfect home record for inspiration. Despite facing a tough home stretch, the Titans placed admirably in their pursuit of an inaugural finals campaign.\n\nOne of the Titans' strongest points in 2008 was the form of halfback Scott Prince, who earned selection for State of Origin. However early in Game 3, his arm was broken, putting him on the sideline for the season. Subsequently, the Titans lost four straight games.\n\nThey finished their season at 13th on the NRL ladder.\n\nThis year their turnover increased to $22 million and the club posted a $1.5m profit.\n\n===2009\u20132010: First finals appearance===\n{{main|2009 Gold Coast Titans season}}\n\nThe Titans secured four new signings for the 2009 season in [[Sam Tagataese]], [[Matthew White (rugby league)|Matthew White]], [[Jackson Nicolau]] and Raiders speedster [[William Zillman]].\n\nSimilar to the Titans previous seasons, they find themselves on top of the competition ladder after six rounds sitting on ten premiership points alongside their rivals the [[Brisbane Broncos]]. Early victories against the [[Canterbury Bulldogs]] and the [[Melbourne Storm]] away from home without skipper [[Scott Prince]], silenced many of their critics who believed they could not win away from the holiday strip or without their veteran halfback.\n\nMany of the Titans NYC side made their debut and turned into regular first-graders, such as [[Esi Tonga]], [[David Mead (rugby league)|David Mead]] and [[Kevin Gordon]]. [[Kayne Lawton]], [[Bodene Thompson]] and [[Selasi Berdie]] also made their NRL debut.\n\nThe club's most successful season so far saw them finish in 3rd position, which was in 2009. They were 2 points behind the competition front-runners [[St. George Illawarra Dragons]] and the [[Canterbury Bulldogs]]. In the 2009 finals series, they lost their qualifying final 40\u201332 against the [[Brisbane Broncos]], then lost the semi-final 27\u20132 against the [[Parramatta Eels]].\n\n{{main|2010 Gold Coast Titans season}}\n\nThe Titans signed five new players for the 2010 season in [[Joe Tomane]], [[Marshall Chalk]], [[Riley Brown]], [[Clinton Toopi]], [[Greg Bird (rugby league)|Greg Bird]] and [[Steve Michaels]]\n\nThe Titans lost a number of players for the 2010 season, including [[Ben Jeffery]], [[Brenton Bowen]], [[Chris Walker (rugby league)|Chris Walker]], [[Daniel Conn]], [[Brett Delaney]] and [[Siosaia Vave]].\n\nFor the second year in succession the Titans qualified for the finals, finishing 4th and thereby earning a home qualifying final against the fifth-placed [[New Zealand Warriors]]. The Titans' 28\u201316 win, coupled with losses for two other top four teams, meant that the Titans earned the week off and a right to host a preliminary final at the larger [[Lang Park|Suncorp Stadium]], which turned out to be its 100th ever premiership match. The Titans lost to the resurgent [[Sydney Roosters]], 32\u20136, ending their season one week short of the Grand Final. After 2010 the Titans finished up 4th overall in the [[2010 NRL season]], with [[Mat Rogers]] retiring at the conclusion of the season.\n\n===2011\u20132012: The wooden spoon and player turnover===\n{{main|2011 Gold Coast Titans season}}\n\nDuring the off-season the Titans lost inspirational five-eighth [[Mat Rogers]] to retirement.\n\nTo date the Titans have recorded their worst ever start to a season, losing four of their first five matches against [[St. George Illawarra Dragons|St. George Illawarra]], [[Melbourne Storm|Melbourne]], the [[Brisbane Broncos]] and [[North Queensland Cowboys|North Queensland]] by scorelines of 16&ndash;25, 16&ndash;38, 10&ndash;12 and 16&ndash;20 respectively. They never recovered from their horror start to the year only winning 6 games all year which is their worst season to date finishing on 16 points and receiving the wooden spoon.\n\n{{main|2012 Gold Coast Titans season}}\n\nThe Titans signed seven new players for the 2012 season including former [[Australian rugby league team|Australian]] and [[New South Wales state rugby league team|NSW]] representative [[Jamal Idris]] and current [[Queensland state rugby league team|QLD]] representative [[Nate Myles]] former Cronulla Sharks prop [[Luke Douglas]] They also lost key foundation players such as [[Preston Campbell]], [[Anthony Laffranchi]], [[Nathan Friend]] and [[Mat Rogers]].\n\nThe club started their 2012 with an impressive 18\u20130 win over the [[North Queensland Cowboys]] away from home. However, the success was very short lived, losing the next 5 in a row, 4 of which were at home. Round 7 saw [[Aidan Sezer]] make his NRL Debut Against the [[Manly Sea Eagles]] at [[Brookvale Oval]]. The Titans produced a 26-14 upset, with Sezer scoring in his debut. Debutant for the Titans Jamal Idris coughing up 2 tries in the round 7 match up. The next two games were losses.\n\nFrom rounds 10\u201321, the Titans managed a mid season revival. In the period, the club only lost three times, with seven wins and two byes. The revival was not enough to push them into the finals, as they lost 4 of their last 5 matches.\n\n====Financial problems====\nIn March 2012 it was found that the Titans had fallen into $35 million debt. The team fought wind-up proceedings in the Federal Court and managed to survive the crippling situation. Newly appointed CEO David May revealed that the club was debt free in 2013.\n\n===2013\u20132014: Promising starts, mid-season fadeouts and salary cap breach===\n{{main|2013 Gold Coast Titans season}}\n\nThe Titans only signed a handful of players for the 2013 season, most notably Australian and Queensland representative [[David Taylor (rugby league)|Dave Taylor]], as well as controversial halfback [[Albert Kelly]], who had been sacked from his previous 2 clubs. The club, however, also lost their captain [[Scott Prince]] to the [[Brisbane Broncos]].\n\nThe club managed to win 4 of their first 6 matches to put themselves in the top 8. They then lost consecutive matches against the [[Newcastle Knights]] and the [[New Zealand Warriors]]. Since then, the club and won another 4 from their next 6, to put them at 5th on the ladder. An injury to form centre [[Jamal Idris]] for the rest of the season derailed their promising campaign. The club their next 4 matches, seeing them slide outside the top 8. Prop [[Ryan James (rugby league)|Ryan James]] hit a purple patch of form in the last 6 rounds. However, the club only managed to win 3 of these 6 games, which wasn't enough to push them inside the top 8. The Titans finished on 26 points, 2 points behind the 8th placed [[North Queensland Cowboys]]\n\nDuring the season, the Gold Coast Titans managed to break their biggest ever winning margin (heading into the season) 3 times. Their biggest ever win before 2013 was by 26 points against the [[Parramatta Eels]] back in 2007. In 2013, the club managed a 36-point win over the [[Canberra Raiders]], a 38-point win over the [[Parramatta Eels]], and a 28-point win over the [[Wests Tigers]]. Another positive to come out of the season was the new halves pairing of [[Albert Kelly]] and [[Aiden Sezer]], who played the majority of the season alongside one another.\n\n{{main|2014 Gold Coast Titans season}}\n\nBefore the 2014 season started, the Gold Coast Titans lost marquee centre [[Jamal Idris]] to the [[Penrith Panthers]]. The centre left the club only 2 years into his 5-year contract, because he wanted to be closer to his family in Sydney. The Titans didn't sign any marquee players for the 2014 season, but did pick up Penrith's centre [[Brad Tighe]], Melbourne utility [[Maurice Blair]], and the Bulldog's forward [[Paul Carter (rugby league)|Paul Carter]]. One of the Titan's foundation players, [[Luke O'Dwyer]], also retired.\n\nThe beginning of the 2014 season look promising for the Titans. The club managed to win 5 of their first 6 games, putting them at outright 1st on the NRL ladder. This period included a 4-game winning streak, including a nail biting Queensland derby against the [[Brisbane Broncos]], and a controversial 2-point win over the [[Melbourne Storm]] in Melbourne. In rounds 7 and 8, the club recorded a 2-point loss to the Panthers, and a 14-point win over the [[Wests Tigers]] in Sydney. However, the promising start to the year ended there. The club then suffered 6 straight losses, 5 of which were at their home ground. Round 17 saw the Titans record their first win in over 2 months, with an ugly 4-point win over the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]]. However, the club then suffered a defeat by the out of form [[Canberra Raiders]] on the Gold Coast. In round 19, the Titans travelled to Newcastle for the cornerstone match in the 'Rise for Alex Round'. The Titans managed to produce a 22-6 upset win. Since then, however, the club has lost another 6 straight games, including a dismal 42\u20130 loss to the [[New Zealand Warriors]]. This would be the first time the club has been held to nil since their inception in 2007.\n\nIn round 24, prop [[Luke Douglas]] would miss his first ever game since his debut in 2006, after being suspended as a result of the [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks supplements saga|2011 Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks supplements scandal]]. His record streak was halted at 215 consecutive games.\n\nFrom round 11 to round 20, [[David Taylor (rugby league)|David Taylor]] produced his best patch of form since joining the club. This included 5 tries in 6 games, and also earned him a recall into the Queensland State of Origin team for games 2 and 3 of the 2014 series. Halfback [[Albert Kelly]] also had a promising start to the season, scoring 5 tries in the opening 5 games, 4 of which were intercept tries. Foundation coach [[John Cartwright (rugby league)|John Cartwright]] would coach his last game in round 22, after announcing he would be standing down from the role. Assistant coach [[Neil Henry]] will coach the club for the remaining 4 rounds.\n\nThe Titans were able to end the difficult year on a high upsetting the Bulldogs who went on the play in the grand final at home 19\u201318.\n\nAfter an investigation by the NRL into the Titans and five other clubs (Brisbane Broncos, Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, Newcastle Knights and Sydney Roosters), the Titans were fined AU$300,000.\n\n===2015\u2013Present: NRL takeover; Return to the Finals and disastrous years===\n{{main|2015 Gold Coast Titans season}}\nOn 24 February, the club was placed into [[Administration (law)#Australia|voluntary administration]] and its [[licence]] was transferred to the [[National Rugby League|NRL]] in February 2015.\n\nOne day before the 2015 NRL season kicked off, [[Daly Cherry-Evans]] announced he would join the club on a four-year deal starting from 2016, with the deal reported to be worth over $1 million a season. Titans [[Chief Executive Officer]], [[Graham Annesley]], stated \"I think this signing sends a positive sign to the rugby league world that this club does have a future and it can attract quality players and it can turn itself around.\"\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sportsnews.com.au/nrl/dce-coup-proof-of-titans-bright-nrl-future/136263|title=DCE coup proof of Titans bright NRL future|date= 7 March 2015|accessdate=24 January 2018}}</ref> However, on 3 June 2015, Cherry-Evans reneged his deal with the Titans, and re-signed with the Manly Sea Eagles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/daly-cherry-evans-to-remain-at-manly-after-reneging-on-titans-deal/story-fni3gnk1-1227380941597|title=Cherry-Evans Manly deal worth up to $10m|website=Dailytelegraph.com.au|accessdate=2 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter the money from Cherry-Evans' contract was freed up, due to him no longer joining the club for the 2016 season and beyond, the Titans signed a handful of players during the off-season. Signings included halves [[Tyrone Roberts]] and [[Ashley Taylor (rugby league)|Ashley Taylor]] from the Newcastle Knights and Brisbane Broncos respectively, former Titans hooker [[Nathan Friend]] from the New Zealand Warriors, props [[David Shillington]] and [[Zeb Taia]] from the Canberra Raiders and Catalans Dragons, and premiership winning second-rower [[Chris McQueen]] from the South Sydney Rabbitohs.\n\n{{main|2016 Gold Coast Titans season}}\n\nThe first half of the Titans' season was shaky, having won six games, and also losing six games, sitting in the Top 8 by the end of Round 13. During this time, the Titans added New Zealand Warriors centre [[Konrad Hurrell]] to their roster, as well as former Parramatta hooker [[Nathan Peats]], who was forced out of his former club due to the [[Parramatta Eels salary cap breach|club's ongoing salary cap scandal]]. On 3 August, the club ultimately made up for the reneging of Daly Cherry Evans by signing 2 time Dally M medal winner and cross code superstar [[Jarryd Hayne]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrl.com/hayne-returns-to-nrl-with-titans/tabid/10874/newsid/99865/default.aspx|title=Hayne returns to NRL with Titans|website=Nrl.com|accessdate=2 May 2017}}</ref> who was available to play for the club immediately and was signed until 2017. By Round 26's end, the Titans won 11 games, drew 1 and lost 12, earning 27 premiership points in total. This allowed the Titans to return to the NRL Finals for the first time since 2010, after the 9th placed Wests Tigers lost 52-10 to the Canberra Raiders.\nThe Titans played the Brisbane Broncos in a controversial elimination final on 10 September and were knocked out 44\u201328, ending their 2016 season.\n\n2017 was a year to forget for Gold Coast as they finished 15th on the table at the end of the season. Star recruit [[Kevin Proctor]] was stripped of his co-captaincy responsibilities in May after allegations relating to drug use whilst in camp with The Kiwis and Hayne's ankle injury and shifting between fullback and centre became a distraction more than a solution.  There was also the ongoing feud between coach Neil Henry and Hayne which resulted in Henry's tenure coming to an end after their Round 24 loss to Parramatta.<ref>https://www.nrl.com/news/2017/09/05/titans-2017-season-review/</ref> To make matters worse, the Titans suffered their heaviest loss to date, losing to the Broncos 54\u20130 at Cbus Super Stadium.\n\nOn 18 October 2017, Gold Coast appointed Garth Brennan as their new coach.

The consortium aligned themselves with Gold Coast Radio Station [[90.9 Sea FM]], and set up a competition in which listeners could submit possible names for the new team. This was shortlisted into ten names, which through online voting was shortened to three: Titans, Stingers and Pirates. Online voting continued, with team being branded as the Gold Coast Titans on 21 September 2005. After the team name was chosen, fans were given six jerseys to vote for on the club's website, with option 6 ultimately being successful.\n\n==Stadium==\nFor their first season in the [[National Rugby League]], the Titans played out of [[Carrara Stadium]] on Nerang-Broadbeach Road, while their 27,000-seat stadium, known as [[Robina Stadium|Skilled Park]] through sponsorship in Robina, was being completed. Carrara Stadium was cited as one of the main reasons the Gold Coast bid was rejected in their first attempt to rejoin the NRL, due to the fact that Carrara only seated around 16,000, and was an oval.\n\nWork on the new stadium commenced at the end of 2005, and the facility was ready for play before the start of the 2008 NRL season. The project was managed by the same company that constructed [[Suncorp Stadium]], [[the Gabba]] \u2013 Queensland's largest and most famous stadium, and [[Telstra Stadium]] \u2013 the Sydney 2000 Olympic Stadium. The new stadium has a capacity of 27,400 \u2013 2,400 more than originally planned for. It has since been renamed Cbus Super Stadium.\n\n==Titans TV==\nThe Gold Coast Titans operate a TV channel, Titans TV, that serves the Gold Coast area and is carried by Foxtel on the Gold Coast.  Its main programming features match highlights and player biographies.\n\n==Players==\n{{details|Gold Coast Titans Players}}\nAlthough other players may play for the Gold Coast Titans during the year, all NRL clubs are required to select a top 25 First Grade squad at the beginning of the season. Below is the list of their first grade players.\n\n{{Gold Coast Titans current squad}}\n\n==2020 signings/transfers==\n===Gains===\n* [[Jonus Pearson]] ''From'' [[St George Illawarra Dragons]]\n*\n\n===Losses===\n* [[Jesse Arthars]] ''To'' [[Brisbane Broncos]]\n* [[Ryley Jacks]] ''To'' [[Melbourne Storm]]\n* [[Leilani Latu]] ''To'' [[Warrington Wolves]]\n* [[Brenko Lee]] ''To'' [[Melbourne Storm]]\n\n==Player stats==\n===Representative players===\n{{main|List of Gold Coast Titans representatives}}\n\n===Player records===\n{{main|Gold Coast Titans Records}}\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n==Coaches==\nThere have been 7 coaches of the Titans since their first season in 2007.\nThe current coach is [[Justin Holbrook]].\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

This typically entitles the [[stockholder]] to that fraction of the company's earnings, proceeds from liquidation of assets (after discharge of all [[Seniority (financial)|senior claims]] such as secured and unsecured [[debt]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp|title=stock Definition|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=25 February 2012}}</ref> or voting power, often dividing these up in proportion to the amount of money each stockholder has invested.  Not all stock is necessarily equal, as certain classes of stock may be issued for example without voting rights, with enhanced voting rights, or with a certain priority to receive profits or liquidation proceeds before or after other classes of shareholders.\n\nStock can be bought and sold privately or on [[stock exchange]]s, and such transactions are typically heavily regulated by governments to prevent fraud, protect investors, and benefit the larger economy. The stocks are deposited with the depositories in the electronic format also known as Demat account. As [[Equity issuance|new shares are issued]] by a company, the ownership and rights of existing shareholders are diluted in return for cash to sustain or grow the business. Companies can also [[Share repurchase|buy back stock]], which often lets investors recoup the initial investment plus [[capital gains]] from subsequent rises in stock price.  [[Stock options]], issued by many companies as part of employee compensation, do not represent ownership, but represent the right to buy ownership at a future time at a specified price.  This would represent a windfall to the employees if the option is exercised when the market price is higher than the promised price, since if they immediately sold the stock they would keep the difference (minus taxes).\n\n==Shares==\nA person who owns a  percentage of the stock has the ownership of the corporation proportional to his share. The shares  form stock. The stock of a corporation is partitioned into [[share (finance)|shares]], the total of which are stated at the time of business formation.  Additional shares may subsequently be authorized by the existing shareholders and issued by the company.  In some jurisdictions, each share of stock has a certain declared [[par value]], which is a nominal accounting value used to represent the equity on the [[balance sheet]] of the corporation. In other jurisdictions, however, shares of stock may be issued without associated par value.\n\nShares represent a fraction of [[ownership]] in a business. A [[business]] may declare different types (or classes) of shares, each having distinctive ownership rules, privileges, or share values.  Ownership of shares may be documented by issuance of a [[stock certificate]].  A stock certificate is a legal document that specifies the number of shares owned by the [[shareholder]], and other specifics of the shares, such as the par value, if any, or the class of the shares.<ref>{{cite news| title = Defining Stock | publisher =boundless-finance | url =https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-finance/chapter/defining-stock/ }}</ref>      \n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland]], [[South Africa]], and [[Australia]], ''stock'' can also refer to completely different [[financial instruments]] such as government [[bond (finance)|bonds]] or, less commonly, to all kinds of [[marketable securities]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=78290&dict=CALD |title=Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary |publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\nStock typically takes the form of shares of either [[common stock]] or [[preferred stock]].  As a unit of ownership, common stock typically carries [[voting rights]] that can be exercised in corporate decisions. [[Preferred stock]] differs from common stock in that it typically does not carry voting rights but is legally entitled to receive a certain level of [[dividend]] payments before any dividends can be issued to other shareholders.<ref name=\"investor guide\">{{cite web|url=http://www.investorguide.com/igu-article-818-stock-basics-common-and-preferred-stock.html|title=Common Stock vs. Preferred Stock, and Stock Classes|work=InvestorGuide.com}}</ref><ref name = \"investments\">Zvi Bodie, Alex Kane, Alan J. Marcus, ''Investments'', 9th Ed., {{ISBN|978-0078034695}}.</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2013}}  Convertible preferred stock is preferred stock that includes an [[option (finance)|option]] for the holder to convert the preferred shares into a fixed number of common shares, usually any time after a predetermined date. Shares of such stock are called \"convertible preferred shares\" (or \"convertible preference shares\" in the UK).\n\nNew [[Equity (finance)|equity]] issue may have specific legal clauses attached that differentiate them from previous issues of the issuer. Some shares of common stock may be issued without the typical voting rights, for instance, or some shares may have special rights unique to them and issued only to certain parties. Often, new issues that have not been registered with a securities governing body may be [[restricted stock|restricted]] from resale for certain periods of time.\n\nPreferred stock may be [[Hybrid Investment|hybrid]] by having the qualities of bonds of fixed returns and common stock voting rights. They also have preference in the payment of dividends over common stock and also have been given preference at the time of liquidation over common stock. They have other features of accumulation in dividend. In addition, preferred stock usually comes with a letter designation at the end of the security; for example, Berkshire-Hathaway [[Class B share|Class \"B\" shares]] sell under stock ticker BRK.B, whereas [[Class A share|Class \"A\" shares]] of ORION DHC, Inc will sell under ticker OODHA until the company drops the \"A\" creating ticker OODH for its \"Common\" shares only designation. This extra letter does not mean that any exclusive rights exist for the shareholders but it does let investors know that the shares are considered for such, however, these rights or privileges may change based on the decisions made by the underlying company.\n\n===Rule 144 stock===\n\"[[Securities Act of 1933#Rule 144|Rule 144]] Stock\" is an American term given to shares of stock subject to SEC Rule 144: Selling Restricted and Control Securities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/rule144.htm|title=Rule 144: Selling Restricted and Control Securities|publisher=US Securities and Exchange Commission|accessdate=18 May 2013}}</ref> Under Rule 144, restricted and controlled securities are acquired in unregistered form.  Investors either purchase or take ownership of these securities through  private sales (or other means such as via ESOPs or in exchange for seed money) from the issuing company (as in the case with Restricted Securities) or from an affiliate of the issuer (as in the case with Control Securities). Investors wishing to sell these securities are subject to different rules than those selling traditional common or preferred stock.  These individuals will only be allowed to liquidate their securities after meeting the specific conditions set forth by SEC Rule 144. Rule 144 allows public re-sale of restricted securities if a number of different conditions are met.\n\n==Stock derivatives==\n{{details|equity derivative}}\n\nA stock [[derivative (finance)|derivative]] is any financial instrument for which the [[underlying]] asset is the price of an equity. [[Futures contract|Futures]] and [[option (finance)|options]] are the main types of derivatives on stocks. The underlying security may be a [[stock index]] or an individual firm's stock, e.g. [[single-stock futures]].\n\nStock futures are contracts where the buyer is [[long (finance)|long]], i.e., takes on the obligation to buy on the contract maturity date, and the seller is [[short (finance)|short]], i.e., takes on the obligation to sell. [[Equity derivative#Stock Index Futures|Stock index futures]] are generally delivered by cash settlement.\n\nA [[stock option]] is a class of option. Specifically, a [[call option]] is the right (''not'' obligation) to buy stock in the future at a fixed price and a [[put option]] is the right (''not'' obligation) to sell stock in the future at a fixed price. Thus, the value of a stock option changes in reaction to the underlying stock of which it is a [[derivative (finance)|derivative]]. The most popular method of valuing stock options is the [[Black\u2013Scholes model]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tradingtoday.com/black-scholes |title=Black Scholes Calculator |publisher=Tradingtoday.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref> Apart from [[employee stock option|call options granted to employees]], most stock options are transferable.\n\n==History==\n[[File:VOC aandeel 9 september 1606.jpg|thumb|One of the earliest stock by the [[Dutch East India Company]]]]\nDuring the Roman Republic, the state contracted (leased) out many of its services to private companies. These government contractors were called ''publicani'', or ''societas publicanorum'' as individual companies.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]]''</ref> These companies were similar to modern corporations, or [[joint-stock companies]] more specifically, in a couple of aspects. They issued shares called ''partes'' (for large cooperatives) and ''particulae'' which were small shares that acted like today's over-the-counter shares.<ref>(Cic. pro Rabir. Post. 2; Val. Max. VI.9 \u00a77)</ref> Polybius mentions that \"almost every citizen\" participated in the government leases.<ref>(Polybius, 6, 17, 3)</ref> There is also evidence that the price of stocks fluctuated. The Roman orator Cicero speaks of ''partes illo tempore carissimae'', which means \u201cshares that had a very high price at that time\".<ref>(Cicero, P. VAT. 12, 29.)</ref> This implies a fluctuation of price and stock market behavior in Rome.\n\nAround 1250 in [[France]] at [[Toulouse]], 96 shares of the ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Moulins du Bazacle'', or [[Bazacle Milling Company]] were traded at a value that depended on the profitability of the mills the society owned.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.euronext.com/editorial/wide/editorial-1989-EN.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120913/http://www.euronext.com/editorial/wide/editorial-1989-EN.html |archivedate=13 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }} </ref> As early as 1288, the [[Sweden|Swedish]] mining and forestry products company [[Stora]] has documented a stock transfer, in which the Bishop of V\u00e4ster\u00e5s acquired a 12.5% interest in the mine (or more specifically, the mountain in which the [[copper]] resource was available, the [[Great Copper Mountain]]) in exchange for an estate.\n\nThe earliest recognized joint-stock company in modern times was the English (later British) [[East India Company]], one of the most famous joint-stock companies. It was granted an English [[Royal Charter]] by [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] on December 31, 1600, with the intention of favouring trade privileges in [[India]]. The Royal Charter effectively gave the newly created ''Honourable East India Company'' (HEIC) a 15-year [[monopoly]] on all trade in the [[East Indies]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Mercantilism as Strategic Trade Policy: The Anglo-Dutch Rivalry for the East India Trade |first=Douglas A. |last=Irwin |journal=The Journal of Political Economy |volume=99 |date=December 1991 |pages=1296\u20131314 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |jstor=2937731 |issue=6 |doi=10.1086/261801 |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/1990/392/ifdp392.pdf }} at 1299.</ref> The company transformed from a commercial trading venture to one that virtually ruled [[India]] as it acquired auxiliary governmental and military functions, until its dissolution.\n\n[[File:British East India Company flag.svg|thumb|The East India Company's flag initially had the [[flag of England]], [[St. George's Cross]], in the corner.]]\nSoon afterwards, in 1602,<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://mkeshav.com/top-20-pieces-of-investment-advice-from-warren-Buffett |ssrn=1676251 |title=Tips To Invest In The Stock Market |last=Stringham |first=Edward |year=2003 |journal=Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance |volume=43 |issue=2 |page=321 |doi=10.1016/S1062-9769(02)00153-9 }}</ref> the [[Dutch East India Company]] issued the first shares that were made tradeable on the [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]], an invention that enhanced the ability of joint-stock companies to attract capital from investors as they now easily could dispose of their shares.<ref>[http://www.worldsoldestshare.com/ The oldest share in the world], issued by the [[Dutch East India Company]] (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie or VOC), 1606.</ref> The Dutch East India Company became the first multinational corporation and the first megacorporation. Between 1602 and 1796 it traded 2.5 million tons of cargo with Asia on 4,785 ships and sent a million Europeans to work in Asia, surpassing all other rivals.\n\nThe innovation of joint ownership made a great deal of [[Europe]]'s [[economic growth]] possible following the [[Middle Ages]]. The technique of pooling capital to finance the building of ships, for example, made the [[Netherlands]] a [[Shipping|maritime]] [[superpower]]. Before the adoption of the joint-stock corporation, an expensive venture such as the building of a merchant ship could be undertaken only by governments or by very wealthy individuals or families.\n\nEconomic historians{{Who|date=May 2016}} find the Dutch stock market of the 17th century particularly interesting: there is clear documentation of the use of stock futures, [[stock options]], [[short selling]], the use of credit to purchase shares, a speculative bubble that crashed in 1695, and a change in fashion that unfolded and reverted in time with the market (in this case it was headdresses instead of [[Hemline index|hemline]]s). [[Edward Stringham]] also noted that the uses of practices such as short selling continued to occur during this time despite the government passing laws against it. This is unusual because it shows individual parties fulfilling contracts that were not legally enforceable and where the parties involved could incur a loss. Stringham argues that this shows that contracts can be created and enforced without state sanction or, in this case, in spite of laws to the contrary.<ref>{{cite journal|ssrn=1676253 |title=The Origin of the London Stock Exchange as a Self Policing Club |last=Stringham |first= Edward |year=2002 |journal=Journal of Private Enterprise |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=1\u201319}}</ref><ref>\"Devil the Hindmost\" by Edward Chancellor.</ref>\n\n==Shareholder==\n[[File:B&O RR common stock.jpg|thumb|[[Stock certificate]] for ten shares of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company]]]]\n{{Main|Shareholder}}\n\nA '''shareholder''' (or ''stockholder'') is an [[individual]] or [[company (law)|company]] (including a [[corporation]]) that legally owns one or more [[share (finance)|shares]] of stock in a [[joint stock company]]. Both private and public traded companies have shareholders.\n\nShareholders are granted special privileges depending on the class of stock, including the right to vote on matters such as elections to the [[board of directors]], the right to share in distributions of the company's income, the right to purchase new shares issued by the company, and the right to a company's assets during a [[liquidation]] of the company. However, shareholder's rights to a company's assets are subordinate to the rights of the company's creditors.\n\nShareholders are one type of [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], who may include anyone who has a direct or indirect equity interest in the [[business entity]] or someone with a non-equity interest in a [[non-profit organization]]. Thus it might be common to call [[Volunteering|volunteer]] contributors to an [[Voluntary association|association]] stakeholders, even though they are not shareholders.\n\nAlthough directors and officers of a company are bound by [[fiduciary]] duties to act in the best interest of the shareholders, the shareholders themselves normally do not have such duties towards each other.\n\nHowever, in a few unusual cases, some courts have been willing to imply such a duty between shareholders. For example, in [[California]], [[United States|USA]], majority shareholders of [[Closely held corporation|closely held]] corporations have a duty not to destroy the value of the shares held by minority shareholders.<ref>''Jones v. H. F. Ahmanson & Co.'', 1 Cal. 3d)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/1C3d93.htm |title=Jones v. H.F. Ahmanson & Co. (1969) 1 C3d 93 |publisher=Online.ceb.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref>\n\nThe largest shareholders (in terms of percentages of companies owned) are often mutual funds, and, especially, passively managed [[exchange-traded fund]]s.\n\n==Application==\nThe owners of a private company may want additional capital to invest in new projects within the company. They may also simply wish to reduce their holding, freeing up capital for their own private use. They can achieve these goals by selling shares in the company to the general public, through a sale on a [[stock exchange]].  This process is called an [[initial public offering]], or IPO.\n\nBy selling shares they can sell part or all of the company to many part-owners. The purchase of one share entitles the owner of that share to literally share in the ownership of the company, a fraction of the decision-making power, and potentially a fraction of the profits, which the company may issue as [[dividend]]s. The owner may also inherit [[debt]] and even [[litigation]].\n\nIn the common case of a publicly traded corporation, where there may be thousands of shareholders, it is impractical to have all of them making the daily decisions required to run a company. Thus, the shareholders will use their shares as votes in the election of members of the [[board of directors]] of the company.\n\nIn a typical case, each share constitutes one vote. Corporations may, however, issue different classes of shares, which may have different voting rights. Owning the majority of the shares allows other shareholders to be out-voted \u2013 effective control rests with the majority shareholder (or shareholders acting in concert). In this way the original owners of the company often still have control of the company.\n\n===Shareholder rights===\nAlthough ownership of 50% of shares does result in 50% ownership of a company, it does not give the shareholder the right to use a company's building, equipment, materials, or other property. This is because the company is considered a legal person, thus it owns all its assets itself. This is important in areas such as insurance, which must be in the name of the company and not the main shareholder.\n\nIn most countries, [[board of directors|boards of directors]] and company [[managers]] have a [[fiduciary]] responsibility to run the company in the interests of its stockholders. Nonetheless, as [[Martin J. Whitman|Martin Whitman]] writes:\n:...it can safely be stated that there does not exist any publicly traded company where management works exclusively in the best interests of OPMI [Outside Passive Minority Investor] stockholders. Instead, there are both \"communities of interest\" and \"conflicts of interest\" between stockholders (principal) and management (agent). This conflict is referred to as the [[principal\u2013agent problem]]. It would be naive to think that any management would forego management compensation, and [[management entrenchment]], just because some of these management privileges might be perceived as giving rise to a conflict of interest with OPMIs.<ref>Whitman, 2004, 5</ref>\n\nEven though the board of directors runs the company, the shareholder has some impact on the company's policy, as the shareholders elect the board of directors. Each shareholder typically has a percentage of votes equal to the percentage of shares he or she owns. So as long as the shareholders agree that the management (agent) are performing poorly they can select a new board of directors which can then hire a new management team. In practice, however, genuinely contested board elections are rare. Board candidates are usually nominated by insiders or by the board of the directors themselves, and a considerable amount of stock is held or voted by insiders.\n\nOwning shares does not mean responsibility for liabilities. If a company goes broke and has to default on loans, the shareholders are not liable in any way. However, all money obtained by converting assets into cash will be used to repay loans and other debts first, so that shareholders cannot receive any money unless and until creditors have been paid (often the shareholders end up with nothing).<ref>{{cite book | last = Jackson | first = Thomas | title = The Logic and Limits of Bankruptcy Law | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford Oxfordshire | year = 2001 | isbn = 1-58798-114-9 | page = 32}}</ref>\n\n===Means of financing===\nFinancing a company through the sale of stock in a company is known as [[Ownership equity|equity]] financing. Alternatively, [[debt]] financing (for example issuing [[bond (finance)|bonds]]) can be done to avoid giving up shares of ownership of the company. Unofficial financing known as [[trade financing]] usually provides the major part of a company's [[working capital]] (day-to-day operational needs).\n\n==Trading==\n{{main|Stock trader}}\n[[File:Stockbroker.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|A stockbroker using multiple screens to stay up to date on trading]]\nIn general, the shares of a company may be transferred from shareholders to other parties by sale or other mechanisms, unless prohibited. Most jurisdictions have established laws and regulations governing such transfers, particularly if the issuer is a publicly traded entity.\n\nThe desire of stockholders to trade their shares has led to the establishment of [[stock exchange]]s, organizations which provide marketplaces for trading [[shares]] and other derivatives and financial products. Today, [[stock trader]]s are usually represented by a [[stockbroker]] who buys and sells shares of a wide range of companies on such exchanges. A company may list its shares on an exchange by meeting and maintaining the [[Stock exchange#Listing requirements|listing requirements]] of a particular stock exchange. In the United States, through the intermarket trading system, stocks listed on one exchange can often also be traded on other participating exchanges, including [[electronic communication network]]s (ECNs), such as [[Archipelago]] or [[Instinet]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shareworld.co.uk/index.php/articles/stock-trading/|title=Stock Trading|publisher=ShareWorld|accessdate=24 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nMany large non-U.S companies choose to list on a U.S. exchange as well as an exchange in their home country in order to broaden their investor base. These companies must maintain a block of shares at a bank in the US, typically a certain percentage of their capital. On this basis, the holding bank establishes American depositary shares and issues an [[American depositary receipt]] (ADR) for each share a trader acquires. Likewise, many large U.S. companies list their shares at foreign exchanges to raise capital abroad.\n\nSmall companies that do not qualify and cannot meet the listing requirements of the major exchanges may be traded [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] (OTC) by an off-exchange mechanism in which trading occurs directly between parties. The major OTC markets in the United States are the electronic quotation systems [[OTC Bulletin Board]] (OTCBB) and [[OTC Markets Group]] (formerly known as Pink OTC Markets Inc.)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/answers/pink.htm|title=Stock Trading|publisher=US Securities and Exchange Commission|accessdate=18 May 2013}}</ref> where individual retail investors are also represented by a [[brokerage firm]] and the quotation service's requirements for a company to be listed are minimal. Shares of companies in bankruptcy proceedings are usually listed by these quotation services after the stock is delisted from an exchange.\n\n===Buying===\nThere are various methods of buying and [[financing]] stocks, the most common being through a [[stockbroker]]. Brokerage firms, whether they are a full-service or [[discounts and allowances|discount]] broker, arrange the transfer of stock from a seller to a buyer. Most trades are actually done through brokers listed with a stock exchange.\n\nThere are many different brokerage firms from which to choose, such as full service brokers or discount brokers. The full service brokers usually charge more per trade, but give investment advice or more personal service; the discount brokers offer little or no investment advice but charge less for trades. Another type of broker would be a [[bank]] or [[credit union]] that may have a deal set up with either a full-service or discount broker.\n\nThere are other ways of buying stock besides through a broker. One way is directly from the company itself. If at least one share is owned, most companies will allow the purchase of shares directly from the company through their [[investor relations]] departments. However, the initial share of stock in the company will have to be obtained through a regular stock broker. Another way to buy stock in companies is through Direct Public Offerings which are usually sold by the company itself. A direct public offering is an [[initial public offering]] in which the stock is purchased directly from the company, usually without the aid of brokers.\n\nWhen it comes to [[financing]] a purchase of stocks there are two ways: purchasing stock with money that is currently in the buyer's ownership, or by buying stock on [[margin (finance)#Margin buying|margin]]. Buying stock on [[margin (finance)#Margin buying|margin]] means buying stock with money borrowed against the value of stocks in the same account. These stocks, or [[collateral (finance)|collateral]], guarantee that the buyer can repay the [[loan]]; otherwise, the stockbroker has the right to sell the stock (collateral) to repay the borrowed money. He can sell if the [[share price]] drops below the [[margin (finance)#Minimum margin requirement|margin requirement]], at least 50% of the value of the stocks in the account. Buying on margin works the same way as borrowing money to buy a car or a house, using a car or house as collateral. Moreover, borrowing is not free; the broker usually charges 8\u201310% interest.\n\n===Selling===\nSelling stock is procedurally similar to buying stock. Generally, the investor wants to buy low and sell high, if not in that order ([[short selling]]); although a number of reasons may induce an investor to sell at a loss, e.g., to avoid further loss.\n\nAs with buying a stock, there is a transaction fee for the broker's efforts in arranging the transfer of stock from a seller to a buyer. This fee can be high or low depending on which type of brokerage, full service or discount, handles the transaction.\n\nAfter the transaction has been made, the seller is then entitled to all of the money. An important part of selling is keeping track of the earnings. Importantly, on selling the stock, in jurisdictions that have them, [[capital gains tax]]es will have to be paid on the additional proceeds, if any, that are in excess of the cost basis.\n\n===Stock price fluctuations===\nThe price of a stock fluctuates fundamentally due to the theory of [[supply and demand]]. Like all commodities in the market, the price of a stock is sensitive to demand. However, there are many factors that influence the demand for a particular stock. The fields of [[fundamental analysis]] and [[technical analysis]] attempt to understand market conditions that lead to price changes, or even predict future price levels. A recent study shows that customer satisfaction, as measured by the [[American Customer Satisfaction Index]] (ACSI), is significantly correlated to the market value of a stock.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/research/ras/spring2006/2.html|title=Increased Customer Satisfaction Increases Stock Price|last=Mithas|first=Sunil|date=January 2006|work=Research@Smith|publisher=University of Maryland|accessdate=25 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317033602/http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/research/ras/spring2006/2.html|archive-date=17 March 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Stock price may be influenced by analysts' business forecast for the company and outlooks for the company's general market segment.  Stocks can also fluctuate greatly due to [[pump and dump]] scams.\n\n===Share price determination===\nAt any given moment, an equity's price is strictly a result of supply and demand. The supply, commonly referred to as the ''[[Public float|float]]'', is the number of shares offered for sale at any one moment. The demand is the number of shares investors wish to buy at exactly that same time. The price of the stock moves in order to achieve and maintain [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]]. The product of this instantaneous price and the float at any one time is the [[market capitalization]] of the entity offering the equity at that point in time.\n\nWhen prospective buyers outnumber sellers, the price rises. Eventually, sellers attracted to the high selling price enter the market and/or buyers leave, achieving equilibrium between buyers and sellers. When sellers outnumber buyers, the price falls. Eventually buyers enter and/or sellers leave, again achieving equilibrium.\n\nThus, the value of a share of a company at any given moment is determined by all investors voting with their money. If more investors want a stock and are willing to pay more, the price will go up. If more investors are selling a stock and there aren't enough buyers, the price will go down.\n* Note: \"For [[Nasdaq]]-listed stocks, the price quote includes information on the bid and ask prices for the stock.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youngmoney.com/investing/sharebuilder/goals/031021_08 |title=Understanding Stock Prices: Bid, Ask, Spread |publisher=Youngmoney.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref>\n\nThat does not explain how people decide the maximum price at which they are willing to buy or the minimum at which they are willing to sell. In professional investment circles the [[efficient market hypothesis]] (EMH) continues to be popular, although this theory is widely discredited in academic and professional circles.  Briefly, EMH says that investing is overall (weighted by the [[standard deviation]]) rational; that the price of a stock at any given moment represents a rational evaluation of the known information that might bear on the future value of the company; and that share prices of equities are priced ''efficiently'', which is to say that they represent accurately the [[expected value]] of the stock, as best it can be known at a given moment. In other words, prices are the result of discounting expected future cash flows.\n\nThe EMH model, if true, has at least two interesting consequences. First, because financial [[risk (financial)|risk]] is presumed to require at least a small premium on expected value, the [[return on equity]] can be expected to be slightly greater than that available from non-equity investments: if not, the same rational calculations would lead equity investors to shift to these safer non-equity investments that could be expected to give the same or better return at lower risk. Second, because the price of a share at every given moment is an \"efficient\" reflection of expected value, then\u2014relative to the curve of expected return\u2014prices will tend to follow a [[random walk]], determined by the emergence of information (randomly) over time. Professional equity investors therefore immerse themselves in the flow of fundamental information, seeking to gain an advantage over their competitors (mainly other professional investors) by more intelligently interpreting the emerging flow of information (news).\n\nThe EMH model does not seem to give a complete description of the process of equity price determination. For example, stock markets are more volatile than EMH would imply. In recent years it has come to be accepted that the share markets are not perfectly efficient, perhaps especially in emerging markets or other markets that are not dominated by well-informed professional investors.\n\nAnother theory of share price determination comes from the field of [[Behavioral Finance]]. According to Behavioral Finance, humans often make irrational decisions\u2014particularly, related to the buying and selling of securities\u2014based upon fears and misperceptions of outcomes. The irrational trading of securities can often create securities prices which vary from rational, fundamental price valuations.  For instance, during the technology bubble of the late 1990s (which was followed by the [[dot-com bust]] of 2000\u20132002), technology companies were often bid beyond any rational fundamental value because of what is commonly known as the \"[[greater fool theory]]\".  The \"greater fool theory\" holds that, because the predominant method of realizing returns in equity is from the sale to another investor, one should select securities that they believe that someone else will value at a higher level at some point in the future, without regard to the basis for that other party's willingness to pay a higher price.\nThus, even a rational investor may bank on others' irrationality.\n\n===Arbitrage trading===\nWhen companies raise capital by offering stock on more than one exchange, the potential exists for discrepancies in the valuation of shares on different exchanges.  A keen investor with access to information about such discrepancies may invest in expectation of their eventual convergence, known as [[arbitrage]] trading. [[Electronic trading]] has resulted in extensive price transparency ([[efficient-market hypothesis]]) and these discrepancies, if they exist, are short-lived and quickly equilibrated.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Arrangements between railroads]]\n* [[Boiler room (business)|Boiler room]]\n* [[Bucket shop (stock market)|Bucket shop]]\n* [[Buying in (securities)]]\n* [[Concentrated stock]]\n* [[Equity investment]]\n* [[Global Industry Classification Standard|GICS]]\n* [[Golden share]]\n* [[House stock]]\n* [[Insider trading]]\n* [[:Category:Money managers|Money managers]]\n* [[Naked short selling]]\n* [[Penny stock]]\n* [[Scripophily]]\n* [[Stock and flow]]\n* [[Stock dilution]]\n* [[Stock valuation]]\n* [[Stub (stock)]]\n* [[Tracking stock]]\n* [[Treasury stock]]\n* Traditional and alternative [[investment]]s\n* [[Voting interest]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Stocks}}\n* {{dmoz|Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds/Exchanges/|Stock exchanges}}\n* {{dmoz|Home/Personal_Finance/Investing/Stocks/|Stocks investing}}\n*[https://stockmarketo.blogspot.com/ stock market]\n<!--========================({{No More Links}})============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

This typically entitles the [[stockholder]] to that fraction of the company's earnings, proceeds from liquidation of assets (after discharge of all [[Seniority (financial)|senior claims]] such as secured and unsecured [[debt]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp|title=stock Definition|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=25 February 2012}}</ref> or voting power, often dividing these up in proportion to the amount of money each stockholder has invested.  Not all stock is necessarily equal, as certain classes of stock may be issued for example without voting rights, with enhanced voting rights, or with a certain priority to receive profits or liquidation proceeds before or after other classes of shareholders.\n\nStock can be bought and sold privately or on [[stock exchange]]s, and such transactions are typically heavily regulated by governments to prevent fraud, protect investors, and benefit the larger economy. The stocks are deposited with the depositories in the electronic format also known as Demat account. As [[Equity issuance|new shares are issued]] by a company, the ownership and rights of existing shareholders are diluted in return for cash to sustain or grow the business. Companies can also [[Share repurchase|buy back stock]], which often lets investors recoup the initial investment plus [[capital gains]] from subsequent rises in stock price.  [[Stock options]], issued by many companies as part of employee compensation, do not represent ownership, but represent the right to buy ownership at a future time at a specified price.  This would represent a windfall to the employees if the option is exercised when the market price is higher than the promised price, since if they immediately sold the stock they would keep the difference (minus taxes).\n\n==Shares==\nA person who owns a  percentage of the stock has the ownership of the corporation proportional to his share. The shares  form stock. The stock of a corporation is partitioned into [[share (finance)|shares]], the total of which are stated at the time of business formation.  Additional shares may subsequently be authorized by the existing shareholders and issued by the company.  In some jurisdictions, each share of stock has a certain declared [[par value]], which is a nominal accounting value used to represent the equity on the [[balance sheet]] of the corporation. In other jurisdictions, however, shares of stock may be issued without associated par value.\n\nShares represent a fraction of [[ownership]] in a business. A [[business]] may declare different types (or classes) of shares, each having distinctive ownership rules, privileges, or share values.  Ownership of shares may be documented by issuance of a [[stock certificate]].  A stock certificate is a legal document that specifies the number of shares owned by the [[shareholder]], and other specifics of the shares, such as the par value, if any, or the class of the shares.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland]], [[South Africa]], and [[Australia]], ''stock'' can also refer to completely different [[financial instruments]] such as government [[bond (finance)|bonds]] or, less commonly, to all kinds of [[marketable securities]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=78290&dict=CALD |title=Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary |publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\nStock typically takes the form of shares of either [[common stock]] or [[preferred stock]].  As a unit of ownership, common stock typically carries [[voting rights]] that can be exercised in corporate decisions. [[Preferred stock]] differs from common stock in that it typically does not carry voting rights but is legally entitled to receive a certain level of [[dividend]] payments before any dividends can be issued to other shareholders.<ref name=\"investor guide\">{{cite web|url=http://www.investorguide.com/igu-article-818-stock-basics-common-and-preferred-stock.html|title=Common Stock vs. Preferred Stock, and Stock Classes|work=InvestorGuide.com}}</ref><ref name = \"investments\">Zvi Bodie, Alex Kane, Alan J. Marcus, ''Investments'', 9th Ed., {{ISBN|978-0078034695}}.</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2013}}  Convertible preferred stock is preferred stock that includes an [[option (finance)|option]] for the holder to convert the preferred shares into a fixed number of common shares, usually any time after a predetermined date. Shares of such stock are called \"convertible preferred shares\" (or \"convertible preference shares\" in the UK).\n\nNew [[Equity (finance)|equity]] issue may have specific legal clauses attached that differentiate them from previous issues of the issuer. Some shares of common stock may be issued without the typical voting rights, for instance, or some shares may have special rights unique to them and issued only to certain parties. Often, new issues that have not been registered with a securities governing body may be [[restricted stock|restricted]] from resale for certain periods of time.\n\nPreferred stock may be [[Hybrid Investment|hybrid]] by having the qualities of bonds of fixed returns and common stock voting rights. They also have preference in the payment of dividends over common stock and also have been given preference at the time of liquidation over common stock. They have other features of accumulation in dividend. In addition, preferred stock usually comes with a letter designation at the end of the security; for example, Berkshire-Hathaway [[Class B share|Class \"B\" shares]] sell under stock ticker BRK.B, whereas [[Class A share|Class \"A\" shares]] of ORION DHC, Inc will sell under ticker OODHA until the company drops the \"A\" creating ticker OODH for its \"Common\" shares only designation. This extra letter does not mean that any exclusive rights exist for the shareholders but it does let investors know that the shares are considered for such, however, these rights or privileges may change based on the decisions made by the underlying company.\n\n===Rule 144 stock===\n\"[[Securities Act of 1933#Rule 144|Rule 144]] Stock\" is an American term given to shares of stock subject to SEC Rule 144: Selling Restricted and Control Securities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/rule144.htm|title=Rule 144: Selling Restricted and Control Securities|publisher=US Securities and Exchange Commission|accessdate=18 May 2013}}</ref> Under Rule 144, restricted and controlled securities are acquired in unregistered form.  Investors either purchase or take ownership of these securities through  private sales (or other means such as via ESOPs or in exchange for seed money) from the issuing company (as in the case with Restricted Securities) or from an affiliate of the issuer (as in the case with Control Securities). Investors wishing to sell these securities are subject to different rules than those selling traditional common or preferred stock.  These individuals will only be allowed to liquidate their securities after meeting the specific conditions set forth by SEC Rule 144. Rule 144 allows public re-sale of restricted securities if a number of different conditions are met.\n\n==Stock derivatives==\n{{details|equity derivative}}\n\nA stock [[derivative (finance)|derivative]] is any financial instrument for which the [[underlying]] asset is the price of an equity. [[Futures contract|Futures]] and [[option (finance)|options]] are the main types of derivatives on stocks. The underlying security may be a [[stock index]] or an individual firm's stock, e.g. [[single-stock futures]].\n\nStock futures are contracts where the buyer is [[long (finance)|long]], i.e., takes on the obligation to buy on the contract maturity date, and the seller is [[short (finance)|short]], i.e., takes on the obligation to sell. [[Equity derivative#Stock Index Futures|Stock index futures]] are generally delivered by cash settlement.\n\nA [[stock option]] is a class of option. Specifically, a [[call option]] is the right (''not'' obligation) to buy stock in the future at a fixed price and a [[put option]] is the right (''not'' obligation) to sell stock in the future at a fixed price. Thus, the value of a stock option changes in reaction to the underlying stock of which it is a [[derivative (finance)|derivative]]. The most popular method of valuing stock options is the [[Black\u2013Scholes model]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tradingtoday.com/black-scholes |title=Black Scholes Calculator |publisher=Tradingtoday.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref> Apart from [[employee stock option|call options granted to employees]], most stock options are transferable.\n\n==History==\n[[File:VOC aandeel 9 september 1606.jpg|thumb|One of the earliest stock by the [[Dutch East India Company]]]]\nDuring the Roman Republic, the state contracted (leased) out many of its services to private companies. These government contractors were called ''publicani'', or ''societas publicanorum'' as individual companies.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]]''</ref> These companies were similar to modern corporations, or [[joint-stock companies]] more specifically, in a couple of aspects. They issued shares called ''partes'' (for large cooperatives) and ''particulae'' which were small shares that acted like today's over-the-counter shares.<ref>(Cic. pro Rabir. Post. 2; Val. Max.

Between 1602 and 1796 it traded 2.5 million tons of cargo with Asia on 4,785 ships and sent a million Europeans to work in Asia, surpassing all other rivals.\n\nThe innovation of joint ownership made a great deal of [[Europe]]'s [[economic growth]] possible following the [[Middle Ages]]. The technique of pooling capital to finance the building of ships, for example, made the [[Netherlands]] a [[Shipping|maritime]] [[superpower]]. Before the adoption of the joint-stock corporation, an expensive venture such as the building of a merchant ship could be undertaken only by governments or by very wealthy individuals or families.\n\nEconomic historians{{Who|date=May 2016}} find the Dutch stock market of the 17th century particularly interesting: there is clear documentation of the use of stock futures, [[stock options]], [[short selling]], the use of credit to purchase shares, a speculative bubble that crashed in 1695, and a change in fashion that unfolded and reverted in time with the market (in this case it was headdresses instead of [[Hemline index|hemline]]s). [[Edward Stringham]] also noted that the uses of practices such as short selling continued to occur during this time despite the government passing laws against it. This is unusual because it shows individual parties fulfilling contracts that were not legally enforceable and where the parties involved could incur a loss. Stringham argues that this shows that contracts can be created and enforced without state sanction or, in this case, in spite of laws to the contrary.<ref>{{cite journal|ssrn=1676253 |title=The Origin of the London Stock Exchange as a Self Policing Club |last=Stringham |first= Edward |year=2002 |journal=Journal of Private Enterprise |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=1\u201319}}</ref><ref>\"Devil the Hindmost\" by Edward Chancellor.</ref>\n\n==Shareholder==\n[[File:B&O RR common stock.jpg|thumb|[[Stock certificate]] for ten shares of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company]]]]\n{{Main|Shareholder}}\n\nA '''shareholder''' (or ''stockholder'') is an [[individual]] or [[company (law)|company]] (including a [[corporation]]) that legally owns one or more [[share (finance)|shares]] of stock in a [[joint stock company]]. Both private and public traded companies have shareholders.\n\nShareholders are granted special privileges depending on the class of stock, including the right to vote on matters such as elections to the [[board of directors]], the right to share in distributions of the company's income, the right to purchase new shares issued by the company, and the right to a company's assets during a [[liquidation]] of the company. However, shareholder's rights to a company's assets are subordinate to the rights of the company's creditors.\n\nShareholders are one type of [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], who may include anyone who has a direct or indirect equity interest in the [[business entity]] or someone with a non-equity interest in a [[non-profit organization]]. Thus it might be common to call [[Volunteering|volunteer]] contributors to an [[Voluntary association|association]] stakeholders, even though they are not shareholders.\n\nAlthough directors and officers of a company are bound by [[fiduciary]] duties to act in the best interest of the shareholders, the shareholders themselves normally do not have such duties towards each other.\n\nHowever, in a few unusual cases, some courts have been willing to imply such a duty between shareholders. For example, in [[California]], [[United States|USA]], majority shareholders of [[Closely held corporation|closely held]] corporations have a duty not to destroy the value of the shares held by minority shareholders.<ref>''Jones v. H. F. Ahmanson & Co.'', 1 Cal. 3d)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/1C3d93.htm |title=Jones v. H.F. Ahmanson & Co. (1969) 1 C3d 93 |publisher=Online.ceb.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref>\n\nThe largest shareholders (in terms of percentages of companies owned) are often mutual funds, and, especially, passively managed [[exchange-traded fund]]s.\n\n==Application==\nThe owners of a private company may want additional capital to invest in new projects within the company. They may also simply wish to reduce their holding, freeing up capital for their own private use. They can achieve these goals by selling shares in the company to the general public, through a sale on a [[stock exchange]].  This process is called an [[initial public offering]], or IPO.\n\nBy selling shares they can sell part or all of the company to many part-owners. The purchase of one share entitles the owner of that share to literally share in the ownership of the company, a fraction of the decision-making power, and potentially a fraction of the profits, which the company may issue as [[dividend]]s. The owner may also inherit [[debt]] and even [[litigation]].\n\nIn the common case of a publicly traded corporation, where there may be thousands of shareholders, it is impractical to have all of them making the daily decisions required to run a company. Thus, the shareholders will use their shares as votes in the election of members of the [[board of directors]] of the company.\n\nIn a typical case, each share constitutes one vote. Corporations may, however, issue different classes of shares, which may have different voting rights. Owning the majority of the shares allows other shareholders to be out-voted \u2013 effective control rests with the majority shareholder (or shareholders acting in concert). In this way the original owners of the company often still have control of the company.\n\n===Shareholder rights===\nAlthough ownership of 50% of shares does result in 50% ownership of a company, it does not give the shareholder the right to use a company's building, equipment, materials, or other property. This is because the company is considered a legal person, thus it owns all its assets itself. This is important in areas such as insurance, which must be in the name of the company and not the main shareholder.\n\nIn most countries, [[board of directors|boards of directors]] and company [[managers]] have a [[fiduciary]] responsibility to run the company in the interests of its stockholders. Nonetheless, as [[Martin J. Whitman|Martin Whitman]] writes:\n:...it can safely be stated that there does not exist any publicly traded company where management works exclusively in the best interests of OPMI [Outside Passive Minority Investor] stockholders. Instead, there are both \"communities of interest\" and \"conflicts of interest\" between stockholders (principal) and management (agent). This conflict is referred to as the [[principal\u2013agent problem]]. It would be naive to think that any management would forego management compensation, and [[management entrenchment]], just because some of these management privileges might be perceived as giving rise to a conflict of interest with OPMIs.<ref>Whitman, 2004, 5</ref>\n\nEven though the board of directors runs the company, the shareholder has some impact on the company's policy, as the shareholders elect the board of directors. Each shareholder typically has a percentage of votes equal to the percentage of shares he or she owns. So as long as the shareholders agree that the management (agent) are performing poorly they can select a new board of directors which can then hire a new management team. In practice, however, genuinely contested board elections are rare. Board candidates are usually nominated by insiders or by the board of the directors themselves, and a considerable amount of stock is held or voted by insiders.\n\nOwning shares does not mean responsibility for liabilities. If a company goes broke and has to default on loans, the shareholders are not liable in any way. However, all money obtained by converting assets into cash will be used to repay loans and other debts first, so that shareholders cannot receive any money unless and until creditors have been paid (often the shareholders end up with nothing).<ref>{{cite book | last = Jackson | first = Thomas | title = The Logic and Limits of Bankruptcy Law | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford Oxfordshire | year = 2001 | isbn = 1-58798-114-9 | page = 32}}</ref>\n\n===Means of financing===\nFinancing a company through the sale of stock in a company is known as [[Ownership equity|equity]] financing. Alternatively, [[debt]] financing (for example issuing [[bond (finance)|bonds]]) can be done to avoid giving up shares of ownership of the company. Unofficial financing known as [[trade financing]] usually provides the major part of a company's [[working capital]] (day-to-day operational needs).\n\n==Trading==\n{{main|Stock trader}}\n[[File:Stockbroker.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|A stockbroker using multiple screens to stay up to date on trading]]\nIn general, the shares of a company may be transferred from shareholders to other parties by sale or other mechanisms, unless prohibited. Most jurisdictions have established laws and regulations governing such transfers, particularly if the issuer is a publicly traded entity.\n\nThe desire of stockholders to trade their shares has led to the establishment of [[stock exchange]]s, organizations which provide marketplaces for trading [[shares]] and other derivatives and financial products. Today, [[stock trader]]s are usually represented by a [[stockbroker]] who buys and sells shares of a wide range of companies on such exchanges. A company may list its shares on an exchange by meeting and maintaining the [[Stock exchange#Listing requirements|listing requirements]] of a particular stock exchange. In the United States, through the intermarket trading system, stocks listed on one exchange can often also be traded on other participating exchanges, including [[electronic communication network]]s (ECNs), such as [[Archipelago]] or [[Instinet]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shareworld.co.uk/index.php/articles/stock-trading/|title=Stock Trading|publisher=ShareWorld|accessdate=24 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nMany large non-U.S companies choose to list on a U.S. exchange as well as an exchange in their home country in order to broaden their investor base. These companies must maintain a block of shares at a bank in the US, typically a certain percentage of their capital. On this basis, the holding bank establishes American depositary shares and issues an [[American depositary receipt]] (ADR) for each share a trader acquires. Likewise, many large U.S. companies list their shares at foreign exchanges to raise capital abroad.\n\nSmall companies that do not qualify and cannot meet the listing requirements of the major exchanges may be traded [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] (OTC) by an off-exchange mechanism in which trading occurs directly between parties. The major OTC markets in the United States are the electronic quotation systems [[OTC Bulletin Board]] (OTCBB) and [[OTC Markets Group]] (formerly known as Pink OTC Markets Inc.)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/answers/pink.htm|title=Stock Trading|publisher=US Securities and Exchange Commission|accessdate=18 May 2013}}</ref> where individual retail investors are also represented by a [[brokerage firm]] and the quotation service's requirements for a company to be listed are minimal. Shares of companies in bankruptcy proceedings are usually listed by these quotation services after the stock is delisted from an exchange.\n\n===Buying===\nThere are various methods of buying and [[financing]] stocks, the most common being through a [[stockbroker]]. Brokerage firms, whether they are a full-service or [[discounts and allowances|discount]] broker, arrange the transfer of stock from a seller to a buyer. Most trades are actually done through brokers listed with a stock exchange.\n\nThere are many different brokerage firms from which to choose, such as full service brokers or discount brokers. The full service brokers usually charge more per trade, but give investment advice or more personal service; the discount brokers offer little or no investment advice but charge less for trades. Another type of broker would be a [[bank]] or [[credit union]] that may have a deal set up with either a full-service or discount broker.\n\nThere are other ways of buying stock besides through a broker. One way is directly from the company itself. If at least one share is owned, most companies will allow the purchase of shares directly from the company through their [[investor relations]] departments. However, the initial share of stock in the company will have to be obtained through a regular stock broker. Another way to buy stock in companies is through Direct Public Offerings which are usually sold by the company itself. A direct public offering is an [[initial public offering]] in which the stock is purchased directly from the company, usually without the aid of brokers.\n\nWhen it comes to [[financing]] a purchase of stocks there are two ways: purchasing stock with money that is currently in the buyer's ownership, or by buying stock on [[margin (finance)#Margin buying|margin]]. Buying stock on [[margin (finance)#Margin buying|margin]] means buying stock with money borrowed against the value of stocks in the same account. These stocks, or [[collateral (finance)|collateral]], guarantee that the buyer can repay the [[loan]]; otherwise, the stockbroker has the right to sell the stock (collateral) to repay the borrowed money. He can sell if the [[share price]] drops below the [[margin (finance)#Minimum margin requirement|margin requirement]], at least 50% of the value of the stocks in the account. Buying on margin works the same way as borrowing money to buy a car or a house, using a car or house as collateral. Moreover, borrowing is not free; the broker usually charges 8\u201310% interest.\n\n===Selling===\nSelling stock is procedurally similar to buying stock. Generally, the investor wants to buy low and sell high, if not in that order ([[short selling]]); although a number of reasons may induce an investor to sell at a loss, e.g., to avoid further loss.\n\nAs with buying a stock, there is a transaction fee for the broker's efforts in arranging the transfer of stock from a seller to a buyer. This fee can be high or low depending on which type of brokerage, full service or discount, handles the transaction.\n\nAfter the transaction has been made, the seller is then entitled to all of the money. An important part of selling is keeping track of the earnings. Importantly, on selling the stock, in jurisdictions that have them, [[capital gains tax]]es will have to be paid on the additional proceeds, if any, that are in excess of the cost basis.\n\n===Stock price fluctuations===\nThe price of a stock fluctuates fundamentally due to the theory of [[supply and demand]]. Like all commodities in the market, the price of a stock is sensitive to demand. However, there are many factors that influence the demand for a particular stock. The fields of [[fundamental analysis]] and [[technical analysis]] attempt to understand market conditions that lead to price changes, or even predict future price levels. A recent study shows that customer satisfaction, as measured by the [[American Customer Satisfaction Index]] (ACSI), is significantly correlated to the market value of a stock.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/research/ras/spring2006/2.html|title=Increased Customer Satisfaction Increases Stock Price|last=Mithas|first=Sunil|date=January 2006|work=Research@Smith|publisher=University of Maryland|accessdate=25 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317033602/http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/research/ras/spring2006/2.html|archive-date=17 March 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Stock price may be influenced by analysts' business forecast for the company and outlooks for the company's general market segment.  Stocks can also fluctuate greatly due to [[pump and dump]] scams.\n\n===Share price determination===\nAt any given moment, an equity's price is strictly a result of supply and demand. The supply, commonly referred to as the ''[[Public float|float]]'', is the number of shares offered for sale at any one moment. The demand is the number of shares investors wish to buy at exactly that same time. The price of the stock moves in order to achieve and maintain [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]]. The product of this instantaneous price and the float at any one time is the [[market capitalization]] of the entity offering the equity at that point in time.\n\nWhen prospective buyers outnumber sellers, the price rises. Eventually, sellers attracted to the high selling price enter the market and/or buyers leave, achieving equilibrium between buyers and sellers. When sellers outnumber buyers, the price falls. Eventually buyers enter and/or sellers leave, again achieving equilibrium.\n\nThus, the value of a share of a company at any given moment is determined by all investors voting with their money. If more investors want a stock and are willing to pay more, the price will go up. If more investors are selling a stock and there aren't enough buyers, the price will go down.\n* Note: \"For [[Nasdaq]]-listed stocks, the price quote includes information on the bid and ask prices for the stock.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youngmoney.com/investing/sharebuilder/goals/031021_08 |title=Understanding Stock Prices: Bid, Ask, Spread |publisher=Youngmoney.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref>\n\nThat does not explain how people decide the maximum price at which they are willing to buy or the minimum at which they are willing to sell. In professional investment circles the [[efficient market hypothesis]] (EMH) continues to be popular, although this theory is widely discredited in academic and professional circles.  Briefly, EMH says that investing is overall (weighted by the [[standard deviation]]) rational; that the price of a stock at any given moment represents a rational evaluation of the known information that might bear on the future value of the company; and that share prices of equities are priced ''efficiently'', which is to say that they represent accurately the [[expected value]] of the stock, as best it can be known at a given moment. In other words, prices are the result of discounting expected future cash flows.\n\nThe EMH model, if true, has at least two interesting consequences. First, because financial [[risk (financial)|risk]] is presumed to require at least a small premium on expected value, the [[return on equity]] can be expected to be slightly greater than that available from non-equity investments: if not, the same rational calculations would lead equity investors to shift to these safer non-equity investments that could be expected to give the same or better return at lower risk. Second, because the price of a share at every given moment is an \"efficient\" reflection of expected value, then\u2014relative to the curve of expected return\u2014prices will tend to follow a [[random walk]], determined by the emergence of information (randomly) over time. Professional equity investors therefore immerse themselves in the flow of fundamental information, seeking to gain an advantage over their competitors (mainly other professional investors) by more intelligently interpreting the emerging flow of information (news).\n\nThe EMH model does not seem to give a complete description of the process of equity price determination. For example, stock markets are more volatile than EMH would imply. In recent years it has come to be accepted that the share markets are not perfectly efficient, perhaps especially in emerging markets or other markets that are not dominated by well-informed professional investors.\n\nAnother theory of share price determination comes from the field of [[Behavioral Finance]]. According to Behavioral Finance, humans often make irrational decisions\u2014particularly, related to the buying and selling of securities\u2014based upon fears and misperceptions of outcomes. The irrational trading of securities can often create securities prices which vary from rational, fundamental price valuations.  For instance, during the technology bubble of the late 1990s (which was followed by the [[dot-com bust]] of 2000\u20132002), technology companies were often bid beyond any rational fundamental value because of what is commonly known as the \"[[greater fool theory]]\".  The \"greater fool theory\" holds that, because the predominant method of realizing returns in equity is from the sale to another investor, one should select securities that they believe that someone else will value at a higher level at some point in the future, without regard to the basis for that other party's willingness to pay a higher price.\nThus, even a rational investor may bank on others' irrationality.\n\n===Arbitrage trading===\nWhen companies raise capital by offering stock on more than one exchange, the potential exists for discrepancies in the valuation of shares on different exchanges.  A keen investor with access to information about such discrepancies may invest in expectation of their eventual convergence, known as [[arbitrage]] trading.

Arithmetic operations similar to those given above for the extended real numbers can also be defined, though there is no distinction in the signs (which leads to the one exception that infinity cannot be added to itself). On the other hand, this kind of infinity enables division by zero, namely <math>z/0 = \\infty</math> for any nonzero complex number&nbsp;''<math>z</math>''. In this context, it is often useful to consider [[meromorphic function]]s as maps into the Riemann sphere taking the value of <math>\\infty</math> at the poles. The domain of a complex-valued function may be extended to include the point at infinity as well. One important example of such functions is the group of [[M\u00f6bius transformation]]s (see [[M\u00f6bius transformation#Overview|M\u00f6bius transformation \u00a7 Overview]]).\n\n===Nonstandard analysis===\n[[File:N\u00fameros hiperreales.png|450px|thumb|Infinitesimals (\u03b5) and infinites (\u03c9) on the hyperreal number line (1/\u03b5 = \u03c9/1)]]\n\nThe original formulation of [[infinitesimal calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] used [[infinitesimal]] quantities. In the 20th century, it was shown that this treatment could be put on a rigorous footing through various [[logical system]]s, including [[smooth infinitesimal analysis]] and [[nonstandard analysis]]. In the latter, infinitesimals are invertible, and their inverses are infinite numbers. The infinities in this sense are part of a [[hyperreal number|hyperreal field]]; there is no equivalence between them as with the Cantorian [[transfinite number|transfinites]]. For example, if&nbsp;H is an infinite number in this sense, then H&nbsp;+&nbsp;H&nbsp;=&nbsp;2H and H&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 are distinct infinite numbers.

In this system, the first transfinite cardinal is [[aleph-null]] (<span style=\"font-family:'Cambria Math';\"><big>\u2135</big><sub>0</sub></span>), the cardinality of the set of [[natural number]]s. This modern mathematical conception of the quantitative infinite developed in the late 19th century from works by Cantor, [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Richard Dedekind]] and others\u2014using the idea of collections or sets.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nDedekind's approach was essentially to adopt the idea of [[one-to-one correspondence]] as a standard for comparing the size of sets, and to reject the view of Galileo (derived from [[Euclid]]) that the whole cannot be the same size as the part (however, see [[Galileo's paradox]] where he concludes that positive [[Square number|square integers]] are of the same size as positive integers). An infinite set can simply be defined as one having the same size as at least one of its [[proper subset|proper]] parts; this notion of infinity is called [[Dedekind infinite]]. The diagram to the right gives an example: viewing lines as infinite sets of points, the left half of the lower blue line can be mapped in a one-to-one manner (green correspondences) to the higher blue line, and, in turn, to the whole lower blue line (red correspondences); therefore the whole lower blue line and its left half have the same cardinality, i.e. \"size\".{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nCantor defined two kinds of infinite numbers: [[ordinal number]]s and [[cardinal number]]s. Ordinal numbers characterize [[well-ordered]] sets, or counting carried on to any stopping point, including points after an infinite number have already been counted. Generalizing finite and (ordinary) infinite [[sequence]]s which are maps from the positive [[integers]] leads to [[Function (mathematics)|mappings]] from ordinal numbers to transfinite sequences. Cardinal numbers define the size of sets, meaning how many members they contain, and can be standardized by choosing the first ordinal number of a certain size to represent the cardinal number of that size. The smallest ordinal infinity is that of the positive integers, and any set which has the cardinality of the integers is [[countable set|countably infinite]]. If a set is too large to be put in one-to-one correspondence with the positive integers, it is called ''[[Uncountable set|uncountable]]''. Cantor's views prevailed and modern mathematics accepts actual infinity as part of a consistent and coherent theory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://math.dartmouth.edu/~matc/Readers/HowManyAngels/InfinityMind/IM.html|title=Infinity|website=math.dartmouth.edu|access-date=2019-11-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|title=The Infinite\n|first1=A.W.\n|last1=Moore\n|publisher=Routledge\n|year=1991}}\n</ref>{{page needed|date=June 2014}}  Certain extended number systems, such as the hyperreal numbers, incorporate the ordinary (finite) numbers and infinite numbers of different sizes.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Cardinality of the continuum====\n{{Main|Cardinality of the continuum}}\n\nOne of Cantor's most important results was that the cardinality of the continuum <math>\\mathbf c</math> is greater than that of the natural numbers <math>{\\aleph_0}</math>; that is, there are more real numbers '''R''' than natural numbers '''N'''.

The question of being infinite is logically separate from the question of having boundaries. The two-dimensional surface of the Earth, for example, is finite, yet has no edge. By travelling in a straight line with respect to the Earth's curvature one will eventually return to the exact spot one started from.

Several techniques can be used for avoiding computing several times the same element of the sequence. One is [[lazy evaluation]]. Another one, available in [[Maple (software)|Maple]], consists of having routines with a remember option. This option consists of keeping in memory the results of the function that have been computed, and, at each call of the routine, looking if this particular result has been computed, for avoiding to compute it again. For example, the standard definition of the [[Fibonacci sequence]] is \n:Fib(''n'') == if ''n'' = 1 or ''n'' = 2 then 1 else Fib(''n'' - 1) + Fib(''n'' - 2).\nWith a standard implementation, an exponential number of function calls is needed for computing Fib(''n''), while, with the remember option, only {{nowrap|''n'' - 1}} function calls are needed.\n\n==Arts, games, and cognitive sciences==\n[[Perspective (graphical)|Perspective]] artwork utilizes the concept of [[vanishing point]]s, roughly corresponding to mathematical [[point at infinity|points at infinity]], located at an infinite distance from the observer.

One important example of such functions is the group of [[M\u00f6bius transformation]]s (see [[M\u00f6bius transformation#Overview|M\u00f6bius transformation \u00a7 Overview]]).\n\n===Nonstandard analysis===\n[[File:N\u00fameros hiperreales.png|450px|thumb|Infinitesimals (\u03b5) and infinites (\u03c9) on the hyperreal number line (1/\u03b5 = \u03c9/1)]]\n\nThe original formulation of [[infinitesimal calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] used [[infinitesimal]] quantities. In the 20th century, it was shown that this treatment could be put on a rigorous footing through various [[logical system]]s, including [[smooth infinitesimal analysis]] and [[nonstandard analysis]]. In the latter, infinitesimals are invertible, and their inverses are infinite numbers. The infinities in this sense are part of a [[hyperreal number|hyperreal field]]; there is no equivalence between them as with the Cantorian [[transfinite number|transfinites]]. For example, if&nbsp;H is an infinite number in this sense, then H&nbsp;+&nbsp;H&nbsp;=&nbsp;2H and H&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 are distinct infinite numbers. This approach to [[non-standard calculus]] is fully developed in {{harvtxt|Keisler|1986}}.\n\n===Set theory===\n{{Main|Cardinality|Ordinal number}}\n\n[[File:Infinity paradoxon - one-to-one correspondence between infinite set and proper subset.gif|thumb|One-to-one correspondence between an infinite set and its proper subset]]\n\nA different form of \"infinity\" are the [[Ordinal number|ordinal]] and [[cardinal number|cardinal]] infinities of set theory\u2014a system of [[transfinite number]]s first developed by [[Georg Cantor]]. In this system, the first transfinite cardinal is [[aleph-null]] (<span style=\"font-family:'Cambria Math';\"><big>\u2135</big><sub>0</sub></span>), the cardinality of the set of [[natural number]]s. This modern mathematical conception of the quantitative infinite developed in the late 19th century from works by Cantor, [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Richard Dedekind]] and others\u2014using the idea of collections or sets.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nDedekind's approach was essentially to adopt the idea of [[one-to-one correspondence]] as a standard for comparing the size of sets, and to reject the view of Galileo (derived from [[Euclid]]) that the whole cannot be the same size as the part (however, see [[Galileo's paradox]] where he concludes that positive [[Square number|square integers]] are of the same size as positive integers). An infinite set can simply be defined as one having the same size as at least one of its [[proper subset|proper]] parts; this notion of infinity is called [[Dedekind infinite]]. The diagram to the right gives an example: viewing lines as infinite sets of points, the left half of the lower blue line can be mapped in a one-to-one manner (green correspondences) to the higher blue line, and, in turn, to the whole lower blue line (red correspondences); therefore the whole lower blue line and its left half have the same cardinality, i.e. \"size\".{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nCantor defined two kinds of infinite numbers: [[ordinal number]]s and [[cardinal number]]s. Ordinal numbers characterize [[well-ordered]] sets, or counting carried on to any stopping point, including points after an infinite number have already been counted. Generalizing finite and (ordinary) infinite [[sequence]]s which are maps from the positive [[integers]] leads to [[Function (mathematics)|mappings]] from ordinal numbers to transfinite sequences. Cardinal numbers define the size of sets, meaning how many members they contain, and can be standardized by choosing the first ordinal number of a certain size to represent the cardinal number of that size. The smallest ordinal infinity is that of the positive integers, and any set which has the cardinality of the integers is [[countable set|countably infinite]]. If a set is too large to be put in one-to-one correspondence with the positive integers, it is called ''[[Uncountable set|uncountable]]''. Cantor's views prevailed and modern mathematics accepts actual infinity as part of a consistent and coherent theory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://math.dartmouth.edu/~matc/Readers/HowManyAngels/InfinityMind/IM.html|title=Infinity|website=math.dartmouth.edu|access-date=2019-11-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|title=The Infinite\n|first1=A.W.\n|last1=Moore\n|publisher=Routledge\n|year=1991}}\n</ref>{{page needed|date=June 2014}}  Certain extended number systems, such as the hyperreal numbers, incorporate the ordinary (finite) numbers and infinite numbers of different sizes.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Cardinality of the continuum====\n{{Main|Cardinality of the continuum}}\n\nOne of Cantor's most important results was that the cardinality of the continuum <math>\\mathbf c</math> is greater than that of the natural numbers <math>{\\aleph_0}</math>; that is, there are more real numbers '''R''' than natural numbers '''N'''.

The second result was proved by Cantor in&nbsp;1878, but only became intuitively apparent in&nbsp;1890, when [[Giuseppe Peano]] introduced the [[space-filling curve]]s, curved lines that twist and turn enough to fill the whole of any square, or [[cube]], or [[hypercube]], or finite-dimensional space.

One such fractal curve with an infinite perimeter and finite surface area is the [[Koch snowflake]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Mathematics without infinity===\n[[Leopold Kronecker]] was skeptical of the notion of infinity and how his fellow mathematicians were using it in the 1870s and 1880s.

The question of being infinite is logically separate from the question of having boundaries. The two-dimensional surface of the Earth, for example, is finite, yet has no edge.

In addition, there is an area known as the \"Quitter's Room\", which features a picture frame with the question \"Do you remember being born?\" written on it, and there is also a mention to a character named Tiara.

Then he stretched out on the backstretch to regain position about equal to the third American [[Herman Frazier]]. Coming off the final turn Juantorena had caught the rest of the field and was a step behind Newhouse. Parks and [[Fons Brijdenbach]] were about even two more strides back with Frazier just behind them. As Juantorena began to pass Newhouse, Newhouse noticeably struggled, rocking and losing form, then the gold medal. Three metres back, Frazier just edged ahead of Brijdenbach for the bronze medal, as Parks faded.\n\n==Records==\nThese are the standing world and Olympic records (in seconds) prior to the 1976 Summer Olympics.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|- \n!

Juantorena stretched out his long stride on the backstretch to regain position about equal to the third American [[Herman Frazier]].  Coming off the final turn Juantorena had caught the rest of the field and was a step behind Newhouse.  Parks and [[Fons Brijdenbach]] were about even two more strides back with Frazier just behind them.  As Juantorena began to pass Newhouse, Newhouse noticeably struggled, rocking and losing form, then the gold medal.  Three metres back, Frazier just edged ahead of Brijdenbach for the bronze medal, as Parks faded.\n\n==Records==\nThese are the standing world and Olympic records (in seconds) prior to the 1976 Summer Olympics.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|- \n!

Constructed in 1960, it held its first NASCAR race on July 30, 1961. Bristol is among the most popular tracks on the NASCAR schedule because of its distinct features, which include extraordinarily steep banking, an all concrete surface, two [[Pit stop|pit roads]], and [[stadium]]-like seating. It has also been named one of the loudest NASCAR tracks.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gragg|first=Joe|title=It's Official: Bristol Is The Loudest NASCAR Track|url=http://www.wcyb.com/news/28979292/detail.html|publisher=WCYB.com|accessdate=June 3, 2012|date=August 25, 2011}} {{dead link|date=October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Race day at Thunder Valley.jpg|thumb|left|Outside of turn 2]]\nBristol Motor Speedway is the third [[List of sports venues by capacity|largest sports venue in America]] and the seventh largest in the world, housing up to 162,000 people. The track is so short that speeds here are far lower than is typical on most NASCAR [[Oval track racing|oval tracks]], but they are very fast compared to other short tracks due to the high banking. These features make for a considerable amount of \"paint swapping\" at the NASCAR races where the initial starting grid of 40 vehicles each in the Cup and Xfinity Series, and 32 in the Truck Series, extends almost halfway around the track, meaning that slower qualifiers begin the race almost half a lap down. The congestion inherent in this facility and the power of the cars and trucks has been likened to \"flying fighter jets in a gymnasium\". The track is one that tends to be either loved or hated by the fans and the drivers. Purists who grew up driving or attending races at older short tracks located at fairgrounds and similar places tend to love Bristol, while those raised on [[superspeedway]] racing tend to chafe at the lower speeds.\n\nBristol races are often the scene of the highest number of yellow-flag caution laps in the NASCAR season; with so many cars in such a small space, contact is almost inevitable. Until the [[Beneficiary rule|Beneficiary Rule]] was instituted in 2004 (the rule was instituted after the races at Bristol in 2003), the short lap length and the unpredictable nature of the racing meant that this was one of the few remaining NASCAR tracks at which it was feasible for a driver to come back to win a race from several laps down; at most modern tracks, especially superspeedways, that was almost impossible. The short lap length also cuts the other way; any unscheduled [[pit stop]] for reasons such as a cut tire will result in the driver going two or more laps down as it is almost impossible to get anything done to a car during the time taken to complete one circuit, especially under green-flag conditions (approximately 15&nbsp;seconds). Thus, the disadvantage of losing laps means the chances of earning a free pass under the Beneficiary Rule is harder, since a driver losing two laps under a green-flag pit stop would have to race their way past the leader before the caution waved to regain one of their laps back, unless there are no cars one lap behind.\n\n[[Image:BristolMotorSpeedwayAugust2007.jpg|thumb|right|Grandstand in 2007]]\nThe drag strip at this facility has long been [[nickname]]d ''Thunder Valley''. Both current [[NASCAR Cup Series]] races held at Bristol are for 500 laps; the spring race (historically a day race; however, the 2006 race ended under nighttime conditions because of Standard Time and the late afternoon start) is sponsored by area grocery chain [[KVAT Food City|Food City]], and considered one of NASCAR's top ten annual races.<ref>[http://www.maximonline.com/articles/index.aspx?a_id=7455&src=maxim_ed NASCAR's Best Races] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080114193917/http://www.maximonline.com/articles/index.aspx?a_id=7455&src=maxim_ed |date=January 14, 2008 }}</ref> The late summer race (the popular [[Night game#Motorsports|night-time race]], considered \"the toughest ticket in NASCAR\" to obtain) has rotated among several sponsors. From 2001 to 2015, [[Newell Rubbermaid]] sponsored this race, first under its [[Sharpie (marker)|Sharpie]] brand (2001\u20132009) and then its [[Irwin Industrial Tools|Irwin Tools]] brand (2010\u20132015). Starting in 2016, [[Bass Pro Shops]] became primary sponsor of the summer race, with the [[National Rifle Association]] as a secondary sponsor.\n\n[[Image:BristolMotorSpeedwayScoringPilon.jpg|left|thumb|The old scoring pylon in August 2007]]\nBristol is a very fertile ground for other levels and types of racing; [[NASCAR Xfinity Series]] races here often drew over 100,000 spectators, making it one of the best-drawing Xfinity venues, and resulted in the Fox network televising the race nationally from 2004 to 2006 and [[ESPN on ABC|ABC]] doing the same in 2007 and 2008.\n\nIn 2004, it was the first Busch Series race of the season televised on broadcast network television, and the race, which had been 150 laps in 1982, 200 laps in 1984, and 250 laps since 1990, was a 300-lap race in 2006.\n\nThe [[Craftsman Truck Series]] ran a stand-alone race in June from 1995 to 1999 with the NASCAR Autozone Elite Division, Southeast Series.  Since 2003, the race has been a midweek (Wednesday) night race as part of the August night race weekend.  In 2009, the [[NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour]] and the [[NASCAR Whelen Southern Modified Tour]] ran a combined race prior to the truck race.  In 2017, the race was for the Whelen Modified Tour after NASCAR absorbed the Southern Modified Tour into the Modified Tour prior to the 2017 season.\n\nMany of the fans come from the [[East Tennessee]] area, but thousands more come from all parts of the country to experience Bristol's unique brand of racing. Even in the off-season, the complex attracts fans during the Christmas season by facilitating a miles-long holiday lights display that culminates with a lap on the actual speedway track itself.\n\n===Angle of banking===\nThe track long advertised its banking as 36&nbsp;degrees, which at one time made it the most steeply banked track used by NASCAR. However, BMS now lists its banking at 24 to 30 degrees, reflecting the results of the track's most recent resurfacing in 2007.\n\nEven before the resurfacing, there was some dispute as to the accuracy of the measurement. In the 1980s, ESPN often claimed the turns were banked at 35 degrees during television telecast of events at the track. In an interview with ''Stock Car Racing'''s Larry Cothren, driver [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]] openly disputed the measurement of the banking of Bristol Motor Speedway's turns. Newman's crew measured the banking during a test session to aid with setups, and found that the turns were banked 26 degrees, rather than the advertised 36 degrees. A [[Camping World Truck Series]] open test noted the banking had dropped following resurfacing, to 22\u201327&nbsp;degrees, in a variable banking configuration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truckseries.com/cgi-script/NCTS_07/articles/000119/011988.htm|title=Drivers Give New Bristol Concrete a Workout<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=|accessdate=15 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:BristolMotorSpeedwayWorldsFastestHalfMile.jpg|right|thumb|Sign proclaiming the track the \"World's Fastest Half-Mile\" in 2007]]\n\n===Pit roads===\nAnother anomaly is that the short overall length means that there are two sets of pits, which also prevents a garage from being built due to limited space. Until 2002, slower starters were relegated to those on the backstretch. That year, the rules were changed to form essentially one long pit road. Thus, Bristol has unique rules about pit road \u2014 during caution, drivers who are wanting to pit must enter pit road in turn 2, drive all the way down the back stretch through the apron of turns 3 and 4 and down the front stretch, exiting pit road in turn 1. This rule eliminated the inherent disadvantage of pitting on the back stretch. During green flag pit stops, cars with pit stalls on the back stretch enter the pits in turn 2 and exit in turn 3; those with pits on the front stretch enter in turn 4 and exit in turn 1. Since the new pit rules were instituted, several drivers (most notably [[Jeff Gordon]])<ref>[http://www.racingone.com/article.aspx?artnum=20507 Racingone.com]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\"Bristol Race Recap\". Retrieved January 16, 2009.</ref> have made major mistakes during green flag pit stops by driving through both pit roads when only one is necessary for green flag pit stops.\n\n==Track history==\nBristol Motor Speedway could very easily have opened in 1961 under a different name. The first proposed site for the speedway was in [[Piney Flats, Tennessee]], but, according to Carl Moore, who built the track along with Larry Carrier and R. G. Pope, the idea met local opposition. So the track that could have been called Piney Flats International Speedway was built {{convert|5|mi|km}} up the road on U.S. Highway 11-E in Bristol. The land upon which Bristol Motor Speedway is built was formerly part of Gray's Dairy, at one point one of the largest dairies in the eastern half of the United States. Larry Carrier and Carl Moore traveled to [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] in 1960 to watch a race and it was then that they decided to build a speedway in northeast Tennessee. However, they wanted a smaller model of CMS, something with a more intimate setting and opted to erect a {{convert|.5|mi|m|adj=on}} facility instead of mirroring the {{convert|1.5|mi|km|adj=on}} track in Charlotte.\n\nWork began on what was then called '''Bristol International Speedway''' in 1960 and it took approximately one year to finish. Carrier, Moore and Pope scratched many ideas for the track on envelopes and brown paper bags.\n\nPurchase of the land on which BMS now sits, as well as initial construction of the track, cost approximately [[United States dollar|$]]600,000. The entire layout for BMS covered {{convert|100|acre|km2}} and provided parking for more than 12,000 cars. The track itself was a perfect {{convert|.5|mi|m}}, measuring {{convert|60|ft|m}} wide on the straightaways, {{convert|75|ft|m}} wide in the turns, and the turns were banked at 22&nbsp;degrees. [[Seating capacity]] for the very first NASCAR race at BMS&nbsp;\u2013 held on July 30, 1961&nbsp;\u2013 was 18,000. Prior to this race the speedway hosted weekly races. The first driver on the track for practice on July 27, 1961 was [[Tiny Lund]] in his [[Pontiac]]. The second driver out was [[David Pearson (racing driver)|David Pearson]]. [[Fred Lorenzen]] won the pole for the first race at BMS with a speed of {{convert|79.225|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Atlanta's [[Jack Smith (racing driver)|Jack Smith]] won the inaugural event&nbsp;\u2013 the Volunteer 500&nbsp;\u2013 at BMS. However, Smith was not in the driver's seat of the Pontiac when the race ended. Smith drove the first 290 laps then had to have [[Johnny Allen (racing driver)|Johnny Allen]], also of Atlanta, take over as his relief driver. The two shared the $3,225 purse. The total purse for the race was $16,625. Country music star [[Brenda Lee]], who was 17 at the time, sang the national anthem for the first race at BMS. A total of 42 cars started the first race at BMS but only 19 finished.\n[[Image:Waltrip 1989.jpg|thumb|left|One of Bristol's 2 cars that hit the crossover gate at turn 2, this was driven by [[Michael Waltrip]] in 1990]]\n\nIn the fall of 1969, BMS was reshaped and re-measured. The turns were banked at 36&nbsp;degrees and it became a {{convert|0.533|mi|m|adj=on}} oval.\n\nThe speedway was sold after the 1976 season to Lanny Hester and Gary Baker. In the spring of 1978, the track name was changed to '''Bristol International Raceway'''. In August that year, the first [[Night game#Motorsports|night race]] was held on the oval, one that would become one of the most popular and highly anticipated events on the Cup Series calendar.\n\nOn April 1, 1982, Lanny Hester sold his half of the speedway to Warner Hodgdon. On July 6, 1983, Hodgdon completed a 100 percent purchase of Bristol Motor Speedway, as well as [[Nashville Speedway USA|Nashville Speedway]], in a buy-sell agreement with Baker. Hodgdon named Larry Carrier as the track's general manager. On January 11, 1985, Hodgdon filed for bankruptcy. Afterwards, Larry Carrier formally took possession of the speedway and covered all outstanding debts.\n\nFor many years, teams were unable to park their transporters inside the infield, nor did the track have any significant garage area. Team transporters were parked in a lot outside of the track. During racing periods, crews and participants were landlocked by the track, and thus, unable to return to the transporters for spare parts, repairs, or rest. In the early 1990s, the infield was reconfigured and completely paved. Teams began parking the transporters in an orchestrated, extremely tight arrangement that takes several hours, and highly skilled drivers, to accomplish. Teams are now able to work out of their transporters in the same fashion as other facilities.\n\nIn 1992, the speedway abandoned the asphalt surface that it had used since its inception, switching to the concrete surface it is now famous for.\n\nOn January 22, 1996, Larry Carrier sold the speedway to Bruton Smith's [[Speedway Motorsports, Inc.]] (SMI), at a purchase price of $26&nbsp;million. At the time of the sale, the facility seated 71,000. On May 28 of the same year, the track's name was officially changed to '''Bristol Motor Speedway'''. By August, 15,000 seats had been added bringing the seating capacity to 86,000.\n\nBMS continued to grow and by April 1997, it was the largest sports arena in Tennessee and one of the largest in the country, seating 118,000. The speedway also boasted 22 new skyboxes. For the 1998 Goody's 500, the speedway featured more than 131,000 grandstand seats and 100 skyboxes. Improvements to the speedway since Smith took possession are in excess of $50&nbsp;million. Under Smith's ownership, all seating sections have been renamed for past race winners and NASCAR champions.\n\nThe capacity for the 2000 Food City 500 was 147,000 as the Kulwicki Terrace and Kulwicki Tower were completed. Both were named after NASCAR star [[Alan Kulwicki]], who was the reigning Cup Series champion when he died in a plane crash in 1993 while on his way to the spring race at Bristol, which he won the previous year. As a tribute to retiring star [[Darrell Waltrip]], the entire Turn 3 and 4 sections were renamed in his honor in 2000, including a section of seats in Turn 4 near the start-finish line marked as alcohol free. (Waltrip refused to drive for a team in 1987 because its sponsor was associated with alcoholic beverages.) Sections were also named in honor of the Allison family and [[David Pearson (racing driver)|David Pearson]] as part of the renaming of grandstands.\n\nIn both 2000 and 2001, the track was temporarily converted to a dirt track to host the [[World of Outlaws]]' Channellock Challenge.  The conversion involved moving {{convert|8000|cuft|m3}} of red clay onto the track's surface.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parker.com/racing/news/news032-bristol%20to%20host.htm|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20070927100529/http://www.parker.com/racing/news/news032-bristol%20to%20host.htm|url-status=dead|title=Report on the conversion|archivedate=27 September 2007|accessdate=15 July 2018}}</ref> {{convert|700|cuyd|m3}} of sawdust were laid down first to cover the paved surface.

The season saw the addition of a long-awaited infield pedestrian tunnel, allowing access into and out of the infield during on-track activity. Also in 2002, a new building was constructed in the infield to house driver meetings. That same year also witnessed the christening of a new BMS Victory Lane atop the newly constructed building. [[Kurt Busch]] won the [[2002 Food City 500]] on March 24 and became the first Cup winner in the new BMS winner's circle. Additional improvements in 2002 included new scoreboards located on the facing of the suites in Turns 2 and 3. On Monday, August 26, 2002, work began on the most ambitious construction project since SMI's purchase of BMS in 1996. The entire backstretch, including the Speedway's last remaining concrete seats, was demolished. The new backstretch increased the venue's seating capacity to more than 160,000. The new backstretch includes three levels of seating and is topped with 52 luxury skybox suites. These seats are also named for leading NASCAR figures, with [[Richard Petty]], [[Cale Yarborough]] and [[Junior Johnson]] each having a section of the new seats named for them; [[Dale Earnhardt]] was given a section on top in his memory.\n\n[[Image:USA-Kulwicki Grandstand.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alan Kulwicki|Kulwicki]] Grandstand before 2006 [[Sharpie 500]]]]\nA 5,000 seat section of the turn 1 and 2 grandstand, on top of the Alan Kulwicki Grandstand, is now named the [[Rusty Wallace]] Tower. Additional improvements included a scoring pylon with a four-sided video screen akin to those in sports arenas hanging from their ceilings; after the [[2007 Food City 500]], a resurfacing of the entire concrete track along with widening the track {{convert|3|ft|m}} and reshaping the turns with variable banking, which was completed for the [[2007 Sharpie 500]] in August and their support events in the Busch (now Xfinity Series) and Craftsman Truck Series (now Gander Outdoors Truck series).\n\n[[File:ColossusTV.jpg|thumb|\"Colossus TV\" which replaced the old scoring pylon in 2016]]\nThe 2006 [[Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated film ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' used Bristol Motor Speedway as the inspiration for the fictional Motor Speedway of the South, featured in the film's opening scene. ''Cars'' director and NASCAR fan [[John Lasseter]] made it a 1-mile track, compared with Bristol's half-mile, to make the straightaways little longer for some of the scenes and allow for fans in the infield.<ref>{{cite news|last=Snider|first=Mike|title='Cars' touts a real-life look|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2006-06-14-cars-nascar_x.htm|accessdate=October 20, 2013|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=June 15, 2006}}</ref>\n\nA [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] was set in August 2008 when the sell-out crowd completed the largest [[Audience wave|crowd-wave]] in history.<ref>[http://www.racewayreport.com/news/bristol.html Crowd wave at BMS sets Guinness World Record] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715142039/http://www.racewayreport.com/news/bristol.html |date=July 15, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nAnother world record was set in August 2009 for the largest karaoke with a sold-out crowd. Later, when the race was red flagged, the crowd performed the wave again, apparently tying the world record.\n\nOn Saturday, March 20, 2010, during the NASCAR \"Saturday Night Showdown\", where [[retired]] [[List of NASCAR drivers|NASCAR drivers]] drove in a 35-lap race for [[Charitable organization|charity]], a terrifying crash involving [[Larry Pearson]] and [[Charlie Glotzbach]] ended up in a near-tragedy. The race was put under immediate [[Red flag (racing)|red flag]]. Pearson spun out in turn 2, and as his car was sliding down the track, Glotzbach exited turn 2 and rammed into the driver's door of Pearson's car. As Glotzbach climbed out of his car and went to the infield care center, Pearson was [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]] in his car while rescue workers sawed off the roof of the car to get him out. After they got Pearson out, he regained consciousness, as reported by his brothers who talked to him. They also reported that Larry was able to move his arms around. Pearson was air lifted to a nearby hospital. Later, Glotzbach was driven to the same hospital. Before the race started back up, NASCAR legend [[David Pearson (racing driver)|David Pearson]] (Larry's father), who was also racing that day, withdrew from the race and went down to the hospital to see his son.\n\nOn the week ending August 21, 2010, [[Kyle Busch]] became the first driver ever to win races in all three NASCAR national series during a single race meeting.<ref name=\"Kyle sweep\" >{{cite news|last=Fryer|first=Jenna|title=Kyle Busch sweeps all 3 Bristol races|url=http://espn.go.com/rpm/nascar/cup/news/story?id=5482787|accessdate=February 23, 2011|work=ESPN News Services|agency=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|date=August 22, 2010|ref=Kyle sweep|location=[[Bristol, Tennessee]]}}</ref> He began the historic week by winning the Truck race on Wednesday.<ref name=\"Kyle sweep\"/> Two days later, he won the Nationwide race following an incident with [[Brad Keselowski]].

Constructed in 1960, it held its first NASCAR race on July 30, 1961. Bristol is among the most popular tracks on the NASCAR schedule because of its distinct features, which include extraordinarily steep banking, an all concrete surface, two [[Pit stop|pit roads]], and [[stadium]]-like seating. It has also been named one of the loudest NASCAR tracks.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gragg|first=Joe|title=It's Official: Bristol Is The Loudest NASCAR Track|url=http://www.wcyb.com/news/28979292/detail.html|publisher=WCYB.com|accessdate=June 3, 2012|date=August 25, 2011}} {{dead link|date=October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Race day at Thunder Valley.jpg|thumb|left|Outside of turn 2]]\nBristol Motor Speedway is the third [[List of sports venues by capacity|largest sports venue in America]] and the seventh largest in the world, housing up to 162,000 people. The track is so short that speeds here are far lower than is typical on most NASCAR [[Oval track racing|oval tracks]], but they are very fast compared to other short tracks due to the high banking. These features make for a considerable amount of \"paint swapping\" at the NASCAR races where the initial starting grid of 40 vehicles each in the Cup and Xfinity Series, and 32 in the Truck Series, extends almost halfway around the track, meaning that slower qualifiers begin the race almost half a lap down. The congestion inherent in this facility and the power of the cars and trucks has been likened to \"flying fighter jets in a gymnasium\". The track is one that tends to be either loved or hated by the fans and the drivers. Purists who grew up driving or attending races at older short tracks located at fairgrounds and similar places tend to love Bristol, while those raised on [[superspeedway]] racing tend to chafe at the lower speeds.\n\nBristol races are often the scene of the highest number of yellow-flag caution laps in the NASCAR season; with so many cars in such a small space, contact is almost inevitable. Until the [[Beneficiary rule|Beneficiary Rule]] was instituted in 2004 (the rule was instituted after the races at Bristol in 2003), the short lap length and the unpredictable nature of the racing meant that this was one of the few remaining NASCAR tracks at which it was feasible for a driver to come back to win a race from several laps down; at most modern tracks, especially superspeedways, that was almost impossible. The short lap length also cuts the other way; any unscheduled [[pit stop]] for reasons such as a cut tire will result in the driver going two or more laps down as it is almost impossible to get anything done to a car during the time taken to complete one circuit, especially under green-flag conditions (approximately 15&nbsp;seconds). Thus, the disadvantage of losing laps means the chances of earning a free pass under the Beneficiary Rule is harder, since a driver losing two laps under a green-flag pit stop would have to race their way past the leader before the caution waved to regain one of their laps back, unless there are no cars one lap behind.\n\n[[Image:BristolMotorSpeedwayAugust2007.jpg|thumb|right|Grandstand in 2007]]\nThe drag strip at this facility has long been [[nickname]]d ''Thunder Valley''. Both current [[NASCAR Cup Series]] races held at Bristol are for 500 laps; the spring race (historically a day race; however, the 2006 race ended under nighttime conditions because of Standard Time and the late afternoon start) is sponsored by area grocery chain [[KVAT Food City|Food City]], and considered one of NASCAR's top ten annual races.<ref>[http://www.maximonline.com/articles/index.aspx?a_id=7455&src=maxim_ed NASCAR's Best Races] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080114193917/http://www.maximonline.com/articles/index.aspx?a_id=7455&src=maxim_ed |date=January 14, 2008 }}</ref> The late summer race (the popular [[Night game#Motorsports|night-time race]], considered \"the toughest ticket in NASCAR\" to obtain) has rotated among several sponsors. From 2001 to 2015, [[Newell Rubbermaid]] sponsored this race, first under its [[Sharpie (marker)|Sharpie]] brand (2001\u20132009) and then its [[Irwin Industrial Tools|Irwin Tools]] brand (2010\u20132015). Starting in 2016, [[Bass Pro Shops]] became primary sponsor of the summer race, with the [[National Rifle Association]] as a secondary sponsor.\n\n[[Image:BristolMotorSpeedwayScoringPilon.jpg|left|thumb|The old scoring pylon in August 2007]]\nBristol is a very fertile ground for other levels and types of racing; [[NASCAR Xfinity Series]] races here often drew over 100,000 spectators, making it one of the best-drawing Xfinity venues, and resulted in the Fox network televising the race nationally from 2004 to 2006 and [[ESPN on ABC|ABC]] doing the same in 2007 and 2008.\n\nIn 2004, it was the first Busch Series race of the season televised on broadcast network television, and the race, which had been 150 laps in 1982, 200 laps in 1984, and 250 laps since 1990, was a 300-lap race in 2006.\n\nThe [[Craftsman Truck Series]] ran a stand-alone race in June from 1995 to 1999 with the NASCAR Autozone Elite Division, Southeast Series.  Since 2003, the race has been a midweek (Wednesday) night race as part of the August night race weekend.  In 2009, the [[NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour]] and the [[NASCAR Whelen Southern Modified Tour]] ran a combined race prior to the truck race.  In 2017, the race was for the Whelen Modified Tour after NASCAR absorbed the Southern Modified Tour into the Modified Tour prior to the 2017 season.\n\nMany of the fans come from the [[East Tennessee]] area, but thousands more come from all parts of the country to experience Bristol's unique brand of racing. Even in the off-season, the complex attracts fans during the Christmas season by facilitating a miles-long holiday lights display that culminates with a lap on the actual speedway track itself.\n\n===Angle of banking===\nThe track long advertised its banking as 36&nbsp;degrees, which at one time made it the most steeply banked track used by NASCAR. However, BMS now lists its banking at 24 to 30 degrees, reflecting the results of the track's most recent resurfacing in 2007.\n\nEven before the resurfacing, there was some dispute as to the accuracy of the measurement. In the 1980s, ESPN often claimed the turns were banked at 35 degrees during television telecast of events at the track. In an interview with ''Stock Car Racing'''s Larry Cothren, driver [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]] openly disputed the measurement of the banking of Bristol Motor Speedway's turns. Newman's crew measured the banking during a test session to aid with setups, and found that the turns were banked 26 degrees, rather than the advertised 36 degrees. A [[Camping World Truck Series]] open test noted the banking had dropped following resurfacing, to 22\u201327&nbsp;degrees, in a variable banking configuration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truckseries.com/cgi-script/NCTS_07/articles/000119/011988.htm|title=Drivers Give New Bristol Concrete a Workout<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=|accessdate=15 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:BristolMotorSpeedwayWorldsFastestHalfMile.jpg|right|thumb|Sign proclaiming the track the \"World's Fastest Half-Mile\" in 2007]]\n\n===Pit roads===\nAnother anomaly is that the short overall length means that there are two sets of pits, which also prevents a garage from being built due to limited space. Until 2002, slower starters were relegated to those on the backstretch. That year, the rules were changed to form essentially one long pit road. Thus, Bristol has unique rules about pit road \u2014 during caution, drivers who are wanting to pit must enter pit road in turn 2, drive all the way down the back stretch through the apron of turns 3 and 4 and down the front stretch, exiting pit road in turn 1. This rule eliminated the inherent disadvantage of pitting on the back stretch. During green flag pit stops, cars with pit stalls on the back stretch enter the pits in turn 2 and exit in turn 3; those with pits on the front stretch enter in turn 4 and exit in turn 1. Since the new pit rules were instituted, several drivers (most notably [[Jeff Gordon]])<ref>[http://www.racingone.com/article.aspx?artnum=20507 Racingone.com]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\"Bristol Race Recap\". Retrieved January 16, 2009.</ref> have made major mistakes during green flag pit stops by driving through both pit roads when only one is necessary for green flag pit stops.\n\n==Track history==\nBristol Motor Speedway could very easily have opened in 1961 under a different name. The first proposed site for the speedway was in [[Piney Flats, Tennessee]], but, according to Carl Moore, who built the track along with Larry Carrier and R. G. Pope, the idea met local opposition. So the track that could have been called Piney Flats International Speedway was built {{convert|5|mi|km}} up the road on U.S. Highway 11-E in Bristol. The land upon which Bristol Motor Speedway is built was formerly part of Gray's Dairy, at one point one of the largest dairies in the eastern half of the United States. Larry Carrier and Carl Moore traveled to [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] in 1960 to watch a race and it was then that they decided to build a speedway in northeast Tennessee. However, they wanted a smaller model of CMS, something with a more intimate setting and opted to erect a {{convert|.5|mi|m|adj=on}} facility instead of mirroring the {{convert|1.5|mi|km|adj=on}} track in Charlotte.\n\nWork began on what was then called '''Bristol International Speedway''' in 1960 and it took approximately one year to finish. Carrier, Moore and Pope scratched many ideas for the track on envelopes and brown paper bags.\n\nPurchase of the land on which BMS now sits, as well as initial construction of the track, cost approximately [[United States dollar|$]]600,000. The entire layout for BMS covered {{convert|100|acre|km2}} and provided parking for more than 12,000 cars. The track itself was a perfect {{convert|.5|mi|m}}, measuring {{convert|60|ft|m}} wide on the straightaways, {{convert|75|ft|m}} wide in the turns, and the turns were banked at 22&nbsp;degrees. [[Seating capacity]] for the very first NASCAR race at BMS&nbsp;\u2013 held on July 30, 1961&nbsp;\u2013 was 18,000. Prior to this race the speedway hosted weekly races. The first driver on the track for practice on July 27, 1961 was [[Tiny Lund]] in his [[Pontiac]]. The second driver out was [[David Pearson (racing driver)|David Pearson]]. [[Fred Lorenzen]] won the pole for the first race at BMS with a speed of {{convert|79.225|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Atlanta's [[Jack Smith (racing driver)|Jack Smith]] won the inaugural event&nbsp;\u2013 the Volunteer 500&nbsp;\u2013 at BMS. However, Smith was not in the driver's seat of the Pontiac when the race ended. Smith drove the first 290 laps then had to have [[Johnny Allen (racing driver)|Johnny Allen]], also of Atlanta, take over as his relief driver. The two shared the $3,225 purse. The total purse for the race was $16,625. Country music star [[Brenda Lee]], who was 17 at the time, sang the national anthem for the first race at BMS. A total of 42 cars started the first race at BMS but only 19 finished.\n[[Image:Waltrip 1989.jpg|thumb|left|One of Bristol's 2 cars that hit the crossover gate at turn 2, this was driven by [[Michael Waltrip]] in 1990]]\n\nIn the fall of 1969, BMS was reshaped and re-measured. The turns were banked at 36&nbsp;degrees and it became a {{convert|0.533|mi|m|adj=on}} oval.\n\nThe speedway was sold after the 1976 season to Lanny Hester and Gary Baker. In the spring of 1978, the track name was changed to '''Bristol International Raceway'''. In August that year, the first [[Night game#Motorsports|night race]] was held on the oval, one that would become one of the most popular and highly anticipated events on the Cup Series calendar.\n\nOn April 1, 1982, Lanny Hester sold his half of the speedway to Warner Hodgdon. On July 6, 1983, Hodgdon completed a 100 percent purchase of Bristol Motor Speedway, as well as [[Nashville Speedway USA|Nashville Speedway]], in a buy-sell agreement with Baker. Hodgdon named Larry Carrier as the track's general manager. On January 11, 1985, Hodgdon filed for bankruptcy. Afterwards, Larry Carrier formally took possession of the speedway and covered all outstanding debts.\n\nFor many years, teams were unable to park their transporters inside the infield, nor did the track have any significant garage area. Team transporters were parked in a lot outside of the track. During racing periods, crews and participants were landlocked by the track, and thus, unable to return to the transporters for spare parts, repairs, or rest. In the early 1990s, the infield was reconfigured and completely paved. Teams began parking the transporters in an orchestrated, extremely tight arrangement that takes several hours, and highly skilled drivers, to accomplish. Teams are now able to work out of their transporters in the same fashion as other facilities.\n\nIn 1992, the speedway abandoned the asphalt surface that it had used since its inception, switching to the concrete surface it is now famous for.\n\nOn January 22, 1996, Larry Carrier sold the speedway to Bruton Smith's [[Speedway Motorsports, Inc.]] (SMI), at a purchase price of $26&nbsp;million. At the time of the sale, the facility seated 71,000. On May 28 of the same year, the track's name was officially changed to '''Bristol Motor Speedway'''. By August, 15,000 seats had been added bringing the seating capacity to 86,000.\n\nBMS continued to grow and by April 1997, it was the largest sports arena in Tennessee and one of the largest in the country, seating 118,000. The speedway also boasted 22 new skyboxes. For the 1998 Goody's 500, the speedway featured more than 131,000 grandstand seats and 100 skyboxes. Improvements to the speedway since Smith took possession are in excess of $50&nbsp;million. Under Smith's ownership, all seating sections have been renamed for past race winners and NASCAR champions.\n\nThe capacity for the 2000 Food City 500 was 147,000 as the Kulwicki Terrace and Kulwicki Tower were completed. Both were named after NASCAR star [[Alan Kulwicki]], who was the reigning Cup Series champion when he died in a plane crash in 1993 while on his way to the spring race at Bristol, which he won the previous year. As a tribute to retiring star [[Darrell Waltrip]], the entire Turn 3 and 4 sections were renamed in his honor in 2000, including a section of seats in Turn 4 near the start-finish line marked as alcohol free. (Waltrip refused to drive for a team in 1987 because its sponsor was associated with alcoholic beverages.) Sections were also named in honor of the Allison family and [[David Pearson (racing driver)|David Pearson]] as part of the renaming of grandstands.\n\nIn both 2000 and 2001, the track was temporarily converted to a dirt track to host the [[World of Outlaws]]' Channellock Challenge.  The conversion involved moving {{convert|8000|cuft|m3}} of red clay onto the track's surface.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parker.com/racing/news/news032-bristol%20to%20host.htm|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20070927100529/http://www.parker.com/racing/news/news032-bristol%20to%20host.htm|url-status=dead|title=Report on the conversion|archivedate=27 September 2007|accessdate=15 July 2018}}</ref> {{convert|700|cuyd|m3}} of sawdust were laid down first to cover the paved surface.

The season saw the addition of a long-awaited infield pedestrian tunnel, allowing access into and out of the infield during on-track activity. Also in 2002, a new building was constructed in the infield to house driver meetings. That same year also witnessed the christening of a new BMS Victory Lane atop the newly constructed building. [[Kurt Busch]] won the [[2002 Food City 500]] on March 24 and became the first Cup winner in the new BMS winner's circle. Additional improvements in 2002 included new scoreboards located on the facing of the suites in Turns 2 and 3. On Monday, August 26, 2002, work began on the most ambitious construction project since SMI's purchase of BMS in 1996. The entire backstretch, including the Speedway's last remaining concrete seats, was demolished. The new backstretch increased the venue's seating capacity to more than 160,000. The new backstretch includes three levels of seating and is topped with 52 luxury skybox suites. These seats are also named for leading NASCAR figures, with [[Richard Petty]], [[Cale Yarborough]] and [[Junior Johnson]] each having a section of the new seats named for them; [[Dale Earnhardt]] was given a section on top in his memory.\n\n[[Image:USA-Kulwicki Grandstand.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alan Kulwicki|Kulwicki]] Grandstand before 2006 [[Sharpie 500]]]]\nA 5,000 seat section of the turn 1 and 2 grandstand, on top of the Alan Kulwicki Grandstand, is now named the [[Rusty Wallace]] Tower. Additional improvements included a scoring pylon with a four-sided video screen akin to those in sports arenas hanging from their ceilings; after the [[2007 Food City 500]], a resurfacing of the entire concrete track along with widening the track {{convert|3|ft|m}} and reshaping the turns with variable banking, which was completed for the [[2007 Sharpie 500]] in August and their support events in the Busch (now Xfinity Series) and Craftsman Truck Series (now Gander Outdoors Truck series).\n\n[[File:ColossusTV.jpg|thumb|\"Colossus TV\" which replaced the old scoring pylon in 2016]]\nThe 2006 [[Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated film ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' used Bristol Motor Speedway as the inspiration for the fictional Motor Speedway of the South, featured in the film's opening scene. ''Cars'' director and NASCAR fan [[John Lasseter]] made it a 1-mile track, compared with Bristol's half-mile, to make the straightaways little longer for some of the scenes and allow for fans in the infield.<ref>{{cite news|last=Snider|first=Mike|title='Cars' touts a real-life look|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2006-06-14-cars-nascar_x.htm|accessdate=October 20, 2013|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=June 15, 2006}}</ref>\n\nA [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] was set in August 2008 when the sell-out crowd completed the largest [[Audience wave|crowd-wave]] in history.<ref>[http://www.racewayreport.com/news/bristol.html Crowd wave at BMS sets Guinness World Record] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715142039/http://www.racewayreport.com/news/bristol.html |date=July 15, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nAnother world record was set in August 2009 for the largest karaoke with a sold-out crowd.

The race was put under immediate [[Red flag (racing)|red flag]]. Pearson spun out in turn 2, and as his car was sliding down the track, Glotzbach exited turn 2 and rammed into the driver's door of Pearson's car. As Glotzbach climbed out of his car and went to the infield care center, Pearson was [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]] in his car while rescue workers sawed off the roof of the car to get him out. After they got Pearson out, he regained consciousness, as reported by his brothers who talked to him. They also reported that Larry was able to move his arms around. Pearson was air lifted to a nearby hospital. Later, Glotzbach was driven to the same hospital. Before the race started back up, NASCAR legend [[David Pearson (racing driver)|David Pearson]] (Larry's father), who was also racing that day, withdrew from the race and went down to the hospital to see his son.\n\nOn the week ending August 21, 2010, [[Kyle Busch]] became the first driver ever to win races in all three NASCAR national series during a single race meeting.<ref name=\"Kyle sweep\" >{{cite news|last=Fryer|first=Jenna|title=Kyle Busch sweeps all 3 Bristol races|url=http://espn.go.com/rpm/nascar/cup/news/story?id=5482787|accessdate=February 23, 2011|work=ESPN News Services|agency=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|date=August 22, 2010|ref=Kyle sweep|location=[[Bristol, Tennessee]]}}</ref> He began the historic week by winning the Truck race on Wednesday.<ref name=\"Kyle sweep\"/> Two days later, he won the Nationwide race following an incident with [[Brad Keselowski]].

On February 21, Thomas took over the command of the Third Platoon from his platoon commander who was wounded. Thomas and his men successfully assaulted a heavily fortified hostile sector at the base of Mount Suribachi. Thomas directed tank fire while under fire during the Marine assaults on the Japanese, and combined with his other actions that day, this would eventually contribute to the capture of the mountain on February 23 by Thomas and his platoon.

The flag was too small to be seen on the north side of Mount Suribachi where thousands of Marines were fighting most of the Japanese. A 96 by 56 inch flag was obtained from a ship docked on shore and brought up to the top of Mount Suribachi by Pfc. [[Rene Gagnon]] the Second Battalion's runner (messenger) for E Company. At the same time, Sgt. [[Michael Strank]], Cpl. [[Harlon Block]], Pfc. [[Franklin Sousley]], and Pfc. [[Ira Hayes]] from Second Platoon, E Company, were sent to take communication wire (or supplies) up to Third Platoon and raise the second flag. Once on top, the flag was attached to another Japanese steel pipe. The four Marines and  Pfc. [[Harold Schultz]] and Pfc. [[Harold Keller]] (both members of Lt. Schrier's patrol) raised the larger flag.<ref name=\"marines.mil\">[http://www.marines.mil/News/News-Display/Article/810457/usmc-statement-on-iwo-jima-flagraisers/ USMC Statement on Marine Corps Flag Raisers], Office of U.S. Marine Corps Communication, 23 June 2016</ref> At the same time the second flag was raised, the original flag was lowered and taken down the mountain to the battalion adjutant by Pfc. Gagnon. \n\nOn March 14, an American flag was officially raised up a flagpole by orders of Lieutenant General Holland Smith at the [[V Amphibious Corps]] command post on the other side of Mount Suribachi where the [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|3rd Marine Division]] troops were located, and the second flag which was raised on February 23 on Mount Suribachi came down. Lt. Col. Johnson was killed on March 2, Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block were killed on March 1, and Pfc.

This flag raising was also filmed in color by Marine Sgt. [[Bill Genaust]] (killed in action in March) and was used in [[newsreel]]s. Other combat photographers with and besides Rosenthal ascended the mountain after the first flag was raised and the mountaintop secured. These photographers including Rosenthal and Pfc. George Burns an army photographer who was assigned to cover Marine amphibious landings for [[Yank, the Army Weekly|Yank Magazine]], took photos of Marines (including Thomas), corpsmen, and themselves, around both of the flags.

Thomas, generally did not receive national recognition even though the first flag raising and Thomas had received some public recognition first.\n\n====Death and burial====\nOn March 3, Platoon Sgt. Thomas was killed by enemy sniper rifle fire at the north side of Iwo Jima. He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross (for the February 21 action) and the [[Purple Heart|Purple Heart Medal]]. He was buried at the 5th Marine Division cemetery on Iwo Jima where a service was held on March 26, the morning of the day the battle ended.\n\nIn 1948, Thomas's body was returned to Monticello, Florida.

When his platoon leader was wounded, Platoon Sergeant Thomas assumed command and, before supporting tanks arrived to cover him, led his men in an assault on a fanatically defended and heavily fortified hostile sector at the base of Mount Suribachi. With the tanks unable to proceed over the rough terrain beyond positions 75 to 100 yards at the rear of our attacking forces, Platoon Sergeant Thomas ran repeatedly to the nearest tank, and in a position exposed to heavy and accurate [[machine gun|machine-gun]] and [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] barrages, directed the fire of the tanks against the Japanese [[Blockhouse#Concrete blockhouses|pillboxes]] which were retarding his platoon's advance. After each trip to the tanks, he returned to his men and led them in assaulting and neutralizing enemy emplacements, continuing to advance against the Japanese with a knife as his only weapon after the destruction of his rifle by hostile fire. Under his aggressive leadership, the platoon killed all the enemy in the sector and contributed materially to the eventual capture of Mount Suribachi. His daring initiative, fearless leadership and unwavering devotion to duty were inspiring to those with whom he served and reflect the highest credit upon Platoon Sergeant Thomas and the [[United States Department of the Navy|United States Naval Service]].}}\n\n==Other honors==\nA monument on U.S. Highway 90, Monticello, Florida, honors Thomas.

Thomas and his men successfully assaulted a heavily fortified hostile sector at the base of Mount Suribachi. Thomas directed tank fire while under fire during the Marine assaults on the Japanese, and combined with his other actions that day, this would eventually contribute to the capture of the mountain on February 23 by Thomas and his platoon.

A 96 by 56 inch flag was obtained from a ship docked on shore and brought up to the top of Mount Suribachi by Pfc. [[Rene Gagnon]] the Second Battalion's runner (messenger) for E Company. At the same time, Sgt. [[Michael Strank]], Cpl. [[Harlon Block]], Pfc. [[Franklin Sousley]], and Pfc. [[Ira Hayes]] from Second Platoon, E Company, were sent to take communication wire (or supplies) up to Third Platoon and raise the second flag.

Gagnon. \n\nOn March 14, an American flag was officially raised up a flagpole by orders of Lieutenant General Holland Smith at the [[V Amphibious Corps]] command post on the other side of Mount Suribachi where the [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|3rd Marine Division]] troops were located, and the second flag which was raised on February 23 on Mount Suribachi came down.

Thomas Jr., [[United States Marine Corps Reserve]], for extraordinary heroism as a Rifle Platoon Leader serving with Company E, Second Battalion, Twenty-Eighth Marines, Fifth Marine Division, during action on enemy Japanese-held Iwo Jima, Volcano Islands, 21 February 1945. When his platoon leader was wounded, Platoon Sergeant Thomas assumed command and, before supporting tanks arrived to cover him, led his men in an assault on a fanatically defended and heavily fortified hostile sector at the base of Mount Suribachi. With the tanks unable to proceed over the rough terrain beyond positions 75 to 100 yards at the rear of our attacking forces, Platoon Sergeant Thomas ran repeatedly to the nearest tank, and in a position exposed to heavy and accurate [[machine gun|machine-gun]] and [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] barrages, directed the fire of the tanks against the Japanese [[Blockhouse#Concrete blockhouses|pillboxes]] which were retarding his platoon's advance. After each trip to the tanks, he returned to his men and led them in assaulting and neutralizing enemy emplacements, continuing to advance against the Japanese with a knife as his only weapon after the destruction of his rifle by hostile fire. Under his aggressive leadership, the platoon killed all the enemy in the sector and contributed materially to the eventual capture of Mount Suribachi. His daring initiative, fearless leadership and unwavering devotion to duty were inspiring to those with whom he served and reflect the highest credit upon Platoon Sergeant Thomas and the [[United States Department of the Navy|United States Naval Service]].}}\n\n==Other honors==\nA monument on U.S. Highway 90, Monticello, Florida, honors Thomas.
