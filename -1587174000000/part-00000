One SASR operator recalled \"We watched the heat dissipate from his shit in the cold of night.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Hastie's men deployed to make the capture by Bushmasters, along with a Wakunish force element. These were special-forces-like soldiers from the North of Afghanistan, whom Hastie held in high regard. \"The Wakunish were disciplined. They were tactically proficient. They were sensitive to the populace...\" They encircled the target and attacked at first light, as per their rules of engagement for this context. The entire mission was observed by the commander of all Special Operations Forces for [[International Security Assistance Force]], Brigadeer Bill Dechow, who \"watched on as the Wakunish made entry and captured the senior objective without bloodshed.\" Hastie regarded it as exemplary of the kind of work special forces could achieve, \"surgical and sensitive to locals.

He sort of nodded and gave me a warm sympathetic smile and said, \"I forgive you.\"<ref name=\"heraldsun.com.au\" /></blockquote>For Hastie, the death of the boys was both personally affecting and a turning point in his political outlook:<blockquote>I just felt sick... It was arrogant to think we could build a mirror image of ourselves in foreign lands. [The boys\u2019 deaths] underscored the gap between our aims and reality. The two boys who perished were bystanders in this larger struggle. I was humbled and chastened by this experience. War is a miserable enterprise.

One of the first missions with the PRC was to capture a suicide bomber in [[Urozgan Province|Urozgan]] before he had the opportunity to attack.

From wheels down to wheels up had taken 22 minutes. There were no force injuries or casualties. For Hastie:<blockquote>It was the SOTG machine at its most efficient and precise.

In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place. We're not antiprogress, but we are rightly cautious about development, as we are the ones most affected by it.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.openaustralia.org.au/debates/?id=2019-09-11.151.1&s=speaker:10843#g151.2|title=Peel-Harvey Estuary: 11 Sep 2019: House debates (OpenAustralia.org)|website=www.openaustralia.org.au|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:AH with family (KN).jpg|thumb|Ruth and Andrew Hastie with their children in Mandurah, October 2018]]\nHastie met his wife Ruth in the summer of 2007 while he was studying at [[George Washington University]].

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place.

After his return, he joined the [[Northern Expedition]] of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] working in Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan and Hubei Provinces where he gained the attention of General Chiang. He was made the Chairman of the [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fukien]] Provincial Party Headquarters of the KMT at the suggestion of a fellow Japanese educated classmate [[Dai Chuanxian]] with Chiang's approval. This role was expanded to oversee the KMT Chairmanship of Anhwei Provincial Party Headquarters and that of Tsingtao. Whilst in Anhwei, Fang Chi led a political [[purge]] of the local party together with [[Shao Hua]] on the orders of [[Chen Lifu]], founder of the [[CC Clique]] or the ''Central Club Clique'' and head of the [[Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics]] of the Central Committee.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chang |first1=Hsu-Hsin |last2=Myers |first2=Ramon Hawley |date=1993 |title=The Storm Clouds Clear Over China: The Memoir of Ch'en Li-fu, 1900-1993 |trans-title= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MOT_axUIWooC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+storm+clouds+clear+over+China,+the+memoir+of+Ch%27en+Li-fu&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=snippet&q=fang%20chih&f=false |format= |location=Stanford, California |publisher=Hoover Press |isbn=0817992731 |pages=57\u201358 |via= |subscription= |quote=''My memory and the available records provide the following leaders responsible for the Kuomintang party purge in different locals: [[Tseng Yang-fu]] and [[Lai Lien]] in [[Kwangtung Province]]; [[Hsiao Cheng]], [[Chen Yi (Kuomintang)|Cheng I]], [[Hsu Chao-ti]], and [[Hu Chien-chung]] in [[Chekiang Province]]; [[Yang Hu]], [[Wu K'ai-hsien]] and [[Wang Yen-sung]] in Shanghai; [[Ch'eng T'ien-fang]], [[Lo Shih-shih]], and [[Tuan Hsi-p'eng]] in [[Kiangsi Province]]; [[Shao Hua]] and Fang Chi in [[Anhwei Province]]; and [[Yeh Hsiu-feng]] in [[Kiangsu Province]]''}}</ref> The purge mechanism in Anhwei later swept up his former rival and classmate from Japan, [[Wang Buwen]] who was arrested in April 1931 and executed the following month. His work during this period was focused primarily in Hupeh, Kiangsi, Qingdao, Nanking, Hunan, Anhwei and Fukien provinces in various military, political, party affairs and education related jobs.\n\nHis organizational skills and writing ability soon gained the attention of Chen Lifu, with whom he regularly corresponded. The connection with Chen Lifu aligned Fang with the CC Clique faction of the KMT and led to his increased involvement in the operations of the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics. By March 1929, he was promoted to Chief Secretary of the [[Propaganda in the Republic of China|Department of Propaganda of the Central Committee]] by [[Shao Yuanchong]] who was one of four people responsible for the lyrics of the [[National Anthem of the Republic of China]]. He was posted to Nanking and Shanghai. In 1930, he was acting Minister of Information and by September 1931, he was promoted to the Chief Secretary of the Publicity Committee.<ref>\u5218\u656c\u5764\uff0e\u65b9\u6cbb\u5176\u4eba[J]\uff0e\u6c11\u56fd\u6625\u79cb\uff0c1994\uff082\uff09\uff1a42\uff0d46</ref>\n\n== Information Ministry Activities ==\n\nIn the early 1930s, rumors in [[Shanghai]] began spreading of an assassination list compiled by a secretive KMT group that became collectively known as the [[Blue Shirts Society]]. By 1933, these rumors began to come into the mainstream Shanghai press, particularly due to articles printed in the left leaning ''China Forum'' published by American radical [[Harold Isaacs]]. On 20 July 1933, due to the perceived negative public perception, Fang published an article in the ''[[Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury]]'' denouncing the rumors and the existence of the Blue Shirts saying \"No Blue Shirts; No (death) list, its all wrong.\"<ref>{{cite press release |last= |first= |date=21 July 1933 |title=No Blue Shirts; No List, Its All Wrong Says Fang |location=Shanghai |publisher=Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury |via=Shanghai Municipal Police Files, D-4685 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Wakeman |first=Frederic E. |date=2003 |title=Spymaster: Dai Li and the Chinese Secret Service |url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=jYYYQYK6FAYC&dq=%22Fang+Zhi%22+AND+%22Guomindang%22&hl=fr&source=gbs_navlinks_s |location= |publisher=University of California Press |page=85 |isbn=0520928768}}</ref>\n\nIn fact, the [[Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics]], the [[CC Clique]]'s counterintelligence organ was heavily involved in myriad kill or capture missions in Shanghai during this period. In 1929, [[Zhou Enlai]] returned to Shanghai, after a brief period of exile following the [[1927 Shanghai Massacre]], to set up the Communist response to the KMT called the \"Special Service Section of the Central Committee\" or \"Teke\" (zh: \u4e2d\u592e\u7279\u79d1). This led to a bloodbath culminating in the summer of 1931 with a full blown purge and the second flight of [[Zhou Enlai]] from the city.\n\nIn April 1931, KMT agents arrested [[Gu Shunzhang]] in [[Wuhan]]. Gu was one of Zhou's Aides of Security Affairs and his [[interrogation]] and subsequent [[defection]] from the Communists yielded to the Nationalists the entire scope of Zhou's operations in Shanghai and beyond.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Barnouin |first1=Barbara |authorlink1=Barbara Barnouin |last2=Yu |first2=Changgen |authorlink2=Yu Changgen |date=206 |title=Zhou Enlai: A Political Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NztlWQeXf2IC&printsec=frontcover&dq=zhou+enlai&hl=en&ei=wBkuTdKyB4H_8AaJucigAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false |location=Hong Kong |publisher=Chinese University of Hong Kong |page=46 |isbn=9629962802}}</ref> On 21 June 1931, Gu's entire section of the Special Service was either captured or fled with 24 arrested including his superior and General Secretary [[Xiang Zhongfa]] in Shanghai and [[Cai Hesen]] in [[Hong Kong]]. Xiang was quickly executed after his interrogation and the resulting windfall of information led the KMT to conduct an even greater purge of the Communist intelligence networks. The scope of this purge was put at around 3,000 Communists by the  French Intelligence Bureau of the [[Shanghai French Concession]] and lasted until at least 1934 as the Communists from Jianxi attempted to reestablish networks in Guangzhou and Shanghai under Chen Geng and [[Deng Zhongxia]].

Vessels were sunk deliberately in the Whangpoo, Shanghai\u2019s shipping lifeline. The channel to the Yangtze was blocked, a move likely to be made as a last resort before the Nationalists pulled out. Troops in large numbers seemed to be heading for Woosung, logical point to board outward bound ships. Wooden Fence Holds Shanghai was rife with rumors. One said the Reds were in the old French concession. But at 4 pm I visited the defenses on Hungjao road, other city entrances along the railroad and Lunghwa airfield. The whole arc was a scene of crowded confusion. But Nationalist defenses, while battered, had not broken. The Reds definitely were not inside Shanghai. Some Nationalist troops were moving back. Most of them were supply units which move to and fro constantly. From these forward areas few units were leaving... riflemen moved up along with armored vehicles. The fact the Communists reached the wooden fence means that they got through most of Shanghai\u2019s southwestern defenses. But at that point their attack seems to have bogged down and the Reds fell back. As a result they are still only part of the way through the hard crust of the southwestern defenses. They might be able to break through with another punch unless the Nationalists can counterattack. Shipping Blocked, Three small tankers in the Whangpoo. just off [[The Bund|the bund]], were sunk by Nationalists to block off part of the channel and a section of the docks. One of two old riverboats was sunk purposely in the same area. Every building in the city flew Nationalist flags. Garrison officials said this was a \u201cspontaneous\u201d celebration of the people of the \u201cgallant\u201d defense of Shanghai. It was believed widely that the police circulated through the city last night and ordered all to display the Nationalist colors before today\u2019s victory parade. Fang Chih, secretary general of the garrison political council, said Shanghai\u2019s defenders would hold out to the end. He said the city would be defended street by street if necessary, even if it meant destruction of Shanghai, a city of 5,000,000. Fang said the Reds had lost 60,000 dead and wounded; 4.500 prisoners and 500 machine guns in besieging Shanghai. The Reds have suffered five casualties for every one sustained by the Nationalists, he said. (Chinese war figures are often exaggerated). (Communist radio in Peiping broadcast that a bulletin of \u201cgreat importance\u201d will be announced tomorrow. There was no hint as to the contents of the bulletin.) The Communist radio last night said Red positions on the east bank of the Whangpoo at Shanghai were so strong that river traffic was blocked.''}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=May 25, 1949 |title=Shanghai Captured By Communist Army: Red Army Now In French Area |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/104531117 |journal=Goulburn Evening Post |page=5 |doi= |access-date=December 19, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=In order to deal the fatal blow to the Communist bandits, the Government made a decision to defend Shanghai to the last.

Meanwhile, the hilltops of Mae Salong, where they settled among the native hill tribes, could not produce nearly as much food as their former home in Burma.

A Taiwan group returned the courtesy by visiting Ryukyu in October 1985. At this meeting of the two groups, it was agreed to hold symposia in Taipei and Naha alternately every other year. The first meeting was convened by three distinguished Chinese scholars such as Fang Chih, [[Crren Chi-lu]] and [[Chang Hsi-che]].

Li Guangyi had been the chief editor of CAIMAO BAO; published in Beijing, and a few years ago had been sentenced to 5 years and thrown in prison. The charge was \"revealing to foreigners important party and state secrets.\" At that time some news workers were of the opinion: \"When he associated with foreigners, if they 'had a question' he \"had an answer,\" but his answers were on matters of no importance and yet were reckoned as \"revealing' something!\" Some persons in political circles proposed that Li Guangyi be \"reinstated in his former post\" and then be promoted from his post at CAIMAO BAO to the post of chief editor of JINGJI RIBAO. The news makes us rejoice. What the result will be we do not yet know, but it is hoped that after Li Guangyi, all political prisoners, \"speech prisoners, and prisoners who \"revealed secrets,\" who have suffered an injustice, will regain their freedom.'' }}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, Fang was appointed the Vice-President of the ''Free China Relief Association''.

He was made the Chairman of the [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fukien]] Provincial Party Headquarters of the KMT at the suggestion of a fellow Japanese educated classmate [[Dai Chuanxian]] with Chiang's approval. This role was expanded to oversee the KMT Chairmanship of Anhwei Provincial Party Headquarters and that of Tsingtao. Whilst in Anhwei, Fang Chi led a political [[purge]] of the local party together with [[Shao Hua]] on the orders of [[Chen Lifu]], founder of the [[CC Clique]] or the ''Central Club Clique'' and head of the [[Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics]] of the Central Committee.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chang |first1=Hsu-Hsin |last2=Myers |first2=Ramon Hawley |date=1993 |title=The Storm Clouds Clear Over China: The Memoir of Ch'en Li-fu, 1900-1993 |trans-title= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MOT_axUIWooC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+storm+clouds+clear+over+China,+the+memoir+of+Ch%27en+Li-fu&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=snippet&q=fang%20chih&f=false |format= |location=Stanford, California |publisher=Hoover Press |isbn=0817992731 |pages=57\u201358 |via= |subscription= |quote=''My memory and the available records provide the following leaders responsible for the Kuomintang party purge in different locals: [[Tseng Yang-fu]] and [[Lai Lien]] in [[Kwangtung Province]]; [[Hsiao Cheng]], [[Chen Yi (Kuomintang)|Cheng I]], [[Hsu Chao-ti]], and [[Hu Chien-chung]] in [[Chekiang Province]]; [[Yang Hu]], [[Wu K'ai-hsien]] and [[Wang Yen-sung]] in Shanghai; [[Ch'eng T'ien-fang]], [[Lo Shih-shih]], and [[Tuan Hsi-p'eng]] in [[Kiangsi Province]]; [[Shao Hua]] and Fang Chi in [[Anhwei Province]]; and [[Yeh Hsiu-feng]] in [[Kiangsu Province]]''}}</ref> The purge mechanism in Anhwei later swept up his former rival and classmate from Japan, [[Wang Buwen]] who was arrested in April 1931 and executed the following month. His work during this period was focused primarily in Hupeh, Kiangsi, Qingdao, Nanking, Hunan, Anhwei and Fukien provinces in various military, political, party affairs and education related jobs.\n\nHis organizational skills and writing ability soon gained the attention of Chen Lifu, with whom he regularly corresponded. The connection with Chen Lifu aligned Fang with the CC Clique faction of the KMT and led to his increased involvement in the operations of the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics. By March 1929, he was promoted to Chief Secretary of the [[Propaganda in the Republic of China|Department of Propaganda of the Central Committee]] by [[Shao Yuanchong]] who was one of four people responsible for the lyrics of the [[National Anthem of the Republic of China]]. He was posted to Nanking and Shanghai. In 1930, he was acting Minister of Information and by September 1931, he was promoted to the Chief Secretary of the Publicity Committee.<ref>\u5218\u656c\u5764\uff0e\u65b9\u6cbb\u5176\u4eba[J]\uff0e\u6c11\u56fd\u6625\u79cb\uff0c1994\uff082\uff09\uff1a42\uff0d46</ref>\n\n== Information Ministry Activities ==\n\nIn the early 1930s, rumors in [[Shanghai]] began spreading of an assassination list compiled by a secretive KMT group that became collectively known as the [[Blue Shirts Society]]. By 1933, these rumors began to come into the mainstream Shanghai press, particularly due to articles printed in the left leaning ''China Forum'' published by American radical [[Harold Isaacs]]. On 20 July 1933, due to the perceived negative public perception, Fang published an article in the ''[[Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury]]'' denouncing the rumors and the existence of the Blue Shirts saying \"No Blue Shirts; No (death) list, its all wrong.\"<ref>{{cite press release |last= |first= |date=21 July 1933 |title=No Blue Shirts; No List, Its All Wrong Says Fang |location=Shanghai |publisher=Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury |via=Shanghai Municipal Police Files, D-4685 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Wakeman |first=Frederic E. |date=2003 |title=Spymaster: Dai Li and the Chinese Secret Service |url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=jYYYQYK6FAYC&dq=%22Fang+Zhi%22+AND+%22Guomindang%22&hl=fr&source=gbs_navlinks_s |location= |publisher=University of California Press |page=85 |isbn=0520928768}}</ref>\n\nIn fact, the [[Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics]], the [[CC Clique]]'s counterintelligence organ was heavily involved in myriad kill or capture missions in Shanghai during this period. In 1929, [[Zhou Enlai]] returned to Shanghai, after a brief period of exile following the [[1927 Shanghai Massacre]], to set up the Communist response to the KMT called the \"Special Service Section of the Central Committee\" or \"Teke\" (zh: \u4e2d\u592e\u7279\u79d1). This led to a bloodbath culminating in the summer of 1931 with a full blown purge and the second flight of [[Zhou Enlai]] from the city.\n\nIn April 1931, KMT agents arrested [[Gu Shunzhang]] in [[Wuhan]]. Gu was one of Zhou's Aides of Security Affairs and his [[interrogation]] and subsequent [[defection]] from the Communists yielded to the Nationalists the entire scope of Zhou's operations in Shanghai and beyond.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Barnouin |first1=Barbara |authorlink1=Barbara Barnouin |last2=Yu |first2=Changgen |authorlink2=Yu Changgen |date=206 |title=Zhou Enlai: A Political Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NztlWQeXf2IC&printsec=frontcover&dq=zhou+enlai&hl=en&ei=wBkuTdKyB4H_8AaJucigAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false |location=Hong Kong |publisher=Chinese University of Hong Kong |page=46 |isbn=9629962802}}</ref> On 21 June 1931, Gu's entire section of the Special Service was either captured or fled with 24 arrested including his superior and General Secretary [[Xiang Zhongfa]] in Shanghai and [[Cai Hesen]] in [[Hong Kong]].

The scope of this purge was put at around 3,000 Communists by the  French Intelligence Bureau of the [[Shanghai French Concession]] and lasted until at least 1934 as the Communists from Jianxi attempted to reestablish networks in Guangzhou and Shanghai under Chen Geng and [[Deng Zhongxia]].

Vessels were sunk deliberately in the Whangpoo, Shanghai\u2019s shipping lifeline. The channel to the Yangtze was blocked, a move likely to be made as a last resort before the Nationalists pulled out. Troops in large numbers seemed to be heading for Woosung, logical point to board outward bound ships. Wooden Fence Holds Shanghai was rife with rumors. One said the Reds were in the old French concession. But at 4 pm I visited the defenses on Hungjao road, other city entrances along the railroad and Lunghwa airfield. The whole arc was a scene of crowded confusion. But Nationalist defenses, while battered, had not broken. The Reds definitely were not inside Shanghai. Some Nationalist troops were moving back. Most of them were supply units which move to and fro constantly. From these forward areas few units were leaving... riflemen moved up along with armored vehicles. The fact the Communists reached the wooden fence means that they got through most of Shanghai\u2019s southwestern defenses. But at that point their attack seems to have bogged down and the Reds fell back. As a result they are still only part of the way through the hard crust of the southwestern defenses. They might be able to break through with another punch unless the Nationalists can counterattack. Shipping Blocked, Three small tankers in the Whangpoo. just off [[The Bund|the bund]], were sunk by Nationalists to block off part of the channel and a section of the docks. One of two old riverboats was sunk purposely in the same area. Every building in the city flew Nationalist flags. Garrison officials said this was a \u201cspontaneous\u201d celebration of the people of the \u201cgallant\u201d defense of Shanghai. It was believed widely that the police circulated through the city last night and ordered all to display the Nationalist colors before today\u2019s victory parade. Fang Chih, secretary general of the garrison political council, said Shanghai\u2019s defenders would hold out to the end. He said the city would be defended street by street if necessary, even if it meant destruction of Shanghai, a city of 5,000,000. Fang said the Reds had lost 60,000 dead and wounded; 4.500 prisoners and 500 machine guns in besieging Shanghai. The Reds have suffered five casualties for every one sustained by the Nationalists, he said. (Chinese war figures are often exaggerated). (Communist radio in Peiping broadcast that a bulletin of \u201cgreat importance\u201d will be announced tomorrow. There was no hint as to the contents of the bulletin.) The Communist radio last night said Red positions on the east bank of the Whangpoo at Shanghai were so strong that river traffic was blocked.''}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=May 25, 1949 |title=Shanghai Captured By Communist Army: Red Army Now In French Area |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/104531117 |journal=Goulburn Evening Post |page=5 |doi= |access-date=December 19, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=In order to deal the fatal blow to the Communist bandits, the Government made a decision to defend Shanghai to the last.

Meanwhile, the hilltops of Mae Salong, where they settled among the native hill tribes, could not produce nearly as much food as their former home in Burma.

The first meeting was convened by three distinguished Chinese scholars such as Fang Chih, [[Crren Chi-lu]] and [[Chang Hsi-che]].

Li Guangyi had been the chief editor of CAIMAO BAO; published in Beijing, and a few years ago had been sentenced to 5 years and thrown in prison. The charge was \"revealing to foreigners important party and state secrets.\" At that time some news workers were of the opinion: \"When he associated with foreigners, if they 'had a question' he \"had an answer,\" but his answers were on matters of no importance and yet were reckoned as \"revealing' something!\" Some persons in political circles proposed that Li Guangyi be \"reinstated in his former post\" and then be promoted from his post at CAIMAO BAO to the post of chief editor of JINGJI RIBAO. The news makes us rejoice. What the result will be we do not yet know, but it is hoped that after Li Guangyi, all political prisoners, \"speech prisoners, and prisoners who \"revealed secrets,\" who have suffered an injustice, will regain their freedom.'' }}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, Fang was appointed the Vice-President of the ''Free China Relief Association''.

The social compatibility of IT systems references the ability of IT systems to support basic human values and rights. These values and rights include privacy, security, autonomy, system control and calmness. Together with industry partners and international political institutions, the institute develops technical policies and procedures to ensure that designers consider these rights and values when they develop systems. The institute's conceptual and technical work is informed and supported by the analysis of economic conditions, which are given in the form of international markets for personal information, a trend towards automation, decision delegation as well as Internet economics. Furthermore, social and psychological dimensions of IT usage and acceptance are considered. Taken together, the institute follows a three-dimensional research approach, allowing for and using technical, economic and social methods of analysis. A wide range of methods to contribute to the development of a \"sustainable\" technology landscape is applied.
