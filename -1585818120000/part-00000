They have different personalities and seek a humble life by stage drama performances. Lava and Kusa excel in acting, whereas Jai is sidelined by his uncle due to his [[stammering]] disability. Jai, though a member of the family, is generally set to do household chores and is treated as the second class citizen. To take revenge on them for damaging his reputation, an instigated and a humiliated Jai later sets the drama stage on fire and flees.\n\nAfter 20 years, all three brothers have become adults. They have separated, they are scattered and seek their own lives in different places. Kusa, an expert mugger with a happy-go-lucky attitude who does anything with money, mugs a huge amount of money to fly to the United States, but the plan eventually backfires as the money becomes worthless due to demonetization. He happens to meet his twin brother Lava, a bank manager who adheres to his principles and runs an ethical life. Lava is an example for over goodness and gets entangled in many problems with his life because of it, with the fear of losing his job and his love, Priya, his marriage broker whom he had fallen in love when his marriage was fixed and he realized about his love towards her when she did not talk, meet or see him. Kusa hatches a plan to go to the bank and impersonate Lava, while Lava tries to make Priya, whose marriage was fixed, fall for him. He says that she too loves him but does not accept because of her family, and she never said that she does not love him and only says to go. Priya soon accepts his love. However, Kusa cheats Lava and runs away with the money.\n\nPriya disappears, and her father files a kidnap case on Lava because her younger sister claims that she saw Lava kidnap Priya and run away. Priya's father, sister, and a police officer arrive at Lava's house. Lava swears that he did not kidnap Priya. He then receives a call from a colleague, V. A. Rajini, at his bank. She says that there is footage of him stealing money in the bank's locker room. Lava, realizing that Kusa had cheated him, asks the police officer to find Kusa. Kusa is already captured by the police officer and is tied up inside of a truck, where Lava and the police officer go. Lava confronts Kusa and asks him about the whereabouts of Priya. Kusa says that he did not kidnap Priya but did take the money. Lava and Kusa venture that if both of them are alive, Jai may also be. The police officer reveals his identity as Kaakha, who is Jai's mentor, and says that Jai's name is not Jai but Ravan. He pretends to arrest them so that he can bring Lava and Kusa to Ravan (Jai) to kill them.\n\nKaakha narrates the story about Jai after the fire accident. He says that Ravan (Jai) actually started the fire on purpose and then fled to a dangerous town in which Kaakha met Jai and raised him as his own under the name Ravan. Ravan (Jai) was trying to gain a seat in politics, but his temper made him an enemy to the public. He has brought them to his house to use Lava and his kindness to woo the people into voting for Ravan (Jai). The police officer also tells that Ravan learned the weaknesses of both Lava and Kusa and stole Priya and the money, respectively. After knowing the truth about Ravan (Jai), Lava and Kusa are taken to Ravan (Jai)'s house. Ravan (Jai) shows Lava and Kusa Priya and the money, respectively. Ravan (Jai) tells Lava his role and Kusa that he has to woo Simran, a woman that tried to kill Ravan. Ravan (Jai) also says that they have to change their outfits like him and follow his mentor Kaakha. Lava succeeds by gaining the love of the public while impersonating Ravan (Jai). Kusa meets Simran, who is trying to take revenge on Ravan for her brother's death, who used to work for Ravan (Jai) but ended up getting killed by Ravan's enemies.\n\nKusa makes a deal with Simran that she has to act like Ravan's lover so that Kusa can get his money back and Simran can take her revenge on Ravan (Jai). Kusa tells the truth to Lava and Priya about his deal with Simran. Ravan (Jai) overhears the plan and angrily tries to kill Lava and Kusa. Lava begs Ravan (Jai) to leave Kusa. Just then, he receives a call in which he is told that he is the frontrunner for winning the election. Lava and Kusa hatch a plan to bring their brother back with them. They do a play in which emotional breakdowns occur in trying to convince Ravan (Jai) to be their brother again. Ravan (Jai), overcome with emotion, storms out. Later, it is known that Ravan is secretly trying to kill his brothers. The next day, Lava and Kusa drive a car that has a bomb attached to it. After they leave, Ravan (Jai) reveals his plan to kill Lava and Kusa. The uncle begs Ravan (Jai) to save Lava and Kusa, but Ravan (Jai) does not listen. Then, the uncle asks Kaakha to tell Ravan (Jai) to not kill Lava and Kusa. Kaakha comes to know that he told Kusa this, thinking that he was Ravan (Jai). Kusa tells the plan to Lava while they are driving, and they understand Ravan (Jai) and decide to die.\n\nSarkar, who is seeking to take revenge on Ravan (Jai) for his win in the election, stops the car. Sarkar thinks that there are only twins and says that whoever reveals their identity as Ravan (Jai) will be killed and the other will be spared. Both Lava and Kusa pretend to be Ravan (Jai), and in frustration, Sarkar shoots Lava. As Kusa is screaming Lava's name after he is shot, Sarkar thinks that Kusa is actually Ravan if the person that he just shot is Lava. A fight ensues to try and kill them both. Ravan (Jai) comes and save Lava and Kusa by killing Sarkar and his goons, though he is hurt repeatedly and dies after the fight.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--As this film has not yet been released, additions to this section must be sourced per WP:CRYSTAL-->\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[N.

They have different personalities and seek a humble life by stage drama performances. Lava and Kusa excel in acting, whereas Jai is sidelined by his uncle due to his [[stammering]] disability. Jai, though a member of the family, is generally set to do household chores and is treated as the second class citizen. To take revenge on them for damaging his reputation, an instigated and a humiliated Jai later sets the drama stage on fire and flees.\n\nAfter 20 years, all three brothers have become adults. They have separated, they are scattered and seek their own lives in different places. Kusa, an expert mugger with a happy-go-lucky attitude who does anything with money, mugs a huge amount of money to fly to the United States, but the plan eventually backfires as the money becomes worthless due to demonetization. He happens to meet his twin brother Lava, a bank manager who adheres to his principles and runs an ethical life. Lava is an example for over goodness and gets entangled in many problems with his life because of it, with the fear of losing his job and his love, Priya, his marriage broker whom he had fallen in love when his marriage was fixed and he realized about his love towards her when she did not talk, meet or see him. Kusa hatches a plan to go to the bank and impersonate Lava, while Lava tries to make Priya, whose marriage was fixed, fall for him. He says that she too loves him but does not accept because of her family, and she never said that she does not love him and only says to go. Priya soon accepts his love. However, Kusa cheats Lava and runs away with the money.\n\nPriya disappears, and her father files a kidnap case on Lava because her younger sister claims that she saw Lava kidnap Priya and run away. Priya's father, sister, and a police officer arrive at Lava's house. Lava swears that he did not kidnap Priya. He then receives a call from a colleague, V. A. Rajini, at his bank. She says that there is footage of him stealing money in the bank's locker room. Lava, realizing that Kusa had cheated him, asks the police officer to find Kusa. Kusa is already captured by the police officer and is tied up inside of a truck, where Lava and the police officer go. Lava confronts Kusa and asks him about the whereabouts of Priya. Kusa says that he did not kidnap Priya but did take the money. Lava and Kusa venture that if both of them are alive, Jai may also be. The police officer reveals his identity as Kaakha, who is Jai's mentor, and says that Jai's name is not Jai but Ravan. He pretends to arrest them so that he can bring Lava and Kusa to Ravan (Jai) to kill them.\n\nKaakha narrates the story about Jai after the fire accident. He says that Ravan (Jai) actually started the fire on purpose and then fled to a dangerous town in which Kaakha met Jai and raised him as his own under the name Ravan. Ravan (Jai) was trying to gain a seat in politics, but his temper made him an enemy to the public. He has brought them to his house to use Lava and his kindness to woo the people into voting for Ravan (Jai). The police officer also tells that Ravan learned the weaknesses of both Lava and Kusa and stole Priya and the money, respectively. After knowing the truth about Ravan (Jai), Lava and Kusa are taken to Ravan (Jai)'s house. Ravan (Jai) shows Lava and Kusa Priya and the money, respectively. Ravan (Jai) tells Lava his role and Kusa that he has to woo Simran, a woman that tried to kill Ravan. Ravan (Jai) also says that they have to change their outfits like him and follow his mentor Kaakha. Lava succeeds by gaining the love of the public while impersonating Ravan (Jai). Kusa meets Simran, who is trying to take revenge on Ravan for her brother's death, who used to work for Ravan (Jai) but ended up getting killed by Ravan's enemies.\n\nKusa makes a deal with Simran that she has to act like Ravan's lover so that Kusa can get his money back and Simran can take her revenge on Ravan (Jai). Kusa tells the truth to Lava and Priya about his deal with Simran. Ravan (Jai) overhears the plan and angrily tries to kill Lava and Kusa. Lava begs Ravan (Jai) to leave Kusa. Just then, he receives a call in which he is told that he is the frontrunner for winning the election. Lava and Kusa hatch a plan to bring their brother back with them. They do a play in which emotional breakdowns occur in trying to convince Ravan (Jai) to be their brother again. Ravan (Jai), overcome with emotion, storms out. Later, it is known that Ravan is secretly trying to kill his brothers. The next day, Lava and Kusa drive a car that has a bomb attached to it. After they leave, Ravan (Jai) reveals his plan to kill Lava and Kusa. The uncle begs Ravan (Jai) to save Lava and Kusa, but Ravan (Jai) does not listen. Then, the uncle asks Kaakha to tell Ravan (Jai) to not kill Lava and Kusa. Kaakha comes to know that he told Kusa this, thinking that he was Ravan (Jai). Kusa tells the plan to Lava while they are driving, and they understand Ravan (Jai) and decide to die.\n\nSarkar, who is seeking to take revenge on Ravan (Jai) for his win in the election, stops the car. Sarkar thinks that there are only twins and says that whoever reveals their identity as Ravan (Jai) will be killed and the other will be spared. Both Lava and Kusa pretend to be Ravan (Jai), and in frustration, Sarkar shoots Lava. As Kusa is screaming Lava's name after he is shot, Sarkar thinks that Kusa is actually Ravan if the person that he just shot is Lava. A fight ensues to try and kill them both. Ravan (Jai) comes and save Lava and Kusa by killing Sarkar and his goons, though he is hurt repeatedly and dies after the fight.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--As this film has not yet been released, additions to this section must be sourced per WP:CRYSTAL-->\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[N.

Usually they have to beat other robots in order to become the best one. Many competitions are for schools but several competitions with professional and hobbyist participants are also arising.\n\n== History ==\n\nRobotic competitions have been organized since the 1970s and 1980s. In 1979 a [[Micromouse]] competition was organized by the [[IEEE]] as shown in the ''[[IEEE Spectrum|Spectrum]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cyberneticzoo.com/tag/maze-runner/ |title=Maze Runner Archives |publisher=cyberneticzoo.com |accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlthough it is difficult to pinpoint the first robotic competition in history two events are well known nowadays for their longevity: the All Japan Sumo from Japan, and the Trinity College International Fire fighting Robot Contest.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://trinityrobotcontest.org/ |title=Trinity College Int'L Firefighting Home Robot Contest |publisher=Trinityrobotcontest.org |accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOther competitions have grown in popularity with the pass of time, being the [[Robocup]] and the [[Robo One]] two of the main singular events in current times. In parallel companies like [[Lego]] and [[VEX Robotics Competition|VEX]] have developed their own branded events and called them leagues, although they function more like individual cups in regional qualifiers with finals.\n\nThere is some controversy whether university specific challenges should be considered competitions or more workshops, in general the trend is to open competitions to the public in order to prevent nepotism and improve the quality of the robots competing at the event.\n\nSome organizations have been trying to standardize robotics competition through the introduction of full-fledged leagues with a standard calendar, but the model has been only working in specific countries like Spain where the National League was founded in 2008 and is still functioning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lnrc.es |title=Liga nacional de robotica de competicion |publisher=Lnrc.es |accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Criteria to classify robot competitions ==\n\nThere are many criteria that can be used to classify robot competitions which makes it hard to establish a standard way of referring to them:\n\n* Popularity with public or competitors\n* Indoors versus Outdoors\n* Branded materials (LEGO or VEX) versus Open materials\n* Minors / students versus Professionals / clubs\n* Itinerant (Robocup) versus Fixed-location (All Japan Sumo)\n* Nature of movement: humanoid, wheeled, aerial, aquatic, underwater,...\n\n== Competitions ==\n\n=== Major competitions and organizations ===\nAll these competitions are indoors, itinerant in their location and showcase different categories.

The track consists of sand roads and fields containing bushes and rocks. The robots must run outside the sticks from start to finish without human assistance as fast as possible. YouTube movies and pictures from the 2007 and 2008 competitions are available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://robotti.wikidot.com/off-road-2007|title=Off Road 2007 videos|publisher=wikidot.com|accessdate=August 31, 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== International Autonomous Robot Racing Challenge (IARRC) ===\nStudent teams from around the world compete in an outdoor racing competition, where small-scale robots race against other robots to the finish line, without any human guidance or control. Their skills are put to test in a static judging event, a drag race and a circuit race event, where the vehicles navigate around obstacles and obey the traffic rules. These robots are finding their way in applications such as space exploration, mining, search and rescue, remote sensing and automotive inspection.\n\nRobot Racing is an effort to promote research in autonomous mobile robotics technology. The competition provides students with engineering design challenges, including components of mechanical, computer, control software, and system integration. Students work together to design and build robotic vehicles that can navigate twisting, obstacle-filled courses without any human guidance or control.\n\n=== Mobile Autonomous Systems Laboratory competition (Maslab) ===\nThe [[Mobile Autonomous Systems Laboratory]], or Maslab, is a university-level vision-based autonomous robotics competition. The competition is open to students of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) and requires multithreaded applications of image processing, robotic movements, and target ball deposition.

Usually they have to beat other robots in order to become the best one. Many competitions are for schools but several competitions with professional and hobbyist participants are also arising.\n\n== History ==\n\nRobotic competitions have been organized since the 1970s and 1980s. In 1979 a [[Micromouse]] competition was organized by the [[IEEE]] as shown in the ''[[IEEE Spectrum|Spectrum]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cyberneticzoo.com/tag/maze-runner/ |title=Maze Runner Archives |publisher=cyberneticzoo.com |accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlthough it is difficult to pinpoint the first robotic competition in history two events are well known nowadays for their longevity: the All Japan Sumo from Japan, and the Trinity College International Fire fighting Robot Contest.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://trinityrobotcontest.org/ |title=Trinity College Int'L Firefighting Home Robot Contest |publisher=Trinityrobotcontest.org |accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOther competitions have grown in popularity with the pass of time, being the [[Robocup]] and the [[Robo One]] two of the main singular events in current times. In parallel companies like [[Lego]] and [[VEX Robotics Competition|VEX]] have developed their own branded events and called them leagues, although they function more like individual cups in regional qualifiers with finals.\n\nThere is some controversy whether university specific challenges should be considered competitions or more workshops, in general the trend is to open competitions to the public in order to prevent nepotism and improve the quality of the robots competing at the event.\n\nSome organizations have been trying to standardize robotics competition through the introduction of full-fledged leagues with a standard calendar, but the model has been only working in specific countries like Spain where the National League was founded in 2008 and is still functioning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lnrc.es |title=Liga nacional de robotica de competicion |publisher=Lnrc.es |accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Criteria to classify robot competitions ==\n\nThere are many criteria that can be used to classify robot competitions which makes it hard to establish a standard way of referring to them:\n\n* Popularity with public or competitors\n* Indoors versus Outdoors\n* Branded materials (LEGO or VEX) versus Open materials\n* Minors / students versus Professionals / clubs\n* Itinerant (Robocup) versus Fixed-location (All Japan Sumo)\n* Nature of movement: humanoid, wheeled, aerial, aquatic, underwater,...\n\n== Competitions ==\n\n=== Major competitions and organizations ===\nAll these competitions are indoors, itinerant in their location and showcase different categories.

Animation]] for [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]]. It is the thirteenth installment produced in the ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' franchise. The series is produced by [[Chris Bailey (animator)|Chris Bailey]].\n\nThe show premiered on the [[Boomerang (TV network)#Mobile app/subscription service|Boomerang streaming service and app]] on June 27, 2019.<ref name=animationmagazine2>{{cite news|date=2018-05-23|title=Boomerang Unveils New SCOOBY-DOO AND GUESS WHO? & YABBA-DABBA DINOSAURS!

The show is rated TV-PG, making this the first ''Scooby-Doo'' series to carry that rating.\n\n==Premise==\n''Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?'' focuses on the Mystery Inc. gang as they solve mysteries while also encountering many memorable celebrities, similar in ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]''. Guest stars that have appeared include [[Chris Paul]], [[Sia (musician)|Sia]], [[Halsey (singer)|Halsey]], [[Ricky Gervais]], [[Kenan Thompson]], [[Wanda Sykes]], [[Bill Nye]], [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]] and [[Mark Hamill]], along with characters such as [[Steve Urkel]], [[Batman]], [[Sherlock Holmes]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Magilla Gorilla]] and Mr. Peebles, and [[The Funky Phantom]].\n\nUnlike in The New Scooby-Doo Movies, the show is intended for a 30-minute block on TV instead of a 60-minute block and includes somewhat of a parody of the guest stars.\n\nThe tone of the show is comedic and does not include an overarching plot. The animation style is new to the Scooby-Doo franchise but is designed to look similar to how cartoons were drawn in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{main|List of Scooby-Doo characters}}\n\n===Main cast===\n* [[Frank Welker]] - [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]], [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]]\n* [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]] - [[Daphne Blake]]\n* [[Matthew Lillard]] - [[Shaggy Rogers|Norville \"Shaggy\" Rogers]]\n* [[Kate Micucci]] - [[Velma Dinkley]]\n\n===Guest stars===\n* [[Kevin Conroy]] - [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]] (in \"What a Night, For a Dark Knight!\")<ref name=Insta>{{cite news|date=2018-05-25|title=Matthew Lillard on Instagram|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BWvgDwpj5DY|work=Instagram }}</ref>\n* [[Ian James Corlett]] - [[Sherlock Holmes]] (in \"Elementary, My Dear Shaggy!\")<ref name=FutonCritic/>\n* [[John DiMaggio]] - [[Abraham Lincoln]] (in \"A Mystery Solving Gang Divided\")<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-scooby-doo-guess-who-trailer-20190620-story.html|title=New \u2018Scooby Doo\u2019 trailer turns Chris Paul, Sia and Wonder Woman into cartoons|date=June 20, 2019|website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>\n* [[Jim Gaffigan]] - Himself (in \"The Fastest Food Fiend!\")<ref name=FutonCritic/>\n* [[Ricky Gervais]] - Himself (in \"Ollie Ollie In-Come Free!\")\n<!--* [[Whoopi Goldberg]] - Herself<ref>https://www.tvinsider.com/788081/scooby-doo-and-guess-who-boomerang-premiere/</ref> (in \"The Nightmare Ghost of Psychic U!\")>-->\n<!--* [[Halsey (singer)|Halsey]] - Herself>-->\n* [[Mark Hamill]] - [[Joker (character)|The Joker]] (in \"What a Night, For a Dark Knight!\"), Himself\n* [[Rachel Kimsey]] - [[Wonder Woman]] (in \"The Scooby of a Thousand Faces!\")<ref name=FutonCritic>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2019/06/20/jinkies-new-series-scooby-doo-and-guess-who-to-world-premiere-on-boomerang-583304/20190620boomerang01/|title=Breaking News - Jinkies!

Animation]] for [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]]. It is the thirteenth installment produced in the ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' franchise. The series is produced by [[Chris Bailey (animator)|Chris Bailey]].\n\nThe show premiered on the [[Boomerang (TV network)#Mobile app/subscription service|Boomerang streaming service and app]] on June 27, 2019.<ref name=animationmagazine2>{{cite news|date=2018-05-23|title=Boomerang Unveils New SCOOBY-DOO AND GUESS WHO? & YABBA-DABBA DINOSAURS!

The show is rated TV-PG, making this the first ''Scooby-Doo'' series to carry that rating.\n\n==Premise==\n''Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?'' focuses on the Mystery Inc. gang as they solve mysteries while also encountering many memorable celebrities, similar in ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]''. Guest stars that have appeared include [[Chris Paul]], [[Sia (musician)|Sia]], [[Halsey (singer)|Halsey]], [[Ricky Gervais]], [[Kenan Thompson]], [[Wanda Sykes]], [[Bill Nye]], [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]] and [[Mark Hamill]], along with characters such as [[Steve Urkel]], [[Batman]], [[Sherlock Holmes]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Magilla Gorilla]] and Mr. Peebles, and [[The Funky Phantom]].\n\nUnlike in The New Scooby-Doo Movies, the show is intended for a 30-minute block on TV instead of a 60-minute block and includes somewhat of a parody of the guest stars.\n\nThe tone of the show is comedic and does not include an overarching plot. The animation style is new to the Scooby-Doo franchise but is designed to look similar to how cartoons were drawn in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{main|List of Scooby-Doo characters}}\n\n===Main cast===\n* [[Frank Welker]] - [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]], [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]]\n* [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]] - [[Daphne Blake]]\n* [[Matthew Lillard]] - [[Shaggy Rogers|Norville \"Shaggy\" Rogers]]\n* [[Kate Micucci]] - [[Velma Dinkley]]\n\n===Guest stars===\n* [[Kevin Conroy]] - [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]] (in \"What a Night, For a Dark Knight!\")<ref name=Insta>{{cite news|date=2018-05-25|title=Matthew Lillard on Instagram|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BWvgDwpj5DY|work=Instagram }}</ref>\n* [[Ian James Corlett]] - [[Sherlock Holmes]] (in \"Elementary, My Dear Shaggy!\")<ref name=FutonCritic/>\n* [[John DiMaggio]] - [[Abraham Lincoln]] (in \"A Mystery Solving Gang Divided\")<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-scooby-doo-guess-who-trailer-20190620-story.html|title=New \u2018Scooby Doo\u2019 trailer turns Chris Paul, Sia and Wonder Woman into cartoons|date=June 20, 2019|website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>\n* [[Jim Gaffigan]] - Himself (in \"The Fastest Food Fiend!\")<ref name=FutonCritic/>\n* [[Ricky Gervais]] - Himself (in \"Ollie Ollie In-Come Free!\")\n<!--* [[Whoopi Goldberg]] - Herself<ref>https://www.tvinsider.com/788081/scooby-doo-and-guess-who-boomerang-premiere/</ref> (in \"The Nightmare Ghost of Psychic U!\")>-->\n<!--* [[Halsey (singer)|Halsey]] - Herself>-->\n* [[Mark Hamill]] - [[Joker (character)|The Joker]] (in \"What a Night, For a Dark Knight!\"), Himself\n* [[Rachel Kimsey]] - [[Wonder Woman]] (in \"The Scooby of a Thousand Faces!\")<ref name=FutonCritic>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2019/06/20/jinkies-new-series-scooby-doo-and-guess-who-to-world-premiere-on-boomerang-583304/20190620boomerang01/|title=Breaking News - Jinkies!
