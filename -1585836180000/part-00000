The cuisine differs markedly from that of the majority [[Yamato people]] of [[Japan]].  Raw meat like [[sashimi]], for example, is rarely served in Ainu cuisine, which instead uses methods such as [[boiling]], [[roasting]] and [[Curing (food preservation)|curing]] to prepare meat. Also unlike Japanese cuisine, traditional Ainu cuisine did not use [[miso]], soy sauce, or sugar, though these seasonings make an appearance in modern Ainu cuisine.<ref>{{cite book |title=\u30a4\u30da\u98df\u3079\u308b |date=2014 |publisher=\u5317\u6d77\u9053\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u6c11\u65cf\u6587\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc |page=30 |url=http://www.hm.pref.hokkaido.lg.jp/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/pon_kanpisosi3.pdf}}</ref>  The island of [[Hokkaid\u014d]] in northern Japan is where most Ainu live today; however, they once inhabited most of the [[Kuril islands]], the southern half of [[Sakhalin island]], and parts of northern Honsh\u016b Island.\n\nThere are very few Ainu restaurants in the world, though some do exist such as [[Ashiri Kotan Nakanoshima]] in [[Sapporo]], and [[Poron'no]] and [[Marukibune]] in [[Akan, Hokkaid\u014d|Ainu Kotan, Hokkaid\u014d]].\n\n==Overview==\nTraditional Ainu cuisine used meats obtained through fishing and hunting such as salmon and deer, wild plants gathered in the mountains such as ''[[cardiocrinum cordatum]]'' bulbs (''{{lang|ain|turep}}'') and [[acorn]]s, as well as various grains and potatoes obtained through farming.

Raw meat like [[sashimi]], for example, is rarely served in Ainu cuisine, which instead uses methods such as [[boiling]], [[roasting]] and [[Curing (food preservation)|curing]] to prepare meat.

A night meal (''{{lang|ain|kunne ipe}}'') was sometimes eaten during night fishing or other late activities.<ref>{{cite book|title=\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u6c11\u65cf\u8a8c|last1=\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u6587\u5316\u4fdd\u5b58\u5bfe\u7b56\u5354\u8b70\u4f1a|first=|date=1970|publisher=\u7b2c\u4e00\u6cd5\u898f\u51fa\u7248|year=|isbn=|location=|page=416|asin=B000J9FZ8E}}</ref>\n\nFood was transferred from the cooking pot using a ladle (''{{lang|ain|kasup}}'') into a lacquerware bowl (''{{lang|ain|itanki}}'') for eating. These bowls were obtained through trade with the ethnic Japanese and were large enough to hold 400 ml worth of food. Chunks of meat or fish that were too large to fit in the bowl were placed on mats woven from reeds.<ref name=\"\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u6c11\u65cf\u8a8c406-420\" /> Items such as fish roasted on a spit or ''{{lang|ain|sito}}'' were eaten by hand, but otherwise, most foods were eaten with chopsticks (''{{lang|ain|pasuy}}'') or spoons (''{{lang|ain|parapasuy}}''). ''{{lang|ain|Parapasuy}}'' translated literally means \u201cwide chopstick\u201d. Both spoons and chopsticks were carved from wood.<ref name=\"\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u6c11\u65cf\u8a8c406-420\" />\n\nWhen guests were over for food, the head woman of the house would offer food and say \u201c''{{lang|ain|ipeyan}}''\u201d (please eat). The guest would express their gratitude, and, if it were a valuable meal such as bear meat, they would raise the food to their forehead in thanks before beginning. However, the family would not say anything before eating if there were no guests. Once finished, it was customary to say \u201c''{{lang|ain|hunna}}''\u201d to express their gratitude for the food.<ref>{{cite book|title=\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u6c11\u65cf\u8a8c|last1=\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u6587\u5316\u4fdd\u5b58\u5bfe\u7b56\u5354\u8b70\u4f1a|first=|date=1970|publisher=\u7b2c\u4e00\u6cd5\u898f\u51fa\u7248|year=|isbn=|location=|page=412|asin=B000J9FZ8E}}</ref>\n\nSimilar to the ethnic Japanese, it was considered polite to eat all food that was provided. Because of this, it was considered polite to use one's finger to wipe the remaining sauce from inside the bowl and lick it. This custom is the reason for the Ainu name for the pointer finger, \u201c''{{lang|ain|itanki kem atsukep}}''\u201d, literally meaning \u201cbowl-licking finger\u201d.<ref name=\"\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u6c11\u65cf\u8a8c406-420\" /><ref name=\"\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u306e\u6b74\u53f294\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Kayano |first=Shigeru (\u8431\u91ce\u8302) |author-link=Shigeru Kayano |title=\u8431\u91ce\u8302\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 (Kayano Shigeru no ainu go jiten) |publisher=Sanseid\u014d |year=1996}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Batchelor |first=John |title=Ainu-English-Japanese Dictionary: (including A Grammar of the Ainu Language |place=London |publisher=Methodist Publishing House |year=1905 |url=https://archive.org/details/anainuenglishja00batcgoog}}\n*{{citation|last1=Batchelor |first1=John |last2=Miyabe |first2=Kingo |title=Ainu economic plants |journal=Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan|year=1893 |volume=221 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RrYUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA198 |pages=198\u2013240}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{portal|Japan|Food}}\n{{commons category|Ainu food}}\n*[http://www.ainu-museum.or.jp/en/study/eng06.html Ainu Agriculture]\n*[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/hokkaido/ainu2.html Origins of Ainu]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050828185844/http://www.ainu-museum.or.jp/english/english.html English site of the Ainu Museum]\n*[https://www.poronno.com/ Official site of an Ainu restaurant in Ainu Kotan, \"''Poron'no''\"] {{in lang|ja}}\n*[http://www.sh.rim.or.jp/~moshiri/marukibune/rest.html Official site of an Ainu restaurant in Ainu Kotan, \"''Marukibune by Moshiri''\"] {{in lang|ja}}\n\n{{cuisines}}\n\n[[Category:Ainu cuisine| ]]\n[[Category:Culture articles needing translation from Japanese Wikipedia]]\n[[Category:Cuisine by ethnicity]]\n", "name_user": "Erynamrod", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCrops:polishing language", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainu_cuisine"}

The film is about a father who has a recurring dream/vision about the loss of his family while witnessing a force bent on destruction. The film stars [[Lizzy Caplan]], [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]], [[Mike Colter]], Lilly Aspell, [[Emma Booth (actress)|Emma Booth]], [[Israel Broussard]], and ik [[Lex Shrapnel]]. It was released on [[Netflix]] on July 27, 2018.\n\nThe film had originally bene scheduled for a theatrical release on January 26, 2018, by Universal Pictures, but was pulled from the release schedule. Later in February 2018, it was reported that Netflix had acquired the film from Universal. It received negative reviews, with criticism for its confused and weak storyline, character development and pacing.\n\n== Plot ==\nPeter, an engineer, has recurring nightmares in which he and everyone he knows suffer through violent, [[alien invasion]]-like confrontations with an unknown enemy. He reluctantly visits a clinic to receive psychiatric help, only to find a patient there who reveals that he is having the same visions, prompting Peter to believe his visions are of an upcoming invasion.\n\nThat night, invading spaceships open fire on the city, causing significant damage. Peter and his wife, Alice, barricade their apartment amid the sounds of slaughter from ground troops. A soldier dressed in armor breaks through the barricade and finds Lucy, one of Peter and Alice's children, hiding under a table. The soldier pauses to examine the girl, and that distraction allows Peter and Alice to immobilize the soldier. Peter, now armed with the soldier's weapon, leads his family out of the building.\n\nBased on his visions, Peter and his family agree to seek shelter at the factory where Peter works. He is able to bypass the rifle's [[biometric authentication]] and kill soldiers guarding the apartment building's exit. They make their way to a tunnel entrance to safely travel to the factory, but not before Alice is injured from a bomb blast. As they regroup, the soldier from their apartment appears, having tracked them with a homing signal on the rifle Peter took. To Peter's shock, the soldier removes his helmet and appears human. Peter forces the soldier to carry Alice to the factory. There, his boss David, explains that the invasion has been expected for many years. A medic examines Alice but informs Peter that he cannot save her. As David's men drag the invading soldier off to execute him, he yells to Peter that he can save Alice. Peter agrees to stay with the soldier to save Alice. David will evacuate their children to a subway station where a transport train awaits to take them all to an offsite base.\n\nThe soldier surprises Peter by revealing that Alice is a synthetic ([[Artificial intelligence|AI]]). To save Alice, she needs an alternate source of power: Peter himself. At the soldier's guidance, Peter cuts open his own chest with a pocket knife, confirming that he is also a synthetic. The soldier connects a cable between the two androids and Peter passes out, experiencing in detail what he had thought were visions of the future but are actually memories of a past war. Fearing that android workers (\"synthetics\") might rise up against humans, the military attack unarmed synthetics. The synthetics fight back and eventually drive all humans off the planet. To deal with the guilt of what they have done and prevent themselves from living in fear of a reprisal from humans, the synthetics have wiped their memories and lived as humans, unaware of their nature or history.\n\nPeter wakes up and the soldier, Miles, explains that humans have been living on [[Mars]] for 50 years. He had expected the synths to be monsters, not families with children. Peter and Alice part amicably with Miles to find their daughters as humans breach the roof of the factory.

The film is about a father who has a recurring dream/vision about the loss of his family while witnessing a force bent on destruction. The film stars [[Lizzy Caplan]], [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]], [[Mike Colter]], Lilly Aspell, [[Emma Booth (actress)|Emma Booth]], [[Israel Broussard]], and [[Lex Shrapnel]]. It was released on [[Netflix]] on July 27, 2018.\n\nThe film had originally been scheduled for a theatrical release on January 26, 2018, by Universal Pictures, but was pulled from the release schedule. Later in February 2018, it was reported that Netflix had acquired the film from Universal. It received negative reviews, with criticism for its confused and weak storyline, character development and pacing.\n\n== Plot ==\nPeter, an engineer, has recurring nightmares in which he and everyone he knows suffer through violent, [[alien invasion]]-like confrontations with an unknown enemy. He reluctantly visits a clinic to receive psychiatric help, only to find a patient there who reveals that he is having the same visions, prompting Peter to believe his visions are of an upcoming invasion.\n\nThat night, invading spaceships open fire on the city, causing significant damage. Peter and his wife, Alice, barricade their apartment amid the sounds of slaughter from ground troops. A soldier dressed in armor breaks through the barricade and finds Lucy, one of Peter and Alice's children, hiding under a table. The soldier pauses to examine the girl, and that distraction allows Peter and Alice to immobilize the soldier. Peter, now armed with the soldier's weapon, leads his family out of the building.\n\nBased on his visions, Peter and his family agree to seek shelter at the factory where Peter works. He is able to bypass the rifle's [[biometric authentication]] and kill soldiers guarding the apartment building's exit. They make their way to a tunnel entrance to safely travel to the factory, but not before Alice is injured from a bomb blast. As they regroup, the soldier from their apartment appears, having tracked them with a homing signal on the rifle Peter took. To Peter's shock, the soldier removes his helmet and appears human. Peter forces the soldier to carry Alice to the factory. There, his boss David, explains that the invasion has been expected for many years. A medic examines Alice but informs Peter that he cannot save her. As David's men drag the invading soldier off to execute him, he yells to Peter that he can save Alice. Peter agrees to stay with the soldier to save Alice. David will evacuate their children to a subway station where a transport train awaits to take them all to an offsite base.\n\nThe soldier surprises Peter by revealing that Alice is a synthetic ([[Artificial intelligence|AI]]). To save Alice, she needs an alternate source of power: Peter himself. At the soldier's guidance, Peter cuts open his own chest with a pocket knife, confirming that he is also a synthetic. The soldier connects a cable between the two androids and Peter passes out, experiencing in detail what he had thought were visions of the future but are actually memories of a past war. Fearing that android workers (\"synthetics\") might rise up against humans, the military attack unarmed synthetics. The synthetics fight back and eventually drive all humans off the planet. To deal with the guilt of what they have done and prevent themselves from living in fear of a reprisal from humans, the synthetics have wiped their memories and lived as humans, unaware of their nature or history.\n\nPeter wakes up and the soldier, Miles, explains that humans have been living on [[Mars]] for 50 years. He had expected the synths to be monsters, not families with children. Peter and Alice part amicably with Miles to find their daughters as humans breach the roof of the factory. As they all depart on the train, David explains that he and a handful of other synthetics kept their memories to stay prepared for the inevitable return of the humans. Peter suggests that some day there could be peace between humans and synthetics.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]] as Peter\n* [[Lizzy Caplan]] as Alice, Peter's wife \n* [[Mike Colter]] as David, Peter's boss\n* Amelia Crouch as Hanna, Alice and Peter's daughter \n* Erica Tremblay as Lucy, Alice and Peter's daughter \n* [[Israel Broussard]] as Miles, a soldier\n* [[Lex Shrapnel]] as Ray, Samantha's husband\n* [[Emma Booth (actress)|Emma Booth]] as Samantha, Ray's wife \n* Lilly Aspell as Megan, Ray and Samantha's daughter\n\n== Production ==\n\nIn December 2013, it was revealed that the screenplay for ''Extinction'', written by Spenser Cohen, had been included in the 2013 [[The Black List (survey)|Black List]] of the year's best unproduced scripts in Hollywood, as voted on by more than 250 studio execs.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/the-black-list-announces-2013-screenplays-live-1200963352/|title=The Black List Announces 2013 Screenplays (Complete List)|last=Kroll|first=Justin|date=2013-12-16|work=Variety|access-date=2018-07-20}}</ref> In January 2014, [[Joe Johnston]] signed on to direct the film,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/captain-america-director-talks-alien-669047|title='Captain America' Director in Talks For Alien Invasion Movie 'Extinction' (Exclusive)|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en}}</ref> and in September 2016, it was revealed that [[James McAvoy]] was \"in talks\" to star.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2016/09/james-mcavoy-sci-fi-thriller-extinction-1201810268/|title=James McAvoy May Find Life In Sci-Fi Thriller \u2018Extinction\u2019|last=Busch|first=Anita|date=2016-09-09|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-07-20}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2016, Ben Young signed on to direct the film, with Johnston having left the project a while back.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2016/10/hounds-of-love-ben-young-extinction-james-mcavoy-1201839431/|title=\u2018Hounds Of Love\u2019 Helmer Ben Young Set To Direct \u2018Extinction\u2019|last=Jr|first=Mike Fleming|date=2016-10-19|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-07-20}}</ref> In January 2017, it was announced that [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]] would star in the role McAvoy had been courted for.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/berlin-michael-pena-sci-fi-thriller-extinction-1201974913/|title=Michael Pena to Star in Sci-Fi Thriller \u2018Extinction\u2019|last=McNary|first=Dave|date=2017-02-01|work=Variety|access-date=2018-07-20}}</ref> In February 2017, [[Universal Pictures]] won worldwide distribution rights to the film, with principal production set to begin in April 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/universal-nabs-sci-fi-thriller-extinction-starring-michael-pena-976591|title=Universal Nabs Sci-Fi Thriller 'Extinction' Starring Michael Pena (Exclusive)|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en}}</ref> In March 2017, [[Lizzy Caplan]] and [[Israel Broussard]] joined the cast,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/lizzy-caplan-michael-pena-extinction-exclusive-1202001739/|title=Lizzy Caplan Joins Michael Pena in Sci-Fi Thriller \u2018Extinction\u2019 (EXCLUSIVE)|last=Kroll|first=Justin|date=2017-03-03|work=Variety|access-date=2018-07-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/bling-ring-star-israel-broussard-joining-alien-invasion-thriller-extinction-986548|title='Bling Ring' Star Israel Broussard Joining Alien Invasion Thriller 'Extinction' (Exclusive)|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en}}</ref> while [[Mike Colter]] and [[Lex Shrapnel]] joined in April,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/mike-colter-cast-in-extinction-luke-cage-the-defenders-1202392261/|title=\u2018Luke Cage\u2019 Star Mike Colter Joins Universal\u2019s \u2018Extinction\u2019 (EXCLUSIVE)|last=Kroll|first=Justin|date=2017-04-21|work=Variety|access-date=2018-07-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/captain-america-lex-shrapnel-michael-pena-in-extinction-1202401315/|title=\u2018Captain America\u2019 Actor Lex Shrapnel Joins Michael Pena in \u2018Extinction\u2019|last=Kroll|first=Justin|date=2017-04-27|work=Variety|access-date=2018-07-20}}</ref> and [[Emma Booth (actress)|Emma Booth]] in May.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/05/emma-booth-extinction-universal-andy-buckley-all-light-will-end-indie-1202103072/|title=Emma Booth Cast In Universal\u2019s \u2018Extinction\u2019;
