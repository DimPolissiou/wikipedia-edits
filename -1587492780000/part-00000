In March 2009, a usability and experience study was carried out on new and non-editors of the English Wikipedia. The aim was to discover what obstacles participants encountered while editing Wikipedia, ranging from small changes to more complicated syntax such as templates. The study recruited 2500 people for in-person laboratory testing via the Wikipedia website, which was filtered down to ten participants.

This began with a qualitative environment survey on [[MediaWiki]] extensions, followed by a Qualitative Statistical Survey focusing on the volume of edits, the number of new users, and related statistics. In March 2009, a usability and experience study was carried out on new and non-editors of the English Wikipedia. The aim was to discover what obstacles participants encountered while editing Wikipedia, ranging from small changes to more complicated syntax such as templates. The study recruited 2500 people for in-person laboratory testing via the Wikipedia website, which was filtered down to ten participants. The results were collated and used by the technology team to improve Wikipedia's usability.<ref>{{cite web|title=Usability and Experience Study|url=http://usability.wikimedia.org/wiki/Usability_and_Experience_Study|work=Wikimedia Usability|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=November 14, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104193005/http://usability.wikimedia.org/wiki/Usability_and_Experience_Study|archive-date=November 4, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> The Usability and Experience Study was followed up by the Usability, Experience and Progress Study in September 2009.

American actor and singer. He began his career as a child actor in 1987 acting in films including ''[[The Mighty Ducks]]'' (1992) and [[Rob Reiner]]'s ''[[North (1994 film)|North]]'' (1994). In 2015, Smollett portrayed musician [[Jamal Lyon]] in the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] drama series ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]'', a role that was hailed as groundbreaking for its positive depiction of a black gay man on television. Smollett has also appeared in [[Ridley Scott]]'s science fiction film ''[[Alien: Covenant]]'' (2017) as Ricks and in ''[[Marshall (film)|Marshall]]'' (2017) as [[Langston Hughes]].\n\nSmollett was indicted on February 20, 2019, for [[disorderly conduct]] consisting of allegedly paying two Nigerian-American brothers to stage a [[Racial hoax|fake hate crime]] assault on him and filing a false police report.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Nemetz |first1=Dave |title=Jussie Smollett Indicted, Charged With Felony for Filing False Police Report |url=https://tvline.com/2019/02/20/jussie-smollett-indicted-felony-false-police-report-empire/ |accessdate=February 20, 2019 |work=[[TVLine]] |location=United States |date=February 20, 2019}}</ref> Prosecutors dropped the charges on March 26, 2019, in return for Smollett performing community service and forfeiting his $10,000 bond.<ref name=\"ChicagoTribune\" /> Shortly thereafter the city of Chicago filed suit against Smollett for the cost of overtime that authorities expended investigating [[Jussie Smollett alleged assault|the alleged attack]], totaling $130,105.15.

It is an offshoot of the [[Shepherd's Rod|Davidian Seventh-Day Adventist Church]], established by [[Victor Houteff]] in the 1930s. Houteff was a [[Bulgaria]]n immigrant to the United States and a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]]. He wrote a series of tracts which were titled the \"Shepherd\u2019s Rod.\" The tracts called for the reform of the Seventh-day Adventist church. His ideas were rejected by Adventist leaders, and in 1935, Houteff and his followers settled near Waco and began preparing for the [[Second Coming]]. Houteff's group eventually moved to a farm near [[Waco]], [[Texas]]. Roden took possession of the settlement, which was known as Mt. Carmel, in 1962.\n\nThe Branch Davidians are most associated with the [[Waco siege]] of 1993, a 51-day standoff between Branch Davidians and federal agents. The conflict ended when the group's compound was destroyed in a fire. 26 people were killed during the initial raid, and 76 during the final assault.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Early history ==\nIn 1929, [[Victor Houteff]], a [[Bulgaria]]n [[immigrant]] and a [[Seventh-day Adventist]] [[Sabbath School]] teacher in a local church in Southern California, claimed that he had a new message for the entire church. He presented his views in a book, ''[[Shepherd's Rod|The Shepherd's Rod: The 144,000\u2014A Call for Reformation]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists |url=http://www.the-branch.org/Shepherds_Rod_Volume_1_Houteff |title=The Shepherd's Rod, Vol. 1 |publisher=The-branch.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-18}}</ref> The Adventist leadership rejected Houteff's views as contrary to the Adventists' basic teachings and local church congregations disfellowshipped Houteff and his followers.\n\nIn 1934, Houteff established his headquarters to the west of Waco, Texas and his group became known as The [[Shepherd's Rod|Davidians]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ird01 |title= Davidians and Branch Davidians |author1= Pitts, William L |publisher= Handbook of Texas \u2013 Texas State Historical Association |accessdate= November 25, 2012}}</ref> In 1942, he renamed the group the General Association of Davidian Seventh-day Adventists, 'Davidian' indicating the belief in the restoration of the [[Davidic Kingdom|Davidic Kingdom of Israel]]. Following Houteff's death in 1955, the segment of the group loyal to Houteff continued as the [[Davidian Seventh-day Adventist]]s, led by his wife Florence. Convinced of an imminent apocalypse, in a time frame announced by Florence Houteff which was not found in the original writings of her husband Victor, Florence and her council gathered hundreds of faithful followers together at their [[Mount Carmel Center]] near Waco in 1959 for the fulfillment of [[Ezekiel 9]].<ref name=\"melton1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Branch-Davidian#ref700562|title=Branch Davidian {{!}} Religious Organization|last=Melton|first=John Gordon|date=|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-05-17|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe anticipated events did not occur, and following this disappointment, [[Benjamin Roden]] formed another group called the Branch Davidians and succeeded in taking control of Mount Carmel. This name is an allusion to the anointed 'Branch' (mentioned in Zechariah 3:8; 6:12).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bible.com/bible/111/ZEC.3.8|title=Zechariah 3:8; \"&#8198;'Listen, High Priest Joshua, you and your associates seated before you, who are men symbolic of things to come: I am going to bring my servant, the Branch.|website=www.bible.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bible.com/bible/111/ZEC.6.12|title=Zechariah 6:12; Tell him this is what the Lord Almighty says: 'Here is the man whose name is the Branch, and he will branch out from his place and build the temple of the Lord.|website=www.bible.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-17}}</ref> When Benjamin Roden died in 1978, he was succeeded by his wife [[Lois Roden]]. Members of the Branch Davidians were torn between allegiance to Ben's wife, Lois Roden, and his son, George. After Lois Roden died, George Roden assumed the right to the Presidency. But less than a year later, [[David Koresh|Vernon Howell]] rose to power and became the leader over those in the group who sympathized with him.\n\n== Rise of David Koresh ==\n[[David Koresh|Vernon Howell]]'s arrival on the [[Waco]] compound in 1981 was well received by nearly everyone at the Davidian commune. Howell had an affair with the then-[[prophet]] of the Branch Davidians, [[Lois Roden]], while he was in his late 20s and she was in her late 60s. Howell wanted a child with her, who, according to his understanding, would be the Chosen One. When she died, her son [[George Roden]] inherited the positions of prophet and leader of the commune. However, George Roden and Howell began to clash.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography: David Koresh|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/waco/davidkoresh.html|website=PBS|publisher=Frontline|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref> Howell soon enjoyed the loyalty of the majority of the Branch Davidian community.<ref>{{cite book|last1=David G.

This illegal act gave Howell an opportunity to attempt to file charges against Roden; however, he was told he needed evidence. This led to the raid on November 3, 1987, of the [[Mount Carmel Center]] by Howell and 7 of his followers equipped with five .223 caliber semiautomatic rifles, two .22 caliber rifles, two 12-gauge shotguns and nearly 400 rounds of ammunition. Their objective seemed to be to retake the land that Howell had left three years earlier: although they claim to have been trying to obtain evidence of Roden's illegal activity, they did not come equipped with a camera.<ref>{{cite web|title=BIOGRAPHY: David Koresh|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/waco/davidkoresh.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=23 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe trial ended with the jury finding the followers of Howell not guilty, but the jury members were unable to agree on a verdict for Howell.

Houteff went on to found the Davidians (a splinter group, otherwise known as the [[Shepherd's Rod]]). Branch Davidians are considered a splinter group from that dissenting group (the Davidians/Shepherd's Rod) and the product of a schism among the Davidians/Shepherd's Rod initiated by [[Benjamin Roden]].\n\nBranch Davidian leaders, while still formally members in the Seventh-day Adventist Church, pushed for a reform of the church and when this was met with opposition (from both the common Seventh-day Adventists and also the already excluded Davidians/Shepherd's Rod), they decided to leave that denomination while at the same time widely distancing themselves from the Davidians/Shepherd's Rod (their \"parent group\" that arose earlier and was also excluded for their own attempts to reform the Seventh-day Adventist Church). The Seventh-day Adventist Church deprived both the Branch Davidians and the Davidians of their membership in the denomination, but in spite of this fact the Branch Davidians actively continued to \"hunt\" members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, encouraging them to leave it and join their group instead. The Seventh-day Adventists were reportedly \"apprehensive\" about the group's views as Branch Davidians claimed to be the \"only rightful continuation of the [[Adventism|Adventist message]]\", based on the idea that [[Victor Houteff]] was the divinely selected prophet and successor to [[Ellen G. White]]. Both the Davidians/Shepherd's Rod and the Branch Davidians claimed Houteff as their spiritual inspiration, although he was the founder of the Davidians/Shepherd's Rod. The Seventh-day Adventist Church issued warnings about the Branch Davidian views to its members on a regular basis.<ref>Armageddon in Waco: Critical Perspectives on the Branch Davidian Conflict by Stuart A.

Both groups have disputed the relevance of the other's spiritual authority based on the proceedings following [[Victor Houteff]]'s death. From its inception in 1930, the Davidians/Shepherd's Rod group believed themselves to be living in a time when [[Bible prophecy|Biblical prophecies]] of a [[Last Judgment]] were coming to pass as a prelude to [[Christ (title)|Christ]]'s [[Second Coming]].\n\nIn the late 1980s, Koresh and his followers abandoned many Branch Davidian teachings. Koresh became the group's self-proclaimed final prophet. \"Koreshians\" were the majority resulting from the schism among the Branch Davidians, but some of the Branch Davidians did not join Koresh's group and instead gathered around [[George Roden]] or became independent. Following a series of violent shootouts between Roden's and Koresh's group, the Mount Carmel compound was eventually taken over by the \"Koreshians\".\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Cult]]\n* [[Apocalypticism]]\n* [[List of new religious movements]]\n* [[List of Christian denominations]]\n* [[Millenarianism]]\n* [[Religious violence]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n37.) https://www.amazon.com/Waco-Untold-Koresh-Identity-Davidians/dp/0999802607/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Waco+Untold&qid=1583005536&sr=8-1\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.bdsda.com The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists]\n \n{{Branch Davidians}}\n{{Sabbath-Keeping Churches}}\n{{Religiously motivated suicides}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1959 establishments in Texas]]\n[[Category:Christian organizations established in 1959]]\n[[Category:Organizations based in Texas]]\n[[Category:Branch Davidianism]]\n[[Category:Right-wing militia organizations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Adventism]]\n[[Category:Christian denominations established in the 20th century]]\n[[Category:Paramilitary organizations based in the United States]]\n[[Category:Religious paramilitary organizations]]\n[[Category:Christian new religious movements]]\n[[Category:Religious controversies]]\n[[Category:Waco siege]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Religious movement}}\n{{infobox religious group\n| group         = Branch Davidians\n| image         = File:Flag_of_Branch_Davidians.svg|border\n| image_caption = Branch Davidian flag\n| population    =\n| founder       = [[Benjamin Roden]]\n| regions       = {{flag|Texas}} ({{flag|United States}})\n| tablehdr      = Branch Davidian\n| region1       = [[Mount Carmel Center|Mount Carmel]]\n| pop1          = 12\n| ref1          = {{unbulleted list\n |Elk, Texas<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hre15 |title= Elk, Texas |author1= Smyrl, Vivian Elizabeth |publisher= Handbook of Texas \u2013 Texas State Historical Association |accessdate= 25 November 2012}}</ref>\n |[[Mount Carmel Center|Mount Carmel]], [[Texas]], U.S.\n }}\n| region2       =\n| pop2          =\n| ref2          =\n| region3       =\n| pop3          =\n| ref3          =\n| religions     =\n| languages     = English\n| related-c     =\n| notes         = Split from the [[Shepherd's Rod|Shepherd's Rod/Davidians]]\n}}\n{{Adventism}}\nThe '''Branch Davidians''' are a religious community founded in 1959 by [[Ben Roden]]. It is an offshoot of the [[Shepherd's Rod|Davidian Seventh-Day Adventist Church]], established by [[Victor Houteff]] in the 1930s. Houteff was a [[Bulgaria]]n immigrant to the United States and a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]]. He wrote a series of tracts which were titled the \"Shepherd\u2019s Rod.\" The tracts called for the reform of the Seventh-day Adventist church. His ideas were rejected by Adventist leaders, and in 1935, Houteff and his followers settled near Waco and began preparing for the [[Second Coming]]. Houteff's group eventually moved to a farm near [[Waco]], [[Texas]]. Roden took possession of the settlement, which was known as Mt. Carmel, in 1962.\n\nThe Branch Davidians are most associated with the [[Waco siege]] of 1993, a 51-day standoff between Branch Davidians and federal agents. The conflict ended when the group's compound was destroyed in a fire. 26 people were killed during the initial raid, and 76 during the final assault.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Early history ==\nIn 1929, [[Victor Houteff]], a [[Bulgaria]]n [[immigrant]] and a [[Seventh-day Adventist]] [[Sabbath School]] teacher in a local church in Southern California, claimed that he had a new message for the entire church. He presented his views in a book, ''[[Shepherd's Rod|The Shepherd's Rod: The 144,000\u2014A Call for Reformation]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists |url=http://www.the-branch.org/Shepherds_Rod_Volume_1_Houteff |title=The Shepherd's Rod, Vol. 1 |publisher=The-branch.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-18}}</ref> The Adventist leadership rejected Houteff's views as contrary to the Adventists' basic teachings and local church congregations disfellowshipped Houteff and his followers.\n\nIn 1934, Houteff established his headquarters to the west of Waco, Texas and his group became known as The [[Shepherd's Rod|Davidians]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ird01 |title= Davidians and Branch Davidians |author1= Pitts, William L |publisher= Handbook of Texas \u2013 Texas State Historical Association |accessdate= November 25, 2012}}</ref> In 1942, he renamed the group the General Association of Davidian Seventh-day Adventists, 'Davidian' indicating the belief in the restoration of the [[Davidic Kingdom|Davidic Kingdom of Israel]]. Following Houteff's death in 1955, the segment of the group loyal to Houteff continued as the [[Davidian Seventh-day Adventist]]s, led by his wife Florence. Convinced of an imminent apocalypse, in a time frame announced by Florence Houteff which was not found in the original writings of her husband Victor, Florence and her council gathered hundreds of faithful followers together at their [[Mount Carmel Center]] near Waco in 1959 for the fulfillment of [[Ezekiel 9]].<ref name=\"melton1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Branch-Davidian#ref700562|title=Branch Davidian {{!}} Religious Organization|last=Melton|first=John Gordon|date=|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-05-17|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe anticipated events did not occur, and following this disappointment, [[Benjamin Roden]] formed another group called the Branch Davidians and succeeded in taking control of Mount Carmel.

Members of the Branch Davidians were torn between allegiance to Ben's wife, Lois Roden, and his son, George. After Lois Roden died, George Roden assumed the right to the Presidency. But less than a year later, [[David Koresh|Vernon Howell]] rose to power and became the leader over those in the group who sympathized with him.\n\n== Rise of David Koresh ==\n[[David Koresh|Vernon Howell]]'s arrival on the [[Waco]] compound in 1981 was well received by nearly everyone at the Davidian commune. Howell had an affair with the then-[[prophet]] of the Branch Davidians, [[Lois Roden]], while he was in his late 20s and she was in her late 60s. Howell wanted a child with her, who, according to his understanding, would be the Chosen One. When she died, her son [[George Roden]] inherited the positions of prophet and leader of the commune. However, George Roden and Howell began to clash.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography: David Koresh|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/waco/davidkoresh.html|website=PBS|publisher=Frontline|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref> Howell soon enjoyed the loyalty of the majority of the Branch Davidian community.<ref>{{cite book|last1=David G.

This illegal act gave Howell an opportunity to attempt to file charges against Roden; however, he was told he needed evidence. This led to the raid on November 3, 1987, of the [[Mount Carmel Center]] by Howell and 7 of his followers equipped with five .223 caliber semiautomatic rifles, two .22 caliber rifles, two 12-gauge shotguns and nearly 400 rounds of ammunition.

Pace claims that Koresh twisted the Bible's teachings by fathering more than a dozen children with members\u2019 wives.<ref>{{cite news|last1=The Associated Press|title=Near Waco, a New Fight Over an Old Compound|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/us/15waco.html|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=12 May 2016}}</ref> Pace believes that the Lord \"has anointed me and appointed me to be the leader\" but he claims that he is \"not a prophet\" but \"a teacher of righteousness\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite news|last1=Burnett|first1=John|title=Two Decades Later, Some Branch Davidians Still Believe|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/04/20/178063471/two-decades-later-some-branch-davidians-still-believe|accessdate=12 May 2016|publisher=National Public Radio|date=April 20, 2013}}</ref> Like the Branch Davidians under Koresh, this incarnation is waiting for the end of times.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n== Relationship with Seventh-Day Adventists ==\n\nThe [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], the main church in the [[Adventist]] tradition, rejected [[Victor Houteff]]'s teachings and revoked his membership in 1930. Houteff went on to found the Davidians (a splinter group, otherwise known as the [[Shepherd's Rod]]). Branch Davidians are considered a splinter group from that dissenting group (the Davidians/Shepherd's Rod) and the product of a schism among the Davidians/Shepherd's Rod initiated by [[Benjamin Roden]].\n\nBranch Davidian leaders, while still formally members in the Seventh-day Adventist Church, pushed for a reform of the church and when this was met with opposition (from both the common Seventh-day Adventists and also the already excluded Davidians/Shepherd's Rod), they decided to leave that denomination while at the same time widely distancing themselves from the Davidians/Shepherd's Rod (their \"parent group\" that arose earlier and was also excluded for their own attempts to reform the Seventh-day Adventist Church). The Seventh-day Adventist Church deprived both the Branch Davidians and the Davidians of their membership in the denomination, but in spite of this fact the Branch Davidians actively continued to \"hunt\" members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, encouraging them to leave it and join their group instead. The Seventh-day Adventists were reportedly \"apprehensive\" about the group's views as Branch Davidians claimed to be the \"only rightful continuation of the [[Adventism|Adventist message]]\", based on the idea that [[Victor Houteff]] was the divinely selected prophet and successor to [[Ellen G. White]]. Both the Davidians/Shepherd's Rod and the Branch Davidians claimed Houteff as their spiritual inspiration, although he was the founder of the Davidians/Shepherd's Rod. The Seventh-day Adventist Church issued warnings about the Branch Davidian views to its members on a regular basis.<ref>Armageddon in Waco: Critical Perspectives on the Branch Davidian Conflict by Stuart A. Wright, p.22</ref>\n\n=== Schisms within the Branch Davidian sect ===\n\nThere is documented evidence (FBI negotiation transcripts between Kathryn Shroeder and Steve Schneider with interjections from Koresh himself) that David Koresh and his followers did not call themselves Branch Davidians.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.txstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10877/1958/507.pdf?sequence=1|title=United States Department of the Treasury: Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms (Tape #126 Transcription)|last=|first=|date=March 13, 1993|website=|access-date=}}</ref> In addition, David Koresh, through forgery, stole the identity of the Branch Davidian Seventh-day Adventists for the purpose of obtaining the Mount Carmel Center property.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Waco Untold, How David Koresh Stole the Identity of The Branch Davidians|last=Mitchell|first=Douglas|publisher=Ten Strings Publishing|year=2018|isbn=978-0-9998026-0-1|location=USA|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe doctrinal beliefs of the Branch Davidians differ on teachings such as the [[Holy Spirit]] and his nature, and the feast days and their requirements. Both groups have disputed the relevance of the other's spiritual authority based on the proceedings following [[Victor Houteff]]'s death. From its inception in 1930, the Davidians/Shepherd's Rod group believed themselves to be living in a time when [[Bible prophecy|Biblical prophecies]] of a [[Last Judgment]] were coming to pass as a prelude to [[Christ (title)|Christ]]'s [[Second Coming]].\n\nIn the late 1980s, Koresh and his followers abandoned many Branch Davidian teachings. Koresh became the group's self-proclaimed final prophet. \"Koreshians\" were the majority resulting from the schism among the Branch Davidians, but some of the Branch Davidians did not join Koresh's group and instead gathered around [[George Roden]] or became independent. Following a series of violent shootouts between Roden's and Koresh's group, the Mount Carmel compound was eventually taken over by the \"Koreshians\".\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Cult]]\n* [[Apocalypticism]]\n* [[List of new religious movements]]\n* [[List of Christian denominations]]\n* [[Millenarianism]]\n* [[Religious violence]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n37.) https://www.amazon.com/Waco-Untold-Koresh-Identity-Davidians/dp/0999802607/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Waco+Untold&qid=1583005536&sr=8-1\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.bdsda.com The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists]\n \n{{Branch Davidians}}\n{{Sabbath-Keeping Churches}}\n{{Religiously motivated suicides}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1959 establishments in Texas]]\n[[Category:Christian organizations established in 1959]]\n[[Category:Organizations based in Texas]]\n[[Category:Branch Davidianism]]\n[[Category:Right-wing militia organizations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Adventism]]\n[[Category:Christian denominations established in the 20th century]]\n[[Category:Paramilitary organizations based in the United States]]\n[[Category:Religious paramilitary organizations]]\n[[Category:Christian new religious movements]]\n[[Category:Religious controversies]]\n[[Category:Waco siege]]\n", "name_user": "Vanisaac", "label": "safe", "comment": "Correcting spelling: febuary->February", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_Davidians"}

It is a multirole fighter for all-weather, [[Air combat manoeuvring|air-to-air]] and [[air interdiction|air-to-surface deep interdiction]] missions.\n\nThe Su-30 started out as an internal development project in the [[Sukhoi Su-27]] family by Sukhoi. The design plan was revamped and the name was made official by the Russian Defense Ministry in 1996. Of the Flanker family, the [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27]], Su-30, [[Sukhoi Su-33|Su-33]], [[Su-34]] and [[Sukhoi Su-35|Su-35]] have been ordered into limited or serial production by the Defense Ministry.  The Su-30 has two distinct version branches, manufactured by competing organisations: [[KnAAPO]] and the [[Irkut (company)|Irkut Corporation]], both of which come under the Sukhoi group's umbrella.\n\nKnAAPO manufactures the [[Sukhoi Su-30MKK|Su-30MKK]] and the Su-30MK2, which were designed for and sold to China, and later Indonesia, Uganda, Venezuela, and Vietnam. Due to KnAAPO's involvement from the early stages of developing [[Sukhoi Su-35|Su-35]], these are basically a two-seat version of the mid-1990s Su-35. The Chinese chose an older but lighter [[radar]] so the [[Canard (aeronautics)|canards]] could be omitted in return for increased payload. It is a fighter with both [[air supremacy]] and attack capabilities, generally similar to the U.S. [[F-15E Strike Eagle]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowtopnews.com/?area=postView&id=1669 |title=Russia-Libya in billion-dollar arms deal |publisher=Moscow Top News |accessdate=6 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407070541/http://www.moscowtopnews.com/?area=postView&id=1669 |archive-date=7 April 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIrkut traditionally served the [[Soviet Air Defense]] and, in the early years of Flanker development, was given the responsibility of manufacturing the Su-27UB, the two-seat trainer version. When India showed interests in the Su-30, Irkut offered the multirole [[Sukhoi Su-30MKI|Su-30MKI]], which originated as the Su-27UB modified with avionics appropriate for fighters. Along with its ground-attack capabilities, the series adds features for the air-superiority role, such as [[Canard (aeronautics)|canards]], [[Thrust vectoring|thrust-vectoring]], and a long-range [[passive electronically scanned array|phased-array radar]]. Its derivatives include the Su-30MKM, MKA, and SM for Malaysia, Algeria, and Russia, respectively.  The Russian Air Force operates several Su-30s and has ordered the Su-30SM version.\n\n==Development==\nWhile the original [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27]] had good range, it still did not have enough range for the [[Soviet Air Defense Forces]] (PVO, as opposed to VVS \u2013 the [[Soviet Air Force]]). The Air Defense Forces needed to cover the vast expanse of the Soviet Union. Hence, development began in 1986 on the Su-27PU, an improved-capability variant of the Su-27 capable of serving as a long-range [[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] or airborne command post.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mars.slupsk.pl/fort/sukhoi/su-30-ru-27pu.htm|title=Project T-10PU Heavy interceptor fighter Su-27PU (Su-30)|first=Mariusz Wojciechowski|last=S\u0142upsk|access-date=17 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222064006/http://www.mars.slupsk.pl/fort/sukhoi/su-30-ru-27pu.htm|archive-date=22 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe two-seat Su-27UB combat trainer was selected as the basis for the Su-27PU, because it had the performance of a single-seat Su-27 with seating for two crew members.  A \"proof-of-concept\" demonstrator flew 6 June 1987, and this success led to the kick-off of development work on two Su-27PU prototypes.

It is a multirole fighter for all-weather, [[Air combat manoeuvring|air-to-air]] and [[air interdiction|air-to-surface deep interdiction]] missions.\n\nThe Su-30 started out as an internal development project in the [[Sukhoi Su-27]] family by Sukhoi. The design plan was revamped and the name was made official by the Russian Defense Ministry in 1996. Of the Flanker family, the [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27]], Su-30, [[Sukhoi Su-33|Su-33]], [[Su-34]] and [[Sukhoi Su-35|Su-35]] have been ordered into limited or serial production by the Defense Ministry.  The Su-30 has two distinct version branches, manufactured by competing organisations: [[KnAAPO]] and the [[Irkut (company)|Irkut Corporation]], both of which come under the Sukhoi group's umbrella.\n\nKnAAPO manufactures the [[Sukhoi Su-30MKK|Su-30MKK]] and the Su-30MK2, which were designed for and sold to China, and later Indonesia, Uganda, Venezuela, and Vietnam. Due to KnAAPO's involvement from the early stages of developing [[Sukhoi Su-35|Su-35]], these are basically a two-seat version of the mid-1990s Su-35. The Chinese chose an older but lighter [[radar]] so the [[Canard (aeronautics)|canards]] could be omitted in return for increased payload. It is a fighter with both [[air supremacy]] and attack capabilities, generally similar to the U.S. [[F-15E Strike Eagle]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowtopnews.com/?area=postView&id=1669 |title=Russia-Libya in billion-dollar arms deal |publisher=Moscow Top News |accessdate=6 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407070541/http://www.moscowtopnews.com/?area=postView&id=1669 |archive-date=7 April 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIrkut traditionally served the [[Soviet Air Defense]] and, in the early years of Flanker development, was given the responsibility of manufacturing the Su-27UB, the two-seat trainer version. When India showed interests in the Su-30, Irkut offered the multirole [[Sukhoi Su-30MKI|Su-30MKI]], which originated as the Su-27UB modified with avionics appropriate for fighters. Along with its ground-attack capabilities, the series adds features for the air-superiority role, such as [[Canard (aeronautics)|canards]], [[Thrust vectoring|thrust-vectoring]], and a long-range [[passive electronically scanned array|phased-array radar]]. Its derivatives include the Su-30MKM, MKA, and SM for Malaysia, Algeria, and Russia, respectively.  The Russian Air Force operates several Su-30s and has ordered the Su-30SM version.\n\n==Development==\nWhile the original [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27]] had good range, it still did not have enough range for the [[Soviet Air Defense Forces]] (PVO, as opposed to VVS \u2013 the [[Soviet Air Force]]). The Air Defense Forces needed to cover the vast expanse of the Soviet Union. Hence, development began in 1986 on the Su-27PU, an improved-capability variant of the Su-27 capable of serving as a long-range [[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] or airborne command post.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mars.slupsk.pl/fort/sukhoi/su-30-ru-27pu.htm|title=Project T-10PU Heavy interceptor fighter Su-27PU (Su-30)|first=Mariusz Wojciechowski|last=S\u0142upsk|access-date=17 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222064006/http://www.mars.slupsk.pl/fort/sukhoi/su-30-ru-27pu.htm|archive-date=22 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe two-seat Su-27UB combat trainer was selected as the basis for the Su-27PU, because it had the performance of a single-seat Su-27 with seating for two crew members.  A \"proof-of-concept\" demonstrator flew 6 June 1987, and this success led to the kick-off of development work on two Su-27PU prototypes. The first Su-27PU flew at Irkutsk on 31 December 1989, and the first of three pre-production models flew on 14 April 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airvectors.net/avsu27_2.html#m1|title=Second-Generation Su-27s & Derivatives|author=Greg Goebel/chapter 2 of 2/ public domain|accessdate=17 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222140354/http://www.airvectors.net/avsu27_2.html#m1|archive-date=22 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Sukhoi Su-30LL demonstrator flying along the runway at Zhangjiajie Hehua Airport less than 1 metre off the ground.jpg|thumb|right|Russian Air Force Sukhoi Su-30LL flying along the runway at [[Zhangjiajie Hehua Airport]] extremely close to the ground piloted by [[Anatoly Kvochur]] ]]\n\nThe Su-30 is a [[Multirole combat aircraft|multirole fighter.]] It has a two-seat cockpit with an [[Air brake (aircraft)|airbrake]] behind the canopy.\n\n===Flight characteristics===\nThe integrated aerodynamic configuration, combined with the [[thrust vectoring]] control ability, results in high manoeuvrability and unique takeoff and landing characteristics. Equipped with a digital [[fly-by-wire]] system, the Su-30 is able to perform some very advanced manoeuvres, including the [[Pugachev's Cobra]] and the [[tailslide]]. These manoeuvers quickly decelerate the aircraft, causing a pursuing fighter to overshoot, as well as breaking a [[Doppler radar|Doppler]] [[Radar lock-on|radar-lock]], as the relative speed of the aircraft drops below the threshold where the signal registers to the radar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/ucacres/PCES.pdf |title=Discovering Novel Fighter Combat Maneuvers. |accessdate=17 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607103641/http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/ucacres/PCES.pdf |archive-date=7 June 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Powerplant===\nThe aircraft's powerplant incorporates two Saturn [[AL-31]]F [[afterburner|afterburning]] [[low-bypass turbofan]] engines, fed through [[intake ramp]]s.
