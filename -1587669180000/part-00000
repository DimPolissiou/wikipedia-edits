This name is also used for them by at least some Glebo speakers as {{IPA|[w\u00e8\u01ceo]}}.\n<ref>H&J, p. 6.{{nonspecific|date=November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe term is not a mere variant of the word ''Jabo'', as might be assumed.\nIt is, rather, defined as the name of \"a group of five tribes\" or \"a language\".\nIt properly designates a certain [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] descent group (in this case a \"sub-tribe\"), within the larger group (\"Jabo [[tribe]]\").  It may be conjectured to have as an [[eponym]] the common personal name ''(g)wea''.\n\n''Gweabo'' was originally incorrectly generalized to apply to the larger group (the Jabo confederation) because [[Edward Sapir|Sapir's]] Jabo informant\n<ref>Charles Blooah, b. abt. 1904, d. 30 January 1978, in Colorado.{{nonspecific|date=November 2018}}</ref>\nwas a member of that sub-tribe.\n\nAmong the subdivisions of the Gweabo sub-tribe mentioned in ''Jabo Proverbs from Liberia'' are:\n:*{{IPA|[b\u02b1\u1ecd\u030fl\u1ecd\u0300kw\u1ebd\u0300\u1ebd]}}\n:*{{IPA|[\u0261b\u0254\u030fl\u0254\u0300 \u0261wl\u1ecdbo]}}\n:*{{IPA|[\u0272\u1ea1b\u1ecd\u0301]}}\n\n==Nimiah==\nBlooah sometimes also claimed to be a member of the \"Nimiah tribe;\" sometimes Nimiah was called a township.  As mentioned above, it corresponds to a Liberian administrative clan. The pronunciation in Jabo which was recorded was \n{{IPA|[n\u0129\u0301w\u0324i\u032f\u1eb9\u0303]}}.\n\n==Classification==\nDealing with a people with little recorded history and for which little detailed [[ethnography|ethnographic]] information is available, the most reliable framework for placing them with respect to related peoples is the classification of their language.\n\nJabo clearly belongs within the [[Kru languages|Kru]] family of Niger\u2013Congo languages. For further discussion, see the article [[Grebo people]].\n\n===Jabo and Grebo===\nA certain amount of confusion is created by the fact that many sources treat \"Jabo\" as being either identical with, or as a subgroup of [[Grebo people|Grebo]].  For a discussion of this see the article [[Jabo (language)]].\n\n===Geographical factors===\nAlthough the Jabo area is adjacent to the Seaside Grebo area to the east-southeast, the two are separated by the Deeah (Die or Decoris) River, which is often treacherous and difficult to cross, especially during the rainy season or when a strong tide is running in the estuary.<ref>H&J, pp. 80-81.{{nonspecific|date=November 2018}}</ref>  Because of the lack of usable roads connecting them, the Jabo tend to go northwest to market, into a [[Kru people|Kru]]-oriented area at the county seat of ([[Barclayville]]) and Garraway, north to Bewehn, or sometimes northeast to [[Plibo]], rarely to the commercial and government center in [[Harper, Liberia|Harper]].  This tends to emphasize mutual affinity and intercommunication with the Klao (Krao or \"[[Kru people|Kru]] Proper\"), rather than with the Seaside Grebo.  They are also located in the same newly created (1984) county as the Klao ([[Grand Kru County]]), unlike the Glebo in [[Maryland County]], from which they are once again politically separated.\n\n==Exogamy==\nA cultural trait present among the Jabo, and apparently widespread across the Kru group is the practice of [[virilocality|virilocal]] [[exogamy]].<ref>WPA{{nonspecific|date=November 2018}}</ref>  This is enforced as a [[taboo]] at the clan level, but in practice, many also marry outside their tribe.  The extent of this practice is obviously limited by the difficult transportation situation.<ref>As of 2006-02-25 there were no motorable long- or medium- distance roads in either Grand Kru or Maryland County.  Barclayville, the county seat of Grand Kru County, is inaccessible.[http://www.humanitarianinfo.org/liberia/assessments/others/doc/STATUS%20OF%20ROADS%20IN%20LIBERIA%20AS%20ON%2025%20Jan%202006.pdf_20060313.pdf]</ref>  Nonetheless, the exogamy factor has a certain effect of heightening intergroup awareness and communication.  It remains to be seen how this will be affected by the refugee situation and urbanization.\n\n==Allegations of ritual murder and cannibalism==\nIn researching the literature pertaining to the Jabo, one may occasionally come upon references to them practising [[cannibalism]].  This is not merely a [[canard]] or [[blood libel]].  Charles Blooah, Sapir's Jabo informant, apparently made no secret of the fact.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of widespread violence during the Liberian civil war, reports of ritual murder and cannibalism seem scarcely to rise to the level of newsworthiness.  Yet the inhabitants of the Cape Palmas region have been repeatedly characterized since at least 1668<ref>Liberia: Past and Present: \t\t</ref> as having this practice culturally entrenched among themselves.  Considering the practice's links to Liberian internal politics and secret societies ([[Human leopards|Leopard Men]]), which cut across all social strata, and considering also a sensational legal proceeding in Maryland county in 1977, there is no reason to hope that the practice or its associated belief system has abated or been extirpated.  This is not intended to convey the impression that such practices are limited to this area of [[Africa]] alone.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n[HDS] Herzog, George. \"Drum Signaling in a West African Tribe,\" ''Word'' 1:217-38, 1945.

They are also located in the same newly created (1984) county as the Klao ([[Grand Kru County]]), unlike the Glebo in [[Maryland County]], from which they are once again politically separated.\n\n==Exogamy==\nA cultural trait present among the Jabo, and apparently widespread across the Kru group is the practice of [[virilocality|virilocal]] [[exogamy]].<ref>WPA</ref>  This is enforced as a [[taboo]] at the clan level, but in practice, many also marry outside their tribe.  The extent of this practice is obviously limited by the difficult transportation situation.<ref>As of 2006-02-25 there were no motorable long- or medium- distance roads in either Grand Kru or Maryland County.  Barclayville, the county seat of Grand Kru County, is inaccessible.[http://www.humanitarianinfo.org/liberia/assessments/others/doc/STATUS%20OF%20ROADS%20IN%20LIBERIA%20AS%20ON%2025%20Jan%202006.pdf_20060313.pdf]</ref>  Nonetheless, the exogamy factor has a certain effect of heightening intergroup awareness and communication.  It remains to be seen how this will be affected by the refugee situation and urbanization.\n\n==Allegations of ritual murder and cannibalism==\nIn researching the literature pertaining to the Jabo, one may occasionally come upon references to them practising [[cannibalism]].  This is not merely a [[canard]] or [[blood libel]].  Charles Blooah, Sapir's Jabo informant, apparently made no secret of the fact.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of widespread violence during the Liberian civil war, reports of ritual murder and cannibalism seem scarcely to rise to the level of newsworthiness.  Yet the inhabitants of the Cape Palmas region have been repeatedly characterized since at least 1668<ref>Liberia: Past and Present: \t\t</ref> as having this practice culturally entrenched among themselves.  Considering the practice's links to Liberian internal politics and secret societies ([[Human leopards|Leopard Men]]), which cut across all social strata, and considering also a sensational legal proceeding in Maryland county in 1977, there is no reason to hope that the practice or its associated belief system has abated or been extirpated.  This is not intended to convey the impression that such practices are limited to this area of [[Africa]] alone.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n[HDS] Herzog, George. \"Drum Signaling in a West African Tribe,\" ''Word'' 1:217-38, 1945.

{"title_page": "History of Minnesota", "text_new": "economy is now driven by banking, computers, and health care.\n\nThe earliest known settlers followed herds of large game to the region during the [[last glacial period]]. They preceded the [[Anishinaabe]], the [[Sioux|Dakota]], and other Native American inhabitants. [[Fur trade]]rs from France arrived during the 17th century. Europeans moving west during the 19th century, drove out most of the Native Americans. [[Fort Snelling]], built to protect United States territorial interests, brought early settlers to the area.  Early settlers used [[Saint Anthony Falls]] for powering sawmills in the area that became [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], while others settled downriver in the area that became [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]].\n\nMinnesota gained legal existence as the [[Minnesota Territory]] in 1849, and became [[List of U.S. states by date of statehood|the 32nd U.S. state]] on May 11, 1858. After the upheaval of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Dakota War of 1862]], the state's economy started to develop when natural resources were tapped for logging and farming. Railroads attracted immigrants, established the farm economy, and brought goods to market. The power provided by St. Anthony Falls spurred the growth of Minneapolis, and the innovative milling methods gave it the title of the \"milling capital of the world\".\n\nNew industry came from iron ore, discovered in the north, mined relatively easily from [[open-pit mining|open pits]], and shipped to [[Great Lakes]] steel mills from the ports at [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]] and [[Two Harbors, Minnesota|Two Harbors]]. Economic development and social changes led to an expanded role for state government and a population shift from rural areas to cities. The [[Great Depression]] brought layoffs in mining and tension in labor relations but [[New Deal]] programs helped the state. After World War II, Minnesota became known for technology, fueled by early computer companies [[Sperry Rand]], [[Control Data]] and [[Cray]]. The [[Minneapolis-St. Paul|Twin Cities]] also became a regional center for the arts with cultural institutions such as the [[Guthrie Theater]], [[Minnesota Orchestra]], and the [[Walker Art Center]].\n\n==Native American inhabitation==\n[[File:SchumannCache.JPG|thumb|right|Some of the oldest stone tools found in Minnesota]]\nThe oldest known human remains in Minnesota, dating back about 9000 years ago, were discovered near [[Browns Valley, Minnesota|Browns Valley]] in 1933.  \"Browns Valley Man\" was found with tools of the [[Clovis Point|Clovis]] and [[Folsom point|Folsom]] types.<ref>{{cite book |last = Anfinson | first = Scott F. | title = Southwestern Minnesota Archaeology: 12,000 years in the Prairie Lakes Region | publisher = Minnesota Historical Society | year = 1997 | location = Saint Paul | pages = 30\u201332 | isbn = 0-87351-355-X }}</ref>  Some of the earliest evidence of a sustained presence in the area comes from a site known as [[Bradbury Brook]] near [[Mille Lacs Lake]] which was used around 7500 BC.<ref>{{cite web | title=TimePieces: Work Site| url=http://events.mnhs.org/TimePieces/EventDetail.cfm?EventID=577 | publisher=Minnesota Historical Society | accessdate=2007-02-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221115122/http://events.mnhs.org/Timepieces/EventDetail.cfm?EventID=577|archivedate=2007-02-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> Subsequently, extensive trading networks developed in the region.

As large animals such as [[mammoths]] became extinct, native people changed their diet.  They gathered nuts, berries, and vegetables, and they hunted smaller animals such as deer, bison, and birds.  The stone tools found from this era became smaller and more specialized to use these new food sources.

The western portion of the state was part of the [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Spanish Louisiana]] since the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]], in 1762. The wording of the treaty in the Minnesota area depended on landmarks reported by fur traders, who erroneously reported an \"Isle Phelipeaux\" in Lake Superior, a \"Long Lake\" west of the island, and the belief that the Mississippi River ran well into modern Canada.  Most of the state was purchased in 1803 from France as part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]].  Parts of northern Minnesota were considered to be in [[Rupert's Land]].

They lived at the fort and elsewhere in territories where slavery was prohibited.  After Emerson's death, the Scotts argued that since they had lived in free territory, they were no longer slaves.

It served as a training center for soldiers during the [[American Civil War]] and later as the headquarters for the Department of Dakota.  A portion has been designated as [[Fort Snelling National Cemetery]] where over 160,000 are interred. During World War II, the fort served as a training center for nearly 300,000 inductees.  After World War II, the fort was threatened with demolition due to the building of freeways [[Minnesota State Highway 5|Highway 5]] and [[Minnesota State Highway 55|Highway 55]], but citizens rallied to save it.  Fort Snelling is now a historic site operated by the [[Minnesota Historical Society]].<ref name=\"hfs\"/>\n\nFort Snelling was largely responsible for the establishment of the city of [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]].  In an effort to be self-sufficient, the soldiers of the fort built roads, planted crops, and built a [[grist mill]] and a sawmill at [[Saint Anthony Falls]].<ref name=\"hfs\"/>  Later, [[Franklin Steele]] came to Fort Snelling as the post [[sutler]] (the operator of the general store), and established interests in lumbering and other activities.  When the Ojibwe signed a treaty ceding lands in 1837, Steele staked a claim to land on the east side of the Mississippi River adjacent to Saint Anthony Falls.  In 1848, he built a sawmill at the falls, and the community of Saint Anthony sprung up around the east side of the falls.  Steele told one of his employees, [[John H. Stevens]], that land on the west side of the falls would make a good site for future mills.  Since the land on the west side was still part of the military reservation, Stevens made a deal with Fort Snelling's commander.  Stevens would provide free ferry service across the river in exchange for a tract of {{convert|160|acre|km2}} at the head of the falls.  Stevens received the claim and built a house, the first house in Minneapolis, in 1850. In 1854, Stevens platted the city of Minneapolis on the west bank.<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 70\u20131</ref>  Later, in 1872, Minneapolis absorbed the city of Saint Anthony.<ref>Risjord 2005, p. 73</ref>\n\nThe city of [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] owes its existence to Fort Snelling.  A group of [[squatter]]s, mostly from the ill-fated [[Red River Colony]] in what is now the Canadian province of [[Manitoba]], established a camp near the fort.  The commandant of Fort Snelling, Major [[Joseph Plympton]], found their presence problematic because they were using timber and allowing their cattle and horses to graze around the fort.  Plympton banned lumbering and the construction of any new buildings on the military reservation land.  As a result, the squatters moved four miles downstream on the Mississippi River.<ref>Lass 1998, p. 99</ref> They settled at a site known as Fountain Cave.  This site was not quite far enough for the officers at the fort, so the squatters were forced out again. [[Pierre Parrant|Pierre \"Pig's Eye\" Parrant]], a popular [[moonshine]]r among the group, moved downriver and established a saloon, becoming the first European resident in the area that later became Saint Paul.  The squatters named their settlement \"Pig's Eye\" after Parrant.  The name was later changed to Lambert's Landing and then finally Saint Paul.

Loggers found the [[Eastern White Pine|white pine]] especially valuable, and it was plentiful in the northeastern section of the state and in the [[St. Croix River (Wisconsin-Minnesota)|St. Croix River]] valley.  Before railroads, lumbermen relied mostly on river transportation to bring logs to market, which made Minnesota's timber resources attractive.  Towns like [[Pine City, Minnesota|Pine City]], [[Marine on St. Croix, Minnesota|Marine on St. Croix]] and [[Stillwater, Minnesota|Stillwater]] became important lumber centers fed by the St. Croix River, while [[Winona, Minnesota|Winona]] was supplied lumber by areas in southern Minnesota and along the Minnesota River.

In 1846, he prevented Iowa from including [[Fort Snelling]] and Saint Anthony Falls within its northern border.  In 1847, he kept the organizers of [[Wisconsin]] from including Saint Paul and Saint Anthony Falls.<ref>Risjord 2005, p. 62</ref>  The [[Minnesota Territory]] was established from the lands remaining from [[Iowa Territory]] and [[Wisconsin Territory]] on March 3, 1849. The Minnesota Territory extended far into what is now North Dakota and South Dakota, to the [[Missouri River]]. There was a dispute over the shape of the state to be carved out of Minnesota Territory. An alternate proposal that was only narrowly defeated would have made the 46th parallel the state's northern border and the Missouri River its western border, thus giving up the whole northern half of the state in exchange for the eastern half of what later became South Dakota.<ref>{{cite book| last = Meinig| first = D.W.| title = The Shaping of America: A Geographical Perspective on 500 Years of History, Volume 2: Continental America, 1800-1867| publisher = Yale University Press| year = 1993| location = New Haven, CT| page = 439| isbn = 0-300-05658-3 }}</ref>\n\nWith [[Alexander Ramsey]] [[Whig Party (United States)|(W)]] as the first governor of Minnesota Territory and [[Henry Hastings Sibley]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|(D)]] as the territorial delegate to the United States Congress, the populations of Saint Paul and Saint Anthony swelled.

Rice's enabling act defined a state containing both prairie and forest lands. The state was bounded on the south by Iowa, on the east by Wisconsin, on the north by Canada, and on the west by the [[Red River of the North]] and the [[Bois de Sioux River]], [[Lake Traverse]], [[Big Stone Lake]], and then a line extending due south to the Iowa border. Rice made this motion based on Minnesota's population growth.<ref>Lass 1998, p. 124</ref>\n\nAt the time, tensions between the northern and the southern United States were growing, in [[Origins of the American Civil War|a series of conflicts]] that eventually resulted in the American Civil War. There was little debate in the [[United States House of Representatives]], but when [[Stephen A. Douglas]] introduced the bill in the [[United States Senate]], it caused a firestorm of debate. Northerners saw their chance to add two senators to the side of the [[free state (United States)|free states]], while Southerners were sure that they would lose power. Many senators offered polite arguments that the population was too sparse and that statehood was premature. Senator [[John Burton Thompson]] of Kentucky, in particular, argued that new states would cost the government too much for roads, canals, forts, and lighthouses. Although Thompson and 21 other senators voted against statehood, the enabling act was passed on February 26, 1857.<ref>Lass 1998, pp. 122\u20134</ref>\n\nAfter the enabling act was passed, territorial legislators had a difficult time writing a state constitution. A [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] was assembled in July 1857, but Republicans and Democrats were deeply divided. In fact, they formed two separate constitutional conventions and drafted two separate constitutions. Eventually, the two groups formed a conference committee and worked out a common constitution. The divisions continued, though, because Republicans refused to sign a document that had Democratic signatures on it, and vice versa. One copy of the constitution was written on white paper and signed only by Republicans, while the other copy was written on blue-tinged paper and signed by Democrats. These copies were signed on August 29, 1857. An election was called on October 13, 1857, where Minnesota residents would vote to approve or disapprove the constitution. The constitution was approved by 30,055 voters, while 571 rejected it.<ref name=\"sos\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.state.mn.us/student/mncnote.html|title=Minnesota Secretary of State \u2013 History/Old Stuff|publisher=Minnesota Secretary of State|accessdate=2008-04-17|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515034658/http://www.sos.state.mn.us/student/mncnote.html|archivedate=2008-05-15}}</ref>\n\nThe state constitution was sent to the [[United States Congress]] for ratification in December 1857. The approval process was drawn out for several months while Congress debated over issues that had stemmed from the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]. Southerners had been arguing that the next state should be pro-slavery, so when Kansas submitted the pro-slavery [[Lecompton Constitution]], the Minnesota statehood bill was delayed. After that, Northerners feared that Minnesota's Democratic delegation would support slavery in Kansas. Finally, after the Kansas question was settled and after Congress decided how many representatives Minnesota would get in the House of Representatives, the bill passed.<ref>Lass 1998, pp. 125\u20136</ref> The eastern half of the Minnesota Territory, under the boundaries defined by Henry Mower Rice, became the country's 32nd state on May 11, 1858.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj049101))|title=Journal of the Senate of the United States of America, 35th Congress, 1st Session, Tuesday, May 11, 1858, p. 436.}}</ref> The western part remained unorganized until its incorporation into the [[Dakota Territory]] on March 2, 1861.\n\n==Civil War era and Dakota War of 1862==\n{{Hatnote|\"Minnesota in the American Civil War\" redirects here.}}\nMinnesota strongly supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] war effort, with about 22,000 Minnesotans serving.

The Dakota had signed the [[Treaty of Traverse des Sioux]] and [[Treaty of Mendota]] in 1851 because they were concerned that without money from the United States government, they would starve, due to the loss of habitat of huntable game.  They were initially given a strip of land of ten miles (16&nbsp;km) north and south of the [[Minnesota River]], but they were later forced to sell the northern half of the land.  In 1862, crop failures left the Dakota with food shortages, and government money was delayed.  After four young Dakota men, searching for food, shot a family of white settlers near Acton, the Dakota leadership decided to continue the attacks in an effort to drive out the settlers.  Over a period of several days, Dakota attacks at the [[Lower Sioux Agency]], [[New Ulm, Minnesota|New Ulm]] and [[Hutchinson, Minnesota|Hutchinson]], as well as in the surrounding farmlands, resulted in the deaths of at least 300 to 400 white settlers and government employees, causing panic in the settlements and provoking counterattacks by state militia and federal forces which spread throughout the [[Minnesota River|Minnesota River Valley]] and as far away as the [[Red River Valley]].<ref>Carley, Kenneth.

Minnesota's population in 1870 was 439,000; this number tripled during the two subsequent decades.<ref>Lass 1998, p. 136</ref>  The [[Homestead Act]] in 1862 facilitated land claims by settlers, who regarded the land as being cheap and fertile.

The movement grew out of his interest in cooperative farm associations following the end of the Civil War, and he established local Grange chapters in [[Elk River, Minnesota|Elk River]] and Saint Paul.  The organization worked to provide education on new farming methods, as well as to influence government and public opinion on matters important to farmers.  One of these areas of concern was the freight rates charged by the railroads and by the [[grain elevator]]s.  Since there was little or no competition between railroads serving Minnesota farm communities, railroads could charge as much as the traffic would bear.  By 1871, the situation was so heated that both the Republican and Democratic candidates in state elections promised to regulate railroad rates.  The state established an office of railroad commissioner and imposed maximum charges for shipping. [[populism|Populist]] [[Ignatius L. Donnelly]] also served the Grange as an organizer.<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 145\u20138</ref>\n\n[[Saint Anthony Falls]], the only waterfall of its height on the Mississippi, played an important part in the development of Minneapolis.  The power of the waterfall first fueled sawmills, but later it was tapped to serve flour mills.  In 1870, only a small number of flour mills were in the Minneapolis area, but by 1900 Minnesota mills were grinding 14.1% of the nation's grain.  Advances in transportation, milling technology, and water power combined to give Minneapolis a dominance in the milling industry.  Spring wheat could be sown in the spring and harvested in late summer, but it posed special problems for milling.  To get around these problems, Minneapolis millers made use of new technology.  They invented the [[middlings purifier]], a device that used jets of air to remove the husks from the flour early in the milling process.  They also started using roller mills, as opposed to grindstones.  A series of rollers gradually broke down the kernels and integrated the [[gluten]] with the [[starch]].  These improvements led to the production of \"patent\" flour, which commanded almost double the price of \"bakers\" or \"clear\" flour, which it replaced.<ref>{{cite web| last =Hazen| first =Theodore R.| title =New Process Milling of 1850\u201370| publisher =Pond Lily Mill Restorations| url =http://www.angelfire.com/journal/millrestoration/newprocess.html| accessdate = 2007-05-11}}</ref> [[Pillsbury Company|Pillsbury]] and the Washburn-Crosby Company (a forerunner of [[General Mills]]) became the leaders in the Minneapolis milling industry.

The [[Vermilion Range (Minnesota)|Vermilion Range]] was surveyed and mapped by a party financed by [[Charlemagne Tower]].  Another mining town, [[Ely, Minnesota|Ely]] began with the foundation of the Chandler Mine in 1888.  Soon after, the [[Mesabi Range]] was established when ore was found just under the surface of the ground in [[Mountain Iron, Minnesota|Mountain Iron]].  The Mesabi Range ultimately had much more ore than the Vermilion Range, and it was easy to extract because the ore was closer to the surface.  As a result, [[open-pit mining|open-pit mines]] became well-established on the Mesabi Range, with 111 mines operating by 1904.  To ship the iron ore to refineries, railroads such as the [[Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway]] were built from the iron ranges to [[Two Harbors, Minnesota|Two Harbors]] and Duluth on Lake Superior.  Large ore docks were used at these cities to load the iron ore onto ships for transport east on the [[Great Lakes]].  The mining industry helped to propel Duluth from a small town to a large, thriving city.<ref>Lass 1998, pp. 184\u201395</ref>  In 1904, iron was discovered in the [[Cuyuna Range]] in [[Crow Wing County, Minnesota|Crow Wing County]].

By 1900, the Twin Cities were becoming a center of commerce, led by the [[Minneapolis Grain Exchange]] and the foundation of the [[Federal Reserve Bank]] with its ninth district in Minneapolis.  Many of the businessmen who had made money in the railroad, flour milling, and logging industries lived in the Twin Cities and personified the [[gilded age]]. They started to donate money for cultural institutions such as the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra (now the [[Minnesota Orchestra]]).  The parks of Minneapolis, under the direction of [[Theodore Wirth]] became famous, and the new [[Minnesota State Capitol]] building and the [[Cathedral of Saint Paul (Minnesota)|Cathedral of Saint Paul]] attracted attention to Saint Paul.<ref>Gilman 1991, p. 167</ref>\n\nThe role of government also grew during the early 20th century.  In the rural areas, most people obtained food and manufactured goods from neighbors and other people they knew personally.  As industry and commerce grew, goods such as food, materials, and medicines were no longer made by neighbors, but by large companies.  In response, citizens called on their government for consumer protection, inspection of goods, and regulation of public utilities.<ref>Gilman 1991, pp. 173\u20134</ref>  The growth of the automobile spurred calls to develop roads and to enforce traffic laws.  The state officially started its trunk highway system in 1920, with the passage of the [[Babcock Amendment]] that established 70 [[Constitutional Route]]s around the state.<ref>{{cite web|title=Minnesota's Constitutional Routes|url=http://www.steve-riner.com/mnhighways/conrtes.htm|last=Riner|first=Steve|year=2003|accessdate=2006-07-21}}</ref> New regulation was necessary for banking and insurance.

Business owners were reaping the benefits of this increase in productivity, but they were not sharing it with their employees because of the weakness of [[organized labor]], nor were they sharing it with the public in the form of lowered prices.  Instead, the windfall went to stockholders.  The eventual result was that consumers could no longer afford the goods that factories were producing.<ref>Risjord 2005, p. 190</ref>\n\n[[Floyd B.

In his first term, he signed a bonding bill that authorized $15 million (${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|15000000|1930|r=-7}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) for highway construction, in an effort to provide work for the unemployed.  He also signed an executive order that provided for a minimum wage of 45 cents per hour for up to 48 hours weekly.  This effort predated the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938 that established a nationwide minimum wage.  By 1932, with the Depression worsening, the Farmer-Labor Party platform was proposing a state income tax, a graduated tax on nationwide chain stores (such as [[J.C.

The [[progressivism|progressive]] 1933 legislative session saw a comprehensive response to the depression including a moratorium on mortgage [[foreclosure]]s, a reduction in property taxes for farmers and homeowners, the state income tax, and chain store taxes, tavern reform, ratification of a [[child labor]] amendment, a state old-age pension system, and steps toward preserving the area that later became the [[Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness]].<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 190\u20134</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, formerly quiet labor unions began asserting themselves rather forcefully.  The [[Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934]] turned ugly, with the union demanding the right to speak for all trucking employees.  As a result of this strike and many others across the nation, [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] passed the [[National Labor Relations Act]] in 1935.  Government programs such as the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] and [[Works Progress Administration]] brought much-needed work projects to the state.  Congress passed the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] in 1934, giving Minnesota's Ojibwa and Dakota tribes more autonomy over their own affairs.<ref>Gilman 1991, pp. 192\u20133</ref>\n\n==Modern Minnesota==\n\n===Arts and culture===\nThe [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]] was established in 1883.

In the 1940s, the museum shifted its focus toward modern art, after a gift from Mrs. Gilbert Walker made it possible to acquire works by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], and others. The museum continued its focus on modern art with traveling shows in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://info.walkerart.org/about/history.wac|title=Walker Art Center \u2013 History|accessdate=2006-09-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130141416/http://info.walkerart.org/about/history.wac|archive-date=2011-11-30|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Guthrie Theater]], opened in 1963, was the brainchild of [[Sir Tyrone Guthrie]], who wanted to found a regional theater without the commercial constraints of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. The high cost of staging Broadway productions meant that shows had to be immediately successful and return a high amount of revenue. This discouraged innovation and experimentation, and made it difficult to stage important works of literature. These ideas were first disseminated in a 1959 article in the drama section of the ''New York Times'', and citizens in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area were eager to support the idea. The theater served as a prototype for other resident non-profit theaters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guthrietheater.org/INSIDETHEGUTHRIE/TheaterHistory/tabid/83/Default.aspx|title=Theater History|publisher=Guthrie Theater|accessdate=2006-09-24|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070106133409/http://www.guthrietheater.org/INSIDETHEGUTHRIE/TheaterHistory/tabid/83/Default.aspx |archivedate = January 6, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Minnesota in World War II===\n[[File:snellingbldgs.jpg|thumb|right|Most of the 400 structures at Fort Snelling began falling into disrepair after the fort closed in 1946.]]\nLike other U.S. States, Minnesota made its contributions to the effort of World War II in wartime manufacturing and other areas. The [[United States Navy]] contracted with [[Cargill]] to build ships after seeing their success in building ships and barges used to haul grain. Cargill built facilities in [[Savage, Minnesota]] on the south bank of the Minnesota River and turned out 18 refueling ships and four towboats in four years.

The United States government built the Twin Cities Ordnance Plant to produce munitions.  The plant employed 8,500 workers in 1941, and since there was a shortage of male workers during the war, more than half of the workers at the munitions plant were women.  The plant also employed nearly 1000 African American workers, as President Roosevelt had issued an executive order forbidding racial discrimination in defense industries.  Native American workers also found opportunities due to workforce shortages in wartime.\n\n<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 209\u201310</ref>\n\nSavage was also the home of [[Camp Savage]], a school designed to improve the foreign language skills of Japanese-American soldiers and to train them in military intelligence gathering.  The school was originally established in San Francisco, but moved to Minnesota after the bombing of [[Pearl Harbor]].  Eventually, the school outgrew its facilities in Savage and was moved to [[Fort Snelling]].<ref name=\"savage\"/>  Fort Snelling itself served a major role as a reception center for newly drafted recruits after the [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940|Selective Service Act]] was passed in 1940.  New recruits were given a physical exam and the Army General Qualification Test to determine their fitness for service in a particular branch.  The most intelligent recruits, about 37% of Minnesotans going through Fort Snelling, were assigned to the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]].  Recruits were also issued uniforms and sent from the fort to other training centers.  Over 300,000 recruits were processed through Fort Snelling during the World War II years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/people/mngg/investigate/fswwii.htm|title=Minnesota's Greatest Generation \u2013 Investigate Further \u2013 Fort Snelling's Last War|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society|accessdate=2006-12-30}}</ref>\n\n===Modern economy===\n{{Main|Economy of Minnesota}}\nAgriculture evolved from an individual occupation into a major industry after World War II.  Technological developments increased productivity on farms, such as automation of [[feedlot]]s for hogs and cattle, machine milking at dairy farms, and raising chickens in large buildings.  Planting also became more specialized with [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] of corn and wheat, fertilization, and mechanical equipment such as tractors and [[combine harvester|combines]] became the norm.  University of Minnesota professor [[Norman Borlaug]] contributed to this knowledge as part of the [[Green Revolution]].<ref>Gilman 1991, pp. 196-8</ref> Large canneries such as the [[Green Giant|Minnesota Valley Canning Company]] fed the country from Minnesota's productive farmland.\n\nThe [[3M|Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company]] (3M) was founded in 1902 in [[Two Harbors, Minnesota]], and was later moved to Duluth, Saint Paul, and then [[Maplewood, Minnesota|Maplewood]].

Misa, ''Digital State: The Story of Minnesota's Computing Industry'' (2013)</ref>\n\n===Postwar politics===\n{{See also|Politics of Minnesota}}\n\nHistorian Annette Atkins has explored the changing long-term pattern of Minnesota politics.  In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the heavily rural state was hostile to business and railroads, with the Republicans dominant in the small towns, and the Democrats on the farms.  Numerous left-wing groups and third-parties emerged, such as the Anti-Monopolist party in the 1870s, the Populists in the 1890s, the Non-Partisan League in the 1910s, and the Farmer-Labor party in the 1930s.  Isolationism was strong, Atkins argues, because of the fear that Eastern bankers and industrialists forced the United States into World War I to enlarge their profits. Business fought unions, and the unions fought back, and with the governor on their side unions won some violent battles in the 1930s. In recent decades, however, the liberal coalition has weakened.  Labor unions are a shadow of their old strength.  Most farmers have left for the towns and especially the Twin Cities, where more than half of the people live. The New Right has mobilized social conservatives, especially those from traditional religious backgrounds, with abortion a furiously contested issue.  State government has become much more friendly toward growth and the needs of business entrepreneurship.  Environmentalism has split left and right, with the industrial workers in the Up North and Iron Range districts demanding that their jobs be protected from environmentalists. Atkins finds that:\n: What makes the North country valuable to conservationists is the seclusion, beauty, isolation, quiet, clear water, and absence of development.  The preservationists have tried to limit or prohibit roads, hydroelectric generators, sawmills and lumbering, resorts, power boats, airplanes, and snowmobiles\u2026.  The tensions between development and preservation, restraint and grows, beauty and jobs runs deep and strong.<ref>Annette Atkins, \"Minnesota\", in James H. Madison, ed., ''Heartland: Comparative Histories of the Midwestern States'' (1988) pp 12-24, quote on 24</ref>\n\n[[File:Hubert Humphrey crop.jpg|thumb|right|Hubert Humphrey]]\n[[Hubert Humphrey]] was a Minnesotan who became a nationally prominent politician. He first ran for mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, but lost the election to the Republican candidate by just a few thousand votes.  As a Democrat, Humphrey recognized that his best chance for political success was to obtain the support of the [[Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party]].  Other members of the Farmer-Labor Party had been considering the idea, as encouraged by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], but the merger only became reality after Humphrey traveled to Washington, D.C. to discuss the issue.  Rather than simply absorbing the Farmer-Labor party, with its constituency of 200,000 voters, Humphrey suggested calling the party the [[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party]].  He was elected mayor of Minneapolis in 1945, and one of his first actions was to propose an ordinance making racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine.  This ordinance was adopted in 1947, and although few fines were issued, the city's banks and department stores realized that public relations would improve by hiring blacks in increasing numbers.<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 211\u20134</ref> Humphrey delivered an impassioned speech at the [[1948 Democratic National Convention]] encouraging the party to adopt a civil rights plank in their platform.  He was elected to the [[United States Senate]] in 1948 and was re-elected in 1954 and 1960.<ref name=\"timepieces42\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/library/tips/history_topics/42humphrey.html|title=History Topics: Hubert H.

In 1963, President [[John F. Kennedy]] sent a comprehensive civil rights bill to Congress, based largely on the ideas that Humphrey had been placing before the Senate for the previous fifteen years.  The bill passed the House in early 1964, but passage through the Senate was more difficult, due to [[Southern United States|southern]] segregationists who [[filibuster]]ed for 75 days.  Finally, in June 1964, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] became law.  Humphrey called this his greatest achievement.<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 219\u201321</ref> [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] recruited Humphrey for his running mate in the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 presidential election]], and Humphrey became [[Vice President of the United States]].  Governor [[Karl Rolvaag]] [[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party|(DFL)]] appointed [[Walter Mondale]] to fill Humphrey's Senate seat.  Humphrey voiced doubts about the 1965 bombings of [[North Vietnam]], which alienated him from Johnson.  He later defended Johnson's conduct of the [[Vietnam War]], alienating himself from [[Liberalism in the United States|liberals]], who were beginning to oppose the war around 1967.  In the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 presidential election]], Humphrey ran against [[Richard Nixon]] and [[American Independent Party|Independent]] candidate [[George Wallace]] and lost the popular vote by only 0.7%.  Humphrey later returned to the Senate in 1971 after Eugene McCarthy left office.<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 221\u20132</ref>\n\n[[Eugene McCarthy]] [[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party|(DFL)]] served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1949 through 1959 and in the United States Senate from 1959 through 1971.  He gained a reputation as an intellectual with strong convictions and integrity.  In 1967, he challenged Lyndon B. Johnson for the presidential nomination, running on an anti-war platform in contrast to Johnson's policies.  His strong support in the New Hampshire primary convinced Johnson to leave the race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/library/tips/history_topics/49mccarthy.html|title=History Topics: Eugene McCarthy|accessdate=2006-09-24|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society}}</ref>\n\nDemocrat [[Walter Mondale]] also achieved national prominence as Vice President under [[Jimmy Carter]].  He served in the Senate from his appointment in 1964 until becoming Vice President in 1977.  In 1984, he ran for President of the United States, choosing [[Geraldine Ferraro]] as his running mate. [[1984 United States presidential election|The election]] proved to be a landslide victory for popular incumbent [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/library/tips/history_topics/50mondale.html|title=History Topics: Walter Mondale|accessdate=2006-09-24|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society}}</ref>  In 2002, just 11 days before election day, when incumbent Senator [[Paul Wellstone]] was killed in a plane crash, Mondale stepped into the race as the Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate.

He spent two years working with a split [[Minnesota Legislature]] to enact a tax and school finance reform package that shifted the source of public education funding from local property taxes to state sales taxes, as well as adding [[excise]] taxes to liquor and cigarettes.  This achievement, dubbed the \"Minnesota Miracle\", was immensely popular.  In the next few years, the Legislature enacted other facets of their \"new liberalism\", including ratification of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], strong environmental laws, increases in workers' compensation and unemployment benefits, and elimination of income taxes for the working poor.<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 222\u20133</ref>  ''Time'' Magazine featured Wendell Anderson and the state in an article entitled, \"Minnesota: A State That Works\".<ref>{{cite news| title = Minnesota: A State That Works| url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,907665,00.html| work = Time Magazine| date = August 13, 1973| accessdate = 2007-01-31\n}} ([http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19730813,00.html see cover])</ref>  In 1976 when Mondale resigned his Senate seat to become Jimmy Carter's running mate, Anderson resigned the governor's seat and turned it over to Lieutenant Governor [[Rudy Perpich]] (DFL), who promptly appointed Anderson to fill Mondale's vacant Senate seat.

Wellstone was known for being a liberal activist, as evidenced by his books ''How the Rural Poor Got Power: Narrative of a Grassroots Organizer'', describing his work with the group Organization for a Better Rice County, and ''The Conscience of a Liberal: Reclaiming the Compassionate Agenda''.

[[Minnesota]] achieved prominence through fur trading, logging, and farming, and later through railroads, and iron mining. While those industries remain important, the state's economy is now driven by banking, computers, and health care.\n\nThe earliest known settlers followed herds of large game to the region during the [[last glacial period]]. They preceded the [[Anishinaabe]], the [[Sioux|Dakota]], and other Native American inhabitants. [[Fur trade]]rs from France arrived during the 17th century. Europeans moving west during the 19th century, drove out most of the Native Americans. [[Fort Snelling]], built to protect United States territorial interests, brought early settlers to the area.  Early settlers used [[Saint Anthony Falls]] for powering sawmills in the area that became [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], while others settled downriver in the area that became [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]].\n\nMinnesota gained legal existence as the [[Minnesota Territory]] in 1849, and became [[List of U.S. states by date of statehood|the 32nd U.S. state]] on May 11, 1858. After the upheaval of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Dakota War of 1862]], the state's economy started to develop when natural resources were tapped for logging and farming. Railroads attracted immigrants, established the farm economy, and brought goods to market. The power provided by St. Anthony Falls spurred the growth of Minneapolis, and the innovative milling methods gave it the title of the \"milling capital of the world\".\n\nNew industry came from iron ore, discovered in the north, mined relatively easily from [[open-pit mining|open pits]], and shipped to [[Great Lakes]] steel mills from the ports at [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]] and [[Two Harbors, Minnesota|Two Harbors]]. Economic development and social changes led to an expanded role for state government and a population shift from rural areas to cities. The [[Great Depression]] brought layoffs in mining and tension in labor relations but [[New Deal]] programs helped the state. After World War II, Minnesota became known for technology, fueled by early computer companies [[Sperry Rand]], [[Control Data]] and [[Cray]]. The [[Minneapolis-St. Paul|Twin Cities]] also became a regional center for the arts with cultural institutions such as the [[Guthrie Theater]], [[Minnesota Orchestra]], and the [[Walker Art Center]].\n\n==Native American inhabitation==\n[[File:SchumannCache.JPG|thumb|right|Some of the oldest stone tools found in Minnesota]]\nThe oldest known human remains in Minnesota, dating back about 9000 years ago, were discovered near [[Browns Valley, Minnesota|Browns Valley]] in 1933.  \"Browns Valley Man\" was found with tools of the [[Clovis Point|Clovis]] and [[Folsom point|Folsom]] types.<ref>{{cite book |last = Anfinson | first = Scott F. | title = Southwestern Minnesota Archaeology: 12,000 years in the Prairie Lakes Region | publisher = Minnesota Historical Society | year = 1997 | location = Saint Paul | pages = 30\u201332 | isbn = 0-87351-355-X }}</ref>  Some of the earliest evidence of a sustained presence in the area comes from a site known as [[Bradbury Brook]] near [[Mille Lacs Lake]] which was used around 7500 BC.<ref>{{cite web | title=TimePieces: Work Site| url=http://events.mnhs.org/TimePieces/EventDetail.cfm?EventID=577 | publisher=Minnesota Historical Society | accessdate=2007-02-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221115122/http://events.mnhs.org/Timepieces/EventDetail.cfm?EventID=577|archivedate=2007-02-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> Subsequently, extensive trading networks developed in the region.

When the Ojibwe signed a treaty ceding lands in 1837, Steele staked a claim to land on the east side of the Mississippi River adjacent to Saint Anthony Falls.  In 1848, he built a sawmill at the falls, and the community of Saint Anthony sprung up around the east side of the falls.  Steele told one of his employees, [[John H. Stevens]], that land on the west side of the falls would make a good site for future mills.  Since the land on the west side was still part of the military reservation, Stevens made a deal with Fort Snelling's commander.  Stevens would provide free ferry service across the river in exchange for a tract of {{convert|160|acre|km2}} at the head of the falls.  Stevens received the claim and built a house, the first house in Minneapolis, in 1850. In 1854, Stevens platted the city of Minneapolis on the west bank.<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 70\u20131</ref>  Later, in 1872, Minneapolis absorbed the city of Saint Anthony.<ref>Risjord 2005, p. 73</ref>\n\nThe city of [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] owes its existence to Fort Snelling.  A group of [[squatter]]s, mostly from the ill-fated [[Red River Colony]] in what is now the Canadian province of [[Manitoba]], established a camp near the fort.  The commandant of Fort Snelling, Major [[Joseph Plympton]], found their presence problematic because they were using timber and allowing their cattle and horses to graze around the fort.  Plympton banned lumbering and the construction of any new buildings on the military reservation land.  As a result, the squatters moved four miles downstream on the Mississippi River.<ref>Lass 1998, p. 99</ref> They settled at a site known as Fountain Cave.  This site was not quite far enough for the officers at the fort, so the squatters were forced out again. [[Pierre Parrant|Pierre \"Pig's Eye\" Parrant]], a popular [[moonshine]]r among the group, moved downriver and established a saloon, becoming the first European resident in the area that later became Saint Paul.  The squatters named their settlement \"Pig's Eye\" after Parrant.  The name was later changed to Lambert's Landing and then finally Saint Paul.  However, the earliest name for the area comes from a Native American colony ''Im-in-i-ja Ska'', meaning \"White Rock\" and referring to the limestone bluffs nearby.<ref name=\"pigseye\">{{cite web | last=Lareau | first = Paul J.| url=http://www.lareau.org/pep.html | title=Pig's Eye's Notepad | accessdate=2006-12-06|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006205241/http://www.lareau.org/pep.html |archivedate = October 6, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMinneapolis and Saint Paul are collectively known as the \"[[Minneapolis-St. Paul|Twin Cities]]\".  The cities enjoyed a rivalry during their early years, with Saint Paul being the capital city and Minneapolis becoming prominent through industry.  The term \"Twin Cities\" was coined around 1872, after a newspaper editorial suggested that Minneapolis could absorb Saint Paul.  Residents decided that the cities needed a separate identity, so people coined the phrase \"Dual Cities\", which later evolved into \"Twin Cities\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://wcco.com/goodquestion/local_story_034144252.html|last=Tracy|first=Ben|title=Good Question:Why Are We Twins?|publisher=[[WCCO-TV]]|date=2007-01-01|accessdate=2007-03-17|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004716/http://wcco.com/goodquestion/local_story_034144252.html |archivedate = September 27, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Today, Minneapolis is the largest city in Minnesota, with a population of 382,618 in the 2000 census.<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref>  Saint Paul is the second largest city, with a population of 287,151.

Loggers found the [[Eastern White Pine|white pine]] especially valuable, and it was plentiful in the northeastern section of the state and in the [[St. Croix River (Wisconsin-Minnesota)|St. Croix River]] valley.  Before railroads, lumbermen relied mostly on river transportation to bring logs to market, which made Minnesota's timber resources attractive.  Towns like [[Pine City, Minnesota|Pine City]], [[Marine on St. Croix, Minnesota|Marine on St. Croix]] and [[Stillwater, Minnesota|Stillwater]] became important lumber centers fed by the St. Croix River, while [[Winona, Minnesota|Winona]] was supplied lumber by areas in southern Minnesota and along the Minnesota River.

In 1847, he kept the organizers of [[Wisconsin]] from including Saint Paul and Saint Anthony Falls.<ref>Risjord 2005, p. 62</ref>  The [[Minnesota Territory]] was established from the lands remaining from [[Iowa Territory]] and [[Wisconsin Territory]] on March 3, 1849. The Minnesota Territory extended far into what is now North Dakota and South Dakota, to the [[Missouri River]]. There was a dispute over the shape of the state to be carved out of Minnesota Territory. An alternate proposal that was only narrowly defeated would have made the 46th parallel the state's northern border and the Missouri River its western border, thus giving up the whole northern half of the state in exchange for the eastern half of what later became South Dakota.<ref>{{cite book| last = Meinig| first = D.W.| title = The Shaping of America: A Geographical Perspective on 500 Years of History, Volume 2: Continental America, 1800-1867| publisher = Yale University Press| year = 1993| location = New Haven, CT| page = 439| isbn = 0-300-05658-3 }}</ref>\n\nWith [[Alexander Ramsey]] [[Whig Party (United States)|(W)]] as the first governor of Minnesota Territory and [[Henry Hastings Sibley]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|(D)]] as the territorial delegate to the United States Congress, the populations of Saint Paul and Saint Anthony swelled. [[Henry Mower Rice|Henry M. Rice]] (D), who replaced Sibley as the territorial delegate in 1853, worked in Congress to promote Minnesota interests.  He lobbied for the construction of a railroad connecting Saint Paul and Lake Superior, with a link from Saint Paul to the [[Illinois Central Railroad|Illinois Central]].<ref>Risjord 2005, p. 75</ref>\n\n===Statehood===\n{{main|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n\nIn December 1856, Henry M Rice brought forward two bills in Congress: an [[enabling act]] that would allow Minnesota to form a state constitution, and a railroad land grant bill. Rice's enabling act defined a state containing both prairie and forest lands. The state was bounded on the south by Iowa, on the east by Wisconsin, on the north by Canada, and on the west by the [[Red River of the North]] and the [[Bois de Sioux River]], [[Lake Traverse]], [[Big Stone Lake]], and then a line extending due south to the Iowa border. Rice made this motion based on Minnesota's population growth.<ref>Lass 1998, p. 124</ref>\n\nAt the time, tensions between the northern and the southern United States were growing, in [[Origins of the American Civil War|a series of conflicts]] that eventually resulted in the American Civil War. There was little debate in the [[United States House of Representatives]], but when [[Stephen A. Douglas]] introduced the bill in the [[United States Senate]], it caused a firestorm of debate. Northerners saw their chance to add two senators to the side of the [[free state (United States)|free states]], while Southerners were sure that they would lose power. Many senators offered polite arguments that the population was too sparse and that statehood was premature. Senator [[John Burton Thompson]] of Kentucky, in particular, argued that new states would cost the government too much for roads, canals, forts, and lighthouses. Although Thompson and 21 other senators voted against statehood, the enabling act was passed on February 26, 1857.<ref>Lass 1998, pp. 122\u20134</ref>\n\nAfter the enabling act was passed, territorial legislators had a difficult time writing a state constitution. A [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] was assembled in July 1857, but Republicans and Democrats were deeply divided. In fact, they formed two separate constitutional conventions and drafted two separate constitutions. Eventually, the two groups formed a conference committee and worked out a common constitution. The divisions continued, though, because Republicans refused to sign a document that had Democratic signatures on it, and vice versa. One copy of the constitution was written on white paper and signed only by Republicans, while the other copy was written on blue-tinged paper and signed by Democrats. These copies were signed on August 29, 1857. An election was called on October 13, 1857, where Minnesota residents would vote to approve or disapprove the constitution. The constitution was approved by 30,055 voters, while 571 rejected it.<ref name=\"sos\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.state.mn.us/student/mncnote.html|title=Minnesota Secretary of State \u2013 History/Old Stuff|publisher=Minnesota Secretary of State|accessdate=2008-04-17|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515034658/http://www.sos.state.mn.us/student/mncnote.html|archivedate=2008-05-15}}</ref>\n\nThe state constitution was sent to the [[United States Congress]] for ratification in December 1857. The approval process was drawn out for several months while Congress debated over issues that had stemmed from the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]. Southerners had been arguing that the next state should be pro-slavery, so when Kansas submitted the pro-slavery [[Lecompton Constitution]], the Minnesota statehood bill was delayed. After that, Northerners feared that Minnesota's Democratic delegation would support slavery in Kansas. Finally, after the Kansas question was settled and after Congress decided how many representatives Minnesota would get in the House of Representatives, the bill passed.<ref>Lass 1998, pp. 125\u20136</ref> The eastern half of the Minnesota Territory, under the boundaries defined by Henry Mower Rice, became the country's 32nd state on May 11, 1858.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj049101))|title=Journal of the Senate of the United States of America, 35th Congress, 1st Session, Tuesday, May 11, 1858, p. 436.}}</ref> The western part remained unorganized until its incorporation into the [[Dakota Territory]] on March 2, 1861.\n\n==Civil War era and Dakota War of 1862==\n{{Hatnote|\"Minnesota in the American Civil War\" redirects here.}}\nMinnesota strongly supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] war effort, with about 22,000 Minnesotans serving.

The Dakota had signed the [[Treaty of Traverse des Sioux]] and [[Treaty of Mendota]] in 1851 because they were concerned that without money from the United States government, they would starve, due to the loss of habitat of huntable game.  They were initially given a strip of land of ten miles (16&nbsp;km) north and south of the [[Minnesota River]], but they were later forced to sell the northern half of the land.  In 1862, crop failures left the Dakota with food shortages, and government money was delayed.  After four young Dakota men, searching for food, shot a family of white settlers near Acton, the Dakota leadership decided to continue the attacks in an effort to drive out the settlers.  Over a period of several days, Dakota attacks at the [[Lower Sioux Agency]], [[New Ulm, Minnesota|New Ulm]] and [[Hutchinson, Minnesota|Hutchinson]], as well as in the surrounding farmlands, resulted in the deaths of at least 300 to 400 white settlers and government employees, causing panic in the settlements and provoking counterattacks by state militia and federal forces which spread throughout the [[Minnesota River|Minnesota River Valley]] and as far away as the [[Red River Valley]].<ref>Carley, Kenneth.

The movement grew out of his interest in cooperative farm associations following the end of the Civil War, and he established local Grange chapters in [[Elk River, Minnesota|Elk River]] and Saint Paul.  The organization worked to provide education on new farming methods, as well as to influence government and public opinion on matters important to farmers.  One of these areas of concern was the freight rates charged by the railroads and by the [[grain elevator]]s.  Since there was little or no competition between railroads serving Minnesota farm communities, railroads could charge as much as the traffic would bear.  By 1871, the situation was so heated that both the Republican and Democratic candidates in state elections promised to regulate railroad rates.  The state established an office of railroad commissioner and imposed maximum charges for shipping. [[populism|Populist]] [[Ignatius L. Donnelly]] also served the Grange as an organizer.<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 145\u20138</ref>\n\n[[Saint Anthony Falls]], the only waterfall of its height on the Mississippi, played an important part in the development of Minneapolis.  The power of the waterfall first fueled sawmills, but later it was tapped to serve flour mills.  In 1870, only a small number of flour mills were in the Minneapolis area, but by 1900 Minnesota mills were grinding 14.1% of the nation's grain.  Advances in transportation, milling technology, and water power combined to give Minneapolis a dominance in the milling industry.  Spring wheat could be sown in the spring and harvested in late summer, but it posed special problems for milling.  To get around these problems, Minneapolis millers made use of new technology.  They invented the [[middlings purifier]], a device that used jets of air to remove the husks from the flour early in the milling process.  They also started using roller mills, as opposed to grindstones.  A series of rollers gradually broke down the kernels and integrated the [[gluten]] with the [[starch]].  These improvements led to the production of \"patent\" flour, which commanded almost double the price of \"bakers\" or \"clear\" flour, which it replaced.<ref>{{cite web| last =Hazen| first =Theodore R.| title =New Process Milling of 1850\u201370| publisher =Pond Lily Mill Restorations| url =http://www.angelfire.com/journal/millrestoration/newprocess.html| accessdate = 2007-05-11}}</ref> [[Pillsbury Company|Pillsbury]] and the Washburn-Crosby Company (a forerunner of [[General Mills]]) became the leaders in the Minneapolis milling industry.

The [[Vermilion Range (Minnesota)|Vermilion Range]] was surveyed and mapped by a party financed by [[Charlemagne Tower]].  Another mining town, [[Ely, Minnesota|Ely]] began with the foundation of the Chandler Mine in 1888.  Soon after, the [[Mesabi Range]] was established when ore was found just under the surface of the ground in [[Mountain Iron, Minnesota|Mountain Iron]].  The Mesabi Range ultimately had much more ore than the Vermilion Range, and it was easy to extract because the ore was closer to the surface.  As a result, [[open-pit mining|open-pit mines]] became well-established on the Mesabi Range, with 111 mines operating by 1904.  To ship the iron ore to refineries, railroads such as the [[Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway]] were built from the iron ranges to [[Two Harbors, Minnesota|Two Harbors]] and Duluth on Lake Superior.  Large ore docks were used at these cities to load the iron ore onto ships for transport east on the [[Great Lakes]].  The mining industry helped to propel Duluth from a small town to a large, thriving city.<ref>Lass 1998, pp. 184\u201395</ref>  In 1904, iron was discovered in the [[Cuyuna Range]] in [[Crow Wing County, Minnesota|Crow Wing County]].

By 1900, the Twin Cities were becoming a center of commerce, led by the [[Minneapolis Grain Exchange]] and the foundation of the [[Federal Reserve Bank]] with its ninth district in Minneapolis.  Many of the businessmen who had made money in the railroad, flour milling, and logging industries lived in the Twin Cities and personified the [[gilded age]]. They started to donate money for cultural institutions such as the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra (now the [[Minnesota Orchestra]]).  The parks of Minneapolis, under the direction of [[Theodore Wirth]] became famous, and the new [[Minnesota State Capitol]] building and the [[Cathedral of Saint Paul (Minnesota)|Cathedral of Saint Paul]] attracted attention to Saint Paul.<ref>Gilman 1991, p. 167</ref>\n\nThe role of government also grew during the early 20th century.  In the rural areas, most people obtained food and manufactured goods from neighbors and other people they knew personally.  As industry and commerce grew, goods such as food, materials, and medicines were no longer made by neighbors, but by large companies.  In response, citizens called on their government for consumer protection, inspection of goods, and regulation of public utilities.<ref>Gilman 1991, pp. 173\u20134</ref>  The growth of the automobile spurred calls to develop roads and to enforce traffic laws.  The state officially started its trunk highway system in 1920, with the passage of the [[Babcock Amendment]] that established 70 [[Constitutional Route]]s around the state.<ref>{{cite web|title=Minnesota's Constitutional Routes|url=http://www.steve-riner.com/mnhighways/conrtes.htm|last=Riner|first=Steve|year=2003|accessdate=2006-07-21}}</ref> New regulation was necessary for banking and insurance. The safety of industrial workers and miners became an increasing concern, and brought about the [[workers' compensation]] system.  Since government was getting more complex, citizens demanded more of a role in their government, and became more politically active.<ref>Gilman 1991, p. 174</ref>\n\n===Great Depression===\n[[Wilbur Foshay]], an owner of several utility companies, built the [[Foshay Tower]] in 1929, just before the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].  The building was the tallest building in Minnesota at the time.  It remained [[List of tallest buildings in Minneapolis|the tallest building in Minneapolis]] until 1973, when the [[IDS Tower]] surpassed it.  The tower was a symbol of the wealth of the times, but when the stock market crashed, Foshay lost his fortune in the crash.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrhp.mnhs.org/property_overview.cfm?propertyID=27|title=National Register of Historic Places \u2013 Foshay Tower|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society|accessdate=2007-01-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827164324/http://nrhp.mnhs.org/property_overview.cfm?PropertyID=27|archive-date=August 27, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] had several effects on Minnesota, with layoffs on the [[Iron Range]] and a drought in the [[Great Plains]] from 1931 through 1936.<ref>Gilman 1991, p. 187</ref>  While the Depression had several causes, one most relevant to Minnesota was that United States businesses in the 1920s had improved their efficiency through standardizing production methods and eliminating waste.  Business owners were reaping the benefits of this increase in productivity, but they were not sharing it with their employees because of the weakness of [[organized labor]], nor were they sharing it with the public in the form of lowered prices.  Instead, the windfall went to stockholders.  The eventual result was that consumers could no longer afford the goods that factories were producing.<ref>Risjord 2005, p. 190</ref>\n\n[[Floyd B. Olson]] of the [[Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party]] was elected as the governor in the 1930 election.  In his first term, he signed a bonding bill that authorized $15 million (${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|15000000|1930|r=-7}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) for highway construction, in an effort to provide work for the unemployed.  He also signed an executive order that provided for a minimum wage of 45 cents per hour for up to 48 hours weekly.  This effort predated the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938 that established a nationwide minimum wage.  By 1932, with the Depression worsening, the Farmer-Labor Party platform was proposing a state income tax, a graduated tax on nationwide chain stores (such as [[J.C. Penney]] and [[Sears, Roebuck and Company]]), low-interest farm loans, and a state unemployment insurance program.  The [[progressivism|progressive]] 1933 legislative session saw a comprehensive response to the depression including a moratorium on mortgage [[foreclosure]]s, a reduction in property taxes for farmers and homeowners, the state income tax, and chain store taxes, tavern reform, ratification of a [[child labor]] amendment, a state old-age pension system, and steps toward preserving the area that later became the [[Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness]].<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 190\u20134</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, formerly quiet labor unions began asserting themselves rather forcefully.  The [[Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934]] turned ugly, with the union demanding the right to speak for all trucking employees.  As a result of this strike and many others across the nation, [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] passed the [[National Labor Relations Act]] in 1935.  Government programs such as the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] and [[Works Progress Administration]] brought much-needed work projects to the state.  Congress passed the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] in 1934, giving Minnesota's Ojibwa and Dakota tribes more autonomy over their own affairs.<ref>Gilman 1991, pp. 192\u20133</ref>\n\n==Modern Minnesota==\n\n===Arts and culture===\nThe [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]] was established in 1883.

In the 1940s, the museum shifted its focus toward modern art, after a gift from Mrs. Gilbert Walker made it possible to acquire works by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], and others.

The high cost of staging Broadway productions meant that shows had to be immediately successful and return a high amount of revenue. This discouraged innovation and experimentation, and made it difficult to stage important works of literature. These ideas were first disseminated in a 1959 article in the drama section of the ''New York Times'', and citizens in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area were eager to support the idea. The theater served as a prototype for other resident non-profit theaters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guthrietheater.org/INSIDETHEGUTHRIE/TheaterHistory/tabid/83/Default.aspx|title=Theater History|publisher=Guthrie Theater|accessdate=2006-09-24|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070106133409/http://www.guthrietheater.org/INSIDETHEGUTHRIE/TheaterHistory/tabid/83/Default.aspx |archivedate = January 6, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Minnesota in World War II===\n[[File:snellingbldgs.jpg|thumb|right|Most of the 400 structures at Fort Snelling began falling into disrepair after the fort closed in 1946.]]\nLike other U.S. States, Minnesota made its contributions to the effort of World War II in wartime manufacturing and other areas. The [[United States Navy]] contracted with [[Cargill]] to build ships after seeing their success in building ships and barges used to haul grain. Cargill built facilities in [[Savage, Minnesota]] on the south bank of the Minnesota River and turned out 18 refueling ships and four towboats in four years.

The United States government built the Twin Cities Ordnance Plant to produce munitions.  The plant employed 8,500 workers in 1941, and since there was a shortage of male workers during the war, more than half of the workers at the munitions plant were women.  The plant also employed nearly 1000 African American workers, as President Roosevelt had issued an executive order forbidding racial discrimination in defense industries.  Native American workers also found opportunities due to workforce shortages in wartime.\n\n<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 209\u201310</ref>\n\nSavage was also the home of [[Camp Savage]], a school designed to improve the foreign language skills of Japanese-American soldiers and to train them in military intelligence gathering.  The school was originally established in San Francisco, but moved to Minnesota after the bombing of [[Pearl Harbor]].  Eventually, the school outgrew its facilities in Savage and was moved to [[Fort Snelling]].<ref name=\"savage\"/>  Fort Snelling itself served a major role as a reception center for newly drafted recruits after the [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940|Selective Service Act]] was passed in 1940.  New recruits were given a physical exam and the Army General Qualification Test to determine their fitness for service in a particular branch.  The most intelligent recruits, about 37% of Minnesotans going through Fort Snelling, were assigned to the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]].  Recruits were also issued uniforms and sent from the fort to other training centers.  Over 300,000 recruits were processed through Fort Snelling during the World War II years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/people/mngg/investigate/fswwii.htm|title=Minnesota's Greatest Generation \u2013 Investigate Further \u2013 Fort Snelling's Last War|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society|accessdate=2006-12-30}}</ref>\n\n===Modern economy===\n{{Main|Economy of Minnesota}}\nAgriculture evolved from an individual occupation into a major industry after World War II.  Technological developments increased productivity on farms, such as automation of [[feedlot]]s for hogs and cattle, machine milking at dairy farms, and raising chickens in large buildings.  Planting also became more specialized with [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] of corn and wheat, fertilization, and mechanical equipment such as tractors and [[combine harvester|combines]] became the norm.  University of Minnesota professor [[Norman Borlaug]] contributed to this knowledge as part of the [[Green Revolution]].<ref>Gilman 1991, pp. 196-8</ref> Large canneries such as the [[Green Giant|Minnesota Valley Canning Company]] fed the country from Minnesota's productive farmland.\n\nThe [[3M|Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company]] (3M) was founded in 1902 in [[Two Harbors, Minnesota]], and was later moved to Duluth, Saint Paul, and then [[Maplewood, Minnesota|Maplewood]].  The founders of 3M got their start by manufacturing sandpaper.  Under the leadership of [[William L.

Misa, ''Digital State: The Story of Minnesota's Computing Industry'' (2013)</ref>\n\n===Postwar politics===\n{{See also|Politics of Minnesota}}\n\nHistorian Annette Atkins has explored the changing long-term pattern of Minnesota politics.  In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the heavily rural state was hostile to business and railroads, with the Republicans dominant in the small towns, and the Democrats on the farms.  Numerous left-wing groups and third-parties emerged, such as the Anti-Monopolist party in the 1870s, the Populists in the 1890s, the Non-Partisan League in the 1910s, and the Farmer-Labor party in the 1930s.  Isolationism was strong, Atkins argues, because of the fear that Eastern bankers and industrialists forced the United States into World War I to enlarge their profits. Business fought unions, and the unions fought back, and with the governor on their side unions won some violent battles in the 1930s. In recent decades, however, the liberal coalition has weakened.  Labor unions are a shadow of their old strength.  Most farmers have left for the towns and especially the Twin Cities, where more than half of the people live. The New Right has mobilized social conservatives, especially those from traditional religious backgrounds, with abortion a furiously contested issue.  State government has become much more friendly toward growth and the needs of business entrepreneurship.  Environmentalism has split left and right, with the industrial workers in the Up North and Iron Range districts demanding that their jobs be protected from environmentalists. Atkins finds that:\n: What makes the North country valuable to conservationists is the seclusion, beauty, isolation, quiet, clear water, and absence of development.  The preservationists have tried to limit or prohibit roads, hydroelectric generators, sawmills and lumbering, resorts, power boats, airplanes, and snowmobiles\u2026.  The tensions between development and preservation, restraint and grows, beauty and jobs runs deep and strong.<ref>Annette Atkins, \"Minnesota\", in James H. Madison, ed., ''Heartland: Comparative Histories of the Midwestern States'' (1988) pp 12-24, quote on 24</ref>\n\n[[File:Hubert Humphrey crop.jpg|thumb|right|Hubert Humphrey]]\n[[Hubert Humphrey]] was a Minnesotan who became a nationally prominent politician. He first ran for mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, but lost the election to the Republican candidate by just a few thousand votes.  As a Democrat, Humphrey recognized that his best chance for political success was to obtain the support of the [[Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party]].  Other members of the Farmer-Labor Party had been considering the idea, as encouraged by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], but the merger only became reality after Humphrey traveled to Washington, D.C. to discuss the issue.  Rather than simply absorbing the Farmer-Labor party, with its constituency of 200,000 voters, Humphrey suggested calling the party the [[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party]].  He was elected mayor of Minneapolis in 1945, and one of his first actions was to propose an ordinance making racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine.  This ordinance was adopted in 1947, and although few fines were issued, the city's banks and department stores realized that public relations would improve by hiring blacks in increasing numbers.<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 211\u20134</ref> Humphrey delivered an impassioned speech at the [[1948 Democratic National Convention]] encouraging the party to adopt a civil rights plank in their platform.  He was elected to the [[United States Senate]] in 1948 and was re-elected in 1954 and 1960.<ref name=\"timepieces42\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/library/tips/history_topics/42humphrey.html|title=History Topics: Hubert H.

In 1963, President [[John F. Kennedy]] sent a comprehensive civil rights bill to Congress, based largely on the ideas that Humphrey had been placing before the Senate for the previous fifteen years.  The bill passed the House in early 1964, but passage through the Senate was more difficult, due to [[Southern United States|southern]] segregationists who [[filibuster]]ed for 75 days.  Finally, in June 1964, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] became law.  Humphrey called this his greatest achievement.<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 219\u201321</ref> [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] recruited Humphrey for his running mate in the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 presidential election]], and Humphrey became [[Vice President of the United States]].  Governor [[Karl Rolvaag]] [[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party|(DFL)]] appointed [[Walter Mondale]] to fill Humphrey's Senate seat.  Humphrey voiced doubts about the 1965 bombings of [[North Vietnam]], which alienated him from Johnson.  He later defended Johnson's conduct of the [[Vietnam War]], alienating himself from [[Liberalism in the United States|liberals]], who were beginning to oppose the war around 1967.  In the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 presidential election]], Humphrey ran against [[Richard Nixon]] and [[American Independent Party|Independent]] candidate [[George Wallace]] and lost the popular vote by only 0.7%.  Humphrey later returned to the Senate in 1971 after Eugene McCarthy left office.<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 221\u20132</ref>\n\n[[Eugene McCarthy]] [[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party|(DFL)]] served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1949 through 1959 and in the United States Senate from 1959 through 1971.  He gained a reputation as an intellectual with strong convictions and integrity.  In 1967, he challenged Lyndon B. Johnson for the presidential nomination, running on an anti-war platform in contrast to Johnson's policies.  His strong support in the New Hampshire primary convinced Johnson to leave the race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/library/tips/history_topics/49mccarthy.html|title=History Topics: Eugene McCarthy|accessdate=2006-09-24|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society}}</ref>\n\nDemocrat [[Walter Mondale]] also achieved national prominence as Vice President under [[Jimmy Carter]].  He served in the Senate from his appointment in 1964 until becoming Vice President in 1977.  In 1984, he ran for President of the United States, choosing [[Geraldine Ferraro]] as his running mate. [[1984 United States presidential election|The election]] proved to be a landslide victory for popular incumbent [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/library/tips/history_topics/50mondale.html|title=History Topics: Walter Mondale|accessdate=2006-09-24|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society}}</ref>  In 2002, just 11 days before election day, when incumbent Senator [[Paul Wellstone]] was killed in a plane crash, Mondale stepped into the race as the Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate.

He spent two years working with a split [[Minnesota Legislature]] to enact a tax and school finance reform package that shifted the source of public education funding from local property taxes to state sales taxes, as well as adding [[excise]] taxes to liquor and cigarettes.  This achievement, dubbed the \"Minnesota Miracle\", was immensely popular.  In the next few years, the Legislature enacted other facets of their \"new liberalism\", including ratification of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], strong environmental laws, increases in workers' compensation and unemployment benefits, and elimination of income taxes for the working poor.<ref>Risjord 2005, pp. 222\u20133</ref>  ''Time'' Magazine featured Wendell Anderson and the state in an article entitled, \"Minnesota: A State That Works\".<ref>{{cite news| title = Minnesota: A State That Works| url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,907665,00.html| work = Time Magazine| date = August 13, 1973| accessdate = 2007-01-31\n}} ([http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19730813,00.html see cover])</ref>  In 1976 when Mondale resigned his Senate seat to become Jimmy Carter's running mate, Anderson resigned the governor's seat and turned it over to Lieutenant Governor [[Rudy Perpich]] (DFL), who promptly appointed Anderson to fill Mondale's vacant Senate seat.

The [[tram]] network serves most city neighbourhoods, and is the backbone of public transport within the city, albeit supplemented by the inner sections of the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]], along with urban [[trolleybus]] and [[bus]] routes as well as two [[funicular]] railways and one [[rack railway]]. The trams and other city transport modes operate within a fare regime provided by the cantonal public transport authority [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund]] (ZVV), which also covers regional rail and bus services.<ref name=tutttctlr>{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | title = Z\u00fcrich: Top city \u2014 thanks to light rail | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 130\u2013134 | date = April 2005}}</ref><ref name=tuttcraag>{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | title =  Z\u00fcrich: The Cobra rules, all above ground | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 180\u2013184 | date = May 2005}}</ref><ref name=zacait>{{cite web |  first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/zurich05_0.html | title = Z\u00fcrich: A city and its trams | date = December 2005 | accessdate = 2011-08-10}}</ref>\n\nThe city's trams are operated by the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Z\u00fcrich]] (VBZ), which also manages the tramway infrastructure within the city, but the city's tram tracks are also used by two other operations.

Electrified from the 1890s, they have seen off challenges including proposals to replace them by [[trolleybuses]] and by a [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]] or [[U-Bahn]]. With a relatively static city network from the 1930s to the late 1970s, the city's trams have been expanding again since then. Recent expansions have taken the network into the suburbs beyond the city boundary, covering areas it retreated from in the first part of the 20th century. Further extensions have been approved, both to the city tram network itself, and by the introduction of a [[Limmattal light rail line|new light rail system]] in the [[Limmat Valley]] that will interwork with the city trams.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\n[[File:R\u00f6sslitram.jpg|thumb|left|One of Z\u00fcrich's horse trams  in 1900]]\nVarious projects to introduce trams to Z\u00fcrich were proposed from the 1860s onwards. It was not until 1882, however, that the first tram operated in the city. These initial trams were operated by the {{ill|Z\u00fcrcher Strassenbahn Gesellschaft|de}} (ZStG), a private company, and were of [[standard gauge]] ({{RailGauge|sg|disp=or}} gauge) and horse-drawn.<ref name=vbzfafch>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | title = Facts & figures - Corporate history | publisher = VBZ | accessdate = 2012-05-26 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121007013822/http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | archivedate = 2012-10-07 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1888 the first electric tramway in Switzerland (the [[Vevey\u2013Montreux\u2013Chillon tramway]]) had opened, and, in 1894, another private company, the {{ill|Elektrische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich|de}} (EStZ), started operating [[metre gauge]] ({{RailGauge|1000mm|first=imp|disp=1}} gauge) electric trams in Z\u00fcrich. The EStZ only survived for two years before it was taken over by the City of Z\u00fcrich, who renamed it the [[St\u00e4dtische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich]] (StStZ). The following year, the horse trams of the ZStG were acquired.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFurther tramway companies were founded, some operating entirely within the city, some connecting the city with its nearer suburbs, and some running in rural areas entirely beyond the city, but still linked by connections with other lines to the city. Like the EStZ, all these lines were electrified and were built to the metre gauge. The StStZ gradually took over those companies that had significant city operations, usually closing any cross-boundary lines, whilst leaving those lines entirely beyond the city to their own devices.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Many companies===\n[[File:Zuercher Strassenbahnlinien um 1899.jpg|thumb|The mix of routes in 1899, distinguishing city owned (''Stadt'') and private (''Privat''), and horse (''Pferdebahn'') and electric (''elektrisch'')]]\nThe many companies that operated trams in and around Z\u00fcrich are summarised in the table below.

The standard gauge horse tram lines had all been converted to metre gauge and electrified. The StStZ had also built many tram extensions, resulting in a dense network of tramlines serving most city neighbourhoods.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nHowever, in 1927, the StStZ had introduced its first [[motor bus]] route, and this was to be followed in 1939 by the first of the [[Trolleybuses in Z\u00fcrich|city's trolleybus routes]]. Initially these modes complemented the trams, but at various times they have threatened to replace parts of the tram system, and sometimes succeeded in doing so.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1940, the StStZ started a modernisation of its trams, introducing the first prototypes of the {{ill|Swiss Standard Tram|de|Schweizer Standardwagen|fr|Tramway standard suisse}}. Despite Switzerland's neutrality, the economic effects of the [[second world war]] slowed down the program, but by 1953 the VBZ, as the StStZ had become in 1950, had taken delivery of 177 such trams.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Lines closed===\n[[File:Wetzikon Meilen Bahn Gr\u00fcningen.JPG|thumb|left|The WMB in Gr\u00fcningen, prior to 1950]]\nWhile the tram network within the city of Z\u00fcrich has seen relatively few line closures, the same cannot be said for the lines beyond the city. The StStZ routinely closed any out-of-city lines belonging to the companies it took over.<ref name=zacait/> In other cases, private sector operated lines succumbed without StStZ involvement. Out of town closures included:\n\n* The Schlieren to Dietikon and Schlieren to Weinigen lines of the LSB company, closed in 1928 and 1931 respectively.<ref name=tmblsb/> \n* The Oerlikon to Schwamendingen and Seebach to Glattbrugg lines of the ZOS company, closed in 1931.<ref name=tmbzos/> \n* The Uster to Langholz line of the UOeB company, closed in 1949.<ref name=ebuoeb/>\n* The Wetzikon to Meilen line of the WMB company, closed in 1950.<ref name=ebwmb/>\n\nIn the city, the initial threat to the tram came from its perceived inflexibility and susceptibility to the growing traffic congestion in the city streets. One proposed solution was the conversion of the less busy lines to trolleybus routes, and the first step in this direction was the conversion of tram route 1, from Burgwies to Hardplatz (1954-1956). This was followed by the Farbhof to Schlieren section of route 2 (1956-8) which became a westward extension of the same trolleybus route. In practice, the trolleybus service struggled to cope with peak loadings and punctuality did not improve. No further conversions of tram routes to trollrybuses have taken place.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Underground proposals===\n[[File:No. 7 Tram, Parade Platz.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of ''Mirage'' trams at Paradeplatz, operating on the surface where they were originally intended to be underground]]\nIn the 1950s, as well as proposing the conversion of less busy lines to trolleybus, plans were also made to place the busier lines in tunnel, in a form called the ''Tiefbahn''. The recently delivered Swiss Standard trams were not seen as suitable for this, because they had doors on their tapered car ends that would not have aligned with the proposed underground station platforms. In order to overcome this limitation, several new designs of tram were introduced. The first design, known as the P16 or ''Karpfen'', could not run on some existing routes, and only one batch of 15 motor tram and trailer pairs was built. A later design, which used articulation to avoid the problems of the P16, was eventually more successful and 126 vehicles were delivered by 1969. This car became popularly known as the ''Mirage''.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nDespite the planning and new rolling stock, a [[referendum]] in 1962 rejected the ''Tiefbahn''. However the proponents of going underground instead proposed a full scale [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]], the [[Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn]] system. This would have been standard gauge and electrified using a third rail, and hence incompatible with the tram system. The lines would have extended further into the suburbs and provided faster transit times than the tramways, which would have been curtailed so as not to compete with the U-Bahn. However this would have been at the expense of a coarser grained network, with much longer distances between U-Bahn stations than between the tram stops they replaced.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1973, the U-Bahn proposal too was rejected in a referendum, but not before several stretches of U-Bahn tunnel had been built. One section of the putative U-Bahn has since been adapted, as described below, for use by trams, whilst another now forms the terminus of the [[Uetliberg railway line|Uetliberg]] and [[Sihltal railway line|Sihltal]] railway lines under the [[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]].<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Extensions and a new model===\n[[File:Zurich Be 4-6 Tram 2000 2075 Waldgarten.jpg|thumb|left|Tram 2000 tram at Waldgarten stop in the tunnel section built for the U-Bahn]]\nIn 1976, the first tram extension since 1954 took place, with the extension of route 4 from Hardturm to [[Werdh\u00f6lzli]]. Unlike the older lines, this extension was built mostly on reserved track, a precedent to be followed by most subsequent extensions.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nThe Werdh\u00f6lzli extension was followed in 1986 by the extension of routes 7 and 9 into new residential areas to the north-east of Z\u00fcrich. This used one of the stretches of tunnel that had been built for the rejected U-Bahn, between Milchbuck and Schwamendingen. The tram route was extended through the tunnel before splitting at Schwamendingen to serve the area beyond, using new surface track. Because the tunnels and stations had been built with [[island platform]]s, whilst Z\u00fcrich trams only have doors on their [[Right- and left-hand traffic#Terminology|nearside]], the section through the tunnel uses left-hand running.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nFrom 1976 onwards, the VBZ tram fleet was further updated, with the introduction of Z\u00fcrich's variant of the [[Tram 2000|Tram 2000 design]] used by several Swiss tram systems. Several sub-classes of the Tram 2000 were purchased, including articulated and non-articulated variants, and some without drivers cabs that could only operate in multiple with other cars. Eventually 171 of these vehicles were delivered, with the last of the class delivered in 1992.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFrom the 1980s onwards, the system was increasingly acclaimed for its success in maintaining a high share of the [[modal split]], and the [[Z\u00fcrich model]] of transport provision was named after it. Beyond the tramway, the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn rail network]] was introduced to serve the region beyond the city boundaries, taking on some of the role that was originally planned for the U-Bahn. In 1990, the city's urban and regional transport were integrated by the introduction of the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund|ZVV]] and its zone-based common fare structure.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n=== Low floors and the Glattalbahn ===\n[[File:Zurich Be 5-6 Cobra 3002 Letzistrasse.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Cobra (tram)|Bombardier Cobra]] low-floor tram on typical VBZ street track]]\nIn 2001, the VBZ took delivery of the first prototypes of a brand-new low-floor design of tram, known as the [[Cobra (tram)|Cobra]].<ref name=vbzfafch/> Despite many teething problems with the prototypes, which were eventually extensively rebuilt, there are now 88 of these trams in service, with the last delivered in 2010. In order to increase the number of low-floor trams in service, 23 trams from the otherwise high-floor Tram 2000 fleet were rebuilt between 2001 and 2005 with the addition of a low-floor centre section.\n\n[[File:Glatttalbahn - \u00d6rlikerhaus 2011-08-22 19-33-44.JPG|thumb|left|The Glattalbahn]]\nFrom the 1950s onwards, the [[Glattal]] region to the north of Z\u00fcrich experienced a rapid boom as population and industry spilled over from nearby Z\u00fcrich, partly driven by the presence of [[Z\u00fcrich Airport]]. Whilst the airport is served by the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|city's S-Bahn rail network]], the economic growth and resulting congestion led to a need for a finer-grained form of public transport. The responsible transport authority (the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Glattal]] or VBG) responded by constructing a new light rail system, the [[Stadtbahn Glattal|Glattalbahn]]. This was built to be compatible with Z\u00fcrich's tram network, with which it connects at several points on the city boundary. The system opened in stages between 2006 and 2010. The VBG contracted the VBZ to operate the network, and several tram routes now operate across both networks.<ref name=gpw/><ref name=saw/><ref name=tuthhqlr>{{cite news | first = C.J. | last = Wansbeek | title = Glattal: High quality light rail to Z\u00fcrich airport | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 374\u2013376 | date = October 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of new trams between 2001 and 2010 led to the departure of older vehicles.

All tram stops are equipped with ticket machines, and passengers are required to purchase a ticket before boarding the vehicle. Passengers may board through any door and are not required to show tickets on boarding. Instead, tickets are randomly checked by roving teams of fare inspectors, and fines are imposed on passengers found without one.<ref name=vbzatm>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/tickets/fare_zone_system.html | title = VBZ - Automatic ticket machine | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-21}}</ref>\n\nTram services are operated within the fare and ticketing system provided by the cantonal public transport authority, the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund]] (ZVV). This system covers the whole of the [[canton of Z\u00fcrich]] and thus covers travel on other modes and services, provided by many other operators, and includes the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]] suburban rail network. Free transfer is permitted between different vehicles, routes, modes and operators, provided a ticket valid for the whole journey is held.<ref name=vbzfzs>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/tickets/fare_zone_system.html | title = VBZ - Fare zone system | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-21}}</ref>\n\nThe ZVV system is zone-based, with fares for individual journeys set by the zones the journey passes through. The Z\u00fcrich tram network extends over just two of these zones, with zone 110 covering the city routes, and zone 121 covering the Stadtbahn Glattal routes. Both single journey and day tickets are available, as are a number of passes with longer validities.<ref name=vbzfzs/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.zvv.ch/export/sites/default/common-images/content-image-gallery/linien-zonen-pdfs/Tarifzonen_Kanton_Zuerich_2011.pdf | title = Tarifzonen - Fare zones | publisher = ZVV | accessdate = 2012-06-18}}</ref>\n\n===Cargo tram===\n[[File:Cargo Tram outside Zurich Hauptbahnhof.JPG|thumb|left|The cargo tram]]\nBesides its passenger transport activities, VBZ, jointly with the city refuse and recycling department ERZ, operates the cargo tram to collect bulky waste. The cargo tram serves 10 different collection points around Z\u00fcrich, calling at each on different days of the month. The collected refuse is taken to a specially constructed siding at the ERZ yard adjacent to the Werdh\u00f6lzli tram terminus.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/de/index/produkte_dienstleistungen/cargo_tram_und_etram.html | title = Cargo- und E-Tram | language = German | trans-title = Cargo- and E-Tram | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-09 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120829085657/http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/de/index/produkte_dienstleistungen/cargo_tram_und_etram.html | archivedate = 2012-08-29 }}</ref><ref name=amcargo>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/cargotram.html | title = Cargotram -  Z\u00fcrich's domestic refuse takes to the rails | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | date = August 2003 | accessdate = 2013-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2014&item=140114 | title = Cargotram serves additional destination | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | date = 2014-01-14 | accessdate = 2014-02-06}}</ref>\n\nThe service was introduced in 2003, as an attempt to reduce the amount of bulky waste items dumped illegally every year.

By 2010, it had conducted trials of three existing tram types on its network. These were the [[Stadler Tango]], the [[Siemens Combino]] and the [[Bombardier Flexity]]. It then requested tenders for the supply of 30 new trams, together with an option for the supply of a further 70 vehicles. The first trams were to be delivered in December 2016, and were to be 100% low floor with capacity for at least 225 passengers. In response, by April 2013 five suppliers had submitted bids. As of February 2015, no decision had been made as to which supplier to select, with reports of conflict between city and canton authorities.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?item=210610a | title = Tango, Combino or Flexity? | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = June 2010 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?item=201112 | title = New tram order: The ball is rolling | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = November 2012 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2013&item=080413 | title = Five suppliers vie for tram contract | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = April 2013 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2015&item=260215 | title = More gloom over tram order | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = February 2015 | accessdate = 2015-03-02}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2016, it was announced that VBZ had awarded a contract worth 358 million [[Swiss Franc]]s to [[Bombardier Transportation]] for the supply of 70<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/tram-zuerich-flexity-kommt-erst-im-sommer-2020-zum-einsatz-ld.1524125 | title = Das erste Flexity-Tram kurvt durch Z\u00fcrich \u2013 aber Passagiere d\u00fcrfen noch lange nicht mitfahren | language = German |  work =  Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung | date = 25 November 2019 | accessdate = 25 November 2019}}</ref> 7-section [[Flexity 2]] trams, with an option for a further 70, to be delivered between 2018 and 2023.

Both [[Stadler Rail]] and [[Siemens]] filed complaints with the [[Administrative Court of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich]], causing the finalisation of the contract to be suspended, but the court ruled in February 2017 that VBZ could conclude the contract with Bombardier. After both Stadler and Siemens decided not to appeal this decision to the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]], the contract was finally signed on 2 March 2017.

Electrified from the 1890s, they have seen off challenges including proposals to replace them by [[trolleybuses]] and by a [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]] or [[U-Bahn]]. With a relatively static city network from the 1930s to the late 1970s, the city's trams have been expanding again since then. Recent expansions have taken the network into the suburbs beyond the city boundary, covering areas it retreated from in the first part of the 20th century. Further extensions have been approved, both to the city tram network itself, and by the introduction of a [[Limmattal light rail line|new light rail system]] in the [[Limmat Valley]] that will interwork with the city trams.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\n[[File:R\u00f6sslitram.jpg|thumb|left|One of Z\u00fcrich's horse trams  in 1900]]\nVarious projects to introduce trams to Z\u00fcrich were proposed from the 1860s onwards. It was not until 1882, however, that the first tram operated in the city. These initial trams were operated by the {{ill|Z\u00fcrcher Strassenbahn Gesellschaft|de}} (ZStG), a private company, and were of [[standard gauge]] ({{RailGauge|sg|disp=or}} gauge) and horse-drawn.<ref name=vbzfafch>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | title = Facts & figures - Corporate history | publisher = VBZ | accessdate = 2012-05-26 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121007013822/http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | archivedate = 2012-10-07 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1888 the first electric tramway in Switzerland (the [[Vevey\u2013Montreux\u2013Chillon tramway]]) had opened, and, in 1894, another private company, the {{ill|Elektrische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich|de}} (EStZ), started operating [[metre gauge]] ({{RailGauge|1000mm|first=imp|disp=1}} gauge) electric trams in Z\u00fcrich. The EStZ only survived for two years before it was taken over by the City of Z\u00fcrich, who renamed it the [[St\u00e4dtische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich]] (StStZ). The following year, the horse trams of the ZStG were acquired.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFurther tramway companies were founded, some operating entirely within the city, some connecting the city with its nearer suburbs, and some running in rural areas entirely beyond the city, but still linked by connections with other lines to the city. Like the EStZ, all these lines were electrified and were built to the metre gauge.

The standard gauge horse tram lines had all been converted to metre gauge and electrified. The StStZ had also built many tram extensions, resulting in a dense network of tramlines serving most city neighbourhoods.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nHowever, in 1927, the StStZ had introduced its first [[motor bus]] route, and this was to be followed in 1939 by the first of the [[Trolleybuses in Z\u00fcrich|city's trolleybus routes]]. Initially these modes complemented the trams, but at various times they have threatened to replace parts of the tram system, and sometimes succeeded in doing so.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1940, the StStZ started a modernisation of its trams, introducing the first prototypes of the {{ill|Swiss Standard Tram|de|Schweizer Standardwagen|fr|Tramway standard suisse}}. Despite Switzerland's neutrality, the economic effects of the [[second world war]] slowed down the program, but by 1953 the VBZ, as the StStZ had become in 1950, had taken delivery of 177 such trams.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Lines closed===\n[[File:Wetzikon Meilen Bahn Gr\u00fcningen.JPG|thumb|left|The WMB in Gr\u00fcningen, prior to 1950]]\nWhile the tram network within the city of Z\u00fcrich has seen relatively few line closures, the same cannot be said for the lines beyond the city. The StStZ routinely closed any out-of-city lines belonging to the companies it took over.<ref name=zacait/> In other cases, private sector operated lines succumbed without StStZ involvement. Out of town closures included:\n\n* The Schlieren to Dietikon and Schlieren to Weinigen lines of the LSB company, closed in 1928 and 1931 respectively.<ref name=tmblsb/> \n* The Oerlikon to Schwamendingen and Seebach to Glattbrugg lines of the ZOS company, closed in 1931.<ref name=tmbzos/> \n* The Uster to Langholz line of the UOeB company, closed in 1949.<ref name=ebuoeb/>\n* The Wetzikon to Meilen line of the WMB company, closed in 1950.<ref name=ebwmb/>\n\nIn the city, the initial threat to the tram came from its perceived inflexibility and susceptibility to the growing traffic congestion in the city streets. One proposed solution was the conversion of the less busy lines to trolleybus routes, and the first step in this direction was the conversion of tram route 1, from Burgwies to Hardplatz (1954-1956). This was followed by the Farbhof to Schlieren section of route 2 (1956-8) which became a westward extension of the same trolleybus route. In practice, the trolleybus service struggled to cope with peak loadings and punctuality did not improve. No further conversions of tram routes to trollrybuses have taken place.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Underground proposals===\n[[File:No. 7 Tram, Parade Platz.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of ''Mirage'' trams at Paradeplatz, operating on the surface where they were originally intended to be underground]]\nIn the 1950s, as well as proposing the conversion of less busy lines to trolleybus, plans were also made to place the busier lines in tunnel, in a form called the ''Tiefbahn''. The recently delivered Swiss Standard trams were not seen as suitable for this, because they had doors on their tapered car ends that would not have aligned with the proposed underground station platforms. In order to overcome this limitation, several new designs of tram were introduced. The first design, known as the P16 or ''Karpfen'', could not run on some existing routes, and only one batch of 15 motor tram and trailer pairs was built. A later design, which used articulation to avoid the problems of the P16, was eventually more successful and 126 vehicles were delivered by 1969. This car became popularly known as the ''Mirage''.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nDespite the planning and new rolling stock, a [[referendum]] in 1962 rejected the ''Tiefbahn''. However the proponents of going underground instead proposed a full scale [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]], the [[Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn]] system. This would have been standard gauge and electrified using a third rail, and hence incompatible with the tram system. The lines would have extended further into the suburbs and provided faster transit times than the tramways, which would have been curtailed so as not to compete with the U-Bahn. However this would have been at the expense of a coarser grained network, with much longer distances between U-Bahn stations than between the tram stops they replaced.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1973, the U-Bahn proposal too was rejected in a referendum, but not before several stretches of U-Bahn tunnel had been built. One section of the putative U-Bahn has since been adapted, as described below, for use by trams, whilst another now forms the terminus of the [[Uetliberg railway line|Uetliberg]] and [[Sihltal railway line|Sihltal]] railway lines under the [[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]].<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Extensions and a new model===\n[[File:Zurich Be 4-6 Tram 2000 2075 Waldgarten.jpg|thumb|left|Tram 2000 tram at Waldgarten stop in the tunnel section built for the U-Bahn]]\nIn 1976, the first tram extension since 1954 took place, with the extension of route 4 from Hardturm to [[Werdh\u00f6lzli]]. Unlike the older lines, this extension was built mostly on reserved track, a precedent to be followed by most subsequent extensions.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nThe Werdh\u00f6lzli extension was followed in 1986 by the extension of routes 7 and 9 into new residential areas to the north-east of Z\u00fcrich. This used one of the stretches of tunnel that had been built for the rejected U-Bahn, between Milchbuck and Schwamendingen. The tram route was extended through the tunnel before splitting at Schwamendingen to serve the area beyond, using new surface track. Because the tunnels and stations had been built with [[island platform]]s, whilst Z\u00fcrich trams only have doors on their [[Right- and left-hand traffic#Terminology|nearside]], the section through the tunnel uses left-hand running.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nFrom 1976 onwards, the VBZ tram fleet was further updated, with the introduction of Z\u00fcrich's variant of the [[Tram 2000|Tram 2000 design]] used by several Swiss tram systems. Several sub-classes of the Tram 2000 were purchased, including articulated and non-articulated variants, and some without drivers cabs that could only operate in multiple with other cars. Eventually 171 of these vehicles were delivered, with the last of the class delivered in 1992.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFrom the 1980s onwards, the system was increasingly acclaimed for its success in maintaining a high share of the [[modal split]], and the [[Z\u00fcrich model]] of transport provision was named after it. Beyond the tramway, the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn rail network]] was introduced to serve the region beyond the city boundaries, taking on some of the role that was originally planned for the U-Bahn. In 1990, the city's urban and regional transport were integrated by the introduction of the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund|ZVV]] and its zone-based common fare structure.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n=== Low floors and the Glattalbahn ===\n[[File:Zurich Be 5-6 Cobra 3002 Letzistrasse.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Cobra (tram)|Bombardier Cobra]] low-floor tram on typical VBZ street track]]\nIn 2001, the VBZ took delivery of the first prototypes of a brand-new low-floor design of tram, known as the [[Cobra (tram)|Cobra]].<ref name=vbzfafch/> Despite many teething problems with the prototypes, which were eventually extensively rebuilt, there are now 88 of these trams in service, with the last delivered in 2010. In order to increase the number of low-floor trams in service, 23 trams from the otherwise high-floor Tram 2000 fleet were rebuilt between 2001 and 2005 with the addition of a low-floor centre section.\n\n[[File:Glatttalbahn - \u00d6rlikerhaus 2011-08-22 19-33-44.JPG|thumb|left|The Glattalbahn]]\nFrom the 1950s onwards, the [[Glattal]] region to the north of Z\u00fcrich experienced a rapid boom as population and industry spilled over from nearby Z\u00fcrich, partly driven by the presence of [[Z\u00fcrich Airport]]. Whilst the airport is served by the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|city's S-Bahn rail network]], the economic growth and resulting congestion led to a need for a finer-grained form of public transport. The responsible transport authority (the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Glattal]] or VBG) responded by constructing a new light rail system, the [[Stadtbahn Glattal|Glattalbahn]].

By 2010, it had conducted trials of three existing tram types on its network. These were the [[Stadler Tango]], the [[Siemens Combino]] and the [[Bombardier Flexity]]. It then requested tenders for the supply of 30 new trams, together with an option for the supply of a further 70 vehicles. The first trams were to be delivered in December 2016, and were to be 100% low floor with capacity for at least 225 passengers. In response, by April 2013 five suppliers had submitted bids. As of February 2015, no decision had been made as to which supplier to select, with reports of conflict between city and canton authorities.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?item=210610a | title = Tango, Combino or Flexity? | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = June 2010 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?item=201112 | title = New tram order: The ball is rolling | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = November 2012 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2013&item=080413 | title = Five suppliers vie for tram contract | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = April 2013 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2015&item=260215 | title = More gloom over tram order | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = February 2015 | accessdate = 2015-03-02}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2016, it was announced that VBZ had awarded a contract worth 358 million [[Swiss Franc]]s to [[Bombardier Transportation]] for the supply of 70<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/tram-zuerich-flexity-kommt-erst-im-sommer-2020-zum-einsatz-ld.1524125 | title = Das erste Flexity-Tram kurvt durch Z\u00fcrich \u2013 aber Passagiere d\u00fcrfen noch lange nicht mitfahren | language = German |  work =  Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung | date = 25 November 2019 | accessdate = 25 November 2019}}</ref> 7-section [[Flexity 2]] trams, with an option for a further 70, to be delivered between 2018 and 2023.

A study of nationwide data from across the United States from January 1999 to December 2015 revealed that the rate of attempted suicide among all schoolchildren in grades 9\u201312 declined by 7% and the rate of attempted suicide among schoolchildren of a minority sexual orientation in grades 9\u201312 declined by 14% in states that established same-sex marriage, resulting in about 134,000 fewer children attempting suicide each year in the United States. The researchers took advantage of the gradual manner in which same-sex marriage was established in the United States (expanding from one state in 2004 to all fifty states in 2015) to compare the rate of attempted suicide among children in each state over the time period studied. Once same-sex marriage was established in a particular state, the reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children in that state became permanent. No reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children occurred in a particular state until that state recognized same-sex marriage.

[[Transgender]] and [[intersex]] individuals may be prohibited from marrying partners of the \"opposite\" sex or permitted to marry partners of the \"same\" sex due to legal distinctions.\n\nIn any legal jurisdiction where marriages are defined without distinction of a requirement of a male and female, these complications do not occur. In addition, some legal jurisdictions recognize a legal and official change of gender, which would allow a transgender male or female to be legally married in accordance with an adopted gender identity.<ref>Bockting, Walter, Autumn Benner, and Eli Coleman. \"Gay and Bisexual Identity Development Among Female-to-Male Transsexuals in North America: Emergence of a Transgender Sexuality.\" ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'' 38.5 (October 2009): 688\u2013701.

Because in the United Kingdom marriages were until recently only for mixed-sex couples and civil partnerships are only for same-sex couples, a person must dissolve his/her civil partnership before obtaining a gender recognition certificate{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}, and the same was formerly true for marriages in England and Wales, and still is in other territories. Such people are then free to enter or re-enter civil partnerships or marriages in accordance with their newly recognized gender identity. In Austria, a similar provision requiring transsexual people to divorce before having their legal sex marker corrected was found to be unconstitutional in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.365gay.com/Newscon06/07/070506austria.htm|title=Austria gets first same-sex marriage|publisher=365gay.com|date=5 July 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017161302/http://365gay.com/Newscon06/07/070506austria.htm|archivedate=17 October 2007|accessdate=20 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn Quebec, prior to the legalization of same-sex marriage, only unmarried people could apply for legal change of gender.

A study of nationwide data from across the United States from January 1999 to December 2015 revealed that the rate of attempted suicide among all schoolchildren in grades 9\u201312 declined by 7% and the rate of attempted suicide among schoolchildren of a minority sexual orientation in grades 9\u201312 declined by 14% in states that established same-sex marriage, resulting in about 134,000 fewer children attempting suicide each year in the United States. The researchers took advantage of the gradual manner in which same-sex marriage was established in the United States (expanding from one state in 2004 to all fifty states in 2015) to compare the rate of attempted suicide among children in each state over the time period studied. Once same-sex marriage was established in a particular state, the reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children in that state became permanent. No reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children occurred in a particular state until that state recognized same-sex marriage. The lead researcher of the study observed that \"laws that have the greatest impact on gay adults may make gay kids feel more hopeful for the future\".<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Difference-in-Differences Analysis of the Association Between State Same-Sex Marriage Policies and Adolescent Suicide Attempts|journal=JAMA Pediatrics|volume=171|issue=4|pages=350\u2013356|doi=10.1001/jamapediatrics.2016.4529|pmid=28241285|pmc=5848493|year=2017|last1=Raifman|first1=Julia|last2=Moscoe|first2=Ellen|last3=Austin|first3=S.

[[Transgender]] and [[intersex]] individuals may be prohibited from marrying partners of the \"opposite\" sex or permitted to marry partners of the \"same\" sex due to legal distinctions.\n\nIn any legal jurisdiction where marriages are defined without distinction of a requirement of a male and female, these complications do not occur. In addition, some legal jurisdictions recognize a legal and official change of gender, which would allow a transgender male or female to be legally married in accordance with an adopted gender identity.<ref>Bockting, Walter, Autumn Benner, and Eli Coleman. \"Gay and Bisexual Identity Development Among Female-to-Male Transsexuals in North America: Emergence of a Transgender Sexuality.\" ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'' 38.5 (October 2009): 688\u2013701.

He is known for his ability to grind opponents down through protracted safety exchanges and disjointed breakbuilding. He compiled 105 [[century break]]s in his career.<ref name=\"centurybreaks\">{{cite web|title=Centuries|url=http://www.prosnookerblog.com/centuries/|publisher=Pro Snooker Blog|accessdate=5 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nMcCulloch turned professional in 1992, and after steadily climbing up the rankings for many years, he reached the quarter-finals of a ranking event for the first time in the [[1999 Welsh Open (snooker)|1999 Welsh Open]]. He also made his debut in the Crucible stages of the [[1999 World Snooker Championship|1999 World Championship]].\n\nLike [[Barry Pinches]] he entered his best form in his early 30s. He reached two ranking event finals \u2013 the [[2002 British Open (snooker)|2002 British Open]] (losing to [[Paul Hunter (snooker player)|Paul Hunter]]) and the [[2004 Grand Prix (snooker)|2004 Grand Prix]] in his home town (losing to [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]]).<ref name=\"Profile on BBC Lancashire\">{{Cite web\n| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/lancashire/content/articles/2006/03/29/cue_sports_ian_mac_profile.shtml\n| title = Profile on BBC Lancashire\n| publisher = [[BBC]]\n| date = \n| accessdate = 2008-04-02\n}}</ref>\n\nHe beat [[David Gray (snooker player)|David Gray]] to qualify for the [[2003 World Snooker Championship|2003 World Championship]] in a clash between players who share their names with musicians, and went on to reach the quarter finals in [[2004 World Snooker Championship|2004]]. He went one stage further in [[2005 World Snooker Championship|2005]], losing 14&ndash;17 to [[Matthew Stevens]] in the semi-final, beating [[Graeme Dott]], [[Mark Williams (snooker player)|Mark Williams]] and [[Alan McManus]] en route. He was ranked number 16 in the rankings in [[Snooker world rankings 2005/2006|2005/2006 season]], which would normally guarantee a seeding in the ranking tournaments, but was unluckily pushed out by [[Shaun Murphy (snooker player)|Shaun Murphy]], who as the current [[List of world snooker champions|world champion]] was not in top 16 of the rankings, and was seeded before him in tournaments.\n\nHis [[2005\u201306 snooker season|2005\u201306 season]] proved disappointing, with a quarter-final appearance in the [[2006 Welsh Open (snooker)|Welsh Open]] the highlight. He failed to qualify for the [[2006 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]], losing to [[Dave Harold]], causing him to drop down the rankings. He made his first appearance as a [[BBC]] pundit during the tournament.\n\nAn improved [[2006\u201307 snooker season|2006\u201307]] campaign included a quarter-final run in the [[2006 Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]]. He qualified for the [[2007 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]], and in the first round he eliminated defending champion Graeme Dott 10&ndash;7, but he lost in the second round 8&ndash;13 to [[Anthony Hamilton (snooker player)|Anthony Hamilton]].\n\nIn the [[2007 UK Championship (snooker)|2007 UK Championship]] he also knocked out the defending champion, by coming from 0&ndash;5 down against [[Peter Ebdon]] to beat him 9&ndash;8 in a remarkable comeback. He lost to [[Stephen Maguire]] 5&ndash;9 in the last 16. He missed out on the [[2008 World Snooker Championship|2008 World Championship]] after losing 5&ndash;10 to eventual quarter-finalist, [[Liang Wenbo]].<ref>[http://www.worldsnooker.com/tournament_news(id19228)-96.htm World Snooker News: ?]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310203158/http://www.worldsnooker.com/tournament_news%28id19228%29-96.htm |date=10 March 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[2008\u201309 snooker season|2008\u201309 season]] was a struggle, with only two wins in the first five tournaments. He failed to qualify for the [[2009 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] again, losing to [[Rory McLeod (snooker player)|Rory McLeod]] despite scoring three centuries. After the 2011/12 season, he decided to quit the game for good after finishing number 68 in the world. This was in part motivated by an occupational shoulder injury.<ref>[http://www.lep.co.uk/sport/other-sports/preston-potter-s-got-no-regrets-1-4717262]</ref> His best run was at the Welsh Open where he reached the final qualifying round before losing to Tom Ford 3\u20134.\n\nOn 11 October 2009, he won the Bodensee Open, although he was the only professional player taking part.<ref>[http://www.bodensee-open.ch/English/Players.html Bodensee Open: Who plays?] {{Dead link|date=May 2010}}</ref><ref>[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:EbNhD0zNPGQJ:www.bodensee-open.ch/Bodensee-Open/Start_files/Final%2520-%2520Tableau%2520-%2520Bodensee-Open%25202009.pdf+Bodensee+2009+McCulloch&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESgv_cScPP0x-iMW9dgnAyDRSQSKSbONRhx-KhkJZ_clMTZgx7mzfa3Uq-LvKgWSnotbr8rcG9wIRuGq6-Gu2FXIunVQFfEXrhinUmob3d3QHWDb7T78EmvDPclicVPaKxLV-Z-x&sig=AHIEtbRv89e8zaN4NjmLS7tprrpf3Y4j8A]</ref>\n\n==Broadcasting==\nMcCulloch is a regular pundit for [[William Hill (bookmaker)|William Hill]] and can be heard in their shops previewing Snooker tournaments and as a regular in-studio guest on their In-Play Radio service.\n\n==Performance and rankings timeline==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

He is known for his ability to grind opponents down through protracted safety exchanges and disjointed breakbuilding. He compiled 105 [[century break]]s in his career.<ref name=\"centurybreaks\">{{cite web|title=Centuries|url=http://www.prosnookerblog.com/centuries/|publisher=Pro Snooker Blog|accessdate=5 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nMcCulloch turned professional in 1992, and after steadily climbing up the rankings for many years, he reached the quarter-finals of a ranking event for the first time in the [[1999 Welsh Open (snooker)|1999 Welsh Open]]. He also made his debut in the Crucible stages of the [[1999 World Snooker Championship|1999 World Championship]].\n\nLike [[Barry Pinches]] he entered his best form in his early 30s. He reached two ranking event finals \u2013 the [[2002 British Open (snooker)|2002 British Open]] (losing to [[Paul Hunter (snooker player)|Paul Hunter]]) and the [[2004 Grand Prix (snooker)|2004 Grand Prix]] in his home town (losing to [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]]).<ref name=\"Profile on BBC Lancashire\">{{Cite web\n| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/lancashire/content/articles/2006/03/29/cue_sports_ian_mac_profile.shtml\n| title = Profile on BBC Lancashire\n| publisher = [[BBC]]\n| date = \n| accessdate = 2008-04-02\n}}</ref>\n\nHe beat [[David Gray (snooker player)|David Gray]] to qualify for the [[2003 World Snooker Championship|2003 World Championship]] in a clash between players who share their names with musicians, and went on to reach the quarter finals in [[2004 World Snooker Championship|2004]]. He went one stage further in [[2005 World Snooker Championship|2005]], losing 14&ndash;17 to [[Matthew Stevens]] in the semi-final, beating [[Graeme Dott]], [[Mark Williams (snooker player)|Mark Williams]] and [[Alan McManus]] en route. He was ranked number 16 in the rankings in [[Snooker world rankings 2005/2006|2005/2006 season]], which would normally guarantee a seeding in the ranking tournaments, but was unluckily pushed out by [[Shaun Murphy (snooker player)|Shaun Murphy]], who as the current [[List of world snooker champions|world champion]] was not in top 16 of the rankings, and was seeded before him in tournaments.\n\nHis [[Snooker season 2005/2006|2005/2006 season]] proved disappointing, with a quarter-final appearance in the [[2006 Welsh Open (snooker)|Welsh Open]] the highlight. He failed to qualify for the [[2006 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]], losing to [[Dave Harold]], causing him to drop down the rankings. He made his first appearance as a [[BBC]] pundit during the tournament.\n\nAn improved [[Snooker season 2006/2007|2006/2007]] campaign included a quarter-final run in the [[2006 Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]]. He qualified for the [[2007 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]], and in the first round he eliminated defending champion Graeme Dott 10&ndash;7, but he lost in the second round 8&ndash;13 to [[Anthony Hamilton (snooker player)|Anthony Hamilton]].\n\nIn the [[2007 UK Championship (snooker)|2007 UK Championship]] he also knocked out the defending champion, by coming from 0&ndash;5 down against [[Peter Ebdon]] to beat him 9&ndash;8 in a remarkable comeback. He lost to [[Stephen Maguire]] 5&ndash;9 in the last 16. He missed out on the [[2008 World Snooker Championship|2008 World Championship]] after losing 5&ndash;10 to eventual quarter-finalist, [[Liang Wenbo]].<ref>[http://www.worldsnooker.com/tournament_news(id19228)-96.htm World Snooker News: ?]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310203158/http://www.worldsnooker.com/tournament_news%28id19228%29-96.htm |date=10 March 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Snooker season 2008/2009|2008/2009 season]] was a struggle, with only two wins in the first five tournaments. He failed to qualify for the [[2009 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] again, losing to [[Rory McLeod (snooker player)|Rory McLeod]] despite scoring three centuries. After the 2011/12 season, he decided to quit the game for good after finishing number 68 in the world. This was in part motivated by an occupational shoulder injury.<ref>[http://www.lep.co.uk/sport/other-sports/preston-potter-s-got-no-regrets-1-4717262]</ref> His best run was at the Welsh Open where he reached the final qualifying round before losing to Tom Ford 3-4.\n\nOn 11 October 2009, he won the Bodensee Open, although he was the only professional player taking part.<ref>[http://www.bodensee-open.ch/English/Players.html Bodensee Open: Who plays?] {{Dead link|date=May 2010}}</ref><ref>[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:EbNhD0zNPGQJ:www.bodensee-open.ch/Bodensee-Open/Start_files/Final%2520-%2520Tableau%2520-%2520Bodensee-Open%25202009.pdf+Bodensee+2009+McCulloch&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESgv_cScPP0x-iMW9dgnAyDRSQSKSbONRhx-KhkJZ_clMTZgx7mzfa3Uq-LvKgWSnotbr8rcG9wIRuGq6-Gu2FXIunVQFfEXrhinUmob3d3QHWDb7T78EmvDPclicVPaKxLV-Z-x&sig=AHIEtbRv89e8zaN4NjmLS7tprrpf3Y4j8A]</ref>\n\n==Broadcasting==\nMcCulloch is a regular pundit for [[William Hill (bookmaker)|William Hill]] and can be heard in their shops previewing Snooker tournaments and as a regular in-studio guest on their In-Play Radio service.\n\n==Performance and rankings timeline==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

She graduated from [[Kayseri]] High School and later studied [[pharmacy]], receiving her diploma from the Private Higher School of Pharmacy in Istanbul.\n\nShe worked for 13 years as a pharmacist, and she was deputy chair of the board at Pet Holding as well as chair of the board for the K\u00f6ksal Education Foundation. She was also a member of the Democratic Party Governing Board, and chair of the party's Art Committee.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2007 she was a member of the Ministry of Justice Penal Institutions and Detention Houses Monitoring Board, a post from which she resigned in April 2007 for reasons of health.\n\nShe was married to Prof. Dr. G\u00fcntekin K\u00f6ksal and had two daughters, Ay\u015fe and Zeynep, as well as five grandchildren: Kaya, Ege, Melissa, Rauf and Sinan.\n\nShe died on August 19, 2019, due to complications caused by an operation.<ref name=sanattanyansimalar /><ref name=sozcu />\n\n==Musical career==\nHer musical training began in [[Artvin]] at the age of 9 with [[mandolin]] and violin lessons<ref name=akustik /> from Hasan \u00c7\u0131tak (1955\u201357). At the age of 15 she took [[accordion]] lessons in Kayseri (1961\u201362), and at 36 piano lessons from Veli Gerasim. It was at this time that she made her first compositions (1982\u201383). Her very first composition was \"With You I'm Full, Without You an Empty Shell\" (Waltz of Happiness),<ref>{{YouTube|S46HpX5Ks40}}</ref> a work in the Acemk\u00fcrdi makam for which she wrote the words as well as the music. Her first lessons in Turkish Art Music came from the late composer and artist Sadi Ho\u015fses<ref name=sanart /> (1984). After 1996 she studied for an extended period from the tanburist and composer Y\u0131lmaz Pakal\u0131nlar.<ref name=sanart /> K\u00f6ksal played the lute<ref name=sanart /> and has composed some 120 works, of which 74 are in the TRT ([[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation]]) repertory.<ref name=sanart /> A number of her compositions have been arranged polyphonically, while her works are performed throughout Turkey by various choirs, as well as being rendered on radio stations and television channels. In the year 2000 her album \"\u0130\u00e7imdeki Duygular\" was released, comprising works performed by TRT and Ministry of Culture artists.\n\nHers were the first Turkish art music compositions to be performed polyphonically, on December 16, 2003, by the Orfeon Chamber Chorus with soprano Leyla \u00c7olako\u011flu, tenor Hakan Aysev and bass Deva \u00c7olako\u011flu under the direction of conductor Bujor Hoinic. Her works were sung in the musical fantasy ''Cabaret Opera'' staged by the State Opera and Ballet Company and directed by G\u00fcr\u00e7il \u00c7elikta\u015f, and this work became part of the opera repertory (2004\u20132005).
