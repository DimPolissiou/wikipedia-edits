The anti-immigration populist party New Zealand First won 9 seats, down from 12 in 2014. ACT retained its one seat.

The election resulted in Ardern becoming New Zealand's third female Prime Minister, and Peters being reappointed [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand|Deputy Prime Minister]], a role he had first held in 1996\u201398. This marked an end to nine years under the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|Fifth National Government]], and the beginning of the [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand]].\n\n==Electoral system==\n{{main|Electoral system of New Zealand}}\n\nNew Zealand uses the [[mixed-member proportional]] (MMP) voting system to elect the 120-member House of Representatives. Each voter gets two votes, one for a political party (the party vote) and one for a local candidate (the electorate vote). Political parties which meet the [[electoral threshold|threshold]] (5% of the party vote or one electorate seat) receive seats in the House in proportion to the percentage of the party vote they receive. 71 of the 120 seats are filled by the MPs elected from the [[New Zealand electorates|electorates]], with the winner in each electorate determined by the [[first-past-the-post voting|first past the post method]] (i.e. most votes wins). The remaining 49 seats are filled by candidates from each party's closed [[party list]]. If a party wins more electorates than seats it is entitled to under the party vote, an [[overhang seat|overhang]] results; in this case, the House will add extra seats to cover the overhang. The 2014 election saw a one-seat overhang where [[Peter Dunne]] won the [[\u014ch\u0101riu]] electorate when his [[United Future New Zealand|United Future Party]] was entitled to zero seats under the party vote.\n\nThe political party or party bloc with the majority of the seats in the House forms the [[Government of New Zealand|Government]]. Since the introduction of MMP in 1996, no party has won enough votes to win an outright majority of seats. As a result, parties must negotiate with other parties either to form a [[coalition government]] or to obtain sufficient [[confidence and supply]] to operate as a [[minority government]].\n\nElectorate boundaries in the 2017 election were the same as at the 2014 election, with 64 general electorates (48 in the [[North Island]] and 16 in the [[South Island]]), and 7 M\u0101ori electorates. Boundaries are due to be redrawn in 2019, after the [[2018 New Zealand census|2018 census]].\n\n===Electoral law changes===\nThe Electoral Amendment Act 2017 and the Broadcasting (Election Programmes and Election Advertising) Amendment Act 2017 made a number of changes to the conduct of general elections, including:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL71058_1/electoral-amendment-bill |title=Electoral Amendment Bill \u2013 New Zealand Parliament |publisher=Parliament.nz |accessdate=19 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL71456_1/broadcasting-election-programmes-and-election-advertising |title=Broadcasting (Election Programmes and Election Advertising) Amendment Bill \u2013 New Zealand Parliament |publisher=Parliament.nz |accessdate=19 February 2017}}</ref>\n* Voters no longer have to complete and sign a new enrolment form if they are already enrolled and notify of a change of address, for example, through [[New Zealand Post]]'s mail redirection service.\n* The Electoral Commission no longer is required to send out nominations and polling place information to every voter by post; instead the Commission may use its discretion on how to advertise nominations and polling places.\n* Polling booths may now use electronic electoral rolls to mark off voters.\n* Counting of advance votes may now start earlier at 9:00&nbsp;am (previously 2:00&nbsp;pm), to take into account the increase in people voting in advance.\n* The contact information of sitting MPs, such as business cards and signage on out-of-Parliament offices, has been clarified as not constituting election advertising.\n* Election advertising is now legally prohibited in or near advance polling booths.\n* Election hoardings may now be erected nine weeks before the election (previously two months), so the first day always falls on a Saturday.\n* Parties are no longer allocated free airtime on [[Radio New Zealand]] and [[Television New Zealand]] to broadcast opening and closing addresses.\n\n===Eligibility to vote===\nTo vote in the general election, one must:\n* be on the [[electoral roll]]\n* be aged 18 or over on election day (i.e. born on or before 23 September 1999)\n* be a [[New Zealand citizen]], [[New Zealand permanent residency|permanent resident]], residence visa holder, an Australian citizen or other person entitled to reside in New Zealand indefinitely.\n* have lived in New Zealand for one year or more continuously at some point\n* have been in New Zealand within the last 3 years (for New Zealand citizens) or 1 year (non-New Zealand citizens); public servants and [[New Zealand Defence Force|Defence Force]] personnel on duty outside New Zealand, including their partners and children, are not subject to this rule.\n* not be expressly disqualified from enrolling or voting (e.g., serving a sentence of imprisonment; convicted of a corrupt election practice).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.org.nz/voters/enrol-check-or-update-now/who-can-and-cant-enrol |title=Who can and can't enrol? |publisher=Electoral Commission}}</ref>\n\n==Election schedule==\nUnless an early election is called or the election date is set to circumvent holding a by-election, a general election is held every three years.

Labour held 27 seats, and NZ First, ACT, and United Future held one seat each. Between the 2014 and 2017 elections, one seat changed allegiance: in the [[2015 Northland by-election]], NZ First leader Winston Peters won the seat off National, after MP [[Mike Sabin]] resigned.\n\nFifty-five electorates saw the incumbent MP re-elected, while another 11 saw a new MP elected from the same party as the retiring incumbent.\n\nIn three electorates, the incumbent MP was defeated. Labour candidate and lawyer [[Duncan Webb]] claimed [[Christchurch Central (New Zealand electorate)|Christchurch Central]] off National MP [[Nicky Wagner]]; Labour previously held the electorate continuously from its formation in 1946 until Wagner won it in 2011. After National lost [[Northland (New Zealand electorate)|Northland]] to NZ First leader Winston Peters in 2015, candidate [[Matt King (politician)|Matt King]] claimed the electorate back for National from Peters. Labour candidate and former television presenter [[Tamati Coffey]] claimed [[Waiariki (New Zealand electorate)|Waiariki]] off M\u0101ori Party MP [[Te Ururoa Flavell]]; Flavell's defeat saw the M\u0101ori Party without an electorate seat and with the party polling below 5% in the party vote, saw the party voted out of Parliament. Coffey's win also saw Labour claim a clean sweep of the M\u0101ori electorates for the first time since the 2002 election.\n\nIn [[Hutt South]], National list MP [[Chris Bishop (politician)|Chris Bishop]] claimed the electorate from Labour \u2013 the first time the electorate has swung since its creation in 1996. Contributing to the swing was the 2014 boundary changes which saw the Labour-leaning suburb of [[Naenae]] swapped for the National-leaning western hill suburbs of [[Lower Hutt]], and long standing Labour MP [[Trevor Mallard]] standing down at the election to contest the party list only. In [[\u014ch\u0101riu]], incumbent United Future MP [[Peter Dunne]] stepped down after holding the electorate in various incarnations since 1984. Labour candidate and former police officer [[Greg O'Connor (politician)|Greg O'Connor]] subsequently claimed the electorate.\n\nOverall, National gained one electorate to hold 41, Labour gained two electorates to hold 29, while ACT retained its one electorate seat.\n\n[[Hamilton West (New Zealand electorate)|Hamilton West]] was considered to be New Zealand's [[bellwether]] seat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/94592380/new-face-ready-to-swing-hamilton-west|title=New face ready to swing Hamilton West|website=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |publisher=[[Fairfax New Zealand]]|accessdate=25 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.nzherald.co.nz/hamilton-news/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503366&objectid=11850653|title=Labour MP Sue Moroney pulls out of election|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=25 August 2017}}</ref> Since the formation of the electorate in 1969, the winning candidate was from the party that went on to form the government, with the exception of 1993 when it elected a Labour MP while National went on to form the government (albeit with a one-seat majority).

The election resulted in Ardern becoming New Zealand's third female Prime Minister, and Peters being reappointed [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand|Deputy Prime Minister]], a role he had first held in 1996\u201398. This marked an end to nine years under the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|Fifth National Government]], and the beginning of the [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand]].\n\n==Electoral system==\n{{main|Electoral system of New Zealand}}\n\nNew Zealand uses the [[mixed-member proportional]] (MMP) voting system to elect the 120-member House of Representatives. Each voter gets two votes, one for a political party (the party vote) and one for a local candidate (the electorate vote). Political parties which meet the [[electoral threshold|threshold]] (5% of the party vote or one electorate seat) receive seats in the House in proportion to the percentage of the party vote they receive. 71 of the 120 seats are filled by the MPs elected from the [[New Zealand electorates|electorates]], with the winner in each electorate determined by the [[first-past-the-post voting|first past the post method]] (i.e. most votes wins). The remaining 49 seats are filled by candidates from each party's closed [[party list]]. If a party wins more electorates than seats it is entitled to under the party vote, an [[overhang seat|overhang]] results; in this case, the House will add extra seats to cover the overhang. The 2014 election saw a one-seat overhang where [[Peter Dunne]] won the [[\u014ch\u0101riu]] electorate when his [[United Future New Zealand|United Future Party]] was entitled to zero seats under the party vote.\n\nThe political party or party bloc with the majority of the seats in the House forms the [[Government of New Zealand|Government]]. Since the introduction of MMP in 1996, no party has won enough votes to win an outright majority of seats. As a result, parties must negotiate with other parties either to form a [[coalition government]] or to obtain sufficient [[confidence and supply]] to operate as a [[minority government]].\n\nElectorate boundaries in the 2017 election were the same as at the 2014 election, with 64 general electorates (48 in the [[North Island]] and 16 in the [[South Island]]), and 7 M\u0101ori electorates. Boundaries are due to be redrawn in 2019, after the [[2018 New Zealand census|2018 census]].\n\n===Electoral law changes===\nThe Electoral Amendment Act 2017 and the Broadcasting (Election Programmes and Election Advertising) Amendment Act 2017 made a number of changes to the conduct of general elections, including:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL71058_1/electoral-amendment-bill |title=Electoral Amendment Bill \u2013 New Zealand Parliament |publisher=Parliament.nz |accessdate=19 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/bills-and-laws/bills-proposed-laws/document/00DBHOH_BILL71456_1/broadcasting-election-programmes-and-election-advertising |title=Broadcasting (Election Programmes and Election Advertising) Amendment Bill \u2013 New Zealand Parliament |publisher=Parliament.nz |accessdate=19 February 2017}}</ref>\n* Voters no longer have to complete and sign a new enrolment form if they are already enrolled and notify of a change of address, for example, through [[New Zealand Post]]'s mail redirection service.\n* The Electoral Commission no longer is required to send out nominations and polling place information to every voter by post; instead the Commission may use its discretion on how to advertise nominations and polling places.\n* Polling booths may now use electronic electoral rolls to mark off voters.\n* Counting of advance votes may now start earlier at 9:00&nbsp;am (previously 2:00&nbsp;pm), to take into account the increase in people voting in advance.\n* The contact information of sitting MPs, such as business cards and signage on out-of-Parliament offices, has been clarified as not constituting election advertising.\n* Election advertising is now legally prohibited in or near advance polling booths.\n* Election hoardings may now be erected nine weeks before the election (previously two months), so the first day always falls on a Saturday.\n* Parties are no longer allocated free airtime on [[Radio New Zealand]] and [[Television New Zealand]] to broadcast opening and closing addresses.\n\n===Eligibility to vote===\nTo vote in the general election, one must:\n* be on the [[electoral roll]]\n* be aged 18 or over on election day (i.e. born on or before 23 September 1999)\n* be a [[New Zealand citizen]], [[New Zealand permanent residency|permanent resident]], residence visa holder, an Australian citizen or other person entitled to reside in New Zealand indefinitely.\n* have lived in New Zealand for one year or more continuously at some point\n* have been in New Zealand within the last 3 years (for New Zealand citizens) or 1 year (non-New Zealand citizens); public servants and [[New Zealand Defence Force|Defence Force]] personnel on duty outside New Zealand, including their partners and children, are not subject to this rule.\n* not be expressly disqualified from enrolling or voting (e.g., serving a sentence of imprisonment; convicted of a corrupt election practice).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.org.nz/voters/enrol-check-or-update-now/who-can-and-cant-enrol |title=Who can and can't enrol? |publisher=Electoral Commission}}</ref>\n\n==Election schedule==\nUnless an early election is called or the election date is set to circumvent holding a by-election, a general election is held every three years.

Labour held 27 seats, and NZ First, ACT, and United Future held one seat each. Between the 2014 and 2017 elections, one seat changed allegiance: in the [[2015 Northland by-election]], NZ First leader Winston Peters won the seat off National, after MP [[Mike Sabin]] resigned.\n\nFifty-five electorates saw the incumbent MP re-elected, while another 11 saw a new MP elected from the same party as the retiring incumbent.\n\nIn three electorates, the incumbent MP was defeated. Labour candidate and lawyer [[Duncan Webb]] claimed [[Christchurch Central (New Zealand electorate)|Christchurch Central]] off National MP [[Nicky Wagner]]; Labour previously held the electorate continuously from its formation in 1946 until Wagner won it in 2011. After National lost [[Northland (New Zealand electorate)|Northland]] to NZ First leader Winston Peters in 2015, candidate [[Matt King (politician)|Matt King]] claimed the electorate back for National from Peters. Labour candidate and former television presenter [[Tamati Coffey]] claimed [[Waiariki (New Zealand electorate)|Waiariki]] off M\u0101ori Party MP [[Te Ururoa Flavell]]; Flavell's defeat saw the M\u0101ori Party without an electorate seat and with the party polling below 5% in the party vote, saw the party voted out of Parliament. Coffey's win also saw Labour claim a clean sweep of the M\u0101ori electorates for the first time since the 2002 election.\n\nIn [[Hutt South]], National list MP [[Chris Bishop (politician)|Chris Bishop]] claimed the electorate from Labour \u2013 the first time the electorate has swung since its creation in 1996. Contributing to the swing was the 2014 boundary changes which saw the Labour-leaning suburb of [[Naenae]] swapped for the National-leaning western hill suburbs of [[Lower Hutt]], and long standing Labour MP [[Trevor Mallard]] standing down at the election to contest the party list only. In [[\u014ch\u0101riu]], incumbent United Future MP [[Peter Dunne]] stepped down after holding the electorate in various incarnations since 1984. Labour candidate and former police officer [[Greg O'Connor (politician)|Greg O'Connor]] subsequently claimed the electorate.\n\nOverall, National gained one electorate to hold 41, Labour gained two electorates to hold 29, while ACT retained its one electorate seat.\n\n[[Hamilton West (New Zealand electorate)|Hamilton West]] was considered to be New Zealand's [[bellwether]] seat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/94592380/new-face-ready-to-swing-hamilton-west|title=New face ready to swing Hamilton West|website=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |publisher=[[Fairfax New Zealand]]|accessdate=25 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.nzherald.co.nz/hamilton-news/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503366&objectid=11850653|title=Labour MP Sue Moroney pulls out of election|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=25 August 2017}}</ref> Since the formation of the electorate in 1969, the winning candidate was from the party that went on to form the government, with the exception of 1993 when it elected a Labour MP while National went on to form the government (albeit with a one-seat majority).
