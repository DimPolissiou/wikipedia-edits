In the game, players roll two six-sided dice to move around the game board, buying and trading properties, and developing them with houses and hotels. Players collect rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them into [[bankruptcy]]. Money can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards, and tax squares; players can end up in jail, which they cannot move from until they have met one of several conditions. The game has numerous [[house rules]], and hundreds of different editions exist, as well as many spin-offs and related media. ''Monopoly'' has become a part of international popular culture, having been licensed locally in more than 103 countries and printed in more than 37 languages.\n\n''Monopoly'' is derived from ''[[The Landlord's Game]]'' created by [[Lizzie Magie]] in the United States in 1903 as a way to demonstrate that an economy which rewards wealth creation is better than one where monopolists work under few constraints,<ref name=\"NYT-20150213\" /> and to promote the economic theories of [[Henry George]]\u2014in particular his [[Georgism|ideas about taxation]].<ref>{{cite web|authorlink=Erica Wagner|author=Wagner, Erica|work=[[New Statesman]]|title=Do not pass go: the tangled roots of Monopoly|date=24 June 2015|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2015/06/do-not-pass-go-tangled-roots-monopoly}}</ref> It was first published by [[Parker Brothers]] in 1935 until that firm was eventually absorbed into Hasbro in 1991.

It was intended as an educational tool to illustrate the negative aspects of concentrating land in private [[Monopoly|monopolies]]. She took out a patent in 1904. Her game, ''[[The Landlord's Game]]'', was self-published, beginning in 1906.<ref>{{cite book |last=Orbanes |first=Philip E. |title=Monopoly: The World's Most Famous Game & How it Got that Way |year=2006 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=0-306-81489-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/monopoly00phil/page/22 22] |authorlink=Philip Orbanes |url=https://archive.org/details/monopoly00phil/page/22 }}</ref>\n\nMagie created two sets of rules: an anti-monopolist set in which all were rewarded when wealth was created, and a monopolist set in which the goal was to create monopolies and crush opponents.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/11/secret-history-monopoly-capitalist-game-leftwing-origins|title=The secret history of Monopoly: the capitalist board game's leftwing origins|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nSeveral variant board games, based on her concept, were developed from 1906 through the 1930s; they involved both the process of buying land for its development and the sale of any undeveloped property. Cardboard houses were added and rents increased as they were added to a property.

After the meal, the Todds introduced Darrow to ''The Landlord's Game'', which they then played several times. The game was entirely new to Darrow, and he asked the Todds for a written set of the rules. After that night, Darrow went on to utilize this and distribute the game himself as ''Monopoly''.

A standard set of ''Monopoly'' pieces includes:\n\n===Cards===\nA deck of thirty-two Chance and Community Chest cards (sixteen each) which players draw when they land on the corresponding squares of the track, and follow the instructions printed on them.\n\n===Deeds===\nA [[deed|title deed]] for each property is given to a player to signify ownership, and specifies purchase price, [[Mortgage law|mortgage]] value, the cost of building houses and hotels on that property, and the various [[renting|rents]] depending on how developed the property is. Properties include:\n* Twenty-two streets divided into eight color groups of two or three streets; a player must own all of a color group to build houses or hotels. Once achieved, color group properties must be improved or \"broken down\" evenly. See the section on Rules.\n* Four railroads, players collect $25 rent if they own one railroad; $50 for two; $100 for three; $200 for all four. These are usually replaced by railroad stations in non-U.S. editions of Monopoly.\n* Two [[public utility|utilities]], rent is four times the dice value if one utility is owned, but ten times if both are owned. Hotels and houses cannot be built on utilities or stations. Some country editions have a fixed rent for utilities; for example, the Italian editions has a L. 2,000 ($20) rent if one utility is owned, or L. 10,000 ($100) if both are owned.\n\nThe purchase price for properties varies from $60 to $400 on a U.S. Standard Edition set.\n\n===Dice===\n[[File:Monopoly Dice.png|thumb|2 standard dice, included in the original Monopoly Board Game.]]\nA pair of six-sided [[dice]] is included, with a \"[[#Speed Die|Speed Die]]\" added for variation in 2007.

Unlike money, houses and hotels have a finite supply. If no more are available, no substitute is allowed. In most editions, houses are green and hotels red.\n\n===Money===\n{{Main|Monopoly money}}\n\nOlder U.S. standard editions of the game included a total of '''$15,140''' in the following denominations:\n* 20 $500 bills (orange)\n* 20 $100 bills (beige)\n* 30 $50 bills (blue)\n* 50 $20 bills (green)\n* 40 $10 bills (yellow)\n* 40 $5 bills (pink)\n* 40 $1 bills (white)\n\nNewer (September 2008 and later) U.S. editions provide a total of '''$20,580'''\u201330 of each denomination instead. The colors of some of the bills are also changed: $10s are now blue instead of yellow, $20s are a brighter green than before, and $50s are now purple instead of blue.\n\nEach player begins the game with his or her token on the Go square, and $1,500 (or 1,500 of a localized currency) in play money ($2,500 with the Speed Die). Before September 2008, the money was divided with greater numbers of 20 and 10-dollar bills. Since then, the U.S. version has taken on the British version's initial cash distributions.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! U.S. editions prior to 2008 !!

However, the amount of cash contained in the game is enough for eight players with a slight alteration of bill distribution.\n\n====International currencies====\nPre-Euro German editions of the game started with 30,000 \"Spielmark\" in eight denominations (abbreviated as \"M.\"), and later used seven denominations of the \"Deutsche Mark\" (\"DM.\"). In the classic Italian game, each player received L. 350,000 ($3500) in a two-player game, but L. 50,000 ($500) less for each player more than two. Only in a six-player game does a player receive the equivalent of $1,500. The classic Italian games were played with only four denominations of currency. Both Spanish editions (the Barcelona and Madrid editions) started the game with 150,000 in play money, with a breakdown identical to that of the American version.\n\n====Extra currency====\nAccording to the Parker Brothers rules, Monopoly money is theoretically unlimited; if the bank runs out of money it may issue as much as needed \"by merely writing on any ordinary paper\".<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Monopoly (rules) |url= |publisher=Parker Brothers |page= |date=1973 |location=Salem, Massachusetts |isbn=}}</ref>\nHowever, Hasbro's published Monopoly rules make no mention of this.<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |url=https://www.hasbro.com/common/documents/dad288661c4311ddbd0b0800200c9a66/97DF546B6BF64A70A2A759D3FA5BD804.pdf\n|title=Monopoly (rules)|publisher=Hasbro |date=2016 |location=Pawtucket, Rhode Island}}</ref> Additional paper money can be bought at certain locations, notably game and hobby stores, or downloaded from various websites and printed and cut by hand.

One of the first tokens to come out included a [[Steam locomotive|Steam Locomotive]] which was only released in Deluxe Editions. A Director's Chair token was released in 2011 in limited edition copies of ''[[Under the Boardwalk: The Monopoly Story]]''. Shortly after the 2013 Facebook voting campaign, a limited-edition Golden Token set was released exclusively at various national retailers, such as Target in the U.S., and Tesco in the U.K.<ref name=\"tesc\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.tesco.com/direct/monopoly-limited-edition/674-7141.prd |title=Monopoly Limited Edition|website=tesco.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117030303/http://www.tesco.com/direct/monopoly-limited-edition/674-7141.prd |archive-date=January 17, 2016 |url-status=dead |access-date=September 2, 2018}}</ref> \n\nThe set contained the Battleship, Boot, Iron, Racecar, Scottie Dog, Thimble, Top hat and Wheelbarrow as well as the iron's potential replacements. These replacement tokens included the cat, the guitar, the diamond ring, the helicopter, and the robot.<ref name=\"cbsn0\" /><ref name=cbsn /><ref name=\"tesc\" /> Hasbro released a 64-token limited edition set in 2017 called Monopoly Signature Token Collection to include all of the candidates that were not chosen in the vote held that year.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://shop.hasbro.com/en-in/product/monopoly-signature-token-collection:D73E2FB3-5056-9047-F5BD-9377C9CF51F4 |title=Monopoly Signature Token Collection |website=hasbro.com |access-date=September 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\n\n===Official rules===\n\nPlayers take turns in order with the initial player determined by chance before the game. A typical turn begins with the rolling of the dice and advancing a piece clockwise around the board the corresponding number of squares. If a player rolls doubles, they roll again after completing that portion of their turn. A player who rolls three consecutive sets of doubles on one turn has been \"caught speeding\" and is immediately sent to jail instead of moving the amount shown on the dice for the third roll.\n\nA player who lands on or passes the Go space collects $200 from the bank. Players who land on either Income Tax or Luxury Tax pay the indicated amount to the bank. In older editions of the game, two options were given for Income Tax: either pay a flat fee of $200 or 10% of total net worth (including the current values of all the properties and buildings owned). No calculation could be made before the choice, and no latitude was given for reversing an unwise calculation. In 2008, the calculation option was removed from the official rules, and simultaneously the Luxury Tax was increased to $100 from its original $75. No reward or penalty is given for landing on Free Parking.\n\nProperties can only be developed once a player owns all the properties in that color group. They then must be developed equally. A house must be built on each property of that color before a second can be built. Each property within a group must be within one house level of all the others within that group.\n\n====Chance/Community Chest====\n\nIf a player lands on a Chance or Community Chest space, they draw the top card from the respective deck and follow its instructions. This may include collecting or paying money to the bank or another player or moving to a different space on the board. Two types of cards that involve jail, \"Go to Jail\" and \"[[Get Out of Jail Free card|Get Out of Jail Free]]\", are explained below.\n\n====Jail====\nA player is sent to jail for doing any of the following:\n* Landing directly on \"Go to Jail\"\n* Throwing three consecutive doubles in one turn\n* Drawing a \"Go to Jail\" card from Chance or Community Chest\n\nWhen a player is sent to jail, they move directly to the Jail space and their turn ends (\"[[Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200.]]\"). If an ordinary dice roll (not one of the above events) ends with the player's token on the Jail corner, they are \"Just Visiting\" and can move ahead on their next turn without incurring any penalty.\n\nIf a player is in jail, they do not take a normal turn and must either pay a fine of $50 to be released, use a Chance or Community Chest Get Out of Jail Free card, or attempt to roll doubles on the dice. If a player fails to roll doubles, they lose their turn. Failing to roll doubles for three consecutive turns requires the player to either pay the $50 fine or use a Get Out of Jail Free card, after which they move ahead according to the total rolled. Players in jail may not buy properties directly from the bank since they are unable to move. They can engage all other transactions, such as mortgaging properties, selling/trading properties to other players, buying/selling houses and hotels, collecting rent, and bidding on property auctions. A player who rolls doubles to leave jail does not roll again; however, if the player pays the fine or uses a card to get out and then rolls doubles, they do take another turn.\n\n====Properties====\nIf the player lands on an unowned property, whether street, railroad, or utility, they can buy the property for its listed purchase price. If they decline this purchase, the property is auctioned off by the bank to the highest bidder, including the player who declined to buy.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/news/a47100/monopoly-auction-rule/ |title=We Just Discovered a Game-Changing Monopoly Rule |website=goodhousekeeping.com |access-date=September 2, 2018|date=November 29, 2017 }}</ref> If the property landed on is already owned and unmortgaged, they must pay the owner a given rent; the amount depends on whether the property is part of a set or its level of development.\n\nWhen a player owns all the properties in a color group and none of them are mortgaged, they may develop them during their turn or in between other player's turns. Development involves buying miniature houses or hotels from the bank and placing them on the property spaces; this must be done uniformly across the group. That is, a second house cannot be built on any property within a group until all of them have one house. Once the player owns an entire group, they can collect double rent for any undeveloped properties within it. Although houses and hotels cannot be built on railroads or utilities, the given rent increases if a player owns more than one of either type. If there is a housing shortage (more demand for houses to be built than what remains in the bank), then a housing auction is conducted to determine who will get to purchase each house.\n\n====Mortgaging====\nProperties can also be mortgaged, although all developments on a monopoly must be sold before any property of that color can be mortgaged or traded. The player receives half the purchase price from the bank for each mortgaged property. This must be repaid with 10% interest to clear the mortgage. Houses and hotels can be sold back to the bank for half their purchase price. Players cannot collect rent on mortgaged properties and may not give improved property away to others; however, trading mortgaged properties is allowed. The player receiving the mortgaged property must immediately pay the bank the mortgage price plus 10% or pay just the 10% amount and keep the property mortgaged; if the player chooses the latter, they must pay the 10% again when they pay off the mortgage.\n\n====Bankruptcy====\nA player who cannot pay what they owe is bankrupt and eliminated from the game. If the bankrupt player owes the bank, they must turn all their assets over to the bank, who then auctions off their properties (if they have any), except buildings. If the debt is owed to another player instead, all assets are given to that opponent, except buildings which must be returned to the bank. The new owner must either pay off any mortgages held by the bank on such properties received or pay a fee of 10% of the mortgaged value to the bank if they choose to leave the properties mortgaged. The winner is the remaining player left after all of the others have gone bankrupt.\n\nIf a player runs out of money but still has assets that can be converted to cash, they can do so by selling buildings, mortgaging properties, or trading with other players. To avoid bankruptcy the player must be able to raise enough cash to pay the full amount owed.\n\nA player cannot choose to go bankrupt; if there is any way to pay what they owe, even by returning all their buildings at a loss, mortgaging all their real estate and giving up all their cash, even knowing they are likely going bankrupt the next time, they must do so.\n\n===Official Short Game rules===\nFrom 1936, the rules booklet included with each Monopoly set contained a short section at the end providing rules for making the game shorter, including dealing out two Title Deed cards to each player before starting the game, by setting a time limit or by ending the game after the second player goes bankrupt. A later version of the rules included this variant, along with the time limit game, in the main rules booklet, omitting the last, the second bankruptcy method, as a third short game.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Brady, Maxine | title=The Monopoly Book | publisher=David McKay Company | year=1974 | isbn=0-679-20292-7 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/monopolybookstra00brad/page/143 143\u2013144] | url=https://archive.org/details/monopolybookstra00brad/page/143 | author-link=Maxine Brady }}</ref>\n\n===House rules===\n{{rquote|right|[V]irtually no one plays the game with the rules as written.|''Computer Gaming World'', 1994<ref name=\"cgw199408\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=\n |first=\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |date=August 1994\n |title=These Just In\n |department=Now Playing\n |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1994&pub=2&id=121\n |magazine=Computer Gaming World\n |pages=152\u2013156\n |type=\n}}</ref>}}\n\nMany [[house rules]] have emerged for the game throughout its history. Well-known is the \"Free Parking jackpot rule\", where all the money collected from Income Tax, Luxury Tax, Chance and Community Chest goes to the center of the board instead of the bank. Many people add $500 to start each pile of Free Parking money, guaranteeing a minimum payout. When a player lands on Free Parking, they may take the money. Another rule is that if a player lands directly on Go, they collect double the amount, or $400, instead of $200. Since these rules provide additional cash to players regardless of their property management choices, they can lengthen the game considerably and limit the role of strategy.<ref name=\"ditch\">{{cite web|last=Dove |first=Laurie L. |url=http://www.howstuffworks.com/leisure/brain-games/5-monopoly-house-rules-you-should-ditch.htm |title=5 Monopoly House Rules You Should Ditch |publisher=Howstuffworks.com |accessdate=July 11, 2013|date=February 7, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nVideo game and computer game versions of ''Monopoly'' have options where popular house rules can be used. In 2014, Hasbro determined five popular house rules by public Facebook vote, and released a \"House Rules Edition\" of the board game. Rules selected include a \"Free Parking\" house rule without additional money and forcing players to traverse the board once before buying properties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/hasbro-unveils-worlds-favorite-house-rules-to-be-included-in-future-monopoly-games-2014-04-04|title=Hasbro Unveils World's Favorite \"House Rules\" to Be Included in Future Monopoly Games|work=MarketWatch}}</ref>\n\n==Strategy==\nAccording to Jim Slater in ''[[The Mayfair Set]]'', the Orange property group is the best to own because players land on them more often, as a result of the Chance cards \"Go to Jail\", \"Advance to St. Charles Place (Pall Mall)\", \"Advance to Reading Railroad (Kings Cross Station)\" and \"Go Back Three Spaces\".<ref>{{YouTube|id=PdQ3ztGk0D4|title=The Mayfair Set \u2013 Episode 4 (Adam Curtis, BBC}}</ref>\n\nIn all, during game play, Illinois Avenue (Trafalgar Square) (Red), New York Avenue (Vine Street) (Orange), B&O Railroad (Fenchurch Street Station), and Reading Railroad (Kings Cross Station) are the most frequently landed-upon properties. Mediterranean Avenue (Old Kent Road) (brown), Baltic Avenue (Whitechapel Road) (brown), Park Place (Park Lane) (blue), and Oriental Avenue (The Angel, Islington) (light blue) are the least-landed-upon properties. Among the property groups, the Railroads are most frequently landed upon, as no other group has four properties; Orange has the next highest frequency, followed by Red.<ref>{{cite web| first=Truman| last=Collins| url=http://www.tkcs-collins.com/truman/monopoly/monopoly.shtml| title=Monopoly Square Probabilities| year=1997| accessdate=May 28, 2006}}; the page includes detailed analyses of expected income from each property and discussion of the strategic implications.</ref>\n\n===End game===\nOne common criticism of ''Monopoly'' is that although it has carefully defined termination conditions, it may take an unlimited amount of time to reach them. Edward P. Parker, a former president of [[Parker Brothers]], is quoted as saying, \"We always felt that forty-five minutes was about the right length for a game, but ''Monopoly'' could go on for hours. Also, a game was supposed to have a definite end somewhere.

Shortly after Capitol Novelty introduced ''Stock Exchange'', Parker Brothers bought it from them then marketed their own, slightly redesigned, version as an add-on specifically for their \"new\" ''Monopoly'' game; the Parker Brothers version was available in June 1936. The Free Parking square is covered over by a new Stock Exchange space and the add-on included three Chance and three Community Chest cards directing the player to \"Advance to Stock Exchange\".<ref name=\"sxg\">{{cite web|title=1936 Stock Exchange Game|url=http://monopoly.cdbpdx.com/StEx/|accessdate=October 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Stock Exchange'' add-on was later redesigned and re-released in 1992 under license by [[Chessex]], this time including a larger number of new Chance and Community Chest cards. This version included ten new Chance cards (five \"Advance to Stock Exchange\" and five other related cards) and eleven new Community Chest cards (five \"Advance to Stock Exchange\" and six other related cards; the regular Community Chest card \"From sale of stock you get $45\" is removed from play when using these cards). Many of the original rules applied to this new version (in fact, one optional play choice allows for playing in the original form by only adding the \"Advance to Stock Exchange\" cards to each deck).{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nA ''Monopoly Stock Exchange Edition'' was released in 2001 (although not in the U.S.), this time adding an electronic calculator-like device to keep track of the complex stock figures. This was a full edition, not just an add-on, that came with its own board, money and playing pieces. Properties on the board were replaced by companies on which shares could be floated, and offices and home offices (instead of houses and hotels) could be built.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3065/monopoly-stock-exchange |title=Monopoly: Stock Exchange (2001) |website=boardgamegeek.com |access-date=September 3, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Playmaster====\nPlaymaster, another official add-on, released in 1982, is an electronic device that keeps track of all player movement and dice rolls as well as what properties are still available. It then uses this information to call random auctions and mortgages making it easier to free up cards of a color group. It also plays eight short tunes when key game functions occur; for example when a player lands on a railroad it plays \"[[I've Been Working on the Railroad]]\", and a police car's siren sounds when a player goes to Jail.<ref>{{cite web|work=boardgamegeek.com|url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/5638 |title=BoardGameGeek.com page for the ''Monopoly'' Playmaster electronic accessory|accessdate=January 1, 2006}}</ref>\n\n====''Get Out of Jail'' and ''Free Parking'' Minigames====\nIn 2009, Hasbro released two minigames that can be played as stand-alone games or combined with the ''Monopoly'' game. In ''Get Out of Jail'', the goal is to manipulate a spade under a jail cell to flick out various colored prisoners. The game can be used as an alternative to rolling doubles to get out of jail.<ref>{{cite web|work=boardgamegeek.com|url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/64611/monopoly-get-out-of-jail-mini-game |title=BoardGameGeek.com page for the ''Monopoly'' Get Out of Jail Mini Game|accessdate=October 21, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=hasbro.com|url=http://www.hasbro.com/monopoly/en_US/shop/details.cfm?R=99DA05B8-19B9-F369-108F-46A65BBC8780:en_US |title=Hasbro.com page for the ''Monopoly'' Get Out of Jail Mini Game|accessdate=October 22, 2012}}</ref> In ''Free Parking'', players attempt to balance taxis on a wobbly board.

If \"Mr. Monopoly\" is rolled while there are unowned properties, the player advances forward to the nearest one. Otherwise, the player advances to the nearest property on which rent is owed.

In the game, players roll two six-sided dice to move around the game board, buying and trading properties, and developing them with houses and hotels. Players collect rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them into [[bankruptcy]]. Money can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards, and tax squares; players can end up in jail, which they cannot move from until they have met one of several conditions. The game has numerous [[house rules]], and hundreds of different editions exist, as well as many spin-offs and related media. ''Monopoly'' has become a part of international popular culture, having been licensed locally in more than 103 countries and printed in more than 37 languages.\n\n''Monopoly'' is derived from ''[[The Landlord's Game]]'' created by [[Lizzie Magie]] in the United States in 1903 as a way to demonstrate that an economy which rewards wealth creation is better than one where monopolists work under few constraints,<ref name=\"NYT-20150213\" /> and to promote the economic theories of [[Henry George]]\u2014in particular his [[Georgism|ideas about taxation]].<ref>{{cite web|authorlink=Erica Wagner|author=Wagner, Erica|work=[[New Statesman]]|title=Do not pass go: the tangled roots of Monopoly|date=24 June 2015|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2015/06/do-not-pass-go-tangled-roots-monopoly}}</ref> It was first published by [[Parker Brothers]] in 1935 until that firm was eventually absorbed into Hasbro in 1991.

It was intended as an educational tool to illustrate the negative aspects of concentrating land in private [[Monopoly|monopolies]]. She took out a patent in 1904. Her game, ''[[The Landlord's Game]]'', was self-published, beginning in 1906.<ref>{{cite book |last=Orbanes |first=Philip E. |title=Monopoly: The World's Most Famous Game & How it Got that Way |year=2006 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=0-306-81489-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/monopoly00phil/page/22 22] |authorlink=Philip Orbanes |url=https://archive.org/details/monopoly00phil/page/22 }}</ref>\n\nMagie created two sets of rules: an anti-monopolist set in which all were rewarded when wealth was created, and a monopolist set in which the goal was to create monopolies and crush opponents.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/11/secret-history-monopoly-capitalist-game-leftwing-origins|title=The secret history of Monopoly: the capitalist board game's leftwing origins|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nSeveral variant board games, based on her concept, were developed from 1906 through the 1930s; they involved both the process of buying land for its development and the sale of any undeveloped property. Cardboard houses were added and rents increased as they were added to a property. Magie patented the game again in 1923.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pilon |first=Mary |date=2015 |title=The Monopolists: Obsession, Fury, and the Scandal Behind the World's Favorite Board Game |url= |location=New York, London |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing Plc |pages=30\u201341, 67\u201379, 84\u201389 |isbn=978-1-60819-963-1 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nAccording to an advertisement placed in ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', Charles Todd of Philadelphia recalled the day in 1932 when his childhood friend, Esther Jones, and her husband [[Charles Darrow]] came to their house for dinner. After the meal, the Todds introduced Darrow to ''The Landlord's Game'', which they then played several times. The game was entirely new to Darrow, and he asked the Todds for a written set of the rules. After that night, Darrow went on to utilize this and distribute the game himself as ''Monopoly''.

A standard set of ''Monopoly'' pieces includes:\n\n===Cards===\nA deck of thirty-two Chance and Community Chest cards (sixteen each) which players draw when they land on the corresponding squares of the track, and follow the instructions printed on them.\n\n===Deeds===\nA [[deed|title deed]] for each property is given to a player to signify ownership, and specifies purchase price, [[Mortgage law|mortgage]] value, the cost of building houses and hotels on that property, and the various [[renting|rents]] depending on how developed the property is. Properties include:\n* Twenty-two streets divided into eight color groups of two or three streets; a player must own all of a color group to build houses or hotels. Once achieved, color group properties must be improved or \"broken down\" evenly. See the section on Rules.\n* Four railroads, players collect $25 rent if they own one railroad; $50 for two; $100 for three; $200 for all four. These are usually replaced by railroad stations in non-U.S. editions of Monopoly.\n* Two [[public utility|utilities]], rent is four times the dice value if one utility is owned, but ten times if both are owned. Hotels and houses cannot be built on utilities or stations. Some country editions have a fixed rent for utilities; for example, the Italian editions has a L. 2,000 ($20) rent if one utility is owned, or L. 10,000 ($100) if both are owned.\n\nThe purchase price for properties varies from $60 to $400 on a U.S. Standard Edition set.\n\n===Dice===\n[[File:Monopoly Dice.png|thumb|2 standard dice, included in the original Monopoly Board Game.]]\nA pair of six-sided [[dice]] is included, with a \"[[#Speed Die|Speed Die]]\" added for variation in 2007.

Unlike money, houses and hotels have a finite supply. If no more are available, no substitute is allowed. In most editions, houses are green and hotels red.\n\n===Money===\n{{Main|Monopoly money}}\n\nOlder U.S. standard editions of the game included a total of '''$15,140''' in the following denominations:\n* 20 $500 bills (orange)\n* 20 $100 bills (beige)\n* 30 $50 bills (blue)\n* 50 $20 bills (green)\n* 40 $10 bills (yellow)\n* 40 $5 bills (pink)\n* 40 $1 bills (white)\n\nNewer (September 2008 and later) U.S. editions provide a total of '''$20,580'''\u201330 of each denomination instead. The colors of some of the bills are also changed: $10s are now blue instead of yellow, $20s are a brighter green than before, and $50s are now purple instead of blue.\n\nEach player begins the game with his or her token on the Go square, and $1,500 (or 1,500 of a localized currency) in play money ($2,500 with the Speed Die). Before September 2008, the money was divided with greater numbers of 20 and 10-dollar bills. Since then, the U.S. version has taken on the British version's initial cash distributions.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! U.S. editions prior to 2008 !!

However, the amount of cash contained in the game is enough for eight players with a slight alteration of bill distribution.\n\n====International currencies====\nPre-Euro German editions of the game started with 30,000 \"Spielmark\" in eight denominations (abbreviated as \"M.\"), and later used seven denominations of the \"Deutsche Mark\" (\"DM.\"). In the classic Italian game, each player received L. 350,000 ($3500) in a two-player game, but L. 50,000 ($500) less for each player more than two. Only in a six-player game does a player receive the equivalent of $1,500. The classic Italian games were played with only four denominations of currency. Both Spanish editions (the Barcelona and Madrid editions) started the game with 150,000 in play money, with a breakdown identical to that of the American version.\n\n====Extra currency====\nAccording to the Parker Brothers rules, Monopoly money is theoretically unlimited; if the bank runs out of money it may issue as much as needed \"by merely writing on any ordinary paper\".<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Monopoly (rules) |url= |publisher=Parker Brothers |page= |date=1973 |location=Salem, Massachusetts |isbn=}}</ref>\nHowever, Hasbro's published Monopoly rules make no mention of this.<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |url=https://www.hasbro.com/common/documents/dad288661c4311ddbd0b0800200c9a66/97DF546B6BF64A70A2A759D3FA5BD804.pdf\n|title=Monopoly (rules)|publisher=Hasbro |date=2016 |location=Pawtucket, Rhode Island}}</ref> Additional paper money can be bought at certain locations, notably game and hobby stores, or downloaded from various websites and printed and cut by hand.

A typical turn begins with the rolling of the dice and advancing a piece clockwise around the board the corresponding number of squares. If a player rolls doubles, they roll again after completing that portion of their turn. A player who rolls three consecutive sets of doubles on one turn has been \"caught speeding\" and is immediately sent to jail instead of moving the amount shown on the dice for the third roll.\n\nA player who lands on or passes the Go space collects $200 from the bank. Players who land on either Income Tax or Luxury Tax pay the indicated amount to the bank. In older editions of the game, two options were given for Income Tax: either pay a flat fee of $200 or 10% of total net worth (including the current values of all the properties and buildings owned). No calculation could be made before the choice, and no latitude was given for reversing an unwise calculation. In 2008, the calculation option was removed from the official rules, and simultaneously the Luxury Tax was increased to $100 from its original $75. No reward or penalty is given for landing on Free Parking.\n\nProperties can only be developed once a player owns all the properties in that color group. They then must be developed equally. A house must be built on each property of that color before a second can be built. Each property within a group must be within one house level of all the others within that group.\n\n====Chance/Community Chest====\n\nIf a player lands on a Chance or Community Chest space, they draw the top card from the respective deck and follow its instructions. This may include collecting or paying money to the bank or another player or moving to a different space on the board. Two types of cards that involve jail, \"Go to Jail\" and \"[[Get Out of Jail Free card|Get Out of Jail Free]]\", are explained below.\n\n====Jail====\nA player is sent to jail for doing any of the following:\n* Landing directly on \"Go to Jail\"\n* Throwing three consecutive doubles in one turn\n* Drawing a \"Go to Jail\" card from Chance or Community Chest\n\nWhen a player is sent to jail, they move directly to the Jail space and their turn ends (\"[[Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200.]]\"). If an ordinary dice roll (not one of the above events) ends with the player's token on the Jail corner, they are \"Just Visiting\" and can move ahead on their next turn without incurring any penalty.\n\nIf a player is in jail, they do not take a normal turn and must either pay a fine of $50 to be released, use a Chance or Community Chest Get Out of Jail Free card, or attempt to roll doubles on the dice. If a player fails to roll doubles, they lose their turn. Failing to roll doubles for three consecutive turns requires the player to either pay the $50 fine or use a Get Out of Jail Free card, after which they move ahead according to the total rolled. Players in jail may not buy properties directly from the bank since they are unable to move. They can engage all other transactions, such as mortgaging properties, selling/trading properties to other players, buying/selling houses and hotels, collecting rent, and bidding on property auctions. A player who rolls doubles to leave jail does not roll again; however, if the player pays the fine or uses a card to get out and then rolls doubles, they do take another turn.\n\n====Properties====\nIf the player lands on an unowned property, whether street, railroad, or utility, they can buy the property for its listed purchase price. If they decline this purchase, the property is auctioned off by the bank to the highest bidder, including the player who declined to buy.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/news/a47100/monopoly-auction-rule/ |title=We Just Discovered a Game-Changing Monopoly Rule |website=goodhousekeeping.com |access-date=September 2, 2018|date=November 29, 2017 }}</ref> If the property landed on is already owned and unmortgaged, they must pay the owner a given rent; the amount depends on whether the property is part of a set or its level of development.\n\nWhen a player owns all the properties in a color group and none of them are mortgaged, they may develop them during their turn or in between other player's turns. Development involves buying miniature houses or hotels from the bank and placing them on the property spaces; this must be done uniformly across the group. That is, a second house cannot be built on any property within a group until all of them have one house. Once the player owns an entire group, they can collect double rent for any undeveloped properties within it. Although houses and hotels cannot be built on railroads or utilities, the given rent increases if a player owns more than one of either type. If there is a housing shortage (more demand for houses to be built than what remains in the bank), then a housing auction is conducted to determine who will get to purchase each house.\n\n====Mortgaging====\nProperties can also be mortgaged, although all developments on a monopoly must be sold before any property of that color can be mortgaged or traded. The player receives half the purchase price from the bank for each mortgaged property. This must be repaid with 10% interest to clear the mortgage. Houses and hotels can be sold back to the bank for half their purchase price. Players cannot collect rent on mortgaged properties and may not give improved property away to others; however, trading mortgaged properties is allowed. The player receiving the mortgaged property must immediately pay the bank the mortgage price plus 10% or pay just the 10% amount and keep the property mortgaged; if the player chooses the latter, they must pay the 10% again when they pay off the mortgage.\n\n====Bankruptcy====\nA player who cannot pay what they owe is bankrupt and eliminated from the game. If the bankrupt player owes the bank, they must turn all their assets over to the bank, who then auctions off their properties (if they have any), except buildings. If the debt is owed to another player instead, all assets are given to that opponent, except buildings which must be returned to the bank. The new owner must either pay off any mortgages held by the bank on such properties received or pay a fee of 10% of the mortgaged value to the bank if they choose to leave the properties mortgaged. The winner is the remaining player left after all of the others have gone bankrupt.\n\nIf a player runs out of money but still has assets that can be converted to cash, they can do so by selling buildings, mortgaging properties, or trading with other players. To avoid bankruptcy the player must be able to raise enough cash to pay the full amount owed.\n\nA player cannot choose to go bankrupt; if there is any way to pay what they owe, even by returning all their buildings at a loss, mortgaging all their real estate and giving up all their cash, even knowing they are likely going bankrupt the next time, they must do so.\n\n===Official Short Game rules===\nFrom 1936, the rules booklet included with each Monopoly set contained a short section at the end providing rules for making the game shorter, including dealing out two Title Deed cards to each player before starting the game, by setting a time limit or by ending the game after the second player goes bankrupt. A later version of the rules included this variant, along with the time limit game, in the main rules booklet, omitting the last, the second bankruptcy method, as a third short game.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Brady, Maxine | title=The Monopoly Book | publisher=David McKay Company | year=1974 | isbn=0-679-20292-7 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/monopolybookstra00brad/page/143 143\u2013144] | url=https://archive.org/details/monopolybookstra00brad/page/143 | author-link=Maxine Brady }}</ref>\n\n===House rules===\n{{rquote|right|[V]irtually no one plays the game with the rules as written.|''Computer Gaming World'', 1994<ref name=\"cgw199408\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=\n |first=\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |date=August 1994\n |title=These Just In\n |department=Now Playing\n |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1994&pub=2&id=121\n |magazine=Computer Gaming World\n |pages=152\u2013156\n |type=\n}}</ref>}}\n\nMany [[house rules]] have emerged for the game throughout its history. Well-known is the \"Free Parking jackpot rule\", where all the money collected from Income Tax, Luxury Tax, Chance and Community Chest goes to the center of the board instead of the bank. Many people add $500 to start each pile of Free Parking money, guaranteeing a minimum payout. When a player lands on Free Parking, they may take the money. Another rule is that if a player lands directly on Go, they collect double the amount, or $400, instead of $200. Since these rules provide additional cash to players regardless of their property management choices, they can lengthen the game considerably and limit the role of strategy.<ref name=\"ditch\">{{cite web|last=Dove |first=Laurie L. |url=http://www.howstuffworks.com/leisure/brain-games/5-monopoly-house-rules-you-should-ditch.htm |title=5 Monopoly House Rules You Should Ditch |publisher=Howstuffworks.com |accessdate=July 11, 2013|date=February 7, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nVideo game and computer game versions of ''Monopoly'' have options where popular house rules can be used. In 2014, Hasbro determined five popular house rules by public Facebook vote, and released a \"House Rules Edition\" of the board game. Rules selected include a \"Free Parking\" house rule without additional money and forcing players to traverse the board once before buying properties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/hasbro-unveils-worlds-favorite-house-rules-to-be-included-in-future-monopoly-games-2014-04-04|title=Hasbro Unveils World's Favorite \"House Rules\" to Be Included in Future Monopoly Games|work=MarketWatch}}</ref>\n\n==Strategy==\nAccording to Jim Slater in ''[[The Mayfair Set]]'', the Orange property group is the best to own because players land on them more often, as a result of the Chance cards \"Go to Jail\", \"Advance to St. Charles Place (Pall Mall)\", \"Advance to Reading Railroad (Kings Cross Station)\" and \"Go Back Three Spaces\".<ref>{{YouTube|id=PdQ3ztGk0D4|title=The Mayfair Set \u2013 Episode 4 (Adam Curtis, BBC}}</ref>\n\nIn all, during game play, Illinois Avenue (Trafalgar Square) (Red), New York Avenue (Vine Street) (Orange), B&O Railroad (Fenchurch Street Station), and Reading Railroad (Kings Cross Station) are the most frequently landed-upon properties. Mediterranean Avenue (Old Kent Road) (brown), Baltic Avenue (Whitechapel Road) (brown), Park Place (Park Lane) (blue), and Oriental Avenue (The Angel, Islington) (light blue) are the least-landed-upon properties. Among the property groups, the Railroads are most frequently landed upon, as no other group has four properties; Orange has the next highest frequency, followed by Red.<ref>{{cite web| first=Truman| last=Collins| url=http://www.tkcs-collins.com/truman/monopoly/monopoly.shtml| title=Monopoly Square Probabilities| year=1997| accessdate=May 28, 2006}}; the page includes detailed analyses of expected income from each property and discussion of the strategic implications.</ref>\n\n===End game===\nOne common criticism of ''Monopoly'' is that although it has carefully defined termination conditions, it may take an unlimited amount of time to reach them. Edward P. Parker, a former president of [[Parker Brothers]], is quoted as saying, \"We always felt that forty-five minutes was about the right length for a game, but ''Monopoly'' could go on for hours. Also, a game was supposed to have a definite end somewhere. In ''Monopoly'' you kept going around and around.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Brandreth|first=Gyles|authorlink=Gyles Brandreth|title=The Monopoly Omnibus|edition=First hardcover|year=1985|publisher=Willow Books|isbn=0-00-218166-5|page=19}}</ref>\n\nHasbro states that the longest game of ''Monopoly'' ever played lasted 70 days<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hasbro.com/monopoly/en_US/discover/history.cfm |title=Monopoly History and Fun Facts |website=hasbro.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810014137/http://www.hasbro.com/monopoly/en_US/discover/history.cfm |archive-date=August 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |access-date=September 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Related games==\n\n===Add-ons===\nNumerous add-ons have been produced for ''Monopoly'', sold independently from the game both before its commercialization and after, with three official ones discussed below:\n\n====''Stock Exchange''====\nThe original ''Stock Exchange'' add-on was published by Capitol Novelty Co. of [[Rensselaer, New York]] in early 1936.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9466/monopoly-stock-exchange-add |title=Monopoly Stock Exchange |website=boardgamegeek.com |access-date=September 3, 2018}}</ref> It was marketed as an add-on for ''Monopoly'', ''Finance'', or ''Easy Money'' games. Shortly after Capitol Novelty introduced ''Stock Exchange'', Parker Brothers bought it from them then marketed their own, slightly redesigned, version as an add-on specifically for their \"new\" ''Monopoly'' game; the Parker Brothers version was available in June 1936. The Free Parking square is covered over by a new Stock Exchange space and the add-on included three Chance and three Community Chest cards directing the player to \"Advance to Stock Exchange\".<ref name=\"sxg\">{{cite web|title=1936 Stock Exchange Game|url=http://monopoly.cdbpdx.com/StEx/|accessdate=October 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Stock Exchange'' add-on was later redesigned and re-released in 1992 under license by [[Chessex]], this time including a larger number of new Chance and Community Chest cards. This version included ten new Chance cards (five \"Advance to Stock Exchange\" and five other related cards) and eleven new Community Chest cards (five \"Advance to Stock Exchange\" and six other related cards; the regular Community Chest card \"From sale of stock you get $45\" is removed from play when using these cards). Many of the original rules applied to this new version (in fact, one optional play choice allows for playing in the original form by only adding the \"Advance to Stock Exchange\" cards to each deck).{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nA ''Monopoly Stock Exchange Edition'' was released in 2001 (although not in the U.S.), this time adding an electronic calculator-like device to keep track of the complex stock figures. This was a full edition, not just an add-on, that came with its own board, money and playing pieces. Properties on the board were replaced by companies on which shares could be floated, and offices and home offices (instead of houses and hotels) could be built.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3065/monopoly-stock-exchange |title=Monopoly: Stock Exchange (2001) |website=boardgamegeek.com |access-date=September 3, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Playmaster====\nPlaymaster, another official add-on, released in 1982, is an electronic device that keeps track of all player movement and dice rolls as well as what properties are still available. It then uses this information to call random auctions and mortgages making it easier to free up cards of a color group. It also plays eight short tunes when key game functions occur; for example when a player lands on a railroad it plays \"[[I've Been Working on the Railroad]]\", and a police car's siren sounds when a player goes to Jail.<ref>{{cite web|work=boardgamegeek.com|url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/5638 |title=BoardGameGeek.com page for the ''Monopoly'' Playmaster electronic accessory|accessdate=January 1, 2006}}</ref>\n\n====''Get Out of Jail'' and ''Free Parking'' Minigames====\nIn 2009, Hasbro released two minigames that can be played as stand-alone games or combined with the ''Monopoly'' game. In ''Get Out of Jail'', the goal is to manipulate a spade under a jail cell to flick out various colored prisoners.

If \"Mr. Monopoly\" is rolled while there are unowned properties, the player advances forward to the nearest one. Otherwise, the player advances to the nearest property on which rent is owed. In the ''Monopoly: Mega Edition'', rolling the bus allows the player to take the regular dice move, then either take a bus ticket or move to the nearest draw card space. \n\nMega rules specifies that triples do not count as doubles for going to jail as the player does not roll again.<ref>{{cite news|title=Monopoly: Mega Edition Rules|url=https://winning-moves.com/images/megamonopolyrules.pdf|accessdate=November 2, 2016 |publisher=Winning Moves, Inc|date=2006|pages=2\u20133}}</ref> Used in a regular edition, the bus (properly \"get off the bus\") allows the player to use only one of the two numbered dice or the sum of both, thus a roll of 1, 5, and bus would let the player choose between moving 1, 5, or 6 spaces.<ref>{{cite web|title=Monopoly Rules|url=http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/00009.pdf |website=Hasbro.com |publisher= Hasbro |accessdate= November 2, 2016 |pages=1\u20132 |date=2007}}</ref> The Speed Die is used throughout the game in the \"Mega Edition\", while in the \"Regular Edition\" it is used by any player who has passed GO at least once.

For the 2003 Championship, qualification was limited to the first fifty people who correctly completed an online quiz. Out of concerns that such methods of qualifying might not always ensure a competition of the best players, the 2009 Championship qualifying was expanded to include an online multiple-choice quiz (a score of 80% or better was required to advance); followed by an online five-question essay test; followed by a two-game online tournament at Pogo.com. The process was to have produced a field of 23 plus one: [[Matthew McNally|Matt McNally]], the 2003 national champion, who received a bye and was not required to qualify. However, at the end of the online tournament, there was an eleven-way tie for the last six spots. The decision was made to invite all of those who had tied for said spots. In fact, two of those who had tied and would have otherwise been eliminated, Dale Crabtree of Indianapolis, Indiana, and Brandon Baker, of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, played in the final game and finished third and fourth respectively.<ref name=\"Tostado, Kevin 2010\">Tostado, Kevin.

The new game uses its own currency unit, the Monopolonian (a game-based take on the Euro; designated by '''<s>M</s>'''). The game uses said unit in millions and thousands. As seen below, there is no dark purple color-group, as that is replaced by brown, as in the European version of the game.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nIt is also notable that three cities ([[Montreal]], [[Toronto]], and [[Vancouver]]) are from Canada and three other cities (Beijing, Hong Kong, and Shanghai) are from the People's Republic of China. No other countries are represented by more than one city.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nOf the 68 cities listed on Hasbro Inc.'s website for the vote, [[Jerusalem]] was chosen as one of the 20 cities to be featured in the newest ''Monopoly'' World Edition.<ref name=\"MSNBC\">[https://www.nbcnews.com/id/23281286 ''Monopoly'' Contest Stirs Up Jerusalem Conflict], Associated Press, published February 21, 2008.</ref> Before the vote took place, a Hasbro employee in the London office eliminated the country signifier \"Israel\" after the city, in response to pressure from pro-[[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[advocacy group]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jergames.blogspot.com/2008/02/from-hasbro-regarding-removal-of-israel.html |title=From Hasbro, regarding removal of Israel from World Monopoly vote |date=February 20, 2008}}</ref> After the Israeli government protested, Hasbro Inc. issued a statement that read: \"It was a bad decision, one that we rectified relatively quickly.

The cited phrase, \"Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200\", distinguishes the effect from other cards that move players; other cards use the phrasing \"Advance to [a particular location]\", which does allow the player to collect $200 if they pass Go during the advance.

It starred [[Bob Chitty]], a well-known [[Australian rules football]]er, as Ned Kelly.\n\nIn 1967, independent filmmaker [[Garry Shead]] directed and produced ''[[Stringybark Massacre]]'', an [[avant garde]] re-creation of the murder of the three police officers at [[Stringybark Creek]].\n\nThe next major film of the Kelly story was ''[[Ned Kelly (1970 film)|Ned Kelly]]'' (1970), directed by [[Tony Richardson]] and starring [[Mick Jagger]] of [[The Rolling Stones]] as Ned Kelly. It was not a success and during its making it led to a protest by Australian [[Actors Equity of Australia|Actors Equity]] over the importation of Jagger, with complaints from Kelly family descendants and others over the film being shot in [[New South Wales]], rather than in the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] locations where most of the events actually took place.\n\n[[Yahoo Serious]] wrote, directed and starred in the 1993 satire film ''[[Reckless Kelly]]'' as a descendant of Ned Kelly.\n\nIn 2003, ''[[Ned Kelly (2003 film)|Ned Kelly]]'', a $30&nbsp;million budget movie about Kelly's life was released.

Based on [[Robert Drewe]]'s book ''[[Our Sunshine]]'', the film covers the period from Kelly's arrest for horse theft as a teenager to the gang's armour-clad battle at Glenrowan. It attempts to portray the events from the perspectives of both Kelly and of the authorities responsible for his capture and prosecution and throws in a romance between Kelly and a married upper-class Australian woman.

Actor [[John Jarratt]] starred as Kelly.\n\nIn the 1990s British ads for the cereal [[Weetabix]] implied that it made the eater so strong and powerful that others were terrified of him. One such TV ad had Kelly in full armour in a hut under siege by the police. As the officer in charge calls for his surrender, Kelly emerges from the hut with a spoon and cereal bowl, threatening to \"eat the Weetabix\" if they make a false move. The officer tells his men to stand back since Kelly is not bluffing. One of them cocks his rifle, whereupon Kelly brings the spoon to his mouth only to find that the mouthpiece in his helmet is too small for the spoon. Thus he cannot carry out his threat and is forced to surrender.<ref>{{Citation|last=nicholas corrigan|title=weetabix advert ned kelly 108|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnYnNzs40K8|access-date=2018-12-08}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 2000s, a [[Nurofen]] advertisement featured Ned Kelly in his last stand at Glenrowan, engaging in a firefight against police officers besieging the Glenrowan Hotel, which he is occupying. Midway through the fight, Ned suffers a headache, and withdraws into the hotel. Removing his helmet and placing it on a nearby table, Ned slumps against a fireplace, pulls a box of Nurofen tablets out of his coat pocket and consumes a tablet, giving him immediate relief from his headache. After a few seconds of relief, Ned is snapped back to reality when police officers fire at the hotel, destroying a clock sitting on the mantelpiece above him. Remembering that his helmet is sitting on a table near him, he pushes it in front of the window. Seeing the helmet in the window, the police mistake it for being Ned and fire at it. This distraction allows Ned to escape the hotel via the back door, and by the time the police realise the ruse, Ned is galloping away on a horse.<ref>{{Citation|last=KHCasting|title=Nurofen TVC|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lwp9Gh1FZk|access-date=2018-12-08}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=staffprod|title=\"Ned Kelly\" - Nurofen (directed by David Denneen)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjP5bHwyYCU|access-date=2018-12-08}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Wilkono|title=Nurofen Commercial - Ned Kelly|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a7uz14T5L0|access-date=2018-12-08}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n[[Waylon Jennings]] recorded \"Blame it on the Kellys\" which was included in the soundtrack for the 1970 film ''Ned Kelly''.\nIn 1971, US country singer [[Johnny Cash]] wrote and recorded the song \"Ned Kelly\" for his album ''[[Man in Black (album)|The Man in Black]]''.\n\n\"Shelter for my Soul\" was written and recorded by [[Powderfinger]] frontman [[Bernard Fanning]] for the 2003 film ''Ned Kelly''.

Midway through the fight, Ned suffers a headache, and withdraws into the hotel. Removing his helmet and placing it on a nearby table, Ned slumps against a fireplace, pulls a box of Nurofen tablets out of his coat pocket and consumes a tablet, giving him immediate relief from his headache. After a few seconds of relief, Ned is snapped back to reality when police officers fire at the hotel, destroying a clock sitting on the mantelpiece above him. Remembering that his helmet is sitting on a table near him, he pushes it in front of the window. Seeing the helmet in the window, the police mistake it for being Ned and fire at it. This distraction allows Ned to escape the hotel via the back door, and by the time the police realise the ruse, Ned is galloping away on a horse.<ref>{{Citation|last=KHCasting|title=Nurofen TVC|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lwp9Gh1FZk|access-date=2018-12-08}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=staffprod|title=\"Ned Kelly\" - Nurofen (directed by David Denneen)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjP5bHwyYCU|access-date=2018-12-08}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Wilkono|title=Nurofen Commercial - Ned Kelly|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a7uz14T5L0|access-date=2018-12-08}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n[[Waylon Jennings]] recorded \"Blame it on the Kellys\" which was included in the soundtrack for the 1970 film ''Ned Kelly''.\nIn 1971, US country singer [[Johnny Cash]] wrote and recorded the song \"Ned Kelly\" for his album ''[[Man in Black (album)|The Man in Black]]''.\n\n\"Shelter for my Soul\" was written and recorded by [[Powderfinger]] frontman [[Bernard Fanning]] for the 2003 film ''Ned Kelly''.

Getting involved in politics can be very dangerous. There are a lot of doors that can shut when you get involved in politics.\"<ref name=\"prasad\"/> He is a supporter of [[Scottish independence]] because he is \"dismayed\" by the UK's [[Euroscepticism in the United Kingdom|anti-European]] stance and does not believe a \"London-based government\" is \"beneficial to the UK as a whole\". Fish argued that independence could \"shake up British politics\" to ensure a more \"fair distribution of wealth\" throughout the UK. However, he declined to actively campaign in the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum]] because he believed it would be \"hypocritical\" as he was planning to leave Scotland for Germany to live with his partner and her young son.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/fish-turns-down-yes-role-over-germany-move-1-3479476|title=Fish turns down Yes role over Germany

September 22, 2002), also known as '''the Fan Man''', was an American [[parachute|parachutist]] and [[paragliding|paraglider]] pilot  known for his appearances at various sporting events. His most infamous appearance was the November 6, 1993 [[boxing]] [[Riddick Bowe vs. Evander Holyfield II|match]] between [[Evander Holyfield]] and [[Riddick Bowe]] at [[Caesars Palace]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Fan Man made headlines in the [[United States]] when he used his [[Powered paragliding|powered paraglider]] to fly into the arena, eventually crashing into the side of the ring.\n\n==Background==\nMiller was born in [[Havre de Grace, Maryland|Havre de Grace]], [[Maryland]]. He had three younger brothers and two younger sisters. In 1975, the Miller family moved to a country home near the [[Canada\u2013United States border]]. The following year, the family relocated to [[Tok, Alaska]]. Miller later earned an associate degree in computer programming from the [[University of Alaska Southeast|University of Alaska at Juneau]]. In the late 1980s, he moved to [[Las Vegas]] where he was introduced to [[Paragliding|paragliders]].<ref name=\"joling\">{{cite web|url=http://peninsulaclarion.com/stories/032303/ala_032303ala0020001.shtml|title=Death claims flamboyant Fan Man|last=Joling|first=Dan|date=March 23, 2003|publisher=peninsulaclarion.com|accessdate=January 15, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050215095035/http://peninsulaclarion.com/stories/032303/ala_032303ala0020001.shtml|archivedate=February 15, 2005}}</ref>\n\nMiller had been interested in flying since childhood and quickly became a paragliding enthusiast. \nHe started with a jetpack tied to his back, and moved up to two-cycle aircraft engines which powered him through the skies above the desert. He began setting power-gliding records for altitude and distance, with a reputation for reckless daring.<ref>{{cite news| title=Obituary | newspaper=Anchorage Daily News| date=March 21, 2003}}</ref>\n\n==The Fan Man fight==\n{{Main article|Riddick Bowe vs. Evander Holyfield II}}\nMiller's first and most famous stunt happened on November 6, 1993 during the [[heavyweight]] title fight between Riddick Bowe and Evander Holyfield. Miller descended into the side of the ring area during the second minute of the seventh round of the fight, after circling [[Caesars Palace]] for ten minutes. The lines of his [[paraglider]] became tangled in the overhead lights, after which he landed on the top rope of the ring with his parachute still tangled in the lights. He tried to hang on with one foot and one hand on that top rope for a few seconds until he either fell or was dragged down into the crowd by spectators, his parachute ripping away from the lights above.\n\nFans and the fighters' security detail swarmed around him immediately and began attacking him. He was knocked unconscious during the attack.  One security officer reportedly struck Miller twenty times. He was rushed to a nearby hospital as spectators cut his paraglider into pieces for souvenirs. After his release from the hospital, Miller was taken to the [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]] Detention Center, where he was charged with dangerous flying and released on $200 bail. In an exclusive interview with British journalists after the bout, Miller categorized his ring crash as accidental and not intentional, claiming it was caused by mechanical problems.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=19931111&id=-zcfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=G88EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6713,3676022|title=Fan Man says landing was accidental|date=November 11, 1993|work=Herald-Journal|page=D2}}</ref> Miller later joked, \"It was a heavyweight fight and I was the only guy who got knocked out.\"<ref name=\"davies\">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1426499/Deported-Palace-paraglider-kills-himself-in-Alaska.html|title=Deported Palace paraglider kills himself in Alaska|last=Davies|first=Caroline|date=April 3, 2003|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe media immediately dubbed Miller \"Fan Man,\" for the [[paramotor]] (lightweight engine and propeller) attached to his harness.\n\n==Other stunts==\nOn January 9, 1994, Miller circled approximately 1,000 feet over the rim of the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] on his paraglider during the [[Denver Broncos]]-[[Oakland Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]] [[NFL]] playoff game.

After serving a seven-day prison sentence, Miller was [[deportation|deported]] by British authorities.<ref name=\"observer\"/>\n\nOn February 5 he was witnessed by British police paragliding along [[The Mall, London|The Mall]] before landing atop [[Buckingham Palace]].

He claimed that he intentionally landed in the ring to break up the Bowe vs. Holyfield match, claiming he was opposed to violence.<ref name=\"observer\">{{cite news| url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1337278,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=The 30 most outrageous sporting moments}}</ref> Miller's younger brother later said Miller staged the stunts because, \"He was basically bucking society. He was mocking our rules, making up his own as he went along, kind of just making a mockery of our society and the way it works and what our expectations are.\"<ref name=\"joling\"/>\n\n==Later years and death ==\nAfter returning to the United States, Miller received death threats for interrupting sporting events. In 1996, he relocated to [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]], [[Alaska]] where he lived in a hut with no indoor plumbing. He continued to fly [[ultralight aircraft]] and paragliders in the Alaskan [[wilderness]] and also gave lessons. Miller briefly worked for a computer company before opening his own computer business.<ref name=\"observer\"/> In 2001, he was diagnosed with [[coronary artery disease]] and underwent [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|double bypass surgery]]. There were complications and Miller developed health issues. He underwent two additional surgeries to correct issues caused by the first surgery, but continued to experience constant chest pains and ill health. Miller was unable to continue flying, paragliding and hiking because of his declining health. Due to mounting debts from medical bills, Miller was forced to close his computer business. He moved to [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] in 2002, where he worked for a utility company.<ref name=\"joling\"/>\n\nOn September 22, 2002, Miller was reported missing after he disappeared earlier that morning while driving to the wilderness. His car was found near the Resurrection Pass Trail in [[Chugach National Forest]] on the [[Kenai Peninsula]]. A search was launched but was suspended on October 13.<ref name=\"joling\"/> On March 9, 2003, a group of hunters [[Trail blazing|bushwhacking]] through the woods on the peninsula found Miller's decomposing body.

September 22, 2002), also known as '''the Fan Man''', was an American [[parachute|parachutist]] and [[paragliding|paraglider]] pilot  known for his appearances at various sporting events. His most infamous appearance was the November 6, 1993 [[boxing]] [[Riddick Bowe vs. Evander Holyfield II|match]] between [[Evander Holyfield]] and [[Riddick Bowe]] at [[Caesars Palace]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Fan Man made headlines in the [[United States]] when he used his [[Powered paragliding|powered paraglider]] to fly into the arena, eventually crashing into the side of the ring.\n\n==Background==\nMiller was born in [[Havre de Grace, Maryland|Havre de Grace]], [[Maryland]]. He had three younger brothers and two younger sisters. In 1975, the Miller family moved to a country home near the [[Canada\u2013United States border]]. The following year, the family relocated to [[Tok, Alaska]]. Miller later earned an associate degree in computer programming from the [[University of Alaska Southeast|University of Alaska at Juneau]]. In the late 1980s, he moved to [[Las Vegas]] where he was introduced to [[Paragliding|paragliders]].<ref name=\"joling\">{{cite web|url=http://peninsulaclarion.com/stories/032303/ala_032303ala0020001.shtml|title=Death claims flamboyant Fan Man|last=Joling|first=Dan|date=March 23, 2003|publisher=peninsulaclarion.com|accessdate=January 15, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050215095035/http://peninsulaclarion.com/stories/032303/ala_032303ala0020001.shtml|archivedate=February 15, 2005}}</ref>\n\nMiller had been interested in flying since childhood and quickly became a paragliding enthusiast. \nHe started with a jetpack tied to his back, and moved up to two-cycle aircraft engines which powered him through the skies above the desert. He began setting power-gliding records for altitude and distance, with a reputation for reckless daring.<ref>{{cite news| title=Obituary | newspaper=Anchorage Daily News| date=March 21, 2003}}</ref>\n\n==The Fan Man fight==\n{{Main article|Riddick Bowe vs. Evander Holyfield II}}\nMiller's first and most famous stunt happened on November 6, 1993 during the [[heavyweight]] title fight between Riddick Bowe and Evander Holyfield. Miller descended into the side of the ring area during the second minute of the seventh round of the fight, after circling [[Caesars Palace]] for ten minutes. The lines of his [[paraglider]] became tangled in the overhead lights, after which he landed on the top rope of the ring with his parachute still tangled in the lights. He tried to hang on with one foot and one hand on that top rope for a few seconds until he either fell or was dragged down into the crowd by spectators, his parachute ripping away from the lights above.\n\nFans and the fighters' security detail swarmed around him immediately and began attacking him. He was knocked unconscious during the attack.  One security officer reportedly struck Miller twenty times. He was rushed to a nearby hospital as spectators cut his paraglider into pieces for souvenirs. After his release from the hospital, Miller was taken to the [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]] Detention Center, where he was charged with dangerous flying and released on $200 bail. In an exclusive interview with British journalists after the bout, Miller categorized his ring crash as accidental and not intentional, claiming it was caused by mechanical problems.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=19931111&id=-zcfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=G88EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6713,3676022|title=Fan Man says landing was accidental|date=November 11, 1993|work=Herald-Journal|page=D2}}</ref> Miller later joked, \"It was a heavyweight fight and I was the only guy who got knocked out.\"<ref name=\"davies\">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1426499/Deported-Palace-paraglider-kills-himself-in-Alaska.html|title=Deported Palace paraglider kills himself in Alaska|last=Davies|first=Caroline|date=April 3, 2003|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe media immediately dubbed Miller \"Fan Man,\" for the [[paramotor]] (lightweight engine and propeller) attached to his harness.\n\n==Other stunts==\nOn January 9, 1994, Miller circled approximately 1,000 feet over the rim of the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] on his paraglider during the [[Denver Broncos]]-[[Oakland Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]] [[NFL]] playoff game. He landed in a park north of the Coliseum where he was arrested for interfering with a sporting event.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&dat=19940108&id=ODozAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ojIHAAAAIBAJ&pg=5330,897748|title=Glider buzzes Raiders game|date=January 10, 1994|work=Lodi News-Sentinel|page=15|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}</ref> Later that same month, he \"buzzed\", (flew low over), a [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]-[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 4th round [[FA Cup]] [[association football|football]] match at [[Burnden Park]] in [[Bolton, England]]. After serving a seven-day prison sentence, Miller was [[deportation|deported]] by British authorities.<ref name=\"observer\"/>\n\nOn February 5 he was witnessed by British police paragliding along [[The Mall, London|The Mall]] before landing atop [[Buckingham Palace]].

He was mocking our rules, making up his own as he went along, kind of just making a mockery of our society and the way it works and what our expectations are.\"<ref name=\"joling\"/>\n\n==Later years and death ==\nAfter returning to the United States, Miller received death threats for interrupting sporting events. In 1996, he relocated to [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]], [[Alaska]] where he lived in a hut with no indoor plumbing. He continued to fly [[ultralight aircraft]] and paragliders in the Alaskan [[wilderness]] and also gave lessons. Miller briefly worked for a computer company before opening his own computer business.<ref name=\"observer\"/> In 2001, he was diagnosed with [[coronary artery disease]] and underwent [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|double bypass surgery]]. There were complications and Miller developed health issues. He underwent two additional surgeries to correct issues caused by the first surgery, but continued to experience constant chest pains and ill health. Miller was unable to continue flying, paragliding and hiking because of his declining health. Due to mounting debts from medical bills, Miller was forced to close his computer business. He moved to [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] in 2002, where he worked for a utility company.<ref name=\"joling\"/>\n\nOn September 22, 2002, Miller was reported missing after he disappeared earlier that morning while driving to the wilderness. His car was found near the Resurrection Pass Trail in [[Chugach National Forest]] on the [[Kenai Peninsula]]. A search was launched but was suspended on October 13.<ref name=\"joling\"/> On March 9, 2003, a group of hunters [[Trail blazing|bushwhacking]] through the woods on the peninsula found Miller's decomposing body.

He was the first person after their creator to appreciate the power of [[Feynman diagram]]s and his paper written in 1948 and published in 1949 was the first to make use of them. He said in that paper that Feynman diagrams were not just a computational tool but a physical theory and developed rules for the diagrams that completely solved the [[renormalization]] problem. Dyson's paper and also his lectures presented Feynman's theories of QED in a form that other physicists could understand, facilitating the physics community's acceptance of Feynman's work. [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], in particular, was persuaded by Dyson that Feynman's new theory was as valid as Schwinger's and Tomonaga's.  Also in 1949, in related work, Dyson invented the [[Dyson series]]. It was this paper that inspired [[John Clive Ward|John Ward]] to derive his celebrated [[Ward\u2013Takahashi identity]].<ref name=\"qeid-jw-1950\">{{Cite journal|author=J. C. Ward|journal=Phys.

He showed his formula to the mathematician [[Atle Selberg]], who said that it looked like something in [[mathematical physics]] and that Montgomery should show it to Dyson, which he did. Dyson recognized the formula as the [[pair correlation function]] of the [[Gaussian unitary ensemble]], which physicists have studied extensively. This suggested that there might be an unexpected connection between the [[distribution of primes]] (2, 3, 5, 7, 11,&nbsp;...) and the energy levels in the [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of [[heavy elements]] such as [[uranium]].<ref>[[John Derbyshire]], ''[[Prime Obsession]]'', 2004, {{ISBN|0309085497}}.</ref>\n\nAround 1979 Dyson worked with the [[Oak Ridge Associated Universities|Institute for Energy Analysis]] on [[Climatology|climate studies]].

He argued that such technologies would be based on [[solar power]] rather than the [[fossil fuel]]s whose use he saw as part of what he calls \"gray technologies\" of industry.

This was first propounded by the Russian [[Alexander Oparin]].<ref>Oparin, A. I. ''The Origin of Life'', Moscow Worker publisher, 1924 (Russian)</ref> [[J. B. S. Haldane]] developed the same theory independently.<ref>''The Origin of Life'', J.B.S. Haldane, The Rationalist Annual, 1929</ref> In Dyson's version of the theory life evolved in two stages, widely separated in time. Because of the biochemistry he regards it as too unlikely that genes could have developed fully blown in one process. Current cells contain [[adenosine triphosphate]] or ATP and [[adenosine 5'-monophosphate]] or AMP, which greatly resemble each other but have completely different functions. ATP transports energy around the cell, and AMP is part of RNA and the genetic apparatus. Dyson proposed that in a primitive early cell containing ATP and AMP, RNA and replication came into existence only because of the similarity between AMP and RNA. He suggested that AMP was produced when ATP molecules lost two of their phosphate radicals, and then one cell somewhere performed [[Manfred Eigen|Eigen]]'s experiment and produced RNA.{{sfn|Schewe|2014|pp=222\u2013223}}\n\nThere is no direct evidence for the dual origin theory, because once genes developed, they took over, obliterating all traces of the earlier forms of life. In the first origin, the cells were probably just drops of water held together by surface tension, teeming with enzymes and chemical reactions, and having a primitive kind of growth or replication. When the liquid drop became too big, it split into two drops. Many complex molecules formed in these \"little city economies\" and the probability that genes would eventually develop in them was much greater than in the prebiotic environment.<ref>Freeman Dyson, ''Origins of Life,,.

As a young man, he worked for [[General Atomics]] on the nuclear-powered [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Orion]] spacecraft. He hoped Project Orion would put men on Mars by 1965, Saturn by 1970.

He proposed that habitats could be grown from space hardened spores.

It is necessary to be afraid, but it is equally necessary to understand.

If we are to avoid destruction we must first of all understand the human and historical context out of which destruction arises.<ref>Dyson, F.J.

Dyson says that the report showed that, even from a narrow military point of view, the US was better off not using nuclear weapons.{{sfn|Schewe|2014|pp=169\u2013170}}\n\nDyson opposed the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Gulf War]] and the [[invasion of Iraq]]. He supported [[Barack Obama]] in the [[2008 US presidential election]] and ''[[The New York Times]]'' described him as a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|political liberal]].<ref name=civil /> He was one of 29 leading US scientists who wrote Obama a strongly supportive letter about his administration's 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.<ref name = \"29 support letter\">{{Cite web | last = Broad | first = William J. | date = 8 August 2015 | title = 29 U.S. Scientists Praise Iran Nuclear Deal in Letter to Obama | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/world/29-us-scientists-praise-iran-nuclear-deal-in-letter-to-obama.html | work = The New York Times | access-date = 9 August 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Science and religion===\nDyson was raised in what he described as a \"watered-down [[Church of England]] Christianity\".<ref name=\"civil\" /> He was a [[Nondenominational Christianity|nondenominational Christian]] and attended various churches, from [[Presbyterian]] to [[Roman Catholic]].

The two windows give different views, but they look out at the same universe. Both views are one-sided, neither is complete. Both leave out essential features of the real world. And both are worthy of respect.\n\nTrouble arises when either science or religion claims universal jurisdiction, when either religious or scientific dogma claims to be infallible. Religious creationists and scientific materialists are equally dogmatic and insensitive. By their arrogance they bring both science and religion into disrepute. The media exaggerate their numbers and importance. The media rarely mention the fact that the great majority of religious people belong to moderate denominations that treat science with respect, or the fact that the great majority of scientists treat religion with respect so long as religion does not claim jurisdiction over scientific questions.<ref name=\"edge68.html\" />}}\n\nDyson partially disagreed with the famous remark by his fellow physicist [[Steven Weinberg]] that \"With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil \u2013 that takes religion.\"<ref name=\"nyrb06.html\">{{cite journal |title=Religion from the Outside |author=Freeman Dyson |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19090 |date=22 June 2006 |journal=The New York Review of Books |access-date=7 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote | style=font-size:100% | Weinberg's statement is true as far as it goes, but it is not the whole truth. To make it the whole truth, we must add an additional clause: \"And for bad people to do good things \u2013 that [also] takes religion.\" The main point of Christianity is that it is a religion for sinners. Jesus made that very clear. When the Pharisees asked his disciples, \"Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?\" he said, \"I come to call not the righteous but sinners to repentance.\" Only a small fraction of sinners repent and do good things but only a small fraction of good people are led by their religion to do bad things.<ref name=\"nyrb06.html\" />}}\n\nWhile Dyson called himself a Christian, he identified himself as agnostic about some of the specifics of his faith.<ref>{{cite book |title=Back to Hell |publisher=Xulon Press |isbn=9781591608158 |author=Moses Gbenu |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R8aLHpyW7vEC&pg=PA110#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=110 |quote=The cash part of this award is over $1 million.

But I find Polkinghorne's theology altogether too narrow for my taste. I have no use for a theology that claims to know the answers to deep questions but bases its arguments on the beliefs of a single tribe. I am a practicing Christian but not a believing Christian.

He was skeptical about the [[Scientific modelling|simulation models]] used to predict [[climate change]], arguing that political efforts to reduce causes of climate change distract from other global problems that should take priority.

His friend the neurologist and author [[Oliver Sacks]] said: \"A favourite word of Freeman's about doing science and being creative is the word 'subversive'.

The budding English physicist recognized the brilliance of the flamboyant American and worked with him. He then moved to the Institute for Advanced Study (1948\u20131949), before returning to England (1949\u201351), where he was a research fellow at the [[University of Birmingham]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Freeman Dyson |url=http://www.aip.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?dysonf |publisher=The American Institute of Physics |access-date=23 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017131442/http://www.aip.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?dysonf |archivedate=17 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1949, Dyson demonstrated the equivalence of two formulations of [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED): [[Richard Feynman]]'s diagrams and the operator method developed by [[Julian Schwinger]] and [[Shin'ichir\u014d Tomonaga]]. He was the first person after their creator to appreciate the power of [[Feynman diagram]]s and his paper written in 1948 and published in 1949 was the first to make use of them. He said in that paper that Feynman diagrams were not just a computational tool but a physical theory and developed rules for the diagrams that completely solved the [[renormalization]] problem. Dyson's paper and also his lectures presented Feynman's theories of QED in a form that other physicists could understand, facilitating the physics community's acceptance of Feynman's work. [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], in particular, was persuaded by Dyson that Feynman's new theory was as valid as Schwinger's and Tomonaga's.  Also in 1949, in related work, Dyson invented the [[Dyson series]]. It was this paper that inspired [[John Clive Ward|John Ward]] to derive his celebrated [[Ward\u2013Takahashi identity]].<ref name=\"qeid-jw-1950\">{{Cite journal|author=J. C. Ward|journal=Phys.

Lieb, ''Selected papers by Freeman Dyson'', AMS (1996).</ref>\n\nDyson also did work in a variety of topics in mathematics, such as topology, analysis, number theory and [[Random matrix|random matrices]].<ref name=\"SelectedPapers\" /> In 1973 the number theorist [[Hugh Lowell Montgomery]] was visiting the Institute for Advanced Study and had just made his [[Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture|pair correlation conjecture]] concerning the distribution of the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]]. He showed his formula to the mathematician [[Atle Selberg]], who said that it looked like something in [[mathematical physics]] and that Montgomery should show it to Dyson, which he did. Dyson recognized the formula as the [[pair correlation function]] of the [[Gaussian unitary ensemble]], which physicists have studied extensively. This suggested that there might be an unexpected connection between the [[distribution of primes]] (2, 3, 5, 7, 11,&nbsp;...) and the energy levels in the [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of [[heavy elements]] such as [[uranium]].<ref>[[John Derbyshire]], ''[[Prime Obsession]]'', 2004, {{ISBN|0309085497}}.</ref>\n\nAround 1979 Dyson worked with the [[Oak Ridge Associated Universities|Institute for Energy Analysis]] on [[Climatology|climate studies]].

Nobel physics laureate [[Steven Weinberg]] said that the [[Nobel Committee for Physics|Nobel committee]] \"fleeced\" Dyson, but Dyson remarked in 2009, \"I think it's almost true without exception if you want to win a Nobel Prize, you should have a long attention span, get hold of some deep and important problem and stay with it for ten years.

He argued that such technologies would be based on [[solar power]] rather than the [[fossil fuel]]s whose use he saw as part of what he calls \"gray technologies\" of industry.

This was first propounded by the Russian [[Alexander Oparin]].<ref>Oparin, A. I. ''The Origin of Life'', Moscow Worker publisher, 1924 (Russian)</ref> [[J. B. S. Haldane]] developed the same theory independently.<ref>''The Origin of Life'', J.B.S. Haldane, The Rationalist Annual, 1929</ref> In Dyson's version of the theory life evolved in two stages, widely separated in time. Because of the biochemistry he regards it as too unlikely that genes could have developed fully blown in one process. Current cells contain [[adenosine triphosphate]] or ATP and [[adenosine 5'-monophosphate]] or AMP, which greatly resemble each other but have completely different functions. ATP transports energy around the cell, and AMP is part of RNA and the genetic apparatus. Dyson proposed that in a primitive early cell containing ATP and AMP, RNA and replication came into existence only because of the similarity between AMP and RNA. He suggested that AMP was produced when ATP molecules lost two of their phosphate radicals, and then one cell somewhere performed [[Manfred Eigen|Eigen]]'s experiment and produced RNA.{{sfn|Schewe|2014|pp=222\u2013223}}\n\nThere is no direct evidence for the dual origin theory, because once genes developed, they took over, obliterating all traces of the earlier forms of life. In the first origin, the cells were probably just drops of water held together by surface tension, teeming with enzymes and chemical reactions, and having a primitive kind of growth or replication. When the liquid drop became too big, it split into two drops. Many complex molecules formed in these \"little city economies\" and the probability that genes would eventually develop in them was much greater than in the prebiotic environment.<ref>Freeman Dyson, ''Origins of Life,,.

He proposed that habitats could be grown from space hardened spores.

Dyson says that the report showed that, even from a narrow military point of view, the US was better off not using nuclear weapons.{{sfn|Schewe|2014|pp=169\u2013170}}\n\nDyson opposed the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Gulf War]] and the [[invasion of Iraq]].

The two windows give different views, but they look out at the same universe. Both views are one-sided, neither is complete. Both leave out essential features of the real world. And both are worthy of respect.\n\nTrouble arises when either science or religion claims universal jurisdiction, when either religious or scientific dogma claims to be infallible. Religious creationists and scientific materialists are equally dogmatic and insensitive. By their arrogance they bring both science and religion into disrepute. The media exaggerate their numbers and importance. The media rarely mention the fact that the great majority of religious people belong to moderate denominations that treat science with respect, or the fact that the great majority of scientists treat religion with respect so long as religion does not claim jurisdiction over scientific questions.<ref name=\"edge68.html\" />}}\n\nDyson partially disagreed with the famous remark by his fellow physicist [[Steven Weinberg]] that \"With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil \u2013 that takes religion.\"<ref name=\"nyrb06.html\">{{cite journal |title=Religion from the Outside |author=Freeman Dyson |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19090 |date=22 June 2006 |journal=The New York Review of Books |access-date=7 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote | style=font-size:100% | Weinberg's statement is true as far as it goes, but it is not the whole truth. To make it the whole truth, we must add an additional clause: \"And for bad people to do good things \u2013 that [also] takes religion.\" The main point of Christianity is that it is a religion for sinners. Jesus made that very clear. When the Pharisees asked his disciples, \"Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?\" he said, \"I come to call not the righteous but sinners to repentance.\" Only a small fraction of sinners repent and do good things but only a small fraction of good people are led by their religion to do bad things.<ref name=\"nyrb06.html\" />}}\n\nWhile Dyson called himself a Christian, he identified himself as agnostic about some of the specifics of his faith.<ref>{{cite book |title=Back to Hell |publisher=Xulon Press |isbn=9781591608158 |author=Moses Gbenu |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R8aLHpyW7vEC&pg=PA110#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=110 |quote=The cash part of this award is over $1 million.

But I find Polkinghorne's theology altogether too narrow for my taste. I have no use for a theology that claims to know the answers to deep questions but bases its arguments on the beliefs of a single tribe. I am a practicing Christian but not a believing Christian.

There was a lot to take in. All that we witnessed on this journey shows us that our world's climate is incredibly interconnected and that it is at urgent breaking point.{{nbsp}}... We wanted to create a film that gave people a sense of urgency, that made them understand what particular things are going to solve this problem. We bring up the issue of a carbon tax, for example, which I haven't seen in a lot of documentaries. Basically, sway a capitalist economy to try to invest in renewables, to bring less money and subsidies out of oil companies. These are the things that are really going to make a massive difference.{{nbsp}}... We need to use our vote{{nbsp}}... We cannot afford to have political leaders out there that do not believe in modern science or the scientific method or empirical truths{{nbsp}}... We cannot afford to waste time having people in power that choose to believe in the 2{{nbsp}}percent of the scientific community that is basically bought off by lobbyists and oil companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecowatch.com/leonardo-dicaprio-before-the-flood-2057070140.html|title=7 Key Scenes in Leonardo DiCaprio's Climate Film 'Before the Flood'}}</ref>}}\n\n==Content==\n[[File:The Garden of Earthly Delights by Bosch High Resolution.jpg|thumb|[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.beforetheflood.com/explore/the-painting/|title=Before the Flood - Painting|website=Before the Flood}}</ref>]]\n\nThe film shows DiCaprio visiting various regions of the globe<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-capsule-before-the-flood-review-20161017-snap-story.html|title=Leonardo DiCaprio crosses the globe in the climate change documentary 'Before the Flood'|last=Times|first=Los Angeles|website=latimes.com|access-date=2016-11-01}}</ref> exploring the impact of [[global warming]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wired.it/attualita/ambiente/2016/10/30/before-the-flood-dicaprio/|title=Guarda Before the Flood, il documentario di DiCaprio contro il cambiamento climatico - Wired|date=2016-10-30|newspaper=Wired|language=it-IT|access-date=2016-11-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031142830/http://www.wired.it/attualita/ambiente/2016/10/30/before-the-flood-dicaprio/|archive-date=2016-10-31|url-status=dead}}</ref> As a narrator, DiCaprio comments these encounters as well as archive footages.

OU president Boren suspected that the chant was learned on the fraternity's leadership cruise but the SAE national headquarters issued a statement that the chant is not one of their sanctioned songs and they would never allow such chant to be sung, stating that any member or chapter who adopts hostile chants are dealt with severe punishment. However, both the national headquarters and Boren state that the chant was informally shared during the leadership cruise by other members.\n\n===Reactions===\nThe SAE-OU chapter's only two African-American alumni, Jonathan Davis and William Bruce James II, defended the house mother, Beauton Gilbow, over her actions and voiced out their support for the chapter's closure.

OU president Boren suspected that the chant was learned on the fraternity's leadership cruise but the SAE national headquarters issued a statement that the chant is not one of their sanctioned songs and they would never allow such chant to be sung, stating that any member or chapter who adopts hostile chants are dealt with severe punishment. However, both the national headquarters and Boren state that the chant was informally shared during the leadership cruise by other members.\n\n===Reactions===\nThe SAE-OU chapter's only two African-American alumni, Jonathan Davis and William Bruce James II, defended the house mother, Beauton Gilbow, over her actions and voiced out their support for the chapter's closure.

Unlike the Parker Rice in the racist chant who was a Dallas native, the other Parker Rice, was a native of Oklahoma and was an Asian Studies student majoring in Japanese. He admits his membership at the Oklahoma State University chapter of [[Alpha Phi Omega]] while condemning the racist chant incident. The Oklahoma-native Rice later posted on social media that he has no connection to SAE and that he was not the Parker Rice in the video.\n\nIn response to the video the [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma Sooners]] college football team held arm-in-arm protest vigils instead of attending practice.<ref>{{cite web | website=espn.go.com |publisher=ESPN | url=http://espn.go.com/blog/big12/post/_/id/97130/sae-video-scandal-could-galvanize-oklahoma-sooners | title=SAE video scandal could galvanize Sooners |first=Jake |last=Trotter | date=March 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\nSeveral news media reports highlighted the fact that SAE, which was founded before the [[American Civil War]] in the South had a history of [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon#Discriminatory incidents|discriminatory incidents]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/inside_higher_ed/2015/03/behind_the_chant_discrimination_at_oklahoma_s_sae_chapter_goes_deeper_than.html |first=Jake |last=New | title=The Ugly, Racist, Deadly History of Sigma Alpha Epsilon | newspaper=Slate | date=March 13, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2015/0314/University-of-Oklahoma-fraternity-has-history-of-racist-incidents-elsewhere-video | title=University of Oklahoma fraternity has history of racist incidents elsewhere  | newspaper=Christian Science Monitor |first=Brad |last=Knickerbocker | date=March 14, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/03/11/us/ap-us-sae-profile.html | title=Fraternity in Racist Video Has Roots in Antebellum South | date=March 11, 2015 | newspaper=The New York Times |author=The Associated Press |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403134300/https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/03/11/us/ap-us-sae-profile.html |archivedate=March 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nRobby Soave of the [[Reason Foundation]] wrote that the OU had failed to expel a freshman football player \"caught on tape punching a female student in the face\" in 2014.
