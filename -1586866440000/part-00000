Vishwaveer discovers that an abandoned baby girl is able to protect Gauri from a familial curse, and he adopts her, naming her Kaali and making her Gauri's \"kaala teeka\".\n\n'''After 5 years'''\n\nKaali ([[Sargam Khurana]]) continues protecting Gauri ([[Adaa Narang]]) in every way. Gauri, being Vishwaveer's only child, is brought up surrounded with comforts, while Vishwaveer doesn't treat Kaali very well. She is mistreated by Vishwaveer's sister-in-law Kalyani Jha ([[Mona Ambegaonkar]]). Vishwaveer's first wife, Manjiri Jha ([[Dalljiet Kaur]]), who doesn't have children, adores Kaali and brings her up as her own daughter.\n\nKalyani plots to kill Gauri to get revenge from Vishwaveer for an old matter. She kills Kaali first, so that she is unable to protect Gauri. However, Kaali survives, and relates the incident to Manjiri, who decides to make Kalyani pay.\n\nKaali and Manjiri confront Kalyani in a temple, where Kalyani ends up killing Manjiri by strangling her, and making it look like Kaali did it. When the family finds out, Vishwaveer decides to take the blame on himself and go to jail in Kaali's place, so that Kaali can stay with Gauri and continue to protect her. As a result, Vishwaveer goes to jail for 14 years.\n\n'''After 14 years'''\n\nKaali ([[Simran Pareenja]]) and Gauri ([[Fenil Umrigar]]) are grown up. Kaali is very intelligent and a good singer, but all credits are taken by Gauri. Kaali writes exams for her and sings for her. A guy named Yug Choudhary ([[Rohan Gandotra]]) hears Kaali's voice and is taken aback by her voice. He tries to search for her but is unable to find her. Everyone thinks that it is Gauri who sings and Yug also thinks the same, but he is not able to find Gauri. Vishwaveer, while searching for a suitable groom for Gauri, comes across Yug and resolves to get her married to him. Gauri initially refuses but Kaali convinces her, and Gauri eventually falls in love with Yug and agrees for marriage after testing him a couple of times. When Yug's grandmother rejects the proposal considering Vishwa to be a criminal, he brainwashes Gauri's brother Neelkanth \"Neel\" Jha ([[Nivin Ramani]]) into trying to rape Yug's sister Sharmila Choudhary ([[Meenu Panchal]]). Neel attempts to do so, but is held back by his conscience at the last minute. In order to save Sharmila's reputation, Yug's grandmother agrees to get Yug married to Gauri in exchange for Neel marrying Sharmila. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Manjiri is still alive and that she lost her memory 14 years ago and saved Yug's life, after which his father took her in as his sister. She is now living with Yug.\n\nAfter a while Kaali finds out that Manjiri is still alive and with the help of Yug, Kaali brings her memory back. Yug-Gauri and Neel-Sharmila are now scheduled to get married. Instead destiny wants to bring Yug and Kaali together who have fallen in love. Yug is actually Kaali's childhood Ramji.\n\nThe show goes on with Manjiri and Yug supporting Kali in each and every step to get back love of Vishwaveer and prove him superstitions are waste. Gauri's kundli's truth comes out and Kaali is forced to agree to be Gauri's Kaala Teeka again and goes to Yug's house. She gets anxious and encounters Vishwa and decides to leave. Manjiri and Kali get kidnapped by Kalyani, but Yug saves them. Kalyani is arrested and Manjiri goes back to Vishwa and demands Kali and Yug's alliance. Gauri drinks poison but she is saved and Vishwa realises that it was not Kali being kaala teeka that worked for Gauri but her prayers were the ones which truly worked. He fixes Yug and Kali's alliance to which Yug's mother Leelavita \"Leela\" Choudhary agrees only because of a hidden motto and she doesn't want Kali to be her daughter-in-law. Therefore, Leela and Gauri team up. Yug marries Kali but everyone get tricked as they assume it is Gauri who is marrying Yug. Yug doesn't trust Kali anymore and goes with Gauri. Yug starts to hate Kali.\n\nTime passes by and Yug finally finds out the truth behind Gauri and gets married to Kali once again. Gauri then plans to make Kali seem dead by injecting some type of medicine on her but that plan fails when her injection breaks. Instead, she puts the poison in the safety pin and hooks it on Kali's doli. Kali is pricked by the safety pin. While performing rituals and praying in the temple at Yug's house, Kali faints. They call the doctor but the doctor tells everyone that Kali is dead. Just then, Yug realizes that it could have been Gauri and goes to her hotel to drag her there. She fakes and does some drama of crying and says she will bring Kali back to life by burning kapur on her hand. She has already put chemical on her hand to make sure her palm doesn't burn. The poison wears off and Kali regains conscientious, leaving everyone believing Gauri. However Yug does not believe Gauri and sends her out of the house. Gauri vows for revenge. She comes back as a servant and starts to make Leela believe that an evil spirit is haunting her. She brings a fake astrologer and he tells that Yug should be 21 kilometers away from the house. Leela and Yug believe it and Yug leaves. Later with the help of the astrologer, Gauri makes it look like Kali has the evil spirit inside her and Leela decides to sacrifice Kali. Manjiri comes to Yug's house and discovers that there is a pooja going on and asks for Kali, who is locked in a room. Manjiri gets suspicious and follows the car leading to the ashram. She brings a real astrologer and the truth behind Gauri gets revealed to everyone. Kali, enraged, slaps Gauri for her deeds and Gauri later reveals to everyone that Leela did not want Kali to be her daughter in law and encouraged Gauri that Yug would be married to her. Yug gets distraught and leaves while Gauri and the fake astrologer get arrested. Gauri vows to destroy his whole family. After three months however, Gauri who is released from jail returns and reveals to everyone that she is pregnant with Yug's child. Because of this Yug allows her to stay until the child is born. Later, it is revealed that Kaali is also pregnant. This matter however, is only known by Gauri and Vishwa as they bribed the nurse to get her reports before she does. In order to make sure that Kaali and Yug stay apart Gauri plans to have Kali thrown out of the house which is eventually carried out by Yug himself, as he does so Vishwa then takes Kaali to the top of a cliff and reveals her pregnancy to her just as he is about to push her off. Vishwa pushes Kali off of the cliff but Kali hangs onto a branch. Vishwa throws rock at her and she falls. Afterwards, Kali's suicide note comes and everyone believes Kali to be dead. Leela asks Yug to marry Gauri and give the child a legitimate name. Yug agrees to marry Gauri. Meanwhile, Kali doesn't die and is saved by a mentally challenged man named Nandu Singh ([[Mayank Gandhi]]). Kali asks Nandu to take her to Choudhary House. Nandu takes her there but returns. There back in his village, some kids tease him as Kali's husband. Nandu becomes shy and later, Nandu marries Kali and then takes her to the hospital where he gets to know that Kali is in coma.\n\n'''7 months later'''\n\nYug is now turned as a puppet for Vishwaveer. Vishwaveer is the new landlord of Choudhary House. Nandu is seen taking care of Kali in the hospital. The nurses discuss that Kali has lost her child. Gauri and Yug travel to Veerpur. On there way Gauri gets labour pain and Yug takes her to the same hospital where Kali is admitted. Vishwaveer finds out that Kali is in the hospital. Meanwhile, Gauri delivers a baby girl and names it Naina. Naina gets kidnapped by Vishwa, after being told that baby is threat to his life and Kali finds out about Yug and Gauri and decides to commit suicide on the same river where Vishwa places Naina in a basket and floating away. Kali feels the basket and finds Naina in it and decides to live. She begins to raise Naina. Unknown to Kali is that Naina is Yug and Gauri's daughter, who are distraught after their baby went missing, and names it Naina. It is revealed that Vishwa attempted to kill Naina because of a superstition that says Naina is a threat to him. Manjiri later finds Kali at a temple and Kali reveals that she was once pregnant with Yug's child and Vishwa threw her off the cliff for the sake of Gauri. Manjiri vows revenge on Vishwa and brings Kali to Yug's house. Gauri does not like this and tries to kill her own daughter Naina. However it backfires. Meanwhile, Nandu finds out that Vishwa attempted to kill Kali and vows not to spare him. Fearing that the truth would come out, Vishwa gets rid of all the evidence he could find. He also find out that Kali's adopted daughter is actually Gauri and Yug's daughter Naina. Vishwa attempts to kill Kali and Naina but fails because of Nandu. Manjiri later finds out about this and scolds Vishwa and reveals her revenge against him. Kali and Naina disappeared once again and Manjiri threatens to kill Vishwa if he does not reveal where Kali and Naina are. It is later revealed that Kali had planned this to get the truth from Vishwa. Later, while Vishwa, along with his partner Raj Purohit ([[Rajesh Puri]]) conduct a Pooja, assuming that Kali is dead, Kali pretends to be a spirit to get Vishwa to say the truth. With the help of Nandu and Manjiri, Kali gets the truth out. Yug gets distraught by hearing this and a chandelier falls on Kali. While she is hospitalized Manjiri reveals the truth behind Vishwa and Gauri. Yug later gets Raj and Vishwa arrested but they escape. Naina gets kidnapped again but Kali and Manjiri finds her. Vishwa finds Kali and Manjiri and threatens to kill Kali and Naina. Before he could, Manjiri grabs a trishul and stabs Vishwa, killing him. After Vishwa's funeral, Yug asks Kali for forgiveness but Kali rejects saying that she is not a doll to play with. Nandu offers Kali to stay at his place but Yug threatens to kill Naina if Kali leaves. Kali stays but scolds Yug for being selfish and will only stay for Naina's sake. Leela declares Kali as Naina's official mother as Gauri is too dangerous for the number of sins she committed. At this time, a tantrik named Devri Singh ([[Vineet Raina]]) is introduced and reveals to be Nandu's brother. Kali and Manjiri get suspicious about Devri and ask a priest at an ashram and Raj Purohit, as he has no other option. Manjiri and Kali discover that Devri was Vishwa's Kaala Teeka. They also discovers Devri's true intentions to kill the baby Naina to gain evil powers. It is also revealed in Nandu's kundli that Nandu is Naina's Kaala Teeka. Discovering that Devri is a threat, Yug bans Devri from coming into the house while Devri plot to kill Naina is underway. Devri also decides to kill Kali because she is an obstacle that he has to overcome to kill Naina. But Manjiri and Nandu save them and Nandu and Kali get married for Naina's protection. This infuriates Yug and he decides to kill Nandu but is stopped by Gauri. Devri decides to kill his own brother Nandu in order to get Naina but Devri mistakenly stabs himself. Devri is rushed to the hospital. Yug later snatched Naina from Kali saying that she is no longer her mother. Yug meets with an accident and Naina and Yug are hospitalized. Devri donates blood to Naina but Kali would forgive him if he goes to jail. But Devri escaped and forms another plan to kill Naina. Jamuna soon finds out about this and warns Kali. Kali decides to kill Devri. Raj Purohit later finds out that only Kali and Nandu can kill Devri. Nandu does not want to kill his brother Devri. Kali decides to kill Devri with the help of Yug and she was successful. But Devri is still alive and attempted to drown Kali but is saved by Nandu who kills his own brother Devri.\n\n'''After 8 months'''\n\nKali is now pregnant with Nandu's child and Naina is shown to be 8 months old and causing trouble for Kali, Yug and Gauri. Naina runs to a forest and Kali finds her there. while she was there, she gives birth to Nandu's child and names her Pavitra. A nearby tantrik reveals that Pavitra would not be able to live for no longer than seven years.\n\n'''5 years later'''\n\nNandu had died when he killed Devri. Yug decides to adopt Pavitra. Gauri gets jealous to Kaali because she think that Kaali was take her life. Gauri becomes angry after knowing that Kaali and Yug get closer again. She then burned the house. Everybody is dead but Kaali is trapped in her room. Naina and Pavitra was saved and they ran away from the house. Gauri chases them and wants to kill Pavitra. But fuel tank of her car was leaked and her car was exploded, Gauri dead. In the next day, Chulbuli comes home and is shocked to see the house was burned. Naina and Pavitra go back home and meet Chulbuli. They feel sad when everybody found dead. But Kaali still trapped in her room. They search Kaali and the found her, they take Kaali to hospital. Suddenly, Kaali wake up and hug Naina and Pavitra. Raj Purohit come to hospital and ask forgiveness to Kaali. Raj Purohit confess that myth about kaala teeka of Gauri is just a hoax. He made up the story about kaala teeka because he was treated by Vishwaveer. Kaali forgives him and make him promise to not tell about superstition anymore. Kaali want Chulbuli to take care of her daughter. Kaali closed her eyes and dies. A few days later, Jamuna come home and wants to take Pavitra to stay with her. Naina, Chulbuli and Pavitra herself didn't let her to take Pavitra. Chulbuli says to Raj Purohit to bring Naina and Pavitra to Neel and Sharmila in the city to avoid Jamuna. But before that happen, Jamuna comes and takes Pavitra away. Moving to Bhimpur, the bus in which they were traveling meets with an accident and Jamuna dies. Pavitra faints, falls into the river, and she floats away to another village. Maai finds her and says that she will take care of her.\n\n'''14 years later'''\n\nNaina ([[Sukirti Kandpal]]), Gauri and Yug's daughter, lives in [[Mumbai]] while Pavitra (also [[Simran Pareenja]]), Kaali and Nandu's daughter, lives in Bhimpur village. Pavitra just looks like her mother Kaali. Naina goes to college and on every holiday she goes to several villages in search of Pavitra. This time she went to Bhimpur. In Bhimpur, she stays at a girl's house called Barki, which she helped during a bus accident. Naina doesn't know that the girl in whose house she is staying is Pavitra's house. In Bhimpur, there is a ride called \"Ganga Darpan\" in which innocent girls are decked up as brides and are send to the other village, in order to do prostitution. But the villagers are not aware of this. They think that the girls are being send to an Ashram for being Sanyasi's all their lives. This all is a big sex scandal. In all of this, Thakur Dev Sinha ([[Parag Tyagi]]), the Thakur of the village and the Mahant was involved. However, Naina tried to exposed Thakur Dev and the Mahant in front of the villagers, but nobody listened to her and she was sent back to Mumbai. But Naina didn't gave up and went back to Bhimpur, this time with Chulbuli and Dimpy. There Naina meet Krishna Sinha ([[Karan Sharma (TV actor)|Karan Sharma]]), the son of Thakur Dev Sinha. There was a glimpse of love at first sight. With the help of Krishna and Barki, Naina created a plan to expose the Thakur. The 45th time Barki was chosen for the \"Ganga Darpan\" and Naina wanted to stop this and she succeeds, but Thakur Dev Sinha accused Mahant and he was sent to jail instead of both of them. Then all the girls returned to their parents. However, Thakur Dev tried to kill Naina and Krishna, but couldn't succeed. One day Mai (also Barki's mother) wanted to remove all the proof of Pavitra's existence, but could't do it because Barki got to know that she is Pavitra. Naina saves Barki and they got back to the village. Thakur Dev didn't stop his cunning and slimy tricks. He harms Naina and marries her, cheating Krishna who was about to marry Naina, in order to rape Naina, because she exposed him. Naina losts her memory. Pavitra marries Krishna to enter Thakur Dev's mansion in order to save Naina. Thakur Dev kidnaps Dimpy, Chulbuli and Chutki. When the others got to know that the three were kidnapped, they started to haunt and taunt thakur so that he tells that where Chulbuli, Chutki and Dimpy are. When Thakur Dev was fed up and had enough, he tried to kill Krishna, Naina, Pavitra and Mai. But they didn't died. They returned in Thakur Dev's life to make him pay for his sins, but they didn't succeed in their plans. Thakur Dev now tried to create a rift between Naina and Pavitra, but Pavitra promised that she will make everything right, how it was before. Chulbuli, Dimpy and Chutki managed to escape from the goons den and went to the mansion. Meanwhile, Naina regains her memory. She accuses and abuses Pavitra for marrying Krishna. Now she wants to avenge Pavitra by taking her back to Mumbai, but Thakur didn't want to let go off Naina, because his revenge isn't complete yet. He want to have sex with Naina. He said that Naina and Pavitra only can leave this village if they unmarry back (Krishna with Pavitra and Naina with Thakur Dev). But the opposite happens. Pavitra goes in the room of Thakur Dev to save Naina, but then Krishna arrives in the room of Thakur Dev. After that Thakur Dev beats Krishna up, for stopping him. Meanwhile, the Mahant arrives with the villagers and The Thakurayan to expose Thakur Dev in front of the villagers. Thakurayan succeeds in her plans and the Thakur gets arrested. Now Naina is all set to go to Mumbai, but Pavitra is sad. Pavitra gets married to Krishna in full tradition. Krishna is now the Thakur of the village and Pavitra, the thakurayan. On their home way to Mumbai, Naina's car meets with an accident, because Purohitji told them that if Pavitra and Naina doesn't live together, they won't remain happy in life, because of their half-swastik tattoo on their arms. Naina regains consciousness, and they both go home. From that day, they swore that they will never ever support and believe in superstition, and if they ever see an activity of superstition, they will take action. The story ends with Pavitra and Naina doing an aatma/shanti pooja for Kaali, promising that they will love and help each other and other people in life.\n\n== Cast ==\n===Main===\n====Before leap====\n* [[Simran Pareenja]] as Kaali Jha, Vishwa and Manjiri's adopted daughter, Yug's ex wife, Nandu's wife, Pavitra's mother, Gauri and Neel's half-sister (2016-17)\n* [[Fenil Umrigar]] as Gauri Jha, Vishwa and Madhuri's daughter, Yug's second wife, Kaali's adoptive half-sister, Naina's mother (2016-17)\n* [[Rohan Gandotra]] as Yug Chaudhary, Kaali's ex-husband, Gauri's husband, Naina's father (2016-17) \n* [[Mayank Gandhi]] as Nandu Singh, Kaali's second husband, Pavitra's father (2016-17)\n* [[Bhupinder Singh (actor)|Bhupinder Singh]] as Acharya Jha, Gauri and Neel's father, Kaali's adoptive father, Manjiri and Madhuri's husband (2015-16)\n\n====After leap====   \n* [[Sukirti Kandpal]] as Naina Chaudhary, Gauri and Yug's daughter, Dev's ex-fianc\u00e9e (2017) \n* [[Simran Pareenja]] as Thakurain Pavitra, Kaali and Nandu's daughter, Krishna's wife (2017)\n* [[Karan Sharma (TV actor)|Karan Sharma]] as Thakur Krishna Sinha, Dev's son, Naina's love interest, Pavitra's husband (2017)\n* [[Parag Tyagi]] as Thakur Dev Sinha, Krishna's father, Naina's ex-fianc\u00e9 (2017)\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Pratima Kazmi]] as Maai, Pavitra's caretaker (2017) \n* [[Ashita Dhawan]] as Chulbuli (2017) \n* [[Dalljiet Kaur|Daljeet Kaur Bhanot]] as Manjiri Jha, Vishwa's first wife, Kaali's adoptive mother, Gauri and Neel's step-mother (2015-16; 2016-17)\n* [[Rajesh Puri]] as Raj Purohit (2016-17)\n* Hifsa Sharma as Dimpy (2017)\n* [[Nivin Ramani]] as Neelkanth Jha, Vishwa-Madhuri's son, Gauri's brother, Kaali's adoptive half-brother, Sharmila's husband (2016-17)\n* Meenu Panchal as Sharmila Chaudhary, Yug's sister, Neel's wife (2016-17)\n* [[Vineet Raina]] as Devri Singh, Nandu's brother (2016-17) \n* Geeta Agarwal as Leelavati Chaudhary, Yug and Sharmila's mother (2016-17) \n* [[Mita Vashisht]] as Jethi Maa (2016)\n* Akshara Singh as Madhuri Jha, Vishwa's second wife, Gauri and Neel's mother, Kaali's adoptive step-mother (2015-17)\n* [[Mona Ambegaonkar]] as Kalyani Jha, Vishwa's sister-in-law, Gauri and Neel's aunt, Kaali's adoptive aunt (2015-17) \n* Shriyansh Tiwari as Heera (2015) \n* [[Varun Sharma]] as Shambhu (2015) \n* Surya Sharma as Aryan (2016)\n* Praveen Hingonia as Bablu (2015-16)\n* Pratichee Mishra as Jamuna (2016-17)\n* Adaa Narang as Young Gauri (2015-16)<ref name=\"fc\">{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/Kaala-Teeka-Know-all-about-the-show/updates/49672251.cms|title=Kaala Teeka|work=The Times of India|accessdate=9 April 2016}}</ref>\n* Sargam Khurana as young Kaali (2015-16)<ref name=\"fc\" />\n* [[Sara Khan (TV actress)|Sara Khan]] as Dancer in temple, special appearance in crossover episode with [[Sarojini - Ek Nayi Pehal|Sarojini]] (2016)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.zee5.com/tvshows/details/kaala-teeka/0-6-126 Official website]\n\n{{Zee TV Programmes}}\n\n[[Category:Zee TV television series]]\n[[Category:Indian drama television series]]\n[[Category:2015 Indian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2017 Indian television series endings]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Indian English|date=September 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2017}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Kaala Teeka\n| image                    = \n| caption                  = \n| show_name_2              = ''Kaala Teeka \u2013 Umeed Ka Naya Daur''\n| genre                    = [[Drama]] <br /> [[Romance (love)|Romance]]\n| creator                  = [[Bhavna Vyas]]\n| writer                   = [[Bhavna Vyas]], [[S.

Vishwaveer discovers that an abandoned baby girl is able to protect Gauri from a familial curse, and he adopts her, naming her Kaali and making her Gauri's \"kaala teeka\".\n\n'''After 5 years'''\n\nKaali ([[Sargam Khurana]]) continues protecting Gauri ([[Adaa Narang]]) in every way. Gauri, being Vishwaveer's only child, is brought up surrounded with comforts, while Vishwaveer doesn't treat Kaali very well. She is mistreated by Vishwaveer's sister-in-law Kalyani Jha ([[Mona Ambegaonkar]]). Vishwaveer's first wife, Manjiri Jha ([[Dalljiet Kaur]]), who doesn't have children, adores Kaali and brings her up as her own daughter.\n\nKalyani plots to kill Gauri to get revenge from Vishwaveer for an old matter. She kills Kaali first, so that she is unable to protect Gauri. However, Kaali survives, and relates the incident to Manjiri, who decides to make Kalyani pay.\n\nKaali and Manjiri confront Kalyani in a temple, where Kalyani ends up killing Manjiri by strangling her, and making it look like Kaali did it. When the family finds out, Vishwaveer decides to take the blame on himself and go to jail in Kaali's place, so that Kaali can stay with Gauri and continue to protect her. As a result, Vishwaveer goes to jail for 14 years.\n\n'''After 14 years'''\n\nKaali ([[Simran Pareenja]]) and Gauri ([[Fenil Umrigar]]) are grown up. Kaali is very intelligent and a good singer, but all credits are taken by Gauri. Kaali writes exams for her and sings for her. A guy named Yug Choudhary ([[Rohan Gandotra]]) hears Kaali's voice and is taken aback by her voice. He tries to search for her but is unable to find her. Everyone thinks that it is Gauri who sings and Yug also thinks the same, but he is not able to find Gauri. Vishwaveer, while searching for a suitable groom for Gauri, comes across Yug and resolves to get her married to him. Gauri initially refuses but Kaali convinces her, and Gauri eventually falls in love with Yug and agrees for marriage after testing him a couple of times. When Yug's grandmother rejects the proposal considering Vishwa to be a criminal, he brainwashes Gauri's brother Neelkanth \"Neel\" Jha ([[Nivin Ramani]]) into trying to rape Yug's sister Sharmila Choudhary ([[Meenu Panchal]]). Neel attempts to do so, but is held back by his conscience at the last minute. In order to save Sharmila's reputation, Yug's grandmother agrees to get Yug married to Gauri in exchange for Neel marrying Sharmila. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Manjiri is still alive and that she lost her memory 14 years ago and saved Yug's life, after which his father took her in as his sister. She is now living with Yug.\n\nAfter a while Kaali finds out that Manjiri is still alive and with the help of Yug, Kaali brings her memory back. Yug-Gauri and Neel-Sharmila are now scheduled to get married. Instead destiny wants to bring Yug and Kaali together who have fallen in love. Yug is actually Kaali's childhood Ramji.\n\nThe show goes on with Manjiri and Yug supporting Kali in each and every step to get back love of Vishwaveer and prove him superstitions are waste. Gauri's kundli's truth comes out and Kaali is forced to agree to be Gauri's Kaala Teeka again and goes to Yug's house. She gets anxious and encounters Vishwa and decides to leave. Manjiri and Kali get kidnapped by Kalyani, but Yug saves them. Kalyani is arrested and Manjiri goes back to Vishwa and demands Kali and Yug's alliance. Gauri drinks poison but she is saved and Vishwa realises that it was not Kali being kaala teeka that worked for Gauri but her prayers were the ones which truly worked. He fixes Yug and Kali's alliance to which Yug's mother Leelavita \"Leela\" Choudhary agrees only because of a hidden motto and she doesn't want Kali to be her daughter-in-law. Therefore, Leela and Gauri team up. Yug marries Kali but everyone get tricked as they assume it is Gauri who is marrying Yug. Yug doesn't trust Kali anymore and goes with Gauri. Yug starts to hate Kali.\n\nTime passes by and Yug finally finds out the truth behind Gauri and gets married to Kali once again. Gauri then plans to make Kali seem dead by injecting some type of medicine on her but that plan fails when her injection breaks. Instead, she puts the poison in the safety pin and hooks it on Kali's doli. Kali is pricked by the safety pin. While performing rituals and praying in the temple at Yug's house, Kali faints. They call the doctor but the doctor tells everyone that Kali is dead. Just then, Yug realizes that it could have been Gauri and goes to her hotel to drag her there. She fakes and does some drama of crying and says she will bring Kali back to life by burning kapur on her hand. She has already put chemical on her hand to make sure her palm doesn't burn. The poison wears off and Kali regains conscientious, leaving everyone believing Gauri. However Yug does not believe Gauri and sends her out of the house. Gauri vows for revenge. She comes back as a servant and starts to make Leela believe that an evil spirit is haunting her. She brings a fake astrologer and he tells that Yug should be 21 kilometers away from the house. Leela and Yug believe it and Yug leaves. Later with the help of the astrologer, Gauri makes it look like Kali has the evil spirit inside her and Leela decides to sacrifice Kali. Manjiri comes to Yug's house and discovers that there is a pooja going on and asks for Kali, who is locked in a room. Manjiri gets suspicious and follows the car leading to the ashram. She brings a real astrologer and the truth behind Gauri gets revealed to everyone. Kali, enraged, slaps Gauri for her deeds and Gauri later reveals to everyone that Leela did not want Kali to be her daughter in law and encouraged Gauri that Yug would be married to her. Yug gets distraught and leaves while Gauri and the fake astrologer get arrested. Gauri vows to destroy his whole family. After three months however, Gauri who is released from jail returns and reveals to everyone that she is pregnant with Yug's child. Because of this Yug allows her to stay until the child is born. Later, it is revealed that Kaali is also pregnant. This matter however, is only known by Gauri and Vishwa as they bribed the nurse to get her reports before she does. In order to make sure that Kaali and Yug stay apart Gauri plans to have Kali thrown out of the house which is eventually carried out by Yug himself, as he does so Vishwa then takes Kaali to the top of a cliff and reveals her pregnancy to her just as he is about to push her off. Vishwa pushes Kali off of the cliff but Kali hangs onto a branch. Vishwa throws rock at her and she falls. Afterwards, Kali's suicide note comes and everyone believes Kali to be dead. Leela asks Yug to marry Gauri and give the child a legitimate name. Yug agrees to marry Gauri. Meanwhile, Kali doesn't die and is saved by a mentally challenged man named Nandu Singh ([[Mayank Gandhi]]). Kali asks Nandu to take her to Choudhary House. Nandu takes her there but returns. There back in his village, some kids tease him as Kali's husband. Nandu becomes shy and later, Nandu marries Kali and then takes her to the hospital where he gets to know that Kali is in coma.\n\n'''7 months later'''\n\nYug is now turned as a puppet for Vishwaveer. Vishwaveer is the new landlord of Choudhary House. Nandu is seen taking care of Kali in the hospital. The nurses discuss that Kali has lost her child. Gauri and Yug travel to Veerpur. On there way Gauri gets labour pain and Yug takes her to the same hospital where Kali is admitted. Vishwaveer finds out that Kali is in the hospital. Meanwhile, Gauri delivers a baby girl and names it Naina. Naina gets kidnapped by Vishwa, after being told that baby is threat to his life and Kali finds out about Yug and Gauri and decides to commit suicide on the same river where Vishwa places Naina in a basket and floating away. Kali feels the basket and finds Naina in it and decides to live. She begins to raise Naina. Unknown to Kali is that Naina is Yug and Gauri's daughter, who are distraught after their baby went missing, and names it Naina. It is revealed that Vishwa attempted to kill Naina because of a superstition that says Naina is a threat to him. Manjiri later finds Kali at a temple and Kali reveals that she was once pregnant with Yug's child and Vishwa threw her off the cliff for the sake of Gauri. Manjiri vows revenge on Vishwa and brings Kali to Yug's house. Gauri does not like this and tries to kill her own daughter Naina. However it backfires. Meanwhile, Nandu finds out that Vishwa attempted to kill Kali and vows not to spare him. Fearing that the truth would come out, Vishwa gets rid of all the evidence he could find. He also find out that Kali's adopted daughter is actually Gauri and Yug's daughter Naina. Vishwa attempts to kill Kali and Naina but fails because of Nandu. Manjiri later finds out about this and scolds Vishwa and reveals her revenge against him. Kali and Naina disappeared once again and Manjiri threatens to kill Vishwa if he does not reveal where Kali and Naina are. It is later revealed that Kali had planned this to get the truth from Vishwa. Later, while Vishwa, along with his partner Raj Purohit ([[Rajesh Puri]]) conduct a Pooja, assuming that Kali is dead, Kali pretends to be a spirit to get Vishwa to say the truth. With the help of Nandu and Manjiri, Kali gets the truth out. Yug gets distraught by hearing this and a chandelier falls on Kali. While she is hospitalized Manjiri reveals the truth behind Vishwa and Gauri. Yug later gets Raj and Vishwa arrested but they escape. Naina gets kidnapped again but Kali and Manjiri finds her. Vishwa finds Kali and Manjiri and threatens to kill Kali and Naina. Before he could, Manjiri grabs a trishul and stabs Vishwa, killing him. After Vishwa's funeral, Yug asks Kali for forgiveness but Kali rejects saying that she is not a doll to play with. Nandu offers Kali to stay at his place but Yug threatens to kill Naina if Kali leaves. Kali stays but scolds Yug for being selfish and will only stay for Naina's sake. Leela declares Kali as Naina's official mother as Gauri is too dangerous for the number of sins she committed. At this time, a tantrik named Devri Singh ([[Vineet Raina]]) is introduced and reveals to be Nandu's brother. Kali and Manjiri get suspicious about Devri and ask a priest at an ashram and Raj Purohit, as he has no other option. Manjiri and Kali discover that Devri was Vishwa's Kaala Teeka. They also discovers Devri's true intentions to kill the baby Naina to gain evil powers. It is also revealed in Nandu's kundli that Nandu is Naina's Kaala Teeka. Discovering that Devri is a threat, Yug bans Devri from coming into the house while Devri plot to kill Naina is underway. Devri also decides to kill Kali because she is an obstacle that he has to overcome to kill Naina. But Manjiri and Nandu save them and Nandu and Kali get married for Naina's protection. This infuriates Yug and he decides to kill Nandu but is stopped by Gauri. Devri decides to kill his own brother Nandu in order to get Naina but Devri mistakenly stabs himself. Devri is rushed to the hospital. Yug later snatched Naina from Kali saying that she is no longer her mother. Yug meets with an accident and Naina and Yug are hospitalized. Devri donates blood to Naina but Kali would forgive him if he goes to jail. But Devri escaped and forms another plan to kill Naina. Jamuna soon finds out about this and warns Kali. Kali decides to kill Devri. Raj Purohit later finds out that only Kali and Nandu can kill Devri. Nandu does not want to kill his brother Devri. Kali decides to kill Devri with the help of Yug and she was successful. But Devri is still alive and attempted to drown Kali but is saved by Nandu who kills his own brother Devri.\n\n'''After 8 months'''\n\nKali is now pregnant with Nandu's child and Naina is shown to be 8 months old and causing trouble for Kali, Yug and Gauri. Naina runs to a forest and Kali finds her there. while she was there, she gives birth to Nandu's child and names her Pavitra. A nearby tantrik reveals that Pavitra would not be able to live for no longer than seven years.\n\n'''5 years later'''\n\nNandu had died when he killed Devri. Yug decides to adopt Pavitra. Gauri gets jealous to Kaali because she think that Kaali was take her life. Gauri becomes angry after knowing that Kaali and Yug get closer again. She then burned the house. Everybody is dead but Kaali is trapped in her room. Naina and Pavitra was saved and they ran away from the house. Gauri chases them and wants to kill Pavitra. But fuel tank of her car was leaked and her car was exploded, Gauri dead. In the next day, Chulbuli comes home and is shocked to see the house was burned. Naina and Pavitra go back home and meet Chulbuli. They feel sad when everybody found dead. But Kaali still trapped in her room. They search Kaali and the found her, they take Kaali to hospital. Suddenly, Kaali wake up and hug Naina and Pavitra. Raj Purohit come to hospital and ask forgiveness to Kaali. Raj Purohit confess that myth about kaala teeka of Gauri is just a hoax. He made up the story about kaala teeka because he was treated by Vishwaveer. Kaali forgives him and make him promise to not tell about superstition anymore. Kaali want Chulbuli to take care of her daughter. Kaali closed her eyes and dies. A few days later, Jamuna come home and wants to take Pavitra to stay with her. Naina, Chulbuli and Pavitra herself didn't let her to take Pavitra. Chulbuli says to Raj Purohit to bring Naina and Pavitra to Neel and Sharmila in the city to avoid Jamuna. But before that happen, Jamuna comes and takes Pavitra away. Moving to Bhimpur, the bus in which they were traveling meets with an accident and Jamuna dies. Pavitra faints, falls into the river, and she floats away to another village. Maai finds her and says that she will take care of her.\n\n'''14 years later'''\n\nNaina ([[Sukirti Kandpal]]), Gauri and Yug's daughter, lives in [[Mumbai]] while Pavitra (also [[Simran Pareenja]]), Kaali and Nandu's daughter, lives in Bhimpur village. Pavitra just looks like her mother Kaali. Naina goes to college and on every holiday she goes to several villages in search of Pavitra. This time she went to Bhimpur. In Bhimpur, she stays at a girl's house called Barki, which she helped during a bus accident. Naina doesn't know that the girl in whose house she is staying is Pavitra's house. In Bhimpur, there is a ride called \"Ganga Darpan\" in which innocent girls are decked up as brides and are send to the other village, in order to do prostitution. But the villagers are not aware of this. They think that the girls are being send to an Ashram for being Sanyasi's all their lives. This all is a big sex scandal. In all of this, Thakur Dev Sinha ([[Parag Tyagi]]), the Thakur of the village and the Mahant was involved. However, Naina tried to exposed Thakur Dev and the Mahant in front of the villagers, but nobody listened to her and she was sent back to Mumbai. But Naina didn't gave up and went back to Bhimpur, this time with Chulbuli and Dimpy. There Naina meet Krishna Sinha ([[Karan Sharma (TV actor)|Karan Sharma]]), the son of Thakur Dev Sinha. There was a glimpse of love at first sight. With the help of Krishna and Barki, Naina created a plan to expose the Thakur. The 45th time Barki was chosen for the \"Ganga Darpan\" and Naina wanted to stop this and she succeeds, but Thakur Dev Sinha accused Mahant and he was sent to jail instead of both of them. Then all the girls returned to their parents. However, Thakur Dev tried to kill Naina and Krishna, but couldn't succeed. One day Mai (also Barki's mother) wanted to remove all the proof of Pavitra's existence, but could't do it because Barki got to know that she is Pavitra. Naina saves Barki and they got back to the village. Thakur Dev didn't stop his cunning and slimy tricks. He harms Naina and marries her, cheating Krishna who was about to marry Naina, in order to rape Naina, because she exposed him. Naina losts her memory. Pavitra marries Krishna to enter Thakur Dev's mansion in order to save Naina. Thakur Dev kidnaps Dimpy, Chulbuli and Chutki. When the others got to know that the three were kidnapped, they started to haunt and taunt thakur so that he tells that where Chulbuli, Chutki and Dimpy are. When Thakur Dev was fed up and had enough, he tried to kill Krishna, Naina, Pavitra and Mai. But they didn't died. They returned in Thakur Dev's life to make him pay for his sins, but they didn't succeed in their plans. Thakur Dev now tried to create a rift between Naina and Pavitra, but Pavitra promised that she will make everything right, how it was before. Chulbuli, Dimpy and Chutki managed to escape from the goons den and went to the mansion. Meanwhile, Naina regains her memory. She accuses and abuses Pavitra for marrying Krishna. Now she wants to avenge Pavitra by taking her back to Mumbai, but Thakur didn't want to let go off Naina, because his revenge isn't complete yet. He want to have sex with Naina. He said that Naina and Pavitra only can leave this village if they unmarry back (Krishna with Pavitra and Naina with Thakur Dev). But the opposite happens. Pavitra goes in the room of Thakur Dev to save Naina, but then Krishna arrives in the room of Thakur Dev. After that Thakur Dev beats Krishna up, for stopping him. Meanwhile, the Mahant arrives with the villagers and The Thakurayan to expose Thakur Dev in front of the villagers. Thakurayan succeeds in her plans and the Thakur gets arrested. Now Naina is all set to go to Mumbai, but Pavitra is sad. Pavitra gets married to Krishna in full tradition. Krishna is now the Thakur of the village and Pavitra, the thakurayan. On their home way to Mumbai, Naina's car meets with an accident, because Purohitji told them that if Pavitra and Naina doesn't live together, they won't remain happy in life, because of their half-swastik tattoo on their arms. Naina regains consciousness, and they both go home. From that day, they swore that they will never ever support and believe in superstition, and if they ever see an activity of superstition, they will take action. The story ends with Pavitra and Naina doing an aatma/shanti pooja for Kaali, promising that they will love and help each other and other people in life.\n\n== Cast ==\n===Main===\n====Before leap====\n* [[Simran Pareenja]] as Kaali Jha, Vishwa and Manjiri's adopted daughter, Yug's ex wife, Nandu's wife, Pavitra's mother, Gauri and Neel's half-sister (2016-17)\n* [[Fenil Umrigar]] as Gauri Jha, Vishwa and Madhuri's daughter, Yug's second wife, Kaali's adoptive half-sister, Naina's mother (2016-17)\n* [[Rohan Gandotra]] as Yug Chaudhary, Kaali's ex-husband, Gauri's husband, Naina's father (2016-17) \n* [[Mayank Gandhi]] as Nandu Singh, Kaali's second husband, Pavitra's father (2016-17)\n* [[Bhupinder Singh (actor)|Bhupinder Singh]] as Acharya Jha, Gauri and Neel's father, Kaali's adoptive father, Manjiri and Madhuri's husband (2015-16)\n\n====After leap====   \n* [[Sukirti Kandpal]] as Naina Chaudhary, Gauri and Yug's daughter, Dev's ex-fianc\u00e9e (2017) \n* [[Simran Pareenja]] as Thakurain Pavitra, Kaali and Nandu's daughter, Krishna's wife (2017)\n* [[Karan Sharma (TV actor)|Karan Sharma]] as Thakur Krishna Sinha, Dev's son, Naina's love interest, Pavitra's husband (2017)\n* [[Parag Tyagi]] as Thakur Dev Sinha, Krishna's father, Naina's ex-fianc\u00e9 (2017)\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Pratima Kazmi]] as Maai, Pavitra's caretaker (2017) \n* [[Ashita Dhawan]] as Chulbuli (2017) \n* [[Dalljiet Kaur|Daljeet Kaur Bhanot]] as Manjiri Jha, Vishwa's first wife, Kaali's adoptive mother, Gauri and Neel's step-mother (2015-16; 2016-17)\n* [[Rajesh Puri]] as Raj Purohit (2016-17)\n* Hifsa Sharma as Dimpy (2017)\n* [[Nivin Ramani]] as Neelkanth Jha, Vishwa-Madhuri's son, Gauri's brother, Kaali's adoptive half-brother, Sharmila's husband (2016-17)\n* Meenu Panchal as Sharmila Chaudhary, Yug's sister, Neel's wife (2016-17)\n* [[Vineet Raina]] as Devri Singh, Nandu's brother (2016-17) \n* Geeta Agarwal as Leelavati Chaudhary, Yug and Sharmila's mother (2016-17) \n* [[Mita Vashisht]] as Jethi Maa (2016)\n* Akshara Singh as Madhuri Jha, Vishwa's second wife, Gauri and Neel's mother, Kaali's adoptive step-mother (2015-17)\n* [[Mona Ambegaonkar]] as Kalyani Jha, Vishwa's sister-in-law, Gauri and Neel's aunt, Kaali's adoptive aunt (2015-17) \n* Shriyansh Tiwari as Heera (2015) \n* [[Varun Sharma]] as Shambhu (2015) \n* Surya Sharma as Aryan (2016)\n* Praveen Hingonia as Bablu (2015-16)\n* Pratichee Mishra as Jamuna (2016-17)\n* Adaa Narang as Young Gauri (2015-16)<ref name=\"fc\">{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/Kaala-Teeka-Know-all-about-the-show/updates/49672251.cms|title=Kaala Teeka|work=The Times of India|accessdate=9 April 2016}}</ref>\n* Sargam Khurana as young Kaali (2015-16)<ref name=\"fc\" />\n* [[Sara Khan (TV actress)|Sara Khan]] as Dancer in Temple, Special appearance in crossover episode with [[Sarojini - Ek Nayi Pehal|Sarojini]] (2016)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.zee5.com/tvshows/details/kaala-teeka/0-6-126 Official website]\n\n{{Zee TV Programmes}}\n\n[[Category:Zee TV television series]]\n[[Category:Indian drama television series]]\n[[Category:2015 Indian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2017 Indian television series endings]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaala_Teeka"}

Their diet is omnivorous: feeding on a range of wattle saps and exudates, [[lerp (biology)|lerps]], and a high proportion of [[arthropod]]s which they find under the loose bark of eucalypts, including spiders, crickets, termites and beetles. Plant exudates make up 80% of their energy intake, but the protein provided by the arthropods is essential for successful breeding.<ref name=\"Leadbeater's Possum\"/>\n\nBirths are usually timed for the beginning of winter (May and June) or late spring (October and November).

His career was marked by constant reinvention and visual presentation, with his music and stagecraft having a significant impact on [[popular music]]. He sold over 100 million records worldwide during his life, making him one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling music artists]]. He had 10 platinum, 11 gold, and eight silver album certifications in the UK, and released [[List of artists by number of UK Albums Chart number ones|11 No. 1 albums]]. In the US, he received five platinum and nine gold album certifications. He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1996.\n\nBorn in the [[Brixton]] area of [[London]], Bowie developed an interest in music as a child, eventually studying art, music, and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. \"[[Space Oddity]]\" became his first top-five entry on the [[UK Singles Chart]] after its release in July 1969. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the [[glam rock]] era with his flamboyant and androgynous [[alter ego]] Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of his single \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" and album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'', which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted radically towards a sound he characterised as \"[[plastic soul]]\", initially alienating many of his UK devotees but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the No. 1 single \"[[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]\" and the album ''[[Young Americans]]''. In 1976, he starred in the cult film ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'' and released the album ''[[Station to Station]]''. The following year, he further confounded musical expectations with the [[electronic music|electronic]]-inflected album ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'' (1977), the first of three collaborations with [[Brian Eno]] that came to be known as the \"[[Berlin Trilogy]]\". The album was followed in the trilogy by ''[[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|\"Heroes\"]]'' (1977) and ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'' (1979), and each album reached the UK top five while receiving lasting critical praise.\n\nAfter uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK No. 1 hits with the 1980 single \"[[Ashes to Ashes (David Bowie song)|Ashes to Ashes]]\", its parent album ''[[Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)]]'', and \"[[Under Pressure]]\", a 1981 collaboration with [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. He reached his commercial peak in 1983 with ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]'', and the album's [[Let's Dance (David Bowie song)|title track]] topped both UK and US charts. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, he continued to experiment with musical styles, including [[industrial music|industrial]] and [[oldschool jungle|jungle]]. He also continued acting with roles as Major Jack Celliers in ''[[Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence]]'' (1983), [[Jareth]] the Goblin King in ''[[Labyrinth (1986 film)|Labyrinth]]'' (1986), [[Pontius Pilate]] in ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' (1988), and [[Nikola Tesla]] in ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos.\n\nBowie stopped touring after 2004, and his final live performance was at a charity event in 2006. Bowie returned from a decade-long recording hiatus with the 2013 album ''[[The Next Day]]'', and remained musically active until he [[Death of David Bowie|died of liver cancer]] at his [[New York City]] home on 10 January 2016, two days after his 69th birthday and the release of his final album ''[[Blackstar (album)|Blackstar]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nBowie was born David Robert Jones on 8 January 1947 in the [[Brixton]] area of [[London]].

The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road in [[Lambeth]], on the boundary between Brixton and [[Stockwell]]. Bowie attended [[Stockwell Primary School|Stockwell Infants School]] until he was six years old, acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded child and a defiant brawler.<ref>Sandford (1997): pp. 9\u201316</ref>\n\nIn 1953, Bowie moved with his family to [[Bromley]]. In 1955, he started attending Burnt Ash Junior School. His voice was considered \"adequate\" by the school choir, and he demonstrated above-average abilities in playing the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]].<ref name=\"sandford18-19\">Sandford (1997): pp. 18\u201319</ref> At the age of nine, his dancing during the newly-introduced music and movement classes was strikingly imaginative: teachers called his interpretations \"vividly artistic\" and his poise \"astonishing\" for a child.<ref name=\"sandford18-19\"/> The same year, his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of American [[Gramophone record|45s]] by artists including [[the Teenagers]], [[the Platters]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Elvis Presley]], and [[Little Richard]].<ref>Buckley (2000): p. 21.</ref><ref name=\"sandford19-20\" /> Bowie would later say that upon hearing Little Richard's song \"[[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]\", he had \"heard God\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Doggett|first=Peter|title=Teenage Wildlife|journal=Mojo Classic|issue=60 Years of Bowie|pages=8\u20139|date=January 2007}}</ref>\n\nBowie was first impressed with Presley when he saw his cousin dance to \"[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]\".<ref name=\"sandford19-20\">Sandford (1997): pp. 19\u201320</ref> By the end of the following year, he had taken up the [[ukulele]] and [[tea-chest bass]], begun to participate in [[skiffle]] sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile, his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and [[Chuck Berry]]\u2014complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists\u2014to his local [[Cub Scout|Wolf Cub]] group was described as \"mesmerizing&nbsp;... like someone from another planet\".<ref name=\"sandford19-20\" /> After taking his [[eleven-plus]] exam at the conclusion of his Burnt Ash Junior education, Bowie went to [[Ravens Wood School|Bromley Technical High School]].<ref name=\"bromleytech\"/>\n\nIt was an unusual technical school, as biographer Christopher Sandford wrote:\n\n{{cquote|Despite its status it was, by the time David arrived in 1958, as rich in arcane ritual as any [English] [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|public school]]. There were [[House system|houses]] named after eighteenth-century statesmen like [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|Pitt]] and [[William Wilberforce|Wilberforce]]. There was a uniform, and an elaborate system of rewards and punishments. There was also an accent on languages, science and particularly design, where a collegiate atmosphere flourished under the tutorship of [[Owen Frampton]]. In David's account, Frampton led through force of personality, not intellect; his colleagues at Bromley Tech were famous for neither, and yielded the school's most gifted pupils to the arts, a regime so liberal that Frampton actively encouraged his own son, [[Peter Frampton|Peter]], to pursue a musical career with David, a partnership briefly intact thirty years later.<ref name=\"bromleytech\">Sandford (1997): pp. 21\u201322</ref>}}\n\nBowie studied art, music, and design, including layout and typesetting. After his half-brother Terry Burns introduced him to modern jazz, his enthusiasm for players like [[Charles Mingus]] and [[John Coltrane]] led his mother to give him a [[Grafton saxophone]] in 1961. He was soon receiving lessons from [[baritone saxophone|baritone saxophonist]] [[Ronnie Ross]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.berklee.edu/commencement/past|title=Commencement 1999 - Berklee College of Music|website=www.berklee.edu|accessdate=10 February 2018}}</ref><ref>Sandford (1997): p. 25</ref> He received a serious injury at school in 1962 when his friend [[George Underwood (artist)|George Underwood]] punched him in the left eye during a fight over a girl.

Playing guitar-based [[rock and roll]] at local youth gatherings and weddings, the Konrads had a varying line-up of between four and eight members, Underwood among them.<ref>Sandford (1997): p. 28</ref> When Bowie left the technical school the following year, he informed his parents of his intention to become a pop star. His mother arranged his employment as an electrician's mate. Frustrated by his bandmates' limited aspirations, Bowie left the Konrads and joined another band, the King Bees. He wrote to the newly successful washing-machine entrepreneur [[John Bloom (businessman)|John Bloom]] inviting him to \"do for us what [[Brian Epstein]] has done for [[the Beatles]]\u2014and make another million.\" Bloom did not respond to the offer, but his referral to [[Dick James]]'s partner Leslie Conn led to Bowie's first personal management contract.<ref name=\"sandford29-30\">Sandford (1997): pp. 29\u201330</ref>\n\nConn quickly began to promote Bowie. The singer's debut single, \"[[Liza Jane (David Bowie song)|Liza Jane]]\", credited to Davie Jones with the King Bees, was not commercially successful. Dissatisfied with the King Bees and their repertoire of [[Howlin' Wolf]] and [[Willie Dixon]] covers, Bowie quit the band less than a month later to join the Manish Boys, another blues outfit, who incorporated folk and soul\u2014\"I used to dream of being their [[Mick Jagger]]\", Bowie was to recall.<ref name=\"sandford29-30\" /> Their cover of [[Bobby Bland]]'s \"[[I Pity the Fool]]\" was no more successful than \"Liza Jane\", and Bowie soon moved on again to join the Lower Third, a blues trio strongly influenced by [[The Who]]. \"[[You've Got a Habit of Leaving]]\" fared no better, signalling the end of Conn's contract. Declaring that he would exit the pop music world \"to study mime at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre|Sadler's Wells]]\", Bowie nevertheless remained with the Lower Third. His new manager, Ralph Horton, later instrumental in his transition to solo artist, soon witnessed Bowie's move to yet another group, the Buzz, yielding the singer's fifth unsuccessful single release, \"[[Do Anything You Say]]\". While with the Buzz, Bowie also joined the [[The Riot Squad|Riot Squad]]; their recordings, which included one of Bowie's original songs and material by [[The Velvet Underground]], went unreleased. [[Kenneth Pitt]], introduced by Horton, took over as Bowie's manager.<ref>Sandford (1997): pp. 35\u201339</ref>\n\nDissatisfied with his stage name as Davy (and Davie) Jones, which in the mid-1960s invited confusion with [[Davy Jones (musician)|Davy Jones]] of [[The Monkees]], Bowie renamed himself after the 19th-century American pioneer [[James Bowie]] and [[Bowie knife|the knife he had popularised]].<ref>Buckley (2000): p. 33</ref> His April 1967 solo single, \"[[The Laughing Gnome]]\", using speeded-up thus high-pitched vocals, failed to chart. Released six weeks later, his album debut, ''[[David Bowie (1967 album)|David Bowie]]'', an amalgam of pop, [[psychedelic rock|psychedelia]], and [[music hall]], met the same fate.

Onstage I achieve emotion. It's probably why I prefer dressing up as Ziggy to being David.\" With satisfaction came severe personal difficulties: acting the same role over an extended period, it became impossible for him to separate Ziggy Stardust\u2014and later, the Thin White Duke\u2014from his own character offstage. Ziggy, Bowie said, \"wouldn't leave me alone for years. That was when it all started to go sour&nbsp;... My whole personality was affected. It became very dangerous. I really did have doubts about my sanity.\"<ref>Sandford (1997): pp. 106\u201307</ref> His later Ziggy shows, which included songs from both ''Ziggy Stardust'' and ''Aladdin Sane'', were ultra-theatrical affairs filled with shocking stage moments, such as Bowie stripping down to a [[sumo]] wrestling loincloth or simulating [[oral sex]] with Ronson's guitar.<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record p.7\">Carr & Murray (1981): p. 7</ref> Bowie toured and gave press conferences as Ziggy before a dramatic and abrupt on-stage \"retirement\" at London's [[Hammersmith Odeon]] on 3 July 1973.

He was a leading figure in the music industry and is considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. He was acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, with his music and stagecraft having a significant impact on [[popular music]]. During his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at over 100 million records worldwide, made him one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling music artists]]. In the UK, he was awarded ten [[Music recording certification|platinum]] album certifications, eleven gold and eight silver, and released [[List of artists by number of UK Albums Chart number ones|eleven number-one albums]]. In the US, he received five platinum and nine gold certifications. He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1996.\n\nBorn in [[Brixton]], [[South London]], Bowie developed an interest in music as a child, eventually studying art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. \"[[Space Oddity]]\" became his first top-five entry on the [[UK Singles Chart]] after its release in July 1969. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the [[glam rock]] era with his flamboyant and androgynous [[alter ego]] Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of his single \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" and album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'', which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted radically towards a sound he characterised as \"[[plastic soul]]\", initially alienating many of his UK devotees but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one single \"[[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]\" and the album ''[[Young Americans]]''. In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'', directed by [[Nicolas Roeg]], and released ''[[Station to Station]]''. The following year, he further confounded musical expectations with the [[electronic music|electronic]]-inflected album ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'' (1977), the first of three collaborations with [[Brian Eno]] that came to be known as the \"[[Berlin Trilogy]]\". ''[[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|\"Heroes\"]]'' (1977) and ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'' (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.\n\nAfter uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number ones with the 1980 single \"[[Ashes to Ashes (David Bowie song)|Ashes to Ashes]]\", its parent album ''[[Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)]]'', and \"[[Under Pressure]]\", a 1981 collaboration with [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. He reached his commercial peak in 1983 with ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]''; the album's [[Let's Dance (David Bowie song)|title track]] topped both UK and US charts. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including [[industrial music|industrial]] and [[oldschool jungle|jungle]]. He also continued acting; his roles included Major Jack Celliers in ''[[Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence]]'' (1983), [[Jareth]] the Goblin King in ''[[Labyrinth (1986 film)|Labyrinth]]'' (1986), [[Pontius Pilate]] in ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' (1988), and [[Nikola Tesla]] in ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos. He stopped touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. In 2013, Bowie returned from a decade-long recording hiatus with ''[[The Next Day]].'' He remained musically active until he [[Death of David Bowie|died of liver cancer]] at his home in [[New York City]], two days after his 69th birthday and the release of his final album, ''[[Blackstar (album)|Blackstar]]'' (2016).\n\n==Early life==\nBowie was born David Robert Jones on 8 January 1947 in [[Brixton]], London.

The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road, on the boundary between Brixton and [[Stockwell]] in the south London borough of [[Lambeth]]. Bowie attended [[Stockwell Primary School|Stockwell Infants School]] until he was six years old, acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded child\u2014and a defiant brawler.<ref>Sandford (1997): pp. 9\u201316</ref>\n\nIn 1953, Bowie moved with his family to [[Bromley]]. Two years later, he started attending Burnt Ash Junior School. His voice was considered \"adequate\" by the school choir, and he demonstrated above-average abilities in playing the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]].<ref name=\"sandford18-19\">Sandford (1997): pp. 18\u201319</ref> At the age of nine, his dancing during the newly-introduced music and movement classes was strikingly imaginative: teachers called his interpretations \"vividly artistic\" and his poise \"astonishing\" for a child.<ref name=\"sandford18-19\"/> The same year, his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of American [[Gramophone record|45s]] by artists including [[the Teenagers]], [[the Platters]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Elvis Presley]], and [[Little Richard]].<ref>Buckley (2000): p. 21.</ref><ref name=\"sandford19-20\" /> Upon listening to Little Richard's song \"[[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]\", Bowie would later say that he had \"heard God\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Doggett|first=Peter|title=Teenage Wildlife|journal=Mojo Classic|issue=60 Years of Bowie|pages=8\u20139|date=January 2007}}</ref>\n\nBowie was first impressed with Presley when he saw his cousin dance to \"[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]\".<ref name=\"sandford19-20\">Sandford (1997): pp. 19\u201320</ref> By the end of the following year, Bowie had taken up the [[ukulele]] and [[tea-chest bass]], begun to participate in [[skiffle]] sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile, his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and [[Chuck Berry]]\u2014complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists\u2014to his local [[Cub Scout|Wolf Cub]] group was described as \"mesmerizing&nbsp;... like someone from another planet\".<ref name=\"sandford19-20\" /> After taking his [[eleven-plus]] exam at the conclusion of his Burnt Ash Junior education, Bowie went to [[Ravens Wood School|Bromley Technical High School]].<ref name=\"bromleytech\"/>\n\nIt was an unusual technical school, as biographer Christopher Sandford wrote:\n\n{{quote|Despite its status it was, by the time David arrived in 1958, as rich in arcane ritual as any [English] [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|public school]]. There were [[House system|houses]] named after eighteenth-century statesmen like [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|Pitt]] and [[William Wilberforce|Wilberforce]]. There was a uniform, and an elaborate system of rewards and punishments. There was also an accent on languages, science and particularly design, where a collegiate atmosphere flourished under the tutorship of [[Owen Frampton]]. In David's account, Frampton led through force of personality, not intellect; his colleagues at Bromley Tech were famous for neither, and yielded the school's most gifted pupils to the arts, a regime so liberal that Frampton actively encouraged his own son, [[Peter Frampton|Peter]], to pursue a musical career with David, a partnership briefly intact thirty years later.<ref name=\"bromleytech\">Sandford (1997): pp. 21\u201322</ref>}}\n\nBowie studied art, music, and design, including layout and typesetting. After his half-brother Terry Burns introduced him to modern jazz, his enthusiasm for players like [[Charles Mingus]] and [[John Coltrane]] led his mother to give him a [[Grafton saxophone]] in 1961. He was soon receiving lessons from [[baritone saxophone|baritone saxophonist]] [[Ronnie Ross]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.berklee.edu/commencement/past|title=Commencement 1999 - Berklee College of Music|website=www.berklee.edu|accessdate=10 February 2018}}</ref><ref>Sandford (1997): p. 25</ref> He received a serious injury at school in 1962 when his friend [[George Underwood (artist)|George Underwood]] punched him in the left eye during a fight over a girl.

Playing guitar-based [[rock and roll]] at local youth gatherings and weddings, the Konrads had a varying line-up of between four and eight members, Underwood among them.<ref>Sandford (1997): p. 28</ref> When Bowie left the technical school the following year, he informed his parents of his intention to become a pop star. His mother arranged his employment as an electrician's mate. Frustrated by his bandmates' limited aspirations, Bowie left the Konrads and joined another band, the King Bees. He wrote to the newly successful washing-machine entrepreneur [[John Bloom (businessman)|John Bloom]] inviting him to \"do for us what [[Brian Epstein]] has done for [[the Beatles]]\u2014and make another million.\" Bloom did not respond to the offer, but his referral to [[Dick James]]'s partner Leslie Conn led to Bowie's first personal management contract.<ref name=\"sandford29-30\">Sandford (1997): pp. 29\u201330</ref>\n\nConn quickly began to promote Bowie. The singer's debut single, \"[[Liza Jane (David Bowie song)|Liza Jane]]\", credited to Davie Jones with the King Bees, was not commercially successful. Dissatisfied with the King Bees and their repertoire of [[Howlin' Wolf]] and [[Willie Dixon]] covers, Bowie quit the band less than a month later to join the Manish Boys, another blues outfit, who incorporated folk and soul\u2014\"I used to dream of being their [[Mick Jagger]]\", Bowie was to recall.<ref name=\"sandford29-30\" /> Their cover of [[Bobby Bland]]'s \"[[I Pity the Fool]]\" was no more successful than \"Liza Jane\", and Bowie soon moved on again to join the Lower Third, a blues trio strongly influenced by [[The Who]]. \"[[You've Got a Habit of Leaving]]\" fared no better, signalling the end of Conn's contract. Declaring that he would exit the pop music world \"to study mime at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre|Sadler's Wells]]\", Bowie nevertheless remained with the Lower Third. His new manager, Ralph Horton, later instrumental in his transition to solo artist, soon witnessed Bowie's move to yet another group, the Buzz, yielding the singer's fifth unsuccessful single release, \"[[Do Anything You Say]]\". While with the Buzz, Bowie also joined the [[The Riot Squad|Riot Squad]]; their recordings, which included one of Bowie's original songs and material by [[The Velvet Underground]], went unreleased. [[Kenneth Pitt]], introduced by Horton, took over as Bowie's manager.<ref>Sandford (1997): pp. 35\u201339</ref>\n\nDissatisfied with his stage name as Davy (and Davie) Jones, which in the mid-1960s invited confusion with [[Davy Jones (musician)|Davy Jones]] of [[The Monkees]], Bowie renamed himself after the 19th-century American pioneer [[James Bowie]] and [[Bowie knife|the knife he had popularised]].<ref>Buckley (2000): p. 33</ref> His April 1967 solo single, \"[[The Laughing Gnome]]\", using speeded-up thus high-pitched vocals, failed to chart. Released six weeks later, his album debut, ''[[David Bowie (1967 album)|David Bowie]]'', an amalgam of pop, [[psychedelic rock|psychedelia]], and [[music hall]], met the same fate.

Onstage I achieve emotion. It's probably why I prefer dressing up as Ziggy to being David.\" With satisfaction came severe personal difficulties: acting the same role over an extended period, it became impossible for him to separate Ziggy Stardust\u2014and later, the Thin White Duke\u2014from his own character offstage. Ziggy, Bowie said, \"wouldn't leave me alone for years. That was when it all started to go sour&nbsp;... My whole personality was affected. It became very dangerous. I really did have doubts about my sanity.\"<ref>Sandford (1997): pp. 106\u201307</ref> His later Ziggy shows, which included songs from both ''Ziggy Stardust'' and ''Aladdin Sane'', were ultra-theatrical affairs filled with shocking stage moments, such as Bowie stripping down to a [[sumo]] wrestling loincloth or simulating [[oral sex]] with Ronson's guitar.<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record p.7\">Carr & Murray (1981): p. 7</ref> Bowie toured and gave press conferences as Ziggy before a dramatic and abrupt on-stage \"retirement\" at London's [[Hammersmith Odeon]] on 3 July 1973.
