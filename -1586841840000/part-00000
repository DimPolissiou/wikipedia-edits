Yankovic's first top ten ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' album (''[[Straight Outta Lynwood]]'') and single (\"[[White & Nerdy]]\") were both released in 2006, nearly three decades into his career. His latest album, ''[[Mandatory Fun]]'' (2014), became his first number-one album during its debut week.\n\nYankovic's success comes in part from his effective use of music video to further parody popular culture, the song's original artist, and the original music videos themselves, scene-for-scene in some cases. He directed later videos himself and went on to direct for other artists, including [[Ben Folds]], [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]], [[The Black Crowes]], and [[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|The Presidents of the United States of America]]. With the decline of [[music television]] and the onset of [[social media]], Yankovic used [[YouTube]] and other video sites to publish his videos; this strategy proved integral, helping to boost sales of his later albums, including ''Mandatory Fun''. Yankovic has stated that he may forgo traditional albums in favor of timely releases of singles and EPs following on this success.\n\nIn addition to recording his albums, Yankovic wrote and starred in the film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' (1989) and the television series ''[[The Weird Al Show]]'' (1997). He has also made guest appearances and performed voice acting roles on many television shows and video web content, in addition to starring in ''[[Al TV]]'' specials on [[MTV]].<ref name=allmusic>{{cite news|last=Ankeny |first=Jason |title=Weird Al Yankovic Biography |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/weird-al-yankovic-mn0000817315/biography |publisher=[[AllMusic.com]] ([[Rovi]]) |accessdate=July 24, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6aGZzJGWM?url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/weird-al-yankovic-mn0000817315/biography |archivedate=July 24, 2015 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> He has also written two children's books, ''When I Grow Up'' and ''My New Teacher and Me!''\n\n== Early life ==\n{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | headerimage=[[File:\"Weird Al\" Yankovic.JPG|210px]] | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LyNbCRQsck 'Weird Al' Yankovic \u2013 Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?], 7:02, [[Diffuser.fm]]<ref name=\"forf\">{{cite web | title ='Weird Al' Yankovic Plays 'Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?' | website = | publisher =[[Diffuser.fm]] | date = July 30, 2014 | url =http://diffuser.fm/weird-al-wikipedia-fact-or-fiction/ | accessdate =September 29, 2015 }}</ref> }}\n\nYankovic was born in [[Downey, California]] and raised in [[Lynwood, California]].

Yankovic had been called \"Weird Al\" originally as a more derogatory nickname from others within the dormitory he shared, as he was seen at the strange outcast compared to other residents.<Ref name=\"nytimes apr2020\"/> Though he initially took it as an insult, Yankovic eventually \"took it on professionally\" as his persona for the station.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> In 1978, he released his first recording (as Alfred Yankovic), \"Take Me Down\", on the LP, ''Slo Grown'', as a benefit for the Economic Opportunity Commission of [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo County]]. The song mocked famous nearby landmarks such as [[Bubblegum Alley]] and the fountain toilets at the [[Madonna Inn]].\n\nIn mid-1979, shortly before his senior year, \"[[My Sharona]]\" by [[The Knack]] was on the charts and Yankovic took his accordion into the restroom across the hall from the radio station to take advantage of the [[echo chamber]] acoustics and recorded a parody titled \"[[My Bologna]]\".<ref name= takingoff/> He sent it to Dr. Demento, who played it to good response from listeners.  Yankovic met The Knack after a show at his college and introduced himself as the author of \"My Bologna\". The Knack's lead singer, [[Doug Fieger]], said he liked the song and suggested that [[Capitol Records]] vice president [[Rupert Perry]] release it as a single.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> \"My Bologna\" was released as a single with \"School Cafeteria\" as its B-side, and the label gave Yankovic a six-month recording contract.  Yankovic, who was \"only getting average grades\" in his architecture degree, began to realize that he might make a career of comedic music.<ref name=\"booklet\"/>\n\nOn September 14, 1980, Yankovic was a guest on the ''Dr. Demento Show'', where he was to record a new parody live. The song was called \"[[Another One Rides the Bus]]\", a parody of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s hit, \"[[Another One Bites the Dust]]\". While practicing the song outside the sound booth, he met [[Jon Schwartz (drummer)|Jon \"Bermuda\" Schwartz]], who told him he was a drummer and agreed to bang on Yankovic's accordion case to help Yankovic keep a steady beat during the song. They rehearsed the song just a few times before the show began.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> \"Another One Rides the Bus\" became so popular that Yankovic's first television appearance was a performance of the song on ''[[Tomorrow (TV series)|The Tomorrow Show]]'' (April 21, 1981) with [[Tom Snyder]].<ref>{{cite document |title=TV Listings, Tuesday, April 21 |work=The Baltimore Sun |date=April 19, 1981 |page=TV24 |id={{ProQuest|535950110}} }}</ref> On the show, Yankovic played his accordion, and again, Schwartz banged on the accordion case and provided comical sound effects.

His stage act in a [[Phoenix, Arizona]], nightclub caught the eye of manager Jay Levey, who was \"blown away\".<ref name=\"booklet\"/> Levey asked Yankovic if he had considered creating a full band and doing his music as a career. Yankovic admitted that he had, so Levey held auditions. [[Steve Jay]] became Yankovic's bass player, and Jay's friend [[Jim West (guitarist)|Jim West]] played guitar. Schwartz continued on drums. Yankovic's first show with his new band was on March 31, 1982.<ref name=\"livepage\"/>  Several days later, Yankovic and his band were the opening act for [[Missing Persons (band)|Missing Persons]].\n\nYankovic recorded \"[[I Love Rocky Road]]\", (a parody of \"[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]\" originally recorded by [[Arrows (British band)|The Arrows]]) which was produced by [[Rick Derringer]], in 1982. The song was a hit on Top 40 radio, leading to Yankovic's signing with [[Scotti Brothers Records]]. In 1983, Yankovic's first [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic (album)|self-titled album]] was released on Scotti Bros. The song \"[[Ricky (song)|Ricky]]\" was released as a single and the music video received exposure on the still-young [[MTV]]. \"Ricky\" broke the top 100 videos on MTV at the time, which Yankovic took as a sign that his career was in music, quitting his job as a mailroom clerk at the local offices of [[Westwood One (1976-2011)|Westwood One]] to pursue the music career.<ref name=\"wapost feb2017\"/>\n\nYankovic released his second album ''[[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic in 3-D]]'' in 1984. The first single \"[[Eat It]]\", a parody of the [[Michael Jackson]] song \"[[Beat It]]\", became popular, thanks in part to the music video, a shot-for-shot parody of Jackson's \"Beat It\" music video, and what Yankovic sarcastically described as his \"uncanny resemblance\" to Jackson. \"Eat It\" was also aided by the first of Yankovic's ''[[Al TV]]'' specials that aired on [[MTV]] on April 1, 1984, the network looking to Yankovic's rising popularity to help fill its programming time.<Ref name=\"nytimes apr2020\"/> Peaking at No.  12 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] on April 14, 1984,<ref>{{cite web |title=Eat It \u2013 Weird Al Yankovic |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=weird al yankovic|chart=all}} |work=Billboard}}</ref> \"Eat It\" remained Yankovic's highest-charting single until \"[[White & Nerdy]]\" placed at No.  9 in October 2006.<ref>{{cite news |title=White & Nerdy |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=weird al yankovic|chart=all}} |work=Billboard}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, Yankovic co-wrote and starred in a [[mockumentary]] of his own life titled ''[[The Compleat Al]]'' (the title being a parody of the 1982 documentary ''[[The Compleat Beatles]]''), which intertwined the facts of his life up to that point with fiction. The movie also featured some clips from Yankovic's trip to Japan and some clips from the ''[[Al TV]]'' specials. ''The Compleat Al'' was co-directed by Jay Levey, who would direct ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' four years later. Also released around the same time as ''The Compleat Al'' was ''The Authorized Al'', a biographical book based on the film.

Yankovic's parodies are often satirical of [[popular culture]], including television (''see [[The TV Album]]''), movies (\"[[The Saga Begins]]\"), and food (''see [[The Food Album]]'').

Madonna's friend was a mutual friend of Yankovic's manager, Jay Levey, and eventually Yankovic himself heard the story from Levey.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> In writing his parodies as well as his original songs, Yankovic spends a great deal of time in deciding the right words that not only match the beat of the original song but that fit theme of the parody. He says that some songs have taken him weeks to compose the lyrics to as he permeates the various choices, sometimes entering a \"zombie phase\" as he mulls these over in his home. For example, Yankovic believes he could have written a completely different version of \"White & Nerdy\" based on the alternative choices of lyrics he had come up with and had discarded for the final song. He has also done significant research for other song parodies to get facts and keywords for certain areas of knowledge, such as for \"I Think I'm a Clone Now\" or hospitals for \"Like a Surgeon\". Yankovic has documented all these past lyrical attempts, first through binders and then computerized in case he needs to go back for future songs. <ref name=\"nytimes apr2020\"/>\n\n===Polka medleys===\nMost of Yankovic's studio albums include a [[polka]] medley of about a dozen contemporary songs at the time of the album, with the choruses or memorable lines of various songs juxtaposed for humorous effect. In Yankovic's early career, before recording his first album, he had performed such polka medleys in live shows in California, though then using songs from lesser-known bands like [[Bad Brains]] and the [[Plasmatics]]. He had been inspired to do so from Spike Jones, who had transitioned classical music into polka.<ref name=\"avbook book excerpt\">{{cite web | url = https://www.avclub.com/exclusive-book-excerpt-weird-al-isnt-just-a-parody-mas-1819695905 | title = Exclusive book excerpt: Weird Al isn't just a parody master | first = Ray | last = Padgett | date = October 25, 2017 | accessdate = November 15, 2017 | work = [[The A.V.

He had originally just pulled the number 27 as a random figure to use in filling out lyrics, but as his fans started to notice the reuse of the number after the first few times, he began to purposely drop references to 27 within his lyrics, videos, and album covers.

A number of songs use the phrase \"internal organs\". Also, a [[hamster]] called [[Harvey the Wonder Hamster]] is a recurring character in ''[[The Weird Al Show]]'' and the ''Al TV'' specials, as well as the subject of an original song on ''[[Alapalooza]]''. Other recurring jokes include Yankovic borrowing, or being owed, $5. In a number of ''Al TV'' interviews, he often asks if he can borrow $5, being turned down every time. This motif also occurs in \"[[Poodle Hat|Why Does This Always Happen to Me?]]\", in which his deceased friend owes him $5. Another recurring joke is his attraction to female nostrils or nostrils in general. This also appears in numerous ''Al TV'' interviews as well as in several of his songs (\"[[Albuquerque (song)|Albuquerque]]\" and \"[[Poodle Hat|Wanna B Ur Lovr]]\" to name a few.) Yankovic also asks his celebrity guests if they could \"shave his back for a nickel.\" This also appears in the song \"[[Albuquerque (song)|Albuquerque]]\". Yankovic has also put two [[backmasking]] messages into his songs. The first, in \"Nature Trail to Hell\", said \"Satan Eats [[Cheez Whiz]]\"; the second, in \"I Remember Larry\", said \"Wow, you must have an awful lot of free time on your hands.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/faq/#secret|title=Al-oholics Anonymous' Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=August 24, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060829151229/http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/faq/| archivedate= August 29, 2006<!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref>\n\n=== Music videos ===\nWhile Yankovic's musical parodies generally do not include references to the songs or the artists of the original songs, Yankovic's music videos will sometimes parody the original song's music video in whole or in part.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/23/5926693/the-8-most-best-weird-al-parodies-video | title = The 8 best Weird Al parody videos | publisher = [[The Verge]] | date = July 23, 2014 | accessdate = July 25, 2014 }}</ref> Most notably, the video for \"[[Smells Like Nirvana]]\" uses an extremely similar set to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]\", including using several of the same actors.

[[Dr. Demento]] appeared in several of Yankovic's earlier videos, such as \"[[I Love Rocky Road]]\" and \"[[Ricky (song)|Ricky]]\". Actor [[Dick Van Patten]] is featured in both \"Smells Like Nirvana\" and \"[[Bedrock Anthem]]\"; [[Drew Carey]], [[Emo Philips]] and [[Phil LaMarr]] appeared in \"It's All About the Pentiums\"; [[Keegan-Michael Key]], [[Jordan Peele]], [[Donny Osmond]], [[Judy Tenuta]] and [[Seth Green]] appeared in \"White & Nerdy\"; and [[Ruth Buzzi]] and [[Pat Boone]] appeared in \"Gump\". The video for \"[[I Lost on Jeopardy]]\" includes an appearance by [[Greg Kihn]], the artist whose song, \"Jeopardy\", was being parodied, along with [[Don Pardo]] and [[Art Fleming]], Jeopardy's original announcer and host, as themselves. [[Florence Henderson]] plays an Amish seductress in \"Amish Paradise\".\n\nWhile most videos that Yankovic creates are aired on music channels such as MTV and [[VH1]], Yankovic worked with animation artists to create music videos for release with extended content albums. The [[DualDisc]] version of ''Straight Outta Lynwood'' features six videos set to songs from the release, including videos created by [[Bill Plympton]] and [[John Kricfalusi]]; one video, \"Weasel Stomping Day\" was created by the producers of the show ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', and aired as a segment of that program. For the 2010 ''Alpocalypse'', Yankovic produced videos for every song; four of those were previously released for each of the songs on the EP ''[[Internet Leaks]]'', with the videos for the remaining songs released via social media sites and included in the deluxe edition of ''Alpocalypse''. These live-action and animated videos were produced by both previous collaborators such as Plympton for \"TMZ\",<ref name=\"coedmag plympton\"/> video content providers like [[Jib-Jab]] and [[SuperNews!]], and other directors and animators.\n\nTo help promote his 2014 album ''Mandatory Fun'' in social media circles, Yankovic produced eight music videos for the album releasing them over eight consecutive days with release of the album, believing it \"would make an impact because people would be talking about the album all week long\".<ref name=\"foxnews 8days\">{{cite web | url = http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/07/18/weird-al-yankovic-adapint-to-digital-age/ | title = Weird Al Yankovic adapting to digital age | first = Ashley | last = Dvohrik | date = July 18, 2014 | accessdate = July 19, 2014 | publisher = [[Fox News]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://time.com/2949882/weird-al-yankovic-not-that-weird/ | title = The Al Yankovic Paradox: He Doesn't Seem That Weird Anymore | first = Lily | last = Rothman | date = July 2, 2014 | accessdate = July 2, 2014 | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] }}</ref> RCA Records opted not to fund production of any of these videos, and Yankovic turned to various social media portals including [[Funny or Die]] and [[CollegeHumor]] which he had worked with in the past; these sites helped to cover the production cost of the videos with Yankovic foregoing any ad video revenue.

The show had a troubled production due to this requirement and the desire by CBS to follow in the success of ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'', leading to the show's cancellation after one 13-episode season.

Also, [[Coolio]]'s later disapproval of \"[[Amish Paradise]]\" was played up as a large feud. Much was also made over his apparent lack of a love life, though he got married shortly after the program aired. The episode was updated and re-released in early 2012 as part of the \"Behind the Music Remastered\" series.\n\nYankovic performed at the [[66th Primetime Emmy Awards]] singing a comedic medley of songs based on the themes of several Emmy-nominated shows such as ''[[Mad Men]]'' and ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.vulture.com/2014/08/watch-weird-al-emmys-tv-theme-song-medley.html | title = Watch Weird Al's Emmys TV Theme-Song Medley | first = Gilbert | last = Cruz | date = August 25, 2014 | accessdate=  August 25, 2014 | work = [[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]] }}</ref>\n\n=== Animation and voice work ===\nYankovic has done voice-overs for several animated series.

DASHBot-->}}</ref> His works have earned him five [[Grammy Award]]s and a further eleven nominations, four [[RIAA certification|gold records]], and six [[RIAA certification|platinum records]] in the United States. Yankovic's first top ten ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' album (''[[Straight Outta Lynwood]]'') and single (\"[[White & Nerdy]]\") were both released in 2006, nearly three decades into his career. His latest album, ''[[Mandatory Fun]]'' (2014), became his first number-one album during its debut week.\n\nYankovic's success comes in part from his effective use of music video to further parody popular culture, the song's original artist, and the original music videos themselves, scene-for-scene in some cases. He directed later videos himself and went on to direct for other artists, including [[Ben Folds]], [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]], [[The Black Crowes]], and [[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|The Presidents of the United States of America]]. With the decline of [[music television]] and the onset of [[social media]], Yankovic used [[YouTube]] and other video sites to publish his videos; this strategy proved integral, helping to boost sales of his later albums, including ''Mandatory Fun''.

Yankovic had been called \"Weird Al\" originally as a more derogatory nickname from others within the dormitory he shared, as he was seen at the strange outcast compared to other residents.<Ref name=\"nytimes apr2020\"/> Though he initially took it as an insult, Yankovic eventually \"took it on professionally\" as his persona for the station.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> In 1978, he released his first recording (as Alfred Yankovic), \"Take Me Down\", on the LP, ''Slo Grown'', as a benefit for the Economic Opportunity Commission of [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo County]]. The song mocked famous nearby landmarks such as [[Bubblegum Alley]] and the fountain toilets at the [[Madonna Inn]].\n\nIn mid-1979, shortly before his senior year, \"[[My Sharona]]\" by [[The Knack]] was on the charts and Yankovic took his accordion into the restroom across the hall from the radio station to take advantage of the [[echo chamber]] acoustics and recorded a parody titled \"[[My Bologna]]\".<ref name= takingoff/> He sent it to Dr. Demento, who played it to good response from listeners.  Yankovic met The Knack after a show at his college and introduced himself as the author of \"My Bologna\". The Knack's lead singer, [[Doug Fieger]], said he liked the song and suggested that [[Capitol Records]] vice president [[Rupert Perry]] release it as a single.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> \"My Bologna\" was released as a single with \"School Cafeteria\" as its B-side, and the label gave Yankovic a six-month recording contract.  Yankovic, who was \"only getting average grades\" in his architecture degree, began to realize that he might make a career of comedic music.<ref name=\"booklet\"/>\n\nOn September 14, 1980, Yankovic was a guest on the ''Dr. Demento Show'', where he was to record a new parody live. The song was called \"[[Another One Rides the Bus]]\", a parody of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s hit, \"[[Another One Bites the Dust]]\". While practicing the song outside the sound booth, he met [[Jon Schwartz (drummer)|Jon \"Bermuda\" Schwartz]], who told him he was a drummer and agreed to bang on Yankovic's accordion case to help Yankovic keep a steady beat during the song. They rehearsed the song just a few times before the show began.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> \"Another One Rides the Bus\" became so popular that Yankovic's first television appearance was a performance of the song on ''[[Tomorrow (TV series)|The Tomorrow Show]]'' (April 21, 1981) with [[Tom Snyder]].<ref>{{cite document |title=TV Listings, Tuesday, April 21 |work=The Baltimore Sun |date=April 19, 1981 |page=TV24 |id={{ProQuest|535950110}} }}</ref> On the show, Yankovic played his accordion, and again, Schwartz banged on the accordion case and provided comical sound effects.

His stage act in a [[Phoenix, Arizona]], nightclub caught the eye of manager Jay Levey, who was \"blown away\".<ref name=\"booklet\"/> Levey asked Yankovic if he had considered creating a full band and doing his music as a career. Yankovic admitted that he had, so Levey held auditions. [[Steve Jay]] became Yankovic's bass player, and Jay's friend [[Jim West (guitarist)|Jim West]] played guitar. Schwartz continued on drums. Yankovic's first show with his new band was on March 31, 1982.<ref name=\"livepage\"/>  Several days later, Yankovic and his band were the opening act for [[Missing Persons (band)|Missing Persons]].\n\nYankovic recorded \"[[I Love Rocky Road]]\", (a parody of \"[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]\" originally recorded by [[Arrows (British band)|The Arrows]]) which was produced by [[Rick Derringer]], in 1982. The song was a hit on Top 40 radio, leading to Yankovic's signing with [[Scotti Brothers Records]]. In 1983, Yankovic's first [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic (album)|self-titled album]] was released on Scotti Bros. The song \"[[Ricky (song)|Ricky]]\" was released as a single and the music video received exposure on the still-young [[MTV]]. \"Ricky\" broke the top 100 videos on MTV at the time, which Yankovic took as a sign that his career was in music, quitting his job as a mailroom clerk at the local offices of [[Westwood One (1976-2011)|Westwood One]] to pursue the music career.<ref name=\"wapost feb2017\"/>\n\nYankovic released his second album ''[[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic in 3-D]]'' in 1984. The first single \"[[Eat It]]\", a parody of the [[Michael Jackson]] song \"[[Beat It]]\", became popular, thanks in part to the music video, a shot-for-shot parody of Jackson's \"Beat It\" music video, and what Yankovic sarcastically described as his \"uncanny resemblance\" to Jackson. \"Eat It\" was also aided by the first of Yankovic's ''[[Al TV]]'' specials that aired on [[MTV]] on April 1, 1984, the network looking to Yankovic's rising popularity to help fill its programming time.<Ref name=\"nytimes apr2020\"/> Peaking at No.  12 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] on April 14, 1984,<ref>{{cite web |title=Eat It \u2013 Weird Al Yankovic |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=weird al yankovic|chart=all}} |work=Billboard}}</ref> \"Eat It\" remained Yankovic's highest-charting single until \"[[White & Nerdy]]\" placed at No.  9 in October 2006.<ref>{{cite news |title=White & Nerdy |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=weird al yankovic|chart=all}} |work=Billboard}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, Yankovic co-wrote and starred in a [[mockumentary]] of his own life titled ''[[The Compleat Al]]'' (the title being a parody of the 1982 documentary ''[[The Compleat Beatles]]''), which intertwined the facts of his life up to that point with fiction. The movie also featured some clips from Yankovic's trip to Japan and some clips from the ''[[Al TV]]'' specials. ''The Compleat Al'' was co-directed by Jay Levey, who would direct ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' four years later.

Soon afterwards, Gaga's manager admitted that he had denied the parody of his own accord without forwarding the song to his client, and upon seeing it online, Lady Gaga granted permission for the parody. Yankovic has stated that all of his proceeds from the parody and its music video will be donated to the [[Human Rights Campaign]], to support the human rights themes of the original song.<ref name=\"Gaga Parody Permission\">{{cite web|url=http://alyankovic.wordpress.com/the-gaga-saga/ |title=The Gaga Saga |accessdate=April 20, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y61XzOga?url=http://alyankovic.wordpress.com/the-gaga-saga/ |archivedate=April 20, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref><ref name=\"Gaga Parody Update\">{{cite web |url=http://alyankovic.wordpress.com/2011/04/20/gaga-update/ |title=Gaga Update |accessdate=April 20, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110426031039/http://alyankovic.wordpress.com/2011/04/20/gaga-update/| archivedate= April 26, 2011<!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref> Yankovic was also a judge for the 10th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/pastjudges.asp |title=Past Judges |publisher=Independent Music Awards |accessdate=October 26, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110724134001/http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/pastjudges.asp| archivedate= July 24, 2011<!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref>\n\nYankovic stated in September 2013 that he was working on a new album, but gave no details.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Weird Al Yankovic \u2013 I'm Droppin' a NEW ALBUM!  | date = September 30, 2013  | website = [[TMZ.com]]  | url = http://www.tmz.com/2013/09/30/weird-al-yankovic-new-album-music-recording/  | accessdate = March 20, 2014}}</ref> In 2014, he used social media websites to hint at a July 15 release of this new album, as noted by ''Rolling Stone''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/weird-al-yankovic-returning-with-new-album-this-summer-20140615 |  title = 'Weird Al' Yankovic Returning With New Album This Summer | first = Miriam | last = Coleman | date = June 15, 2014 | accessdate = June 16, 2014 | work = [[Rolling Stone]] }}</ref> The album artwork and title, ''[[Mandatory Fun]]'', were affirmed by his publisher.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rcarecordspress.com/artist/weird-al-yankovic | title = \"Weird Al\" Yankovic | publisher = [[RCA Records]] | accessdate = June 16, 2014 }}</ref> Yankovic said in an interview promoting the album that, with the end of his recording contract, it is likely his last traditional album, in the sense of recording and releasing that many songs at a time; he said he will likely switch to releasing singles and EPs over the Internet, a method which offers more immediate release opportunities as Yankovic considers his parodies in particular as something that can become dated by the time of release.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Keith|first1=Tamara|title='Weird Al' Yankovic On Parody In The Age Of YouTube|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/07/12/329873481/weird-al-yankovic-on-parody-in-the-age-of-youtube|accessdate=July 15, 2014|work=Weekend Edition|publisher=NPR|date=July 12, 2014}}</ref> ''Mandatory Fun'' was released to strong critical praise and was the No. 1 debut album on the ''Billboard'' charts the week of its release, buoyed by Yankovic's approach for releasing eight music videos over eight continuous days that drew viral attention to the album as described below.<ref name=\"billboardnews\"/> It became Yankovic's first No. 1 album in his career.

He says that some songs have taken him weeks to compose the lyrics to as he permeates the various choices, sometimes entering a \"zombie phase\" as he mulls these over in his home. For example, Yankovic believes he could have written a completely different version of \"White & Nerdy\" based on the alternative choices of lyrics he had come up with and had discarded for the final song. He has also done significant research for other song parodies to get facts and keywords for certain areas of knowledge, such as for \"I Think I'm a Clone Now\" or hospitals for \"Like a Surgeon\".

A number of songs use the phrase \"internal organs\". Also, a [[hamster]] called [[Harvey the Wonder Hamster]] is a recurring character in ''[[The Weird Al Show]]'' and the ''Al TV'' specials, as well as the subject of an original song on ''[[Alapalooza]]''. Other recurring jokes include Yankovic borrowing, or being owed, $5. In a number of ''Al TV'' interviews, he often asks if he can borrow $5, being turned down every time. This motif also occurs in \"[[Poodle Hat|Why Does This Always Happen to Me?]]\", in which his deceased friend owes him $5. Another recurring joke is his attraction to female nostrils or nostrils in general. This also appears in numerous ''Al TV'' interviews as well as in several of his songs (\"[[Albuquerque (song)|Albuquerque]]\" and \"[[Poodle Hat|Wanna B Ur Lovr]]\" to name a few.) Yankovic also asks his celebrity guests if they could \"shave his back for a nickel.\" This also appears in the song \"[[Albuquerque (song)|Albuquerque]]\". Yankovic has also put two [[backmasking]] messages into his songs. The first, in \"Nature Trail to Hell\", said \"Satan Eats [[Cheez Whiz]]\"; the second, in \"I Remember Larry\", said \"Wow, you must have an awful lot of free time on your hands.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/faq/#secret|title=Al-oholics Anonymous' Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=August 24, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060829151229/http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/faq/| archivedate= August 29, 2006<!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref>\n\n=== Music videos ===\nWhile Yankovic's musical parodies generally do not include references to the songs or the artists of the original songs, Yankovic's music videos will sometimes parody the original song's music video in whole or in part.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/23/5926693/the-8-most-best-weird-al-parodies-video | title = The 8 best Weird Al parody videos | publisher = [[The Verge]] | date = July 23, 2014 | accessdate = July 25, 2014 }}</ref> Most notably, the video for \"[[Smells Like Nirvana]]\" uses an extremely similar set to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]\", including using several of the same actors.

[[Dr. Demento]] appeared in several of Yankovic's earlier videos, such as \"[[I Love Rocky Road]]\" and \"[[Ricky (song)|Ricky]]\". Actor [[Dick Van Patten]] is featured in both \"Smells Like Nirvana\" and \"[[Bedrock Anthem]]\"; [[Drew Carey]], [[Emo Philips]] and [[Phil LaMarr]] appeared in \"It's All About the Pentiums\"; [[Keegan-Michael Key]], [[Jordan Peele]], [[Donny Osmond]], [[Judy Tenuta]] and [[Seth Green]] appeared in \"White & Nerdy\"; and [[Ruth Buzzi]] and [[Pat Boone]] appeared in \"Gump\". The video for \"[[I Lost on Jeopardy]]\" includes an appearance by [[Greg Kihn]], the artist whose song, \"Jeopardy\", was being parodied, along with [[Don Pardo]] and [[Art Fleming]], Jeopardy's original announcer and host, as themselves. [[Florence Henderson]] plays an Amish seductress in \"Amish Paradise\".\n\nWhile most videos that Yankovic creates are aired on music channels such as MTV and [[VH1]], Yankovic worked with animation artists to create music videos for release with extended content albums. The [[DualDisc]] version of ''Straight Outta Lynwood'' features six videos set to songs from the release, including videos created by [[Bill Plympton]] and [[John Kricfalusi]]; one video, \"Weasel Stomping Day\" was created by the producers of the show ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', and aired as a segment of that program. For the 2010 ''Alpocalypse'', Yankovic produced videos for every song; four of those were previously released for each of the songs on the EP ''[[Internet Leaks]]'', with the videos for the remaining songs released via social media sites and included in the deluxe edition of ''Alpocalypse''. These live-action and animated videos were produced by both previous collaborators such as Plympton for \"TMZ\",<ref name=\"coedmag plympton\"/> video content providers like [[Jib-Jab]] and [[SuperNews!]], and other directors and animators.\n\nTo help promote his 2014 album ''Mandatory Fun'' in social media circles, Yankovic produced eight music videos for the album releasing them over eight consecutive days with release of the album, believing it \"would make an impact because people would be talking about the album all week long\".<ref name=\"foxnews 8days\">{{cite web | url = http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/07/18/weird-al-yankovic-adapint-to-digital-age/ | title = Weird Al Yankovic adapting to digital age | first = Ashley | last = Dvohrik | date = July 18, 2014 | accessdate = July 19, 2014 | publisher = [[Fox News]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://time.com/2949882/weird-al-yankovic-not-that-weird/ | title = The Al Yankovic Paradox: He Doesn't Seem That Weird Anymore | first = Lily | last = Rothman | date = July 2, 2014 | accessdate = July 2, 2014 | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] }}</ref> RCA Records opted not to fund production of any of these videos, and Yankovic turned to various social media portals including [[Funny or Die]] and [[CollegeHumor]] which he had worked with in the past; these sites helped to cover the production cost of the videos with Yankovic foregoing any ad video revenue.

It was designed to be part of CBS's mandated [[E/I|Educational or Informative]] programming to teach children morals. The show had a troubled production due to this requirement and the desire by CBS to follow in the success of ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'', leading to the show's cancellation after one 13-episode season.

His two commercial failures (his film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' and his 1986 album ''[[Polka Party!]]'') were presented as having a larger impact on the direction of his career than they really had. Also, [[Coolio]]'s later disapproval of \"[[Amish Paradise]]\" was played up as a large feud.

Flores Camargo moves large quantities of high grade marijuana and cocaine through the I-75 corridor for distribution in Detroit, supplying the city and its outskirts and suburbs. The local authorities haven't been able to dismantle this trafficking group because of its experience. They have made several arrests but have never been able to locate Flores Camago's heads. It is known that two cousins originally from the Mexican state of Guanajuato run it, but no photos or names have been obtained by authorities. This shows how trafficking groups are becoming more cunning in hiding from federal authorities. The federal authorities have known that the group smuggles high grade marijuana and cocaine from Guanajuato, traveling up to the border and passing under secret tunnels. DEA agents have received tips saying the groups move up to 2 tons of high grade marijuana to a central hub in Atlanta, then up through I75 to Detroit where it is repackaged into small quantities and spread throughout the city. The money is never tracked because no bank accounts are used. This group is known to have military style weapons obtained from their cartel connections in the United States and Mexico. They show off their luxury life on social networks but the authorities don't have any evidence to arrest the two cousins or other known associates.\n\n===Knights Templar===\nThe alleged death of [[Nazario Moreno Gonz\u00e1lez]] on December 9, 2010 led to a split among cartel leaders [[Jos\u00e9 de Jes\u00fas M\u00e9ndez Vargas]], [[Enrique Plancarte Sol\u00eds]], and [[Servando G\u00f3mez Mart\u00ednez]].

The investigative efforts in Project Coronado were coordinated by the multi-agency Special Operations Division, comprising agents and analysts from the DEA, FBI, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Marshals Service and [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]], as well as attorneys from the Criminal Division's Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section.

Outside of the United States, the operation resulted in the arrest of more than 1,900 members.

Flores Camargo moves large quantities of high grade marijuana and cocaine through the I-75 corridor for distribution in Detroit, supplying the city and its outskirts and suburbs. The local authorities haven't been able to dismantle this trafficking group because of its experience. They have made several arrests but have never been able to locate Flores Camago's heads. It is known that two cousins originally from the Mexican state of Guanajuato run it, but no photos or names have been obtained by authorities. This shows how trafficking groups are becoming more cunning in hiding from federal authorities. The federal authorities have known that the group smuggles high grade marijuana and cocaine from Guanajuato, traveling up to the border and passing under secret tunnels. DEA agents have received tips saying the groups move up to 2 tons of high grade marijuana to a central hub in Atlanta, then up through I75 to Detroit where it is repackaged into small quantities and spread throughout the city. The money is never tracked because no bank accounts are used. This group is known to have military style weapons obtained from their cartel connections in the United States and Mexico. They show off their luxury life on social networks but the authorities don't have any evidence to arrest the two cousins or other known associates.\n\n===Knights Templar===\nThe alleged death of [[Nazario Moreno Gonz\u00e1lez]] on December 9, 2010 led to a split among cartel leaders [[Jos\u00e9 de Jes\u00fas M\u00e9ndez Vargas]], [[Enrique Plancarte Sol\u00eds]], and [[Servando G\u00f3mez Mart\u00ednez]]. A large part of La Familia Michoacana left with Plancarte and Gomez to form the [[Knights Templar (gang)|Knights Templar]] cartel, while Jes\u00fas M\u00e9ndez kept the leadership of the formerly disbanded La Familia Michoacana.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mexico|Law}}\n* [[List of Mexico's 37 most-wanted drug lords]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Mexican Drug War}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Familia Michoacana (drug cartel), La}}\n[[Category:Disbanded Mexican drug cartels]]\n[[Category:Gangs in Mexico]]\n[[Category:History of Michoac\u00e1n]]\n[[Category:MS-13]]\n[[Category:Terrorism in Mexico]]\n", "name_user": "BabsEverAfter", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Familia_Michoacana"}

Both men were former convicted criminals who became professional boxers, and whose birthdates were a mystery.\n \nDepending on your source, Robert \"Bobby\" Halpern was born on April 25, 1933 or May 31, 1931 or March 31, 1933. Boxrec lists Halpern's birthdate as April 25, 1933. Halpern grew up in the Bronx, New York. He was half Jewish and half Irish (His mother was Irish and his father was Jewish).\n\nDuring his professional boxing career, Halpern wore a Star of David on his boxing trunks. It's unknown if he followed the Jewish faith.\n\nHalpern grew up on Arthur Avenue in the Bronx. In the 1930s and 1940s this was an Italian neighborhood. Halpern joined a street gang and was involved in street fights and gang brawls. After being in and out of trouble, Halpern discovered a local gym and started to train to become an amateur boxer.\n\nAfter racking up an impressive winning streak, the 15-year-old Halpern entered and won the 1948 New Jersey Diamond Gloves. Over the next five years, he compiled a record of 200 wins and 10 defeats.\n\nHalpern's boxing career was sidetracked by his criminal activities. At 20, he was convicted of armed robbery and served a 4-year prison term at Elmira Prison.\n\nAfter reading the autobiography of Heavyweight Champion [[Floyd Patterson]] Victory Over Myself, while in prison, Halpern decided on becoming a professional boxer.\n\nAfter his release from prison, Halpern became a professional fighter in 1958, and won two fights to earn a match with undefeated heavyweight prospect \"Irish\" [[Tom McNeeley]] on December 19, 1958 in New York. Halpern lost the fight by decision. McNeeley would later fight [[Floyd Patterson]] for the World's Heavyweight Championship.\n\nHowever, Halpern became involved with a kidnapping and an armed robbery. He was convicted and sentenced to 20 years to life. His prospect of ever becoming world heavyweight boxing champion ended. It appeared that he would spend the rest of his life in prison. Halpern however kept the dream of a professional boxing career in his head. He trained in prison, jumped rope, ran, and used the prison gym. He served in three of the most infamous New York prisons, [[Sing Sing]], [[Attica]], and [[Clinton Correctional Facility|Dannemora]]. He was involved in numerous prison fights, and his face and body bore the scars of 17 years behind bars.\n\nHalpern was released from prison in 1975 at age 42. He hadn't fought in 17 years, yet he was determined to fight again.\n\nHe earned the nickname, \"The Hebrew Hammer\" in his first comeback fight on November 10, 1976, after he knocked out 260 pound Terry Lee Kidd with one punch. However, 14 days later, Halpern was knocked out in two rounds by\nfuture World Heavyweight Champion [[Trevor Berbick]]. Berbick would be the last fighter to defeat [[Muhammad Ali]].\n\nAt 5 feet 10 inches and 185 pounds, Halpern was small for a heavyweight. Yet, he was surprising fast for a man in his 40s, and used a crouching style of fighting. He also had one punch knockout ability.\n\nHalpern racked seven consecutive victories, 6 by knockout. His knockouts over Freddy McKay  (KO 3) and \"Diego\" Joe Roberson (KO 7) were featured in [[Sports Illustrated]]. His comeback caught the attention of the media and Halpern became a national sensation. He appeared on television, in magazines, and on the radio. The [[Ring Magazine]]wrote about his amazing comeback at age 43.\n\nOutside of the ring, Halpern displayed a bad temper. He was accused of Domestict Violence by Antonia Maria Melendez, his fiance and girlfriend. She accused him knocking out 6 of her teeth and breaking her leg. The case against Halpern was dismissed on May 1, 1978, when Melendez failed to show up to court.\n\nMadison Square Garden billed Halpern in their main-event on May 15, 1978 in New York City. The eyes of the nation were on this match, and there was talk that if Halpern won, he would fight World Heavyweight Champion [[Leon Spinks]] for the title. Halpern was favored against Guy  \"The Rock\" Casale, but suffered a one punch knockout defeat in the third round; crushing his hopes for a heavyweight title fight.\n\nTaking the loss in stride, Halpern fought two exhibitions and was scheduled for a 10 round fight against Dave Dittmore in June. However, while shopping for clothes at a Bronx store, two armed men approached Halpern and shot him with shotguns. A badly injured Halpern was hospitalized with a severe wound to his hand. The hand injury would end Halpern's career.\n\nA few months later, Halpern's ex-fiance, Antonia Maria Melendez was arrested and charged with hiring two hit-men to murder Halpern.\n\nWith his ring career over, Halpern's life was a series of ups and downs. He advertised auto parts in New York and worked as a cornerman. He was arrested on a number of occasions for such charges as conspiring to murder, and weapons charges.\n\nHe was rumored to have died in 2002, but appeared in public at a Youth Boxing Program in the summer of 2003 in his old Bronx neighborhood.\n\nHalpern's last public appearance was in May 2008. A boxing reunion at Ring 8 in New York City reunited Halpern with his former ring rival Guy \"The Rock\" Casale. At 75, Halpern appeared to be in good health and clear minded. A short documentary on his life \"Street Animal\" by Doug Harden can be viewed on YouTube. The feature screenplay, \"The Third Round\", written by Ben Fiore and Bobby's ring rival, Guy 'The Rock' Casale, features segments of Bobby's life and career and centers upon their big fight at Madison Square Garden in 1978. (See: www.facebook.com/thethirdround.)\n\nBobby Halpern out-lived his siblings and died on February 8, 2015.\n\n==Professional boxing record==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Result\n!scope=\"col\"|Record\n!scope=\"col\"|Opponent\n!scope=\"col\"|Method\n!scope=\"col\"|Date\n!scope=\"col\"|Round\n!scope=\"col\"|Time\n!scope=\"col\"|Event\n!scope=\"col\"|Location\n!scope=\"col\"|Notes\n|-\n| {{no2|Loss}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|10-4-0\n|{{flagicon|USA}}Guy \"Rock\" Casale\n|KO\n|1978 May 15\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|\n|[[New York City|New York]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n|\n|-\n| {{yes2|Win}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|10-3-0\n|{{flagicon|USA}}John Kane\n|TKO\n|1978 Apr 05\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|\n|[[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n|\n|-\n| {{no2|Loss}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|9-3-0\n|{{flagicon|USA}}John Kane\n|TKO\n|1978 Feb 23\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|\n|[[North Bergen]], [[New Jersey]]\n|\n|-\n| {{yes2|Win}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|9-2-0\n|{{flagicon|USA}}Johnny Blaine\n|KO\n|1978 Jan 18\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|\n|[[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n|\n|-\n| {{yes2|Win}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8-2-0\n|{{flagicon|USA}}Diego Joe Roberson\n|KO\n|1977 Nov 09\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|7\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|\n|[[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n|\n|-\n| {{yes2|Win}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|7-2-0\n|{{flagicon|USA}}Freddy McKay\n|KO\n|1977\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|\n|[[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n|Source: [[Sports Illustrated]]\n|-\n| {{yes2|Win}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|6-2-0\n|{{flagicon|USA}}Johnny Blaine\n|KO\n|1977 Sep 09\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|\n|[[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n|\n|-\n| {{yes2|Win}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|5-2-0\n|{{flagicon|USA}}Diego Joe Roberson\n|KO\n|1977 Jun 24 \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|\n|[[Nanuet]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n|\n|-\n| {{yes2|Win}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4-2-0\n|{{flagicon|USA}}David Conteh\n|PTS\n|1977 Apr 19\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|\n|[[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n|\n|-\n| {{no2|Loss}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3-2-0\n|{{flagicon|Jamaica}}[[Trevor Berbick]]\n|KO\n|1977 Nov 23\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|\n|[[Halifax (former city)|Halifax]], [[Canada]]\n|\n|-\n| {{yes2|Win}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3-1-0\n|{{flagicon|USA}}Terry Lee Kidd\n|KO\n|1977 Nov 10\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|\n|[[South Orange]], [[New Jersey]]\n|\n|-\n| {{no2|Loss}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2-1-0\n|{{flagicon|USA}}[[Tom McNeeley]]\n|PTS \n|1958 Dec 19\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|\n|[[New York City|New York]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n|\n|-\n| {{yes2|Win}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2-0-0\n|{{flagicon|USA}}Henry Wallitsch\n|PTS\n|1958 \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|\n|[[New York City|New York]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n|\n|-\n| {{yes2|Win}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1-0-0\n|{{flagicon|USA}}Atillo Tondo\n|PTS\n|1958 Nov 17\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|\n|[[New York City|New York]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n|\n|}\n\n===Sources===\n\n*www.Jewsinsports.org. \n*The End of An Era for New York Boxing, May 12, 2005, by Mitch Abramson. \n*Spitbucket News, June 14, 2003: YOUTH BOXING TAKES CENTER STAGE IN THE BRONX. \n*Jewish Sports Review, September/October 2001, Volume 3, Number 1, issue 25. \n*[[New York Times]], October 21, 1992: BUT THE FIGHTER STILL REMAINS IN BELMONT;

A short documentary on his life \"Street Animal\" by Doug Harden can be viewed on YouTube. The feature screenplay, \"The Third Round\", written by Ben Fiore and Bobby's ring rival, Guy 'The Rock' Casale, features segments of Bobby's life and career and centers upon their big fight at Madison Square Garden in 1978. (See: www.facebook.com/thethirdround.)\n\nBobby Halpern out-lived his siblings and died on February 8, 2015.\n\n==Professional boxing record==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Result\n!scope=\"col\"|Record\n!scope=\"col\"|Opponent\n!scope=\"col\"|Method\n!scope=\"col\"|Date\n!scope=\"col\"|Round\n!scope=\"col\"|Time\n!scope=\"col\"|Event\n!scope=\"col\"|Location\n!scope=\"col\"|Notes\n|-\n| {{no2|Loss}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|10-4-0\n|{{flagicon|USA}}Guy \"Rock\" Casale\n|KO\n|1978 May 15\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|\n|[[New York City|New York]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n|\n|-\n| {{yes2|Win}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|10-3-0\n|{{flagicon|USA}}John Kane\n|TKO\n|1978 Apr 05\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|\n|[[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n|\n|-\n| {{no2|Loss}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|9-3-0\n|{{flagicon|USA}}John Kane\n|TKO\n|1978 Feb 23\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|\n|[[North Bergen]], [[New Jersey]]\n|\n|-\n| {{yes2|Win}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|9-2-0\n|{{flagicon|USA}}Johnny Blaine\n|KO\n|1978 Jan 18\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|\n|[[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n|\n|-\n| {{yes2|Win}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8-2-0\n|{{flagicon|USA}}Diego Joe Roberson\n|KO\n|1977 Nov 09\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|7\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|\n|[[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n|\n|-\n| {{yes2|Win}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|7-2-0\n|{{flagicon|USA}}Freddy McKay\n|KO\n|1977\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|\n|[[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n|Source: [[Sports Illustrated]]\n|-\n| {{yes2|Win}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|6-2-0\n|{{flagicon|USA}}Johnny Blaine\n|KO\n|1977 Sep 09\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|\n|[[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n|\n|-\n| {{yes2|Win}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|5-2-0\n|{{flagicon|USA}}Diego Joe Roberson\n|KO\n|1977 Jun 24 \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|\n|[[Nanuet]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n|\n|-\n| {{yes2|Win}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4-2-0\n|{{flagicon|USA}}David Conteh\n|PTS\n|1977 Apr 19\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|\n|[[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n|\n|-\n| {{no2|Loss}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3-2-0\n|{{flagicon|Jamaica}}[[Trevor Berbick]]\n|KO\n|1977 Nov 23\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|\n|[[Halifax (former city)|Halifax]], [[Canada]]\n|\n|-\n| {{yes2|Win}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3-1-0\n|{{flagicon|USA}}Terry Lee Kidd\n|KO\n|1977 Nov 10\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|\n|[[South Orange]], [[New Jersey]]\n|\n|-\n| {{no2|Loss}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2-1-0\n|{{flagicon|USA}}[[Tom McNeeley]]\n|PTS \n|1958 Dec 19\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|\n|[[New York City|New York]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n|\n|-\n| {{yes2|Win}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2-0-0\n|{{flagicon|USA}}Henry Wallitsch\n|PTS\n|1958 \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|\n|[[New York City|New York]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n|\n|-\n| {{yes2|Win}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1-0-0\n|{{flagicon|USA}}Atillo Tondo\n|PTS\n|1958 Nov 17\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|\n|[[New York City|New York]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n|\n|}\n\n===Sources===\n\n*www.Jewsinsports.org. \n*The End of An Era for New York Boxing, May 12, 2005, by Mitch Abramson. \n*Spitbucket News, June 14, 2003: YOUTH BOXING TAKES CENTER STAGE IN THE BRONX. \n*Jewish Sports Review, September/October 2001, Volume 3, Number 1, issue 25. \n*[[New York Times]], October 21, 1992: BUT THE FIGHTER STILL REMAINS IN BELMONT;

{"title_page": "Paschasius Radbertus", "text_new": "[[Saint]] '''Paschasius Radbertus''' (785\u2013865) was a [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian]] theologian and the abbot of [[Corbie Abbey|Corbie]], a monastery in [[Picardy]] founded in 657 or 660 by the queen regent [[Bathilde]]  with a founding community of monks from [[Luxeuil Abbey]]. His most well-known and influential work is an exposition on the nature of the [[Eucharist]] written around 831, entitled ''De Corpore et Sanguine Domini''. \nHe was canonized in 1073 by [[Pope Gregory VII]]. His [[feast day]] is April 26. \nHis works are edited in ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' vol. 120 (1852) and his important tract on the Eucharist, ''De Corpore et Sanguine Domini'', in a 1969 edition by B. Paulus, published by Brepols (Corpus Christianorum, Continuatio Mediaevalis 16).\n\n==Life==\nPaschasius was an orphan left on the steps of the convent of [[Notre-Dame de Soissons]].  He was raised by the nuns there, and became very fond of the abbess, Theodrara.  Theodrara was sister of [[Adalard of Corbie]] and [[Wala of Corbie]], two monks whom he admired greatly.  At a fairly young age, Paschasius left the convent to serve as a monk under Abbot Adalard, at [[Corbie]].  There he also met Wala, Adalard's brother and successor.<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia\"/>  \n\nThrough the abbotship of both Adalard and Wala, Paschasius focused on the monastic life, spending his time studying and teaching. In 822 he accompanied abbot Adalard into Saxony for the purpose of founding the monastery of [[Princely Abbey of Corvey|New Corvey]] in Westphalia. When Adalard died in 826, Paschasius helped ensure Wala would become Abbot in his place. After Wala's death in 836 Heddo became abbot. [[Ratramnus]], who may have held the position of teaching master,<ref>Ginther, pp. 155-6.</ref> held opposing views to Paschasius on a number of ecclesiastical issues. Ratramnus wrote a refutation of Paschasius' treatise on the Eucharist, ''De Corpore et Sanguine Domini'', using the same title.  \n\nIn 843 Paschasius succeeded Abbot Isaac, however he resigned his title ten years later to return to his studies.<ref>Cabaniss, pg. 2-3</ref>  He left Corbie for the nearby monastery of [[Saint-Riquier]], where he lived in voluntary exile for some years. Why he resigned is unknown, however it is likely that his actions were motivated by factional disputes within his monastic community; misunderstandings between himself and the younger monks were likely factors in his decision. \nHe returned to Corbie late in life, and resided in his old monastery until his death in 865.<ref>Matter, pg. 149</ref>\n\nPaschasius' body was first buried at the Church of St. John in Corbie.  After numerous reported miracles,  the Pope ordered his remains to be removed, and interred in the Church of St. Peter, Corbie.<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia\">Catholic Encyclopedia</ref>\n\n==Writings==\n\n===''De Corpore et Sanguine Domini''===\nThe most well-known and influential work of St. Paschasius, ''De Corpore et Sanguine Domini'' (written between 831 and 833), is an exposition on the nature of the [[Eucharist]]. It was originally written as an instructional manual for the monks under his care at Corbie, and is the first lengthy treatise on the sacrament of the Eucharist in the Western world.<ref>Zirkel, pg. 5</ref> In it, Paschasius agrees with [[Ambrose]] in affirming that the Eucharist contains the true, historical body of Jesus Christ. According to Paschasius, God is truth itself, and therefore, his words and actions must be true.  Christ's proclamation at the [[Last Supper]] that the bread and wine were his body and blood must be taken literally, since God is truth.<ref>Chazelle, pg. 9</ref>  He thus believes that the [[transubstantiation]] of the bread and wine offered in the Eucharist really occurs.  Only if the Eucharist is the actual body and blood of Christ can a Christian know it is salvific.<ref>Chazelle, pg. 10</ref>  \n\nPaschasius believed that the presence of the historical blood and body of Christ allows the partaker a real union with Jesus in a direct, personal, and physical union by joining a person's flesh with Christ's and Christ's flesh with his.<ref>Chazelle, pg. 10-11</ref>  To Paschasius, the Eucharist's transformation into the flesh and blood of Christ is possible because of the principle that God is truth;  God is able to manipulate nature, as he created it.<ref>Chazelle, pg. 12</ref> The book was given to [[Charles the Bald]], the Frankish king, as a present in 844, with the inclusion of a special introduction. The view Paschasius expressed in this work was met with some hostility; [[Ratramnus]] wrote a rebuttal by the same name, by order of [[Charles the Bald]], who did not agree with some of the views Paschasius held.  Ratramnus believed that the Eucharist was strictly metaphorical; he focused more on the relationship between faith and the newly emerging science. Shortly thereafter, a third monk joined the debate, [[Rabanus Maurus]], which initiated the Carolingian Eucharist Controversy.<ref>Chazelle, pg. 1</ref> Ultimately, however, the king accepted Paschasius' assertion, and the [[Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist|substantial presence of Christ in the Eucharist]] became the authoritative belief in the Roman Catholic faith.<ref>Zirkel, pg. 3</ref>\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-right: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#C0C0C0; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\" \n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"When I begin to think about [Adalard], I am inwardly affected by two contrary emotions, namely, grief, and joy.  The Apostle forbids us to mourn in such a situation, but my and our sudden desolation prevents us from rejoicing.\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | Paschasius Radbertus, ''Vita Adalhardi''\n|}\n\n===''Vitae Adalhardi et Walae''===\nWritten in 826 and 836, respectively, ''Vita Adalhardi'' and ''Vita Walae'' are spiritual biographies of Paschasius' role-models.  They are personal tributes, written for the memory of two fathers, and the patterns of life depicted in them are intended to be followed.<ref>Cabaniss, pg. 14</ref>\n\n''Vita Adalhardi'' is rather brief; it is a fairly conventional representation of a saint's life. However, the style that Paschasius uses is unique for the time in which it was written. Written in mourning for the loss of his friend, Paschasius compares Adalard to the painter [[Zeuxis]]. As described by [[Cicero]], artists study models to perfect their art; Zeuxis' challenge was to paint the woman, [[Helen of Troy]].  Paschasius states that just as Zeuxis studied forms in order to perfect his art, so too does Adalard in trying to reform the image of God in himself. In making this comparison, Paschasius was identified with being a [[humanistic]] writer of the Carolingian period, as he compared classic and ancient literature with contemporary literature.<ref>Appleby, pg. 1-2</ref> Paschasius depicts Adalard as a mirror image of Christ, emphasizing the elements of infinite love and descent into suffering.<ref>Appleby, pg. 7</ref>  He also parallels Adalard's role in the Church to that of a mother, which is a concept attributed to [[Cistercian]] spirituality in the 12th century, three hundred years after Paschasius' death.  The grief felt over the death of Adalard is extremely strong in the book \u2013 although Paschasius knows that suffering should give way to joy, as depicted by his forefathers, such as [[Jerome]], Paschasius' grief for the loss of his friend surpassed that of his literary models.  This style of writing is also not seen elsewhere prior to the 12th century.  Paschasius' justification of excess mourning is his most distinctive contribution to the tradition of consolation literature.<ref>Appleby, pg. 8-9</ref>\n\n''Vita Walae'' is much longer (about twice as long as ''Vita Adalhardi''), and is structured as a dialogue. In total, there are eight characters represented, presumably monks of Corbie.  These characters are given pseudonyms, probably nor with the intention of masking identities. It is more likely that these pseudonyms were employed to further support Paschasius' interpretation of Wala, as the names were taken from classical texts.<ref>Cabaniss, pg. 20</ref> Phrases and passages from a variety of sources are woven into the text ([[Acts of St. Sebastien]], [[The Book of Job]], various comedies of [[Terence]]). Although not displaying information about Wala, these additions reflect Paschasius' own beliefs and his skill at writing.<ref>Cabaniss, pg. 15</ref>  While ''Vita Adalhardi'' was written to be in part a funeral eulogy, ''Vita Walae'' was  written as a (fairly) accurate depiction of Wala.  Paschasius used sources in writing this biography, a handbook written by Wala, and treatises of the time, probably to show his own views through his depiction of Wala.<ref>Cabaniss, pg. 16</ref>\n\n===Other works===\nPaschasius has an extensive collection of works, including many [[exegeses]] on various books of the [[Bible]].  He wrote commentaries on the [[Gospel of Matthew]], [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]], and an exposition of [[Psalm 45]], which he dedicated to the nuns at St. Mary at Soissons.  ''De Partu Virginis'', written for his friend Emma, Abbess of St. Mary at Soissons and daughter of Theodrara, describes the lifestyle of nuns.  He also wrote a treatise, titled ''De Nativitae Sanctae Mariae'', regarding the nature of the [[Virgin Mary]] and the birth of [[Jesus Christ]]. Paschasius probably wrote much more, but none of it has survived through the centuries.<ref>Cabaniss, pg. 3</ref> Paschasius wrote a commentary on ''Revelation''.<ref>Brant James Pitre, Jesus and the Jewish Roots of Mary (p. 62).</ref>\n\n==Theological contributions==\n\n===Understanding of the human body===\nIn opposition to other [[Carolingian]] authors, Paschasius locates the ''[[Imago Dei]]'' (the \"Image of God\") in the whole human being \u2013 body as well as soul. This view is in alignment with that of the second-century [[Church Father]] [[Irenaeus]]. Irenaeus believed that Jesus was the physical embodiment of God; the son is the image of the father. As such, humans represent the image of God not only in soul, but in flesh as well. This view is in opposition to the more accepted view of [[Origen of Alexandria]], who believed that the physical body had no part in the image-relationship.<ref>Appleby, pg. 14</ref> Unlike other theologians of the time, Paschasius does not equate the [[sanctification]] process with a metaphysical detachment of the body and the soul. Instead, he believes that the [[human condition]] (existing in a physical form) can contribute positively to achieving sanctification. However, he did believe in a form of mitigated dualism, in which the soul plays a larger part in the process than the body.<ref>Appleby, pg.15</ref> Paschasius believes that life is an opportunity to practice for death; however, the concept that the body is a prison for the soul is practically non-existent in his work, and probably only occurs due to pressure from his peers. Even though he believed that the body has a role in one's sanctification process, he also acknowledged that flesh struggles against God, and thus has the ability to be corrupted.<ref>Appleby, pg. 17</ref>\n\n===Understanding of Christ's body===\nPaschasius believes in a distinction between ''veritas'' (truth) and ''figura'' (form, or appearance). Christ's descent from heaven to earth was a declension from truth to appearance, from the realm of perfection to the realm of imperfection.<ref>Appleby, pg. 18</ref> This would imply that Jesus in flesh is false, and imperfect; however, Paschasius asserted that not every figure is false. Christ is simultaneously both truth and figure because his external, physical self is the figure of the truth, the physical manifestation of the truth that exists in the soul.<ref>Appleby, pg. 19</ref> The person that was Jesus was subject to human needs, just like the rest of humanity. He required to eat, to sleep, and to be in company with others. In addition to this, however, he also performed miracles. These behaviours which Jesus exhibited imply a duality in the concept of \"Word made flesh\". Miracles, until then only performed by God, the non-physical Truth or Word, were suddenly performed by a physical human being.<ref>Appleby, pg. 20</ref> The relationship between Jesus' humanity and his divinity is rather convoluted; however, it is analogous to the relation of figures (written letters) of words to their spoken counterparts. Therefore, Jesus in physical form is the visual representation, T-R-U-T-H, while his divinity is the spoken sound of those written letters together as a word.<ref>Appleby, pg. 16-17</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Adalard of Corbie]]\n*[[Wala of Corbie]]\n*[[Ratramnus of Corbie]]\n*[[Charles the Bald]]\n*[[Rabanus Maurus]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n*Radbertus, Paschausuis. \"The Lord\u2019s Body and Blood.\" Early Medieval Theology: The Library of Christian Classics.ed.

Ratramnus wrote a refutation of Paschasius' treatise on the Eucharist, ''De Corpore et Sanguine Domini'', using the same title.  \n\nIn 843 Paschasius succeeded Abbot Isaac, however he resigned his title ten years later to return to his studies.<ref>Cabaniss, pg. 2-3</ref>  He left Corbie for the nearby monastery of [[Saint-Riquier]], where he lived in voluntary exile for some years. Why he resigned is unknown, however it is likely that his actions were motivated by factional disputes within his monastic community; misunderstandings between himself and the younger monks were likely factors in his decision. \nHe returned to Corbie late in life, and resided in his old monastery until his death in 865.<ref>Matter, pg. 149</ref>\n\nPaschasius' body was first buried at the Church of St. John in Corbie.  After numerous reported miracles,  the Pope ordered his remains to be removed, and interred in the Church of St. Peter, Corbie.<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia\">Catholic Encyclopedia</ref>\n\n==Writings==\n\n===''De Corpore et Sanguine Domini''===\nThe most well-known and influential work of St. Paschasius, ''De Corpore et Sanguine Domini'' (written between 831 and 833), is an exposition on the nature of the [[Eucharist]]. It was originally written as an instructional manual for the monks under his care at Corbie, and is the first lengthy treatise on the sacrament of the Eucharist in the Western world.<ref>Zirkel, pg. 5</ref> In it, Paschasius agrees with [[Ambrose]] in affirming that the Eucharist contains the true, historical body of Jesus Christ. According to Paschasius, God is truth itself, and therefore, his words and actions must be true.  Christ's proclamation at the [[Last Supper]] that the bread and wine were his body and blood must be taken literally, since God is truth.<ref>Chazelle, pg. 9</ref>  He thus believes that the [[transubstantiation]] of the bread and wine offered in the Eucharist really occurs.  Only if the Eucharist is the actual body and blood of Christ can a Christian know it is salvific.<ref>Chazelle, pg. 10</ref>  \n\nPaschasius believed that the presence of the historical blood and body of Christ allows the partaker a real union with Jesus in a direct, personal, and physical union by joining a person's flesh with Christ's and Christ's flesh with his.<ref>Chazelle, pg. 10-11</ref>  To Paschasius, the Eucharist's transformation into the flesh and blood of Christ is possible because of the principle that God is truth;  God is able to manipulate nature, as he created it.<ref>Chazelle, pg. 12</ref> The book was given to [[Charles the Bald]], the Frankish king, as a present in 844, with the inclusion of a special introduction. The view Paschasius expressed in this work was met with some hostility; [[Ratramnus]] wrote a rebuttal by the same name, by order of [[Charles the Bald]], who did not agree with some of the views Paschasius held.  Ratramnus believed that the Eucharist was strictly metaphorical; he focused more on the relationship between faith and the newly emerging science. Shortly thereafter, a third monk joined the debate, [[Rabanus Maurus]], which initiated the Carolingian Eucharist Controversy.<ref>Chazelle, pg. 1</ref> Ultimately, however, the king accepted Paschasius' assertion, and the [[Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist|substantial presence of Christ in the Eucharist]] became the authoritative belief in the Roman Catholic faith.<ref>Zirkel, pg. 3</ref>\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-right: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#C0C0C0; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\" \n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"When I begin to think about [Adalard], I am inwardly affected by two contrary emotions, namely, grief, and joy.  The Apostle forbids us to mourn in such a situation, but my and our sudden desolation prevents us from rejoicing.\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | Paschasius Radbertus, ''Vita Adalhardi''\n|}\n\n===''Vitae Adalhardi et Walae''===\nWritten in 826 and 836, respectively, ''Vita Adalhardi'' and ''Vita Walae'' are spiritual biographies of Paschasius' role-models.  They are personal tributes, written for the memory of two fathers, and the patterns of life depicted in them are intended to be followed.<ref>Cabaniss, pg. 14</ref>\n\n''Vita Adalhardi'' is rather brief; it is a fairly conventional representation of a saint's life. However, the style that Paschasius uses is unique for the time in which it was written. Written in mourning for the loss of his friend, Paschasius compares Adalard to the painter [[Zeuxis]]. As described by [[Cicero]], artists study models to perfect their art; Zeuxis' challenge was to paint the woman, [[Helen of Troy]].  Paschasius states that just as Zeuxis studied forms in order to perfect his art, so too does Adalard in trying to reform the image of God in himself. In making this comparison, Paschasius was identified with being a [[humanistic]] writer of the Carolingian period, as he compared classic and ancient literature with contemporary literature.<ref>Appleby, pg. 1-2</ref> Paschasius depicts Adalard as a mirror image of Christ, emphasizing the elements of infinite love and descent into suffering.<ref>Appleby, pg. 7</ref>  He also parallels Adalard's role in the Church to that of a mother, which is a concept attributed to [[Cistercian]] spirituality in the 12th century, three hundred years after Paschasius' death.  The grief felt over the death of Adalard is extremely strong in the book \u2013 although Paschasius knows that suffering should give way to joy, as depicted by his forefathers, such as [[Jerome]], Paschasius' grief for the loss of his friend surpassed that of his literary models.  This style of writing is also not seen elsewhere prior to the 12th century.  Paschasius' justification of excess mourning is his most distinctive contribution to the tradition of consolation literature.<ref>Appleby, pg. 8-9</ref>\n\n''Vita Walae'' is much longer (about twice as long as ''Vita Adalhardi''), and is structured as a dialogue. In total, there are eight characters represented, presumably monks of Corbie.  These characters are given pseudonyms, probably nor with the intention of masking identities. It is more likely that these pseudonyms were employed to further support Paschasius' interpretation of Wala, as the names were taken from classical texts.<ref>Cabaniss, pg. 20</ref> Phrases and passages from a variety of sources are woven into the text ([[Acts of St. Sebastien]], [[The Book of Job]], various comedies of [[Terence]]). Although not displaying information about Wala, these additions reflect Paschasius' own beliefs and his skill at writing.<ref>Cabaniss, pg. 15</ref>  While ''Vita Adalhardi'' was written to be in part a funeral eulogy, ''Vita Walae'' was  written as a (fairly) accurate depiction of Wala.  Paschasius used sources in writing this biography, a handbook written by Wala, and treatises of the time, probably to show his own views through his depiction of Wala.<ref>Cabaniss, pg. 16</ref>\n\n===Other works===\nPaschasius has an extensive collection of works, including many [[exegeses]] on various books of the [[Bible]].  He wrote commentaries on the [[Gospel of Matthew]], [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]], and an exposition of [[Psalm 45]], which he dedicated to the nuns at St. Mary at Soissons.  ''De Partu Virginis'', written for his friend Emma, Abbess of St. Mary at Soissons and daughter of Theodrara, describes the lifestyle of nuns.  He also wrote a treatise, titled ''De Nativitae Sanctae Mariae'', regarding the nature of the [[Virgin Mary]] and the birth of [[Jesus Christ]]. Paschasius probably wrote much more, but none of it has survived through the centuries.<ref>Cabaniss, pg. 3</ref> Paschasius wrote a commentary on ''Revelation''.<ref>Brant James Pitre, Jesus and the Jewish Roots of Mary (p. 62).</ref>\n\n==Theological contributions==\n\n===Understanding of the human body===\nIn opposition to other [[Carolingian]] authors, Paschasius locates the ''[[Imago Dei]]'' (the \"Image of God\") in the whole human being - body as well as soul. This view is in alignment with that of the second-century [[Church Father]] [[Irenaeus]]. Irenaeus believed that Jesus was the physical embodiment of God; the son is the image of the father. As such, humans represent the image of God not only in soul, but in flesh as well. This view is in opposition to the more accepted view of [[Origen of Alexandria]], who believed that the physical body had no part in the image-relationship.<ref>Appleby, pg. 14</ref> Unlike other theologians of the time, Paschasius does not equate the [[sanctification]] process with a metaphysical detachment of the body and the soul. Instead, he believes that the [[human condition]] (existing in a physical form) can contribute positively to achieving sanctification. However, he did believe in a form of mitigated dualism, in which the soul plays a larger part in the process than the body.<ref>Appleby, pg.15</ref> Paschasius believes that life is an opportunity to practice for death; however, the concept that the body is a prison for the soul is practically non-existent in his work, and probably only occurs due to pressure from his peers. Even though he believed that the body has a role in one's sanctification process, he also acknowledged that flesh struggles against God, and thus has the ability to be corrupted.<ref>Appleby, pg. 17</ref>\n\n===Understanding of Christ's body===\nPaschasius believes in a distinction between ''veritas'' (truth) and ''figura'' (form, or appearance). Christ's descent from Heaven to Earth was a declension from truth to appearance, from the realm of perfection to the realm of imperfection.<ref>Appleby, pg. 18</ref> This would imply that Jesus in flesh is false, and imperfect; however, Paschasius asserted that not every figure is false. Christ is simultaneously both truth and figure because his external, physical self is the figure of the truth, the physical manifestation of the truth that exists in the soul.<ref>Appleby, pg. 19</ref> The person that was Jesus was subject to human needs, just like the rest of humanity. He required to eat, to sleep, and to be in company with others. In addition to this, however, he also performed miracles. These behaviours which Jesus exhibited imply a duality in the concept of \"Word made flesh\". Miracles, until then only performed by God, the non-physical Truth or Word, were suddenly performed by a physical human being.<ref>Appleby, pg. 20</ref> The relationship between Jesus' humanity and his divinity is rather convoluted; however, it is analogous to the relation of figures (written letters) of words to their spoken counterparts. Therefore, Jesus in physical form is the visual representation, T-R-U-T-H, while his divinity is the spoken sound of those written letters together as a word.<ref>Appleby, pg. 16-17</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Adalard of Corbie]]\n*[[Wala of Corbie]]\n*[[Ratramnus of Corbie]]\n*[[Charles the Bald]]\n*[[Rabanus Maurus]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n*Radbertus, Paschausuis. \"The Lord\u2019s Body and Blood.\" Early Medieval Theology: The Library of Christian Classics.ed.
