In the series' Instrumentality, he confronts his many traumas and why he acts the way he does, as Shinji believes himself to be worthless and unworthy of affection. After conversing with most of the ''Evangelion'' cast and seeing a version of himself in a world in which he leads a normal life. Shinji realizes he can be happy and his existence is worth living regardless. Shinji is greeted by the rest of the cast and congratulated.\n\n===''The End of Evangelion''===\n''[[The End of Evangelion]]'' continues Shinji's story, portraying his downward spiral into depression and eventual loss of the will to live. Shinji visits a comatose Asuka in the hospital, but when his pleas for attention go unanswered, Shinji accidentally exposes Asuka's breasts and masturbates at the sight. Shinji remains catatonic while all the NERV officers, including Misato, are killed. Shinji then decides to pilot the Eva to save those who are still alive, but a bakelite release ordered by Misato accidentally blocks the entrance of Unit-01. When Shinji learns of Asuka's defeat, the Evangelion moves on its own to let Shinji enter it again. Shinji's Ego causes the Eva's AT field to manifest in the form of gigantic, dreadful, divine wings. Despite this, after witnessing the mangled, mutilated corpse of Unit-02 being carried by the Mass Production Evas, Shinji's trauma becomes even worse as the Human Instrumentality Project begins. Shinji's intense emotion summons the Lance of Longinus stuck on the Moon to Earth. Shinji's Ego continues to resist Lilith-Rei and SEELE's assaults on his soul; but when Lilith-Rei takes the form of Kaworu, Shinji's Ego weakens and Unit 01's AT-Field is penetrated. Lilith-Rei returns to her form as Rei, and as Yui's soul from inside the Eva tells Shinji that Rei, is \"all of Shinji's hopes and dreams\", Shinji is asked \"what do you wish for?\" and he has a vision of a woman's breasts being clutched. Lilith-Rei and SEELE ultimately defeat Shinji's Ego and he finally enters Instrumentality. Shinji then has extended dream-like sequences inside Instrumentality, has access to Misato's memories of having sex with Kaji and briefly sees himself having sex with Asuka. Shinji insists on gaining attention from Asuka, but she states he can't do anything. Shinji tells Asuka he wants to help her and stay with her forever, but Asuka retorts that Shinji is afraid of everyone and has never truly loved anyone as he doesn't even love himself. Angry at this rejection, Shinji lashes out and chokes her.\n\nThe fusion of the Lance of Longinus with the Eva recreates a Tree of Life. Shinji and the Eva, now possessing both the Fruit of Wisdom and the Fruit of Life, become \"God\". Shinji, now one with all other humans, converses with them, particularly Rei and Kaworu. Shinji and Eva's absorption of a Fruit of Life and a Fruit of Wisdom meant that Eva, and the pilot inside, will continue to exist forever, \"even after the Sun, the Moon, and the planets are gone\". He eventually converses with Yui, whom he wonders what will do, until he decides that he wants to live and returns to Earth. Shinji, having erected several grave markers in memory of most of the other characters, wakes up sometime later, and notices Asuka laying down by his side. Shinji attempts to strangle her again for an un-clarified reason, but stops himself and breaks down after Asuka regains consciousness and caresses his face.\n\n===''Rebuild of Evangelion''===\nIn ''[[Rebuild of Evangelion]]'' Shinji returns as the central protagonist in ''[[Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone]]'', where he is shown to be more outspoken than his TV counterpart. In this film, Shinji's role is very much the same as that of the anime series. He is assigned to be the pilot of Unit-01 and works alongside Rei to defeat the Angel Ramiel.<ref>{{cite video | people = [[Hideaki Anno]], [[Kazuya Tsurumaki]], Masayuki (directors) | title = [[Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone]] | medium = [[Film]] | publisher = [[Studio Khara]] |date = 2007}}</ref> In ''[[Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance]]'', Shinji continues his duties as pilot of Unit-01, albeit reluctantly. After the battle with Bardiel, wherein his father forced him to critically injure Asuka, Shinji retires from his duties and leaves NERV. When Zeruel consumes Rei, Shinji returns and defeats the Angel by seemingly fusing with the Evangelion.<ref>{{cite video | people = [[Hideaki Anno]], [[Kazuya Tsurumaki]], Masayuki (directors) | title = [[Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance]] | medium = [[Film]] | publisher = [[Studio Khara]] |date = 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo]]'', set fourteen years later, Shinji is awakened to a changed world caused by the Third Impact. Shinji is treated with hostility by Misato and others. They install a \"DSS Choker\" on him, an explosive device on his neck that is to be activated if he comes close to starting another Impact. Asuka meets him and, surprised at the fact that Asuka's physical appearance remains unchanged even after fourteen years, is told of the \"Curse of Eva\", as both Asuka and Mari still look like teenagers. The ship they are on comes under attack by NERV and Rei breaks in his holding cell. After learning from Misato that they are part of a new organization called Wille fighting against NERV, Shinji decides to leave with Rei. Misato briefly considers preventing Shinji's capture by remotely activating the choker, but hesitates. At the remnants of NERV, he is approached by Kaworu who befriends him. He becomes despondent after Kaworu tells him that humanity holds him responsible for initiating Third Impact. He then has a meeting with Fuyutsuki. Shinji learns his mother's soul is the control mechanism of Unit 01 and that it is, in fact, a clone of Rei that now pilots Mark 09, aka The Vessel of Adams. After Shinji realizes that he did not save Rei, Kaworu convinces him to pilot Eva-13 with him, one of the Four Adams and the most powerful known Evangelion which the two operate, as Gendo told Shinji to.\n\nKaworu claims Third Impact can be erased by using the spears of Longinus and Cassius allegedly lodged in Lilith. Shinji tells Asuka she doesn't know what she's talking about, while Kaworu doesn't react and is instead deep in thought. After resisting Asuka's attempts to stop him, Shinji pulls the Spears, ignoring Asuka's warnings who asks him if he wants to start another Impact, as well as Kaworu's own when he realizes the spears have been changed, disturbing the scenario he had in mind. Shinji starts Fourth impact after pulling the two spears of Longinus out from Lilith. Eva-13 then eats the Twelfth Angel and ascends to divinity. Kaworu is killed by the DSS Choker he had taken from Shinji in an attempt to stop Fourth Impact, however, that is only successful when Mari forcibly ejects Shinji from the Eva. A devastated Shinji loses his will to live. Asuka rescues him from his entry plug, accuses him of acting like a baby and only caring about himself. The Rei clone appears and follows Asuka and Shinji as they start heading along the ruins of Tokyo-3 to get rescued by Wille again.\n\n===In other media===\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2009}}\nShinji appears in most manga adaptations of ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'', including [[Yoshiyuki Sadamoto]]'s [[Neon Genesis Evangelion (manga)|manga adaptation]]. The manga generally follows the plot of the anime with occasional alterations in events. In this manga, Shinji's role is very similar to his anime counterpart, although changes in characterization are apparent. This is due to the fact the manga is written from Sadamoto's point of view involving Shinji. Sadamoto was inspired to write the manga after learning of Shinji's role in the first episode of the television series.<ref name=\"sadamotointer\"/> Shinji is also a primary protagonist in ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Shinji Ikari Raising Project|the Shinji Ikari Raising Project]]'' and ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Angelic Days]]'' where he is portrayed in a different light than his anime counterpart, usually happier and more stable. Spin-offs and video games such as these often pair Shinji romantically with [[Asuka Langley Soryu]] or, less commonly, [[Rei Ayanami]].\n\nShinji, alongside other ''Evangelion'' characters, makes frequent appearances in video games, such as ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (video game)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' for the [[Nintendo 64]]. Shinji is also a playable character in the popular cross-over video game franchise [[Super Robot Wars]] where he and other ''Evangelion'' characters work with characters from various other [[mecha]] series, in which he developes a crush for other characters such as [[Lynn Minmay]], provoking jealously in Asuka, who tries to regain his attention.\n\nIn episode 31 of ''[[Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion]]'', Shinji is the pilot of the 500 TYPE EVA, a redo of the Shinkalion 500 [[Kodama (train)|Kodama]] stylized to resembled the real TYPE EVA [[livery]] of the [[500 Series Shinkansen]] and the EVA Unit 01. He only appeared in the crossover episode until the Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion The Movie, which revealed the 500 TYPE EVA and Shinji is from another dimension, the 500 TYPE EVA has new technology for combat.\n\n==Reception==\nShinji ranked 25th on [[IGN]]'s first top 25 anime characters list.

Imbued with character flaws that ultimately prove his undoing as he spirals into depression and insanity by the series' end, Shinji is a departure from the more idealistic heroes commonplace in mecha anime (or adventure fiction in general, for that matter).\" and how by the end of ''[[End of Evangelion]]'', \"Shinji must continue to strive to attain happiness: no one is going to hand it to him on a silver plate.\" On his relationships with other characters, Crandol states that \"Shinji harbors semi-romantic feelings for the three women closest to him, but his distrusting nature prevents him from developing any kind of meaningful relationship with them, and inside he angrily believes them of intentionally building barriers to prevent him from getting close. Again it is [[Asuka Langley Soryu|Asuka]] that it is most interesting to consider in this light. Sensing a kindred soul beneath her aggressive exterior (or perhaps admiring the determination he lacks), Shinji comes to love her, but does not know how to express it. Likewise, it is hinted that Asuka has similarly romantic feelings for Shinji, but her ego prevents her from admitting it even to herself.

In the series' Instrumentality, he confronts his many traumas and why he acts the way he does, as Shinji believes himself to be worthless and unworthy of affection. After conversing with most of the ''Evangelion'' cast and seeing a version of himself in a world in which he leads a normal life. Shinji realizes he can be happy and his existence is worth living regardless. Shinji is greeted by the rest of the cast and congratulated.\n\n===''The End of Evangelion''===\n''[[The End of Evangelion]]'' continues Shinji's story, portraying his downward spiral into depression and eventual loss of the will to live. Shinji visits a comatose Asuka in the hospital, but when his pleas for attention go unanswered, Shinji accidentally exposes Asuka's breasts and masturbates at the sight. Shinji remains catatonic while all the NERV officers, including Misato, are killed. Shinji then decides to pilot the Eva to save those who are still alive, but a bakelite release ordered by Misato accidentally blocks the entrance of Unit-01. When Shinji learns of Asuka's defeat, the Evangelion moves on its own to let Shinji enter it again. Shinji's Ego causes the Eva's AT field to manifest in the form of gigantic, dreadful, divine wings. Despite this, after witnessing the mangled, mutilated corpse of Unit-02 being carried by the Mass Production Evas, Shinji's trauma becomes even worse as the Human Instrumentality Project begins. Shinji's intense emotion summons the Lance of Longinus stuck on the Moon to Earth. Shinji's Ego continues to resist Lilith-Rei and SEELE's assaults on his soul; but when Lilith-Rei takes the form of Kaworu, Shinji's Ego weakens and Unit 01's AT-Field is penetrated. Lilith-Rei returns to her form as Rei, and as Yui's soul from inside the Eva tells Shinji that Rei, is \"all of Shinji's hopes and dreams\", Shinji is asked \"what do you wish for?\" and he has a vision of a woman's breasts being clutched. Lilith-Rei and SEELE ultimately defeat Shinji's Ego and he finally enters Instrumentality. Shinji then has extended dream-like sequences inside Instrumentality, has access to Misato's memories of having sex with Kaji and briefly sees himself having sex with Asuka. Shinji insists on gaining attention from Asuka, but she states he can't do anything. Shinji tells Asuka he wants to help her and stay with her forever, but Asuka retorts that Shinji is afraid of everyone and has never truly loved anyone as he doesn't even love himself. Angry at this rejection, Shinji lashes out and chokes her.\n\nThe fusion of the Lance of Longinus with the Eva recreates a Tree of Life. Shinji and the Eva, now possessing both the Fruit of Wisdom and the Fruit of Life, become \"God\". Shinji, now one with all other humans, converses with them, particularly Rei and Kaworu. Shinji and Eva's absorption of a Fruit of Life and a Fruit of Wisdom meant that Eva, and the pilot inside, will continue to exist forever, \"even after the Sun, the Moon, and the planets are gone\". He eventually converses with Yui, whom he wonders what will do, until he decides that he wants to live and returns to Earth. Shinji, having erected several grave markers in memory of most of the other characters, wakes up sometime later, and notices Asuka laying down by his side. Shinji attempts to strangle her again for an un-clarified reason, but stops himself and breaks down after Asuka regains consciousness and caresses his face.\n\n===''Rebuild of Evangelion''===\nIn ''[[Rebuild of Evangelion]]'' Shinji returns as the central protagonist in ''[[Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone]]'', where he is shown to be more outspoken than his TV counterpart. In this film, Shinji's role is very much the same as that of the anime series. He is assigned to be the pilot of Unit-01 and works alongside Rei to defeat the Angel Ramiel.<ref>{{cite video | people = [[Hideaki Anno]], [[Kazuya Tsurumaki]], Masayuki (directors) | title = [[Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone]] | medium = [[Film]] | publisher = [[Studio Khara]] |date = 2007}}</ref> In ''[[Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance]]'', Shinji continues his duties as pilot of Unit-01, albeit reluctantly.

Shinji is treated with hostility by Misato and others. They install a \"DSS Choker\" on him, an explosive device on his neck that is to be activated if he comes close to starting another Impact. Asuka meets him and, surprised at the fact that Asuka's physical appearance remains unchanged even after fourteen years, is told of the \"Curse of Eva\", as both Asuka and Mari still look like teenagers. The ship they are on comes under attack by NERV and Rei breaks in his holding cell. After learning from Misato that they are part of a new organization called Wille fighting against NERV, Shinji decides to leave with Rei. Misato briefly considers preventing Shinji's capture by remotely activating the choker, but hesitates. At the remnants of NERV, he is approached by Kaworu who befriends him. He becomes despondent after Kaworu tells him that humanity holds him responsible for initiating Third Impact. He then has a meeting with Fuyutsuki. Shinji learns his mother's soul is the control mechanism of Unit 01 and that it is, in fact, a clone of Rei that now pilots Mark 09, aka The Vessel of Adams. After Shinji realizes that he did not save Rei, Kaworu convinces him to pilot Eva-13 with him, one of the Four Adams and the most powerful known Evangelion which the two operate, as Gendo told Shinji to.\n\nKaworu claims Third Impact can be erased by using the spears of Longinus and Cassius allegedly lodged in Lilith. Shinji tells Asuka she doesn't know what she's talking about, while Kaworu doesn't react and is instead deep in thought. After resisting Asuka's attempts to stop him, Shinji pulls the Spears, ignoring Asuka's warnings who asks him if he wants to start another Impact, as well as Kaworu's own when he realizes the spears have been changed, disturbing the scenario he had in mind. Shinji starts Fourth impact after pulling the two spears of Longinus out from Lilith. Eva-13 then eats the Twelfth Angel and ascends to divinity. Kaworu is killed by the DSS Choker he had taken from Shinji in an attempt to stop Fourth Impact, however, that is only successful when Mari forcibly ejects Shinji from the Eva. A devastated Shinji loses his will to live. Asuka rescues him from his entry plug, accuses him of acting like a baby and only caring about himself. The Rei clone appears and follows Asuka and Shinji as they start heading along the ruins of Tokyo-3 to get rescued by Wille again.\n\n===In other media===\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2009}}\nShinji appears in most manga adaptations of ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'', including [[Yoshiyuki Sadamoto]]'s [[Neon Genesis Evangelion (manga)|manga adaptation]]. The manga generally follows the plot of the anime with occasional alterations in events. In this manga, Shinji's role is very similar to his anime counterpart, although changes in characterization are apparent. This is due to the fact the manga is written from Sadamoto's point of view involving Shinji. Sadamoto was inspired to write the manga after learning of Shinji's role in the first episode of the television series.<ref name=\"sadamotointer\"/> Shinji is also a primary protagonist in ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Shinji Ikari Raising Project|the Shinji Ikari Raising Project]]'' and ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Angelic Days]]'' where he is portrayed in a different light than his anime counterpart, usually happier and more stable. Spin-offs and video games such as these often pair Shinji romantically with [[Asuka Langley Soryu]] or, less commonly, [[Rei Ayanami]].\n\nShinji, alongside other ''Evangelion'' characters, makes frequent appearances in video games, such as ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (video game)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' for the [[Nintendo 64]]. Shinji is also a playable character in the popular cross-over video game franchise [[Super Robot Wars]] where he and other ''Evangelion'' characters work with characters from various other [[mecha]] series, in which he developes a crush for other characters such as [[Lynn Minmay]], provoking jealously in Asuka, who tries to regain his attention.\n\nIn episode 31 of ''[[Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion]]'', Shinji is the pilot of the 500 TYPE EVA, a redo of the Shinkalion 500 [[Kodama (train)|Kodama]] stylized to resembled the real TYPE EVA [[livery]] of the [[500 Series Shinkansen]] and the EVA Unit 01. He only appeared in the crossover episode until the Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion The Movie, which revealed the 500 TYPE EVA and Shinji is from another dimension, the 500 TYPE EVA has new technology for combat.\n\n==Reception==\nShinji ranked 25th on [[IGN]]'s first top 25 anime characters list.

Imbued with character flaws that ultimately prove his undoing as he spirals into depression and insanity by the series' end, Shinji is a departure from the more idealistic heroes commonplace in mecha anime (or adventure fiction in general, for that matter).\" and how by the end of ''[[End of Evangelion]]'', \"Shinji must continue to strive to attain happiness: no one is going to hand it to him on a silver plate.\" On his relationships with other characters, Crandol states that \"Shinji harbors semi-romantic feelings for the three women closest to him, but his distrusting nature prevents him from developing any kind of meaningful relationship with them, and inside he angrily believes them of intentionally building barriers to prevent him from getting close. Again it is [[Asuka Langley Soryu|Asuka]] that it is most interesting to consider in this light. Sensing a kindred soul beneath her aggressive exterior (or perhaps admiring the determination he lacks), Shinji comes to love her, but does not know how to express it.
