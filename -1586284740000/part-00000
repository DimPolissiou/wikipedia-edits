[[Duchy of Saxony|Saxon]] Holstein became a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] after [[Charlemagne]]'s [[Saxon Wars|Saxon campaigns]] in the late eighth century. Since 811, the northern frontier of Holstein (and thus the Empire) was marked by the [[Eider (river)|River Eider]].\n\nThe term Schleswig comes from the city of [[Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig]]. The name derives from the [[Schlei]] [[inlet]] in the east and ''vik'' meaning inlet in [[Old Norse]] or settlement in [[Old Saxon]], and linguistically identical ([[cognate]]) with the \"-wick\" or \"-wich\" element in place-names in [[Great Britain|Britain]].\n\nThe [[Duchy of Schleswig]] or Southern Jutland was originally an integral part of Denmark, but was in [[medieval]] times established as a [[fief]] under the Kingdom of Denmark, with the same relation to the [[Danish Royal Family|Danish Crown]] as for example [[Brandenburg]] or [[Bavaria]] vis-\u00e0-vis the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. Around 1100, the [[Duchy of Saxony|Duke of Saxony]] gave Holstein, as it was his own country, to [[Count]] [[Adolf I of Holstein|Adolf I]] of [[County of Schauenburg|Schauenburg]].\n\n===Duchies in the Danish realm===\n\nSchleswig and Holstein have at different times belonged in part or completely to either Denmark or Germany, or have been virtually independent of both nations. The exception is that Schleswig had never been part of Germany until the Second Schleswig War in 1864. For many centuries, the King of Denmark was both a Danish Duke of Schleswig and a German Duke of Holstein. Essentially, Schleswig was either integrated into Denmark or was a Danish fief, and Holstein was a German fief and once a sovereign state long ago. Both were for several centuries ruled by the kings of Denmark. In 1721, all of Schleswig was united as a single duchy under the king of Denmark, and the great powers of Europe confirmed in an international treaty that all future kings of Denmark should automatically become dukes of Schleswig, and consequently Schleswig would always follow the same order of succession as the one chosen in the Kingdom of Denmark. In the church, following the reformation, German was used in the southern part of Schleswig and Danish in the northern part. This would later prove decisive for shaping national sentiments in the population, as well as after 1814 when mandatory school education was introduced. The administration of both duchies was conducted in German, despite the fact that they were governed from Copenhagen (from 1523 by the ''German Chancellery'' which was in 1806 renamed ''Schleswig-Holstein Chancellery'').\n\n===Schleswig-Holstein Question===\n{{main|Schleswig-Holstein Question}}The [[Nationalism|German national awakening]] that followed the [[Napoleonic Wars]] gave rise to a strong popular movement in Holstein and [[Southern Schleswig]] for unification with a new [[Prussia]]n-dominated Germany. This development was paralleled by an equally strong Danish national awakening in Denmark and Northern Schleswig. This movement called for the complete reintegration of Schleswig into the Kingdom of Denmark and demanded an end to discrimination against [[Danes]] in Schleswig. The ensuing conflict is sometimes called the [[Schleswig-Holstein Question]]. In 1848, King [[Frederick VII of Denmark]] declared that he would grant Denmark a liberal constitution and the immediate goal for the Danish national movement was to ensure that this constitution would give rights to all Danes, i.e. not only to those in the Kingdom of Denmark, but also to Danes (and Germans) living in Schleswig. Furthermore, they demanded protection for the Danish language in Schleswig (the dominant language in almost a quarter of Schleswig had changed from Danish to German since the beginning of the 19th century).\n\nA [[liberalism|liberal]] [[constitution]] for Holstein was not seriously considered in [[Copenhagen]], since it was well known that the political [[\u00e9lite]] of Holstein were more conservative than Copenhagen's. Representatives of German-minded Schleswig-Holsteiners demanded that Schleswig and Holstein be unified and allowed its own constitution and that Schleswig join Holstein as a member of the [[German Confederation]]. These demands were rejected by the Danish government in 1848, and the Germans of Holstein and southern Schleswig rebelled. This began the [[First Schleswig War]] (1848\u201351), which ended in a Danish victory at [[Battle of Isted|Idstedt]].\n\nIn 1863, conflict broke out again when Frederick VII died without legitimate issue. According to the [[order of succession]] of Denmark and Schleswig, the crowns of both Denmark and Schleswig would pass to Duke Christian of [[Duchy of Gl\u00fccksburg|Gl\u00fccksburg]], who became [[Christian IX of Denmark|Christian IX]]. The transmission of the duchy of Holstein to the head of the (German-oriented) branch of the Danish royal family, the [[House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg|House of Augustenborg]], was more controversial. The separation of the two duchies was challenged by the Augustenborg heir, who claimed, as in 1848, to be rightful heir of both Schleswig and Holstein. The promulgation of a common constitution for Denmark and Schleswig in November 1863 prompted [[Otto von Bismarck]] to intervene and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] declared war on Denmark. This was the [[Second War of Schleswig]], which ended in Danish defeat. [[United Kingdom|British]] attempts to mediate in the [[London Conference of 1864]] failed, and Denmark lost Schleswig (Northern and Southern Schleswig), Holstein, and [[Herzogtum Lauenburg|Lauenburg]] to Prussia and Austria.\n\n===Province of Prussia===\n\nContrary to the hopes of German Schleswig-Holsteiners, the area did not gain its independence, but was annexed as a province of Prussia in 1867. Also following the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866, section five of the [[Peace of Prague (1866)|Peace of Prague]] stipulated that the people of Northern Schleswig would be consulted in a [[referendum]] on whether to remain under Prussian rule or return to Danish rule. This condition, however, was never fulfilled by Prussia. During the decades of Prussian rule within the [[German Empire]], authorities attempted a [[Germanisation]] policy in the northern part of Schleswig, which remained predominantly Danish. The period also meant increased industrialisation of Schleswig-Holstein and the use of Kiel and Flensburg as important [[Imperial German Navy]] locations. The northernmost part and west coast of the province saw a wave of emigration to America, while some Danes of North Schleswig emigrated to Denmark.\n\n===Plebiscite in 1920===\n\nFollowing the defeat of Germany in [[World War I]], the Allied powers arranged [[Schleswig Plebiscites|a plebiscite in northern and central Schleswig]]. The plebiscite was conducted under the auspices of an international commission which designated two voting zones to cover the northern and south-central parts of Schleswig. Steps were taken to also create a third zone covering a southern area, but zone III was cancelled again and never voted, as the Danish government asked the commission not to expand the plebiscite to this area.\n\nIn zone I covering Northern Schleswig (10 February 1920), 75% voted for [[Political union|reunification]] with Denmark and 25% voted for Germany. In zone II covering central Schleswig (14 March 1920), the results were reversed; 80% voted for Germany and just 20% for Denmark. Only minor areas on the island of [[F\u00f6hr]] showed a Danish majority, and the rest of the Danish vote was primarily in the town of Flensburg.<ref>Schwedler, Frank: Historischer Atlas Schleswig-Holstein 1867 bis 1945, Wachholtz Verlag, Neum\u00fcnster</ref>\n[[File:Abstimmung-schleswig-1920.png|thumb|right|275px|Results of the 1920 plebiscites in North and Central Schleswig]]\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; font-size:95%\" \n|- style=\"text-align:center; background:lemonchiffon;\"\n| rowspan=\"2\"|'''Electorate'''\n| rowspan=\"2\"|'''German name'''\n| rowspan=\"2\"|'''Danish name'''\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:magenta\"|'''For Germany'''\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#99bbff\"|'''For Denmark'''\n|-style=\"text-align:center\"\n| style=\"background:lavenderblush\"|percent\n| style=\"background:lavenderblush\"|votes\n| style=\"background:aliceblue\"|percent\n| style=\"background:aliceblue\"|votes\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\"|\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow\"\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:lightyellow; text-align:center\"|'''Zone I''' (Northern Schleswig),  10 February 1920|| '''25.1''' %||'''25,329'''  ||'''74.9''' % ||'''75,431'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\"|\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"\n| District of\n| align=Left|Hadersleben\n| align=Left|[[Haderslev Municipality|Haderslev]]\n| 16.0% ||6,585 \n| 84.0% ||34,653 \n|-\n| Town of \n| Hadersleben \n| [[Haderslev]]\n| 38.6% ||3,275\n| 61.4% ||5,209 \n|-\n| colspan=\"7\"|\n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee\"\n| District of\n| align=left|Apenrade || align=left| [[Aabenraa Municipality|Aabenraa]]\n| 32.3% ||6,030 \n| 67.7% ||12,653\n|-\n| Town of\n| Apenrade|| [[Aabenraa]]\n| 55.1% ||2,725 \n| 44.9% ||2,224 \n|-\n| colspan=\"7\"|\n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"\n| District of \n|  align=left|Sonderburg ||  align=left|[[S\u00f8nderborg Municipality|S\u00f8nderborg]]\n| 22.9% ||5,083 \n| 77.1% ||17,100\n|-\n| Town of \n| Sonderburg || [[S\u00f8nderborg]]\n| 56.2% ||2,601\n| 43.8%||2,029 \n|-\n| Town of\n| Augustenburg ||[[Augustenborg, Denmark|Augustenborg]]\n| 48.0% || 236 \n| 52.0% || 256\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\"|\n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"\n| Northern part of District of\n|  align=left|Tondern ||  align=left|[[T\u00f8nder Municipality|T\u00f8nder]]\n| 40.9% || 7,083\n| 59.1% || 10,223 \n|- \n| Town of\n| Tondern || [[T\u00f8nder]]\n| 76.5% || 2,448 \n| 23.5% || 750 \n|-\n| Town of\n| Hoyer || [[H\u00f8jer]]\n| 72.6% || 581\n| 27.4% || 219 \n|-\n| Town of \n| L\u00fcgumkloster || [[L\u00f8gumkloster]]\n| 48.8% || 516\n| 51.2% || 542 \n|-\n| colspan=\"7\"|\n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"\n| Northern part of District of\n|  align=left|[[Flensburg]] ||  align=left|Flensborg\n| 40.6% || 548 \n| 59.4% || 802 \n|-\n| colspan=\"7\"|\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center; \"|'''Zone II''' (Central Schleswig), 14 March 1920||'''80.2''' % ||'''51,742'''||'''19.8''' %||'''12,800'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\"|\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"\n| Southern part of District of \n|  align=left|Tondern ||  align=left|[[T\u00f8nder]]\n| 87.9% || 17,283\n| 12.1% || 2,376 \n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"\n| Southern part of District of\n| align=left|[[Flensburg]] || align=left| Flensborg\n| 82.6% || 6,688 \n| 17.4% || 1,405\n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"\n|  Town of \n|  align=left|[[Flensburg]] ||  align=left|Flensborg\n| 75.2% || 27,081 \n| 24.8% || 8,944\n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"\n| Northern part of District of\n|  align=left|[[Husum]] ||  align=left|Husum\n| 90.0% || 672\n| 10.0% || 75 \n|-\n|}\n\nOn 15 June 1920, Northern Schleswig officially returned to Danish rule. The Danish/German border was the only one of the borders imposed on Germany by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] after World War I which was never challenged by [[Adolf Hitler]].\n\nIn 1937, the Nazis passed the so-called [[Greater Hamburg Act]] (''Gro\u00df-Hamburg-Gesetz''), where the nearby Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg was expanded, to encompass towns that had formerly belonged to the Prussian [[province of Schleswig-Holstein]]. To compensate Prussia for these losses (and partly because Hitler had a personal dislike for [[L\u00fcbeck]]<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/citybreaks/5428909/Lubeck-The-town-that-said-no-to-Hitler.html \"L\u00fcbeck: The town that said no to Hitler\"], Simon Heffer, www.telegraph.co.uk, Retrieved 2010-06-28.</ref>), the 711-year-long independence of the Hansestadt L\u00fcbeck came to an end, and almost all its territory was incorporated into Schleswig-Holstein.\n\n===State of Federal Germany===\n\nAfter [[World War II]], the Prussian province Schleswig-Holstein came under British occupation. On 23 August 1946, the military government abolished the province and reconstituted it as a separate ''Land''.<ref>Ordinance No. 46, {{cite web|url= http://www.lwl.org/westfaelische-geschichte/que/normal/que1167.pdf |title=''Abolition of the Provinces in the British Zone of the Former State of Prussia and Reconstitution thereof as Separate L\u00e4nder'' }}&nbsp;{{small|(218&nbsp;KB)}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u201350)|forced migrations of Germans between 1944 and 1950]], the population of Schleswig-Holstein increased by 33% (860,000 people).<ref>[http://www.hdg.de/lemo/html/Nachkriegsjahre/DasEndeAlsAnfang/fluchtUndVertreibung.html Flucht und Vertreibung] at [[Haus der Geschichte]] {{in lang|de}}</ref> A pro-Danish political movement arose in Schleswig, with transfer of the area to Denmark as an ultimate goal. This was supported neither by the British occupation administration nor the Danish government. In 1955, the German and Danish governments issued the [[Bonn-Copenhagen Declarations]] confirming the rights of the ethnic minorities on both sides of the border. Conditions between the nationalities have since been stable and generally respectful.\n\n==Geography==\n{{See also|List of places in Schleswig-Holstein}}\n[[File:Schleswig-Holstein.png|thumb|left|Topographic map of Schleswig-Holstein]]\n\nSchleswig-Holstein lies on the base of [[Jutland Peninsula]] between the [[North Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea]]. Strictly speaking, \"Schleswig\" refers to the German Southern Schleswig ({{lang-de|S\u00fcdschleswig}} or ''Landesteil Schleswig'', {{lang-da|Sydslesvig}}), whereas Northern Schleswig is in Denmark ([[South Jutland County]], [[Region of Southern Denmark]]). The state of Schleswig-Holstein further consists of Holstein, as well as [[Lauenburg]] and the formerly independent city of L\u00fcbeck.\n\nSchleswig-Holstein borders Denmark ([[Region of Southern Denmark|Southern Denmark]]) to the north, the North Sea to the west, the Baltic Sea to the east, and the German states of [[Lower Saxony]], [[Hamburg]], and [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] to the south.\n\nIn the western part of the state, the lowlands have virtually no hills. The [[North Frisian Islands]], as well as almost all of Schleswig-Holstein's North Sea coast, form the [[Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park]] (''Nationalpark Schleswig-Holsteinisches Wattenmeer'') which is the largest national park in Central Europe. Germany's only high-sea island, [[Heligoland]], is situated in the North Sea.\n\nThe Baltic Sea coast in the east of Schleswig-Holstein is marked by bays, [[fjord]]s, and cliff lines. Rolling hills (the highest elevation is the Bungsberg at {{convert|168|m|disp=or}}) and many lakes are found, especially in the eastern part of Holstein called the [[Holstein Switzerland]] and the former Duchy of Lauenburg (''Herzogtum Lauenburg''). [[Fehmarn]] is the only island off the eastern coast. The longest river besides the [[Elbe]] is the [[Eider (river)|Eider]]; the most important waterway is the [[Kiel Canal]] which connects the North Sea and Baltic Sea.\n\n===Administration===\n[[File:Schleswig-Holstein Kreise (nummeriert).svg|thumb|Districts of Schleswig-Holstein]]\n\nSchleswig-Holstein is divided into 11 [[Districts of Germany|''Kreise'']] (districts):\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n# [[Dithmarschen]]\n# [[Herzogtum Lauenburg|Lauenburg]] (formally ''Herzogtum Lauenburg'' or \"Duchy of Lauenburg\")\n# [[Nordfriesland]]\n# [[Ostholstein]]\n# [[Pinneberg (district)|Pinneberg]]\n# [[Pl\u00f6n (district)|Pl\u00f6n]]\n# [[Rendsburg-Eckernf\u00f6rde]]\n# [[Schleswig-Flensburg]]\n# [[Segeberg]]\n# [[Steinburg]]\n# [[Stormarn (district)|Stormarn]]\n}}\n\nFurthermore, the four separate [[Stadtbezirk|urban districts]] are:\n\n# KI &nbsp; - [[Kiel]]\n# HL &nbsp; - ''Hansestadt'' (\"Hanseatic town\") [[L\u00fcbeck]]\n# NMS - [[Neum\u00fcnster]]\n# FL &nbsp; - [[Flensburg]]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{historical populations|13=1960|14=2,309,409|15=1970|16=2,510,608|17=1980|18=2,611,285|19=1990|20=2,626,127|21=2000|22=2,789,761|23=2010|24=2,834,259|25=2018|26=2,896,900|percentages=pagr|footnote=source:<ref>[https://www.destatis.de/DE/Home/_inhalt.html Statistisches Bundesamt]</ref>}}\n\nSchleswig-Holstein has an aging population.

Supposedly, [[Otto von Bismarck]] decreed that the two lions were to face the nettle because of the discomfort to their bottoms which would have resulted if the lions faced away from it.\n\nThe motto of Schleswig-Holstein is ''\"Up ewich ungedeelt\"'' ([[Middle Low German]]: \"Forever undivided\", modern High German: ''\"Auf ewig ungeteilt\"''). It goes back to the Vertrag von Ripen or Handfeste von Ripen (Danish: Ribe H\u00e5ndf\u00e6stning) or [[Treaty of Ribe]] in 1460. Ripen (Ribe) is a historical small town at the North Sea coast in Northern Schleswig. See [[History of Schleswig-Holstein]].\n\nThe anthem from 1844 is called \"[[Wanke nicht, mein Vaterland]]\" (\"Don't falter, my fatherland\"), but it is usually referred to with its first line ''\"Schleswig-Holstein meerumschlungen\"'' (i.e., \"Schleswig-Holstein embraced by the seas\") or \"Schleswig-Holstein-Lied\" (Schleswig-Holstein song).\n\nThe old city of L\u00fcbeck is a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]].\n\n===Languages===\n[[Danish language|Danish]], [[German language|German]], [[Low German]] and [[North Frisian language|North Frisian]] are the official languages of the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsyd.dk/artikel/283864:Dansk-er-blevet-officielt-sprog-i-Slesvig|website=tvsyd.dk|title=Dansk er blevet officielt sprog i Slesvig|date=14 May 2015|first=J\u00f8rgen|last=Nygaard|language=da}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, Low German (in Holstein and the South of Schleswig), Danish (in Schleswig), and North Frisian (in North Frisia in Western Schleswig) were spoken. During the language change in the 19th century some Danish and North Frisian dialects in Southern Schleswig were replaced by German.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bock|first1=Karl N.|title=Mittelniederdeutsch und heutiges Plattdeutsch im ehemaligen D\u00e4nischen Herzogtum Schleswig.

[[Missingsch]], a Low German dialect with heavy [[High German]] ([[Standard German]]) influence, is commonly spoken informally throughout the state, while a [[mixed language]] [[Petuh]] (mixture of High German and [[Danish language|Danish]]) is used in and around [[Flensburg]]. Danish is used by the [[Danish minority of Southern Schleswig|Danish minority]] in Southern Schleswig, and [[North Frisian]] is spoken by the [[North Frisians]] of the [[North Sea Coast]] and the Northern Frisian Islands in [[Southern Schleswig]]. The North Frisian dialect called [[Heligolandic dialect|Heligolandic]] (''Halunder'') is spoken on the island of [[Heligoland]].\n\nAs is the case throughout Germany, [[High German languages|High German]], introduced in the 16th century, has come to steadily replace local dialects for official purposes, and is today the predominant language of media, law and legislature. It is spoken by virtually all inhabitants in formal situations.

Originally, it referred to the central of the three [[Saxons|Saxon]] tribes north of the [[River Elbe]]: ''Tedmarsgoi'' ([[Dithmarschen (gau)|Dithmarschen]]), [[Holstein]] and ''Sturmarii'' ([[Stormarn (gau)|Stormarn]]). The area of the tribe of the Holsts was between the [[St\u00f6r]] River and [[Hamburg]], and after [[Christianization]], their main [[church (building)|church]] was in [[Schenefeld, Steinburg|Schenefeld]]. [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxon]] Holstein became a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] after [[Charlemagne]]'s [[Saxon Wars|Saxon campaigns]] in the late eighth century. Since 811, the northern frontier of Holstein (and thus the Empire) was marked by the [[Eider (river)|River Eider]].\n\nThe term Schleswig comes from the city of [[Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig]]. The name derives from the [[Schlei]] [[inlet]] in the east and ''vik'' meaning inlet in [[Old Norse]] or settlement in [[Old Saxon]], and linguistically identical ([[cognate]]) with the \"-wick\" or \"-wich\" element in place-names in [[Great Britain|Britain]].\n\nThe [[Duchy of Schleswig]] or Southern Jutland was originally an integral part of Denmark, but was in [[medieval]] times established as a [[fief]] under the Kingdom of Denmark, with the same relation to the [[Danish Royal Family|Danish Crown]] as for example [[Brandenburg]] or [[Bavaria]] vis-\u00e0-vis the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. Around 1100, the [[Duchy of Saxony|Duke of Saxony]] gave Holstein, as it was his own country, to [[Count]] [[Adolf I of Holstein|Adolf I]] of [[County of Schauenburg|Schauenburg]].\n\n===Duchies in the Danish realm===\n\nSchleswig and Holstein have at different times belonged in part or completely to either Denmark or Germany, or have been virtually independent of both nations. The exception is that Schleswig had never been part of Germany until the Second Schleswig War in 1864. For many centuries, the King of Denmark was both a Danish Duke of Schleswig and a German Duke of Holstein. Essentially, Schleswig was either integrated into Denmark or was a Danish fief, and Holstein was a German fief and once a sovereign state long ago. Both were for several centuries ruled by the kings of Denmark. In 1721, all of Schleswig was united as a single duchy under the king of Denmark, and the great powers of Europe confirmed in an international treaty that all future kings of Denmark should automatically become dukes of Schleswig, and consequently Schleswig would always follow the same order of succession as the one chosen in the Kingdom of Denmark. In the church, following the reformation, German was used in the southern part of Schleswig and Danish in the northern part. This would later prove decisive for shaping national sentiments in the population, as well as after 1814 when mandatory school education was introduced. The administration of both duchies was conducted in German, despite the fact that they were governed from Copenhagen (from 1523 by the ''German Chancellery'' which was in 1806 renamed ''Schleswig-Holstein Chancellery'').\n\n===Schleswig-Holstein Question===\n{{main|Schleswig-Holstein Question}}The [[Nationalism|German national awakening]] that followed the [[Napoleonic Wars]] gave rise to a strong popular movement in Holstein and [[Southern Schleswig]] for unification with a new [[Prussia]]n-dominated Germany. This development was paralleled by an equally strong Danish national awakening in Denmark and Northern Schleswig. This movement called for the complete reintegration of Schleswig into the Kingdom of Denmark and demanded an end to discrimination against [[Danes]] in Schleswig. The ensuing conflict is sometimes called the [[Schleswig-Holstein Question]]. In 1848, King [[Frederick VII of Denmark]] declared that he would grant Denmark a liberal constitution and the immediate goal for the Danish national movement was to ensure that this constitution would give rights to all Danes, i.e. not only to those in the Kingdom of Denmark, but also to Danes (and Germans) living in Schleswig. Furthermore, they demanded protection for the Danish language in Schleswig (the dominant language in almost a quarter of Schleswig had changed from Danish to German since the beginning of the 19th century).\n\nA [[liberalism|liberal]] [[constitution]] for Holstein was not seriously considered in [[Copenhagen]], since it was well known that the political [[\u00e9lite]] of Holstein were more conservative than Copenhagen's. Representatives of German-minded Schleswig-Holsteiners demanded that Schleswig and Holstein be unified and allowed its own constitution and that Schleswig join Holstein as a member of the [[German Confederation]]. These demands were rejected by the Danish government in 1848, and the Germans of Holstein and southern Schleswig rebelled. This began the [[First Schleswig War]] (1848\u201351), which ended in a Danish victory at [[Battle of Isted|Idstedt]].\n\nIn 1863, conflict broke out again when Frederick VII died without legitimate issue. According to the [[order of succession]] of Denmark and Schleswig, the crowns of both Denmark and Schleswig would pass to Duke Christian of [[Duchy of Gl\u00fccksburg|Gl\u00fccksburg]], who became [[Christian IX of Denmark|Christian IX]]. The transmission of the duchy of Holstein to the head of the (German-oriented) branch of the Danish royal family, the [[House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg|House of Augustenborg]], was more controversial. The separation of the two duchies was challenged by the Augustenborg heir, who claimed, as in 1848, to be rightful heir of both Schleswig and Holstein. The promulgation of a common constitution for Denmark and Schleswig in November 1863 prompted [[Otto von Bismarck]] to intervene and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] declared war on Denmark. This was the [[Second War of Schleswig]], which ended in Danish defeat. [[United Kingdom|British]] attempts to mediate in the [[London Conference of 1864]] failed, and Denmark lost Schleswig (Northern and Southern Schleswig), Holstein, and [[Herzogtum Lauenburg|Lauenburg]] to Prussia and Austria.\n\n===Province of Prussia===\n\nContrary to the hopes of German Schleswig-Holsteiners, the area did not gain its independence, but was annexed as a province of Prussia in 1867. Also following the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866, section five of the [[Peace of Prague (1866)|Peace of Prague]] stipulated that the people of Northern Schleswig would be consulted in a [[referendum]] on whether to remain under Prussian rule or return to Danish rule. This condition, however, was never fulfilled by Prussia. During the decades of Prussian rule within the [[German Empire]], authorities attempted a [[Germanisation]] policy in the northern part of Schleswig, which remained predominantly Danish. The period also meant increased industrialisation of Schleswig-Holstein and the use of Kiel and Flensburg as important [[Imperial German Navy]] locations. The northernmost part and west coast of the province saw a wave of emigration to America, while some Danes of North Schleswig emigrated to Denmark.\n\n===Plebiscite in 1920===\n\nFollowing the defeat of Germany in [[World War I]], the Allied powers arranged [[Schleswig Plebiscites|a plebiscite in northern and central Schleswig]]. The plebiscite was conducted under the auspices of an international commission which designated two voting zones to cover the northern and south-central parts of Schleswig. Steps were taken to also create a third zone covering a southern area, but zone III was cancelled again and never voted, as the Danish government asked the commission not to expand the plebiscite to this area.\n\nIn zone I covering Northern Schleswig (10 February 1920), 75% voted for [[Political union|reunification]] with Denmark and 25% voted for Germany. In zone II covering central Schleswig (14 March 1920), the results were reversed; 80% voted for Germany and just 20% for Denmark. Only minor areas on the island of [[F\u00f6hr]] showed a Danish majority, and the rest of the Danish vote was primarily in the town of Flensburg.<ref>Schwedler, Frank: Historischer Atlas Schleswig-Holstein 1867 bis 1945, Wachholtz Verlag, Neum\u00fcnster</ref>\n[[File:Abstimmung-schleswig-1920.png|thumb|right|275px|Results of the 1920 plebiscites in North and Central Schleswig]]\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; font-size:95%\" \n|- style=\"text-align:center; background:lemonchiffon;\"\n| rowspan=\"2\"|'''Electorate'''\n| rowspan=\"2\"|'''German name'''\n| rowspan=\"2\"|'''Danish name'''\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:magenta\"|'''For Germany'''\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#99bbff\"|'''For Denmark'''\n|-style=\"text-align:center\"\n| style=\"background:lavenderblush\"|percent\n| style=\"background:lavenderblush\"|votes\n| style=\"background:aliceblue\"|percent\n| style=\"background:aliceblue\"|votes\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\"|\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow\"\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:lightyellow; text-align:center\"|'''Zone I''' (Northern Schleswig),  10 February 1920|| '''25.1''' %||'''25,329'''  ||'''74.9''' % ||'''75,431'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\"|\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"\n| District of\n| align=Left|Hadersleben\n| align=Left|[[Haderslev Municipality|Haderslev]]\n| 16.0% ||6,585 \n| 84.0% ||34,653 \n|-\n| Town of \n| Hadersleben \n| [[Haderslev]]\n| 38.6% ||3,275\n| 61.4% ||5,209 \n|-\n| colspan=\"7\"|\n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee\"\n| District of\n| align=left|Apenrade || align=left| [[Aabenraa Municipality|Aabenraa]]\n| 32.3% ||6,030 \n| 67.7% ||12,653\n|-\n| Town of\n| Apenrade|| [[Aabenraa]]\n| 55.1% ||2,725 \n| 44.9% ||2,224 \n|-\n| colspan=\"7\"|\n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"\n| District of \n|  align=left|Sonderburg ||  align=left|[[S\u00f8nderborg Municipality|S\u00f8nderborg]]\n| 22.9% ||5,083 \n| 77.1% ||17,100\n|-\n| Town of \n| Sonderburg || [[S\u00f8nderborg]]\n| 56.2% ||2,601\n| 43.8%||2,029 \n|-\n| Town of\n| Augustenburg ||[[Augustenborg, Denmark|Augustenborg]]\n| 48.0% || 236 \n| 52.0% || 256\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\"|\n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"\n| Northern part of District of\n|  align=left|Tondern ||  align=left|[[T\u00f8nder Municipality|T\u00f8nder]]\n| 40.9% || 7,083\n| 59.1% || 10,223 \n|- \n| Town of\n| Tondern || [[T\u00f8nder]]\n| 76.5% || 2,448 \n| 23.5% || 750 \n|-\n| Town of\n| Hoyer || [[H\u00f8jer]]\n| 72.6% || 581\n| 27.4% || 219 \n|-\n| Town of \n| L\u00fcgumkloster || [[L\u00f8gumkloster]]\n| 48.8% || 516\n| 51.2% || 542 \n|-\n| colspan=\"7\"|\n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"\n| Northern part of District of\n|  align=left|[[Flensburg]] ||  align=left|Flensborg\n| 40.6% || 548 \n| 59.4% || 802 \n|-\n| colspan=\"7\"|\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center; \"|'''Zone II''' (Central Schleswig), 14 March 1920||'''80.2''' % ||'''51,742'''||'''19.8''' %||'''12,800'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\"|\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"\n| Southern part of District of \n|  align=left|Tondern ||  align=left|[[T\u00f8nder]]\n| 87.9% || 17,283\n| 12.1% || 2,376 \n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"\n| Southern part of District of\n| align=left|[[Flensburg]] || align=left| Flensborg\n| 82.6% || 6,688 \n| 17.4% || 1,405\n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"\n|  Town of \n|  align=left|[[Flensburg]] ||  align=left|Flensborg\n| 75.2% || 27,081 \n| 24.8% || 8,944\n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"\n| Northern part of District of\n|  align=left|[[Husum]] ||  align=left|Husum\n| 90.0% || 672\n| 10.0% || 75 \n|-\n|}\n\nOn 15 June 1920, Northern Schleswig officially returned to Danish rule. The Danish/German border was the only one of the borders imposed on Germany by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] after World War I which was never challenged by [[Adolf Hitler]].\n\nIn 1937, the Nazis passed the so-called [[Greater Hamburg Act]] (''Gro\u00df-Hamburg-Gesetz''), where the nearby Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg was expanded, to encompass towns that had formerly belonged to the Prussian [[province of Schleswig-Holstein]]. To compensate Prussia for these losses (and partly because Hitler had a personal dislike for [[L\u00fcbeck]]<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/citybreaks/5428909/Lubeck-The-town-that-said-no-to-Hitler.html \"L\u00fcbeck: The town that said no to Hitler\"], Simon Heffer, www.telegraph.co.uk, Retrieved 2010-06-28.</ref>), the 711-year-long independence of the Hansestadt L\u00fcbeck came to an end, and almost all its territory was incorporated into Schleswig-Holstein.\n\n===State of Federal Germany===\n\nAfter [[World War II]], the Prussian province Schleswig-Holstein came under British occupation. On 23 August 1946, the military government abolished the province and reconstituted it as a separate ''Land''.<ref>Ordinance No. 46, {{cite web|url= http://www.lwl.org/westfaelische-geschichte/que/normal/que1167.pdf |title=''Abolition of the Provinces in the British Zone of the Former State of Prussia and Reconstitution thereof as Separate L\u00e4nder'' }}&nbsp;{{small|(218&nbsp;KB)}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u201350)|forced migrations of Germans between 1944 and 1950]], the population of Schleswig-Holstein increased by 33% (860,000 people).<ref>[http://www.hdg.de/lemo/html/Nachkriegsjahre/DasEndeAlsAnfang/fluchtUndVertreibung.html Flucht und Vertreibung] at [[Haus der Geschichte]] {{in lang|de}}</ref> A pro-Danish political movement arose in Schleswig, with transfer of the area to Denmark as an ultimate goal. This was supported neither by the British occupation administration nor the Danish government. In 1955, the German and Danish governments issued the [[Bonn-Copenhagen Declarations]] confirming the rights of the ethnic minorities on both sides of the border. Conditions between the nationalities have since been stable and generally respectful.\n\n==Geography==\n{{See also|List of places in Schleswig-Holstein}}\n[[File:Schleswig-Holstein.png|thumb|left|Topographic map of Schleswig-Holstein]]\n\nSchleswig-Holstein lies on the base of [[Jutland Peninsula]] between the [[North Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea]]. Strictly speaking, \"Schleswig\" refers to the German Southern Schleswig ({{lang-de|S\u00fcdschleswig}} or ''Landesteil Schleswig'', {{lang-da|Sydslesvig}}), whereas Northern Schleswig is in Denmark ([[South Jutland County]], [[Region of Southern Denmark]]). The state of Schleswig-Holstein further consists of Holstein, as well as [[Lauenburg]] and the formerly independent city of L\u00fcbeck.\n\nSchleswig-Holstein borders Denmark ([[Region of Southern Denmark|Southern Denmark]]) to the north, the North Sea to the west, the Baltic Sea to the east, and the German states of [[Lower Saxony]], [[Hamburg]], and [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] to the south.\n\nIn the western part of the state, the lowlands have virtually no hills. The [[North Frisian Islands]], as well as almost all of Schleswig-Holstein's North Sea coast, form the [[Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park]] (''Nationalpark Schleswig-Holsteinisches Wattenmeer'') which is the largest national park in Central Europe. Germany's only high-sea island, [[Heligoland]], is situated in the North Sea.\n\nThe Baltic Sea coast in the east of Schleswig-Holstein is marked by bays, [[fjord]]s, and cliff lines. Rolling hills (the highest elevation is the Bungsberg at {{convert|168|m|disp=or}}) and many lakes are found, especially in the eastern part of Holstein called the [[Holstein Switzerland]] and the former Duchy of Lauenburg (''Herzogtum Lauenburg''). [[Fehmarn]] is the only island off the eastern coast. The longest river besides the [[Elbe]] is the [[Eider (river)|Eider]]; the most important waterway is the [[Kiel Canal]] which connects the North Sea and Baltic Sea.\n\n===Administration===\n[[File:Schleswig-Holstein Kreise (nummeriert).svg|thumb|Districts of Schleswig-Holstein]]\n\nSchleswig-Holstein is divided into 11 [[Districts of Germany|''Kreise'']] (districts):\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n# [[Dithmarschen]]\n# [[Herzogtum Lauenburg|Lauenburg]] (formally ''Herzogtum Lauenburg'' or \"Duchy of Lauenburg\")\n# [[Nordfriesland]]\n# [[Ostholstein]]\n# [[Pinneberg (district)|Pinneberg]]\n# [[Pl\u00f6n (district)|Pl\u00f6n]]\n# [[Rendsburg-Eckernf\u00f6rde]]\n# [[Schleswig-Flensburg]]\n# [[Segeberg]]\n# [[Steinburg]]\n# [[Stormarn (district)|Stormarn]]\n}}\n\nFurthermore, the four separate [[Stadtbezirk|urban districts]] are:\n\n# KI &nbsp; - [[Kiel]]\n# HL &nbsp; - ''Hansestadt'' (\"Hanseatic town\") [[L\u00fcbeck]]\n# NMS - [[Neum\u00fcnster]]\n# FL &nbsp; - [[Flensburg]]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{historical populations|13=1960|14=2,309,409|15=1970|16=2,510,608|17=1980|18=2,611,285|19=1990|20=2,626,127|21=2000|22=2,789,761|23=2010|24=2,834,259|25=2018|26=2,896,900|percentages=pagr|footnote=source:<ref>[https://www.destatis.de/DE/Home/_inhalt.html Statistisches Bundesamt]</ref>}}\n\nSchleswig-Holstein has an aging population.

The castles and manors in the countryside are the best example for this tradition; some dishes like [[R\u00f8dgr\u00f8d]] ({{lang-de|Rote Gr\u00fctze}}, literal English \"red [[grits]]\" or \"red [[groats]]\") are also shared, as well as surnames such as [[Hansen (surname)|Hansen]].\n\nThe most important festivals are the Kiel Week, [[Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival]], an annual classic music festival all over the state, and the [[L\u00fcbeck Nordic Film Days]], an annual film festival for movies from [[Scandinavia]]n countries, held in L\u00fcbeck.\n\nThe annual [[Wacken Open Air]] festival is considered to be the largest heavy metal rock festival in the world.\n\nThe state's most important museum of cultural history is in [[Gottorf Castle]] in Schleswig.\n\nThe Wagnerian tenor [[Klaus Florian Vogt]] is from Schleswig - Holstein.\n\n===Symbols===\nThe [[coat of arms]] shows the symbols of the two duchies united in Schleswig-Holstein, i.e., the two lions for Schleswig and the leaf of a nettle for Holstein. Supposedly, [[Otto von Bismarck]] decreed that the two lions were to face the nettle because of the discomfort to their bottoms which would have resulted if the lions faced away from it.\n\nThe motto of Schleswig-Holstein is ''\"Up ewich ungedeelt\"'' ([[Middle Low German]]: \"Forever undivided\", modern High German: ''\"Auf ewig ungeteilt\"''). It goes back to the Vertrag von Ripen or Handfeste von Ripen (Danish: Ribe H\u00e5ndf\u00e6stning) or [[Treaty of Ribe]] in 1460. Ripen (Ribe) is a historical small town at the North Sea coast in Northern Schleswig. See [[History of Schleswig-Holstein]].\n\nThe anthem from 1844 is called \"[[Wanke nicht, mein Vaterland]]\" (\"Don't falter, my fatherland\"), but it is usually referred to with its first line ''\"Schleswig-Holstein meerumschlungen\"'' (i.e., \"Schleswig-Holstein embraced by the seas\") or \"Schleswig-Holstein-Lied\" (Schleswig-Holstein song).\n\nThe old city of L\u00fcbeck is a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]].\n\n===Languages===\n[[Danish language|Danish]], [[German language|German]], [[Low German]] and [[North Frisian language|North Frisian]] are the official languages of the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsyd.dk/artikel/283864:Dansk-er-blevet-officielt-sprog-i-Slesvig|website=tvsyd.dk|title=Dansk er blevet officielt sprog i Slesvig|date=14 May 2015|first=J\u00f8rgen|last=Nygaard|language=da}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, Low German (in Holstein and the South of Schleswig), Danish (in Schleswig), and North Frisian (in North Frisia in Western Schleswig) were spoken. During the language change in the 19th century some Danish and North Frisian dialects in Southern Schleswig were replaced by German.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bock|first1=Karl N.|title=Mittelniederdeutsch und heutiges Plattdeutsch im ehemaligen D\u00e4nischen Herzogtum Schleswig.

[[Missingsch]], a Low German dialect with heavy [[High German]] ([[Standard German]]) influence, is commonly spoken informally throughout the state, while a [[mixed language]] [[Petuh]] (mixture of High German and [[Danish language|Danish]]) is used in and around [[Flensburg]]. Danish is used by the [[Danish minority of Southern Schleswig|Danish minority]] in Southern Schleswig, and [[North Frisian]] is spoken by the [[North Frisians]] of the [[North Sea Coast]] and the Northern Frisian Islands in [[Southern Schleswig]]. The North Frisian dialect called [[Heligolandic dialect|Heligolandic]] (''Halunder'') is spoken on the island of [[Heligoland]].\n\nAs is the case throughout Germany, [[High German languages|High German]], introduced in the 16th century, has come to steadily replace local dialects for official purposes, and is today the predominant language of media, law and legislature. It is spoken by virtually all inhabitants in formal situations. Since the end of [[World War II]] and widespread adoption of [[TV]] and [[radio]] and other [[mass media]], it has gradually come to supplant local dialects in urban areas as well.\n\n==Economy==\nThe [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the state was 62.7 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 1.9% of German economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 30,400 euros or 101% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 95% of the EU average.

This might involve:\n* [[Fact-checking]] statements of public officials and corporate executives.\n* [[Interviewing]] public figures and challenging them with problems or concerns.\n* [[Beat reporting]] to gather information from meetings that members of the public might not otherwise attend, and to observe \"on the ground\" in broader society\n* [[Investigative journalism]], which involves information-gathering on a single story for a long period of time\n\nLike a literal [[guard dog]] that barks when it notices an intruder, a \"watchdog\" role involves alerting others when a problem is detected.  Common subjects are the government decision-making process, corporate fraud, illegal activity, immorality, [[consumer protection]] issues, and [[environmental degradation]].\n\nWatchdog journalism can be located in a variety of [[news media]], such as [[Radio broadcasting|radio]], [[television]], [[Internet]], and [[print media]] where it may be seen as \"a unique strength of newspapers\",<ref>Ward 2005</ref> and additional new media and concepts such as [[Blog|weblogs]] and [[citizen journalism]]. Watchdog journalists also are called \"watchmen\",<ref>Hanitzsch 2007, p.373</ref> \"agents of social control\", or \"moral guardians\".<ref>Berger 2000, 84</ref>\n\n== Role ==\nThe role of a watchdog journalist can be that of a protector or guardian. The role of a watchdog journalist as a guardian is to supply the citizens with information they must have \"to prevent the abuse of power\",<ref>Marder, 1998b, p.20</ref> and to \"warn citizens about those that are doing them harm\".<ref>Coronel, 2008, p. 3</ref> In order to conduct their role as a watchdog, journalists need to have a certain distance from the powers and challenge them,<ref>Hanitzsch, 2007, p 373</ref> as opposed to \"[[propagandist]]\" journalists,<ref>Pasti 2005, p.95</ref> who are loyal to the ruling powers and elites. Because of the power distance and its overseeing function, watchdog journalism often officiates as the [[fourth estate]],<ref>Hanitzsch 2007, p 373</ref> or is used in the context of that term.<ref name=\"auto\">Berger 2000, p.84</ref> The array of topics for watchdog journalism is wide and includes \"personal scandals, financial wrongdoing, [[political corruption]], enrichment in [[public office]], and other types of wrongdoing\".<ref name=\"auto1\">Coronel 2008, p. 2</ref> In order to expose wrongdoings the watchdog aims at \"finding hidden evidence\".<ref>Overholser & Jamieson 2005, p.170</ref> The aforementioned aspects are necessary for the role of the watchdog journalist to help \"maintain order\" and \"warn against disorder\".<ref>Gans 1979, p.295</ref>\n\n=== Three dimension of operationalization ===\nThe press working as a watchdog has been one of the fundamental components of a democratic society.

To do this, either journalists\u2019 own voice or a third party is needed. A detached orientation likely involves third parties to voice the questioning, denunciation, and criticism, whereas an interventionist orientation consists of journalists who disclose scrutiny themselves.\n* Source of news event: It refers the type of events that prompt the question, denunciation, and criticism. A detached orientation would likely cover judiciary processes or external investigations or dossiers from third parties.<ref name=\":0\" /> An interventionist orientation of watchdog reporting would consist of journalists who actively seek and disclose corruptions or who explicitly unveil conflicts by confronting established powers and acknowledging existing antagonistic relationship between the media, including individual journalists, and political actors.<ref>{{Citation|chapter=Trump, Journalists, and Social Networks of Trust|date=2018|publisher=The MIT Press|doi=10.7551/mitpress/11464.003.0029|isbn=978-0-262-34661-0|title=Trump and the Media}}</ref>\n\n=== Predictors of watchdog role performance ===\n\nDepending on the differences in social and organizational level, performance of journalistic roles also changes. In turn, there are a few factors that are more likely to have an influence over the type of watchdog performance in the journalism, the news in other words.\n\n*[[Democracy]]: Watchdog journalism can work effectively in well-established democratic countries. This is because in such countries, there is high level of the freedom of the press and journalistic autonomy and independent.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hallin, Daniel C.

For instance, in China, market newspaper is more likely to play a role as the watchdog journalism, while official newspaper, which is used to publicize the policy, announcement, or interests of government, does not.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Haiyan|last2=Sparks|first2=Colin|last3=Huang|first3=Yu|date=September 2018|title=Measuring differences in the Chinese press: A study of People's Daily and Southern Metropolitan Daily|journal=Global Media and China|volume=3|issue=3|pages=125\u2013140|doi=10.1177/2059436418806022|issn=2059-4364}}</ref> At this point, there is a huge difference in reporting styles between popular press and elite press.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Skovsgaard|first=Morten|last2=Alb\u00e6k|first2=Erik|last3=Bro|first3=Peter|last4=de Vreese|first4=Claes|date=2012-04-13|title=A reality check: How journalists' role perceptions impact their implementation of the objectivity norm|journal=Journalism: Theory, Practice & Criticism|volume=14|issue=1|pages=22\u201342|doi=10.1177/1464884912442286|issn=1464-8849}}</ref>\n* Media political leaning: The political orientation of the press is closely associated to the performance of watchdog journalism.

(2017) found in five Latin American countries, the media that serves the interests of the right or of the moderation is less likely to work as the watchdog journalism than the media serving interests of left party do.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mellado|first=Claudia|last2=Hellmueller|first2=Lea|last3=M\u00e1rquez-Ram\u00edrez|first3=Mireya|last4=Humanes|first4=Maria Luisa|last5=Sparks|first5=Colin|last6=Stepinska|first6=Agnieszka|last7=Pasti|first7=Svetlana|last8=Schielicke|first8=Anna-Maria|last9=Tandoc|first9=Edson|last10=Wang|first10=Haiyan|date=2017-11-02|title=The Hybridization of Journalistic Cultures: A Comparative Study of Journalistic Role Performance|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=67|issue=6|pages=944\u2013967|doi=10.1111/jcom.12339|issn=0021-9916}}</ref> In addition, biased tendency of the media has a great impact on the coverage of the political issues or scandal. \n* News beats: The performance of the watchdog journalism is influenced by journalistic specialization.

The study detected four global professional milieus of journalists: the populist disseminator, detached watchdog, critical change agent, and the opportunist facilitator.<ref>http://www.worldsofjournalism.org/index.htm</ref> The detached watchdog is an absolutely \"detached observer\".<ref name=\"auto2\">Hanitzsch 2011, p.485</ref> In addition to the watchdog functions described earlier, the detached watchdog is not interventionist, but uninvolved. In order to achieve that status he has to be objective, neutral, and impartial.<ref>Hanitzsch  2011, p.481</ref> Still, because of his watchdog function, he articulates his \"skeptical and critical attitude towards the government and business elites\".<ref>Hanitzsch 2011, p.486</ref> The detached watchdog milieu is accredited as the most prototypical of western journalism.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Countries where this milieu predominated at the time of the study were Germany, Austria, United States, Switzerland, and Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsofjournalism.org|title=The Worlds of Journalism Study|author=|date=|website=The Worlds of Journalism Study|accessdate=10 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the detached approach, criticism and questioning by sources are the least intense levels of scrutiny.

In this regard, one of the characteristics that distinguishes between detached and interventionist watchdog journalism, the other type of approaches, is the events that journalism deal with.<ref name=\":1\" /> The type of event that prompts the journalism to do its job by questioning, criticizing, and denunciationing is different based on the approaches.

A well-known example is the reporting of [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] on the [[Watergate]] scandal for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and the subsequent resignation of U.S. president [[Richard Nixon]] in 1974. Another more recent example took place in the Philippines, where president [[Joseph Estrada]] was arrested and resigned in 2001. The daily newspaper, ''Pinoy Times'', covered the case of Estrada till \"the ouster of Estrada\".<ref>Mojares 2006, p.8</ref>\nIn a country that guarantees freedom of the press, watchdog journalism can be \"a highly effective mechanism of external control on corruption\".<ref>Brunetti & Weder 2003, p.1804</ref> Yet, the mechanisms of watchdog journalism can also work in countries that abridge freedom of the press. A journalist in authoritarian contexts might not be able to cover all topics, but can still find an important journalistic niche. For example, in China where free press is still not established or guaranteed \"the notion of the press as watchdogs of power is embedded in the self-definition of journalists\".<ref>Coronel 2008, p. 1</ref> Here it makes a difference at whom the critique is directed. Journalists are able to criticize power abuse by individuals even when criticism pointed at major state policies is frowned upon and not feasible for established journalists.<ref>Yuezhi 2000, p.589</ref> In free societies \"the idea of the media as the eyes and ears\" of the public is widely accepted.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n[[File:Bob Woodward.jpg|thumb|239x239px|Bob Woodward, the investigative journalist of The Washington Post]]\n\n=== Washington Post's coverage of Watergate scandal ===\nThe [[Watergate scandal]] was one of the biggest political scandals in the United States.

What they were trying to do was to plant a bug for Richard Nixon\u2019s winning the re-election in exchange for receiving the cash.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Schudson|first=Michael|date=May 2004|title=Notes on Scandal and the Watergate Legacy|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|language=en|volume=47|issue=9|pages=1231\u20131238|doi=10.1177/0002764203262345|issn=0002-7642}}</ref> After 5 perpetrators were arrested, several revelation and investigation were progressed until 1973 and it made the House decide to commence an impeachment process against Nixon. The Oval Office tapes, the significant evidence of the Watergate scandal, revealed that Nixon tried to cover up what he did to win the re-election such as breaking-in and using federal officials. As a result, the impeachment against Richard Nixon was approved by the House judiciary committee.<ref name=\":2\" /> He resigned from all of offices on August 9, 1974.\n\n[[File:Carl bernstein 2007.jpg|thumb|233x233px|Carl Bernstein, the investigative journalist of The Washington Post]]\n\n=== The role of Washington Post as watchdog journalism in the case of Watergate scandal ===\nThe case of Watergate scandal is the most famous example showing the role of watchdog journalism as well as how it works and even further, its impact. The media, especially, The Washington Post, significantly contributed to highlight the fact that there\u2019s the connection between the breaking in the Watergate Office and Richard Nixon\u2019s re-election committee. In addition, its coverage led to an explosion of publicity and political and legal repercussions. To cover the scandal, anonymous sources became the main material that The Washington Post heavily relied on. Specifically, the Washington Post\u2019s investigative journalists named [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] played a really important role. They uncovered information and evidence that proved the break-in to plant a bug and attempts to conceal it which result in the intervention of the Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and the White House.<ref name=\":2\" /> In addition, they conducted interviews with a witness named [[Judy Hoback Miller]]. He was the book keep who worked at the Richard Nixon\u2019s re-election committed and had an evidence showing how Richard Nixon and his committee mishandled the funds and destroyed the records, the evidence of conspiracy.<ref name=\":2\" /> The most valuable and reliable anonymous sources came from person who didn\u2019t reveal his identity at the time and who was called Deep Throat by Woodward and Bernstein instead. Every meeting between investigative journalists of The Washington Post and Deep Throat was held secretly.<ref name=\":2\" /> And through these meetings, involvement of the Richard Nixon and his committee and the White House was revealed. It was revealed that Deep Throat, the anonymous informant, is the deputy director of the FBI during that period (period of the 1970s) named William Mark Felt, Sr.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Criticism ==\nThe concept of watchdog journalism is not free of criticism. The whole field of watchdog journalism has decreased over time and parts of journalism and in 2005 observers affirmed that the current period was \"not a time of rich watchdog reporting in any media\".<ref>Overholser & Jamieson 2005, p.178</ref> This comes with the framework and the problem that many journalists tend \"towards reflecting the status quo, rather than radically challenging it\".<ref name=\"auto\"/> This decrease, however, cannot lead to the presumption that there are not enough critical topics to write or report about. In fact, the opposite is the case, and there is enough material to work with.<ref>Overholser & Jamieson 2005, p.179</ref> While watchdog journalism in the U.S. helped to force Nixon out of office in 1974, the situation presented itself differently in 2003. During the [[Iraq War]] part of the established media turned out to take more of a \"pro-war attitude\",<ref name=\"auto3\">Kull, Ramsay, Lewis 2003, p.593</ref> without adequately fulfilling their function of a critical watchdog. Many professionals in the media \"appeared to feel that it was not their role to challenge the administration\".<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Critics direct the blame in part to the general public itself, however, since their interest in watchdog journalism is \"inconstant and fleeting at times\".<ref>Coronel  2008, p. 13</ref> They also see the role of watchdog journalism as \"driven by its own interests rather than by a desire to protect the public interest\".<ref>Kohut 2001, p.52</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Muckraking]]\n* [[Whistleblowing]]\n* [[Guardian Project (software)]]\n* [[Investigative journalism]]\n* [[Fake News]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/146167000361186 |title = Grave New World?

This might involve:\n* [[Fact-checking]] statements of public officials and corporate executives.\n* [[Interviewing]] public figures and challenging them with problems or concerns.\n* [[Beat reporting]] to gather information from meetings that members of the public might not otherwise attend, and to observe \"on the ground\" in broader society\n* [[Investigative journalism]], which involves information-gathering on a single story for a long period of time\n\nLike a literal [[guard dog]] that barks when it notices an intruder, a \"watchdog\" role involves alerting others when a problem is detected.  Common subjects are the government decision-making process, corporate fraud, illegal activity, immorality, [[consumer protection]] issues, and [[environmental degradation]].\n\nWatchdog journalism can be located in a variety of [[news media]], such as [[Radio broadcasting|radio]], [[television]], [[Internet]], and [[print media]] where it may be seen as \"a unique strength of newspapers\",<ref>Ward 2005</ref> and additional new media and concepts such as [[Blog|weblogs]] and [[citizen journalism]]. Watchdog journalists also are called \"watchmen\",<ref>Hanitzsch 2007, p.373</ref> \"agents of social control\", or \"moral guardians\".<ref>Berger 2000, 84</ref>\n\n== Role ==\nThe role of a watchdog journalist can be that of a protector or guardian. The role of a watchdog journalist as a guardian is to supply the citizens with information they must have \"to prevent the abuse of power\",<ref>Marder, 1998b, p.20</ref> and to \"warn citizens about those that are doing them harm\".<ref>Coronel, 2008, p. 3</ref> In order to conduct their role as a watchdog, journalists need to have a certain distance from the powers and challenge them,<ref>Hanitzsch, 2007, p 373</ref> as opposed to \"[[propagandist]]\" journalists,<ref>Pasti 2005, p.95</ref> who are loyal to the ruling powers and elites. Because of the power distance and its overseeing function, watchdog journalism often officiates as the [[fourth estate]],<ref>Hanitzsch 2007, p 373</ref> or is used in the context of that term.<ref name=\"auto\">Berger 2000, p.84</ref> The array of topics for watchdog journalism is wide and includes \"personal scandals, financial wrongdoing, [[political corruption]], enrichment in [[public office]], and other types of wrongdoing\".<ref name=\"auto1\">Coronel 2008, p. 2</ref> In order to expose wrongdoings the watchdog aims at \"finding hidden evidence\".<ref>Overholser & Jamieson 2005, p.170</ref> The aforementioned aspects are necessary for the role of the watchdog journalist to help \"maintain order\" and \"warn against disorder\".<ref>Gans 1979, p.295</ref>\n\n=== Three dimension of operationalization ===\nThe press working as a watchdog has been one of the fundamental components of a democratic society.

To do this, either journalists\u2019 own voice or a third party is needed. A detached orientation likely involves third parties to voice the questioning, denunciation, and criticism, whereas an interventionist orientation consists of journalists who disclose scrutiny themselves.\n* Source of news event: It refers the type of events that prompt the question, denunciation, and criticism. A detached orientation would likely cover judiciary processes or external investigations or dossiers from third parties.<ref name=\":0\" /> An interventionist orientation of watchdog reporting would consist of journalists who actively seek and disclose corruptions or who explicitly unveil conflicts by confronting established powers and acknowledging existing antagonistic relationship between the media, including individual journalists, and political actors.<ref>{{Citation|chapter=Trump, Journalists, and Social Networks of Trust|date=2018|publisher=The MIT Press|doi=10.7551/mitpress/11464.003.0029|isbn=978-0-262-34661-0|title=Trump and the Media}}</ref>\n\n=== Predictors of watchdog role performance ===\n\nDepending on the differences in social and organizational level, performance of journalistic roles also changes. In turn, there are a few factors that are more likely to have an influence over the type of watchdog performance in the journalism, the news in other words.\n\n*[[Democracy]]: Watchdog journalism can work effectively in well-established democratic countries. This is because in such countries, there is high level of the freedom of the press and journalistic autonomy and independent.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hallin, Daniel C.

For instance, in China, market newspaper is more likely to play a role as the watchdog journalism, while official newspaper, which is used to publicize the policy, announcement, or interests of government, does not.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Haiyan|last2=Sparks|first2=Colin|last3=Huang|first3=Yu|date=September 2018|title=Measuring differences in the Chinese press: A study of People's Daily and Southern Metropolitan Daily|journal=Global Media and China|volume=3|issue=3|pages=125\u2013140|doi=10.1177/2059436418806022|issn=2059-4364}}</ref> At this point, there is a huge difference in reporting styles between popular press and elite press.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Skovsgaard|first=Morten|last2=Alb\u00e6k|first2=Erik|last3=Bro|first3=Peter|last4=de Vreese|first4=Claes|date=2012-04-13|title=A reality check: How journalists' role perceptions impact their implementation of the objectivity norm|journal=Journalism: Theory, Practice & Criticism|volume=14|issue=1|pages=22\u201342|doi=10.1177/1464884912442286|issn=1464-8849}}</ref>\n* Media political leaning: The political orientation of the press is closely associated to the performance of watchdog journalism. To be specific, according to what Mellado et al. (2017) found in five Latin American countries, the media that serves the interests of the right or of the moderation is less likely to work as the watchdog journalism than the media serving interests of left party do.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mellado|first=Claudia|last2=Hellmueller|first2=Lea|last3=M\u00e1rquez-Ram\u00edrez|first3=Mireya|last4=Humanes|first4=Maria Luisa|last5=Sparks|first5=Colin|last6=Stepinska|first6=Agnieszka|last7=Pasti|first7=Svetlana|last8=Schielicke|first8=Anna-Maria|last9=Tandoc|first9=Edson|last10=Wang|first10=Haiyan|date=2017-11-02|title=The Hybridization of Journalistic Cultures: A Comparative Study of Journalistic Role Performance|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=67|issue=6|pages=944\u2013967|doi=10.1111/jcom.12339|issn=0021-9916}}</ref> In addition, biased tendency of the media has a great impact on the coverage of the political issues or scandal. \n* News beats: The performance of the watchdog journalism is influenced by journalistic specialization. For instance, based on what Reich (2012) found, journalists who deal with political issues are highly likely to act as watchdogs than ones who cover business issues.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reich|first=Zvi|date=2011-09-20|title=Different Practices, Similar Logic|journal=The International Journal of Press/Politics|volume=17|issue=1|pages=76\u201399|doi=10.1177/1940161211420868|issn=1940-1612}}</ref> Similar tendency appears in other countries including China, Chile, and Spain.

The study comparatively surveyed 2100 active journalists worldwide.<ref>Worlds of Journalism, Pilot Study. http://www.worldsofjournalism.org/pilot.htm</ref> It exists next to the idea of a journalist as a populist disseminator, critical change agent or opportunist facilitator.<ref>Hanitzsch 2011</ref>\n\nThe goal of the study was to create a better understanding of [[journalism culture]] and journalistic views. The study detected four global professional milieus of journalists: the populist disseminator, detached watchdog, critical change agent, and the opportunist facilitator.<ref>http://www.worldsofjournalism.org/index.htm</ref> The detached watchdog is an absolutely \"detached observer\".<ref name=\"auto2\">Hanitzsch 2011, p.485</ref> In addition to the watchdog functions described earlier, the detached watchdog is not interventionist, but uninvolved. In order to achieve that status he has to be objective, neutral, and impartial.<ref>Hanitzsch  2011, p.481</ref> Still, because of his watchdog function, he articulates his \"skeptical and critical attitude towards the government and business elites\".<ref>Hanitzsch 2011, p.486</ref> The detached watchdog milieu is accredited as the most prototypical of western journalism.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Countries where this milieu predominated at the time of the study were Germany, Austria, United States, Switzerland, and Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsofjournalism.org|title=The Worlds of Journalism Study|author=|date=|website=The Worlds of Journalism Study|accessdate=10 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the detached approach, criticism and questioning by sources are the least intense levels of scrutiny. The detached watchdog journalism generally consists of third parties and sources that voices the questioning, criticism and denunciation.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=M\u00e1rquez-Ram\u00edrez|first=Mireya|last2=Mellado|first2=Claudia|last3=Humanes|first3=Mar\u00eda Luisa|last4=Amado|first4=Adriana|last5=Beck|first5=Daniel|last6=Davydov|first6=Sergey|last7=Mick|first7=Jacques|last8=Mothes|first8=Cornelia|last9=Olivera|first9=Dasniel|last10=Panagiotu|first10=Nikos|last11=Roses|first11=Sergio|date=2019-09-06|title=Detached or Interventionist?

In this regard, one of the characteristics that distinguishes between detached and interventionist watchdog journalism, the other type of approaches, is the events that journalism deal with.<ref name=\":1\" /> The type of event that prompts the journalism to do its job by questioning, criticizing, and denunciationing is different based on the approaches. Within liberal media systems, the phenomenon that journalists are more likely to take the detached watchdog journalism approach can be seen because of liberal media systems\u2019 features such as the traditional of factuality and objectivity.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Indicator of detached orientation and operationalization ===\n\n* Questioning by sources: People other than journalists can question individuals or people with power through quotes, statements, and opinions.<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Criticism by sources: Individuals and people with power can be criticized in the form of quotes, statements, and negative opinion by people other than journalists.<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Denunciation by sources: People other than the journalists can provide testimony or evidence about something individuals or those with power do and say.<ref name=\":1\" />\n* External investigation: Some topics such as judicial, administrative, and specialized/academic research are often investigated and included by the news story even though journalists do not cover them directly.<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Questioning by the journalist: Journalists can do their jobs by asking and questioning the validity and truthfulness of what individuals or people with power do.<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Criticism by the journalist: The journalists can negatively judge and condemn what individuals or people with power do by making assertions.<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Denunciation by the journalist: The journalists can denounce and accuse something that is hidden illegally by individuals or people with power through making assertions.<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Reporting of conflict: The journalists can call a source, an institution, or people that have to be investigated to the public.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== In practice ==\n[[File:The Logo of The Washington Post Newspaper.svg|thumb|251x251px|The logo of the Washington Post]]\nWatchdog journalism can lead to the successful resignation of power holders. A well-known example is the reporting of [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] on the [[Watergate]] scandal for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and the subsequent resignation of U.S. president [[Richard Nixon]] in 1974. Another more recent example took place in the Philippines, where president [[Joseph Estrada]] was arrested and resigned in 2001. The daily newspaper, ''Pinoy Times'', covered the case of Estrada till \"the ouster of Estrada\".<ref>Mojares 2006, p.8</ref>\nIn a country that guarantees freedom of the press, watchdog journalism can be \"a highly effective mechanism of external control on corruption\".<ref>Brunetti & Weder 2003, p.1804</ref> Yet, the mechanisms of watchdog journalism can also work in countries that abridge freedom of the press. A journalist in authoritarian contexts might not be able to cover all topics, but can still find an important journalistic niche. For example, in China where free press is still not established or guaranteed \"the notion of the press as watchdogs of power is embedded in the self-definition of journalists\".<ref>Coronel 2008, p. 1</ref> Here it makes a difference at whom the critique is directed. Journalists are able to criticize power abuse by individuals even when criticism pointed at major state policies is frowned upon and not feasible for established journalists.<ref>Yuezhi 2000, p.589</ref> In free societies \"the idea of the media as the eyes and ears\" of the public is widely accepted.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n[[File:Bob Woodward.jpg|thumb|239x239px|Bob Woodward, the investigative journalist of The Washington Post]]\n\n=== Washington Post's coverage of Watergate scandal ===\nThe [[Watergate scandal]] was one of the biggest political scandals in the United States. It involved [[Richard Nixon]], the 37th president of the United States and led him to resignation. This scandal stemmed from the attempts of 5 former [[FBI]] and [[CIA]] agents broke in the Democratic National Committee headquarters which is located at the [[Watergate Office Building]], Washington D.C. What they were trying to do was to plant a bug for Richard Nixon\u2019s winning the re-election in exchange for receiving the cash.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Schudson|first=Michael|date=May 2004|title=Notes on Scandal and the Watergate Legacy|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|language=en|volume=47|issue=9|pages=1231\u20131238|doi=10.1177/0002764203262345|issn=0002-7642}}</ref> After 5 perpetrators were arrested, several revelation and investigation were progressed until 1973 and it made the House decide to commence an impeachment process against Nixon. The Oval Office tapes, the significant evidence of the Watergate scandal, revealed that Nixon tried to cover up what he did to win the re-election such as breaking-in and using federal officials. As a result, the impeachment against Richard Nixon was approved by the House judiciary committee.<ref name=\":2\" /> He resigned from all of offices on August 9, 1974.\n\n[[File:Carl bernstein 2007.jpg|thumb|233x233px|Carl Bernstein, the investigative journalist of The Washington Post]]\n\n=== The role of Washington Post as watchdog journalism in the case of Watergate scandal ===\nThe case of Watergate scandal is the most famous example showing the role of watchdog journalism as well as how it works and even further, its impact. The media, especially, The Washington Post, significantly contributed to highlight the fact that there\u2019s the connection between the breaking in the Watergate Office and Richard Nixon\u2019s re-election committee. In addition, its coverage led to an explosion of publicity and political and legal repercussions. To cover the scandal, anonymous sources became the main material that The Washington Post heavily relied on. Specifically, the Washington Post\u2019s investigative journalists named [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] played a really important role. They uncovered information and evidence that proved the break-in to plant a bug and attempts to conceal it which result in the intervention of the Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and the White House.<ref name=\":2\" /> In addition, they conducted interviews with a witness named [[Judy Hoback Miller]]. He was the book keep who worked at the Richard Nixon\u2019s re-election committed and had an evidence showing how Richard Nixon and his committee mishandled the funds and destroyed the records, the evidence of conspiracy.<ref name=\":2\" /> The most valuable and reliable anonymous sources came from person who didn\u2019t reveal his identity at the time and who was called Deep Throat by Woodward and Bernstein instead. Every meeting between investigative journalists of The Washington Post and Deep Throat was held secretly.<ref name=\":2\" /> And through these meetings, involvement of the Richard Nixon and his committee and the White House was revealed. It was revealed that Deep Throat, the anonymous informant, is the deputy director of the FBI during that period (period of the 1970s) named William Mark Felt, Sr.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Criticism ==\nThe concept of watchdog journalism is not free of criticism. The whole field of watchdog journalism has decreased over time and parts of journalism and in 2005 observers affirmed that the current period was \"not a time of rich watchdog reporting in any media\".<ref>Overholser & Jamieson 2005, p.178</ref> This comes with the framework and the problem that many journalists tend \"towards reflecting the status quo, rather than radically challenging it\".<ref name=\"auto\"/> This decrease, however, cannot lead to the presumption that there are not enough critical topics to write or report about. In fact, the opposite is the case, and there is enough material to work with.<ref>Overholser & Jamieson 2005, p.179</ref> While watchdog journalism in the U.S. helped to force Nixon out of office in 1974, the situation presented itself differently in 2003. During the [[Iraq War]] part of the established media turned out to take more of a \"pro-war attitude\",<ref name=\"auto3\">Kull, Ramsay, Lewis 2003, p.593</ref> without adequately fulfilling their function of a critical watchdog. Many professionals in the media \"appeared to feel that it was not their role to challenge the administration\".<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Critics direct the blame in part to the general public itself, however, since their interest in watchdog journalism is \"inconstant and fleeting at times\".<ref>Coronel  2008, p. 13</ref> They also see the role of watchdog journalism as \"driven by its own interests rather than by a desire to protect the public interest\".<ref>Kohut 2001, p.52</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Muckraking]]\n* [[Whistleblowing]]\n* [[Guardian Project (software)]]\n* [[Investigative journalism]]\n* [[Fake News]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/146167000361186 |title = Grave New World?
