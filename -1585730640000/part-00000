While there is no well-agreed-upon date used to indicate the start of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, there are two definitions of winter which may be used. Based on the astronomical definition, winter begins at the [[winter solstice]], which in 2019 occurred on December&nbsp;21, and ends at the March equinox, which in 2020 will occur on March&nbsp;20.<ref name=\"USNO Seasons\">{{cite web|title=Earth's Seasons: Equinoxes, Solstices, Perihelion, and Aphelion, 2000-2025 |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/EarthSeasons.php |publisher=[[United States Naval Observatory]] |date=March 27, 2015 |accessdate=August 15, 2015 |location=[[Washington, D.C.]] |format=PHP |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6anEZkLaj?url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/EarthSeasons.php |archive-date=August 15, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> Based on the meteorological definition, the first day of winter is December 1 and the last day February 29.<ref name=\"NOAA/NWS-Seasons\">{{cite web|title=Meteorological vs. Astronomical Seasons|url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/news/meteorological-versus-astronomical-summer%E2%80%94what%E2%80%99s-difference|publisher=NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information|date=June 21, 2013|accessdate=July 3, 2015}}</ref> Both definitions involve a period of approximately three months, with some variability.

The [[El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation]] was in its neutral phase and was thus not expected to be a key predictor for the season. As a result, other oscillations such as the Madden\u2013Julian Oscillation and the Arctic Oscillation were anticipated to be more significant drivers of the seasonal weather, particularly in the form of large temperature and precipitation swings. From the outlook, the greatest likelihoods for above-normal temperatures were for Alaska and Hawaii, with lower but still above-normal odds of above-average temperatures for most of the lower 48 states. The exception was for the Northern Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, and western Great Lakes regions, which were ascribed equal changes for above-, near-, or below-average temperatures. No area in the United States was favored to have below-average temperatures. In terms of precipitation, wetter-than-average conditions were most likely in Alaska, Hawaii, part of the Northern Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S. Drier-than-average conditions were favored for Louisiana and parts of Texas, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, as well as parts of central and northern California, with the rest of the U.S. having equal changes of above-, near-, or below-average precipitation. The drought outlook highlighted the presence of abnormally dry conditions across much of the Southern U.S, with improvement expected in part of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, Alaska, and Hawaii. Drought was expected to persist in central Texas and the Southwestern U.S, with further development anticipated in parts of central California.<ref>{{cite news|title=Winter Outlook: Warmer than average for many, wetter in the North: Drought improvement expected in the Southeast|url=https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/winter-outlook-warmer-than-average-for-many-wetter-in-north|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=October 17, 2019|accessdate=October 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Events ==\n=== Early November winter storm ===\nRecord breaking temperatures and snowfall caused disruption throughout the Midwestern United States in early November.

The [[El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation]] was in its neutral phase and was thus not expected to be a key predictor for the season. As a result, other oscillations such as the Madden\u2013Julian Oscillation and the Arctic Oscillation were anticipated to be more significant drivers of the seasonal weather, particularly in the form of large temperature and precipitation swings. From the outlook, the greatest likelihoods for above-normal temperatures were for Alaska and Hawaii, with lower but still above-normal odds of above-average temperatures for most of the lower 48 states. The exception was for the Northern Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, and western Great Lakes regions, which were ascribed equal changes for above-, near-, or below-average temperatures. No area in the United States was favored to have below-average temperatures. In terms of precipitation, wetter-than-average conditions were most likely in Alaska, Hawaii, part of the Northern Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S. Drier-than-average conditions were favored for Louisiana and parts of Texas, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, as well as parts of central and northern California, with the rest of the U.S. having equal changes of above-, near-, or below-average precipitation. The drought outlook highlighted the presence of abnormally dry conditions across much of the Southern U.S, with improvement expected in part of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, Alaska, and Hawaii. Drought was expected to persist in central Texas and the Southwestern U.S, with further development anticipated in parts of central California.<ref>{{cite news|title=Winter Outlook: Warmer than average for many, wetter in the North: Drought improvement expected in the Southeast|url=https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/winter-outlook-warmer-than-average-for-many-wetter-in-north|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=October 17, 2019|accessdate=October 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Events ==\n=== Early November winter storm ===\nRecord breaking temperatures and snowfall caused disruption throughout the Midwestern United States in early November.

First admirals were mentioned in 14th century as commanders of the royal fleet of Croatian-Hungarian king [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]]. Officers from today's Croatia served in various navies in control of Croatia or its parts. For instance, [[Jusuf Ma\u0161kovi\u0107]] served as a [[Kapudan Pasha|grand admiral]] of Ottoman Navy in 1630s, just like [[Sinan Pasha (Ottoman admiral)|Sinan Pasha]] in 1530s; [[Ivan of Vrana]] was a Venetian admiral in late 16th century, taking part in the [[Battle of Lepanto]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=\u010corali\u0107|first=Lovorka|last2=Prijatelj Pavi\u010di\u0107|first2=Ivana|date=2005-12-01|title=Ivan iz Vrane \u2013 mleta\u010dki admiral u Lepantskom boju (1571.)|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/12728|journal=Povijesni prilozi|language=hr|volume=24|issue=29|pages=127\u2013149|issn=0351-9767}}</ref> Croatian personnel served in the [[Venetian navy|Venetian Navy]] until its demise in 1797 and, in modern times, in Habsburg/[[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] as Croatia was a constituent part of the monarchy (until 1918). First Croatian admirals distinguished themselves commanding Habsburg ships in [[First Italian War of Independence]] in 1848.\n\nCroatian admirals helped lead Austro-Hungarian Navy through [[Adriatic Campaign of World War I|World War I]] and later oversaw the creation and development of [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] in the interwar years (1918-1941). In World War II they found themselves on opposing sides, as some chose to collaborate and joined rather limited Navy of Independent State of Croatia (1941\u201345), while others founded guerilla [[Yugoslav Partisans#Partisan Navy|Partisan Navy]], which liberated the Croatian Adriatic and later developed into [[Yugoslav Navy]] (1942\u201391). Croatian admirals led Yugoslav Navy during the Cold War, overseeing its development of submarines and strengthening its capacities. After 1991, breaking off from Yugoslav Navy, Croatian admirals steered Croatian Navy through the [[Croatian War of Independence]] from Yugoslavia (1991-5).\n\nWhat follows is a list of naval officers '''from the territory of today's Republic of Croatia'''. For a list of admirals of the modern, post-1991 [[Croatian Navy]], see [[List of Croatian Navy admirals]]. [[Croats of Boka Kotorska|Historical Croat community in Boka Kotorska]] has produced a long line of admirals (Russian Grand admiral [[Matija Zmajevi\u0107]], Austrian vice-admiral [https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/BLK%C3%96:Bujacovich,_Alexander_Freiherr Aleksandar Bujakovi\u0107] (1792-1870) etc.), but these are excluded from this list.\n\n==Admiral flote==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horisontal\n| image1   = Zastava admirala flote OS RH.svg\n| caption1  = <center><small>1991\u2013</small></center>\n| width1     = 70\n| image2   = SFR Yugoslavia Fleet Admiral.svg\n| caption2  = <center><small>1956-91?\u2013</small></center>\n| width2     = 70\n| header    = <center>Rank Flag</center>\n| footer    = <center><span style=\"color:white;\">'''Admiral Flote'''</span></center>\n| footer_background = #007\n}}\n\nIn Yugoslav Navy, [[Branko Mamula]] was promoted to the rank of the Admiral of the Fleet in 1983. In [[Croatian Navy]], rank of Fleet Admiral was introduced in 1995 as the naval equivalent to the [[five-star rank]] of the  [[OF-10]]. Commending him on his role as the commander of Croatian Navy during the [[Croatian War of Independence|War of Independence]] (1991-5), president [[Franjo Tu\u0111man|Tu\u0111man]] conferred the rank on admiral Letica.

Officers from today's Croatia served in various navies in control of Croatia or its parts. For instance, [[Jusuf Ma\u0161kovi\u0107]] served as a [[Kapudan Pasha|grand admiral]] of Ottoman Navy in 1630s, just like [[Sinan Pasha (Ottoman admiral)|Sinan Pasha]] in 1530s; [[Ivan of Vrana]] was a Venetian admiral in late 16th century, taking part in the [[Battle of Lepanto]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=\u010corali\u0107|first=Lovorka|last2=Prijatelj Pavi\u010di\u0107|first2=Ivana|date=2005-12-01|title=Ivan iz Vrane \u2013 mleta\u010dki admiral u Lepantskom boju (1571.)|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/12728|journal=Povijesni prilozi|language=hr|volume=24|issue=29|pages=127\u2013149|issn=0351-9767}}</ref> Croatian personnel served in the [[Venetian navy|Venetian Navy]] until its demise in 1797 and, in modern times, in Habsburg/[[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] as Croatia was a constituent part of the monarchy (until 1918). First Croatian admirals distinguished themselves commanding Habsburg ships in [[First Italian War of Independence]] in 1848.\n\nCroatian admirals helped lead Austro-Hungarian Navy through [[Adriatic Campaign of World War I|World War I]] and later oversaw the creation and development of [[Royal Yugoslav Navy]] in the interwar years (1918-1941). In World War II they found themselves on opposing sides, as some chose to collaborate and joined rather limited Navy of Independent State of Croatia (1941\u201345), while others founded guerilla [[Yugoslav Partisans#Partisan Navy|Partisan Navy]], which liberated the Croatian Adriatic and later developed into [[Yugoslav Navy]] (1942\u201391). Croatian admirals led Yugoslav Navy during the Cold War, overseeing its development of submarines and strengthening its capacities. After 1991, breaking off from Yugoslav Navy, Croatian admirals steered Croatian Navy through the [[Croatian War of Independence]] from Yugoslavia (1991-5).\n\nWhat follows is a list of naval officers '''from the territory of today's Republic of Croatia'''. For a list of admirals of the modern, post-1991 [[Croatian Navy]], see [[List of Croatian Navy admirals]]. [[Croats of Boka Kotorska|Historical Croat community in Boka Kotorska]] has produced a long line of admirals (Russian Grand admiral [[Matija Zmajevi\u0107]], Austrian vice-admiral [https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/BLK%C3%96:Bujacovich,_Alexander_Freiherr Aleksandar Bujakovi\u0107] (1792-1870) etc.), but these are excluded from this list.\n\n==Admiral flote==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horisontal\n| image1   = Zastava admirala flote OS RH.svg\n| caption1  = <center><small>1991\u2013</small></center>\n| width1     = 70\n| image2   = SFR Yugoslavia Fleet Admiral.svg\n| caption2  = <center><small>1956-91?\u2013</small></center>\n| width2     = 70\n| header    = <center>Rank Flag</center>\n| footer    = <center><span style=\"color:white;\">'''Admiral Flote'''</span></center>\n| footer_background = #007\n}}\n\nIn Yugoslav Navy, [[Branko Mamula]] was promoted to the rank of the Admiral of the Fleet in 1983. In [[Croatian Navy]], rank of Fleet Admiral was introduced in 1995 as the naval equivalent to the [[five-star rank]] of the  [[OF-10]]. Commending him on his role as the commander of Croatian Navy during the [[Croatian War of Independence|War of Independence]] (1991-5), president [[Franjo Tu\u0111man|Tu\u0111man]] conferred the rank on admiral Letica. ''[[Sveto Letica|Sveto Letica-Barba]]'' was the first and so far the only Croatian [[flag officer]] to hold this rank.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

[[Granada Television]] produced the series for the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network.\n\n==Plot==\nThe serial opens in the midst of [[World War II]] in the fictional Indian city of Mayapore, against the backdrop of the last years of the [[British Raj]] and the [[Indian independence movement]]. Hari Kumar is a young Indian man who was educated at Chillingborough, a [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|British public school]] (the British term for an elite [[private school]]); he identifies as [[English people|English]] rather than Indian. The bankruptcy of his father, a formerly successful businessman, forces him to return to India to live with his aunt.\n\nWorking as a journalist, Kumar now occupies a lower social status in India, and lives between two worlds, British and Indian. Many British colonists discriminate against him, and he is held in some suspicion by Indian independence activists. During this time, violent anti-British demonstrations are taking place in the city. Hari becomes romantically involved with Daphne Manners, a young British woman who does not share her people's prejudices. One night, after Hari and Daphne make love in the public Bibighar Gardens, the couple are attacked by a group of unknown Indian men. Hari is beaten and Daphne is gang raped.\n\nRonald Merrick, a young lower-middle-class Englishman, is intelligent and hardworking. He is the local Indian Police superintendent. Merrick once professed to be romantically interested in Daphne, though she politely but firmly rebuffed him. He arrests Hari for her rape, holding him in the local jail. Hari is beaten and sexually humiliated. Merrick resents Hari's privileged education and disdains Daphne's preferring the young Indian to him. When Daphne refuses to cooperate with the investigation, the police do not prosecute Hari for rape. However, Merrick arrests Kumar and other young, educated Indians, jailing them without trial under the security regulations adopted to suppress the Indian independence movement. Word that Hari was tortured causes outrage in the Indian community. Merrick is transferred from Mayapore to a smaller and less important town in the province.\n\nDaphne learns she is pregnant. She chooses to believe Hari is the father, rather than one of the rapists. She dies in childbirth. The [[mixed-race]] daughter, Parvati, is taken in by Daphne's great-aunt, Lady Manners, widow of a former provincial governor. While Lady Manners takes the infant to the resort area of Srinagar, she meets Sarah Layton, a young British woman vacationing with her mother, Mildred, and sister, Susan. Sarah and Susan's father is the colonel of the Indian Army regiment in Pankot, a [[hill station]] near Mayapore. He is being held as a [[prisoner of war]] in Germany, after his unit was captured early in the war.  Susan and their mother prefer to stay away from Lady Manners due to the scandal of her great-niece's illegitimate birth, but Sarah pays a call on Lady Manners and the two women become friendly.\n\nSarah and her family soon encounter Merrick, who has left the police and procured a commission in the Indian Army. Teddie Bingham, an Indian Army officer and the fianc\u00e9 of Sarah's sister Susan, is stationed in the nearby princely state of Mirat; Merrick, also assigned there, happens to share quarters with him. Because the unit is soon to leave for the border with Burma, Teddie and Susan have to marry in Mirat.  When Teddie's best man for the ceremony becomes ill, he asks Merrick to step in. Merrick, seeing a relationship with the upper-class Teddie and the Laytons as a means to career advancement, is pleased to help.  While Merrick and Teddie are driving to the ceremony a stone is thrown at their car, slightly injuring Teddie.  Merrick understands that he was the target of the attack, as this is one of a series of incidents suggesting he is being harassed because of his treatment of Kumar and the other suspects in the Manners case in Mayapore.\n\nShortly after the wedding, Teddie and Merrick leave for the Burma front with their unit. Teddie is soon killed in an ambush by the Japanese-sponsored [[Indian National Army]] (INA). Merrick is badly wounded trying to get Teddie to safety and is evacuated to a Calcutta hospital. When Sarah visits him (at Susan's request), she learns that his arm will be amputated and that his burned face is permanently disfigured. Merrick says that Teddie was ambushed because of him. Teddie had left their unit to try to persuade two Indian soldiers of his regiment, who had been captured by the Japanese and joined the INA, to surrender and come in. Merrick believes Teddie wanted to prove to him that the Indian soldiers, even after becoming turncoats, would resume their loyalty to the British if given the chance. Merrick's disfigurement has increased hostility against Indians.\n\nLady Manners presses for a formal inquiry into Hari Kumar's arrest and detention. Nigel Rowan, an aide to the governor of the province conducts the interview with Hari, who learns during it that Daphne died.  After Rowan establishes that Merrick tortured Hari and there is no evidence of any wrongdoing, he arranges Hari's release. No action is taken against Merrick, however.\n\nAfter convalescing, Merrick is promoted and assigned to intelligence activities concerning the INA and Indian soldiers who collaborated with the enemy. He comes across the Laytons again in Bombay, where Sarah is reunited with her father, Colonel Layton, just released from a German POW camp.  Merrick is there to interrogate an Indian soldier who had served under Colonel Layton and assisted the Germans after Layton's unit was captured, and who has been deported to India. Merrick gains assistance from Sergeant Guy Perron, a young [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] graduate and Indian history scholar, who was serving with an [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] Field Security unit; he speaks fluent [[Urdu]] and is asked to observe the interrogation.  Merrick learns that Perron also attended Chillingborough and knew Hari Kumar.\n\nAfter the interrogation, Perron runs into Merrick and Sarah Layton at a party. He accompanies them to the apartment of Layton's aunt, where Sarah and her father are staying temporarily. Sarah and Perron are attracted to each other. Merrick decides to have Perron assigned to assist him in further investigations of Indian soldiers who became collaborators. Perron and Sarah both find Merrick distasteful, but Perron has no choice but to work with him.\n\nAfter her husband Teddie's death and a difficult birth of their son, Susan Layton Bingham suffers a mental breakdown. She is treated in a hospital in Pankot. When Merrick returns to the Pankot area for his work, he courts Susan and ultimately marries her. Perron later learns that Merrick illegally gained access to Susan's medical records, apparently to learn about her mental state in order to persuade her to marry him. Susan's sister, Sarah, opposes the marriage, but is unable to prevent it.\n\nWith the surrender of Japan in August 1945, the war in the East is ended, and the days of British rule in India are clearly numbered. Perron arranges a quick exit from the Army to return to Cambridge and his academic career. Due to his imminent departure, he and Sarah suspend their relationship. Sarah's parents also plan to return to England. Merrick intends to stay on, having been offered a contract by the government of Mirat to reorganize their police force.\n\nIn 1947, with the transition to Indian independence under way, Perron returns to India as an historical observer. The conflict between Hindus and Muslims related to independence is tense. While visiting Mirat at the invitation of its Chief Minister, Count Bronowsky, whom he previously met in Bombay, Perron learns that Merrick is dead, officially from a riding accident. Bronowsky tells Perron that Merrick actually died during a sexual rendezvous with a young Indian man who was probably working for independent activists. It is believed the man allowed an assassin access to Merrick. The authorities cover up the details of Merrick's death, fearing reprisals from Indians during the political uncertainty with the British departure. The two discuss their view that, in leaving India, the British are opening up \"[[Pandora's Box]],\" releasing the ancient competition for power between the Hindus and Muslims, who had earlier conquered and ruled the country. Some confrontations had been restrained by the power of the British as rulers.\n\nSarah, Susan, and their aunt attend Merrick's funeral in Mirat. Perron accompanies them, along with Merrick's ashes, on the train back to Pankot. Joining them is Ahmed Kasim, the educated son of a prominent Muslim politician who has been working for Bronowsky in Mirat for the past few years. En route to Pankot, the train is stopped by Hindus, who attack Muslim passengers in retaliation for recent attacks on Hindus in Mirat. The attackers demand that Kasim be turned over to them. Kasim voluntarily leaves the train car and surrenders himself to the attackers, who murder him. Perron, Sarah, and the other English passengers are unharmed, but are horrified by the slaughter of Kasim and other Muslim passengers.\n\nBefore leaving India again, Perron visits Hari Kumar, now living in a poor neighborhood and supporting himself by tutoring Indian students in English. He leaves his calling card, as Kumar is out. Perron reflects on how Kumar was caught in an impossible position, between England and India.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Peggy Ashcroft]] - Barbara Batchelor\n* [[Janet Henfrey]] - Edwina Crane\n* [[Derrick Branche]] - Ahmed Kasim\n* [[Charles Dance]] - Sgt Guy Perron\n* [[Geraldine James]] - Sarah Layton\n* [[Rachel Kempson]] - Lady Ethel Manners\n* [[Art Malik]] - Hari Kumar\n* [[Wendy Morgan (actress)|Wendy Morgan]] - Susan Layton\n* [[Judy Parfitt]] - Mildred Layton\n* [[Tim Pigott-Smith]] - Supt./Capt/Maj/Lt Col Ronald Merrick\n* [[Eric Porter]] - Count Dmitri Bronowsky\n* [[Susan Wooldridge]] - Daphne Manners\n* [[Ralph Arliss]] - Capt.

The decision was made to attempt an adaptation of the quartet but to first test the company's ability to successfully complete a production in India by doing an adaptation of ''Staying On''. With the success of that television film, plans proceeded for the quartet.<ref name=\"Making\">{{cite book|title =The Making of the Jewel in the Crown| publisher=St. Martin's Press| year=1983|page=|isbn=0-312-50705-4}}</ref>\n\n===Adaptation===\nThe series is based on the ''Raj Quartet'' novels by Paul Scott:\n\n* ''[[The Jewel in the Crown (novel)|The Jewel in the Crown]]'' (1966)\n* ''[[The Day of the Scorpion]]'' (1968)\n* ''[[The Towers of Silence]]'' (1971)\n* ''[[A Division of the Spoils]]'' (1975)\n\nWhile the novels are written from different characters' viewpoints and move back and forth in time, the adaptation places events in roughly chronological order.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/16/arts/tv-view-jewel-in-the-crown-superb-drama.html |title=View: ''Jewel in the Crown'' is superb drama |first=John J. |last=O'Connor |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 16, 1984 |accessdate=February 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe series was shot on [[16mm film]], much of it on location in India. The scenes of the Nawab of Mirat's palace were filmed at [[Lake Palace]] in [[Udaipur]]. Besides all the Mirat scenes, Udaipur was also the location for Mayapore and some Pankot scenes. [[Shimla]] was the primary location for Pankot and many scenes were filmed in [[Mysore]] and [[Kashmir]].<ref name=\"Making\" />\n\nAll filming not from India was filmed at Manchester's Granada Studios. The programme was often screened from grainy prints, but was fully remastered for its 2005 [[DVD]] release and [[ITV3]] screening, resulting in much better picture quality.\n\n===Cast===\nThe series made stars of [[Art Malik]] and [[Charles Dance]]. Other leading actors included [[Peggy Ashcroft]] (who won the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Best TV Actress award for her performance), [[Tim Pigott-Smith]], [[Geraldine James]], [[Judy Parfitt]], [[Rachel Kempson]], [[Eric Porter]], [[Susan Wooldridge]], [[Zohra Sehgal]], [[Saeed Jaffrey]], and [[Karan Kapoor]] (son of [[Shashi Kapoor]] and [[Jennifer Kendal]]). The complexities of the plot ensured that no one character was at the centre of the action throughout.  All four \"Best TV Actress\" nominations at that year's BAFTAs went to stars of the series, with Ashcroft winning over Wooldridge, James and Parfitt. Pigott-Smith won Best TV Actor.\n\nIn a list of the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] compiled by the [[British Film Institute]] in 2000 and voted by industry professionals, ''The Jewel in the Crown'' placed 22nd.\n\n==Broader context==\nAccording to the [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]] there was \"a cycle of film and television productions which emerged during the first half of the 1980s, which seemed to indicate Britain's growing preoccupation with India, Empire and a particular aspect of British cultural history\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/jewelinthe.htm|work=Museum of Broadcasting Communications|title=Jewel in the Crown|accessdate=12 August 2017}}</ref> In addition to ''The Jewel in the Crown'',  this cycle also included ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' (1982), ''[[Heat and Dust (film)|Heat and Dust]]'' (1983), ''[[The Far Pavilions]]'' (1984) and ''[[A Passage to India (film)|A Passage to India]]'' (1984).\n\nMini-series co-star Charles Dance has commented how it has a devout following to this day. \"I think that aired here in 1983, and there are people still to this day who assemble in each other\u2019s houses and have ''Jewel In The Crown'' weekends and watch all 14 hours, mostly in America,\" he told Attention Deficit Delirium. \"I have people stopping me in the street now saying that they watched ''Jewel In The Crown'' again a couple of months ago, and I think, 'Bloody hell, did you really?' So I\u2019m known to that generation for a completely different type of work. The current film and television viewing audience is much younger, and the kind of things that I\u2019m known for are these rather off-the-wall, slightly villainous characters in fantastical film and television things, but that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s better to be looked over than to be overlooked in my business.\"\n<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.bryanreesman.com/blog/2011/12/04/charles-dance-talks-neverland-underworld-awakening-and-game-of-thrones/ | title=Charles Dance Talks \"Neverland,\" \"Underworld: Awakening\" and \"Game Of Thrones\" | first=Bryan | last=Reesman | date=4 December 2011 | website=Attention Deficit Delirium | accessdate=25 January 2012 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124145109/http://www.bryanreesman.com/blog/2011/12/04/charles-dance-talks-neverland-underworld-awakening-and-game-of-thrones/ | archivedate=24 January 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nIn contemporary reviews, John J.

[[Granada Television]] produced the series for the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network.\n\n==Plot==\nThe serial opens in the midst of [[World War II]] in the fictional Indian city of Mayapore, against the backdrop of the last years of the [[British Raj]] and the [[Indian independence movement]]. Hari Kumar is a young Indian man who was educated at Chillingborough, a [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|British public school]] (the British term for an elite [[private school]]); he identifies as [[English people|English]] rather than Indian. The bankruptcy of his father, a formerly successful businessman, forces him to return to India to live with his aunt.\n\nWorking as a journalist, Kumar now occupies a lower social status in India, and lives between two worlds, British and Indian. Many British colonists discriminate against him, and he is held in some suspicion by Indian independence activists. During this time, violent anti-British demonstrations are taking place in the city. Hari becomes romantically involved with Daphne Manners, a young British woman who does not share her people's prejudices. One night, after Hari and Daphne make love in the public Bibighar Gardens, the couple are attacked by a group of unknown Indian men. Hari is beaten and Daphne is gang raped.\n\nRonald Merrick, a young lower-class Englishman, is intelligent and hardworking. He is the local Indian Police superintendent. Merrick was once romantically interested in Daphne, though she politely but firmly rebuffed him. He arrests Hari for her rape, holding him in the local jail. Hari is beaten and sexually humiliated. Merrick resents Hari's privileged education and disdains Daphne's preferring the young Indian to him. When Daphne refuses to cooperate with the investigation, the police do not prosecute Hari for rape. However, Merrick arrests Kumar and other young, educated Indians, jailing them without trial under the security regulations adopted to suppress the Indian independence movement. Word that Hari was tortured causes outrage in the Indian community. Merrick is transferred from Mayapore to a smaller and less important town in the province.\n\nDaphne learns she is pregnant. She chooses to believe Hari is the father, rather than one of the rapists. She dies in childbirth. The [[mixed-race]] daughter, Parvati, is taken in by Daphne's great-aunt, Lady Manners, widow of a former provincial governor. While Lady Manners takes the infant to the resort area of Srinagar, she meets Sarah Layton, a young British woman vacationing with her mother, Mildred, and sister, Susan. Sarah and Susan's father is the colonel of the Indian Army regiment in Pankot, a [[hill station]] near Mayapore. He is being held as a [[prisoner of war]] in Germany, after his unit was captured early in the war.  Susan and their mother prefer to stay away from Lady Manners due to the scandal of her great-niece's illegitimate birth, but Sarah pays a call on Lady Manners and the two women become friendly.\n\nSarah and her family soon encounter Merrick, who has left the police and procured a commission in the Indian Army. Teddie Bingham, an Indian Army officer and the fianc\u00e9 of Sarah's sister Susan, is stationed in the nearby princely state of Mirat; Merrick, also assigned there, happens to share quarters with him. Because the unit is soon to leave for the border with Burma, Teddie and Susan have to marry in Mirat.  When Teddie's best man for the ceremony becomes ill, he asks Merrick to step in. Merrick, seeing a relationship with the upper-class Teddie and the Laytons as a means to career advancement, is pleased to help.  While Merrick and Teddie are driving to the ceremony a stone is thrown at their car, slightly injuring Teddie.  Merrick understands that he was the target of the attack, as this is one of a series of incidents suggesting he is being harassed because of his treatment of Kumar and the other suspects in the Manners case in Mayapore.\n\nShortly after the wedding, Teddie and Merrick leave for the Burma front with their unit. Teddie is soon killed in an ambush by the Japanese-sponsored [[Indian National Army]] (INA). Merrick is badly wounded trying to get Teddie to safety and is evacuated to a Calcutta hospital. When Sarah visits him (at Susan's request), she learns that his arm will be amputated and that his burned face is permanently disfigured. Merrick says that Teddie was ambushed because of him. Teddie had left their unit to try to persuade two Indian soldiers of his regiment, who had been captured by the Japanese and joined the INA, to surrender and come in. Merrick believes Teddie wanted to prove to him that the Indian soldiers, even after becoming turncoats, would resume their loyalty to the British if given the chance. Merrick's disfigurement has increased hostility against Indians.\n\nLady Manners presses for a formal inquiry into Hari Kumar's arrest and detention. Nigel Rowan, an aide to the governor of the province conducts the interview with Hari, who learns during it that Daphne died.  After Rowan establishes that Merrick tortured Hari and there is no evidence of any wrongdoing, he arranges Hari's release. No action is taken against Merrick, however.\n\nAfter convalescing, Merrick is promoted and assigned to intelligence activities concerning the INA and Indian soldiers who collaborated with the enemy. He comes across the Laytons again in Bombay, where Sarah is reunited with her father, Colonel Layton, just released from a German POW camp.  Merrick is there to interrogate an Indian soldier who had served under Colonel Layton and assisted the Germans after Layton's unit was captured, and who has been deported to India. Merrick gains assistance from Sergeant Guy Perron, a young [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] graduate and Indian history scholar, who was serving with an [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] Field Security unit; he speaks fluent [[Urdu]] and is asked to observe the interrogation.  Merrick learns that Perron also attended Chillingborough and knew Hari Kumar.\n\nAfter the interrogation, Perron runs into Merrick and Sarah Layton at a party. He accompanies them to the apartment of Layton's aunt, where Sarah and her father are staying temporarily. Sarah and Perron are attracted to each other. Merrick decides to have Perron assigned to assist him in further investigations of Indian soldiers who became collaborators. Perron and Sarah both find Merrick distasteful, but Perron has no choice but to work with him.\n\nAfter her husband Teddie's death and a difficult birth of their son, Susan Layton Bingham suffers a mental breakdown. She is treated in a hospital in Pankot. When Merrick returns to the Pankot area for his work, he courts Susan and ultimately marries her. Perron later learns that Merrick illegally gained access to Susan's medical records, apparently to learn about her mental state in order to persuade her to marry him. Susan's sister, Sarah, opposes the marriage, but is unable to prevent it.\n\nWith the surrender of Japan in August 1945, the war in the East is ended, and the days of British rule in India are clearly numbered. Perron arranges a quick exit from the Army to return to Cambridge and his academic career. Due to his imminent departure, he and Sarah suspend their relationship. Sarah's parents also plan to return to England. Merrick intends to stay on, having been offered a contract by the government of Mirat to reorganize their police force.\n\nIn 1947, with the transition to Indian independence under way, Perron returns to India as an historical observer. The conflict between Hindus and Muslims related to independence is tense. While visiting Mirat at the invitation of its Chief Minister, Count Bronowsky, whom he previously met in Bombay, Perron learns that Merrick is dead, officially from a riding accident. Bronowsky tells Perron that Merrick actually died during a sexual rendezvous with a young Indian man who was probably working for independent activists. It is believed the man allowed an assassin access to Merrick. The authorities cover up the details of Merrick's death, fearing reprisals from Indians during the political uncertainty with the British departure. The two discuss their view that, in leaving India, the British are opening up \"[[Pandora's Box]],\" releasing the ancient competition for power between the Hindus and Muslims, who had earlier conquered and ruled the country. Some confrontations had been restrained by the power of the British as rulers.\n\nSarah, Susan, and their aunt attend Merrick's funeral in Mirat. Perron accompanies them, along with Merrick's ashes, on the train back to Pankot. Joining them is Ahmed Kasim, the educated son of a prominent Muslim politician who has been working for Bronowsky in Mirat for the past few years. En route to Pankot, the train is stopped by Hindus, who attack Muslim passengers in retaliation for recent attacks on Hindus in Mirat. The attackers demand that Kasim be turned over to them. Kasim voluntarily leaves the train car and surrenders himself to the attackers, who murder him. Perron, Sarah, and the other English passengers are unharmed, but are horrified by the slaughter of Kasim and other Muslim passengers.\n\nBefore leaving India again, Perron visits Hari Kumar, now living in a poor neighborhood and supporting himself by tutoring Indian students in English. He leaves his calling card, as Kumar is out. Perron reflects on how Kumar was caught in an impossible position, between England and India.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Peggy Ashcroft]] - Barbara Batchelor\n* [[Janet Henfrey]] - Edwina Crane\n* [[Derrick Branche]] - Ahmed Kasim\n* [[Charles Dance]] - Sgt Guy Perron\n* [[Geraldine James]] - Sarah Layton\n* [[Rachel Kempson]] - Lady Ethel Manners\n* [[Art Malik]] - Hari Kumar\n* [[Wendy Morgan (actress)|Wendy Morgan]] - Susan Layton\n* [[Judy Parfitt]] - Mildred Layton\n* [[Tim Pigott-Smith]] - Supt./Capt/Maj/Lt Col Ronald Merrick\n* [[Eric Porter]] - Count Dmitri Bronowsky\n* [[Susan Wooldridge]] - Daphne Manners\n* [[Ralph Arliss]] - Capt.

The decision was made to attempt an adaptation of the quartet but to first test the company's ability to successfully complete a production in India by doing an adaptation of ''Staying On''. With the success of that television film, plans proceeded for the quartet.<ref name=\"Making\">{{cite book|title =The Making of the Jewel in the Crown| publisher=St. Martin's Press| year=1983|page=|isbn=0-312-50705-4}}</ref>\n\n===Adaptation===\nThe series is based on the ''Raj Quartet'' novels by Paul Scott:\n\n* ''[[The Jewel in the Crown (novel)|The Jewel in the Crown]]'' (1966)\n* ''[[The Day of the Scorpion]]'' (1968)\n* ''[[The Towers of Silence]]'' (1971)\n* ''[[A Division of the Spoils]]'' (1975)\n\nWhile the novels are written from different characters' viewpoints and move back and forth in time, the adaptation places events in roughly chronological order.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/16/arts/tv-view-jewel-in-the-crown-superb-drama.html |title=View: ''Jewel in the Crown'' is superb drama |first=John J. |last=O'Connor |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 16, 1984 |accessdate=February 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe series was shot on [[16mm film]], much of it on location in India. The scenes of the Nawab of Mirat's palace were filmed at [[Lake Palace]] in [[Udaipur]]. Besides all the Mirat scenes, Udaipur was also the location for Mayapore and some Pankot scenes. [[Shimla]] was the primary location for Pankot and many scenes were filmed in [[Mysore]] and [[Kashmir]].<ref name=\"Making\" />\n\nAll filming not from India was filmed at Manchester's Granada Studios. The programme was often screened from grainy prints, but was fully remastered for its 2005 [[DVD]] release and [[ITV3]] screening, resulting in much better picture quality.\n\n===Cast===\nThe series made stars of [[Art Malik]] and [[Charles Dance]]. Other leading actors included [[Peggy Ashcroft]] (who won the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Best TV Actress award for her performance), [[Tim Pigott-Smith]], [[Geraldine James]], [[Judy Parfitt]], [[Rachel Kempson]], [[Eric Porter]], [[Susan Wooldridge]], [[Zohra Sehgal]], [[Saeed Jaffrey]], and [[Karan Kapoor]] (son of [[Shashi Kapoor]] and [[Jennifer Kendal]]). The complexities of the plot ensured that no one character was at the centre of the action throughout.  All four \"Best TV Actress\" nominations at that year's BAFTAs went to stars of the series, with Ashcroft winning over Wooldridge, James and Parfitt. Pigott-Smith won Best TV Actor.\n\nIn a list of the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] compiled by the [[British Film Institute]] in 2000 and voted by industry professionals, ''The Jewel in the Crown'' placed 22nd.\n\n==Broader context==\nAccording to the [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]] there was \"a cycle of film and television productions which emerged during the first half of the 1980s, which seemed to indicate Britain's growing preoccupation with India, Empire and a particular aspect of British cultural history\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/jewelinthe.htm|work=Museum of Broadcasting Communications|title=Jewel in the Crown|accessdate=12 August 2017}}</ref> In addition to ''The Jewel in the Crown'',  this cycle also included ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' (1982), ''[[Heat and Dust (film)|Heat and Dust]]'' (1983), ''[[The Far Pavilions]]'' (1984) and ''[[A Passage to India (film)|A Passage to India]]'' (1984).\n\nMini-series co-star Charles Dance has commented how it has a devout following to this day. \"I think that aired here in 1983, and there are people still to this day who assemble in each other\u2019s houses and have ''Jewel In The Crown'' weekends and watch all 14 hours, mostly in America,\" he told Attention Deficit Delirium. \"I have people stopping me in the street now saying that they watched ''Jewel In The Crown'' again a couple of months ago, and I think, 'Bloody hell, did you really?' So I\u2019m known to that generation for a completely different type of work. The current film and television viewing audience is much younger, and the kind of things that I\u2019m known for are these rather off-the-wall, slightly villainous characters in fantastical film and television things, but that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s better to be looked over than to be overlooked in my business.\"\n<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.bryanreesman.com/blog/2011/12/04/charles-dance-talks-neverland-underworld-awakening-and-game-of-thrones/ | title=Charles Dance Talks \"Neverland,\" \"Underworld: Awakening\" and \"Game Of Thrones\" | first=Bryan | last=Reesman | date=4 December 2011 | website=Attention Deficit Delirium | accessdate=25 January 2012 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124145109/http://www.bryanreesman.com/blog/2011/12/04/charles-dance-talks-neverland-underworld-awakening-and-game-of-thrones/ | archivedate=24 January 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nIn contemporary reviews, John J.

The top 2 players again emerged then to the Quarter-Finales. All results are in the FISTF archive. We can see that Subbuteo was innovative with the tournament modus in 1970. The FIFA World Cup 1982 was played with this modus, without the Q/F stage.\n\n'''The World Cup 1970 Quarter- and Semi-Finals'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Player !! Nation !! Result !!

The organization was already well under way in 1992\u20131993 and the event was finally played, in Chicago. The first FISTF Sports World Championship was played in Paris (Fra) 1994. In 1993, two European champions reigned (ETF and FISTF), 1994 two world champions reigned (FISA and FISTF) and in 1996 a FISA Subbuteo European Championship and the FISTF World Championship was played. After 1996 there were no more double events played and FISTF strengthened its position as the global sports table football federation. The junior (U-16) World Cup was played in 1978 for the first time with three new Nations present, such as Austria, Greece and Canada.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ FISA Subbuteo World Cup \u2013 Senior\n|-\n!

The nation winning the most individual matches, won the team match. A draw was also possible, if each team won an individual match and the third match would be a draw itself. The result would be a 1\u20131; as an example. Starting with 1984, the European Championship was played with the same structure as the FISA World Cup, containing one Senior and one Junior category. In 1996 another FISA Subbuteo European Championship event was organized, although FISTF had already been established in 1992. Several nations (Switzerland, Austria, Denmark, Netherlands, Cyprus, Norway) were not invited or did not participate, and the reason is unclear. After 1993, with all nations joining FISTF, the ETF (ESTF 1992\u201393) became defunct in October 1993. Hasbro (took over Waddington Sports Games Ltd. with Subbuteo brand name in 1995\u20131996), tried to carry on by itself to organize a FISA event, with a limited number of players participating. The 1996 competition was therefore the very last organized by FISA (Hasbro). All matches played were 2x15min, with extra time of 2x5min in necessary, and 5x shots in the knock out phase.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ FISA Subbuteo European Championship \u2013 Team 1x Senior and 2x Junior (U-16)\n|-\n!

Which was then an indicator for the upcoming FISTF as the new world federation.\n\nThe ETF founded in 1963, defunct after the 30th Edition of the Europa Cup in 1993. It was a strong and stable association and the base for the merger of ETF Nations (associations) and FISA Nations (associations), to form and built FISTF. Some countries had two (2) table football/soccer/Subbuteo associations each affiliated to ETF or FISA. That took time to meld together. The main problems where the playing rules and equipment manufactured. FISTF made a new start to melt all players into one democratic global federation, with sport rules and material with several manufacturers offering sports equipment. The development of FISTF is ongoing and more Nations around the Globe are joining. All ETF matches played 2x20min., a.e.t.=after extra time with 2x10min, if necessary 1x10min. golden goal decision or 5x shots (similar to penalties in football but taken from different positions just inside the shooting area).\nCorrections: Willi Hogeweg was German, and not Dutch. Kurt Erb won the 1980 Europa Cup in Uddingston (SCO), and not his brother Peter Erb. Both mistakes corrected, which were previously mentioned. Tonio Montesin (Malta) was the finalist in the 1993 ESTF Cup final, and not John Barrons (NIL)! Important to mention is that Mike Dent is Scottish, while playing for England in 1976.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ E.T.F. Europa Cup (Individual)\n|-\n! Year\n! Host City\n! Winner\n!

The three ETF Members Belgium, Netherlands and Germany participated. England, the fourth ETF Member did not participate. In the 1960s 2 points were given for win and 1 point for a draw, that's why a high score of 8\u20130 was possible, which meant a 4\u20130 win in today's result system. Starting with the 1983 ETF Nations Cup, the one (1) point system was introduced for an individual win and for a draw non-points were given to both teams. A team consisted of four (4) Players. All ETF Matches were played 2x20min. In knock-out Stages, an 'after extra time' (a.e.t.) with 2x10min was applied if the match had a draw result. In case there was no winner, the 'golden goal' had to be scored in a 1x10min period. If no winner came up, the 5 shot system was used. The 5 shot system is practically the penalty shooting in real football/soccer. The Editions 1969\u201370 and 1970\u201371 were cancelled due to the fact that the Netherlands were not interested to participate at the ETF Nations Cup.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ E.T.F.

In the honor of the fine Paul Outmanns (Belgium) who was a great player and organizer, the ''Coupe par equipe d'Europe'' was named 'Trophy Paul Outmanns'. The Europa Cup in Spa is considered as the first ever Europa Cup for Club teams. At the 1st edition in Spa (BEL), Clubs participated from Belgium (ETF), France (FISA), Germany (ETF) and the Netherlands (ETF). Italian clubs (FISA) participated at the 2nd edition. The 2nd edition in Aubervilliers (FRA) was played on the weekend 9\u201310 January 1988 (Season 87\u201388) with 4 countries, France (7), Belgium (5), Italy (2) and Germany (1) with a total of 15 clubs.\nThe 3rd edition in Oldham (ENG) on 4\u20135 August 1990 (Season 89\u201390) with 7 countries, France, Belgium, Italy, Wales, England and Netherlands. The 7th nation (Germany, Scotland or other) is not yet confirmed from research work.\nThe Quarter-Finals 1989\u201390:\nCardiff TSL 2\u20130 SC Elbeuf, SC Goldfingers Cornesse 3\u20130 Charlton SC, Birmingham TSL 2\u20130 Leicster Cheetah SC, RSMV Rotterdam 2\u20131 Florence SC. The editions in 1985\u201386 and 1987\u201388 were an initiative by the clubs and players (FISA and ETF), as well as the FBFTS {{BEL}} and FFFT {{FRA}}. The edition in 1989\u201390 was organized by FISA personal. The Europa Cup for ((Club Teams)) of Sport Table Football was finally born. The club Teams consisted of three players each. The club winning the most of the three matches wins. The playing time was 2x20 minutes (ETF) with three (3) players (FISA) per team. The single win per player counted 1 point, the draw 0 points for each team and the loss 0 points, and therefore it was often important, to have a good goal difference scored from the three individual matches.\nClubs participated from FISA and ETF countries, and the Europa Cup for Club Teams began too emerge steadily.\nIt was the beginning, when the flicking nations from FISA and ETF, came step by step together. Talks and meetings, ideas and projects came up to get the table football community merged.

The British Championship with {{ENG}}, {{SCO}}, {{WAL}} and {{NIR}} were also played irregular within ETF and FISA. Possibly that {{ESP}}, {{POR}}, and {{GIB}} played such a 3 country tournament as well. It is common that Nations play international friendly games when possible and within ETF it was a main sports event with the A-Team, B-Team and Juniors. Today, International tournaments are used, to play 'internationals' between Nations. Mainly the Open and Veteran category are played. FISTF has a registration form to agree on an international match. 2017 saw in \u00c9lancourt {{FRA}} the first 4-Country tournament with 3 Continents, America, Africa and Europe, involved.

No information was found about Republic Irland (Eire).\nIn 1976, England won their 5th Home Championship, so the Edition numbers need corrections. Research goes on through old copies of \"The blue\" magazine.\nEngland won the first seven editions. Wales humbled England in 1981. 1982\u20131986 England won again five editions in a row. The 14th edition has not been found yet. Research work ongoing.\nThe first ever International match (National Teams) was played in Bruxelles (BEL) 7 February 1960, between Belgium and the Netherlands. Belgium won! The foundation of an international federation was in line.\n\nAll started with an International match in England, Tunbridge Wells, Kent. This 2nd International match between two Nations was played in Tunbridge Wells, Oct./Nov. 1960, England against Belgium, on behalf of an invitation for three players from Mr. Peter Adolph. Earlier in February 1960 the 1st International Match was played between Belgium and the Netherlands. After that, more International matches between sports table football associations have been played.\nIt is not known to date, if in 1960 England played the Netherlands.\n\n'''2nd International Match between Nations 1960'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The 'big' three of the 1960s where Belgium, Netherlands, West Germany and Switzerland was the emerging ETF Nation. The four UK Home Nations England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Irland and Eire, as well as from southern Europe Malta and Gibraltar travelled to London. The Americas where represented through the USA and Asia through Israel, which reached against all odds the Semi-Final stage. Stuart Goldman(\u2020) was UK citizen from England and represented Israel. The 24 players were drawn in the 6 groups of 4 players and the 2 top players of each group proceeded to the 2nd group stage, with 4 groups of 3 players. The top 2 players again emerged then to the Quarter-Finales. All results are in the FISTF archive. We can see that Subbuteo was innovative with the tournament modus in 1970. The FIFA World Cup 1982 was played with this modus, without the Q/F stage.\n\n'''The World Cup 1970 Quarter- and Semi-Finals'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Player !! Nation !! Result !!

The organization was already well under way in 1992\u20131993 and the event was finally played, in Chicago. The first FISTF Sports World Championship was played in Paris (Fra) 1994. In 1993, two European champions reigned (ETF and FISTF), 1994 two world champions reigned (FISA and FISTF) and in 1996 a FISA Subbuteo European Championship and the FISTF World Championship was played. After 1996 there were no more double events played and FISTF strengthened its position as the global sports table football federation. The junior (U-16) World Cup was played in 1978 for the first time with three new Nations present, such as Austria, Greece and Canada.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ FISA Subbuteo World Cup \u2013 Senior\n|-\n!

The nation winning the most individual matches, won the team match. A draw was also possible, if each team won an individual match and the third match would be a draw itself. The result would be a 1\u20131; as an example. Starting with 1984, the European Championship was played with the same structure as the FISA World Cup, containing one Senior and one Junior category. In 1996 another FISA Subbuteo European Championship event was organized, although FISTF had already been established in 1992. Several nations (Switzerland, Austria, Denmark, Netherlands, Cyprus, Norway) were not invited or did not participate, and the reason is unclear. After 1993, with all nations joining FISTF, the ETF (ESTF 1992\u201393) became defunct in October 1993. Hasbro (took over Waddington Sports Games Ltd. with Subbuteo brand name in 1995\u20131996), tried to carry on by itself to organize a FISA event, with a limited number of players participating. The 1996 competition was therefore the very last organized by FISA (Hasbro). All matches played were 2x15min, with extra time of 2x5min in necessary, and 5x shots in the knock out phase.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ FISA Subbuteo European Championship \u2013 Team 1x Senior and 2x Junior (U-16)\n|-\n!

Which was then an indicator for the upcoming FISTF as the new world federation.\n\nThe ETF founded in 1963, defunct after the 30th Edition of the Europa Cup in 1993. It was a strong and stable association and the base for the merger of ETF Nations (associations) and FISA Nations (associations), to form and built FISTF. Some countries had two (2) table football/soccer/Subbuteo associations each affiliated to ETF or FISA. That took time to meld together. The main problems where the playing rules and equipment manufactured. FISTF made a new start to melt all players into one democratic global federation, with sport rules and material with several manufacturers offering sports equipment. The development of FISTF is ongoing and more Nations around the Globe are joining. All ETF matches played 2x20min., a.e.t.=after extra time with 2x10min, if necessary 1x10min. golden goal decision or 5x shots (similar to penalties in football but taken from different positions just inside the shooting area).\nCorrections: Willi Hogeweg was German, and not Dutch. Kurt Erb won the 1980 Europa Cup in Uddingston (SCO), and not his brother Peter Erb. Both mistakes corrected, which were previously mentioned. Tonio Montesin (Malta) was the finalist in the 1993 ESTF Cup final, and not John Barrons (NIL)! Important to mention is that Mike Dent is Scottish, while playing for England in 1976.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ E.T.F. Europa Cup (Individual)\n|-\n! Year\n! Host City\n! Winner\n!

The three ETF Members Belgium, Netherlands and Germany participated. England, the fourth ETF Member did not participate. In the 1960s 2 points were given for win and 1 point for a draw, that's why a high score of 8\u20130 was possible, which meant a 4\u20130 win in today's result system. Starting with the 1983 ETF Nations Cup, the one (1) point system was introduced for an individual win and for a draw non-points were given to both teams. A team consisted of four (4) Players. All ETF Matches were played 2x20min. In knock-out Stages, an 'after extra time' (a.e.t.) with 2x10min was applied if the match had a draw result. In case there was no winner, the 'golden goal' had to be scored in a 1x10min period. If no winner came up, the 5 shot system was used. The 5 shot system is practically the penalty shooting in real football/soccer.

In the honor of the fine Paul Outmanns (Belgium) who was a great player and organizer, the ''Coupe par equipe d'Europe'' was named 'Trophy Paul Outmanns'. The Europa Cup in Spa is considered as the first ever Europa Cup for Club teams. At the 1st edition in Spa (BEL), Clubs participated from Belgium (ETF), France (FISA), Germany (ETF) and the Netherlands (ETF). Italian clubs (FISA) participated at the 2nd edition. The 2nd edition in Aubervilliers (FRA) was played on the weekend 9\u201310 January 1988 (Season 87\u201388) with 4 countries, France (7), Belgium (5), Italy (2) and Germany (1) with a total of 15 clubs.\nThe 3rd edition in Oldham (ENG) on 4\u20135 August 1990 (Season 89\u201390) with 7 countries, France, Belgium, Italy, Wales, England and Netherlands. The 7th nation (Germany, Scotland or other) is not yet confirmed from research work.\nThe Quarter-Finals 1989\u201390:\nCardiff TSL 2\u20130 SC Elbeuf, SC Goldfingers Cornesse 3\u20130 Charlton SC, Birmingham TSL 2\u20130 Leicster Cheetah SC, RSMV Rotterdam 2\u20131 Florence SC. The editions in 1985\u201386 and 1987\u201388 were an initiative by the clubs and players (FISA and ETF), as well as the FBFTS {{BEL}} and FFFT {{FRA}}. The edition in 1989\u201390 was organized by FISA personal. The Europa Cup for ((Club Teams)) of Sport Table Football was finally born. The club Teams consisted of three players each. The club winning the most of the three matches wins. The playing time was 2x20 minutes (ETF) with three (3) players (FISA) per team. The single win per player counted 1 point, the draw 0 points for each team and the loss 0 points, and therefore it was often important, to have a good goal difference scored from the three individual matches.\nClubs participated from FISA and ETF countries, and the Europa Cup for Club Teams began too emerge steadily.\nIt was the beginning, when the flicking nations from FISA and ETF, came step by step together. Talks and meetings, ideas and projects came up to get the table football community merged.

Possibly that {{ESP}}, {{POR}}, and {{GIB}} played such a 3 country tournament as well. It is common that Nations play international friendly games when possible and within ETF it was a main sports event with the A-Team, B-Team and Juniors. Today, International tournaments are used, to play 'internationals' between Nations. Mainly the Open and Veteran category are played. FISTF has a registration form to agree on an international match. 2017 saw in \u00c9lancourt {{FRA}} the first 4-Country tournament with 3 Continents, America, Africa and Europe, involved.

No information was found about Republic Irland (Eire).\nIn 1976, England won their 5th Home Championship, so the Edition numbers need corrections. Research goes on through old copies of \"The blue\" magazine.\nEngland won the first seven editions. Wales humbled England in 1981. 1982\u20131986 England won again five editions in a row. The 14th edition has not been found yet. Research work ongoing.\nThe first ever International match (National Teams) was played in Bruxelles (BEL) 7 February 1960, between Belgium and the Netherlands. Belgium won! The foundation of an international federation was in line.\n\nAll started with an International match in England, Tunbridge Wells, Kent. This 2nd International match between two Nations was played in Tunbridge Wells, Oct./Nov. 1960, England against Belgium, on behalf of an invitation for three players from Mr. Peter Adolph. Earlier in February 1960 the 1st International Match was played between Belgium and the Netherlands. After that, more International matches between sports table football associations have been played.\nIt is not known to date, if in 1960 England played the Netherlands.\n\n'''2nd International Match between Nations 1960'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "Sobieski Stuarts", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=August 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2014}}\nIn the 1820s two English brothers, '''John Carter Allen''' (1795-1872) and '''Charles Manning Allen''' (1802-1880) adopted the names John Sobieski Stuart and Charles Edward Stuart, moved to [[Scotland]], became Roman Catholics, and about 1839 began to claim that their father, Thomas Allen (1767-1852), a former Lieutenant in the [[Royal Navy]], had been born in [[Italy]] the only legitimate child of [[Prince Charles Edward Stuart]] and his wife [[Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern]]. They claimed that Thomas had, for fear of kidnapping or assassination, been brought secretly to England on a ship captained by their grandfather, Admiral John Carter Allen (1725-1800), and adopted by him. Thomas was thus, they claimed, \u2018de jure monarch of England in place of the then reigning sovereign Queen Victoria\u2019.<ref>[[Sir Charles Petrie]], ''The Jacobite Movement: the last phase: 1716-1807'' (London, 1950) 189.</ref>\n\n\u2018They succeeded in fabricating around them an aura of bogus royalty which attracted the allegiance of a few romantic Jacobites in Victorian times\u2019.<ref>James Lees-Milne, ''The last Stuarts'' (1984) page 230.</ref> Herbert Vaughan called their story \u2018an impudent fabrication\u2019 and \u2018an unblushing fraud\u2019<ref>Herbert M. Vaughan, ''The last of the royal Stuarts: Henry Stuart, Cardinal Duke of York'' (1906) page 280</ref> but it was as Sir Charles Petrie wrote \u2018proof of the hold which the House of Stuart has never ceased to exercise upon popular imagination in the British Isles, so that ... if a man were to declare himself the heir to the Yorkist or Tudor dynasty, he would attract but little attention, yet if he claim to be a Stuart he will find hundreds ready to believe him\u2019.<ref>Sir Charles Petrie, ''The Jacobite movement: the last phase: 1716-1807'' (London, 1950) 187.</ref>\n\nThe brothers\u2019 two publications, [[Vestiarium Scoticum]] (Edinburgh, 1842) and ''Costume of the Clans'' (Edinburgh, 1843), described by the historian Hugh Trevor-Roper as \u2018shot through with pure fantasy and bare faced forgery\u2019,<ref>\u2018Invention of tradition; the Highland tradition of Scotland\u2019 in Eric Hobsbawm and Terrence Ranger, eds., ''The invention of tradition'' (University of Cambridge, 1983)</ref> have been sources widely used by the tartan industry in Scotland.\n==='''Family Background'''===\nThe brothers\u2019 grandfather, John Carter Allen (1725-1800), an admiral in the British navy, had three children: the above-named Lieutenant Thomas Allen (1767-1852), Jane or Jean Allen (c.1768-1829) who married Thomas Robinson, a widower, at [[Brighton]] in 1788, and Admiral John Allen (1771-1853). The three were named in John Carter Allen\u2019s will, though he bequeathed only \u00a3100 to Thomas and \u00a3100 and a pair of silver candlesticks to Jane, leaving \u00a32,200 and the residue to John. This disparity caused comment and some have speculated that Thomas was illegitimate, but an income had been guaranteed to him under his marriage settlement in 1792. \n\nHowever, additional research in 2014 showed that John Carter Allen did not marry until 1780 and that his three children were all illegitimate, born in a period in which he held no commission.<ref>John Charnock, ''Biographia Navalis'', vol. 6 (1798) 288.</ref> The three were named \u2018natural children of John Cator Allen\u2019 in the twelfth of sixteen codicils to the will of Elizabeth Arnold, his first wife\u2019s mother, dated in 1788 and proved in 1789. She left them twenty guineas each and \u00a31,000 to their father.<ref>Anthony Camp, New light on the Sobieski Stuarts, in ''Genealogists' Magazine'', vol. 31, no. 8 (December 2014) 298-306.</ref> The identity of their mother(s) has not been found. There was much tension in the family later and at one time the youngest son, John, was heard to say of Thomas, \u2018he is no brother of mine\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts: their claim to be descended from Prince Charlie'' (1909) 102.</ref>\n\nJohn Carter Allen himself had been baptised at St Dunstan in the West in 1724/5, the son of Carter Allen (1700-1734), an attorney in the parish of St Clement Eastcheap in the [[City of London]], who had married Emma Hay or Hays at St Giles, Camberwell, in 1724. These details also were not known until 2014. Contemporaries of John Carter Allen had said at his death in 1800 that the late Lord Hillsborough (who died in 1793 and for whom John Carter Allen\u2019s younger brother William Allen (1729-1811) had worked as an office clerk) had said that \u2018he had a claim to the title of Erroll ... as being descended from the old Earl Hay in the male line\u2019,<ref>Letter of William Scott in ''Gentleman\u2019s Magazine'', 1800, vol. i, page 1021.</ref> a worthless statement as the peerage had become extinct in the male line in 1717,<ref>''The Complete Peerage'', vol. v (1926) pages 99-100</ref> but believed by Thomas who added Hay to his name.\n\nHowever, the uncertainty of their descent and the romantic nature of the various claims surrounding them greatly influenced the two brothers. They also added Hay to their names and in 1822 the eldest son, as John Hay Allan, published a ''Genealogical table of the Hays, from William de Haya, cupbearer to Malcolm IV, 1170, down to 1840, with all the branches'' (Edinburgh, 1840), though his descent is not shown in the book and the parentage of Emma Hay or Hays has not been found.\n==='''Thomas Allen'''===\nAlthough frequently referred to as Captain Allen, Thomas Allen never attained that rank. He retired from the Navy as a Lieutenant in 1798 and his subsequent history and movements and the extent to which he approved of his sons\u2019 later claims, are all far from clear. He had married Catherine Matilda Manning, a daughter of the Rev. [[Owen Manning]] the historian of [[Surrey]], at Godalming in 1792.  They had three children: (1) John Carter Allen, born at Oystermouth, [[Glamorgan]],  4 August 1795 and baptised there, 5 October 1795; (2) Matilda Allen, born at Oystermouth, Glamorgan, 18 October 1799 and baptised there, 12 January 1800; and (3) Charles Manning Allen, born at Rotherfield Grays, [[Oxfordshire]], 4 July 1802 and baptised there, 3 August 1802. Under their marriage settlement the couple and their future children had a life interest and income from properties in Mare Street and Well Street, [[Hackney, London|Hackney]]. \n\nHowever, sometime about 1807 Thomas Allen formed a connection with a much younger woman, Ann, who was born in Hackney about 1790, and by whom he had five illegitimate children between 1808 and 1829. Her surname is usually given as Salmon (as she had a niece of that name living with her in 1851) but the death certificates of several of her children show it as Burton. The first child, William (died 1878), who used the surname MacGarrow, claimed to have been born in Glamorganshire or Wales but his baptism and the exact whereabouts of Thomas and Ann at this time have not been determined. It is said that from 1816 to 1829 Thomas was based at Boulogne, \u2018a safe refuge for English debtors\u2019.<ref>''Notes and Queries'', vol. 197 (1952) 456</ref> He certainly had increasing financial problems and in February 1817 he unsuccessfully appealed to the former [[Lord Chancellor]], Lord Erskine, for help with the possible sale of some of the property held in trust under his marriage settlement. A last minute attempt to come to an arrangement about it failed and on 17 January 1818, as the result of an action in the Court of Kings Bench against Thomas and his son John (in a plea of debt for \u00a3300 and damages by James Barstow), Thomas was imprisoned for debt in the [[Fleet Prison]]. He was released by order of the Court for Relief of Insolvent Debtors on 20 December 1819 but continued to live in fear of his creditors. \n\nHis reticence and desired anonymity was probably due to his illegitimacy and his relationship with Anne, but it was complicated by the later statements of his two legitimate sons on whom he looked with some displeasure. He had little in common with them and they in turn looked down on Anne as \u2018of much lower rank in life\u2019 than their mother.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 20-21, 102-3.</ref> Thomas and Anne apparently had their last child, Gilbert Hay Allen (1829-1902), in south London in 1829 and in 1839 Thomas was in hiding at 10 Portland Place North, Clapham Road, [[Lambeth]], as \u2018Mr Salmond\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 102.</ref> In the 1841 census he was entered at that address as \u2018Thomas MacGaradh\u2019, aged 70, and born in Scotland. He ostensibly registered the death of his wife Catherine Matilda at Portland Place North, on 14 February 1841, again calling himself Thomas MacGaradh, but describing her as \u2018Matilda Manning, widow\u2019. When the census was taken a few months later Anne was living with him at this address as Anne MacGaradh. MacGaradh was, his sons said, a war-cry of the Hay family but it was entirely their creation and it seems likely that they or Anne were responsible for their father\u2019s statements. The death of Catherine Matilda in 1841 did, however, eventually allow the purchase by Charles of the family\u2019s life interest in the trust properties from his father\u2019s bankruptcy assignees.\n\nIt is said that Thomas \u2018spent the last seven years of his life in bed\u2019,<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 89, 102.</ref> confined to his room at 22 Henry Street, Pentonville. He was there as \u2018John Salmon\u2019 when the Census was taken in 1851 and he died at that address as Thomas Hay Allen on 14 February 1852. He was buried in that name at St Giles in the Fields, Middlesex, on 23 February 1852, aged 84. His son, Charles, in order to distance himself from him, wrote in 1877 that his father was called James and had died in 1839. Some believed that he was buried at Old St Pancras, Middlesex (as stated in the introduction to the 1892 edition of his sons\u2019 ''The costume of the clans'', xvii, and repeated in the ''Dictionary of National Biography'') and Beveridge added \u2018but the stone said to have been placed over his grave cannot now be found\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 89-90.</ref>\n\n==='''Sobieski Stuarts'''===\nNo detail of the educations of Thomas\u2019s two sons has been found though they claimed that the secret of their royal descent had been revealed to them about 1811, that they had fought for [[Napoleon]] at [[Dresden]] (in August 1813), [[Leipzig]] (October 1813) and [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] (June 1815) and had learned [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] in London. The youngest, Charles Manning Allen, who we now know was not born until 1802, married at St George, Hanover Square, on 9 October 1822, Anna Gardiner, who had an income from property in [[Ireland]] and was the widow of Major Charles Gardiner (1780-1818), the childless only son of [[General William Gardiner]] (1748-1806; DNB) former British Minister in [[Brussels]] and [[Warsaw]] and younger brother of [[Luke Gardiner, 1st Viscount Mountjoy]]  (1745-1798). The marriage was publicised as that of \u2018Charles Stuart Hay Allen\u2019. However, the couple moved to Scotland after marriage and their first child, Anna Marie Stuart, born 27 July 1823, was baptised at [[Edinburgh]] and there recorded in the surname Hay on 20 October 1823. \n\nThomas\u2019s eldest son, John Carter Allen, calling himself John Hay Allan, had apparently already been in Scotland for some time and in 1822 he published a volume of poems, ''Bridal of Caolchairn, and other poems'' (London, 1822) dedicated to the [[Duke of Argyll]], and revealing a fair knowledge of that county but including several allusions to his claimed descent from the Hays of Errol. From 1826 to 1829, John joined his brother Charles at Windy Hill (now Milton Brodie), Alves, [[Morayshire]], under the patronage of the Earl of Moray.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 25.</ref> The brothers were at Logie House, Edinkillie, Morayshire, from 1829 to 1838,<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 25.</ref> when John used the name Stuart Allan. As John Sobieski Stuart he and his brother, calling themselves \u2018grandsons to the Pretender\u2019, had visited Ireland in May 1836.<ref>''The Times'', 9 May 1836, quoting the ''Glasgow Chronicle'' (John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 37-38).</ref> Lord Lovat then built \u2018an antique shooting lodge\u2019 for them on Eilean Aigas, an islet in the river Beauly, near Eskadale, Inverness, and there, always wearing the Stuart tartan, they held court from 1838 to 1845, attending the catholic church at Eskadale and being known as \u2018the Princes\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 93.</ref> The house is described as \u2018a very elegant mansion of the Elizabethan style\u2019 in the ''New Statistical Account of Scotland'' (1842).<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 93.</ref> On 18 October 1845, John married at St Martin-in-the-Fields, [[Westminster]], Georgina, eldest surviving daughter of Edward Kendall, J.P., of Austrey, Warwickshire.<ref>''Burke\u2019s Landed Gentry'' (1858) page 643.</ref> She had, he told [[Robert Chambers]]{{dn|date=April 2020}}, \u2018only ten thousand pounds, unless she survives her two sisters, who equally share with her\u2019,<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 100.</ref> but the couple then moved to live in London.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 27.</ref> In his letter to Chambers just prior to the marriage John asked for a loan of \u00a3100 until his wife\u2019s dividends were paid but when his father-in-law eventually died in March 1872 the total estate was sworn  at \u2018Under \u00a31,500\u2019 and later as \u2018Under \u00a32,000\u2019.<ref>Principal Probate Registry, 10 June 1872.</ref>\n\nThomas Allen\u2019s daughter Matilda had married Henry Timothy Boisquet de la Fleuriere, at St Alphege, [[Greenwich]], in 1818, and their son, Napoleon de la Fleuriere (1823-1881), was baptised at St Margaret, Westminster, in 1823. According to Matilda, her husband had been in the French service from 1804 to 1814 and from 1832 to 1853, but had been taken prisoner at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]] and did not return to France until 1830. In 1835 using the name Matilda McFleur she then married at St Mary Abbots, [[Kensington]], one Alexander McCaskery (died 1870), a police serjeant in [[Fulham]], by whom she had at least three children. This seems not to have stopped her from soliciting the Cross of an Officer of the [[Legion d\u2019Honneur]] for Henry Timothy in 1854. Her date of death has not been found.\n\nIn Scotland the brothers \u2018conducted themselves as members of a reigning dynasty who wished to preserve their incognito\u2019<ref>Sir Charles Petrie, ''The Jacobite Movement: the last phase: 1716-1807'' (London, 1950) 191.</ref> and  their claims \u2018were accorded a level of credence\u2019 (as the ''Dictionary of National Biography'' said at the end of the century) by \u2018men of rank and intelligence, such as the tenth [[Earl of Moray]] (1771-1848), the fourteenth [[Lord Lovat]] (1802-1875), the late [[Marquis of Bute]] (1793-1848), [[Sir Thomas Dick-Lauder, Bt]] (1784-1848), and [[Robert Chambers]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} (1802-1871)\u2019. However, the delusional John Sobieski Stuart, in spite of his expressed desire to withdraw from the public eye, went so far as to claim, in a letter to Chambers, that he and his brother had \u2018a body of supporters ready to push their claims to the uttermost\u2019.<ref>Sir Charles Petrie, ''The Jacobite Movement: the last phase: 1716-1807'' (London, 1950) 191-2].</ref>\n==='''The Claims'''===\nIn June 1829 the elder brother had shown a manuscript, containing tartan patterns and dated in 1721, to Sir Thomas Dick-Lauder who was much impressed by it, but [[Sir Walter Scott]] warned Dick-Lauder that the brothers \u2018are men of warm imaginations ... of much accomplishment but little probity \u2013 that is, in antiquarian matters\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 59.</ref> Sir Walter Scott, who died in 1832, had rejected the entire notion of clan tartans, saying that the \u2018idea of distinguishing the clans by their tartans is but a fashion of modern date\u2019. On behalf of the Society of Scottish Antiquaries he was shown a transcript of part of the brothers\u2019 manuscript but from its language alone \u2018indignantly declared his conviction that the MS itself must be an absolute fabrication\u2019.<ref>''Quarterly Review'', vol. 81, June-September 1847, page 64.</ref> Scott remembered seeing one of the brothers wearing the badge of [[High Constable of Scotland]] (as the Earls of Errol were), \u2018which he could have no more right to wear than the Crown\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 24.</ref> Dick-Lauder was himself an author of historical romances and had put up a monument to the Lauder family in Edinburgh showing a quite spurious descent, but one \u2018as he wished it to be\u2019.<ref>''Complete Baronetage'' (vol. 4, 1904) page 362, note a.</ref>\n\nHowever, calling himself John Sobieski Stuart, the elder brother then produced the lavish ''[[Vestiarium Scoticum]]'' (Edinburgh, 1842), costing ten guineas, which purported to be a reproduction, with colour illustrations, of a better version of the 1721 manuscript, this one being dated to 1571. This John claimed had passed through the hands of Prince Charles Edward Stuart to his father Thomas, though his father\u2019s letter on the subject, addressed to him as Ian and signed \u2018J. T. Stuart Hay\u2019 in 1829,<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 60.</ref> seems likely to be bogus. \n\nConsiderable interest in clans and tartans continued, and the following year, under the name John Sobieski Stolberg Stuart, John and his brother Charles published ''The costume of the clans: with observations upon the literature, arts, manufactures and commerce of the Highland and Western Isles during the middle ages; and the influence of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries upon their present condition'' (Edinburgh, 1843) which, as noted above, received intense criticism.\n\nUsing the names John Sobieski Stuart and Charles Edward Stuart the brothers followed this with their ''Tales of the Century, or sketches of the romances of history between 1745 and 1845'' (Edinburgh, 1847) in which they provided three scenes of the birth, youth and marriage of a man known by the Gaelic name of ''Iolair dhearg'' or the ''Red Eagle'', said to have been recounted by an aged Jacobite in exile, Dr Beaton. After being called to attend the birth of a son to a young woman in [[Tuscany]] in 1773, where portraits of the Old and Young Pretenders were prominent, Beaton claimed to have  been sworn to secrecy, but later to have seen a baby taken on board a British warship, ''HMS Albina'', under Commodore O\u2019Haloran. In the second tale, some years later, the grown child arrived in the Western Highlands of Scotland where, allthough called O\u2019Haloran and thought to be the son of the former captain, he is known as ''The Red Eagle'' and addressed as a prince. In the third tale, which takes place in the [[Peak District]] of [[Derbyshire]], a traveller meets ''The Red Eagle'' who, after various adventures, marries at [[Berwick-upon Tweed|Berwick]], Catharine Bruce, the daughter of a Derbyshire local landowner.\n \nThe stories, taken together, were designed in a roundabout way to suggest that the brothers\u2019 supposed grandfather was in reality Commodore O\u2019Haloran, and that the child, their father (known as Thomas Allen), was in reality the child of Prince Charles Edward Stuart and Louise of Stolberg, and thus de jure monarch of England. Athough the tales were \u2018copiously augmented with historical notes\u2019,<ref>Hugh Douglas, ''Bonnie Prince Charlie in love'' (1995) 218.</ref> in truth Admiral John Carter Allen did not command any ship in 1773, being on half-pay from 1771 to 1775.\n\nA strong attack on both the ''Vestiarium Scoticum'' and their ''Tales of the Century'' then followed and the brothers ancestral claims, which had received little acceptance in England, and the ''Vestiarium'' were completely discredited in a devastating anonymous article \u2018The heirs of the Stuarts\u2019, believed to be by [[George Skene]] (1807-1875), Professor of Law at [[Glasgow University]], which appeared in the ''Quarterly Review'', vol. 81 (June-September 1847) 57-85. He concluded about the ''Vestiarium'' that \u2018this pretended MS of the sixteenth century is an absolute fabrication, and of no authority whatever\u2019 and about the ''Tales'' that Prince Charles Edward Stuart \u2018could have had no possible reason for concealing the birth of an heir\u2019; any idea that he had \u2018left a legitimate male progeny\u2019 was \u2018the silliest of dreams\u2019.\n \nIn 1848 John attempted ''A reply to the Quarterly Review upon the Vestiarium Scoticum'' (Edinburgh, 1848) and the two brothers then produced ''Lays of the deer forest: with sketches of olden and modern deer-hunting'' (2 vols. Edinburgh, 1848), but three of their benefactors, the Earl of Moray, the Marquis of Bute and Thomas Dick-Lauder, died that year and the brothers were now so discredited that Charles took his wife to Prague where their son was in the Austrian army<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 101; ''Dictionary of National Biography''.</ref> and John followed soon after.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 27.</ref> John\u2019s wife died at [[Presburg]] in 1862 and the brothers did not return to England until 1868. In London they then occupied themselves with research, being well-known figures in the [[British Museum]], wearing Highland dress or military tunics and using pens embellished with gold coronets.\n\nJohn, who called himself \u2018The Chevalier John Sobieski Stewart\u2019, in 1871 described himself as Count d\u2019Albanie, Colonel of Hussars, and said that he was born at Versailles, France. He died without issue at 52 Stanley Street, St George Hanover Square, 13 February 1872, aged 74, and was buried at Eskadale. His widow died at Bath in 1888.\n\nJohn's brother Charles then assumed the title of Count of Albany and was active in Catholic circles in London but died from the same address (by then called 52 Alderney Street) on a trip to [[France]] on the Steamer ''Rainbow'' near [[Bordeaux]], 24 December 1880, and was buried at Eskadale. His son Charles Edward Stuart Allen, the last self-styled Count of Albany, died in [[Jersey]] in 1882. He had married Lady Alice Hay (1835-1881), a daughter of the 18th Earl of Erroll, but they had no issue.\n==='''Sources'''===\nHugh Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts: their claim to be descended from Prince Charlie'' (Inverness, 1909).

They claimed that Thomas had, for fear of kidnapping or assassination, been brought secretly to England on a ship captained by their grandfather, Admiral John Carter Allen (1725-1800), and adopted by him. Thomas was thus, they claimed, \u2018de jure monarch of England in place of the then reigning sovereign Queen Victoria\u2019.<ref>[[Sir Charles Petrie]], ''The Jacobite Movement: the last phase: 1716-1807'' (London, 1950) 189.</ref>\n\n\u2018They succeeded in fabricating around them an aura of bogus royalty which attracted the allegiance of a few romantic Jacobites in Victorian times\u2019.<ref>James Lees-Milne, ''The last Stuarts'' (1984) page 230.</ref> Herbert Vaughan called their story \u2018an impudent fabrication\u2019 and \u2018an unblushing fraud\u2019<ref>Herbert M. Vaughan, ''The last of the royal Stuarts: Henry Stuart, Cardinal Duke of York'' (1906) page 280</ref> but it was as Sir Charles Petrie wrote \u2018proof of the hold which the House of Stuart has never ceased to exercise upon popular imagination in the British Isles, so that ... if a man were to declare himself the heir to the Yorkist or Tudor dynasty, he would attract but little attention, yet if he claim to be a Stuart he will find hundreds ready to believe him\u2019.<ref>Sir Charles Petrie, ''The Jacobite movement: the last phase: 1716-1807'' (London, 1950) 187.</ref>\n\nThe brothers\u2019 two publications, [[Vestiarium Scoticum]] (Edinburgh, 1842) and ''Costume of the Clans'' (Edinburgh, 1843), described by the historian Hugh Trevor-Roper as \u2018shot through with pure fantasy and bare faced forgery\u2019,<ref>\u2018Invention of tradition; the Highland tradition of Scotland\u2019 in Eric Hobsbawm and Terrence Ranger, eds., ''The invention of tradition'' (University of Cambridge, 1983)</ref> have been sources widely used by the tartan industry in Scotland.\n==='''Family Background'''===\nThe brothers\u2019 grandfather, John Carter Allen (1725-1800), an admiral in the British navy, had three children: the above-named Lieutenant Thomas Allen (1767-1852), Jane or Jean Allen (c.1768-1829) who married Thomas Robinson, a widower, at [[Brighton]] in 1788, and Admiral John Allen (1771-1853). The three were named in John Carter Allen\u2019s will, though he bequeathed only \u00a3100 to Thomas and \u00a3100 and a pair of silver candlesticks to Jane, leaving \u00a32,200 and the residue to John. This disparity caused comment and some have speculated that Thomas was illegitimate, but an income had been guaranteed to him under his marriage settlement in 1792. \n\nHowever, additional research in 2014 showed that John Carter Allen did not marry until 1780 and that his three children were all illegitimate, born in a period in which he held no commission.<ref>John Charnock, ''Biographia Navalis'', vol. 6 (1798) 288.</ref> The three were named \u2018natural children of John Cator Allen\u2019 in the twelfth of sixteen codicils to the will of Elizabeth Arnold, his first wife\u2019s mother, dated in 1788 and proved in 1789. She left them twenty guineas each and \u00a31,000 to their father.<ref>Anthony Camp, New light on the Sobieski Stuarts, in ''Genealogists' Magazine'', vol. 31, no. 8 (December 2014) 298-306.</ref> The identity of their mother(s) has not been found. There was much tension in the family later and at one time the youngest son, John, was heard to say of Thomas, \u2018he is no brother of mine\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts: their claim to be descended from Prince Charlie'' (1909) 102.</ref>\n\nJohn Carter Allen himself had been baptised at St Dunstan in the West in 1724/5, the son of Carter Allen (1700-1734), an attorney in the parish of St Clement Eastcheap in the [[City of London]], who had married Emma Hay or Hays at St Giles, Camberwell, in 1724. These details also were not known until 2014. Contemporaries of John Carter Allen had said at his death in 1800 that the late Lord Hillsborough (who died in 1793 and for whom John Carter Allen\u2019s younger brother William Allen (1729-1811) had worked as an office clerk) had said that \u2018he had a claim to the title of Erroll ... as being descended from the old Earl Hay in the male line\u2019,<ref>Letter of William Scott in ''Gentleman\u2019s Magazine'', 1800, vol. i, page 1021.</ref> a worthless statement as the peerage had become extinct in the male line in 1717,<ref>''The Complete Peerage'', vol. v (1926) pages 99-100</ref> but believed by Thomas who added Hay to his name.\n\nHowever, the uncertainty of their descent and the romantic nature of the various claims surrounding them greatly influenced the two brothers. They also added Hay to their names and in 1822 the eldest son, as John Hay Allan, published a ''Genealogical table of the Hays, from William de Haya, cupbearer to Malcolm IV, 1170, down to 1840, with all the branches'' (Edinburgh, 1840), though his descent is not shown in the book and the parentage of Emma Hay or Hays has not been found.\n==='''Thomas Allen'''===\nAlthough frequently referred to as Captain Allen, Thomas Allen never attained that rank. He retired from the Navy as a Lieutenant in 1798 and his subsequent history and movements and the extent to which he approved of his sons\u2019 later claims, are all far from clear. He had married Catherine Matilda Manning, a daughter of the Rev. [[Owen Manning]] the historian of [[Surrey]], at Godalming in 1792.  They had three children: (1) John Carter Allen, born at Oystermouth, [[Glamorgan]],  4 August 1795 and baptised there, 5 October 1795; (2) Matilda Allen, born at Oystermouth, Glamorgan, 18 October 1799 and baptised there, 12 January 1800; and (3) Charles Manning Allen, born at Rotherfield Grays, [[Oxfordshire]], 4 July 1802 and baptised there, 3 August 1802. Under their marriage settlement the couple and their future children had a life interest and income from properties in Mare Street and Well Street, [[Hackney, London|Hackney]]. \n\nHowever, sometime about 1807 Thomas Allen formed a connection with a much younger woman, Ann, who was born in Hackney about 1790, and by whom he had five illegitimate children between 1808 and 1829. Her surname is usually given as Salmon (as she had a niece of that name living with her in 1851) but the death certificates of several of her children show it as Burton. The first child, William (died 1878), who used the surname MacGarrow, claimed to have been born in Glamorganshire or Wales but his baptism and the exact whereabouts of Thomas and Ann at this time have not been determined. It is said that from 1816 to 1829 Thomas was based at Boulogne, \u2018a safe refuge for English debtors\u2019.<ref>''Notes and Queries'', vol. 197 (1952) 456</ref> He certainly had increasing financial problems and in February 1817 he unsuccessfully appealed to the former [[Lord Chancellor]], Lord Erskine, for help with the possible sale of some of the property held in trust under his marriage settlement. A last minute attempt to come to an arrangement about it failed and on 17 January 1818, as the result of an action in the Court of Kings Bench against Thomas and his son John (in a plea of debt for \u00a3300 and damages by James Barstow), Thomas was imprisoned for debt in the [[Fleet Prison]]. He was released by order of the Court for Relief of Insolvent Debtors on 20 December 1819 but continued to live in fear of his creditors. \n\nHis reticence and desired anonymity was probably due to his illegitimacy and his relationship with Anne, but it was complicated by the later statements of his two legitimate sons on whom he looked with some displeasure. He had little in common with them and they in turn looked down on Anne as \u2018of much lower rank in life\u2019 than their mother.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 20-21, 102-3.</ref> Thomas and Anne apparently had their last child, Gilbert Hay Allen (1829-1902), in south London in 1829 and in 1839 Thomas was in hiding at 10 Portland Place North, Clapham Road, [[Lambeth]], as \u2018Mr Salmond\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 102.</ref> In the 1841 census he was entered at that address as \u2018Thomas MacGaradh\u2019, aged 70, and born in Scotland. He ostensibly registered the death of his wife Catherine Matilda at Portland Place North, on 14 February 1841, again calling himself Thomas MacGaradh, but describing her as \u2018Matilda Manning, widow\u2019. When the census was taken a few months later Anne was living with him at this address as Anne MacGaradh. MacGaradh was, his sons said, a war-cry of the Hay family but it was entirely their creation and it seems likely that they or Anne were responsible for their father\u2019s statements. The death of Catherine Matilda in 1841 did, however, eventually allow the purchase by Charles of the family\u2019s life interest in the trust properties from his father\u2019s bankruptcy assignees.\n\nIt is said that Thomas \u2018spent the last seven years of his life in bed\u2019,<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 89, 102.</ref> confined to his room at 22 Henry Street, Pentonville. He was there as \u2018John Salmon\u2019 when the Census was taken in 1851 and he died at that address as Thomas Hay Allen on 14 February 1852. He was buried in that name at St Giles in the Fields, Middlesex, on 23 February 1852, aged 84. His son, Charles, in order to distance himself from him, wrote in 1877 that his father was called James and had died in 1839. Some believed that he was buried at Old St Pancras, Middlesex (as stated in the introduction to the 1892 edition of his sons\u2019 ''The costume of the clans'', xvii, and repeated in the ''Dictionary of National Biography'') and Beveridge added \u2018but the stone said to have been placed over his grave cannot now be found\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 89-90.</ref>\n\n==='''Sobieski Stuarts'''===\nNo detail of the educations of Thomas\u2019s two sons has been found though they claimed that the secret of their royal descent had been revealed to them about 1811, that they had fought for [[Napoleon]] at [[Dresden]] (in August 1813), [[Leipzig]] (October 1813) and [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] (June 1815) and had learned [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] in London. The youngest, Charles Manning Allen, who we now know was not born until 1802, married at St George, Hanover Square, on 9 October 1822, Anna Gardiner, who had an income from property in [[Ireland]] and was the widow of Major Charles Gardiner (1780-1818), the childless only son of [[General William Gardiner]] (1748-1806; DNB) former British Minister in [[Brussels]] and [[Warsaw]] and younger brother of [[Luke Gardiner, 1st Viscount Mountjoy]]  (1745-1798). The marriage was publicised as that of \u2018Charles Stuart Hay Allen\u2019. However, the couple moved to Scotland after marriage and their first child, Anna Marie Stuart, born 27 July 1823, was baptised at [[Edinburgh]] and there recorded in the surname Hay on 20 October 1823. \n\nThomas\u2019s eldest son, John Carter Allen, calling himself John Hay Allan, had apparently already been in Scotland for some time and in 1822 he published a volume of poems, ''Bridal of Caolchairn, and other poems'' (London, 1822) dedicated to the [[Duke of Argyll]], and revealing a fair knowledge of that county but including several allusions to his claimed descent from the Hays of Errol. From 1826 to 1829, John joined his brother Charles at Windy Hill (now Milton Brodie), Alves, [[Morayshire]], under the patronage of the Earl of Moray.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 25.</ref> The brothers were at Logie House, Edinkillie, Morayshire, from 1829 to 1838,<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 25.</ref> when John used the name Stuart Allan. As John Sobieski Stuart he and his brother, calling themselves \u2018grandsons to the Pretender\u2019, had visited Ireland in May 1836.<ref>''The Times'', 9 May 1836, quoting the ''Glasgow Chronicle'' (John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 37-38).</ref> Lord Lovat then built \u2018an antique shooting lodge\u2019 for them on Eilean Aigas, an islet in the river Beauly, near Eskadale, Inverness, and there, always wearing the Stuart tartan, they held court from 1838 to 1845, attending the catholic church at Eskadale and being known as \u2018the Princes\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 93.</ref> The house is described as \u2018a very elegant mansion of the Elizabethan style\u2019 in the ''New Statistical Account of Scotland'' (1842).<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 93.</ref> On 18 October 1845, John married at St Martin-in-the-Fields, [[Westminster]], Georgina, eldest surviving daughter of Edward Kendall, J.P., of Austrey, Warwickshire.<ref>''Burke\u2019s Landed Gentry'' (1858) page 643.</ref> She had, he told [[Robert Chambers]]{{dn|date=April 2020}}, \u2018only ten thousand pounds, unless she survives her two sisters, who equally share with her\u2019,<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 100.</ref> but the couple then moved to live in London.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 27.</ref> In his letter to Chambers just prior to the marriage John asked for a loan of \u00a3100 until his wife\u2019s dividends were paid but when his father-in-law eventually died in March 1872 the total estate was sworn  at \u2018Under \u00a31,500\u2019 and later as \u2018Under \u00a32,000\u2019.<ref>Principal Probate Registry, 10 June 1872.</ref>\n\nThomas Allen\u2019s daughter Matilda had married Henry Timothy Boisquet de la Fleuriere, at St Alphege, [[Greenwich]], in 1818, and their son, Napoleon de la Fleuriere (1823-1881), was baptised at St Margaret, Westminster, in 1823. According to Matilda, her husband had been in the French service from 1804 to 1814 and from 1832 to 1853, but had been taken prisoner at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]] and did not return to France until 1830. In 1835 using the name Matilda McFleur she then married at St Mary Abbots, [[Kensington]], one Alexander McCaskery (died 1870), a police serjeant in [[Fulham]], by whom she had at least three children. This seems not to have stopped her from soliciting the Cross of an Officer of the [[Legion d\u2019Honneur]] for Henry Timothy in 1854. Her date of death has not been found.\n\nIn Scotland the brothers \u2018conducted themselves as members of a reigning dynasty who wished to preserve their incognito\u2019<ref>Sir Charles Petrie, ''The Jacobite Movement: the last phase: 1716-1807'' (London, 1950) 191.</ref> and  their claims \u2018were accorded a level of credence\u2019 (as the ''Dictionary of National Biography'' said at the end of the century) by \u2018men of rank and intelligence, such as the tenth [[Earl of Moray]] (1771-1848), the fourteenth [[Lord Lovat]] (1802-1875), the late [[Marquis of Bute]] (1793-1848), [[Sir Thomas Dick-Lauder, Bt]] (1784-1848), and [[Robert Chambers]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} (1802-1871)\u2019. However, the delusional John Sobieski Stuart, in spite of his expressed desire to withdraw from the public eye, went so far as to claim, in a letter to Chambers, that he and his brother had \u2018a body of supporters ready to push their claims to the uttermost\u2019.<ref>Sir Charles Petrie, ''The Jacobite Movement: the last phase: 1716-1807'' (London, 1950) 191-2].</ref>\n==='''The Claims'''===\nIn June 1829 the elder brother had shown a manuscript, containing tartan patterns and dated in 1721, to Sir Thomas Dick-Lauder who was much impressed by it, but [[Sir Walter Scott]] warned Dick-Lauder that the brothers \u2018are men of warm imaginations ... of much accomplishment but little probity \u2013 that is, in antiquarian matters\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 59.</ref> Sir Walter Scott, who died in 1832, had rejected the entire notion of clan tartans, saying that the \u2018idea of distinguishing the clans by their tartans is but a fashion of modern date\u2019. On behalf of the Society of Scottish Antiquaries he was shown a transcript of part of the brothers\u2019 manuscript but from its language alone \u2018indignantly declared his conviction that the MS itself must be an absolute fabrication\u2019.<ref>''Quarterly Review'', vol. 81, June-September 1847, page 64.</ref> Scott remembered seeing one of the brothers wearing the badge of [[High Constable of Scotland]] (as the Earls of Errol were), \u2018which he could have no more right to wear than the Crown\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 24.</ref> Dick-Lauder was himself an author of historical romances and had put up a monument to the Lauder family in Edinburgh showing a quite spurious descent, but one \u2018as he wished it to be\u2019.<ref>''Complete Baronetage'' (vol. 4, 1904) page 362, note a.</ref>\n\nHowever, calling himself John Sobieski Stuart, the elder brother then produced the lavish ''[[Vestiarium Scoticum]]'' (Edinburgh, 1842), costing ten guineas, which purported to be a reproduction, with colour illustrations, of a better version of the 1721 manuscript, this one being dated to 1571. This John claimed had passed through the hands of Prince Charles Edward Stuart to his father Thomas, though his father\u2019s letter on the subject, addressed to him as Ian and signed \u2018J. T. Stuart Hay\u2019 in 1829,<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 60.</ref> seems likely to be bogus. \n\nConsiderable interest in clans and tartans continued, and the following year, under the name John Sobieski Stolberg Stuart, John and his brother Charles published ''The costume of the clans: with observations upon the literature, arts, manufactures and commerce of the Highland and Western Isles during the middle ages; and the influence of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries upon their present condition'' (Edinburgh, 1843) which, as noted above, received intense criticism.\n\nUsing the names John Sobieski Stuart and Charles Edward Stuart the brothers followed this with their ''Tales of the Century, or sketches of the romances of history between 1745 and 1845'' (Edinburgh, 1847) in which they provided three scenes of the birth, youth and marriage of a man known by the Gaelic name of ''Iolair dhearg'' or the ''Red Eagle'', said to have been recounted by an aged Jacobite in exile, Dr Beaton. After being called to attend the birth of a son to a young woman in [[Tuscany]] in 1773, where portraits of the Old and Young Pretenders were prominent, Beaton claimed to have  been sworn to secrecy, but later to have seen a baby taken on board a British warship, ''HMS Albina'', under Commodore O\u2019Haloran. In the second tale, some years later, the grown child arrived in the Western Highlands of Scotland where, allthough called O\u2019Haloran and thought to be the son of the former captain, he is known as ''The Red Eagle'' and addressed as a prince. In the third tale, which takes place in the [[Peak District]] of [[Derbyshire]], a traveller meets ''The Red Eagle'' who, after various adventures, marries at [[Berwick]]{{dn|date=March 2020}}, Catharine Bruce, the daughter of a Derbyshire local landowner.\n \nThe stories, taken together, were designed in a roundabout way to suggest that the brothers\u2019 supposed grandfather was in reality Commodore O\u2019Haloran, and that the child, their father (known as Thomas Allen), was in reality the child of Prince Charles Edward Stuart and Louise of Stolberg, and thus de jure monarch of England. Athough the tales were \u2018copiously augmented with historical notes\u2019,<ref>Hugh Douglas, ''Bonnie Prince Charlie in love'' (1995) 218.</ref> in truth Admiral John Carter Allen did not command any ship in 1773, being on half-pay from 1771 to 1775.\n\nA strong attack on both the ''Vestiarium Scoticum'' and their ''Tales of the Century'' then followed and the brothers ancestral claims, which had received little acceptance in England, and the ''Vestiarium'' were completely discredited in a devastating anonymous article \u2018The heirs of the Stuarts\u2019, believed to be by [[George Skene]] (1807-1875), Professor of Law at [[Glasgow University]], which appeared in the ''Quarterly Review'', vol. 81 (June-September 1847) 57-85. He concluded about the ''Vestiarium'' that \u2018this pretended MS of the sixteenth century is an absolute fabrication, and of no authority whatever\u2019 and about the ''Tales'' that Prince Charles Edward Stuart \u2018could have had no possible reason for concealing the birth of an heir\u2019; any idea that he had \u2018left a legitimate male progeny\u2019 was \u2018the silliest of dreams\u2019.\n \nIn 1848 John attempted ''A reply to the Quarterly Review upon the Vestiarium Scoticum'' (Edinburgh, 1848) and the two brothers then produced ''Lays of the deer forest: with sketches of olden and modern deer-hunting'' (2 vols. Edinburgh, 1848), but three of their benefactors, the Earl of Moray, the Marquis of Bute and Thomas Dick-Lauder, died that year and the brothers were now so discredited that Charles took his wife to Prague where their son was in the Austrian army<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 101; ''Dictionary of National Biography''.</ref> and John followed soon after.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 27.</ref> John\u2019s wife died at [[Presburg]] in 1862 and the brothers did not return to England until 1868. In London they then occupied themselves with research, being well-known figures in the [[British Museum]], wearing Highland dress or military tunics and using pens embellished with gold coronets.\n\nJohn, who called himself \u2018The Chevalier John Sobieski Stewart\u2019, in 1871 described himself as Count d\u2019Albanie, Colonel of Hussars, and said that he was born at Versailles, France. He died without issue at 52 Stanley Street, St George Hanover Square, 13 February 1872, aged 74, and was buried at Eskadale. His widow died at Bath in 1888.\n\nJohn's brother Charles then assumed the title of Count of Albany and was active in Catholic circles in London but died from the same address (by then called 52 Alderney Street) on a trip to [[France]] on the Steamer ''Rainbow'' near [[Bordeaux]], 24 December 1880, and was buried at Eskadale. His son Charles Edward Stuart Allen, the last self-styled Count of Albany, died in [[Jersey]] in 1882. He had married Lady Alice Hay (1835-1881), a daughter of the 18th Earl of Erroll, but they had no issue.\n==='''Sources'''===\nHugh Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts: their claim to be descended from Prince Charlie'' (Inverness, 1909).

With the use of SMS and voice calls, group coordination is organized through singular calls/text messages to each individual group member. Although, one person can send the same text message to multiple group members, the group members can't see the responses of everyone else or even know who's in the group at all. Group members only have access to the messages they either send or receive, which hinders group coordination. With the introduction of messaging apps, users can form group chats, where all the members can see an entire thread of everyone's responses. Members can also respond directly to each other, rather than having to go through the member who started the group message, to relay the information. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ling |first1=Rich |last2=Lai |first2=Chih-Hui |title=Microcoordination 2.0: Social Coordination in the Age of Smartphones and Messaging Apps. |journal=Journal of Communication |date=October 6, 2016 |volume=66 |issue=5 |pages=834\u2013856 |doi=10.1111/jcom.12251 }}</ref>\n\n==Features==\nMessaging apps each have some of the following features:\n\n* Chat\n** One-on-one chat\n** Group chat\n** Broadcast lists\n** [[Chatbots]] (including \"bot in group chats\")\n** \"Smart replies\" (suggested replies to incoming messages provided by Google's Reply platform )<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ausdroid.net/2018/02/22/googles-new-reply-app-makes-appearance-link-install-inside/|title=Google's new Reply app makes an appearance, link to install inside - Ausdroid|website=ausdroid.net|date=2018-02-22}}</ref>\n* Calls\n** Voice calls\n** Video calls\n* Audio alerts (on Line)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedrum.com/news/2016/05/07/economist-talks-advantages-line-over-whatsapp-mobile-messaging-push|title=The Economist talks on advantages of Line over Whatsapp for mobile messaging push|publisher=}}</ref>\n* [[File sharing]]\n* Games\n* \"Mini Programs\" (e.g. WeChat Mini Program)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://open.wechat.com/cgi-bin/newreadtemplate?t=overseas_open/docs/mini-programs/development/brief-tutorial|title=Brief Tutorial - WeChat Open Platform|website=open.wechat.com}}</ref>\n* News discovery (e.g. Snapchat Discover)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://digiday.com/media/snap-tries-to-make-tv-and-magazines-coexist-on-snapchat-discover/|title=Does Snapchat Discover want to be TV or magazines?

Starting his career at the now-defunct game company [[Cavia (company)|Cavia]], he became known for his work on the [[action role-playing video game]] series ''[[Drakengard]]'' and its two spin-offs: ''[[Nier (video game)|Nier]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Nier: Automata]]''. Yoko was born in [[Nagoya]], [[Aichi Prefecture|Aichi]], and studied at the [[Kobe Design University]] in the 1990s. While initially not intending to pursue a career in video games, after working at Namco and Sony, he joined Cavia and became the director and scenario writer for the first ''Drakengard'' game. He has since worked extensively on every game in the series (except ''Drakengard 2''), as well as on mobile titles after becoming a freelancer after Cavia's absorption into [[AQ Interactive]].\n\nYoko has become known for his style of game design, incorporating unconventional design choices and stories. One of the main aspects of his work is exploring the darker aspects of people, such as why they are driven to kill each other, although he typically does not share a common opinion on his story's dark natures. His writing technique, described as \"backwards scriptwriting,\" involves outlining the ending of the story first and building the narrative backward from that point. Due to his disdain from being photographed, he generally wears a mask when giving interviews or presenting games.\n\n==Biography==\nYoko Taro was born in [[Nagoya]], [[Aichi Prefecture|Aichi]], on June 6, 1970.<ref name=\"BukkoroYoko\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bukkoro.com/about_member.html|title=BUKKORO / ABOUT|publisher=Bukkoro.com|accessdate=2014-07-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726100840/http://www.bukkoro.com/_about/index.html|archivedate=2014-07-26|url-status=live}}</ref> Yoko's parents were often absent at their jobs, so he was mostly raised by his grandmother, who left a strong impression on him.<ref name=\"YokoFamily\">{{cite web|url=http://ameblo.jp/yokota6/entry-11503448652.html|title=\u3010\u65e5\u8a18\u3011\u304a\u3070\u3042\u3061\u3083\u3093\u304c\u6b7b\u3093\u3060\u3002|publisher=Diary of Taro Yoko (blog)|last=Yoko|first=Taro|date=2013-04-02|accessdate=2014-07-26}}</ref> During his youth, he heard about an incident that would influence his later work as a scenario writer: while an acquaintance was in a shopping street with a group of friends, one of them who was walking along a high building roof slipped and died from the fall.

Starting his career at the now-defunct game company [[Cavia (company)|Cavia]], he became known for his work on the [[action role-playing video game]] series ''[[Drakengard]]'' and its two spin-offs: ''[[Nier (video game)|Nier]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Nier: Automata]]''. Yoko was born in [[Nagoya]], [[Aichi Prefecture|Aichi]], and studied at the [[Kobe Design University]] in the 1990s. While initially not intending to pursue a career in video games, after working at Namco and Sony, he joined Cavia and became the director and scenario writer for the first ''Drakengard'' game. He has since worked extensively on every game in the series (except ''Drakengard 2''), as well as on mobile titles after becoming a freelancer after Cavia's absorption into [[AQ Interactive]].\n\nYoko has become known for his style of game design, incorporating unconventional design choices and stories. One of the main aspects of his work is exploring the darker aspects of people, such as why they are driven to kill each other, although he typically does not share a common opinion on his story's dark natures. His writing technique, described as \"backwards scriptwriting,\" involves outlining the ending of the story first and building the narrative backward from that point. Due to his disdain from being photographed, he generally wears a mask when giving interviews or presenting games.\n\n==Biography==\nYoko Taro was born in [[Nagoya]], [[Aichi Prefecture|Aichi]], on June 6, 1970.<ref name=\"BukkoroYoko\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bukkoro.com/about_member.html|title=BUKKORO / ABOUT|publisher=Bukkoro.com|accessdate=2014-07-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726100840/http://www.bukkoro.com/_about/index.html|archivedate=2014-07-26|url-status=live}}</ref> Yoko's parents were often absent at their jobs, so he was mostly raised by his grandmother, who left a strong impression on him.<ref name=\"YokoFamily\">{{cite web|url=http://ameblo.jp/yokota6/entry-11503448652.html|title=\u3010\u65e5\u8a18\u3011\u304a\u3070\u3042\u3061\u3083\u3093\u304c\u6b7b\u3093\u3060\u3002|publisher=Diary of Taro Yoko (blog)|last=Yoko|first=Taro|date=2013-04-02|accessdate=2014-07-26}}</ref> During his youth, he heard about an incident that would influence his later work as a scenario writer: while an acquaintance was in a shopping street with a group of friends, one of them who was walking along a high building roof slipped and died from the fall.
