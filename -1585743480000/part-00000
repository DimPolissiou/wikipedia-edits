The newspaper was critical of, and sometimes directly opposed to, the actions of the Japanese government during [[Japanese occupation of Korea|Japanese colonial rule]] (1910\u20131945).\n\nOn 27 August 1920, the ''Chosun Ilbo'' was suspended after it published an editorial criticizing what it said was the use of excessive force by the Japanese police against Korean citizens. This was the first in a string of suspensions. On 5 September 1920, three days after the first suspension was lifted, the newspaper published an editorial, \"Did the Japanese central governing body shut down our newspaper?\" Then, ''Chosun Ilbo'' was given an indefinite suspension.\n\nIn 1927, the ''Chosun Ilbo''{{'}}s editor and publisher were arrested. The editor was also the chief staff writer. The alleged offense in this case was an editorial describing the mistreatment of prisoners by the colonial government. In May of the same year, in response to an editorial criticizing the deployment of troops into [[Shandong]], the newspaper was suspended for a fourth time - in this case for 133 days. The publisher and chief staff writer, An Jae-hong, were again imprisoned.\n\nAfter these events, the ''Chosun Ilbo'' remained at the forefront of events, trying to improve general public life and sponsoring collaborative events. This was a turbulent period; within the space of three years, the president was replaced three times. On 21 December 1935, in opposition to compulsory Japanese education and plans to assimilate the Korean people and language, the ''Chosun Ilbo'' published 100,000 Korean-language textbooks nationwide.\n\nOver the years, the ''Chosun Ilbo'' company also published many additional titles, including a monthly current affairs magazine, ''Youth Chosun'', the first of its kind in Korea. Others included its sister publication, ''Jogwang''.\n\nIn the summer of 1940, following issue 6,923, the paper was declared officially discontinued by the Japanese ruling government. In the twenty years since its founding, the paper had been suspended by the Japanese government four times, and its issues confiscated over five hundred times before 1932.\n\nWhen [[Liberation of Korea|Korea gained independence]] in 1945, the ''Chosun Ilbo'' came back into publication after a five-year, three-month hiatus.\n\n== Subsidiaries ==\nBesides the daily newspaper, the company also publishes the weekly ''Jugan Chosun'', the monthly ''Wolgan Chosun'' and other newspapers and magazines.

There is a subset within this category called '''Additional Deities''' which has deities not mentioned in the core rulebooks but instead in supplements and as such considered additions to the core category.\n# Alternate human pantheons \u2013 This lists the pantheons and the deities within them that are presented in the supplement book ''[[Deities & Demigods]]''. Most are based upon real-life mythology.\n# Non-deity powers \u2013 These beings would fit into the previous category, but are not actually deities, plus most of them aren't the patron of a specific monstrous race. This includes the demon princes and archdevils as well as some other godlike beings.\n\nBefore third edition, there was no Core Setting, so the distinctions above are not as clear-cut. For the most part, materials which did not specify a setting were assumed to be at least compatible with the World of Greyhawk if not outright parts of the canon. As such, those prior materials are covered in the setting-specific lists of deities.\n\nThe book ''[[Monster Mythology]]'', however, was considered to be canon for core materials for the gods of non-human races in second edition.\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Ranks of Divine Power===\nFor game purposes, each deity has a divine rank, which determines how much power the entity has, from lowest to highest:\n*Quasi-deities or hero deities. Beings of this rank are immortal but usually cannot grant spells to worshippers.\n*Demigods. They are the weakest of the deities, and are able to grant spells and perform a few deeds that are beyond mortal limits.\n*Lesser deities. These entities can perform more powerful deeds than demigods can, and have keener senses where their portfolios are concerned.\n*Intermediate deities. These entities control larger godly realms than demigods or lesser gods.\n*Greater deities. These entities typically have millions of mortal worshippers, and they command respect even among other deities. Some rule over pantheons of other deities.\n*Overdeities. These entities are beyond the understanding and knowledge of mortals and care nothing for worshippers.\n\n===Portfolios===\nEvery deity has certain aspects of existence over which it has dominion, power, and control. Collectively, these aspects represent a deity's portfolio.\n\n===Domains===\nEach deity that can grant spells has multiple domains that give clerics access to extra spells and abilities from that domain. Which domains are associated with a deity is largely a function of the deity's portfolio.\n\n===Divine hierarchy===\nMany deities are arranged in pantheons, which are often led by Greater deities which are their direct superiors. The individual deities in a pantheon may not be forced to obey their superiors, although they typically respect and fear the superior deity.\n\n==''Dungeons & Dragons''==\n''[[Gods, Demi-gods & Heroes]]'' (1976) included the [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]], [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]], [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]], [[Norse mythology|Norse]], [[Finnish mythology|Finnish]], [[Aztec mythology|Aztec]], [[Mayan mythology|Mayan]], [[Chinese mythology|Chinese]], and [[Japanese mythology|Japanese]] [[mythology|mythologies]], as well as [[Robert E.

They selected and altered deities to correspond to \"iconic\" aspects of core D&D. Most core deities are human deities; except for the chief gods of the demihuman races. Certain aspects of the deities were altered to make them more generic \u2013 for example: the \"Core\" Heironeous favors the longsword (in order to make the favored weapon of the \"God of Chivalry\" more traditionally knight-like), as contrasted with the original \"Greyhawk\" Heironeous, who favors the battleaxe.\n\nThe designation of \"greater\" vs. \"intermediate\" comes from ''Legends & Lore'' (1990). It is not used in [[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons|any edition of]] the ''Player's Handbook'', but it is used in ''[[Deities and Demigods]]'' (2002) and various v3.5 [[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons|Edition]] materials.\n\n===''Core'' D&D-pantheons===\n====Greater deities====\n*Boccob, god of magic, arcane knowledge, balance and foresight.<ref name=\"PHB35\">{{cite book |authorlink=Jonathan Tweet|last=Tweet |first=Jonathan |authorlink2=Monte Cook|last2=Cook|first2=Monte |authorlink3=Skip Williams|last3=Williams|first3=Skip |title=Player's Handbook: Core Rulebook I v.3.5 |year=2003 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-2886-7}}</ref>{{rp|32,106}}<ref name=\"Deities\">{{cite book |authorlink=Rich Redman|last=Redman |first=Rich |authorlink2=Skip Williams|last2=Williams|first2=Skip |authorlink3=James Wyatt (game designer)|last3=Wyatt|first3=James |title=[[Deities and Demigods]] |year=2002 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-2654-6}}</ref>{{rp|60}}\n*[[Corellon Larethian]], god of [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|elves]], magic, music, and arts (also a demihuman power).<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,106}}<ref name=\"Deities\" />{{rp|62}}<ref name=\"Wild\">{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Skip |title=Races of the Wild |year=2005 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-3438-7}}</ref>{{rp|20}}\n*Garl Glittergold, god of [[Gnome (Dungeons & Dragons)|gnomes]], humor, and gemcutting (also a demihuman power).<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,107}}<ref name=\"Deities\" />{{rp|69}}<ref name=\"Stone\">{{cite book |authorlink=David Noonan (game designer)|last=Noonan |first=David |authorlink2=Jesse Decker|last2=Decker|first2=Jesse |authorlink3=Michelle Lyons|last3=Lyons|first3=Michelle |title=[[Races of Stone]] |year=2004 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-3278-3}}</ref>{{rp|43}}<ref name=\"CD\">{{cite book |last=Noonan |first=David |title=Complete Divine |year=2004 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-3272-4}}</ref>{{rp|109,112}}\n*[[Gruumsh]], god of orcs (also a monster power).<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,107}}<ref name=\"Deities\" />{{rp|71}}\n*[[Moradin]], god of [[Dwarf (Dungeons & Dragons)|dwarves]] (also a demihuman power)<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,107}}<ref name=\"Deities\" />{{rp|83}}<ref name=\"Stone\" />{{rp|17}}\n*[[Nerull]], god of death, darkness, murder and the underworld.<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,108}}<ref name=\"LibrisMortis\">{{cite book |last=Collins |first=Andy |authorlink=Andy Collins (game designer)|first2=Bruce R.|last2=Cordell|authorlink2=Bruce R.

Being monotheistic, it of course consists of only one deity (though said deity is described as having two aspects; a creator one and a destroyer one):\n\n*Taiia, greater goddess of creation, destruction, mortal life and death.\n\n====Following the Light====\nFollowing the Light is a fictional [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] religion presented in and constructed according to the guidelines given for dualistic religions in 3rd Edition Deities and Demigods. Being dualistic, it consists of two, polar-opposite deities:\n\n*Elishar, intermediate deity of positive energy, light and prophecy.\n*Toldoth, intermediate deity of negative energy, darkness and destruction.\n\n====Dennari====\nThe faith of Dennari is a fictional [[mystery cult]], presented in and constructed according to the guidelines given for mystery cults in 3rd Edition ''[[Deities & Demigods]]''. It worships a single deity of the same name:\n\n*Dennari, lesser goddess of earth, liberation and suffering.\n\n=== Nondeity powers ===\nSimilar to monster powers, these are not true deities but very powerful extraplanar beings.

Although they are not truly rulers of their planes, archomentals like to consider themselves as much and often grant themselves regal titles like Prince or Princess.

Almost nothing is known about her; her origin, her race, her motives and her level of power are all obscure, although she is sometimes shown to have absolutely immense power. The Lady of Pain refuses to tolerate anyone who worships her, killing those who do so. Again; virtually nothing is known about her, apart from the fact that she has the power to slay gods who displease her.\n\n==== Vestiges ====\nThese entities are outside the boundary of life, death, and undeath. They are untouchable by even the most powerful deities although they can be summoned and used by the weakest mortal through pact magic and binding.

Implied to be the creator of humans, the devils wiped out all knowledge of his name, which they fear is powerful enough to revive him if it is ever spoken aloud again. The Nine Hells were originally his astral domain, now a prison for Asmodeus and his devils. A holy chalice belonging to him is mentioned in ''Divine Power''.\n* Khala \u2013 Goddess of Winter, wife of Zehir, Khala sought to trap the natural world in an eternal winter to secure power over it. Her plans convinced the primal spirits to expel gods and primordials from the world. She was killed by the other gods in a conflict called the War of Winter, who afterwards made a compact to balance darkness and light (Zehir and Pelor), and the natural seasons (Corellon, Pelor and Sehanine). Her power over winter was taken by the [[Raven Queen]].\n*[[Lakal]] \u2013 God of Healing and Mercy who was also her own Astral Dominion. She was an impersonal deity who communicated with her chosen people, the Quom, through \"ecstatic moments of personal communion.\" She extolled mercy and urged her followers to dedicate themselves to pursuits that benefited the whole cosmos. Lakal's death was accidental \u2013 when Bahamut battled Nihil, the Primordial of nothingness, the pair crashed into Lakal. Bahamut was able to use the distraction to slay Nihil, but the primordial's death throes also caused Lakal to explode. The surviving quom now roam the planes, retrieving any shards of Lakal that they can find, including those unknowingly consumed by living creatures. Such creatures, including humanoids and player characters, are considered collateral damage in the quom's quest to restore Lakal. Ironically, even if the quom succeed in their quest, the restored Lakal would be disgusted with their methods.<ref>[[Rob Heinsoo|Heinsoo, Rob]], ''[[The Plane Above]]''.

Killed by The [[Raven Queen]].\n*[[Tuern]] \u2013 God of War. Killed by [[Bane (Forgotten Realms)|Bane]].\n* Nusemnee \u2013 Nusemnee was the daughter of [[Zehir]]. When she failed to assassinate a high priest of [[Pelor]], she was abandoned and then mortally wounded by a paladin's holy blade. Expecting only death, she was surprised when the high priest healed her, showing her compassion and forgiveness. Intrigued, she decided to honor a promise to the high priest and aid him in his holy quest until a time that she could save his life in turn. Nusemnee thus became a symbol of redemption. When she finally died at the end of the high priest's quest, she rose again, this time as a minor goddess. In this form, she opposed her father by offering redemption to all who would turn away from evil. She was later killed by a poison that could kill anything\u2014even a deity\u2014that was distilled from Zehir's blood.<ref name=\"Dragon390\">{{cite book |author=Pierre Van Rooden |magazine=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]] 390 |title=Power Play: Divine - Dead Gods |year=August 2010 |page=47 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast}}</ref>\n\n== Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition ==\nThese are the deities for the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons.

In 1985, the book was renamed ''Legends & Lore'' due to concerns about bad publicity. The Babylonian, Finnish, nonhuman, and Sumerian content were removed to allow room for expansion of the remaining mythoi.<ref name=FAQ>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDDefinitiveFAQ.asp\n | title=Dungeons & Dragons FAQ\n | publisher=Wizards of the Coast\n | accessdate=2008-11-23\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, ''[[Monster Mythology]]'' was published as a sourcebook for the second edition of ''Dungeons & Dragons''. This work re-introduced detailed information on the deities of several non-human pantheons.<ref name=FAQ /> The [[List of Forgotten Realms deities|Faer\u00fbnian pantheon]] for the [[Forgotten Realms]] campaign setting was more fully detailed in 1996\u20131998 with the publication of ''[[Faiths & Avatars]]'', ''Powers & Pantheons'' and ''[[Demihuman Deities]]''.<ref name=FAQ />\n\n===Categories===\nThe deities are grouped into three categories:\n# Core powers \u2013 Deities presented in the ''Player's Handbook 3.5th edition'' or substantially introduced in the other two core books (''Dungeon Master's Guide'' and ''Monster Manual''). Most of these deities are worshipped by [[Human (Dungeons & Dragons)|humans]]. There is a subset within this category called '''Additional Deities''' which has deities not mentioned in the core rulebooks but instead in supplements and as such considered additions to the core category.\n# Alternate human pantheons \u2013 This lists the pantheons and the deities within them that are presented in the supplement book ''[[Deities & Demigods]]''. Most are based upon real-life mythology.\n# Non-deity powers \u2013 These beings would fit into the previous category, but are not actually deities, plus most of them aren't the patron of a specific monstrous race. This includes the demon princes and archdevils as well as some other godlike beings.\n\nBefore third edition, there was no Core Setting, so the distinctions above are not as clear-cut. For the most part, materials which did not specify a setting were assumed to be at least compatible with the World of Greyhawk if not outright parts of the canon. As such, those prior materials are covered in the setting-specific lists of deities.\n\nThe book ''[[Monster Mythology]]'', however, was considered to be canon for core materials for the gods of non-human races in second edition.\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Ranks of Divine Power===\nFor game purposes, each deity has a divine rank, which determines how much power the entity has, from lowest to highest:\n*Quasi-deities or hero deities. Beings of this rank are immortal but usually cannot grant spells to worshippers.\n*Demigods. They are the weakest of the deities, and are able to grant spells and perform a few deeds that are beyond mortal limits.\n*Lesser deities. These entities can perform more powerful deeds than demigods can, and have keener senses where their portfolios are concerned.\n*Intermediate deities. These entities control larger godly realms than demigods or lesser gods.\n*Greater deities. These entities typically have millions of mortal worshippers, and they command respect even among other deities. Some rule over pantheons of other deities.\n*Overdeities. These entities are beyond the understanding and knowledge of mortals and care nothing for worshippers.\n\n===Portfolios===\nEvery deity has certain aspects of existence over which it has dominion, power, and control. Collectively, these aspects represent a deity's portfolio.\n\n===Domains===\nEach deity that can grant spells has multiple domains that give clerics access to extra spells and abilities from that domain. Which domains are associated with a deity is largely a function of the deity's portfolio.\n\n===Divine hierarchy===\nMany deities are arranged in pantheons, which are often led by Greater deities which are their direct superiors. The individual deities in a pantheon may not be forced to obey their superiors, although they typically respect and fear the superior deity.\n\n==''Dungeons & Dragons''==\n''[[Gods, Demi-gods & Heroes]]'' (1976) included the [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]], [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]], [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]], [[Norse mythology|Norse]], [[Finnish mythology|Finnish]], [[Aztec mythology|Aztec]], [[Mayan mythology|Mayan]], [[Chinese mythology|Chinese]], and [[Japanese mythology|Japanese]] [[mythology|mythologies]], as well as [[Robert E.

They selected and altered deities to correspond to \"iconic\" aspects of core D&D. Most core deities are human deities; except for the chief gods of the demihuman races. Certain aspects of the deities were altered to make them more generic \u2013 for example: the \"Core\" Heironeous favors the longsword (in order to make the favored weapon of the \"God of Chivalry\" more traditionally knight-like), as contrasted with the original \"Greyhawk\" Heironeous, who favors the battleaxe.\n\nThe designation of \"greater\" vs. \"intermediate\" comes from ''Legends & Lore'' (1990). It is not used in [[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons|any edition of]] the ''Player's Handbook'', but it is used in ''[[Deities and Demigods]]'' (2002) and various v3.5 [[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons|Edition]] materials.\n\n===''Core'' D&D-pantheons===\n====Greater deities====\n*Boccob, god of magic, arcane knowledge, balance and foresight.<ref name=\"PHB35\">{{cite book |authorlink=Jonathan Tweet|last=Tweet |first=Jonathan |authorlink2=Monte Cook|last2=Cook|first2=Monte |authorlink3=Skip Williams|last3=Williams|first3=Skip |title=Player's Handbook: Core Rulebook I v.3.5 |year=2003 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-2886-7}}</ref>{{rp|32,106}}<ref name=\"Deities\">{{cite book |authorlink=Rich Redman|last=Redman |first=Rich |authorlink2=Skip Williams|last2=Williams|first2=Skip |authorlink3=James Wyatt (game designer)|last3=Wyatt|first3=James |title=[[Deities and Demigods]] |year=2002 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-2654-6}}</ref>{{rp|60}}\n*[[Corellon Larethian]], god of [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|elves]], magic, music, and arts (also a demihuman power).<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,106}}<ref name=\"Deities\" />{{rp|62}}<ref name=\"Wild\">{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Skip |title=Races of the Wild |year=2005 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-3438-7}}</ref>{{rp|20}}\n*Garl Glittergold, god of [[Gnome (Dungeons & Dragons)|gnomes]], humor, and gemcutting (also a demihuman power).<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,107}}<ref name=\"Deities\" />{{rp|69}}<ref name=\"Stone\">{{cite book |authorlink=David Noonan (game designer)|last=Noonan |first=David |authorlink2=Jesse Decker|last2=Decker|first2=Jesse |authorlink3=Michelle Lyons|last3=Lyons|first3=Michelle |title=[[Races of Stone]] |year=2004 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-3278-3}}</ref>{{rp|43}}<ref name=\"CD\">{{cite book |last=Noonan |first=David |title=Complete Divine |year=2004 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-3272-4}}</ref>{{rp|109,112}}\n*[[Gruumsh]], god of orcs (also a monster power).<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,107}}<ref name=\"Deities\" />{{rp|71}}\n*[[Moradin]], god of [[Dwarf (Dungeons & Dragons)|dwarves]] (also a demihuman power)<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,107}}<ref name=\"Deities\" />{{rp|83}}<ref name=\"Stone\" />{{rp|17}}\n*[[Nerull]], god of death, darkness, murder and the underworld.<ref name=\"PHB35\" />{{rp|32,108}}<ref name=\"LibrisMortis\">{{cite book |last=Collins |first=Andy |authorlink=Andy Collins (game designer)|first2=Bruce R.|last2=Cordell|authorlink2=Bruce R.

Being monotheistic, it of course consists of only one deity (though said deity is described as having two aspects; a creator one and a destroyer one):\n\n*Taiia, greater goddess of creation, destruction, mortal life and death.\n\n====Following the Light====\nFollowing the Light is a fictional [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] religion presented in and constructed according to the guidelines given for dualistic religions in 3rd Edition Deities and Demigods. Being dualistic, it consists of two, polar-opposite deities:\n\n*Elishar, intermediate deity of positive energy, light and prophecy.\n*Toldoth, intermediate deity of negative energy, darkness and destruction.\n\n====Dennari====\nThe faith of Dennari is a fictional [[mystery cult]], presented in and constructed according to the guidelines given for mystery cults in 3rd Edition ''[[Deities & Demigods]]''. It worships a single deity of the same name:\n\n*Dennari, lesser goddess of earth, liberation and suffering.\n\n=== Nondeity powers ===\nSimilar to monster powers, these are not true deities but very powerful extraplanar beings. These however do not even profess to be gods (though many still have designs on godhood).\n\n====Fiendish entities====\n===== Demon lords of the Abyss =====\nThe single unifying feature of all [[Demon lord (Dungeons & Dragons)|demon lords]] (also called demon princes) is the inherent control over part of the infinite layers of [[Abyss (plane)|The Abyss]]. Only the first 666 layers of The Abyss are generally known, and of those only a small fraction of the princes of those layers are a part of the D&D cosmology.\n*[[Baphomet (Dungeons & Dragons)|Baphomet, Prince of Beasts]], demon prince of beasts and vengeance (also the monster power of [[Minotaur (Dungeons & Dragons)|minotaurs]])<ref name=\"CodexI\">{{cite book |authorlink=Ed Stark|last=Stark |first=Ed |authorlink2=James Jacobs (game designer)|last2=Jacobs|first2=James |authorlink3=Erik Mona|last3=Mona|first3=Erik |title=[[Fiendish Codex I: Hordes of the Abyss]] |year=2006 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-3919-2}}</ref>{{rp|58}}\n*[[Dagon (Dungeons & Dragons)|Dagon]], demon prince and patron of the deep sea.<ref name=\"CodexI\" />{{rp|59}}\n*[[Demogorgon (Dungeons & Dragons)|Demogorgon]], self-proclaimed \"Prince of Demons\".<ref name=\"CodexI\" />{{rp|61}}\n*[[Eltab]], demon prince of hatred and retribution.\n*[[Fraz-Urb'luu]], demon prince and patron of illusionists and tricksters.<ref name=\"CodexI\" />{{rp|63}}\n*[[Graz'zt]], demon prince and patron of rulers by force.<ref name=\"CodexI\" />{{rp|65}}\n*[[Juiblex]], demon prince and patron of oozes and slimes.<ref name=\"CodexI\" />{{rp|66}}\n*[[Kostchtchie]], demon prince of the 23rd layer of [[Abyss (plane)|The Abyss]], the Ice Wastes; patron of evil frost giants.<ref name=\"Frostburn\">{{cite book |authorlink=Wolfgang Baur|last=Baur |first=Wolfgang |authorlink2=James Jacobs (game designer)|last2=Jacobs|first2=James |authorlink3=George Strayton|last3=Strayton|first3=George |title=Frostburn: Mastering the Perils of Ice and Snow |year=2004 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |isbn=0-7869-2896-4}}</ref>{{rp|8}}<ref name=\"CodexI\" />{{rp|68}}\n*[[Lolth]], demon princess of spiders, evil, darkness, chaos and assassins.

They are to the [[Celestial (Dungeons & Dragons)|celestials]] as the archdevils are to the devils and the demon lords are to demons.\n\n=====Archon paragons=====\nThe celestial paragons of the [[Archon (Dungeons & Dragons)|archons]] are known collectively as the '''Celestial Hebdomad'''. They rule the layers of the [[Plane (Dungeons & Dragons)|Plane]] of [[Mount Celestia]].\n\n;[[Barachiel (Dungeons & Dragons)|Barachiel]]\n: ruler of the Silver Heaven of Lunia, the bottom layer of Celestia.\n;[[Domiel]]\n: ruler of the Golden Heaven of Mercuria, the second layer of Celestia.\n;[[Erathaol]]\n: ruler of Venya, the Pearly Heaven, the third layer of Celestia.\n;[[Pistis Sophia (Dungeons & Dragons)|Pistis Sophia]]\n: ruler of Solania, the Crystal Heaven, the fourth layer of Celestia.\n;[[Raziel (Dungeons & Dragons)|Raziel]]\n: ruler of Mertion, the Platinum Heaven, the fifth layer of Celestia.\n;[[Sealtiel (Dungeons & Dragons)|Sealtiel]]\n: ruler of Jovar, the Glittering Heaven, the sixth layer of Celestia.\n;[[Zaphkiel (Dungeons & Dragons)|Zaphkiel]]\n: ruler of the Illuminated Heaven of Chronias, the seventh layer of Celestia.\n\n=====Eladrin paragons=====\nThe celestial paragons of the [[eladrin]]s are collectively known as '''The Court of Stars'''. They hail from the Plane of [[Arborea (Dungeons & Dragons)|Arborea]].\n\n;[[Faerinaal]]\n: oversees the defense of the Court of Stars and liberates eladrins captured by evil forces.\n;[[Gwynharwyf]]\n: Queen Morwel's loyal champion and a barbarian of unparalleled ferocity.\n;[[Morwel]]\n: the ruler of the eladrins and the Court of Stars.\n\n=====Guardinal paragons=====\nThe celestial paragons of the [[guardinal]]s are collectively known as '''Talisid and the Five Companions'''.

Spends most of his time on Amoria, the topmost layer of Elysium.\n;Vhara\n: the duchess of the Equinals, resides on Amoria.\n\n==== Archomentals ====\n[[Archomental]]s are powerful exemplary beings of the [[Inner Plane|Elemental Planes]] and the rulers of the [[Elemental (Dungeons & Dragons)|elementals]]. Although they are not truly rulers of their planes, archomentals like to consider themselves as much and often grant themselves regal titles like Prince or Princess. They are compared in the source material to the archfiends or celestial paragons, and are considered to be the elemental equivalent of such beings.\n\n===== Evil Archomentals =====\nThe evil archomentals are collectively known as the Princes of Elemental Evil. The five most famous are:\n\n*[[Cryonax]], prince of evil cold creatures.\n*[[Imix (Dungeons & Dragons)|Imix]], prince of evil fire creatures.\n*[[Ogr\u00e9moch]], prince of evil earth creatures.\n*[[Olhydra]], princess of evil water creatures.\n*[[Yan-C-Bin]], prince of evil air creatures.\n\n===== Good Archomentals =====\nThe good archomentals are collectively known as the Elemental Princes of Good.

In ''The Inner Planes'' (TSR, 1998) he is described as evil tyrant.\n*[[Ehkahk]], prince of smoke creatures.\n\n==== Slaad Lords ====\nThe Slaad Lords are the de facto rules of the [[Slaad]]i race and the plane of [[Limbo (Dungeons & Dragons)|Limbo]]. Though true to their chaotic nature they often do not appear anything like other Slaadi.\n\n*[[Chourst]], lord of randomness.\n*[[Rennbuu]], lord of colors.\n*[[Ssendam]], lord of madness.\n*[[Wartle]], domain unknown.\n*[[Ygorl]], lord of entropy.\n\n==== Titans ====\n\"Titans are closer to the well spring of life and thus experience more pronounced emotion including Deity-like fits of rage. In ages past some rebelled against the deities themselves...\"<ref>''Monster Manual'' 3.5 edition</ref>\n\n==== The Lady of Pain ====\nThe Lady of Pain is an enigmatic being who oversees the city of [[Sigil (Dungeons & Dragons)|Sigil]] in the plane of the [[Concordant Domain of the Outlands|Outlands]]. Almost nothing is known about her; her origin, her race, her motives and her level of power are all obscure, although she is sometimes shown to have absolutely immense power. The Lady of Pain refuses to tolerate anyone who worships her, killing those who do so. Again; virtually nothing is known about her, apart from the fact that she has the power to slay gods who displease her.\n\n==== Vestiges ====\nThese entities are outside the boundary of life, death, and undeath. They are untouchable by even the most powerful deities although they can be summoned and used by the weakest mortal through pact magic and binding. Binders are often feared and hunted down by \"Witch Slayers.\" The list of vestiges that can be bonded with include:\n\n*[[Acererak]]: The Eternal.\n*[[Agares]]: Truth Betrayed.\n*[[Aamon|Amon]]: The Void Before The Altar.\n*[[Andras]]: The Grey Knight.\n*[[Andromalius]]: The Repentant Rogue.\n*[[Aim (demon)|Aym]]: Queen Avarice.\n*[[Balam (demon)|Balam]]: The Bitter Angel.\n*[[Buer (demon)|Buer]]: Grandmother Huntress.\n*[[Chupoclops]]: Harbinger of Forever.\n*[[Dahlver-Nar]]: The Tortured One.\n*[[Dantalion]]: The Star Emperor.\n*[[Eligor]]: Dragon's Slayer.\n*[[Eurynome]]: Mother of the Material.\n*[[Focalor]]: Prince of Tears.\n*Geryon: The Deposed Lord.\n*[[Haagenti]]: Mother of Minotaurs.\n*[[Malthus (demon)|Halphax]]: Angel in the Angle.\n*[[Haures]]: The Dreaming Duke.\n*[[Ipos]]: Prince of Fools.\n*[[Karsus]]: Hubris in the Blood.\n*[[Leraje]]: The Green Herald.\n*[[Malphas]]: The Turnfeather.\n*[[Marchosias]]: King of Killers.\n*[[Naberius]]: The Grinning Hound.\n*Orthos: Sovereign of the Howling Dark.\n*[[Otiax]]: The Key to the Gate.\n*[[Paimon]]: The Dancer.\n*[[Ronove]]: The Iron Maiden.\n*[[Savnok]]: The Instigator.\n*Shax: Sea Sister.\n*[[Tenebrous]]: The Shadow That Was.\n*[[Zagan (demon)|Zagan]]: Duke of Disappointment.\n\nVestiges were introduced in D&D: ''[[Tome of Magic]]'' supplement \nby Matthew Sernett, [[Ari Marmell]], [[David Noonan (game designer)|David Noonan]], [[Robert J.

Implied to be the creator of humans, the devils wiped out all knowledge of his name, which they fear is powerful enough to revive him if it is ever spoken aloud again. The Nine Hells were originally his astral domain, now a prison for Asmodeus and his devils. A holy chalice belonging to him is mentioned in ''Divine Power''.\n* Khala \u2013 Goddess of Winter, wife of Zehir, Khala sought to trap the natural world in an eternal winter to secure power over it. Her plans convinced the primal spirits to expel gods and primordials from the world. She was killed by the other gods in a conflict called the War of Winter, who afterwards made a compact to balance darkness and light (Zehir and Pelor), and the natural seasons (Corellon, Pelor and Sehanine). Her power over winter was taken by the [[Raven Queen]].\n*[[Lakal]] \u2013 God of Healing and Mercy who was also her own Astral Dominion. She was an impersonal deity who communicated with her chosen people, the Quom, through \"ecstatic moments of personal communion.\" She extolled mercy and urged her followers to dedicate themselves to pursuits that benefited the whole cosmos. Lakal's death was accidental \u2013 when Bahamut battled Nihil, the Primordial of nothingness, the pair crashed into Lakal. Bahamut was able to use the distraction to slay Nihil, but the primordial's death throes also caused Lakal to explode. The surviving quom now roam the planes, retrieving any shards of Lakal that they can find, including those unknowingly consumed by living creatures. Such creatures, including humanoids and player characters, are considered collateral damage in the quom's quest to restore Lakal. Ironically, even if the quom succeed in their quest, the restored Lakal would be disgusted with their methods.<ref>[[Rob Heinsoo|Heinsoo, Rob]], ''[[The Plane Above]]''.

When she failed to assassinate a high priest of [[Pelor]], she was abandoned and then mortally wounded by a paladin's holy blade. Expecting only death, she was surprised when the high priest healed her, showing her compassion and forgiveness. Intrigued, she decided to honor a promise to the high priest and aid him in his holy quest until a time that she could save his life in turn. Nusemnee thus became a symbol of redemption. When she finally died at the end of the high priest's quest, she rose again, this time as a minor goddess. In this form, she opposed her father by offering redemption to all who would turn away from evil. She was later killed by a poison that could kill anything\u2014even a deity\u2014that was distilled from Zehir's blood.<ref name=\"Dragon390\">{{cite book |author=Pierre Van Rooden |magazine=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]] 390 |title=Power Play: Divine - Dead Gods |year=August 2010 |page=47 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast}}</ref>\n\n== Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition ==\nThese are the deities for the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons.

From an anarchist perspective, however, both positions\u2014the minimal state (minarchist) and the no-state ('anarchist') positions\u2014neglect the problem of economic domination; in other words, they neglect the hierarchies, oppressions, and forms of exploitation that would inevitably arise in a ''laissez-faire'' 'free' market. [...] Anarchism, therefore, has no truck with this right-wing libertarianism, not only because it neglects economic inequality and domination, but also because in practice (and theory) it is highly inconsistent and contradictory.

Right-wing libertarians argue that the right of self-ownership entails the right to appropriate unequal parts of the external world, such as unequal amounts of land. According to left-libertarians, however, the world's natural resources were initially unowned, or belonged equally to all, and it is illegitimate for anyone to claim exclusive private ownership of these resources to the detriment of others. Such private appropriation is legitimate only if everyone can appropriate an equal amount, or if those who appropriate more are taxed to compensate those who are thereby excluded from what was once common property.

Somewhere in between these two poles lies the contemporary situation of most citizens of Western democracies: a relatively open public sphere but a quotidian institutional experience that is largely at cross purposes with the implicit assumptions behind this public sphere and encouraging and often rewarding caution, deference, servility, and conformity\".</ref> and [[Thomas Paine]]\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Long|first=Roderick T.|year=1998|title=Toward a Libertarian Theory of Class|journal=Social Philosophy and Policy|volume=15|issue=2|page=310|doi=10.1017/s0265052500002028}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Thomas Paine rev1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Thomas Paine]]'s theory of property showed a [[Left-libertarianism|libertarian concern with the redistribution of resources]]]]\nJohn Locke greatly influenced both libertarianism and the modern world in his writings published before and after the [[Glorious Revolution|English Revolution of 1688]], especially ''[[A Letter Concerning Toleration]]'' (1667), ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' (1689) and ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690).

It combines the libertarian assumption that each person possesses a natural right of self-ownership over his person with the egalitarian premise that natural resources should be shared equally. Right-wing libertarians argue that the right of self-ownership entails the right to appropriate unequal parts of the external world, such as unequal amounts of land. However, according to left-libertarians the world's natural resources were initially unowned, or belonged equally to all, and it is illegitimate for anyone to claim exclusive private ownership of these resources to the detriment of others. Such private appropriation is legitimate only if everyone can appropriate an equal amount, or if those who appropriate more are taxed to compensate those who are thereby excluded from what was once common property.

Strongly opposed to [[feudalism]] and the [[Land tenure|privatisation of land]], George created the philosophy of [[Georgism]], or [[geoism]], influential among many left-libertarians, including [[Geolibertarianism|geolibertarians]] and [[geoanarchists]]. Much like the English [[The Diggers|Digger movement]], [[Communism|who held all material possessions in common]], George claimed that land and its financial properties belong to everyone, and that to hold land as [[private property]] would lead to immense inequalities, including authority from the private owners of such ground.\n\nPrior to [[State (polity)|states]] assigning property owners slices of either once populated or uninhabited land, the world's earth was held in common. When all resources that derive from land are put to achieving a higher quality of life, not just for [[Ruling class|employers or landlords]], but to serve the general interests and comforts of a wider community, Geolibertarians claim vastly higher qualities of life can be reached, especially with ever advancing technology and industrialised agriculture.\n\n[[File:Levellers declaration and standard.gif|thumb|The [[Diggers]], early [[Anarcho-communism|anarcho-communists]], [[Common property|held all things in common]], including [[Enclosure|land which was often violently seized]] by the European [[aristocracy]]]]\nThe [[Levellers]], also known as the [[Diggers]], were a 17th-century [[anti-authoritarian]] movement that stood in resistance to the English government and the [[feudalism]] it was pushing through the forced privatisation of land around the time of the [[First English Civil War]]. Devout [[Protestantism|Protestants]], [[Gerrard Winstanley]] was a prominent member of the community and with a [[Christian communism|very progressive interpretation of his religion]] sought to end buying and selling, instead for all inhabitants of a society to share their material possessions and to hold all things in common, without money or payment. With the complete abolition of private property, including that of private land, the English Levellers created a pool of property where all properties belonged in equal measure to everyone. Often seen as some of the first practising anarchists, the Digger movement is considered extremely early [[libertarian communism]].\n\n=== Modern libertarianism in the United States ===\n{{main|Libertarianism in the United States}}\nBy around the start of the 20th century, the heyday of individualist anarchism had passed.<ref>[[Paul Avrich|Avrich, Paul]] (1995) [2006].

He also argued that \"ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears\" is an \"absurdity\".<ref name=\"Landauer\"/> In response, ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'' states the following: \"Anarchy is not a utopia, [and] anarchists make no such claims about human perfection. [...] Remaining disputes would be solved by reasonable methods, for example, the use of juries, mutual third parties, or community and workplace assemblies\". It also states that \"some sort of 'court' system would still be necessary to deal with the remaining crimes and to adjudicate disputes between citizens\".<ref>Anarchist FAQ Editorial Collective (2017).

From an anarchist perspective, however, both positions\u2014the minimal state (minarchist) and the no-state ('anarchist') positions\u2014neglect the problem of economic domination; in other words, they neglect the hierarchies, oppressions, and forms of exploitation that would inevitably arise in a ''laissez-faire'' 'free' market.

Right-wing libertarians argue that the right of self-ownership entails the right to appropriate unequal parts of the external world, such as unequal amounts of land. According to left-libertarians, however, the world's natural resources were initially unowned, or belonged equally to all, and it is illegitimate for anyone to claim exclusive private ownership of these resources to the detriment of others. Such private appropriation is legitimate only if everyone can appropriate an equal amount, or if those who appropriate more are taxed to compensate those who are thereby excluded from what was once common property.

It combines the libertarian assumption that each person possesses a natural right of self-ownership over his person with the egalitarian premise that natural resources should be shared equally. Right-wing libertarians argue that the right of self-ownership entails the right to appropriate unequal parts of the external world, such as unequal amounts of land. However, according to left-libertarians the world's natural resources were initially unowned, or belonged equally to all, and it is illegitimate for anyone to claim exclusive private ownership of these resources to the detriment of others. Such private appropriation is legitimate only if everyone can appropriate an equal amount, or if those who appropriate more are taxed to compensate those who are thereby excluded from what was once common property.

Strongly opposed to [[feudalism]] and the [[Land tenure|privatisation of land]], George created the philosophy of [[Georgism]], or [[geoism]], influential among many left-libertarians, including [[Geolibertarianism|geolibertarians]] and [[geoanarchists]]. Much like the English [[The Diggers|Digger movement]], [[Communism|who held all material possessions in common]], George claimed that land and its financial properties belong to everyone, and that to hold land as [[private property]] would lead to immense inequalities, including authority from the private owners of such ground.\n\nPrior to [[State (polity)|states]] assigning property owners slices of either once populated or uninhabited land, the world's earth was held in common. When all resources that derive from land are put to achieving a higher quality of life, not just for [[Ruling class|employers or landlords]], but to serve the general interests and comforts of a wider community, Geolibertarians claim vastly higher qualities of life can be reached, especially with ever advancing technology and industrialised agriculture.\n\n[[File:Levellers declaration and standard.gif|thumb|The [[Diggers]], early [[Anarcho-communism|anarcho-communists]], [[Common property|held all things in common]], including [[Enclosure|land which was often violently seized]] by the European [[aristocracy]]]]\nThe [[Levellers]], also known as the [[Diggers]], were a 17th-century [[anti-authoritarian]] movement that stood in resistance to the English government and the [[feudalism]] it was pushing through the forced privatisation of land around the time of the [[First English Civil War]].

With the complete abolition of private property, including that of private land, the English Levellers created a pool of property where all properties belonged in equal measure to everyone.

He also argued that \"ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears\" is an \"absurdity\".<ref name=\"Landauer\"/> In response, ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'' states the following: \"Anarchy is not a utopia, [and] anarchists make no such claims about human perfection. [...] Remaining disputes would be solved by reasonable methods, for example, the use of juries, mutual third parties, or community and workplace assemblies\". It also states that \"some sort of 'court' system would still be necessary to deal with the remaining crimes and to adjudicate disputes between citizens\".<ref>Anarchist FAQ Editorial Collective (2017).

From Heidelberg, Universit\u00e4tsbiblothek, Cpg 365, folios 1v and 2r.]]\n'''Wolfdietrich''' is the eponymous protagonist of the [[Middle High German]] [[heroic epic]] ''Wolfdietrich''. First written down in [[strophe|strophic form]] in around 1230 by an anonymous author, it survives in four main versions, widely differing in scope and content, and largely independent of each other.\n\n''Wolfdietrich'' is closely associated with another heroic epic poem of the same period, ''[[Ortnit]]''. The two stories have distinct (if disputed) origins but they were combined at an early stage, possibly by a single author, and appear together in most sources. In the earliest surviving version of the first story, Ortnit is killed by two dragons sent by his father-in-law after he abducts and marries his daughter; in the second, Wolfdietrich, deprived of his inheritance by two brothers and an evil counsellor, sets out to seek Ortnit's help but, finding he has been killed, avenges him by killing the dragons, he then defeats his brothers and the counsellor, and marries Ortnit's widow.\n\nWhile the earliest version is similar to other heroic epics such as the Nibelungenlied, the tale gradually accretes more episodes, becoming a popular adventure story.\n\nWith their motifs of the bride-quest, inheritance regained, faithful and faithless vassals, dragon-killing, magic suits of armour, and encounters with dwarves, witches and giants, this pair of stories remained continuously popular, repeatedly re-cast, copied and, later, printed until the early 17th century. This makes it one of the most long-lived and popular German narratives of the medieval and early modern period.\n\nThough ''Wolfdietrich'' and ''Ortnit'' do not seem originally to have been among the legends surrounding [[Theodoric the Great]], the [[Legends about Theoderic the Great|Dietrich of Bern]] cycle, Wolfdietrich became identified as the grandfather of Dietrich and material from the two stories found its way into a number of Dietrich tales, including the [[Old Norse]] [[\u00dei\u00f0reks saga|Thidreksaga]].\n\n==Versions==\n[[File:Ambraser Heldenbuch folio 205v.jpg|thumb|The start of ''Wolfdietrich A'', folio 220<sup>v</sup> of the [[Ambraser Heldenbuch]]]]\nThe story survives in four versions. Three of these (A,B,C) are largely independent of each other, and each gives Wolfdietrich a different birthplace. The fourth, D, is a compilation of material from versions B and C.{{sfn|Brinker-von der Heyde|2000|p=197}}\n\n'''Wolfdietrich A''' (\"Wolfdietrich of Constantinople\") is the oldest version, written around 1230, though only surviving in a much later manuscript, the [[Ambraser Heldenbuch]] (MS A). The first 505 strophes (A1) are probably written by the same author as the version of Ortnit which precedes it in the manuscript, but the remaining 101 strophes (A2) show a more condensed narration by a continuator using material from the tradition of Wolfdietrich B. {{sfn|Dinkelacker|1989|loc=col. 1312}} The end of the story is missing in the Ambraser Heldenbuch (it ends as Wolfdieterich's sword breaks in his fight against the dragon), but can be reconstructed from the Dresden Heldenbuch of 1472, which draws on the same source as MS A.{{sfn|de Boor|1974|p=206}}\n\n'''Wolfdietrich B''' (\"Wolfdietrich of Saloniki\") greatly expands the story of Wolfdietrich's youth.\n\n'''Wolfdietrich C''' (\"Wolfdietrich of Athens\") survives only in five widely spread fragments, one of which is now missing.\n\n'''Wolfdietrich D''' is the most extensive version (hence \"The Large Wolfdietrich\") and combines material from versions B and C as well as a further, unknown version related to B.{{sfn|Schneider|1931|p=VI}} With 10 manuscripts and six printed editions it is \"one of the great literary successes of the late Middle Ages\".{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=42}}\n\n==The story==\n===Ortnit A===\nKing Ortnit of Lambarten ([[Lombardy]]) abducts Liebgarte, the daughter of King Machorel. Under the guise of an attempt at reconciliation, Machorel sends Ortnit two dragon eggs, and the dragons terrorise the kingdom after they hatch. After a year Ortnit sets out to defeat the dragons, but is caught asleep and killed by them. His widow is forced into seclusion, to await the birth of Ortnit's avenger.\n\n===Wolfdietrich A===\nWolfdietrich is born as third son to Hugdietrich, King of [[Greece]]. The king's evil counsellor Sabene persuades him that the child is the spawn of the devil, and Duke Berchtung of Meran is ordered to kill him. But Berchtung saves the child and brings about the banishment of Sabene.\n\nAfter Hugdietrich's death, Sabene returns to [[Constantinople]] and persuades the two elder brothers to banish the queen and deprive Wolfdietrich, now living in Berchtung's castle Lilienport, of his inheritance. Wolfdietrich leads a military campaign against his brothers but it fails and he is besieged in Lilienport. After four years he breaks out and makes his way to seek help from King Ortnit.\n\nHe eventually makes his way to Garte, where he finds Ortnit's widow lamenting her husband's death. He defeats the dragons, marries Liebgart, and becomes King of Lambarten.\n\nDisguised as a pilgrim, Wolfdietrich reconnoitres Constantinople, where Berchtung's sons are being held captive by his brothers. After recovering his wife, who had been abducted in the meantime, he sails to Greece, where after a successful siege of his brothers he has Sabene executed and rewards his faithful vassals. He then returns to Lambarten.{{sfn|Kofler|2009|pages=362\u2013363}}\n\n==Origins==\nVarious theories have attempted to connect Wolfdietrich (and his father Hugdietrich) with historical persons from the Germanic [[Migration Period]]:{{sfn|Dinkelacker|1989|p=1319}}\n*The Ostrogothic theory equates Wolfdietrich with Dietrich von Bern. This is supported by the name Dietrich (Wolfdietrich is a nickname for the child baptized Dietrich), by the Italian and Near East geography, and by the exile and reconquest story.{{sfn|Dinkelacker|1989|p=1319}} However, given the prominence of the other Dietrich stories, this seems unlikely.{{sfn|Lienert|p2015|p=155}}{{sfn|Brinker-von der Heyde|2000|p=200}}\n*The Frankish theories identify Wolfdetrich with various [[Merovingian]] rulers, [[Theudebert]], [[Theuderich]] or [[Gundoald]]. Support for this lies in the motif of the conflict between the brothers over the inheritance, and the name Hugdietrich is Frankish.{{sfn|Brinker-von der Heyde|2000|p=199}} The closest parallels are with [[Chlodwig I]] (=Hugdietrich) and his son Theuderich (=Wolfdietrich): the accusation of bastardy, fraternal conflict and a mixed marriage.{{sfn|Brinker-von der Heyde|2000|p=199}}\nHowever, there is no consensus on these theories,{{sfn|Linert|p2015|p=155}} and it can be argued that the many anti-historical elements essential to the story (rescue by wolves, magic armour, giants, dragons) suggest it combines a variety of legendary and fantastic sources divorced from any specific historical personalities.{{sfn|Dinkelacker|1989|p=1320}} In this view ''Wolfdietrich'' is essentially a montage, which draws on not only the heroic epic, but also the [[chanson de geste]], [[crusade]] literature, the bride-quest story, and other sources, with what Miklautsch calls a \"hybrid hero\".{{sfn|Lienert|p2015|p=155}}{{sfn|Dinkelacker|1989|p=1320}}{{sfn|Miklautsch|2005}}\n\n==Form and structure==\n''Wolfdietrich'' and ''Ortnit'' are written in a strophic form called the ''Hildebrandston'' (similar to the Nibelungenstrophe used in the [[Nibelungenlied]] and [[Kudrun]]). It consists of four long-lines: each long-line has three [[Foot (prosody)|feet]] with a [[Masculine and feminine endings|feminine ending]], a [[caesura]], then three feet with a rhymed [[Masculine rhyme|masculine ending]].{{sfn|Kofler|2009b|p=14}}\n{{Verse translation|\n'''Wolfdietrich A'''{{sfn|Kofler|2009a|p=107}}\n1.

First written down in [[strophe|strophic form]] in around 1230 by an anonymous author, it survives in four main versions, widely differing in scope and content, and largely independent of each other.\n\n''Wolfdietrich'' is closely associated with another heroic epic poem of the same period, ''[[Ortnit]]''. The two stories have distinct (if disputed) origins but they were combined at an early stage, possibly by a single author, and appear together in most sources. In the earliest surviving version of the first story, Ortnit is killed by two dragons sent by his father-in-law after he abducts and marries his daughter; in the second, Wolfdietrich, deprived of his inheritance by two brothers and an evil counsellor, sets out to seek Ortnit's help but, finding he has been killed, avenges him by killing the dragons, he then defeats his brothers and the counsellor, and marries Ortnit's widow.\n\nWhile the earliest version is similar to other heroic epics such as the Nibelungenlied, the tale gradually accretes more episodes, becoming a popular adventure story.\n\nWith their motifs of the bride-quest, inheritance regained, faithful and faithless vassals, dragon-killing, magic suits of armour, and encounters with dwarves, witches and giants, this pair of stories remained continuously popular, repeatedly re-cast, copied and, later, printed until the early 17th century. This makes it one of the most long-lived and popular German narratives of the medieval and early modern period.\n\nThough ''Wolfdietrich'' and ''Ortnit'' do not seem originally to have been among the legends surrounding [[Theodoric the Great]], the [[Legends about Theoderic the Great|Dietrich of Bern]] cycle, Wolfdietrich became identified as the grandfather of Dietrich and material from the two stories found its way into a number of Dietrich tales, including the [[Old Norse]] [[\u00dei\u00f0reks saga|Thidreksaga]].\n\n==Versions==\n[[File:Ambraser Heldenbuch folio 205v.jpg|thumb|The start of ''Wolfdietrich A'', folio 220<sup>v</sup> of the [[Ambraser Heldenbuch]]]]\nThe story survives in four versions. Three of these (A,B,C) are largely independent of each other, and each gives Wolfdietrich a different birthplace. The fourth, D, is a compilation of material from versions B and C.{{sfn|Brinker-von der Heyde|2000|p=197}}\n\n'''Wolfdietrich A''' (\"Wolfdietrich of Constantinople\") is the oldest version, written around 1230, though only surviving in a much later manuscript, the [[Ambraser Heldenbuch]] (MS A). The first 505 strophes (A1) are probably written by the same author as the version of Ortnit which precedes it in the manuscript, but the remaining 101 strophes (A2) show a more condensed narration by a continuator using material from the tradition of Wolfdietrich B. {{sfn|Dinkelacker|1989|loc=col. 1312}} The end of the story is missing in the Ambraser Heldenbuch (it ends as Wolfdieterich's sword breaks in his fight against the dragon), but can be can be reconstructed from the Dresden Heldenbuch of 1472, which draws on the same source as MS A.{{sfn|de Boor|1974|p=206}}\n\n'''Wolfdietrich B''' (\"Wolfdietrich of Saloniki\") greatly expands the story of Wolfdietrich's youth.\n\n'''Wolfdietrich C''' (\"Wolfdietrich of Athens\") survives only in five widely spread fragments, one of which is now missing.\n\n'''Wolfdietrich D''' is the most extensive version (hence \"The Large Wolfdietrich\") and combines material from versions B and C as well as a further, unknown version related to B.{{sfn|Schneider|1931|p=VI}} With 10 manuscripts and six printed editions it is \"one of the great literary successes of the late Middle Ages\".{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=42}}\n\n==The story==\n===Ortnit A===\nKing Ortnit of Lambarten ([[Lombardy]]) abducts Liebgarte, the daughter of King Machorel. Under the guise of an attempt at reconciliation, Machorel sends Ortnit two dragon eggs, and the dragons terrorise the kingdom after they hatch. After a year Ortnit sets out to defeat the dragons, but is caught asleep and killed by them. His widow is forced into seclusion, to await the birth of Ortnit's avenger.\n\n===Wolfdietrich A===\nWolfdietrich is born as third son to Hugdietrich, King of [[Greece]]. The king's evil counsellor Sabene persuades him that the child is the spawn of the devil, and Duke Berchtung of Meran is ordered to kill him. But Berchtung saves the child and brings about the banishment of Sabene.\n\nAfter Hugdietrich's death, Sabene returns to [[Constantinople]] and persuades the two elder brothers to banish the queen and deprive Wolfdietrich, now living in Berchtung's castle Lilienport, of his inheritance. Wolfdietrich leads a military campaign against his brothers but it fails and he is besieged in Lilienport. After four years he breaks out and makes his way to seek help from King Ortnit.\n\nHe eventually makes his way to Garte, where he finds Ortnit's widow lamenting her husband's death. He defeats the dragons, marries Liebgart, and becomes King of Lambarten.\n\nDisguised as a pilgrim, Wolfdietrich reconnoitres Constantinople, where Berchtung's sons are being held captive by his brothers. After recovering his wife, who had been abducted in the meantime, he sails to Greece, where after a successful siege of his brothers he has Sabene executed and rewards his faithful vassals. He then returns to Lambarten.{{sfn|Kofler|2009|pages=362\u2013363}}\n\n==Origins==\nVarious theories have attempted to connect Wolfdietrich (and his father Hugdietrich) with historical persons from the Germanic [[Migration Period]]:{{sfn|Dinkelacker|1989|p=1319}}\n*The Ostrogothic theory equates Wolfdietrich with Dietrich von Bern. This is supported by the name Dietrich (Wolfdietrich is a nickname for the child baptized Dietrich), by the Italian and Near East geography, and by the exile and reconquest story.{{sfn|Dinkelacker|1989|p=1319}} However, given the prominence of the other Dietrich stories, this seems unlikely.{{sfn|Lienert|p2015|p=155}}{{sfn|Brinker-von der Heyde|2000|p=200}}\n*The Frankish theories identify Wolfdetrich with various [[Merovingian]] rulers, [[Theudebert]], [[Theuderich]] or [[Gundoald]]. Support for this lies in the motif of the conflict between the brothers over the inheritance, and the name Hugdietrich is Frankish.{{sfn|Brinker-von der Heyde|2000|p=199}} The closest parallels are with [[Chlodwig I]] (=Hugdietrich) and his son Theuderich (=Wolfdietrich): the accusation of bastardy, fraternal conflict and a mixed marriage.{{sfn|Brinker-von der Heyde|2000|p=199}}\nHowever, there is no consensus on these theories,{{sfn|Linert|p2015|p=155}} and it can be argued that the many anti-historical elements essential to the story (rescue by wolves, magic armour, giants, dragons) suggest it combines a variety of legendary and fantastic sources divorced from any specific historical personalities.{{sfn|Dinkelacker|1989|p=1320}} In this view ''Wolfdietrich'' is essentially a montage, which draws on not only the heroic epic, but also the [[chanson de geste]], [[crusade]] literature, the bride-quest story, and other sources, with what Miklautsch calls a \"hybrid hero\".{{sfn|Lienert|p2015|p=155}}{{sfn|Dinkelacker|1989|p=1320}}{{sfn|Miklautsch|2005}}\n\n==Form and structure==\n''Wolfdietrich'' and ''Ortnit'' are written in a strophic form called the ''Hildebrandston'' (similar to the Nibelungenstrophe used in the [[Nibelungenlied]] and [[Kudrun]]). It consists of four long-lines: each long-line has three [[Foot (prosody)|feet]] with a [[Masculine and feminine endings|feminine ending]], a [[caesura]], then three feet with a rhymed [[Masculine rhyme|masculine ending]].{{sfn|Kofler|2009b|p=14}}\n{{Verse translation|\n'''Wolfdietrich A'''{{sfn|Kofler|2009a|p=107}}\n1.
