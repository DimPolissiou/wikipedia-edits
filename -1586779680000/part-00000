[[James VI and I|James VI of Scotland]] had inherited the English and Irish thrones in 1603 as James I, thereby [[Union of the Crowns|uniting the crowns]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] in a [[personal union]], although the three kingdoms remained separate states. On 12 April 1606, a new flag to represent this regal union between England and Scotland was specified in a royal decree, according to which the [[flag of England]], a red cross on a white background, known as ''[[St George's Cross]]'', and the [[flag of Scotland]], a white [[saltire]] on a blue background known as the ''Saltire'' or ''St Andrew's Cross'', would be joined together, forming the flag of England and Scotland for maritime purposes.\n\nThe present design of the Union Flag dates from a Royal proclamation following the [[Act of Union 1800|union]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] in 1801.<ref name=\"flaginst\">{{cite web |url=http://www.flaginstitute.org/index.php?location=7 |title=British flags |first=Graham |last=Bartram |website=The Flag Institute |accessdate=2007-05-02}}</ref> The flag combines aspects of three older national flags: the red cross of [[St George]] for the Kingdom of England, the white saltire of [[St Andrew]] for [[Scotland]] and the [[Saint Patrick's Saltire|red saltire]] of [[St Patrick]] to represent [[Ireland]].\n\nNotably, the [[Home Nations|home country]] of [[symbols of Wales|Wales is not represented separately]] in the Union Flag, as the flag was designed after the [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I of England|invasion of Wales in 1282]]. Hence Wales as a home country has no representation on the flag.

The term ''Union Jack'' possibly dates from Queen Anne's time (r. 1702\u201314), but its origin is uncertain. It may come from the 'jack-et' of the English or Scottish soldiers, or from the name of James I who originated the first union in 1603. Even if the term \"Union Jack\" does derive from the jack flag, after three centuries, it is now sanctioned by use and has appeared in official use, confirmed as the national flag by Parliament and remains the popular term.<ref name=Flagsofworld>{{FOTW|id=gb|title=United Kingdom|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref>\n\nWinston Churchill was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 and he referred to the flag of the United Kingdom as the Union Jack.

In this interpretation, the width of both saltires is  {{frac|1|15}} of the flag's height, with fimbriations of  {{frac|1|30}} of the flag's height on either side of the red saltire.\n\nThe crosses and fimbriations retain their thickness relative to the flag's ''height'' whether they are shown with a ratio of 3:5 or 1:2.\n\nThe Admiralty in 1864 settled all official flags at proportions of 1:2, but the relative widths of the crosses remained unspecified, with the above conventions becoming standardised in the 20th century.<ref>by the 1970s,<!--this article is unaware  *when* this became standard, could be any time between 1801 and 1973.--> \"its current official dimension of l/30th the width of the flag\" ''The Flag Bulletin'', Volumes 12-14, Flag Research Center (1973), p. 85.</ref> In the 19th century, the Union flag was defined by the same blazon but could vary in its geometrical proportions.<ref>[https://www.justcollecting.com/miscellania/the-worlds-most-expensive-union-jack-sells-for-384k The World\u2019s Most Expensive Union Jack Sells For \u00a3384K]</ref>\n\n===Colours===\nThe colour specifications for the colours Union Jack (royal) blue, Union Flag red and white are:<ref name=Flagsofworld />\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Thus, there is a right side up.  The original specification of the Union Flag in the Royal Proclamation of 1 January 1801 did not contain a drawn pattern or express which way the saltires should lie; they were simply \"counterchanged\" and the red saltire fimbriated. Nevertheless, a convention was soon established which accords most closely with the description.\n\nWhen statically displayed, the hoist is on the observer's left. To fly the flag correctly, the white of St Andrew is ''above'' the red of St Patrick in the upper hoist canton (the quarter at the top nearest to the flag-pole). This is expressed by the phrases ''wide white top'' and ''broadside up''.\n\nThe first drawn pattern for the flag was in a parallel proclamation on 1 January 1801, concerning civil naval ensigns, which drawing shows the [[red ensign]] (also to be used as a red jack by [[privateer]]s).  As it appears in the ''[[London Gazette]]'', the broad stripe is where expected for three of the four quarters, but the upper left quarter shows the broad stripe below.<ref name=\"London Gazette 1801-01-03\" />\n\nIt is often stated that a flag upside down is a form of distress signal or even a deliberate insult. In the case of the Union Flag, the difference is subtle and is easily missed by the uninformed.

The ground of the current Union Flag is a deep \"[[navy blue|navy]]\" blue ([[Pantone]] 280), which can be traced to the colour used for the [[Blue Ensign]] of the [[Royal Navy]]'s historic \"Blue Squadron\". (Dark shades of colour were used on [[maritime flags]] on the basis of durability.) In 2003 a committee of the [[Scottish Parliament]] recommended that the flag of Scotland use a lighter \"[[royal blue|royal]]\" blue, (Pantone 300). (The Office of the [[Lord Lyon]] does not detail specific shades of colour for use in heraldry.)\n\nA thin white stripe, or [[fimbriation]], separates the red cross from the blue field, in accordance with heraldry's [[rule of tincture]] where colours (like red and blue) must be separated from each other by metals (like white, i.e. ''[[argent]]'' or silver).

A compromise was reached in which both flags were flown on official buildings.  The Union Nationality and Flags Act 1927 provided that the flags of the Union were (a) the Union Jack, to denote the association with the other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and (b) the new [[Flag of South Africa (1928-1994)|National Flag]].

Nations and colonies that have used the Union Flag at some stage have included [[Aden]], [[Basutoland]] (now Lesotho), [[Barbados]], [[Borneo]], [[Canada]], [[Ceylon]] (now Sri Lanka), [[Cyprus]], [[Dominica]], [[British East Africa|British East Africa (Kenya Colony)]], [[Gambia]], [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast (Ghana)]], [[Grenada]], [[British Guiana|Guiana]], [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Jamaica]], [[Labuan|Labuan (Malaysia)]], [[Lagos]], [[Malta]], [[Mauritius]], [[Nigeria]], [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], [[Penang|Penang (Malaysia)]], [[Rhodesia]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Singapore]], [[Somaliland]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]], [[British Raj|Pre-partitioned India]] (present-day [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Myanmar]]), [[Tanganyika]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Uganda]], the [[United States]], and [[Weihaiwei under British rule|Weihaiwei]]. As former British Empire nations were granted independence, these and other versions of the Union Flag were decommissioned. The most recent decommissioning of the Union Flag came on 1 July 1997, when the former [[History of Colonial Hong Kong (1800s\u20131930s)|Dependent Territory of Hong Kong]] was handed over to the People's Republic of China.\n\nAll administrative regions and territories of the United Kingdom fly the Union Jack in some form, with the exception of [[Flag of Gibraltar|Gibraltar]] (other than the government ensign). The [[Crown Dependencies]] are legally not part of the United Kingdom, and the Union Jack is not an official flag there. Outside the UK, the Union Jack is usually part of a special [[ensign]] in which it is placed in the upper left hand corner of a blue field, with a signifying crest in the bottom right.\n\n[[File:Arthur Mees Flags of A Free Empire 1910 Cornell CUL PJM 1167 01.jpg|thumb|Map of the [[British Empire]] (as of 1910)]]\nFour former British colonies in Oceania which are now independent countries incorporate the Union Jack as part of their national flags: Australia, New Zealand and [[Tuvalu]], which have retained the monarchy; and [[Fiji]], which [[1987 Fijian coups d'\u00e9tat|abolished the monarchy in 1987]].\n\nIn former British colonies, the Union Jack was used interchangeably with informal flags of the territory for significant parts of their colonial early history. The Union Flag was used as the flag of Canada until it was re-adopted as a ceremonial flag, and the Maple Leaf flag made the official national flag in 1965. In addition to being an official ceremonial flag, the Union Flag also defaces the flags of a number of Canadian provinces, including [[British Columbia]], [[Manitoba]], and [[Ontario]]. [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] uses a flag that was derived from the Union Flag, with the Union Jack serving as the flag of Newfoundland until 1980. The Union Flag, and flags defaced with the Union Flag in its canton, like the Canadian Red Ensign, continue to see use in Canada in a private capacity. The pre-1801 Union Flag also sees limited use by private organizations, most notably the [[United Empire Loyalists]] Association of Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uelac.org/Loyalist-Monuments/Loyalist-Flag.php|title=History of the Loyalist Flag|publisher=United Empire Loyalists Association of Canada|accessdate=18 March 2020|website=www.uelac.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190923234311/http://www.uelac.org/Loyalist-Monuments/Loyalist-Flag.php|archive-date=23 September 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAlong with the national flag, many other [[List of Australian flags|Australian]] flags retain the use of the Union Jack, including the [[Royal Australian Navy Ensign]] (also known as the Australian White Ensign), the [[Royal Australian Air Force Ensign]], the [[Australian Red Ensign]] (for use by merchant and private vessels), and the [[Australian Civil Aviation Ensign]]. The flags of all six Australian States retain the Union Jack in the canton, as do some regional flags such as the Upper and Lower [[Murray River Flag]]s. The Vice-Regal flags of the State Governors also use the Union Jack. While the [[Flags Act 1953]] states that Australians still have the \"right or privilege\" to fly the Union Jack after the introduction of the Australian National Flag, usage of the Union Jack by itself is unusual.\n\nThe [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country's]] flag, the [[Ikurri\u00f1a]], is also loosely based on the Union Jack, reflecting the significant commercial ties between [[Bilbao]] and Britain at the time the [[Ikurri\u00f1a]] was designed in 1894. The [[Miskito people|Miskito]] people sometimes use a similar flag that also incorporates the Union Jack in its canton, due to long periods of contact in the [[Mosquito Coast]].\n\n[[File:Flag of Hawaii.svg|thumb|right|alt=Thin red white and blue horizontal stripes with Union Flag as top-left quarter.|''Ka Hae Hawai{{okina}}i'', or the [[flag of Hawaii]]]]\nThe Union Jack was used by the United States in its first flag, the [[Grand Union Flag]]. This flag was of a similar design to the one used by the [[British East India Company]]. Hawaii, a state of the United States but located in the central Pacific, incorporates the Union Jack in its [[Flag of Hawaii|state flag]]. According to one story, the King of Hawaii asked the British mariner, [[George Vancouver]], during a stop in Lahaina, what the piece of cloth flying from his ship was. Vancouver replied that it represented his king's authority. The Hawaiian king then adopted and flew the flag as a symbol of his own royal authority not recognising its national derivation. Hawaii's flag represents the only current use of the Union Jack in any American state flag.\n\nAlso in the United States, the Union Flag of 1606 is incorporated into the [[flag of Baton Rouge]], the capital city of Louisiana. Baton Rouge was a British colony from the time of the [[Seven Years' War]] until the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], when it was captured by Spanish forces. Symbols from the colonial powers France and Spain are also incorporated into the Baton Rouge flag. [[Taunton, Massachusetts]], used a [[Flag of Taunton, Massachusetts|flag]] with the old style Union Flag by a resolution on October 19, 1974.  Likewise, [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania]], has been known to fly a flag containing the King's Colours since 1973.<ref>{{FOTW|id=us-pa-wc|title=Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania (U.S.)}}</ref>\n\nThe Union Jack also appeared on both the 1910\u20131928 and 1928\u20131994 [[South African Flag#History|flags]] of South Africa. The [[South Africa Red Ensign|1910\u20131928 flag]] was a [[red ensign]] with the [[Coat of arms of South Africa (1910\u20132000)|Union coat of arms]] in the fly. The 1928\u20131994 flag, based on the [[Prinsenvlag]] and commonly known as the ''oranje-blanje-blou'' (orange-white-blue), contained the Union Jack as part of a central motif at par with the flags of the two [[Boer republics]] of the [[Orange Free State]] and [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]. To keep any one of the three flags from having precedence, the Union Jack is spread horizontally from the Orange Free State flag towards the hoist; closest to the hoist, it is in the superior position but since it is reversed it does not precede the other flags.\n\nThe flag of the Municipal Council of [[Shanghai International Settlement]] in 1869 contained multiple flags to symbolize the countries have participated in the creation and management of this enclave in the Chinese city of Shanghai. The Union Jack was contained as part of top left hand shield close to the flags of the United States and [[Second French Empire|France]], there was also contained the [[flag of Prussia]], but it was removed around 1917.\n\nThe flag of the [[Chile]]an city of [[Coquimbo]] features the Union Jack, owing to its historical commercial links to Britain.\n\n<!-- this gallery is for examples (not an exhaustive list) of current usages of the Union Jack at country, province/state or city level -->\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100\n|Flag of New Zealand.svg|The [[flag of New Zealand]]\n|Flag of Tuvalu.svg|The [[flag of Tuvalu]]\n|Flag of the Cook Islands.svg|The [[flag of the Cook Islands]]\n|Flag of Fiji.svg|The [[flag of Fiji]]\n|Flag of Queensland.svg|The [[Queensland]] State flag\n|Flag of British Columbia.svg|The [[flag of British Columbia|flag of the Province of British Columbia]], [[Canada]]\n|Flag of Ontario.svg|The flag of the [[Ontario|Province of Ontario]], Canada\n|Flag_of_Manitoba.svg|The [[Flag of Manitoba|flag]] of the Province of [[Manitoba]], Canada\n|Flag of Newfoundland_and_Labrador.svg|The [[Flag of Newfoundland and Labrador|flag]] of the Province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], Canada\n|Flag of the British Indian Ocean Territory.svg|The [[flag of the British Indian Ocean Territory]]\n|Flag of Bermuda.svg|The [[flag of Bermuda]]\n|Flag of the Falkland Islands.svg|The flag of the [[Falkland Islands]]\n|Flag of Niue.svg|The [[flag of Niue]]\n|Flag of Taunton, Massachusetts.svg|The flag of [[Taunton, Massachusetts]]\n|Flag of Baton Rouge.svg|The [[flag of Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]\n|Flag of Coquimbo.svg|The flag of [[Coquimbo]], [[Chile]]\n|British Raj Red Ensign.svg|The [[flag of British India]] (1885\u20131947)\n|Grand Union Flag.svg|The flag of the [[United States]] (1775\u20131777) later named the [[Grand Union Flag]]\n|Flag of the United States of the Ionian Islands.svg|The [[flag of the United States of the Ionian Islands]] (1815\u20131864)\n|Flag of the Tamatave Kingdom (1826-1828).svg|The flag of the [[Tamatave|Tamatave Kingdom]] (1822\u20131828)\n|Flag of the Cook Islands Federation.svg|The flag of the [[Cook Islands Federation]] (1893\u20131901)\n|Flag of British Heligoland.svg|The flag of [[Heligoland#19th century|British Heligoland]] (1807\u20131890)\n|British Weihaiwei flag.svg|The [[flag of Weihaiwei]] (1903\u20131930)\n|Flag of Cyprus (1922\u20131960).svg|The flag of [[British Cyprus]] (1922\u20131960)\n|Flag of Malta (1943\u20131964).svg|1943 version of the [[flag of Malta]] until 1964\n|Canadian Red Ensign 1957-1965.svg|1957 version of the [[Canadian Red Ensign|Canadian civil ensign]], used until 1965\n|Flag of Trinidad and Tobago (1958\u20131962).svg|The [[flag of Trinidad and Tobago|flag of British Trinidad and Tobago]] (1958\u20131962)\n|Flag of Rhodesia (1964\u20131968).svg|The [[Flag of Southern Rhodesia#Rhodesia|flag of Rhodesia]] (1964\u20131968)\n|Flag of Singapore (1952\u20131959).svg|The [[flag of Singapore]] until 1959\n|Flag of South Africa 1928-1994.svg|''Oranje-blanje-blou'', or the [[Flag of South Africa (1928\u20131994)|flag of South Africa]]  (1928\u20131994)\n|Flag_of_Hong_Kong_1959.svg|The [[flag of Hong Kong]] until 1997\n}}\n\n===Ensigns===\n{{Main|British ensigns}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011|reason=no refs}}\nThe Union Flag can be found in the canton of several of the [[ensign]]s flown by vessels and aircraft of the United Kingdom and its overseas territories. These are used in cases where it is illegal to fly the Union Flag, such as at sea from a ship other than a British warship. Normal practice for British ships is to fly the [[White ensign]] (Royal Navy), the [[Red ensign]] (Merchant and private boats) or the [[Blue ensign]] (government departments and public corporations). Similar ensigns are used by other countries (such as [[List of New Zealand flags#Ensigns|New Zealand]] and [[List of Australian flags#Military and naval flags|Australia]]) with the Union Flag in the canton. Other Commonwealth countries (such as [[Indian Military Flags|India]] and [[List of Jamaican flags#Ensigns|Jamaica]]) may follow similar ensign etiquette as the UK, replacing the Union Flag with their own national flag.\n\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100\n|Naval Ensign of the United Kingdom.svg|[[White Ensign|Royal Navy White Ensign]]\n|Civil Ensign of the United Kingdom.svg|[[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]] [[Red Ensign]]\n|Ensign of the Royal Air Force.svg|[[Royal Air Force Ensign]]\n|Civil Air Ensign of the United Kingdom.svg|[[British Civil Air Ensign]]\n|Government Ensign of the United Kingdom.svg|[[Blue Ensign]]\n|Flag of Her Majesty's Coastguard.png|[[HM Coastguard]] Ensign\n|Ensign of the British Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses.svg|Ensign of the [[Northern Lighthouse Board]]\n|Civil Ensign of the Isle of Man.svg|[[Isle of Man]] Red Ensign\n|Government Ensign of Gibraltar.svg|Gibraltar State Ensign\n|Civil Ensign of the Cayman Islands.svg|[[Cayman Islands]] Red Ensign\n|Naval Ensign of Australia.svg|[[Royal Australian Navy]] Ensign\n|Ensign of the Royal Australian Air Force.svg|[[Royal Australian Air Force Ensign]]\n|Civil Ensign of Australia.svg|[[Australian Red Ensign|Australian Civil Ensign]]\n|Civil Air Ensign of Australia.svg|[[Australian Civil Aviation Ensign]]\n|Civil Air Ensign of New Zealand.svg|[[New Zealand Civil Air Ensign]]\n|Ensign of the Royal New Zealand Air Force.svg|[[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] Ensign\n|Naval Ensign of New Zealand.svg|[[Royal New Zealand Navy]] Ensign\n|Civil Ensign of New Zealand.svg|New Zealand Civil Ensign\n|Naval Ensign of Fiji.svg|[[Fiji|Fijian]] Naval Ensign\n|Civil Ensign of Fiji.svg|Fijian Civil Ensign\n|Civil Air Ensign of Fiji.svg|Fijian Civil Air Ensign\n}}\n\n===Pilot or Civil Jack===\n[[File:Civil Jack of the United Kingdom.svg|thumb|right|alt=Union Flag with thick white border comprising about half of the area of the flag.|The Union Jack with a white border]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2011|reason=needs more refs}}\nThe flag in a white border occasionally seen on merchant ships was sometimes referred to as the '''Pilot Jack'''. It can be traced back to 1823 when it was created as a signal flag, never intended as a civil jack. A book{{clarify |reason=What book? |date=September 2012}} issued to British [[consul (representative)|consul]]s in 1855 states that the white bordered Union Flag is to be hoisted for a pilot. Although there was some ambiguity regarding the legality of it being flown for any other purpose on civilian vessels, its use as an ensign or jack was established well in advance of the 1864 Act that designated the [[Red Ensign]] for merchant shipping. In 1970, the white-bordered Union Flag ceased to be the signal for a pilot, but references to it as national colours were not removed from the current Merchant Shipping Act and it was legally interpreted as a flag that could be flown on a merchant ship, as a jack if desired. This status was confirmed to an extent by the Merchant Shipping (Registration, etc.) Act 1993 and the consolidating Merchant Shipping Act 1995 which, in Section 4, Subsection 1, prohibits the use of any distinctive national colours or those used or resembling flags or pendants on Her Majesty's Ships, \"except the [[Red Ensign]], the Union flag (commonly known as the Union Jack) with a white border\", and some other exceptions permitted elsewhere in the Acts. However, Section 2 regards the \"British flag\", and states that \"The flag which every British ship is entitled to fly is the Red Ensign (without any defacement or modification) and, subject to (a warrant from Her Majesty or from the Secretary of State, or an Order of Council from her Majesty regarding a defaced [[Red Ensign]]), no other colours.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/21/data.pdf |title=Merchant Shipping Act 1995 |website=UK Public General Acts |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] |date=19 July 1995 |accessdate=2010-01-17}}</ref> Many civil vessels continue to fly the white bordered Union Flag without official opposition, making it the [[de facto]] Civil Jack.{{citation needed |date=September 2012}}\n\n===Other===\n[[File:Hudsons Bay Company Flag.svg|thumb|[[Flag of the Hudson's Bay Company]] which originated from its days as a British trading company]]\n\nThe [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) was one of a few non-government institutions using the Union Jack in part of the flag.

[[James VI and I|James VI of Scotland]] had inherited the English and Irish thrones in 1603 as James I, thereby [[Union of the Crowns|uniting the crowns]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] in a [[personal union]], although the three kingdoms remained separate states. On 12 April 1606, a new flag to represent this regal union between England and Scotland was specified in a royal decree, according to which the [[flag of England]], a red cross on a white background, known as ''[[St George's Cross]]'', and the [[flag of Scotland]], a white [[saltire]] on a blue background known as the ''Saltire'' or ''St Andrew's Cross'', would be joined together, forming the flag of England and Scotland for maritime purposes.\n\nThe present design of the Union Flag dates from a Royal proclamation following the [[Act of Union 1800|union]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] in 1801.<ref name=\"flaginst\">{{cite web |url=http://www.flaginstitute.org/index.php?location=7 |title=British flags |first=Graham |last=Bartram |website=The Flag Institute |accessdate=2007-05-02}}</ref> The flag combines aspects of three older national flags: the red cross of [[St George]] for the Kingdom of England, the white saltire of [[St Andrew]] for [[Scotland]] and the [[Saint Patrick's Saltire|red saltire]] of [[St Patrick]] to represent [[Ireland]].\n\nNotably, the [[Home Nations|home country]] of [[symbols of Wales|Wales is not represented separately]] in the Union Flag, as the flag was designed after the [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I of England|invasion of Wales in 1282]]. Hence Wales as a home country has no representation on the flag.

The word \"jack\" was in use before 1600 to describe the [[Jack (flag)|maritime bow flag]].<ref name=\"FlagInstitute\"/> By 1627 a small Union Jack was commonly flown in this position. One theory goes that for some years it would have been called just the \"Jack\", or \"Jack flag\", or the \"King's Jack\", but by 1674, while formally referred to as \"His Majesty's Jack\", it was commonly called the \"Union Jack\", and this was officially acknowledged.<ref name=\"flaginst\" />\n\nAmongst the proclamations issued by King George III at the time of the [[Acts of Union 1800|Union]] of 1801 was a proclamation concerning flags at sea, which repeatedly referred to \"Ensigns, Flags, Jacks, and Pendants\" and forbade merchant vessels from wearing \"Our Jack, commonly called the Union Jack\" nor any pendants or colours used by the King's ships.<ref name=\"London Gazette 1801-01-03\">{{London Gazette|issue=15325|date=3 January 1801|pages=25\u201327}}</ref>  Reinforcing the distinction the King's proclamation of the same day concerning the arms and flag of the United Kingdom (not colours at sea) called the new flag \"the Union Flag\".<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15325|date=3 January 1801|pages=23\u201324}}</ref>\n\nThe size and power of the [[Royal Navy]] internationally at the time could also explain why the flag was named the \"Union Jack\"; considering the navy was so widely utilised and renowned by the United Kingdom and [[British Empire|colonies]], it is possible that the term ''jack'' occurred because of its regular use on all British ships using the jackstaff (a flag pole attached to the bow of a ship). The term ''Union Jack'' possibly dates from Queen Anne's time (r. 1702\u201314), but its origin is uncertain. It may come from the 'jack-et' of the English or Scottish soldiers, or from the name of James I who originated the first union in 1603.

Its original [[blazon]], as decreed by [[George III of the United Kingdom]] on 1 January 1801, reads: \n<blockquote>\"the Union flag shall be azure, the crosses-saltires of St. Andrew and St. Patrick quartered per saltire counter changed argent and gules; the latter fimbriated of the second  [viz., argent]; surmounted by the cross of St. George of the third [viz., gules], fimbriated as the saltire [viz., argent].\"<ref>{{cite book|title=The European Magazine: And London Review|volume=39|publisher=Philological Society of London|year=1801|page=74 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qV83AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA74}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Specification===\n[[File:United Kingdom Flag Specifications.svg|350px|right|Diagram of the Union Flag's design]]\nThe Union Jack is normally twice as long as it is tall, a ratio of 1:2. In the United Kingdom, land flags are normally a ratio of 3:5; the Union Jack can also be made in this shape, but 1:2 is for most purposes. In 2008, MP [[Andrew Rosindell]] proposed a [[Ten Minute Rule]] bill to standardise the design of the flag at 3:5, but the bill did not proceed past the first reading.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2007-08/unionflag.html |accessdate=2014-04-09 |title=Union Flag Bill 2007\u201308 |publisher=UK Parliament}}</ref>\n\nFlags that have the Union Jack in the canton should always be 1:2 to preserve the square fly area.{{Clarify|date=February 2011}}\n\nThe three-component crosses that make up the Union Flag are sized as follows:\n* The red [[St George's Cross]] width is {{frac|1|5}} of the flag's height with a {{frac|1|15}} flag height [[fimbriation]]\n* The white diagonal [[Flag of Scotland|St Andrew's Cross]] width is {{frac|6|30}} of the flag's height, visible on either side of the St Patrick's Cross in diagonals of  {{frac|3|30}} and {{frac|1|30}} of the flag's height, respectively.\n* The red diagonal [[Saint Patrick's Saltire|St Patrick's Cross]] width is {{frac|1|15}} of the flag's height. It is offset by {{frac|3|30}} of the flag's height in an anti-clockwise direction. According to the official blazon of 1801, the white diagonal [[Flag of Scotland|St Andrew's Cross]] is in fact [[counterchanged]] with the red diagonal of  [[Saint Patrick's Saltire|St Patrick's Cross]]. In this interpretation, the width of both saltires is  {{frac|1|15}} of the flag's height, with fimbriations of  {{frac|1|30}} of the flag's height on either side of the red saltire.\n\nThe crosses and fimbriations retain their thickness relative to the flag's ''height'' whether they are shown with a ratio of 3:5 or 1:2.\n\nThe Admiralty in 1864 settled all official flags at proportions of 1:2, but the relative widths of the crosses remained unspecified, with the above conventions becoming standardised in the 20th century.<ref>by the 1970s,<!--this article is unaware  *when* this became standard, could be any time between 1801 and 1973.--> \"its current official dimension of l/30th the width of the flag\" ''The Flag Bulletin'', Volumes 12-14, Flag Research Center (1973), p. 85.</ref> In the 19th century, the Union flag was defined by the same blazon but could vary in its geometrical proportions.<ref>[https://www.justcollecting.com/miscellania/the-worlds-most-expensive-union-jack-sells-for-384k The World\u2019s Most Expensive Union Jack Sells For \u00a3384K]</ref>\n\n===Colours===\nThe colour specifications for the colours Union Jack (royal) blue, Union Flag red and white are:<ref name=Flagsofworld />\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Thus, there is a right side up.  The original specification of the Union Flag in the Royal Proclamation of 1 January 1801 did not contain a drawn pattern or express which way the saltires should lie; they were simply \"counterchanged\" and the red saltire fimbriated. Nevertheless, a convention was soon established which accords most closely with the description.\n\nWhen statically displayed, the hoist is on the observer's left. To fly the flag correctly, the white of St Andrew is ''above'' the red of St Patrick in the upper hoist canton (the quarter at the top nearest to the flag-pole). This is expressed by the phrases ''wide white top'' and ''broadside up''.\n\nThe first drawn pattern for the flag was in a parallel proclamation on 1 January 1801, concerning civil naval ensigns, which drawing shows the [[red ensign]] (also to be used as a red jack by [[privateer]]s).  As it appears in the ''[[London Gazette]]'', the broad stripe is where expected for three of the four quarters, but the upper left quarter shows the broad stripe below.<ref name=\"London Gazette 1801-01-03\" />\n\nIt is often stated that a flag upside down is a form of distress signal or even a deliberate insult. In the case of the Union Flag, the difference is subtle and is easily missed by the uninformed. It is often displayed upside down inadvertently\u2014even on commercially-made hand waving flags.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nOn 3 February 2009, the BBC reported that the flag had been inadvertently flown upside-down by the UK government at the signing of a trade agreement with Chinese premier [[Wen Jiabao]].

The ground of the current Union Flag is a deep \"[[navy blue|navy]]\" blue ([[Pantone]] 280), which can be traced to the colour used for the [[Blue Ensign]] of the [[Royal Navy]]'s historic \"Blue Squadron\". (Dark shades of colour were used on [[maritime flags]] on the basis of durability.) In 2003 a committee of the [[Scottish Parliament]] recommended that the flag of Scotland use a lighter \"[[royal blue|royal]]\" blue, (Pantone 300). (The Office of the [[Lord Lyon]] does not detail specific shades of colour for use in heraldry.)\n\nA thin white stripe, or [[fimbriation]], separates the red cross from the blue field, in accordance with heraldry's [[rule of tincture]] where colours (like red and blue) must be separated from each other by metals (like white, i.e. ''[[argent]]'' or silver). The [[blazon]] for the old union flag, to be compared with the current flag, is ''azure, the cross saltire of St Andrew argent surmounted by the Cross of St George gules, fimbriated of the second.''\n\n[[Wales]] had no explicit recognition in the Union Jack as it had been a part of the Kingdom of England since being annexed by [[Edward I of England]] in 1282 and its full integration by the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542]], and was therefore represented by the flag of England.<ref name=\"KnowBritain\"/>\n[[File:Flag of the Commonwealth (1658-1660).svg|thumb|alt=Red cross with a white border over a white saltire and dark blue background.

The fimbriation of the cross of St George separates its red from the red of the saltire.\n\nApart from the Union Jack, Saint Patrick's cross has seldom been used to represent Ireland, and with little popular recognition or enthusiasm; it is usually considered to derive from the arms of the powerful [[FitzGerald]] family rather than any association with the saint.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hayes-McCoy |first=Gerard Anthony |authorlink=Gerard Anthony Hayes-McCoy |title=A history of Irish flags from earliest times |editor-first=P\u00e1draig |editor-last=\u00d3 Snodaigh |editor-link=P\u00e1draig \u00d3 Snodaigh |publisher=Academy Press |location=Dublin |year=1979 |isbn=0-906187-01-X |page=38}}\n</ref>\n\n====Flag speculation after Irish independence====\nWhen the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] was concluded on 6 December 1921 and the creation of the new [[Irish Free State]] was an imminent prospect, the question arose as to whether the cross of Saint Patrick should remain in the Union Jack. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that on 22 January 1922:\n\n{{quote|text=At the College of Arms it was stated that certain modifications were under consideration and that if any action were taken it would be done by the King in Council. No parliamentary action would be necessary. Heraldry experts say that alterations in arms are very expensive. Some years ago there was a demand from Irish quarters that the blue ground of the golden harp on the royal standard should be changed to green. It was then estimated that the alteration would cost at least \u00a32,000,000. To remove all reference to Ireland from the present Union Jack and Royal Arms would be vastly more expensive.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/01/14/109830879.pdf |title=May Alter The Union Jack |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=14 January 1922 }}{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>}}\n\nThere was some speculation on the matter in British dominions also, with one New Zealand paper reporting that:\n{{quote|text=...the removal of the cross of St. Patrick Cross after 120 years will transform the appearance of the flag. It will certainly become a flag under which great victories were won in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but to most minds the sentimental loss will be great. Probably it will be found that the deletion is not absolutely necessary. Other possible changes include the abolition of the title of the United Kingdom, and the removal of the harp from the Royal Standard and the Coat of Arms, and the substitution of the Ulster emblem.<ref name=\"ashburton\">{{cite news |title=Signs of Heraldry |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=AG19211213.2.31.5&srpos=2&e=-------10--1----2%22Irish+Free+State%22-all |newspaper=[[Ashburton Guardian]] |volume=XLII |issue=9409 |date=13 December 1921 |page=5 |publisher=[[National Library of New Zealand]] |accessdate=2012-01-09}}</ref>}}\n\nHowever, the fact that it was likely that [[Northern Ireland]] would choose not to remain part of the Irish Free State after its foundation and remain in the United Kingdom, gave better grounds for keeping the cross of St. Patrick in the Union Jack. In this regard, [[Sir James Craig]], the [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]] remarked in December 1921 that he and his government were \"glad to think that our decision [to remain part of United Kingdom] will obviate the necessity of mutilating the Union Jack.\"<ref name=\"ulster\">{{cite news |title=The Position of Ulster |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=AG19211216.2.25.5&srpos=14&e=-------10--11----2%22Irish+Free+State%22-all |newspaper=[[Ashburton Guardian]] |volume=XLII |issue=9413 |date=16 December 1921 |page=5 |publisher=[[National Library of New Zealand]] |accessdate=2012-01-09}}</ref> Though remaining within the United Kingdom, the new government of Northern Ireland dispensed with the St Patrick's Saltire in favour of [[Ulster banner|a new flag]] derived from the [[House of Burke|coat-of-arms of the Burkes]], Earls of Ulster, and quite similar to England's St George's Cross.\n\nUltimately, when the British [[home secretary]] was asked on 7 December 1922 (the day after the Irish Free State was established) whether the [[Garter Principal King of Arms|Garter King of Arms]] was \"to issue any Regulations with reference to the national flag consequent to the passing of the Irish Free State Constitution Act\", the response was no and the flag has never been changed.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=National Flag (Irish Free State) |title=House of Commons |website=[[Hansard]] |date=7 December 1922 |volume=159 |chapter-url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1922/dec/07/national-flag-irish-free-state |at=cc2015-6W}}</ref>\n\nA [[Question Time|D\u00e1il question]] in 1961 mooted raising the removal of the cross of St Patrick with the British government; Frank Aiken, the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Irish minister for external affairs]], declined to \"waste time on heraldic disputations\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/1961/08/03/00018.asp |title=Ceisteanna\u2014Questions.

A compromise was reached in which both flags were flown on official buildings.

As former British Empire nations were granted independence, these and other versions of the Union Flag were decommissioned. The most recent decommissioning of the Union Flag came on 1 July 1997, when the former [[History of Colonial Hong Kong (1800s\u20131930s)|Dependent Territory of Hong Kong]] was handed over to the People's Republic of China.\n\nAll administrative regions and territories of the United Kingdom fly the Union Jack in some form, with the exception of [[Flag of Gibraltar|Gibraltar]] (other than the government ensign). The [[Crown Dependencies]] are legally not part of the United Kingdom, and the Union Jack is not an official flag there. Outside the UK, the Union Jack is usually part of a special [[ensign]] in which it is placed in the upper left hand corner of a blue field, with a signifying crest in the bottom right.\n\n[[File:Arthur Mees Flags of A Free Empire 1910 Cornell CUL PJM 1167 01.jpg|thumb|Map of the [[British Empire]] (as of 1910)]]\nFour former British colonies in Oceania which are now independent countries incorporate the Union Jack as part of their national flags: Australia, New Zealand and [[Tuvalu]], which have retained the monarchy; and [[Fiji]], which [[1987 Fijian coups d'\u00e9tat|abolished the monarchy in 1987]].\n\nIn former British colonies, the Union Jack was used interchangeably with informal flags of the territory for significant parts of their colonial early history. The Union Flag was used as the flag of Canada until it was re-adopted as a ceremonial flag, and the Maple Leaf flag made the official national flag in 1965. In addition to being an official ceremonial flag, the Union Flag also defaces the flags of a number of Canadian provinces, including [[British Columbia]], [[Manitoba]], and [[Ontario]]. [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] uses a flag that was derived from the Union Flag, with the Union Jack serving as the flag of Newfoundland until 1980. The Union Flag, and flags defaced with the Union Flag in its canton, like the Canadian Red Ensign, continue to see use in Canada in a private capacity. The pre-1801 Union Flag also sees limited use by private organizations, most notably the [[United Empire Loyalists]] Association of Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uelac.org/Loyalist-Monuments/Loyalist-Flag.php|title=History of the Loyalist Flag|publisher=United Empire Loyalists Association of Canada|accessdate=18 March 2020|website=www.uelac.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190923234311/http://www.uelac.org/Loyalist-Monuments/Loyalist-Flag.php|archive-date=23 September 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAlong with the national flag, many other [[List of Australian flags|Australian]] flags retain the use of the Union Jack, including the [[Royal Australian Navy Ensign]] (also known as the Australian White Ensign), the [[Royal Australian Air Force Ensign]], the [[Australian Red Ensign]] (for use by merchant and private vessels), and the [[Australian Civil Aviation Ensign]]. The flags of all six Australian States retain the Union Jack in the canton, as do some regional flags such as the Upper and Lower [[Murray River Flag]]s. The Vice-Regal flags of the State Governors also use the Union Jack. While the [[Flags Act 1953]] states that Australians still have the \"right or privilege\" to fly the Union Jack after the introduction of the Australian National Flag, usage of the Union Jack by itself is unusual.\n\nThe [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country's]] flag, the [[Ikurri\u00f1a]], is also loosely based on the Union Jack, reflecting the significant commercial ties between [[Bilbao]] and Britain at the time the [[Ikurri\u00f1a]] was designed in 1894. The [[Miskito people|Miskito]] people sometimes use a similar flag that also incorporates the Union Jack in its canton, due to long periods of contact in the [[Mosquito Coast]].\n\n[[File:Flag of Hawaii.svg|thumb|right|alt=Thin red white and blue horizontal stripes with Union Flag as top-left quarter.|''Ka Hae Hawai{{okina}}i'', or the [[flag of Hawaii]]]]\nThe Union Jack was used by the United States in its first flag, the [[Grand Union Flag]]. This flag was of a similar design to the one used by the [[British East India Company]]. Hawaii, a state of the United States but located in the central Pacific, incorporates the Union Jack in its [[Flag of Hawaii|state flag]]. According to one story, the King of Hawaii asked the British mariner, [[George Vancouver]], during a stop in Lahaina, what the piece of cloth flying from his ship was. Vancouver replied that it represented his king's authority. The Hawaiian king then adopted and flew the flag as a symbol of his own royal authority not recognising its national derivation. Hawaii's flag represents the only current use of the Union Jack in any American state flag.\n\nAlso in the United States, the Union Flag of 1606 is incorporated into the [[flag of Baton Rouge]], the capital city of Louisiana. Baton Rouge was a British colony from the time of the [[Seven Years' War]] until the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], when it was captured by Spanish forces. Symbols from the colonial powers France and Spain are also incorporated into the Baton Rouge flag. [[Taunton, Massachusetts]], used a [[Flag of Taunton, Massachusetts|flag]] with the old style Union Flag by a resolution on October 19, 1974.  Likewise, [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania]], has been known to fly a flag containing the King's Colours since 1973.<ref>{{FOTW|id=us-pa-wc|title=Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania (U.S.)}}</ref>\n\nThe Union Jack also appeared on both the 1910\u20131928 and 1928\u20131994 [[South African Flag#History|flags]] of South Africa. The [[South Africa Red Ensign|1910\u20131928 flag]] was a [[red ensign]] with the [[Coat of arms of South Africa (1910\u20132000)|Union coat of arms]] in the fly. The 1928\u20131994 flag, based on the [[Prinsenvlag]] and commonly known as the ''oranje-blanje-blou'' (orange-white-blue), contained the Union Jack as part of a central motif at par with the flags of the two [[Boer republics]] of the [[Orange Free State]] and [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]. To keep any one of the three flags from having precedence, the Union Jack is spread horizontally from the Orange Free State flag towards the hoist; closest to the hoist, it is in the superior position but since it is reversed it does not precede the other flags.\n\nThe flag of the Municipal Council of [[Shanghai International Settlement]] in 1869 contained multiple flags to symbolize the countries have participated in the creation and management of this enclave in the Chinese city of Shanghai. The Union Jack was contained as part of top left hand shield close to the flags of the United States and [[Second French Empire|France]], there was also contained the [[flag of Prussia]], but it was removed around 1917.\n\nThe flag of the [[Chile]]an city of [[Coquimbo]] features the Union Jack, owing to its historical commercial links to Britain.\n\n<!-- this gallery is for examples (not an exhaustive list) of current usages of the Union Jack at country, province/state or city level -->\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100\n|Flag of New Zealand.svg|The [[flag of New Zealand]]\n|Flag of Tuvalu.svg|The [[flag of Tuvalu]]\n|Flag of the Cook Islands.svg|The [[flag of the Cook Islands]]\n|Flag of Fiji.svg|The [[flag of Fiji]]\n|Flag of Queensland.svg|The [[Queensland]] State flag\n|Flag of British Columbia.svg|The [[flag of British Columbia|flag of the Province of British Columbia]], [[Canada]]\n|Flag of Ontario.svg|The flag of the [[Ontario|Province of Ontario]], Canada\n|Flag_of_Manitoba.svg|The [[Flag of Manitoba|flag]] of the Province of [[Manitoba]], Canada\n|Flag of Newfoundland_and_Labrador.svg|The [[Flag of Newfoundland and Labrador|flag]] of the Province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], Canada\n|Flag of the British Indian Ocean Territory.svg|The [[flag of the British Indian Ocean Territory]]\n|Flag of Bermuda.svg|The [[flag of Bermuda]]\n|Flag of the Falkland Islands.svg|The flag of the [[Falkland Islands]]\n|Flag of Niue.svg|The [[flag of Niue]]\n|Flag of Taunton, Massachusetts.svg|The flag of [[Taunton, Massachusetts]]\n|Flag of Baton Rouge.svg|The [[flag of Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]\n|Flag of Coquimbo.svg|The flag of [[Coquimbo]], [[Chile]]\n|British Raj Red Ensign.svg|The [[flag of British India]] (1885\u20131947)\n|Grand Union Flag.svg|The flag of the [[United States]] (1775\u20131777) later named the [[Grand Union Flag]]\n|Flag of the United States of the Ionian Islands.svg|The [[flag of the United States of the Ionian Islands]] (1815\u20131864)\n|Flag of the Tamatave Kingdom (1826-1828).svg|The flag of the [[Tamatave|Tamatave Kingdom]] (1822\u20131828)\n|Flag of the Cook Islands Federation.svg|The flag of the [[Cook Islands Federation]] (1893\u20131901)\n|Flag of British Heligoland.svg|The flag of [[Heligoland#19th century|British Heligoland]] (1807\u20131890)\n|British Weihaiwei flag.svg|The [[flag of Weihaiwei]] (1903\u20131930)\n|Flag of Cyprus (1922\u20131960).svg|The flag of [[British Cyprus]] (1922\u20131960)\n|Flag of Malta (1943\u20131964).svg|1943 version of the [[flag of Malta]] until 1964\n|Canadian Red Ensign 1957-1965.svg|1957 version of the [[Canadian Red Ensign|Canadian civil ensign]], used until 1965\n|Flag of Trinidad and Tobago (1958\u20131962).svg|The [[flag of Trinidad and Tobago|flag of British Trinidad and Tobago]] (1958\u20131962)\n|Flag of Rhodesia (1964\u20131968).svg|The [[Flag of Southern Rhodesia#Rhodesia|flag of Rhodesia]] (1964\u20131968)\n|Flag of Singapore (1952\u20131959).svg|The [[flag of Singapore]] until 1959\n|Flag of South Africa 1928-1994.svg|''Oranje-blanje-blou'', or the [[Flag of South Africa (1928\u20131994)|flag of South Africa]]  (1928\u20131994)\n|Flag_of_Hong_Kong_1959.svg|The [[flag of Hong Kong]] until 1997\n}}\n\n===Ensigns===\n{{Main|British ensigns}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011|reason=no refs}}\nThe Union Flag can be found in the canton of several of the [[ensign]]s flown by vessels and aircraft of the United Kingdom and its overseas territories. These are used in cases where it is illegal to fly the Union Flag, such as at sea from a ship other than a British warship. Normal practice for British ships is to fly the [[White ensign]] (Royal Navy), the [[Red ensign]] (Merchant and private boats) or the [[Blue ensign]] (government departments and public corporations). Similar ensigns are used by other countries (such as [[List of New Zealand flags#Ensigns|New Zealand]] and [[List of Australian flags#Military and naval flags|Australia]]) with the Union Flag in the canton.

It can be traced back to 1823 when it was created as a signal flag, never intended as a civil jack. A book{{clarify |reason=What book? |date=September 2012}} issued to British [[consul (representative)|consul]]s in 1855 states that the white bordered Union Flag is to be hoisted for a pilot. Although there was some ambiguity regarding the legality of it being flown for any other purpose on civilian vessels, its use as an ensign or jack was established well in advance of the 1864 Act that designated the [[Red Ensign]] for merchant shipping. In 1970, the white-bordered Union Flag ceased to be the signal for a pilot, but references to it as national colours were not removed from the current Merchant Shipping Act and it was legally interpreted as a flag that could be flown on a merchant ship, as a jack if desired. This status was confirmed to an extent by the Merchant Shipping (Registration, etc.) Act 1993 and the consolidating Merchant Shipping Act 1995 which, in Section 4, Subsection 1, prohibits the use of any distinctive national colours or those used or resembling flags or pendants on Her Majesty's Ships, \"except the [[Red Ensign]], the Union flag (commonly known as the Union Jack) with a white border\", and some other exceptions permitted elsewhere in the Acts. However, Section 2 regards the \"British flag\", and states that \"The flag which every British ship is entitled to fly is the Red Ensign (without any defacement or modification) and, subject to (a warrant from Her Majesty or from the Secretary of State, or an Order of Council from her Majesty regarding a defaced [[Red Ensign]]), no other colours.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/21/data.pdf |title=Merchant Shipping Act 1995 |website=UK Public General Acts |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] |date=19 July 1995 |accessdate=2010-01-17}}</ref> Many civil vessels continue to fly the white bordered Union Flag without official opposition, making it the [[de facto]] Civil Jack.{{citation needed |date=September 2012}}\n\n===Other===\n[[File:Hudsons Bay Company Flag.svg|thumb|[[Flag of the Hudson's Bay Company]] which originated from its days as a British trading company]]\n\nThe [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) was one of a few non-government institutions using the Union Jack in part of the flag.

The definition varies among countries; usually it is a type of [[secondary school]].<ref name=Osmani1983>{{harvnb|Osmani|Shefik|p=384}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n''Lyceum'' is a [[Latin]] rendering of the [[Ancient Greek]] \u039b\u03cd\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (''Lykeion''), the name of a ''[[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]]'' in [[Classical Athens]] dedicated to [[Apollo Lyceus]]. [[Lyceum (Classical)|This original lyceum]] is remembered as the location of the [[peripatetic school]] of [[Aristotle]]. Some countries derive the name for their modern schools from the Latin but use the Greek name for the ancient school: for example, Dutch has ''Lykeion'' (ancient) and ''Lyceum'' (modern), both rendered \"lyceum\" in English (note that in classical Latin the \"C\" in ''lyceum'' was always pronounced as a K, not a soft C, as in modern English).\n\nThe name ''[[Lyc\u00e9e]]'' was retrieved and utilized by [[Napoleon]] in 1802 to name the main secondary education establishments. From France the name spread in many countries influenced by French culture.\n\n==By country==\n===Asia===\n====India====\nThe Goa Lyceum ([[portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Liceu de Goa'') in [[Panaji]], [[Goa]] \u2013 established in 1854, following the Portuguese model \u2013 was the first public secondary school in the state, then a Portuguese territory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goaindiatourism.com/goa/education-in-goa.html|title=Goa Education}}</ref> Later, the Goa Lyceum received the official title of ''Liceu Nacional Afonso de Albuquerque'' ([[Afonso de Albuquerque]] National Lyceum).\n\n====Philippines====\nThe Philippines follows its version of the [[K-12]] system, where the term ''junior high school'' might be used instead of lyceum. However, there are schools that appropriate the word \"lyceum\" in their brand. [[Lyceum of the Philippines University]] (LPU) is a university in [[Manila]] established by former wartime president [[Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lpu.edu.ph/index.php/about-lpu|title=Lyceum of the Philippines University - About LPU|website=www.lpu.edu.ph|access-date=2019-09-11}}</ref> Among its notable alumni are current president [[Rodrigo Duterte]], popular author [[Rene Villanueva]], and actor [[Cesar Montano]]. LPU has campuses in Makati, Batangas, Laguna, Cavite, and Davao.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lpu.edu.ph/index.php/campuses|title=Lyceum of the Philippines University - Campuses|website=www.lpu.edu.ph|access-date=2019-09-11}}</ref> There are other schools that call themselves \"Lyceum\" but are unaffiliated with LPU.\n\n====Turkey====\nThe [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word for the latest part of pre-university education is ''lise'' which is derived from the French word \"lyc\u00e9e\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Ni\u015fanyan|first=Sevan|url=http://www.nisanyansozluk.com/search.asp?w=lise&x=0&y=0|title=\"Lise\" in the Sevan Ni\u015fanyan Etymological Dictionary|accessdate=2009-02-13|language=Turkish}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> and corresponds to \"high school\" in English. It lasts 4 to 5 years with respect to the type of the high school. At the end of their \"lise\" education, students take the TYT / AYT test, i.e. university entrance examination, to get the right to enroll in a public university or a private university.\n\n====Uzbekistan and Tajikistan====\nLyceums also emerged in the former Soviet Union countries after they became independent. One typical example is Uzbekistan, where all high schools were replaced with lyceums (\"litsey\" is the Russian term, derived from French \"lyc\u00e9e\"), offering a three-year educational program with a certain major in a certain direction. Unlike Turkey, Uzbek lyceums do not hold University entrance examination, which gives students the right to enter a University, but they hold a kind of \"mock examination\" which is designed to test their eligibility for a certain University.\n\n===Europe===\n====Albania====\nThe [[Albanian National Lyceum]] was a high school in the city of [[Kor\u00e7\u00eb]], [[Albania]], that emphasized the French culture and the European values. The school fully functioned with a French culture emphasis from 1917 to 1939. The school was continued post World War II as the [[Raqi Qirinxhi High School]].<ref name=Xoxi1997>{{harvnb|Xoxi|Koli|p=1}}</ref>\n\n====Belarus====\nThe [[Belarusian Humanities Lyceum]] is a private secondary school founded shortly after Belarus' independence from the [[USSR]] by intellectuals, such as [[Vincuk Viacorka]] and Uladzimir Kolas, with the stated aims of preserving and promoting native Belarusian culture, and raising a new Belarusian elite. It was shut down in 2003 by the Ministry of Education of Belarus allegedly for promoting enmity within Belarusian society and using the classroom as a political soapbox, indoctrinating students with biased views on history, ideology, politics, morality and values. The lyceum eventually switched to homeschooling with a limited number of underground home schoolers.\n\n====Czech Republic====\nThe term ''lyceum'' refers to a type of secondary education consisting of anywhere from 4 years ended by graduation. It is a type between grammar school and a technical high school. For example, the famous scientist [[Gerty Cori]] went to a \"lyceum\" school.\n\n====Finland====\nThe concept and name ''lyceum'' (in Swedish, ''lyseo'' in Finnish) entered Finland through Sweden.  Traditionally, lycea were schools to prepare students to enter universities, as opposed to the typical, more general education.  Some old schools continue to use the name ''lyceum'', though their operations today vary.  For example, Helsinki Normal Lyceum educates students in grades 7\u201312, while Oulu Lyceum enrolls students only in grades 10\u201312.  The more commonly used term for upper secondary school in Finland is ''lukio'' in Finnish, ''gymnasium'' in Swedish.\n\n====France====\nThe [[French language|French]] word for an upper secondary school, ''lyc\u00e9e'', derives from Lyceum. (see [[Secondary education in France]].)\n\n====Germany====\n[[File:Unterrichts Anstalt f\u00fcr die weibliche Jugend 01.jpg|thumb|upright|''M\u00e4dchenschule'' (Lyzeum) in Wittenberg]]\nThe lyceum in Germany was known as an old term for [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]] for girls.

It gives preparation for [[university]].\nIt's divided into four different branches, each one specialized in certain subjects:\n* Liceo Classico (Classic Lyceum) is the most various between them but it's known for focusing on history, ancient Greek and Latin.\n* Liceo Scientifico (Scientific Lyceum) focuses on maths, physics, biology and chemistry.\n* Liceo Linguistico (Languages\u2019 Lyceum) focuses mostly entirely on a certain number of languages. It's up to each school to decide which language to teach, but Italian and English are always present.\n* Liceo Artistico (Arts\u2019 Lyceum) focuses on Arts history and practical arts (varying from drawing to painting to sculpturing)\nThe lyceum is considered by most the hardest and most prestigious kind of secondary school in Italy.\n\n====Latvia====\nThe first Lyceum in [[Riga]] was founded in 1675 by the king [[Charles XI of Sweden]] (in Latin, ''Schola Carolina''), and was renamed to the Imperial Lyceum of Riga (in German, ''Kaiserliches Lyceum zu Riga'') in 1733.  \nIn September 1921, the [[Riga French Lyc\u00e9e]], an upper secondary school supported by the [[Government of France]] was founded in Riga.\nIn 1989, during [[Latvian National Awakening]] the [[Pushkin Lyceum of Riga]] (''Pu\u0161kina licejs'') with education programs in [[Russian language|Russian]] was established. \nIn 2002, another Russian Lyceum was established in [[Daugavpils]] (''Daugavpils Krievu vidusskola - licejs''), renamed to Daugavpils High School of Technologies (''Daugavpils Tehnolo\u0123iju vidusskola - licejs'') in 2020.\n\n====Lithuania====\nSome gymnasiums are called ''lic\u0117jus'', e. g. [[Vilnius Lyceum]].\n\n====Malta====\nJunior lyceums refer to secondary education state owned schools.\n\n====Republic of Moldova====\nUntil recently, in the Republic of Moldova the lyceum - called liceu - was an educational institution where students studied from the first to the twelfth grade and would obtain the Baccalaureate degree upon completion. In most cases, the lyceums were specialized in a particular domain (fine art, theatre, language) that was relevant to the personality whose name the institution bore. In other respects, it was little different from any regular school, with the exception of slightly higher education standards and supposedly being more prestigious. \nAfter 2010, regular schools were all formally reformed into lyceums, although their quality remained of the same level as before and most did not get any particular specialization, thereby being dubbed 'Theory Lyceums' ('Liceu Teoretic'). One reason for the 2010 reform was to reduce the influence of the Soviet/ Russian educational system and/ or mentality in Moldova.\n\n====Netherlands====\nIn the Netherlands, a lyceum is a [[selective school|selective]] secondary school for children aged 12\u201318 that offers \"[[voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs]]\" (vwo) and \"[[hoger algemeen voortgezet onderwijs]]\" (havo), the top and middle levels of secondary education available in that country. Successful completion allows vwo students admission to university and havo students to [[hogeschool]], comparable to [[vocational university]]. The term lyceum is also sometimes used for other [[vocational school]]s such as the [[:nl:Grafische School|Grafisch Lyceum]], or ''Muzieklyceum Amsterdam'', which grew into the [[Conservatorium van Amsterdam]].\n\n====Poland====\n[[File:I LO im.

Polish liceums are attended by children aged 16 to 19\u201321 (see list below). Before graduating, pupils are subject to a final examination, the ''[[matura]]''.\n\nPolish liceums are of several types:\n*[[Liceum Og\u00f3lnokszta\u0142c\u0105ce|general lyceum]] (16\u201319)\n*[[specialised lyceum]] (16\u201319)\n* complementary lyceum (18-21)\n\n====Portugal====\nFrom 1836 until 1978, in the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Education in Portugal|educational system]], the lyceum ({{lang-pt|liceu}}), or national lyceum ({{lang-pt|liceu nacional}}), was a [[high school]] that prepared students to enter [[Higher education in Portugal|universities]] or more general education. On the other hand, the technical school ({{lang-pt|escola t\u00e9cnica}}) was a technical-oriented school.\n\nAfter several [[education reform]]s, all these schools merged into a single system of \"3rd cycle basic\" and [[Secondary education|secondary schools]] (Portuguese: escolas b\u00e1sicas do 3.\u00ba ciclo e secund\u00e1rias), offering [[Educational stages|grades 7 to 12]].\n\n====Romania====\nThe Romanian word for lyceum is ''liceu''. It represents a post-secondary form of education. In order for a student to graduate the lyceum and obtain a baccalaureate diploma, they must pass the [[Romanian Baccalaureate|bac]]. The lyceum consists of four school years (15\u201319). Although the lyceum is a pre-university educational institution, it can be enough for the graduates to find a job, mainly as office work.\n\n====Russia====\nIn Imperial Russia, a Lyceum was one of the following higher educational facilities: Demidov Lyceum of Law in [[Yaroslavl]] (1803), Alexander Lyceum in [[Tsarskoye Selo]] (1810), Richelieu Lyceum in [[Odessa]] (1817), and Imperial [[Mikhail Katkov|Katkov]] Lyceum in Moscow (1867).\n\nThe '''[[Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum]]''' was opened on October 19, 1811 in the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] building designed by [[Vasily Stasov]] and situated next to the [[Catherine Palace]]. The first graduates were all brilliant and included [[Aleksandr Pushkin]] and [[Alexander Gorchakov]]. The opening date was celebrated each year with carousals and revels, and Pushkin composed new verses for each of those occasions. In January 1844 the Lyceum was moved to [[Saint Petersburg]].\n\nDuring 33 years of the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum's existence, there were 286 graduates. The most famous of these were [[Anton Delwig]], [[Wilhelm K\u00fcchelbecher]], [[Nicholas de Giers]], [[Dmitry Tolstoy]], [[Yakov Karlovich Grot]], [[Nikolay Yakovlevich Danilevsky]], [[Alexei Lobanov-Rostovsky]] and [[Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin]].\n\n====Serbia====\nThe ''[[Lyceum of the Principality of Serbia]]'' was the first [[higher education]] school in [[Serbia]] in which education was taught in [[Serbian language|Serbian]]. It was founded in 1838 on the initiative of Prince [[Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107]] in 1838 in [[Kragujevac]], then the capital of Serbia. When [[Belgrade]] became the Serbian capital in 1841, the Serbian Lyceum opened there. In 1863 it became known as the [[Grandes \u00e9coles]] until 1905 when it officially changed its name to the [[University of Belgrade]].\n\n====Ukraine====\nAccording to the Law of Ukraine \"On Education\", Lyceum is a level III secondary institution of education (or a structural unit of another institution of education) that provides field-specific secondary education.<ref>https://mon.gov.ua/ua/npa/law-education#_Toc493603848</ref> As it is planned, since 2027 a three-year senior school will be a lyceum of academic or vocational training. In vocational school, a student will master his/ her first profession, whereas in an academic lyceum he/she will deepen personal knowledge of specific subjects that will be studied further at a higher education establishment. Graduates of academic lyceums will be able to obtain a Bachelor's degree in three years (in most specialties) instead of four.<ref>https://ukraineworld.org/articles/reforms/ukrainian-education-new-era</ref>\n\nNowadays one of the types of lyceums in Ukraine is [http://www.mil.gov.ua/diyalnist/vijskova-osvita-na-tauka/vijskovi-liczei-ta-liczei-z-posilenoyu/ military lyceums and lyceums with intensive military and physical training].\n\n===North America===\n====United States====\n\nSee [[Lyceum movement]].\nThoreau speaks of lecturing at a lyceum in \"Life Without Principle\".\nSee [[Comparison of American and British English#Education|Comparison of USA and UK secondary school years]] (except Scotland)\n\n===South America===\n====Chile====\nIt is not uncommon in Chile to use the word ''liceo'' when referring to a high school. Another term is \"ense\u00f1anza media\" (secondary education); however, ''liceo'' is the most common term due to Chile's extensive European influence.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Comparison of American and British English#school|Comparison of US and UK Education]]\n*[[Lyceum (Classical)]]\n*[[Educational stage]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|last=Xoxi|first=Koli|year=1997|title=Liceu Komb\u00ebtar i Kor\u00e7\u00ebs (1917-1939)|publisher=Sht\u00ebpia Botuese \"Lumo Sk\u00ebndo\"|language=Albanian|oclc=45500476}}\n*{{citation|last=Osmani|first=Shefik|year=1983|title=Fjalor i pedagogjis\u00eb|publisher=Sht\u00ebpia Botuese \"8 N\u00ebntori\"|language=Albanian|oclc=\t17442147}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20041019004756/http://www.buwiwm.edu.pl/educ/educ.htm Polish System of Education]\n\n{{schools}}\n\n[[Category:School types]]\n[[Category:Lyceums|*]]\n\n[[es:Liceo]]\n[[fr:Lyc\u00e9e]]\n* Lyceum college of medicine international students www.lyceumnorthwesternuniversity.com\n[[Category:Education in Europe by country]]\n[[Category:Education by continent]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the type of school|Aristotle's Lyceum|Lyceum (Classical)|individual schools, and other buildings and uses}}\n{{short description|Type of school, usually a secondary school}}\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nThe '''lyceum''' is a category of [[educational institution]] defined within the [[education system]] of many countries, mainly in [[Europe]]. The definition varies among countries; usually it is a type of [[secondary school]].<ref name=Osmani1983>{{harvnb|Osmani|Shefik|p=384}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n''Lyceum'' is a [[Latin]] rendering of the [[Ancient Greek]] \u039b\u03cd\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (''Lykeion''), the name of a ''[[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]]'' in [[Classical Athens]] dedicated to [[Apollo Lyceus]]. [[Lyceum (Classical)|This original lyceum]] is remembered as the location of the [[peripatetic school]] of [[Aristotle]]. Some countries derive the name for their modern schools from the Latin but use the Greek name for the ancient school: for example, Dutch has ''Lykeion'' (ancient) and ''Lyceum'' (modern), both rendered \"lyceum\" in English (note that in classical Latin the \"C\" in ''lyceum'' was always pronounced as a K, not a soft C, as in modern English).\n\nThe name ''[[Lyc\u00e9e]]'' was retrieved and utilized by [[Napoleon]] in 1802 to name the main secondary education establishments. From France the name spread in many countries influenced by French culture.\n\n==By country==\n===Asia===\n====India====\nThe Goa Lyceum ([[portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Liceu de Goa'') in [[Panaji]], [[Goa]] \u2013 established in 1854, following the Portuguese model \u2013 was the first public secondary school in the state, then a Portuguese territory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goaindiatourism.com/goa/education-in-goa.html|title=Goa Education}}</ref> Later, the Goa Lyceum received the official title of ''Liceu Nacional Afonso de Albuquerque'' ([[Afonso de Albuquerque]] National Lyceum).\n\n====Philippines====\nThe Philippines follows its version of the [[K-12]] system, where the term ''junior high school'' might be used instead of lyceum. However, there are schools that appropriate the word \"lyceum\" in their brand. [[Lyceum of the Philippines University]] (LPU) is a university in [[Manila]] established by former wartime president [[Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lpu.edu.ph/index.php/about-lpu|title=Lyceum of the Philippines University - About LPU|website=www.lpu.edu.ph|access-date=2019-09-11}}</ref> Among its notable alumni are current president [[Rodrigo Duterte]], popular author [[Rene Villanueva]], and actor [[Cesar Montano]].

It lasts 4 to 5 years with respect to the type of the high school. At the end of their \"lise\" education, students take the TYT / AYT test, i.e. university entrance examination, to get the right to enroll in a public university or a private university.\n\n====Uzbekistan and Tajikistan====\nLyceums also emerged in the former Soviet Union countries after they became independent. One typical example is Uzbekistan, where all high schools were replaced with lyceums (\"litsey\" is the Russian term, derived from French \"lyc\u00e9e\"), offering a three-year educational program with a certain major in a certain direction. Unlike Turkey, Uzbek lyceums do not hold University entrance examination, which gives students the right to enter a University, but they hold a kind of \"mock examination\" which is designed to test their eligibility for a certain University.\n\n===Europe===\n====Albania====\nThe [[Albanian National Lyceum]] was a high school in the city of [[Kor\u00e7\u00eb]], [[Albania]], that emphasized the French culture and the European values. The school fully functioned with a French culture emphasis from 1917 to 1939. The school was continued post World War II as the [[Raqi Qirinxhi High School]].<ref name=Xoxi1997>{{harvnb|Xoxi|Koli|p=1}}</ref>\n\n====Belarus====\nThe [[Belarusian Humanities Lyceum]] is a private secondary school founded shortly after Belarus' independence from the [[USSR]] by intellectuals, such as [[Vincuk Viacorka]] and Uladzimir Kolas, with the stated aims of preserving and promoting native Belarusian culture, and raising a new Belarusian elite. It was shut down in 2003 by the Ministry of Education of Belarus allegedly for promoting enmity within Belarusian society and using the classroom as a political soapbox, indoctrinating students with biased views on history, ideology, politics, morality and values. The lyceum eventually switched to homeschooling with a limited number of underground home schoolers.\n\n====Czech Republic====\nThe term ''lyceum'' refers to a type of secondary education consisting of anywhere from 4 years ended by graduation. It is a type between grammar school and a technical high school. For example, the famous scientist [[Gerty Cori]] went to a \"lyceum\" school.\n\n====Finland====\nThe concept and name ''lyceum'' (in Swedish, ''lyseo'' in Finnish) entered Finland through Sweden.  Traditionally, lycea were schools to prepare students to enter universities, as opposed to the typical, more general education.  Some old schools continue to use the name ''lyceum'', though their operations today vary.  For example, Helsinki Normal Lyceum educates students in grades 7\u201312, while Oulu Lyceum enrolls students only in grades 10\u201312.  The more commonly used term for upper secondary school in Finland is ''lukio'' in Finnish, ''gymnasium'' in Swedish.\n\n====France====\nThe [[French language|French]] word for an upper secondary school, ''lyc\u00e9e'', derives from Lyceum. (see [[Secondary education in France]].)\n\n====Germany====\n[[File:Unterrichts Anstalt f\u00fcr die weibliche Jugend 01.jpg|thumb|upright|''M\u00e4dchenschule'' (Lyzeum) in Wittenberg]]\nThe lyceum in Germany was known as an old term for [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]] for girls.

It gives preparation for [[university]].\nIt's divided into four different branches, each one specialized in certain subjects:\n* Liceo Classico (Classic Lyceum) is the most various between them but it's known for focusing on history, ancient Greek and Latin.\n* Liceo Scientifico (Scientific Lyceum) focuses on maths, physics, biology and chemistry.\n* Liceo Linguistico (Languages\u2019 Lyceum) focuses mostly entirely on a certain number of languages. It's up to each school to decide which language to teach, but Italian and English are always present.\n* Liceo Artistico (Arts\u2019 Lyceum) focuses on Arts history and practical arts (varying from drawing to painting to sculpturing)\nThe lyceum is considered by most the hardest and most prestigious kind of secondary school in Italy.\n\n====Latvia====\nThe first Lyceum in [[Riga]] was founded in 1675 by the king [[Charles XI of Sweden]] (in Latin, ''Schola Carolina''), and was renamed to the Imperial Lyceum of Riga (in German, ''Kaiserliches Lyceum zu Riga'') in 1733.  \nIn September 1921, the [[Riga French Lyc\u00e9e]], an upper secondary school supported by the [[Government of France]] was founded in Riga.\nIn 1989, during [[Latvian National Awakening]] the [[Pushkin Lyceum of Riga]] (''Pu\u0161kina licejs'') with education programs in [[Russian]] was established. \nIn 2002, another Russian Lyceum was established in [[Daugavpils]] (''Daugavpils Krievu vidusskola - licejs''), renamed to Daugavpils High School of Technologies (''Daugavpils Tehnolo\u0123iju vidusskola - licejs'') in 2020.\n\n====Lithuania====\nSome gymnasiums are called ''lic\u0117jus'', e. g. [[Vilnius Lyceum]].\n\n====Malta====\nJunior lyceums refer to secondary education state owned schools.\n\n====Republic of Moldova====\nUntil recently, in the Republic of Moldova the lyceum - called liceu - was an educational institution where students studied from the first to the twelfth grade and would obtain the Baccalaureate degree upon completion. In most cases, the lyceums were specialized in a particular domain (fine art, theatre, language) that was relevant to the personality whose name the institution bore. In other respects, it was little different from any regular school, with the exception of slightly higher education standards and supposedly being more prestigious. \nAfter 2010, regular schools were all formally reformed into lyceums, although their quality remained of the same level as before and most did not get any particular specialization, thereby being dubbed 'Theory Lyceums' ('Liceu Teoretic'). One reason for the 2010 reform was to reduce the influence of the Soviet/ Russian educational system and/ or mentality in Moldova.\n\n====Netherlands====\nIn the Netherlands, a lyceum is a [[selective school|selective]] secondary school for children aged 12\u201318 that offers \"[[voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs]]\" (vwo) and \"[[hoger algemeen voortgezet onderwijs]]\" (havo), the top and middle levels of secondary education available in that country. Successful completion allows vwo students admission to university and havo students to [[hogeschool]], comparable to [[vocational university]]. The term lyceum is also sometimes used for other [[vocational school]]s such as the [[:nl:Grafische School|Grafisch Lyceum]], or ''Muzieklyceum Amsterdam'', which grew into the [[Conservatorium van Amsterdam]].\n\n====Poland====\n[[File:I LO im. Jaros\u0142awa D\u0105browskiego w Tomaszowie Mazowieckim.

Polish liceums are attended by children aged 16 to 19\u201321 (see list below). Before graduating, pupils are subject to a final examination, the ''[[matura]]''.\n\nPolish liceums are of several types:\n*[[Liceum Og\u00f3lnokszta\u0142c\u0105ce|general lyceum]] (16\u201319)\n*[[specialised lyceum]] (16\u201319)\n* complementary lyceum (18-21)\n\n====Portugal====\nFrom 1836 until 1978, in the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Education in Portugal|educational system]], the lyceum ({{lang-pt|liceu}}), or national lyceum ({{lang-pt|liceu nacional}}), was a [[high school]] that prepared students to enter [[Higher education in Portugal|universities]] or more general education. On the other hand, the technical school ({{lang-pt|escola t\u00e9cnica}}) was a technical-oriented school.\n\nAfter several [[education reform]]s, all these schools merged into a single system of \"3rd cycle basic\" and [[Secondary education|secondary schools]] (Portuguese: escolas b\u00e1sicas do 3.\u00ba ciclo e secund\u00e1rias), offering [[Educational stages|grades 7 to 12]].\n\n====Romania====\nThe Romanian word for lyceum is ''liceu''. It represents a post-secondary form of education. In order for a student to graduate the lyceum and obtain a baccalaureate diploma, they must pass the [[Romanian Baccalaureate|bac]]. The lyceum consists of four school years (15\u201319). Although the lyceum is a pre-university educational institution, it can be enough for the graduates to find a job, mainly as office work.\n\n====Russia====\nIn Imperial Russia, a Lyceum was one of the following higher educational facilities: Demidov Lyceum of Law in [[Yaroslavl]] (1803), Alexander Lyceum in [[Tsarskoye Selo]] (1810), Richelieu Lyceum in [[Odessa]] (1817), and Imperial [[Mikhail Katkov|Katkov]] Lyceum in Moscow (1867).\n\nThe '''[[Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum]]''' was opened on October 19, 1811 in the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] building designed by [[Vasily Stasov]] and situated next to the [[Catherine Palace]]. The first graduates were all brilliant and included [[Aleksandr Pushkin]] and [[Alexander Gorchakov]]. The opening date was celebrated each year with carousals and revels, and Pushkin composed new verses for each of those occasions. In January 1844 the Lyceum was moved to [[Saint Petersburg]].\n\nDuring 33 years of the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum's existence, there were 286 graduates. The most famous of these were [[Anton Delwig]], [[Wilhelm K\u00fcchelbecher]], [[Nicholas de Giers]], [[Dmitry Tolstoy]], [[Yakov Karlovich Grot]], [[Nikolay Yakovlevich Danilevsky]], [[Alexei Lobanov-Rostovsky]] and [[Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin]].\n\n====Serbia====\nThe ''[[Lyceum of the Principality of Serbia]]'' was the first [[higher education]] school in [[Serbia]] in which education was taught in [[Serbian language|Serbian]]. It was founded in 1838 on the initiative of Prince [[Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107]] in 1838 in [[Kragujevac]], then the capital of Serbia. When [[Belgrade]] became the Serbian capital in 1841, the Serbian Lyceum opened there. In 1863 it became known as the [[Grandes \u00e9coles]] until 1905 when it officially changed its name to the [[University of Belgrade]].\n\n====Ukraine====\nAccording to the Law of Ukraine \"On Education\", Lyceum is a level III secondary institution of education (or a structural unit of another institution of education) that provides field-specific secondary education.<ref>https://mon.gov.ua/ua/npa/law-education#_Toc493603848</ref> As it is planned, since 2027 a three-year senior school will be a lyceum of academic or vocational training. In vocational school, a student will master his/ her first profession, whereas in an academic lyceum he/she will deepen personal knowledge of specific subjects that will be studied further at a higher education establishment. Graduates of academic lyceums will be able to obtain a Bachelor's degree in three years (in most specialties) instead of four.<ref>https://ukraineworld.org/articles/reforms/ukrainian-education-new-era</ref>\n\nNowadays one of the types of lyceums in Ukraine is [http://www.mil.gov.ua/diyalnist/vijskova-osvita-na-tauka/vijskovi-liczei-ta-liczei-z-posilenoyu/ military lyceums and lyceums with intensive military and physical training].\n\n===North America===\n====United States====\n\nSee [[Lyceum movement]].\nThoreau speaks of lecturing at a lyceum in \"Life Without Principle\".\nSee [[Comparison of American and British English#Education|Comparison of USA and UK secondary school years]] (except Scotland)\n\n===South America===\n====Chile====\nIt is not uncommon in Chile to use the word ''liceo'' when referring to a high school. Another term is \"ense\u00f1anza media\" (secondary education); however, ''liceo'' is the most common term due to Chile's extensive European influence.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Comparison of American and British English#school|Comparison of US and UK Education]]\n*[[Lyceum (Classical)]]\n*[[Educational stage]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|last=Xoxi|first=Koli|year=1997|title=Liceu Komb\u00ebtar i Kor\u00e7\u00ebs (1917-1939)|publisher=Sht\u00ebpia Botuese \"Lumo Sk\u00ebndo\"|language=Albanian|oclc=45500476}}\n*{{citation|last=Osmani|first=Shefik|year=1983|title=Fjalor i pedagogjis\u00eb|publisher=Sht\u00ebpia Botuese \"8 N\u00ebntori\"|language=Albanian|oclc=\t17442147}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20041019004756/http://www.buwiwm.edu.pl/educ/educ.htm Polish System of Education]\n\n{{schools}}\n\n[[Category:School types]]\n[[Category:Lyceums|*]]\n\n[[es:Liceo]]\n[[fr:Lyc\u00e9e]]\n* Lyceum college of medicine international students www.lyceumnorthwesternuniversity.com\n[[Category:Education in Europe by country]]\n[[Category:Education by continent]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toRussian(link changed toRussian language) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyceum"}

It was started in 1953 with a single aircraft. Initially, it operated cargo and passenger [[charter flight]]s from [[London Southend Airport|Southend]] (1953\u20131955) and [[Blackbushe Airport|Blackbushe]] airports (1955\u20131960) using a variety of piston-engined aircraft{{sfn|Simons|1993|p=10, 31}} before moving to a new base at [[London Gatwick Airport]] in 1960, followed by expansion into [[inclusive tour]] (IT) charter flights and all-year round scheduled services.{{sfn|Heathcote-Smith|1973|p=[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1973/1973%20-%201488.html 836]}} The introduction of two [[De Havilland Comet 4|de Havilland Comet series 4]] jet aircraft in 1966 made Dan-Air the second [[United Kingdom|British]] independent airline after [[British United Airways]] to begin sustained jet operations.\n\nThe early 1970s saw the acquisition of a pair of [[Boeing 707]] long-haul jets for use on [[Caledonian Airways#Attaining market leadership in transatlantic affinity group charters|affinity group]] and [[Advance Booking Charter]] flights to [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].{{sfn|Simons|1993|pp=71\u201373, 83\u201384, 120}}<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1975/1975%20-%202116.html |title=Dan-Air  |journal=Flight International |date=9 October 1975 |page=519 |publisher=Flightglobal.com  |accessdate=7 January 2012}}</ref> In 1973, Dan-Air became the first British airline to operate the [[Boeing 727]] trijet.  By the mid-1970s, it had become Britain's largest independent airline, both in terms of passengers carried and fleet size, operating the country's largest [[charter airline|charter fleet]].

The acquisition of an [[Airbus A300]] in 1986 marked Dan-Air's [[wide-body aircraft|widebody]] debut and the late 1980s saw a major expansion of their scheduled activities, including the introduction of two-class services on trunk routes. Passenger numbers peaked in 1989 at 6.2 million (1.8 million on scheduled services).{{sfn|Simons|1993|p=254}}\n\nLack of [[vertical integration]] with a [[tour operator]], and an inefficient fleet mix dominated by ageing Boeing 727s and [[BAC One-Eleven]]s made Dan-Air uncompetitive, resulting in increasing marginalisation and growing financial difficulties as well as a change in [[senior management]] and [[strategic management|strategy]] by the early 1990s.{{sfn|Simons|1993|pp=188\u2013190, 193\u20134, 200\u20131, 220, 256}} Following unsuccessful attempts to merge Dan-Air with a competitor, the ailing airline was sold to [[British Airways]] in 1992 for the nominal sum of [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]1.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginning===\n[[File:Douglas C-47B G-AMSU Dan-Air BLA 09.04.55 edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|The airline's first aircraft G-AMSU, a [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas<br>C-47B Dakota 4]] at [[Blackbushe Airport]] in 1955 wearing the initial ''Dan-Air Services'' titles.]]\n\nDan-Air's [[holding company#Parent company|parent]] Davies and Newman had been engaged in shipbroking in the [[City of London]] since 1922. It subsequently diversified into [[air charter]] broking from an office at London's [[Baltic Mercantile and Shipping Exchange]]. Amongst Davies and Newman's clients for whom it acted as an air charter broker was a small airline called Meredith Air Transport. Meredith was formed in 1952 as a small ''ad hoc'' [[charter airline|charter operator]] and flew a single [[Douglas DC-3]] out of [[London Southend Airport|Southend Airport]], where it also had its head office. When Meredith's only aircraft suffered a mishap while taking off from [[Jerusalem]]'s [[Atarot Airport]] on Christmas Eve 1952 that damaged the aircraft's tailwheel, this caused major disruption to the company's business. As a result, Meredith soon found itself in financial difficulties. Davies and Newman agreed to take a [[debenture]] on Meredith's aircraft in return for extending financial assistance. When Meredith's financial problems worsened and the debenture became due for repayment, Davies and Newman took over the aircraft together with a six-month contract to operate a series of charter flights between Southend and West Berlin's [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport#Postwar commercial use|Tempelhof Airport]] that formed part of the [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport#Postwar commercial use|second ''Little Berlin Airlift'']].{{sfn|''Aircraft''|2010|p=53}}<ref name=\"DA_Sun_46\">''Flying to the sun \u2013 A history of Britain's holiday airlines: 5.

The additional exits were needed for having the aircraft certificated for an increased maximum seating capacity of 150. This necessitated satisfying the British [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|Civil Aviation Authority]] (CAA) requirement that all passengers could leave within 90 seconds using only half the available exits.

This stall-protection system consisted of a stick pusher, a \"nudger\" and an independent \"shaker\" for each pilot. When the aircraft was in danger of stalling it warned the pilots by shaking the [[control column]]s as well as correcting [[aircraft attitude|attitude]] and [[Altitude#Altitude in aviation and in spaceflight|altitude]], in an attempt to increase air speed and so avert an irrecoverable deep stall. It was estimated that installing stall-protection cost Dan-Air \u00a3100,000 per aircraft and up to \u00a31 million for the entire fleet.{{sfn|Heathcote-Smith|1973|p=837}}<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%203506.html |title=Belfast: Tomorrow's Guppy? |journal=Flight International |date=22 September 1979 |page=973 |publisher=Flightglobal.com |accessdate=7 January 2012}}</ref><ref>''Fly me, I'm Freddie!'', Eglin, R. and Ritchie, B., Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1980, p122</ref>{{sfn|Simons|1993|p=122}}\n\nAs well as the Comets and [[Boeing 727|727]]s, Dan-Air mainly operated BAC One-Elevens and Hawker Siddeley 748s during its most successful period in the 1970s and 1980s.{{sfn|Simons|1993|pp=232\u2013238}}\n\nIn May 1983, Dan-Air became the first to put the four-engined [[British Aerospace 146|BAe 146]] regional jetliner into commercial service.<ref name=\"FI1985-27/30\"/>{{rp|28}}<ref name=\"146_InauguralFlight\">{{citation |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1983/1983%20-%201007.html |title=Dan-Air's new BAe 146 |journal=Flight International |date=4 June 1983 |page=1635 |publisher=Flightglobal.com |accessdate=7 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe aircraft types below formed part of Dan-Air's fleet at one point or another in the airline's 39-year history:\n\n[[File:Gatwick1976-mrh.jpg|thumb|Dan-Air [[de Havilland Comet]]s and<br>[[BAC One-Eleven]]s at [[London Gatwick Airport]] in 1976.]]\n[[File:Comet-G-APZM-jpg.jpg|thumb|[[de Havilland Comet]] next to a [[Boeing 707]] at [[Manchester Airport]] in 1976.]]\n[[File:Dan-Air London B-727 G-BAFZ.jpg|thumb|right| A Dan-Air [[Boeing 727#727-100|Boeing 727-100]] in 1974 (note the additional emergency door at the rear of the fuselage).]]\n\n* [[Airbus A300#A300B4|Airbus A300 B4]]\n* [[Airspeed Ambassador]]\n* [[Avro York]]\n* [[BAC One-Eleven]] 200/300/400/500 series\n* [[British Aerospace 146|BAe 146]]-100/300\n* [[Boeing 707]]-320/320C\n* [[Boeing 727]]-100/200 Advanced\n* [[Boeing 737]]-200/200 Advanced/300/400\n* [[Bristol Freighter]]\n* [[de Havilland Comet]] series 4/4B/4C\n* [[de Havilland Dove]]\n* [[de Havilland Heron]]\n* [[Douglas DC-3]]\n* [[Douglas DC-4]]\n* [[Douglas DC-7]]\n* [[Handley Page Dart Herald]]\n* [[Hawker Siddeley 748]] series 1/2\n* [[Nord 262]]\n* [[Piper PA-23|Piper Apache]]\n* [[Vickers Viscount]] series 700/800.\n\n===Commercial success===\n[[File:Dan-Air BAC-111 at Zurich Airport in May 1985.jpg|thumb|right|A Dan-Air [[BAC One-Eleven]] coming in to land at [[Z\u00fcrich Airport]] in May 1985.]]\n[[File:Museum of Flight DH Comet interior.jpg|left|thumb|The interior of Dan-Air [[de Havilland Comet#Comet 4|Comet 4C]] G-BDIX on display at the [[National Museum of Flight]], [[East Fortune]], [[Scotland]].]]\n[[File:Dan-Air Airbus A300 Rees.jpg|thumb|right|A Dan-Air [[Airbus A300]] taxiing towards its stand at [[London Gatwick Airport|London Gatwick]] in March 1990.]]\nDan-Air's acquisition of three ex-[[RAF Transport Command]] Avro Yorks in 1954 resulted in establishment of [[Dan-Air Engineering]] as a sister company at [[Lasham Airfield|Lasham]], a disused [[World War II|war]]-time airfield in [[Hampshire]], to service its fleet as well as other operators.{{sfn|Heathcote-Smith|1973|p=836}}{{sfn|Simons|1993|pp=15}}\n\nThe acquisition of a second DC-3 in 1954 resulted in Dan-Air moving its main operating base from Southend to Blackbushe the following year.{{sfn|''Aircraft''|2010|p=53}}{{sfn|Simons|1993|p=10}}<ref name=\"DA_Sun_46\"/> The main base transferred to Gatwick in 1960 when Blackbushe closed to commercial airlines.<ref name=\"Blackbushe772\">{{citation |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1960/1960%20-%200764.html |title=Where Are The Blackbushe Tenants Now? |journal=Flight International |date=3 June 1960 |pages=772\u2013773 |publisher=Flightglobal.com  |accessdate=7 January 2012}}</ref>{{sfn|Simons|1993|p=31}}\n\nDan-Air's arrival at Gatwick in 1960 coincided with the entry into service of three former [[Butler Air Transport]] [[Airspeed Ambassador]]s, the airline's first [[cabin pressurization|pressurise]]d aircraft.

To assist with marketing its transatlantic capacity to affinity group charter organisers in both countries, Dan-Air established a new joint venture named Dan-Air Intercontinental in partnership with CPS Aviation Services as a jointly owned subsidiary.

Dan-Air was the last major independent provider of charter airline seats to numerous large, medium-sized and small tour companies in the UK and overseas, at a time when most UK tour firms had set up their own airlines. These then competed with Dan-Air for the bulk of those operators' business, leading to a decline in rates. This resulted in a decline in Dan-Air's importance as a business partner for these tour operators, reducing its status from main to marginal provider.{{sfn|Simons|1993|pp=188, 190, 220}}\n\nAnother reason was that its fleet contained too many different, incompatible aircraft types. Some of these aircraft were older<ref name=\"restructuring\"/> and less efficient than those operated by competitors such as [[Air Europe]]. Consequently, the Dan-Air fleet was costlier to operate and maintain. The Boeing 727s, which Dan-Air continued to acquire throughout the 1980s, including some on unfavourable [[aircraft lease|lease]]s, proved a financial millstone.<ref name=\"D_N_James_ProgressReport\"/>{{sfn|Simons|1993|pp=193\u2013194, 220}}\n\nDan-Air's decision to embark on a major expansion into scheduled services from Gatwick at a time when the UK economy was still mired in the [[early 1990s recession]] made the financial position worse. The economic conditions in the UK meant that actual revenues fell short of budget in Dan-Air's 1991\u20131995 [[business plan]], which aimed at sustained profitability by 1995 with a \u00a342 million profit.{{sfn|Simons|1993|pp=188\u2013190, 200\u2013201}} This meant an injection of \u00a349 million of additional [[working capital]] into Dan-Air's [[holding company#Parent company|parent company]] from a successful share issue in 1990<ref name=\"refinancing\">{{citation |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1991/1991%20-%202623.html |title=Dan-Air hopes to be revived by refinancing plan |journal=Flight International |date=9\u201315 October 1991 |page=17 |publisher=Flightglobal.com  |accessdate=7 January 2012}}</ref> was insufficient to fund the airline's needs.

The airline saw this as risk minimisation to fill seats on scheduled services. However, Dan-Air surrendered control over its scheduled seats to third parties whose sales were volume-driven.

It was started in 1953 with a single aircraft. Initially, it operated cargo and passenger [[charter flight]]s from [[London Southend Airport|Southend]] (1953\u20131955) and [[Blackbushe Airport|Blackbushe]] airports (1955\u20131960) using a variety of piston-engined aircraft{{sfn|Simons|1993|p=10, 31}} before moving to a new base at [[London Gatwick Airport]] in 1960, followed by expansion into [[inclusive tour]] (IT) charter flights and all-year round scheduled services.{{sfn|Heathcote-Smith|1973|p=[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1973/1973%20-%201488.html 836]}} The introduction of two [[De Havilland Comet 4|de Havilland Comet series 4]] jet aircraft in 1966 made Dan-Air the second [[United Kingdom|British]] independent airline after [[British United Airways]] to begin sustained jet operations.\n\nThe early 1970s saw the acquisition of a pair of [[Boeing 707]] long-haul jets for use on [[Caledonian Airways#Attaining market leadership in transatlantic affinity group charters|affinity group]] and [[Advance Booking Charter]] flights to [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].{{sfn|Simons|1993|pp=71\u201373, 83\u201384, 120}}<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1975/1975%20-%202116.html |title=Dan-Air  |journal=Flight International |date=9 October 1975 |page=519 |publisher=Flightglobal.com  |accessdate=7 January 2012}}</ref> In 1973, Dan-Air became the first British airline to operate the [[Boeing 727]] trijet.  By the mid-1970s, it had become Britain's largest independent airline, both in terms of passengers carried and fleet size, operating the country's largest [[charter airline|charter fleet]]. This was also the time a Dan-Air staff member became Britain's<ref name=\"UK_female_aviators\"/> and [[Europe]]'s first female jet [[pilot in command|captain]].{{sfn|Simons|1993|pp=113\u2013115}}\n\nBy the early 1980s, the airline had also become the leading operator of [[fixed wing]] [[petroleum industry|oil industry]] support flights, operating a fleet of 13 [[Hawker Siddeley 748]] [[turboprop]]s between bases on the [[Scotland|Scottish]] mainland and the [[Shetland Islands]] under contract to firms involved in [[North Sea]] [[hydrocarbon exploration|oil exploration]].{{sfn|Simons|1993|pp=93\u2013100}}\nIn 1983, Dan-Air was the first airline to launch commercial operations with [[British Aerospace|BAe]]'s [[British Aerospace 146|146]] [[regional jet]].  The acquisition of an [[Airbus A300]] in 1986 marked Dan-Air's [[wide-body aircraft|widebody]] debut and the late 1980s saw a major expansion of their scheduled activities, including the introduction of two-class services on trunk routes. Passenger numbers peaked in 1989 at 6.2 million (1.8 million on scheduled services).{{sfn|Simons|1993|p=254}}\n\nLack of [[vertical integration]] with a [[tour operator]], and an inefficient fleet mix dominated by ageing Boeing 727s and [[BAC One-Eleven]]s made Dan-Air uncompetitive, resulting in increasing marginalisation and growing financial difficulties as well as a change in [[senior management]] and [[strategic management|strategy]] by the early 1990s.{{sfn|Simons|1993|pp=188\u2013190, 193\u20134, 200\u20131, 220, 256}} Following unsuccessful attempts to merge Dan-Air with a competitor, the ailing airline was sold to [[British Airways]] in 1992 for the nominal sum of [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]1.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginning===\n[[File:Douglas C-47B G-AMSU Dan-Air BLA 09.04.55 edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|The airline's first aircraft G-AMSU, a [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas<br>C-47B Dakota 4]] at [[Blackbushe Airport]] in 1955 wearing the initial ''Dan-Air Services'' titles.]]\n\nDan-Air's [[holding company#Parent company|parent]] Davies and Newman had been engaged in shipbroking in the [[City of London]] since 1922. It subsequently diversified into [[air charter]] broking from an office at London's [[Baltic Mercantile and Shipping Exchange]]. Amongst Davies and Newman's clients for whom it acted as an air charter broker was a small airline called Meredith Air Transport. Meredith was formed in 1952 as a small ''ad hoc'' [[charter airline|charter operator]] and flew a single [[Douglas DC-3]] out of [[London Southend Airport|Southend Airport]], where it also had its head office. When Meredith's only aircraft suffered a mishap while taking off from [[Jerusalem]]'s [[Atarot Airport]] on Christmas Eve 1952 that damaged the aircraft's tailwheel, this caused major disruption to the company's business. As a result, Meredith soon found itself in financial difficulties. Davies and Newman agreed to take a [[debenture]] on Meredith's aircraft in return for extending financial assistance. When Meredith's financial problems worsened and the debenture became due for repayment, Davies and Newman took over the aircraft together with a six-month contract to operate a series of charter flights between Southend and West Berlin's [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport#Postwar commercial use|Tempelhof Airport]] that formed part of the [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport#Postwar commercial use|second ''Little Berlin Airlift'']].{{sfn|''Aircraft''|2010|p=53}}<ref name=\"DA_Sun_46\">''Flying to the sun \u2013 A history of Britain's holiday airlines: 5.

Dan-Air's examples featured additional emergency doors each side of the rear fuselage as well as a [[stall (flight)|stall]]-protection system known as a \"[[stick pusher]]\". The additional exits were needed for having the aircraft certificated for an increased maximum seating capacity of 150. This necessitated satisfying the British [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|Civil Aviation Authority]] (CAA) requirement that all passengers could leave within 90 seconds using only half the available exits.

This stall-protection system consisted of a stick pusher, a \"nudger\" and an independent \"shaker\" for each pilot. When the aircraft was in danger of stalling it warned the pilots by shaking the [[control column]]s as well as correcting [[aircraft attitude|attitude]] and [[Altitude#Altitude in aviation and in spaceflight|altitude]], in an attempt to increase air speed and so avert an irrecoverable deep stall. It was estimated that installing stall-protection cost Dan-Air \u00a3100,000 per aircraft and up to \u00a31 million for the entire fleet.{{sfn|Heathcote-Smith|1973|p=837}}<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%203506.html |title=Belfast: Tomorrow's Guppy? |journal=Flight International |date=22 September 1979 |page=973 |publisher=Flightglobal.com |accessdate=7 January 2012}}</ref><ref>''Fly me, I'm Freddie!'', Eglin, R. and Ritchie, B., Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1980, p122</ref>{{sfn|Simons|1993|p=122}}\n\nAs well as the Comets and [[Boeing 727|727]]s, Dan-Air mainly operated BAC One-Elevens and Hawker Siddeley 748s during its most successful period in the 1970s and 1980s.{{sfn|Simons|1993|pp=232\u2013238}}\n\nIn May 1983, Dan-Air became the first to put the four-engined [[British Aerospace 146|BAe 146]] regional jetliner into commercial service.<ref name=\"FI1985-27/30\"/>{{rp|28}}<ref name=\"146_InauguralFlight\">{{citation |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1983/1983%20-%201007.html |title=Dan-Air's new BAe 146 |journal=Flight International |date=4 June 1983 |page=1635 |publisher=Flightglobal.com |accessdate=7 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe aircraft types below formed part of Dan-Air's fleet at one point or another in the airline's 39-year history:\n\n[[File:Gatwick1976-mrh.jpg|thumb|Dan-Air [[de Havilland Comet]]s and<br>[[BAC One-Eleven]]s at [[London Gatwick Airport]] in 1976.]]\n[[File:Comet-G-APZM-jpg.jpg|thumb|[[de Havilland Comet]] next to a [[Boeing 707]] at [[Manchester Airport]] in 1976.]]\n[[File:Dan-Air London B-727 G-BAFZ.jpg|thumb|right| A Dan-Air [[Boeing 727#727-100|Boeing 727-100]] in 1974 (note the additional emergency door at the rear of the fuselage).]]\n\n* [[Airbus A300#A300B4|Airbus A300 B4]]\n* [[Airspeed Ambassador]]\n* [[Avro York]]\n* [[BAC One-Eleven]] 200/300/400/500 series\n* [[British Aerospace 146|BAe 146]]-100/300\n* [[Boeing 707]]-320/320C\n* [[Boeing 727]]-100/200 Advanced\n* [[Boeing 737]]-200/200 Advanced/300/400\n* [[Bristol Freighter]]\n* [[de Havilland Comet]] series 4/4B/4C\n* [[de Havilland Dove]]\n* [[de Havilland Heron]]\n* [[Douglas DC-3]]\n* [[Douglas DC-4]]\n* [[Douglas DC-7]]\n* [[Handley Page Dart Herald]]\n* [[Hawker Siddeley 748]] series 1/2\n* [[Nord 262]]\n* [[Piper PA-23|Piper Apache]]\n* [[Vickers Viscount]] series 700/800.\n\n===Commercial success===\n[[File:Dan-Air BAC-111 at Zurich Airport in May 1985.jpg|thumb|right|A Dan-Air [[BAC One-Eleven]] coming in to land at [[Z\u00fcrich Airport]] in May 1985.]]\n[[File:Museum of Flight DH Comet interior.jpg|left|thumb|The interior of Dan-Air [[de Havilland Comet#Comet 4|Comet 4C]] G-BDIX on display at the [[National Museum of Flight]], [[East Fortune]], [[Scotland]].]]\n[[File:Dan-Air Airbus A300 Rees.jpg|thumb|right|A Dan-Air [[Airbus A300]] taxiing towards its stand at [[London Gatwick Airport|London Gatwick]] in March 1990.]]\nDan-Air's acquisition of three ex-[[RAF Transport Command]] Avro Yorks in 1954 resulted in establishment of [[Dan-Air Engineering]] as a sister company at [[Lasham Airfield|Lasham]], a disused [[World War II|war]]-time airfield in [[Hampshire]], to service its fleet as well as other operators.{{sfn|Heathcote-Smith|1973|p=836}}{{sfn|Simons|1993|pp=15}}\n\nThe acquisition of a second DC-3 in 1954 resulted in Dan-Air moving its main operating base from Southend to Blackbushe the following year.{{sfn|''Aircraft''|2010|p=53}}{{sfn|Simons|1993|p=10}}<ref name=\"DA_Sun_46\"/> The main base transferred to Gatwick in 1960 when Blackbushe closed to commercial airlines.<ref name=\"Blackbushe772\">{{citation |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1960/1960%20-%200764.html |title=Where Are The Blackbushe Tenants Now? |journal=Flight International |date=3 June 1960 |pages=772\u2013773 |publisher=Flightglobal.com  |accessdate=7 January 2012}}</ref>{{sfn|Simons|1993|p=31}}\n\nDan-Air's arrival at Gatwick in 1960 coincided with the entry into service of three former [[Butler Air Transport]] [[Airspeed Ambassador]]s, the airline's first [[cabin pressurization|pressurise]]d aircraft.

To assist with marketing its transatlantic capacity to affinity group charter organisers in both countries, Dan-Air established a new joint venture named Dan-Air Intercontinental in partnership with CPS Aviation Services as a jointly owned subsidiary. Flights began in late-March 1971 with a [[Boeing 707#707-320|Boeing 707-321]] that was acquired second-hand from [[Pan American World Airways]] (Pan Am).

Dan-Air was the last major independent provider of charter airline seats to numerous large, medium-sized and small tour companies in the UK and overseas, at a time when most UK tour firms had set up their own airlines. These then competed with Dan-Air for the bulk of those operators' business, leading to a decline in rates. This resulted in a decline in Dan-Air's importance as a business partner for these tour operators, reducing its status from main to marginal provider.{{sfn|Simons|1993|pp=188, 190, 220}}\n\nAnother reason was that its fleet contained too many different, incompatible aircraft types. Some of these aircraft were older<ref name=\"restructuring\"/> and less efficient than those operated by competitors such as [[Air Europe]]. Consequently, the Dan-Air fleet was costlier to operate and maintain. The Boeing 727s, which Dan-Air continued to acquire throughout the 1980s, including some on unfavourable [[aircraft lease|lease]]s, proved a financial millstone.<ref name=\"D_N_James_ProgressReport\"/>{{sfn|Simons|1993|pp=193\u2013194, 220}}\n\nDan-Air's decision to embark on a major expansion into scheduled services from Gatwick at a time when the UK economy was still mired in the [[early 1990s recession]] made the financial position worse. The economic conditions in the UK meant that actual revenues fell short of budget in Dan-Air's 1991\u20131995 [[business plan]], which aimed at sustained profitability by 1995 with a \u00a342 million profit.{{sfn|Simons|1993|pp=188\u2013190, 200\u2013201}} This meant an injection of \u00a349 million of additional [[working capital]] into Dan-Air's [[holding company#Parent company|parent company]] from a successful share issue in 1990<ref name=\"refinancing\">{{citation |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1991/1991%20-%202623.html |title=Dan-Air hopes to be revived by refinancing plan |journal=Flight International |date=9\u201315 October 1991 |page=17 |publisher=Flightglobal.com  |accessdate=7 January 2012}}</ref> was insufficient to fund the airline's needs.

Evidence of the presence of Jewish people in [[Muscovy|Muscovite Russia]] is first documented in the chronicles of 1471. During the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]] in the 18th century, Jewish people were restricted to the [[Pale of Settlement]] within Russia, the territory where they could live or immigrate to. [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] escalated anti-Jewish policies. Beginning in the 1880s, waves of [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|anti-Jewish pogroms]] swept across different regions of the empire for several decades. More than two million Jews fled Russia between 1880 and 1920, mostly to the United States and what is today the State of Israel.\n\nThe [[Pale of Settlement]] took away many of the rights that the Jewish people of the late 17th century Russia were experiencing.

In 1495, [[Alexander the Jagiellonian]] expelled Jewish residents from [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], but reversed his decision in 1503.\n\nIn the ''[[shtetl]]s'' populated almost entirely by Jews, or in the middle-sized town where Jews constituted a significant part of population, Jewish communities traditionally ruled themselves according to [[halakha]], and were limited by the privileges granted them by local rulers. (See also [[Shtadlan]]). These Jews were not assimilated into the larger eastern European societies, and identified as an [[ethnic group]] with a unique set of religious beliefs and practices, as well as an ethnically-unique economic role.\n\n[[File:Shafirov.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Peter Shafirov]], vice-chancellor of Russia under [[Peter the Great]]]]\n\n== Tsardom of Russia ==\nDocumentary evidence as to the presence of Jews in [[Muscovy|Muscovite Russia]] is first found in the chronicles of 1471.

Jews residing in Russian and Ukrainian towns suffered numerous religious persecutions. Converted Jews occasionally rose to important positions in the Russian State, for example [[Peter Shafirov]], vice-chancellor under Peter the Great. Shafirov was born into a Jewish family of Polish origin. He had extraordinary knowledge of foreign languages and served as the chief translator in the Russian Foreign Office, subsequently he began to accompany Tsar Peter on his international travels. Following this, he was raised to the rank of vice-chancellor because of his many diplomatic talents and skills, but was later imprisoned, sentenced to death, and eventually banished.\n\n[[File:Schneur Zalman of Liadi.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]], founder of [[Chabad Lubavitch]], 1775]]\n\n==Russian Empire==\n{{See also|Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|Kishinev pogrom|Antisemitism in the Russian Empire|Jews in Udmurtia and Tatarstan|List of Jews born in the former Russian Empire}}\n[[File:Map showing percentage of Jews in the Pale of Settlement and Congress Poland, c. 1905.png|left|thumb|Map of the [[Pale of Settlement]], showing percentage of Jewish populations]]\nTheir situation changed radically, during the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]], when the [[Russian Empire]] acquired rule over large Lithuanian and Polish territories which historically included a high proportion of Jewish residents, especially during the second (1793) and the third (1795) [[Partitions of Poland]]. Under the Commonwealth's legal system, Jews endured economic restrictions euphemised as \"[[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]]\", which also continued following the Russian occupation. Catherine established the [[Pale of Settlement]], which included [[Congress Poland]], Lithuania, Ukraine, and the [[Crimea]] (the latter was later excluded). Jewish people were restricted to residence within the Pale and were required to obtain special permission to immigrate into other parts of Russia. Within the Pale, the Jewish residents were given right of voting in municipal elections, but their vote was limited to one third of the total number of voters, even though their proportion in many areas was much higher, even a majority.  This served to provide an aura of democracy, while institutionalizing conflict amongst ethnic groups on a local level.\n\nJewish communities in Russia were governed internally by local administrative bodies, called the Councils of Elders (''[[Qahal]]'', ''[[Kehilla (modern)|Kehilla]]''), constituted in every town or hamlet possessing a Jewish population. The Councils of Elders had jurisdiction over Jews in matters of internal litigation, as well as fiscal transactions relating to the collection and payment of taxes ([[Tax per head|poll tax]], [[land tax]], etc.). Later, this right of collecting taxes was much abused; in 1844 the civil authority of the Councils of Elders over its Jewish population was abolished.<ref name=\"ArchivesResearch1998\">{{cite book|editor1=Fruma Mohrer|editor2=Marek Web|title=Guide to the YIVO Archives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5DuagGR8RNsC&pg=PA298|accessdate=February 12, 2017|year=1998|publisher=M.E.

Each year, the Jewish community had to supply four recruits per thousand of the population. However, in practice, Jewish children were often conscripted as young as eight or nine years old.<ref>The World of Hasidism: H. Rabinowicz, 1970, p. 132, Hartmore House, London {{ISBN|0-87677-005-7}}</ref> At the age of twelve, they would be placed for their six-year military education in cantonist schools. They were then required to serve in the Imperial Russian army for 25 years after the completion of their studies, often never seeing their families again. Strict quotas were imposed on all communities and the ''qahals'' were given the unpleasant task of implementing conscription within the Jewish communities. Since the merchant-[[guild]] members, agricultural colonists, factory mechanics, clergy, and all Jews with secondary education were exempt, and the wealthy [[bribe]]d their way out of having their children conscripted, fewer potential conscripts were available; the adopted policy deeply sharpened internal Jewish social tensions. Seeking to protect the socio-economic and religious integrity of Jewish society, the ''qahals'' did their best to include \u201cnon-useful Jews\u201d in the draft lists so that the heads of tax-paying middle-class families were predominantly exempt from conscription, whereas single Jews, as well as \"heretics\" ([[Haskalah]] influenced individuals), paupers, outcasts, and orphaned children were drafted. They used their power to suppress protests and intimidate potential informers who sought to expose the arbitrariness of the ''qahal'' to the Russian government. In some cases, communal elders had the most threatening informers murdered (such as the [[Ushitsa case]], 1836)\n\nThe zoning rule was suspended during the [[Crimean war]], when conscription became annual. During this period the ''qahals'' leaders would employ informers and kidnappers (Russian: \"{{lang|ru|\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0447\u0438\u043a\u0438}}\", {{lang|ru-Latn|lovchiki}}, {{lang-yi|[[khapper]]s|script=Latn}}), as many potential conscripts preferred to run away rather than voluntarily submit. In the case of unfulfilled quotas, younger Jewish boys of eight and even younger were frequently taken. The official Russian policy was to encourage the [[religious conversion|conversion]] of Jewish cantonists to the [[state religion]] of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] and Jewish boys were coerced to [[baptism]]. As [[kosher]] food was unavailable, they were faced with the necessity of abandoning of [[kashrut|Jewish dietary laws]]. Polish [[Catholic]] boys were subject to similar pressure to convert and assimilate as the Russian Empire was hostile to Catholicism and Polish nationalism.\n\n=== Haskalah in the Russian Empire ===\n{{See also|Haskalah}}\nThe cultural and habitual isolation of the Jews gradually began eroding.

Disorders in the south once again recalled the government attention to the Jewish question. A conference was convened at the Ministry of Interior and on May 15, 1882, so-called ''Temporary Regulations'' were introduced that stayed in effect for more than thirty years and came to be known as the [[May Laws]].\n\n[[File:Jewish_languages_in_the_Russian_Empire_(1897).svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Distribution of Jewish languages (mostly [[Yiddish]]) in the Russian Empire, 1897]]\nThe repressive legislation was repeatedly revised.

In 1887, the [[Jewish quota|quota]]s placed on the number of Jews allowed into secondary and higher education were tightened down to 10% within the Pale, 5% outside the Pale, except Moscow and Saint Petersburg, held at 3%, even though the Jewish population was a majority or plurality in many communities. It was possible to evade this restrictions upon secondary education by combining private tuition with examination as an \"outside student\". Accordingly, within the Pale such outside pupils were almost entirely young Jews. The restrictions placed on education, traditionally highly valued in Jewish communities, resulted in ambition to excel over the peers and increased emigration rates. Special quotas restricted Jews from entering profession of law, limiting number of Jews admitted to the bar.\n\nIn 1886, an Edict of Expulsion was enforced on the historic Jewish population of [[Kiev]]. Most Jews were expelled from Moscow in 1891 (except few deemed [[useful Jew|useful]]) and a newly built synagogue was closed by the city's authorities headed by the Tsar's brother. Tsar Alexander III refused to curtail repressive practices and reportedly noted: \"But we must never forget that the Jews have crucified our Master and have shed his precious blood.\"<ref>''But Were They Good for the Jews?'' by Elliot Rosenberg, p. 183</ref>\n\nIn 1892, new measures banned Jewish participation in local elections despite their large numbers in many towns of the Pale.

The idea of overthrowing the Tsarist regime was attractive to many members of the Jewish [[intelligentsia]] because of the oppression of non-Russian nations and non-[[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Christians]] within the [[Russian Empire]]. For much the same reason, many non-Russians, notably [[Latvians]] or [[Poles]], were disproportionately represented in the party leaderships.\n\nIn 1897 [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|General Jewish Labour Bund]] (The Bund), was formed. Many Jews joined the ranks of two principal revolutionary parties: [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]] and [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]]\u2014both [[Bolshevik]] and [[Menshevik]] factions. A notable number of Bolshevik party members were ethnically Jewish, especially in the leadership of the party, and the percentage of Jewish party members among the rival Mensheviks was even higher. Both the founders and leaders of Menshevik faction, [[Julius Martov]] and [[Pavel Axelrod]], were Jewish.\n\nBecause some of the leading Bolsheviks were [[Ethnic Jews]], and [[Bolshevism]] supports a policy of promoting international proletarian revolution\u2014most notably in the case of [[Leon Trotsky]]\u2014many enemies of Bolshevism, as well as contemporary antisemites, draw a picture of Communism as a political slur at Jews and accuse Jews of pursuing Bolshevism to benefit Jewish interests, reflected in the terms [[Jewish Bolshevism]] or ''Judeo-Bolshevism''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The original [[atheist]]ic and internationalistic ideology of the Bolsheviks (''See [[proletarian internationalism]], [[bourgeois nationalism]]'') was incompatible with Jewish traditionalism. Bolsheviks such as Trotsky echoed sentiments dismissing Jewish heritage in place of \"internationalism\".\n\nSoon after seizing power, the Bolsheviks established the [[Yevsektsiya]], the Jewish section of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist party]] in order to destroy the rival Bund and [[Zionism|Zionist]] parties, suppress [[Judaism]] and replace traditional Jewish culture with \"proletarian culture\".<ref>Gitelman, Zvi \"Jewish Nationality and Soviet Politics: The Jewish Sections of the CPSU\", Princeton, 1972</ref>\n[[File:1912 genrich jagoda kartei orchrana.jpg|thumb|left|[[Genrikh Grigoryevich Yagoda]] on police information card from 1912]]\nIn March 1919, [[Vladimir Lenin]] delivered a speech \"On Anti-Jewish Pogroms\"<ref>Lenin's March 1919 speech ''On Anti-Jewish Pogroms'' (\"\u041e \u043f\u043e\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0442\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435 \u0435\u0432\u0440\u0435\u0435\u0432\": [[s:Anti-Jewish Pogroms|text]], {{audio|Lenin - Anti-Jewish Pogroms.ogg|audio}})</ref> on a [[gramophone record|gramophone]] disc. Lenin sought to explain the phenomenon of antisemitism in [[Marxist]] terms. According to Lenin, antisemitism was an \"attempt to divert the hatred of the workers and peasants from the exploiters toward the Jews\". Linking antisemitism to class struggle, he argued that it was merely a political technique used by the tsar to exploit religious fanaticism, popularize the despotic, unpopular regime, and divert popular anger toward a scapegoat. The Soviet Union also officially maintained this Marxist-Leninist interpretation under [[Joseph Stalin]], who expounded Lenin's critique of antisemitism. However, this did not prevent the widely publicized repressions of Jewish intellectuals during 1948\u20131953 when Stalin increasingly associated Jews with \"cosmopolitanism\" and pro-Americanism.\n\nJews were prominent in the Russian [[Constitutional Democrat Party]], [[Russian Social Democratic Party]] ([[Mensheviks]]) and [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]]. The Russian Anarchist movement also included many prominent Jewish revolutionaries. In Ukraine, [[Makhnovist]] anarchist leaders also included several Jews.<ref>\"The Makhnovists on The National and Jewish Questions\", History of The Makhnovist Movement by Peter Arshinov, Freedom Press</ref>\n\nThe attempts of the socialist Bund to be the sole representative of the Jewish worker in Russia had always conflicted with Lenin's idea of a universal coalition of workers of all nationalities. Like some other socialist parties in Russia, the Bund was initially opposed to the Bolsheviks' seizing of power in 1917 and to the dissolution of the [[Russian Constituent Assembly]]. Consequently, the Bund suffered repressions in the first months of the Soviet regime.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} However, the antisemitism of many Whites during the [[Russian Civil War]] caused many if not most Bund members to readily join the Bolsheviks, and most of the factions eventually merged with the Communist Party. The movement did split in three; the Bundist identity survived in interwar [[Poland]], while many Bundists joined the Mensheviks.\n\n=== Dissolution and seizure of Jewish properties and institutions ===\n[[File:S Sinagoga.jpg|thumb|Samara Choral Synagogue, in [[Samara, Russia]]. It was shut down by the Soviet Government in 1929.]]\n\nIn August 1919 Jewish properties, including synagogues, were seized and many Jewish communities were dissolved. The anti-religious laws against all expressions of religion and religious education were imposed upon the Jewish population, just like on other religious groups. Many Rabbis and other religious officials were forced to resign from their posts under the threat of violent persecution. This type of persecution continued on into the 1920s.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n  |title=Russia\n  | encyclopedia =Encyclopaedia Judaica\n  |volume=17\n  |pages=531\u2013553\n  |publisher=Keter Publishing House Ltd.\n  |id=\n  }}</ref>\n\nIn 1921, a large number of Jews opted for Poland, as they were entitled by [[Peace of Riga|peace treaty in Riga]] to choose the country they preferred.

Opposition to the pogroms and to manifestations of Russian antisemitism in this era were complicated by both the official Bolshevik policy of assimilationism towards all national and religious minorities, and concerns about overemphasizing Jewish concerns for fear of exacerbating popular antisemitism, as the White forces were openly identifying the Bolshevik regime with Jews.<ref>Benjamin Pinkus.

While Lenin remained opposed to outward forms of [[antisemitism]] (and all forms of racism), allowing Jewish people to rise to the highest offices in both party and state, certain historians such as [[Dmitri Volkogonov]] argue that the record of his government in this regard was highly uneven. A former official Soviet historian (turned staunch anti-communist), Volkogonov claims that Lenin was aware of pogroms carried out by units of the Red Army during the war with Poland, particularly those carried out by Semyon [[Budyonny]]'s troops,<ref>[[Evan Mawdsley]], ''The Russian Civil War''</ref> though the whole issue was effectively ignored.

In any event, there was still a fair degree of tolerance for Jewish religious practice in the 1920s: in the Belarusian capital Minsk, for example, of the 657 synagogues existing in 1917, 547 were still functioning in 1930.<ref>Elissa Bemporad, ''Becoming Soviet Jews: The Bolshevik Experiment in Minsk'', Indiana University Press, 2013, p. 119</ref>\n\n[[File:1930 Jewish kolkhoz AJJDC 05.jpg|left|thumb|Threshing in the fields in a Jewish kolkhoz.

Because most non-Jewish capitalists had fled during the civil war, Jews played a disproportionate role among the 'Nepmen' who constituted the private sector in the 1920s. From the 1930s, however, Soviet laws offered hardly any economic independence to artisans, and none whatever to traders. For many Jewish artisans and tradesmen, Soviet policies led to loss of their property and trade.\n[[File:BORIS BESIDE THE BALTIC AT MEREKULE, 1910 by L.Pasternak.jpg|thumb|[[Boris Pasternak]], was famously spared during the Great Purge by Stalin with the phrase: \"Let this cloud dweller be!\".<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 133.</ref>]]\nAccording to the [[First All-Union Census of the Soviet Union|census of 1926]], the total number of Jews in the USSR was 2,672,398\u2014of whom 59% lived in [[Ukrainian SSR]], 15.2% in [[Byelorussian SSR]], 22% in [[Russian SFSR]] and 3.8% in other Soviet republics.\n\n[[File:Radek's action.jpg|thumb|Prosecutor General [[Andrey Vyshinsky|Vyshinsky]] (centre), reading the 1937 indictment against [[Karl Radek]] during the 2nd [[Moscow Trials|Moscow Trial]].]]\n\nRussian Jews were long considered to be a non-native [[Semitic people|Semitic]] ethnic group among the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] Russians, and such categorization was solidified when ethnic minorities in the [[Soviet Union]] were categorized according to ethnicity ({{lang|ru|\u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c}}).

The use of Yiddish was strongly encouraged in the 1920s in areas of the USSR with substantial Jewish populations, especially in the Ukrainian and Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republics. Yiddish was one of the Belarusian SSR's four official languages, alongside Belarusian, Russian, and Polish. The equality of the official languages was taken seriously. A visitor arriving at main train station of the Belarusian capital Minsk saw the city's name written in all four languages above the main station entrance. Yiddish was a language of newspapers, magazines, book publishing, theater, radio, film, the post office, official correspondence, election materials, and even a Central Jewish Court. Yiddish writers like Sholem Aleichem and Mendele Mocher Seforim were celebrated in the 1920s as Soviet Jewish heroes.\n\nMinsk had a public, state-supported Yiddish-language school system, extending from kindergarten to the Yiddish-language section of the Belarusian State University. Although Jewish students tended to switch to studying in Russian as they moved on to secondary and higher education, 55.3 percent of the city's Jewish primary school students attended Yiddish-language schools in 1927.<ref>Elissa Bemporad,  ''Becoming Soviet Jews: The Bolshevik Experiment in Minsk'', Indiana University Press, 2013, p. 110</ref> At its peak, the Soviet Yiddish-language school system had 160,000 students in it.<ref name=\"bh.org.il\">{{cite web |title=The Jews of the Soviet Union |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/soviet-union |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot |accessdate=25 June 2018}}</ref> Such was the prestige of Minsk's Yiddish scholarship that researchers trained in Warsaw and Berlin applied for faculty positions at the university.

Because there were few Jewish Bolsheviks before 1917 (with a few prominent exceptions like [[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]] and [[Kamenev]]), the Yevsekstia's leaders in the 1920s were largely former Bundists, who pursued as Bolsheviks their campaign for secular Jewish education and culture. Although for example only a bit over 40 percent of Minsk's population was Jewish at the time, 19 of its 25 Communist Party cell secretaries were Jewish in 1924.<ref>Bemporad, op.cit., pp. 38, 40</ref> Jewish predominance in the party cells was such that several cell meetings were held in Yiddish. In fact, Yiddish was spoken at citywide party meetings in Minsk into the late 1930s.\n\n[[File:RussiaJewish2005.png|thumb|left|[[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]] on the map of Russia]]\n\nTo offset the growing Jewish national and religious aspirations of [[Zionism]] and to successfully categorize Soviet Jews under Stalin's definition of nationality, an alternative to the [[Land of Israel]] was established with the help of [[Komzet]] and [[OZET]] in 1928.

The experiment ground to a halt in the mid-1930s, during Stalin's first campaign of purges.\n\nIn fact the Bolshevik Party's Yiddish-language Yevsekstia was dissolved in 1930, as part of the regime's overall turn away from encouraging minority languages and cultures and towards Russification. Many Jewish leaders, especially those with Bundist backgrounds, were arrested and executed in the purges later in the 1930s, {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} and Yiddish schools were shut down. The Belasusian SSR shut down its entire network of Yiddish-language schools in 1938.\n\nIn his January 12, 1931, letter \"Antisemitism: Reply to an Inquiry of the Jewish News Agency in the United States\" (published domestically by ''[[Pravda]]'' in 1936), Stalin officially condemned antisemitism:\n<blockquote>In answer to your inquiry: National and racial chauvinism is a vestige of the misanthropic customs characteristic of the period of [[cannibalism]]. Antisemitism, as an extreme form of racial chauvinism, is the most dangerous vestige of cannibalism.\n Antisemitism is of advantage to the exploiters as a lightning conductor that deflects the blows aimed by the working people at capitalism. Antisemitism is dangerous for the working people as being a false path that leads them off the right road and lands them in the jungle. Hence Communists, as consistent internationalists, cannot but be irreconcilable, sworn enemies of antisemitism.\n In the U.S.S.R. antisemitism is punishable with the utmost severity of the law as a phenomenon deeply hostile to the Soviet system. Under U.S.S.R. law active antisemites are liable to the death penalty.<ref>Joseph Stalin.

According to the pact, Poland, the nation with the world's largest Jewish population, was divided between Germany and the Soviet Union in September 1939. While the pact had no basis in ideological sympathy (as evidenced by Nazi propaganda about \"[[Jewish Bolshevism]]\"), Germany's occupation of Western Poland was a disaster for Eastern European Jews.

A number of the most prominent victims of the Purges\u2014[[Trotsky]], [[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]], and [[Kamenev]], to name a few\u2014were Jewish, and in 1939 Stalin gave Molotov an explicit order to purge the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Jews, in anticipation of rapprochement with Nazi Germany.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nJews who escaped the purges include [[Lazar Kaganovich]], who came to Stalin's attention in the 1920s as a successful bureaucrat in [[Tashkent]] and participated in the purges of the 1930s. Kaganovich's loyalty endured even after Stalin's death, when he and Molotov were expelled from the party ranks in 1957 due to their opposition to [[History of the Soviet Union (1953\u20131985)|destalinization]].\n\nBeyond longstanding controversies, ranging from the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] to [[anti-Zionism]], the Soviet Union did grant official \"equality of all citizens regardless of status, sex, race, religion, and nationality\". The years before [[the Holocaust]] were an era of rapid change for Soviet Jews, leaving behind the dreadful poverty of the Pale of Settlement. Forty percent of the population in the former Pale left for large cities within the USSR.\n\nEmphasis on education and movement from countryside ''[[shtetl]]s'' to newly [[Industrialization in the USSR|industrialized cities]] allowed many Soviet Jews to enjoy overall advances under Stalin and to become one of the most educated population groups in the world.\n[[File:Yakov Kreizer.jpg|thumb|[[Yakov Kreizer]], field commander of the Red Army.]]\nBecause of Stalinist emphasis on its urban population, interwar migration inadvertently rescued countless Soviet Jews; [[Nazi Germany]] penetrated the entire former Jewish Pale\u2014but were kilometers short of [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] and Moscow.

A number of historians claim that the Doctors' Plot was intended as the opening of a campaign that would have resulted in the mass [[deportation]] of Soviet Jews had Stalin not died on March 5, 1953.

The world press began demanding answers from Soviet leaders, as well as inquiring about the current condition of the Jewish education system and culture. The same autumn, a group of leading Jewish world figures publicly requested the heads of Soviet state to clarify the situation. Since no cohesive answer was received, their concern was only heightened. The fate of Soviet Jews emerged as a major human rights issue in the West.\n\n=== The Soviet Union and Zionism ===\n{{Main|Soviet Union and the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|Soviet Anti-Zionism}}\n{{See also|Anti-Zionist committee of the Soviet public}}\nMarxist anti-nationalism{{Vague|date=June 2016}} and anti-clericalism had a mixed effect on Soviet Jews. Jews were the immediate benefactors, but long-term victims, of the Marxist notion that any manifestation of nationalism is \"socially retrogressive\". On one hand, Jews were liberated from the religious persecution of the Tsarist years of \"[[Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality]]\". On the other, this notion was threatening to Jewish cultural institutions, the Bund, [[Jewish Autonomism|Jewish autonomy]], Judaism and [[Zionism]].\n\nPolitical Zionism was officially stamped out for the entire history of the [[Soviet Union]] as a form of [[bourgeois nationalism]]. Although Leninism emphasizes \"self-determination\", this did not make the state more accepting of Zionism. Leninism defines self-determination by territory or culture, but not religion, which allowed Soviet minorities to have separate oblasts, autonomous regions, or republics, which were nonetheless symbolic until its later years. Jews, however, did not fit such a theoretical model; Jews in the Diaspora did not even have an agricultural base, as Stalin often asserted when attempting to deny the existence of a Jewish nation, and certainly no territorial unit. Marxian notions even denied a Jewish identity beyond religion and caste; Marx defined Jews as a \"chimerical nation\".\n\n[[File:Birobidjan mainsquare.jpg|thumb|A giant [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] dominating the main square in Birobidzhan, in the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]], founded in the Russian Far East in 1936]]\nLenin, claiming to be deeply committed to egalitarian ideals and universality of all humanity, rejected Zionism as a reactionary movement, \"bourgeois nationalism\", \"socially retrogressive\", and a backward force that deprecates class divisions among Jews. Moreover, [[Zionism]] entailed contact between Soviet citizens and westerners, which was dangerous in a closed society. Soviet authorities were likewise fearful of any mass-movement independent of [[monopoly|monopolistic]] Communist Party, and not tied to the state or the ideology of [[Marxism-Leninism]].\n\nWithout changing its official [[anti-Zionist]] stance, from late 1944 until 1948 [[Joseph Stalin]] had adopted a ''de facto'' pro-Zionist foreign policy, apparently believing that the new country would be socialist and would speed the decline of British influence in the Middle East.<ref>''A History of the Jews'' by [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], London, 1987, p. 527</ref>\n\nIn a May 14, 1947 speech during the [[1947 UN Partition Plan|UN Partition Plan]] debate, published in ''[[Izvestiya]]'' two days later, the [[Permanent Representative of Russia to the United Nations|Soviet ambassador]] [[Andrei Gromyko]] announced:\n\n{{quote|As we know, the aspirations of a considerable part of the Jewish people are linked with the problem of Palestine and of its future administration.

In addition, the USSR allowed [[Czechoslovakia]] to continue supplying arms to the Jewish forces during the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], even though this conflict took place after the Soviet-supported [[Czechoslovak coup d'\u00e9tat of 1948]]. At the time the U.S. maintained an arms embargo on both sides in the conflict. See [[Arms shipments from Czechoslovakia to Israel 1947\u20131949]].\n\nBy the end of 1957 the USSR switched sides in the [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict]] and throughout the course of the [[Cold War]] unequivocally supported various Arab regimes against Israel. The official position of the Soviet Union and its satellite states and agencies was that Zionism was a tool used by the Jews and Americans for \"racist imperialism\".\n\n[[File:Russian birth certificate of Michael Lucas.JPG|thumb|right|A Soviet birth certificate from 1972 indicating the person's parents' [[ethnicity]] as \"Jew\".]]\n\nAs [[Israel]] was emerging as a close Western ally, the specter of [[Zionism]] raised fears of internal dissent and opposition. During the later parts of the Cold War, Soviet Jews were suspected of being possible traitors, Western sympathisers, or a security liability. The Communist leadership closed down various Jewish organizations and declared Zionism an ideological enemy. Synagogues were often placed under police surveillance, both openly and through the use of informers. {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}\n\nAs a result of the persecution, both state-sponsored and unofficial, antisemitism was ingrained in the society and remained for years: ordinary Soviet Jews often suffered hardships, epitomized by often not being allowed to enlist in universities, work in certain professions, or participate in government. However, it should be mentioned that this was not always the case and this kind of persecution varied depending on the region. Still many Jews felt compelled to hide their identities by changing their names.\n\nThe word \"Jew\" was also avoided in the media when criticising undertakings by [[Israel]], which the Soviets often accused of racism, chauvinism etc. Instead of ''Jew'', the word ''Israeli'' was used almost exclusively, so as to paint its harsh criticism not as antisemitism but anti-Zionism. More controversially, the Soviet media, when depicting political events, sometimes used the term 'fascism' to characterise Israeli nationalism (e.g. calling Jabotinsky a 'fascist', and claiming 'new fascist organisations were emerging in Israel in the 1970s' etc.).\n\n=== 1967\u20131985 ===\n{{Main|Aliyah#Aliyah from the Soviet Union and post-Soviet states}}\n[[File:Landau.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Lev Landau]], winner of the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physics for his theory of [[superfluidity]].

As increasing numbers of Soviet Jews applied to emigrate to Israel in the period following the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], many were [[Refusenik (Soviet Union)|formally refused permission]] to leave. A typical excuse given by the ''OVIR'' (\u041e\u0412\u0438\u0420), the [[MVD]] department responsible for the provisioning of [[exit visa]]s, was that persons who had been given access at some point in their careers to information vital to Soviet [[national security]] could not be allowed to leave the country.\n\nAfter the [[Dymshits\u2013Kuznetsov hijacking affair]] in 1970 and the crackdown that followed, strong international condemnations caused the Soviet authorities to increase the emigration [[Jewish quota|quota]].

This measure was possibly designed to combat the [[brain drain]] caused by the growing emigration of Soviet Jews and other members of the [[intelligentsia]] to the West. Although Jews now made up less than 1% of the population, some surveys have suggested that around one-third of the emigrating Jews had achieved some form of higher education.

At first, American policy treated Soviet Jews as refugees and allowed unlimited numbers to emigrate, but this policy eventually came to an end. As a result, more Jews began moving to Israel, as it was the only country willing to take them unconditionally.\n\nIn the 1980s, the liberal government of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] allowed unlimited Jewish emigration, and the Soviet Union itself collapsed in 1991. As a result, a mass emigration of Jews from the former Soviet Union took place. Since the 1970s, over 1.1&nbsp;million Russians of Jewish origin immigrated to Israel, of whom 100,000 emigrated to third countries such as the United States and Canada soon afterward and 240,000 were not considered Jewish under ''[[Halakha]]'', but were eligible under the [[Law of Return]] due to Jewish ancestry or marriage.

The [[Lubavitch|Lubavitcher Jewish Movement]] has been active in this sector, setting up synagogues and Jewish kindergartens in Russian cities with Jewish populations.

During the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]] in the 18th century, Jewish people were restricted to the [[Pale of Settlement]] within Russia, the territory where they could live or immigrate to. [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] escalated anti-Jewish policies. Beginning in the 1880s, waves of [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|anti-Jewish pogroms]] swept across different regions of the empire for several decades. More than two million Jews fled Russia between 1880 and 1920, mostly to the United States and what is today the State of Israel.\n\nThe [[Pale of Settlement]] took away many of the rights that the Jewish people of the late 17th century Russia were experiencing.

In 1495, [[Alexander the Jagiellonian]] expelled Jewish residents from [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], but reversed his decision in 1503.\n\nIn the ''[[shtetl]]s'' populated almost entirely by Jews, or in the middle-sized town where Jews constituted a significant part of population, Jewish communities traditionally ruled themselves according to [[halakha]], and were limited by the privileges granted them by local rulers. (See also [[Shtadlan]]). These Jews were not assimilated into the larger eastern European societies, and identified as an [[ethnic group]] with a unique set of religious beliefs and practices, as well as an ethnically-unique economic role.\n\n[[File:Shafirov.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Peter Shafirov]], vice-chancellor of Russia under [[Peter the Great]]]]\n\n== Tsardom of Russia ==\nDocumentary evidence as to the presence of Jews in [[Muscovy|Muscovite Russia]] is first found in the chronicles of 1471. The relatively small population of them were subject to discriminatory laws, but they do not appear to have been enforced at all times.  Jews residing in Russian and Ukrainian towns suffered numerous religious persecutions. Converted Jews occasionally rose to important positions in the Russian State, for example [[Peter Shafirov]], vice-chancellor under Peter the Great. Shafirov was born into a Jewish family of Polish origin. He had extraordinary knowledge of foreign languages and served as the chief translator in the Russian Foreign Office, subsequently he began to accompany Tsar Peter on his international travels. Following this, he was raised to the rank of vice-chancellor because of his many diplomatic talents and skills, but was later imprisoned, sentenced to death, and eventually banished.\n\n[[File:Schneur Zalman of Liadi.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]], founder of [[Chabad Lubavitch]], 1775]]\n\n==Russian Empire==\n{{See also|Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|Kishinev pogrom|Antisemitism in the Russian Empire|Jews in Udmurtia and Tatarstan|List of Jews born in the former Russian Empire}}\n[[File:Map showing percentage of Jews in the Pale of Settlement and Congress Poland, c. 1905.png|left|thumb|Map of the [[Pale of Settlement]], showing percentage of Jewish populations]]\nTheir situation changed radically, during the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]], when the [[Russian Empire]] acquired rule over large Lithuanian and Polish territories which historically included a high proportion of Jewish residents, especially during the second (1793) and the third (1795) [[Partitions of Poland]]. Under the Commonwealth's legal system, Jews endured economic restrictions euphemised as \"[[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]]\", which also continued following the Russian occupation. Catherine established the [[Pale of Settlement]], which included [[Congress Poland]], Lithuania, Ukraine, and the [[Crimea]] (the latter was later excluded). Jewish people were restricted to residence within the Pale and were required to obtain special permission to immigrate into other parts of Russia. Within the Pale, the Jewish residents were given right of voting in municipal elections, but their vote was limited to one third of the total number of voters, even though their proportion in many areas was much higher, even a majority.  This served to provide an aura of democracy, while institutionalizing conflict amongst ethnic groups on a local level.\n\nJewish communities in Russia were governed internally by local administrative bodies, called the Councils of Elders (''[[Qahal]]'', ''[[Kehilla (modern)|Kehilla]]''), constituted in every town or hamlet possessing a Jewish population. The Councils of Elders had jurisdiction over Jews in matters of internal litigation, as well as fiscal transactions relating to the collection and payment of taxes ([[Tax per head|poll tax]], [[land tax]], etc.). Later, this right of collecting taxes was much abused; in 1844 the civil authority of the Councils of Elders over its Jewish population was abolished.<ref name=\"ArchivesResearch1998\">{{cite book|editor1=Fruma Mohrer|editor2=Marek Web|title=Guide to the YIVO Archives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5DuagGR8RNsC&pg=PA298|accessdate=February 12, 2017|year=1998|publisher=M.E.

Each year, the Jewish community had to supply four recruits per thousand of the population. However, in practice, Jewish children were often conscripted as young as eight or nine years old.<ref>The World of Hasidism: H. Rabinowicz, 1970, p. 132, Hartmore House, London {{ISBN|0-87677-005-7}}</ref> At the age of twelve, they would be placed for their six-year military education in cantonist schools. They were then required to serve in the Imperial Russian army for 25 years after the completion of their studies, often never seeing their families again. Strict quotas were imposed on all communities and the ''qahals'' were given the unpleasant task of implementing conscription within the Jewish communities. Since the merchant-[[guild]] members, agricultural colonists, factory mechanics, clergy, and all Jews with secondary education were exempt, and the wealthy [[bribe]]d their way out of having their children conscripted, fewer potential conscripts were available; the adopted policy deeply sharpened internal Jewish social tensions. Seeking to protect the socio-economic and religious integrity of Jewish society, the ''qahals'' did their best to include \u201cnon-useful Jews\u201d in the draft lists so that the heads of tax-paying middle-class families were predominantly exempt from conscription, whereas single Jews, as well as \"heretics\" ([[Haskalah]] influenced individuals), paupers, outcasts, and orphaned children were drafted. They used their power to suppress protests and intimidate potential informers who sought to expose the arbitrariness of the ''qahal'' to the Russian government. In some cases, communal elders had the most threatening informers murdered (such as the [[Ushitsa case]], 1836)\n\nThe zoning rule was suspended during the [[Crimean war]], when conscription became annual. During this period the ''qahals'' leaders would employ informers and kidnappers (Russian: \"{{lang|ru|\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0447\u0438\u043a\u0438}}\", {{lang|ru-Latn|lovchiki}}, {{lang-yi|[[khapper]]s|script=Latn}}), as many potential conscripts preferred to run away rather than voluntarily submit. In the case of unfulfilled quotas, younger Jewish boys of eight and even younger were frequently taken. The official Russian policy was to encourage the [[religious conversion|conversion]] of Jewish cantonists to the [[state religion]] of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] and Jewish boys were coerced to [[baptism]]. As [[kosher]] food was unavailable, they were faced with the necessity of abandoning of [[kashrut|Jewish dietary laws]]. Polish [[Catholic]] boys were subject to similar pressure to convert and assimilate as the Russian Empire was hostile to Catholicism and Polish nationalism.\n\n=== Haskalah in the Russian Empire ===\n{{See also|Haskalah}}\nThe cultural and habitual isolation of the Jews gradually began eroding. An ever-increasing number of Jewish people adopted Russian language and customs. Russian education was spread among the Jewish population.

In the 1881 outbreak, there were pogroms in 166 Ukrainian towns, thousands of Jewish homes were destroyed, many families reduced to extremes of poverty;{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} large numbers of men, women, and children were injured and some killed. Disorders in the south once again recalled the government attention to the Jewish question. A conference was convened at the Ministry of Interior and on May 15, 1882, so-called ''Temporary Regulations'' were introduced that stayed in effect for more than thirty years and came to be known as the [[May Laws]].\n\n[[File:Jewish_languages_in_the_Russian_Empire_(1897).svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Distribution of Jewish languages (mostly [[Yiddish]]) in the Russian Empire, 1897]]\nThe repressive legislation was repeatedly revised. Many historians noted the concurrence of these state-enforced antisemitic policies with waves of pogroms<ref>{{cite| title= A History of Russia| first= Nicholas |last= Riasanovsky| authorlink= Nicholas Riasanovsky| page= 395}}</ref> that continued until 1884, with at least tacit government knowledge and in some cases policemen were seen inciting or joining the mob.\nThe systematic policy of discrimination banned Jewish people from rural areas and towns of fewer than ten thousand people, even within the Pale, assuring the slow death of many [[shtetl]]s. In 1887, the [[Jewish quota|quota]]s placed on the number of Jews allowed into secondary and higher education were tightened down to 10% within the Pale, 5% outside the Pale, except Moscow and Saint Petersburg, held at 3%, even though the Jewish population was a majority or plurality in many communities. It was possible to evade this restrictions upon secondary education by combining private tuition with examination as an \"outside student\". Accordingly, within the Pale such outside pupils were almost entirely young Jews. The restrictions placed on education, traditionally highly valued in Jewish communities, resulted in ambition to excel over the peers and increased emigration rates. Special quotas restricted Jews from entering profession of law, limiting number of Jews admitted to the bar.\n\nIn 1886, an Edict of Expulsion was enforced on the historic Jewish population of [[Kiev]]. Most Jews were expelled from Moscow in 1891 (except few deemed [[useful Jew|useful]]) and a newly built synagogue was closed by the city's authorities headed by the Tsar's brother. Tsar Alexander III refused to curtail repressive practices and reportedly noted: \"But we must never forget that the Jews have crucified our Master and have shed his precious blood.\"<ref>''But Were They Good for the Jews?'' by Elliot Rosenberg, p. 183</ref>\n\nIn 1892, new measures banned Jewish participation in local elections despite their large numbers in many towns of the Pale. The ''Town Regulations'' prohibited Jews from the right to elect or be elected to town [[Duma]]s. Only a small number of Jews were allowed to be members of a town Duma, through appointment by special committees.\n[[File:Ekaterinoslav1905.jpg|thumb|left|The victims of a 1905 pogrom in [[Dnipro|Yekaterinoslav]], in present-day Ukraine]]\n\nA larger wave of pogroms broke out in 1903\u201306, leaving an estimated 1,000 Jews dead, and between 7,000 and 8,000 wounded.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n[[File:Portrait of Ida Rubenstein1.jpg|thumb|[[Ida Rubinstein]], actress, dancer, and [[Belle \u00c9poque]] figure]]\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Russian Empire had not only the largest Jewish population in the world, but actually a majority of the world's Jews living within its borders.<ref>''[[The Pittsburgh Press]]'', October 25, 1915, p. 11</ref> In 1897, according to [[Russian Empire Census|Russian census of 1897]], the total Jewish population of Russia was 5,189,401 persons of both sexes (4.13% of total population).

The idea of overthrowing the Tsarist regime was attractive to many members of the Jewish [[intelligentsia]] because of the oppression of non-Russian nations and non-[[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Christians]] within the [[Russian Empire]]. For much the same reason, many non-Russians, notably [[Latvians]] or [[Poles]], were disproportionately represented in the party leaderships.\n\nIn 1897 [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|General Jewish Labour Bund]] (The Bund), was formed. Many Jews joined the ranks of two principal revolutionary parties: [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]] and [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]]\u2014both [[Bolshevik]] and [[Menshevik]] factions. A notable number of Bolshevik party members were ethnically Jewish, especially in the leadership of the party, and the percentage of Jewish party members among the rival Mensheviks was even higher. Both the founders and leaders of Menshevik faction, [[Julius Martov]] and [[Pavel Axelrod]], were Jewish.\n\nBecause some of the leading Bolsheviks were [[Ethnic Jews]], and [[Bolshevism]] supports a policy of promoting international proletarian revolution\u2014most notably in the case of [[Leon Trotsky]]\u2014many enemies of Bolshevism, as well as contemporary antisemites, draw a picture of Communism as a political slur at Jews and accuse Jews of pursuing Bolshevism to benefit Jewish interests, reflected in the terms [[Jewish Bolshevism]] or ''Judeo-Bolshevism''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The original [[atheist]]ic and internationalistic ideology of the Bolsheviks (''See [[proletarian internationalism]], [[bourgeois nationalism]]'') was incompatible with Jewish traditionalism. Bolsheviks such as Trotsky echoed sentiments dismissing Jewish heritage in place of \"internationalism\".\n\nSoon after seizing power, the Bolsheviks established the [[Yevsektsiya]], the Jewish section of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist party]] in order to destroy the rival Bund and [[Zionism|Zionist]] parties, suppress [[Judaism]] and replace traditional Jewish culture with \"proletarian culture\".<ref>Gitelman, Zvi \"Jewish Nationality and Soviet Politics: The Jewish Sections of the CPSU\", Princeton, 1972</ref>\n[[File:1912 genrich jagoda kartei orchrana.jpg|thumb|left|[[Genrikh Grigoryevich Yagoda]] on police information card from 1912]]\nIn March 1919, [[Vladimir Lenin]] delivered a speech \"On Anti-Jewish Pogroms\"<ref>Lenin's March 1919 speech ''On Anti-Jewish Pogroms'' (\"\u041e \u043f\u043e\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0442\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435 \u0435\u0432\u0440\u0435\u0435\u0432\": [[s:Anti-Jewish Pogroms|text]], {{audio|Lenin - Anti-Jewish Pogroms.ogg|audio}})</ref> on a [[gramophone record|gramophone]] disc. Lenin sought to explain the phenomenon of antisemitism in [[Marxist]] terms. According to Lenin, antisemitism was an \"attempt to divert the hatred of the workers and peasants from the exploiters toward the Jews\". Linking antisemitism to class struggle, he argued that it was merely a political technique used by the tsar to exploit religious fanaticism, popularize the despotic, unpopular regime, and divert popular anger toward a scapegoat. The Soviet Union also officially maintained this Marxist-Leninist interpretation under [[Joseph Stalin]], who expounded Lenin's critique of antisemitism. However, this did not prevent the widely publicized repressions of Jewish intellectuals during 1948\u20131953 when Stalin increasingly associated Jews with \"cosmopolitanism\" and pro-Americanism.\n\nJews were prominent in the Russian [[Constitutional Democrat Party]], [[Russian Social Democratic Party]] ([[Mensheviks]]) and [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]]. The Russian Anarchist movement also included many prominent Jewish revolutionaries. In Ukraine, [[Makhnovist]] anarchist leaders also included several Jews.<ref>\"The Makhnovists on The National and Jewish Questions\", History of The Makhnovist Movement by Peter Arshinov, Freedom Press</ref>\n\nThe attempts of the socialist Bund to be the sole representative of the Jewish worker in Russia had always conflicted with Lenin's idea of a universal coalition of workers of all nationalities. Like some other socialist parties in Russia, the Bund was initially opposed to the Bolsheviks' seizing of power in 1917 and to the dissolution of the [[Russian Constituent Assembly]]. Consequently, the Bund suffered repressions in the first months of the Soviet regime.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} However, the antisemitism of many Whites during the [[Russian Civil War]] caused many if not most Bund members to readily join the Bolsheviks, and most of the factions eventually merged with the Communist Party. The movement did split in three; the Bundist identity survived in interwar [[Poland]], while many Bundists joined the Mensheviks.\n\n=== Dissolution and seizure of Jewish properties and institutions ===\n[[File:S Sinagoga.jpg|thumb|Samara Choral Synagogue, in [[Samara, Russia]]. It was shut down by the Soviet Government in 1929.]]\n\nIn August 1919 Jewish properties, including synagogues, were seized and many Jewish communities were dissolved. The anti-religious laws against all expressions of religion and religious education were imposed upon the Jewish population, just like on other religious groups. Many Rabbis and other religious officials were forced to resign from their posts under the threat of violent persecution. This type of persecution continued on into the 1920s.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n  |title=Russia\n  | encyclopedia =Encyclopaedia Judaica\n  |volume=17\n  |pages=531\u2013553\n  |publisher=Keter Publishing House Ltd.\n  |id=\n  }}</ref>\n\nIn 1921, a large number of Jews opted for Poland, as they were entitled by [[Peace of Riga|peace treaty in Riga]] to choose the country they preferred.

Opposition to the pogroms and to manifestations of Russian antisemitism in this era were complicated by both the official Bolshevik policy of assimilationism towards all national and religious minorities, and concerns about overemphasizing Jewish concerns for fear of exacerbating popular antisemitism, as the White forces were openly identifying the Bolshevik regime with Jews.<ref>Benjamin Pinkus.

While Lenin remained opposed to outward forms of [[antisemitism]] (and all forms of racism), allowing Jewish people to rise to the highest offices in both party and state, certain historians such as [[Dmitri Volkogonov]] argue that the record of his government in this regard was highly uneven. A former official Soviet historian (turned staunch anti-communist), Volkogonov claims that Lenin was aware of pogroms carried out by units of the Red Army during the war with Poland, particularly those carried out by Semyon [[Budyonny]]'s troops,<ref>[[Evan Mawdsley]], ''The Russian Civil War''</ref> though the whole issue was effectively ignored.

In any event, there was still a fair degree of tolerance for Jewish religious practice in the 1920s: in the Belarusian capital Minsk, for example, of the 657 synagogues existing in 1917, 547 were still functioning in 1930.<ref>Elissa Bemporad, ''Becoming Soviet Jews: The Bolshevik Experiment in Minsk'', Indiana University Press, 2013, p. 119</ref>\n\n[[File:1930 Jewish kolkhoz AJJDC 05.jpg|left|thumb|Threshing in the fields in a Jewish kolkhoz.

Because most non-Jewish capitalists had fled during the civil war, Jews played a disproportionate role among the 'Nepmen' who constituted the private sector in the 1920s. From the 1930s, however, Soviet laws offered hardly any economic independence to artisans, and none whatever to traders. For many Jewish artisans and tradesmen, Soviet policies led to loss of their property and trade.\n[[File:BORIS BESIDE THE BALTIC AT MEREKULE, 1910 by L.Pasternak.jpg|thumb|[[Boris Pasternak]], was famously spared during the Great Purge by Stalin with the phrase: \"Let this cloud dweller be!\".<ref>Ivinskaya (1978) p 133.</ref>]]\nAccording to the [[First All-Union Census of the Soviet Union|census of 1926]], the total number of Jews in the USSR was 2,672,398\u2014of whom 59% lived in [[Ukrainian SSR]], 15.2% in [[Byelorussian SSR]], 22% in [[Russian SFSR]] and 3.8% in other Soviet republics.\n\n[[File:Radek's action.jpg|thumb|Prosecutor General [[Andrey Vyshinsky|Vyshinsky]] (centre), reading the 1937 indictment against [[Karl Radek]] during the 2nd [[Moscow Trials|Moscow Trial]].]]\n\nRussian Jews were long considered to be a non-native [[Semitic people|Semitic]] ethnic group among the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] Russians, and such categorization was solidified when ethnic minorities in the [[Soviet Union]] were categorized according to ethnicity ({{lang|ru|\u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c}}). In his 1913 theoretical work ''[[Marxism and the National Question]]'', Stalin described Jews as \"not a living and active nation, but something mystical, intangible and supernatural. For, I repeat, what sort of nation, for instance, is a Jewish nation which consists of Georgian, Daghestanian, Russian, American and other Jews, the members of which do not understand each other (since they speak different languages), inhabit different parts of the globe, will never see each other, and will never act together, whether in time of peace or in time of war?!\"<ref>Stalin, Joseph (1913): ''[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1913/03.htm Marxism and the National Question]''</ref> According to Stalin, who became the [[People's Commissar]] for Nationalities Affairs after the revolution, to qualify as a nation, a minority was required to have a culture, a language, and a homeland.\n\n[[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], rather than Hebrew, would be the [[national language]], and [[socialist realism|proletarian socialist literature and arts]] would replace Judaism as the quintessence of culture. The use of Yiddish was strongly encouraged in the 1920s in areas of the USSR with substantial Jewish populations, especially in the Ukrainian and Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republics. Yiddish was one of the Belarusian SSR's four official languages, alongside Belarusian, Russian, and Polish. The equality of the official languages was taken seriously. A visitor arriving at main train station of the Belarusian capital Minsk saw the city's name written in all four languages above the main station entrance. Yiddish was a language of newspapers, magazines, book publishing, theater, radio, film, the post office, official correspondence, election materials, and even a Central Jewish Court. Yiddish writers like Sholem Aleichem and Mendele Mocher Seforim were celebrated in the 1920s as Soviet Jewish heroes.\n\nMinsk had a public, state-supported Yiddish-language school system, extending from kindergarten to the Yiddish-language section of the Belarusian State University. Although Jewish students tended to switch to studying in Russian as they moved on to secondary and higher education, 55.3 percent of the city's Jewish primary school students attended Yiddish-language schools in 1927.<ref>Elissa Bemporad,  ''Becoming Soviet Jews: The Bolshevik Experiment in Minsk'', Indiana University Press, 2013, p. 110</ref> At its peak, the Soviet Yiddish-language school system had 160,000 students in it.<ref name=\"bh.org.il\">{{cite web |title=The Jews of the Soviet Union |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/soviet-union |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot |accessdate=25 June 2018}}</ref> Such was the prestige of Minsk's Yiddish scholarship that researchers trained in Warsaw and Berlin applied for faculty positions at the university.

Because there were few Jewish Bolsheviks before 1917 (with a few prominent exceptions like [[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]] and [[Kamenev]]), the Yevsekstia's leaders in the 1920s were largely former Bundists, who pursued as Bolsheviks their campaign for secular Jewish education and culture.

Many Jewish leaders, especially those with Bundist backgrounds, were arrested and executed in the purges later in the 1930s, {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} and Yiddish schools were shut down.

Antisemitism, as an extreme form of racial chauvinism, is the most dangerous vestige of cannibalism.\n Antisemitism is of advantage to the exploiters as a lightning conductor that deflects the blows aimed by the working people at capitalism. Antisemitism is dangerous for the working people as being a false path that leads them off the right road and lands them in the jungle. Hence Communists, as consistent internationalists, cannot but be irreconcilable, sworn enemies of antisemitism.\n In the U.S.S.R. antisemitism is punishable with the utmost severity of the law as a phenomenon deeply hostile to the Soviet system.

According to the pact, Poland, the nation with the world's largest Jewish population, was divided between Germany and the Soviet Union in September 1939. While the pact had no basis in ideological sympathy (as evidenced by Nazi propaganda about \"[[Jewish Bolshevism]]\"), Germany's occupation of Western Poland was a disaster for Eastern European Jews.

Kaganovich's loyalty endured even after Stalin's death, when he and Molotov were expelled from the party ranks in 1957 due to their opposition to [[History of the Soviet Union (1953\u20131985)|destalinization]].\n\nBeyond longstanding controversies, ranging from the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] to [[anti-Zionism]], the Soviet Union did grant official \"equality of all citizens regardless of status, sex, race, religion, and nationality\". The years before [[the Holocaust]] were an era of rapid change for Soviet Jews, leaving behind the dreadful poverty of the Pale of Settlement. Forty percent of the population in the former Pale left for large cities within the USSR.\n\nEmphasis on education and movement from countryside ''[[shtetl]]s'' to newly [[Industrialization in the USSR|industrialized cities]] allowed many Soviet Jews to enjoy overall advances under Stalin and to become one of the most educated population groups in the world.\n[[File:Yakov Kreizer.jpg|thumb|[[Yakov Kreizer]], field commander of the Red Army.]]\nBecause of Stalinist emphasis on its urban population, interwar migration inadvertently rescued countless Soviet Jews; [[Nazi Germany]] penetrated the entire former Jewish Pale\u2014but were kilometers short of [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] and Moscow.

A number of historians claim that the Doctors' Plot was intended as the opening of a campaign that would have resulted in the mass [[deportation]] of Soviet Jews had Stalin not died on March 5, 1953.

The world press began demanding answers from Soviet leaders, as well as inquiring about the current condition of the Jewish education system and culture. The same autumn, a group of leading Jewish world figures publicly requested the heads of Soviet state to clarify the situation. Since no cohesive answer was received, their concern was only heightened. The fate of Soviet Jews emerged as a major human rights issue in the West.\n\n=== The Soviet Union and Zionism ===\n{{Main|Soviet Union and the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|Soviet Anti-Zionism}}\n{{See also|Anti-Zionist committee of the Soviet public}}\nMarxist anti-nationalism{{Vague|date=June 2016}} and anti-clericalism had a mixed effect on Soviet Jews. Jews were the immediate benefactors, but long-term victims, of the Marxist notion that any manifestation of nationalism is \"socially retrogressive\". On one hand, Jews were liberated from the religious persecution of the Tsarist years of \"[[Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality]]\". On the other, this notion was threatening to Jewish cultural institutions, the Bund, [[Jewish Autonomism|Jewish autonomy]], Judaism and [[Zionism]].\n\nPolitical Zionism was officially stamped out for the entire history of the [[Soviet Union]] as a form of [[bourgeois nationalism]]. Although Leninism emphasizes \"self-determination\", this did not make the state more accepting of Zionism. Leninism defines self-determination by territory or culture, but not religion, which allowed Soviet minorities to have separate oblasts, autonomous regions, or republics, which were nonetheless symbolic until its later years. Jews, however, did not fit such a theoretical model; Jews in the Diaspora did not even have an agricultural base, as Stalin often asserted when attempting to deny the existence of a Jewish nation, and certainly no territorial unit. Marxian notions even denied a Jewish identity beyond religion and caste; Marx defined Jews as a \"chimerical nation\".\n\n[[File:Birobidjan mainsquare.jpg|thumb|A giant [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] dominating the main square in Birobidzhan, in the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]], founded in the Russian Far East in 1936]]\nLenin, claiming to be deeply committed to egalitarian ideals and universality of all humanity, rejected Zionism as a reactionary movement, \"bourgeois nationalism\", \"socially retrogressive\", and a backward force that deprecates class divisions among Jews. Moreover, [[Zionism]] entailed contact between Soviet citizens and westerners, which was dangerous in a closed society. Soviet authorities were likewise fearful of any mass-movement independent of [[monopoly|monopolistic]] Communist Party, and not tied to the state or the ideology of [[Marxism-Leninism]].\n\nWithout changing its official [[anti-Zionist]] stance, from late 1944 until 1948 [[Joseph Stalin]] had adopted a ''de facto'' pro-Zionist foreign policy, apparently believing that the new country would be socialist and would speed the decline of British influence in the Middle East.<ref>''A History of the Jews'' by [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], London, 1987, p. 527</ref>\n\nIn a May 14, 1947 speech during the [[1947 UN Partition Plan|UN Partition Plan]] debate, published in ''[[Izvestiya]]'' two days later, the [[Permanent Representative of Russia to the United Nations|Soviet ambassador]] [[Andrei Gromyko]] announced:\n\n{{quote|As we know, the aspirations of a considerable part of the Jewish people are linked with the problem of Palestine and of its future administration.

In addition, the USSR allowed [[Czechoslovakia]] to continue supplying arms to the Jewish forces during the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], even though this conflict took place after the Soviet-supported [[Czechoslovak coup d'\u00e9tat of 1948]]. At the time the U.S. maintained an arms embargo on both sides in the conflict. See [[Arms shipments from Czechoslovakia to Israel 1947\u20131949]].\n\nBy the end of 1957 the USSR switched sides in the [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict]] and throughout the course of the [[Cold War]] unequivocally supported various Arab regimes against Israel. The official position of the Soviet Union and its satellite states and agencies was that Zionism was a tool used by the Jews and Americans for \"racist imperialism\".\n\n[[File:Russian birth certificate of Michael Lucas.JPG|thumb|right|A Soviet birth certificate from 1972 indicating the person's parents' [[ethnicity]] as \"Jew\".]]\n\nAs [[Israel]] was emerging as a close Western ally, the specter of [[Zionism]] raised fears of internal dissent and opposition. During the later parts of the Cold War, Soviet Jews were suspected of being possible traitors, Western sympathisers, or a security liability. The Communist leadership closed down various Jewish organizations and declared Zionism an ideological enemy. Synagogues were often placed under police surveillance, both openly and through the use of informers. {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}\n\nAs a result of the persecution, both state-sponsored and unofficial, antisemitism was ingrained in the society and remained for years: ordinary Soviet Jews often suffered hardships, epitomized by often not being allowed to enlist in universities, work in certain professions, or participate in government. However, it should be mentioned that this was not always the case and this kind of persecution varied depending on the region. Still many Jews felt compelled to hide their identities by changing their names.\n\nThe word \"Jew\" was also avoided in the media when criticising undertakings by [[Israel]], which the Soviets often accused of racism, chauvinism etc. Instead of ''Jew'', the word ''Israeli'' was used almost exclusively, so as to paint its harsh criticism not as antisemitism but anti-Zionism. More controversially, the Soviet media, when depicting political events, sometimes used the term 'fascism' to characterise Israeli nationalism (e.g. calling Jabotinsky a 'fascist', and claiming 'new fascist organisations were emerging in Israel in the 1970s' etc.).\n\n=== 1967\u20131985 ===\n{{Main|Aliyah#Aliyah from the Soviet Union and post-Soviet states}}\n[[File:Landau.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Lev Landau]], winner of the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physics for his theory of [[superfluidity]].

As increasing numbers of Soviet Jews applied to emigrate to Israel in the period following the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], many were [[Refusenik (Soviet Union)|formally refused permission]] to leave. A typical excuse given by the ''OVIR'' (\u041e\u0412\u0438\u0420), the [[MVD]] department responsible for the provisioning of [[exit visa]]s, was that persons who had been given access at some point in their careers to information vital to Soviet [[national security]] could not be allowed to leave the country.\n\nAfter the [[Dymshits\u2013Kuznetsov hijacking affair]] in 1970 and the crackdown that followed, strong international condemnations caused the Soviet authorities to increase the emigration [[Jewish quota|quota]].

This measure was possibly designed to combat the [[brain drain]] caused by the growing emigration of Soviet Jews and other members of the [[intelligentsia]] to the West. Although Jews now made up less than 1% of the population, some surveys have suggested that around one-third of the emigrating Jews had achieved some form of higher education.

At first, American policy treated Soviet Jews as refugees and allowed unlimited numbers to emigrate, but this policy eventually came to an end. As a result, more Jews began moving to Israel, as it was the only country willing to take them unconditionally.\n\nIn the 1980s, the liberal government of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] allowed unlimited Jewish emigration, and the Soviet Union itself collapsed in 1991. As a result, a mass emigration of Jews from the former Soviet Union took place. Since the 1970s, over 1.1&nbsp;million Russians of Jewish origin immigrated to Israel, of whom 100,000 emigrated to third countries such as the United States and Canada soon afterward and 240,000 were not considered Jewish under ''[[Halakha]]'', but were eligible under the [[Law of Return]] due to Jewish ancestry or marriage.

The [[Lubavitch|Lubavitcher Jewish Movement]] has been active in this sector, setting up synagogues and Jewish kindergartens in Russian cities with Jewish populations.
