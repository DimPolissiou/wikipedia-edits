Focusing Section.jpg|thumb|Final stage of the proton beam line before target to generate neutrino beam]]\nT2K uses a muon neutrino or muon antineutrino [[accelerator neutrino|beam]] produced at the [[J-PARC]] facility using a proton beam gradually accelerated to 30 GeV by a system of three [[particle accelerator|accelerators]]: first to 400 MeV energy by the Linac linear accelerator, then up to 3 GeV by the RCS (Rapid Cycle Synchrotron), and finally up to 30 GeV by the MR [[synchrotron]] (Main Ring). [[Proton]]s collide with a [[graphite]] target, producing [[meson]]s, mainly [[pion]]s and [[kaon]]s, which are then focused by a set of three [[magnetic horn]]s and directed into a tunnel called the decay volume. Depending on the horns polarity, either positive or negative particles are focused. Positive pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon+}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}}, forming a muon neutrino beam, while negative pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon-}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon antineutrino}}, forming a muon antineutrino beam. All remaining [[hadron]]s and charged [[lepton]]s are stopped by a 75-ton block of graphite (so-called beam dump) and in the ground, while neutrinos travel underground towards the far detector.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===Off-axis beam===\n\nT2K is the first experiment in which the concept of off-axis [[accelerator neutrino|neutrino beam]] was realized. The neutrino beam at J-PARC is designed so that it can be directed 2 to 3 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] away from the [[Super-Kamiokande]] far detector and one of the near detectors, ND280. The off-axis angle was chosen to 2.5\u00b0 to maximize the probability of oscillation at a distance corresponding to the far detector, which for 295&nbsp;km is maximal for around 600&nbsp;MeV neutrinos. In this neutrino energy range, the dominant type of neutrino interactions are charged current quasielastic interactions, for which it is possible to reconstruct the energy of the interacting neutrino only on the basis of the momentum and direction of the produced charged lepton. The higher neutrino energies are suppressed by the off-axis configuration, decreasing the number of interactions with meson production, which are background in the oscillation analysis in the T2K experiment.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref name=\"t2kflux\">{{cite journal |author=T2K Collaboration |title=T2K neutrino flux prediction |journal=Physical Review D |date=2 January 2013 |volume=87 |issue=1 |doi=10.1103/physrevd.87.012001|arxiv=1211.0469}}</ref>\n\n==Near detectors==\n\nThe near detector complex is located at a distance of 280 meters from the graphite target. Its purpose is to measure the neutrino flux before oscillations and to study neutrino interactions. The system consists of three main detectors:\n* INGRID detector (Interactive Neutrino GRID) located on the axis of the neutrino beam,\n* ND280 detector located 2.5\u00b0 away from the beam axis, i.e. at the same angle as the far detector.\n* Wagasci-BabyMIND is a magnetised neutrino detector located at 1.5\u00b0 off-axis angle, built to explore the energy spectrum variation with the off-axis angle and cross-sections at higher average neutrino energy.\n\n===Signal readout===\n\nExcept for the Time Projection Chambers in ND280, the entire active material (enabling particle tracking) of the near detectors is plastic scintillator. The light produced by traversing particles in the plastic [[scintillator]] bars and planes is collected by wavelength-shifting fibres and detected by Hamamatsu Multi-pixel photon counters installed/located at one or both ends of the fibres. Scintillator bars are organised into layers, where bars in two neighbouring layers are perpendicular to each other providing together 3D information about traversing particles.\n\n===INGRID detector===\n\nThe main purpose of the INGRID detector is the monitoring of the direction and intensity of the beam on a daily basis by direct detection of neutrino interactions. The INGRID detector consists of 16 identical modules arranged in the shape of a cross, 7 in a vertical and 7 in a horizontal arm, plus 2 modules outside the cross. Height and width of the arms are 10 meters. A single module consists of alternating layers of iron and a plastic scintillator. An additional 4 veto layers of the scintillator surround the module on the sides to distinguish particles entering from the outside from those produced by interactions inside the module. The total mass of iron in one module is 7.1 tons and constitutes 96% of the module weight. On the neutrino beam axis, in the middle of the cross between the vertical and horizontal arm, there is an additional module built only from layers of the plastic scintillator (Proton Module) with a mass of 0.55 tons. Its purpose is to register quasielastic interactions and compare the obtained results with the simulations.\n\n===ND280 detector===\n\n[[File:J-PARC T2K ND280 Pit.jpg|thumb|ND280 under construction]]\nThe ND280 detector is used to measure the flux, energy spectrum and electron neutrino beam pollution for the same off-axis angle as for the far detector. ND280 also investigates various types of muon and electron neutrino and antineutrino interactions. All this allows estimating the expected number and type of interactions in the far detector, reducing the systematic error in the neutrino oscillations analysis associated with models of neutrino interactions and flux.\n\nND280 is composed of the set of inner sub-detectors: Pi-Zero detector and a tracker with 2 Fine-Grained Detectors interleaved with 3 Time Projection Chambers, placed inside of a metal frame called a basket. The basket is surrounded by the electromagnetic calorimeter and a magnet recycled from the [[UA1 experiment]] producing 0.2 T uniform horizontal field and instrumented with scintillator planes constituting the Side Muon Range Detector.\n\n====Pi Zero detector====\n\nThe Pi-Zero ({{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}) Detector (P0D) contains 40 plastic scintillator module planes, which in the central part are interleaved with 2.8 cm thick bags fillable of water and thick brass sheets, and in two peripheral regions scintillator modules are sandwiched with lead sheets. By comparison of the amount of interaction between modes with and without water in the bags, it is possible to extract the number of neutrino interactions occurring on the water - the target material inside the far detector Super-Kamiokande.\nThe size of the entire active P0D volume is around 2.1 m \u00d7 2.2 m \u00d7 2.4 m (X\u00d7Y\u00d7Z) and its mass with and without water is 15.8 and 12.9 tons respectively.\n\nThe main goal of the Pi-Zero Detector is measurement neutral [[pion]]s production in [[neutral current]] neutrino interactions on water:\n: {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N \u2192 {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N\u2019 + {{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}\nThis reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions because photons from pi0 decay can be mis-reconstructed as an electron in the Super-Kamiokande detector, thus this reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions and constitute an important background in electron neutrino appearance measurement.\n<ref>{{cite journal |author=S.

TPCs are filled with argon-based drift gas under atmospheric pressure. Charged particles crossing TPC ionise the gas along their track. The ionisation electrons drift from the cathode to the sides of the TPC, where they are detected by the MicroMegas providing a 3D image of a path of the traversing charged particle. Y and Z coordinates are based on the position of the detected ionisation electrons on the MicroMegas modules, and X coordinate is based on the electrons drift time. In the magnetic field, the curvature of this path allows to determine [[electric charge|charge]] and [[momentum]] of the particle, and the amount of the ionisation electrons per unit distance is used to identify particles based on the [[Bethe formula|Bethe-Bloch formula]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=T2K ND280 TPC collaboration |title=Time projection chambers for the T2K near detectors |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment |date=May 2011 |volume=637 |issue=1 |pages=25\u201346 |doi=10.1016/j.nima.2011.02.036|arxiv=1012.0865}}</ref>\n\n====Fine-grained detectors====\n\nTwo fine-grained detectors (FGDs) are placed after the first and second TPCs. Together the FGDs and TPCs make up the tracker of ND280. The FGDs provide the active target mass for the neutrino interactions and are able to measure the short tracks of proton recoil. The first FGD is composed of scintillator layers only, while the second FGD is composed of alternating layers of scintillator and water. The second FGD is partially composed of water because the detector at Super-Kamiokande is water-based. Cross sections on carbon and on the water can be determined from a comparison of neutrino interactions in the two FGDs.\n\n====Electromagnetic Calorimeter====\n\nThe Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) surrounds the inner detectors (P0D, TPCs, FGDs) and consists of scintillator layers sandwiched with lead absorber sheets. Its role is to detect neutral particles, especially photons, and measure their energy and direction, as well as to detect charged particles providing additional information relevant for their identification.\n\n====Side Muon Range Detector====\n\nThe Side Muon Range Detector (SMRD) consists of scintillator modules which are inserted into the gaps in the magnet. The SMRD records muons escaping the inner parts of the detector at large angles with respect to the beam direction. It can also act as a trigger for [[cosmic rays]]. Finally, it can help identify beam interactions in the surrounding walls and in the magnet itself.\n\n==Super-Kamiokande==\n{{main|Super-Kamiokande}}\n\nSuper-Kamiokande detector is located 1000 m underground in the Mozumi Mine, under Mount Ikeno in the Kamoka area of Hida city. It is a [[stainless steel]] [[cylinder|cylindrical]] tank of about 40 m height and diameter, filled with 50,000 tons of [[water]] and instrumented with around 13,000 [[photomultiplier]] tubes (PMT). It detects a [[cone]] of [[Cherenkov radiation|Cherenkov light]] emitted by charged particles moving in water faster than light in this medium.\nIts goal is to measure [[muon]]s and [[electron]]s produced in [[charged current]] quasielastic interactions (CCQE) of {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}, respectively. Due to relatively large mass, muons usually do not change their direction and thus produce a well-defined cone of Cherenkov light observed by PMTs as a clear, sharp ring. In contrast, electrons, because of smaller mass, are more susceptible to scattering and almost always produce electromagnetic [[particle shower|showers]], observed by PMTs as a ring with fuzzy edges. Neutrino energy is calculated based on the direction and energy of a charged [[lepton]] produced in the CCQE interaction. In this way, {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}} spectra are determined, leading to the measurement of the [[neutrino oscillation|oscillation]] parameters relevant for muon neutrino disappearance and electron neutrino appearance.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nT2K is a successor of the KEK to Kamioka ([[K2K experiment|K2K]]) experiment, which ran from 1999 till 2004. In the [[K2K experiment]], an [[accelerator neutrino|accelerator beam]] of muon neutrinos was produced at [[KEK]] facility in [[Tsukuba, Ibaraki|Tsukuba]] ([[Japan]]) and sent towards the [[Super-Kamiokande]] detector, located 250 km away. The K2K experiment results confirmed at the level of at 99.9985% confidence (4.3 [[Standard deviation|\u03c3]]) the [[neutrino oscillation|disappearance]] of the [[muon neutrino]]s and were consistent with the previous measurements of oscillation parameters measured by the Super-Kamiokande detector for [[atmospheric neutrino]]s. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Oyama |first1=Yuichi |title=Results from K2K and status of T2K |journal=arXiv:hep-ex/0512041 |date=2006 |pages=113\u2013124 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-4965-1_9 |arxiv=hep-ex/0512041}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=K2K Collaboration |title=Measurement of neutrino oscillation by the K2K experiment |journal=Physical Review D |date=12 October 2006 |volume=74 |issue=7 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.74.072003|arxiv=hep-ex/0606032}}</ref>\n\nThe construction of the neutrino beamline started in 2004 and it was successfully commissioned in 2009.

Focusing Section.jpg|thumb|Final stage of the proton beam line before target to generate neutrino beam]]\nT2K uses a muon neutrino or muon antineutrino [[accelerator neutrino|beam]] produced at the [[J-PARC]] facility using a proton beam gradually accelerated to 30 GeV by a system of three [[particle accelerator|accelerators]]: first to 400 MeV energy by the Linac linear accelerator, then up to 3 GeV by the RCS (Rapid Cycle Synchrotron), and finally up to 30 GeV by the MR [[synchrotron]] (Main Ring). [[Proton]]s collide with a [[graphite]] target, producing [[meson]]s, mainly [[pion]]s and [[kaon]]s, which are then focused by a set of three [[magnetic horn]]s and directed into a tunnel called the decay volume. Depending on the horns polarity, either positive or negative particles are focused. Positive pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon+}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}}, forming a muon neutrino beam, while negative pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon-}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon antineutrino}}, forming a muon antineutrino beam. All remaining [[hadron]]s and charged [[lepton]]s are stopped by a 75-ton block of graphite (so-called beam dump) and in the ground, while neutrinos travel underground towards the far detector.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===Off-axis beam===\n\nT2K is the first experiment in which the concept of off-axis [[accelerator neutrino|neutrino beam]] was realized. The neutrino beam at J-PARC is designed so that it can be directed 2 to 3 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] away from the [[Super-Kamiokande]] far detector and one of the near detectors, ND280. The off-axis angle was chosen to 2.5\u00b0 to maximize the probability of oscillation at a distance corresponding to the far detector, which for 295&nbsp;km is maximal for around 600&nbsp;MeV neutrinos. In this neutrino energy range, the dominant type of neutrino interactions are charged current quasielastic interactions, for which it is possible to reconstruct the energy of the interacting neutrino only on the basis of the momentum and direction of the produced charged lepton. The higher neutrino energies are suppressed by the off-axis configuration, decreasing the number of interactions with meson production, which are background in the oscillation analysis in the T2K experiment.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref name=\"t2kflux\">{{cite journal |author=T2K Collaboration |title=T2K neutrino flux prediction |journal=Physical Review D |date=2 January 2013 |volume=87 |issue=1 |doi=10.1103/physrevd.87.012001|arxiv=1211.0469}}</ref>\n\n==Near detectors==\n\nThe near detector complex is located at a distance of 280 meters from the graphite target. Its purpose is to measure the neutrino flux before oscillations and to study neutrino interactions. The system consists of three main detectors:\n* INGRID detector (Interactive Neutrino GRID) located on the axis of the neutrino beam,\n* ND280 detector located 2.5\u00b0 away from the beam axis, i.e. at the same angle as the far detector.\n* Wagasci-BabyMIND is a magnetised neutrino detector located at 1.5\u00b0 off-axis angle, built to explore the energy spectrum variation with the off-axis angle and cross-sections at higher average neutrino energy.\n\n===Signal readout===\n\nExcept for the Time Projection Chambres in ND280, the entire active material (enabling particle tracking) of the near detectors is plastic scintillator. The light produced by traversing particles in the plastic [[scintillator]] bars and planes is collected by wavelength-shifting fibres and detected by Hamamatsu Multi-pixel photon counters installed/located at one or both ends of the fibres. Scintillator bars are organised into layers, where bars in two neighbouring layers are perpendicular to each other providing together 3D information about traversing particles.\n\n===INGRID detector===\n\nThe main purpose of the INGRID detector is the monitoring of the direction and intensity of the beam on a daily basis by direct detection of neutrino interactions. The INGRID detector consists of 16 identical modules arranged in the shape of a cross, 7 in a vertical and 7 in a horizontal arm, plus 2 modules outside the cross. Height and width of the arms are 10 meters. A single module consists of alternating layers of iron and a plastic scintillator. An additional 4 veto layers of the scintillator surround the module on the sides to distinguish particles entering from the outside from those produced by interactions inside the module. The total mass of iron in one module is 7.1 tons and constitutes 96% of the module weight. On the neutrino beam axis, in the middle of the cross between the vertical and horizontal arm, there is an additional module built only from layers of the plastic scintillator (Proton Module) with a mass of 0.55 tons. Its purpose is to register quasielastic interactions and compare the obtained results with the simulations.\n\n===ND280 detector===\n\n[[File:J-PARC T2K ND280 Pit.jpg|thumb|ND280 under construction]]\nThe ND280 detector is used to measure the flux, energy spectrum and electron neutrino beam pollution for the same off-axis angle as for the far detector. ND280 also investigates various types of muon and electron neutrino and antineutrino interactions. All this allows estimating the expected number and type of interactions in the far detector, reducing the systematic error in the neutrino oscillations analysis associated with models of neutrino interactions and flux.\n\nND280 is composed of the set of inner sub-detectors: Pi-Zero detector and a tracker with 2 Fine-Grained Detectors interleaved with 3 Time Projection Chambres, placed inside of a metal frame called a basket. The basket is surrounded by the electromagnetic calorimeter and a magnet recycled from the [[UA1 experiment]] producing 0.2 T uniform horizontal field and instrumented with scintillator planes constituting the Side Muon Range Detector.\n\n====Pi Zero detector====\n\nThe Pi-Zero ({{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}) Detector (P0D) contains 40 plastic scintillator module planes, which in the central part are interleaved with 2.8 cm thick bags fillable of water and thick brass sheets, and in two peripheral regions scintillator modules are sandwiched with lead sheets. By comparison of the amount of interaction between modes with and without water in the bags, it is possible to extract the number of neutrino interactions occurring on the water - the target material inside the far detector Super-Kamiokande.\nThe size of the entire active P0D volume is around 2.1 m \u00d7 2.2 m \u00d7 2.4 m (X\u00d7Y\u00d7Z) and its mass with and without water is 15.8 and 12.9 tons respectively.\n\nThe main goal of the Pi-Zero Detector is measurement neutral [[pion]]s production in [[neutral current]] neutrino interactions on water:\n: {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N \u2192 {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N\u2019 + {{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}\nThis reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions because photons from pi0 decay can be mis-reconstructed as an electron in the Super-Kamiokande detector, thus this reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions and constitute an important background in electron neutrino appearance measurement.\n<ref>{{cite journal |author=S.

TPCs are filled with argon-based drift gas under atmospheric pressure. Charged particles crossing TPC ionise the gas along their track. The ionisation electrons drift from the cathode to the sides of the TPC, where they are detected by the MicroMegas providing a 3D image of a path of the traversing charged particle. Y and Z coordinates are based on the position of the detected ionisation electrons on the MicroMegas modules, and X coordinate is based on the electrons drift time. In the magnetic field, the curvature of this path allows to determine [[electric charge|charge]] and [[momentum]] of the particle, and the amount of the ionisation electrons per unit distance is used to identify particles based on the [[Bethe formula|Bethe-Bloch formula]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=T2K ND280 TPC collaboration |title=Time projection chambers for the T2K near detectors |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment |date=May 2011 |volume=637 |issue=1 |pages=25\u201346 |doi=10.1016/j.nima.2011.02.036|arxiv=1012.0865}}</ref>\n\n====Fine-grained detectors====\n\nTwo fine-grained detectors (FGDs) are placed after the first and second TPCs. Together the FGDs and TPCs make up the tracker of ND280. The FGDs provide the active target mass for the neutrino interactions and are able to measure the short tracks of proton recoil. The first FGD is composed of scintillator layers only, while the second FGD is composed of alternating layers of scintillator and water. The second FGD is partially composed of water because the detector at Super-Kamiokande is water-based. Cross sections on carbon and on the water can be determined from a comparison of neutrino interactions in the two FGDs.\n\n====Electromagnetic Calorimeter====\n\nThe Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) surrounds the inner detectors (P0D, TPCs, FGDs) and consists of scintillator layers sandwiched with lead absorber sheets. Its role is to detect neutral particles, especially photons, and measure their energy and direction, as well as to detect charged particles providing additional information relevant for their identification.\n\n====Side Muon Range Detector====\n\nThe Side Muon Range Detector (SMRD) consists of scintillator modules which are inserted into the gaps in the magnet. The SMRD records muons escaping the inner parts of the detector at large angles with respect to the beam direction. It can also act as a trigger for [[cosmic rays]]. Finally, it can help identify beam interactions in the surrounding walls and in the magnet itself.\n\n==Super-Kamiokande==\n{{main|Super-Kamiokande}}\n\nSuper-Kamiokande detector is located 1000 m underground in the Mozumi Mine, under Mount Ikeno in the Kamoka area of Hida city. It is a [[stainless steel]] [[cylinder|cylindrical]] tank of about 40 m height and diameter, filled with 50,000 tons of [[water]] and instrumented with around 13,000 [[photomultiplier]] tubes (PMT). It detects a [[cone]] of [[Cherenkov radiation|Cherenkov light]] emitted by charged particles moving in water faster than light in this medium.\nIts goal is to measure [[muon]]s and [[electron]]s produced in [[charged current]] quasielastic interactions (CCQE) of {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}, respectively. Due to relatively large mass, muons usually do not change their direction and thus produce a well-defined cone of Cherenkov light observed by PMTs as a clear, sharp ring. In contrast, electrons, because of smaller mass, are more susceptible to scattering and almost always produce electromagnetic [[particle shower|showers]], observed by PMTs as a ring with fuzzy edges. Neutrino energy is calculated based on the direction and energy of a charged [[lepton]] produced in the CCQE interaction. In this way, {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}} spectra are determined, leading to the measurement of the [[neutrino oscillation|oscillation]] parameters relevant for muon neutrino disappearance and electron neutrino appearance.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nT2K is a successor of the KEK to Kamioka ([[K2K experiment|K2K]]) experiment, which ran from 1999 till 2004. In the [[K2K experiment]], an [[accelerator neutrino|accelerator beam]] of muon neutrinos was produced at [[KEK]] facility in [[Tsukuba, Ibaraki|Tsukuba]] ([[Japan]]) and sent towards the [[Super-Kamiokande]] detector, located 250 km away. The K2K experiment results confirmed at the level of at 99.9985% confidence (4.3 [[Standard deviation|\u03c3]]) the [[neutrino oscillation|disappearance]] of the [[muon neutrino]]s and were consistent with the previous measurements of oscillation parameters measured by the Super-Kamiokande detector for [[atmospheric neutrino]]s. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Oyama |first1=Yuichi |title=Results from K2K and status of T2K |journal=arXiv:hep-ex/0512041 |date=2006 |pages=113\u2013124 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-4965-1_9 |arxiv=hep-ex/0512041}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=K2K Collaboration |title=Measurement of neutrino oscillation by the K2K experiment |journal=Physical Review D |date=12 October 2006 |volume=74 |issue=7 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.74.072003|arxiv=hep-ex/0606032}}</ref>\n\nThe construction of the neutrino beamline started in 2004 and it was successfully commissioned in 2009. Construction of the entire INGRID detector and majority of the ND280 detector (without barrel part of the electromagnetic calorimeter) was completed in 2009. The missing part of the calorimeter was installed in the fall of 2010. T2K far detector is the large Super-Kamiokande detector, which has been running since 1996 and studying [[proton lifetime]] and oscillations of [[atmospheric neutrino|atmospheric]], [[solar neutrino|solar]] and [[accelerator neutrino|accelerator]] neutrinos. <ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\nT2K experiment started to take neutrino data for a physics analysis in January 2010, initially with an incomplete ND280 detector, and starting from November 2010 with the full setup. The data taking was interrupted for one year by the [[Great Tohoku Earthquake]] in March 2011.

Both robbers were killed, 12 police officers and eight civilians were injured, and numerous vehicles and other property were damaged or destroyed by the nearly 2,000 rounds of ammunition fired by the robbers and police.<ref name=\"Parker\"/>\n\nAt 9:17&nbsp;am, Phillips and M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu entered and robbed the North Hollywood [[Bank of America]] branch. The two robbers were confronted by LAPD officers when they exited the bank and a [[shootout]] between the officers and robbers ensued. The robbers attempted to flee the scene, Phillips on foot and M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu in their getaway vehicle, while continuing to exchange fire with the officers. The shootout continued onto a residential street adjacent to the bank until Phillips, mortally wounded, succumbed to a self-inflicted gunshot wound; M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu was incapacitated by officers three blocks away and subsequently bled to death before the arrival of paramedics more than an hour later.\n\nPhillips and M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu are believed to have robbed at least two other banks using similar methods by taking control of the entire bank and firing weapons illegally-modified to fire fully-automatic, chambered for [[intermediate cartridge]]s for control and entry past 'bullet-proof' security doors, and were suspects in two [[Armored car (valuables)|armored car]] robberies.<ref>[http://www.northhollywoodshootout.com/timeline.html Timeline - 'Bears In The Beehive'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923003825/http://www.northhollywoodshootout.com/timeline.html|date=September 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\nStandard issue sidearms carried by most local patrol officers at the time were [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum|9mm]] pistols or [[.38 Special]] revolvers; some patrol cars were also equipped with a [[gauge (bore diameter)|12-gauge]] shotgun. Phillips and M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu carried [[Type 56 assault rifle|Norinco Type 56 S-1s]] (an [[AK-47]] variant), a [[Bushmaster XM-15|Bushmaster XM15 Dissipator]] with high-capacity [[drum magazine]], and a [[Heckler & Koch HK41#HK91|Heckler & Koch HK-91]] rifle, all of which had been illegally-modified to make them fire fully-automatic, as well as a [[Beretta 92#92FS|Beretta 92FS]] pistol. The robbers wore mostly homemade, heavy plated [[ballistic vest|body armor]] which successfully protected them from handgun rounds and shotgun pellets fired by the responding officers. A police [[SWAT]] team eventually arrived bearing sufficient firepower, and they commandeered an armored truck to evacuate the wounded. Several officers also appropriated [[AR-15]] and other semi-automatic rifles from a nearby firearms dealer. The incident sparked debate on the need for patrol officers to [[militarization of police|upgrade their firepower]] in preparation for similar situations in the future.<ref>{{cite web|title=How the North Hollywood Shootout Changed Patrol Arsenals|url=http://www.policemag.com/Channel/Weapons/Articles/Print/Story/2012/02/How-the-North-Hollywood-Shootout-Changed-Patrol-Rifles.aspx|publisher=Policemag.com|access-date=June 14, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702091610/http://www.policemag.com/channel/weapons/articles/print/story/2012/02/how-the-north-hollywood-shootout-changed-patrol-rifles.aspx|archivedate=July 2, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nDue to the large number of injuries, rounds fired, weapons used, and overall length of the shootout, it is regarded as one of the most intense gun battles in U.S. police history.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/tv/reviews/44893/44-minutes/ |title=44 Minutes: The North Hollywood Shootout |author=Cynthia Fuchs |date=June 1, 2003 |magazine=PopMatters |access-date=September 29, 2007 |quote=The legal and cultural fallout of the crime had to do with just how much firepower the cops should be carrying, if outlaws find it so easy to purchase AK-47s at gun shows. |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015163522/http://popmatters.com/pm/tv/reviews/44893/44-minutes/ |archivedate=October 15, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Combined, the two men had fired approximately 1,100 rounds in total, while approximately 650 rounds were fired by police.<ref name=\"History\">''Shootout!''; The History Channel; Viewed July 8, 2008.</ref> Another estimate is that a total of nearly 2,000 rounds were fired.<ref name=\"Parker\"/>\n\n==Backgrounds==\n{{multiple image\n|image1=Emil M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu, 1982.png\n|caption1=Matasareanu in 1982, as a teenager\n| width1    = 130\n|image2=Larry Eugene Phillips, Sr. and Larry Eugene Phillips, Jr.png\n|caption2=Phillips as a child, with his father\n| width2    = 170\n}}This is not true, here is the link to the actual newspaper article published the day after this event.

However, due to a change in the bank's delivery schedule, the vault contained significantly less than the $750,000 the gunmen had expected. Phillips, enraged at this development, argued with Villigrana and demanded more. In an apparent show of frustration, Phillips then fired a full drum magazine of 75 rounds into the bank's safe, destroying much of the remaining money. Phillips then attempted to open the bank's ATM, but due to a change in policies, the branch manager no longer had access to the money inside.

Police likely shot Phillips and his rifle with their handguns while Phillips was still firing and taking cover near the four vehicles adjacent to the North wall of the bank (gray Honda Civic, Ford Explorer, white Acura Legend, and Chevrolet Celebrity). One location that Officer Zielenski of Valley Traffic Division used for cover was the Del Taco restaurant West wall, 351 feet from Phillips. Officer Zielenski fired 86 9mm rounds at Phillips and may have hit Phillips at least once. The other location that proved advantageous for the LAPD was the back yard of 6641 Agnes Avenue. A cinder block wall provided cover for detectives who shot at and may have struck Phillips with 9mm rounds from their pistols. Detective Bancroft fired 17 rounds and Detective Harley fired between 15 and 24 rounds at Phillips from a distance of approximately 55 feet.

The SWAT team arrived 18 minutes after the shooting had begun. They were armed with [[AR-15]]s, and wore running shoes and shorts under their body armor, as they had been on an exercise run when they received the call. Upon arrival, they commandeered a nearby [[armored car (valuables)|armored truck]], which was used to extract wounded civilians and officers from the scene.<ref name=\"critical\" />\n\n===Deaths of the gunmen===\n[[File:HK41 SG1.jpg|thumb|An HK-91 rifle]]\nWhile still in the parking lot, M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu was shot twice in the right buttock and the left forearm, forcing him to abandon his [[duffel bag]] of money, enter the getaway vehicle, and start the engine. Phillips retrieved the HK-91 from the open trunk and continued firing upon officers while walking alongside the sedan, using it for cover. As Phillips approached the passenger's side of the getaway vehicle, he was hit in the shoulder and his rifle was struck in the receiver and magazine by bullets fired by police. After firing a few more shots with one arm, Phillips discarded the HK-91 and retrieved the Norinco Type 56 before exiting the parking lot and retreating onto the street while M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu drove down the road.<ref name=\"critical\" />\n\nAt 9:52&nbsp;am, Phillips turned east on Archwood Street and took cover behind a parked semi-truck where he continued to fire at the police until his rifle jammed.<ref name=\"enn\">LAPD Shoot-Out With Bank Robbers.</ref> Unable to clear the jam, he dropped the rifle and drew a Beretta 92FS pistol, which he began firing. He was then shot in the right hand, causing him to drop the pistol. After retrieving it, he placed the muzzle under his chin and fired; he was simultaneously shot by a bullet that severed his spine. Officers across the street continued to shoot Phillips' body several times while he was on the ground. After the firing had stopped, officers in the area surrounded Phillips, handcuffed him, and removed his ski mask.{{Citation needed|date = February 2018}}\n\nM\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu's vehicle was rendered inoperable after two of its tires were shot out and the windshield covered in bullet holes.<ref name=\"critical\" /> At 9:56&nbsp;am, he attempted to [[carjack]] a yellow 1963 [[Jeep Gladiator (SJ)|Jeep Gladiator]] on Archwood by shooting at the driver, who fled on foot, three blocks east of where Phillips died. He quickly transferred all of his weapons and ammunition from the getaway car, but was unable to operate the Jeep due to the driver engaging the [[kill switch|electrical kill switch]] before fleeing. As KCBS and KCAL helicopters hovered overhead, a patrol car driven by SWAT officers quickly arrived and stopped on the opposite side of the truck to where the Chevrolet was stopped. M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu left the truck, took cover behind the original getaway car, and engaged them  two-and-a-half minutes of almost uninterrupted gunfire.

Both robbers were killed, 12 police officers and eight civilians were injured, and numerous vehicles and other property were damaged or destroyed by the nearly 2,000 rounds of ammunition fired by the robbers and police.<ref name=\"Parker\"/>\n\nAt 9:17&nbsp;am, Phillips and M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu entered and robbed the North Hollywood [[Bank of America]] branch. The two robbers were confronted by LAPD officers when they exited the bank and a [[shootout]] between the officers and robbers ensued. The robbers attempted to flee the scene, Phillips on foot and M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu in their getaway vehicle, while continuing to exchange fire with the officers. The shootout continued onto a residential street adjacent to the bank until Phillips, mortally wounded, succumbed to a self-inflicted gunshot wound; M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu was incapacitated by officers three blocks away and subsequently bled to death before the arrival of paramedics more than an hour later.\n\nPhillips and M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu are believed to have robbed at least two other banks using similar methods by taking control of the entire bank and firing weapons illegally-modified to fire fully-automatic, chambered for [[intermediate cartridge]]s for control and entry past 'bullet-proof' security doors, and were suspects in two [[Armored car (valuables)|armored car]] robberies.<ref>[http://www.northhollywoodshootout.com/timeline.html Timeline - 'Bears In The Beehive'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923003825/http://www.northhollywoodshootout.com/timeline.html|date=September 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\nStandard issue sidearms carried by most local patrol officers at the time were [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum|9mm]] pistols or [[.38 Special]] revolvers; some patrol cars were also equipped with a [[gauge (bore diameter)|12-gauge]] shotgun. Phillips and M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu carried [[Type 56 assault rifle|Norinco Type 56 S-1s]] (an [[AK-47]] variant), a [[Bushmaster XM-15|Bushmaster XM15 Dissipator]] with high-capacity [[drum magazine]], and a [[Heckler & Koch HK41#HK91|Heckler & Koch HK-91]] rifle, all of which had been illegally-modified to make them fire fully-automatic, as well as a [[Beretta 92#92FS|Beretta 92FS]] pistol. The robbers wore mostly homemade, heavy plated [[ballistic vest|body armor]] which successfully protected them from handgun rounds and shotgun pellets fired by the responding officers. A police [[SWAT]] team eventually arrived bearing sufficient firepower, and they commandeered an armored truck to evacuate the wounded. Several officers also appropriated [[AR-15]] and other semi-automatic rifles from a nearby firearms dealer. The incident sparked debate on the need for patrol officers to [[militarization of police|upgrade their firepower]] in preparation for similar situations in the future.<ref>{{cite web|title=How the North Hollywood Shootout Changed Patrol Arsenals|url=http://www.policemag.com/Channel/Weapons/Articles/Print/Story/2012/02/How-the-North-Hollywood-Shootout-Changed-Patrol-Rifles.aspx|publisher=Policemag.com|access-date=June 14, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702091610/http://www.policemag.com/channel/weapons/articles/print/story/2012/02/how-the-north-hollywood-shootout-changed-patrol-rifles.aspx|archivedate=July 2, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nDue to the large number of injuries, rounds fired, weapons used, and overall length of the shootout, it is regarded as one of the most intense gun battles in U.S. police history.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/tv/reviews/44893/44-minutes/ |title=44 Minutes: The North Hollywood Shootout |author=Cynthia Fuchs |date=June 1, 2003 |magazine=PopMatters |access-date=September 29, 2007 |quote=The legal and cultural fallout of the crime had to do with just how much firepower the cops should be carrying, if outlaws find it so easy to purchase AK-47s at gun shows. |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015163522/http://popmatters.com/pm/tv/reviews/44893/44-minutes/ |archivedate=October 15, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Combined, the two men had fired approximately 1,100 rounds in total, while approximately 650 rounds were fired by police.<ref name=\"History\">''Shootout!''; The History Channel; Viewed July 8, 2008.</ref> Another estimate is that a total of nearly 2,000 rounds were fired.<ref name=\"Parker\"/>\n\n==Backgrounds==\n{{multiple image\n|image1=Emil M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu, 1982.png\n|caption1=Matasareanu in 1982, as a teenager\n| width1    = 130\n|image2=Larry Eugene Phillips, Sr. and Larry Eugene Phillips, Jr.png\n|caption2=Phillips as a child, with his father\n| width2    = 170\n}}\n'''Larry Eugene Phillips Jr.''' (September 20, 1970 - February 28, 1997) and the [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romanian]]-born '''Decebal \u0218tefan Emilian \"Emil\" M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu''' (July 19, 1966 - February 28, 1997) first met at a [[Gold's Gym]] in [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice]], [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], in 1989.

Police likely shot Phillips and his rifle with their handguns while Phillips was still firing and taking cover near the four vehicles adjacent to the North wall of the bank (gray Honda Civic, Ford Explorer, white Acura Legend, and Chevrolet Celebrity). One location that Officer Zielenski of Valley Traffic Division used for cover was the Del Taco restaurant West wall, 351 feet from Phillips. Officer Zielenski fired 86 9mm rounds at Phillips and may have hit Phillips at least once. The other location that proved advantageous for the LAPD was the back yard of 6641 Agnes Avenue. A cinder block wall provided cover for detectives who shot at and may have struck Phillips with 9mm rounds from their pistols. Detective Bancroft fired 17 rounds and Detective Harley fired between 15 and 24 rounds at Phillips from a distance of approximately 55 feet.

The SWAT team arrived 18 minutes after the shooting had begun. They were armed with [[AR-15]]s, and wore running shoes and shorts under their body armor, as they had been on an exercise run when they received the call.

Phillips retrieved the HK-91 from the open trunk and continued firing upon officers while walking alongside the sedan, using it for cover. As Phillips approached the passenger's side of the getaway vehicle, he was hit in the shoulder and his rifle was struck in the receiver and magazine by bullets fired by police. After firing a few more shots with one arm, Phillips discarded the HK-91 and retrieved the Norinco Type 56 before exiting the parking lot and retreating onto the street while M\u0103t\u0103s\u0103reanu drove down the road.<ref name=\"critical\" />\n\nAt 9:52&nbsp;am, Phillips turned east on Archwood Street and took cover behind a parked semi-truck where he continued to fire at the police until his rifle jammed.<ref name=\"enn\">LAPD Shoot-Out With Bank Robbers.</ref> Unable to clear the jam, he dropped the rifle and drew a Beretta 92FS pistol, which he began firing.

As a result, his publisher hired ghostwriters to write novels in the Clancy style.]]\n\nA '''ghostwriter''' is hired to write [[literature|literary]] or [[journalism|journalistic]] works, [[Public speaking|speeches]], or other texts that are officially credited to another person as the [[author]]. Celebrities, executives, participants in timely news stories, and political leaders often hire ghostwriters to draft or edit [[autobiography|autobiographies]], [[memoir]]s, magazine articles, or other written material. In music, ghostwriters are often used to write songs, lyrics, and instrumental pieces. Screenplay authors can also use ghostwriters to either [[script doctor|edit or rewrite their scripts]] to improve them.\n\nUsually, there is a confidentiality clause in the contract between the ghostwriter and the credited author that obligates the former to remain anonymous. Sometimes the ghostwriter is acknowledged by the author or publisher for his or her writing services, euphemistically called a \"researcher\" or \"research assistant\", but often the ghostwriter is not credited.\n\nGhostwriting (or simply \"ghosting\") also occurs in other creative fields. Composers have long hired ghostwriters to help them to write musical pieces and songs; [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] is an example of a well-known composer who was paid to ghostwrite music for wealthy patrons. Ghosting also occurs in [[popular music]]. A pop music ghostwriter writes lyrics and a melody in the style of the credited musician. In [[hip hop]] music, the increasing use of ghostwriters by high-profile hip-hop stars has led to controversy.<ref name=\"bbc.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28551924|title=The secret ghostwriters of Hip Hop|work=BBC News}}</ref> In the visual arts, it is not uncommon in either [[fine art]] or commercial art such as [[comics]] for a number of assistants to do work on a piece that is credited to a single artist; [[Andy Warhol]] engaged in this practice, supervising an [[assembly line]] [[silk screen]] process for his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/warhol/story/0,11478,648898,00.html |title=My 15 minutes | work=[[The Guardian (newspaper)|The Guardian]]|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref> However, when credit is established for the writer, the acknowledgement of their contribution is public domain and the writer in question would not be considered a ghostwriter.\n\n==Overview==\n\nA consultant or career-switcher may pay a ghostwriter to write a book on a topic in their professional area, to establish or enhance credibility as an 'expert' in their field. Public officials and [[politicians]] employ \"correspondence officers\" to respond to the large volume of official [[communication|correspondence]]. A number of papal [[encyclical]]s have been written by ghostwriters. A controversial and scientifically unethical practice is medical ghostwriting, where biotech or pharmaceutical companies pay professional writers to produce papers and then recruit (via payment or as a perk) other scientists or physicians to attach their names to these articles before they are published in medical or scientific journals. Some university and college students hire ghostwriters from [[essay mill]]s to write entrance essays, term papers, theses, and dissertations. This is largely considered unethical unless the actual ghostwriting work is just light editing.\n\nGhostwriters are hired for numerous reasons. In many cases, celebrities or public figures do not have the time, discipline, or writing skills to write and research a several hundred page autobiography or \"how-to\" book. Even if a celebrity or public figure has the writing skills to pen a short article, they may not know how to structure and edit a several hundred page book so that it is captivating and well-paced. In other cases, publishers use ghostwriters to increase the number of books that can be published each year under the name of well-known, highly marketable authors, or to quickly release a topical book that ties in with a recent or upcoming newsworthy event.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Quien no corre, vuela|url = http://www.zoomnews.es/40446/letras-y-tretas/quien-no-corre-vuela|website = ZoomNews|accessdate = 2015-11-14|language = es-ES|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015909/http://www.zoomnews.es/40446/letras-y-tretas/quien-no-corre-vuela|archivedate = 2015-11-17}}</ref>\n\n==Remuneration and credit==\n[[File:Hrcraad.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The ghostwriter for [[Hillary Clinton]]'s memoirs received a $500,000 fee for collaborating with her.]]\n\nGhostwriters will often spend from several months to a full year researching, writing, and editing [[nonfiction]] and [[fiction]] works for a client, and they are paid based on a price per hour, per word or per page, with a flat fee, a percentage of the royalties of the sales, or some combination thereof. [[Literary agent]] Madeleine Morel states that the average ghostwriter's advance for work for major book publishers is \"between $15,000 and $75,000\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bookwritinginc.com/blog/what-is-ghostwriting-complete-guide-ghostwriting/ |title=What is Ghostwriting?

One such market is the shorter book, best represented at the moment by Amazon's Kindle Singles imprint: texts of 30,000 words and under.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/sep/05/amazon-kindle-singles-short|title=The big short \u2013 why Amazon's Kindle Singles are the future|author=Julian Gough|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> Such a length would have been much harder to sell before digital reader-technologies became widely available, but is now quite acceptable.

Manhattan Literary, a ghostwriting company, states that \"book projects on the shorter side, tailored to new markets like the Kindle Singles imprint and others (30,000\u201342,000 words) start at a cost of $15,000\".<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/who-wrote-that-political-memoir-no-who-actually-wrote-it/2014/06/09/8e89ccae-f00a-11e3-9ebc-2ee6f81ed217_story.html|title=Who wrote that political memoir?

It was once financially impractical for publishers to produce such novella-length texts (they would have to charge too much); but this new market is, by 2015, already substantial and has been projected to be a solid part of the future of book publishing.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/> So, with its appearance the starting price for the professional book writer has come down by about half, but only if this shorter format makes sense for the client.\n\nOn the upper end of the spectrum, with celebrities that can all but guarantee a publisher large sales, the fees can be much higher. In 2001, the ''[[New York Times]]'' stated that the fee that the ghostwriter for [[Hillary Clinton]]'s memoirs would receive was probably about $500,000 of her book's $8 million advance, which \"is near the top of flat fees paid to collaborators\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E3DF153AF93BA35752C0A9679C8B63 | work=The New York Times | first=David D. | last=Kirkpatrick | title=Media Talk; Mrs.Clinton Seeks Ghostwriter for Memoirs | date=8 January 2001}}</ref>\n\nThere is also the consideration of different benchmarks in different countries. In Canada, The Writers' Union has established a minimum fee schedule for ghostwriting, starting at $40,000 for a 200 to 300 page book, paid at various stages of the drafting of the book. Research fees are an extra charge on top of this minimum fee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.writersunion.ca/content/ghost-writing|title=Ghost Writing|work=writersunion.ca|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801172621/http://www.writersunion.ca/content/ghost-writing|archivedate=2012-08-01}}</ref>\n\nA recent availability also exists, of outsourcing many kinds of jobs, including ghostwriting, to [[Offshoring|offshore]] locations like India, China, and the Philippines where the customer can save money.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-19476254|title=The globalisation of work - and people|work=BBC News}}</ref> The true tests of credibility\u2014the writer's track record, and samples of his or her craft\u2014become even more important in these instances, when the writer comes from a culture and first language that are entirely different from the client's.\n\nIn some cases, ghostwriters are allowed to share credit. For example, a common method is to put the client/author's name on a book cover as the main byline (by ''Author's Name'') and then to put the ghostwriter's name underneath it (as told to ''Ghostwriter's Name''). Sometimes this is done in lieu of pay or in order to decrease the amount of payment to the book ghostwriter for whom the credit has its own intrinsic value. Also, the ghostwriter can be cited as a co-author of a book, or listed in the movie or film credits when having ghostwritten the script or screenplay for film production.\n\nFor nonfiction books, the ghostwriter may be credited as a \"contributor\" or a \"research assistant\". In other cases, the ghostwriter receives no official credit for writing a book or article; in cases where the credited author or the [[publisher]] or both wish to conceal the ghostwriter's role, the ghostwriter may be asked to sign a [[nondisclosure contract]] that legally forbids any mention of the writer's role in a project. Some have made the distinction between \"author\" and \"writer\", as ghostwriter Kevin Anderson explains in a ''[[Washington Post]]'' interview: \"A ghostwriter is an interpreter and a translator, not an author, which is why our clients deserve full credit for authoring their books.\"<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\"/>\n\n==Types==\n\n===Nonfiction===\nGhostwriters are widely used by celebrities and public figures who wish to publish their autobiographies or memoirs. The degree of involvement of the ghostwriter in nonfiction writing projects ranges from minor to substantial. Various sources explain the role of the ghostwriter and how competent writers can get this kind of work. In some cases, a ghostwriter may be called in just to clean up, edit, and polish a rough draft of an autobiography or a \"how-to\" book. In other cases, the ghostwriter will write an entire book or article based on information, stories, notes, an outline, or interview sessions with the celebrity or public figure. The credited author also indicates to the ghostwriter what type of style, tone, or \"voice\" they want in the book.\n\nIn some cases, such as with some \"how-to\" books, diet guides, or cookbooks, a book will be entirely written by a ghostwriter, and the celebrity (e.g., a well-known musician or sports star) will be credited as author. Publishing companies use this strategy to increase the marketability of a book by associating it with a celebrity or well-known figure. In several countries before elections, candidates commission ghostwriters to produce autobiographies for them so as to gain visibility and exposure. Two of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s books are almost entirely credited to ghostwriters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2478/did-john-f-kennedy-really-write-profiles-in-courage|title=The Straight Dope: Did John F.

For example, a successful salesperson hoping to become a motivational speaker on selling may pay a ghostwriter to write a book on sales techniques. Often this type of book is published by a [[self-publishing press]] (or \"[[vanity press]]\"), which means that the author is paying to have the book published. This type of book is typically given away to prospective clients as a promotional tool, rather than being sold in bookstores.\n\n===Fiction===\nGhostwriters are employed by fiction publishers for several reasons. In some cases, publishers use ghostwriters to increase the number of books that can be published each year by a well-known, highly marketable author. Ghostwriters are mostly used to pen fiction works for well-known \"name\" authors in genres such as detective fiction, mysteries, and teen fiction.\n\nAdditionally, publishers use ghostwriters to write new books for established series where the \"author\" is a [[pseudonym]]. For example, the purported authors of the [[Nancy Drew]] and [[Hardy Boys]] mysteries, \"[[Carolyn Keene]]\" and \"[[Franklin W. Dixon]]\", respectively, are actually pseudonyms for a series of ghostwriters who write books in the same style using a template of basic information about the book's characters and their fictional universe (names, dates, speech patterns), and about the tone and style that are expected in the book (for more information, see the articles on pseudonyms or [[pen name]]<nowiki/>s). In addition, ghostwriters are often given copies of several of the previous books in the series to help them match the style.\n\nThe estate of romance novelist [[V. C. Andrews]] hired ghostwriter [[Andrew Neiderman]] to continue writing novels after her death, under her name and in a similar style to her original works. Many of action writer [[Tom Clancy]]'s books from the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]] bear the names of two people on their covers, with Clancy's name in larger print and the other author's name in smaller print. Various books bearing Clancy's name were written by different authors under the same pseudonym. The first two books in the ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell]]'' franchise were written by [[Raymond Benson]] under the pseudonym [[David Michaels (author)|David Michaels]].\n\nSometimes famous authors will ghostwrite for other celebrities as well, such as when [[H. P. Lovecraft]] ghostwrote \"Imprisoned with the Pharaohs\" (also known as \"Under the Pyramids\") for [[Harry Houdini]] in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' in the 1920s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\n===Religious===\nA number of papal [[encyclical]]s have been written by ghostwriters.

Nonetheless, the style, tone and content is modeled on that of the credited author. Many website ghostwriters are [[freelance]] but some are [[freelancer]]s who work under [[employment contract|contract]], as with [[radio presenter]]s and [[television presenter]]s. Occasionally [[Pseudonym#Literary pen names|a \"house pseudonym\", or collective name]] is used by the author of the website.\n\nSome celebrities, [[Chief executive officer|CEOs]], or public figures set up blog websites\u2014sometimes as a marketing, public relations, or lobbying tool. However, since these individuals are typically too busy to write their blog posts, they hire discreet ghostwriters to post to the blog under the celebrity or CEO's name. As with nonfiction ghostwriting, the blog ghostwriter models their writing style, content and tone on that of the credited author. This goes for social media as well.

More recently, composers such as the UK-based Patric Standford (born in 1939) have ghostwritten for symphonic recordings and films such as the Rod McKuen Cello Concerto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.impulse-music.co.uk/standford.htm|title=Patric Standford|work=impulse-music.co.uk}}</ref> In the film industry, a music ghostwriter is a \"person who composes music for another composer but is not credited on the cue sheet or in the final product in any way.\" The practice is considered one of the \"dirty little secrets of the film and television music business\" that is considered unethical,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmusicmag.com/kb/glossary.php|title=Film & TV Music Knowledgebase :: Glossary of Film and TV Music Terms|work=filmmusicmag.com}}</ref> but has been common since the early stages of the film industry. In the early years of film, [[David Raksin]] worked as music ghostwriter and [[Orchestration|orchestrator]] for [[Charlie Chaplin]]; even though Chaplin was credited as the score writer, he was considered to be a \"hummer\" (pejorative film industry slang for a person who purports to be a film score composer but who in fact only gives a general idea of the melodies to a ghostwriter).\n\nThe practice is also common in television, as composers listed on cue sheets are entitled to music royalties every time an episode or theme score appears on television. A 1998 investigation by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' revealed that it was especially prevalent among animation companies such as [[Saban Entertainment]], [[DiC Entertainment|DiC]], [[Ruby-Spears Productions]] and [[Hanna-Barbera]], which often listed company executives as musicians for the purpose of royalties.<ref>\"Composers say they're paupers in royalty game\" - ''The Hollywood Reporter'' (1998)</ref> Several composers later filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Saban Entertainment president [[Haim Saban]], for allegedly taking ownership and credit for their musical compositions.\n\n====Popular music====\nMusical ghostwriting also occurs in [[popular music]]. When a record company wants to market an inexperienced young singer as a [[singer-songwriter]], or help a veteran bandleader coping with writer's block (or a lack of motivation to finish the next album), an experienced songwriter may be discreetly brought in to help.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} In other cases, a ghostwriter writes lyrics and a melody in the style of the credited musician, with little or no input from the credited musician. A ghostwriter providing this type of service may be thanked, without reference to the service provided, in the album credits, or they may be a true 'ghost', with no acknowledgement in the album.\n\nLegal disputes have arisen when musical ghostwriters have tried to claim royalties when an allegedly ghostwritten song becomes a money-making hit. In 1987, Darryl Neudorf was asked to work on a project for [[Nettwerk Productions]] involving a newly signed artist in their repertoire named [[Sarah McLachlan]]. This recording, the album ''[[Touch (Sarah McLachlan album)|Touch]]'', resulted in garnering the interest of [[Arista Records]]. She signed a multi-album contract with them and two of the songs that Neudorf worked on with her became commercial hits in [[Canada]]. In 1991, Neudorf was invited back to work with McLachlan on her second album, ''[[Solace (Sarah McLachlan album)|Solace]]''. In 1993, he filed a lawsuit against McLachlan and her label, [[Nettwerk]], alleging that he had made a significant and uncredited contribution to the songwriting on ''Touch'', and alleging that he wasn't paid properly for work done on ''Solace''. The judge in this suit eventually ruled in McLachlan's favour on the songs; though Neudorf may have contributed to the [[songwriting]], neither regarded each other as joint authors. The judge ruled in Neudorf's favour on the payment issue.\n\n[[File: Chuck D.

[[Frank Ocean]] started his career as a ghostwriter for artists such as [[Justin Bieber]], [[John Legend]] and [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]].\n\nCurrently in hip-hop, the credit given to ghostwriters varies: \"silent pens might sign confidentiality clauses, appear obliquely in the liner notes, or discuss their participation freely.\" In some cases, liner notes credit individuals for \"vocal arrangement\", which may be a euphemism for ghostwriting. In the early 2010s, hip-hop ghostwriting services like [[Rap Rebirth]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/07/03/137559845/no-flow-rap-rebirth-can-help|title=Stamberg Raps! And Other Tales From A Hip-Hop Ghostwriter|date=2 July 2011|work=NPR.org}}</ref> have appeared online, which provide recording artists who wish to purchase ghostwritten rhymes a greater degree of anonymity.\n\n===Visual art===\nGhost-authorship also applies to the visual arts, most commonly paintings. The extent of the master artist's contribution varies widely, as little as composition adjustments and corrective brush strokes, or as much as entire works. A common practice is the use of art instruction class milieu in which the master artist makes significant contributions to the work of the student who then signs that work as his or her own. Services addressing complete works have historically been highly confidential. Less prevalent are advertised commercial services which may use the term \"vanity artwork\" as suggestive of \"vanity publishing\".\n{{Clear}}\n\n===As blacklisting countermeasure===\nIn countries where the freedom of speech is not upheld and authors that have somehow displeased the ruling regime are \"blacklisted\" (i.e. forbidden from having their works published), the blacklisted authors or composers may ghostwrite material for other authors or composers who are in the good graces of the regime. Examples include \n* [[Carl Foreman]] and [[Michael Wilson (writer)|Michael Wilson]] for ''[[Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' (credited to [[Pierre Boulle]], who wrote [[The Bridge over the River Kwai|the novel]]).<ref>Discussed in Vladimir Hedrih, ''Adapting Psychological Tests and Measurement Instruments for Cross-Cultural Research: An Introduction'' (London: Routledge, 2019), 36-37. {{ISBN|9780429559808}}</ref>\n* [[Dalton Trumbo]] for ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' (credited to [[Ian McLellan Hunter]]).<ref>Also discussed is Trumbo's screenplay for ''Spartacus'', in Larry Ceplair and Christopher Trumbo, ''Dalton Trumbo: Blacklisted Hollywood Radical''  (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2014), 39 and 367ff. {{ISBN|9780813146829}}</ref>\n\n==In culture==\nMovies and novels about ghostwriters include:\n\n* [[Philip Roth]]'s 1979 novel ''[[The Ghost Writer]]''\n* [[Chico Buarque]]'s 2003 novel ''Budapeste''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/440456.Budapeste|title=Budapeste}}</ref> about the tribulations of Jos\u00e9 Costa, its protagonist, between Rio de Janeiro and Budapest\n* [[Jennie Erdal]]'s 2004 memoirs ''[[Ghosting: a Memoir]]'' about working as ghostwriter of [[Naim Attallah]] for 20 years\n* [[Claude Lelouch]]'s 2006 film ''[[Roman de gare]]''\n* [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]]'s 2007 novel ''[[The Ghost (novel)|The Ghost]]'' and its 2010 film adaptation ''[[The Ghost Writer (film)|The Ghost Writer]]'' by [[Roman Polanski]]\n* [[Alan Cumming]]'s 2007 horror film ''Ghost Writer'', formerly ''[[Suffering Man's Charity]]''\n* [[Jason Reitman]]'s 2011 comedy-drama film ''[[Young Adult (film)|Young Adult]]''\n* The plot of the first season of the animated comedy-drama ''[[BoJack Horseman]]'' involves the title character [[BoJack Horseman (character)|BoJack]] dictating his memoirs to [[Diane Nguyen]], a ghostwriter assigned by his publisher.\n* [[David Mitchell (author)|David Mitchell]]'s first novel ''[[Ghostwritten (novel)|Ghostwritten]]'' (1999) plays on the notion of characters ghostwriting their own lives.\n* [[Haruki Murakami]]'s 2009 novel ''[[1Q84]]'', in which one of the main plot lines revolves around a ghostwriter.\n*[[Kyoto Animation]]\u2019s 2018 anime television series, ''[[Violet Evergarden]]'', as well as the [[light novel]] of the same name, written by Kana Akatsuki.\n\n\n==See also==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* [[Automatic writing]]\n* [[Book-packaging]]\n* [[Content farm]]\n*[[Ghost singer]]\n* [[Hack writer]]\n*[[Publishing]]\n* [[Script doctor]]\n* [[Speechwriter]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Writing occupations]]\n[[Category:Deception]]\n[[Category:Occupations in music]]\n[[Category:Film music]]\n[[Category:Ghostwriting| ]]\n[[Category:Music controversies| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n{{short description|Writer who writes speeches or texts in the name and commissioned by another person}}\n[[File:Tom Clancy at Burns Library, Boston College.jpg|thumb|300px|The popular demand for [[Tom Clancy]]'s action novels exceeded his ability to write new books. As a result, his publisher hired ghostwriters to write novels in the Clancy style.]]\n\nA '''ghostwriter''' is hired to write [[literature|literary]] or [[journalism|journalistic]] works, [[Public speaking|speeches]], or other texts that are officially credited to another person as the [[author]]. Celebrities, executives, participants in timely news stories, and political leaders often hire ghostwriters to draft or edit [[autobiography|autobiographies]], [[memoir]]s, magazine articles, or other written material. In music, ghostwriters are often used to write songs, lyrics, and instrumental pieces. Screenplay authors can also use ghostwriters to either [[script doctor|edit or rewrite their scripts]] to improve them.\n\nUsually, there is a confidentiality clause in the contract between the ghostwriter and the credited author that obligates the former to remain anonymous. Sometimes the ghostwriter is acknowledged by the author or publisher for his or her writing services, euphemistically called a \"researcher\" or \"research assistant\", but often the ghostwriter is not credited.\n\nGhostwriting (or simply \"ghosting\") also occurs in other creative fields. Composers have long hired ghostwriters to help them to write musical pieces and songs; [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] is an example of a well-known composer who was paid to ghostwrite music for wealthy patrons. Ghosting also occurs in [[popular music]]. A pop music ghostwriter writes lyrics and a melody in the style of the credited musician. In [[hip hop]] music, the increasing use of ghostwriters by high-profile hip-hop stars has led to controversy.<ref name=\"bbc.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28551924|title=The secret ghostwriters of Hip Hop|work=BBC News}}</ref> In the visual arts, it is not uncommon in either [[fine art]] or commercial art such as [[comics]] for a number of assistants to do work on a piece that is credited to a single artist; [[Andy Warhol]] engaged in this practice, supervising an [[assembly line]] [[silk screen]] process for his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/warhol/story/0,11478,648898,00.html |title=My 15 minutes | work=[[The Guardian (newspaper)|The Guardian]]|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref> However, when credit is established for the writer, the acknowledgement of their contribution is public domain and the writer in question would not be considered a ghostwriter.\n\n==Overview==\n\nA consultant or career-switcher may pay a ghostwriter to write a book on a topic in their professional area, to establish or enhance credibility as an 'expert' in their field. Public officials and [[politicians]] employ \"correspondence officers\" to respond to the large volume of official [[communication|correspondence]]. A number of papal [[encyclical]]s have been written by ghostwriters. A controversial and scientifically unethical practice is medical ghostwriting, where biotech or pharmaceutical companies pay professional writers to produce papers and then recruit (via payment or as a perk) other scientists or physicians to attach their names to these articles before they are published in medical or scientific journals. Some university and college students hire ghostwriters from [[essay mill]]s to write entrance essays, term papers, theses, and dissertations. This is largely considered unethical unless the actual ghostwriting work is just light editing.\n\nGhostwriters are hired for numerous reasons. In many cases, celebrities or public figures do not have the time, discipline, or writing skills to write and research a several hundred page autobiography or \"how-to\" book. Even if a celebrity or public figure has the writing skills to pen a short article, they may not know how to structure and edit a several hundred page book so that it is captivating and well-paced. In other cases, publishers use ghostwriters to increase the number of books that can be published each year under the name of well-known, highly marketable authors, or to quickly release a topical book that ties in with a recent or upcoming newsworthy event.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Quien no corre, vuela|url = http://www.zoomnews.es/40446/letras-y-tretas/quien-no-corre-vuela|website = ZoomNews|accessdate = 2015-11-14|language = es-ES|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015909/http://www.zoomnews.es/40446/letras-y-tretas/quien-no-corre-vuela|archivedate = 2015-11-17}}</ref>\n\n==Remuneration and credit==\n[[File:Hrcraad.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The ghostwriter for [[Hillary Clinton]]'s memoirs received a $500,000 fee for collaborating with her.]]\n\nGhostwriters will often spend from several months to a full year researching, writing, and editing [[nonfiction]] and [[fiction]] works for a client, and they are paid based on a price per hour, per word or per page, with a flat fee, a percentage of the royalties of the sales, or some combination thereof. [[Literary agent]] Madeleine Morel states that the average ghostwriter's advance for work for major book publishers is \"between $15,000 and $75,000\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bookwritinginc.com/blog/what-is-ghostwriting-complete-guide-ghostwriting/ |title=What is Ghostwriting?

One such market is the shorter book, best represented at the moment by Amazon's Kindle Singles imprint: texts of 30,000 words and under.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/sep/05/amazon-kindle-singles-short|title=The big short \u2013 why Amazon's Kindle Singles are the future|author=Julian Gough|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> Such a length would have been much harder to sell before digital reader-technologies became widely available, but is now quite acceptable.

Manhattan Literary, a ghostwriting company, states that \"book projects on the shorter side, tailored to new markets like the Kindle Singles imprint and others (30,000\u201342,000 words) start at a cost of $15,000\".<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/who-wrote-that-political-memoir-no-who-actually-wrote-it/2014/06/09/8e89ccae-f00a-11e3-9ebc-2ee6f81ed217_story.html|title=Who wrote that political memoir?

It was once financially impractical for publishers to produce such novella-length texts (they would have to charge too much); but this new market is, by 2015, already substantial and has been projected to be a solid part of the future of book publishing.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/> So, with its appearance the starting price for the professional book writer has come down by about half, but only if this shorter format makes sense for the client.\n\nOn the upper end of the spectrum, with celebrities that can all but guarantee a publisher large sales, the fees can be much higher. In 2001, the ''[[New York Times]]'' stated that the fee that the ghostwriter for [[Hillary Clinton]]'s memoirs would receive was probably about $500,000 of her book's $8 million advance, which \"is near the top of flat fees paid to collaborators\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E3DF153AF93BA35752C0A9679C8B63 | work=The New York Times | first=David D. | last=Kirkpatrick | title=Media Talk; Mrs.Clinton Seeks Ghostwriter for Memoirs | date=8 January 2001}}</ref>\n\nThere is also the consideration of different benchmarks in different countries. In Canada, The Writers' Union has established a minimum fee schedule for ghostwriting, starting at $40,000 for a 200 to 300 page book, paid at various stages of the drafting of the book. Research fees are an extra charge on top of this minimum fee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.writersunion.ca/content/ghost-writing|title=Ghost Writing|work=writersunion.ca|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801172621/http://www.writersunion.ca/content/ghost-writing|archivedate=2012-08-01}}</ref>\n\nA recent availability also exists, of outsourcing many kinds of jobs, including ghostwriting, to [[Offshoring|offshore]] locations like India, China, and the Philippines where the customer can save money.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-19476254|title=The globalisation of work - and people|work=BBC News}}</ref> The true tests of credibility\u2014the writer's track record, and samples of his or her craft\u2014become even more important in these instances, when the writer comes from a culture and first language that are entirely different from the client's.\n\nIn some cases, ghostwriters are allowed to share credit. For example, a common method is to put the client/author's name on a book cover as the main byline (by ''Author's Name'') and then to put the ghostwriter's name underneath it (as told to ''Ghostwriter's Name''). Sometimes this is done in lieu of pay or in order to decrease the amount of payment to the book ghostwriter for whom the credit has its own intrinsic value. Also, the ghostwriter can be cited as a co-author of a book, or listed in the movie or film credits when having ghostwritten the script or screenplay for film production.\n\nFor nonfiction books, the ghostwriter may be credited as a \"contributor\" or a \"research assistant\". In other cases, the ghostwriter receives no official credit for writing a book or article; in cases where the credited author or the [[publisher]] or both wish to conceal the ghostwriter's role, the ghostwriter may be asked to sign a [[nondisclosure contract]] that legally forbids any mention of the writer's role in a project. Some have made the distinction between \"author\" and \"writer\", as ghostwriter Kevin Anderson explains in a ''[[Washington Post]]'' interview: \"A ghostwriter is an interpreter and a translator, not an author, which is why our clients deserve full credit for authoring their books.\"<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\"/>\n\n==Types==\n\n===Nonfiction===\nGhostwriters are widely used by celebrities and public figures who wish to publish their autobiographies or memoirs. The degree of involvement of the ghostwriter in nonfiction writing projects ranges from minor to substantial. Various sources explain the role of the ghostwriter and how competent writers can get this kind of work. In some cases, a ghostwriter may be called in just to clean up, edit, and polish a rough draft of an autobiography or a \"how-to\" book. In other cases, the ghostwriter will write an entire book or article based on information, stories, notes, an outline, or interview sessions with the celebrity or public figure. The credited author also indicates to the ghostwriter what type of style, tone, or \"voice\" they want in the book.\n\nIn some cases, such as with some \"how-to\" books, diet guides, or cookbooks, a book will be entirely written by a ghostwriter, and the celebrity (e.g., a well-known musician or sports star) will be credited as author. Publishing companies use this strategy to increase the marketability of a book by associating it with a celebrity or well-known figure. In several countries before elections, candidates commission ghostwriters to produce autobiographies for them so as to gain visibility and exposure. Two of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s books are almost entirely credited to ghostwriters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2478/did-john-f-kennedy-really-write-profiles-in-courage|title=The Straight Dope: Did John F.

No, who actually wrote it?|work=washingtonpost.com|date=June 9, 2014|accessdate=September 26, 2017}}</ref>\n \nA consultant or career-switcher may pay to have a book ghostwritten on a topic in their professional area, to establish or enhance their credibility as an \"expert\" in their field. For example, a successful salesperson hoping to become a motivational speaker on selling may pay a ghostwriter to write a book on sales techniques. Often this type of book is published by a [[self-publishing press]] (or \"[[vanity press]]\"), which means that the author is paying to have the book published. This type of book is typically given away to prospective clients as a promotional tool, rather than being sold in bookstores.\n\n===Fiction===\nGhostwriters are employed by fiction publishers for several reasons. In some cases, publishers use ghostwriters to increase the number of books that can be published each year by a well-known, highly marketable author. Ghostwriters are mostly used to pen fiction works for well-known \"name\" authors in genres such as detective fiction, mysteries, and teen fiction.\n\nAdditionally, publishers use ghostwriters to write new books for established series where the \"author\" is a [[pseudonym]]. For example, the purported authors of the [[Nancy Drew]] and [[Hardy Boys]] mysteries, \"[[Carolyn Keene]]\" and \"[[Franklin W. Dixon]]\", respectively, are actually pseudonyms for a series of ghostwriters who write books in the same style using a template of basic information about the book's characters and their fictional universe (names, dates, speech patterns), and about the tone and style that are expected in the book (for more information, see the articles on pseudonyms or [[pen name]]<nowiki/>s). In addition, ghostwriters are often given copies of several of the previous books in the series to help them match the style.\n\nThe estate of romance novelist [[V. C. Andrews]] hired ghostwriter [[Andrew Neiderman]] to continue writing novels after her death, under her name and in a similar style to her original works. Many of action writer [[Tom Clancy]]'s books from the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]] bear the names of two people on their covers, with Clancy's name in larger print and the other author's name in smaller print. Various books bearing Clancy's name were written by different authors under the same pseudonym. The first two books in the ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell]]'' franchise were written by [[Raymond Benson]] under the pseudonym [[David Michaels (author)|David Michaels]].\n\nSometimes famous authors will ghostwrite for other celebrities as well, such as when [[H. P. Lovecraft]] ghostwrote \"Imprisoned with the Pharaohs\" (also known as \"Under the Pyramids\") for [[Harry Houdini]] in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' in the 1920s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\n===Religious===\nA number of papal [[encyclical]]s have been written by ghostwriters.

The [[European Medical Writers Association]] have published guidelines which aim to ensure professional medical writers carry out this role in an ethical and responsible manner.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Jacobs |first=A. |last2=Wager |first2=E. |title=European Medical Writers Association (EMWA) guidelines on the role of medical writers in developing peer-reviewed publications |journal=[[Current Medical Research and Opinion|Curr Med Res Opin]] |year=2005 |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=317\u2013321 |doi=10.1185/030079905x25578 }}</ref> The use of properly acknowledged medical writers is accepted as legitimate by organisations such as the World Association of Medical Editors<ref name=\"wame\"/> and the ''[[British Medical Journal]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://resources.bmj.com/bmj/authors/article-submission/article-requirements|title=Resources for authors|work=bmj.com|access-date=2008-01-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222214144/http://resources.bmj.com/bmj/authors/article-submission/article-requirements|archive-date=2008-02-22|url-status=dead}}</ref> Moreover, professional medical writers' expertise in presenting scientific data may be of benefit in producing better quality papers.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Schultz |first=H.

Nonetheless, the style, tone and content is modeled on that of the credited author. Many website ghostwriters are [[freelance]] but some are [[freelancer]]s who work under [[employment contract|contract]], as with [[radio presenter]]s and [[television presenter]]s. Occasionally [[Pseudonym#Literary pen names|a \"house pseudonym\", or collective name]] is used by the author of the website.\n\nSome celebrities, [[Chief executive officer|CEOs]], or public figures set up blog websites\u2014sometimes as a marketing, public relations, or lobbying tool. However, since these individuals are typically too busy to write their blog posts, they hire discreet ghostwriters to post to the blog under the celebrity or CEO's name. As with nonfiction ghostwriting, the blog ghostwriter models their writing style, content and tone on that of the credited author. This goes for social media as well. Many public figures have ghostwriters at least partially handle their [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] accounts, among others.<ref name=\"PC World\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2048479/whos-actually-writing-your-favorite-celebritys-tweets-.html|title=Who's actually writing your favorite celebrity's tweets?|author=Evan Dashevsky|date=16 December 2013|work=PC World}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n\n====Classical music and film scores====\n[[File:Martini bologna mozart 1777.jpg|thumb|upright|The Classical era composer [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] was paid to ghostwrite music for wealthy patrons who wished to give the impression that they were gifted composers.]]\n[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] is an example of a well-known composer who was paid to ghostwrite music for wealthy patrons. More recently, composers such as the UK-based Patric Standford (born in 1939) have ghostwritten for symphonic recordings and films such as the Rod McKuen Cello Concerto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.impulse-music.co.uk/standford.htm|title=Patric Standford|work=impulse-music.co.uk}}</ref> In the film industry, a music ghostwriter is a \"person who composes music for another composer but is not credited on the cue sheet or in the final product in any way.\" The practice is considered one of the \"dirty little secrets of the film and television music business\" that is considered unethical,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmusicmag.com/kb/glossary.php|title=Film & TV Music Knowledgebase :: Glossary of Film and TV Music Terms|work=filmmusicmag.com}}</ref> but has been common since the early stages of the film industry. In the early years of film, [[David Raksin]] worked as music ghostwriter and [[Orchestration|orchestrator]] for [[Charlie Chaplin]]; even though Chaplin was credited as the score writer, he was considered to be a \"hummer\" (pejorative film industry slang for a person who purports to be a film score composer but who in fact only gives a general idea of the melodies to a ghostwriter).\n\nThe practice is also common in television, as composers listed on cue sheets are entitled to music royalties every time an episode or theme score appears on television. A 1998 investigation by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' revealed that it was especially prevalent among animation companies such as [[Saban Entertainment]], [[DiC Entertainment|DiC]], [[Ruby-Spears Productions]] and [[Hanna-Barbera]], which often listed company executives as musicians for the purpose of royalties.<ref>\"Composers say they're paupers in royalty game\" - ''The Hollywood Reporter'' (1998)</ref> Several composers later filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Saban Entertainment president [[Haim Saban]], for allegedly taking ownership and credit for their musical compositions.\n\n====Popular music====\nMusical ghostwriting also occurs in [[popular music]]. When a record company wants to market an inexperienced young singer as a [[singer-songwriter]], or help a veteran bandleader coping with writer's block (or a lack of motivation to finish the next album), an experienced songwriter may be discreetly brought in to help.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} In other cases, a ghostwriter writes lyrics and a melody in the style of the credited musician, with little or no input from the credited musician. A ghostwriter providing this type of service may be thanked, without reference to the service provided, in the album credits, or they may be a true 'ghost', with no acknowledgement in the album.\n\nLegal disputes have arisen when musical ghostwriters have tried to claim royalties when an allegedly ghostwritten song becomes a money-making hit. In 1987, Darryl Neudorf was asked to work on a project for [[Nettwerk Productions]] involving a newly signed artist in their repertoire named [[Sarah McLachlan]]. This recording, the album ''[[Touch (Sarah McLachlan album)|Touch]]'', resulted in garnering the interest of [[Arista Records]]. She signed a multi-album contract with them and two of the songs that Neudorf worked on with her became commercial hits in [[Canada]]. In 1991, Neudorf was invited back to work with McLachlan on her second album, ''[[Solace (Sarah McLachlan album)|Solace]]''. In 1993, he filed a lawsuit against McLachlan and her label, [[Nettwerk]], alleging that he had made a significant and uncredited contribution to the songwriting on ''Touch'', and alleging that he wasn't paid properly for work done on ''Solace''. The judge in this suit eventually ruled in McLachlan's favour on the songs; though Neudorf may have contributed to the [[songwriting]], neither regarded each other as joint authors. The judge ruled in Neudorf's favour on the payment issue.\n\n[[File: Chuck D. Slakthuset i Malm\u00f6 1991.jpg|thumb|250px|left|upright|[[Chuck D]] of [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] has offered a more positive view of ghostwriting in hip hop.]]\nIn [[hip hop music]], the increasing use of ghostwriters by high-profile hip hop stars has led to controversy. Critics view the increasing use of hip hop ghostwriters as the \"perversion of hip-hop by commerce.\" This is because of the limiting definition of \"rapping\" as \"...about you expressing yourself through your own words, not someone else\u2019s.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gelfmagazine.com/archives/hiphops_ghostwriters.php|title=Gelf Magazine Hip-Hop's Ghostwriters|work=gelfmagazine.com}}</ref> [[Chuck D]] of [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] thinks this point of view is mistaken because \"...not everyone is equipped to be a lyricist and not everyone is equipped to be a vocalist.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Books of Rhymes: The Poetics of Hip Hop|first=Adam|last=Bradley|page=153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YkGXXDZsFHcC&pg=PA151&lpg=PA151&dq=book+of+rhymes+the+poetics+of+hip+hop+ghostwriter&source=bl&ots=TBx9S8aMaM&sig=wUcAYQdgCno2j58a7dBgz-93IT8&hl=en&ei=InOiS6qhNMmUtgf34aTuCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CA0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=&f=false}}</ref> He points out that creating a rap song may require multiple talents. [[Frank Ocean]] started his career as a ghostwriter for artists such as [[Justin Bieber]], [[John Legend]] and [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]].\n\nCurrently in hip-hop, the credit given to ghostwriters varies: \"silent pens might sign confidentiality clauses, appear obliquely in the liner notes, or discuss their participation freely.\" In some cases, liner notes credit individuals for \"vocal arrangement\", which may be a euphemism for ghostwriting. In the early 2010s, hip-hop ghostwriting services like [[Rap Rebirth]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/07/03/137559845/no-flow-rap-rebirth-can-help|title=Stamberg Raps! And Other Tales From A Hip-Hop Ghostwriter|date=2 July 2011|work=NPR.org}}</ref> have appeared online, which provide recording artists who wish to purchase ghostwritten rhymes a greater degree of anonymity.\n\n===Visual art===\nGhost-authorship also applies to the visual arts, most commonly paintings. The extent of the master artist's contribution varies widely, as little as composition adjustments and corrective brush strokes, or as much as entire works. A common practice is the use of art instruction class milieu in which the master artist makes significant contributions to the work of the student who then signs that work as his or her own. Services addressing complete works have historically been highly confidential. Less prevalent are advertised commercial services which may use the term \"vanity artwork\" as suggestive of \"vanity publishing\".\n{{Clear}}\n\n===As blacklisting countermeasure===\nIn countries where the freedom of speech is not upheld and authors that have somehow displeased the ruling regime are \"blacklisted\" (i.e. forbidden from having their works published), the blacklisted authors or composers may ghostwrite material for other authors or composers who are in the good graces of the regime.

Since her career beginnings as an independent artist, Del Rey has recorded clips of herself singing along to her songs on webcams and juxtaposed them alongside vintage home videos and films to serve as \"homemade music videos\", a style which helped gained her early recognition. Following her early success, Del Rey had a series of high budget music videos including the videos for \"Born To Die\" and \"National Anthem\" (both 2012) and \"Young and Beautiful\" (2013), both of which incorporated elements of 90s cult films while paying tribute to aspects of Americana and New York hip-hop cultures. Her following videos for tracks such as \"Summer Wine\", \"Carmen\", and \"Summertime Sadness\" were all produced off of significantly lower budgets and retained more elements of Del Rey's earlier style. The ''Ultraviolence'' era incorporated an admixture of high budget videos and self-made ones, while the ''Honeymoon'' era was almost strictly film noir-influenced professionally shot visuals. Both eras saw some of Del Rey's homemade videos for tracks such as \"Pretty When You Cry\" and \"Honeymoon\" going unreleased due to Del Rey stating they were \"too boring\" with \"nothing happening\" in them. The ''Lust For Life'' era was widely characterized for its futuristic flare in its mildly filtered vintage-inspired look. For ''Norman Fucking Rockwell'', Del Rey's sister, Chuck Grant, directed three of the videos in Del Rey's \"homemade video\" format, while Rich Lee directed the two follow-ups in a similar vintage but futuristic manner, as he had the videos on ''Lust for Life''\n\nSince her debut, Del Rey has repeatedly collaborated with the same people on her visuals. Among the most notably include directors Anthony Mandler, Rich Lee, Anthony Schumer, Jake Nava, and Francesco Carrozzini, as well as photographers Chuck Grant and Neil Krug. She has also used the same love interests in her videos more than once, most notably [[Bradley Soileau]] (appeared in three videos) and [[Mark Mahoney]] (appeared in two), while her backup dancers Kira Alger and Alexa Kaye have appeared in four and five videos, respectively.\n\nCritics have noted Del Rey for her typically simple, but authentic live performances.<ref name=caramanica>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/arts/music/lana-del-rey-lust-for-life-live-review.html|work=The New York Times|title=Review: Lana Del Rey, a Character No More|date=September 6, 2017|accessdate=September 6, 2017|author=Caramanica, Jon}}</ref> A September 2017 concert review published in ''The New York Times'' noted: \"For more than an hour, Ms. Del Rey was eerily casual, singing and smiling with the ease of someone performing at singer-songwriter night at the local coffee shop.\"<ref name=caramanica/> Another review by Roy Train published in ''The Hollywood Reporter'' in 2014 noted \"a distance in her bonhomie, obvious even from my perch at the opposite end of the stage high above the fray, the chill still palpable.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/concert-review-lana-del-rey-708719|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|title=Lana Del Rey Will be Your Mirror: Concert Review|last=Trakin|first=Roy|date=June 2, 2014|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Public image==\n===Early reception===\n[[File:Lana Del Rey @ Plaza.jpg|upright|left|thumb|250px|Del Rey performing at [[Irving Plaza]] in June 2012]]\nPrior to the release of her debut major label album ''Born to Die'' in 2012, Del Rey was the subject of several articles discussing her image and career trajectory.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/why-we-fight/8679-the-imagination-of-lana-del-rey|work=Pitchfork|title=The Imagination of Lana Del Rey|date=September 30, 2011|author=Abebe, Nitsuh|accessdate=July 31, 2017}}</ref><ref name=stranger/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/2012/01/deconstructing-lana-del-rey/|work=Spin|title=Deconstructing Lana Del Rey|date=January 30, 2012|author=Hopper, Jessica|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref> One article by Paul Harris published by ''The Guardian'' just a week before the album's release noted the differences between Del Rey's perceived persona in 2008, when she performed as Lizzy Grant, and in the present, as Lana Del Rey.<ref name=stranger>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jan/21/lana-del-rey-pop|work=The Guardian|title=Lana Del Rey: The strange story of the star who rewrote her past|author=Harris, Paul|date=January 21, 2012|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref> Harris wrote: <blockquote>The internet has allowed figures like [Del Rey] to come rapidly to the fore of the cultural landscape, whether or not their emergence is planned by a record executive or happens spontaneously from someone's bedroom.

This reveals a cultural obsession with the \"authenticity\" that fans, artists and corporations all prize above all else.<ref name=\"stranger\"/></blockquote>[[Blockhead (music producer)|Tony Simon]], a producer who had worked with Del Rey in 2009, defended her against the public claims of inauthenticity and allegations that she was a product of her record label: \"To be clear, all the detractors saying she's some made-up-by-the-machine pop star are full of shit. While it's impossible to keep the businesses' hands out the pop when creating a pop star, the roots of where this all comes from are firmly inside of Lizzy Grant.\"<ref name=hellyer/> In Del Rey's own words, she \"[n]ever had a persona.

I came off sort of nervously, and there was just a lot of dualities, a lot of juxtapositions going on that maybe just felt like something was a little off.

Since her career beginnings as an independent artist, Del Rey has recorded clips of herself singing along to her songs on webcams and juxtaposed them alongside vintage home videos and films to serve as \"homemade music videos\", a style which helped gained her early recognition. Following her early success, Del Rey had a series of high budget music videos including the videos for \"Born To Die\" and \"National Anthem\" (both 2012) and \"Young and Beautiful\" (2013), both of which incorporated elements of 90s cult films while paying tribute to aspects of Americana and New York hip-hop cultures. Her following videos for tracks such as \"Summer Wine\", \"Carmen\", and \"Summertime Sadness\" were all produced off of significantly lower budgets and retained more elements of Del Rey's earlier style. The ''Ultraviolence'' era incorporated an admixture of high budget videos and self-made ones, while the ''Honeymoon'' era was almost strictly film noir-influenced professionally shot visuals. Both eras saw some of Del Rey's homemade videos for tracks such as \"Pretty When You Cry\" and \"Honeymoon\" going unreleased due to Del Rey stating they were \"too boring\" with \"nothing happening\" in them. The ''Lust For Life'' era was widely characterized for its futuristic flare in its mildly filtered vintage-inspired look. For ''Norman Fucking Rockwell'', Del Rey's sister, Chuck Grant, directed three of the videos in Del Rey's \"homemade video\" format, while Rich Lee directed the two follow-ups in a similar vintage but futuristic manner, as he had the videos on ''Lust for Life''\n\nSince her debut, Del Rey has repeatedly collaborated with the same people on her visuals. Among the most notably include directors Anthony Mandler, Rich Lee, Anthony Schumer, Jake Nava, and Francesco Carrozzini, as well as photographers Chuck Grant and Neil Krug. She has also used the same love interests in her videos more than once, most notably [[Bradley Soileau]] (appeared in three videos) and [[Mark Mahoney]] (appeared in two), while her backup dancers Kira Alger and Alexa Kaye have appeared in four and five videos, respectively.\n\nCritics have noted Del Rey for her typically simple, but authentic live performances.<ref name=caramanica>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/arts/music/lana-del-rey-lust-for-life-live-review.html|work=The New York Times|title=Review: Lana Del Rey, a Character No More|date=September 6, 2017|accessdate=September 6, 2017|author=Caramanica, Jon}}</ref> A September 2017 concert review published in ''The New York Times'' noted: \"For more than an hour, Ms. Del Rey was eerily casual, singing and smiling with the ease of someone performing at singer-songwriter night at the local coffee shop.\"<ref name=caramanica/> Another review by Roy Train published in ''The Hollywood Reporter'' in 2014 noted \"a distance in her bonhomie, obvious even from my perch at the opposite end of the stage high above the fray, the chill still palpable.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/concert-review-lana-del-rey-708719|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|title=Lana Del Rey Will be Your Mirror: Concert Review|last=Trakin|first=Roy|date=June 2, 2014|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Public image==\n===Early reception===\n[[File:Lana Del Rey @ Plaza.jpg|upright|left|thumb|250px|Del Rey performing at [[Irving Plaza]] in June 2012]]\nPrior to the release of her debut major label album ''Born to Die'' in 2012, Del Rey was the subject of several articles discussing her image and career trajectory.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/why-we-fight/8679-the-imagination-of-lana-del-rey|work=Pitchfork|title=The Imagination of Lana Del Rey|date=September 30, 2011|author=Abebe, Nitsuh|accessdate=July 31, 2017}}</ref><ref name=stranger/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/2012/01/deconstructing-lana-del-rey/|work=Spin|title=Deconstructing Lana Del Rey|date=January 30, 2012|author=Hopper, Jessica|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref> One article by Paul Harris published by ''The Guardian'' just a week before the album's release noted the differences between Del Rey's perceived persona in 2008, when she performed as Lizzy Grant, and in the present, as Lana Del Rey.<ref name=stranger>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jan/21/lana-del-rey-pop|work=The Guardian|title=Lana Del Rey: The strange story of the star who rewrote her past|author=Harris, Paul|date=January 21, 2012|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref> Harris wrote: <blockquote>The internet has allowed figures like [Del Rey] to come rapidly to the fore of the cultural landscape, whether or not their emergence is planned by a record executive or happens spontaneously from someone's bedroom.

This reveals a cultural obsession with the \"authenticity\" that fans, artists and corporations all prize above all else.<ref name=\"stranger\"/></blockquote>[[Blockhead (music producer)|Tony Simon]], a producer who had worked with Del Rey in 2009, defended her against the public claims of inauthenticity and allegations that she was a product of her record label: \"To be clear, all the detractors saying she's some made-up-by-the-machine pop star are full of shit. While it's impossible to keep the businesses' hands out the pop when creating a pop star, the roots of where this all comes from are firmly inside of Lizzy Grant.\"<ref name=hellyer/> In Del Rey's own words, she \"[n]ever had a persona.

I came off sort of nervously, and there was just a lot of dualities, a lot of juxtapositions going on that maybe just felt like something was a little off.

During the rule of K\u00e1rolyi's pacifist cabinet, Hungary lost the control over approx. 75% of its former pre-WW1 territories (325 411&nbsp;km\u00b2) without fight and was subject to foreign occupation. The [[Little Entente]], sensing an opportunity, invaded the country from three sides\u2014Romania [[Hungarian-Romanian War|invaded]] [[Transylvania]], Czechoslovakia annexed [[Upper Hungary]] (today's Slovakia), and a joint [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serb]]-[[French Army|French]] coalition annexed [[Vojvodina]] and other southern regions.

Though free elections continued, Horthy's personality, and those of his personally selected prime ministers, dominated the political scene. The government's actions continued to drift right with the passage of antisemitic laws and, due to the continued isolation of the Little Entente, economic and then political gravitation toward [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. The [[Great Depression]] further exacerbated the situation and the popularity of fascist politicians such as [[Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s]] and [[Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi]], promising economic and social recovery, rose.\n\nHorthy's nationalist agenda reached its apogee in 1938 and 1940, when the Nazis rewarded Hungary's staunchly pro-Germany foreign policy in the [[First Vienna Award|First]] and [[Second Vienna Award]]s, respectively, peacefully restoring ethnic-Hungarian-majority areas lost after Trianon.

The Soviet leadership selected [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi]] to front the [[Stalinization]] of the country, and R\u00e1kosi ''de facto'' ruled Hungary from 1949 to 1956. His government's policies of militarization, industrialization, collectivization, and war compensation led to a severe decline in living standards. In imitation of Stalin's [[KGB]], the R\u00e1kosi government established a secret political police, the [[State Protection Authority|\u00c1VH]], to enforce the new regime. In the ensuing purges approximately 350,000 officials and intellectuals were imprisoned or executed from 1948 to 1956.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tamupress.com/product/First-Domino,4091.aspx |title=Granville/ frm |format=PDF |accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref> Many freethinkers, democrats, and Horthy-era dignitaries were secretly arrested and extrajudicially interned in domestic and foreign [[Gulag]]s.

The following political cooling saw the ascent of [[Imre Nagy]] to the premiership, and the growing interest of students and intellectuals in political life. Nagy promised market liberalization and political openness, while R\u00e1kosi opposed both vigorously. R\u00e1kosi eventually managed to discredit Nagy and replace him with the more hard-line [[Ern\u0151 Ger\u0151]]. Hungary joined the [[Warsaw Pact]] in May 1955, as societal dissatisfaction with the regime swelled. Following the firing on peaceful demonstrations by Soviet soldiers and secret police, and rallies throughout the country on 23 October 1956, protesters took to the streets in Budapest, initiating the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Revolution]]. In an effort to quell the chaos, Nagy returned as premier, promised free elections, and took Hungary out of the Warsaw Pact.\n\nThe violence nonetheless continued as revolutionary militias sprung up against the Soviet Army and the \u00c1VH; the roughly 3,000-strong resistance fought Soviet tanks using [[Molotov cocktail]]s and machine-pistols. Though the preponderance of the Soviets was immense, they suffered heavy losses, and by 30 October 1956 most Soviet troops had withdrawn from Budapest to garrison the countryside. For a time, the Soviet leadership was unsure how to respond to developments in Hungary, but eventually decided to intervene to prevent a destabilization of the Soviet bloc. On 4 November reinforcements of more than 150,000 troops and 2,500 tanks entered the country from the Soviet Union.<ref>Findley, Carter V., and John Rothney. ''Twentieth Century World''. sixth ed. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2006. 278.</ref> Nearly 20,000 Hungarians were killed resisting the intervention, while an additional 21,600 were imprisoned afterwards for political reasons. Some 13,000 were interned and 230 brought to trial and executed. Nagy was secretly tried, found guilty, sentenced to death and executed by hanging in June 1958. Because borders were briefly opened, nearly a quarter of a million people fled the country by the time the revolution was suppressed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6065398.stm \"Hungary's 1956 brain drain\"], BBC News, 23 October 2006</ref>\n\n==== K\u00e1d\u00e1r era 1956\u20131988 ====\n{{See also|Goulash Communism}}\n[[File:J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r 1962.jpg|thumb|upright|[[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]], General Secretary of MSZMP, the [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party]] (1956\u20131988)]]\n\nAfter a second, briefer period of Soviet military occupation, [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]], Nagy's former Minister of State, was chosen by the Soviet leadership to head the new government and chair the new ruling [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist Workers' Party]] (MSzMP). K\u00e1d\u00e1r quickly normalized the situation. In 1963, the government granted a general amnesty and released the majority of those imprisoned for their active participation in the uprising. K\u00e1d\u00e1r proclaimed a new policy line, according to which the people were no longer compelled to profess loyalty to the party if they tacitly accepted the Socialist regime as a fact of life. In many speeches, he described this as, \"Those who are not against us are with us.\" K\u00e1d\u00e1r introduced new planning priorities in the economy, such as allowing farmers significant plots of private land within the collective farm system (''h\u00e1zt\u00e1ji gazd\u00e1lkod\u00e1s''). The living standard rose as consumer good and food production took precedence over military production, which was reduced to one tenth of pre-revolutionary levels.\n\nIn 1968, the [[New Economic Mechanism]] (NEM) introduced free-market elements into socialist command economy. From the 1960s through the late 1980s, Hungary was often referred to as \"[[the happiest barrack]]\" within the [[Eastern bloc]]. During the latter part of the Cold War Hungary's [[GDP per capita]] was fourth only to [[East Germany]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], and the Soviet Union itself.<ref name=\"madison185\">*{{Cite book|last=Maddison|first=Angus |title=The world economy|publisher=OECD Publishing|year=2006|isbn=978-92-64-02261-4|page=185}}</ref> As a result of this relatively high standard of living, a more liberalized economy, a less censored press, and less restricted travel rights, Hungary was generally considered one of the more liberal countries in which to live in Central Europe during communism.

Although the MSzMP began [[Hungarian Round Table Talks|Round Table Talks]] with various opposition groups in March 1989, the reburial of Imre Nagy as a revolutionary martyr that June is widely considered the symbolic end of communism in Hungary. Over 100,000 people attended the Budapest ceremony without any significant government interference, and many speakers openly called for Soviet troops to leave the country. Free elections were held [[1990 Hungarian parliamentary election|in May 1990]], and the [[Hungarian Democratic Forum]], a major conservative opposition group, was elected to the head of a coalition government. [[J\u00f3zsef Antall]] became the first democratically elected Prime Minister since World War II.\n\nWith the removal of state subsidies and rapid privatization in 1991, Hungary was affected by a severe economic recession. The Antall government's austerity measures proved unpopular, and the Communist Party's legal and political heir, the [[Hungarian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], won the subsequent [[1994 Hungarian parliamentary election|1994 elections]]. This abrupt shift in the political landscape was repeated in [[1998 Hungarian parliamentary election|1998]] and [[2002 Hungarian parliamentary election|2002]]; each electoral cycle, the governing party was ousted and the erstwhile opposition elected. Like most other post-communist European states, however, Hungary broadly pursued an [[European integration|integrationist]] agenda, [[Enlargement of NATO|joining]] [[NATO]] in 1999 and the European Union [[2003 Hungarian European Union membership referendum|in 2004]]. As a NATO member, Hungary was involved in the [[Yugoslav Wars]].\n\nIn 2006, [[2006 protests in Hungary|major protests]] erupted after it was revealed that Prime Minister [[Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny]] had claimed in [[\u0150sz\u00f6d speech|a private speech]] that [[Hungarian Socialist Party|his party]] \"lied\" to win the [[2006 Hungarian parliamentary election|recent elections]].

The legislature consequently approved a [[Constitution of Hungary|new constitution]], among other sweeping governmental and legal changes.

These include the very eastern stretch of the [[Alps]], ''[[Alpokalja]]'', in the west of the country, the [[Transdanubian Mountains]] in the central region of Transdanubia, and the [[Mecsek]] Mountains and [[Vill\u00e1ny Mountains]] in the south.

The body is divided into county police departments which are also divided into regional and town police departments. The National Police also have subordinate agencies with nationwide jurisdiction, such as the \"Nemzeti Nyomoz\u00f3 Iroda\" (National Bureau of Investigation), a civilian police force specialised in investigating serious crimes, and the gendarmerie-like, militarised \"K\u00e9szenl\u00e9ti Rend\u0151rs\u00e9g\" (Stand-by Police) mainly dealing with riots and often reinforcing local police forces. Due to Hungary's accession to the [[Schengen Treaty]], the Police and Border Guards were merged into a single national corps, with the Border Guards becoming Police Officers. This merger took place in January 2008.

Stephen promulgated [[Roman Catholicism]] as the state religion, and his successors were traditionally known as the [[Apostolic King]]s. The [[Catholic Church in Hungary]] remained strong through the centuries, and the [[Archbishop of Esztergom]] was granted extraordinary temporal privileges as [[prince-primate]] (''hercegpr\u00edm\u00e1s'') of Hungary. \n\nAlthough contemporary Hungary has no [[official religion]] and recognizes [[freedom of religion]] as a fundamental right, the Hungarian constitution \"recognizes Christianity's nation-building role\" in its preamble<ref>{{cite web|title=Magyarorsz\u00e1g Alapt\u00f6rv\u00e9nye|url=http://www.parlament.hu/irom39/02627/02627.pdf|website=Parlament.hu|publisher=Hungarian Parliament|accessdate=2 August 2014}}</ref> and in Article VII affirms that \"the state may cooperate with the churches for community goals.\"<ref>[https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Hungary_2011.pdf Hungary's Constitution of 2011]</ref>\n\nDuring the initial stages of the [[Protestant Reformation]], most Hungarians took up, first, [[Lutheranism]], then [[Calvinism]] in the form of the [[Hungarian Reformed Church]]. In the second half of the 16th century, the [[Jesuits]] led a [[Counterreformation]] campaign and the population once again became predominantly Catholic. This campaign was only partially successful, however, and the (mainly Reformed) Hungarian nobility were able to secure freedom of worship for Christians. In practice this meant ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]''; thus, most individual localities in Hungary are still identifiable as historically Catholic, Lutheran, or Reformed. The country's eastern regions, especially around [[Debrecen]] (the \"Calvinist Rome\"), remain almost completely [[Reformed]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reformatus.hu/mutat/6819/ |title=Facts and Statistics |publisher=Reformatus.hu |date=4 March 2013 |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref> a trait they share with historically contiguous [[Hungarians in Romania|ethnically Hungarian regions]] across the Romanian border. \n\n[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] in Hungary is associated with the country's ethnic minorities:[[Armenians]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Greeks]], [[Romanians]], [[Rusyns]], [[Ukrainians]], and [[Serbs]].\n\nHistorically, Hungary was home to a significant Jewish community.

In contrast to Historicism, Hungarian Art Nouveau is based on the national architectural characteristics. Taking the eastern origins of the Hungarians into account, [[\u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner]] (1845\u20131914), the most important figure in Hungarian Art Nouveau, was initially inspired by Indian and Syrian architecture, and later by traditional Hungarian decorative designs. In this way, he created an original synthesis of architectural styles. By applying them to three-dimensional architectural elements, he produced a version of Art Nouveau that was specific to Hungary.\n\nTurning away from the style of Lechner, yet taking inspiration from his approach, the group of \"Young People\" (''Fiatalok''), which included [[K\u00e1roly K\u00f3s]] and Dezs\u00f6 Zrumeczky, were to use the characteristic structures and forms of traditional Hungarian architecture to achieve the same end.\n\n[[File:Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest).jpg|thumb|The [[Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Applied Arts]], an [[Art Nouveau]] building designed by [[\u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner]]]]\n\nBesides the two principal styles, Budapest also displays local versions of trends originating from other European countries. The Sezession from [[Vienna]], the German [[Jugendstil]], Art Nouveau from Belgium and France, and the influence of English and Finnish architecture are all reflected in the buildings constructed at the turn of the 20th century. [[B\u00e9la Lajta]] initially adopted Lechner's style, subsequently drawing his inspiration from English and Finnish trends; after developing an interest in the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] style, he finally arrived at modern architecture. [[Alad\u00e1r \u00c1rkay]] took almost the same route. [[Istv\u00e1n Medgyaszay]] developed his own style, which differed from Lechner's, using stylised traditional motifs to create decorative designs in concrete. In the sphere of applied arts, those chiefly responsible for promoting the spread of Art Nouveau were the School and Museum of Decorative Arts, which opened in 1896.\n\nForeigners have unexpectedly \"discovered\" that a significantly large portion of the citizens live in old and architecturally valuable buildings.

Other renowned composers are [[Ern\u0151 Dohn\u00e1nyi|Dohn\u00e1nyi]], [[Franz Schmidt]], [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]], [[Gabriel von Wayditch]], [[Rudolf Wagner-R\u00e9geny]], [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Lajtha]], [[Franz Leh\u00e1r]], [[Imre K\u00e1lm\u00e1n]], [[S\u00e1ndor Veress]] and [[Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa|R\u00f3zsa]]. Hungarian traditional music tends to have a strong [[dactyl (poetry)|dactylic]] rhythm, as the language is invariably stressed on the first syllable of each word.\n\nHungary has renowned composers of contemporary classical music, [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]], [[Gy\u00f6rgy Kurt\u00e1g]], [[Peter E\u00f6tv\u00f6s|P\u00e9ter E\u00f6tv\u00f6s]], [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]] and [[Zolt\u00e1n Jeney]] among them. One of the greatest Hungarian composers, [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], was also among the most significant musicians of the 20th century. His music was invigorated by the themes, modes, and rhythmic patterns of the Hungarian and neighboring folk music traditions he studied, which he synthesized with influences from his contemporaries into his own distinctive style.<ref>[http://mek.oszk.hu/02100/02172/html/index.html Szabolcsi] Although the Hungarian upper class has long had cultural and political connections with the rest of Europe, leading to an influx of European musical ideas, the rural peasants maintained their own traditions such that by the end of the 19th century Hungarian composers could draw on rural peasant music to (re)create a Hungarian classical style.

Since then, however, the Hungarian music industry has begun to recover, producing successful performers in the fields of [[jazz]] such as trumpeter [[Rudolf Tomsits]], pianist-composer [[K\u00e1roly Binder]] and, in a modernized form of Hungarian folk, [[Ferenc Seb\u0151]] and [[M\u00e1rta Sebesty\u00e9n]].

It is also the oldest surviving [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] poem.<br />\nAmong the first chronicles about Hungarian history were [[Gesta Hungarorum]] (\"Deeds of the Hungarians\") by the unknown author usually called ''Anonymus'', and [[Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum]] (\"Deeds of the Huns and the Hungarians\") by Simon K\u00e9zai. Both are in Latin. These chronicles mix history with legends, so historically they are not always authentic. Another chronicle is the ''K\u00e9pes kr\u00f3nika'' (Illustrated Chronicle), which was written for [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]].\n[[File:K\u00e9pes Kr\u00f3nika 1360.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Chronicon Pictum]], a medieval illustrated chronicle from the 14th century]]\n[[Renaissance]] literature flourished under the reign of [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|King Matthias]] (1458\u20131490). [[Janus Pannonius]], although he wrote in Latin, counts as one of the most important persons in Hungarian literature, being the only significant Hungarian Humanist poet of the period. The first printing house was also founded during Matthias' reign, by [[Andr\u00e1s Hess]], in Buda. The first book printed in Hungary was the [[Chronica Hungarorum]].\nThe most important poets of the period was [[B\u00e1lint Balassi]] (1554\u20131594) and [[Nikola Zrinski|Mikl\u00f3s Zr\u00ednyi]] (1620\u20131664).\n\nBalassi's poetry shows medieval influences, his poems can be divided into three sections: love poems, war poems and religious poems. Zr\u00ednyi's most significant work, the epic ''[[Peril of Sziget|Szigeti veszedelem]]'' (\"Peril of Sziget\", written in 1648/49) is written in a fashion similar to the ''[[Iliad]]'', and recounts the heroic [[Battle of Szigetv\u00e1r]], where his great-grandfather died while defending the castle of Szigetv\u00e1r.\nAmong the religious literary works the most important is the Bible translation by [[G\u00e1sp\u00e1r K\u00e1roli]] (The second Hungarian Bible translation in the history), the Protestant pastor of [[G\u00f6nc]], in 1590. The translation is called the ''Bible of Vizsoly'', after the town where it was first published.

The greatest poets of the time were [[Mih\u00e1ly Csokonai Vit\u00e9z]] and [[D\u00e1niel Berzsenyi]].\nThe greatest figure of the language reform was [[Ferenc Kazinczy]]. The [[Hungarian language]] became feasible for all type of scientific explanations from this time, and furthermore many new words were coined for describing new inventions.\n\n[[Hungarian literature]] has recently gained some renown outside the borders of Hungary (mostly through translations into German, French and English). Some modern Hungarian authors have become increasingly popular in Germany and Italy especially [[S\u00e1ndor M\u00e1rai]], [[P\u00e9ter Esterh\u00e1zy]], [[P\u00e9ter N\u00e1das]] and [[Imre Kert\u00e9sz]].

Unicum is a bitter, dark-coloured liqueur that can be drunk as an ap\u00e9ritif or after a meal, thus helping the digestion.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://zwackunicum.hu/en/markaink/unicum/|title= Unicum|publisher=[[Zwack]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Recreation ===\n[[File:H\u00e9v\u00edz.jpg|thumb|[[Lake H\u00e9v\u00edz]], the largest thermal lake in Europe]]\nHungary is a land of [[thermal]] water. A passion for spa culture and [[Hungarian history]] have been connected from the very beginning. Hungarian spas feature [[ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Greek architecture|Greek]], [[Architecture of Turkey|Turkish]], and northern country architectural elements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitspas.eu/hungary/ |title=Hungary (Magyarorsz\u00e1g) \u2013 spa resorts & hotels |publisher=Visitspas.eu |accessdate=18 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nBecause of an advantageous geographical location, good quality thermal water can be found in great quantities on over 80% of Hungary's territory. Approximately 1,500 thermal springs can be found in Hungary (more than 100 just in the Capital area). There are approximately 450 public baths in Hungary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.umvp.eu/english/about-hungary.html|title=New Hungary Rural Development Programme|website=Umvp.eu|access-date=23 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[ancient Rome|Romans]] heralded the first age of spas in Hungary. The remains of their bath complexes are still to be seen in [[\u00d3buda]]. Spa culture was revived during the [[Turkish Invasion]] and the thermal springs of [[Buda]] were used for the construction of a number of bathhouses, some of which such as ([[Kir\u00e1ly Baths]], [[Rudas Baths]]) are still functioning.\n\nIn the 19th century, the advancement in deep drilling and medical science provided the springboard for a further leap in bathing culture. Grand spas such as [[Gell\u00e9rt Baths]], Luk\u00e1cs Baths, [[Margaret Island]], and [[Sz\u00e9chenyi Medicinal Bath]] are a reflection of this resurgence in popularity. The Sz\u00e9chenyi Thermal Bath is the largest spa complex in Europe and it was the first thermal bath built in the Pest side of Budapest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ticket.info.hu/en/program/baths-of-budapest/szechenyi-bath|title=Sz\u00e9chenyi Bath|publisher=Hung\u00e1ria Koncert Kft.|accessdate=13 July 2015|location=Budapest}}</ref> This building is a noted example of modern Renaissance style.

Cs\u00e1rd\u00e1s is the Hungarian name for the national dances, with Hungarian embroidered costumes and energetic music. From the men's intricate bootslapping dances to the ancient women's circle dances, Cs\u00e1rd\u00e1s demonstrates the infectious exuberance of the Hungarian folk dancing still celebrated in the villages.\n\n[[Verbunkos]] is a solo man's dance evolved from the recruiting performances of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] army.\n\nThe [[Leg\u00e9nyes]] is a men's solo dance done by the ethnic Hungarian people living in the [[Kalotaszeg]] region of Transylvania. Although usually danced by young men, it can be also danced by older men. The dance is generally performed freestyle by one dancer at a time in front of a band. Women participate in the dance by standing in lines to the side, and singing or shouting verses while the men dance. Each man performs a number of points (dance phrases), typically four to eight without repetition. Each point consists of four parts, each lasting four counts. The first part is usually the same for everyone (there are only a few variations).\n\nIt was in the beginning of the 18th-century that the present style of Hungarian folk art took shape, incorporating both [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] elements, depending on the area, as well as Persian [[Sassanide]] influences. Flowers and leaves, sometimes a bird or a spiral ornament, are the principal decorative themes. The most frequent ornament is a flower with a centerpiece resembling the eye of a peacock's feather.\n\nNearly all the manifestations of folk art practiced elsewhere in Europe also flourished among the [[hungarian people|Magyar]] peasantry at one time or another, their ceramics and textile being the most highly developed of all.\n\nThe finest achievements in their textile arts are the embroideries which vary from region to region. Those of [[Kalotaszeg]] in Transylvania are charming products of Oriental design, sewn chiefly in a single color&nbsp;\u2013 red, blue, or black. Soft in line, the embroideries are applied on altar cloths, pillow-cases and sheets.\n\nIn Hungary proper, S\u00e1rk\u00f6z in [[Transdanubia]] and the [[Mez\u0151k\u00f6vesd|Maty\u00f3f\u00f6ld]] in the [[Great Hungarian Plain]] produce the finest embroideries. In the [[Tolna (county)|S\u00e1rk\u00f6z]] region the women's caps show black and white designs as delicate as lace, and give evidence of the people's wonderfully subtle artistic feeling. The embroidery motifs applied to women's wear have also been transposed to tablecloths and runners suitable for modern use as wall decorations.\n\nThese vessels, made of black clay, reflect more than three hundred years of traditional Transdanubian folk patterns and shapes. No two are precisely alike, since all work is done by hand, including both the shaping and the decorating. The imprints are made by the thumb or a finger of the ceramist who makes the piece.\n\n=== Porcelain ===\n{{Main|Herend Porcelain|Zsolnay}}\nFounded in 1826, [[Herend Porcelain]] is one of the world's largest ceramic factories, specializing in luxury hand painted and gilded [[porcelain]]. In the mid-19th century it was purveyor to the [[Habsburg Dynasty]] and aristocratic customers throughout Europe. Many of its classic patterns are still in production. After the fall of communism in Hungary, the factory was privatised and is now 75% owned by its management and workers, exporting to over 60 countries of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.herend.com/ |title=Herend Porcelain Manufactory Ltd |publisher=Herend.com |accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nZsolnay Porcelain Manufacture is a Hungarian manufacturer of porcelain, pottery, ceramics, tiles and stoneware. The company introduced the eosin glazing process and pyrogranite ceramics.\nThe Zsolnay factory was established by Mikl\u00f3s Zsolnay in [[P\u00e9cs]], Hungary, to produce stoneware and ceramics in 1853. In 1863, his son, [[Vilmos Zsolnay]] (1828\u20131900) joined the company and became its manager and director after several years. He led the factory to worldwide recognition by demonstrating its innovative products at world fairs and international exhibitions, including the 1873 World Fair in Vienna, then at the 1878 World Fair in Paris, where Zsolnay received a Grand Prix.\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{See also|Hungary at the Olympics}}\n[[File:Vaterpolo Hungary vs Italy semifinal game2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hungary men's national water polo team]] is considered among the best in the world, holding the world record for Olympic golds and overall medals]]\n\n[[Hungary at the Olympics|Hungarian athletes]] have been successful contenders in the [[Olympic Games]], only ten countries have won more Olympic medals than Hungary, with a total of 498 medals ranking eighth in an [[all-time Olympic Games medal count]].

The Austro-Hungarian Empire then withdrew from all defeated countries. On the Italian front, the Austro-Hungarian army made no progress against Italy after January 1918. Despite great Eastern successes, Germany suffered complete defeat on the more important Western front. By 1918, the economic situation had deteriorated (strikes in factories were organized by leftist and pacifist movements) and uprisings in the army had become commonplace. In the capital cities, the Austrian and Hungarian leftist liberal movements (the maverick parties) and their leaders supported the separatism of ethnic minorities.

The [[Little Entente]], sensing an opportunity, invaded the country from three sides\u2014Romania [[Hungarian-Romanian War|invaded]] [[Transylvania]], Czechoslovakia annexed [[Upper Hungary]] (today's Slovakia), and a joint [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serb]]-[[French Army|French]] coalition annexed [[Vojvodina]] and other southern regions.

Though free elections continued, Horthy's personality, and those of his personally selected prime ministers, dominated the political scene. The government's actions continued to drift right with the passage of antisemitic laws and, due to the continued isolation of the Little Entente, economic and then political gravitation toward [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]].

His government's policies of militarization, industrialization, collectivization, and war compensation led to a severe decline in living standards. In imitation of Stalin's [[KGB]], the R\u00e1kosi government established a secret political police, the [[State Protection Authority|\u00c1VH]], to enforce the new regime.

The following political cooling saw the ascent of [[Imre Nagy]] to the premiership, and the growing interest of students and intellectuals in political life. Nagy promised market liberalization and political openness, while R\u00e1kosi opposed both vigorously. R\u00e1kosi eventually managed to discredit Nagy and replace him with the more hard-line [[Ern\u0151 Ger\u0151]]. Hungary joined the [[Warsaw Pact]] in May 1955, as societal dissatisfaction with the regime swelled. Following the firing on peaceful demonstrations by Soviet soldiers and secret police, and rallies throughout the country on 23 October 1956, protesters took to the streets in Budapest, initiating the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Revolution]]. In an effort to quell the chaos, Nagy returned as premier, promised free elections, and took Hungary out of the Warsaw Pact.\n\nThe violence nonetheless continued as revolutionary militias sprung up against the Soviet Army and the \u00c1VH; the roughly 3,000-strong resistance fought Soviet tanks using [[Molotov cocktail]]s and machine-pistols. Though the preponderance of the Soviets was immense, they suffered heavy losses, and by 30 October 1956 most Soviet troops had withdrawn from Budapest to garrison the countryside. For a time, the Soviet leadership was unsure how to respond to developments in Hungary, but eventually decided to intervene to prevent a destabilization of the Soviet bloc. On 4 November reinforcements of more than 150,000 troops and 2,500 tanks entered the country from the Soviet Union.<ref>Findley, Carter V., and John Rothney. ''Twentieth Century World''. sixth ed. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2006. 278.</ref> Nearly 20,000 Hungarians were killed resisting the intervention, while an additional 21,600 were imprisoned afterwards for political reasons. Some 13,000 were interned and 230 brought to trial and executed. Nagy was secretly tried, found guilty, sentenced to death and executed by hanging in June 1958. Because borders were briefly opened, nearly a quarter of a million people fled the country by the time the revolution was suppressed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6065398.stm \"Hungary's 1956 brain drain\"], BBC News, 23 October 2006</ref>\n\n==== K\u00e1d\u00e1r era 1956\u20131988 ====\n{{See also|Goulash Communism}}\n[[File:J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r 1962.jpg|thumb|upright|[[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]], General Secretary of MSZMP, the [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party]] (1956\u20131988)]]\n\nAfter a second, briefer period of Soviet military occupation, [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]], Nagy's former Minister of State, was chosen by the Soviet leadership to head the new government and chair the new ruling [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist Workers' Party]] (MSzMP). K\u00e1d\u00e1r quickly normalized the situation. In 1963, the government granted a general amnesty and released the majority of those imprisoned for their active participation in the uprising. K\u00e1d\u00e1r proclaimed a new policy line, according to which the people were no longer compelled to profess loyalty to the party if they tacitly accepted the Socialist regime as a fact of life. In many speeches, he described this as, \"Those who are not against us are with us.\" K\u00e1d\u00e1r introduced new planning priorities in the economy, such as allowing farmers significant plots of private land within the collective farm system (''h\u00e1zt\u00e1ji gazd\u00e1lkod\u00e1s''). The living standard rose as consumer good and food production took precedence over military production, which was reduced to one tenth of pre-revolutionary levels.\n\nIn 1968, the [[New Economic Mechanism]] (NEM) introduced free-market elements into socialist command economy. From the 1960s through the late 1980s, Hungary was often referred to as \"[[the happiest barrack]]\" within the [[Eastern bloc]].

Although the MSzMP began [[Hungarian Round Table Talks|Round Table Talks]] with various opposition groups in March 1989, the reburial of Imre Nagy as a revolutionary martyr that June is widely considered the symbolic end of communism in Hungary. Over 100,000 people attended the Budapest ceremony without any significant government interference, and many speakers openly called for Soviet troops to leave the country. Free elections were held [[1990 Hungarian parliamentary election|in May 1990]], and the [[Hungarian Democratic Forum]], a major conservative opposition group, was elected to the head of a coalition government. [[J\u00f3zsef Antall]] became the first democratically elected Prime Minister since World War II.\n\nWith the removal of state subsidies and rapid privatization in 1991, Hungary was affected by a severe economic recession. The Antall government's austerity measures proved unpopular, and the Communist Party's legal and political heir, the [[Hungarian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], won the subsequent [[1994 Hungarian parliamentary election|1994 elections]]. This abrupt shift in the political landscape was repeated in [[1998 Hungarian parliamentary election|1998]] and [[2002 Hungarian parliamentary election|2002]]; each electoral cycle, the governing party was ousted and the erstwhile opposition elected. Like most other post-communist European states, however, Hungary broadly pursued an [[European integration|integrationist]] agenda, [[Enlargement of NATO|joining]] [[NATO]] in 1999 and the European Union [[2003 Hungarian European Union membership referendum|in 2004]]. As a NATO member, Hungary was involved in the [[Yugoslav Wars]].\n\nIn 2006, [[2006 protests in Hungary|major protests]] erupted after it was revealed that Prime Minister [[Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny]] had claimed in [[\u0150sz\u00f6d speech|a private speech]] that [[Hungarian Socialist Party|his party]] \"lied\" to win the [[2006 Hungarian parliamentary election|recent elections]].

The legislature consequently approved a [[Constitution of Hungary|new constitution]], among other sweeping governmental and legal changes.

The [[Budapest Metro]] is the second-oldest underground [[rapid transit|metro]] system in the world; its [[Line 1 (Budapest Metro)|Line 1]] dates from 1896. The system consists of four lines. A [[regional rail|commuter rail]] system, ''[[H\u00c9V]]'', operates in the Budapest metropolitan area.\nHungary has a total length of approximately {{convert|1314|km|2|abbr=on}} motorways ({{lang-hu|aut\u00f3p\u00e1lya}}).

Stephen promulgated [[Roman Catholicism]] as the state religion, and his successors were traditionally known as the [[Apostolic King]]s.

This campaign was only partially successful, however, and the (mainly Reformed) Hungarian nobility were able to secure freedom of worship for Christians. In practice this meant ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]''; thus, most individual localities in Hungary are still identifiable as historically Catholic, Lutheran, or Reformed.

In contrast to Historicism, Hungarian Art Nouveau is based on the national architectural characteristics. Taking the eastern origins of the Hungarians into account, [[\u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner]] (1845\u20131914), the most important figure in Hungarian Art Nouveau, was initially inspired by Indian and Syrian architecture, and later by traditional Hungarian decorative designs. In this way, he created an original synthesis of architectural styles. By applying them to three-dimensional architectural elements, he produced a version of Art Nouveau that was specific to Hungary.\n\nTurning away from the style of Lechner, yet taking inspiration from his approach, the group of \"Young People\" (''Fiatalok''), which included [[K\u00e1roly K\u00f3s]] and Dezs\u00f6 Zrumeczky, were to use the characteristic structures and forms of traditional Hungarian architecture to achieve the same end.\n\n[[File:Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest).jpg|thumb|The [[Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Applied Arts]], an [[Art Nouveau]] building designed by [[\u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner]]]]\n\nBesides the two principal styles, Budapest also displays local versions of trends originating from other European countries. The Sezession from [[Vienna]], the German [[Jugendstil]], Art Nouveau from Belgium and France, and the influence of English and Finnish architecture are all reflected in the buildings constructed at the turn of the 20th century. [[B\u00e9la Lajta]] initially adopted Lechner's style, subsequently drawing his inspiration from English and Finnish trends; after developing an interest in the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] style, he finally arrived at modern architecture. [[Alad\u00e1r \u00c1rkay]] took almost the same route. [[Istv\u00e1n Medgyaszay]] developed his own style, which differed from Lechner's, using stylised traditional motifs to create decorative designs in concrete. In the sphere of applied arts, those chiefly responsible for promoting the spread of Art Nouveau were the School and Museum of Decorative Arts, which opened in 1896.\n\nForeigners have unexpectedly \"discovered\" that a significantly large portion of the citizens live in old and architecturally valuable buildings.

Hungarian traditional music tends to have a strong [[dactyl (poetry)|dactylic]] rhythm, as the language is invariably stressed on the first syllable of each word.\n\nHungary has renowned composers of contemporary classical music, [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]], [[Gy\u00f6rgy Kurt\u00e1g]], [[Peter E\u00f6tv\u00f6s|P\u00e9ter E\u00f6tv\u00f6s]], [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]] and [[Zolt\u00e1n Jeney]] among them. One of the greatest Hungarian composers, [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], was also among the most significant musicians of the 20th century. His music was invigorated by the themes, modes, and rhythmic patterns of the Hungarian and neighboring folk music traditions he studied, which he synthesized with influences from his contemporaries into his own distinctive style.<ref>[http://mek.oszk.hu/02100/02172/html/index.html Szabolcsi] Although the Hungarian upper class has long had cultural and political connections with the rest of Europe, leading to an influx of European musical ideas, the rural peasants maintained their own traditions such that by the end of the 19th century Hungarian composers could draw on rural peasant music to (re)create a Hungarian classical style. For example, [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] and [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]], two of Hungary's most famous composers, are known for using folk themes in their own music.</ref>\n[[File:Liszt 1858.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Franz Liszt|Ferenc (Franz) Liszt]], one of the greatest pianists of all time; well-known composer and conductor]]\nHungary has made many contributions to the fields of [[folk music|folk]], [[popular music|popular]] and [[european classical music|classical music]].

Both are in Latin. These chronicles mix history with legends, so historically they are not always authentic. Another chronicle is the ''K\u00e9pes kr\u00f3nika'' (Illustrated Chronicle), which was written for [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]].\n[[File:K\u00e9pes Kr\u00f3nika 1360.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Chronicon Pictum]], a medieval illustrated chronicle from the 14th century]]\n[[Renaissance]] literature flourished under the reign of [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|King Matthias]] (1458\u20131490). [[Janus Pannonius]], although he wrote in Latin, counts as one of the most important persons in Hungarian literature, being the only significant Hungarian Humanist poet of the period. The first printing house was also founded during Matthias' reign, by [[Andr\u00e1s Hess]], in Buda. The first book printed in Hungary was the [[Chronica Hungarorum]].\nThe most important poets of the period was [[B\u00e1lint Balassi]] (1554\u20131594) and [[Nikola Zrinski|Mikl\u00f3s Zr\u00ednyi]] (1620\u20131664).\n\nBalassi's poetry shows medieval influences, his poems can be divided into three sections: love poems, war poems and religious poems. Zr\u00ednyi's most significant work, the epic ''[[Peril of Sziget|Szigeti veszedelem]]'' (\"Peril of Sziget\", written in 1648/49) is written in a fashion similar to the ''[[Iliad]]'', and recounts the heroic [[Battle of Szigetv\u00e1r]], where his great-grandfather died while defending the castle of Szigetv\u00e1r.\nAmong the religious literary works the most important is the Bible translation by [[G\u00e1sp\u00e1r K\u00e1roli]] (The second Hungarian Bible translation in the history), the Protestant pastor of [[G\u00f6nc]], in 1590. The translation is called the ''Bible of Vizsoly'', after the town where it was first published.

The greatest poets of the time were [[Mih\u00e1ly Csokonai Vit\u00e9z]] and [[D\u00e1niel Berzsenyi]].\nThe greatest figure of the language reform was [[Ferenc Kazinczy]]. The [[Hungarian language]] became feasible for all type of scientific explanations from this time, and furthermore many new words were coined for describing new inventions.\n\n[[Hungarian literature]] has recently gained some renown outside the borders of Hungary (mostly through translations into German, French and English). Some modern Hungarian authors have become increasingly popular in Germany and Italy especially [[S\u00e1ndor M\u00e1rai]], [[P\u00e9ter Esterh\u00e1zy]], [[P\u00e9ter N\u00e1das]] and [[Imre Kert\u00e9sz]].

Women participate in the dance by standing in lines to the side, and singing or shouting verses while the men dance. Each man performs a number of points (dance phrases), typically four to eight without repetition. Each point consists of four parts, each lasting four counts. The first part is usually the same for everyone (there are only a few variations).\n\nIt was in the beginning of the 18th-century that the present style of Hungarian folk art took shape, incorporating both [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] elements, depending on the area, as well as Persian [[Sassanide]] influences. Flowers and leaves, sometimes a bird or a spiral ornament, are the principal decorative themes. The most frequent ornament is a flower with a centerpiece resembling the eye of a peacock's feather.\n\nNearly all the manifestations of folk art practiced elsewhere in Europe also flourished among the [[hungarian people|Magyar]] peasantry at one time or another, their ceramics and textile being the most highly developed of all.\n\nThe finest achievements in their textile arts are the embroideries which vary from region to region. Those of [[Kalotaszeg]] in Transylvania are charming products of Oriental design, sewn chiefly in a single color&nbsp;\u2013 red, blue, or black. Soft in line, the embroideries are applied on altar cloths, pillow-cases and sheets.\n\nIn Hungary proper, S\u00e1rk\u00f6z in [[Transdanubia]] and the [[Mez\u0151k\u00f6vesd|Maty\u00f3f\u00f6ld]] in the [[Great Hungarian Plain]] produce the finest embroideries. In the [[Tolna (county)|S\u00e1rk\u00f6z]] region the women's caps show black and white designs as delicate as lace, and give evidence of the people's wonderfully subtle artistic feeling. The embroidery motifs applied to women's wear have also been transposed to tablecloths and runners suitable for modern use as wall decorations.\n\nThese vessels, made of black clay, reflect more than three hundred years of traditional Transdanubian folk patterns and shapes. No two are precisely alike, since all work is done by hand, including both the shaping and the decorating. The imprints are made by the thumb or a finger of the ceramist who makes the piece.\n\n=== Porcelain ===\n{{Main|Herend Porcelain|Zsolnay}}\nFounded in 1826, [[Herend Porcelain]] is one of the world's largest ceramic factories, specializing in luxury hand painted and gilded [[porcelain]]. In the mid-19th century it was purveyor to the [[Habsburg Dynasty]] and aristocratic customers throughout Europe. Many of its classic patterns are still in production. After the fall of communism in Hungary, the factory was privatised and is now 75% owned by its management and workers, exporting to over 60 countries of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.herend.com/ |title=Herend Porcelain Manufactory Ltd |publisher=Herend.com |accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nZsolnay Porcelain Manufacture is a Hungarian manufacturer of porcelain, pottery, ceramics, tiles and stoneware. The company introduced the eosin glazing process and pyrogranite ceramics.\nThe Zsolnay factory was established by Mikl\u00f3s Zsolnay in [[P\u00e9cs]], Hungary, to produce stoneware and ceramics in 1853. In 1863, his son, [[Vilmos Zsolnay]] (1828\u20131900) joined the company and became its manager and director after several years. He led the factory to worldwide recognition by demonstrating its innovative products at world fairs and international exhibitions, including the 1873 World Fair in Vienna, then at the 1878 World Fair in Paris, where Zsolnay received a Grand Prix.\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{See also|Hungary at the Olympics}}\n[[File:Vaterpolo Hungary vs Italy semifinal game2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hungary men's national water polo team]] is considered among the best in the world, holding the world record for Olympic golds and overall medals]]\n\n[[Hungary at the Olympics|Hungarian athletes]] have been successful contenders in the [[Olympic Games]], only ten countries have won more Olympic medals than Hungary, with a total of 498 medals ranking eighth in an [[all-time Olympic Games medal count]].
