The oceanic climate typically experiences cool winters with warmer summers and precipitation all year round, with more experienced in winter. Annual rainfall is about {{convert|1000|mm}} and up to {{convert|2000|mm}} on higher ground.<ref name=\"weather\"/>  Summer maxima averages range from {{convert|18|\u00b0C}} to {{convert|22|\u00b0C}} and winter minimum averages range from {{convert|1|\u00b0C}} to {{convert|4|\u00b0C}} across the south-west.<ref name=\"weather\">{{cite web|title=South West England: climate |work=Met Office |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/sw/ |accessdate=14 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605003222/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/sw/ |archivedate= 5 June 2011 }}</ref> It is the second windiest area of the United Kingdom, the majority of winds coming from the south-west and north-east.<ref name=\"weather\"/> Government organisations predict the region to rise in temperature and become the hottest region in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"future\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/8108383.stm|title=South west faces temperature jump|date=19 June 2009|work=BBC News|accessdate=25 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nInland areas of low altitude experience the least amount of precipitation. They experience the highest summer maxima temperatures, but winter minima are colder than the coast. Snowfalls are more frequent in comparison to the coast, but less so in comparison to higher ground.<ref name=\"weather\"/> It experiences the lowest wind speeds and sunshine total in between that of the coast and the moors. The climate of inland areas is more noticeable the further north-east into the region.\n\nIn comparison to inland areas, the coast experiences high minimum temperatures, especially in winter, and it experiences slightly lower maximum temperatures during the summer. Rainfall is the lowest at the coast and snowfall is rarer than the rest of the region. Coastal areas are the windiest parts of the peninsula and they receive the most sunshine. The general coastal climate is more typical the further south-west into the region.\n\nAreas of [[moorland]] inland such as: [[Bodmin Moor]], [[Dartmoor]] and [[Exmoor]] experience lower temperatures and more precipitation than the rest of the southwest (approximately twice as much rainfall as lowland areas), because of their high altitude. Both of these factors also cause it to experience the highest levels of snowfall and the lowest levels of sunshine. Exposed areas of the moors are windier than lowlands and can be almost as windy as the coast.\n\n===Regional identity===\nThe boundaries of the South West region are based upon those devised by central government in the 1930s for civil defence administration and subsequently used for various statistical analyses. The region is also similar to that used in the 17th-century [[Rule of the Major-Generals]] under [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]]. (For further information, see [[Historical and alternative regions of England]]). By the 1960s, the South West region (including Dorset, which for some previous purposes had been included in a Southern region), was widely recognised for government administration and statistics. The boundaries were carried forward into the 1990s when regional administrations were formally established as Government Office Regions. A [[South West Regional Assembly|regional assembly]] and [[South West of England Regional Development Agency|regional development agency]] were created in 1999, then abolished in 2008 and 2012 respectively.\n\nIt has been argued that the official South West region does not possess a cultural and historic unity or identity of itself, which has led to criticism of it as an \"artificial\" construct. The large area of the region, stretching as it does from the Isles of Scilly to Gloucestershire, encompasses diverse areas which have little more in common with each other than they do with other areas of England. The region has several TV stations and newspapers based in different areas, and no single acknowledged regional \"capital\".  Many people of the region have some level of a 'South West', or 'West Country' regional identity, although this may not necessarily correspond to an identification with the official government-defined [[Regions of England|region]]. It is common for people in the region to identify at a national level (whether [[English nationalism|English]], [[British nationalism|British]], [[Cornish nationalism|Cornish]], and/or a county or city/town level). Identifying as being from 'the Westcountry', amorphous though it is, tends to be more predominant further into the peninsula where the status of being from the region is less equivocal.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/spp/publications/unit-publications/94.pdf | title=The Cornish Question: Devolution in the South-West Region | last=Sandford | first=Mark | publisher=UCL | accessdate=12 February 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221191805/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/spp/publications/unit-publications/94.pdf | archive-date=21 February 2011 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/13785851/Regional-Spaces-Spaces-of-Regionalism-Territory-Insurgent-Politics-and-the-English-Question |title=Regional Spaces: Spaces of Regionalism, Territory, Insurgent Politics and the English Question |publisher=Scribd.com |date=31 March 2009 |accessdate=24 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118042520/http://www.scribd.com/doc/13785851/Regional-Spaces-Spaces-of-Regionalism-Territory-Insurgent-Politics-and-the-English-Question |archive-date=18 January 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn particular, [[Cornwall]]'s inclusion in the region is disputed by Cornish nationalists.<ref>{{cite web |author=Cornish Constitutional Convention |url=http://www.cornishassembly.org/caseforcornwall.htm |title=Campaign for a Cornish Assembly |publisher=Cornishassembly.org |accessdate=24 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310230049/http://www.cornishassembly.org/caseforcornwall.htm |archive-date=10 March 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> The cross-party [[Cornish Constitutional Convention]] and Cornish nationalist party [[Mebyon Kernow]] have campaigned for a [[Cornish Assembly]] ever since the idea of regional devolution was put forward.\n\n===Settlements===\n[[File:Pulteney Bridge, Bath 2.jpg|alt=A three arch stone bridge with buildings on it, over water.

Annual rainfall is about {{convert|1000|mm}} and up to {{convert|2000|mm}} on higher ground.<ref name=\"weather\"/>  Summer maxima averages range from {{convert|18|\u00b0C}} to {{convert|22|\u00b0C}} and winter minimum averages range from {{convert|1|\u00b0C}} to {{convert|4|\u00b0C}} across the south-west.<ref name=\"weather\">{{cite web|title=South West England: climate |work=Met Office |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/sw/ |accessdate=14 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605003222/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/sw/ |archivedate= 5 June 2011 }}</ref> It is the second windiest area of the United Kingdom, the majority of winds coming from the south-west and north-east.<ref name=\"weather\"/> Government organisations predict the region to rise in temperature and become the hottest region in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"future\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/8108383.stm|title=South west faces temperature jump|date=19 June 2009|work=BBC News|accessdate=25 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nInland areas of low altitude experience the least amount of precipitation. They experience the highest summer maxima temperatures, but winter minima are colder than the coast. Snowfalls are more frequent in comparison to the coast, but less so in comparison to higher ground.<ref name=\"weather\"/> It experiences the lowest wind speeds and sunshine total in between that of the coast and the moors. The climate of inland areas is more noticeable the further north-east into the region.\n\nIn comparison to inland areas, the coast experiences high minimum temperatures, especially in winter, and it experiences slightly lower maximum temperatures during the summer. Rainfall is the lowest at the coast and snowfall is rarer than the rest of the region. Coastal areas are the windiest parts of the peninsula and they receive the most sunshine. The general coastal climate is more typical the further south-west into the region.\n\nAreas of [[moorland]] inland such as: [[Bodmin Moor]], [[Dartmoor]] and [[Exmoor]] experience lower temperatures and more precipitation than the rest of the southwest (approximately twice as much rainfall as lowland areas), because of their high altitude. Both of these factors also cause it to experience the highest levels of snowfall and the lowest levels of sunshine. Exposed areas of the moors are windier than lowlands and can be almost as windy as the coast.\n\n===Regional identity===\nThe boundaries of the South West region are based upon those devised by central government in the 1930s for civil defence administration and subsequently used for various statistical analyses. The region is also similar to that used in the 17th-century [[Rule of the Major-Generals]] under [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]]. (For further information, see [[Historical and alternative regions of England]]). By the 1960s, the South West region (including Dorset, which for some previous purposes had been included in a Southern region), was widely recognised for government administration and statistics. The boundaries were carried forward into the 1990s when regional administrations were formally established as Government Office Regions. A [[South West Regional Assembly|regional assembly]] and [[South West of England Regional Development Agency|regional development agency]] were created in 1999, then abolished in 2008 and 2012 respectively.\n\nIt has been argued that the official South West region does not possess a cultural and historic unity or identity of itself, which has led to criticism of it as an \"artificial\" construct. The large area of the region, stretching as it does from the Isles of Scilly to Gloucestershire, encompasses diverse areas which have little more in common with each other than they do with other areas of England. The region has several TV stations and newspapers based in different areas, and no single acknowledged regional \"capital\".  Many people of the region have some level of a 'South West', or 'West Country' regional identity, although this may not necessarily correspond to an identification with the official government-defined [[Regions of England|region]]. It is common for people in the region to identify at a national level (whether [[English nationalism|English]], [[British nationalism|British]], [[Cornish nationalism|Cornish]], and/or a county or city/town level). Identifying as being from 'the Westcountry', amorphous though it is, tends to be more predominant further into the peninsula where the status of being from the region is less equivocal.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/spp/publications/unit-publications/94.pdf | title=The Cornish Question: Devolution in the South-West Region | last=Sandford | first=Mark | publisher=UCL | accessdate=12 February 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221191805/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/spp/publications/unit-publications/94.pdf | archive-date=21 February 2011 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/13785851/Regional-Spaces-Spaces-of-Regionalism-Territory-Insurgent-Politics-and-the-English-Question |title=Regional Spaces: Spaces of Regionalism, Territory, Insurgent Politics and the English Question |publisher=Scribd.com |date=31 March 2009 |accessdate=24 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118042520/http://www.scribd.com/doc/13785851/Regional-Spaces-Spaces-of-Regionalism-Territory-Insurgent-Politics-and-the-English-Question |archive-date=18 January 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn particular, [[Cornwall]]'s inclusion in the region is disputed by Cornish nationalists.<ref>{{cite web |author=Cornish Constitutional Convention |url=http://www.cornishassembly.org/caseforcornwall.htm |title=Campaign for a Cornish Assembly |publisher=Cornishassembly.org |accessdate=24 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310230049/http://www.cornishassembly.org/caseforcornwall.htm |archive-date=10 March 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> The cross-party [[Cornish Constitutional Convention]] and Cornish nationalist party [[Mebyon Kernow]] have campaigned for a [[Cornish Assembly]] ever since the idea of regional devolution was put forward.\n\n===Settlements===\n[[File:Pulteney Bridge, Bath 2.jpg|alt=A three arch stone bridge with buildings on it, over water.

Neither Sweyn Forkbeard nor Canute conquered or controlled Scotland, Wales or Cornwall; but these areas were \"client nations\": subject to payment of a yearly tribute or ''[[danegeld]]'' to Sweyn and later Canute, all three areas retained their autonomy from the Danes.

The [[Cornish Rebellion of 1497]] led by [[An Gof]] and [[Thomas Flamank]] ended in a march to [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] in London where the [[Cornish people|Cornish]] forces were massacred.\n\n===16th century===\nGreat disturbances throughout both Cornwall and Devon followed the introduction of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]'s [[Book of Common Prayer]].

The [[Cornish language]] declined rapidly afterwards and the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] resulted in the eventual loss of the Cornish language as a primary language. By the end of the 18th century it was no longer a first language.\n\nThe [[Council of the West]] was a short-lived administrative body established by Henry VIII for the government of the western counties of England.

Mountain men were most common in the [[North America]]n [[Rocky Mountains]] from about 1810 through to the 1880s (with a peak population in the early 1840s). They were instrumental in opening up the various [[Westward Expansion Trails|Emigrant Trails]] (widened into wagon roads) allowing Americans in the east to settle the new territories of the far west by organized [[wagon train]]s traveling over roads explored and in many cases, physically improved by the mountain men and the big fur companies originally to serve the [[mule|mule train]] based [[fur trade|inland fur trade]].\n\nThey arose in a natural geographic and economic expansion was driven by the lucrative earnings available in the [[North American fur trade]], in the wake of the various 1806\u201307 published accounts of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark expeditions]]' (1803\u20131806) findings about the Rockies and the ([[Territorial dispute|ownership-disputed]] between the [[United States]] and the [[British Empire|British]]) [[Oregon Country]] where they flourished economically for over three decades. By the time two new international treaties in early 1846 and early 1848<ref name=\"dispute\">see a) [[Oregon boundary dispute]]\u2014Britain and the U.S. settled the ownership of the Pacific Northwest and the northern territories along current western Canada\u2013US border, and<br />b) the 1848 treaty formally ending the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].</ref><!--\n--> officially settled new western coastal territories in the United States and spurred a large upsurge in migration, the days of mountain men making a good living by fur trapping had largely ended. This was partly because the fur industry was failing due to reduced demand and over trapping. With the rise of the silk trade and quick collapse of the [[North American beaver]]-based fur trade in the later 1830s\u20131840s, many of the mountain men settled into jobs as Army Scouts or wagon train guides or settled throughout the lands which they had helped open up. Others, like [[William Sublette]], opened up fort-trading posts along the [[Oregon Trail]] to service the remnant fur trade and the settlers heading west.\n\n==History==\n{{further|Fur Trade in Montana}}\nMountain men were most common in the North American [[Rocky Mountains]] from about 1810 through to the 1880s (with a peak population in the early 1840s). Approximately 3,000 mountain men ranged the mountains between 1820 and 1840, the peak beaver-harvesting period. While there were many [[free trappers]], most mountain men were employed by major fur companies. The life of a company man was almost militarized. The men had mess groups, hunted and trapped in [[brigade]]s and always reported to the head of the trapping party. This man was called a \"boosway\", a bastardization of the [[French language|French]] term ''[[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]''. He was the leader of the brigade and the head trader.\n\n[[Donald Mackenzie (explorer)|Donald Mackenzie]], representing the [[North West Company]], held a [[rendezvous (fur trade)|rendezvous]] in the [[Boise River]] Valley in 1819.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idahohistory.net/Reference%20Series/0444.pdf |title=Idahohistory.net |publisher=Idahohistory.net |date=2010-07-07 |accessdate=2012-10-01}}</ref> The [[Rocky Mountain Rendezvous|rendezvous system]] was later implemented by [[William Henry Ashley]] of the [[Rocky Mountain Fur Company]], whose company representatives would haul supplies to specific mountain locations in the spring, engage in trading with trappers, and bring [[Fur|pelts]] back to communities on the [[Missouri River|Missouri]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers, like [[St. Louis]], in the fall. Ashley sold his business to the outfit of [[Jedediah Smith]], [[David Edward Jackson|Jackson]], and [[William Sublette|Sublette]]. He continued to earn revenue by selling that firm their supplies. This system of rendezvous with trappers continued when other firms, particularly the [[American Fur Company]] owned by [[John Jacob Astor]], entered the field.\n\nThe annual rendezvous was often held at Horse Creek on the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]], now called the [[Upper Green River Rendezvous Site]], near present-day [[Pinedale, Wyoming]]. Another popular site in the same general area was [[Pierre's Hole]]. By the mid-1830s, it attracted 450\u2013500 men annually, essentially all the American trappers and traders working in the Rockies, as well as numerous Native Americans. In the late 1830s, the Canadian-based [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) instituted a policy to destroy the American fur trade. The HBC's annual [[Snake River]] Expedition was transformed into a trading enterprise. Beginning in 1834, it visited the American Rendezvous to buy furs at low prices. The HBC was able to offer manufactured trade goods at prices far below that with which American fur companies could compete. Combined with a decline in demand for and supply of beaver, by 1840 the HBC had effectively destroyed the American system. The last rendezvous was held in 1840. During the same years, fashion in Europe shifted away from the formerly popular beaver hats; at the same time, the animal had become over-hunted. After achieving an American [[monopoly]] by 1830, Astor got out of the fur business before its decline.\n\nBy 1841 the American Fur Company and the Rocky Mountain Fur Company were in ruins. By 1846 only some 50 American trappers still worked in the [[Snake River]] country, compared to 500\u2013600 in 1826. Soon after the strategic victory by the HBC, the Snake River route was used for emigrants as the [[Oregon Trail]], which brought a new form of competition. Former trappers earned money as guides or hunters for the emigrant parties.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mackie |first=Richard Somerset |title=Trading Beyond the Mountains: The British Fur Trade on the Pacific 1793-1843 |year=1997 |publisher=University of British Columbia (UBC) Press |location=Vancouver |isbn=0-7748-0613-3 |pages=107\u2013111}}</ref>\n\nA second fur trading and supply center grew up in [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]] in what is today [[New Mexico]]. This trade attracted numerous French Americans from Louisiana and some French Canadian trappers, in addition to Anglo-Americans. Some New Mexican residents also pursued the beaver trade, as Mexican citizens initially had some legal advantages. Trappers and traders in the Southwest covered territory that was generally inaccessible to the large fur companies. It included parts of New Mexico, Nevada, California and central and southern Utah. After the decline in beaver and the fur trade, with some emigrants to the West using the [[Mormon Trail]], former trappers found work as guides and hunters for the traveling parties.\n\nAfter the short-lived American [[Pacific Fur Company]] was sold, the British controlled the fur trade in the [[Pacific Northwest]], under first the [[North West Company]] and then the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. To prevent American fur traders from competing, the British companies adopted a policy of destroying fur resources west of the Rocky Mountains, especially in the upper [[Snake River]] country. After the Hudson's Bay Company took over operations in the Pacific Northwest in 1821, the Snake River country was rapidly trapped out.<ref name=\" Mackie 1997 64\u201365\">{{cite book |last=Mackie |first=Richard Somerset |title=Trading Beyond the Mountains: The British Fur Trade on the Pacific 1793-1843 |year=1997 |publisher=University of British Columbia (UBC) Press |location=Vancouver |isbn=0-7748-0613-3 |pages=64\u201365}}</ref>\n\nThis halted American expansion into the region. After 1825 few American trappers worked west of the Rocky Mountains and those who did generally found it unprofitable. According to historian Richard Mackie, this policy of the Hudson's Bay Company forced American trappers to remain in the Rocky Mountains, which gave rise to the term \"mountain men\".<ref name=\" Mackie 1997 64\u201365\"/>\n\nMountain men were instrumental in opening up the various [[Westward Expansion Trails|Emigrant Trails]] (widened into wagon roads) allowing Americans in the east to settle the new territories of the far west by organized [[wagon train]]s traveling over roads explored and in many cases, physically improved by the mountain men and the big fur companies originally to serve the [[mule|mule train]] based [[fur trade|inland fur trade]].\n\nBy the time two new international treaties in early 1846 and early 1848<ref name=\"dispute\" /> officially settled new western coastal territories on the United States and spurred a large upsurge in migration, the days of mountain men making a good living by fur trapping had largely ended.

Fortuitously, America's ongoing [[Manifest Destiny|western migration]] by wagon trains with the goal of claiming cheap lands in the west was building rapidly from a trickle of settlers from 1841's opening of the [[Oregon Trail]] (now a wagon road) to a flood of emigrants headed west by 1847\u201349 and thereafter well into the later 1880s.\n\nWith the silk trade and quick collapse of the [[North American beaver]]-based fur trade in the later 1830s\u20131840s, many of the mountain men settled into jobs as Army Scouts, wagon train guides, and settlers through the lands which they had helped open up. Others, like [[William Sublette]], opened up fort-trading posts along the Oregon Trail to service the remnant fur trade and the settlers heading west.\n\n[[File:Seth Kinman.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Seth Kinman]], a notable 19th century mountain man known to have hunted down around 800 grizzly bears]]\n[[File:Mariano Medina 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Mariano Medina (mountain man)|Mariano Medina]]]]\n\nBy the time the fur trade began to collapse in the 1840s, motivating them to change jobs, the trails they had explored and turned into reliable mule trails and improved gradually into wagon-capable freight roads combined to allow them to hire themselves as guides and scouts. As the fur trade declined, mountain man [[Robert Newell (politician)|Robert Newell]] told [[Jim Bridger]]: \"[W]e are done with this life in the mountains{{mdash}}done with wading in beaver dams, and freezing or starving alternately{{mdash}}done with Indian trading and Indian fighting.

The migration would explode in 1849's \"[[California Gold Rush#Forty-niners|The Forty-Niners]]\" in response to the discovery of gold in California in 1848. [[Manifest Destiny]] had received a powerful push in the spring and summer of 1846 with the international treaties settling the ownership of the Pacific coast territories and [[Oregon Country]] on the United States.\n\n==Mode of living==\n[[File:Alfred Jacob Miller - The Greeting - Walters 371940133.jpg|thumb|230px|''The Greeting'', by [[Alfred Jacob Miller]]]]\n\nThe life of a mountain man was rugged: many did not last more than several years in the wilderness. They faced many hazards, especially when exploring unmapped areas: biting insects and other wildlife, bad weather, diseases of all kinds, injuries and hostile tribes presented constant physical dangers. [[Grizzly bear]]s were one of the mountain men's greatest enemies.<ref>Cleland (1950), p. 43.</ref> Winters could be brutal with heavy snowstorms and low temperatures.\n\nIn order to stay alive, the men needed keen senses, and knowledge of herbal remedies and first aid, among other skills. In summer, they could catch fish, build shelter, and hunt for food and skins. The mountain men dressed in deer skins that had stiffened after being left outdoors for a time; this suit of stiffened deer skin gave him some protection against the weapons of particular enemies.<ref>Cleland (1950), p. 21.</ref> There were no doctors in the regions where mountain men worked; these men had to set their own broken bones, tend their wounds, and nurse themselves back to good health.<ref>Cleland, Robert Glass.

New York City: Knopf. 1950, p. 44.</ref>\n\n===Free trappers===\nA free trapper was a mountain man who, in today's terms, would be called a [[free agent (business)|free agent]]. He was independent and traded his pelts to whoever would pay him the best price. This contrasts with a \"company man\", typically indebted to one fur company for the cost of his gear, who traded only with them (and was often under the direct command of company representatives). Some company men who paid off the debt could become free traders using the gear they had earned. They might sell to the same company when the price was agreeable/convenient.\n\n===Historical reenactment===\n[[Historical reenactment]] of the dress and lifestyle of a mountain man, sometimes known as [[buckskinning]], allows people to recreate aspects of this historical period. Today's [[Rocky Mountain Rendezvous]] and other reenacted events are both history-oriented and social occasions. Some modern men choose a lifestyle similar to that of historical mountain men. They may live and roam in the mountains of the West or in the swamps of the southern United States.

He was among the first non-natives to see the [[geyser]]s and other natural wonders of the [[Yellowstone]] region. He is also considered one of the first men of European descent, along with [[\u00c9tienne Provost]], to see the [[Great Salt Lake]], which because of its salinity, he first believed was an arm of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. In 1830, Bridger purchased shares in the [[Rocky Mountain Fur Company]]. He established [[Fort Bridger]] in southwestern [[Wyoming]] and was also well known as a teller of [[tall tales]]. Fort Bridger later figured in the history of the [[Donner Party]].\n* [[Kit Carson]] (1809\u20131868) achieved notability for his later exploits, but he got his start and gained some early recognition as a trapper. Carson explored the west to California and north through the Rocky Mountains. He lived among and married into the [[Arapaho]] and [[Cheyenne]] tribes. He was hired by [[John C. Fremont]] (\"the Pathfinder\") as a guide and led him through much of California, Oregon, and the [[Great Basin]] area, and achieved national fame through Fremont. Stories of his life as a mountain man turned him into a frontier hero-figure, the prototypical mountain man of his time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/people/a_c/carson.htm |title=PBS.org |publisher=PBS.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-01}}</ref>\n* [[Mansel Carter]] (1902-1987), a.k.a. \"Man of the Mountain\" was a businessman and gold prospector.

His description of the [[Geothermal areas of Yellowstone|geothermal activity]] there seemed so outrageous to some that the area was mockingly referred to as [[Colter's Hell]]. Colter's narrow escape following capture by [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfeet]], leaving him naked and alone in the wilderness, became a legend known as \"[[John Colter#Colter's Run|Colter's Run]]\".\n* [[George Drouillard]] (1774/75?\u20131810) was a hunter, interpreter, and sign-talker on the Lewis and Clark Expedition, often considered as one of Lewis' two most appreciated members (with [[John Colter]]). Born to a French Canadian father and a Shawnee mother in Detroit, Drouillard proved to be the most skillful hunter on the expedition, notably during the harsh wintering in [[Fort Clatsop]]. He eventually went on trapping in today's [[Wyoming]] and [[Montana]] after the expedition, working for [[Manuel Lisa]] Missouri Fur Company, where he had signed on in 1807. Often venturing out alone like [[John Colter]], notably to the headwaters of the [[Bighorn River|Big Horn]] River from the [[Yellowstone]] and around the [[Three Forks of the Missouri]], George Drouillard was savagely killed in May 1810 by [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot Indians]] in the [[Three Forks, Gallatin County, Montana|Three Forks]] area.\n* [[Sylvan Ambrose Hart|Sylvan \"Buckskin Bill\" Hart]] (1906\u20131980), known as the \"Last of the Mountain Men,\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Peterson|first1=Harold|title=The Last of The Mountain Men|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1966/10/03/610646/the-last-of-the-mountain-men|website=Sports Illustrated|publisher=Time, Inc.|accessdate=20 February 2016}}</ref> lived along the [[Salmon River (Idaho)|Salmon River]] in the [[Frank Church\u2013River of No Return Wilderness|Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness]] in [[Idaho]] from 1932\u20131980.

Later he served in the [[Provisional Legislature of Oregon]] before being selected as the [[United States Marshal]] for the Oregon Territory.\n* [[Jedediah Smith]] (1799\u20131831) was a hunter, trapper, and fur trader whose explorations were significant in opening the American West to settlement by Europeans and Americans. Smith is considered the first man of European descent to cross the future state of [[Nevada]]; the first to traverse [[Utah]] from north to south and from west to east; and the first American to enter [[California]] by an overland route. He was also first to scale the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|High Sierra]] and explore the area from [[San Diego]] to the banks of the [[Columbia River]]. He was a successful businessman and a full partner in the [[Rocky Mountain Fur Company]] after Ashley's departure.

Mountain men were most common in the [[North America]]n [[Rocky Mountains]] from about 1810 through to the 1880s (with a peak population in the early 1840s). They were instrumental in opening up the various [[Westward Expansion Trails|Emigrant Trails]] (widened into wagon roads) allowing Americans in the east to settle the new territories of the far west by organized [[wagon train]]s traveling over roads explored and in many cases, physically improved by the mountain men and the big fur companies originally to serve the [[mule|mule train]] based [[fur trade|inland fur trade]].\n\nThey arose in a natural geographic and economic expansion was driven by the lucrative earnings available in the [[North American fur trade]], in the wake of the various 1806\u201307 published accounts of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark expeditions]]' (1803\u20131806) findings about the Rockies and the ([[Territorial dispute|ownership-disputed]] between the [[United States]] and the [[British Empire|British]]) [[Oregon Country]] where they flourished economically for over three decades. By the time two new international treaties in early 1846 and early 1848<ref name=\"dispute\">see a) [[Oregon boundary dispute]]\u2014Britain and the U.S. settled the ownership of the Pacific Northwest and the northern territories along current western Canada\u2013US border, and<br />b) the 1848 treaty formally ending the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].</ref><!--\n--> officially settled new western coastal territories in the United States and spurred a large upsurge in migration, the days of mountain men making a good living by fur trapping had largely ended. This was partly because the fur industry was failing due to reduced demand and over trapping. With the rise of the silk trade and quick collapse of the [[North American beaver]]-based fur trade in the later 1830s\u20131840s, many of the mountain men settled into jobs as Army Scouts or wagon train guides or settled throughout the lands which they had helped open up. Others, like [[William Sublette]], opened up fort-trading posts along the [[Oregon Trail]] to service the remnant fur trade and the settlers heading west.\n\n==History==\n{{further|Fur Trade in Montana}}\nMountain men were most common in the North American [[Rocky Mountains]] from about 1810 through to the 1880s (with a peak population in the early 1840s). Approximately 3,000 mountain men ranged the mountains between 1820 and 1840, the peak beaver-harvesting period. While there were many [[free trappers]], most mountain men were employed by major fur companies. The life of a company man was almost militarized. The men had mess groups, hunted and trapped in [[brigade]]s and always reported to the head of the trapping party. This man was called a \"boosway\", a bastardization of the [[French language|French]] term ''[[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]''. He was the leader of the brigade and the head trader.\n\n[[Donald Mackenzie (explorer)|Donald Mackenzie]], representing the [[North West Company]], held a [[rendezvous (fur trade)|rendezvous]] in the [[Boise River]] Valley in 1819.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idahohistory.net/Reference%20Series/0444.pdf |title=Idahohistory.net |publisher=Idahohistory.net |date=2010-07-07 |accessdate=2012-10-01}}</ref> The [[Rocky Mountain Rendezvous|rendezvous system]] was later implemented by [[William Henry Ashley]] of the [[Rocky Mountain Fur Company]], whose company representatives would haul supplies to specific mountain locations in the spring, engage in trading with trappers, and bring [[Fur|pelts]] back to communities on the [[Missouri River|Missouri]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers, like [[St. Louis]], in the fall. Ashley sold his business to the outfit of [[Jedediah Smith]], [[David Edward Jackson|Jackson]], and [[William Sublette|Sublette]]. He continued to earn revenue by selling that firm their supplies. This system of rendezvous with trappers continued when other firms, particularly the [[American Fur Company]] owned by [[John Jacob Astor]], entered the field.\n\nThe annual rendezvous was often held at Horse Creek on the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]], now called the [[Upper Green River Rendezvous Site]], near present-day [[Pinedale, Wyoming]]. Another popular site in the same general area was [[Pierre's Hole]]. By the mid-1830s, it attracted 450-500 men annually, essentially all the American trappers and traders working in the Rockies, as well as numerous Native Americans. In the late 1830s, the Canadian-based [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) instituted a policy to destroy the American fur trade. The HBC's annual [[Snake River]] Expedition was transformed to a trading enterprise. Beginning in 1834, it visited the American Rendezvous to buy furs at low prices. The HBC was able to offer manufactured trade goods at prices far below that with which American fur companies could compete. Combined with a decline in demand for and supply of beaver, by 1840 the HBC had effectively destroyed the American system. The last rendezvous was held in 1840. During the same years, fashion in Europe shifted away from the formerly popular beaver hats; at the same time, the animal had become over-hunted. After achieving an American [[monopoly]] by 1830, Astor got out of the fur business before its decline.\n\nBy 1841 the American Fur Company and the Rocky Mountain Fur Company were in ruins. By 1846 only some 50 American trappers still worked in the [[Snake River]] country, compared to 500-600 in 1826. Soon after the strategic victory by the HBC, the Snake River route was used for emigrants as the [[Oregon Trail]], which brought a new form of competition. Former trappers earned money as guides or hunters for the emigrant parties.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mackie |first=Richard Somerset |title=Trading Beyond the Mountains: The British Fur Trade on the Pacific 1793-1843 |year=1997 |publisher=University of British Columbia (UBC) Press |location=Vancouver |isbn=0-7748-0613-3 |pages=107\u2013111}}</ref>\n\nA second fur trading and supply center grew up in [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]] in what is today [[New Mexico]]. This trade attracted numerous French Americans from Louisiana and some French Canadian trappers, in addition to Anglo-Americans. Some New Mexican residents also pursued the beaver trade, as Mexican citizens initially had some legal advantages. Trappers and traders in the Southwest covered territory that was generally inaccessible to the large fur companies. It included parts of New Mexico, Nevada, California and central and southern Utah. After the decline in beaver and the fur trade, with some emigrants to the West using the [[Mormon Trail]], former trappers found work as guides and hunters for the traveling parties.\n\nAfter the short-lived American [[Pacific Fur Company]] was sold, the British controlled the fur trade in the [[Pacific Northwest]], under first the [[North West Company]] and then the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. To prevent American fur traders from competing, the British companies adopted a policy of destroying fur resources west of the Rocky Mountains, especially in the upper [[Snake River]] country. After the Hudson's Bay Company took over operations in the Pacific Northwest in 1821, the Snake River country was rapidly trapped out.<ref name=\" Mackie 1997 64\u201365\">{{cite book |last=Mackie |first=Richard Somerset |title=Trading Beyond the Mountains: The British Fur Trade on the Pacific 1793-1843 |year=1997 |publisher=University of British Columbia (UBC) Press |location=Vancouver |isbn=0-7748-0613-3 |pages=64\u201365}}</ref>\n\nThis halted American expansion into the region. After 1825 few American trappers worked west of the Rocky Mountains and those who did generally found it unprofitable. According to historian Richard Mackie, this policy of the Hudson's Bay Company forced American trappers to remain in the Rocky Mountains, which gave rise to the term \"mountain men\".<ref name=\" Mackie 1997 64\u201365\"/>\n\nMountain men were instrumental in opening up the various [[Westward Expansion Trails|Emigrant Trails]] (widened into wagon roads) allowing Americans in the east to settle the new territories of the far west by organized [[wagon train]]s traveling over roads explored and in many cases, physically improved by the mountain men and the big fur companies originally to serve the [[mule|mule train]] based [[fur trade|inland fur trade]].\n\nBy the time two new international treaties in early 1846 and early 1848<ref name=\"dispute\" /> officially settled new western coastal territories on the United States and spurred a large upsurge in migration, the days of mountain men making a good living by fur trapping had largely ended.

Fremont and the claiming of the American west'', New York: Touchstone. 2001, p. 98. {{ISBN|0-684-83482-0}}.</ref><ref>Sides, Hampton, ''Blood and Thunder'', Doubleday. 2006, pp. 33-34. {{ISBN|0-385-50777-1}}.</ref> At the same time the great push west along the newly opened Oregon Trail built up from a trickle of settlers in 1841 to a steady stream in 1844\u201346, and then became a flood as the highly organized Mormon migration exploited the road to the Great Salt Lake discovered by mountain man [[Jim Bridger]] in 1847\u201348. The migration would explode in 1849's \"[[California Gold Rush#Forty-niners|The Forty-Niners]]\" in response to the discovery of gold in California in 1848. [[Manifest Destiny]] had received a powerful push in the spring and summer of 1846 with the international treaties settling the ownership of the Pacific coast territories and [[Oregon Country]] on the United States.\n\n==Mode of living==\n[[File:Alfred Jacob Miller - The Greeting - Walters 371940133.jpg|thumb|230px|''The Greeting'', by [[Alfred Jacob Miller]]]]\n\nThe life of a mountain man was rugged: many did not last more than several years in the wilderness. They faced many hazards, especially when exploring unmapped areas: biting insects and other wildlife, bad weather, diseases of all kinds, injuries and hostile tribes presented constant physical dangers. [[Grizzly bear]]s were one of the mountain men's greatest enemies.<ref>Cleland (1950), p. 43.</ref> Winters could be brutal with heavy snowstorms and low temperatures.\n\nIn order to stay alive, the men needed keen senses, and knowledge of herbal remedies and first aid, among other skills. In summer, they could catch fish, build shelter, and hunt for food and skins. The mountain men dressed in deer skins that had stiffened after being left outdoors for a time; this suit of stiffened deer skin gave him some protection against the weapons of particular enemies.<ref>Cleland (1950), p. 21.</ref> There were no doctors in the regions where mountain men worked; these men had to set their own broken bones, tend their wounds, and nurse themselves back to good health.<ref>Cleland, Robert Glass. ''This Reckless Breed of Men: The Trappers and Fur Traders of the Southwest''. New York City: Knopf. 1950, p. 44.</ref>\n\n===Free trappers===\nA free trapper was a mountain man who, in today's terms, would be called a [[free agent (business)|free agent]]. He was independent and traded his pelts to whoever would pay him the best price. This contrasts with a \"company man\", typically indebted to one fur company for the cost of his gear, who traded only with them (and was often under the direct command of company representatives). Some company men who paid off the debt could become free traders using the gear they had earned. They might sell to the same company when the price was agreeable/convenient.\n\n===Historical reenactment===\n[[Historical reenactment]] of the dress and lifestyle of a mountain man, sometimes known as [[buckskinning]], allows people to recreate aspects of this historical period. Today's [[Rocky Mountain Rendezvous]] and other reenacted events are both history-oriented and social occasions. Some modern men choose a lifestyle similar to that of historical mountain men. They may live and roam in the mountains of the West or in the swamps of the southern United States.

He started working with the Ashley expedition, signed on with the [[Rocky Mountain Fur Company]], and became a well-known mountain man. He lived with the [[Crow Nation|Crow]] for years and became a war chief. He was the only [[African American]] in the West to have his life story published (1856<ref name=BeckwourthAutobiography>{{cite book|last1=Bonner|first1=Thomas D.|title=The Life and Adventures of James P.

He was credited with the discovery of [[Beckwourth Pass]] in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in 1850 and improved a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] path to create what became known as the Beckwourth Trail through the mountains to [[Marysville, California]].\n* [[Jim Bridger]] (1804\u20131881) went west in 1822 at the age of 17, as a member of [[Ashley's Hundred]] exploring the Upper Missouri drainage. He was among the first non-natives to see the [[geyser]]s and other natural wonders of the [[Yellowstone]] region. He is also considered one of the first men of European descent, along with [[\u00c9tienne Provost]], to see the [[Great Salt Lake]], which because of its salinity, he first believed was an arm of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. In 1830, Bridger purchased shares in the [[Rocky Mountain Fur Company]]. He established [[Fort Bridger]] in southwestern [[Wyoming]] and was also well known as a teller of [[tall tales]]. Fort Bridger later figured in the history of the [[Donner Party]].\n* [[Kit Carson]] (1809\u20131868) achieved notability for his later exploits, but he got his start and gained some early recognition as a trapper. Carson explored the west to California and north through the Rocky Mountains. He lived among and married into the [[Arapaho]] and [[Cheyenne]] tribes. He was hired by [[John C. Fremont]] (\"the Pathfinder\") as a guide and led him through much of California, Oregon, and the [[Great Basin]] area, and achieved national fame through Fremont. Stories of his life as a mountain man turned him into a frontier hero-figure, the prototypical mountain man of his time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/people/a_c/carson.htm |title=PBS.org |publisher=PBS.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-01}}</ref>\n* [[Mansel Carter]] (1902-1987), a.k.a. \"Man of the Mountain\" was a businessman and gold prospector. In 1987, Phoenix Magazine named him one of \"Arizona Legends\". His gravesite in the Gold Mountain of the San Tan Mountain Regional Park in Queen Creek, Arizona is a tourist attraction by the San Tan Historical Society of Queen Creek. The mountain in which he prospected is known as the Gold Mountain and the area is now part of the San Tan Mountain Regional Park system.

He later became the first European man to enter [[Yellowstone National Park]], and to see what is now [[Jackson Hole]] and the [[Teton Range|Teton Mountain Range]]. His description of the [[Geothermal areas of Yellowstone|geothermal activity]] there seemed so outrageous to some that the area was mockingly referred to as [[Colter's Hell]]. Colter's narrow escape following capture by [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfeet]], leaving him naked and alone in the wilderness, became a legend known as \"[[John Colter#Colter's Run|Colter's Run]]\".\n* [[George Drouillard]] (1774/75?\u20131810) was a hunter, interpreter, and sign-talker on the Lewis and Clark Expedition, often considered as one of Lewis' two most appreciated members (with [[John Colter]]). Born to a French Canadian father and a Shawnee mother in Detroit, Drouillard proved to be the most skillful hunter on the expedition, notably during the harsh wintering in [[Fort Clatsop]]. He eventually went on trapping in today's [[Wyoming]] and [[Montana]] after the expedition, working for [[Manuel Lisa]] Missouri Fur Company, where he had signed on in 1807. Often venturing out alone like [[John Colter]], notably to the headwaters of the [[Bighorn River|Big Horn]] River from the [[Yellowstone]] and around the [[Three Forks of the Missouri]], George Drouillard was savagely killed in May 1810 by [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot Indians]] in the [[Three Forks, Gallatin County, Montana|Three Forks]] area.\n* [[Sylvan Ambrose Hart|Sylvan \"Buckskin Bill\" Hart]] (1906\u20131980), known as the \"Last of the Mountain Men,\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Peterson|first1=Harold|title=The Last of The Mountain Men|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1966/10/03/610646/the-last-of-the-mountain-men|website=Sports Illustrated|publisher=Time, Inc.|accessdate=20 February 2016}}</ref> lived along the [[Salmon River (Idaho)|Salmon River]] in the [[Frank Church\u2013River of No Return Wilderness|Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness]] in [[Idaho]] from 1932-1980. Harold Peterson and W. Clifford Dean wrote biographies about him, and Chana Cox wrote an autobiography about the time she and her family lived with him.\n* [[Liver-Eating Johnson|John \"Liver-Eating\" Johnson]] (1824\u20131900) was one of the more notable latter-day mountain men. Johnson worked in [[Wyoming]] and [[Montana]], trapping for beaver, buffalo, and wolf hides. Unaffiliated with a company, Johnson bargained independently to sell his hides. Elements of his story were portrayed in the film ''[[Jeremiah Johnson (film)|Jeremiah Johnson]]'', and Dennis McLelland wrote a biography about him.\n* [[Joseph Meek|Joseph Lafayette \"Joe\" Meek]] (1810\u20131875) was a trapper, law enforcement official, and politician in the [[Oregon Country]] and later [[Oregon Territory]] of the [[United States]]. A pioneer involved in the [[fur trade]] before settling in the [[Tualatin Valley]], Meek would play a prominent role at the [[Champoeg Meetings]] of 1843, where he was elected as a sheriff. Later he served in the [[Provisional Legislature of Oregon]] before being selected as the [[United States Marshal]] for the Oregon Territory.\n* [[Jedediah Smith]] (1799\u20131831) was a hunter, trapper, and fur trader whose explorations were significant in opening the American West to settlement by Europeans and Americans. Smith is considered the first man of European descent to cross the future state of [[Nevada]]; the first to traverse [[Utah]] from north to south and from west to east; and the first American to enter [[California]] by an overland route. He was also first to scale the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|High Sierra]] and explore the area from [[San Diego]] to the banks of the [[Columbia River]]. He was a successful businessman and a full partner in the [[Rocky Mountain Fur Company]] after Ashley's departure. Smith had notable facial scarring from a [[grizzly bear]] attack.\n* [[William Lewis Sublette]] (1798\u20131845) was a fur trapper, pioneer, and mountain man who, with his brothers after 1823, became an agent of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company (and later one of its owners), exploiting the riches of the Oregon Country, which helped settle the best routes later improved into the Oregon Trail.\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Coureur des bois]]''\n* [[Fort Laramie]]\n* [[James \"Grizzly\" Adams]]\n* [[Noble savage]]\n* [[Overmountain Men]]\n* [[Scottish Indian trade]]\n* [[Voyageurs]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|22em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite news|work=The Guardian| date=June 9, 2014|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/09/mountain-man-troy-james-knapp-faces-justice|title='Mountain Man' Troy James Knapp faces justice after six years on run |author=Associated Press in Salt Lake City}}\n* [[Fred R.

The majority of ethnic Russians live in the [[Russian Federation]], but notable minorities exist in other former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] states such as [[Russians in Belarus|Belarus]], [[Russians in Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]], [[Russians in Moldova|Moldova]], [[Russians in Ukraine|Ukraine]] and the [[Russians in the Baltic states|Baltic states]]. A large [[Russian diaspora]] (sometimes including [[Russophone]]s, i.e. Russian-speaking non-Russians) has developed all over the world, with notable numbers in the [[Russian Americans|United States]], [[Russians in Germany|Germany]], [[Russians in Brazil|Brazil]], and [[Russian Canadians|Canada]]. The [[Russian culture|culture of the ethnic Russian people]] has a long tradition and it is a foundation for the [[Culture of Russia|modern culture of the whole of Russia]]. The Russian language originally was the language of ethnic Russians. They are historically [[Orthodox Christians]] by religion.<!-- please more about ethnic group and its culture, less political things -->\n\n<!-- historical and cultural links of ethnic Russians -->The ethnic Russians formed from East Slavic tribes and their cultural ancestry is based in [[Kievan Rus']]. The Russian word for ethnic Russians is derived from the [[Names of Rus', Russia and Ruthenia|people of Rus' and the territory of Rus']]. The Russians share many historical and cultural traits with other European peoples, and especially with other East Slavic ethnic groups, specifically [[Belarusians]] and [[Ukrainians]]. Many ethnic groups had a common history within the former Soviet Union and Russian Empire, which was influential in the spreading of Russian culture and language. The [[Russian language]] is official in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, [[Kyrgyzstan]], and [[Tajikistan]], [[List of territorial entities where Russian is an official language|and is also spoken]] as a secondary language in many former Soviet states.\n\n<!-- influence and political significance of ethnic Russians in various counties -->The ethnic Russians make up the largest of the 194 ethnic groups who live in Russia, according to the 2010 census. Some 80.90% (111,016,896 people) of the population identified voluntarily as ethnically Russian. The [[Constitution of Russia|Constitution]] declares Russia to be a multinational (multiethnic) state and it named the  \"multinational people of Russia\" as a [[Popular sovereignty|sovereign nation]] (i.e. not ethnic Russian, officially Russia is not a [[nation state]]). The Russian word used for citizens of Russia is different from the word for ethnic Russian (see [[Citizenship of Russia]]); other languages often do not distinguish between these two groups. The Tsardom of Russia became a multi-ethnic state in the 16th century in its imperial phase (see [[History of Russia]]). The number of ethnic Russians living outside the Russian Federation is estimated at roughly between 20 and 30 million people (see [[Russian diaspora]]).\n\n==Ethnonym==\nTwo Russian words are commonly translated into English as \"Russians\". One is \"{{lang|ru|\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435}}\" (''russkiye''), which most often means \"ethnic Russians\" (the subject of this article). Another is \"{{lang|ru|\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f\u043d\u0435}}\" (''rossiyane''), which means \"[[citizens of Russia]]\". The former word refers to ethnic Russians, regardless of what country they live in or whether they hold [[Russian nationality law|Russian citizenship]]. Under certain circumstances, this term may or may not extend to denote members of other Russian-speaking ethnic groups from Russia, or from the former Soviet Union. The latter word refers to all people holding citizenship of Russia, regardless of their ethnicity, and does not include ethnic Russians living outside Russia. Translations into other languages often do not distinguish these two groups.<ref>[http://www.pravoslavie.ru/63991.html Pravoslavie.ru].

According to the most prevalent theory, the name ''Rus{{'}}'', like the Finnish name for [[Sweden]] (''Ruotsi''), is derived from an [[Old Norse]] term for \"the men who row\" (''rods-'') as rowing was the main method of navigating the rivers of Eastern Europe.

In other countries Russian faithful usually belong to the local Orthodox congregations which either have a direct connection (like the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Moscow Patriarchy|Ukrainian Orthodox Church]], [[Autonomy (Eastern Christianity)|autonomous]] from the [[Patriarch of Moscow|Moscow Patriarchate]]) or historical origin (like [[the Orthodox Church in America]] or a [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia]]) with the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nNon-religious Russians may associate themselves with the Orthodox faith for cultural reasons. Some Russian people are [[Old Believers]]: a relatively small [[Schism (religion)|schismatic]] group of the Russian Orthodoxy that rejected the liturgical reforms introduced in the 17th century. Other schisms from Orthodoxy include [[Doukhobor]]s which in the 18th century rejected secular government, the Russian Orthodox priests, icons, all church ritual, the Bible as the supreme source of divine revelation and the divinity of Jesus, and later emigrated into Canada. An even earlier sect were [[Molokan]]s which formed in 1550 and rejected Czar's [[Divine right of kings|divine right to rule]], icons, the [[Trinity]] as outlined by the [[Nicene Creed]], Orthodox [[Fasting#Eastern Orthodoxy and Greek-Catholicism|fasts]], military service, and practices including [[Baptism|water baptism]].\n\nOther world religions have negligible representation among ethnic Russians. The largest of these groups are [[Islam]] with over 100,000 followers from national minorities,<ref name=\"ArenaAtlas\">{{cite web|url=http://sreda.org/arena/arena-v-pdf|title=\u0410\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0430|publisher=}}</ref> and [[Baptists]] with over 85,000 Russian adherents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_639.html |title=statistics |publisher=Adherents.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810101834/http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_639.html |archive-date=10 August 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Others are mostly [[Pentecostals]], [[Evangelicals]], [[Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Lutherans]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].\n\nSince the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] various new religious movements have sprung up and gathered a following among ethnic Russians. The most prominent of these are [[Slavic Neopaganism|Rodnovery]], the revival of the Slavic native religion also common to other [[Slavs|Slavic nations]],<ref>Victor Shnirelman.

The majority of ethnic Russians live in the [[Russian Federation]], but notable minorities exist in other former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] states such as [[Russians in Belarus|Belarus]], [[Russians in Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]], [[Russians in Moldova|Moldova]], [[Russians in Ukraine|Ukraine]] and the [[Russians in the Baltic states|Baltic states]]. A large [[Russian diaspora]] (sometimes including [[Russophone]]s, i.e. Russian-speaking non-Russians) has developed all over the world, with notable numbers in the [[Russian Americans|United States]], [[Russians in Germany|Germany]], [[Russians in Brazil|Brazil]], and [[Russian Canadians|Canada]]. The [[Russian culture|culture of the ethnic Russian people]] has a long tradition and it is a foundation for the [[Culture of Russia|modern culture of the whole of Russia]]. The Russian language originally was the language of ethnic Russians. They are historically [[Orthodox Christians]] by religion.<!-- please more about ethnic group and its culture, less political things -->\n\n<!-- historical and cultural links of ethnic Russians -->The ethnic Russians formed from East Slavic tribes and their cultural ancestry is based in [[Kievan Rus']]. The Russian word for ethnic Russians is derived from the [[Names of Rus', Russia and Ruthenia|people of Rus' and the territory of Rus']]. The Russians share many historical and cultural traits with other European peoples, and especially with other East Slavic ethnic groups, specifically [[Belarusians]] and [[Ukrainians]]. Many ethnic groups had a common history within the former Soviet Union and Russian Empire, which was influential in the spreading of Russian culture and language. The [[Russian language]] is official in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, [[Kyrgyzstan]], and [[Tajikistan]], [[List of territorial entities where Russian is an official language|and is also spoken]] as a secondary language in many former Soviet states.\n\n<!-- influence and political significance of ethnic Russians in various counties -->The ethnic Russians make up the largest of the 194 ethnic groups who live in Russia, according to the 2010 census. Some 80.90% (111,016,896 people) of the population identified voluntarily as ethnically Russian. The [[Constitution of Russia|Constitution]] declares Russia to be a multinational (multiethnic) state and it named the  \"multinational people of Russia\" as a [[Popular sovereignty|sovereign nation]] (i.e. not ethnic Russian, officially Russia is not a [[nation state]]). The Russian word used for citizens of Russia is different from the word for ethnic Russian (see [[Citizenship of Russia]]); other languages often do not distinguish between these two groups. The Tsardom of Russia became a multi-ethnic state in the 16th century in its imperial phase (see [[History of Russia]]). The number of ethnic Russians living outside the Russian Federation is estimated at roughly between 20 and 30 million people (see [[Russian diaspora]]).\n\n==Ethnonym==\nTwo Russian words are commonly translated into English as \"Russians\". One is \"{{lang|ru|\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435}}\" (''russkiye''), which most often means \"ethnic Russians\" (the subject of this article). Another is \"{{lang|ru|\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f\u043d\u0435}}\" (''rossiyane''), which means \"[[citizens of Russia]]\". The former word refers to ethnic Russians, regardless of what country they live in or whether they hold [[Russian nationality law|Russian citizenship]]. Under certain circumstances, this term may or may not extend to denote members of other Russian-speaking ethnic groups from Russia, or from the former Soviet Union. The latter word refers to all people holding citizenship of Russia, regardless of their ethnicity, and does not include ethnic Russians living outside Russia. Translations into other languages often do not distinguish these two groups.<ref>[http://www.pravoslavie.ru/63991.html Pravoslavie.ru].

According to the most prevalent theory, the name ''Rus{{'}}'', like the Finnish name for [[Sweden]] (''Ruotsi''), is derived from an [[Old Norse]] term for \"the men who row\" (''rods-'') as rowing was the main method of navigating the rivers of Eastern Europe.

Another important aspect is the [[vowel reduction|reduction]] of [[stress (linguistics)|unstressed]] [[vowel]]s, not unlike a similar process in [[English language|English]].

While for various reasons residents of these countries might be unwilling to openly identify with Russian language, a major sociological study on the Russian language in the post-Soviet states conducted by Gallup, Inc., revealed that 92% of the survey respondents in Belarus, 83% in Ukraine, 68% in Kazakhstan and 38% in Kyrgyzstan chose Russian-language forms to complete the questionnaire for the survey (most notably, over forms in corresponding national languages).\n\nIn the U.S. state of New York in 2009, an amendment to the electoral law was adopted, according to which in all cities in the state having over a million people, all documents related to the election process should be translated into Russian (thus gaining equal status with Spanish, Korean, Filipino, Creole languages and three [[varieties of Chinese]]).\n\nIn places of compact residence of immigrants from the countries of the former USSR (Israel, Germany, Canada, the United States, Australia, etc.) Russian-language periodicals, radio and television channels are available, as well as Russian-language schools.\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Russian Orthodox Church|Religion in Russia}} [[File:RedSquare SaintBasile (pixinn.net).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] on the [[Red Square]], [[Moscow]]]]\nAs of a different sociological surveys on religious adherence, from 41% to over 80% of the total population of [[Russia]] adhere to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].<ref name=\"ArenaAtlas\" /><ref name=\"Filina\">Olga Filina (Ogonek Magazine).

In other countries Russian faithful usually belong to the local Orthodox congregations which either have a direct connection (like the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Moscow Patriarchy|Ukrainian Orthodox Church]], [[Autonomy (Eastern Christianity)|autonomous]] from the [[Patriarch of Moscow|Moscow Patriarchate]]) or historical origin (like [[the Orthodox Church in America]] or a [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia]]) with the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nNon-religious Russians may associate themselves with the Orthodox faith for cultural reasons. Some Russian people are [[Old Believers]]: a relatively small [[Schism (religion)|schismatic]] group of the Russian Orthodoxy that rejected the liturgical reforms introduced in the 17th century. Other schisms from Orthodoxy include [[Doukhobor]]s which in the 18th century rejected secular government, the Russian Orthodox priests, icons, all church ritual, the Bible as the supreme source of divine revelation and the divinity of Jesus, and later emigrated into Canada. An even earlier sect were [[Molokan]]s which formed in 1550 and rejected Czar's [[Divine right of kings|divine right to rule]], icons, the [[Trinity]] as outlined by the [[Nicene Creed]], Orthodox [[Fasting#Eastern Orthodoxy and Greek-Catholicism|fasts]], military service, and practices including [[Baptism|water baptism]].\n\nOther world religions have negligible representation among ethnic Russians. The largest of these groups are [[Islam]] with over 100,000 followers from national minorities,<ref name=\"ArenaAtlas\">{{cite web|url=http://sreda.org/arena/arena-v-pdf|title=\u0410\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0430|publisher=}}</ref> and [[Baptists]] with over 85,000 Russian adherents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_639.html |title=statistics |publisher=Adherents.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810101834/http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_639.html |archive-date=10 August 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Others are mostly [[Pentecostals]], [[Evangelicals]], [[Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Lutherans]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].\n\nSince the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] various new religious movements have sprung up and gathered a following among ethnic Russians.

In Green Town, Bradbury's favorite uncle sprouts wings, traveling carnivals conceal supernatural powers, and his grandparents provide room and board to [[Charles Dickens]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Summer Morning, Summer Night by Ray Bradbury|url=https://subterraneanpress.com/store/product_detail/summer_morning_summer_night|website=Subterranean Press|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822143044/http://subterraneanpress.com/store/product_detail/summer_morning_summer_night|archivedate=August 22, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Perhaps the most definitive usage of the pseudonym for his hometown, in ''Summer Morning, Summer Night'', a collection of short stories and vignettes exclusively about Green Town, Bradbury returns to the signature locale as a look back at the rapidly disappearing small-town world of the American heartland, which was the foundation of his roots.<ref>Sites from these works which still exist in Waukegan include his boyhood home, his grandparents' home next door (and their connecting lawns where  his grandfather and he gathered dandelions to make wine) and, less than a block away, the famous ravine which Bradbury used as a [[metaphor]] throughout his career.</ref>\n\n==Cultural contributions==\nBradbury wrote many short essays on the culture and the arts, attracting the attention of critics in this field, but he used his fiction to explore and criticize his culture and society. Bradbury observed, for example, that ''Fahrenheit 451'' touches on the alienation of people by media:\n{{quote|In writing the short novel ''Fahrenheit 451'' I thought I was describing a world that might evolve in four or five decades. But only a few weeks ago, in [[Beverly Hills]] one night, a husband and wife passed me, walking their dog. I stood staring after them, absolutely stunned. The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear. There she was, oblivious to man and dog, listening to far winds and whispers and soap opera cries, [[sleep walking]], helped up and down curbs by a husband who might just as well not have been there. This was not fiction.<ref>Quoted by [[Kingsley Amis]] in ''New Maps of Hell: A Survey of Science Fiction'' (1960).</ref>}}\n\nBradbury stated the novel worked as a critique of the later development of [[political correctness]]:\n{{quote|How does the story of ''Fahrenheit 451'' stand up in 1994?<br />\nR.B.: It works even better because we have political correctness now. Political correctness is the real enemy these days. The black groups want to control our thinking and you can't say certain  things. The homosexual groups don't want you to criticize them.

He took a Greyhound bus to New York and checked into a room at the YMCA for 50 cents a night. He took his short stories to a dozen publishers and no one wanted them. Just before getting ready to go home, Bradbury had dinner with an editor at Doubleday. When Bradbury recounted that everyone wanted a novel and he did not have one, the editor, coincidentally named Walter Bradbury, asked if the short stories might be tied together into a book-length collection. The title was the editor's idea; he suggested, \"You could call it ''The Martian Chronicles''.\" Bradbury liked the idea and recalled making notes in 1944 to do a book set on Mars. That evening, he stayed up all night at the YMCA and typed out an outline. He took it to the Doubleday editor the next morning, who read it and wrote Bradbury a check for $750. When Bradbury returned to Los Angeles, he connected all the short stories that became ''The Martian Chronicles.''<ref name=\"Paris Review\"/>\n\n===Intended first novel===\nWhat was later issued as a collection of stories and vignettes, ''Summer Morning, Summer Night'', started out to be Bradbury's first true novel. The core of the work was Bradbury's witnessing of the American small-town life in the American heartland.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nIn the winter of 1955\u201356, after a consultation with his Doubleday editor, Bradbury deferred publication of a novel based on Green Town, the pseudonym for his hometown. Instead, he extracted 17 stories and, with three other Green Town tales, bridged them into his 1957 book ''Dandelion Wine''. Later, in 2006, Bradbury published the original novel remaining after the extraction, and retitled it ''Farewell Summer''. These two titles show what stories and episodes Bradbury decided to retain as he created the two books out of one.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe most significant of the remaining unpublished stories, scenes, and fragments were published under the originally intended name for the novel, ''Summer Morning, Summer Night'', in 2007.<ref>[http://www.pspublishing.co.uk/dandelion-wine-50th-anniversary-ed-signed-2-vol-sc-by-ray-bradbury--stephen-king-out-of-print-1022-p.asp Summer Morning, Summer Night], by Ray Bradbury; PS Publishing, 2007</ref>\n\n==Adaptations to other media==\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2018}}\n[[File:Ray Bradbury 1959.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Bradbury in 1959, when some of his short stories were adapted for television shows like ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'']]\nFrom 1950 to 1954, 31 of Bradbury's stories were adapted by [[Al Feldstein]] for [[EC Comics]] (seven of them uncredited in six stories, including \"Kaleidoscope\" and \"Rocket Man\" being combined as \"Home To Stay\" - for which Bradbury was retroactively paid - and EC's first version of \"The Handler\" under the title \"A Strange Undertaking\") and 16 of these were collected in the paperbacks, ''[[The Autumn People]]'' (1965) and ''[[Tomorrow Midnight]]'' (1966), both published by [[Ballantine Books]] with cover illustrations by [[Frank Frazetta]].\nAlso in the early 1950s, adaptations of Bradbury's stories were televised in several anthology shows, including ''[[Tales of Tomorrow]]'', ''[[Lights Out (radio show)|Lights Out]]'', ''Out There'', ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]'', ''[[CBS Television Workshop]]'', ''[[Fireside Theater|Jane Wyman's Fireside Theatre]]'', ''[[Star Tonight]]'', ''Windows'' and ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''. \"The Merry-Go-Round\", a half-hour film adaptation of Bradbury's \"The Black Ferris\", praised by ''Variety'', was shown on ''Starlight Summer Theater'' in 1954 and NBC's ''Sneak Preview'' in 1956. During that same period, several stories were adapted for radio drama, notably on the science fiction anthologies ''[[Dimension X (radio program)|Dimension X]]'' and its successor ''[[X Minus One]]''.\n\n[[File:Rhedosaurus & the lighthouse.png|thumb|left|Scene from the 1953 film ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'', based on Bradbury's 1951 short story \"[[The Fog Horn]]\"]]\n\nProducer [[William Alland]] first brought Bradbury to movie theaters in 1953 with ''[[It Came from Outer Space]]'', a [[Harry Essex]] screenplay developed from Bradbury's screen treatment \"Atomic Monster\". Three weeks later came the release of Eug\u00e8ne Louri\u00e9's ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'' (1953), which featured one scene based on Bradbury's \"[[The Fog Horn]]\", about a sea monster mistaking the sound of a fog horn for the mating cry of a female. Bradbury's close friend Ray Harryhausen produced the stop-motion animation of the creature. Bradbury later returned the favor by writing a short story, \"Tyrannosaurus Rex\", about a stop-motion animator who strongly resembled Harryhausen. Over the next 50 years, more than 35 features, shorts, and TV movies were based on Bradbury's stories or screenplays.\nBradbury was hired in 1953 by director [[John Huston]] to work on the screenplay for his film version of [[Herman Melville|Melville]]'s ''[[Moby Dick (1956 film)|Moby Dick]]'' (1956), which stars [[Gregory Peck]] as Captain Ahab, [[Richard Basehart]] as Ishmael, and [[Orson Welles]] as Father Mapple. A significant result of the film was Bradbury's book ''[[Green Shadows, White Whale]]'', a semifictionalized account of the making of the film, including Bradbury's dealings with Huston and his time in Ireland, where exterior scenes that were set in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]], were filmed.\n\nBradbury's short story ''I Sing the Body Electric'' (from the book of the same name) was adapted for the [[I Sing the Body Electric (The Twilight Zone)|100th episode of ''The Twilight Zone'']]. The episode was first aired on May 18, 1962.\n\nBradbury and director Charles Rome Smith co-founded the Pandemonium Theatre Company in 1964.  Its first production was ''The World of Ray Bradbury'', consisting of one-act adaptations of \"[[The Pedestrian]]\", \"The Veldt\", and \"To the Chicago Abyss\".  It ran for four months at the Coronet Theatre in Los Angeles (October 1964 - February 1965); an off-Broadway production was presented in October 1965.  Another Pandemonium Theatre Company production was mounted at the Coronet Theatre in 1965, again presenting adaptations of three Bradbury short stories: \"The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit,\" \"The Day It Rained Forever,\" and \"Device Out of Time.\" (The last was adapted from his 1957 novel ''Dandelion Wine''). The original cast for this production featured [[Booth Coleman]], [[Joby Baker]], Fredric Villani, Arnold Lessing, Eddie Sallia, [[Keith Taylor (actor)|Keith Taylor]], [[Richard Bull (actor)|Richard Bull]], Gene Otis Shane, Henry T. Delgado, [[F. Murray Abraham]], Anne Loos, and [[Len Lesser]].  The director, again, was Charles Rome Smith.\n\n[[Oskar Werner]] and [[Julie Christie]] starred in ''[[Fahrenheit 451 (1966 film)|Fahrenheit 451]]'' (1966), an adaptation of Bradbury's novel directed by [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]].\n\nIn 1966, Bradbury helped [[Lynn Garrison]] create ''AVIAN'', a specialist aviation magazine. For the first issue, Bradbury wrote a poem, \"Planes That Land on Grass\".\n\nIn 1969, ''[[The Illustrated Man]]'' was brought to the big screen, starring [[Rod Steiger]], [[Claire Bloom]], and [[Robert Drivas]]. Containing the prologue and three short stories from the book, the film received mediocre reviews. The same year, Bradbury approached composer [[Jerry Goldsmith]], who had worked with Bradbury in dramatic radio of the 1950s and later scored the [[The Illustrated Man (film)|film version]], to compose a [[cantata]] ''[[Christus Apollo]]'' based on Bradbury's text.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |last=Goldsmith |first=Jerry |date=2002 |title=Jerry Goldsmith: Christus Apollo |type=CD |publisher=[[Telarc International Corporation|Telarc]]}}</ref> The work premiered in late 1969, with the [[California Chamber Symphony]] performing with narrator [[Charlton Heston]] at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]].\n\n[[File:Ray Bradbury at Caltech 12 November 1971.ogv|right|thumb|Ray Bradbury takes part in a symposium at Caltech with [[Arthur C.

The full-cast dramatizations featured adaptations of \"The Ravine\", \"Night Call, Collect\", \"[[The Veldt (short story)|The Veldt]]\", \"There Was an Old Woman\", \"Kaleidoscope\", \"[[Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed]]\", \"The Screaming Woman\", \"[[A Sound of Thunder]]\", \"The Man\", \"The Wind\", \"The Fox and the Forest\", \"[[Here There Be Tygers]]\", and \"The Happiness Machine\". Voiceover actor [[Paul Frees]] provided narration, while Bradbury was responsible for the opening voiceover; Greg Hansen and Roger Hoffman scored the episodes. The series won a [[Peabody Award]] and two Gold Cindy awards, and was released on CD on May 1, 2010. The series began airing on [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]] on June 12, 2011.\n\nFrom 1985 to 1992, Bradbury hosted a [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] anthology television series, ''[[The Ray Bradbury Theater]]'', for which he adapted 65 of his stories.

Bradbury observed, for example, that ''Fahrenheit 451'' touches on the alienation of people by media:\n{{quote|In writing the short novel ''Fahrenheit 451'' I thought I was describing a world that might evolve in four or five decades.

The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear. There she was, oblivious to man and dog, listening to far winds and whispers and soap opera cries, [[sleep walking]], helped up and down curbs by a husband who might just as well not have been there. This was not fiction.<ref>Quoted by [[Kingsley Amis]] in ''New Maps of Hell: A Survey of Science Fiction'' (1960).</ref>}}\n\nBradbury stated the novel worked as a critique of the later development of [[political correctness]]:\n{{quote|How does the story of ''Fahrenheit 451'' stand up in 1994?<br />\nR.B.: It works even better because we have political correctness now.

He took a Greyhound bus to New York and checked into a room at the YMCA for 50 cents a night. He took his short stories to a dozen publishers and no one wanted them. Just before getting ready to go home, Bradbury had dinner with an editor at Doubleday. When Bradbury recounted that everyone wanted a novel and he did not have one, the editor, coincidentally named Walter Bradbury, asked if the short stories might be tied together into a book-length collection. The title was the editor's idea; he suggested, \"You could call it ''The Martian Chronicles''.\" Bradbury liked the idea and recalled making notes in 1944 to do a book set on Mars. That evening, he stayed up all night at the YMCA and typed out an outline. He took it to the Doubleday editor the next morning, who read it and wrote Bradbury a check for $750. When Bradbury returned to Los Angeles, he connected all the short stories that became ''The Martian Chronicles.''<ref name=\"Paris Review\"/>\n\n===Intended first novel===\nWhat was later issued as a collection of stories and vignettes, ''Summer Morning, Summer Night'', started out to be Bradbury's first true novel. The core of the work was Bradbury's witnessing of the American small-town life in the American heartland.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nIn the winter of 1955\u201356, after a consultation with his Doubleday editor, Bradbury deferred publication of a novel based on Green Town, the pseudonym for his hometown. Instead, he extracted 17 stories and, with three other Green Town tales, bridged them into his 1957 book ''Dandelion Wine''. Later, in 2006, Bradbury published the original novel remaining after the extraction, and retitled it ''Farewell Summer''. These two titles show what stories and episodes Bradbury decided to retain as he created the two books out of one.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe most significant of the remaining unpublished stories, scenes, and fragments were published under the originally intended name for the novel, ''Summer Morning, Summer Night'', in 2007.<ref>[http://www.pspublishing.co.uk/dandelion-wine-50th-anniversary-ed-signed-2-vol-sc-by-ray-bradbury--stephen-king-out-of-print-1022-p.asp Summer Morning, Summer Night], by Ray Bradbury; PS Publishing, 2007</ref>\n\n==Adaptations to other media==\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2018}}\n[[File:Ray Bradbury 1959.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Bradbury in 1959, when some of his short stories were adapted for television shows like ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'']]\nFrom 1950 to 1954, 31 of Bradbury's stories were adapted by [[Al Feldstein]] for [[EC Comics]] (seven of them uncredited in six stories, including \"Kaleidoscope\" and \"Rocket Man\" being combined as \"Home To Stay\" - for which Bradbury was retroactively paid - and EC's first version of \"The Handler\" under the title \"A Strange Undertaking\") and 16 of these were collected in the paperbacks, ''[[The Autumn People]]'' (1965) and ''[[Tomorrow Midnight]]'' (1966), both published by [[Ballantine Books]] with cover illustrations by [[Frank Frazetta]].\nAlso in the early 1950s, adaptations of Bradbury's stories were televised in several anthology shows, including ''[[Tales of Tomorrow]]'', ''[[Lights Out (radio show)|Lights Out]]'', ''Out There'', ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]'', ''[[CBS Television Workshop]]'', ''[[Fireside Theater|Jane Wyman's Fireside Theatre]]'', ''[[Star Tonight]]'', ''Windows'' and ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''. \"The Merry-Go-Round\", a half-hour film adaptation of Bradbury's \"The Black Ferris\", praised by ''Variety'', was shown on ''Starlight Summer Theater'' in 1954 and NBC's ''Sneak Preview'' in 1956. During that same period, several stories were adapted for radio drama, notably on the science fiction anthologies ''[[Dimension X (radio program)|Dimension X]]'' and its successor ''[[X Minus One]]''.\n\n[[File:Rhedosaurus & the lighthouse.png|thumb|left|Scene from the 1953 film ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'', based on Bradbury's 1951 short story \"[[The Fog Horn]]\"]]\n\nProducer [[William Alland]] first brought Bradbury to movie theaters in 1953 with ''[[It Came from Outer Space]]'', a [[Harry Essex]] screenplay developed from Bradbury's screen treatment \"Atomic Monster\". Three weeks later came the release of Eug\u00e8ne Louri\u00e9's ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'' (1953), which featured one scene based on Bradbury's \"[[The Fog Horn]]\", about a sea monster mistaking the sound of a fog horn for the mating cry of a female. Bradbury's close friend Ray Harryhausen produced the stop-motion animation of the creature. Bradbury later returned the favor by writing a short story, \"Tyrannosaurus Rex\", about a stop-motion animator who strongly resembled Harryhausen. Over the next 50 years, more than 35 features, shorts, and TV movies were based on Bradbury's stories or screenplays.\nBradbury was hired in 1953 by director [[John Huston]] to work on the screenplay for his film version of [[Herman Melville|Melville]]'s ''[[Moby Dick (1956 film)|Moby Dick]]'' (1956), which stars [[Gregory Peck]] as Captain Ahab, [[Richard Basehart]] as Ishmael, and [[Orson Welles]] as Father Mapple. A significant result of the film was Bradbury's book ''[[Green Shadows, White Whale]]'', a semifictionalized account of the making of the film, including Bradbury's dealings with Huston and his time in Ireland, where exterior scenes that were set in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]], were filmed.\n\nBradbury's short story ''I Sing the Body Electric'' (from the book of the same name) was adapted for the [[I Sing the Body Electric (The Twilight Zone)|100th episode of ''The Twilight Zone'']]. The episode was first aired on May 18, 1962.\n\nBradbury and director Charles Rome Smith co-founded the Pandemonium Theatre Company in 1964.  Its first production was ''The World of Ray Bradbury'', consisting of one-act adaptations of \"[[The Pedestrian]]\", \"The Veldt\", and \"To the Chicago Abyss\".  It ran for four months at the Coronet Theatre in Los Angeles (October 1964 - February 1965); an off-Broadway production was presented in October 1965.  Another Pandemonium Theatre Company production was mounted at the Coronet Theatre in 1965, again presenting adaptations of three Bradbury short stories: \"The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit,\" \"The Day It Rained Forever,\" and \"Device Out of Time.\" (The last was adapted from his 1957 novel ''Dandelion Wine''). The original cast for this production featured [[Booth Coleman]], [[Joby Baker]], Fredric Villani, Arnold Lessing, Eddie Sallia, [[Keith Taylor (actor)|Keith Taylor]], [[Richard Bull (actor)|Richard Bull]], Gene Otis Shane, Henry T. Delgado, [[F. Murray Abraham]], Anne Loos, and [[Len Lesser]].  The director, again, was Charles Rome Smith.\n\n[[Oskar Werner]] and [[Julie Christie]] starred in ''[[Fahrenheit 451 (1966 film)|Fahrenheit 451]]'' (1966), an adaptation of Bradbury's novel directed by [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]].\n\nIn 1966, Bradbury helped [[Lynn Garrison]] create ''AVIAN'', a specialist aviation magazine. For the first issue, Bradbury wrote a poem, \"Planes That Land on Grass\".\n\nIn 1969, ''[[The Illustrated Man]]'' was brought to the big screen, starring [[Rod Steiger]], [[Claire Bloom]], and [[Robert Drivas]]. Containing the prologue and three short stories from the book, the film received mediocre reviews. The same year, Bradbury approached composer [[Jerry Goldsmith]], who had worked with Bradbury in dramatic radio of the 1950s and later scored the [[The Illustrated Man (film)|film version]], to compose a [[cantata]] ''[[Christus Apollo]]'' based on Bradbury's text.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |last=Goldsmith |first=Jerry |date=2002 |title=Jerry Goldsmith: Christus Apollo |type=CD |publisher=[[Telarc International Corporation|Telarc]]}}</ref> The work premiered in late 1969, with the [[California Chamber Symphony]] performing with narrator [[Charlton Heston]] at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]].\n\n[[File:Ray Bradbury at Caltech 12 November 1971.ogv|right|thumb|Ray Bradbury takes part in a symposium at Caltech with [[Arthur C.

Voiceover actor [[Paul Frees]] provided narration, while Bradbury was responsible for the opening voiceover; Greg Hansen and Roger Hoffman scored the episodes. The series won a [[Peabody Award]] and two Gold Cindy awards, and was released on CD on May 1, 2010. The series began airing on [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]] on June 12, 2011.\n\nFrom 1985 to 1992, Bradbury hosted a [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] anthology television series, ''[[The Ray Bradbury Theater]]'', for which he adapted 65 of his stories.

During the first two seasons, Bradbury also provided additional voiceover narration specific to the featured story and appeared on screen.\n\nDeeply respected in the [[USSR]], Bradbury's fiction has been adapted into five episodes of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] science-fiction TV series ''This Fantastic World'' which adapted the stories film version of \"I Sing The Body Electric\", ''Fahrenheit 451'', \"A Piece of Wood\", \"To the Chicago Abyss\", and \"Forever and the Earth\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gtrf.ru/|title=State fund of Television and Radio Programs|language=Russian}}</ref> In 1984 a cartoon adaptation of [[There Will Come Soft Rains (short story)|There Will Come Soft Rains]] (\u00ab\u0411\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u043b\u0430\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0436\u0434\u044c\u00bb) came out by [[Uzbekistan|Uzbek]] director Nazim Tyuhladziev.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kinomaniac.ru/movie.php?id=1366|script-title=ru:\u0411\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u043b\u0430\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0436\u0434\u044c|language=Russian|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120909130617/http://www.kinomaniac.ru/movie.php?id=1366|archivedate=September 9, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> He made a film adaptation of [[The Veldt (film)|''The Veldt'' in 1987]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://raybradbury.ru/video-stage/video/the_veldt/|script-title=ru:\"\u0412\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0434\", \u041a\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0438\u044f \"\u0423\u0437\u0431\u0435\u043a\u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c\", 1987|language=Russian}}</ref> In 1989, a cartoon adaptation of \"[[Here There Be Tygers]]\" (\u00ab\u0417\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443\u0442 \u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0442\u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b\u00bb) by director Vladimir Samsonov came out.<ref>{{cite web|script-title=ru:\u041c\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0438\u043f\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c\u044b|url=http://mebu.ru/stf/catalog.php?fl=1&letter=%c7|website=\u0422\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u044a\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u00ab\u042d\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043d\u00bb|accessdate=14 August 2015|language=Russian|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201212324/http://mebu.ru/stf/catalog.php?fl=1|archive-date=February 1, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nBradbury wrote and narrated the 1993 animated television version of ''[[The Halloween Tree (1993 TV film)|The Halloween Tree]]'', based on [[The Halloween Tree|his 1972 novel]].\n\nThe 1998 film ''[[The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit]]'', released by [[Touchstone Pictures]], was written by Bradbury.

Some of the controversy regarding the definitions and assessment of tall structures and buildings has included the following:\n* the definition of a structure, a building and a tower \n* whether a structure, building or tower under construction should be included in any assessment\n* whether a structure, building or tower has to be officially opened before it is assessed\n* whether structures built in and rising above water should have their below-water height included in any assessment.\n* whether a structure, building or tower that is guyed is assessed in the same category as self-supporting structures.\n\nWithin an accepted definition of a building further controversy has included the following factors:\n* whether only habitable height of the building is considered\n* whether communication towers with [[Observation gallery|observation galleries]] should be considered \"habitable\" in this sense\n* whether rooftop [[antenna (electronics)|antennas]], viewing platforms or any other architecture that does not form a habitable floor should be included in the assessment\n* whether a floor built at a high level of a telecommunications or viewing tower should change the tower's definition to that of a \"building\"\n\n==Tallest structures==\n{{Main|List of tallest structures in the world}}\n[[Image:Maszt radiowy w Konstantynowie.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Warsaw radio mast]], the height record holder from 1974 to 1991]]\n[[File:Toronto's CN Tower.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[CN Tower]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], was the world's tallest freestanding structure from 1975 to 2007.]]\nThis category does not require the structure to be \"officially\" open but does require it to be \"topped out.\"\n\nThe tallest artificial structure is [[Burj Khalifa]], a skyscraper in Dubai that reached {{convert|829.8|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in height on January 17, 2009.<ref name=Biz24720090117>{{cite web|url=http://www.business24-7.ae/articles/2009/1/pages/01182009_63dc3a90c9a848219058be301f3f7ded.aspx |title=Burj Dubai all set for 09/09/09 soft opening |publisher=Emirates Business24/7 |accessdate=January 17, 2009}}</ref> By April 8, 2008 it had been built higher than the [[KVLY-TV mast]] in North Dakota, USA.<ref name=\"emaar-kvly-surpassed\">{{cite press release|url=http://www.emaar.ae/MediaCenter/PressReleases/2008April07.asp|title=Burj Dubai surpasses KVLY-TV mast to become the world\u2019s tallest man-made structure|publisher=Emaar|accessdate=May 28, 2008}}</ref> That September it officially surpassed [[Poland]]'s {{convert|646.38|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Warsaw radio mast]], which stood from 1974 to 1991, to become the tallest structure ever built. Guyed lattice towers such as these masts had held the world height record since 1954.\n\nThe [[Petronius Platform]] stands {{convert|610|m|ft|abbr=on}} off the sea floor leading some, including ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' 2007, to claim it as the tallest freestanding structure in the world. However, it is debated whether underwater height should be counted, in the same manner as height below ground is ignored on buildings. The [[Troll A platform]] is {{convert|472|m|ft|abbr=on}}, without any part of that height being supported by wires. The [[tension-leg platform|tension-leg]] type of oil platform has even greater below-water heights with several examples more than {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep. However, these platforms are not considered constant structures as the vast majority of their height is made up of the length of the tendons attaching the floating platforms to the sea floor. Despite this, ''Guinness World Records'' 2009 listed the [[Ursa tension leg platform]] as the tallest structure in the world with a total height of {{convert|1306|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The [[Magnolia Tension-leg Platform]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] is even taller with a total height of {{convert|1432|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[Taipei 101]] in Taipei, Taiwan, set records in three of the four skyscraper categories at the time it opened in 2004; at the time the Burj Khalifa opened in 2010 it remained the world's tallest inhabited building {{convert|509.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} as measured to its architectural height (spire). The height of its roof {{convert|449.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} and highest occupied floor {{convert|439.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} had been surpassed by the [[Shanghai World Financial Center]] with corresponding heights of {{convert|487|and|474|m|ft|abbr=on}}. [[Willis Tower]] (formerly Sears Tower) was the highest in the final category: the greatest height to top of antenna of any building in the world at {{convert|527|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\nBurj Khalifa broke the height record in all four categories for completed buildings.\n\n===Tallest structure by category===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2007}}\n\nDue to the disagreements over how to measure height and classify structures, engineers have created various definitions for categories of buildings and other structures. One measure includes the absolute height of a building, another includes only [[spire]]s and other permanent architectural features, but not [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]]. The tradition of including the spire on top of a building and not including the antenna dates back to the rivalry between the [[Chrysler Building]] and [[40 Wall Street]]. A modern-day example is that the antenna on top of [[Willis Tower]] (formerly Sears Tower) is not considered part of its architectural height, while the spires on top of the [[Petronas Twin Towers]] are counted.\n\n''Note:'' The following table is a list of the tallest completed structure in each of the structural categories below.

It was generally understood to be the height of the building to the top of its architectural elements including spires, but not including \"temporary\" structures (such as antennas or flagpoles), which could be added or changed relatively easily without requiring major changes to the building's design. Other criteria for height measurement generally were not considered, which occasionally caused some controversy.\n\nOne historic case involved the building now famous for the [[Times Square Ball]]. Known as [[One Times Square]] (at 1475 [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]]), it was the headquarters for '' [[The New York Times]], '' which gave [[Times Square]] its name. Completed in 1905, it reached a height of {{convert|364|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} to its roof, or {{convert|420|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} including its rooftop flagpole, which the  '' Times '' hoped would give it a record high status. But because a flagpole is not an integral architectural part of a building, One Times Square was not generally considered to be taller than the {{convert|390|ft|m|adj=mid|-high|sp=us}} [[Park Row Building]] in [[Lower Manhattan]], which was therefore still [[List of tallest buildings in New York City#Timeline of Tallest Buildings|New York's tallest]].<ref name=\"ctbuh.org\">{{cite web|url=http://ctbuh.org/AboutCTBUH/History/MeasuringTall/tabid/1320/language/en-US/Default.aspx|title=History of Measuring Tall Buildings|publisher=|accessdate=May 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410072709/http://www.ctbuh.org/AboutCTBUH/History/MeasuringTall/tabid/1320/language/en-US/Default.aspx|archive-date=April 10, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nA bigger controversy was the rivalry between two [[New York City|New York]] [[skyscrapers]] built in the [[Roaring Twenties]] \u2014 the [[Chrysler Building]] and the [[Bank of Manhattan Trust Building]], now called the [[Trump Building]] but better known as [[40 Wall Street]] (thus avoiding confusion with the many other [[List of things named after Donald Trump|Trump-named buildings]]). The latter was {{convert|927|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} tall, had a shorter pinnacle, and had a much higher top occupied floor (the second category in the 1996 criteria for tallest building). In contrast, the Chrysler Building employed a very long {{convert|125|ft|m|adj=on}} spire secretly assembled inside the building to claim the title of world's tallest building with a total height of {{convert|1048|ft|m}}, despite having a lower top occupied floor and a shorter height when both buildings' spires are not counted in their heights. Although the [[architect of record|architects of record]] for 40 Wall were [[H. Craig Severance]] and [[Yasuo Matsui]], the firm of [[Shreve & Lamb]] (who also designed the [[Empire State Building]]) served as consulting architects. They wrote a newspaper article claiming that 40 Wall was actually the tallest, since it contained the world's highest usable floor. They pointed out that the observation deck of 40 Wall was nearly {{convert|100|ft|m}} higher than the top floor of the Chrysler, whose surpassing spire was strictly ornamental and essentially inaccessible.<ref>Binders, George (August 2006). 101 of the World's Tallest Buildings. p. 102.</ref> Despite the protest, the Chrysler Building was generally accepted as the tallest building in the world for almost a year, until it was surpassed by the [[Empire State Building]]\u2019s {{convert|1250|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} in 1931.\n\nThat was in turn surpassed by the {{convert|1368|ft|m|adj=mid|-high|sp=us}} twin towers of New York\u2019s original [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] in 1972, which were in turn surpassed by the [[Sears Tower]] in [[Chicago]] in 1974. Now called the [[Willis Tower]] (since 2009) it was {{convert|1451|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} to its flat rooftop, or {{convert|1518|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} including its original antennas.<ref name=\"skyscraperpage.com\">{{cite web|url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=5/|title=Willis Tower, Chicago - SkyscraperPage.com |website=SkyscraperPage.com |publisher=|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}</ref> But in 1978 One World Trade Center (commonly known as the north tower) attained a taller absolute height when it added its {{convert|360|ft|m|adj=on}} new broadcasting antenna, for a total height of {{convert|1728|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}. The WTC north tower maintained this height record (including its antenna) from 1978 until 2000, when the owners of the Willis Tower extended its broadcasting antennae for a total height of {{convert|1729|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}.<ref name=\"skyscraperpage.com\"/> Thus the status of the Willis Tower as the \u201ctotally\u201d tallest was restored in the face of a new threat looming in the [[Far East]] \u2014 the \u201c[[Petronas Towers|Siamese Twins]].\u201d\n\n[[File:Petronas Twin Towers 2010 April.jpg|thumb|right|The Petronas Towers remain the tallest twin towers in the world.]]\n\nA major controversy erupted upon completion of the [[Petronas Towers]] in [[Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia]] in 1998. These twin towers, at {{convert|1483|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}, had a higher architectural height (spires, not antennas), but a lower absolute pinnacle height and a lower top occupied floor than the [[Willis Tower]] in [[Chicago]]. Counting buildings as structures with floors throughout, and with antenna masts excluded, the Willis was still considered the tallest at that time. Excluding their spires, which are {{convert|9|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} higher than the flat roof of Willis, the Petronas Towers are not taller than Willis. At their convention in Chicago, the [[Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat]] (CTBUH) found the Willis Tower (without its antennas) to be the third-tallest building, and the Petronas Towers (with their spires) to be the world's two tallest buildings.<ref name=\"ctbuh.org\"/>\n\nResponding to the ensuing controversy, the CTBUH then revised their criteria and defined four categories in which the world's tallest building can be measured,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctbuh.org/HighRiseInfo/TallestDatabase/Criteria/tabid/446/Default.aspx|title=CTBUH Criteria for Defining and Measuring Tall Buildings|publisher=|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}</ref> retaining the old criterion of height to architectural top, and adding three new categories:<ref name=\"ctbuh.org\"/>\n\n# Height to Architectural Top (including [[spire]]s and pinnacles, but not antennas, masts or flagpoles).

At the time, the Willis Tower held first place in the second and third categories, the Petronas Towers held the first category, and the original WTC north tower held the fourth (height to tip) category with its antenna.<ref name=\"ctbuh.org\"/> In 2000, however, a new antenna mast was placed on the Willis Tower, giving it the record in the fourth category. On April 20, 2004, the 101-storey [[Taipei 101]] in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]], was completed, taking the world record for the first three categories. On July 21, 2007, it was announced that [[Burj Khalifa]] in [[Dubai, UAE]], had surpassed Taipei 101. Since its completion in early 2010, Burj Khalifa leads in all categories (the first building to do so) with its spire height of {{convert|2722|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}.\n\nBefore Burj Khalifa was completed, Willis Tower led in the height-to-tip category with {{convert|1729|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} after its antenna was extended in 2000, making Willis Tower slightly taller height-to-tip than the WTC north tower's antenna that measured {{convert|1728|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}.  After the [[September 11, 2001, attacks]], the WTC became the world's tallest two buildings to be destroyed or demolished. They took that distinction from the [[Singer Building]], which stood {{convert|612|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} tall until the late 1960s where [[One Liberty Plaza]] now stands right across [[Church Street (Manhattan)|Church Street]] from the WTC site.\n\nA different superlative for skyscrapers is their [[List of buildings with 100 floors or more|number of floors]]. The original World Trade Center set that record at 110 in the early 1970s, and this was not surpassed until the Burj Khalifa opened in 2010.\n\nStructures such as the CN Tower, the [[Ostankino Tower]] and the [[Oriental Pearl Tower]] are excluded from these categories because they are not \"habitable buildings\", which are defined as frame structures made with floors and walls throughout.<ref name=\"ctbuh criteria\"/>\n\n===History of record holders in each [[Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat|CTBUH]] category===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''Date (event)'''||| '''Architectural top''' || '''Highest occupied floor''' || '''Roof''' || '''Tip'''\n|-\n|2010: [[Burj Khalifa]] completed || Burj Khalifa || Burj Khalifa || || Burj Khalifa\n|-\n|2009: [[CTBUH]] omits ''Height to Roof'' category || Taipei 101 || Shanghai World Financial Center || || Willis Tower\n|-\n|2008: [[Shanghai World Financial Center]] completed || Taipei 101 || Shanghai World Financial Center || Shanghai World Financial Center || Willis Tower\n|-\n|2003: [[Taipei 101]] completed || Taipei 101 || Taipei 101 || Taipei 101 || Willis Tower\n|-\n|2000: [[Willis Tower]] antenna extension || Petronas Towers || Willis Tower || Willis Tower || Willis Tower\n|-\n|1998: [[Petronas Towers]] completed|| Petronas Towers || Willis Tower || Willis Tower || World Trade Center\n|-\n|1996: CTBUH defines categories|| Willis Tower || Willis Tower || Willis Tower || World Trade Center\n|}\n\n==Tallest freestanding structures on land==\n{{Main|List of tallest freestanding structures}}\n[https://www.placeforvisit.com/2020/03/tallest-building-in-the-world.html Full list of tallest buildings in the world]\nFreestanding structures must not be supported by guy wires, the sea or other types of support.

Various standards have been used by different organizations which has meant that the title of [https://www.placeforvisit.com/2020/03/tallest-building-in-the-world.html world's tallest building] or structure building has changed depending on which standards have been accepted. The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat has changed its definitions over time. Some of the controversy regarding the definitions and assessment of tall structures and buildings has included the following:\n* the definition of a structure, a building and a tower \n* whether a structure, building or tower under construction should be included in any assessment\n* whether a structure, building or tower has to be officially opened before it is assessed\n* whether structures built in and rising above water should have their below-water height included in any assessment.\n* whether a structure, building or tower that is guyed is assessed in the same category as self-supporting structures.\n\nWithin an accepted definition of a building further controversy has included the following factors:\n* whether only habitable height of the building is considered\n* whether communication towers with [[Observation gallery|observation galleries]] should be considered \"habitable\" in this sense\n* whether rooftop [[antenna (electronics)|antennas]], viewing platforms or any other architecture that does not form a habitable floor should be included in the assessment\n* whether a floor built at a high level of a telecommunications or viewing tower should change the tower's definition to that of a \"building\"\n\n==Tallest structures==\n{{Main|List of tallest structures in the world}}\n[[Image:Maszt radiowy w Konstantynowie.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Warsaw radio mast]], the height record holder from 1974 to 1991]]\n[[File:Toronto's CN Tower.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[CN Tower]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], was the world's tallest freestanding structure from 1975 to 2007.]]\nThis category does not require the structure to be \"officially\" open but does require it to be \"topped out.\"\n\nThe tallest artificial structure is [[Burj Khalifa]], a skyscraper in Dubai that reached {{convert|829.8|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in height on January 17, 2009.<ref name=Biz24720090117>{{cite web|url=http://www.business24-7.ae/articles/2009/1/pages/01182009_63dc3a90c9a848219058be301f3f7ded.aspx |title=Burj Dubai all set for 09/09/09 soft opening |publisher=Emirates Business24/7 |accessdate=January 17, 2009}}</ref> By April 8, 2008 it had been built higher than the [[KVLY-TV mast]] in North Dakota, USA.<ref name=\"emaar-kvly-surpassed\">{{cite press release|url=http://www.emaar.ae/MediaCenter/PressReleases/2008April07.asp|title=Burj Dubai surpasses KVLY-TV mast to become the world\u2019s tallest man-made structure|publisher=Emaar|accessdate=May 28, 2008}}</ref> That September it officially surpassed [[Poland]]'s {{convert|646.38|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Warsaw radio mast]], which stood from 1974 to 1991, to become the tallest structure ever built. Guyed lattice towers such as these masts had held the world height record since 1954.\n\nThe [[Petronius Platform]] stands {{convert|610|m|ft|abbr=on}} off the sea floor leading some, including ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' 2007, to claim it as the tallest freestanding structure in the world. However, it is debated whether underwater height should be counted, in the same manner as height below ground is ignored on buildings. The [[Troll A platform]] is {{convert|472|m|ft|abbr=on}}, without any part of that height being supported by wires. The [[tension-leg platform|tension-leg]] type of oil platform has even greater below-water heights with several examples more than {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep. However, these platforms are not considered constant structures as the vast majority of their height is made up of the length of the tendons attaching the floating platforms to the sea floor. Despite this, ''Guinness World Records'' 2009 listed the [[Ursa tension leg platform]] as the tallest structure in the world with a total height of {{convert|1306|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The [[Magnolia Tension-leg Platform]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] is even taller with a total height of {{convert|1432|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[Taipei 101]] in Taipei, Taiwan, set records in three of the four skyscraper categories at the time it opened in 2004; at the time the Burj Khalifa opened in 2010 it remained the world's tallest inhabited building {{convert|509.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} as measured to its architectural height (spire). The height of its roof {{convert|449.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} and highest occupied floor {{convert|439.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} had been surpassed by the [[Shanghai World Financial Center]] with corresponding heights of {{convert|487|and|474|m|ft|abbr=on}}. [[Willis Tower]] (formerly Sears Tower) was the highest in the final category: the greatest height to top of antenna of any building in the world at {{convert|527|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\nBurj Khalifa broke the height record in all four categories for completed buildings.\n\n===Tallest structure by category===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2007}}\n\nDue to the disagreements over how to measure height and classify structures, engineers have created various definitions for categories of buildings and other structures. One measure includes the absolute height of a building, another includes only [[spire]]s and other permanent architectural features, but not [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]]. The tradition of including the spire on top of a building and not including the antenna dates back to the rivalry between the [[Chrysler Building]] and [[40 Wall Street]]. A modern-day example is that the antenna on top of [[Willis Tower]] (formerly Sears Tower) is not considered part of its architectural height, while the spires on top of the [[Petronas Twin Towers]] are counted.\n\n''Note:'' The following table is a list of the tallest completed structure in each of the structural categories below.

It was generally understood to be the height of the building to the top of its architectural elements including spires, but not including \"temporary\" structures (such as antennas or flagpoles), which could be added or changed relatively easily without requiring major changes to the building's design. Other criteria for height measurement generally were not considered, which occasionally caused some controversy.\n\nOne historic case involved the building now famous for the [[Times Square Ball]]. Known as [[One Times Square]] (at 1475 [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]]), it was the headquarters for '' [[The New York Times]], '' which gave [[Times Square]] its name. Completed in 1905, it reached a height of {{convert|364|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} to its roof, or {{convert|420|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} including its rooftop flagpole, which the  '' Times '' hoped would give it a record high status. But because a flagpole is not an integral architectural part of a building, One Times Square was not generally considered to be taller than the {{convert|390|ft|m|adj=mid|-high|sp=us}} [[Park Row Building]] in [[Lower Manhattan]], which was therefore still [[List of tallest buildings in New York City#Timeline of Tallest Buildings|New York's tallest]].<ref name=\"ctbuh.org\">{{cite web|url=http://ctbuh.org/AboutCTBUH/History/MeasuringTall/tabid/1320/language/en-US/Default.aspx|title=History of Measuring Tall Buildings|publisher=|accessdate=May 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410072709/http://www.ctbuh.org/AboutCTBUH/History/MeasuringTall/tabid/1320/language/en-US/Default.aspx|archive-date=April 10, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nA bigger controversy was the rivalry between two [[New York City|New York]] [[skyscrapers]] built in the [[Roaring Twenties]] \u2014 the [[Chrysler Building]] and the [[Bank of Manhattan Trust Building]], now called the [[Trump Building]] but better known as [[40 Wall Street]] (thus avoiding confusion with the many other [[List of things named after Donald Trump|Trump-named buildings]]). The latter was {{convert|927|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} tall, had a shorter pinnacle, and had a much higher top occupied floor (the second category in the 1996 criteria for tallest building). In contrast, the Chrysler Building employed a very long {{convert|125|ft|m|adj=on}} spire secretly assembled inside the building to claim the title of world's tallest building with a total height of {{convert|1048|ft|m}}, despite having a lower top occupied floor and a shorter height when both buildings' spires are not counted in their heights. Although the [[architect of record|architects of record]] for 40 Wall were [[H. Craig Severance]] and [[Yasuo Matsui]], the firm of [[Shreve & Lamb]] (who also designed the [[Empire State Building]]) served as consulting architects. They wrote a newspaper article claiming that 40 Wall was actually the tallest, since it contained the world's highest usable floor. They pointed out that the observation deck of 40 Wall was nearly {{convert|100|ft|m}} higher than the top floor of the Chrysler, whose surpassing spire was strictly ornamental and essentially inaccessible.<ref>Binders, George (August 2006). 101 of the World's Tallest Buildings. p. 102.</ref> Despite the protest, the Chrysler Building was generally accepted as the tallest building in the world for almost a year, until it was surpassed by the [[Empire State Building]]\u2019s {{convert|1250|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} in 1931.\n\nThat was in turn surpassed by the {{convert|1368|ft|m|adj=mid|-high|sp=us}} twin towers of New York\u2019s original [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] in 1972, which were in turn surpassed by the [[Sears Tower]] in [[Chicago]] in 1974. Now called the [[Willis Tower]] (since 2009) it was {{convert|1451|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} to its flat rooftop, or {{convert|1518|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} including its original antennas.<ref name=\"skyscraperpage.com\">{{cite web|url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=5/|title=Willis Tower, Chicago - SkyscraperPage.com |website=SkyscraperPage.com |publisher=|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}</ref> But in 1978 One World Trade Center (commonly known as the north tower) attained a taller absolute height when it added its {{convert|360|ft|m|adj=on}} new broadcasting antenna, for a total height of {{convert|1728|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}. The WTC north tower maintained this height record (including its antenna) from 1978 until 2000, when the owners of the Willis Tower extended its broadcasting antennae for a total height of {{convert|1729|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}.<ref name=\"skyscraperpage.com\"/> Thus the status of the Willis Tower as the \u201ctotally\u201d tallest was restored in the face of a new threat looming in the [[Far East]] \u2014 the \u201c[[Petronas Towers|Siamese Twins]].\u201d\n\n[[File:Petronas Twin Towers 2010 April.jpg|thumb|right|The Petronas Towers remain the tallest twin towers in the world.]]\n\nA major controversy erupted upon completion of the [[Petronas Towers]] in [[Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia]] in 1998. These twin towers, at {{convert|1483|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}, had a higher architectural height (spires, not antennas), but a lower absolute pinnacle height and a lower top occupied floor than the [[Willis Tower]] in [[Chicago]]. Counting buildings as structures with floors throughout, and with antenna masts excluded, the Willis was still considered the tallest at that time. Excluding their spires, which are {{convert|9|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} higher than the flat roof of Willis, the Petronas Towers are not taller than Willis. At their convention in Chicago, the [[Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat]] (CTBUH) found the Willis Tower (without its antennas) to be the third-tallest building, and the Petronas Towers (with their spires) to be the world's two tallest buildings.<ref name=\"ctbuh.org\"/>\n\nResponding to the ensuing controversy, the CTBUH then revised their criteria and defined four categories in which the world's tallest building can be measured,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctbuh.org/HighRiseInfo/TallestDatabase/Criteria/tabid/446/Default.aspx|title=CTBUH Criteria for Defining and Measuring Tall Buildings|publisher=|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}</ref> retaining the old criterion of height to architectural top, and adding three new categories:<ref name=\"ctbuh.org\"/>\n\n# Height to Architectural Top (including [[spire]]s and pinnacles, but not antennas, masts or flagpoles).

At the time, the Willis Tower held first place in the second and third categories, the Petronas Towers held the first category, and the original WTC north tower held the fourth (height to tip) category with its antenna.<ref name=\"ctbuh.org\"/> In 2000, however, a new antenna mast was placed on the Willis Tower, giving it the record in the fourth category. On April 20, 2004, the 101-storey [[Taipei 101]] in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]], was completed, taking the world record for the first three categories. On July 21, 2007, it was announced that [[Burj Khalifa]] in [[Dubai, UAE]], had surpassed Taipei 101. Since its completion in early 2010, Burj Khalifa leads in all categories (the first building to do so) with its spire height of {{convert|2722|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}.\n\nBefore Burj Khalifa was completed, Willis Tower led in the height-to-tip category with {{convert|1729|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} after its antenna was extended in 2000, making Willis Tower slightly taller height-to-tip than the WTC north tower's antenna that measured {{convert|1728|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}.  After the [[September 11, 2001, attacks]], the WTC became the world's tallest two buildings to be destroyed or demolished. They took that distinction from the [[Singer Building]], which stood {{convert|612|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} tall until the late 1960s where [[One Liberty Plaza]] now stands right across [[Church Street (Manhattan)|Church Street]] from the WTC site.\n\nA different superlative for skyscrapers is their [[List of buildings with 100 floors or more|number of floors]]. The original World Trade Center set that record at 110 in the early 1970s, and this was not surpassed until the Burj Khalifa opened in 2010.\n\nStructures such as the CN Tower, the [[Ostankino Tower]] and the [[Oriental Pearl Tower]] are excluded from these categories because they are not \"habitable buildings\", which are defined as frame structures made with floors and walls throughout.<ref name=\"ctbuh criteria\"/>\n\n===History of record holders in each [[Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat|CTBUH]] category===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''Date (event)'''||| '''Architectural top''' || '''Highest occupied floor''' || '''Roof''' || '''Tip'''\n|-\n|2010: [[Burj Khalifa]] completed || Burj Khalifa || Burj Khalifa || || Burj Khalifa\n|-\n|2009: [[CTBUH]] omits ''Height to Roof'' category || Taipei 101 || Shanghai World Financial Center || || Willis Tower\n|-\n|2008: [[Shanghai World Financial Center]] completed || Taipei 101 || Shanghai World Financial Center || Shanghai World Financial Center || Willis Tower\n|-\n|2003: [[Taipei 101]] completed || Taipei 101 || Taipei 101 || Taipei 101 || Willis Tower\n|-\n|2000: [[Willis Tower]] antenna extension || Petronas Towers || Willis Tower || Willis Tower || Willis Tower\n|-\n|1998: [[Petronas Towers]] completed|| Petronas Towers || Willis Tower || Willis Tower || World Trade Center\n|-\n|1996: CTBUH defines categories|| Willis Tower || Willis Tower || Willis Tower || World Trade Center\n|}\n\n==Tallest freestanding structures on land==\n{{Main|List of tallest freestanding structures}}\n[https://www.placeforvisit.com/2020/03/tallest-building-in-the-world.html Full list of tallest buildings in the world]\nFreestanding structures must not be supported by guy wires, the sea or other types of support.

Likewise, this definition does not count structures that are built underground or on the [[seabed]], such as the [[Petronius Platform]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Visit [[List of tallest buildings and structures in the world#Tallest structure by category|world's tallest structure by category]] for a list of various other definitions.\n\nThe tallest freestanding structure on land is the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The building surpassed the height of the previous record holder, the {{convert|553.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} CN Tower in Toronto, Ontario, on September 12, 2007.

This means truly free standing on its own or, in similar sense, non-supported structures.\n*The '''building''' list uses architectural height (excluding antennas) and includes only buildings, defined as consisting of habitable floors.

All [[Skyscraper#Skyscraper and supertall|supertall]] buildings (450 m and higher) are listed.\n\nNotes:\n*Eight buildings appear on the ''freestanding structures'' category list with heights different from another category.

It will be replaced on the calendar in 2020 by the [[ATP Cup]], a new ATP event, but the [[International Tennis Federation]] has said it will return in 2021 and is currently searching for a new venue.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.itftennis.com/news/303139.aspx | title=ITF confident about future of Hopman Cup | accessdate=9 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://sports.yahoo.com/hopman-cup-return-2021-says-155952773.html | title=Hopman Cup set to return in 2021 | accessdate=9 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe championship is named in honour of [[Harry Hopman]] (1906\u20131985), an Australian tennis player and coach who guided the country to 15 [[Davis Cup]] titles between 1938 and 1969. Since the Hopman Cup was founded in 1989, it has been attended each year by Hopman's widow, his second wife Lucy, who has travelled to the tournament from her home in the United States.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090324143142/http://hopmancup.com/?id=801 The Harry Hopman Legacy], Hyundai Hopman Cup website (archived), 24 March 2009.</ref>\n\nThe tournament is a sanctioned official event in the calendar of the [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF) but, while individual player results are tallied, they are not regarded as official ATP matches or included in the calculation of [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] or [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] rankings. The competition receives extensive television coverage in Australia and is an important lead-up tournament to the Australian Open each January as part of the [[Australian Open Series]].\n\nThe winning team receives a silver cup perpetual trophy and through 2013 the winning team members were presented with distinctive individual trophies in the shape of a tennis ball designed and created by Brinkhaus Jewellers encrusted with diamonds from the [[Argyle diamond mine]] in the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley region]] of [[Western Australia]]. In 2014 and 2015, the individual trophies were created in the shape of an intricate diamond encrusted tennis racket and ball, using just under an ounce of 18-carat white, yellow and rose gold and approximately half an ounce of pink argyle diamonds. These trophies are valued at $26,000.\n\nUntil 2012, the Hopman Cup was played at the [[Burswood Dome]]. From 2013 to 2019, it was played at the [[Perth Arena]].<ref>{{cite web|author1=Joseph Sapienza|title=Perth Arena to ensure Hopman Cup stays in WA|url=http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/perth-arena-to-ensure-hopman-cup-stays-in-wa-20100420-srev.html|publisher=WA Today|date=20 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\nUnlike other major international team tennis tournaments such as the [[Davis Cup]] and the [[Fed Cup]], which are for men or women only, the Hopman Cup is a mixed competition in which male and female players are on combined teams and represent their countries. Players are invited to attend and national coaches are not involved in selecting teams.\n\nEight nations are selected annually to compete in the Hopman Cup. The \"last\" team may be decided by play-offs between several nations before competition begins. For the [[2007 Hopman Cup]] however, this did not occur, due to the Asian Qualifying Tournament creating the eighth team. The official tournament website also has no qualifier listed in its schedule.\n\nEach team consists of one male player and one female player. Each match-up between two teams at the championships consists of:\n\n* one women's singles match\n* one men's singles match\n* one mixed doubles match\n\nThe eight competing teams are separated into two groups of four (with two teams being seeded) and face-off against each of the other three teams in their group in a round-robin format. These seedings ensure that each group has approximately similar strength. The top team in each group then meet in a final to decide the champions.\n\nIf a player is injured then a player of a lower ranking of that nation may be the substitute.\n\n==Management==\nSince 2014 the Hopman Cup tournament director has beens [[Paul Kilderry]] after the resignation of Steve Ayles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kilderry new Hopman Cup tournament director|url=http://www.tennis.com.au/news/2013/10/17/kilderry-new-hopman-cup-tournament-director|publisher=[[Tennis Australia]]|date=17 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=Courtney Walsh|title=Sam Stosur's manager rises in Hopman Cup shake-up|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/tennis/sam-stosurs-manager-rises-in-hopman-cup-shake-up/news-story/f47872ec0271d9e81640cb0fdde280c2|work=[[The Australian]]|date=17 October 2013}}</ref> Previously, the former Australian tennis player [[Paul McNamee]], who played a key role in the founding of the championships, was the tournament director.\n\n==History==\nUp to and including 2012, the venue was the [[Crown Perth#Burswood Dome (demolished)|Burswood Dome]] at the [[Crown Perth|Burswood Entertainment Complex]].\n\nThe 2005/06 Hopman Cup was the first elite-level tennis tournament in which the system was introduced allowing players to challenge point-ending line calls similar to that in clay court tournaments. The challenged calls are immediately reviewed on a large monitor using [[Hawk-Eye]] technology.\n\nThe 20th Hopman Cup, in 2008, was intended to be the last held at the Burswood Dome, however this was extended until 2012 when the new [[Perth Arena]] was due for completion.\n\nIn 2019 for the 31st edition of the tournament, a record crowd of 14,064 witnessed the [[2019 Hopman Cup]] match between [[United States at the Hopman Cup|United States]] and [[Switzerland at the Hopman Cup|Switzerland]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/tennis/after-two-decades-in-the-spotlight-roger-and-serena-meet-on-court-20190102-p50p5z.html|title=After two decades in the spotlight, Roger and Serena meet on court|newspaper=smh.com.au|author=Ben Rothenberg|date=2019-01-02|accessdate=2019-01-03}}</ref> This was also the highest attendance for a tennis match in Western Australian history.\n\nRoger Federer is the most successful individual player in Hopman Cup history with 3 titles.

From 2011, a five-year deal to broadcast the competition was signed by [[Network Ten]], a deal which ended abruptly in November 2013.

It will be replaced on the calendar in 2020 by the [[ATP Cup]], a new ATP event, but the [[International Tennis Federation]] has said it will return in 2021 and is currently searching for a new venue.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.itftennis.com/news/303139.aspx | title=ITF confident about future of Hopman Cup | accessdate=9 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://sports.yahoo.com/hopman-cup-return-2021-says-155952773.html | title=Hopman Cup set to return in 2021 | accessdate=9 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe championship is named in honour of [[Harry Hopman]] (1906\u20131985), an Australian tennis player and coach who guided the country to 15 [[Davis Cup]] titles between 1938 and 1969. Since the Hopman Cup was founded in 1989, it has been attended each year by Hopman's widow, his second wife Lucy, who has travelled to the tournament from her home in the United States.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090324143142/http://hopmancup.com/?id=801 The Harry Hopman Legacy], Hyundai Hopman Cup website (archived), 24 March 2009.</ref>\n\nThe tournament is a sanctioned official event in the calendar of the [[International Tennis Federation]] (ITF) but, while individual player results are tallied, they are not regarded as official ATP matches or included in the calculation of [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] or [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] rankings. The competition receives extensive television coverage in Australia and is an important lead-up tournament to the Australian Open each January as part of the [[Australian Open Series]].\n\nThe winning team receives a silver cup perpetual trophy and through 2013 the winning team members were presented with distinctive individual trophies in the shape of a tennis ball designed and created by Brinkhaus Jewellers encrusted with diamonds from the [[Argyle diamond mine]] in the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley region]] of [[Western Australia]]. In 2014 and 2015, the individual trophies were created in the shape of an intricate diamond encrusted tennis racket and ball, using just under an ounce of 18-carat white, yellow and rose gold and approximately half an ounce of pink argyle diamonds. These trophies are valued at $26,000.\n\nUntil 2012, the Hopman Cup was played at the [[Burswood Dome]]. From 2013 to 2019, it was played at the [[Perth Arena]].<ref>{{cite web|author1=Joseph Sapienza|title=Perth Arena to ensure Hopman Cup stays in WA|url=http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/perth-arena-to-ensure-hopman-cup-stays-in-wa-20100420-srev.html|publisher=WA Today|date=20 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\nUnlike other major international team tennis tournaments such as the [[Davis Cup]] and the [[Fed Cup]], which are for men or women only, the Hopman Cup is a mixed competition in which male and female players are on combined teams and represent their countries. Players are invited to attend and national coaches are not involved in selecting teams.\n\nEight nations are selected annually to compete in the Hopman Cup. The \"last\" team may be decided by play-offs between several nations before competition begins. For the [[2007 Hopman Cup]] however, this did not occur, due to the Asian Qualifying Tournament creating the eighth team. The official tournament website also has no qualifier listed in its schedule.\n\nEach team consists of one male player and one female player. Each match-up between two teams at the championships consists of:\n\n* one women's singles match\n* one men's singles match\n* one mixed doubles match\n\nThe eight competing teams are separated into two groups of four (with two teams being seeded) and face-off against each of the other three teams in their group in a round-robin format. These seedings ensure that each group has approximately similar strength. The top team in each group then meet in a final to decide the champions.\n\nIf a player is injured then a player of a lower ranking of that nation may be the substitute.\n\n==Management==\nSince 2014 the Hopman Cup tournament director has beens [[Paul Kilderry]] after the resignation of Steve Ayles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kilderry new Hopman Cup tournament director|url=http://www.tennis.com.au/news/2013/10/17/kilderry-new-hopman-cup-tournament-director|publisher=[[Tennis Australia]]|date=17 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=Courtney Walsh|title=Sam Stosur's manager rises in Hopman Cup shake-up|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/tennis/sam-stosurs-manager-rises-in-hopman-cup-shake-up/news-story/f47872ec0271d9e81640cb0fdde280c2|work=[[The Australian]]|date=17 October 2013}}</ref> Previously, the former Australian tennis player [[Paul McNamee]], who played a key role in the founding of the championships, was the tournament director.\n\n==History==\nUp to and including 2012, the venue was the [[Crown Perth#Burswood Dome (demolished)|Burswood Dome]] at the [[Crown Perth|Burswood Entertainment Complex]].\n\nThe 2005/06 Hopman Cup was the first elite-level tennis tournament in which the system was introduced allowing players to challenge point-ending line calls similar to that in clay court tournaments. The challenged calls are immediately reviewed on a large monitor using [[Hawk-Eye]] technology.\n\nThe 20th Hopman Cup, in 2008, was intended to be the last held at the Burswood Dome, however this was extended until 2012 when the new [[Perth Arena]] was due for completion.\n\nIn 2019 for the 31st edition of the tournament, a record crowd of 14,064 witnessed the [[2019 Hopman Cup]] match between [[United States at the Hopman Cup|United States]] and [[Switzerland at the Hopman Cup|Switzerland]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/tennis/after-two-decades-in-the-spotlight-roger-and-serena-meet-on-court-20190102-p50p5z.html|title=After two decades in the spotlight, Roger and Serena meet on court|newspaper=smh.com.au|author=Ben Rothenberg|date=2019-01-02|accessdate=2019-01-03}}</ref> This was also the highest attendance for a tennis match in Western Australian history.\n\nRoger Federer is the most successful individual player in Hopman Cup history with 3 titles.

From 2011, a five-year deal to broadcast the competition was signed by [[Network Ten]], a deal which ended abruptly in November 2013.

A [[Sweeper (association football)|sweeper]] who could play in [[midfielder|midfield]], Vasovi\u0107 was renowned for his defensive positioning, never-say-die attitude and tactical awareness.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Po\u017earevac]] on the eve of World War II to parents hailing from [[Montenegro]] \u2014 tax office clerk \u017divojin Vasovi\u0107 and homemaker Jelka Lau\u0161evi\u0107 \u2014 young Velibor was the couple's ninth child.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\">[http://yugopapir.blogspot.ca/2012/10/sportske-legende-velibor-vasovic-kako.html Velibor Vasovi\u0107 - Kako je milicija pendre\u010dila Milaneze!];''Duga'', 1986</ref> He had four older brothers and three older sisters while another one of his sisters died before he was born. With the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion]] and subsequent dismemberment of the Yugoslav kingdom in April 1941, Vasovi\u0107's father got taken prisoner by the Germans, spending four years in captivity, while his oldest siblings joined the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] resistance movement.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>\n\nThe youngster completed primary education in his hometown before moving to capital Belgrade along with his entire family courtesy of his maternal uncle David Lau\u0161evi\u0107 who in the meantime rose to high post with the [[State Security Administration]] (UDBA). Vasovi\u0107 began his secondary studies by enrolling at the [[First Belgrade Gymnasium]].<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>\n\n==Club career==\nSimultaneous with starting gymnasium studies, Vasovi\u0107 got introduced to the game of football at FK Novi Beograd, a small local lower-league outfit.\n\n===Partizan===\nIn 1955, youngster's footballing talents got spotted by [[FK Partizan]] youth coach [[Florijan Matekalo]], initiating fifteen-year-old Vasovi\u0107's transfer across town to the big club's youth system where he came in alongside additional talented teenagers such as right back [[Fahrudin Jusufi]] and central midfielder [[Vladica Kova\u010devi\u0107]], brought in from [[Prilep]] and [[Ivanjica]], respectively. Others already on the youth team were twin brothers [[Sr\u0111an \u010cebinac|Sr\u0111an]] and [[Zvezdan \u010cebinac]] as well as Branko Pejovi\u0107. The entire talented generation soon came to be known as \"Matekalo's Babies\".\n\nIn June 1958, eighteen-year-old Vasovi\u0107 got moved up to the full squad. He spent five seasons at [[FK Partizan]] in this stint (June 1958 \u2013 June 1963) before controversially transferring to [[Ve\u010diti derbi|archrivals]] [[Red Star Belgrade]] during summer 1963.\n\n===Six months at Red Star Belgrade===\nIn the summer of 1963, twenty-three-year-old Vasovi\u0107 was coming off another stellar season for Partizan in which he greatly contributed to the ''crno-beli'' winning their [[1962\u201363 Yugoslav First League|third consecutive league title]]. However, his contract with Partizan was set to expire. In a 1986 interview for ''[[Duga (magazine)|Duga]]'' magazine, Vasovi\u0107 recalled how his transfer to Red Star came about: {{cquote|''Both my and Jusufi's contracts were expiring in the summer of 1963. And in addition to being key members of the Partizan team, both of us were also prominent national team players. My uncle David Lau\u0161evi\u0107 was a Partizan board member so the geniuses at the club figured 'We better throw a lot of money at Jusufi to prevent him from leaving while Vasovi\u0107's gonna stay anyway because his uncle will take care of it'. Of course, I would have none of it so I immediately went across town to Red Star's technical director [[Aca Obradovi\u0107]] and I literally told him 'Mr. Obradovi\u0107, if Red Star has enough money I'd like to join your club'. So they dug into their [[emergency fund]] and paid me. Once the Partizan people found out, they were flabbergasted. Club president, [[Yugoslav People's Army|JNA]] general {{ill|Ilija Radakovi\u0107|sr}}, immediately approved payment of the double amount Red Star gave me. My phone was ringing off the hook, they were sending letters, they organized fan protests. I was also getting [[death threat]]s. To this day I keep a letter in which one JNA officer threatens to kill me during a match with a [[sniper rifle]]. It's like a proper letter, he even included his full name, home address, and phone number''.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>}}\n\nVasovi\u0107 reportedly received [[Yugoslav dinar|YUD]]5 million (enough to buy two [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] vehicles at the time) from Red Star.<ref>[http://www.reprezentacija.rs/vasovic-velibor/ Biography in Serbian];reprezentacija.rs</ref>\n\nAt the start of the new [[1963\u201364 Yugoslav First League|league season]], Vasovi\u0107 got a spot in Red Star's central defense alongside [[Milan \u010cop]] and [[Vojislav Meli\u0107|Vojkan Meli\u0107]]. His first competitive match for Red Star on 1 September 1963 was also the grand opening of the club's still not fully finished grandiose new stadium [[Marakana]] as ''crveno-beli'' came from behind to beat [[NK Rijeka]] 2\u20131. The team easily led the [[1963\u201364 Yugoslav First League|league]] by five points at the winter break while defending league champion Partizan lagged far behind.\n\nOver the winter break, another transfer saga involving Vasovi\u0107 ensued as Partizan club president Radakovi\u0107 was successful in persuading the player to come back for even more money than Red Star gave him. Vasovi\u0107 agreed, but he was under contract with Red Star and the club didn't want to sign off on the move despite being offered some money as a transfer fee. Vasovi\u0107 even resorted to unilaterally training with his old club.\n\nWith the league season restarting following the winter break, Vasovi\u0107 was in legal limbo, out of the Red Star lineup, though still having his salary paid by the club. After several months of sitting out, Vasovi\u0107 got instructed by the Partizan vice-president \u010ceda D\u017eomba to try to get a meeting with the highest political authority in [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|SR Serbia]] at the time, federal interior secretary [[Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107]], in order to finally resolve the situation.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/> Vasovi\u0107 made the approach through private channels as his friend and teammate [[Zvezdan \u010cebinac]] was an old schoolmate of Rankovi\u0107's son so Vasovi\u0107 managed to get a 45-minute meeting with Rankovi\u0107 at the recently built [[SIV 1|SIV building]] in [[New Belgrade]] where nothing concrete was promised other than Rankovi\u0107 saying he'll look into it.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/> Several months later Red Star's technical director Obradovi\u0107 agreed to let Vasovi\u0107 return to Partizan while in return, as consolation of sorts for Red Star, Partizan's club president Radakovi\u0107 agreed to allow Zvezdan \u010cebinac's transfer to Red Star.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>\n\n===Return to Partizan===\nVasovi\u0107 thus managed to get both his money and his wishes of return, but many within Partizan did not welcome him back with open arms. Some of the players saw his stunt as blackmail and were further unhappy that the club bent over backwards to accommodate any single player like that. Furthermore, his return took place against the backdrop of internal squabbles within the club's managing board, specifically between president Radakovi\u0107 and general-secretary Mirko Nenezi\u0107 who acted as proxy for his brother, powerful JNA general {{ill|Radojica Nenezi\u0107|sr}}. The row started over the internal decision to relieve general-secretary Nenezi\u0107 of his duties as a person in charge of finances, a move pushed through by president Radakovi\u0107.\n\nAs the [[1964\u201365 Yugoslav First League|1964\u201365 season]] began under new head coach [[Aleksandar Atanackovi\u0107 (footballer, born 1920)|Aleksandar Atanackovi\u0107]], Partizan led the league, but with each coming week the row in the managing board increasingly affected player relations. By December 1964, ahead of the last league fixture before the winter break, two opposing camps clearly emerged within the team \u2014 one group supporting dissenting general-secretary Nenezi\u0107 was led by Jusufi and also included [[Milan Gali\u0107]], [[Radoslav Be\u010dejac]], [[Joakim Vislavski]], and head coach Atanackovi\u0107 while the other group supporting president Radakovi\u0107 was led by Vasovi\u0107 with [[Vladica Kova\u010devi\u0107]], Zoran Miladinovi\u0107, and several youth players. Remaining players [[Milutin \u0160o\u0161ki\u0107]], [[Ivan \u0106urkovi\u0107]], [[Josip Pirmajer]], and [[Branko Ra\u0161ovi\u0107]] stayed neutral. The dissenting group even resorted to initiating a mutiny, refusing to travel to [[Skopje]] for the final match of the first half of the season versus [[FK Vardar]]. Seeing they were missing half of their team along with head coach Atanackovi\u0107, president Radakovi\u0107 handed the head coaching reins to [[Mile Kos]] for one match. In difficult circumstances, Kos managed to put together eleven players and Partizan managed to retain the top league spot as winter break commenced. The very next day after the Skopje debacle, head coach Atanackovi\u0107 was relieved of his duties as the two factions prepared for the final showdown at the club's general assembly scheduled for January 1965 at the [[University of Belgrade]]'s [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]]. The assembly saw the two groups of players make up. Still, the case even got to the highest echelons of power in Yugoslavia as general [[Ivan Go\u0161njak]], reporting directly to marshal [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]], became aware of his fellow JNA generals causing problems within the Partizan management. Once Tito caught whiff of this, he acted swiftly, ordering action against each officer from the club's management board involved in the row by having them reassigned to another location. General Radakovi\u0107 thus got moved to [[SR Slovenia]] while general Radojica Nenezi\u0107 got assigned to Skopje. Vladimir Duji\u0107, a civilian, became the new club president.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzPXzNvgSEQ Se\u0107anja: Propu\u0161tena \u0161ansa Partizana];SOS kanal, 4 September 2011</ref> The head coaching duties were handed to [[Marko Valok]].\n\nSeveral months later Partizan played a friendly versus [[A.C. Milan]] that went down in infamy for Vasovi\u0107 getting into a vicious fist fight with Milan's Peruvian defender [[V\u00edctor Ben\u00edtez]], all of which prompted a bench-clearing brawl. Though unpleasant, the ugly fracas actually served to further solidify the newly unified team spirit of the recently fractured Partizan squad.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>\n\n===Ajax===\nVasovi\u0107 transferred to [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] after he had lost 2\u20131 to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] with Partizan in the [[1966 European Cup Final]] (scoring the only goal for his team). He did the same (4\u20131 loss to [[A.C. Milan]], scoring from the spot) in the [[1969 European Cup Final]], before leading Ajax as captain to a 2\u20130 victory over [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] in the [[1971 European Cup Final]].\n\nHe played 5 seasons for the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] giants (1966\u20131971) and was the first foreign captain in the [[History of AFC Ajax|club's history]].\n\nHe played 32 games for the [[Yugoslavia national football team]]. During his career with Partizan he won 4 Yugoslav Championships ([[1960\u201361 Yugoslav First League|1960\u201361]], [[1961\u201362 Yugoslav First League|1961\u201362]], [[1962\u201363 Yugoslav First League|1962\u201363]], [[1964\u201365 Yugoslav First League|1964\u201365]]) and leading Partizan as captain to the [[1966 European Cup Final]].\n\nVasovi\u0107's career was relatively short. He only played 13 professional seasons due to the [[asthma]]tic condition he was suffering from.\n\n== National team ==\nIn the [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia national team]] Vasovi\u0107 appeared from 1961 until 1966 in 32 fixtures and scoring 2 goals. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+List of international goals scored by Velibor Vasovi\u0107 \n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | No. \n! scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"date\" | Date \n! scope=\"col\" | Venue \n! scope=\"col\" | Opponent \n! scope=\"col\" | Score \n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n! scope=\"col\" | Competition \n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|1\n|| 4 November 1962 || [[Belgrade]], Yugoslavia || {{fb|BEL}} || <center>3\u20132</center> || <center>3\u20132</center> || [[UEFA Euro 1964 qualifying]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2\n|| 7 November 1965 || [[Belgrade]], Yugoslavia || {{fb|NOR}} || <center>1\u20131</center> || <center>1\u20131</center> || [[1966 FIFA World Cup qualification]]\n|}\n\n==Coaching career==\nAfter ending his career as a player in 1971, he coached [[FK Partizan]] (second part of [[1971\u201372 Yugoslav First League|1971\u201372]] season, full [[1972\u201373 Yugoslav First League|1972\u201373]], and the first part of [[1973\u201374 Yugoslav First League|1973\u201374]]), [[FK Proleter Zrenjanin|Proleter Zrenjanin]], [[Angers SCO]] (1975\u20131976), [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] (first part of [[1976\u201377 French Division 1|1976\u201377]] and the first part of [[1978\u201379 French Division 1|1978\u201379]] seasons).<ref>{{cite web|publisher = RSSSF|title = France \u2013 Trainers of First and Second Division Clubs|url=http://www.rsssf.com/players/trainers-fran-clubs.html|accessdate=2008-08-24}}</ref> He also managed [[Egypt]]ian club [[Zamalek SC]] (1982\u20131983), [[Ethnikos Piraeus F.C.|Ethnikos Piraeus]] (1983), [[Red Star Belgrade]] (1986\u20131988), and [[AC Bellinzona]] (1989)<ref>{{cite web|publisher = RSSSF|title = Switzerland \u2013 Trainers of First and Second Division Clubs|url=http://www.rsssf.com/players/trainers-zwit-clubs.html|accessdate=2008-08-24}}</ref> before returning home to [[Belgrade]] and working as a [[lawyer]].

His criticism particularly intensified after the breakup of [[SFR Yugoslavia]]. In 1997 Vasovi\u0107 founded an organization called ''Udru\u017eenje za razvoj i prosperitet jugoslovenskog fudbala'' (Organization for the Development and Prosperity of Yugoslav Football) through which he channeled his criticism of the FSJ.\n\nThroughout the summer of 2000 he spoke at various town hall meetings throughout Serbia organized by the [[Yugoslav Left]] (JUL), a political party headed by the [[President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav president]] [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]'s wife [[Mira Markovi\u0107]].

\u0412\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b; 3 October 1939 \u2013 4 March 2002) was a [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[association football|footballer]] and [[Manager (association football)|manager]], also one of the legendary players of [[FK Partizan|Partizan Belgrade]] and one of greatest [[Defender (association football)|defenders]] of his generation. A [[Sweeper (association football)|sweeper]] who could play in [[midfielder|midfield]], Vasovi\u0107 was renowned for his defensive positioning, never-say-die attitude and tactical awareness.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Po\u017earevac]] on the eve of World War II to parents hailing from [[Montenegro]] \u2014 tax office clerk \u017divojin Vasovi\u0107 and homemaker Jelka Lau\u0161evi\u0107 \u2014 young Velibor was the couple's ninth child.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\">[http://yugopapir.blogspot.ca/2012/10/sportske-legende-velibor-vasovic-kako.html Velibor Vasovi\u0107 - Kako je milicija pendre\u010dila Milaneze!];''Duga'', 1986</ref> He had four older brothers and three older sisters while another one of his sisters died before he was born. With the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion]] and subsequent dismemberment of the Yugoslav kingdom in April 1941, Vasovi\u0107's father got taken prisoner by the Germans, spending four years in captivity, while his oldest siblings joined the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] resistance movement.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>\n\nThe youngster completed primary education in his hometown before moving to capital Belgrade along with his entire family courtesy of his maternal uncle David Lau\u0161evi\u0107 who in the meantime rose to high post with the [[State Security Administration]] (UDBA). Vasovi\u0107 began his secondary studies by enrolling at the [[First Belgrade Gymnasium]].<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>\n\n==Club career==\nSimultaneous with starting gymnasium studies, Vasovi\u0107 got introduced to the game of football at FK Novi Beograd, a small local lower-league outfit.\n\n===Partizan===\nIn 1955, youngster's footballing talents got spotted by [[FK Partizan]] youth coach [[Florijan Matekalo]], initiating fifteen-year-old Vasovi\u0107's transfer across town to the big club's youth system where he came in alongside additional talented teenagers such as right back [[Fahrudin Jusufi]] and central midfielder [[Vladica Kova\u010devi\u0107]], brought in from [[Prilep]] and [[Ivanjica]], respectively. Others already on the youth team were twin brothers [[Sr\u0111an \u010cebinac|Sr\u0111an]] and [[Zvezdan \u010cebinac]] as well as Branko Pejovi\u0107. The entire talented generation soon came to be known as \"Matekalo's Babies\".\n\nIn June 1958, eighteen-year-old Vasovi\u0107 got moved up to the full squad. He spent five seasons at [[FK Partizan]] in this stint (June 1958 \u2013 June 1963) before controversially transferring to [[Ve\u010diti derbi|archrivals]] [[Red Star Belgrade]] during summer 1963.\n\n===Six months at Red Star Belgrade===\nIn the summer of 1963, twenty-three-year-old Vasovi\u0107 was coming off another stellar season for Partizan in which he greatly contributed to the ''crno-beli'' winning their [[1962\u201363 Yugoslav First League|third consecutive league title]]. However, his contract with Partizan was set to expire. In a 1986 interview for ''[[Duga (magazine)|Duga]]'' magazine, Vasovi\u0107 recalled how his transfer to Red Star came about: {{cquote|''Both my and Jusufi's contracts were expiring in the summer of 1963. And in addition to being key members of the Partizan team, both of us were also prominent national team players. My uncle David Lau\u0161evi\u0107 was a Partizan board member so the geniuses at the club figured 'We better throw a lot of money at Jusufi to prevent him from leaving while Vasovi\u0107's gonna stay anyway because his uncle will take care of it'. Of course, I would have none of it so I immediately went across town to Red Star's technical director [[Aca Obradovi\u0107]] and I literally told him 'Mr. Obradovi\u0107, if Red Star has enough money I'd like to join your club'. So they dug into their [[emergency fund]] and paid me. Once the Partizan people found out, they were flabbergasted. Club president, [[Yugoslav People's Army|JNA]] general {{ill|Ilija Radakovi\u0107|sr}}, immediately approved payment of the double amount Red Star gave me. My phone was ringing off the hook, they were sending letters, they organized fan protests. I was also getting [[death threat]]s. To this day I keep a letter in which one JNA officer threatens to kill me during a match with a [[sniper rifle]]. It's like a proper letter, he even included his full name, home address, and phone number''.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>}}\n\nVasovi\u0107 reportedly received [[Yugoslav dinar|YUD]]5 million (enough to buy two [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] vehicles at the time) from Red Star.<ref>[http://www.reprezentacija.rs/vasovic-velibor/ Biography in Serbian];reprezentacija.rs</ref>\n\nAt the start of the new [[1963\u201364 Yugoslav First League|league season]], Vasovi\u0107 got a spot in Red Star's central defense alongside [[Milan \u010cop]] and [[Vojislav Meli\u0107|Vojkan Meli\u0107]]. His first competitive match for Red Star on 1 September 1963 was also the grand opening of the club's still not fully finished grandiose new stadium [[Marakana]] as ''crveno-beli'' came from behind to beat [[NK Rijeka]] 2\u20131. The team easily led the [[1963\u201364 Yugoslav First League|league]] by five points at the winter break while defending league champion Partizan lagged far behind.\n\nOver the winter break, another transfer saga involving Vasovi\u0107 ensued as Partizan club president Radakovi\u0107 was successful in persuading the player to come back for even more money than Red Star gave him. Vasovi\u0107 agreed, but he was under contract with Red Star and the club didn't want to sign off on the move despite being offered some money as a transfer fee. Vasovi\u0107 even resorted to unilaterally training with his old club.\n\nWith the league season restarting following the winter break, Vasovi\u0107 was in legal limbo, out of the Red Star lineup, though still having his salary paid by the club. After several months of sitting out, Vasovi\u0107 got instructed by the Partizan vice-president \u010ceda D\u017eomba to try to get a meeting with the highest political authority in [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|SR Serbia]] at the time, federal interior secretary [[Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107]], in order to finally resolve the situation.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/> Vasovi\u0107 made the approach through private channels as his friend and teammate [[Zvezdan \u010cebinac]] was an old schoolmate of Rankovi\u0107's son so Vasovi\u0107 managed to get a 45-minute meeting with Rankovi\u0107 at the recently built [[SIV 1|SIV building]] in [[New Belgrade]] where nothing concrete was promised other than Rankovi\u0107 saying he'll look into it.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/> Several months later Red Star's technical director Obradovi\u0107 agreed to let Vasovi\u0107 return to Partizan while in return, as consolation of sorts for Red Star, Partizan's club president Radakovi\u0107 agreed to allow Zvezdan \u010cebinac's transfer to Red Star.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>\n\n===Return to Partizan===\nVasovi\u0107 thus managed to get both his money and his wishes of return, but many within Partizan did not welcome him back with open arms. Some of the players saw his stunt as blackmail and were further unhappy that the club bent over backwards to accommodate any single player like that. Furthermore, his return took place against the backdrop of internal squabbles within the club's managing board, specifically between president Radakovi\u0107 and general-secretary Mirko Nenezi\u0107 who acted as proxy for his brother, powerful JNA general {{ill|Radojica Nenezi\u0107|sr}}. The row started over the internal decision to relieve general-secretary Nenezi\u0107 of his duties as a person in charge of finances, a move pushed through by president Radakovi\u0107.\n\nAs the [[1964\u201365 Yugoslav First League|1964\u201365 season]] began under new head coach [[Aleksandar Atanackovi\u0107 (footballer, born 1920)|Aleksandar Atanackovi\u0107]], Partizan led the league, but with each coming week the row in the managing board increasingly affected player relations. By December 1964, ahead of the last league fixture before the winter break, two opposing camps clearly emerged within the team \u2014 one group supporting dissenting general-secretary Nenezi\u0107 was led by Jusufi and also included [[Milan Gali\u0107]], [[Radoslav Be\u010dejac]], [[Joakim Vislavski]], and head coach Atanackovi\u0107 while the other group supporting president Radakovi\u0107 was led by Vasovi\u0107 with [[Vladica Kova\u010devi\u0107]], Zoran Miladinovi\u0107, and several youth players. Remaining players [[Milutin \u0160o\u0161ki\u0107]], [[Ivan \u0106urkovi\u0107]], [[Josip Pirmajer]], and [[Branko Ra\u0161ovi\u0107]] stayed neutral. The dissenting group even resorted to initiating a mutiny, refusing to travel to [[Skopje]] for the final match of the first half of the season versus [[FK Vardar]]. Seeing they were missing half of their team along with head coach Atanackovi\u0107, president Radakovi\u0107 handed the head coaching reins to [[Mile Kos]] for one match. In difficult circumstances, Kos managed to put together eleven players and Partizan managed to retain the top league spot as winter break commenced. The very next day after the Skopje debacle, head coach Atanackovi\u0107 was relieved of his duties as the two factions prepared for the final showdown at the club's general assembly scheduled for January 1965 at the [[University of Belgrade]]'s [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]]. The assembly saw the two groups of players make up. Still, the case even got to the highest echelons of power in Yugoslavia as general [[Ivan Go\u0161njak]], reporting directly to marshal [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]], became aware of his fellow JNA generals causing problems within the Partizan management. Once Tito caught whiff of this, he acted swiftly, ordering action against each officer from the club's management board involved in the row by having them reassigned to another location. General Radakovi\u0107 thus got moved to [[SR Slovenia]] while general Radojica Nenezi\u0107 got assigned to Skopje. Vladimir Duji\u0107, a civilian, became the new club president.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzPXzNvgSEQ Se\u0107anja: Propu\u0161tena \u0161ansa Partizana];SOS kanal, 4 September 2011</ref> The head coaching duties were handed to [[Marko Valok]].\n\nSeveral months later Partizan played a friendly versus [[A.C. Milan]] that went down in infamy for Vasovi\u0107 getting into a vicious fist fight with Milan's Peruvian defender [[V\u00edctor Ben\u00edtez]], all of which prompted a bench-clearing brawl. Though unpleasant, the ugly fracas actually served to further solidify the newly unified team spirit of the recently fractured Partizan squad.<ref name=\"vaske-duga\"/>\n\n===Ajax===\nVasovi\u0107 transferred to [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] after he had lost 2\u20131 to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] with Partizan in the [[1966 European Cup Final]] (scoring the only goal for his team). He did the same (4\u20131 loss to [[A.C. Milan]], scoring from the spot) in the [[1969 European Cup Final]], before leading Ajax as captain to a 2\u20130 victory over [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] in the [[1971 European Cup Final]].\n\nHe played 5 seasons for the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] giants (1966\u20131971) and was the first foreign captain in the [[History of AFC Ajax|club's history]].\n\nHe played 32 games for the [[Yugoslavia national football team]]. During his career with Partizan he won 4 Yugoslav Championships ([[1960\u201361 Yugoslav First League|1960\u201361]], [[1961\u201362 Yugoslav First League|1961\u201362]], [[1962\u201363 Yugoslav First League|1962\u201363]], [[1964\u201365 Yugoslav First League|1964\u201365]]) and leading Partizan as captain to the [[1966 European Cup Final]].\n\nVasovi\u0107's career was relatively short. He only played 13 professional seasons due to the [[asthma]]tic condition he was suffering from.\n\n== National team ==\nIn the [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia national team]] Vasovi\u0107 appeared from 1961 until 1966 in 32 fixtures and scoring 2 goals. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+List of international goals scored by Velibor Vasovi\u0107 \n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | No. \n! scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"date\" | Date \n! scope=\"col\" | Venue \n! scope=\"col\" | Opponent \n! scope=\"col\" | Score \n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n! scope=\"col\" | Competition \n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|1\n|| 4 November 1962 || [[Belgrade]], Yugoslavia || {{fb|BEL}} || <center>3\u20132</center> || <center>3\u20132</center> || [[UEFA Euro 1964 qualifying]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2\n|| 7 November 1965 || [[Belgrade]], Yugoslavia || {{fb|NOR}} || <center>1\u20131</center> || <center>1\u20131</center> || [[1966 FIFA World Cup qualification]]\n|}\n\n==Coaching career==\nAfter ending his career as a player in 1971, he coached [[FK Partizan]] (second part of [[1971\u201372 Yugoslav First League|1971\u201372]] season, full [[1972\u201373 Yugoslav First League|1972\u201373]], and the first part of [[1973\u201374 Yugoslav First League|1973\u201374]]), [[FK Proleter Zrenjanin|Proleter Zrenjanin]], [[Angers SCO]] (1975\u20131976), [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] (first part of [[1976\u201377 French Division 1|1976\u201377]] and the first part of [[1978\u201379 French Division 1|1978\u201379]] seasons).<ref>{{cite web|publisher = RSSSF|title = France \u2013 Trainers of First and Second Division Clubs|url=http://www.rsssf.com/players/trainers-fran-clubs.html|accessdate=2008-08-24}}</ref> He also managed [[Egypt]]ian club [[Zamalek SC]] (1982\u20131983), [[Ethnikos Piraeus F.C.|Ethnikos Piraeus]] (1983), [[Red Star Belgrade]] (1986\u20131988), and [[AC Bellinzona]] (1989)<ref>{{cite web|publisher = RSSSF|title = Switzerland \u2013 Trainers of First and Second Division Clubs|url=http://www.rsssf.com/players/trainers-zwit-clubs.html|accessdate=2008-08-24}}</ref> before returning home to [[Belgrade]] and working as a [[lawyer]].

His criticism particularly intensified after the breakup of [[SFR Yugoslavia]]. In 1997 Vasovi\u0107 founded an organization called ''Udru\u017eenje za razvoj i prosperitet jugoslovenskog fudbala'' (Organization for the Development and Prosperity of Yugoslav Football) through which he channeled his criticism of the FSJ.\n\nThroughout the summer of 2000 he spoke at various town hall meetings throughout Serbia organized by the [[Yugoslav Left]] (JUL), a political party headed by the [[President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav president]] [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]'s wife [[Mira Markovi\u0107]].

It is the most populated municipality and historic core city of the [[Kansas City metropolitan area]], which straddles the [[Kansas]]\u2013[[Missouri]] state line and has a CSA population of 2,487,053. Most of the city lies within [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]], but portions spill into [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay]], [[Cass County, Missouri|Cass]], and [[Platte County, Missouri|Platte]] counties. The city borders [[Kansas City, Kansas]] (KCK), and the [[Kansas]] counties of [[Johnson County, Kansas|Johnson County]] and [[Wyandotte County, Kansas|Wyandotte County]]. Kansas City was founded in the 1830s as a [[Missouri River]] port at its confluence with the [[Kansas River]] coming in from the west. On June 1, 1850, the town of Kansas was incorporated; shortly after came the establishment of the [[Kansas Territory]]. Confusion between the two ensued, and the name Kansas City was assigned to distinguish them soon after. \n\nSitting on Missouri's western boundary with [[Kansas]], with [[Downtown Kansas City|Downtown]] near the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers, the city encompasses about {{convert|319.03|sqmi|km2}}, making it the [[List of United States cities by area|23rd largest city by total area]] in the United States. Along with [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], one of its major suburbs, it serves as one of the two county seats of Jackson County. Other major suburbs include the Missouri cities of [[Blue Springs, Missouri|Blue Springs]] and [[Lee's Summit, Missouri|Lee's Summit]] and the Kansas cities of [[Overland Park, Kansas|Overland Park]], [[Olathe, Kansas|Olathe]], and [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]].\n\nThe city is composed of several neighborhoods, including the [[River Market, Kansas City|River Market District]] in the north, the 18th and Vine District in the east, and the [[Country Club Plaza]] in the south. Kansas City is known for its long tradition of [[jazz]] music and culture, especially theater \u2013 the city was the center of the [[Vaudevillian]] [[Orpheum circuit]] in the 1920s. It is also noted for its cuisine, including its distinctive [[Kansas City-style barbecue]], and its craft breweries.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Timeline of Kansas City, Missouri|History of the Kansas City metropolitan area}}\nKansas City, Missouri, was incorporated as a town on June 1, 1850, and as a city on March 28, 1853. The [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area|territory]], straddling the border between Missouri and Kansas at the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers, was considered a good place to build settlements.\n\nThe [[Antioch Christian Church (Kansas City, Missouri)|Antioch Christian Church]], [[Dr. James Compton House]], and [[Woodneath]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a|dateform=mdy}}</ref>\n\n===Exploration and settlement===\n[[File:Westport Pioneers Statue.jpg|thumb|upright|Kansas City Pioneer Square monument in Westport features [[Pony Express]] founder [[Alexander Majors]], Westport/Kansas City founder [[John Calvin McCoy]], and Mountain-man [[Jim Bridger]] who owned Chouteau's Store.]]\n\nThe first documented European visitor to the eventual site of Kansas City was [[\u00c9tienne de Veniard, Sieur de Bourgmont]], who was also the first European to explore the lower Missouri River. Criticized for his response to the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] attack on [[Fort D\u00e9troit]], he had deserted his post as fort commander and was avoiding French authorities. Bourgmont lived with a Native American wife in a village about {{convert|90|mi|km}} east near [[Brunswick, Missouri]], where he illegally traded [[furs]].\n\nTo clear his name, he wrote ''Exact Description of Louisiana, of Its Harbors, Lands and Rivers, and Names of the Indian Tribes That Occupy It, and the Commerce and Advantages to Be Derived Therefrom for the Establishment of a Colony'' in 1713 followed in 1714 by ''The Route to Be Taken to Ascend the Missouri River''. In the documents, he describes the junction of the \"Grande Riv[i\u00e8re] des Cansez\" and Missouri River, making him the first to adopt those names. French cartographer [[Guillaume Delisle]] used the descriptions to make the area's first reasonably accurate map.\n\nThe Spanish took over the region in the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763, but were not to play a major role other than taxing and licensing Missouri River ship traffic. The French continued their [[fur trade]] under Spanish license. The [[Chouteau]] family operated under Spanish license at [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], in the lower [[Missouri River Valley|Missouri Valley]] as early as 1765 and in 1821 the Chouteaus reached Kansas City, where [[Fran\u00e7ois Chouteau]] established Chouteau's Landing.\n\nAfter the 1804 [[Louisiana Purchase]], [[Lewis and Clark]] visited the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers, noting it was a good place to build a fort. In 1831, a group of [[Mormons]] from New York settled in what would become the city. They built the first school within Kansas City's current boundaries, but were forced out by [[mob violence]] in 1833, and their settlement remained vacant.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wilkinson |first=Ernest L. |title=Brigham Young University: The First 100 Years |location=Provo |publisher=BYU Press |year=1976 |volume=Vol. 1 |page=7 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1833 [[John Calvin McCoy|John McCoy]], son of [[Baptist]] missionary [[Isaac McCoy]], established [[Westport, Kansas City|West Port]] along the [[Santa Fe Trail]], {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=off|adj=off|sp=us}} away from the river. In 1834 McCoy established [[Westport, Kansas City|Westport Landing]] on a bend in the Missouri to serve as a landing point for West Port. Soon after, the Kansas Town Company, a group of investors, began to settle the area, taking their name from an English spelling of \"Cansez.\" In 1850, the landing area was incorporated as the Town of Kansas.<ref>{{cite web | title=Why is Kansas City located in Missouri instead of Kansas? | url=http://www.kclibrary.org/kchistory/why-kansas-city-located-missouri-instead-kansas | accessdate=January 2, 2010 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716232838/http://www.kclibrary.org/kchistory/why-kansas-city-located-missouri-instead-kansas | archivedate=July 16, 2010 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nBy that time, the Town of Kansas, Westport, and nearby [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], had become critical points in the [[Territorial acquisitions of the United States|westward expansion]] of the United States. Three major [[Historical roads and trails of the United States|trail]]s \u2013 the [[Santa Fe Trail|Santa Fe]], [[California Trail|California]], and [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]] \u2013 all passed through Jackson County.\n\nOn February 22, 1853, the City of Kansas was created with a newly elected mayor. It had an area of {{convert|0.70|sqmi|km2}} and a population of 2,500. The boundary lines at that time extended from the middle of the Missouri River south to what is now Ninth Street, and from Bluff Street on the west to a point between Holmes Road and Charlotte Street on the east.<ref>{{cite web | title=Early City Limits | url=http://images.kclibrary.org/localhistory/media.cfm?mediaID=95980 | accessdate =September 11, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927175946/http://images.kclibrary.org/localhistory/media.cfm?mediaID=95980 |archivedate = September 27, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===American Civil War===\n\nDuring the Civil War, the city and its immediate surroundings were the focus of intense military activity. Although the [[First Battle of Independence]] in August 1862 resulted in a [[Confederate States Army]] victory, the Confederates were unable to leverage their win in any significant fashion, as Kansas City was occupied by Union troops and proved too heavily fortified to assault. The [[Second Battle of Independence]], which occurred on October 21\u201322, 1864, as part of [[Sterling Price]]'s [[Price's Raid|Missouri expedition of 1864]], also resulted in a Confederate triumph. Once again their victory proved hollow, as Price was decisively defeated in the pivotal [[Battle of Westport]] the next day, effectively ending Confederate efforts to regain Missouri.\n\nGeneral [[Thomas Ewing, Jr.|Thomas Ewing]], in response to a successful raid on nearby [[Lawrence, Kansas]], led by [[William Quantrill]], issued [[General Order No. 11 (1863)|General Order No. 11]], forcing the eviction of residents in four western Missouri counties \u2013 including Jackson \u2013 except those living in the city and nearby communities and those whose allegiance to the Union was certified by Ewing.\n\n===Post-Civil War===\nAfter the Civil War, Kansas City grew rapidly, largely losing its Southern identity. The selection of the city over [[Leavenworth, Kansas]], for the [[Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad]] bridge over the Missouri River brought about significant growth. The population exploded after 1869, when the Hannibal Bridge, designed by [[Octave Chanute]], opened. The boom prompted a name change to Kansas City in 1889, and the city limits to be extended south and east. Westport became part of Kansas City on December 2, 1897. In 1900, Kansas City was the 22nd largest city in the country, with a population of 163,752 residents.<ref name=\"U.S. Census Bureau\">{{cite web|title=Missouri \u2013 Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=December 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archivedate=August 12, 2012 }}</ref>\n[[File:Junction of Main and Delaware Streets, Kansas City, Mo (NYPL b12647398-68704).tiff|thumb|Junction of Main and Delaware Streets in 1898]]\nKansas City, guided by architect [[George Kessler]], became a forefront example of the [[City Beautiful]] movement, offering a network of boulevards and parks.<ref>{{cite web | title=Historic Sanborn Maps of Kansas City | url=http://digital.library.umsystem.edu/image/umcscsanic/title/kansas+city+missouri | publisher = [[University of Missouri]] Digital Library | accessdate =March 21, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe relocation of [[Kansas City Union Station|Union Station]] to its current location in 1914 and the opening of the [[Liberty Memorial]] in 1923 provided two of the city's most identifiable landmarks.

The machine fell in 1939 when Pendergast, riddled with health problems, pleaded guilty to tax evasion after long federal investigations. His biographers have summed up Pendergast's uniqueness:\n<blockquote>Pendergast may bear comparison to various big-city bosses, but his open alliance with hardened criminals, his cynical subversion of the democratic process, his monarchistic style of living, his increasingly insatiable gambling habit, his grasping for a business empire, and his promotion of Kansas City as a wide-open town with every kind of vice imaginable, combined with his professed compassion for the poor and very real role as city builder, made him bigger than life, difficult to characterize.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lawrence H.

Bryant's and Gates are the two definitive Kansas City barbecue restaurants; native Kansas Citian and essayist Calvin Trillin famously called Bryant's \"the single best restaurant in the world\" in an essay he wrote for ''Playboy'' magazine in the 1960s.

The [[Big 12 Women's Basketball Tournament|women's tournament]] is played at [[Municipal Auditorium (Kansas City)|Municipal Auditorium]].\n\nThe city has one [[NCAA Division I]] program, the [[Kansas City Roos]], representing the [[University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City]] (UMKC). The program, historically known as the UMKC Kangaroos, adopted its current branding after the 2018\u201319 school year.\n\nIn addition to serving as the home stadium of the Chiefs, [[Arrowhead Stadium]] serves as the venue for various intercollegiate football games. It has hosted the Big 12 Championship Game five times. On the last weekend in October, the [[Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association|MIAA]] Fall Classic rivalry game between [[Northwest Missouri State Bearcats football|Northwest Missouri State University]] and [[Pittsburg State University]] took place at the stadium.\n\n===Professional rugby===\nKansas City is represented on the [[rugby union|rugby]] pitch by the [[Kansas City Blues RFC]], a former member of the [[Rugby Super League (United States)|Rugby Super League]] and a Division 1 club. The team works closely with Sporting Kansas City and splits home-games between Sporting's training pitch and [[Rockhurst University]]'s stadium.\n\n===Former teams===\nKansas City briefly had four short-term major league baseball teams between 1884 and 1915: the [[Kansas City Cowboys (Union Association)|Kansas City Unions]] of the short-lived [[Union Association]] in 1884, the [[Kansas City Cowboys (National League)|Kansas City Cowboys]] in the [[National League]] in 1886, a team of the [[Kansas City Cowboys (American Association)|same name]] in the then-major league [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] in 1888 and 1889, and the [[Kansas City Packers]] in the [[Federal League]] in 1914 and 1915.  The [[Kansas City Monarchs]] of the now-defunct [[Negro National League (1920\u201331)|Negro National]] and [[Negro American League|Negro American]] Leagues represented Kansas City from 1920 through 1955. The city also had a number of minor league baseball teams between 1885 and 1955. From 1903 through 1954, the [[Kansas City Blues (American Association)|Kansas City Blues]] played in the high-level [[American Association (20th Century)|American Association]] minor league. In 1955, Kansas City became a major league city when the [[Oakland Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]] baseball franchise relocated to the city in 1955. Following the 1967 season, the team relocated to [[Oakland, California]].\n\nKansas City was represented in the [[National Basketball Association]] by the [[Sacramento Kings|Kansas City Kings]] (called the Kansas City-Omaha Kings from 1972 to 1975), when the former Cincinnati Royals moved to the Midwest. The team left for [[Sacramento]] in 1985.\n\nIn 1974, the [[National Hockey League]] placed an expansion team in Kansas City called the [[Kansas City Scouts]]. The team moved to [[Denver]] in 1976, then to [[New Jersey]] in 1982 where they have remained ever since as the [[New Jersey Devils]].\n\n[[File:Penn Valley Park.jpg|thumb|View of downtown from [[Penn Valley Park]]]]\n[[File:Loose Park Rose Garden.jpg|thumb|The rose garden in [[Loose Park]], Kansas City's third largest public park.]]\n\n==Parks and boulevards==\n[[File:JC Nichols Fountain by Henri-L\u00e9on Gr\u00e9ber Kansas City.jpg|thumb|''J.C.

The city has a council/manager form of government. The role of [[city manager]] has diminished over the years. The non-elective office of city manager was created following excesses during the Pendergast days. The mayor is the head of the [[Kansas City, Missouri City Council|Kansas City City Council]], which has 12 members (one member for each district, plus one at large member per district). The mayor is the presiding member. Kansas City holds city elections in every fourth odd numbered year. The last citywide election was held in May 2015. The officials took office in August 2015 and will hold the position until 2019.\n\nPendergast was the most prominent leader during the machine politics days. The most nationally prominent Democrat associated with the machine was [[Harry S Truman]], who became a Senator, Vice President and then [[President of the United States]] from 1945 to 1953. Kansas City is the seat of the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri]], one of two [[United States district courts|federal district courts]] in Missouri.  The [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri]] is in St. Louis. It also is the seat of the Western District of the [[Missouri Court of Appeals]], one of three districts of that court (the Eastern District is in St. Louis and the Southern District is in [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]]).\n\nThe Mayor, City Council, and City Manager are listed below:<ref>https://www.kceb.org/useruploads/2019_mayorCC/Election_Summary_Official_6-19.pdf\n\nhttps://www.kcmo.gov/city-hall/city-officials/city-council-members {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190719152736/https://www.kcmo.gov/city-hall/city-officials/city-council-members |date=July 19, 2019 }}\n\n<br /></ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The urban core of Kansas City consistently votes Democratic in presidential elections; however, on the state and local level Republicans often find success, especially in the Northland and other suburban areas of Kansas City.\n\n===Federal representation===\nKansas City is represented by three members of the [[United States House of Representatives]]:\n*[[Missouri's 4th congressional district]] \u2013 the Cass County portion of Kansas City; represented by [[Vicky Hartzler]] (Republican)\n*[[Missouri's 5th congressional district]] \u2013 all of Kansas City proper in Jackson County, plus Independence; represented by [[Emanuel Cleaver]] (Democrat)\n*[[Missouri's 6th congressional district]] \u2013 all of Kansas City proper north of the [[Missouri River]] and plus suburbs in eastern Jackson County beyond Independence; represented by [[Sam Graves]] (Republican)\n\n[[File:Police Respond to Shooting.jpg|thumb|Police respond to a shooting in the [[Crossroads, Kansas City|Crossroads]] area during the early hours of New Years Day 2016.]]\n\n===Crime===\nSome of the earliest organized violence in Kansas City erupted during the [[American Civil War]]. Shortly after the city's incorporation in 1850, so-called [[Bleeding Kansas]] erupted, affecting [[border ruffians]] and [[Jayhawkers]]. During the war, Union troops [[General Order \u2116 11 (1863)|burned all occupied dwellings]] in Jackson County south of Brush Creek and east of Blue Creek to Independence in an attempt to halt raids into Kansas. After the war, the ''[[Kansas City Times]]'' turned outlaw [[Jesse James]] into a folk hero via its coverage. James was born in the Kansas City metro area at [[Kearney, Missouri]], and notoriously robbed the Kansas City Fairgrounds at 12th Street and Campbell Avenue.\n\nIn the early 20th century under Pendergast, Kansas City became the country's \"most wide open town\". While this would give rise to [[Kansas City Jazz]], it also led to the rise of the [[Kansas City crime family|Kansas City mob]] (initially under [[Johnny Lazia]]), as well as the arrival of [[organized crime]]. In the 1970s, the Kansas City mob was involved in a gang war over control of the [[River Quay]] entertainment district, in which three buildings were bombed and several gangsters were killed. Police investigations gained after boss [[Nick Civella]] was recorded discussing gambling bets on [[Super Bowl IV]] (where the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Minnesota Vikings). The war and investigation led to the end of mob control of the [[Stardust Casino]], which was the basis for the film ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]'', though the production minimizes the Kansas City connections.\n\n{{As of|November 2012}}, Kansas City [[United States cities by crime rate|ranked 18th]] on the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI)'s annual survey of crime rates for cities with populations over 100,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2013/02/01/fbi-violent-crime-drops-in-kansas.html |title=FBI: Violent crime drops in Kansas City for first half of 2012 \u2013 Kansas City Business Journal |website=Bizjournals.com |date=February 1, 2013 |accessdate=July 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730054734/http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2013/02/01/fbi-violent-crime-drops-in-kansas.html |archive-date=July 30, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Much of the city's violent crime occurs on the city's lower income East Side.

The ''Star'' sold off the WDAF stations in 1957, following an [[antitrust]] investigation by the United States government (reportedly launched at Truman's behest, following a long-standing feud with the ''Star'') over the newspaper's ownership of television and radio stations.

Between 1931 and 1982 Kansas City was home to the [[Calvin Company]], a large movie production company that specialized in promotional and sales short films and commercials for corporations, as well as educational films for schools and the government. Calvin was an important venue for Kansas City arts, training local filmmakers who went on to [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood careers]] and also employing local actors, most of whom earned their main income in fields such as radio and television announcing. Kansas City native [[Robert Altman]] directed movies at the Calvin Company, which led him to shoot his first feature film, ''[[The Delinquents (1957 film)|The Delinquents]]'', in Kansas City using many local players.\n\nThe 1983 television movie ''[[The Day After]]'' was filmed in Kansas City and Lawrence, Kansas. The 1990s film ''[[Truman (1995 film)|Truman]]'', starring [[Gary Sinise]], was filmed in the city. Other films shot in or around Kansas City include ''[[Article 99]]'', ''[[Mr. and Mrs. Bridge|Mr. & Mrs. Bridge]]'', ''[[Kansas City (film)|Kansas City]]'', ''[[Paper Moon (film)|Paper Moon]]'', ''[[In Cold Blood (film)|In Cold Blood]]'', ''[[Ninth Street]]'', and ''[[Sometimes They Come Back (film)|Sometimes They Come Back]]'' (in and around nearby [[Liberty, Missouri]]). More recently, a scene in the controversial film ''[[Br\u00fcno]]'' was filmed in downtown Kansas City's historic Hotel Phillips.\n\nToday, Kansas City is home to an active independent film community. The [[Independent Filmmaker's Coalition]] is an organization dedicated to expanding and improving independent filmmaking in Kansas City. The city launched the KC Film Office in October 2014 with the goal of better marketing the city for prospective television shows and movies to be filmed there. The City Council passed several film tax incentives in February 2016 to take effect in May 2016; the KC Film Office is coordinating its efforts with the State of Missouri to reinstate film incentives on a statewide level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/tax-breaks-for-films-could-bring-cash-to-kc|title=Tax breaks for films could bring cash to Kansas City|last=Monreal|first=Jane|date=April 2, 2016|website=KSHB|access-date=May 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417155354/http://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/tax-breaks-for-films-could-bring-cash-to-kc|archive-date=April 17, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure==\n{{Main|Kansas City Metropolitan Area#Transportation|Kansas City Metropolitan Area}}\n\nOriginally, Kansas City was the launching point for travelers on the [[Santa Fe Trail|Santa Fe]], [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]], and [[California Trail|California]] trails. Later, with the construction of the [[Hannibal Bridge]] across the [[Missouri River]], it became the junction of 11 trunk railroads. More rail tonnage passes through the city than through any other U.S. city. [[Trans World Airlines]] (TWA) located its headquarters in the city, and had ambitious plans to turn the city into an air hub.\n\n===Highways===\n[[File:Alphamap.gif|thumb|Kansas City is a major meeting place for several of the nation's busiest highways.]]\nMissouri and Kansas were the first states to start building interstates with [[Interstate 70]]. [[Interstate 435]], which encircles the entire city, is the second longest beltway in the nation. ([[Interstate 275 (Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana)|Interstate 275]] around [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] is the longest.) The Kansas City metro area has more limited-access highway lane-miles per capita than any other large US metro area, over 27% more than the second-place [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex]], over 50% more than the average American metropolitan area. From 2013 to 2017 the average commuting time was 21.8 minutes. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/kansascitycitymissouri/PST045218|title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: Kansas City city, Missouri|website=www.census.gov}}</ref> The [[Sierra Club]] blames the extensive freeway network for excessive [[urban sprawl|sprawl]] and the decline of central Kansas City.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sierraclub.org/sprawl/report98/kansas_city.asp |title=1998 Sprawl Report- Sprawl \u2013 Sierra Club |publisher=Sierraclub.org |accessdate=May 5, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516193458/http://www.sierraclub.org/sprawl/report98/kansas_city.asp |archive-date=May 16, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> On the other hand, the relatively uncongested road network contributes significantly to Kansas City's position as one of America's largest [[logistics]] hubs.<ref>[http://www.kcsmartport.com/sec_news/media/documents/ShippingCentral.pdf Kcsmartport.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325133930/http://www.kcsmartport.com/sec_news/media/documents/ShippingCentral.pdf |date=March 25, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Airports===\n[[File:Kci.JPG|thumb|[[Kansas City International Airport]]]]\n\n[[Kansas City International Airport]], airport code MCI (Mid-Continent International Airport) was built to TWA's specifications to make a world hub.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flykci.com/newsroom/press-kit/backgrounder/|title=Backgrounder|website=Kansas City International Airport}}</ref> Its original passenger-friendly design placed each of its gates \n{{convert|100|ft|m}} from the street. Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]], it required a costly overhaul to conform to the tighter security protocols. [[Charles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport]] was TWA's original headquarters and houses the [[Airline History Museum]]. It is still used for [[general aviation]] and airshows.\n\n===Public transportation===\nLike most American cities, Kansas City's mass transit system was originally rail-based. From 1870 to 1957, Kansas City's streetcar system was among the top in the country, with over {{convert|300|mi|km}} of track at its peak. The rapid sprawl in the following years led this private system to be shut down.\n\n====KCATA- RideKC====\nOn December 28, 1965, the [[Kansas City Area Transportation Authority]] (KCATA) was formed via a bi-state compact created by the Missouri and Kansas legislatures. The compact gave the KCATA responsibility for planning, construction, owning and operating passenger transportation systems and facilities within the seven-county area.\n\n=====RideKC Bus and MAX=====\n[[File:RideKC Bus.jpg|thumb|A newly branded RideKC Bus.]]\nIn July 2005, the KCATA launched Kansas City's first [[bus rapid transit]] line, the [[Metro Area Express]] (MAX). MAX links the River Market, Downtown, [[Kansas City Union Station|Union Station]], Crown Center and the Country Club Plaza.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kcata.org/maps_schedules/max/ |title=Maps and Schedules |publisher=KCATA |accessdate=March 16, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420042341/http://www.kcata.org/maps_schedules/max |archive-date=April 20, 2010 |url-status=unfit }}</ref> MAX operates and is marketed more like a rail system than a local bus line. A unique identity was created for MAX, including 13 modern diesel buses and easily identifiable \"stations\". MAX features (real-time [[global positioning system|GPS]] tracking of buses, available at every station), and stoplights automatically change in their favor if buses are behind schedule. In 2010, a second MAX line was added on Troost Avenue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kcata.org/light_rail_max/max_and_bus_rapid_transit/ |title=Light Rail and MAX |publisher=KCATA |accessdate=March 16, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115112506/http://www.kcata.org/light_rail_max/max_and_bus_rapid_transit/ |archive-date=January 15, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> The city is planning another MAX line down Prospect Avenue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kcata.org/light_rail_max/prospect_ave_study|title=Prospect Ave. MAX {{!}} Light Rail and MAX {{!}} KCATA|last=Authority|first=Kansas City Area Transportation|website=www.kcata.org|access-date=May 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602120949/http://www.kcata.org/light_rail_max/prospect_ave_study|archive-date=June 2, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Prospect MAX line launched in 2019 and Mayor [[Quinton Lucas]] announced the service would be fare-free indefinitely.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.masstransitmag.com/technology/fare-collection/news/21127532/mo-prospect-max-bus-service-will-be-farefree-indefinitely-for-riders|title=MO: Prospect MAX bus service will be fare-free indefinitely for riders|last=Rice|first=Glenn|date=February 28, 2020|website=Mass Transit Magazine|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>\n[[File:Streetcar 10main.jpg|thumb|upright|KC Streetcar departing the Library stop heading north to the River Market.]]\n\n=====RideKC Streetcar=====\nOn December 12, 2012, a ballot initiative to construct a $102 million, 2-mile (3200 m) modern streetcar line in downtown Kansas City was approved by local voters.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2012/12/12/kansas-city-voters-approve-streetcar.html|title=Kansas City voters approve streetcar plan|newspaper=Kansas City Business Journal|accessdate=January 26, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730051350/http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2012/12/12/kansas-city-voters-approve-streetcar.html|archive-date=July 30, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> The streetcar route runs along Main Street from the [[River Market]] to [[Union Station (Kansas City, Missouri)|Union Station]]; it debuted on May 6, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article76034492.html|title=Crowds jam streetcars in Kansas City return|website=kansascity|access-date=May 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507115829/http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article76034492.html|archive-date=May 7, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> A new non-profit corporation made up of private sector stakeholders and city appointees \u2013 the [[Kansas City Streetcar Authority]] \u2013 operates and maintains the system.

The buses and other transit options will be branded as: RideKC Bus, RideKC MAX, RideKC Streetcar, and RideKC Bridj. RideKC Bridj is a micro transit service partnership between Ford Bridj and KCATA that began on March 7, 2016. Users download the Bridj app and use the service much like a taxi service.

It is the most populated municipality and historic core city of the [[Kansas City metropolitan area]], which straddles the [[Kansas]]\u2013[[Missouri]] state line and has a CSA population of 2,487,053. Most of the city lies within [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]], but portions spill into [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay]], [[Cass County, Missouri|Cass]], and [[Platte County, Missouri|Platte]] counties. The city borders [[Johnson County, Kansas|Johnson County]] and [[Kansas City, Kansas]], (KCK/[[Wyandotte County, Kansas|Wyandotte County]]) in [[Kansas]]. Kansas City was founded in the 1830s as a [[Missouri River]] port at its confluence with the [[Kansas River]] coming in from the west. On June 1, 1850, the town of Kansas was incorporated; shortly after came the establishment of the [[Kansas Territory]]. Confusion between the two ensued, and the name Kansas City was assigned to distinguish them soon after. \n\nSitting on Missouri's western boundary with [[Kansas]], with [[Downtown Kansas City|Downtown]] near the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers, the city encompasses some {{convert|319.03|sqmi|km2}}, making it the [[List of United States cities by area|23rd largest city by total area]] in the United States. Along with [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], one of its major suburbs, it serves as one of the two county seats of Jackson County. Other major suburbs include the Missouri cities of [[Blue Springs, Missouri|Blue Springs]] and [[Lee's Summit, Missouri|Lee's Summit]] and the Kansas cities of [[Overland Park, Kansas|Overland Park]], [[Olathe, Kansas|Olathe]], and [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]].\n\nThe city is composed of several neighborhoods, including the [[River Market, Kansas City|River Market District]] in the north, the 18th and Vine District in the east, and the [[Country Club Plaza]] in the south. Kansas City is known for its long tradition of [[jazz]] music and culture, especially theater \u2013 the city was the center of the [[Vaudevillian]] [[Orpheum circuit]] in the 1920s. It is also noted for its cuisine, including its distinctive [[Kansas City-style barbecue]], and its craft breweries.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Timeline of Kansas City, Missouri|History of the Kansas City metropolitan area}}\nKansas City, Missouri, was incorporated as a town on June 1, 1850, and as a city on March 28, 1853. The [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area|territory]], straddling the border between Missouri and Kansas at the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers, was considered a good place to build settlements.\n\nThe [[Antioch Christian Church (Kansas City, Missouri)|Antioch Christian Church]], [[Dr. James Compton House]], and [[Woodneath]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a|dateform=mdy}}</ref>\n\n===Exploration and settlement===\n[[File:Westport Pioneers Statue.jpg|thumb|upright|Kansas City Pioneer Square monument in Westport features [[Pony Express]] founder [[Alexander Majors]], Westport/Kansas City founder [[John Calvin McCoy]], and Mountain-man [[Jim Bridger]] who owned Chouteau's Store.]]\n\nThe first documented European visitor to the eventual site of Kansas City was [[\u00c9tienne de Veniard, Sieur de Bourgmont]], who was also the first European to explore the lower Missouri River. Criticized for his response to the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] attack on [[Fort D\u00e9troit]], he had deserted his post as fort commander and was avoiding French authorities. Bourgmont lived with a Native American wife in a village about {{convert|90|mi|km}} east near [[Brunswick, Missouri]], where he illegally traded [[furs]].\n\nTo clear his name, he wrote ''Exact Description of Louisiana, of Its Harbors, Lands and Rivers, and Names of the Indian Tribes That Occupy It, and the Commerce and Advantages to Be Derived Therefrom for the Establishment of a Colony'' in 1713 followed in 1714 by ''The Route to Be Taken to Ascend the Missouri River''. In the documents, he describes the junction of the \"Grande Riv[i\u00e8re] des Cansez\" and Missouri River, making him the first to adopt those names. French cartographer [[Guillaume Delisle]] used the descriptions to make the area's first reasonably accurate map.\n\nThe Spanish took over the region in the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763, but were not to play a major role other than taxing and licensing Missouri River ship traffic. The French continued their [[fur trade]] under Spanish license. The [[Chouteau]] family operated under Spanish license at [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], in the lower [[Missouri River Valley|Missouri Valley]] as early as 1765 and in 1821 the Chouteaus reached Kansas City, where [[Fran\u00e7ois Chouteau]] established Chouteau's Landing.\n\nAfter the 1804 [[Louisiana Purchase]], [[Lewis and Clark]] visited the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers, noting it was a good place to build a fort. In 1831, a group of [[Mormons]] from New York settled in what would become the city. They built the first school within Kansas City's current boundaries, but were forced out by [[mob violence]] in 1833, and their settlement remained vacant.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wilkinson |first=Ernest L. |title=Brigham Young University: The First 100 Years |location=Provo |publisher=BYU Press |year=1976 |volume=Vol. 1 |page=7 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1833 [[John Calvin McCoy|John McCoy]], son of [[Baptist]] missionary [[Isaac McCoy]], established [[Westport, Kansas City|West Port]] along the [[Santa Fe Trail]], {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=off|adj=off|sp=us}} away from the river. In 1834 McCoy established [[Westport, Kansas City|Westport Landing]] on a bend in the Missouri to serve as a landing point for West Port. Soon after, the Kansas Town Company, a group of investors, began to settle the area, taking their name from an English spelling of \"Cansez.\" In 1850, the landing area was incorporated as the Town of Kansas.<ref>{{cite web | title=Why is Kansas City located in Missouri instead of Kansas? | url=http://www.kclibrary.org/kchistory/why-kansas-city-located-missouri-instead-kansas | accessdate=January 2, 2010 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716232838/http://www.kclibrary.org/kchistory/why-kansas-city-located-missouri-instead-kansas | archivedate=July 16, 2010 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nBy that time, the Town of Kansas, Westport, and nearby [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], had become critical points in the United States' [[Territorial acquisitions of the United States|westward expansion]]. Three major [[Historical roads and trails of the United States|trail]]s \u2013 the [[Santa Fe Trail|Santa Fe]], [[California Trail|California]], and [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]] \u2013 all passed through Jackson County.\n\nOn February 22, 1853, the City of Kansas was created with a newly elected mayor. It had an area of {{convert|0.70|sqmi|km2}} and a population of 2,500. The boundary lines at that time extended from the middle of the Missouri River south to what is now Ninth Street, and from Bluff Street on the west to a point between Holmes Road and Charlotte Street on the east.<ref>{{cite web | title=Early City Limits | url=http://images.kclibrary.org/localhistory/media.cfm?mediaID=95980 | accessdate =September 11, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927175946/http://images.kclibrary.org/localhistory/media.cfm?mediaID=95980 |archivedate = September 27, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===American Civil War===\n\nDuring the Civil War, the city and its immediate surroundings were the focus of intense military activity. Although the [[First Battle of Independence]] in August 1862 resulted in a [[Confederate States Army]] victory, the Confederates were unable to leverage their win in any significant fashion, as Kansas City was occupied by Union troops and proved too heavily fortified to assault. The [[Second Battle of Independence]], which occurred on October 21\u201322, 1864, as part of [[Sterling Price]]'s [[Price's Raid|Missouri expedition of 1864]], also resulted in a Confederate triumph. Once again their victory proved hollow, as Price was decisively defeated in the pivotal [[Battle of Westport]] the next day, effectively ending Confederate efforts to regain Missouri.\n\nGeneral [[Thomas Ewing, Jr.|Thomas Ewing]], in response to a successful raid on nearby [[Lawrence, Kansas]], led by [[William Quantrill]], issued [[General Order No. 11 (1863)|General Order No. 11]], forcing the eviction of residents in four western Missouri counties \u2013 including Jackson \u2013 except those living in the city and nearby communities and those whose allegiance to the Union was certified by Ewing.\n\n===Post-Civil War===\nAfter the Civil War, Kansas City grew rapidly, largely losing its Southern identity. The selection of the city over [[Leavenworth, Kansas]], for the [[Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad]] bridge over the Missouri River brought about significant growth. The population exploded after 1869, when the Hannibal Bridge, designed by [[Octave Chanute]], opened. The boom prompted a name change to Kansas City in 1889, and the city limits to be extended south and east. Westport became part of Kansas City on December 2, 1897. In 1900, Kansas City was the 22nd largest city in the country, with a population of 163,752 residents.<ref name=\"U.S. Census Bureau\">{{cite web|title=Missouri \u2013 Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=December 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archivedate=August 12, 2012 }}</ref>\n[[File:Junction of Main and Delaware Streets, Kansas City, Mo (NYPL b12647398-68704).tiff|thumb|Junction of Main and Delaware Streets in 1898]]\nKansas City, guided by architect [[George Kessler]], became a forefront example of the [[City Beautiful]] movement, offering a network of boulevards and parks.<ref>{{cite web | title=Historic Sanborn Maps of Kansas City | url=http://digital.library.umsystem.edu/image/umcscsanic/title/kansas+city+missouri | publisher = [[University of Missouri]] Digital Library | accessdate =March 21, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe relocation of [[Kansas City Union Station|Union Station]] to its current location in 1914 and the opening of the [[Liberty Memorial]] in 1923 provided two of the city's most identifiable landmarks. [[Robert A. Long]], president of the Liberty Memorial Association, was a driving force in the funding for construction. Long was a longtime resident and wealthy businessman. He built the [[R.A. Long Building]] for the [[Long-Bell Lumber Company]], his home, [[Corinthian Hall]] (now the [[Kansas City Museum]]) and [[Longview Farm]].\n\nFurther spurring Kansas City's growth was the opening of the innovative [[Country Club Plaza]] development by [[Jesse Clyde Nichols|J.C. Nichols]] in 1925, as part of his [[Country Club District]] plan.\n\n====20th century streetcar system====\n[[Streetcars in Kansas City|The Kansas City streetcar system]] once had hundreds of miles of streetcars running through the city and was one of the largest systems in the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kcur.org/show/central-standard/2013-11-22/the-history-of-the-kansas-city-streetcar|title=The History Of The Kansas City Streetcar|website=KCUR 89.3 - NPR in Kansas City.

Several important buildings and structures were built during this time, including the [[Kansas City City Hall]] and the Jackson County Courthouse. The machine fell in 1939 when Pendergast, riddled with health problems, pleaded guilty to tax evasion after long federal investigations. His biographers have summed up Pendergast's uniqueness:\n<blockquote>Pendergast may bear comparison to various big-city bosses, but his open alliance with hardened criminals, his cynical subversion of the democratic process, his monarchistic style of living, his increasingly insatiable gambling habit, his grasping for a business empire, and his promotion of Kansas City as a wide-open town with every kind of vice imaginable, combined with his professed compassion for the poor and very real role as city builder, made him bigger than life, difficult to characterize.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lawrence H.

Hulston|title=Pendergast!|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=n-Qiu53FCOsC|page=11}}|year=2013|publisher=University of Missouri Press|page=xi}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Post\u2013World War II===\nKansas City's suburban development began with a streetcar system in the early decades of the 20th century.

Gates, opened Gates Bar-B-Q, later [[Gates and Sons Bar-B-Q]] when his son Ollie joined the family business. Bryant's and Gates are the two definitive Kansas City barbecue restaurants; native Kansas Citian and essayist Calvin Trillin famously called Bryant's \"the single best restaurant in the world\" in an essay he wrote for ''Playboy'' magazine in the 1960s. [[Fiorella's Jack Stack Barbecue]] is also well regarded. In 1977, [[Rich Davis]], a psychiatrist, test-marketed his own concoction called K.C. Soul Style Barbecue Sauce. He renamed it [[KC Masterpiece]], and in 1986, he sold the recipe to the [[Kingsford (charcoal)|Kingsford]] division of [[Clorox]]. Davis retained rights to operate restaurants using the name and sauce, whose recipe popularized the use of molasses as a sweetener in Kansas City-style barbecue sauces.

The city has a council/manager form of government. The role of [[city manager]] has diminished over the years. The non-elective office of city manager was created following excesses during the Pendergast days. The mayor is the head of the [[Kansas City, Missouri City Council|Kansas City City Council]], which has 12 members (one member for each district, plus one at large member per district). The mayor is the presiding member. Kansas City holds city elections in every fourth odd numbered year. The last citywide election was held in May 2015. The officials took office in August 2015 and will hold the position until 2019.\n\nPendergast was the most prominent leader during the machine politics days. The most nationally prominent Democrat associated with the machine was [[Harry S Truman]], who became a Senator, Vice President and then [[President of the United States]] from 1945 to 1953. Kansas City is the seat of the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri]], one of two [[United States district courts|federal district courts]] in Missouri.  The [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri]] is in St. Louis. It also is the seat of the Western District of the [[Missouri Court of Appeals]], one of three districts of that court (the Eastern District is in St. Louis and the Southern District is in [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]]).\n\nThe Mayor, City Council, and City Manager are listed below:<ref>https://www.kceb.org/useruploads/2019_mayorCC/Election_Summary_Official_6-19.pdf\n\nhttps://www.kcmo.gov/city-hall/city-officials/city-council-members {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190719152736/https://www.kcmo.gov/city-hall/city-officials/city-council-members |date=July 19, 2019 }}\n\n<br /></ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The urban core of Kansas City consistently votes Democratic in presidential elections; however, on the state and local level Republicans often find success, especially in the Northland and other suburban areas of Kansas City.\n\n===Federal representation===\nKansas City is represented by three members of the [[United States House of Representatives]]:\n*[[Missouri's 4th congressional district]] \u2013 the Cass County portion of Kansas City; represented by [[Vicky Hartzler]] (Republican)\n*[[Missouri's 5th congressional district]] \u2013 all of Kansas City proper in Jackson County, plus Independence; represented by [[Emanuel Cleaver]] (Democrat)\n*[[Missouri's 6th congressional district]] \u2013 all of Kansas City proper north of the [[Missouri River]] and plus suburbs in eastern Jackson County beyond Independence; represented by [[Sam Graves]] (Republican)\n\n[[File:Police Respond to Shooting.jpg|thumb|Police respond to a shooting in the [[Crossroads, Kansas City|Crossroads]] area during the early hours of New Years Day 2016.]]\n\n===Crime===\nSome of the earliest organized violence in Kansas City erupted during the [[American Civil War]]. Shortly after the city's incorporation in 1850, so-called [[Bleeding Kansas]] erupted, affecting [[border ruffians]] and [[Jayhawkers]]. During the war, Union troops [[General Order \u2116 11 (1863)|burned all occupied dwellings]] in Jackson County south of Brush Creek and east of Blue Creek to Independence in an attempt to halt raids into Kansas. After the war, the ''[[Kansas City Times]]'' turned outlaw [[Jesse James]] into a folk hero via its coverage. James was born in the Kansas City metro area at [[Kearney, Missouri]], and notoriously robbed the Kansas City Fairgrounds at 12th Street and Campbell Avenue.\n\nIn the early 20th century under Pendergast, Kansas City became the country's \"most wide open town\". While this would give rise to [[Kansas City Jazz]], it also led to the rise of the [[Kansas City crime family|Kansas City mob]] (initially under [[Johnny Lazia]]), as well as the arrival of [[organized crime]]. In the 1970s, the Kansas City mob was involved in a gang war over control of the [[River Quay]] entertainment district, in which three buildings were bombed and several gangsters were killed. Police investigations gained after boss [[Nick Civella]] was recorded discussing gambling bets on [[Super Bowl IV]] (where the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Minnesota Vikings). The war and investigation led to the end of mob control of the [[Stardust Casino]], which was the basis for the film ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]'', though the production minimizes the Kansas City connections.\n\n{{As of|November 2012}}, Kansas City [[United States cities by crime rate|ranked 18th]] on the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI)'s annual survey of crime rates for cities with populations over 100,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2013/02/01/fbi-violent-crime-drops-in-kansas.html |title=FBI: Violent crime drops in Kansas City for first half of 2012 \u2013 Kansas City Business Journal |website=Bizjournals.com |date=February 1, 2013 |accessdate=July 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730054734/http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2013/02/01/fbi-violent-crime-drops-in-kansas.html |archive-date=July 30, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Much of the city's violent crime occurs on the city's lower income East Side.

The ''Star'' sold off the WDAF stations in 1957, following an [[antitrust]] investigation by the United States government (reportedly launched at Truman's behest, following a long-standing feud with the ''Star'') over the newspaper's ownership of television and radio stations.

Between 1931 and 1982 Kansas City was home to the [[Calvin Company]], a large movie production company that specialized in promotional and sales short films and commercials for corporations, as well as educational films for schools and the government. Calvin was an important venue for Kansas City arts, training local filmmakers who went on to [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood careers]] and also employing local actors, most of whom earned their main income in fields such as radio and television announcing. Kansas City native [[Robert Altman]] directed movies at the Calvin Company, which led him to shoot his first feature film, ''[[The Delinquents (1957 film)|The Delinquents]]'', in Kansas City using many local players.\n\nThe 1983 television movie ''[[The Day After]]'' was filmed in Kansas City and Lawrence, Kansas. The 1990s film ''[[Truman (1995 film)|Truman]]'', starring [[Gary Sinise]], was filmed in the city. Other films shot in or around Kansas City include ''[[Article 99]]'', ''[[Mr. and Mrs. Bridge|Mr. & Mrs. Bridge]]'', ''[[Kansas City (film)|Kansas City]]'', ''[[Paper Moon (film)|Paper Moon]]'', ''[[In Cold Blood (film)|In Cold Blood]]'', ''[[Ninth Street]]'', and ''[[Sometimes They Come Back (film)|Sometimes They Come Back]]'' (in and around nearby [[Liberty, Missouri]]). More recently, a scene in the controversial film ''[[Br\u00fcno]]'' was filmed in downtown Kansas City's historic Hotel Phillips.\n\nToday, Kansas City is home to an active independent film community. The [[Independent Filmmaker's Coalition]] is an organization dedicated to expanding and improving independent filmmaking in Kansas City. The city launched the KC Film Office in October 2014 with the goal of better marketing the city for prospective television shows and movies to be filmed there. The City Council passed several film tax incentives in February 2016 to take effect in May 2016; the KC Film Office is coordinating its efforts with the State of Missouri to reinstate film incentives on a statewide level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/tax-breaks-for-films-could-bring-cash-to-kc|title=Tax breaks for films could bring cash to Kansas City|last=Monreal|first=Jane|date=April 2, 2016|website=KSHB|access-date=May 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417155354/http://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/tax-breaks-for-films-could-bring-cash-to-kc|archive-date=April 17, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure==\n{{Main|Kansas City Metropolitan Area#Transportation|Kansas City Metropolitan Area}}\n\nOriginally, Kansas City was the launching point for travelers on the [[Santa Fe Trail|Santa Fe]], [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]], and [[California Trail|California]] trails. Later, with the construction of the [[Hannibal Bridge]] across the [[Missouri River]], it became the junction of 11 trunk railroads. More rail tonnage passes through the city than through any other U.S. city.

It is still used for [[general aviation]] and airshows.\n\n===Public transportation===\nLike most American cities, Kansas City's mass transit system was originally rail-based. From 1870 to 1957, Kansas City's streetcar system was among the top in the country, with over {{convert|300|mi|km}} of track at its peak. The rapid sprawl in the following years led this private system to be shut down.\n\n====KCATA- RideKC====\nOn December 28, 1965, the [[Kansas City Area Transportation Authority]] (KCATA) was formed via a bi-state compact created by the Missouri and Kansas legislatures. The compact gave the KCATA responsibility for planning, construction, owning and operating passenger transportation systems and facilities within the seven-county area.\n\n=====RideKC Bus and MAX=====\n[[File:RideKC Bus.jpg|thumb|A newly branded RideKC Bus.]]\nIn July 2005, the KCATA launched Kansas City's first [[bus rapid transit]] line, the [[Metro Area Express]] (MAX).

George calls Putman a punk and punches him. Badass! The movie takes a turn when the screen goes black for about 30 minutes and a faint scratching sound can be heard. I didn't really like that part. Maybe if I was blind it would have been better. There was also a river in the movie. That baby had water and everything, no foolin'! George gets in the pimp-mobile and starts cruising. This was way back before cities had blocks. roads were connected in circles. That's not really important to the plot of the movie but it is the truth. George was really burnin rubber in the pimp-mobile and ignoring the majority of traffic laws. People on the sidewalk start yelling. They call him a jerk and some other things, but he just flips them off. He doesn't even look at them because he's too cool to care. He also has a sidekick Jas. Jas doesn't get to drive the pimp-mobile. He mainly does paperwork or whatever. Undercover agents/ lawyers/ plastic surgeons/ mongoose wrestlers have a lot of paperwork. Those are all of George's job. He doesn't do all those jobs for free either. He makes over $140,000 a year! He buys like 8 pairs of shoes a year with all his dough. He doesn't even go through 8 pairs in a year because he drives the pimp-mobile everywhere he goes. The pimp-mobile gets great gas mileage; It gets at least 800 mpg. That is like the best gas mileage ever. Another record on the shelf for George! Fast forward 10 years and George is running 3 restaurants and still wrestling mongeese but not doing the other jobs. He's also just wrestling those mongooses because they're such a nuisance. One time this mongoose chased a little kid up a tree and the mongoose was on the ground barking at the kid or growling maybe. The kids mom was yelling for someone to help and George hears her cries! He charges at the mongoose and wrestles it. George won and he didn't even ask for a lot of money. That was a really cool fight scene. Also I forgot to add there was a tragic backstory in the beginning of the film that sets up the rest of the movie so it kinda makes sense. George gambles away all his money because of his gambling addiction. George goes to his blackjack dealer and asks for one more hit but the guy says \"No way man!\" George punches the guy which makes everyone watching the movie cheer but George is still poor so he doesn't cheer. He sells his pimp-mobile for $9,000 dollars and when the guy who bought it hands him the cash George punches and guy, grabs the keys back, and drive away. That's some quick thinking. The guy who bought the car was bad so the punch was well deserved. George also did like 7 donuts around the punched guy before driving and the punched guy cried. He was a punk like Putnam. It was Putnam. What a punk. Jimmy Carter makes a return to White house and starts passing a bunch of laws banning the pimp-mobile but George is like \"up yours President Carter!\" and still drive that thing. The cops try chasing him but because he ignores most the traffic laws and the pimp-mobile can also go light speed he gets away every time. There was a part where the cops almost caught him but it was just George was just playing with them. He kicked it into light speed and got away. There was a party and everyone had responsible fun.

George calls Putman a punk and punches him. Badass! The movie takes a turn when the screen goes black for about 30 minutes and a faint scratching sound can be heard. I didn't really like that part. Maybe if I was blind it would have been better. There was also a river in the movie. That baby had water and everything, no foolin'! George gets in the pimp-mobile and starts cruising. This was way back before cities had blocks. roads were connected in circles. That's not really important to the plot of the movie but it is the truth. George was really burnin rubber in the pimp-mobile and ignoring the majority of traffic laws. People on the sidewalk start yelling. They call him a jerk and some other things, but he just flips them off. He doesn't even look at them because he's too cool to care. He also has a sidekick Jas. Jas doesn't get to drive the pimp-mobile. He mainly does paperwork or whatever. Undercover agents/ lawyers/ plastic surgeons/ mongoose wrestlers have a lot of paperwork. Those are all of George's job. He doesn't do all those jobs for free either. He makes over $140,000 a year! He buys like 8 pairs of shoes a year with all his dough. He doesn't even go through 8 pairs in a year because he drives the pimp-mobile everywhere he goes. The pimp-mobile gets great gas mileage; It gets at least 800 mpg. That is like the best gas mileage ever. Another record on the shelf for George! Fast forward 10 years and George is running 3 restaurants and still wrestling mongeese but not doing the other jobs. He's also just wrestling those mongooses because they're such a nuisance. One time this mongoose chased a little kid up a tree and the mongoose was on the ground barking at the kid or growling maybe. The kids mom was yelling for someone to help and George hears her cries! He charges at the mongoose and wrestles it. George won and he didn't even ask for a lot of money. That was a really cool fight scene. Also I forgot to add there was a tragic backstory in the beginning of the film that sets up the rest of the movie so it kinda makes sense. George gambles away all his money because of his gambling addiction. George goes to his blackjack dealer and asks for one more hit but the guy says \"No way man!\" George punches the guy which makes everyone watching the movie cheer but George is still poor so he doesn't cheer. He sells his pimp-mobile for $9,000 dollars and when the guy who bought it hands him the cash George punches and guy, grabs the keys back, and drive away. That's some quick thinking. The guy who bought the car was bad so the punch was well deserved. George also did like 7 donuts around the punched guy before driving and the punched guy cried. He was a punk like Putnam. It was Putnam. What a punk. Jimmy Carter makes a return to White house and starts passing a bunch of laws banning the pimp-mobile but George is like \"up yours President Carter!\" and still drive that thing. The cops try chasing him but because he ignores most the traffic laws and the pimp-mobile can also go light speed he gets away every time. There was a part where the cops almost caught him but it was just George was just playing with them. He kicked it into light speed and got away. There was a party and everyone had responsible fun. The end.\n{{no plot|date=November 2018}}\n\n==Cast==      \n*[[John Carroll (actor)|John Carroll]] as Grant Sanborn\n*[[Mala Powers]] as Janey Edwards\n*[[Jim Backus]] as Jason Ambrose\n*[[Stan Freberg]] as Billy Weber\n*[[Kristine Miller]] as Ellen Blake\n*[[Leon Belasco]] as Professor Dubois\n*[[Ludwig St\u00f6ssel]] as Professor Berger\n*Earl Lee as Professor Palmer\n*[[Alan Reed]] as Frederick Sterling\n*[[Nana Bryant]] as Dean Blake\n*[[Carolyn Jones]] as Kitty\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0047020|Geraldine}}\n\n[[Category:1953 films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:American comedy films]]\n[[Category:1950s comedy films]]\n[[Category:Republic Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by R.
