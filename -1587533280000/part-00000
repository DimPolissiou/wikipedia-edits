Different people may develop more, or less, effective theory of mind. [[Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]] maintain that theory of mind is a byproduct of a broader [[hypercognitive]] ability of the human mind to register, monitor, and represent its own functioning.<ref>Demetriou, A., Mouyi, A., & Spanoudis, G.

This is often characterized as the ability to \"put oneself into another's shoes\". Recent [[ethology|neuro-ethological]] studies of animal behaviour suggest that even rodents may exhibit ethical or empathetic abilities.<ref>de Waal, Franz B.M.

G. 1978\" /> The emerging field of [[social neuroscience]] has also begun to address this debate, by imaging the brains of humans while they perform tasks demanding the understanding of an intention, belief or other mental state in others.\n\nAn alternative account of theory of mind is given within [[Operant conditioning|operant]] psychology and provides significant [[empirical evidence]] for a functional account of both perspective-taking and empathy. The most developed operant approach is founded on research on derived relational responding and is subsumed within what is called [[relational frame theory]]. According to this view, empathy and perspective-taking comprise a complex set of derived relational abilities based on learning to discriminate and respond verbally to ever more complex relations between self, others, place, and time, and through established relations.<ref>Hayes, S.

Oakland, California: New Harbinger.</ref>\n\n==Philosophical and psychological roots==\nContemporary discussions of Theory of Mind have their roots in philosophical debate\u2014most broadly, from the time of [[Descartes]]' ''[[Second Meditation]]'', which set the groundwork for considering the science of the mind. Most prominent recently are two contrasting approaches in the philosophical literature, to theory of mind: [[theory-theory]] and [[simulation theory of empathy|simulation theory]]. The theory-theorist imagines a veritable theory\u2014\"folk psychology\"\u2014used to reason about others' minds. The theory is developed automatically and innately, though instantiated through social interactions.<ref>Carruthers, P. (1996). Simulation and self-knowledge: a defence of the theory-theory. In P. Carruthers & P.K. Smith, Eds. ''Theories of theories of mind.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>  It is also closely related to  [[Social perception|person perception]] and  [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution theory]] from [[social psychology]].\n\nThe intuitive assumption that others are minded is an apparent tendency we all share. We [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphize]] non-human animals, inanimate objects, and even natural phenomena. [[Daniel Dennett]] referred to this tendency as taking an \"[[intentional stance]]\" toward things: we assume they have intentions, to help predict future behavior.<ref>Dennett, D. (1987). The Intentional Stance. Cambridge: MIT Press.</ref> However, there is an important distinction between taking an \"intentional stance\" toward something and entering a \"shared world\" with it. The intentional stance is a detached and functional theory we resort to during interpersonal interactions. A shared world is directly perceived and its existence structures reality itself for the perceiver. It is not just automatically applied to perception; it in many ways constitutes perception.\n\nThe philosophical roots of the [[relational frame theory]] (RFT) account of Theory of Mind arise from contextual psychology and refer to the study of organisms (both human and non-human) interacting in and with an historical and current situational context. It is an approach based on [[contextualism]], a philosophy in which any event is interpreted as an ongoing act inseparable from its current and historical context and in which a radically functional approach to truth and meaning is adopted. As a variant of contextualism, RFT focuses on the construction of practical, scientific knowledge. This scientific form of contextual psychology is virtually synonymous with the philosophy of operant psychology.<ref>{{cite web | title=Functional Contextualism | publisher=Association for Contextual Behavioral Science | url=http://www.contextualpsychology.org/functional_contextualism_0 | first=Eric | last=Fox | accessdate=March 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\nThe study of which animals are capable of attributing knowledge and mental states to others, as well as the development of this ability in human [[ontogeny]] and [[phylogenetics|phylogeny]], has identified several behavioral precursors to theory of mind. Understanding attention, understanding of others' intentions, and imitative experience with other people are hallmarks of a theory of mind that may be observed early in the development of what later becomes a full-fledged theory. \n\n[[Simon Baron-Cohen]] proposed that infants' understanding of attention in others acts as a \"critical precursor\" to the development of theory of mind.<ref name=\"Baron-Cohen, S. 1991 pp. 233-251\" /> Understanding attention involves understanding that seeing can be directed selectively as attention, that the looker assesses the seen object as \"of interest\", and that seeing can induce beliefs. A possible illustration of theory of mind in infants is joint attention. Joint attention refers to when two people look at and attend to the same thing; parents often use the act of pointing to prompt infants to engage in joint attention. Understanding this prompt requires that infants take into account another person's mental state, understanding that the person notices an object or finds it of interest. {{anchor|protodeclarative}} Baron-Cohen speculates that the inclination to spontaneously reference an object in the world as of interest, via pointing, (\"protodeclarative pointing\") and to likewise appreciate the directed attention of another, may be the underlying motive behind all human communication.<ref name=\"Baron-Cohen, S. 1991 pp. 233-251\"/>\n\nUnderstanding of others' intentions is another critical precursor to understanding other minds because intentionality, or \"aboutness\", is a fundamental feature of mental states and events. The \"intentional stance\" has been defined by [[Daniel Dennett]]<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dennett | first1 = Daniel C. | year = 1987 | title = Reprint of Intentional systems in cognitive ethology: The Panglossian paradigm defended (to p. 260) | journal = The Brain and Behavioral Sciences | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 343\u2013390 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00016393}}</ref> as an understanding that others' actions are goal-directed and arise from particular beliefs or desires.

For example, the infant uses his own experiences, orienting his head/eyes toward an object of interest to understand the movements of others who turn toward an object, that is, that they will generally attend to objects of interest or significance. Some researchers in comparative disciplines have hesitated to put a too-ponderous weight on imitation as a critical precursor to advanced human social-cognitive skills like mentalizing and empathizing, especially if true imitation is no longer employed by adults. A test of imitation by Alexandra Horowitz<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Horowitz | first1 = Alexandra C. | year = 2003 | title = Do humans ape? or Do apes human?

Horowitz points out that the precise psychological state underlying imitation is unclear and cannot, by itself, be used to draw conclusions about the mental states of humans.\n\nWhile much research has been done on infants, theory of mind develops continuously throughout childhood and into late adolescence as the synapses (neuronal connections) in the prefrontal cortex develop. The prefrontal cortex is thought to be involved in planning and decision-making.<ref name=\"Laghi 2016 207\u2013216\">{{citation | last = Laghi | first = Fiorenzo | year = 2016 | title = The Role of Nice and Nasty Theory of Mind in Teacher-Selected Peer Models for Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders | journal = Measurement and Evaluation in Counseling and Development | volume = 49 | issue = 3 | pages = 207\u2013216 | doi = 10.1177/0748175615596784 | last2 = Lonigro | first2 = Antonia | last3 = Levanto | first3 = Simona | last4 = Ferraro | first4 = Maurizio | last5 = Baumgartner | first5 = Emma | last6 = Baiocco | first6 = Roberto }}</ref> Children seem to develop theory of mind skills sequentially. The first skill to develop is the ability to recognize that others have diverse desires. Children are able to recognize that others have diverse beliefs soon after. The next skill to develop is recognizing that others have access to different knowledge bases. Finally, children are able to understand that others may have '''false beliefs''' and that others are capable of hiding emotions. While this sequence represents the general trend in skill acquisition, it seems that more emphasis is placed on some skills in certain cultures, leading to more valued skills to develop before those that are considered not as important. For example, in individualistic cultures such as the United States, a greater emphasis is placed on the ability to recognize that others have different opinions and beliefs. In a collectivistic culture, such as China, this skill may not be as important and therefore may not develop until later.<ref>{{citation | last = Etel | first = Evren | year = 2015 | title = Social Competence, Theory of Mind, and Executive Function in Institution-reared Turkish Children | journal = International Journal of Behavioral Development | volume = 39 | issue = 6 | pages = 519\u2013529 | doi = 10.1177/0165025414556095 | last2 = Yagmurlu | first2 = Bilge }}</ref>\n\n===Language===\nThere is evidence to believe that the development of theory of mind is closely intertwined with language development in humans. One meta-analysis showed a moderate to strong correlation (''r'' = 0.43) between performance on theory of mind and language tasks.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Milligan|first=Karen|last2=Astington|first2=Janet Wilde|last3=Dack|first3=Lisa Ain | title = Language and theory of mind: meta-analysis of the relation between language ability and false-belief understanding | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 78 | issue = 2 | pages = 622&ndash;646 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01018.x | pmid = 17381794 | date = March\u2013April 2007 | ref = harv }}</ref> One might argue that this relationship is due solely to the fact that both language and theory of mind seem to begin to develop substantially around the same time in children (between ages 2\u20135). However, many other abilities develop during this same time period as well, and do not produce such high correlations with one another nor with theory of mind. There must be something else going on to explain the relationship between theory of mind and language.\n\nPragmatic theories of communication<ref>{{Cite book|title=Relevance : communication and cognition|last=Dan.|first=Sperber|date=2001|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|others=Wilson, Deirdre.|isbn=978-0631198789|edition=  2nd|location=Oxford|oclc=32589501}}</ref> assume that infants must possess an understanding of beliefs and mental states of others to infer the communicative content that proficient language users intend to convey. Since a verbal utterance is often underdetermined, and therefore, it can have different meanings depending on the actual context theory of mind abilities can play a crucial role in understanding the communicative and informative intentions of others and inferring the meaning of words. Some empirical results<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tauzin|first=Tibor|last2=Gergely|first2=Gy\u00f6rgy|date=2018-06-22|title=Communicative mind-reading in preverbal infants|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|pages=9534|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-27804-4|pmid=29934630|pmc=6015048|issn=2045-2322|bibcode=2018NatSR...8.9534T}}</ref> suggest that even 13-month-old infants have an early capacity for communicative mind-reading that enables them to infer what relevant information is transferred between communicative partners, which implies that human language relies at least partially on theory of mind skills.\n\nCarol A. Miller posed further possible explanations for this relationship. One idea was that the extent of verbal communication and conversation involving children in a family could explain theory of mind development. The belief is that this type of language exposure could help introduce a child to the different mental states and perspectives of others.<ref name=\"Miller child\">{{cite journal | last = Miller | first = Carol A. | title = Developmental relationships between language and theory of mind | journal = American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 142&ndash;154 | doi = 10.1044/1058-0360(2006/014) | pmid = 16782686 | date = May 2006 | ref = harv }} [https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/32501769/Miller_06_offprint.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&Expires=1508793985&Signature=CJF5VXW6%2B%2FaiCFjyDr%2FfqeLHkh8%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DA_What_Is_a_Theory_of_Mind.pdf Pdf.]{{dead link|date=November 2017}}</ref> This has been suggested empirically by findings indicating that participation in family discussion predict scores on theory of mind tasks,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ruffman | first1 = Ted | last2 = Slade | first2 = Lance | last3 = Crowe | first3 = Elena | title = The relation between children's and mothers' mental state language and theory-of-mind understanding | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 73 | issue = 3 | pages = 734&ndash;751 | doi = 10.1111/1467-8624.00435 | pmid = 12038548 | date = May\u2013June 2002 | ref = harv }} [https://web.psy.otago.ac.nz/pdfs/Ted%27s%20PDF%27s/2002ChiDev.pdf Pdf.]</ref> as well as findings showing that deaf children who have hearing parents and may not be able to communicate with their parents much during early years of development tend to score lower on theory of mind tasks.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Woolfe | first1 = Tyron | last2 = Want | first2 = Stephen C. | last3 = Siegal | first3 = Michael | title = Signposts to development: theory of mind in deaf children | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 73 | issue = 3 | pages = 768&ndash;778 | doi =  10.1111/1467-8624.00437| pmid = 12038550 | date = May\u2013June 2002 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.70.4337 }} [http://www.tyronwoolfe.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Signposts_Child_Development.pdf Pdf.]</ref>\n\nAnother explanation of the relationship between language and theory of mind development has to do with a child's understanding of mental state words such as \"''think''\" and \"''believe''\". Since a mental state is not something that one can observe from behavior, children must learn the meanings of words denoting mental states from verbal explanations alone, requiring knowledge of the syntactic rules, semantic systems, and pragmatics of a language.<ref name=\"Miller child\" /> Studies have shown that understanding of these mental state words predicts theory of mind in four-year-olds.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = Chris | last2 = Pure | first2 = Kiran | last3 = Furrow | first3 = David | title = Children's understanding of the modal expression of speaker certainty and uncertainty and its relation to the development of a representational theory of mind | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 722&ndash;730 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.1990.tb02815.x | pmid = 2364747 | jstor = 1130957 | date = June 1990 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nA third hypothesis is that the ability to distinguish a whole sentence (\"Jimmy thinks the world is flat\") from its embedded complement (\"the world is flat\") and understand that one can be true while the other can be false is related to theory of mind development. Recognizing these sentential complements as being independent of one another is a relatively complex syntactic skill and has been shown to be related to increased scores on theory of mind tasks in children.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = de Villiers | first1 = Jill G. | last2 = Pyers | first2 = Jennie E.  | title = Complements to cognition: a longitudinal study of the relationship between complex syntax and false-belief-understanding | journal = Cognitive Development | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 1037&ndash;1060 | doi = 10.1016/S0885-2014(02)00073-4 | date = January\u2013March 2002 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to these hypotheses, there is also evidence that the neural networks between the areas of the brain responsible for language and theory of mind are closely connected. The temporoparietal junction has been shown to be involved in the ability to acquire new vocabulary, as well as perceive and reproduce words. The temporoparietal junction also contains areas that specialize in recognizing faces, voices, and biological motion, in addition to theory of mind.

It is a challenging question, due to the difficulty of assessing what pre-linguistic children understand about others and the world.  Tasks used in research into the development of Theory of Mind must take into account the ''[[umwelt]]''\u2014(the German word ''Umwelt'' means \"environment\" or \"surrounding world\")\u2014of the pre-verbal child.{{clarify|date=November 2012}}\n\n=== False-belief task ===\n\nOne of the most important milestones in theory of mind development is the ability to attribute ''false belief'': in other words, the understanding that other people can believe things which are not true. To do this, it is suggested, one must understand how knowledge is formed, that people's beliefs are based on their knowledge, that mental states can differ from reality, and that people's behavior can be predicted by their mental states. Numerous versions of the false-belief task have been developed, based on the initial task created by Wimmer and Perner (1983).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wimmer | first1 = H. | last2 = Perner | first2 = J. | year = 1983 | title = Beliefs about beliefs: Representation and constraining function of wrong beliefs in young children's understanding of deception | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 103\u2013128 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(83)90004-5 | pmid = 6681741 }}</ref>\n\nIn the most common version of the false-belief task (often called the [[Sally\u2013Anne test|\"'Sally-Anne' test\"]] or \"'Sally-Anne' task\"), children are told or shown a story involving two characters. For example, the child is shown two dolls, Sally and Anne, who have a basket and a box, respectively. Sally also has a marble, which she places into her basket, and then leaves the room. While she is out of the room, Anne takes the marble from the basket and puts it into the box. Sally returns, and the child is then asked where Sally will look for the marble. The child passes the task if she answers that Sally will look in the basket, where Sally put the marble; the child fails the task if she answers that Sally will look in the box, where the child knows the marble is hidden, even though Sally cannot know this, since she did not see it hidden there. To pass the task, the child must be able to understand that another's mental representation of the situation is different from their own, and the child must be able to predict behavior based on that understanding.\n\nAnother example is when a boy leaves chocolate on a shelf and then leaves the room. His mother puts it in the fridge. To pass the task, the child must understand that the boy, upon returning, holds the false belief that his chocolate is still on the shelf.<ref name = Mitchell>{{citation | last = Mitchell | first = Peter | contribution =  Acquiring a theory of mind | editor-last1 = Slater | editor-first1 = Alan | editor-last2 = Bremner | editor-first2 = J.

In the \"Unexpected contents\", or \"Smarties\" task, experimenters ask children what they believe to be the contents of a box that looks as though it holds a candy called \"[[Smarties]]\". After the child guesses (usually) \"Smarties\", it is shown that the box in fact contained pencils. The experimenter then re-closes the box and asks the child what she thinks another person, who has not been shown the true contents of the box, will think is inside. The child passes the task if he/she responds that another person will think that \"Smarties\" exist in the box, but fails the task if she responds that another person will think that the box contains pencils.

The examiner asks the child two control questions: \"When we first took the picture, where was the object?\" and \"Where is the object now?\".  The subject is also asked a \"false-photograph\" question: \"Where is the object in the picture?\" The child passes the task if he/she correctly identifies the location of the object in the picture and the actual location of the object at the time of the question. However, the last question might be misinterpreted as: \"Where in this room is the object that the picture depicts?\" and therefore some examiners use an alternative phrasing.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nTo make it easier for animals, young children, and individuals with classical ([[Leo Kanner]]-type) [[autism]] to understand and perform theory of mind tasks, researchers have developed tests in which verbal communication is de-emphasized:  some whose administration does not involve verbal communication on the part of the examiner, some whose successful completion does not require verbal communication on the part of the subject, and some that meet both of the foregoing standards.  One category of tasks uses a preferential looking paradigm, with [[looking time]] as the dependent variable.

Therefore, their looking-times measures would give researchers an indication of what infants might be inferring, or their implicit understanding of events. One recent study using this paradigm found that 16-month-olds tend to attribute beliefs to a person whose visual perception was previously witnessed as being \"reliable\", compared to someone whose visual perception was \"unreliable\". Specifically, 16-month-olds were trained to expect a person's excited vocalization and gaze into a container to be associated with finding a toy in the reliable-looker condition or an absence of a toy in the unreliable-looker condition. Following this training phase, infants witnessed, in an object-search task, the same persons either searching for a toy in the correct or incorrect location after they both witnessed the location of where the toy was hidden.

A recent theory claims that Theory of Mind has its roots in two defensive reactions, namely immobilization stress and tonic immobility, which are implicated in the handling of stressful encounters and also figure prominently in mammalian childrearing practices (Tsoukalas, 2018).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s40806-017-0112-x |title=Theory of Mind: Towards an Evolutionary Theory |year=2018 |last=Tsoukalas |first=Ioannis |journal= Evolutionary Psychological Science | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 38\u201366|doi-access=free }}[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CCwSs2TrvPwwSU8rDyUkvtLYAuYfylMD/view?usp=sharing Pdf.]</ref> Their combined effect seems capable of producing many of the hallmarks of theory of mind, e.g., eye-contact, gaze-following, inhibitory control and intentional attributions.\n\n==Non-human==\n{{see also|Animal consciousness|Theory of mind in animals}}\n\nAn open question is whether other animals besides humans have a [[genetics|genetic]] endowment and [[social psychology|social]] environment that allows them to acquire a theory of mind in the same way that human children do.<ref name=\"Premack, D. G. 1978\"/> This is a contentious issue because of the problem of inferring from [[ethology|animal behavior]] the existence of [[thought|thinking]] or of particular thoughts, or the existence of a concept of [[self (psychology)|self]] or [[self-awareness]], [[consciousness]] and [[qualia]]. One difficulty with non-human studies of theory of mind is the lack of sufficient numbers of naturalistic observations, giving insight into what the evolutionary pressures might be on a species' development of theory of mind.\n\nNon-human research still has a major place in this field, however, and is especially useful in illuminating which nonverbal behaviors signify components of theory of mind, and in pointing to possible stepping points in the evolution of what many claim to be a uniquely human aspect of social cognition. While it is difficult to study human-like theory of mind and mental states in species whose potential mental states we have an incomplete understanding, researchers can focus on simpler components of more complex capabilities. For example, many researchers focus on animals' understanding of intention, gaze, perspective, or knowledge (or rather, what another being has seen). A study that looked at understanding of intention in orangutans, chimpanzees and children showed that all three species understood the difference between accidental and intentional acts.<ref name=\"Call, J. 1998\"/> Part of the difficulty in this line of research is that observed phenomena can often be explained as simple stimulus-response learning, as it is in the nature of any theorizers of mind to have to extrapolate internal mental states from observable behavior. Recently, most non-human theory of mind research has focused on monkeys and great apes, who are of most interest in the study of the evolution of human social cognition.

Different people may develop more, or less, effective theory of mind.

G. 1978\" /> The emerging field of [[social neuroscience]] has also begun to address this debate, by imaging the brains of humans while they perform tasks demanding the understanding of an intention, belief or other mental state in others.\n\nAn alternative account of theory of mind is given within [[Operant conditioning|operant]] psychology and provides significant [[empirical evidence]] for a functional account of both perspective-taking and empathy. The most developed operant approach is founded on research on derived relational responding and is subsumed within what is called [[relational frame theory]]. According to this view, empathy and perspective-taking comprise a complex set of derived relational abilities based on learning to discriminate and respond verbally to ever more complex relations between self, others, place, and time, and through established relations.<ref>Hayes, S.

Oakland, California: New Harbinger.</ref>\n\n==Philosophical and psychological roots==\nContemporary discussions of Theory of Mind have their roots in philosophical debate\u2014most broadly, from the time of [[Descartes]]' ''[[Second Meditation]]'', which set the groundwork for considering the science of the mind. Most prominent recently are two contrasting approaches in the philosophical literature, to theory of mind: [[theory-theory]] and [[simulation theory of empathy|simulation theory]]. The theory-theorist imagines a veritable theory\u2014\"folk psychology\"\u2014used to reason about others' minds. The theory is developed automatically and innately, though instantiated through social interactions.<ref>Carruthers, P. (1996). Simulation and self-knowledge: a defence of the theory-theory. In P. Carruthers & P.K. Smith, Eds. ''Theories of theories of mind.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>  It is also closely related to  [[Social perception|person perception]] and  [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution theory]] from [[social psychology]].\n\nThe intuitive assumption that others are minded is an apparent tendency we all share. We [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphize]] non-human animals, inanimate objects, and even natural phenomena. [[Daniel Dennett]] referred to this tendency as taking an \"[[intentional stance]]\" toward things: we assume they have intentions, to help predict future behavior.<ref>Dennett, D. (1987). The Intentional Stance. Cambridge: MIT Press.</ref> However, there is an important distinction between taking an \"intentional stance\" toward something and entering a \"shared world\" with it. The intentional stance is a detached and functional theory we resort to during interpersonal interactions. A shared world is directly perceived and its existence structures reality itself for the perceiver. It is not just automatically applied to perception; it in many ways constitutes perception.\n\nThe philosophical roots of the [[relational frame theory]] (RFT) account of Theory of Mind arise from contextual psychology and refer to the study of organisms (both human and non-human) interacting in and with an historical and current situational context. It is an approach based on [[contextualism]], a philosophy in which any event is interpreted as an ongoing act inseparable from its current and historical context and in which a radically functional approach to truth and meaning is adopted. As a variant of contextualism, RFT focuses on the construction of practical, scientific knowledge. This scientific form of contextual psychology is virtually synonymous with the philosophy of operant psychology.<ref>{{cite web | title=Functional Contextualism | publisher=Association for Contextual Behavioral Science | url=http://www.contextualpsychology.org/functional_contextualism_0 | first=Eric | last=Fox | accessdate=March 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\nThe study of which animals are capable of attributing knowledge and mental states to others, as well as the development of this ability in human [[ontogeny]] and [[phylogenetics|phylogeny]], has identified several behavioral precursors to theory of mind. Understanding attention, understanding of others' intentions, and imitative experience with other people are hallmarks of a theory of mind that may be observed early in the development of what later becomes a full-fledged theory. \n\n[[Simon Baron-Cohen]] proposed that infants' understanding of attention in others acts as a \"critical precursor\" to the development of theory of mind.<ref name=\"Baron-Cohen, S. 1991 pp. 233-251\" /> Understanding attention involves understanding that seeing can be directed selectively as attention, that the looker assesses the seen object as \"of interest\", and that seeing can induce beliefs. A possible illustration of theory of mind in infants is joint attention. Joint attention refers to when two people look at and attend to the same thing; parents often use the act of pointing to prompt infants to engage in joint attention. Understanding this prompt requires that infants take into account another person's mental state, understanding that the person notices an object or finds it of interest. {{anchor|protodeclarative}} Baron-Cohen speculates that the inclination to spontaneously reference an object in the world as of interest, via pointing, (\"protodeclarative pointing\") and to likewise appreciate the directed attention of another, may be the underlying motive behind all human communication.<ref name=\"Baron-Cohen, S. 1991 pp. 233-251\"/>\n\nUnderstanding of others' intentions is another critical precursor to understanding other minds because intentionality, or \"aboutness\", is a fundamental feature of mental states and events. The \"intentional stance\" has been defined by [[Daniel Dennett]]<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dennett | first1 = Daniel C. | year = 1987 | title = Reprint of Intentional systems in cognitive ethology: The Panglossian paradigm defended (to p. 260) | journal = The Brain and Behavioral Sciences | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 343\u2013390 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00016393}}</ref> as an understanding that others' actions are goal-directed and arise from particular beliefs or desires.

For example, the infant uses his own experiences, orienting his head/eyes toward an object of interest to understand the movements of others who turn toward an object, that is, that they will generally attend to objects of interest or significance. Some researchers in comparative disciplines have hesitated to put a too-ponderous weight on imitation as a critical precursor to advanced human social-cognitive skills like mentalizing and empathizing, especially if true imitation is no longer employed by adults.

The first skill to develop is the ability to recognize that others have diverse desires. Children are able to recognize that others have diverse beliefs soon after. The next skill to develop is recognizing that others have access to different knowledge bases. Finally, children are able to understand that others may have '''false beliefs''' and that others are capable of hiding emotions. While this sequence represents the general trend in skill acquisition, it seems that more emphasis is placed on some skills in certain cultures, leading to more valued skills to develop before those that are considered not as important. For example, in individualistic cultures such as the United States, a greater emphasis is placed on the ability to recognize that others have different opinions and beliefs. In a collectivistic culture, such as China, this skill may not be as important and therefore may not develop until later.<ref>{{citation | last = Etel | first = Evren | year = 2015 | title = Social Competence, Theory of Mind, and Executive Function in Institution-reared Turkish Children | journal = International Journal of Behavioral Development | volume = 39 | issue = 6 | pages = 519\u2013529 | doi = 10.1177/0165025414556095 | last2 = Yagmurlu | first2 = Bilge }}</ref>\n\n===Language===\nThere is evidence to believe that the development of theory of mind is closely intertwined with language development in humans.

However, many other abilities develop during this same time period as well, and do not produce such high correlations with one another nor with theory of mind. There must be something else going on to explain the relationship between theory of mind and language.\n\nPragmatic theories of communication<ref>{{Cite book|title=Relevance : communication and cognition|last=Dan.|first=Sperber|date=2001|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|others=Wilson, Deirdre.|isbn=978-0631198789|edition=  2nd|location=Oxford|oclc=32589501}}</ref> assume that infants must possess an understanding of beliefs and mental states of others to infer the communicative content that proficient language users intend to convey. Since a verbal utterance is often underdetermined, and therefore, it can have different meanings depending on the actual context theory of mind abilities can play a crucial role in understanding the communicative and informative intentions of others and inferring the meaning of words. Some empirical results<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tauzin|first=Tibor|last2=Gergely|first2=Gy\u00f6rgy|date=2018-06-22|title=Communicative mind-reading in preverbal infants|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|pages=9534|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-27804-4|pmid=29934630|pmc=6015048|issn=2045-2322|bibcode=2018NatSR...8.9534T}}</ref> suggest that even 13-month-old infants have an early capacity for communicative mind-reading that enables them to infer what relevant information is transferred between communicative partners, which implies that human language relies at least partially on theory of mind skills.\n\nCarol A. Miller posed further possible explanations for this relationship. One idea was that the extent of verbal communication and conversation involving children in a family could explain theory of mind development.

Since a mental state is not something that one can observe from behavior, children must learn the meanings of words denoting mental states from verbal explanations alone, requiring knowledge of the syntactic rules, semantic systems, and pragmatics of a language.<ref name=\"Miller child\" /> Studies have shown that understanding of these mental state words predicts theory of mind in four-year-olds.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = Chris | last2 = Pure | first2 = Kiran | last3 = Furrow | first3 = David | title = Children's understanding of the modal expression of speaker certainty and uncertainty and its relation to the development of a representational theory of mind | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 722&ndash;730 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.1990.tb02815.x | pmid = 2364747 | jstor = 1130957 | date = June 1990 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nA third hypothesis is that the ability to distinguish a whole sentence (\"Jimmy thinks the world is flat\") from its embedded complement (\"the world is flat\") and understand that one can be true while the other can be false is related to theory of mind development.

The temporoparietal junction has been shown to be involved in the ability to acquire new vocabulary, as well as perceive and reproduce words. The temporoparietal junction also contains areas that specialize in recognizing faces, voices, and biological motion, in addition to theory of mind. Since all of these areas are located so closely together, it is reasonable to conclude that they work together.

Numerous versions of the false-belief task have been developed, based on the initial task created by Wimmer and Perner (1983).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wimmer | first1 = H. | last2 = Perner | first2 = J. | year = 1983 | title = Beliefs about beliefs: Representation and constraining function of wrong beliefs in young children's understanding of deception | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 103\u2013128 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(83)90004-5 | pmid = 6681741 }}</ref>\n\nIn the most common version of the false-belief task (often called the [[Sally\u2013Anne test|\"'Sally-Anne' test\"]] or \"'Sally-Anne' task\"), children are told or shown a story involving two characters. For example, the child is shown two dolls, Sally and Anne, who have a basket and a box, respectively. Sally also has a marble, which she places into her basket, and then leaves the room. While she is out of the room, Anne takes the marble from the basket and puts it into the box. Sally returns, and the child is then asked where Sally will look for the marble. The child passes the task if she answers that Sally will look in the basket, where Sally put the marble; the child fails the task if she answers that Sally will look in the box, where the child knows the marble is hidden, even though Sally cannot know this, since she did not see it hidden there. To pass the task, the child must be able to understand that another's mental representation of the situation is different from their own, and the child must be able to predict behavior based on that understanding.\n\nAnother example is when a boy leaves chocolate on a shelf and then leaves the room. His mother puts it in the fridge. To pass the task, the child must understand that the boy, upon returning, holds the false belief that his chocolate is still on the shelf.<ref name = Mitchell>{{citation | last = Mitchell | first = Peter | contribution =  Acquiring a theory of mind | editor-last1 = Slater | editor-first1 = Alan | editor-last2 = Bremner | editor-first2 = J.

For instance, when they show [[hindsight bias]], defined as: \"the inclination to see events that have already happened as being more predictable than they were before they took place.\"<ref>Mitchell, P.

Also in experiments with complicated situations, when assessing others' thinking, adults can be unable to disregard certain information that they have been given.<ref name = Mitchell/>\n\n===Unexpected contents===\nOther tasks have been developed to try to solve the problems inherent in the false-belief task. In the \"Unexpected contents\", or \"Smarties\" task, experimenters ask children what they believe to be the contents of a box that looks as though it holds a candy called \"[[Smarties]]\". After the child guesses (usually) \"Smarties\", it is shown that the box in fact contained pencils. The experimenter then re-closes the box and asks the child what she thinks another person, who has not been shown the true contents of the box, will think is inside. The child passes the task if he/she responds that another person will think that \"Smarties\" exist in the box, but fails the task if she responds that another person will think that the box contains pencils.

While the photograph is developing, the examiner moves the object to a different location (''e.g.'', a blue cupboard), allowing the child to view the examiner's action.  The examiner asks the child two control questions: \"When we first took the picture, where was the object?\" and \"Where is the object now?\".  The subject is also asked a \"false-photograph\" question: \"Where is the object in the picture?\" The child passes the task if he/she correctly identifies the location of the object in the picture and the actual location of the object at the time of the question. However, the last question might be misinterpreted as: \"Where in this room is the object that the picture depicts?\" and therefore some examiners use an alternative phrasing.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nTo make it easier for animals, young children, and individuals with classical ([[Leo Kanner]]-type) [[autism]] to understand and perform theory of mind tasks, researchers have developed tests in which verbal communication is de-emphasized:  some whose administration does not involve verbal communication on the part of the examiner, some whose successful completion does not require verbal communication on the part of the subject, and some that meet both of the foregoing standards.  One category of tasks uses a preferential looking paradigm, with [[looking time]] as the dependent variable. For instance, 9-month-old infants prefer looking at behaviors performed by a human hand over those made by an inanimate hand-like object.<ref>Woodward, Infants selectively encode the goal object of an actor's reach, Cognition (1998)</ref> Other paradigms look at rates of imitative behavior, the ability to replicate and complete unfinished goal-directed acts,<ref name=\"Meltzoff, A. 1995\"/> and rates of pretend play.<ref name=\"Leslie, A.

Therefore, their looking-times measures would give researchers an indication of what infants might be inferring, or their implicit understanding of events. One recent study using this paradigm found that 16-month-olds tend to attribute beliefs to a person whose visual perception was previously witnessed as being \"reliable\", compared to someone whose visual perception was \"unreliable\". Specifically, 16-month-olds were trained to expect a person's excited vocalization and gaze into a container to be associated with finding a toy in the reliable-looker condition or an absence of a toy in the unreliable-looker condition. Following this training phase, infants witnessed, in an object-search task, the same persons either searching for a toy in the correct or incorrect location after they both witnessed the location of where the toy was hidden. Infants who experienced the reliable looker were surprised and therefore looked longer when the person searched for the toy in the incorrect location compared to the correct location. In contrast, the looking time for infants who experienced the unreliable looker did not differ for either search locations. These findings suggest that 16-month-old infants can differentially attribute beliefs about a toy's location based on the person's prior record of visual perception.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0016715 |title=The effect of a looker's past reliability on infants' reasoning about beliefs |year=2009 |last1=Poulin-Dubois |first1=Diane |last2=Chow |first2=Virginia |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=1576\u201382 |pmid=19899915|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d34efb3d2c99e90169a129bbcdee343b2f9dd6be }}</ref>\n\n==Deficits==\nThe theory of mind impairment describes a difficulty someone would have with perspective-taking.

This might explain why some autistic individuals show extreme deficits in both theory of mind and pretend play. However, Hobson proposes a social-affective justification,<ref>{{cite book | last = Hobson | first = R.P. | title = Autism and the development of mind | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum | location = Hillsdale, N.J. | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780863772399}}</ref> which suggests that with an autistic person, deficits in theory of mind result from a distortion in understanding and responding to emotions.  He suggests that typically developing human beings, unlike autistic individuals, are born with a set of skills (such as social referencing ability) that later lets them comprehend and react to other people's feelings.  Other scholars emphasize that autism involves a specific developmental delay, so that autistic children vary in their deficiencies, because they experience difficulty in different stages of growth. Very early setbacks can alter proper advancement of joint-attention behaviors, which may lead to a failure to form a full theory of mind.<ref name=\"Baron-Cohen, S. 1991\"/>\n\nIt has been speculated<ref name=\"Leslie, A.

While some research has suggested that some autistic populations are unable to attribute mental states to others,<ref name=\"Baron-Cohen, S. 1991 pp. 233-251\"/> recent evidence points to the possibility of coping mechanisms that facilitate a spectrum of mindful behavior.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dapretto | first1 = M. | year = 2006 | title = Understanding emotions in others: mirror neuron dysfunction in children with autism spectrum disorders | url = | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 28\u201330 | display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1038/nn1611 | pmid = 16327784 | last2 = Davies | first2 = M.

Selecting children with advanced theory of mind skills who use them in prosocial ways will theoretically make the program more effective.

Schizophrenia patients with [[negative symptoms]], such as lack of emotion, motivation, or speech, have the most impairment in theory of mind and are unable to represent the mental states of themselves and of others. Paranoid schizophrenic patients also perform poorly because they have difficulty accurately interpreting others' intentions.

However, it is possible that the observation of overlapping regions for representing beliefs and attentional reorienting may simply be due to adjacent, but distinct, neuronal populations that code for each. The resolution of typical fMRI studies may not be good enough to show that distinct/adjacent neuronal populations code for each of these processes. In a study following Decety and Mitchell, Saxe and colleagues used higher-resolution fMRI and showed that the peak of activation for attentional reorienting is approximately 6-10mm above the peak for representing beliefs.

However, because the study used only six subjects with autism, and because the spatial resolution of PET imaging is relatively poor, these results should be considered preliminary.\n\nA subsequent fMRI study scanned normally developing adults and adults with HFA while performing a \"reading the mind in the eyes\" task: viewing a photo of a human's eyes and choosing which of two adjectives better describes the person's mental state, versus a gender discrimination control.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Baron-Cohen | first1 = Simon | display-authors = etal | title = Social intelligence in the normal and autistic brain: an fMRI study | journal = [[European Journal of Neuroscience]] | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 1891&ndash;1898 | doi = 10.1046/j.1460-9568.1999.00621.x | pmid = 10336657 | date = June 1999 | ref = harv }}</ref>  The authors found activity in [[orbitofrontal cortex]], STS, and amygdala in normal subjects, and found no amygdala activation and abnormal STS activation in subjects with autism.\n\nA more recent PET study looked at brain activity in individuals with HFA and Asperger syndrome while viewing Heider-Simmel animations (see above) versus a random motion control.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Castelli  | year = 2002 | title = Autism, Asperger syndrome and brain mechanisms for the attribution of mental states to animated shapes | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 125 | issue = Pt 8| pages = 1839\u20131849 | display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awf189 | pmid = 12135974 | first1 = F | last2 = Frith | first2 = C | last3 = Happ\u00e9 | first3 = F | last4 = Frith | first4 = U | doi-access = free }}</ref>  In contrast to normally developing subjects, those with autism showed no STS or FFA activation, and significantly less mPFC and amygdala activation.  Activity in [[extrastriate cortex|extrastriate regions]] V3 and LO was identical across the two groups, suggesting intact lower-level visual processing in the subjects with autism.  The study also reported significantly less functional connectivity between STS and V3 in the autism group.  Note, however, that decreased temporal correlation between activity in STS and V3 would be expected simply from the lack of an evoked response in STS to intent-laden animations in subjects with autism. A more informative analysis would be to compute functional connectivity after regressing out evoked responses from all-time series.\n\nA subsequent study, using the incongruent/congruent gaze-shift paradigm described above, found that in high-functioning adults with autism, posterior STS (pSTS) activation was undifferentiated while they watched a human shift gaze toward a target and then toward adjacent empty space.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pelphrey  | year = 2005 | title = Neural basis of eye gaze processing deficits in autism | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 128 | issue = Pt 5| pages = 1038\u20131048 | display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awh404 | pmid = 15758039 | first1 = K.

This study also found a significant anticorrelation between STS activation in the incongruent-congruent contrast and social subscale score on the [[Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised]], but not scores on the other subscales.\n\nIn 2011, an fMRI study demonstrated that the right [[temporoparietal junction]] (rTPJ) of higher-functioning adults with autism was not more selectively activated for mentalizing judgments when compared to physical judgments about self and other.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=NeuroImage |year=2011 |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=1832\u20131838 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.02.067 |pmid=21356316 |vauthors=Lombardo MV, Chakrabarti B, Bullmore ET, MRC AIMS Consortium, Baron-Cohen S |title=Specialization of right temporo-parietal junction for mentalizing and its relation to social impairments in autism }}</ref>  rTPJ selectivity for mentalizing was also related to individual variation on clinical measures of social impairment: individuals whose rTPJ was increasingly more active for mentalizing compared to physical judgments were less socially impaired, while those who showed little to no difference in response to mentalizing or physical judgments were the most socially impaired. This evidence builds on work in typical development that suggests rTPJ is critical for representing mental state information, irrespective of whether it is about oneself or others.

While many theories make claims about its role in the development of human language and social cognition few of them specify in detail any evolutionary neurophysiological precursors. A recent theory claims that Theory of Mind has its roots in two defensive reactions, namely immobilization stress and tonic immobility, which are implicated in the handling of stressful encounters and also figure prominently in mammalian childrearing practices (Tsoukalas, 2018).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s40806-017-0112-x |title=Theory of Mind: Towards an Evolutionary Theory |year=2018 |last=Tsoukalas |first=Ioannis |journal= Evolutionary Psychological Science | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 38\u201366|doi-access=free }}[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CCwSs2TrvPwwSU8rDyUkvtLYAuYfylMD/view?usp=sharing Pdf.]</ref> Their combined effect seems capable of producing many of the hallmarks of theory of mind, e.g., eye-contact, gaze-following, inhibitory control and intentional attributions.\n\n==Non-human==\n{{see also|Animal consciousness|Theory of mind in animals}}\n\nAn open question is whether other animals besides humans have a [[genetics|genetic]] endowment and [[social psychology|social]] environment that allows them to acquire a theory of mind in the same way that human children do.<ref name=\"Premack, D. G. 1978\"/> This is a contentious issue because of the problem of inferring from [[ethology|animal behavior]] the existence of [[thought|thinking]] or of particular thoughts, or the existence of a concept of [[self (psychology)|self]] or [[self-awareness]], [[consciousness]] and [[qualia]]. One difficulty with non-human studies of theory of mind is the lack of sufficient numbers of naturalistic observations, giving insight into what the evolutionary pressures might be on a species' development of theory of mind.\n\nNon-human research still has a major place in this field, however, and is especially useful in illuminating which nonverbal behaviors signify components of theory of mind, and in pointing to possible stepping points in the evolution of what many claim to be a uniquely human aspect of social cognition. While it is difficult to study human-like theory of mind and mental states in species whose potential mental states we have an incomplete understanding, researchers can focus on simpler components of more complex capabilities. For example, many researchers focus on animals' understanding of intention, gaze, perspective, or knowledge (or rather, what another being has seen). A study that looked at understanding of intention in orangutans, chimpanzees and children showed that all three species understood the difference between accidental and intentional acts.<ref name=\"Call, J. 1998\"/> Part of the difficulty in this line of research is that observed phenomena can often be explained as simple stimulus-response learning, as it is in the nature of any theorizers of mind to have to extrapolate internal mental states from observable behavior. Recently, most non-human theory of mind research has focused on monkeys and great apes, who are of most interest in the study of the evolution of human social cognition.

Many games also offer economic challenges and exploration. They are generally categorized into four sub-types, depending on whether the game is '''turn-based or real-time''', and whether the game focuses on '''strategy or tactics'''.\n\n== Definition ==\nStrategy video games are a [[video game genre|genre]] of [[video game]] that emphasize skillful thinking and planning to achieve victory.<ref name=\"Rollings\"/> Specifically, a player must plan a series of actions against one or more opponents, and the reduction of enemy forces is usually a goal. Victory is achieved through superior planning, and the element of chance takes a smaller role.<ref name=\"fundamentals\">{{cite book|last=Rollings|first=Andrew|authorlink=|author2=Ernest Adams |title=Fundamentals of Game Design|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2006|location=|url=http://wps.prenhall.com/bp_gamedev_1/54/14053/3597646.cw/index.html}}</ref> In most strategy video games, the player is given a godlike view of the game world, and indirectly controls game units under their command.<ref name=\"Rollings\">{{cite book|last=Rollings|first=Andrew|authorlink=|author2=Ernest Adams |title=Andrew Rollings and Ernest Adams on Game Design|publisher=New Riders Publishing|year=2003|location=|pages=321\u2013345|url=http://safari.adobepress.com/1592730019/ch10|doi=|id=|isbn=1-59273-001-9}}</ref> Thus, most strategy games involve elements of warfare to varying degrees,<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/> and feature a combination of tactical and strategic considerations.<ref name=gamespystrategy/> In addition to combat, these games often challenge the player's ability to explore, or manage an economy.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/>\n\n=== Relationship to other genres ===\nEven though there are many [[action game]]s that involve strategic thinking, they are seldom classified as strategy games.<ref name=gamespystrategy>{{cite web | url = http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/february02/strategy1/index.shtm | author = Mark H. Walker | title = Strategy Gaming | publisher = GameSpy | date = 2002-02-01 | accessdate = 2008-12-28 }}</ref> A strategy game is typically larger in scope, and their main emphasis is on the player's ability to outthink their opponent.<ref name=gamespystrategy/> Strategy games rarely involve a physical challenge, and tend to annoy strategically minded players when they do.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/> Compared to other genres such as action or adventure games where one player takes on many enemies, strategy games usually involve some level of symmetry between sides. Each side generally has access to similar resources and actions, with the strengths and weaknesses of each side being generally balanced.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/>\n\nAlthough strategy games involve strategic, tactical, and sometimes logistical challenges, they are distinct from [[puzzle game]]s. A strategy game calls for planning around a conflict between players, whereas puzzle games call for planning in isolation. Strategy games are also distinct from [[construction and management simulation]]s, which include economic challenges without any fighting. These games may incorporate some amount of conflict, but are different from strategy games because they do not emphasize the need for direct action upon an opponent.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/>\n\nAlthough strategy games are similar to [[role-playing video game]]s in that the player must manage units with a variety of numeric attributes, RPGs tend to be about a smaller number of unique characters, while strategy games focus on larger numbers of fairly similar units.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/>\n\n==Game design==\n=== Units and conflict ===\n[[File:Globulation2 Building Camp.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Strategy games give players indirect control over many units in a battlefield. Many games, for example ''[[Globulation 2]]'', include other challenges such as building construction.]]\nThe player commands their forces by selecting a unit, usually by clicking it with the mouse, and issuing an order from a menu. Keyboard shortcuts become important for advanced players, as speed is often an important factor. Units can typically move, attack, stop, hold a position, although other strategy games offer more complex orders. Units may even have specialized abilities, such as the ability to become invisible to other units, usually balanced with abilities that detect otherwise invisible things. Some strategy games even offer special leader units that provide a bonus to other units. Units may also have the ability to sail or fly over otherwise impassable terrain, or provide transport for other units. Non-combat abilities often include the ability to repair or construct other units or buildings.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/>\n\nEven in imaginary or fantastic conflicts, strategy games try to reproduce important tactical situations throughout history. Techniques such as flanking, making diversions, or cutting supply lines may become integral parts of managing combat. Terrain becomes an important part of strategy, since units may gain or lose advantages based on the landscape. Some strategy games such as ''[[Civilization III]]'' and ''[[Medieval 2: Total War]]'' involve other forms of conflict such as diplomacy and espionage. However, warfare is the most common form of conflict, as game designers have found it difficult to make non-violent forms of conflict as appealing.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/>\n\n=== Economy, resources and upgrades ===\nStrategy games often involve other economic challenges.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/> These can include building construction, population maintenance,<ref name=gamespystrategy/> and resource management.<ref name=toddbarron>{{cite book | author = Todd Barron | title = Strategy Game Programming with DirectX 9 | publisher = Wordware Publishing, Inc. | year = 2003}}</ref> Strategy games frequently make use of a windowed interface to manage these complex challenges.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/>\n\nMost strategy games allow players to accumulate resources which can be converted to units, or converted to buildings such as factories that produce more units.  The quantity and types of resources vary from game to game. Some games will emphasize resource acquisition by scattering large quantities throughout the map, while other games will put more emphasis on how resources are managed and applied by balancing the availability of resources between players. To a lesser extent, some strategy games give players a fixed quantity of units at the start of the game.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/>\n\nStrategy games often allow the player to spend resources on upgrades or research. Some of these upgrades enhance the player's entire economy. Other upgrades apply to a unit or class of units, and unlock or enhance certain combat abilities.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/> Sometimes enhancements are enabled by building a structure that enables more advanced structures.<ref name=\"gamespotrts\">{{cite web | author = Bruce Geryk | title = A History of Real-Time Strategy Games - Dune II | publisher = GameSpot | url = http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/real_time/index.html | date = 2001-03-30 | accessdate = 2008-07-26}}</ref> Games with a large number of upgrades often feature a [[technology tree]],<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/> which is a series of advancements that players can research to unlock new units, buildings, and other capabilities.<ref name=toddbarron/><ref name=\"JoystiqSoaSEDesignerInterview\">{{cite web | url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/02/01/joystiq-interview-ironclad-talks-4x-strategy-with-sins-of-a-sol/ | title=Joystiq interview: Ironclad talks 4X strategy with Sins of a Solar Empire | author = Jason Dobson | date= 2008-02-01 | publisher = Joystiq | accessdate=2008-06-23 }}</ref> Technology trees are quite large in some games, and [[4X]] strategy games are known for having the largest.<ref name=\"JoystiqSoaSEDesignerInterview\"/><ref name=\"SOSEdistinct\">{{cite web | url= http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3157333 | publisher= 1UP.com | title= Sins of a Solar Empire Preview | author= Sean Molloy | accessdate= 2008-06-23 | url-status= dead | archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130101165613/http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3157333 | archivedate= 2013-01-01 }}</ref>\n\nA [[build order]] is a linear pattern of production, research, and resource management aimed at achieving a specific and specialized goal. They are analogous to [[chess opening]]s, in that a player will have a specific order of play in mind, however the amount the build order, the strategy around which the build order is built or even which build order is then used varies on the skill, ability and other factors such as how aggressive or defensive each player is.\n\n=== Map and exploration ===\nEarly strategy games featured a top-down perspective, similar in nature to a board game or paper map. Many later games adopted an isometric perspective. Even with the rise of 3D graphics and the potential to manipulate the camera, games usually feature some kind of aerial view. Very rarely do strategy games show the world from the perspective from an avatar on the ground. This is to provide the player with a big picture view of the game world, and form more effective strategies.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/>\n\nExploration is a key element in most strategy games. The landscape is often shrouded in darkness, and this darkness is lifted as a player's units enters the area. The ability to explore may be inhibited by different kinds of terrain, such as hills, water, or other obstructions. Even after an area is explored, that area may become dim if the player does not patrol it. This design technique is called the [[fog of war]], where the player can see the terrain but not the units within the explored area. This makes it possible for enemies to attack unexpectedly from otherwise explored areas.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/>\n\n=== Real-time versus turn-based ===\n[[File:Bos wars 2 5.png|thumb|228x228px|''[[Bos Wars]]'' is a [[real-time strategy]] game, where events unfold continuously.]]\nStrategy video games are categorized based on whether they offer the continuous gameplay of [[real-time strategy]], or the discrete phases of [[turn-based strategy]].<ref name=gamespystrategy/><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.apple.com/games/gettingstarted/strategy/ | title = Strategy Games | publisher = Apple | accessdate = 2008-12-28 }}</ref> These differences in time-keeping lead to several other differences. Typically, turn-based strategy games have stronger artificial intelligence than real-time strategy games, since the turn-based pace allows more time for complex calculations. But a real-time artificial intelligence makes up for this disadvantage with its ability to manage multiple units more quickly than a human.<ref name=gamespystrategy/> Overall, real-time strategy games are more action-oriented, as opposed to the abstract planning emphasized in turn-based strategy.<ref name=gamespystrategy/>\n\nThe relative popularity of real-time strategy has led some critics to conclude that more gamers prefer action-oriented games.<ref name=gamespystrategy/> Fans of real-time strategy have criticized the wait times associated with turn-based games,<ref name=\"strategyplanet\">{{cite web | url = http://www.strategyplanet.com/features/articles/pcp-turnvsreal/ | publisher = IGN | author = Strategy Planet | title = Point -

The term was first coined by [[Alan Emrich]] in his September 1993 preview of ''[[Master of Orion]]'' for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]''. Since then, others have adopted the term to describe games of similar scope and [[video game design|design]].\n\n4X games are noted for their deep, complex [[gameplay]]. Emphasis is placed upon economic and technological development, as well as a range of non-military routes to supremacy. Many 4X games also fit into the category of [[grand strategy wargame|grand strategy]]. Games can take a long time to complete since the amount of [[micromanagement (computer gaming)|micromanagement]] needed to sustain an empire scales as the empire grows. 4X games are sometimes criticized for becoming tedious for these reasons, and several games have attempted to address these concerns by limiting micromanagement.\n\nThe earliest 4X games borrowed ideas from [[board game]]s and 1970s [[Text-based (computing)|text-based]] computer games. The first 4X games were [[turn-based]], but [[real-time strategy|real-time]] 4X games are also not uncommon. Many 4X games were published in the mid-1990s, but were later outsold by other types of strategy games. [[Sid Meier]]'s ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'' and the [[Total War series]] are important examples from this formative era, and popularized the level of detail that would later become a staple of the genre. In the new 2000 millennium, several 4X releases have become critically and commercially successful.\n\n=== Artillery ===\n{{main|Artillery game}}\n[[File:Scorched 3D 40.1 screenshot 2.jpg|thumb|''[[Scorched 3D]]'' is an artillery game.|223x223px]]\n'''Artillery''' is the generic name for either early two- or three-player (usually [[turn-based]]) [[Video game|computer games]] involving [[tank]]s fighting each other in combat or similar derivative games.

The objective is to destroy the opposing team's main structure with the assistance of computer-controlled units, which periodically [[Spawning (gaming)|spawn]] in groups at the base and marching down predefined paths (called \"lanes\") toward the enemy base. Every [[player character]] typically has its own diverse kit with unique abilities, design, strengths, and weaknesses. Player characters grow in power over the course of a match and learn new thematic abilities, which contribute to a team's overall strategy. Multiplayer online battle arena games are a fusion of [[real-time strategy games]], [[role-playing video game|role-playing games]], and [[Action game|action games]], though players usually do not construct either buildings or units. \n\nThe genre gained popularity in the 2010s, with ''[[Defense of the Ancients]]'' mod for ''[[Warcraft III]]'', ''[[League of Legends]]'', ''[[Dota 2]]'', ''[[Heroes of the Storm]]'', and ''[[Smite (video game)|Smite]]'' being popular.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.progamerreview.com/best-moba-games/|title=Best Modern MOBA Games - LoL, Dota 2, HotS & Smite Compared|last=Amstrup|first=Johannes|last2=ersen|date=2017-09-15|website=Pro Gamer Reviews|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-19}}</ref> MOBA games are also well-represented in [[esports]] with the prize pools of over 60 million dollars in 2018, which is about 40% of the total esports prize pools in the same year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/konvoy/esports-prize-pools-155-9m-2018-ce1ff44bd41|title=Esports Prize Pools: $155.9M (2018)|last=Hurst|first=Taylor|date=2019-02-12|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Real-time strategy (RTS) ===\n{{Main|Real-time strategy}}\nUsually applied only to certain computer strategy games, the moniker '''real-time strategy''' ('''RTS''') indicates that the action in the game is continuous, and players will have to make their decisions and actions within the backdrop of a constantly changing game state, and computer real-time strategy gameplay is characterised by obtaining resources, building bases, researching technologies and producing units. Very few non-computer strategy games are real-time; one example is [[Icehouse (game)|Icehouse]].\n\nSome players dispute the importance of strategy in real-time strategy games, as skill and manual dexterity are often seen as the deciding factor in this genre of game. According to Troy Dunniway, \"A player controls hundreds of units, dozens of buildings and many different events that are all happening simultaneously. There is only one player, and he can only pay attention to one thing at a time. Expert players can quickly flip between many different tasks, while casual gamers have more problems with this.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dunniwaydesign.com/rts_design.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927142342/http://www.dunniwaydesign.com/rts_design.htm |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}</ref> Ernest Adams goes so far as to suggest that real-time gameplay interferes with strategy. \"Strategic thinking, at least in the arena of gameplay, does not lend itself well to real-time action\".<ref name=\"Rollings\"/>\n\nMany strategy players claim that many RTS games really should be labeled as \"real-time tactical\" (RTT) games since the game play revolves entirely around tactics, with little or even no strategy involved. Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOG or MMO) in particular have had a difficult time implementing strategy since having strategy implies some mechanism for \"winning\". MMO games, by their nature, are typically designed to be never-ending. Nevertheless, some games are attempting to \"crack the code,\" so-to-speak, of the true real-time strategy MMOG.<ref>Allen 'Delsyn' Rausch (2008-08-15) [http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/beyond-protocol/899486p1.html \"Beyond Protocol (PC)\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416044137/http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/beyond-protocol/899486p1.html |date=2009-04-16 }} Gamespy. Retrieved on 2009-04-10.</ref> One method by which they are doing so is by making defenses stronger than the weapons, thereby slowing down combat considerably and making it possible for players to more carefully consider their actions during a confrontation. Customizable units are another way of adding strategic elements, as long as players are truly able to influence the capabilities of their units. The industry is seeking to present new candidates worthy of being known for \"thought strategy\" rather than \"dexterity strategy\".\n\nWhile ''[[Herzog Zwei]]'' is regarded as the first true [[Real-time strategy|RTS]] game,<ref name=zzap/> the defining title for the genre was [[Westwood Studios]]'s ''[[Dune II]]'', which was followed by their seminal ''[[Command & Conquer (series)|Command & Conquer]]'' games. Cavedog's ''[[Total Annihilation]]'' (1997), [[Blizzard Entertainment|Blizzard]]'s ''[[Warcraft]]'' (1994) series, ''[[StarCraft]]'' (1998) series, and [[Ensemble Studios]]' ''[[Age of Empires]]'' (1997) series are some of the most popular RTS games. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} In addition, online games such as ''[[NukeZone]]'' can be considered belonging in this genre as well.\n\n=== MMORTS ===\n{{Main|Massively multiplayer online real-time strategy game}}\n[[Massively multiplayer online real-time strategy game]]s, also known as '''MMORTS''', combine [[real-time strategy]] (RTS) with a [[persistent world]]. Players often assume the role of a general, king, or other type of figurehead leading an army into battle while maintaining the resources needed for such warfare. The titles are often based in a [[sci-fi]] or [[fantasy]] universe and are distinguished from single or small-scale multiplayer RTS games by the number of players and common use of a [[persistent world]], generally hosted by the game's publisher, which continues to evolve even when the player is offline.\n\n=== Real-time tactics (RTT) ===\n{{Main|Real-time tactics}}\n'''Real-time tactics''' (abbreviated '''RTT'''<ref name=\"ign-stateoftherts\">{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/700/700747p3.html|title=The State of the RTS|work=[[IGN]]|date=7 April 2006|accessdate=14 September 2006}}(Article at IGN discussing their perception of RTS and related genres as of 2006.

It is also sometimes considered a subgenre of [[real-time strategy]], and thus may in this context exist as an element of gameplay or as a basis for the whole game. It is differentiated from [[real-time strategy]] gameplay by the lack of resource [[micromanagement]] and base or unit building, as well as the greater importance of individual units<ref name=\"ign-stateoftherts\"/><ref name=splanet>{{cite web | title =Point - CounterPoint: Resource Collection vs. Fixed Units | publisher =StrategyPlanet | url =http://www.strategyplanet.com/features/articles/pcp-resources/ | accessdate =2007-11-04 | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071231194439/http://www.strategyplanet.com/features/articles/pcp-resources/ | archivedate =2007-12-31 }}</ref> and a focus on complex battlefield tactics. Example titles include ''[[Warhammer: Dark Omen]]'', ''[[World In Conflict]]'', the ''[[Close Combat (game)|Close Combat]]'' series, and early [[tactical role-playing game]]s such as ''[[Bokosuka Wars]]'', ''[[Kure Software Koubou|Silver Ghost]]'', and ''[[First Queen]]''.\n\n=== Tower defense ===\n{{Main|Tower defense}}\n'''Tower defense''' games have a very simple layout. Usually, computer-controlled monsters called ''creeps'' move along a set path, and the player must place, or \"build\" towers along this path to kill the creeps. In some games, towers are placed along a set path for creeps, while in others towers can interrupt creep movement and change their path. In most tower defense games different towers have different abilities such as poisoning enemies or slowing them down. The player is awarded money for killing creeps, and this money can be used to buy more towers, or buy upgrades for a tower such as increased power or range.\n\n=== Turn-based strategy (TBS) ===\n{{Main|Turn-based strategy}}\n[[File:Battle for Wesnoth 0.8.5 chaotic indexed.png|thumb|''[[The Battle for Wesnoth]]'' is a turn-based strategy game.|234x234px]]\nThe term '''turn-based strategy''' ('''TBS''') is usually reserved for certain computer strategy games, to distinguish them from real-time computer strategy games. A player of a turn-based game is allowed a period of analysis before committing to a game action. Examples of this genre are the ''[[Civilization computer game|Civilization]]'', ''[[Heroes of Might and Magic]]'', ''[[Making History (game)|Making History]], [[Advance Wars]]'', ''[[Master of Orion]]'' and [http://atwar-game.com/ AtWar].\n\nTBS games come in two flavors, differentiated by whether players make their plays simultaneously or take turns. The former types of games are called simultaneously executed TBS games, with ''[[Diplomacy (game)|Diplomacy]]'' a notable example. The latter games fall into the player-alternated TBS games category, and are subsequently subdivided into (a) ranked, (b) round-robin start, and (c) random, the difference being the order under which players take their turns. With (a), ranked, the players take their turns in the same order every time.  With (b), the first player is selected according to a [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] policy.  With (c), [[random]], the first player is, of course, randomly selected.\n\nAlmost all non-computer strategy games are turn-based; however, the [[personal computer game]] market trend has lately inclined more towards real-time games. Some recent games feature a mix of both real-time and [[turn-based]] elements thrown together.\n\n=== Turn-based tactics (TBT) ===\n{{Main|Turn-based tactics}}\n'''Turn-based tactics'''<ref name=ign_ss>{{cite web | last =Butts | first =Steve | title =Silent Storm Review | publisher =IGN | date =January 27, 2004 | url =http://pc.ign.com/articles/475/475977p1.html | accessdate =2007-11-25  }}</ref><ref name=gamespot_pt>{{cite web | last =Ocampo | first =Jason | title =E3 06: Panzer Tactics DS | publisher =[[GameSpot]] | date =May 12, 2006 | url =http://www.gamespot.com/ds/strategy/panzertactics/news.html?sid=6151193 | accessdate =2007-11-25  }}</ref> ('''TBT'''), or '''tactical turn-based'''<ref name=gamespot_bl>{{cite web | title =Battle Lord | publisher =[[GameSpot]] | url =http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/battlelord/index.html# | accessdate =2007-11-25 | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071020114411/http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/battlelord/index.html | archivedate =2007-10-20 | url-status =dead }}</ref> ('''TTB'''), is a genre of strategy video games that through stop-action simulates the considerations and circumstances of [[operational warfare]] and [[military tactics]] in generally small-scale confrontations as opposed to more strategic considerations of [[turn-based strategy]] (TBS) games.\n\nTurn-based tactical gameplay is characterized by the expectation of players to complete their tasks using only the combat forces provided to them, and usually by the provision of a realistic (or at least believable) representation of military tactics and operations. Examples of this genre include the ''[[Wars (series)|Wars]]'' and ''[[X-COM]]'' series, as well as [[tactical role-playing game]]s such as the ''[[Jagged Alliance (series)]]'', ''[[Fire Emblem series]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]''.\n\n=== Wargames ===\n{{Main|Wargame (video games)}}\n'''Wargames''' are a [[subgenre]] of strategy video games that emphasize strategic or tactical warfare on a map, as well as historical (or near-historical) accuracy.<ref name=gspy_sg>{{cite web | last = Walker | first = Mark H. | title = Strategy Gaming: Part III -- Strategy Gaming | publisher = [[GameSpy]] | date = February 2002 | url = http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/february02/strategygames3/index2.shtm | accessdate = 2009-06-28 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110525152349/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/february02/strategygames3/index2.shtm | archivedate = 2011-05-25 }}</ref>\n\nThe primary gameplay mode in a wargame is usually tactical: fighting battles. Wargames sometimes have a strategic mode where players may plan their battle or choose an area to conquer, but players typically spend much less time in this mode and more time actually fighting.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/> Because it is difficult to provide an intelligent way to delegate tasks to a subordinate, war games typically keep the number of units down to hundreds rather than hundreds of thousands.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/>\n\nExamples of wargames include [[Koei]]'s ''[[Nobunaga's Ambition]]'' and ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms (video game series)|Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' series, and several titles by [[Strategic Simulations, Inc.]] (SSI) and [[Strategic Studies Group]] (SSG).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of real-time strategy video games]]\n* [[Build order]]\n* [[Micromanagement (computer gaming)]]\n* [[Rush (computer and video games)]]\n* [[Technology tree]]\n* [[Turtle (game term)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Strategy video games}}\n\n{{VideoGameGenre}}\n\n[[Category:Video game genres]]\n[[Category:Strategy video games| ]]\n\n[[da:Strategispil]]\n", "text_old": "{{VG Strategy}}\nA '''strategy video game''' is a [[Video game genres|video game genre]] that focuses on skillful thinking and planning to achieve victory.<ref name=\"Rollings\"/> It emphasizes strategic, tactical, and sometimes logistical challenges.

Walker | title = Strategy Gaming | publisher = GameSpy | date = 2002-02-01 | accessdate = 2008-12-28 }}</ref> A strategy game is typically larger in scope, and their main emphasis is on the player's ability to outthink their opponent.<ref name=gamespystrategy/> Strategy games rarely involve a physical challenge, and tend to annoy strategically minded players when they do.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/> Compared to other genres such as action or adventure games where one player takes on many enemies, strategy games usually involve some level of symmetry between sides. Each side generally has access to similar resources and actions, with the strengths and weaknesses of each side being generally balanced.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/>\n\nAlthough strategy games involve strategic, tactical, and sometimes logistical challenges, they are distinct from [[puzzle game]]s. A strategy game calls for planning around a conflict between players, whereas puzzle games call for planning in isolation. Strategy games are also distinct from [[construction and management simulation]]s, which include economic challenges without any fighting. These games may incorporate some amount of conflict, but are different from strategy games because they do not emphasize the need for direct action upon an opponent.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/>\n\nAlthough strategy games are similar to [[role-playing video game]]s in that the player must manage units with a variety of numeric attributes, RPGs tend to be about a smaller number of unique characters, while strategy games focus on larger numbers of fairly similar units.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/>\n\n==Game design==\n=== Units and conflict ===\n[[File:Globulation2 Building Camp.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Strategy games give players indirect control over many units in a battlefield. Many games, for example ''[[Globulation 2]]'', include other challenges such as building construction.]]\nThe player commands their forces by selecting a unit, usually by clicking it with the mouse, and issuing an order from a menu. Keyboard shortcuts become important for advanced players, as speed is often an important factor. Units can typically move, attack, stop, hold a position, although other strategy games offer more complex orders. Units may even have specialized abilities, such as the ability to become invisible to other units, usually balanced with abilities that detect otherwise invisible things. Some strategy games even offer special leader units that provide a bonus to other units. Units may also have the ability to sail or fly over otherwise impassable terrain, or provide transport for other units. Non-combat abilities often include the ability to repair or construct other units or buildings.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/>\n\nEven in imaginary or fantastic conflicts, strategy games try to reproduce important tactical situations throughout history. Techniques such as flanking, making diversions, or cutting supply lines may become integral parts of managing combat. Terrain becomes an important part of strategy, since units may gain or lose advantages based on the landscape. Some strategy games such as ''[[Civilization III]]'' and ''[[Medieval 2: Total War]]'' involve other forms of conflict such as diplomacy and espionage. However, warfare is the most common form of conflict, as game designers have found it difficult to make non-violent forms of conflict as appealing.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/>\n\n=== Economy, resources and upgrades ===\nStrategy games often involve other economic challenges.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/> These can include building construction, population maintenance,<ref name=gamespystrategy/> and resource management.<ref name=toddbarron>{{cite book | author = Todd Barron | title = Strategy Game Programming with DirectX 9 | publisher = Wordware Publishing, Inc. | year = 2003}}</ref> Strategy games frequently make use of a windowed interface to manage these complex challenges.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/>\n\nMost strategy games allow players to accumulate resources which can be converted to units, or converted to buildings such as factories that produce more units.  The quantity and types of resources vary from game to game. Some games will emphasize resource acquisition by scattering large quantities throughout the map, while other games will put more emphasis on how resources are managed and applied by balancing the availability of resources between players. To a lesser extent, some strategy games give players a fixed quantity of units at the start of the game.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/>\n\nStrategy games often allow the player to spend resources on upgrades or research. Some of these upgrades enhance the player's entire economy. Other upgrades apply to a unit or class of units, and unlock or enhance certain combat abilities.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/> Sometimes enhancements are enabled by building a structure that enables more advanced structures.<ref name=\"gamespotrts\">{{cite web | author = Bruce Geryk | title = A History of Real-Time Strategy Games - Dune II | publisher = GameSpot | url = http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/real_time/index.html | date = 2001-03-30 | accessdate = 2008-07-26}}</ref> Games with a large number of upgrades often feature a [[technology tree]],<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/> which is a series of advancements that players can research to unlock new units, buildings, and other capabilities.<ref name=toddbarron/><ref name=\"JoystiqSoaSEDesignerInterview\">{{cite web | url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/02/01/joystiq-interview-ironclad-talks-4x-strategy-with-sins-of-a-sol/ | title=Joystiq interview: Ironclad talks 4X strategy with Sins of a Solar Empire | author = Jason Dobson | date= 2008-02-01 | publisher = Joystiq | accessdate=2008-06-23 }}</ref> Technology trees are quite large in some games, and [[4X]] strategy games are known for having the largest.<ref name=\"JoystiqSoaSEDesignerInterview\"/><ref name=\"SOSEdistinct\">{{cite web | url= http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3157333 | publisher= 1UP.com | title= Sins of a Solar Empire Preview | author= Sean Molloy | accessdate= 2008-06-23 | url-status= dead | archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130101165613/http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3157333 | archivedate= 2013-01-01 }}</ref>\n\nA [[build order]] is a linear pattern of production, research, and resource management aimed at achieving a specific and specialized goal. They are analogous to [[chess opening]]s, in that a player will have a specific order of play in mind, however the amount the build order, the strategy around which the build order is built or even which build order is then used varies on the skill, ability and other factors such as how aggressive or defensive each player is.\n\n=== Map and exploration ===\nEarly strategy games featured a top-down perspective, similar in nature to a board game or paper map. Many later games adopted an isometric perspective. Even with the rise of 3D graphics and the potential to manipulate the camera, games usually feature some kind of aerial view. Very rarely do strategy games show the world from the perspective from an avatar on the ground. This is to provide the player with a big picture view of the game world, and form more effective strategies.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/>\n\nExploration is a key element in most strategy games. The landscape is often shrouded in darkness, and this darkness is lifted as a player's units enters the area. The ability to explore may be inhibited by different kinds of terrain, such as hills, water, or other obstructions. Even after an area is explored, that area may become dim if the player does not patrol it. This design technique is called the [[fog of war]], where the player can see the terrain but not the units within the explored area. This makes it possible for enemies to attack unexpectedly from otherwise explored areas.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/>\n\n=== Real-time versus turn-based ===\n[[File:Bos wars 2 5.png|thumb|228x228px|''[[Bos Wars]]'' is a [[real-time strategy]] game, where events unfold continuously.]]\nStrategy video games are categorized based on whether they offer the continuous gameplay of [[real-time strategy]], or the discrete phases of [[turn-based strategy]].<ref name=gamespystrategy/><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.apple.com/games/gettingstarted/strategy/ | title = Strategy Games | publisher = Apple | accessdate = 2008-12-28 }}</ref> These differences in time-keeping lead to several other differences.

The term was first coined by [[Alan Emrich]] in his September 1993 preview of ''[[Master of Orion]]'' for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]''. Since then, others have adopted the term to describe games of similar scope and [[video game design|design]].\n\n4X games are noted for their deep, complex [[gameplay]]. Emphasis is placed upon economic and technological development, as well as a range of non-military routes to supremacy. Many 4X games also fit into the category of [[grand strategy wargame|grand strategy]]. Games can take a long time to complete since the amount of [[micromanagement (computer gaming)|micromanagement]] needed to sustain an empire scales as the empire grows. 4X games are sometimes criticized for becoming tedious for these reasons, and several games have attempted to address these concerns by limiting micromanagement.\n\nThe earliest 4X games borrowed ideas from [[board game]]s and 1970s [[Text-based (computing)|text-based]] computer games. The first 4X games were [[turn-based]], but [[real-time strategy|real-time]] 4X games are also not uncommon. Many 4X games were published in the mid-1990s, but were later outsold by other types of strategy games. [[Sid Meier]]'s ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'' and the [[Total War series]] are important examples from this formative era, and popularized the level of detail that would later become a staple of the genre.

Multiplayer online battle arena games are a fusion of [[real-time strategy games]], [[role-playing video game|role-playing games]], and [[Action game|action games]], though players usually do not construct either buildings or units. \n\nThe genre gained popularity in the 2010s, with ''[[Defense of the Ancients]]'' mod for ''[[Warcraft III]]'', ''[[League of Legends]]'', ''[[Dota 2]]'', ''[[Heroes of the Storm]]'', and ''[[Smite (video game)|Smite]]'' being popular.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.progamerreview.com/best-moba-games/|title=Best Modern MOBA Games - LoL, Dota 2, HotS & Smite Compared|last=Amstrup|first=Johannes|last2=ersen|date=2017-09-15|website=Pro Gamer Reviews|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-19}}</ref> MOBA games are also well-represented in [[esports]] with the prize pool of over 60 million dollars in 2018, which is about 40% of the total esports prize pools in the same year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/konvoy/esports-prize-pools-155-9m-2018-ce1ff44bd41|title=Esports Prize Pools: $155.9M (2018)|last=Hurst|first=Taylor|date=2019-02-12|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Real-time strategy (RTS) ===\n{{Main|Real-time strategy}}\nUsually applied only to certain computer strategy games, the moniker '''real-time strategy''' ('''RTS''') indicates that the action in the game is continuous, and players will have to make their decisions and actions within the backdrop of a constantly changing game state, and computer real-time strategy gameplay is characterised by obtaining resources, building bases, researching technologies and producing units. Very few non-computer strategy games are real-time; one example is [[Icehouse (game)|Icehouse]].\n\nSome players dispute the importance of strategy in real-time strategy games, as skill and manual dexterity are often seen as the deciding factor in this genre of game. According to Troy Dunniway, \"A player controls hundreds of units, dozens of buildings and many different events that are all happening simultaneously. There is only one player, and he can only pay attention to one thing at a time. Expert players can quickly flip between many different tasks, while casual gamers have more problems with this.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dunniwaydesign.com/rts_design.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927142342/http://www.dunniwaydesign.com/rts_design.htm |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}</ref> Ernest Adams goes so far as to suggest that real-time gameplay interferes with strategy. \"Strategic thinking, at least in the arena of gameplay, does not lend itself well to real-time action\".<ref name=\"Rollings\"/>\n\nMany strategy players claim that many RTS games really should be labeled as \"real-time tactical\" (RTT) games since the game play revolves entirely around tactics, with little or even no strategy involved. Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOG or MMO) in particular have had a difficult time implementing strategy since having strategy implies some mechanism for \"winning\". MMO games, by their nature, are typically designed to be never-ending. Nevertheless, some games are attempting to \"crack the code,\" so-to-speak, of the true real-time strategy MMOG.<ref>Allen 'Delsyn' Rausch (2008-08-15) [http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/beyond-protocol/899486p1.html \"Beyond Protocol (PC)\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416044137/http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/beyond-protocol/899486p1.html |date=2009-04-16 }} Gamespy. Retrieved on 2009-04-10.</ref> One method by which they are doing so is by making defenses stronger than the weapons, thereby slowing down combat considerably and making it possible for players to more carefully consider their actions during a confrontation. Customizable units are another way of adding strategic elements, as long as players are truly able to influence the capabilities of their units. The industry is seeking to present new candidates worthy of being known for \"thought strategy\" rather than \"dexterity strategy\".\n\nWhile ''[[Herzog Zwei]]'' is regarded as the first true [[Real-time strategy|RTS]] game,<ref name=zzap/> the defining title for the genre was [[Westwood Studios]]'s ''[[Dune II]]'', which was followed by their seminal ''[[Command & Conquer (series)|Command & Conquer]]'' games. Cavedog's ''[[Total Annihilation]]'' (1997), [[Blizzard Entertainment|Blizzard]]'s ''[[Warcraft]]'' (1994) series, ''[[StarCraft]]'' (1998) series, and [[Ensemble Studios]]' ''[[Age of Empires]]'' (1997) series are some of the most popular RTS games. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} In addition, online games such as ''[[NukeZone]]'' can be considered belonging in this genre as well.\n\n=== MMORTS ===\n{{Main|Massively multiplayer online real-time strategy game}}\n[[Massively multiplayer online real-time strategy game]]s, also known as '''MMORTS''', combine [[real-time strategy]] (RTS) with a [[persistent world]]. Players often assume the role of a general, king, or other type of figurehead leading an army into battle while maintaining the resources needed for such warfare. The titles are often based in a [[sci-fi]] or [[fantasy]] universe and are distinguished from single or small-scale multiplayer RTS games by the number of players and common use of a [[persistent world]], generally hosted by the game's publisher, which continues to evolve even when the player is offline.\n\n=== Real-time tactics (RTT) ===\n{{Main|Real-time tactics}}\n'''Real-time tactics''' (abbreviated '''RTT'''<ref name=\"ign-stateoftherts\">{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/700/700747p3.html|title=The State of the RTS|work=[[IGN]]|date=7 April 2006|accessdate=14 September 2006}}(Article at IGN discussing their perception of RTS and related genres as of 2006.

It is also sometimes considered a subgenre of [[real-time strategy]], and thus may in this context exist as an element of gameplay or as a basis for the whole game. It is differentiated from [[real-time strategy]] gameplay by the lack of resource [[micromanagement]] and base or unit building, as well as the greater importance of individual units<ref name=\"ign-stateoftherts\"/><ref name=splanet>{{cite web | title =Point - CounterPoint: Resource Collection vs. Fixed Units | publisher =StrategyPlanet | url =http://www.strategyplanet.com/features/articles/pcp-resources/ | accessdate =2007-11-04 | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071231194439/http://www.strategyplanet.com/features/articles/pcp-resources/ | archivedate =2007-12-31 }}</ref> and a focus on complex battlefield tactics. Example titles include ''[[Warhammer: Dark Omen]]'', ''[[World In Conflict]]'', the ''[[Close Combat (game)|Close Combat]]'' series, and early [[tactical role-playing game]]s such as ''[[Bokosuka Wars]]'', ''[[Kure Software Koubou|Silver Ghost]]'', and ''[[First Queen]]''.\n\n=== Tower defense ===\n{{Main|Tower defense}}\n'''Tower defense''' games have a very simple layout. Usually, computer-controlled monsters called ''creeps'' move along a set path, and the player must place, or \"build\" towers along this path to kill the creeps. In some games, towers are placed along a set path for creeps, while in others towers can interrupt creep movement and change their path. In most tower defense games different towers have different abilities such as poisoning enemies or slowing them down. The player is awarded money for killing creeps, and this money can be used to buy more towers, or buy upgrades for a tower such as increased power or range.\n\n=== Turn-based strategy (TBS) ===\n{{Main|Turn-based strategy}}\n[[File:Battle for Wesnoth 0.8.5 chaotic indexed.png|thumb|''[[The Battle for Wesnoth]]'' is a turn-based strategy game.|234x234px]]\nThe term '''turn-based strategy''' ('''TBS''') is usually reserved for certain computer strategy games, to distinguish them from real-time computer strategy games. A player of a turn-based game is allowed a period of analysis before committing to a game action. Examples of this genre are the ''[[Civilization computer game|Civilization]]'', ''[[Heroes of Might and Magic]]'', ''[[Making History (game)|Making History]], [[Advance Wars]]'', ''[[Master of Orion]]'' and [http://atwar-game.com/ AtWar].\n\nTBS games come in two flavors, differentiated by whether players make their plays simultaneously or take turns. The former types of games are called simultaneously executed TBS games, with ''[[Diplomacy (game)|Diplomacy]]'' a notable example. The latter games fall into the player-alternated TBS games category, and are subsequently subdivided into (a) ranked, (b) round-robin start, and (c) random, the difference being the order under which players take their turns. With (a), ranked, the players take their turns in the same order every time.  With (b), the first player is selected according to a [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] policy.  With (c), [[random]], the first player is, of course, randomly selected.\n\nAlmost all non-computer strategy games are turn-based; however, the [[personal computer game]] market trend has lately inclined more towards real-time games. Some recent games feature a mix of both real-time and [[turn-based]] elements thrown together.\n\n=== Turn-based tactics (TBT) ===\n{{Main|Turn-based tactics}}\n'''Turn-based tactics'''<ref name=ign_ss>{{cite web | last =Butts | first =Steve | title =Silent Storm Review | publisher =IGN | date =January 27, 2004 | url =http://pc.ign.com/articles/475/475977p1.html | accessdate =2007-11-25  }}</ref><ref name=gamespot_pt>{{cite web | last =Ocampo | first =Jason | title =E3 06: Panzer Tactics DS | publisher =[[GameSpot]] | date =May 12, 2006 | url =http://www.gamespot.com/ds/strategy/panzertactics/news.html?sid=6151193 | accessdate =2007-11-25  }}</ref> ('''TBT'''), or '''tactical turn-based'''<ref name=gamespot_bl>{{cite web | title =Battle Lord | publisher =[[GameSpot]] | url =http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/battlelord/index.html# | accessdate =2007-11-25 | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071020114411/http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/battlelord/index.html | archivedate =2007-10-20 | url-status =dead }}</ref> ('''TTB'''), is a genre of strategy video games that through stop-action simulates the considerations and circumstances of [[operational warfare]] and [[military tactics]] in generally small-scale confrontations as opposed to more strategic considerations of [[turn-based strategy]] (TBS) games.\n\nTurn-based tactical gameplay is characterized by the expectation of players to complete their tasks using only the combat forces provided to them, and usually by the provision of a realistic (or at least believable) representation of military tactics and operations. Examples of this genre include the ''[[Wars (series)|Wars]]'' and ''[[X-COM]]'' series, as well as [[tactical role-playing game]]s such as the ''[[Jagged Alliance (series)]]'', ''[[Fire Emblem series]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]''.\n\n=== Wargames ===\n{{Main|Wargame (video games)}}\n'''Wargames''' are a [[subgenre]] of strategy video games that emphasize strategic or tactical warfare on a map, as well as historical (or near-historical) accuracy.<ref name=gspy_sg>{{cite web | last = Walker | first = Mark H. | title = Strategy Gaming: Part III -- Strategy Gaming | publisher = [[GameSpy]] | date = February 2002 | url = http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/february02/strategygames3/index2.shtm | accessdate = 2009-06-28 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110525152349/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/february02/strategygames3/index2.shtm | archivedate = 2011-05-25 }}</ref>\n\nThe primary gameplay mode in a wargame is usually tactical: fighting battles. Wargames sometimes have a strategic mode where players may plan their battle or choose an area to conquer, but players typically spend much less time in this mode and more time actually fighting.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/> Because it is difficult to provide an intelligent way to delegate tasks to a subordinate, war games typically keep the number of units down to hundreds rather than hundreds of thousands.<ref name=\"fundamentals\"/>\n\nExamples of wargames include [[Koei]]'s ''[[Nobunaga's Ambition]]'' and ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms (video game series)|Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' series, and several titles by [[Strategic Simulations, Inc.]] (SSI) and [[Strategic Studies Group]] (SSG).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of real-time strategy video games]]\n* [[Build order]]\n* [[Micromanagement (computer gaming)]]\n* [[Rush (computer and video games)]]\n* [[Technology tree]]\n* [[Turtle (game term)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Strategy video games}}\n\n{{VideoGameGenre}}\n\n[[Category:Video game genres]]\n[[Category:Strategy video games| ]]\n\n[[da:Strategispil]]\n", "name_user": "EchoBlu", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMultiplayer online battle arena (MOBA)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_video_game"}

The Shiga toxin causes inflammatory responses in target cells of the gut, leaving behind lesions which result in the bloody diarrhea that is a symptom of a [[Shigatoxigenic and verotoxigenic Escherichia coli|Shiga toxin-producing ''E. coli'']] (STEC) infection. This toxin further causes premature destruction of the red blood cells, which then clog the body's filtering system, the kidneys, in some rare cases (usually in children and the elderly) causing [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]] (HUS), which may lead to kidney failure and even death. Signs of hemolytic uremic syndrome include decreased frequency of urination, lethargy, and paleness of cheeks and inside the lower eyelids. In 25% of HUS patients, complications of nervous system occur, which in turn causes [[stroke]]s.  In addition, this strain causes the buildup of fluid (since the kidneys do not work), leading to [[edema]] around the lungs and legs and arms.  This increase in fluid buildup especially around the lungs impedes the functioning of the heart, causing an increase in blood pressure.<ref>\"''E. coli'' Food Poisoning.\" About. N.p., n.d.

The Shiga toxin causes inflammatory responses in target cells of the gut, leaving behind lesions which result in the bloody diarrhea that is a symptom of a [[Shigatoxigenic and verotoxigenic Escherichia coli|Shiga toxin-producing ''E. coli'']] (STEC) infection. This toxin further causes premature destruction of the red blood cells, which then clog the body's filtering system, the kidneys, in some rare cases (usually in children and the elderly) causing [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]] (HUS), which may lead to kidney failure and even death. Signs of hemolytic uremic syndrome include decreased frequency of urination, lethargy, and paleness of cheeks and inside the lower eyelids. In 25% of HUS patients, complications of nervous system occur, which in turn causes [[stroke]]s.  In addition, this strain causes the buildup of fluid (since the kidneys do not work), leading to [[edema]] around the lungs and legs and arms.

Video game genres are not usually defined by the [[Setting (narrative)|setting]] or [[Narrative|story]] of the game or its medium of play, but by the way the player interacts with the game.<ref name=\"adams2013-c3s1\">{{harvnb|Adams|2013|loc=ch. 3 \u00a7 1}}.</ref> For example; a [[first-person shooter]] is still a first-person shooter regardless of whether it takes place in a [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], or [[Military fiction|military]] setting; so long as it features a camera mimicking the perspective of the protagonist ([[First-person (gaming)|first-person]]) and gameplay centered around the use of [[ranged weapon]]ry.\n\nGenres may encompass a wide variety of games, leading to even more specific classifications called ''subgenres''. For example, an [[action game]] can be classified into many subgenres such as [[platform game]]s and [[fighting game]]s. Some games, most notably [[browser game|browser]] and [[mobile game|mobile]] games, are commonly classified into multiple genres.<ref name=\"adams2013-c3s1\" /><ref name=\"adams2013-c3s2\">{{harvnb|Adams|2013|loc=ch. 3 \u00a7 2}}.</ref>\n\nThe following is a list of all commonly defined video game genres, with short descriptions for individual genres and major subgenres.\n\n== Action ==\n{{Main|Action game}}Action games emphasize physical challenges that require [[Hand-eye coordination|hand-eye coordination]] and [[motor skill]] to overcome. They center around the player, who is in control of most of the action. Most of the earliest video games were considered action games; today, it is still a vast genre covering all games that involve physical challenges.\n\nAction games are classified by many subgenres. [[Platform games]] and [[fighting games]] are among the best-known subgenres, while [[shooter games]] became and continue to be one of the dominant genres in video gaming since the 1990s.<ref name=\"adams2014\">{{harvnb|Adams|2014}}.</ref>{{sfn|Wolf|2012|p=572}} Action games usually involve elements of [[twitch gameplay]].<ref name=\"adams2014\" />\n\n=== Platform games ===\n{{Main|Platform game}}\n[[File:FEZ trial gameplay HD.webm|thumb|Platform games feature vertical environments with leaping and climbing between platforms, hence the name ''platform game''.|205x205px]]\nPlatform games (or ''platformers'') have gameplay primarily centered around jumping and climbing to navigate the character's environment. They may have enemies or obstacles to avoid and fight or may just be pure jumping puzzles. Generally the player's character in a platform game is able to jump many times their own height and player is offered some control over their movement in midair as well as the height and distance of their jumps.<ref name=\"adams2013-c3s2\" /> Settings tend to be vertically exaggerated with lots of uneven terrain that the player can leap to or fall off of.\n\n''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' was one of the earliest and best-known platformers; the American gaming press classified it using the term ''climbing game'' at the time.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Player's Guide to Climbing Games|journal=Electronic Games|date=January 1983|volume=1|issue=11|page=49|url=https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_11_1983-01_Reese_Communications_US#page/n47/mode/2up|access-date=December 12, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319134356/https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_11_1983-01_Reese_Communications_US#page/n47/mode/2up|archive-date=March 19, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' was one of the best-selling games of all time, with more than 40 million copies sold.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamecubicle.com/features-mario-units_sold_sales.htm |title=Mario Sales Data |access-date=December 12, 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65RQRdS8T?url=http://www.gamecubicle.com/features-mario-units_sold_sales.htm |archive-date=February 14, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Shooter games ===\n{{main|Shooter game}}\n[[File:Freedoom 0.9 MAP07.png|thumb|This picture shows gameplay of a freely licensed version of ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', a highly influential first-person shooter.|205x205px]]\nIn shooter games (or simply ''shooters''), players use ranged weapons to participate in the action, which takes place at a distance.<ref name=\"adams2013-c3s2\" /> Most shooters involve violent gameplay; lethal weaponry is used to damage opponents. However, some shooters, such as ''[[Splatoon]]'', have non-violent objectives.\n\nShooters, aside from subgenre classifications, can be further classified by their perspective of play. [[First-person shooter]]s are played within the [[protagonist]]'s perspective; they often include a heads-up display displaying key information such as the current [[Health (gaming)|health]] of the protagonist.{{sfn|Call|Whitlock|Voorhees|2012|p=5}}<ref name=\"adams2015p39\">{{harvnb|Adams|2015|p=39}}.</ref> In [[third-person shooter]]s, the protagonist's body can be seen fully; the environment is rendered from a distance.<ref name=\"adams2015p39\" /> Some shooters incorporate both perspectives.<ref name=\"adams2013-c3s2\" />\n\n[[Hero shooter]]s are either first- or third-person multiplayer shooters that strongly encourage [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative play]] between players on a single team through the use of pre-designed hero characters that each possess unique attributes, skills, weapons, and other passive and active abilities. While setting up a match, players on a team typically must each select a hero who is different from those selected by teammates and, as the match progresses, the players gain experience to unlock more powerful abilities for their hero. Outside of a match, players have the ability to customize the appearance of the heroes but with no other in-game effects. Hero shooters are inspired by the [[multiplayer online battle arena]] genre, and popular team-based shooters like ''[[Team Fortress 2]]''. Examples of hero shooters include ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'', ''[[Paladins (video game)|Paladins]]'', and ''[[Apex Legends]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/271933/Hero_Shooters_Charting_the_rebirth_of_a_genre.php|title=Hero Shooters: Charting the (re)birth of a genre|last=Wawro|first=Alex|date=May 6, 2016|work=[[Gamasutra]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507142751/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/271933/Hero_Shooters_Charting_the_rebirth_of_a_genre.php|archive-date=May 7, 2016|accessdate=May 6, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thegamer.com/overwatch-2-hero-shooter/|title=Overwatch 2 And The Future Of The Hero Shooter|date=2019-07-26|website=TheGamer|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n\n[[Light gun shooter]]s are controlled with a gun-shaped controller; light guns function via a light sensor, hence the name \"light gun\".

Most fighting games feature a large number of playable characters and a competitive multiplayer mode. While most fighting games emphasize hand-to-hand combat,<ref name=\"adams2013-c3s2\" /> some fighting games such as ''[[Soulcalibur]]'' and ''[[Samurai Shodown]]'' center around combat with melee weapons. Many fighting games incorporate heavily emphasized attacks based on various [[martial arts]] systems. Fighting games were one of the dominant genres in video gaming until the late-1990s, where the genre saw a slight decline. This decline was short lived however, for titles such as ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'', ''[[Street Fighter]]'', and ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' dominate the fighter demographic of the modern era.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dunn|first1=Jeff|title=Of Fists and Fatalities: The history of fighting games|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/fists-and-fatalities-history-fighting-games/|website=Gamesradar|accessdate=November 14, 2015|date=2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222211857/http://www.gamesradar.com/fists-and-fatalities-history-fighting-games/|archive-date=December 22, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Different sub-genre games are starting to become more popular though. ''Super Smash Bros.'', and its deviation from the traditional fighting game rule set is on of these games that has gained a large following because of its \"fun over form\" party game development mentality.\n\n=== Beat 'em up games ===\n{{Main|Beat 'em up}}\n[[Beat 'em ups]] (or ''brawlers'') are a related, but distinct genre to fighting games. While they both involve close-range combat, beat 'em ups put players against large waves of opponents as opposed to a few.<ref name=\"adams2013-c3s2\" /><ref name=\"rogers2014\" /> Beat 'em ups often incorporate mechanics from other action genres and multiplayer in beat 'em up games tends to be [[Cooperative gameplay|co-operative]] rather than competitive.

In a Stealth game, players are usually still able to engage in loud, conspicuous combat, but are often punished for it. Other games, such as ''[[Dishonored]]'', the player can obtain their goal with or without stealth, but stealth is encouraged as the player is at a disadvantage over many of their enemies. The inclusion of stealth as a mechanic in a game does not necessarily make it a Stealth Game. For example, ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim|Skyrim]]'' has an entire perk tree dedicated to \"Sneaking\", but there are few opportunities to use it effectively until the player invests dozens of perks into it, and most of the dungeons in the game are set up in favor of the hack-and-slash strategy that most players adopt.{{original research inline|date=October 2017}}\n\nThe first stealth game was ''Manbiki Shounen'' (''Shoplifting Boy''), published in November 1979.<ref>{{cite book |last=Szczepaniak |first=John |year=2014 |title=The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers |publisher=SMG Szczepaniak |volume=1 |page=7 |isbn=978-0-9929260-3-8 |quote=First ever stealth game, ''Manbiki Shounen''}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/japandvd/japandvd.htm|title=The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers BOOK|website=Hardcore Gaming 101|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908102842/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/japandvd/japandvd.htm|archivedate=2016-09-08}}</ref> The [[PET 2001]] [[personal computer game]] was developed by Hiroshi Suzuki.<ref>{{cite book |last=Szczepaniak |first=John |year=2014 |title=The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers |publisher=SMG Szczepaniak |volume=1 |pages=604\u2013605 |isbn=978-0-9929260-3-8 |quote=SUZUKI, Hiroshi ...

Many are set in procedurally-generated environments, and are open-ended with no set goals. They may overlap with the [[survival horror]] genre, in which the player must survive within a supernatural setting, such as a zombie apocalypse.\n\n=== Battle Royale ===\n{{main|Battle royale game}}\nA battle royale game is a genre that blends the survival, exploration and scavenging elements of a [[survival game]] with [[Last man standing (gaming)|last man standing]] gameplay. Battle royale games challenge a large number of players, starting with minimal equipment, to search for weapons and armor and eliminate other opponents, while trying to stay in safe playable area which shrinks as the time passes, with the winner being the last competitor in the game. Notable battle royale games include ''[[PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds]]'', ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'', ''[[Apex Legends]],'' and ''[[Call of Duty: Warzone]],'' each having received tens of millions of players within months of their releases.\n\n=== Rhythm games ===\n{{main|Rhythm game}}\n[[File:Fretsonfire4.png|thumb|230x230px|''[[Frets on Fire]]'' is a music game.|alt=]]\n'''Rhythm game'''&nbsp;or&nbsp;'''rhythm action'''&nbsp;is a&nbsp;genre&nbsp;of&nbsp;[[Music video game|music-themed]]&nbsp;[[Action game|action video game]]&nbsp;that challenges a player's sense of rhythm.&nbsp;The genre includes dance games such as&nbsp;''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]''&nbsp;and music-based games such as&nbsp;''[[Donkey Konga]]''&nbsp;and&nbsp;''[[Guitar Hero]]''. Games in the genre challenge the player to press buttons at precise times: the screen shows which button the player is required to press, and the game awards points both for accuracy and for synchronization with the beat.\n\n''[[PaRappa the Rapper]]''&nbsp;has been deemed the first influential rhythm game; whose basic template formed the core of subsequent games in the genre. Other popular rhythm games include ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'', [[Maimai (video game)|''Maimai'']], [[Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA|''Project Diva'']], ''[[Cytus]]'', [[Love Live! School Idol Festival|''Love Live: School Idol Festival'']], ''[[The Idolmaster]]'', ''[[osu!]]'', ''[[Taiko no Tatsujin]]'', ''[[Crypt of the Necrodancer]]'', ''[[Rhythm Heaven]]'', etc.\n\n== Action-adventure ==\n{{main|Action-adventure game}}\n\n[[Action-adventure game]]s combine elements of their two component genres, typically featuring long-term obstacles that must be overcome using a tool or item as leverage (which is collected earlier), as well as many smaller obstacles almost constantly in the way, that require elements of action games to overcome. Action-adventure games tend to focus on exploration and usually involve item gathering, simple puzzle solving, and combat. \"Action-adventure\" has become a label which is sometimes attached to games which do not fit neatly into another well known genre. Because of their prevalence on [[video game console]]s and the absence of typical [[adventure game]]s, action-adventure games are often called \"adventure games\" by modern gamers.\n\nOne of the first action-adventure games was the [[Atari 2600]] game ''[[Adventure (Atari 2600)|Adventure]]'' (1980). It was directly inspired by the original [[text adventure]], ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]''. In the process of adapting a text game to a console with only a joystick for control, designer [[Warren Robinett]] created an action-adventure game by incorporating action [[arcade game]] elements.\n\nThe action-adventure later became an established genre with [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]'s ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' (1986), which became a success due to how it combined elements from different genres to create a compelling hybrid, including exploration, [[transport puzzle]]s, adventure-style inventory [[Puzzle game|puzzles]], an action component, a monetary system, and simplified RPG-style level building without the [[experience points]].<ref>{{Cite web |author=Travis Fahs |url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/939/939361p1.html |title=IGN Presents the History of Zelda - Retro Feature at IGN |publisher=Uk.retro.ign.com |date=2010-08-27 |accessdate=2011-01-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602072944/http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/939/939361p1.html |archive-date=June 2, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> The game was also an early example of [[open world]], [[non-linear]] gameplay, and introduced innovations like [[Save file|saving]] on battery backup.

One crucial [[gameplay]] element in many of these games is the low quantity of ammunition, or number of breakable [[melee weapons]]. Notable examples include ''[[Silent Hill]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil]]''.\n\n''[[Nostromo]]'' was the first survival horror game, developed by Akira Takiguchi, a [[Tokyo University]] student and [[Taito]] contractor, for the [[PET 2001]]. It was ported to the [[PC-6001]] by Masakuni Mitsuhashi (also known as Hiromi Ohba, later joined [[Game Arts]]), and published by [[ASCII Corporation|ASCII]] in 1981, exclusively for Japan.<ref>{{cite book |last=Szczepaniak |first=John |year=2014 |title=The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers |publisher=SMG Szczepaniak |volume=1 |pages=544\u2013573 |isbn=978-0-9929260-3-8 }}</ref>\n\n=== Metroidvania ===\n[[Metroidvania]] games are a subgenre of Platformer (named after its two first well-known franchises, ''[[Metroid]]'' and ''[[Castlevania]]'') that feature large interconnected world maps the player can explore, but access to parts of the world is limited by doors or other obstacles that can only be opened after the player has acquired special tools, weapons or abilities within the game. Acquiring such improvements also aids the player in defeating more difficult enemies and locating shortcuts and secret areas, and often includes retracing one's steps across the map. Metroidvanias usually do not consist of any linear gameplay and often involve lots of backtracking - especially after new powerups or tools have been obtained. Bossfights are also a staple of metroidvanias, without which they would be considered puzzle or adventure games {{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}.\n\n== Adventure ==\n{{main|Adventure game}}\n\n[[Adventure game]]s were some of the earliest games created, beginning with the text adventure ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'' in the 1970s. That game was originally titled simply \"Adventure,\" and is the namesake of the genre. Over time, graphics have been introduced to the genre and the interface has evolved.\n\nUnlike adventure films, adventure games are not defined by story or content. Rather, adventure describes a manner of gameplay without reflex challenges or action. They normally require the player to solve various puzzles by interacting with people or the environment, most often in a non-confrontational way. It is considered a \"purist\" genre and tends to exclude anything which includes action elements beyond a [[mini game]].\n\nBecause they put little pressure on the player in the form of action-based challenges or time constraints, adventure games have had the unique ability to appeal to people who do not normally play video games. The genre peaked in popularity with the 1993 release of ''[[Myst]]'', the best-selling PC game of all time up to that point.<ref name=\"best-selling\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/simslivinlarge/news_2857556.html |title=The Sims overtakes Myst |accessdate=2008-03-17 |author=Walker, Trey |date=2002-03-22 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5mVievash?url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/simslivinlarge/news_2857556.html |archive-date=January 3, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> The simple point and click interface, detailed worlds and casual pace made it accessible, and its sense of artistic surrealism caused news outlets such as ''[[Wired Magazine]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', and the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' to declare that the gaming industry had matured.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rothstein, Edward|date=1994-12-04|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E7DD1030F937A35751C1A962958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1|title=A New Art Form May Arise From the 'Myst'|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-03-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115195423/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/04/arts/a-new-art-form-may-arise-from-the-myst.html|archive-date=January 15, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Evenson, Laura|publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|title=Interactive CD-ROMs come of age|date=1994-12-22|page=DAT36}}</ref> It had four proper sequels, but none managed to experience the same level of success. The success of ''Myst'' also inspired many others to create similar games with first person perspectives, surreal environments and minimal or no dialogue, but these neither recaptured the success of ''Myst'' nor of earlier personality-driven adventures.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nIn the late 1990s the genre suffered a large drop in popularity, mass-market releases became rare, and many proclaimed the adventure game to be dead. More accurately, it has become a niche genre. Adventure games are not entirely uncommon, but they tend to be very low budget in anticipation of modest sales. The genre was somewhat rejuvenated with the release of ''[[The Longest Journey]]'' in 1999, which emphasized stronger story elements and more interaction with different characters. A recent resurgence of adventure games on Nintendo consoles might signify a new interest in the genre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20070205/nixon_01.shtml|title=Bring Out Your Dead!

The game produced as a result was mired in controversy and production delays, and to some, signalled the true end of the genre outside of niche markets.\n\n=== Text adventures ===\n\nThe earliest adventure games were text adventures, also known as [[interactive fiction]]. Games such as the popular ''[[Zork]]'' series of the late 1970s and early 1980s allowed the player to use a keyboard to enter commands such as \"get rope\" or \"go west\" while the computer describes what is happening. A great deal of programming went into [[text parser|parsing]] the player's text input.\n\n=== Graphic adventures ===\n\n[[File:Mystery House - Apple II render emulation - 2.png|thumb|250px|right|''[[Mystery House]]'' for the [[Apple II family|Apple II]] was the first adventure game to use graphics in the early [[home computer]] era.]]\n[[Graphic adventure game]]s emerged as graphics became more common. Adventure games began to supplement and later on replace textual descriptions with visuals (for example, a picture of the current location). Early graphic adventure games used text-parsers to input commands. The growing use of [[computer mouse|mice]] led to the \"[[point-and-click]]\" genre of adventure games, where the player would no longer have to type commands. The player could, for example, click on a hand [[icon (computing)|icon]] and then on a rope to pick up the rope.\n\n=== Visual novels ===\n{{main|visual novel}}\n\nA {{Nihongo|[[visual novel]]|\u30d3\u30b8\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u30ce\u30d9\u30eb|bijuaru noberu}} is a game featuring mostly static graphics, usually with [[anime]]-style art. As the name might suggest, they resemble mixed-media novels or [[tableau vivant]] stage plays. Many visual novels track statistics that the player must build in order to advance the plot, and permit a variety of endings, allowing more dynamic reactions to the player's actions than a typical linear adventure plot. Many visual novels are dating sims, including [[bish\u014djo game]]s. Visual novels are especially prevalent in [[Japan]], where they make up nearly 70% of PC games released.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2009-01-23 |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/pressrelease.php?id=1510 |title=AMN and Anime Advanced Announce Anime Game Demo Downloads |publisher=Anime News Network |date=2006-02-08}}</ref> They are rarely produced for video game consoles, but the more popular games are sometimes [[Porting|ported]] to systems such as the [[Dreamcast]] or the [[PlayStation 2]]. The market for visual novels outside Japan, however, was nearly non-existent prior to the success of the [[Nintendo DS]], for which several Japanese visual novels were released in the West, such as the ''[[Ace Attorney]]'' series.\n\n=== Interactive movie ===\n\nThe [[interactive movie]] genre came about with the invention of [[laserdisc]]s. An interactive movie contains pre-filmed [[full motion video|full-motion]] [[cartoon]]s or live-action sequences, where the player controls some of the moves of the main character. For example, when in danger, the player decides which move, action, or combination to choose. In these games, the only activity the player has is to choose or guess the move the [[game designer|designers]] intend him to make. Interactive movies usually differ from games that simply use [[Full motion video based game|full motion video]], FMV, extensively between scenes in that they try to integrate it into the gameplay itself. This has been used in everything from racing games to fighting games. A few adventure game have tried to use the term to liken the storytelling of their games to those in movies, most notably the later ''[[Tex Murphy]]'' games and the more recent ''[[Fahrenheit (2005 video game)|Fahrenheit (Indigo Prophecy)]]'',<ref name=\"1up\">{{cite web|accessdate=2009-01-23 |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&cId=3143998 |title=Indigo Prophecy\u2013Developer's Diary |publisher=1UP |date=2005-09-22 |author=Cage, David |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513025716/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&cId=3143998 |archivedate=2013-05-13 }}</ref> although they are more aptly classified as genre hybrids. Elements of interactive movies have been adapted for game [[cut scene]]s, in the form of [[Quick Time Event]]s, to keep the player alert. Games like ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' present obvious in-game prompts for the player to react to. Not doing so usually results in the player character either getting hurt or outright killed.\n\n=== Real-time 3D adventures ===\n\nAround this time, real-time 3D adventure games appeared. These included ''[[Nightfall (video game)|Nightfall]]'' in 1998, ''[[Shenmue]]'' in 1999, ''[[Myst|realMyst]]'' in 2000, ''[[Shadow of Memories]]'' in 2001, and ''[[Uru: Ages Beyond Myst]]'' in 2003. They augmented traditional adventure gameplay with some of the attributes more commonly associated with action games. For example, freedom of motion and physics-based behavior.\n\n== Role-playing ==\n{{main|Role-playing video game}}\n{{see also|History of role-playing video games}}\n[[File:KQ-hitpoints.png|thumb|right|''KQ'' is a role-playing game]]\n\n[[Role-playing video game]]s draw their gameplay from traditional [not always] [[role-playing game]]s like ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''. Most of these games cast the player in the role of one or more \"adventurers\" who specialize in specific skill sets (such as melee combat or ranged [[Magic (gaming)|magic]] spells) while progressing through a predetermined storyline. Many involve manoeuvring these character(s) through an [[overworld]], usually populated with monsters, that allows access to more important game locations, such as towns, dungeons, and castles. Since the emergence of affordable [[home computer]]s coincided with the popularity of [[paper and pencil game|paper and pencil]] role-playing games, this genre was one of the first in video games and continues to be popular today. Gameplay elements strongly associated with RPG, such as statistical character development through the acquisition of [[experience point]]s, have been widely adapted to other genres such as [[action-adventure game]]s. Though nearly all of the early entries in the genre were [[turn-based game]]s, many modern role-playing games progress in real-time. Thus, the genre has followed the [[strategy game]]'s trend of moving from turn-based to real-time combat. The move to real-time combat began with the release of [[Square (video game company)|Square]]'s (now [[Square Enix]]'s) ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'', the first game to use the [[Final Fantasy battle systems#Active Time Battle|Active Time Battle]] system; this was quickly followed by truly real-time action role-playing games such as the [[Mana (series)|''Mana'' series]], ''[[Soul Blazer]]'' and ''[[Ultima VII]]''. Although older turn-based system still exist, such as the [[Golden Sun (series)|''Golden Sun'']] series for [[Game Boy Advance]] as well as ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]''.\n\n=== Action RPG ===\n[[File:Freedroidrpg basic gameplay.ogv|thumb|left|Video showing basic point and click action RPG gameplay.]]\nThe [[action role-playing game]] or action RPG is a type of [[role-playing video game]] which incorporates real-time combat as opposed to turn-based or menu-based, often borrowing elements from [[action game]]s or [[action-adventure game]]s. Some of the first action role-playing games were produced by [[Nihon Falcom]] in the 1980s, such as the [[Dragon Slayer (series)|''Dragon Slayer'' series]] and [[Ys (video game series)|''Ys'' series]]. Later so-called \"''[[Diablo (video game)|Diablo]]'' clones\" are also part of this genre. Although the precise definition of the genre varies, the typical action RPG features a heavy emphasis on combat, often simplifying or removing non-combat attributes and statistics and the effect they have on the character's development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgdot.com/index.php?hsaction=10053&ID=1007 |title=The Action RPG Revolution |accessdate=2007-03-02 |last=Turner |first=Brian |date=2004-07-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051101204302/http://www.rpgdot.com/index.php?hsaction=10053&ID=1007 |archivedate=November 1, 2005 }}</ref> Additionally, combat always takes place using a real-time system (hence the \"action\") that relies on the player's ability to perform particular actions with speed and accuracy to determine success, rather than mainly using the player character's attributes to determine this.\n\n=== MMORPG ===\n[[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s, or MMORPG, emerged in the mid to late 1990s as a commercial, [[graphical game|graphical]] variant of text-based [[MUD]]s, which had existed since 1978. By and large, MMORPG feature the usual RPG objectives of completing quests and strengthening one's [[player character]], but involve up to hundreds of players interacting with each other on the same persistent world in real-time. The massively multiplayer concept was quickly combined with other genres. Fantasy MMORPG, like ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar]]'', and ''[[The Elder Scrolls Online]]'', remain the most popular type of MMOG, with the most popular \"pay-to-play\" game being ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', and the most popular \"[[free-to-play]]\" games including ''[[RuneScape]]'' and ''[[TERA (video game)|TERA]]'', yet other types of MMORPG are appearing. Sci-fi MMORPG like ''[[Phantasy Star Online]]'' hold a smaller part of the market, with the popular space sci-fi game ''[[EVE Online]]'' being the most notable. Other massively multiplayer online games which do not have a conventional RPG setting include [[Second Life]] and [[Ingress (game)|Ingress]].\n\n=== Roguelikes ===\n[[File:Nethack screenshot.png|thumbnail|left|''[[NetHack]]'' is a roguelike game.  The text display seen here is common in games in the roguelike genre.]]\nThe [[roguelike]] video game subgenre borrows its name and gameplay elements from the 1980 computer game ''[[Rogue (computer game)|Rogue]]''. Superficially, a roguelike is a two-dimensional [[dungeon crawl]] with a high degree of randomness and an emphasis on statistical character development. Though traditionally featuring a text user interface, many such games utilize graphic tiles to overcome character set limitations.\n\n=== Tactical RPG ===\nThe [[tactical role-playing game]] subgenre principally refers to games which incorporate gameplay from [[strategy video game|strategy games]] as an alternative to traditional RPG systems.<ref name=\"EATRPG\">{{cite web |accessdate=2009-01-23 |url=http://www.ea.com/official/lordoftherings/tactics/us/whatis.jsp |title=What is Tactics? |publisher=Electronic Arts |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925180218/http://www.ea.com/official/lordoftherings/tactics/us/whatis.jsp |archive-date=September 25, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> Like standard RPG, the player controls a finite party and battles a similar number of enemies, but this genre incorporates strategic gameplay such as tactical movement on an isometric grid.<ref name=\"EATRPG\"/> The genre has its origins in [[tabletop role-playing game]]s, where each player has time to decide his or her characters' actions.\n\n=== Sandbox RPG ===\nSandbox RPG or [[Open world|Open World RPG]] allow the player a large amount of freedom and usually contain a somewhat more open free-roaming (meaning the player is not confined to a single path restricted by rocks or fences etc.) world. Sandbox RPGs contain similarities to other sandbox games such as the [[Grand Theft Auto]] series, with a large number of interactable non-player characters, large amount of content and typically some of the largest worlds to explore and longest playtimes of all RPG due to an impressive amount of secondary content not critical to the game's main storyline. Sandbox RPG often attempt to emulate an entire region of their setting. Popular examples of this subgenre include the ''[[Dragon Slayer (series)|Dragon Slayer]]'' series by [[Nihon Falcom]], the early ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' games by [[Chunsoft]], ''[[Zelda II]]'' by [[Nintendo]], ''[[Wasteland (video game)|Wasteland]]'' by [[Interplay Entertainment]], the ''[[SaGa (series)|SaGa]]'' and ''[[Mana (series)|Mana]]'' series by [[Squaresoft]], ''[[System Shock 2]]'' by [[Irrational Games]] and [[Looking Glass Studios]], ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'' by [[Ion Storm]], ''[[The Elder Scrolls]]'' and [[Fallout series|''Fallout'' series]] by [[Bethesda Softworks]] and [[Interplay Entertainment]], ''[[Fable (2004 video game)|Fable]]'' by [[Lionhead Studios]], the [[Gothic series|''Gothic'' series]] by [[Piranha Bytes]], and the ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles]]'' series by [[Monolith Soft]].\n\n===JRPG===\nA role-playing game made in Japan but has since encapsulated a new kind of game not just made in Japan. Some games include ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' for the SNES, ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', and many more.\n\n===First-person party-based RPG===\n[[File:DOTGv0.31screenshot.png|thumb|right|Screenshot of ''Damnation of Gods'', a ''Dungeon Master'' clone. All four members of the players's party move around the game world as a single unit in first-person perspective.]]\nAlso known as DRPG (Dungeon RPG), this subgenre consists of RPGs where the player leads a party of adventurers in [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]] through a dungeon or labyrinth, typically in a grid-based environment. Examples include the aforementioned ''Wizardry'', ''Might and Magic'' and ''Bard's Tale'' series; as well as the ''[[Etrian Odyssey (series)|Etrian Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Elminage]]'' series. Games of this type are also known as \"blobbers\", since the player moves the entire party around the playing field as a single unit, or \"blob\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/12/05/the-rpgs-of-2017/ |title=The RPGs of 2017 |last=Cobbett |first=Richard |date=December 5, 2016 |website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun |publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun |access-date=2017-05-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415020146/https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/12/05/the-rpgs-of-2017/ |archive-date=April 15, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/FelipePepe/20150625/244262/CRPG_History_Abridged__21_RPGs_that_brought_something_new_to_the_table.php |title=CRPG History Abridged - 21 RPGs that brought something new to the table |last=Pepe |first=Felipe |date=June 25, 2015 |website=Gamasutra |publisher=UBM |access-date=2017-05-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524090937/http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/FelipePepe/20150625/244262/CRPG_History_Abridged__21_RPGs_that_brought_something_new_to_the_table.php |archive-date=May 24, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMost \"blobbers\" are turn-based, but some titles such as the ''Dungeon Master'', ''[[Legend of Grimrock]]'', and ''[[Eye of the Beholder (video game)|Eye of the Beholder]]'' series are played in real-time. Early games in this genre lack an [[automap]] feature, forcing players to draw their own maps in order to keep track of their progress. Environmental and spatial puzzles are common, meaning players may have to, for instance, move a stone in one part of the level in order to open a gate in another part of the level.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n== Simulation ==\n{{main|Simulation video game}}\n\n[[Simulation video game]]s is a diverse super-category of games, generally designed to closely simulate aspects of a real or fictional reality.\n\n=== Construction and management simulation ===\n{{main|Construction and management simulation}}\n[[File:Lincity-ng.png|thumb|A sample city from ''[[Lincity|Lincity NG]]'']]\n[[Construction and management simulation]]s (or CMS) are a type of simulation game which task players to build, expand or manage fictional communities or projects with limited resources.\n\nIn [[city-building game]]s the player acts as overall planner or leader to meet the needs and wants of game characters by initiating structures for food, shelter, health, spiritual care, economic growth, etc. Success is achieved when the city budget makes a growing profit and citizens experience an upgraded lifestyle in housing, health, and goods. While military development is often included, the emphasis is on economic strength. Perhaps the most known game of this type is ''[[SimCity]]'', which is still popular and has had great influence on later city-building games. ''SimCity'', however, also belongs to the ''God Games'' genre since it gives the player god-like abilities in manipulating the world. [[Caesar (video game)|Caesar]] was a long-running series in this genre, with the original game spawning three sequels.\n\n[[Business simulation game]]s generally attempt to simulate an economy or business, with the player controlling the economy of the game.\n\nA [[government simulation game]] (or \"political game\") involves the simulation of the policies, government or politics of a country, but typically excludes warfare. Recently, these types of games have gained the moniker \"[[serious game]]\".\n\n=== Life simulation ===\n{{main|Life simulation game}}\n\n[[Life simulation game]]s (or artificial life games) involve living or controlling one or more artificial lives. A life simulation game can revolve around individuals and relationships, or it could be a simulation of an ecosystem.\n\nBiological simulations may allow the player to experiment with [[genetics]], [[wikt:survival|survival]] or [[ecosystem]]s, often in the form of an [[Serious game|educational package]]. An early example is ''[[SimLife]]'', while relatively recent ones are ''[[Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis]]'' and ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]''. In other educational simulations such as ''[[Wolf (game)|Wolf]]'', the player \"lives the life\" of an individual animal in a relatively realistic way. Hailed as one of the greatest life simulation games, however, is Creatures, Creatures 2, Creatures 3, where the player breeds generations of a species in a hugely detailed ecosystem.\n\nUnlike other genres of games, [[god game]]s often do not have a set goal that allows a player to win the game. The focus of a god game tends to be control over the lives of people, anywhere from micromanaging a family to overseeing the rise of a civilization.\n\n[[Pet-raising simulation]]s (or [[digital pet]]s) focus more on the relationship between the player and one or few life forms. They are often more limited in scope than other biological simulations. This includes popular examples of [[virtual pets]] such as ''[[Tamagotchi]]'', the ''[[Petz]]'' series, and ''[[Nintendogs]]''.\n\n[[Social simulation game]]s base their gameplay on the [[social interaction]] between multiple artificial lives. The most famous example from this genre is Will Wright's ''[[The Sims]]''. [[Dating sim|Dating sims]] and Romance simulation games fall under this category.\n\n=== Vehicle simulation ===\n{{main|Vehicle simulation game}}\n\n[[Vehicle simulation game]]s are a genre of [[video games]] which attempt to provide the player with a realistic interpretation of operating various kinds of vehicles.<ref name=\"Rollings1\">{{harvnb|Rollings|2003|pp=395\u2013415}}</ref>\n\n[[File:FG-A-10.jpg|thumb|''[[FlightGear]]'' is a flight simulation game.|alt=|230x230px]]\n\nA [[Flight simulation#Flight Simulators at Home|flight simulation]] tasks the player with flying an aircraft, usually an airplane, as realistically as possible. [[Combat flight simulator]]s are the most popular subgenre of simulation. The player controls the plane, not only simulating the act of flying, but also combat situations. There are also civilian flight simulators that do not have the combat aspect.\n\n[[Racing game]]s typically place the player in the driver's seat of a high-performance vehicle and require the player to race against other drivers or sometimes just time. This genre of games is one of the staples of the computer gaming world and many of the earliest computer games created were part of this genre. Emerging in the late 1970s, this genre is still very popular today and continues to push the envelope in terms of graphics and performance. These games \"tend to fall into ''organized racing'' and ''imaginary racing'' categories\". Organized racing simulators attempt to \"reproduce the experience of driving a racing car or motorcycle in an existing racing class: [[Indycar]], [[NASCAR]], [[Formula 1]], and so on.\" On the other hand, imaginary racing games involve \"imaginary situations, driving madly through cities or the countryside or even fantasy environments\". These \"imaginary\" racing games are sometimes called arcade racing games, in contrast to their more realistic \"racing simulation\" counterparts. These include ''[[Need For Speed]]'', ''[[Mario Kart]]'' and ''[[Gran Turismo (series)|Gran Turismo]]''. Rollings and Adams note that \"racing games are often sold in the [[sports game|sports]] category,\" but \"from a [[video game design|design]] standpoint, they really belong in ... vehicle simulations\".<ref name=\"Rollings1\"/>\n\n[[Space flight simulator game]]s are a subgenre that involve piloting a [[spacecraft]]. Space simulators are different from other subgenres, and are not generally considered to be simulators, as their simulated objects do not always exist and often disregard the laws of physics.\n\n[[Train simulator]]s simulate the vehicles, environments and often economics associated with railway transport. These are frequently historical in nature, reminiscing on the evolution and emergence of the railroad in various countries and the economic booms that often accompanied them.\n\n[[Vehicular combat]] or ''car combat'' games focus on fast-paced action, as the player operates a [[car]] or other vehicle and attempts to disable or destroy [[CPU]] or human opponents. Vehicular combat games often allow a player to choose from a variety of potential vehicles, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Vehicular combat was born out of racing/shooter combinations like ''[[Spy Hunter]]'', ''[[RoadBlasters]]'', and ''[[Rock 'N' Roll Racing]]'', but differs in that the players can, if desired, take their vehicles off predefined routes and do battle wherever they please. A subgenre of vehicular combat is ''[[Mecha]]'' combat, where vehicles generally include giant robot-like tanks.\n\n== Strategy ==\n{{main|Strategy video game}}\n\n[[Strategy video game]]s focus on gameplay requiring careful and skillful thinking and planning in order to achieve victory and the action scales from world domination to squad-based tactics. \u201cIn most strategy video games,\u201d says Andrew Rollings, \"the player is given a godlike view of the game world, indirectly controlling the units under his command.\"<ref name=\"Rollings2\">{{harvnb|Rollings|2003|pp=321\u2013345}}</ref> Rollings also notes that \"The origin of strategy games is rooted in their close cousins, board games.\"<ref name=\"Rollings2\"/> Strategy video games generally take one of four archetypal forms, depending on whether the game is '''turn-based or real-time''' and whether the game's focus is upon '''strategy or tactics'''. Real time strategy games are often a multiple unit selection game (multiple game characters can be selected at once to perform different tasks, as opposed to only selecting one character at a time)  with a sky view (view looking down from above) but some recent games such as Tom Clancy's [[EndWar]], are single unit selection and third person view. Like many RPG games, many strategy games are gradually moving away from turn-based systems to more real-time systems.\n\n=== 4X game ===\n{{Main|4X game}}\n[[4X game|4X]] refers to a genre of strategy video game with four primary goals: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate. A 4X game can be [[turn-based]] or [[real-time strategy|real-time]]. Perhaps the best known example of this genre is [[Sid Meier]]'s ''[[Civilization (computer game)|Civilization]]'' series. 4X games often cover a very large period of time, giving the player the control of an entire civilization or species. Typically these games have a historical setting, encompassing a large amount of human history ([[Empire Earth]], Civilization, Golden Age of Civilizations) or a science fiction setting where the player controls a species set to dominate the galaxy ([[Master of Orion]], [[Galactic Civilizations]]).\n\n=== Artillery game ===\n[[File:Scorched 3D 40.1 screenshot 2.jpg|thumb|220x220px|''[[Scorched 3D]]'' is an artillery game.]]\n{{Main|Artillery game}}\n[[Artillery game|Artillery]] is the generic name for early two or three-player (usually [[turn-based]]) computer games involving [[tank]]s fighting each other in combat or similar derivative games. Artillery games were among the earliest computer games developed and can be considered an extension of the original use of computers, which were once used for military-based calculations such as plotting the trajectories of rockets. Artillery games are considered a type of [[turn-based tactics]] game, though they have also been described as a type of \"shooting game.\" Examples of this genre are ''[[Pocket Tanks]]'', ''[[Hogs of War]]'', ''[[Scorched 3D]]'' and the ''[[Worms (series)|Worms]]'' series.\n\n=== {{anchor|Auto battler}}Auto battler (Auto chess) ===\n{{Main|Auto battler}}\n[[Auto battler]], also known as \"auto chess\", is a type of strategy game that features [[chess]]-like elements where players place characters on a grid-shaped battlefield during a preparation phase, who then fight the opposing team's characters without any further direct input from the player.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/08/01/what-is-an-auto-battler/|title=Spawn Point: What on earth is an auto battler?|last1=Cox|first1=Matt|website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803125851/https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/08/01/what-is-an-auto-battler/|archive-date=August 3, 2019|accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref> It was created and popularized by ''[[Dota Auto Chess]]'' in early 2019, and saw more games in the genre by other studios, such as ''[[Teamfight Tactics]]'', ''[[Dota Underlords]]'', and ''[[Hearthstone Battlegrounds]]'' releasing soon after.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/04/a-guide-to-auto-chess-tft-league-of-legends-teamfight-tactics-dota-underlords|title=An Introduction to Auto Chess, Teamfight Tactics and Dota Underlords|last1=Gilroy|first1=Joab|website=IGN|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704045655/https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/04/a-guide-to-auto-chess-tft-league-of-legends-teamfight-tactics-dota-underlords|archive-date=July 4, 2019|accessdate=July 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/a-guide-to-auto-chess-2019-s-most-popular-new-game-gen-1835820155|title=A Guide To Auto Chess, 2019\u2019s Most Popular New Game Genre|last1=Grayson|first1=Nathan|website=Kotaku|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190703221157/https://kotaku.com/a-guide-to-auto-chess-2019-s-most-popular-new-game-gen-1835820155|archive-date=July 3, 2019|accessdate=July 21, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/1/20943670/blizzcon-2019-announcement-hearthstone-battlegrounds-auto-chess|title=Blizzard announces Hearthstone Battlegrounds, a new autobattler set in the Warcraft Universe|last=Goslin|first=Austen|date=2019-11-01|website=Polygon|language=en|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref>\n\n=== Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) ===\n{{Main|Multiplayer online battle arena}}\n[[File:Vainglory Halcyon Fold map.tif|thumb|281x281px|''[[Vainglory (video game)|Vainglory]]'' is a multiplayer online battle arena game designed for smartphones and tablets.|alt=]]\n[[Multiplayer online battle arena]] (MOBA) is a genre of strategy video games that originated as a subgenre of [[real-time strategy]] in which each player controls a single character in a team to compete with another team of players. The objective is to destroy the opposing team's main structure with the assistance of computer-controlled units, which periodically [[Spawning (gaming)|spawn]] in groups at the base and marching down predefined paths (called \"lanes\") toward the enemy base. Every [[player character]] typically has its own diverse kit with unique abilities, design, strengths, and weaknesses. Player characters grow in power over the course of a match and learn new thematic abilities, which contribute to a team's overall strategy. Multiplayer online battle arena games are a fusion of [[real-time strategy games]], [[Role-playing video game|role-playing games]], and [[Action game|action games]], though players usually do not construct either buildings or units.\n\nThe genre gained popularity in the 2010s, with ''[[Defense of the Ancients]]'' mod for ''[[Warcraft III]]'', ''[[League of Legends]]'', ''[[Dota 2]]'', ''[[Heroes of the Storm]]'', and ''[[Smite (video game)|Smite]]'' being popular.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.progamerreview.com/best-moba-games/|title=Best Modern MOBA Games - LoL, Dota 2, HotS & Smite Compared|last=Amstrup|first=Johannes|last2=ersen|date=2017-09-15|website=Pro Gamer Reviews|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-19}}</ref> MOBA games are also well-represented in [[esports]] with the prize pools of over 60 million dollars in 2018, which is about 40% of the total esports prize pools in the same year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/konvoy/esports-prize-pools-155-9m-2018-ce1ff44bd41|title=Esports Prize Pools: $155.9M (2018)|last=Hurst|first=Taylor|date=2019-02-12|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Real-time strategy (RTS) ===\n{{Main|Real-time strategy}}\nThe moniker \"[[real-time strategy]]\" (RTS), usually applied only to certain computer strategy games, (however, this genre is probably the most well known of strategy games and is what most websites mean when they say \"strategy games\") indicates that the action in the game is continuous, and players will have to make their decisions and actions within the backdrop of a constantly changing game state. Real-time strategy gameplay is characterised by obtaining resources, building bases, researching technologies and producing units. Blizzard Entertainment's ''[[Starcraft]]'' is a popular RTS played competitively in South Korea and televised to large audiences. Other notable games include the [[Warcraft (series)|''Warcraft'' series]], [[Age of Empires|''Age of Empires'' series]], ''[[Dawn of War]]'', ''[[Command and Conquer]]'', and ''[[Dune II]]'' (essentially the first RTS game). Outside of PCs, very few strategy games are real-time; a few examples are ''[[Battle for Middle-earth II]]'', ''[[Pikmin]]'' and ''[[Halo Wars]]''. Even fewer ones use physical pieces, such as ''[[Icehouse (game)|Icehouse]]''.\n\n=== Real-time tactics (RTT) ===\n{{Main|Real-time tactics}}\n[[Real-time tactics]] (abbreviated RTT<ref name=\"ign-stateoftherts\">{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/700/700747p3.html|title=The State of the RTS|work=[[IGN]]|date=April 7, 2006|accessdate=September 14, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624224943/http://pc.ign.com/articles/700/700747p3.html|archive-date=June 24, 2006|url-status=live}}(Article at IGN discussing their perception of RTS and related genres as of 2006.

It is also sometimes considered a subgenre of [[real-time strategy]], and thus may in this context exist as an element of gameplay or as a basis for the whole game. It is differentiated from [[real-time strategy]] gameplay by the lack of resource [[micromanagement]] and base or unit building, as well as the greater importance of individual units<ref name=\"ign-stateoftherts\"/><ref name=splanet>{{cite web | title =Point - CounterPoint: Resource Collection vs. Fixed Units | publisher =StrategyPlanet | url =http://www.strategyplanet.com/features/articles/pcp-resources/ | accessdate =2007-11-04 | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071231194439/http://www.strategyplanet.com/features/articles/pcp-resources/ | archivedate =2007-12-31 }}</ref> and a focus on complex battlefield tactics. Example titles include ''[[Warhammer: Dark Omen]]'', ''[[World In Conflict]]'', the ''[[Close Combat (game)|Close Combat]]'' series, and early [[tactical role-playing game]]s such as ''[[Bokosuka Wars]]'', ''[[Kure Software Koubou|Silver Ghost]]'', and ''First Queen''.\n\n=== Tower defense ===\n{{Main|Tower defense}}\n[[Tower defense]] games have a very simple layout. Usually, computer-controlled monsters called ''creeps'' move along a set path, and the player must place, or \"build\" towers along this path to kill the creeps. In some games, towers are placed along a set path for creeps, while in others towers can interrupt creep movement and change their path. In most tower defense games different towers have different abilities such as poisoning enemies or slowing them down. The player is awarded money for killing creeps, and this money can be used to buy more towers, or buy upgrades for a tower such as increased power or range.\n\n=== Turn-based strategy (TBS) ===\n{{Main|Turn-based strategy}}\n[[File:Battle for wesnoth version 1.12.0 screenshot.jpg|thumb|235x235px|''[[The Battle for Wesnoth]]'' is a turn-based strategy game.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2009-01-23 |url=http://pc.ign.com/objects/142/14240090.html |title=The Battle for Wesnoth |publisher=IGN |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205044129/http://pc.ign.com/objects/142/14240090.html |archive-date=December 5, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>]]\nThe term [[turn-based strategy]] (TBS) is usually reserved for certain computer strategy games, to distinguish them from real-time strategy games. A player of a turn-based game is allowed a period of analysis before committing to a game action, and some games allow a certain number of moves or actions to take place in a turn. Like real-time strategy games, this genre can include many strategy games which are not solely turn-based games, and games which may contain other features not related to whether the game is turn-based or not. Examples of this genre are the ''[[Civilization computer game|Civilization]]'', ''[[Heroes of Might and Magic]]'', ''[[Making History (game)|Making History]],'' and ''[[Master of Orion]]''.\n\nSome recent turn-based strategy games feature a different gameplay mechanic, with a simultaneous resolution of the turns, every player preparing their future actions in the planning phase, then letting the game follow the orders given at the same time, causing orders to be interrupted by the opponent(s) actions, changing the gameplay from reacting to the opponent's action into guessing them.\n\n=== Turn-based tactics (TBT) ===\n{{Main|Turn-based tactics}}\nThe gameplay of [[turn-based tactics]] games (TBT) is characterized by the expectation of players to complete their tasks using the combat forces provided to them, and usually by the provision of a realistic (or at least believable) representation of military tactics and operations. Examples of this genre include the ''[[Wars (series)|Wars]]'', ''[[Jagged Alliance]]'' and ''[[X-COM]]'' series, as well as [[tactical role-playing game]]s such as the ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]''.\n\n=== Wargame ===\n{{Main|Wargame (video games)}}\n[[Wargame (video games)|Wargames]] are a [[subgenre]] of [[strategy video game]]s that emphasize strategic or tactical warfare on a map. Wargames generally take one of four archetypal forms, depending on whether the game is turn-based or real-time and whether the game's focus is upon [[military strategy]] or [[military tactics|tactics]].\n\n=== Grand strategy wargame ===\n{{Main|Grand strategy wargame}}\nA [[grand strategy wargame]] is a [[Wargaming|wargame]] that places focus on [[grand strategy]]: military [[strategy]] at the level of movement and use of an entire [[nation state]] or [[empire]]'s resources.\n\n== Sports ==\nSports are video games that simulate [[sports]]. This opposing team(s) can be controlled by other real life people or artificial intelligence.\n\n=== Racing ===\nOne competes against time or opponents using some means of transportation. Sub-genres include [[Sim racing|racing simulators]] (''[[Gran Turismo (series)|Gran Turismo]]'') and [[kart racing game|kart racing]] (''[[Mario Kart]]'').\n\n=== Sports game ===\n[[Sports game]]s emulate the playing of traditional physical [[sports]]. Some emphasize actually playing the sport, while others emphasize the strategy behind the sport (such as ''[[Championship Manager series|Championship Manager]]''). Others satirize the sport for comic effect (such as ''[[Arch Rivals]]''). One of the best selling series in this genre is the ''[[FIFA (video game series)|FIFA]]'' series. This genre emerged early in the history of video games (e.g., ''[[Pong]]'') and remains popular today.\n\n=== Competitive ===\nGames that have high competitive factor but does not represent any traditional sports or the concept is fictional designed by the developer (e.g. [[Ball Jacks]]).\n\n=== Sports-based fighting ===\n\nSports-based fighting games are titles that fall firmly within the definitions of both the Fighting game and Sports game genre, such as boxing and wrestling video games. As such, they are usually put in their own separate subgenres. Often the fighting is far more realistic than in traditional fighting games (though the amount of realism can greatly vary), and many feature real-world franchises or fighters. Examples of this include the [[Fight Night (EA video game series)|''Fight Night'']], ''[[UFC (video game)|UFC]]'' and ''[[WWE 2K]]'' series.\n\n== Other notable genres ==\n\n=== Board game or card game ===\nMany popular [[board game]]s and [[card game]]s have computer versions. [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] opponents can help improve one's skill at traditional games. [[Computer chess|Chess]], [[Draughts|Checkers]], Othello (also known as [[Reversi]]), and [[Backgammon]] have world class computer programs. [[Mahjong]] and related games are immensely popular in [[China]] and [[Japan]]. [[Go (game)|Go]] is popular in [[East Asia]], though it is notoriously difficult to program a [[Computer Go|computer to play Go]] well. \n\n=== Casual games ===\nCasual games are designed to be easily picked up and put down again, allowing for potentially short bursts of play, such as ''Call of Duty'' and most games on a mobile platform. This genre of gaming is meant to be a short and relaxing pastime, a rest in between other occupations and so is most popular with demographics who have less free time. For this reason the games often have auto-saving and syncing as standard so the games can be minimised, put into sleep or otherwise put down with no loss to the player. Market leaders in this genre are often boldly coloured, designed for intuitive interaction and have a high balance of reward to time to keep people coming back. Designers of these games should add a lot of \"juice\" (sound and motion elements that excite the senses) to make them stand out in a sea of highly similar games.\n\nDue to the aforementioned requirements, many of these games are quite simple to pick up and play without lengthy tutorials. Retaining players involves a lot of careful design of levels, challenges and events.\n\n=== Digital collectible card game ===\nA [[digital collectible card game]] (DCCG) is a computer or video game usually played online that emulates [[Collectible card game|collectible card games]] (CCG), or in many cases, doesn't use card-like images at all, but instead [[Icons (computing)|icons]], [[Avatar (computing)|avatars]] or other symbols to represent game pieces. Originally, DCCGs started out as replications of a CCG's physical counterpart such as ''[[Magic: The Gathering]],'' but many DCCGs have foregone a physical version and exclusively release as a video game, such as with ''[[Hearthstone]]''.\n\n=== Logic game ===\nLogic games require the player to solve [[logic]] puzzles or navigate complex locations such as [[maze]]s. They are well suited to [[Casual game|casual play]], and [[Tile-matching video game|tile-matching puzzle games]] are among the most popular casual games. This genre frequently crosses over with adventure and educational games. ''[[Tetris]]'', labeled a puzzle game, is credited for revolutionizing gaming and popularizing the puzzle genre.\n\n=== MMO ===\n{{Main|Massively multiplayer online game}}\nA [[massively multiplayer online game]] (also called MMO and MMOG) is a [[multiplayer video game]] which is capable of supporting large numbers of players simultaneously. By necessity, they are played on the [[Internet]]. Many games have at least one [[persistent world]], however others just have large numbers of players competing at once in one form or another without any lasting effect to the world at all. These games can be found for most network-capable platforms, including the [[personal computer]], [[video game console]], or [[smartphone]]s and other mobile devices.\n\nMMO games can enable players to cooperate and compete with each other on a large scale, and sometimes to interact meaningfully with people around the world. They include a variety of gameplay types, representing many video game genres, an example is the widely played game ''[[Minecraft]]'' which can be played both as an MMO or a single player game.\n\n===Mobile game===\nMobile games are played on devices like phones and tablets, and are usually easy games for casual gamers.\nGames like ''[[Candy Crush Saga]]'' and ''[[Angry Birds]]'' are mobile games. Some mobile games are ported from consoles or computers,\nlike ''[[Minecraft]]'', ''[[Plants vs Zombies]]'', and ''[[Fortnite]]''. Mobile games are usually made for casual gamers and\ncan be played and completed easily, so they can be played by people of all ages.\n\n=== Party game ===\n[[Party games#Party video games|Party games]] are video games developed specifically for multiplayer games between many players. Normally, party games have a variety of [[mini-game]]s that range between collecting more of a certain item than other players or having the fastest time at something. Such games include the ''[[Mario Party]]'' series, ''[[Crash Bash]]'', and ''[[Rayman Raving Rabbids]]''. Versus multiplayer games are not generally considered to be party games.\n\n=== Programming game ===\nA [[programming game]] is a [[computer game]] where the player has no direct influence on the course of the game. Instead, a [[computer program]] or script is written in some [[domain-specific programming language]] in order to control the actions of the characters (usually [[robot]]s, [[tank]]s or [[bacteria]], which seek to destroy each other). In ''[[SpaceChem]]'', for example, players design circuits used for creating molecules from raw materials. ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]'' also includes some elements of a programming game, as the player creates the AI of his characters, although the player can also choose to directly control the action.\n\n=== Trivia game ===\n[[Trivia]] games are growing in popularity, especially on [[mobile phone]]s where people may only have a few minutes to play the game. In trivia games, the object is to answer questions with the goal of obtaining points. They may be based on real-life trivia game shows such as ''[[Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?]]'' or ''[[Family Feud]]''.\n\n==Idle gaming==\n{{Main|Incremental game}}\nIn an [[IGN]] article, ''[[Cookie Clicker]]'' is credited as one of the few games to have played a major role in the establishment of the genre of idle gaming.<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web |url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2013/10/10/inside-cookie-clicker-and-the-idle-game-movement |title=Inside Cookie Clicker and the Idle Game Move |last=Davis |first=Justin |publisher=IGN |date=October 10, 2013 |accessdate=April 2, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630202207/http://ca.ign.com/articles/2013/10/10/inside-cookie-clicker-and-the-idle-game-movement |archive-date=June 30, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThis genre involves games that orient the player with a trivial task, such as clicking a cookie; and as the game progresses, the player is gradually rewarded certain upgrades for completing said task. In all, these games require very little involvement from the player, and in most cases they play themselves; hence the use of the word \"[[idle]]\".\n\nIn early 2014, Orteil released an early version of ''Idle Game Maker'', a tool allowing customized idle games to be made without coding knowledge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/idlegamemaker/help |title=Idle Game Maker Documentation |publisher=Orteil.dashnet.org |accessdate=2014-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714142951/http://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/idlegamemaker/help |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Video game genres by purpose ==\n\nWhile most video games are designed as entertainment, many video games are designed with additional purposes. These purposes are as varied as the nature of information itself\u2014to inform, persuade, or stimulate. These games can have any kind of gameplay, from puzzles to action to adventure.\n\n=== Advergame ===\n{{main|Advergame}}\n[[Advergame]]s, in the context of video game genres, refers to promotional software specifically made to advertise a product, organization or viewpoint. The first advergames were distributed on floppy disk by the [[Chef Boyardee]], [[Coca-Cola]], and [[Samsung]] brands,<ref name=gamedaily>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/features/dunkin-for-advergames/68443/?biz=1 |title=Dunkin' for Advergames |access-date=January 24, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230013119/http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/features/dunkin-for-advergames/68443/?biz=1 |archive-date=December 30, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> while the first cereal box advergame was [[Chex Quest]] in 1996.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.joystiq.com/2008/04/18/ask-joystiq-chex-quest-he-man-and-broken-360-gamepads/ | title = Ask Joystiq: Chex Quest, He-Man and broken 360 gamepads | publisher = Joystiq | author = Ross Miller | date = April 18, 2008 | accessdate = 2008-07-16 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080517003720/http://www.joystiq.com/2008/04/18/ask-joystiq-chex-quest-he-man-and-broken-360-gamepads/ | archive-date = May 17, 2008 | url-status = dead }}</ref> The majority of advergames are found online and mostly include simple and cheaply made [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] games. Some advergames were released to consoles, like [[Pepsiman (video game)|Pepsiman]] for Sony PlayStation.\n\n=== Art game ===\n{{main|Art game}}\n[[Art game]]s are designed so as to emphasize art or whose structures are intended to produce some kind of non-[[ludology|ludological]] reaction in its audience. Art games typically go out of their way to have a unique, unconventional look, often standing out for aesthetic beauty or complexity in design. This concept extends to the realm of modified (\"modded\") gaming when modifications have been made to existing non-art-games to produce graphic results intended to be viewed as an artistic display, as opposed to modifications intended to change game play scenarios or for storytelling. Modified games created for artistic purposes are sometimes referred to as \"[[videogame art]].\"\n\n=== Casual game ===\n{{main|Casual game}}\n[[Casual game]]s have very simple rules or play techniques and a very low degree of strategy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6186207.html?tag=result;title;0 |title=GDC '08: Are casual games the future? |last=Boyes |first=Emma |date=2008-02-18 |publisher=GameSpot |accessdate=2009-01-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711072428/http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6186207.html?tag=result%3Btitle%3B0 |archivedate=2011-07-11 }}</ref> They also require no long-term time commitment or special skills to play, making them easy to learn and play as a pastime.

The purpose of the casual game is to entertain, but with a much lower commitment than other video games.\n\n=== Christian game ===\n{{main|Christian video games}}\n[[Christian video games|Christian games]] attempt to provide the dual purposes of spreading the [[Christianity|Christian religion]] to non-believers through the medium of video games, and providing gamers who identify as Christian with a common pool of games. Christian video games were first developed by [[Wisdom Tree]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], without license. While largely regarded as derivative titles by the mainstream gaming culture,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Christian games have nevertheless expanded in distribution since their inception.\n\n=== Educational game ===\n{{main|Educational game}}\n[[Educational game]]s, as the name implies, attempt to teach the user using the game as a vehicle. Most of these types of games target young users from the ages of about three years to mid-[[teen]]s;{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} past the mid-teens, subjects become so complex (e.g. [[Calculus]]) that teaching via a game is impractical.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Numerous subgenres exist, in fields such as math or typing.\n\n=== Esports ===\n{{main|Esports}}\n[[Esports]] games are [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] games that are usually played competitively at the professional level. These games are often targeted at the \"hardcore\" gaming audience, and are usually [[first-person shooter]] games, requiring twitch-based reaction speed and coordination, or [[real-time strategy]] games, requiring high levels of strategic macro- and micromanagement, or [[MOBA]]s, requiring both.\n\n=== Exergame ===\n{{main|Exergaming}}\nAn [[Exergaming|exergame]] ([[Portmanteau word|portmanteau]] of \"[[exercise]]\" and \"[[video game|game]]\") is a video game that provides exercise. \"Exergames\" sub-divide into two main implementations, those with a game specifically designed to use an exercise input device (for example, the game ''[[Wii Fit]]'' using the [[Wii Balance Board]]) and those implementations using a genre of a game. Games fit into the category of entertainment, and similarly \"exergames\" are a category of \"exertainment\" (formed from \"[[exercise]]\" and \"[[entertainment]]\"). \"Exertainment\" refers to one aspect of adding entertainment to an exercise workout.\n\n=== Personalized game ===\n{{main|Personalized video game}}\n[[Personalized video game|Personalized games]] are created for one specific player or a group of players usually as a gift. They are hand-made to feature real names, places and events from the recipient's life. Usual occasions for such games are birthdays, anniversaries, and engagement proposals.\n\n=== Serious game ===\n{{main|Serious game}}\n[[Serious game]]s are intended to educate or train the player. These games tend to promote \"education, science, social change, health care or even the military.\"<ref name=serious>{{cite web |accessdate=2009-01-23 |url=http://www.cnet.com.au/games/0,239029232,240061367,00.htm |title=What's wrong with serious games? |publisher=CNET |date=2006-03-23 |author=Terdiman, Daniel |authorlink=Daniel Terdiman |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323102029/http://www.cnet.com.au/games/0,239029232,240061367,00.htm |archive-date=March 23, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Some of these games have no specific ending or goal in the game. Rather, the player learns a real life lesson from the game. For example, games from [[website]]s such as Newsgaming.com and gamesforchange.org raise political issues using the distinct properties of games.\n\n== Scientific studies ==\n\nAs video games are increasingly the subject of scientific studies, game genres are themselves becoming a subject of study.\n\nAn early attempt at analysis of the action and adventure genres appeared in a Game Developers Conference 2000 paper 'Mostly Armless: Grabbing the 3D World'. This critiqued a variety of adventure and action games to categorize gameplay and interaction for adventure, action, and hybrid genres. It provided a graph of the genres along the axes of 'immediacy' vs 'complexity', with an 'ideal-zone' for gameplay that covered and linked adventure and action games. It detailed various interaction styles present in these genres and extrapolated to future user interface and gameplay possibilities for these and other genres. Some of these have since been adopted by persistent worlds. For example, [[Second life|Second Life]] uses some of the gameplay investment and interface elements described in section 4 of the paper.<ref>{{cite web|date=July 2000 |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/gdcarchive/2000/index.htm |title=GDC '00: Mostly Armless: Grabbing the 3D World |author=Rees, David |work=Gamasutra |accessdate=2010-06-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029005902/http://www.gamasutra.com/gdcarchive/2000/index.htm |archivedate=October 29, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn a [[University of Queensland]] study, game enjoyment was correlated with attributes such as immersion, social interaction, and the nature of the goals.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sweetser|first=Penelope|author2=Wyeth, P. |title=GameFlow: a model for evaluating player enjoyment in games|journal=[[Computers in Entertainment]]|volume=3|year=2005|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1077253|issue=3|doi=10.1145/1077246.1077253|pages=3}}</ref> These may be underlying factors in differentiating game genres.\n\nStatistical scaling techniques were used in a study presented at the 2007 Siggraph Video Game Symposium to convert subject ratings of game similarity into visual maps of game genres.

Video game genres are not usually defined by the [[Setting (narrative)|setting]] or [[Narrative|story]] of the game or its medium of play, but by the way the player interacts with the game.<ref name=\"adams2013-c3s1\">{{harvnb|Adams|2013|loc=ch. 3 \u00a7 1}}.</ref> For example; a [[first-person shooter]] is still a first-person shooter regardless of whether it takes place in a [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], or [[Military fiction|military]] setting; so long as it features a camera mimicking the perspective of the protagonist ([[First-person (gaming)|first-person]]) and gameplay centered around the use of [[ranged weapon]]ry.\n\nGenres may encompass a wide variety of games, leading to even more specific classifications called ''subgenres''. For example, an [[action game]] can be classified into many subgenres such as [[platform game]]s and [[fighting game]]s. Some games, most notably [[browser game|browser]] and [[mobile game|mobile]] games, are commonly classified into multiple genres.<ref name=\"adams2013-c3s1\" /><ref name=\"adams2013-c3s2\">{{harvnb|Adams|2013|loc=ch. 3 \u00a7 2}}.</ref>\n\nThe following is a list of all commonly defined video game genres, with short descriptions for individual genres and major subgenres.\n\n== Action ==\n{{Main|Action game}}Action games emphasize physical challenges that require [[Hand-eye coordination|hand-eye coordination]] and [[motor skill]] to overcome. They center around the player, who is in control of most of the action. Most of the earliest video games were considered action games; today, it is still a vast genre covering all games that involve physical challenges.\n\nAction games are classified by many subgenres. [[Platform games]] and [[fighting games]] are among the best-known subgenres, while [[shooter games]] became and continue to be one of the dominant genres in video gaming since the 1990s.<ref name=\"adams2014\">{{harvnb|Adams|2014}}.</ref>{{sfn|Wolf|2012|p=572}} Action games usually involve elements of [[twitch gameplay]].<ref name=\"adams2014\" />\n\n=== Platform games ===\n{{Main|Platform game}}\n[[File:FEZ trial gameplay HD.webm|thumb|Platform games feature vertical environments with leaping and climbing between platforms, hence the name ''platform game''.|205x205px]]\nPlatform games (or ''platformers'') have gameplay primarily centered around jumping and climbing to navigate the character's environment. They may have enemies or obstacles to avoid and fight or may just be pure jumping puzzles.

However, some shooters, such as ''[[Splatoon]]'', have non-violent objectives.\n\nShooters, aside from subgenre classifications, can be further classified by their perspective of play.

While setting up a match, players on a team typically must each select a hero who is different from those selected by teammates and, as the match progresses, the players gain experience to unlock more powerful abilities for their hero. Outside of a match, players have the ability to customize the appearance of the heroes but with no other in-game effects. Hero shooters are inspired by the [[multiplayer online battle arena]] genre, and popular team-based shooters like ''[[Team Fortress 2]]''. Examples of hero shooters include ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'', ''[[Paladins (video game)|Paladins]]'', and ''[[Apex Legends]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/271933/Hero_Shooters_Charting_the_rebirth_of_a_genre.php|title=Hero Shooters: Charting the (re)birth of a genre|last=Wawro|first=Alex|date=May 6, 2016|work=[[Gamasutra]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507142751/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/271933/Hero_Shooters_Charting_the_rebirth_of_a_genre.php|archive-date=May 7, 2016|accessdate=May 6, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thegamer.com/overwatch-2-hero-shooter/|title=Overwatch 2 And The Future Of The Hero Shooter|date=2019-07-26|website=TheGamer|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n\n[[Light gun shooter]]s are controlled with a gun-shaped controller; light guns function via a light sensor, hence the name \"light gun\".

Most fighting games feature a large number of playable characters and a competitive multiplayer mode. While most fighting games emphasize hand-to-hand combat,<ref name=\"adams2013-c3s2\" /> some fighting games such as ''[[Soulcalibur]]'' and ''[[Samurai Shodown]]'' center around combat with melee weapons. Many fighting games incorporate heavily emphasized attacks based on various [[martial arts]] systems. Fighting games were one of the dominant genres in video gaming until the late-1990s, where the genre saw a slight decline. This decline was short lived however, for titles such as ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'', ''[[Street Fighter]]'', and ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' dominate the fighter demographic of the modern era.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dunn|first1=Jeff|title=Of Fists and Fatalities: The history of fighting games|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/fists-and-fatalities-history-fighting-games/|website=Gamesradar|accessdate=November 14, 2015|date=2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222211857/http://www.gamesradar.com/fists-and-fatalities-history-fighting-games/|archive-date=December 22, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Different sub-genre games are starting to become more popular though.

While they both involve close-range combat, beat 'em ups put players against large waves of opponents as opposed to a few.<ref name=\"adams2013-c3s2\" /><ref name=\"rogers2014\" /> Beat 'em ups often incorporate mechanics from other action genres and multiplayer in beat 'em up games tends to be [[Cooperative gameplay|co-operative]] rather than competitive.

In a Stealth game, players are usually still able to engage in loud, conspicuous combat, but are often punished for it. Other games, such as ''[[Dishonored]]'', the player can obtain their goal with or without stealth, but stealth is encouraged as the player is at a disadvantage over many of their enemies. The inclusion of stealth as a mechanic in a game does not necessarily make it a Stealth Game. For example, ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim|Skyrim]]'' has an entire perk tree dedicated to \"Sneaking\", but there are few opportunities to use it effectively until the player invests dozens of perks into it, and most of the dungeons in the game are set up in favor of the hack-and-slash strategy that most players adopt.{{original research inline|date=October 2017}}\n\nThe first stealth game was ''Manbiki Shounen'' (''Shoplifting Boy''), published in November 1979.<ref>{{cite book |last=Szczepaniak |first=John |year=2014 |title=The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers |publisher=SMG Szczepaniak |volume=1 |page=7 |isbn=978-0-9929260-3-8 |quote=First ever stealth game, ''Manbiki Shounen''}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/japandvd/japandvd.htm|title=The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers BOOK|website=Hardcore Gaming 101|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908102842/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/japandvd/japandvd.htm|archivedate=2016-09-08}}</ref> The [[PET 2001]] [[personal computer game]] was developed by Hiroshi Suzuki.<ref>{{cite book |last=Szczepaniak |first=John |year=2014 |title=The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers |publisher=SMG Szczepaniak |volume=1 |pages=604\u2013605 |isbn=978-0-9929260-3-8 |quote=SUZUKI, Hiroshi ...

Many are set in procedurally-generated environments, and are open-ended with no set goals. They may overlap with the [[survival horror]] genre, in which the player must survive within a supernatural setting, such as a zombie apocalypse.\n\n=== Battle Royale ===\n{{main|Battle royale game}}\nA battle royale game is a genre that blends the survival, exploration and scavenging elements of a [[survival game]] with [[Last man standing (gaming)|last man standing]] gameplay. Battle royale games challenge a large number of players, starting with minimal equipment, to search for weapons and armor and eliminate other opponents, while trying to stay in safe playable area which shrinks as the time passes, with the winner being the last competitor in the game. Notable battle royale games include ''[[PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds]]'', ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'', ''[[Apex Legends]],'' and ''[[Call of Duty: Warzone]],'' each having received tens of millions of players within months of their releases.\n\n=== Rhythm games ===\n{{main|Rhythm game}}\n[[File:Fretsonfire4.png|thumb|230x230px|''[[Frets on Fire]]'' is a music game.|alt=]]\n'''Rhythm game'''&nbsp;or&nbsp;'''rhythm action'''&nbsp;is a&nbsp;genre&nbsp;of&nbsp;[[Music video game|music-themed]]&nbsp;[[Action game|action video game]]&nbsp;that challenges a player's sense of rhythm.&nbsp;The genre includes dance games such as&nbsp;''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]''&nbsp;and music-based games such as&nbsp;''[[Donkey Konga]]''&nbsp;and&nbsp;''[[Guitar Hero]]''. Games in the genre challenge the player to press buttons at precise times: the screen shows which button the player is required to press, and the game awards points both for accuracy and for synchronization with the beat.\n\n''[[PaRappa the Rapper]]''&nbsp;has been deemed the first influential rhythm game; whose basic template formed the core of subsequent games in the genre. Other popular rhythm games include ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'', [[Maimai (video game)|''Maimai'']], [[Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA|''Project Diva'']], ''[[Cytus]]'', [[Love Live! School Idol Festival|''Love Live: School Idol Festival'']], ''[[The Idolmaster]]'', ''[[osu!]]'', ''[[Taiko no Tatsujin]]'', ''[[Crypt of the Necrodancer]]'', ''[[Rhythm Heaven]]'', etc.\n\n== Action-adventure ==\n{{main|Action-adventure game}}\n\n[[Action-adventure game]]s combine elements of their two component genres, typically featuring long-term obstacles that must be overcome using a tool or item as leverage (which is collected earlier), as well as many smaller obstacles almost constantly in the way, that require elements of action games to overcome. Action-adventure games tend to focus on exploration and usually involve item gathering, simple puzzle solving, and combat. \"Action-adventure\" has become a label which is sometimes attached to games which do not fit neatly into another well known genre. Because of their prevalence on [[video game console]]s and the absence of typical [[adventure game]]s, action-adventure games are often called \"adventure games\" by modern gamers.\n\nOne of the first action-adventure games was the [[Atari 2600]] game ''[[Adventure (Atari 2600)|Adventure]]'' (1980). It was directly inspired by the original [[text adventure]], ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]''. In the process of adapting a text game to a console with only a joystick for control, designer [[Warren Robinett]] created an action-adventure game by incorporating action [[arcade game]] elements.\n\nThe action-adventure later became an established genre with [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]'s ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' (1986), which became a success due to how it combined elements from different genres to create a compelling hybrid, including exploration, [[transport puzzle]]s, adventure-style inventory [[Puzzle game|puzzles]], an action component, a monetary system, and simplified RPG-style level building without the [[experience points]].<ref>{{Cite web |author=Travis Fahs |url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/939/939361p1.html |title=IGN Presents the History of Zelda - Retro Feature at IGN |publisher=Uk.retro.ign.com |date=2010-08-27 |accessdate=2011-01-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602072944/http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/939/939361p1.html |archive-date=June 2, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> The game was also an early example of [[open world]], [[non-linear]] gameplay, and introduced innovations like [[Save file|saving]] on battery backup.

One crucial [[gameplay]] element in many of these games is the low quantity of ammunition, or number of breakable [[melee weapons]]. Notable examples include ''[[Silent Hill]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil]]''.\n\n''[[Nostromo]]'' was the first survival horror game, developed by Akira Takiguchi, a [[Tokyo University]] student and [[Taito]] contractor, for the [[PET 2001]]. It was ported to the [[PC-6001]] by Masakuni Mitsuhashi (also known as Hiromi Ohba, later joined [[Game Arts]]), and published by [[ASCII Corporation|ASCII]] in 1981, exclusively for Japan.<ref>{{cite book |last=Szczepaniak |first=John |year=2014 |title=The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers |publisher=SMG Szczepaniak |volume=1 |pages=544\u2013573 |isbn=978-0-9929260-3-8 }}</ref>\n\n=== Metroidvania ===\n[[Metroidvania]] games are a subgenre of Platformer (named after its two first well-known franchises, ''[[Metroid]]'' and ''[[Castlevania]]'') that feature large interconnected world maps the player can explore, but access to parts of the world is limited by doors or other obstacles that can only be opened after the player has acquired special tools, weapons or abilities within the game. Acquiring such improvements also aids the player in defeating more difficult enemies and locating shortcuts and secret areas, and often includes retracing one's steps across the map. Metroidvanias usually do not consist of any linear gameplay and often involve lots of backtracking - especially after new powerups or tools have been obtained. Bossfights are also a staple of metroidvanias, without which they would be considered puzzle or adventure games {{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}.\n\n== Adventure ==\n{{main|Adventure game}}\n\n[[Adventure game]]s were some of the earliest games created, beginning with the text adventure ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'' in the 1970s. That game was originally titled simply \"Adventure,\" and is the namesake of the genre. Over time, graphics have been introduced to the genre and the interface has evolved.\n\nUnlike adventure films, adventure games are not defined by story or content. Rather, adventure describes a manner of gameplay without reflex challenges or action. They normally require the player to solve various puzzles by interacting with people or the environment, most often in a non-confrontational way. It is considered a \"purist\" genre and tends to exclude anything which includes action elements beyond a [[mini game]].\n\nBecause they put little pressure on the player in the form of action-based challenges or time constraints, adventure games have had the unique ability to appeal to people who do not normally play video games. The genre peaked in popularity with the 1993 release of ''[[Myst]]'', the best-selling PC game of all time up to that point.<ref name=\"best-selling\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/simslivinlarge/news_2857556.html |title=The Sims overtakes Myst |accessdate=2008-03-17 |author=Walker, Trey |date=2002-03-22 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5mVievash?url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/simslivinlarge/news_2857556.html |archive-date=January 3, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> The simple point and click interface, detailed worlds and casual pace made it accessible, and its sense of artistic surrealism caused news outlets such as ''[[Wired Magazine]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', and the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' to declare that the gaming industry had matured.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rothstein, Edward|date=1994-12-04|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E7DD1030F937A35751C1A962958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1|title=A New Art Form May Arise From the 'Myst'|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-03-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115195423/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/04/arts/a-new-art-form-may-arise-from-the-myst.html|archive-date=January 15, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Evenson, Laura|publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|title=Interactive CD-ROMs come of age|date=1994-12-22|page=DAT36}}</ref> It had four proper sequels, but none managed to experience the same level of success.

More accurately, it has become a niche genre. Adventure games are not entirely uncommon, but they tend to be very low budget in anticipation of modest sales. The genre was somewhat rejuvenated with the release of ''[[The Longest Journey]]'' in 1999, which emphasized stronger story elements and more interaction with different characters. A recent resurgence of adventure games on Nintendo consoles might signify a new interest in the genre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20070205/nixon_01.shtml|title=Bring Out Your Dead!

The game produced as a result was mired in controversy and production delays, and to some, signalled the true end of the genre outside of niche markets.\n\n=== Text adventures ===\n\nThe earliest adventure games were text adventures, also known as [[interactive fiction]]. Games such as the popular ''[[Zork]]'' series of the late 1970s and early 1980s allowed the player to use a keyboard to enter commands such as \"get rope\" or \"go west\" while the computer describes what is happening. A great deal of programming went into [[text parser|parsing]] the player's text input.\n\n=== Graphic adventures ===\n\n[[File:Mystery House - Apple II render emulation - 2.png|thumb|250px|right|''[[Mystery House]]'' for the [[Apple II family|Apple II]] was the first adventure game to use graphics in the early [[home computer]] era.]]\n[[Graphic adventure game]]s emerged as graphics became more common. Adventure games began to supplement and later on replace textual descriptions with visuals (for example, a picture of the current location). Early graphic adventure games used text-parsers to input commands. The growing use of [[computer mouse|mice]] led to the \"[[point-and-click]]\" genre of adventure games, where the player would no longer have to type commands. The player could, for example, click on a hand [[icon (computing)|icon]] and then on a rope to pick up the rope.\n\n=== Visual novels ===\n{{main|visual novel}}\n\nA {{Nihongo|[[visual novel]]|\u30d3\u30b8\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u30ce\u30d9\u30eb|bijuaru noberu}} is a game featuring mostly static graphics, usually with [[anime]]-style art. As the name might suggest, they resemble mixed-media novels or [[tableau vivant]] stage plays. Many visual novels track statistics that the player must build in order to advance the plot, and permit a variety of endings, allowing more dynamic reactions to the player's actions than a typical linear adventure plot. Many visual novels are dating sims, including [[bish\u014djo game]]s. Visual novels are especially prevalent in [[Japan]], where they make up nearly 70% of PC games released.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2009-01-23 |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/pressrelease.php?id=1510 |title=AMN and Anime Advanced Announce Anime Game Demo Downloads |publisher=Anime News Network |date=2006-02-08}}</ref> They are rarely produced for video game consoles, but the more popular games are sometimes [[Porting|ported]] to systems such as the [[Dreamcast]] or the [[PlayStation 2]]. The market for visual novels outside Japan, however, was nearly non-existent prior to the success of the [[Nintendo DS]], for which several Japanese visual novels were released in the West, such as the ''[[Ace Attorney]]'' series.\n\n=== Interactive movie ===\n\nThe [[interactive movie]] genre came about with the invention of [[laserdisc]]s. An interactive movie contains pre-filmed [[full motion video|full-motion]] [[cartoon]]s or live-action sequences, where the player controls some of the moves of the main character. For example, when in danger, the player decides which move, action, or combination to choose. In these games, the only activity the player has is to choose or guess the move the [[game designer|designers]] intend him to make. Interactive movies usually differ from games that simply use [[Full motion video based game|full motion video]], FMV, extensively between scenes in that they try to integrate it into the gameplay itself. This has been used in everything from racing games to fighting games. A few adventure game have tried to use the term to liken the storytelling of their games to those in movies, most notably the later ''[[Tex Murphy]]'' games and the more recent ''[[Fahrenheit (2005 video game)|Fahrenheit (Indigo Prophecy)]]'',<ref name=\"1up\">{{cite web|accessdate=2009-01-23 |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&cId=3143998 |title=Indigo Prophecy\u2013Developer's Diary |publisher=1UP |date=2005-09-22 |author=Cage, David |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513025716/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&cId=3143998 |archivedate=2013-05-13 }}</ref> although they are more aptly classified as genre hybrids. Elements of interactive movies have been adapted for game [[cut scene]]s, in the form of [[Quick Time Event]]s, to keep the player alert. Games like ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' present obvious in-game prompts for the player to react to. Not doing so usually results in the player character either getting hurt or outright killed.\n\n=== Real-time 3D adventures ===\n\nAround this time, real-time 3D adventure games appeared. These included ''[[Nightfall (video game)|Nightfall]]'' in 1998, ''[[Shenmue]]'' in 1999, ''[[Myst|realMyst]]'' in 2000, ''[[Shadow of Memories]]'' in 2001, and ''[[Uru: Ages Beyond Myst]]'' in 2003. They augmented traditional adventure gameplay with some of the attributes more commonly associated with action games. For example, freedom of motion and physics-based behavior.\n\n== Role-playing ==\n{{main|Role-playing video game}}\n{{see also|History of role-playing video games}}\n[[File:KQ-hitpoints.png|thumb|right|''KQ'' is a role-playing game]]\n\n[[Role-playing video game]]s draw their gameplay from traditional [not always] [[role-playing game]]s like ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''. Most of these games cast the player in the role of one or more \"adventurers\" who specialize in specific skill sets (such as melee combat or ranged [[Magic (gaming)|magic]] spells) while progressing through a predetermined storyline. Many involve manoeuvring these character(s) through an [[overworld]], usually populated with monsters, that allows access to more important game locations, such as towns, dungeons, and castles. Since the emergence of affordable [[home computer]]s coincided with the popularity of [[paper and pencil game|paper and pencil]] role-playing games, this genre was one of the first in video games and continues to be popular today. Gameplay elements strongly associated with RPG, such as statistical character development through the acquisition of [[experience point]]s, have been widely adapted to other genres such as [[action-adventure game]]s. Though nearly all of the early entries in the genre were [[turn-based game]]s, many modern role-playing games progress in real-time. Thus, the genre has followed the [[strategy game]]'s trend of moving from turn-based to real-time combat. The move to real-time combat began with the release of [[Square (video game company)|Square]]'s (now [[Square Enix]]'s) ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'', the first game to use the [[Final Fantasy battle systems#Active Time Battle|Active Time Battle]] system; this was quickly followed by truly real-time action role-playing games such as the [[Mana (series)|''Mana'' series]], ''[[Soul Blazer]]'' and ''[[Ultima VII]]''. Although older turn-based system still exist, such as the [[Golden Sun (series)|''Golden Sun'']] series for [[Game Boy Advance]] as well as ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]''.\n\n=== Action RPG ===\n[[File:Freedroidrpg basic gameplay.ogv|thumb|left|Video showing basic point and click action RPG gameplay.]]\nThe [[action role-playing game]] or action RPG is a type of [[role-playing video game]] which incorporates real-time combat as opposed to turn-based or menu-based, often borrowing elements from [[action game]]s or [[action-adventure game]]s. Some of the first action role-playing games were produced by [[Nihon Falcom]] in the 1980s, such as the [[Dragon Slayer (series)|''Dragon Slayer'' series]] and [[Ys (video game series)|''Ys'' series]]. Later so-called \"''[[Diablo (video game)|Diablo]]'' clones\" are also part of this genre. Although the precise definition of the genre varies, the typical action RPG features a heavy emphasis on combat, often simplifying or removing non-combat attributes and statistics and the effect they have on the character's development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgdot.com/index.php?hsaction=10053&ID=1007 |title=The Action RPG Revolution |accessdate=2007-03-02 |last=Turner |first=Brian |date=2004-07-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051101204302/http://www.rpgdot.com/index.php?hsaction=10053&ID=1007 |archivedate=November 1, 2005 }}</ref> Additionally, combat always takes place using a real-time system (hence the \"action\") that relies on the player's ability to perform particular actions with speed and accuracy to determine success, rather than mainly using the player character's attributes to determine this.\n\n=== MMORPG ===\n[[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s, or MMORPG, emerged in the mid to late 1990s as a commercial, [[graphical game|graphical]] variant of text-based [[MUD]]s, which had existed since 1978. By and large, MMORPG feature the usual RPG objectives of completing quests and strengthening one's [[player character]], but involve up to hundreds of players interacting with each other on the same persistent world in real-time. The massively multiplayer concept was quickly combined with other genres. Fantasy MMORPG, like ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar]]'', and ''[[The Elder Scrolls Online]]'', remain the most popular type of MMOG, with the most popular \"pay-to-play\" game being ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', and the most popular \"[[free-to-play]]\" games including ''[[RuneScape]]'' and ''[[TERA (video game)|TERA]]'', yet other types of MMORPG are appearing. Sci-fi MMORPG like ''[[Phantasy Star Online]]'' hold a smaller part of the market, with the popular space sci-fi game ''[[EVE Online]]'' being the most notable. Other massively multiplayer online games which do not have a conventional RPG setting include [[Second Life]] and [[Ingress (game)|Ingress]].\n\n=== Roguelikes ===\n[[File:Nethack screenshot.png|thumbnail|left|''[[NetHack]]'' is a roguelike game.  The text display seen here is common in games in the roguelike genre.]]\nThe [[roguelike]] video game subgenre borrows its name and gameplay elements from the 1980 computer game ''[[Rogue (computer game)|Rogue]]''. Superficially, a roguelike is a two-dimensional [[dungeon crawl]] with a high degree of randomness and an emphasis on statistical character development. Though traditionally featuring a text user interface, many such games utilize graphic tiles to overcome character set limitations.\n\n=== Tactical RPG ===\nThe [[tactical role-playing game]] subgenre principally refers to games which incorporate gameplay from [[strategy video game|strategy games]] as an alternative to traditional RPG systems.<ref name=\"EATRPG\">{{cite web |accessdate=2009-01-23 |url=http://www.ea.com/official/lordoftherings/tactics/us/whatis.jsp |title=What is Tactics? |publisher=Electronic Arts |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925180218/http://www.ea.com/official/lordoftherings/tactics/us/whatis.jsp |archive-date=September 25, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> Like standard RPG, the player controls a finite party and battles a similar number of enemies, but this genre incorporates strategic gameplay such as tactical movement on an isometric grid.<ref name=\"EATRPG\"/> The genre has its origins in [[tabletop role-playing game]]s, where each player has time to decide his or her characters' actions.\n\n=== Sandbox RPG ===\nSandbox RPG or [[Open world|Open World RPG]] allow the player a large amount of freedom and usually contain a somewhat more open free-roaming (meaning the player is not confined to a single path restricted by rocks or fences etc.) world. Sandbox RPGs contain similarities to other sandbox games such as the [[Grand Theft Auto]] series, with a large number of interactable non-player characters, large amount of content and typically some of the largest worlds to explore and longest playtimes of all RPG due to an impressive amount of secondary content not critical to the game's main storyline. Sandbox RPG often attempt to emulate an entire region of their setting. Popular examples of this subgenre include the ''[[Dragon Slayer (series)|Dragon Slayer]]'' series by [[Nihon Falcom]], the early ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' games by [[Chunsoft]], ''[[Zelda II]]'' by [[Nintendo]], ''[[Wasteland (video game)|Wasteland]]'' by [[Interplay Entertainment]], the ''[[SaGa (series)|SaGa]]'' and ''[[Mana (series)|Mana]]'' series by [[Squaresoft]], ''[[System Shock 2]]'' by [[Irrational Games]] and [[Looking Glass Studios]], ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'' by [[Ion Storm]], ''[[The Elder Scrolls]]'' and [[Fallout series|''Fallout'' series]] by [[Bethesda Softworks]] and [[Interplay Entertainment]], ''[[Fable (2004 video game)|Fable]]'' by [[Lionhead Studios]], the [[Gothic series|''Gothic'' series]] by [[Piranha Bytes]], and the ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles]]'' series by [[Monolith Soft]].\n\n===JRPG===\nA role-playing game made in Japan but has since encapsulated a new kind of game not just made in Japan. Some games include ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' for the SNES, ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', and many more.\n\n===First-person party-based RPG===\n[[File:DOTGv0.31screenshot.png|thumb|right|Screenshot of ''Damnation of Gods'', a ''Dungeon Master'' clone. All four members of the players's party move around the game world as a single unit in first-person perspective.]]\nAlso known as DRPG (Dungeon RPG), this subgenre consists of RPGs where the player leads a party of adventurers in [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]] through a dungeon or labyrinth, typically in a grid-based environment. Examples include the aforementioned ''Wizardry'', ''Might and Magic'' and ''Bard's Tale'' series; as well as the ''[[Etrian Odyssey (series)|Etrian Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Elminage]]'' series. Games of this type are also known as \"blobbers\", since the player moves the entire party around the playing field as a single unit, or \"blob\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/12/05/the-rpgs-of-2017/ |title=The RPGs of 2017 |last=Cobbett |first=Richard |date=December 5, 2016 |website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun |publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun |access-date=2017-05-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415020146/https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/12/05/the-rpgs-of-2017/ |archive-date=April 15, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/FelipePepe/20150625/244262/CRPG_History_Abridged__21_RPGs_that_brought_something_new_to_the_table.php |title=CRPG History Abridged - 21 RPGs that brought something new to the table |last=Pepe |first=Felipe |date=June 25, 2015 |website=Gamasutra |publisher=UBM |access-date=2017-05-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524090937/http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/FelipePepe/20150625/244262/CRPG_History_Abridged__21_RPGs_that_brought_something_new_to_the_table.php |archive-date=May 24, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMost \"blobbers\" are turn-based, but some titles such as the ''Dungeon Master'', ''[[Legend of Grimrock]]'', and ''[[Eye of the Beholder (video game)|Eye of the Beholder]]'' series are played in real-time. Early games in this genre lack an [[automap]] feature, forcing players to draw their own maps in order to keep track of their progress. Environmental and spatial puzzles are common, meaning players may have to, for instance, move a stone in one part of the level in order to open a gate in another part of the level.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n== Simulation ==\n{{main|Simulation video game}}\n\n[[Simulation video game]]s is a diverse super-category of games, generally designed to closely simulate aspects of a real or fictional reality.\n\n=== Construction and management simulation ===\n{{main|Construction and management simulation}}\n[[File:Lincity-ng.png|thumb|A sample city from ''[[Lincity|Lincity NG]]'']]\n[[Construction and management simulation]]s (or CMS) are a type of simulation game which task players to build, expand or manage fictional communities or projects with limited resources.\n\nIn [[city-building game]]s the player acts as overall planner or leader to meet the needs and wants of game characters by initiating structures for food, shelter, health, spiritual care, economic growth, etc. Success is achieved when the city budget makes a growing profit and citizens experience an upgraded lifestyle in housing, health, and goods. While military development is often included, the emphasis is on economic strength. Perhaps the most known game of this type is ''[[SimCity]]'', which is still popular and has had great influence on later city-building games. ''SimCity'', however, also belongs to the ''God Games'' genre since it gives the player god-like abilities in manipulating the world. [[Caesar (video game)|Caesar]] was a long-running series in this genre, with the original game spawning three sequels.\n\n[[Business simulation game]]s generally attempt to simulate an economy or business, with the player controlling the economy of the game.\n\nA [[government simulation game]] (or \"political game\") involves the simulation of the policies, government or politics of a country, but typically excludes warfare. Recently, these types of games have gained the moniker \"[[serious game]]\".\n\n=== Life simulation ===\n{{main|Life simulation game}}\n\n[[Life simulation game]]s (or artificial life games) involve living or controlling one or more artificial lives. A life simulation game can revolve around individuals and relationships, or it could be a simulation of an ecosystem.\n\nBiological simulations may allow the player to experiment with [[genetics]], [[wikt:survival|survival]] or [[ecosystem]]s, often in the form of an [[Serious game|educational package]]. An early example is ''[[SimLife]]'', while relatively recent ones are ''[[Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis]]'' and ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]''. In other educational simulations such as ''[[Wolf (game)|Wolf]]'', the player \"lives the life\" of an individual animal in a relatively realistic way. Hailed as one of the greatest life simulation games, however, is Creatures, Creatures 2, Creatures 3, where the player breeds generations of a species in a hugely detailed ecosystem.\n\nUnlike other genres of games, [[god game]]s often do not have a set goal that allows a player to win the game. The focus of a god game tends to be control over the lives of people, anywhere from micromanaging a family to overseeing the rise of a civilization.\n\n[[Pet-raising simulation]]s (or [[digital pet]]s) focus more on the relationship between the player and one or few life forms. They are often more limited in scope than other biological simulations. This includes popular examples of [[virtual pets]] such as ''[[Tamagotchi]]'', the ''[[Petz]]'' series, and ''[[Nintendogs]]''.\n\n[[Social simulation game]]s base their gameplay on the [[social interaction]] between multiple artificial lives. The most famous example from this genre is Will Wright's ''[[The Sims]]''. [[Dating sim|Dating sims]] and Romance simulation games fall under this category.\n\n=== Vehicle simulation ===\n{{main|Vehicle simulation game}}\n\n[[Vehicle simulation game]]s are a genre of [[video games]] which attempt to provide the player with a realistic interpretation of operating various kinds of vehicles.<ref name=\"Rollings1\">{{harvnb|Rollings|2003|pp=395\u2013415}}</ref>\n\n[[File:FG-A-10.jpg|thumb|''[[FlightGear]]'' is a flight simulation game.|alt=|230x230px]]\n\nA [[Flight simulation#Flight Simulators at Home|flight simulation]] tasks the player with flying an aircraft, usually an airplane, as realistically as possible. [[Combat flight simulator]]s are the most popular subgenre of simulation. The player controls the plane, not only simulating the act of flying, but also combat situations. There are also civilian flight simulators that do not have the combat aspect.\n\n[[Racing game]]s typically place the player in the driver's seat of a high-performance vehicle and require the player to race against other drivers or sometimes just time. This genre of games is one of the staples of the computer gaming world and many of the earliest computer games created were part of this genre. Emerging in the late 1970s, this genre is still very popular today and continues to push the envelope in terms of graphics and performance. These games \"tend to fall into ''organized racing'' and ''imaginary racing'' categories\". Organized racing simulators attempt to \"reproduce the experience of driving a racing car or motorcycle in an existing racing class: [[Indycar]], [[NASCAR]], [[Formula 1]], and so on.\" On the other hand, imaginary racing games involve \"imaginary situations, driving madly through cities or the countryside or even fantasy environments\". These \"imaginary\" racing games are sometimes called arcade racing games, in contrast to their more realistic \"racing simulation\" counterparts. These include ''[[Need For Speed]]'', ''[[Mario Kart]]'' and ''[[Gran Turismo (series)|Gran Turismo]]''. Rollings and Adams note that \"racing games are often sold in the [[sports game|sports]] category,\" but \"from a [[video game design|design]] standpoint, they really belong in ... vehicle simulations\".<ref name=\"Rollings1\"/>\n\n[[Space flight simulator game]]s are a subgenre that involve piloting a [[spacecraft]]. Space simulators are different from other subgenres, and are not generally considered to be simulators, as their simulated objects do not always exist and often disregard the laws of physics.\n\n[[Train simulator]]s simulate the vehicles, environments and often economics associated with railway transport. These are frequently historical in nature, reminiscing on the evolution and emergence of the railroad in various countries and the economic booms that often accompanied them.\n\n[[Vehicular combat]] or ''car combat'' games focus on fast-paced action, as the player operates a [[car]] or other vehicle and attempts to disable or destroy [[CPU]] or human opponents. Vehicular combat games often allow a player to choose from a variety of potential vehicles, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Vehicular combat was born out of racing/shooter combinations like ''[[Spy Hunter]]'', ''[[RoadBlasters]]'', and ''[[Rock 'N' Roll Racing]]'', but differs in that the players can, if desired, take their vehicles off predefined routes and do battle wherever they please. A subgenre of vehicular combat is ''[[Mecha]]'' combat, where vehicles generally include giant robot-like tanks.\n\n== Strategy ==\n{{main|Strategy video game}}\n\n[[Strategy video game]]s focus on gameplay requiring careful and skillful thinking and planning in order to achieve victory and the action scales from world domination to squad-based tactics. \u201cIn most strategy video games,\u201d says Andrew Rollings, \"the player is given a godlike view of the game world, indirectly controlling the units under his command.\"<ref name=\"Rollings2\">{{harvnb|Rollings|2003|pp=321\u2013345}}</ref> Rollings also notes that \"The origin of strategy games is rooted in their close cousins, board games.\"<ref name=\"Rollings2\"/> Strategy video games generally take one of four archetypal forms, depending on whether the game is '''turn-based or real-time''' and whether the game's focus is upon '''strategy or tactics'''. Real time strategy games are often a multiple unit selection game (multiple game characters can be selected at once to perform different tasks, as opposed to only selecting one character at a time)  with a sky view (view looking down from above) but some recent games such as Tom Clancy's [[EndWar]], are single unit selection and third person view. Like many RPG games, many strategy games are gradually moving away from turn-based systems to more real-time systems.\n\n=== 4X game ===\n{{Main|4X game}}\n[[4X game|4X]] refers to a genre of strategy video game with four primary goals: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate. A 4X game can be [[turn-based]] or [[real-time strategy|real-time]]. Perhaps the best known example of this genre is [[Sid Meier]]'s ''[[Civilization (computer game)|Civilization]]'' series. 4X games often cover a very large period of time, giving the player the control of an entire civilization or species. Typically these games have a historical setting, encompassing a large amount of human history ([[Empire Earth]], Civilization, Golden Age of Civilizations) or a science fiction setting where the player controls a species set to dominate the galaxy ([[Master of Orion]], [[Galactic Civilizations]]).\n\n=== Artillery game ===\n[[File:Scorched 3D 40.1 screenshot 2.jpg|thumb|220x220px|''[[Scorched 3D]]'' is an artillery game.]]\n{{Main|Artillery game}}\n[[Artillery game|Artillery]] is the generic name for early two or three-player (usually [[turn-based]]) computer games involving [[tank]]s fighting each other in combat or similar derivative games. Artillery games were among the earliest computer games developed and can be considered an extension of the original use of computers, which were once used for military-based calculations such as plotting the trajectories of rockets. Artillery games are considered a type of [[turn-based tactics]] game, though they have also been described as a type of \"shooting game.\" Examples of this genre are ''[[Pocket Tanks]]'', ''[[Hogs of War]]'', ''[[Scorched 3D]]'' and the ''[[Worms (series)|Worms]]'' series.\n\n=== {{anchor|Auto battler}}Auto battler (Auto chess) ===\n{{Main|Auto battler}}\n[[Auto battler]], also known as \"auto chess\", is a type of strategy game that features [[chess]]-like elements where players place characters on a grid-shaped battlefield during a preparation phase, who then fight the opposing team's characters without any further direct input from the player.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/08/01/what-is-an-auto-battler/|title=Spawn Point: What on earth is an auto battler?|last1=Cox|first1=Matt|website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803125851/https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/08/01/what-is-an-auto-battler/|archive-date=August 3, 2019|accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref> It was created and popularized by ''[[Dota Auto Chess]]'' in early 2019, and saw more games in the genre by other studios, such as ''[[Teamfight Tactics]]'', ''[[Dota Underlords]]'', and ''[[Hearthstone Battlegrounds]]'' releasing soon after.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/04/a-guide-to-auto-chess-tft-league-of-legends-teamfight-tactics-dota-underlords|title=An Introduction to Auto Chess, Teamfight Tactics and Dota Underlords|last1=Gilroy|first1=Joab|website=IGN|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704045655/https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/04/a-guide-to-auto-chess-tft-league-of-legends-teamfight-tactics-dota-underlords|archive-date=July 4, 2019|accessdate=July 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/a-guide-to-auto-chess-2019-s-most-popular-new-game-gen-1835820155|title=A Guide To Auto Chess, 2019\u2019s Most Popular New Game Genre|last1=Grayson|first1=Nathan|website=Kotaku|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190703221157/https://kotaku.com/a-guide-to-auto-chess-2019-s-most-popular-new-game-gen-1835820155|archive-date=July 3, 2019|accessdate=July 21, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/1/20943670/blizzcon-2019-announcement-hearthstone-battlegrounds-auto-chess|title=Blizzard announces Hearthstone Battlegrounds, a new autobattler set in the Warcraft Universe|last=Goslin|first=Austen|date=2019-11-01|website=Polygon|language=en|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref>\n\n=== Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) ===\n{{Main|Multiplayer online battle arena}}\n[[File:Vainglory Halcyon Fold map.tif|thumb|281x281px|''[[Vainglory (video game)|Vainglory]]'' is a multiplayer online battle arena game designed for smartphones and tablets.|alt=]]\n[[Multiplayer online battle arena]] (MOBA) is a genre of strategy video games that originated as a subgenre of [[real-time strategy]] in which each player controls a single character in a team to compete with another team of players. The objective is to destroy the opposing team's main structure with the assistance of computer-controlled units, which periodically [[Spawning (gaming)|spawn]] in groups at the base and marching down predefined paths (called \"lanes\") toward the enemy base. Every [[player character]] typically has its own diverse kit with unique abilities, design, strengths, and weaknesses. Player characters grow in power over the course of a match and learn new thematic abilities, which contribute to a team's overall strategy. Multiplayer online battle arena games are a fusion of [[real-time strategy games]], [[Role-playing video game|role-playing games]], and [[Action game|action games]], though players usually do not construct either buildings or units.\n\nThe genre gained popularity in the 2010s, with ''[[Defense of the Ancients]]'' mod for ''[[Warcraft III]]'', ''[[League of Legends]]'', ''[[Dota 2]]'', ''[[Heroes of the Storm]]'', and ''[[Smite (video game)|Smite]]'' being popular.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.progamerreview.com/best-moba-games/|title=Best Modern MOBA Games - LoL, Dota 2, HotS & Smite Compared|last=Amstrup|first=Johannes|last2=ersen|date=2017-09-15|website=Pro Gamer Reviews|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-19}}</ref> MOBA games are also well-represented in [[esports]] with the prize pool of over 60 million dollars in 2018, which is about 40% of the total esports prize pools in the same year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/konvoy/esports-prize-pools-155-9m-2018-ce1ff44bd41|title=Esports Prize Pools: $155.9M (2018)|last=Hurst|first=Taylor|date=2019-02-12|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Real-time strategy (RTS) ===\n{{Main|Real-time strategy}}\nThe moniker \"[[real-time strategy]]\" (RTS), usually applied only to certain computer strategy games, (however, this genre is probably the most well known of strategy games and is what most websites mean when they say \"strategy games\") indicates that the action in the game is continuous, and players will have to make their decisions and actions within the backdrop of a constantly changing game state. Real-time strategy gameplay is characterised by obtaining resources, building bases, researching technologies and producing units. Blizzard Entertainment's ''[[Starcraft]]'' is a popular RTS played competitively in South Korea and televised to large audiences. Other notable games include the [[Warcraft (series)|''Warcraft'' series]], [[Age of Empires|''Age of Empires'' series]], ''[[Dawn of War]]'', ''[[Command and Conquer]]'', and ''[[Dune II]]'' (essentially the first RTS game). Outside of PCs, very few strategy games are real-time; a few examples are ''[[Battle for Middle-earth II]]'', ''[[Pikmin]]'' and ''[[Halo Wars]]''. Even fewer ones use physical pieces, such as ''[[Icehouse (game)|Icehouse]]''.\n\n=== Real-time tactics (RTT) ===\n{{Main|Real-time tactics}}\n[[Real-time tactics]] (abbreviated RTT<ref name=\"ign-stateoftherts\">{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/700/700747p3.html|title=The State of the RTS|work=[[IGN]]|date=April 7, 2006|accessdate=September 14, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624224943/http://pc.ign.com/articles/700/700747p3.html|archive-date=June 24, 2006|url-status=live}}(Article at IGN discussing their perception of RTS and related genres as of 2006.

It is also sometimes considered a subgenre of [[real-time strategy]], and thus may in this context exist as an element of gameplay or as a basis for the whole game. It is differentiated from [[real-time strategy]] gameplay by the lack of resource [[micromanagement]] and base or unit building, as well as the greater importance of individual units<ref name=\"ign-stateoftherts\"/><ref name=splanet>{{cite web | title =Point - CounterPoint: Resource Collection vs. Fixed Units | publisher =StrategyPlanet | url =http://www.strategyplanet.com/features/articles/pcp-resources/ | accessdate =2007-11-04 | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071231194439/http://www.strategyplanet.com/features/articles/pcp-resources/ | archivedate =2007-12-31 }}</ref> and a focus on complex battlefield tactics. Example titles include ''[[Warhammer: Dark Omen]]'', ''[[World In Conflict]]'', the ''[[Close Combat (game)|Close Combat]]'' series, and early [[tactical role-playing game]]s such as ''[[Bokosuka Wars]]'', ''[[Kure Software Koubou|Silver Ghost]]'', and ''First Queen''.\n\n=== Tower defense ===\n{{Main|Tower defense}}\n[[Tower defense]] games have a very simple layout. Usually, computer-controlled monsters called ''creeps'' move along a set path, and the player must place, or \"build\" towers along this path to kill the creeps. In some games, towers are placed along a set path for creeps, while in others towers can interrupt creep movement and change their path. In most tower defense games different towers have different abilities such as poisoning enemies or slowing them down. The player is awarded money for killing creeps, and this money can be used to buy more towers, or buy upgrades for a tower such as increased power or range.\n\n=== Turn-based strategy (TBS) ===\n{{Main|Turn-based strategy}}\n[[File:Battle for wesnoth version 1.12.0 screenshot.jpg|thumb|235x235px|''[[The Battle for Wesnoth]]'' is a turn-based strategy game.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2009-01-23 |url=http://pc.ign.com/objects/142/14240090.html |title=The Battle for Wesnoth |publisher=IGN |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205044129/http://pc.ign.com/objects/142/14240090.html |archive-date=December 5, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>]]\nThe term [[turn-based strategy]] (TBS) is usually reserved for certain computer strategy games, to distinguish them from real-time strategy games. A player of a turn-based game is allowed a period of analysis before committing to a game action, and some games allow a certain number of moves or actions to take place in a turn. Like real-time strategy games, this genre can include many strategy games which are not solely turn-based games, and games which may contain other features not related to whether the game is turn-based or not. Examples of this genre are the ''[[Civilization computer game|Civilization]]'', ''[[Heroes of Might and Magic]]'', ''[[Making History (game)|Making History]],'' and ''[[Master of Orion]]''.\n\nSome recent turn-based strategy games feature a different gameplay mechanic, with a simultaneous resolution of the turns, every player preparing their future actions in the planning phase, then letting the game follow the orders given at the same time, causing orders to be interrupted by the opponent(s) actions, changing the gameplay from reacting to the opponent's action into guessing them.\n\n=== Turn-based tactics (TBT) ===\n{{Main|Turn-based tactics}}\nThe gameplay of [[turn-based tactics]] games (TBT) is characterized by the expectation of players to complete their tasks using the combat forces provided to them, and usually by the provision of a realistic (or at least believable) representation of military tactics and operations. Examples of this genre include the ''[[Wars (series)|Wars]]'', ''[[Jagged Alliance]]'' and ''[[X-COM]]'' series, as well as [[tactical role-playing game]]s such as the ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]''.\n\n=== Wargame ===\n{{Main|Wargame (video games)}}\n[[Wargame (video games)|Wargames]] are a [[subgenre]] of [[strategy video game]]s that emphasize strategic or tactical warfare on a map. Wargames generally take one of four archetypal forms, depending on whether the game is turn-based or real-time and whether the game's focus is upon [[military strategy]] or [[military tactics|tactics]].\n\n=== Grand strategy wargame ===\n{{Main|Grand strategy wargame}}\nA [[grand strategy wargame]] is a [[Wargaming|wargame]] that places focus on [[grand strategy]]: military [[strategy]] at the level of movement and use of an entire [[nation state]] or [[empire]]'s resources.\n\n== Sports ==\nSports are video games that simulate [[sports]]. This opposing team(s) can be controlled by other real life people or artificial intelligence.\n\n=== Racing ===\nOne competes against time or opponents using some means of transportation. Sub-genres include [[Sim racing|racing simulators]] (''[[Gran Turismo (series)|Gran Turismo]]'') and [[kart racing game|kart racing]] (''[[Mario Kart]]'').\n\n=== Sports game ===\n[[Sports game]]s emulate the playing of traditional physical [[sports]]. Some emphasize actually playing the sport, while others emphasize the strategy behind the sport (such as ''[[Championship Manager series|Championship Manager]]''). Others satirize the sport for comic effect (such as ''[[Arch Rivals]]''). One of the best selling series in this genre is the ''[[FIFA (video game series)|FIFA]]'' series. This genre emerged early in the history of video games (e.g., ''[[Pong]]'') and remains popular today.\n\n=== Competitive ===\nGames that have high competitive factor but does not represent any traditional sports or the concept is fictional designed by the developer (e.g. [[Ball Jacks]]).\n\n=== Sports-based fighting ===\n\nSports-based fighting games are titles that fall firmly within the definitions of both the Fighting game and Sports game genre, such as boxing and wrestling video games. As such, they are usually put in their own separate subgenres. Often the fighting is far more realistic than in traditional fighting games (though the amount of realism can greatly vary), and many feature real-world franchises or fighters. Examples of this include the [[Fight Night (EA video game series)|''Fight Night'']], ''[[UFC (video game)|UFC]]'' and ''[[WWE 2K]]'' series.\n\n== Other notable genres ==\n\n=== Board game or card game ===\nMany popular [[board game]]s and [[card game]]s have computer versions. [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] opponents can help improve one's skill at traditional games. [[Computer chess|Chess]], [[Draughts|Checkers]], Othello (also known as [[Reversi]]), and [[Backgammon]] have world class computer programs. [[Mahjong]] and related games are immensely popular in [[China]] and [[Japan]]. [[Go (game)|Go]] is popular in [[East Asia]], though it is notoriously difficult to program a [[Computer Go|computer to play Go]] well. \n\n=== Casual games ===\nCasual games are designed to be easily picked up and put down again, allowing for potentially short bursts of play, such as ''Call of Duty'' and most games on a mobile platform. This genre of gaming is meant to be a short and relaxing pastime, a rest in between other occupations and so is most popular with demographics who have less free time. For this reason the games often have auto-saving and syncing as standard so the games can be minimised, put into sleep or otherwise put down with no loss to the player. Market leaders in this genre are often boldly coloured, designed for intuitive interaction and have a high balance of reward to time to keep people coming back. Designers of these games should add a lot of \"juice\" (sound and motion elements that excite the senses) to make them stand out in a sea of highly similar games.\n\nDue to the aforementioned requirements, many of these games are quite simple to pick up and play without lengthy tutorials. Retaining players involves a lot of careful design of levels, challenges and events.\n\n=== Digital collectible card game ===\nA [[digital collectible card game]] (DCCG) is a computer or video game usually played online that emulates [[Collectible card game|collectible card games]] (CCG), or in many cases, doesn't use card-like images at all, but instead [[Icons (computing)|icons]], [[Avatar (computing)|avatars]] or other symbols to represent game pieces. Originally, DCCGs started out as replications of a CCG's physical counterpart such as ''[[Magic: The Gathering]],'' but many DCCGs have foregone a physical version and exclusively release as a video game, such as with ''[[Hearthstone]]''.\n\n=== Logic game ===\nLogic games require the player to solve [[logic]] puzzles or navigate complex locations such as [[maze]]s. They are well suited to [[Casual game|casual play]], and [[Tile-matching video game|tile-matching puzzle games]] are among the most popular casual games. This genre frequently crosses over with adventure and educational games. ''[[Tetris]]'', labeled a puzzle game, is credited for revolutionizing gaming and popularizing the puzzle genre.\n\n=== MMO ===\n{{Main|Massively multiplayer online game}}\nA [[massively multiplayer online game]] (also called MMO and MMOG) is a [[multiplayer video game]] which is capable of supporting large numbers of players simultaneously. By necessity, they are played on the [[Internet]]. Many games have at least one [[persistent world]], however others just have large numbers of players competing at once in one form or another without any lasting effect to the world at all. These games can be found for most network-capable platforms, including the [[personal computer]], [[video game console]], or [[smartphone]]s and other mobile devices.\n\nMMO games can enable players to cooperate and compete with each other on a large scale, and sometimes to interact meaningfully with people around the world. They include a variety of gameplay types, representing many video game genres, an example is the widely played game ''[[Minecraft]]'' which can be played both as an MMO or a single player game.\n\n===Mobile game===\nMobile games are played on devices like phones and tablets, and are usually easy games for casual gamers.\nGames like ''[[Candy Crush Saga]]'' and ''[[Angry Birds]]'' are mobile games. Some mobile games are ported from consoles or computers,\nlike ''[[Minecraft]]'', ''[[Plants vs Zombies]]'', and ''[[Fortnite]]''. Mobile games are usually made for casual gamers and\ncan be played and completed easily, so they can be played by people of all ages.\n\n=== Party game ===\n[[Party games#Party video games|Party games]] are video games developed specifically for multiplayer games between many players. Normally, party games have a variety of [[mini-game]]s that range between collecting more of a certain item than other players or having the fastest time at something. Such games include the ''[[Mario Party]]'' series, ''[[Crash Bash]]'', and ''[[Rayman Raving Rabbids]]''. Versus multiplayer games are not generally considered to be party games.\n\n=== Programming game ===\nA [[programming game]] is a [[computer game]] where the player has no direct influence on the course of the game. Instead, a [[computer program]] or script is written in some [[domain-specific programming language]] in order to control the actions of the characters (usually [[robot]]s, [[tank]]s or [[bacteria]], which seek to destroy each other). In ''[[SpaceChem]]'', for example, players design circuits used for creating molecules from raw materials. ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]'' also includes some elements of a programming game, as the player creates the AI of his characters, although the player can also choose to directly control the action.\n\n=== Trivia game ===\n[[Trivia]] games are growing in popularity, especially on [[mobile phone]]s where people may only have a few minutes to play the game. In trivia games, the object is to answer questions with the goal of obtaining points. They may be based on real-life trivia game shows such as ''[[Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?]]'' or ''[[Family Feud]]''.\n\n==Idle gaming==\n{{Main|Incremental game}}\nIn an [[IGN]] article, ''[[Cookie Clicker]]'' is credited as one of the few games to have played a major role in the establishment of the genre of idle gaming.<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web |url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2013/10/10/inside-cookie-clicker-and-the-idle-game-movement |title=Inside Cookie Clicker and the Idle Game Move |last=Davis |first=Justin |publisher=IGN |date=October 10, 2013 |accessdate=April 2, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630202207/http://ca.ign.com/articles/2013/10/10/inside-cookie-clicker-and-the-idle-game-movement |archive-date=June 30, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThis genre involves games that orient the player with a trivial task, such as clicking a cookie; and as the game progresses, the player is gradually rewarded certain upgrades for completing said task. In all, these games require very little involvement from the player, and in most cases they play themselves; hence the use of the word \"[[idle]]\".\n\nIn early 2014, Orteil released an early version of ''Idle Game Maker'', a tool allowing customized idle games to be made without coding knowledge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/idlegamemaker/help |title=Idle Game Maker Documentation |publisher=Orteil.dashnet.org |accessdate=2014-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714142951/http://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/idlegamemaker/help |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Video game genres by purpose ==\n\nWhile most video games are designed as entertainment, many video games are designed with additional purposes. These purposes are as varied as the nature of information itself\u2014to inform, persuade, or stimulate. These games can have any kind of gameplay, from puzzles to action to adventure.\n\n=== Advergame ===\n{{main|Advergame}}\n[[Advergame]]s, in the context of video game genres, refers to promotional software specifically made to advertise a product, organization or viewpoint. The first advergames were distributed on floppy disk by the [[Chef Boyardee]], [[Coca-Cola]], and [[Samsung]] brands,<ref name=gamedaily>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/features/dunkin-for-advergames/68443/?biz=1 |title=Dunkin' for Advergames |access-date=January 24, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230013119/http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/features/dunkin-for-advergames/68443/?biz=1 |archive-date=December 30, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> while the first cereal box advergame was [[Chex Quest]] in 1996.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.joystiq.com/2008/04/18/ask-joystiq-chex-quest-he-man-and-broken-360-gamepads/ | title = Ask Joystiq: Chex Quest, He-Man and broken 360 gamepads | publisher = Joystiq | author = Ross Miller | date = April 18, 2008 | accessdate = 2008-07-16 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080517003720/http://www.joystiq.com/2008/04/18/ask-joystiq-chex-quest-he-man-and-broken-360-gamepads/ | archive-date = May 17, 2008 | url-status = dead }}</ref> The majority of advergames are found online and mostly include simple and cheaply made [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] games. Some advergames were released to consoles, like [[Pepsiman (video game)|Pepsiman]] for Sony PlayStation.\n\n=== Art game ===\n{{main|Art game}}\n[[Art game]]s are designed so as to emphasize art or whose structures are intended to produce some kind of non-[[ludology|ludological]] reaction in its audience. Art games typically go out of their way to have a unique, unconventional look, often standing out for aesthetic beauty or complexity in design. This concept extends to the realm of modified (\"modded\") gaming when modifications have been made to existing non-art-games to produce graphic results intended to be viewed as an artistic display, as opposed to modifications intended to change game play scenarios or for storytelling. Modified games created for artistic purposes are sometimes referred to as \"[[videogame art]].\"\n\n=== Casual game ===\n{{main|Casual game}}\n[[Casual game]]s have very simple rules or play techniques and a very low degree of strategy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6186207.html?tag=result;title;0 |title=GDC '08: Are casual games the future? |last=Boyes |first=Emma |date=2008-02-18 |publisher=GameSpot |accessdate=2009-01-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711072428/http://uk.gamespot.com/news/6186207.html?tag=result%3Btitle%3B0 |archivedate=2011-07-11 }}</ref> They also require no long-term time commitment or special skills to play, making them easy to learn and play as a pastime.

The purpose of the casual game is to entertain, but with a much lower commitment than other video games.\n\n=== Christian game ===\n{{main|Christian video games}}\n[[Christian video games|Christian games]] attempt to provide the dual purposes of spreading the [[Christianity|Christian religion]] to non-believers through the medium of video games, and providing gamers who identify as Christian with a common pool of games. Christian video games were first developed by [[Wisdom Tree]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], without license. While largely regarded as derivative titles by the mainstream gaming culture,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Christian games have nevertheless expanded in distribution since their inception.\n\n=== Educational game ===\n{{main|Educational game}}\n[[Educational game]]s, as the name implies, attempt to teach the user using the game as a vehicle. Most of these types of games target young users from the ages of about three years to mid-[[teen]]s;{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} past the mid-teens, subjects become so complex (e.g. [[Calculus]]) that teaching via a game is impractical.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Numerous subgenres exist, in fields such as math or typing.\n\n=== Esports ===\n{{main|Esports}}\n[[Esports]] games are [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] games that are usually played competitively at the professional level. These games are often targeted at the \"hardcore\" gaming audience, and are usually [[first-person shooter]] games, requiring twitch-based reaction speed and coordination, or [[real-time strategy]] games, requiring high levels of strategic macro- and micromanagement, or [[MOBA]]s, requiring both.\n\n=== Exergame ===\n{{main|Exergaming}}\nAn [[Exergaming|exergame]] ([[Portmanteau word|portmanteau]] of \"[[exercise]]\" and \"[[video game|game]]\") is a video game that provides exercise. \"Exergames\" sub-divide into two main implementations, those with a game specifically designed to use an exercise input device (for example, the game ''[[Wii Fit]]'' using the [[Wii Balance Board]]) and those implementations using a genre of a game. Games fit into the category of entertainment, and similarly \"exergames\" are a category of \"exertainment\" (formed from \"[[exercise]]\" and \"[[entertainment]]\"). \"Exertainment\" refers to one aspect of adding entertainment to an exercise workout.\n\n=== Personalized game ===\n{{main|Personalized video game}}\n[[Personalized video game|Personalized games]] are created for one specific player or a group of players usually as a gift. They are hand-made to feature real names, places and events from the recipient's life. Usual occasions for such games are birthdays, anniversaries, and engagement proposals.\n\n=== Serious game ===\n{{main|Serious game}}\n[[Serious game]]s are intended to educate or train the player. These games tend to promote \"education, science, social change, health care or even the military.\"<ref name=serious>{{cite web |accessdate=2009-01-23 |url=http://www.cnet.com.au/games/0,239029232,240061367,00.htm |title=What's wrong with serious games? |publisher=CNET |date=2006-03-23 |author=Terdiman, Daniel |authorlink=Daniel Terdiman |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323102029/http://www.cnet.com.au/games/0,239029232,240061367,00.htm |archive-date=March 23, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Some of these games have no specific ending or goal in the game. Rather, the player learns a real life lesson from the game. For example, games from [[website]]s such as Newsgaming.com and gamesforchange.org raise political issues using the distinct properties of games.\n\n== Scientific studies ==\n\nAs video games are increasingly the subject of scientific studies, game genres are themselves becoming a subject of study.\n\nAn early attempt at analysis of the action and adventure genres appeared in a Game Developers Conference 2000 paper 'Mostly Armless: Grabbing the 3D World'. This critiqued a variety of adventure and action games to categorize gameplay and interaction for adventure, action, and hybrid genres. It provided a graph of the genres along the axes of 'immediacy' vs 'complexity', with an 'ideal-zone' for gameplay that covered and linked adventure and action games. It detailed various interaction styles present in these genres and extrapolated to future user interface and gameplay possibilities for these and other genres. Some of these have since been adopted by persistent worlds. For example, [[Second life|Second Life]] uses some of the gameplay investment and interface elements described in section 4 of the paper.<ref>{{cite web|date=July 2000 |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/gdcarchive/2000/index.htm |title=GDC '00: Mostly Armless: Grabbing the 3D World |author=Rees, David |work=Gamasutra |accessdate=2010-06-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029005902/http://www.gamasutra.com/gdcarchive/2000/index.htm |archivedate=October 29, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn a [[University of Queensland]] study, game enjoyment was correlated with attributes such as immersion, social interaction, and the nature of the goals.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sweetser|first=Penelope|author2=Wyeth, P. |title=GameFlow: a model for evaluating player enjoyment in games|journal=[[Computers in Entertainment]]|volume=3|year=2005|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1077253|issue=3|doi=10.1145/1077246.1077253|pages=3}}</ref> These may be underlying factors in differentiating game genres.\n\nStatistical scaling techniques were used in a study presented at the 2007 Siggraph Video Game Symposium to convert subject ratings of game similarity into visual maps of game genres.

The plot follows the protagonist William Johnson, a [[Yale]] student who works during the summer alternately for the two paleontologists.\n\n== Plot Summary ==\n\nWilliam Johnson is an irresponsible student studying at Yale college. He makes a bet with his rival, a student named Marlin, that he will go west the following summer. Johnson then attempts to join Prof. Othniel Charles Marsh on his yearly expedition fossil hunting in the Badlands. Marsh is reluctant until Johnson lies, saying that he is a photographer.\nJohnson learns to take photographs and leaves with Marsh at the appointed time. However, upon learning of Johnson's Philadelphia background, Marsh begins to suspect that he is a spy for Edward Drinker Cope, a rival paleontologist. Marsh abandons Johnson in Cheyenne.\n\nShortly thereafter, Johnson meets Cope, who invites him to join his expedition. They head out west, despite Marsh's attempts to discredit and stop them. They are finally forced to stop in Fort Benton, when news of Custer's defeat at the hands of Sitting Bull causes a ban on travel into Montana. Even so, Cope's group manages to sneak away from the Fort. \nWhen they arrive in the Judith Basin, they immediately begin to dig for fossil bones. They remain there for several months. Marsh attempts to spy on them and poison their water, but leaves after Cope's group lures him into camp and fires at him.\nAt the end of the summer, they leave for Fort Benton. As they have too many bones with them for a single trip, they leave half of the bones at camp, intending to retrieve them on the second trip.\n\nJohnson volunteers to lead the second trip, and is accompanied by a fellow student named Toad, a snake scout named Little Wind, and the teamster, Cookie. As they approach the camp, they see the fires of the Sioux army in the distance. Cookie and Little Wind desert Johnson and Toad, leaving them with the wagon. They decide to carry on and retrieve the bones anyway, and are pursued by Sioux warriors on horseback. They come across Little Wind, and manage to escape by driving the wagon into the badlands, but Toad is killed in the process. Meanwhile, at fort Benton, Cookie arrives with several arrows stuck in him, and dies. Cope assumes that Johnson is dead, and telegrams his parents.\nJohnson and Little Wind drive the Wagon east, hoping to put distance between themselves and the Sioux. Little Wind dies of blood loss. Eventually, Johnson arrives, barely alive, in the town of Deadwood Gulch.\n\nJohnson sets up a photography studio in order to earn money to pay for a stagecoach fare to Fort Laramie. The residents of the Town become convinced that his boxes of bones in fact contain gold. Tensions rise, and, fearing that he will be robbed, Johnson buries the bones. This infuriates a local outlaw named Black Dick Curry, who had been planning to steal the boxes. He challenges Johnson to a duel, which Johnson wins. An injured Curry swears revenge and flees the town.\nJohnson raises enough money for the coach and prepares to leave. He offers half of his bones to Wyatt and Morgan Earp in exchange for guarding the coach on its journey, as he suspects that Dick Curry will try to rob it on the way to Laramie. He is proven to be correct, and Dick tries twice to rob the coach, but is unsuccessful. When they arrive in Laramie, Johnson discovers that Wyatt made a deal with Marsh to sell half of Johnson's bones. While they bargain, Johnson removes the bones from the boxes and replaces them with rocks.\nJohnson then continues on to Cheyenne, and eventually arrives back in Philadelphia, much to the surprise of his parents and of Cope. He turns the bones over to Cope.\nFinally, he returns to Yale to claim his winnings from Marlin. <ref>{{Citation|last=Crichton, Michael, 1942-2008, author.|title=Dragon teeth|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1126539741|isbn=978-1-4607-9361-9|oclc=1126539741|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n== Notable characters ==\n\n* [[Edward Drinker Cope]]\n* [[Othniel Charles Marsh]]\n* William Johnson\n* [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aux.avclub.com/michael-crichton-s-resurrected-dragon-teeth-should-ve-s-1798191407|title= Michael Crichton's resurrected Dragon Teeth should've stayed preserved in amber '|website=[[The A.V.

The plot follows the protagonist William Johnson, a [[Yale]] student who works during the summer alternately for the two paleontologists.\n\n== Plot Summary ==\n\nWilliam Johnson is an irresponsible student studying at Yale college. He makes a bet with his rival, a student named Marlin, that he will go west the following summer. Johnson then attempts to join Prof. Othniel Charles Marsh on his yearly expedition fossil hunting in the Badlands. Marsh is reluctant until Johnson lies, saying that he is a photographer.\nJohnson learns to take photographs and leaves with Marsh at the appointed time. However, upon learning of Johnson's Philadelphia background, Marsh begins to suspect that he is a spy for Edward Drinker Cope, a rival paleontologist. Marsh abandons Johnson in Cheyenne.\nShortly thereafter, Johnson meets Cope, who invites him to join his expedition. They head out west, despite Marsh's attempts to discredit and stop them. They are finally forced to stop in Fort Benton, when news of Custer's defeat at the hands of Sitting Bull causes a ban on travel into Montana. Even so, Cope's group manages to sneak away from the Fort. \nWhen they arrive in the Judith Basin, they immediately begin to dig for fossil bones. They remain there for several months. Marsh attempts to spy on them and poison their water, but leaves after Cope's group lures him into camp and fires at him.\nAt the end of the summer, they leave for Fort Benton. As they have too many bones with them for a single trip, they leave half of the bones at camp, intending to retrieve them on the second trip.\nJohnson volunteers to lead the second trip, and is accompanied by a fellow student named Toad, a snake scout named Little Wind, and the teamster, Cookie. As they approach the camp, they see the fires of the Sioux army in the distance. Cookie and Little Wind desert Johnson and Toad, leaving them with the wagon. They decide to carry on and retrieve the bones anyway, and are pursued by Sioux warriors on horseback. They come across Little Wind, and manage to escape by driving the wagon into the badlands, but Toad is killed in the process. Meanwhile, at fort Benton, Cookie arrives with several arrows stuck in him, and dies. Cope assumes that Johnson is dead, and telegrams his parents.\nJohnson and Little Wind drive the Wagon east, hoping to put distance between themselves and the Sioux. Little Wind dies of blood loss. Eventually, Johnson arrives, barely alive, in the town of Deadwood Gulch.\nJohnson sets up a photography studio in order to earn money to pay for a stagecoach fare to Fort Laramie. The residents of the Town become convinced that his boxes of bones in fact contain gold. Tensions rise, and, fearing that he will be robbed, Johnson buries the bones. This infuriates a local outlaw named Black Dick Curry, who had been planning to steal the boxes. He challenges Johnson to a duel, which Johnson wins. An injured Curry swears revenge and flees the town.\nJohnson raises enough money for the coach and prepares to leave. He offers half of his bones to Wyatt and Morgan Earp in exchange for guarding the coach on its journey, as he suspects that Dick Curry will try to rob it on the way to Laramie. He is proven to be correct, and Dick tries twice to rob the coach, but is unsuccessful. When they arrive in Laramie, Johnson discovers that Wyatt made a deal with Marsh to sell half of Johnson's bones. While they bargain, Johnson removes the bones from the boxes and replaces them with rocks.\nJohnson then continues on to Cheyenne, and eventually arrives back in Philadelphia, much to the surprise of his parents and of Cope. He turns the bones over to Cope.\nFinally, he returns to Yale to claim his winnings from Marlin. <ref>{{Citation|last=Crichton, Michael, 1942-2008, author.|title=Dragon teeth|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1126539741|isbn=978-1-4607-9361-9|oclc=1126539741|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n== Notable characters ==\n\n* [[Edward Drinker Cope]]\n* [[Othniel Charles Marsh]]\n* William Johnson\n* [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aux.avclub.com/michael-crichton-s-resurrected-dragon-teeth-should-ve-s-1798191407|title= Michael Crichton's resurrected Dragon Teeth should've stayed preserved in amber '|website=[[The A.V.

It is the principal city of the Battle Creek, Michigan [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA), which encompasses all of Calhoun County. As of the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]], the city had a total population of 52,347, while the MSA's population was 136,146.\n\n==History and name origin==\nIn about 1774, the [[Potawatomi]] and the Ottawa [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes formed a joint village near the future Battle Creek, Michigan.<ref>R. David Edmonds, ''The Potawatomis: Keepers of the Fire'' (Norman:University of Oklahoma, 1978), p. 99</ref>\n\nBattle Creek was named for a minor encounter on March 14, 1824, between a federal government land survey party led by Colonel [[John Mullett]] and two Potawatomi Indians, who had approached the survey camp asking for [[food]]. They were hungry because the Army was late in delivering the supplies promised them by the treaty of 1820. After a protracted discussion, the Native Americans allegedly tried to steal food. One of the surveyors grabbed his rifle and shot one of the Potawatomi, seriously wounding him. Following the encounter, the surveyors retreated to Detroit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagebattlecreek.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=58&Itemid=61|title=A Brief History of Battle Creek|first=|last=Administrator|website=www.heritagebattlecreek.org}}</ref>\n \nSurveyors would not return to the area until June 1825, after Governor [[Lewis Cass]] had settled the issues with the Native Americans. Early white settlers called the nearby stream the [[Battle Creek River]], and the town took its name from that.<ref name=\"Peirce\">{{cite book |last=Peirce |first=Henry B. |title=History of Calhoun county, Michigan |origyear=1877 |url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/bad0868.0001.001 |accessdate=January 25, 2008 |year=2005 |publisher=University of Michigan Library |location=Ann Arbor, Mich. |page=79 |chapter=The City of Battle Creek |chapterurl=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=micounty;cc=micounty;idno=bad0868.0001.001;size=l;frm=frameset;seq=119 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.rootsweb.com/~micalhou/battlecreek.htm History of Battle Creek Township and City], Calhoun County MIGenWen (Michigan Genealogy on the Web), accessed January 25, 2008</ref><ref name=\"Romig\">{{cite book | last = Romig | first = Walter | year = 1986 | title = Michigan Place Names | origyear= 1973 | publisher = Wayne State University Press | location = Detroit, Michigan | isbn = 0-8143-1838-X}}</ref><ref>[http://ci.battle-creek.mi.us/Community/History.htm Battle Creek history page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927161649/http://ci.battle-creek.mi.us/Community/History.htm |date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.willard.lib.mi.us/bc.html A Thumbnail History of Battle Creek and Calhoun County, Michigan], Willard Library.

Migration had increased to Michigan from New York and New England following the completion of the [[Erie Canal]] in New York in 1824. Most settlers chose to locate on the Goguac prairie, which was fertile and easily cultivated.  A post office was opened in Battle Creek in 1832 under Postmaster Pollodore Hudson.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FS7nJ3FOAIC&pg=PA16 History and Direction of Calhoun County] Accessed January 20, 2011</ref> The first school was taught in a small [[log house]] about 1833 or 1834.  Asa Langley built the first [[sawmill]] in 1837.  A brick manufacturing plant, called the oldest enterprise in the township, was established in 1840 by Simon Carr and operated until 1903.

It was the site of a Protestant church founding convention in 1863. The denomination's first hospital, college, and publishing office would also be constructed in the city. When the hospital and publishing office burned down in 1902, the church elected to decentralize, and most of its institutions were relocated. The first Adventist church (rebuilt in the 1920s) is still in operation.\n\nWorld Heavyweight Champion [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] was once arrested here for marrying his White wife and transporting her across state lines.<ref name=\"battlecreekracearrest\">{{cite news |last1=Buckley |first1=NIck |title=Pardoned heavyweight champion Jack Johnson was arrested in Battle Creek |url=https://eu.battlecreekenquirer.com/story/news/2018/05/24/pardoned-heavyweight-champ-jack-johnson-arrested-battle-creek/641457002/ |accessdate=20 November 2019 |publisher=Battle Creek Enquirer}}</ref>\n\nThe city was noted for its focus on health reform during the late 1800s and early 1900s. [[Battle Creek Sanitarium|The Battle Creek Sanitarium]] was founded by Dr. [[John Harvey Kellogg]].  In addition to some of his sometimes bizarre treatments that were featured in the movie ''[[The Road to Wellville (film)|The Road to Wellville]]'', Kellogg also funded organizations that promoted [[eugenics]] theories at the core of their philosophical agenda.  The Better Race Institute was one of these organizations.  He also supported the \"[[separate but equal]]\" philosophy and invited [[Booker T. Washington]] to speak at the Battle Creek Sanitarium in order to raise money. Washington was the author of the speech \"[[Atlanta compromise|The Atlanta Compromise]]\", which solidified his position of being an [[Atlanta compromise|accommodationist]] while providing a mechanism for southern Whites (and their sympathizers), to fund his school ([[Tuskegee University|the Tuskegee Institute]]).\n\n[[W. K. Kellogg]] had worked for his brother in a variety of capacities at the B.C. Sanitarium.  Tired of living in his brother's shadow, he struck out on his own, going to the boom-towns surrounding the oilfields in [[Oklahoma]] as a broom salesman.  Having failed, he returned to work as an assistant to his brother (John Harvey).  While working at the sanitariums' laboratory, W.K. spilled liquefied cornmeal on a heating device that cooked the product and rendered it to flakes.  He tasted the flakes and added milk to them.  He was able to get his brother to allow him to give some of the product to some of the patients at the sanitarium, and the patients' demand for the product exceeded his expectations to the point that W.K made the decision to leave the sanitarium. Along with some investors, he built a factory to satisfy the demand for his \"[[corn flakes]]\".\n\nAs W. K. Kellogg's wealth began to exceed his brother's, he funded some of his projects that were at the sanitarium. One of these was the Better Race Institute, a eugenics-based organization. During this time, John Harvey Kellogg became a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]]. One of the tenets of the fraternity is that \"Masonry recognizes the internal character of a man, not the external\". John Harvey Kellogg stopped funding his brother's projects and established equal pay policies in his company. He also led [[desegregation]] efforts by allowing black children to swim in his home pool. He funded many school and philanthropic projects throughout the city, and founded [[Andrews University]] in [[Berrien Springs, Michigan|Berrien Springs]], Michigan.\n\nIt was during this time of going their separate ways for good that Dr. John Harvey Kellogg sued his brother for copyright infringement. The U.S. Supreme court ruled in W.K. Kellogg's favor.\n\nInspired by Kellogg's innovation, [[C. W. Post]] invented [[Grape-Nuts]] and founded his own cereal company in the town. Battle Creek has been nicknamed \"the Cereal City.\"\n\nIn the turbulent 1960s, Battle Creek was not immune to the racial issues of the day.

African Americans were subjected to \"[[stop and frisk]]\" procedures while walking, and housing covenants were in full force.  No Blacks worked in the school systems, and only a few Blacks held mid-level manager posts in the local corporate sector.  The Federal government sector was better at the Federal Center, and less so at the local Veterans' Administration Hospital.\n\nThe Black Recondos, a group formed from the local young adult council of the [[NAACP]], forced the local board of education to hire Black teachers and administrative personnel, under the threat of removing every black student from their public schools. They also forced the chief of police to allow Black Recondos to intervene in arrests and gave them the authority to take black law breakers into their custody instead of the local police. This caused the second [[police strike|strike of a police force]] in U.S. history. The officers were fired and the strike was ended.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|43.73|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|42.61|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|1.12|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water,<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web |title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220065340/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 20, 2011 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=November 25, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> making Battle Creek the third largest city in Michigan by area, and one of only three [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] municipalities in the state over {{convert|40|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} in size.\n\n*Approximately 60% of the city's land is developed.

Cities that follow this plan of government have an elected commission (or council) that appoints a professionally trained and experienced manager to administer the day-to-day operations of the city and to make recommendations to the city commission. Battle Creek also appoints a City Attorney, who provides legal counsel to the city manager and City Commission.\n\nThe City Commission makes all policy decisions, including review, revision and final approval of the annual budget, which is proposed annually by the City Manager. The City Manager serves as an \"at-will\" employee and he works under an employment contract with the commission. All other city employees, with the exception of the City Attorney's staff, are under the supervision of the City Manager.\n\nThere are five ward commissioners. Residents cast votes for a ward representative, who must live within the area they are representing, as well as for four at-large commissioners. These candidates may live anywhere in the city. All commissioners serve two-year terms and all terms begin and end at the same election. The last commission election was in fall 2015.\n\nEach November, the commission holds a special meeting to decide which commissioners serve as mayor and vice mayor for the next year. The mayor presides over the commission meetings and appoints commissioners and residents to special committees. He may also form special committees to explore community challenges or potential policies. The vice mayor stands in if the mayor is unavailable.<ref>[http://ci.battle-creek.mi.us/Government/Default.htm Battle Creek government description.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213220059/http://ci.battle-creek.mi.us/Government/Default.htm |date=December 13, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe city levies an income tax of 1 percent on residents and 0.5 percent on nonresidents.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gibbons|first1=Lauren|title=Michigan State University, city of East Lansing at odds over proposed income tax|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/08/michigan_state_university_city.html|access-date=August 16, 2017|work=MLive Lansing|publisher=Mlive Media Group|date=August 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n\n===Largest employers===\nAccording to the City's 2011 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.battlecreekmi.gov/Assets/finance/audit+reports/FY+2011/City+of+Battle+Creek+CAFR+63011.pdf |title=City of Battle Creek 2010 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report |format=PDF |accessdate=February 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701230538/http://www.battlecreekmi.gov/Assets/finance/audit%2Breports/FY%2B2011/City%2Bof%2BBattle%2BCreek%2BCAFR%2B63011.pdf |archivedate=July 1, 2014 }}</ref> the largest employers in the city are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! #\n!

It is the principal city of the Battle Creek, Michigan [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA), which encompasses all of Calhoun County. As of the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]], the city had a total population of 52,347, while the MSA's population was 136,146.\n\n==History and name origin==\nIn about 1774, the [[Potawatomi]] and the Ottawa [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes formed a joint village near the future Battle Creek, Michigan.<ref>R. David Edmonds, ''The Potawatomis: Keepers of the Fire'' (Norman:University of Oklahoma, 1978), p. 99</ref>\n\nBattle Creek was named for a minor encounter on March 14, 1824, between a federal government land survey party led by Colonel [[John Mullett]] and two Potawatomi Indians, who had approached the survey camp asking for [[food]]. They were hungry because the Army was late in delivering the supplies promised them by the treaty of 1820. After a protracted discussion, the Native Americans allegedly tried to steal food. One of the surveyors grabbed his rifle and shot one of the Potawatomi, seriously wounding him. Following the encounter, the surveyors retreated to Detroit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagebattlecreek.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=58&Itemid=61|title=A Brief History of Battle Creek|first=|last=Administrator|website=www.heritagebattlecreek.org}}</ref>\n \nSurveyors would not return to the area until June 1825, after Governor [[Lewis Cass]] had settled the issues with the Native Americans. Early white settlers called the nearby stream the [[Battle Creek River]], and the town took its name from that.<ref name=\"Peirce\">{{cite book |last=Peirce |first=Henry B. |title=History of Calhoun county, Michigan |origyear=1877 |url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/bad0868.0001.001 |accessdate=January 25, 2008 |year=2005 |publisher=University of Michigan Library |location=Ann Arbor, Mich. |page=79 |chapter=The City of Battle Creek |chapterurl=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=micounty;cc=micounty;idno=bad0868.0001.001;size=l;frm=frameset;seq=119 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.rootsweb.com/~micalhou/battlecreek.htm History of Battle Creek Township and City], Calhoun County MIGenWen (Michigan Genealogy on the Web), accessed January 25, 2008</ref><ref name=\"Romig\">{{cite book | last = Romig | first = Walter | year = 1986 | title = Michigan Place Names | origyear= 1973 | publisher = Wayne State University Press | location = Detroit, Michigan | isbn = 0-8143-1838-X}}</ref><ref>[http://ci.battle-creek.mi.us/Community/History.htm Battle Creek history page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927161649/http://ci.battle-creek.mi.us/Community/History.htm |date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.willard.lib.mi.us/bc.html A Thumbnail History of Battle Creek and Calhoun County, Michigan], Willard Library.

By this account, the name ''Waupakisco'' or ''Waupokisco'' was a reference to an earlier battle fought between Native American tribes before the arrival of white settlers. However, Virgil J. Vogel establishes that this native term had \"nothing to do with blood or battle\".<ref name=\"Peirce\"/><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T5d5wS7so14C&pg=PA152&lpg=PA152&dq=battle+creek+name+origin&source=web&ots=VaQav_UozE&sig=oA31UESmxR2ebI9PlwquP3Tg940#PPA153,M1 |title=Indian names in Michigan, origin of \"Battle Creek\" |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nFollowing removal of the Potawatomi to a reservation, the first permanent white settlements in Battle Creek Township began about 1831. Migration had increased to Michigan from New York and New England following the completion of the [[Erie Canal]] in New York in 1824. Most settlers chose to locate on the Goguac prairie, which was fertile and easily cultivated.  A post office was opened in Battle Creek in 1832 under Postmaster Pollodore Hudson.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FS7nJ3FOAIC&pg=PA16 History and Direction of Calhoun County] Accessed January 20, 2011</ref> The first school was taught in a small [[log house]] about 1833 or 1834.  Asa Langley built the first [[sawmill]] in 1837.  A brick manufacturing plant, called the oldest enterprise in the township, was established in 1840 by Simon Carr and operated until 1903.  The township was established by act of the legislature in 1839.<ref>Ringes, Laura (1913). [https://books.google.com/books?id=XdZWAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA169 \"Battle Creek Township\"].

The Lewis Publishing Company.</ref>\n\nIn the [[antebellum era]], the city was a major stop on the [[Underground Railroad]], used by [[fugitive slave]]s to escape to freedom in Michigan and [[Canada]].  It was the chosen home of noted abolitionist [[Sojourner Truth]] after her escape from slavery.<ref>Heritage Battle Creek website, http://www.heritagebattlecreek.org/   Accessed August 29, 2013</ref>\n\nBattle Creek figured prominently in the early history of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]. It was the site of a Protestant church founding convention in 1863. The denomination's first hospital, college, and publishing office would also be constructed in the city. When the hospital and publishing office burned down in 1902, the church elected to decentralize, and most of its institutions were relocated. The first Adventist church (rebuilt in the 1920s) is still in operation.\n\nWorld Heavyweight Champion [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] was once arrested here for marrying his White wife and transporting her across state lines.<ref name=\"battlecreekracearrest\">{{cite news |last1=Buckley |first1=NIck |title=Pardoned heavyweight champion Jack Johnson was arrested in Battle Creek |url=https://eu.battlecreekenquirer.com/story/news/2018/05/24/pardoned-heavyweight-champ-jack-johnson-arrested-battle-creek/641457002/ |accessdate=20 November 2019 |publisher=Battle Creek Enquirer}}</ref>\n\nThe city was noted for its focus on health reform during the late 1800s and early 1900s. [[Battle Creek Sanitarium|The Battle Creek Sanitarium]] was founded by Dr. [[John Harvey Kellogg]].  In addition to some of his sometimes bizarre treatments that were featured in the movie ''[[The Road to Wellville (film)|The Road to Wellville]]'', Kellogg also funded organizations that promoted [[eugenics]] theories at the core of their philosophical agenda.  The Better Race Institute was one of these organizations.  He also supported the \"[[separate but equal]]\" philosophy and invited [[Booker T. Washington]] to speak at the Battle Creek Sanitarium in order to raise money. Washington was the author of the speech \"[[Atlanta compromise|The Atlanta Compromise]]\", which solidified his position of being an [[Atlanta compromise|accommodationist]] while providing a mechanism for southern Whites (and their sympathizers), to fund his school ([[Tuskegee University|the Tuskegee Institute]]).\n\n[[W. K. Kellogg]] had worked for his brother in a variety of capacities at the B.C. Sanitarium.  Tired of living in his brother's shadow, he struck out on his own, going to the boom-towns surrounding the oilfields in [[Oklahoma]] as a broom salesman.  Having failed, he returned to work as an assistant to his brother (John Harvey).  While working at the sanitariums' laboratory, W.K. spilled liquefied cornmeal on a heating device that cooked the product and rendered it to flakes.  He tasted the flakes and added milk to them.  He was able to get his brother to allow him to give some of the product to some of the patients at the sanitarium, and the patients' demand for the product exceeded his expectations to the point that W.K made the decision to leave the sanitarium. Along with some investors, he built a factory to satisfy the demand for his \"[[corn flakes]]\".\n\nAs W. K. Kellogg's wealth began to exceed his brother's, he funded some of his projects that were at the sanitarium. One of these was the Better Race Institute, a eugenics-based organization. During this time, John Harvey Kellogg became a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]]. One of the tenets of the fraternity is that \"Masonry recognizes the internal character of a man, not the external\". John Harvey Kellogg stopped funding his brother's projects and established equal pay policies in his company. He also led [[desegregation]] efforts by allowing black children to swim in his home pool. He funded many school and philanthropic projects throughout the city, and founded [[Andrews University]] in [[Berrien Springs, Michigan|Berrien Springs]], Michigan.\n\nIt was during this time of going their separate ways for good that Dr. John Harvey Kellogg sued his brother for copyright infringement. The U.S. Supreme court ruled in W.K. Kellogg's favor.\n\nInspired by Kellogg's innovation, [[C. W. Post]] invented [[Grape-Nuts]] and founded his own cereal company in the town. Battle Creek has been nicknamed \"the Cereal City.\"\n\nIn the turbulent 1960s, Battle Creek was not immune to the racial issues of the day. Dr. [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King]] spoke here, as did Sen. [[Hubert Humphrey]], President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|L.B. Johnson]], and Heavyweight Champion of the world [[Muhammad Ali]]. African Americans were subjected to \"[[stop and frisk]]\" procedures while walking, and housing covenants were in full force.  No Blacks worked in the school systems, and only a few Blacks held mid-level manager posts in the local corporate sector.  The Federal government sector was better at the Federal Center, and less so at the local Veterans' Administration Hospital.\n\nThe Black Recondos, a group formed from the local young adult council of the [[NAACP]], forced the local board of education to hire Black teachers and administrative personnel, under the threat of removing every black student from their public schools. They also forced the chief of police to allow Black Recondos to intervene in arrests and gave them the authority to take black law breakers into their custody instead of the local police. This caused the second [[police strike|strike of a police force]] in U.S. history.

Cities that follow this plan of government have an elected commission (or council) that appoints a professionally trained and experienced manager to administer the day-to-day operations of the city and to make recommendations to the city commission. Battle Creek also appoints a City Attorney, who provides legal counsel to the city manager and City Commission.\n\nThe City Commission makes all policy decisions, including review, revision and final approval of the annual budget, which is proposed annually by the City Manager. The City Manager serves as an \"at-will\" employee and he works under an employment contract with the commission. All other city employees, with the exception of the City Attorney's staff, are under the supervision of the City Manager.\n\nThere are five ward commissioners. Residents cast votes for a ward representative, who must live within the area they are representing, as well as for four at-large commissioners. These candidates may live anywhere in the city. All commissioners serve two-year terms and all terms begin and end at the same election. The last commission election was in fall 2015.\n\nEach November, the commission holds a special meeting to decide which commissioners serve as mayor and vice mayor for the next year. The mayor presides over the commission meetings and appoints commissioners and residents to special committees. He may also form special committees to explore community challenges or potential policies. The vice mayor stands in if the mayor is unavailable.<ref>[http://ci.battle-creek.mi.us/Government/Default.htm Battle Creek government description.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213220059/http://ci.battle-creek.mi.us/Government/Default.htm |date=December 13, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe city levies an income tax of 1 percent on residents and 0.5 percent on nonresidents.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gibbons|first1=Lauren|title=Michigan State University, city of East Lansing at odds over proposed income tax|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/08/michigan_state_university_city.html|access-date=August 16, 2017|work=MLive Lansing|publisher=Mlive Media Group|date=August 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n\n===Largest employers===\nAccording to the City's 2011 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.battlecreekmi.gov/Assets/finance/audit+reports/FY+2011/City+of+Battle+Creek+CAFR+63011.pdf |title=City of Battle Creek 2010 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report |format=PDF |accessdate=February 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701230538/http://www.battlecreekmi.gov/Assets/finance/audit%2Breports/FY%2B2011/City%2Bof%2BBattle%2BCreek%2BCAFR%2B63011.pdf |archivedate=July 1, 2014 }}</ref> the largest employers in the city are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! #\n!

Influenced by [[Impressionism]] and the [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] masters from a young age, he became increasingly attracted to [[Cubism]] and avant-garde movements.<ref>Gibson, Ian, The Shameful Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed, London, Faber and Faber, 1997, Chs 2, 3</ref> He moved closer to Surrealism in the late 1920s and joined the Surrealist group in 1929, soon becoming one of its leading exponents. His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most famous Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success.

The earlier exhibition included sixteen paintings of which ''The Persistence of Memory'' attracted the most attention. Some of the notable features of the exhibitions were the proliferation of images and references to Dal\u00ed's muse Gala and the inclusion of Surrealist Objects such as ''Hypnagogic Clock'' and ''Clock Based on the Decomposition of Bodies''.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 279-283, 299-300</ref> Dal\u00ed's last, and largest, exhibition at the Pierre Colle Gallery was held in June 1933 and included twenty-two paintings, ten drawings and two objects. One critic noted Dal\u00ed's precise draftsmanship and attention to detail, describing him as a \"paranoiac of geometrical temperament\".<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 314-15</ref> Dal\u00ed's first New York exhibition was held at Julien Levy's gallery in November-December 1933.

Gala, who herself engaged in extra-marital affairs,<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 421-22, 508-10, 620-21</ref> seemed to tolerate Dal\u00ed's dalliances with younger muses, secure in her own position as his primary relationship. Dal\u00ed continued to paint her as they both aged, producing sympathetic and adoring images of her.

His second New York exhibition was held at the Julien Levy Gallery in November-December 1934 and was again a commercial and critical success. Dal\u00ed delivered three lectures on Surrealism at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) and other venues during which he told his audience for the first time that \"[t]he only difference between me and a madman is that I am not mad.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 336-41</ref> The heiress [[Caresse Crosby]], the inventor of the brassiere, organized a farewell fancy dress ball for Dal\u00ed on 18 January 1935. Dal\u00ed wore a glass case on his chest containing a brassiere and Gala dressed as a woman giving birth through her head.

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dal\u00ed had left in his family home, during which Dal\u00ed was accused of assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 454-61</ref>\n\nAs Dal\u00ed moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting.

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''[[The First Days of Spring]]'' (1929), ''[[The Great Masturbator]]'' (1929) and ''[[The Lugubrious Game]]'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behavior throughout his career.

Influenced by [[Impressionism]] and the [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] masters from a young age, he became increasingly attracted to [[Cubism]] and avant-garde movements.<ref>Gibson, Ian, The Shameful Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed, London, Faber and Faber, 1997, Chs 2, 3</ref> He moved closer to Surrealism in the late 1920s and joined the Surrealist group in 1929, soon becoming one of its leading exponents. His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most famous Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Catalonia in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism and recent scientific developments.<ref>Gibson, Ian, ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (1997)</ref> \n\nDal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behavior sometimes drew more attention than his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |last=Saladyga |first=Stephen Francis |url=http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |title=The Mindset of Salvador Dal\u00ed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040713/http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |archive-date=6 September 2006 |work=Lamplighter |publisher=[[Niagara University]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2006 |access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref name=Meisler>{{cite web|last1=Meisler|first1=Stanley|title=The Surreal World of Salvador Dal\u00ed|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-surreal-world-of-salvador-dali-78993324/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=April 2005}}</ref> His public support for the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]], his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), ''passim''</ref> His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, [[pop art]] and contemporary artists such as [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Damien Hirst]].<ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/219444ec-414f-11dc-8f37-0000779fd2ac|title=The Legacy of a Surrealist Showman|last=French|first=Patrick|date=4 August 2007|website=FT.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=22 April 2020}}</ref> There are two major museums devoted to his work: The [[Dal\u00ed Theatre and Museum|Dal\u00ed Theatre-Museum]] in Figueres, Spain and the [[Salvador Dal\u00ed Museum]] in Florida. \n\n== Biography ==\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Familia Dal\u00ed (h 1910).jpg|thumb|The Dal\u00ed family in 1910: from the upper left, aunt Maria Teresa, mother, father, Salvador Dal\u00ed, aunt Caterina (later became second wife of father), sister Anna Maria and grandmother Anna]]\n\nSalvador Dal\u00ed was born on 11 May 1904, at 8:45&nbsp;am GMT,<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 22</ref> on the first floor of Carrer Monturiol, 20 in the town of Figueres, in the [[Empord\u00e0]] [[Comarques of Catalonia|region]], close to the French border in [[Catalonia]], Spain.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://elpais.com/diario/2008/02/14/catalunya/1202954863_850215.html|title=Dal\u00ed recupera su casa natal, que ser\u00e1 un museo en 2010|first=Ediciones El|last=Pa\u00eds|date=14 February 2008|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2017|newspaper=El Pa\u00eds}}</ref> Dal\u00ed's older brother, who had also been [[Necronym|named Salvador]] (born 12 October 1901), had died of [[gastroenteritis]] nine months earlier, on 1 August 1903.

Dal\u00ed refused, perhaps out of fear of expulsion from the Surrealist group, and was violently thrown out of his paternal home on 28 December 1929. His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again.

The 14 oil paintings and other works in the exhibition reflected Dal\u00ed's increasing interest in atomic physics. Notable works included ''Dematerialization Near the Nose of Nero (The Separation of the Atom)'', ''Intra-Atomic Equilibrium of a Swan's Feather'', and a study for ''[[Leda Atomica]]''. The proportions of the latter work were worked out in collaboration with a mathematician.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 440-42</ref>\n\nIn early 1948 Dal\u00ed's ''50 Secrets of Magic Craftsmanship'' was published.

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dal\u00ed had left in his family home, during which Dal\u00ed was accused of assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 454-61</ref>\n\nAs Dal\u00ed moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting. In 1949 he painted a study for ''[[The Madonna of Port Lligat]]'' (first version, 1949) and showed it to Pope Pius XII during an audience arranged to discuss Dal\u00ed 's marriage to Gala.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 450-53</ref> This work was a precursor to the phase Dal\u00ed dubbed \"Nuclear Mysticism,\" a fusion of Einsteinian physics, classicism and Catholic mysticism.

Other designs Dal\u00ed made for her include a shoe-shaped hat, and a pink belt with lips for a buckle. He was also involved in creating textile designs and perfume bottles.

The Comte de Grandsailles and Solange de Cl\u00e9da pursue a love affair, but interwar political turmoil and other vicissitudes drive them apart. It is variously set in [[Paris]], rural France, [[Casablanca]] in North Africa and [[Palm Springs]] in the United States. Secondary characters include aging widow Barbara Rogers, her bisexual daughter Veronica, Veronica's sometime female lover Betka, and Baba, a disfigured US fighter pilot.<ref>Salvador Dal\u00ed: ''Hidden faces'': London: Owen: 1973</ref> The novel was written in New York, and translated by [[Haakon Chevalier]].\n\nHis other literary works include ''[[The Secret Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed]]'' (1942), ''Diary of a Genius'' (1966), and ''Oui: The Paranoid-Critical Revolution'' (1971). Dal\u00ed also published poetry, essays, art criticism and a technical manual on art.\n\n=== Graphic arts ===\nDal\u00ed worked extensively in the [[graphic arts]], producing many etchings and [[lithograph]]s. While his early work in printmaking is equal in quality to his important paintings, as he grew older he would sell the rights to images but not be involved in the print production itself. In addition, a large number of fakes were produced in the 1980s and 1990s, thus further confusing the Dal\u00ed print market.<ref name=\"Forde_170\">Forde, Kevin (2011).

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''[[The First Days of Spring]]'' (1929), ''[[The Great Masturbator]]'' (1929) and ''[[The Lugubrious Game]]'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behavior throughout his career.

The ultimate objective is to destroy the opposing team's ''main structure'' with the assistance of periodically-[[Spawning (video gaming)|spawned]] computer-controlled units that march forward along set paths; However, MOBA games can have other victory conditions, such as defeating every player on the enemy team. [[Player character|Player characters]] typically have a set of unique abilities that improve over the course of a game and which contribute to a team's overall strategy. This type of [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] [[Online game|online video games]] is a fusion of [[real-time strategy]], [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]], and [[action game]]s, though MOBA players usually do not construct buildings or units, and there are examples of MOBA games that cannot be considered RTS at all, such as [[Smite (video game)|''Smite'']] (2014), and [[Paragon (video game)|''Paragon'']].{{efn|''Paragon'' is a canceled third-person MOBA game which was never officially released.

The first team to destroy the opposing team's main structure wins the match. Destroying other structures within the opposing team's base may confer other benefits. Defensive structures, which are usually automatic \"towers\", are in place to prevent this, as well as relatively weak computer-controlled units, called \"minions\", which periodically spawn in groups at the base and marching down predefined paths (called \"lanes\") toward the enemy base.<ref>{{cite web | last=Leahy | first=Brian |url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/66007 |title=Dota Explained and How You Can Play it Now |date=13 October 2010 |publisher=Shacknews.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115130020/http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/66007 |archivedate=15 November 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> There are typically 3 \"lanes\" that are the main ways of getting from one base to another; in between the lanes is an uncharted area called the \"jungle.\" The lanes are known as top, middle and bottom lane, or, in [[gamer]] shorthand \u2013 \"top\", \"mid\" and \"bot\".\n\nA player controls a single powerful in-game unit, called \"hero\", or \"champion\". When a hero stands near a killed enemy unit or kills an enemy unit, they gain [[experience point]]s and [[gold]] which allow the hero to level up and buy items at a store. When a hero levels up, they have the ability to strengthen their abilities which they typically have four of. If a hero [[Life (gaming)|runs out of health points]] and dies, he is removed from active play until a respawn timer counts down to zero, where he is then respawned in his base. Respawn time generally increases as hero levels up.<ref name=herodeath>{{cite web |url=http://www.playdota.com/learn/survival |title=Basic Survival \u2013 Learn Dota |publisher=PlayDota.com |accessdate=28 October 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AB2qAxoi?url=http://www.playdota.com/learn/survival |archivedate=25 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHeroes typically fall into one of several roles, such as tank, damage dealer, healer, and support. Every hero has their own diverse kit with unique abilities, design, strengths, and weaknesses. Also typically, there is a large starting pool of heroes \u2013 ''League of Legends'', for instance, began with 40, and has added at least one new one every month for its entire lifespan, reaching 100 in 2012.<ref>{{cite web | last=Augustine | first=Rob | url=http://www.pcgamer.com/introducing-league-of-legends-100th-champion-jayce-the-defender-of-tomorrow/ | title=Introducing League of Legends' 100th champion: Jayce, the Defender of Tomorrow | date=3 July 2012 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109152828/http://www.pcgamer.com/introducing-league-of-legends-100th-champion-jayce-the-defender-of-tomorrow/ | archivedate=9 November 2016 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> This adds to the learning curve of the game as players learn the game's goals and strategies. Players usually find at least one hero they excel at playing, and familiarize themselves with the remaining roster. Additionally, each hero is deliberately limited in the roles they can fulfill. No one hero is ever (supposed to be) powerful enough to win the game without support from their team. This creates a strong emphasis on teamwork and cooperation.\n\nEach player typically receives a small amount of gold per second during the course of the game. Moderate amounts of gold are rewarded for killing hostile computer-controlled units and larger amounts are rewarded for killing enemy heroes. Gold is used by heroes to buy a variety of different items that range in price and impact. For the most part, this involves improving the combat viability of the hero, although there may be other items that support the hero or team as a whole in different ways.<ref name=DOTA2gameplay>{{cite web |last=Biessener |first=Adam |url=http://gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2010/10/13/dota-2-announced-details.aspx |title=Valve's New Game Announced, Detailed: Dota 2 |date=13 October 2010 |publisher=[[Game Informer]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101016155010/http://gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2010/10/13/dota-2-announced-details.aspx |archivedate=16 October 2010 |url-status=dead |access-date=20 October 2010 }}</ref>\n\nAs the heroes of each team get stronger, they can use multiple strategies to gain an advantage. These strategies can include securing objectives, killing enemy heroes and farming gold by killing computer-controlled units. The stronger a team gets, the more capable they are at destroying the enemy team and their base.\n\n=== Character classes and roles ===\nIn most MOBAs, [[Player character|playable characters]] have assigned classes such as [[Tank (gaming)|\"tank\"]], \"marksman\", \"mage\", \"fighter\", \"assassin\" and \"support\".

This type of games moved away from constructing additional structures, base management, army building, and controlling additional units. Map and the main structures for each team are still present, and destroying enemy main structure will secure victory as the ultimate victory condition. Players can find various friendly and enemy units on the map at any given time assisting each team, however these units are computer-controlled and players usually don't have direct control over their movement and [[Spawning (gaming)|creation]]; instead, they march forward along set paths. Unlike in real-time strategy games (RTS), player has control over the only one single unit, called hero or champion. However, some MOBA games have certain heroes which control a few specialized units,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/heroes/the-lost-vikings/|title=The Lost Vikings - Heroes of the Storm|website=us.battle.net|language=en-us|access-date=2019-09-24}}</ref> but not on a massive scale which is typical for RTS.\n\nThe MOBA genre resembles role-playing games (RPG) in gameplay, though the MOBA genre focuses on the [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] battle in the arena-like environment, while RPG as genre typically revolve around single player story and its chapters, and exploration of different locations.

The tools allowed members of the public to design and create custom maps that allowed play that was different from the normal maps.

Both the multiplayer online battle arena and [[tower defense]] subgenres took substantive shape within the ''WC3'' modding community. A modder named Eul began converting ''Aeon of Strife'' into the ''Warcraft III'' engine, calling the map ''[[Defense of the Ancients]]'' ''(DotA)''. Eul substantially improved the complexity of play from the original ''Aeon of Strife'' [[Mod (video gaming)|mod]]. Shortly after creating the custom ''DotA'' map, Eul left the modding scene. With no clear successor, ''Warcraft III'' modders created a variety of maps based on ''DotA'' and featuring different heroes. In 2003, after the release of [[WarCraft III: The Frozen Throne|''Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne'']], a map creator named Meian<ref name=\"getdota\" /> created a ''DotA'' variant closely modeled on Eul's map, but combining heroes from the many other versions of ''DotA'' that existed at the time. Called ''DotA: Allstars'', it was inherited after a few months by a modder called [[Steve Feak|Steve \"Guinsoo\" Feak]], and under his guidance it became the dominant map of the genre. After more than a year of maintaining the ''DotA: Allstars'' map, with the impending release of an update that significantly changed the map layout, Guinsoo left the development to his adjutant Neichus in the year 2005.<ref name=\"getdota\" /> After some weeks of development and some versions released, the latter turned over responsibility to a modder named [[IceFrog]], who initiated large changes to the mechanics that deepened its complexity and capacity for innovative gameplay. The changes conducted by IceFrog were well-received and the number of users on the ''Dota: Allstars'' forum is thought to have peaked at over one million.<ref name=\"themittani\" /> ''Defense of the Ancients (DotA)'' is largely attributed to being the most significant inspiration for the multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game genre in the years to come.<ref>{{Cite

The first team to destroy the opposing team's main structure wins the match. Destroying other structures within the opposing team's base may confer other benefits. Defensive structures, which are usually automatic \"towers\", are in place to prevent this, as well as relatively weak computer-controlled units, called \"minions\", which periodically spawn in groups at the base and marching down predefined paths (called \"lanes\") toward the enemy base.<ref>{{cite web | last=Leahy | first=Brian |url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/66007 |title=Dota Explained and How You Can Play it Now |date=13 October 2010 |publisher=Shacknews.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115130020/http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/66007 |archivedate=15 November 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> There are typically 3 \"lanes\" that are the main ways of getting from one base to another; in between the lanes is an uncharted area called the \"jungle.\" The lanes are known as top, middle and bottom lane, or, in [[gamer]] shorthand \u2013 \"top\", \"mid\" and \"bot\".\n\nA player controls a single powerful in-game unit, called \"hero\", or \"champion\". When a hero stands near a killed enemy unit or kills an enemy unit, they gain [[experience point]]s and [[gold]] which allow the hero to level up and buy items at a store. When a hero levels up, they have the ability to strengthen their abilities which they typically have four of. If a hero [[Life (gaming)|runs out of health points]] and dies, he is removed from active play until a respawn timer counts down to zero, where he is then respawned in his base. Respawn time generally increases as hero levels up.<ref name=herodeath>{{cite web |url=http://www.playdota.com/learn/survival |title=Basic Survival \u2013 Learn Dota |publisher=PlayDota.com |accessdate=28 October 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AB2qAxoi?url=http://www.playdota.com/learn/survival |archivedate=25 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHeroes typically fall into one of several roles, such as tank, damage dealer, healer, and support. Every hero has their own diverse kit with unique abilities, design, strengths, and weaknesses. Also typically, there is a large starting pool of heroes \u2013 ''League of Legends'', for instance, began with 40, and has added at least one new one every month for its entire lifespan, reaching 100 in 2012.<ref>{{cite web | last=Augustine | first=Rob | url=http://www.pcgamer.com/introducing-league-of-legends-100th-champion-jayce-the-defender-of-tomorrow/ | title=Introducing League of Legends' 100th champion: Jayce, the Defender of Tomorrow | date=3 July 2012 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109152828/http://www.pcgamer.com/introducing-league-of-legends-100th-champion-jayce-the-defender-of-tomorrow/ | archivedate=9 November 2016 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> This adds to the learning curve of the game as players learn the game's goals and strategies. Players usually find at least one hero they excel at playing, and familiarize themselves with the remaining roster. Additionally, each hero is deliberately limited in the roles they can fulfill. No one hero is ever (supposed to be) powerful enough to win the game without support from their team. This creates a strong emphasis on teamwork and cooperation.\n\nEach player typically receives a small amount of gold per second during the course of the game. Moderate amounts of gold are rewarded for killing hostile computer-controlled units and larger amounts are rewarded for killing enemy heroes. Gold is used by heroes to buy a variety of different items that range in price and impact. For the most part, this involves improving the combat viability of the hero, although there may be other items that support the hero or team as a whole in different ways.<ref name=DOTA2gameplay>{{cite web |last=Biessener |first=Adam |url=http://gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2010/10/13/dota-2-announced-details.aspx |title=Valve's New Game Announced, Detailed: Dota 2 |date=13 October 2010 |publisher=[[Game Informer]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101016155010/http://gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2010/10/13/dota-2-announced-details.aspx |archivedate=16 October 2010 |url-status=dead |access-date=20 October 2010 }}</ref>\n\nAs the heroes of each team get stronger, they can use multiple strategies to gain an advantage. These strategies can include securing objectives, killing enemy heroes and farming gold by killing computer-controlled units. The stronger a team gets, the more capable they are at destroying the enemy team and their base.\n\n=== Character classes and roles ===\nIn most MOBAs, [[Player character|playable characters]] have assigned classes such as [[Tank (gaming)|\"tank\"]], \"marksman\", \"mage\", \"fighter\", \"assassin\" and \"support\".

This type of games moved away from constructing additional structures, base management, army building, and controlling additional units. Map and the main structures for each team are still present, and destroying enemy main structure will secure victory as the ultimate victory condition.

The tools allowed members of the public to design and create custom maps that allowed play that was different from the normal maps.

Both the multiplayer online battle arena and [[tower defense]] subgenres took substantive shape within the ''WC3'' modding community. A modder named Eul began converting ''Aeon of Strife'' into the ''Warcraft III'' engine, calling the map ''[[Defense of the Ancients]]'' ''(DotA)''. Eul substantially improved the complexity of play from the original ''Aeon of Strife'' [[Mod (video gaming)|mod]]. Shortly after creating the custom ''DotA'' map, Eul left the modding scene. With no clear successor, ''Warcraft III'' modders created a variety of maps based on ''DotA'' and featuring different heroes. In 2003, after the release of [[WarCraft III: The Frozen Throne|''Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne'']], a map creator named Meian<ref name=\"getdota\" /> created a ''DotA'' variant closely modeled on Eul's map, but combining heroes from the many other versions of ''DotA'' that existed at the time. Called ''DotA: Allstars'', it was inherited after a few months by a modder called [[Steve Feak|Steve \"Guinsoo\" Feak]], and under his guidance it became the dominant map of the genre. After more than a year of maintaining the ''DotA: Allstars'' map, with the impending release of an update that significantly changed the map layout, Guinsoo left the development to his adjutant Neichus in the year 2005.<ref name=\"getdota\" /> After some weeks of development and some versions released, the latter turned over responsibility to a modder named [[IceFrog]], who initiated large changes to the mechanics that deepened its complexity and capacity for innovative gameplay. The changes conducted by IceFrog were well-received and the number of users on the ''Dota: Allstars'' forum is thought to have peaked at over one million.<ref name=\"themittani\" /> ''Defense of the Ancients (DotA)'' is largely attributed to being the most significant inspiration for the multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game genre in the years to come.<ref>{{Cite
