The dale is cut into a plateau of farmland and lies to the south east of the village of [[Litton, Derbyshire|Litton]]. [[Cressbrook]] village is at the foot of the valley to the south.<ref name=\"OS\">[[Ordnance Survey|OS]] ''Explorer'' map OL24W, 1:25,000 series.</ref>\n\nThe valley is dry over the summer but has a [[Winterbourne (stream)|winterbourne stream]] which runs into the mill pond at Cressbrook Mill and then into the [[River Wye, Derbyshire|River Wye]] in Water-cum-Jolly Dale.\n\n== Nature Reserve ==\nCressbrook Dale is part of the [[Derbyshire Dales National Nature Reserve]]. [[Natural England]] manages the reserve which covers five separate dales of the [[White Peak]] ([[Lathkill Dale]], Cressbrook Dale, Hay Dale, Long Dale and [[Monk's Dale|Monk\u2019s Dale]]). The reserve contains [[Fraxinus|ash]] and [[Ulmus glabra|wych elm]] woodland and shrubs including [[Mercurialis perennis|dog\u2019s mercury]], [[Acer campestre|field maple]], [[Viburnum opulus|guelder rose]], [[hazel]], [[bird cherry]] and [[Cornus|dogwood]]. Wildflowers in the reserve include  [[Lily of the valley|lily-of-the-valley]], [[Allium ursinum|ramsons]] and [[Geranium sanguineum|bloody cranesbill]]. There are broad areas of scrub with [[Crataegus|Hawthorn]], [[Prunus spinosa|blackthorn]], [[Rhamnus (plant)|buckthorn]] and rose. [[Helictotrichon pratense|Meadow oat]] and [[Carex panicea|carnation sedge]] spread across the ungrazed grasslands, with patches of rare bird\u2019s-foot sedge (''Carex ornithopoda''). Cressbrook Dale is also a designated [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI).

The layers were deposited in a warm shallow sea in the [[Vis\u00e9an|Brigantian]] stage of the [[Carboniferous]] period (around 330 million years ago). The Carboniferous Limestone contains important fossils. Several layers of volcanic rock show that volcanoes were once active in Derbyshire.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt the northern end of the valley (the Wardlow Mires) is the prominent limestone knoll Peter's Stone (named after its resemblence to the dome shape of [[St. Peter's Basilica|St Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]]).

The dale is cut into a plateau of farmland and lies to the south east of the village of [[Litton, Derbyshire|Litton]]. [[Cressbrook]] village is at the foot of the valley to the south.<ref name=\"OS\">[[Ordnance Survey|OS]] ''Explorer'' map OL24W, 1:25,000 series.</ref>\n\nThe valley is dry over the summer but has a [[Winterbourne (stream)|winterbourne stream]] which runs into the mill pond at Cressbrook Mill and then into the [[River Wye, Derbyshire|River Wye]] in Water-cum-Jolly Dale.\n\n== Nature Reserve ==\nCressbrook Dale is part of the [[Derbyshire Dales National Nature Reserve]]. [[Natural England]] manages the reserve which covers five separate dales of the [[White Peak]] ([[Lathkill Dale]], Cressbrook Dale, Hay Dale, Long Dale and [[Monk's Dale|Monk\u2019s Dale]]). The reserve contains [[Fraxinus|ash]] and [[Ulmus glabra|wych elm]] woodland and shrubs including [[Mercurialis perennis|dog\u2019s mercury]], [[Acer campestre|field maple]], [[Viburnum opulus|guelder rose]], [[hazel]], [[bird cherry]] and [[Cornus|dogwood]]. Wildflowers in the reserve include  [[Lily of the valley|lily-of-the-valley]], [[Allium ursinum|ramsons]] and [[Geranium sanguineum|bloody cranesbill]]. There are broad areas of scrub with [[Crataegus|Hawthorn]], [[Prunus spinosa|blackthorn]], [[Rhamnus (plant)|buckthorn]] and rose. [[Helictotrichon pratense|Meadow oat]] and [[Carex panicea|carnation sedge]] spread across the ungrazed grasslands, with patches of rare bird\u2019s-foot sedge (''Carex ornithopoda''). Cressbrook Dale is also a designated [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI). It is especially important for the lichens on the limestone cliffs.<ref name=\"NNR\">{{cite web|url=http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/31052?category=23001|title=Derbyshire Dales National Nature Reserve (NE154)|last=|first=|date=18 July 2014|website=|publisher=Natural England|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/PDFsForWeb/Citation/1002731.pdf|title=CRESSBROOK DALE SSSI|last=|first=|date=|website=Designated Site - Natural England|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n[[File:Ravensdale_Cottages_-_geograph.org.uk_-_374614.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ravensdale_Cottages_-_geograph.org.uk_-_374614.jpg|thumb|Ravensdale Cottages]]\n\n== Geology ==\nThe sequence of limestones in Cressbrook Dale are an important geological site. The layers were deposited in a warm shallow sea in the [[Vis\u00e9an|Brigantian]] stage of the [[Carboniferous]] period (around 330 million years ago). The Carboniferous Limestone contains important fossils. Several layers of volcanic rock show that volcanoes were once active in Derbyshire.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt the northern end of the valley (the Wardlow Mires) is the prominent limestone knoll Peter's Stone (named after its resemblence to the dome shape of [[St. Peter's Basilica|St Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]]). It used to be called Gibbet Rock where last [[gallows]] in the county stood. The [[Gibbeting|gibbet]] was an iron cage holding the dead bodies of executed criminals as a deterrent to others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.derbyshireheritage.co.uk/Menu/Misc/Peters-Stone-Gibbet-Rock-Wardlow-Mires.php|title=Peter's Stone, Gibbet Rock - Wardlow Mires|website=www.derbyshireheritage.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> One of the last cases of gibbetings was of Anthony Lingard from Tideswell in 1815.

Sudhan's anti government actions started in February 1955 with an assassination attempt in Poonch on the Azad Kashmir President, Sher Ahmed Khan, from which he had a \u2018miraculous escape\u2019. Matters escalated when police sought to arrest an \u2018absconding accused\u2019 by entering a mosque at Pallandri.
