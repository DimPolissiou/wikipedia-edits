The Yellow Emperor is traditionally credited to have united with the neighbouring [[Shennong]] tribes after defeating their leader, the [[Yan Emperor]], at the [[Battle of Banquan]]. The newly merged [[Yanhuang]] tribes then combined forces to defeat their common enemy from the east, [[Chiyou]] of the Jiuli ({{lang|zh|\u4e5d\u9ece}}) tribes, at the [[Battle of Zhuolu]], and established their cultural dominance in the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] region.  To this day, modern Han Chinese refer themselves as \"[[Yan Huang Zisun|Descendants of Yan and Huang]]\".\n\nAlthough study of this period of history is complicated by the absence of contemporary records, the discovery of [[archaeological site]]s has enabled a succession of [[List of Neolithic cultures of China|neolithic cultures]] to be identified along the Yellow River. Along the central reaches of the Yellow River were the [[Jiahu]] culture (c. 7000 to 6600 BCE), the [[Yangshao culture]] (c. 5000 to 3000 BCE) and the [[Longshan culture]] (c. 3000 to 2000 BCE). Along the lower reaches of the river were the Qingliangang culture (c. 5400 to 4000 BCE), the [[Dawenkou culture]] (c. 4300 to 2500 BCE), and the [[Yueshi culture]] (c. 1900 to 1500 BCE).\n\n=== Early history ===\n{{Main|Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors}}\nEarly ancient Chinese history is largely legendary, consisting of mythical tales intertwined with sporadic annals written centuries to millennia later. Sima Qian's ''Records of the Grand Historian''  recorded a period following the Battle of Zhuolu, during the reign of successive generations of confederate overlords ({{zh|t=\u5171\u4e3b}}) known as the [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors]] (c. 2852\u20132070 BCE), who, allegedly, were elected to power among the tribes.  This is a period for which scant reliable archaeological evidence exists \u2013 these sovereigns are largely regarded as [[cultural hero]]es.\n\n==== Xia dynasty ====\n{{Main|Xia dynasty}}\nThe first dynasty to be described in Chinese historical records is the Xia dynasty (c. 2070\u20131600 BCE), established by [[Yu the Great]] after [[Emperor Shun]] abdicated leadership to reward Yu's work in taming the [[Great Flood (China)|Great Flood]].  Yu's son, [[Qi of Xia|Qi]], managed to not only install himself as the next ruler, but also dictated his sons as heirs by default, making the Xia dynasty the first in recorded history where [[order of succession|genealogical succession]] was the norm.  The civilizational prosperity of the Xia dynasty at this time is thought to have given rise to the name \"Huaxia\" ({{zh|s=\u534e\u590f|t=\u83ef\u590f|p=Hu\u00e1 Xi\u00e0}}, \"the magnificent Xia\"), a term that was used ubiquitously throughout history to define the Chinese nation.<ref>{{Cite book |title=An Introduction to the Chinese Economy: The Driving Forces Behind Modern Day China  |last= Guo  |first=  Rongxing   |publisher= Wiley |year= 2010 |isbn= 978-0-470-82604-1 |page=10}}</ref>\n\nConclusive archaeological evidence predating the 16th century BCE is, however, rarely available.  Recent efforts of the [[Xia\u2013Shang\u2013Zhou Chronology Project]] drew the connection between the [[Erlitou culture]] and the Xia dynasty, but scholars could not reach a consensus regarding the reliability of such history.\n\n==== Shang dynasty ====\n{{Main|Shang dynasty}}\nThe Xia dynasty was overthrown after the [[Battle of Mingtiao]], around 1750 BCE, by [[Cheng Tang]], who established the Shang dynasty (c. 1750\u20131046 BCE).  The earliest archaeological examples of Chinese writing date back to this period \u2013 from characters inscribed on [[oracle bone]]s used for divination \u2013 but the well-developed characters hint at a much earlier origin of writing in China.\n\nDuring the Shang dynasty, people of the [[Wu (region)|Wu area]] in the [[Yangtze River Delta]] were considered a different tribe, and described as being scantily dressed, tattooed and speaking a distinct language. Later, [[Taibo of Wu|Taibo]], elder uncle of [[King Wen of Zhou|Ji Chang]] \u2013 on realising that his younger brother, Jili, was wiser and deserved to inherit the throne \u2013 fled to Wu<ref name=\"chinaknowledge.de\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Zhou/rulers-wu.html|title=The Feudal State of Wu \u5433 (www.chinaknowledge.de)|first=Ulrich|last=Theobald|website=Chinaknowledge.de|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref> and settled there. Three generations later, [[King Wu of Zhou|King Wu]] of the Zhou dynasty defeated [[King Zhou of Shang|King Zhou]] (the last Shang king), and [[Feoffment|enfeoffed]] the descendants of Taibo in Wu<ref name=\"chinaknowledge.de\"/> \u2013 mirroring the later history of [[Nanyue]], where a Chinese king and his soldiers ruled a non-Han population and mixed with locals, who were [[sinicization|sinicized]] over time.\n\n==== Zhou dynasty ====\n{{Main|Zhou dynasty}}\nAfter the [[Battle of Muye]], the Shang dynasty was overthrown by [[Predynastic Zhou|Zhou]] (led by [[Ji Fa]]), which had emerged as a western state along the [[Wei River]] in the 2nd millennium BCE.  The [[Zhou dynasty]] shared the language and culture of the Shang people, and extended their reach to encompass much of the area north of the [[Yangtze River]].<ref>{{cite web|title= China The Zhou Period|url= http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_chinathezhouperiod.htm|website=Ancienthistory.about.com|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"China The Zhou Period\">{{cite web|title= China The Zhou Period|url= http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+cn0015)|website=Lcweb2.loc.gov|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref>  Through conquest and colonization, much of this area came under the influence of sinicization, and this culture extended south.<ref name=\"China The Zhou Period\"/>  However, the power of the Zhou kings fragmented not long afterwards, and many autonomous vassal states emerged.  This dynasty is traditionally divided into two eras \u2013 the Western Zhou (1046\u2013771 BCE) and the [[Eastern Zhou]] (770\u2013256 BCE) \u2013 with the latter further divided into the [[Spring and Autumn period|Spring and Autumn]] (770\u2013476 BCE) and the [[Warring States period|Warring States]] (476\u2013221 BCE) periods.  It was a period of significant cultural and philosophical diversification (known as the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]]) and [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] are among the most important surviving philosophies from this era.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n=== Imperial history ===\n\n==== Qin dynasty ====\n{{Main|Qin dynasty}}\nThe chaotic Warring States period of the Eastern Zhou dynasty came to an end with the unification of China by the western state of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] after its [[Qin's wars of unification|conquest of all other rival states]]{{when|date=February 2015}} under King [[Ying Zheng]].  King Zheng then gave himself a new title \"[[First Emperor of Qin]]\" ({{zh|c=\u79e6\u59cb\u7687\u5e1d|p=Q\u00edn Sh\u01d0 Hu\u00e1ngd\u00ec}}), setting the precedent for the next two millennia.  To consolidate administrative control over the newly conquered parts of the country, the First Emperor decreed a nationwide standardization of currency, writing scripts, and measurement units, to unify the country economically and culturally.  He also ordered large-scale infrastructure projects such as the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]], the [[Lingqu Canal]] and the Qin road system to militarily fortify the frontiers.  In effect, he established a centralized bureaucratic state to replace the old feudal confederation system of preceding dynasties, making Qin the first [[Qin dynasty|imperial dynasty]] in Chinese history.\n\nThis dynasty, sometimes phonetically spelt as the \"Ch'in dynasty\", has been proposed in the 17th century by [[Martin Martini]] and supported by later scholars such as [[Paul Pelliot]] and [[Berthold Laufer]] to be the etymological origin of the modern English word \"China\".\n\n==== Han dynasty ====\n{{Main|Han dynasty}}\n[[File:China.Terracotta statues007.jpg|thumb|upright|A female servant and male advisor dressed in [[Han Chinese clothing|silk robes]], ceramic figurines from the Western Han era]]\n\nThe reign of the first imperial dynasty was to be short-lived. Due to the First Emperor's autocratic rule and his massive labor projects, which fomented rebellion among the populace, the Qin dynasty fell into chaos soon after his death. Under the corrupt rule of his son and successor [[Huhai]], the Qin dynasty collapsed a mere three years later. The Han dynasty (206 BC\u2013220 CE) then emerged from the ensuing [[Chu-Han contention|civil wars]] and succeeded in establishing a much longer-lasting dynasty.  It continued many of the institutions created by the Qin dynasty, but adopted a more moderate rule. Under the Han dynasty, arts and culture flourished, while the Han Empire [[History of the Han dynasty|expanded militarily in all directions]]. Many Chinese scholars such as [[Ho Ping-ti]] believe that the concept ([[ethnogenesis]]) of Han ethnicity, though an ancient one, was formally entrenched in the Han dynasty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claytonbrown.org|title=Clayton D.

During this time, areas of northern China were overrun by [[Five Barbarians|various non-Han nomadic peoples]], which came to establish kingdoms of their own, the most successful of which was [[Northern Wei]] (established by the [[Xianbei]]). Starting from this period, the native population of China proper began to be referred to as Hanren, or the \"People of Han\", to distinguish them from the nomads from the steppe. Warfare and invasion led to one of the first great migrations of Han populations in history, as they fled south to the [[Yangtze|Yangzi]] and beyond, shifting the Chinese demographic center and speeding up sinicization of the far south. At the same time most of the nomads in northern China came to be sinicized as they ruled over large Chinese populations and adopted elements of their culture and administration. Of note, the Xianbei rulers of Northern Wei ordered a policy of systematic sinicization, [[Change of Xianbei names to Han names|adopting Han surnames]], institutions, and culture.\n\nThe Sui (581\u2013618) and Tang (618\u2013907) dynasties saw the continuation of the complete sinicization of the south coast of what is now China proper, including what are now the provinces of [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]]. The later part of the Tang era, as well as the Five Dynasties period that followed, saw continual warfare in north and central China; the relative stability of the south coast made it an attractive destination for refugees.\n\n==== Song to Qing ====\n{{Main|Song dynasty|Yuan dynasty|Ming dynasty|Qing dynasty}}\n[[File:Boxer queue.JPG|thumb|Han Chinese man wears a [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]] in compliance with Manchu custom during the Qing dynasty]]\nThe next few centuries saw successive invasions of Han and non-Han peoples from the north. In 1279, the [[Mongols]] conquered all of China, becoming the first non-Han ethnic group to do so, and established the [[Yuan dynasty]]. The Mongols divided society into four classes, with themselves occupying the top class and Han Chinese into the bottom two classes.

The [[Manchu people|Manchus]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] then allied with former Ming general [[Wu Sangui]] and seized control of Beijing. Remnant Ming forces led by [[Koxinga]] fled to [[Taiwan]] and established the [[Kingdom of Tungning]], which eventually capitulated to Qing forces in 1683. Taiwan, previously inhabited mostly by non-Han aborigines, was sinicized during this period via large-scale migration accompanied by assimilation, despite efforts by the Manchus to prevent this, as they found it difficult to maintain control over the island. In 1681, the [[Kangxi Emperor]] ordered construction of the [[Willow Palisade]] to prevent Han Chinese migration to the three northeastern provinces, which nevertheless had harbored a significant Chinese population for centuries, especially in the southern [[Liaodong]] area. The Manchus designated Jilin and Heilongjiang as the Manchu homeland, to which the Manchus could hypothetically escape and regroup if the Qing dynasty fell.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Mark C. |last1=Elliott |date=August 2000 |title=The Limits of Tartary: Manchuria in Imperial and National Geographies |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=603\u201346 |jstor=2658945 |doi=10.2307/2658945|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e8f4099cf98dc5bebc32205a4b8ed91689dfc70b }}</ref> Because of increasing Russian territorial encroachment and annexation of neighboring territory, the Qing later reversed its policy and allowed the consolidation of a demographic Han majority in northeast China.\n\n== Culture and society==\n{{Main|Chinese culture}}\n\nChina is one of the world's oldest and most complex [[civilization]]s, whose culture dates back thousands of years. Overseas Han Chinese maintain cultural affinities to Chinese territories outside of their host locale through [[ancestor worship]] and [[Chinese clan|clan]] associations, which often identify famous figures from Chinese history or myth as ancestors of current members.<ref name=\"Cohen\"/> Such patriarchs include the Yellow Emperor and the [[Yan Emperor]], who according to legend lived thousands of years ago and gave Han people the sobriquet \"''[[Descendants of Yan and Huang Emperor]]''\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u708e\u9ec3\u5b50\u5b6b}}; {{lang|zh-hans|\u708e\u9ec4\u5b50\u5b59}}), a phrase which has reverberative connotations in a divisive political climate, as in that of between [[Cross-Strait relations|Mainland China and Taiwan]].

Since the start of the program in 2001, aspects of Chinese culture have been listed by [[UNESCO]] as [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]. Throughout the [[history of China]], Chinese culture has been heavily influenced by [[Confucianism]]. Credited with shaping much of Chinese thought, [[Confucianism]] was the official [[philosophy]] throughout most of [[Imperial Chinese|Imperial China]]'s history, institutionalizing values like [[filial piety]], which implied the performance of certain [[Li (Confucian)|shared rituals]]. Thus, villagers lavished on [[Chinese funeral rituals|funeral]] and [[Chinese wedding|wedding]] ceremonies that imitated the Confucian standards of the Emperors.<ref name=\"Cohen\"/> Mastery of Confucian texts provided the primary criterion for [[Imperial examination|entry into the imperial bureaucracy]], but even those degree-holders who did not enter the bureaucracy or who left it held increased social influence in their home areas, contributing to the homogenizing of Han Chinese culture.

A simplified and elaborated version of this written standard was used in business contracts, notes for [[Chinese opera]], ritual texts for [[Chinese folk religion]], and other daily documents for educated people.<ref name=\"Cohen\" />\n\nDuring the early 20th century, [[written vernacular Chinese]] based on Mandarin dialects, which had been developing for several centuries, was standardized and adopted to replace literary Chinese. While written vernacular forms of other varieties of Chinese exist, such as [[written Cantonese]], written Chinese based on Mandarin is widely understood by speakers of all varieties and has taken up the dominant position among written forms, formerly occupied by literary Chinese. Thus, although residents of different regions would not necessarily understand each other's speech, they generally share a common written language, Standard Written Chinese and Literary Chinese (these two writing styles can merge into a \u534a\u767d\u534a\u6587 writing style).\n\nFrom the 1950s, [[Simplified Chinese characters]] were adopted in mainland China and later in Singapore and Malaysia, while Chinese communities in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and overseas countries continue to use [[Traditional Chinese characters]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Although significant differences exist between the two character sets, they are largely [[mutually intelligible]].\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Guiyuan Temple Wuhan3.jpg|left|thumb|Chinese bell tower]]\n\nHan Chinese architectural style is unique and native to Han Chinese.\n\n=== Names ===\n{{Main|Chinese name|List of common Chinese surnames}}\n\nIn China, the notion of [[Baixing|hundred surnames]] ({{lang|zh|\u767e\u5bb6\u59d3}}) is crucial identity point of Han people.<ref name=\"Anth\">Ebrey, Patricia [http://faculty.washington.edu/stevehar/ANTH470Ebrey.pdf Surnames and Han Chinese Identity], University of Washington</ref>\n\n=== Fashion ===\n{{Main|Chinese clothing|Hanfu}}\n[[File:Gu Hongzhong's Night Revels, Detail 1.jpg|thumb|A [[Song dynasty]] Chinese painting ''Night Revels of Han Xizai'' showing scholars in scholar's robes and musicians dressed in a [[Hanfu]] variant, 12th-century remake of a 10th-century original by [[Gu Hongzhong]].]]\n[[File:Yellow and green hanfu.jpg|thumb|left|Woman wearing yellow and green [[hanfu]], a traditional dress of the Han Chinese.]]\n\nHan Chinese clothing has been shaped through its dynastic traditions as well as foreign influences.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Chinese Clothing: Costumes, Adornments and Culture (Arts of China) |last= Yang |first=Shaorong |publisher= Long River Press  |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-59265-019-4 |page=3}}</ref> Han Chinese clothing showcases the traditional fashion sensibilities of Chinese clothing traditions and forms one of the major cultural facets of Chinese civilization.<ref name=\"Brown, 2006 79\">{{Cite book |title=China, Japan, Korea: Culture and Customs |last= Brown |first=John |publisher= Createspace Independent Publishing  |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-4196-4893-9 |page=79}}</ref> Hanfu ({{lang|zh-hant|\u6f22\u670d}}) or traditional Han clothing comprises all traditional clothing classifications of the Han Chinese with a recorded history of more than three millennia until the end of the Ming Dynasty.

Indigenous Confucianism and Taoism share aspects of being a philosophy or a religion, and neither demand exclusive adherence, resulting in a culture of tolerance and [[syncretism]], where multiple religions or belief systems are often practiced in concert with local customs and traditions. Han Chinese culture has for long been influenced by [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, while in recent centuries Christianity has also gained a foothold among the population.{{Citation needed|date = November 2018}}\n\nChinese folk religion is a set of worship traditions of the ethnic deities of the Han people. It involves the worship of various figures in [[Chinese mythology]], folk heroes such as [[Guan Yu]] and [[Qu Yuan]], mythological creatures such as the [[Chinese dragon]], or family, clan and national ancestors. These practices vary from region to region, and do not characterize an organized religion, though many [[traditional Chinese holidays]] such as the [[Duanwu Festival|Duanwu (or Dragon Boat) Festival]], [[Qingming Festival|Qingming]], and the [[Mid-Autumn Festival]] come from the most popular of these traditions.\n\nTaoism, another indigenous religion, is also widely practiced in both its folk forms and as an organized religion, and has influenced Chinese art, poetry, philosophy, [[Traditional Chinese medicine|medicine]], [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]], alchemy and chemistry, cuisine, [[Chinese martial arts|martial arts]], and [[Chinese architecture|architecture]]. Taoism was the state religion of the early Han Dynasty, and also often enjoyed state patronage under subsequent emperors and dynasties.\n\nConfucianism, although sometimes described as a religion, is a governing philosophy and moral code with some religious elements like ancestor worship. It is deeply ingrained in Chinese culture and was the official state philosophy in China during the Han Dynasty and unto the fall of imperial China in the 20th century.{{Citation needed|date = November 2018}}\n\nDuring the Han Dynasty, [[Confucian]] ideals were the dominant ideology.  Near the end of the dynasty, Buddhism entered China, later gaining popularity. Historically, Buddhism alternated between periods of state tolerance (and even patronage) and [[Four Buddhist Persecutions in China|persecution]]. In its original form, Buddhism was at odds with the native Chinese religions, especially with the elite, as certain Buddhist values often conflicted with Chinese sensibilities. However, through centuries of assimilation, adaptation, and syncretism, [[Chinese Buddhism]] gained an accepted place in the culture. Mahayana would come to be influenced by Confucianism and Taoism, and exerted influence in turn \u2013 such as in the form of [[Neo-Confucianism]].\n\nThough [[Christianity in China|Christian influence in China]] existed as early as the 7th century, Christianity did not begin to gain a significant foothold in China until the establishment of contact with Europeans during the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties. Chinese practices at odds with Christian beliefs resulted in the [[Chinese Rites controversy]], and a subsequent reduction in Christian influence. Christianity grew considerably following the [[First Opium War]], after which foreign missionaries in China enjoyed the protection of the Western powers and engaged in widespread proselytising.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}}\n\n== Historical southward migration of the Han people ==\n{{multiple issues|\n{{POV|section|date=February 2016}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2016}}\n}}\n[[File:Han Expansion.png|thumb|Map showing the expansion of [[Han dynasty]] in 2nd century BC.]]\nThe term \"Huaxia\" was used by Confucius's contemporaries, during the Warring States era, to describe the shared ethnicity of all Chinese;<ref name=\"Brindley2015\">{{cite book|author=Erica Fox Brindley|title=Ancient China and the Yue: Perceptions and Identities on the Southern Frontier, c. 400 BCE\u201350 CE|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B59rCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA9#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-316-35228-1|pages=9\u201310}}</ref> Chinese people called themselves ''Hua Ren''.<ref name=\"PandeyGeschiere2003\">{{cite book|author1=Gyanendra Pandey|author2=Peter Geschiere|title=The Forging of Nationhood|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CT6FAAAAMAAJ&dq=han+dynasty+hua+ren&q=dynasty+hua+ren|year=2003|publisher=Manohar|isbn=978-81-7304-425-0|page=102}}</ref> Southern Han people \u2013 such as the [[Hoklo]], [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] and [[Hakka]] \u2013 all claim northern Chinese origins from ancestors who migrated from Northern China's Yellow River Valley during the 4th to 12th centuries.

The Yellow Emperor is traditionally credited to have united with the neighbouring [[Shennong]] tribes after defeating their leader, the [[Yan Emperor]], at the [[Battle of Banquan]]. The newly merged [[Yanhuang]] tribes then combined forces to defeat their common enemy from the east, [[Chiyou]] of the Jiuli ({{lang|zh|\u4e5d\u9ece}}) tribes, at the [[Battle of Zhuolu]], and established their cultural dominance in the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] region.  To this day, modern Han Chinese refer themselves as \"[[Yan Huang Zisun|Descendants of Yan and Huang]]\".\n\nAlthough study of this period of history is complicated by the absence of contemporary records, the discovery of [[archaeological site]]s has enabled a succession of [[List of Neolithic cultures of China|neolithic cultures]] to be identified along the Yellow River. Along the central reaches of the Yellow River were the [[Jiahu]] culture (c. 7000 to 6600 BCE), the [[Yangshao culture]] (c. 5000 to 3000 BCE) and the [[Longshan culture]] (c. 3000 to 2000 BCE). Along the lower reaches of the river were the Qingliangang culture (c. 5400 to 4000 BCE), the [[Dawenkou culture]] (c. 4300 to 2500 BCE), and the [[Yueshi culture]] (c. 1900 to 1500 BCE).\n\n=== Early history ===\n{{Main|Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors}}\nEarly ancient Chinese history is largely legendary, consisting of mythical tales intertwined with sporadic annals written centuries to millennia later. Sima Qian's ''Records of the Grand Historian''  recorded a period following the Battle of Zhuolu, during the reign of successive generations of confederate overlords ({{zh|t=\u5171\u4e3b}}) known as the [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors]] (c. 2852\u20132070 BCE), who, allegedly, were elected to power among the tribes.  This is a period for which scant reliable archaeological evidence exists \u2013 these sovereigns are largely regarded as [[cultural hero]]es.\n\n==== Xia dynasty ====\n{{Main|Xia dynasty}}\nThe first dynasty to be described in Chinese historical records is the Xia dynasty (c. 2070\u20131600 BCE), established by [[Yu the Great]] after [[Emperor Shun]] abdicated leadership to reward Yu's work in taming the [[Great Flood (China)|Great Flood]].  Yu's son, [[Qi of Xia|Qi]], managed to not only install himself as the next ruler, but also dictated his sons as heirs by default, making the Xia dynasty the first in recorded history where [[order of succession|genealogical succession]] was the norm.  The civilizational prosperity of the Xia dynasty at this time is thought to have given rise to the name \"Huaxia\" ({{zh|s=\u534e\u590f|t=\u83ef\u590f|p=Hu\u00e1 Xi\u00e0}}, \"the magnificent Xia\"), a term that was used ubiquitously throughout history to define the Chinese nation.<ref>{{Cite book |title=An Introduction to the Chinese Economy: The Driving Forces Behind Modern Day China  |last= Guo  |first=  Rongxing   |publisher= Wiley |year= 2010 |isbn= 978-0-470-82604-1 |page=10}}</ref>\n\nConclusive archaeological evidence predating the 16th century BCE is, however, rarely available.  Recent efforts of the [[Xia\u2013Shang\u2013Zhou Chronology Project]] drew the connection between the [[Erlitou culture]] and the Xia dynasty, but scholars could not reach a consensus regarding the reliability of such history.\n\n==== Shang dynasty ====\n{{Main|Shang dynasty}}\nThe Xia dynasty was overthrown after the [[Battle of Mingtiao]], around 1750 BCE, by [[Cheng Tang]], who established the Shang dynasty (c. 1750\u20131046 BCE).  The earliest archaeological examples of Chinese writing date back to this period \u2013 from characters inscribed on [[oracle bone]]s used for divination \u2013 but the well-developed characters hint at a much earlier origin of writing in China.\n\nDuring the Shang dynasty, people of the [[Wu (region)|Wu area]] in the [[Yangtze River Delta]], were considered a different tribe, and described as being scantily dressed, tattooed and speaking a distinct language. Later, [[Taibo of Wu|Taibo]], elder uncle of [[King Wen of Zhou|Ji Chang]] \u2013 on realising that his younger brother, Jili, was wiser and deserved to inherit the throne \u2013 fled to Wu<ref name=\"chinaknowledge.de\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Zhou/rulers-wu.html|title=The Feudal State of Wu \u5433 (www.chinaknowledge.de)|first=Ulrich|last=Theobald|website=Chinaknowledge.de|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref> and settled there.

The [[Zhou dynasty]] shared the language and culture of the Shang people, and extended their reach to encompass much of the area north of the [[Yangtze River]].<ref>{{cite web|title= China The Zhou Period|url= http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_chinathezhouperiod.htm|website=Ancienthistory.about.com|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"China The Zhou Period\">{{cite web|title= China The Zhou Period|url= http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+cn0015)|website=Lcweb2.loc.gov|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref>  Through conquest and colonization, much of this area came under the influence of sinicization, and this culture extended south.<ref name=\"China The Zhou Period\"/>  However, the power of the Zhou kings fragmented not long afterwards, and many autonomous vassal states emerged.  This dynasty is traditionally divided into two eras \u2013 the Western Zhou (1046\u2013771 BCE) and the [[Eastern Zhou]] (770\u2013256 BCE) \u2013 with the latter further divided into the [[Spring and Autumn period|Spring and Autumn]] (770\u2013476 BCE) and the [[Warring States period|Warring States]] (476\u2013221 BCE) periods.  It was a period of significant cultural and philosophical diversification (known as the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]]) and [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] are among the most important surviving philosophies from this era.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n=== Imperial history ===\n\n==== Qin dynasty ====\n{{Main|Qin dynasty}}\nThe chaotic Warring States period of the Eastern Zhou dynasty came to an end with the unification of China by the western state of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] after its [[Qin's wars of unification|conquest of all other rival states]]{{when|date=February 2015}} under King [[Ying Zheng]].  King Zheng then gave himself a new title \"[[First Emperor of Qin]]\" ({{zh|c=\u79e6\u59cb\u7687\u5e1d|p=Q\u00edn Sh\u01d0 Hu\u00e1ngd\u00ec}}), setting the precedent for the next two millennia.  To consolidate administrative control over the newly conquered parts of the country, the First Emperor decreed a nationwide standardization of currency, writing scripts, and measurement units, to unify the country economically and culturally.  He also ordered large-scale infrastructure projects such as the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]], the [[Lingqu Canal]] and the Qin road system to militarily fortify the frontiers.  In effect, he established a centralized bureaucratic state to replace the old feudal confederation system of preceding dynasties, making Qin the first [[Qin dynasty|imperial dynasty]] in Chinese history.\n\nThis dynasty, sometimes phonetically spelt as the \"Ch'in dynasty\", has been proposed in the 17th century by [[Martin Martini]] and supported by later scholars such as [[Paul Pelliot]] and [[Berthold Laufer]] to be the etymological origin of the modern English word \"China\".\n\n==== Han dynasty ====\n{{Main|Han dynasty}}\n[[File:China.Terracotta statues007.jpg|thumb|upright|A female servant and male advisor dressed in [[Han Chinese clothing|silk robes]], ceramic figurines from the Western Han era]]\n\nThe reign of the first imperial dynasty was to be short-lived. Due to the First Emperor's autocratic rule and his massive labor projects, which fomented rebellion among the populace, the Qin dynasty fell into chaos soon after his death. Under the corrupt rule of his son and successor [[Huhai]], the Qin dynasty collapsed a mere three years later. The Han dynasty (206 BC\u2013220 CE) then emerged from the ensuing [[Chu-Han contention|civil wars]] and succeeded in establishing a much longer-lasting dynasty.  It continued many of the institutions created by the Qin dynasty, but adopted a more moderate rule. Under the Han dynasty, arts and culture flourished, while the Han Empire [[History of the Han dynasty|expanded militarily in all directions]]. Many Chinese scholars such as [[Ho Ping-ti]] believe that the concept ([[ethnogenesis]]) of Han ethnicity, though an ancient one, was formally entrenched in the Han dynasty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claytonbrown.org|title=Clayton D. Brown Research on Chinese History: Ethnology, Archaeology, and Han Identity|website=Claytonbrown.org|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref> The Han dynasty is considered one of the [[golden age]]s of Chinese history, and to this day, the modern Han Chinese people have since taken their ethnic name from this dynasty and the Chinese script is referred to as \"[[Chinese characters|Han characters]]\".{{sfnp|Schaefer|2008|p=279}}\n\n==== Three Kingdoms to Tang ====\n{{Main|Three Kingdoms|Sixteen Kingdoms|Southern and Northern Dynasties|Sui dynasty|Tang dynasty}}\n[[File:China, 742.svg|320px|thumb|Map of Tang China in 742, showing the [[Administrative divisions of the Tang dynasty|major provinces]] of the empire|alt=]]The fall of the Han dynasty was followed by an age of fragmentation and several centuries of disunity amid warfare among rival kingdoms. During this time, areas of northern China were overrun by [[Five Barbarians|various non-Han nomadic peoples]], which came to establish kingdoms of their own, the most successful of which was [[Northern Wei]] (established by the [[Xianbei]]). Starting from this period, the native population of China proper began to be referred to as Hanren, or the \"People of Han\", to distinguish them from the nomads from the steppe. Warfare and invasion led to one of the first great migrations of Han populations in history, as they fled south to the [[Yangtze|Yangzi]] and beyond, shifting the Chinese demographic center and speeding up sinicization of the far south. At the same time most of the nomads in northern China came to be sinicized as they ruled over large Chinese populations and adopted elements of their culture and administration. Of note, the Xianbei rulers of Northern Wei ordered a policy of systematic sinicization, [[Change of Xianbei names to Han names|adopting Han surnames]], institutions, and culture.\n\nThe Sui (581\u2013618) and Tang (618\u2013907) dynasties saw the continuation of the complete sinicization of the south coast of what is now China proper, including what are now the provinces of [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]]. The later part of the Tang era, as well as the Five Dynasties period that followed, saw continual warfare in north and central China; the relative stability of the south coast made it an attractive destination for refugees.\n\n==== Song to Qing ====\n{{Main|Song dynasty|Yuan dynasty|Ming dynasty|Qing dynasty}}\n[[File:Boxer queue.JPG|thumb|Han Chinese man wears a [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]] in compliance with Manchu custom during the Qing dynasty]]\nThe next few centuries saw successive invasions of Han and non-Han peoples from the north. In 1279, the [[Mongols]] conquered all of China, becoming the first non-Han ethnic group to do so, and established the [[Yuan dynasty]]. The Mongols divided society into four classes, with themselves occupying the top class and Han Chinese into the bottom two classes. [[Emigration]], seen as disloyal to ancestors and ancestral land, was banned by the Song and Yuan dynasties.<ref>{{Cite book|first = P\u00e1l|last = Ny\u00edri|first2 =  Igor\u02b9|last2 = Rostislavovich Savel\u02b9ev|title = Globalizing Chinese migration: trends in Europe and Asia|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=77F23y4RrnUC&pg=PA208&dq#v=onepage&q=&f=false|publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year = 2002|page = 208|isbn = 978-0-7546-1793-8}}\n</ref>\n\nIn 1644, the Ming capital, [[Beijing]], was captured by [[Li Zicheng]]'s peasant rebels and the [[Chongzhen Emperor]] committed suicide. The [[Manchu people|Manchus]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] then allied with former Ming general [[Wu Sangui]] and seized control of Beijing. Remnant Ming forces led by [[Koxinga]] fled to [[Taiwan]] and established the [[Kingdom of Tungning]], which eventually capitulated to Qing forces in 1683. Taiwan, previously inhabited mostly by non-Han aborigines, was sinicized during this period via large-scale migration accompanied by assimilation, despite efforts by the Manchus to prevent this, as they found it difficult to maintain control over the island. In 1681, the [[Kangxi Emperor]] ordered construction of the [[Willow Palisade]] to prevent Han Chinese migration to the three northeastern provinces, which nevertheless had harbored a significant Chinese population for centuries, especially in the southern [[Liaodong]] area. The Manchus designated Jilin and Heilongjiang as the Manchu homeland, to which the Manchus could hypothetically escape and regroup if the Qing dynasty fell.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Mark C. |last1=Elliott |date=August 2000 |title=The Limits of Tartary: Manchuria in Imperial and National Geographies |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=603\u201346 |jstor=2658945 |doi=10.2307/2658945|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e8f4099cf98dc5bebc32205a4b8ed91689dfc70b }}</ref> Because of increasing Russian territorial encroachment and annexation of neighboring territory, the Qing later reversed its policy and allowed the consolidation of a demographic Han majority in northeast China.\n\n== Culture and society==\n{{Main|Chinese culture}}\n\nChina is one of the world's oldest and most complex [[civilization]]s, whose culture dates back thousands of years. Overseas Han Chinese maintain cultural affinities to Chinese territories outside of their host locale through [[ancestor worship]] and [[Chinese clan|clan]] associations, which often identify famous figures from Chinese history or myth as ancestors of current members.<ref name=\"Cohen\"/> Such patriarchs include the Yellow Emperor and the [[Yan Emperor]], who according to legend lived thousands of years ago and gave Han people the sobriquet \"''[[Descendants of Yan and Huang Emperor]]''\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u708e\u9ec3\u5b50\u5b6b}}; {{lang|zh-hans|\u708e\u9ec4\u5b50\u5b59}}), a phrase which has reverberative connotations in a divisive political climate, as in that of between [[Cross-Strait relations|Mainland China and Taiwan]]. [[File:Along the River During the Qingming Festival (detail of original).jpg|thumb|[[Zhang Zeduan]]'s painting ''[[Along the River During the Qingming Festival]]'' captures the daily life of people from the Song dynasty at the capital, Bianjing, today's [[Kaifeng]].]]\n\n[[Chinese art]], [[Chinese architecture]], [[Chinese cuisine]], [[Chinese fashion]], [[Chinese festivals]], [[Chinese language]], [[Chinese literature]], [[Chinese mythology]], and [[Chinese philosophy]] all have undergone thousands of years of development, while numerous Chinese sites, such as the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] and the [[Terracotta Army]], are [[World Heritage Site]]s. Since the start of the program in 2001, aspects of Chinese culture have been listed by [[UNESCO]] as [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]. Throughout the [[history of China]], Chinese culture has been heavily influenced by [[Confucianism]]. Credited with shaping much of Chinese thought, [[Confucianism]] was the official [[philosophy]] throughout most of [[Imperial Chinese|Imperial China]]'s history, institutionalizing values like [[filial piety]], which implied the performance of certain [[Li (Confucian)|shared rituals]]. Thus, villagers lavished on [[Chinese funeral rituals|funeral]] and [[Chinese wedding|wedding]] ceremonies that imitated the Confucian standards of the Emperors.<ref name=\"Cohen\"/> Mastery of Confucian texts provided the primary criterion for [[Imperial examination|entry into the imperial bureaucracy]], but even those degree-holders who did not enter the bureaucracy or who left it held increased social influence in their home areas, contributing to the homogenizing of Han Chinese culture. Other factors contributing to the development of a shared Han culture included [[urbanization]] and geographically vast but integrated commodity markets.<ref name=\"Cohen\"/>\n\n=== Language ===\n{{Main|Chinese language}}\n{{see also|Standard Chinese}}\n\nHan Chinese speak various forms of the Chinese language that are descended from a common early language;<ref name=\"Cohen\"/> one of the names of the language groups is ''Hanyu'' ({{zh|t={{linktext|\u6f22\u8a9e}} |s={{linktext|\u6c49\u8bed}} |links=no}}), literally the \"Han language\".

While written vernacular forms of other varieties of Chinese exist, such as [[written Cantonese]], written Chinese based on Mandarin is widely understood by speakers of all varieties and has taken up the dominant position among written forms, formerly occupied by literary Chinese. Thus, although residents of different regions would not necessarily understand each other's speech, they generally share a common written language, Standard Written Chinese and Literary Chinese (these two writing styles can merge into a \u534a\u767d\u534a\u6587 writing style).\n\nFrom the 1950s, [[Simplified Chinese characters]] were adopted in mainland China and later in Singapore and Malaysia, while Chinese communities in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and overseas countries continue to use [[Traditional Chinese characters]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Although significant differences exist between the two character sets, they are largely [[mutually intelligible]].\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Guiyuan Temple Wuhan3.jpg|left|thumb|Chinese bell tower]]\n\nHan Chinese architectural style is unique and native to Han Chinese.\n\n=== Names ===\n{{Main|Chinese name|List of common Chinese surnames}}\n\nIn China, the notion of [[Baixing|hundred surnames]] ({{lang|zh|\u767e\u5bb6\u59d3}}) is crucial identity point of Han people.<ref name=\"Anth\">Ebrey, Patricia [http://faculty.washington.edu/stevehar/ANTH470Ebrey.pdf Surnames and Han Chinese Identity], University of Washington</ref>\n\n=== Fashion ===\n{{Main|Chinese clothing|Hanfu}}\n[[File:Gu Hongzhong's Night Revels, Detail 1.jpg|thumb|A [[Song dynasty]] Chinese painting ''Night Revels of Han Xizai'' showing scholars in scholar's robes and musicians dressed in a [[Hanfu]] variant, 12th-century remake of a 10th-century original by [[Gu Hongzhong]].]]\n[[File:Yellow and green hanfu.jpg|thumb|left|Woman wearing yellow and green [[hanfu]], a traditional dress of the Han Chinese.]]\n\nHan Chinese clothing has been shaped through its dynastic traditions as well as foreign influences.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Chinese Clothing: Costumes, Adornments and Culture (Arts of China) |last= Yang |first=Shaorong |publisher= Long River Press  |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-59265-019-4 |page=3}}</ref> Han Chinese clothing showcases the traditional fashion sensibilities of Chinese clothing traditions and forms one of the major cultural facets of Chinese civilization.<ref name=\"Brown, 2006 79\">{{Cite book |title=China, Japan, Korea: Culture and Customs |last= Brown |first=John |publisher= Createspace Independent Publishing  |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-4196-4893-9 |page=79}}</ref> Hanfu ({{lang|zh-hant|\u6f22\u670d}}) or traditional Han clothing comprises all traditional clothing classifications of the Han Chinese with a recorded history of more than three millennia until the end of the Ming Dynasty.

Indigenous Confucianism and Taoism share aspects of being a philosophy or a religion, and neither demand exclusive adherence, resulting in a culture of tolerance and [[syncretism]], where multiple religions or belief systems are often practiced in concert with local customs and traditions. Han Chinese culture has for long been influenced by [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, while in recent centuries Christianity has also gained a foothold among the population.{{Citation needed|date = November 2018}}\n\nChinese folk religion is a set of worship traditions of the ethnic deities of the Han people. It involves the worship of various figures in [[Chinese mythology]], folk heroes such as [[Guan Yu]] and [[Qu Yuan]], mythological creatures such as the [[Chinese dragon]], or family, clan and national ancestors. These practices vary from region to region, and do not characterize an organized religion, though many [[traditional Chinese holidays]] such as the [[Duanwu Festival|Duanwu (or Dragon Boat) Festival]], [[Qingming Festival|Qingming]], and the [[Mid-Autumn Festival]] come from the most popular of these traditions.\n\nTaoism, another indigenous religion, is also widely practiced in both its folk forms and as an organized religion, and has influenced Chinese art, poetry, philosophy, [[Traditional Chinese medicine|medicine]], [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]], alchemy and chemistry, cuisine, [[Chinese martial arts|martial arts]], and [[Chinese architecture|architecture]]. Taoism was the state religion of the early Han Dynasty, and also often enjoyed state patronage under subsequent emperors and dynasties.\n\nConfucianism, although sometimes described as a religion, is a governing philosophy and moral code with some religious elements like ancestor worship. It is deeply ingrained in Chinese culture and was the official state philosophy in China during the Han Dynasty and unto the fall of imperial China in the 20th century.{{Citation needed|date = November 2018}}\n\nDuring the Han Dynasty, [[Confucian]] ideals were the dominant ideology.  Near the end of the dynasty, Buddhism entered China, later gaining popularity. Historically, Buddhism alternated between periods of state tolerance (and even patronage) and [[Four Buddhist Persecutions in China|persecution]]. In its original form, Buddhism was at odds with the native Chinese religions, especially with the elite, as certain Buddhist values often conflicted with Chinese sensibilities. However, through centuries of assimilation, adaptation, and syncretism, [[Chinese Buddhism]] gained an accepted place in the culture. Mahayana would come to be influenced by Confucianism and Taoism, and exerted influence in turn \u2013 such as in the form of [[Neo-Confucianism]].\n\nThough [[Christianity in China|Christian influence in China]] existed as early as the 7th century, Christianity did not begin to gain a significant foothold in China until the establishment of contact with Europeans during the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties. Chinese practices at odds with Christian beliefs resulted in the [[Chinese Rites controversy]], and a subsequent reduction in Christian influence.

Historically, the main entrance to the station was on Stephenson Street, just off New Street. As of 2020, the station has entrances on Stephenson Street, Smallbrook Queensway, Hill Street and Navigation Street.\n\nNew Street is the [[List of busiest railway stations in Great Britain|sixth busiest railway station]] in the UK and the busiest outside London, with 47.9 million passenger entries and exits between April 2018 and March 2019.

Outside Birmingham, in [[Solihull]], is {{rws|Birmingham International}}, which serves [[Birmingham Airport]] and the [[National Exhibition Centre]].\n===Railway operations===\nNew Street is the hub of the West Midlands rail network, as well as being a major national hub. The station is one of seventeen operated and managed by Network Rail.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/eNRT/May13/Commercial_Information.pdf |title=Commercial information |date=May 2013 |work=Complete National Rail Timetable |publisher=Network Rail |location=London |page=43 |accessdate=5 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904231906/http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/eNRT/May13/Commercial_Information.pdf |archive-date=4 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Network Rail also provides operational staff for the station.\n\nStation staff are provided on all platforms to assist with the safe 'dispatch' of trains. For operational reasons all trains departing New Street much be dispatched via the use of [[UK railway signalling|Right Away (RA)]] indicators. RA indicators display a signal informing the train driver it is safe to start the train, instead of using more traditional bell or hand signals.\n\nThe 12 through platforms are divided into ''a'' and ''b'' ends, with an extra bay platform called 4c between 4b and 5b, with the ''b'' end of the station towards Wolverhampton, this in effect allows twice the platforms. Longer trains that are too long for one section of the platform occupy the entire length of the platform, such as [[British Rail Class 390|Class 390]] or [[InterCity 125|HSTs]].\n\nTrains departing towards Proof House Junction (''a'' end) can depart from any platform, but there are restrictions on trains departing from the ''b'' end. All platforms can accommodate trains heading towards Wolverhampton, however due the platform layout and road bridge supports, only 5\u201312 can accommodate trains heading towards Five Ways. There are a number of sidings on the station for the stabling of trains; between platforms 5/6, 7/8, 9/10. The bay platforms at either end of platform 12 have been removed during the current{{when|date=June 2016}} rebuild. The sidings in front of New Street signal box have also been removed.\n\nAll signalling is controlled by New Street power signal box at the Wolverhampton or ''b'' end of the station; it can be seen at street level on Navigation Street. The station is allocated the [[IATA location identifier]] [http://www.theairdb.com/airport/QQN.html QQN].\n\n====Approach tunnels====\nAll trains arriving and departing must use one of the several tunnels around the station.<ref name=\"Nstr18541967\"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Railway Track Diagrams 4: Midlands & North West |editor-last=Bridge |editor-first=Mike |isbn=978-0-9549866-7-4 |oclc=880581044 |last1=Yonge |first1=John |last2=Padgett |first2=David |last3=Szwenk |first3=John |edition=3rd |date=August 2013 |origyear=1990 |publisher=Trackmaps |location=Bradford on Avon |at=map 16 |ref=harv }}</ref>\n\n*Stour Valley Line Tunnel \u2013 heads westwards towards Soho Junction & Wolverhampton, and passes under the [[National Indoor Arena]]. This tunnel is {{convert|927|yard|m}} long in total, comprising the original New Street North Tunnel, {{convert|751|yard|m}} and extension: 'Arena' Tunnel, {{convert|176|yard|m}}. The former was opened in 1852 as part of the [[Stour Valley Line]], and holds two tracks.\n*New Street South Tunnel \u2013 {{convert|254|yard|m}} long, heading eastbound, passing under the [[Bull Ring Shopping Centre|Bullring]], and {{rws|Birmingham Moor Street}} station, heading towards [[Duddeston railway station|Duddeston]], [[Adderley Park railway station|Adderley Park]], the [[Camp Hill Line]] and the [[Cross Country Route|Derby lines]] towards [[Tamworth railway station|Tamworth]]. This tunnel opened in 1854, originally holding two tracks; it was widened in 1896 to hold four tracks, with two double-track parallel bores.\n*Gloucester Line Tunnels \u2013 are four separate tunnels heading south-west towards [[Five Ways railway station|Five Ways]]. Heading from New Street in sequence the tunnels are named Holliday Street Tunnel, {{convert|307|yard|m}} long; Canal Tunnel, {{convert|225|yard|m}} long, passing under the [[Birmingham Canal Navigations]]; Granville Street Tunnel, {{convert|81|yard|m}} long; and Bath Row Tunnel, {{convert|210|yard|m}} long. These tunnels opened in 1885 as part of the [[Birmingham West Suburban Railway]] and hold two tracks.\n\n===Customer service and ticketing===\nNetwork Rail, as well as operating the station, operate a customer reception located on the main concourse, and provide mobility assistance and train dispatch. The booking office and barriers are operated by [[Avanti West Coast]], with customer service or floor walker staff provided by CrossCountry and Network Rail. Avanti West Coast operates a first class lounge and [[Transport for West Midlands|Network West Midlands]] also provides a public transport information point for the station.\n\nThe station is a [[penalty fare]] station for [[West Midlands Railway]] and [[London Northwestern Railway]] (West Midlands Trains' [[brand|brands]]). This scheme is operated both onboard trains and at the automatic ticket barriers at the station. The other train operating companies that use the station do not operate penalty fare schemes.\n\n===Pollution and air quality concerns===\nThe station is designated as underground. There are fans that remove fumes but there are still a large number of services operated by diesel trains despite the whole station being electrified in the 1960s. There have been environmental concerns about the level of pollution in the station in particular NOx.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-england-birmingham-45061470?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c%26%27More%20improvements%27%20needed%20to%20cut%20station%20air%20pollution%26&ns_fee=0#post_5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c|title=BBC item regarding New Street Pollution|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Train operating companies===\nSince the [[privatisation of British Rail]] there have been thirteen [[train operating company|train companies]] that have regularly called at New Street: \n[[Arriva Trains Wales]], [[Avanti West Coast]], [[Central Trains]], [[CrossCountry]], [[First North Western]], [[London Midland]], [[Silverlink]], [[Virgin CrossCountry]], [[Virgin Trains West Coast]], [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]], [[Wales & Borders]], [[Wales & West]] and [[West Midlands Trains]].\n\nCurrently Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Transport for Wales and West Midlands Trains provide services from New Street. [[Chiltern Railways]] have occasionally used New Street during engineering works.\n\nWest Midlands Trains operates a traincrew depot at the station and stables some trains overnight around the station. For the most part, they use [[Soho TMD]] for electric traction units, with its non-electric units kept at [[Tyseley TMD]] to the southeast of Birmingham.\n\nCrossCountry also operates a traincrew depot at the station; it uses Tyseley TMD for the [[British Rail Class 170|Class 170]] units, and its Voyagers are based at [[Central Rivers TMD]].\n\n==Train services==\n[[File:Birmingham & West Mids Passenger Railway Map.JPG|thumb|Map of passenger railways in the Birmingham & West Midlands area]]\nThe basic Monday to Saturday off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is as follows:\n\n[[Avanti West Coast]]\n* 3tph to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] (1 via Rugby, 1 via Watford Junction and 1 via Milton Keynes Central).

Outside Birmingham, in [[Solihull]], is {{rws|Birmingham International}}, which serves [[Birmingham Airport]] and the [[National Exhibition Centre]].\n===Railway operations===\nNew Street is the hub of the West Midlands rail network, as well as being a major national hub. The station is one of seventeen operated and managed by Network Rail.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/eNRT/May13/Commercial_Information.pdf |title=Commercial information |date=May 2013 |work=Complete National Rail Timetable |publisher=Network Rail |location=London |page=43 |accessdate=5 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904231906/http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/eNRT/May13/Commercial_Information.pdf |archive-date=4 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Network Rail also provides operational staff for the station.\n\nStation staff are provided on all platforms to assist with the safe 'dispatch' of trains. For operational reasons all trains departing New Street much be dispatched via the use of [[UK railway signalling|Right Away (RA)]] indicators. RA indicators display a signal informing the train driver it is safe to start the train, instead of using more traditional bell or hand signals.\n\nThe 12 through platforms are divided into ''a'' and ''b'' ends, with an extra bay platform called 4c between 4b and 5b, with the ''b'' end of the station towards Wolverhampton, this in effect allows twice the platforms. Longer trains that are too long for one section of the platform occupy the entire length of the platform, such as [[British Rail Class 390|Class 390]] or [[InterCity 125|HSTs]].\n\nTrains departing towards Proof House Junction (''a'' end) can depart from any platform, but there are restrictions on trains departing from the ''b'' end. All platforms can accommodate trains heading towards Wolverhampton, however due the platform layout and road bridge supports, only 5\u201312 can accommodate trains heading towards Five Ways. There are a number of sidings on the station for the stabling of trains; between platforms 5/6, 7/8, 9/10. The bay platforms at either end of platform 12 have been removed during the current{{when|date=June 2016}} rebuild. The sidings in front of New Street signal box have also been removed.\n\nAll signalling is controlled by New Street power signal box at the Wolverhampton or ''b'' end of the station; it can be seen at street level on Navigation Street. The station is allocated the [[IATA location identifier]] [http://www.theairdb.com/airport/QQN.html QQN].\n\n====Approach tunnels====\nAll trains arriving and departing must use one of the several tunnels around the station.<ref name=\"Nstr18541967\"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Railway Track Diagrams 4: Midlands & North West |editor-last=Bridge |editor-first=Mike |isbn=978-0-9549866-7-4 |oclc=880581044 |last1=Yonge |first1=John |last2=Padgett |first2=David |last3=Szwenk |first3=John |edition=3rd |date=August 2013 |origyear=1990 |publisher=Trackmaps |location=Bradford on Avon |at=map 16 |ref=harv }}</ref>\n\n*Stour Valley Line Tunnel \u2013 heads westwards towards Soho Junction & Wolverhampton, and passes under the [[National Indoor Arena]]. This tunnel is {{convert|927|yard|m}} long in total, comprising the original New Street North Tunnel, {{convert|751|yard|m}} and extension: 'Arena' Tunnel, {{convert|176|yard|m}}. The former was opened in 1852 as part of the [[Stour Valley Line]], and holds two tracks.\n*New Street South Tunnel \u2013 {{convert|254|yard|m}} long, heading eastbound, passing under the [[Bull Ring Shopping Centre|Bullring]], and {{rws|Birmingham Moor Street}} station, heading towards [[Duddeston railway station|Duddeston]], [[Adderley Park railway station|Adderley Park]], the [[Camp Hill Line]] and the [[Cross Country Route|Derby lines]] towards [[Tamworth railway station|Tamworth]]. This tunnel opened in 1854, originally holding two tracks; it was widened in 1896 to hold four tracks, with two double-track parallel bores.\n*Gloucester Line Tunnels \u2013 are four separate tunnels heading south-west towards [[Five Ways railway station|Five Ways]]. Heading from New Street in sequence the tunnels are named Holliday Street Tunnel, {{convert|307|yard|m}} long; Canal Tunnel, {{convert|225|yard|m}} long, passing under the [[Birmingham Canal Navigations]]; Granville Street Tunnel, {{convert|81|yard|m}} long; and Bath Row Tunnel, {{convert|210|yard|m}} long. These tunnels opened in 1885 as part of the [[Birmingham West Suburban Railway]] and hold two tracks.\n\n===Customer service and ticketing===\nNetwork Rail, as well as operating the station, operate a customer reception located on the main concourse, and provide mobility assistance and train dispatch. The booking office and barriers are operated by [[Avanti West Coast]], with customer service or floor walker staff provided by CrossCountry and Network Rail. Avanti West Coast operates a first class lounge and [[Transport for West Midlands|Network West Midlands]] also provides a public transport information point for the station.\n\nThe station is a [[penalty fare]] station for [[West Midlands Railway]] and [[London Northwestern Railway]] (West Midlands Trains' [[brand|brands]]). This scheme is operated both onboard trains and at the automatic ticket barriers at the station. The other train operating companies that use the station do not operate penalty fare schemes.\n\n===Pollution and air quality concerns===\nThe station is designated as underground. There are fans that remove fumes but there are still a large number of services operated by diesel trains despite the whole station being electrified in the 1960s. There have been environmental concerns about the level of pollution in the station in particular NOx.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-england-birmingham-45061470?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c%26%27More%20improvements%27%20needed%20to%20cut%20station%20air%20pollution%26&ns_fee=0#post_5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c|title=BBC item regarding New Street Pollution|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Train operating companies===\nSince the [[privatisation of British Rail]] there have been thirteen [[train operating company|train companies]] that have regularly called at New Street: \n[[Arriva Trains Wales]], [[Avanti West Coast]], [[Central Trains]], [[CrossCountry]], [[First North Western]], [[London Midland]], [[Silverlink]], [[Virgin CrossCountry]], [[Virgin Trains West Coast]], [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]], [[Wales & Borders]], [[Wales & West]] and [[West Midlands Trains]].\n\nCurrently Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Transport for Wales and West Midlands Trains provide services from New Street. [[Chiltern Railways]] have occasionally used New Street during engineering works.\n\nWest Midlands Trains operates a traincrew depot at the station and stables some trains overnight around the station. For the most part, they use [[Soho TMD]] for electric traction units, with its non-electric units kept at [[Tyseley TMD]] to the southeast of Birmingham.\n\nCrossCountry also operates a traincrew depot at the station; it uses Tyseley TMD for the [[British Rail Class 170|Class 170]] units, and its Voyagers are based at [[Central Rivers TMD]].\n\n==Train services==\n[[File:Birmingham & West Mids Passenger Railway Map.JPG|thumb|Map of passenger railways in the Birmingham & West Midlands area]]\nThe basic Monday to Saturday off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is as follows:\n\n[[Avanti West Coast]]\n* 3tph to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] (1 via Rugby, 1 via Watford Junction and 1 via Milton Keynes Central).
