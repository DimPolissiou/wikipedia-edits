Pre-Columbian art thrived over a wide timescale, from 1800 BC to AD 1500. Certain artistic characteristics were repeated throughout the region, namely a preference for angular, linear patterns, and three-dimensional ceramics.\n\n[[File:De la Conquista a 1930 (2011).jpg|thumb|left|[[Mexican muralism|Mural]] by [[Diego Rivera]] at the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] depicting the history of Mexico from the Conquest to early 20th century.]]\n\nNotable handicrafts include clay pottery from the valley of Oaxaca and the village of Tonala. Colorfully embroidered cotton garments, cotton or wool shawls and outer garments, and colorful baskets and rugs are seen everywhere. Mexico is also known for its [[Mesoamerican architecture|pre-Columbian architecture]], especially for public, ceremonial and urban monumental buildings and structures.\n\nFollowing the conquest, the first artistic efforts were directed at evangelization and the related task of building churches. The Spanish initially co-opted many indigenous stonemasons and sculptors to build churches, monuments and other religious art, such as [[Altar (Catholicism)|altars]]. The prevailing style during this era was [[Baroque]].\nIn the period from independence to the early 20th century, Mexican fine arts continued to be largely influenced by European traditions.\n\nAfter the [[Mexican Revolution]], a new generation of Mexican artists led a vibrant national movement that incorporated political, historic and folk themes in their work. The painters [[Diego Rivera]], [[Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco]], and [[David Siqueiros]] were the main propagators of [[Mexican muralism]]. Their grand murals often displayed on public buildings, promoted social ideals. [[Rufino Tamayo]] and [[Frida Kahlo]] produced more personal works with abstract elements. Mexican art [[photography]] was largely fostered by the work of [[Manuel \u00c1lvarez Bravo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1064-mexican-muralists-the-big-three-orozco-rivera-siqueiros|title=Mexican muralists: the big three - Orozco, Rivera, Siqueiros. : Mexico Culture & Arts|website=www.mexconnect.com}}</ref>\n\n==Literature==\n{{Main|Mexican literature}}\n[[Image:Sor Juana by Miguel Cabrera.png|175px|thumb|A late 18th-century painting of [[Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz]], poet and writer.]]\n\nMexican literature has its antecedents in the literature of the indigenous settlements of Mesoamerica.

Mesoamerican architecture in Mexico is best known for its public, ceremonial and urban monumental buildings and structures, several of which are the largest monuments in the world. Mesoamerican architecture is divided into three eras, Pre-Classic, Classic, and Post-Classic. Architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] is reputed to have declared the [[Puuc]]-style architecture of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] as the best in the [[Western Hemisphere]].<ref name=\"Freidel\">{{cite web|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/0703/abstracts/maya.html |title=Betraying the Maya |publisher=Archeology Magazine |accessdate=November 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[New Spanish Baroque]] dominated in early colonial Mexico. During the late 17th century to 1750, one of Mexico's most popular architectural styles was Mexican [[Churrigueresque]], which combined [[Amerindian]] and [[Moorish]] decorative influences.\n\nThe [[Academy of San Carlos]], founded in 1788, was the first major art academy in the Americas. The academy promoted [[Neoclassicism]], focusing on Greek and Roman art and architecture. Notable Neoclassical works include the [[Hospicio Caba\u00f1as]], a world heritage site, and the [[Palacio de Miner\u00eda]], both by Spanish Mexican architect [[Manuel Tols\u00e1]].\n\nFrom 1864 to 1867, during the [[Second Mexican Empire]], [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] was installed as emperor of Mexico. His architectural legacy lies in the redesigning of the [[Castillo de Chapultepec]] and creating the [[Paseo de la Reforma]]. This intervention, financed largely by France, was brief, but it began a period of French influence in architecture and culture. The style was emphasized during the presidency of [[Porfirio Diaz]] who was a pronounced [[francophile]]. Notable works from the [[Porfiriato]] include the [[Palacio de Correos de Mexico|Palacio de Correos]] and a large [[Rail transport in Mexico|network of railways]].\n\nAfter the [[Mexican Revolution]] in 1917, idealization of the indigenous and the traditional symbolized attempts to reach into the past and retrieve what had been lost in the race toward modernization.\n\nFunctionalism, expressionism, and other schools left their imprint on a large number of works in which Mexican stylistic elements have been combined with European and American techniques, most notably the work of [[Pritzker Prize]] winner [[Luis Barrag\u00e1n]]. His personal home, the [[Luis Barrag\u00e1n House and Studio]], is a [[World Heritage Site]].\n\n[[Enrique Norten]], the founder of TEN Arquitectos, has been awarded several honors for his work in [[modern architecture]]. His work expresses a modernity that reinforces the government's desire to present a new image of Mexico as an industrialized country with a global presence.\n\nOther notable and emerging contemporary architects include [[Mario Schjetnan]], [[Michel Rojkind]], [[Isaac Broid Zajman]],  [[Bernardo G\u00f3mez-Pimienta]], and [[Alberto Kalach]].\n\n==Cinema==\n[[File:Cineteca Nacional 05.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The National film library.]]\n{{Main|Cinema of Mexico}}\n{{See also|Television in Mexico}}\n\nThe history of Mexican cinema dates to the beginning of the 20th century when several enthusiasts of the new medium documented historical events \u2013 most particularly the Mexican Revolution. The [[Golden Age of Mexican cinema]] is the name given to the period between 1935 and 1959, where the quality and economic success of the cinema of Mexico reached its peak. An era when renowned actors such as [[Cantinflas]] and [[Dolores del R\u00edo]] appeared on the silver screen.\n\nPresent-day film makers include [[Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu]] (''[[Amores perros]]'', ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]''), [[Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n]] (''[[Children of Men]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]''), [[Guillermo del Toro]] (''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]''), [[Carlos Reygadas]] (''[[Silent Light|Stellet Licht]]''), screenwriter [[Guillermo Arriaga]] and owners [[Guillermo Navarro]] and [[Emmanuel Lubezki]].\n\n==National holidays==\n{{Main|Public holidays in Mexico}}\n\n{{see also|Christmas in Mexico}}\n\n[[Image:GritoIxmiquilpan.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Municipal president giving the \"[[Grito de Dolores|grito]]\" of \"Viva M\u00e9xico\" at the commencement of Independence Day festivities in 2008]]\n\nMexicans celebrate their [[Mexican War of Independence|Independence from Spain]] on September 16, and other holidays with festivals known as \"Fiestas\".

During these festivities, the people pray and burn candles to honor their saints in churches decorated with flowers and colorful utensils. They also hold large parades, fireworks, dance competitions, beauty pageant contest, party and buy refreshments in the marketplaces and public squares.

[[Chipotle]], a smoked-dried jalape\u00f1o pepper, is also common in Mexican cuisine. Many Mexican dishes also contain [[onion]]s and [[garlic]], which are also some of Mexico's staple foods.\n\nNext to [[Maize|corn]], [[rice]] is the most common grain in Mexican cuisine. According to food writer Karen Hursh Graber, the initial introduction of rice to Spain from North Africa in the 14th century led to the Spanish introduction of rice to Mexico at the port of [[Veracruz]] in the 1520s. This, Graber says, created one of the earliest instances of the world's greatest [[Fusion cuisine]]'s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nIn southeastern Mexico, especially in the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]], spicy vegetable and meat dishes are common. The cuisine of Southeastern Mexico has quite a bit of Caribbean influence, given its geographical location. Seafood is commonly prepared in the states that border the Pacific Ocean or the [[Gulf of Mexico]], the latter having a famous reputation for its fish dishes, ''\u00e0 la veracruzana''.\n\nIn contemporary times, various world cuisines have become popular in Mexico, thus adopting a Mexican fusion. For example, [[sushi]] in Mexico is often made by using a variety of sauces based on [[mango]] and [[tamarind]], and very often served with [[serrano pepper|serrano]]-chili blended soy sauce, or complemented with vinegar, habanero peppers, and chipotle peppers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n[[Chocolate]] originated in Mexico and was prized by the [[Aztecs]].

The original inhabitants of the land used drums (such as the [[teponaztli]]), [[flute]]s, [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattles]], [[conch]]es as trumpets and their [[voice]]s to make music and dances. This ancient music is still played in some parts of Mexico. However, much of the traditional contemporary music of Mexico was written during and after the Spanish colonial period, using many [[old world]] influenced instruments. Many traditional instruments, such as the [[Mexican vihuela]] used in [[Mariachi music]], were adapted from their old world predecessors and are now considered very Mexican.\n\n[[Image:JarabeTapatio.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Jarabe Tapat\u00edo]] in the traditional [[China Poblana]] dress.]]\n\nMexican society enjoys a vast array of music genres, showing the diversity of Mexican culture. Traditional music includes [[Mariachi]], [[banda music|Banda]], [[Norte\u00f1o (music)|Norte\u00f1o]], [[Ranchera]] and [[Corrido (Mexico)|Corrido]]s. Mexicans also listen to contemporary music such as [[Mexican pop music|pop]] and [[Mexican rock music|Mexican rock]]. Mexico has the largest media industry in Latin America, producing Mexican artists who are famous in the [[Americas]] and parts of Europe.\n\nFolk songs called [[corridos]] have been popular in Mexico since the early nineteen hundreds. It may tell the story of the Mexican Revolution, pride, [[Mestizaje]], romance, poverty, politics or crime. Notable [[Afro-Mexican]] contributions to the country's music are the [[Son Jarocho]] and the [[marimba]].\n\nMariachis perform along streets, festivals and restaurants. A common Mariachi group can include singers, [[violin]]s, a [[Guitarr\u00f3n mexicano|guitarr\u00f3n]], a [[guitarra de golpe]], vihuela, [[guitar]]s, and [[trumpet]]s. The most prominent Mariachi group is [[Vargas de Tecalitl\u00e1n]], which was originally formed in 1897.\n\n[[File:PolancoVoladoresdePapantla.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Danza de los Voladores]], a ritual dance performed by the [[Totonacs]].]]\n\nOther styles of traditional regional music in M\u00e9xico: [[Huapango]] or [[Son Huasteco]] (Huasteca, northeastern regions, violin and two guitars known as quinta huapanguera and [[jarana huasteca|jarana]]), Tambora (Sinaloa, mainly [[brass instruments]]) [[Duranguense]], Jarana (most of the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula) and [[Norte\u00f1a]] (North style, [[redoba]] and [[accordion]]).\n\nFolk dances are a feature of Mexican culture. Significant in dance tradition is the \"[[Jarabe Tapat\u00edo]]\", known as \"Mexican hat dance\". Traditional dancers perform a sequence of hopping steps, heel and toe-tapping movements.\n\nAmong the most known \"classical\" composers: [[Manuel M.

Some well-known Mexican pop singers are [[Luis Miguel]] and [[Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez]]. Latin rock musicians such as [[Carlos Santana]], [[Caf\u00e9 Tacuba]] and [[Caifanes]] have incorporated Mexican folk tunes into their music.

Pre-Columbian art thrived over a wide timescale, from 1800 BC to AD 1500. Certain artistic characteristics were repeated throughout the region, namely a preference for angular, linear patterns, and three-dimensional ceramics.\n\n[[File:De la Conquista a 1930 (2011).jpg|thumb|left|[[Mexican muralism|Mural]] by [[Diego Rivera]] at the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] depicting the history of Mexico from the Conquest to early 20th century.]]\n\nNotable handicrafts include clay pottery from the valley of Oaxaca and the village of Tonala. Colorfully embroidered cotton garments, cotton or wool shawls and outer garments, and colorful baskets and rugs are seen everywhere. Mexico is also known for its [[Mesoamerican architecture|pre-Columbian architecture]], especially for public, ceremonial and urban monumental buildings and structures.\n\nFollowing the conquest, the first artistic efforts were directed at evangelization and the related task of building churches. The Spanish initially co-opted many indigenous stonemasons and sculptors to build churches, monuments and other religious art, such as [[Altar (Catholicism)|altars]]. The prevailing style during this era was [[Baroque]].\nIn the period from independence to the early 20th century, Mexican fine arts continued to be largely influenced by European traditions.\n\nAfter the [[Mexican Revolution]], a new generation of Mexican artists led a vibrant national movement that incorporated political, historic and folk themes in their work. The painters [[Diego Rivera]], [[Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco]], and [[David Siqueiros]] were the main propagators of [[Mexican muralism]]. Their grand murals often displayed on public buildings, promoted social ideals. [[Rufino Tamayo]] and [[Frida Kahlo]] produced more personal works with abstract elements.

Mesoamerican architecture in Mexico is best known for its public, ceremonial and urban monumental buildings and structures, several of which are the largest monuments in the world. Mesoamerican architecture is divided into three eras, Pre-Classic, Classic, and Post-Classic. Architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] is reputed to have declared the [[Puuc]]-style architecture of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] as the best in the [[Western Hemisphere]].<ref name=\"Freidel\">{{cite web|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/0703/abstracts/maya.html |title=Betraying the Maya |publisher=Archeology Magazine |accessdate=November 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[New Spanish Baroque]] dominated in early colonial Mexico. During the late 17th century to 1750, one of Mexico's most popular architectural styles was Mexican [[Churrigueresque]], which combined [[Amerindian]] and [[Moorish]] decorative influences.\n\nThe [[Academy of San Carlos]], founded in 1788, was the first major art academy in the Americas. The academy promoted [[Neoclassicism]], focusing on Greek and Roman art and architecture. Notable Neoclassical works include the [[Hospicio Caba\u00f1as]], a world heritage site, and the [[Palacio de Miner\u00eda]], both by Spanish Mexican architect [[Manuel Tols\u00e1]].\n\nFrom 1864 to 1867, during the [[Second Mexican Empire]], [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] was installed as emperor of Mexico. His architectural legacy lies in the redesigning of the [[Castillo de Chapultepec]] and creating the [[Paseo de la Reforma]]. This intervention, financed largely by France, was brief, but it began a period of French influence in architecture and culture. The style was emphasized during the presidency of [[Porfirio Diaz]] who was a pronounced [[francophile]]. Notable works from the [[Porfiriato]] include the [[Palacio de Correos de Mexico|Palacio de Correos]] and a large [[Rail transport in Mexico|network of railways]].\n\nAfter the [[Mexican Revolution]] in 1917, idealization of the indigenous and the traditional symbolized attempts to reach into the past and retrieve what had been lost in the race toward modernization.\n\nFunctionalism, expressionism, and other schools left their imprint on a large number of works in which Mexican stylistic elements have been combined with European and American techniques, most notably the work of [[Pritzker Prize]] winner [[Luis Barrag\u00e1n]]. His personal home, the [[Luis Barrag\u00e1n House and Studio]], is a [[World Heritage Site]].\n\n[[Enrique Norten]], the founder of TEN Arquitectos, has been awarded several honors for his work in [[modern architecture]]. His work expresses a modernity that reinforces the government's desire to present a new image of Mexico as an industrialized country with a global presence.\n\nOther notable and emerging contemporary architects include [[Mario Schjetnan]], [[Michel Rojkind]], [[Isaac Broid Zajman]],  [[Bernardo G\u00f3mez-Pimienta]], and [[Alberto Kalach]].\n\n==Cinema==\n[[File:Cineteca Nacional 05.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The National film library.]]\n{{Main|Cinema of Mexico}}\n{{See also|Television in Mexico}}\n\nThe history of Mexican cinema dates to the beginning of the 20th century when several enthusiasts of the new medium documented historical events \u2013 most particularly the Mexican Revolution.

According to food writer Karen Hursh Graber, the initial introduction of rice to Spain from North Africa in the 14th century led to the Spanish introduction of rice to Mexico at the port of [[Veracruz]] in the 1520s. This, Graber says, created one of the earliest instances of the world's greatest [[Fusion cuisine]]'s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nIn southeastern Mexico, especially in the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]], spicy vegetable and meat dishes are common. The cuisine of Southeastern Mexico has quite a bit of Caribbean influence, given its geographical location. Seafood is commonly prepared in the states that border the Pacific Ocean or the [[Gulf of Mexico]], the latter having a famous reputation for its fish dishes, ''\u00e0 la veracruzana''.\n\nIn contemporary times, various world cuisines have become popular in Mexico, thus adopting a Mexican fusion. For example, [[sushi]] in Mexico is often made by using a variety of sauces based on [[mango]] and [[tamarind]], and very often served with [[serrano pepper|serrano]]-chili blended soy sauce, or complemented with vinegar, habanero peppers, and chipotle peppers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n[[Chocolate]] originated in Mexico and was prized by the [[Aztecs]]. It remains an important ingredient in Mexican cookery.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n==Music and dance==\n{{Main|Music of Mexico|Folk dance of Mexico}}\n[[File:8. MFF Pra\u017esk\u00fd jarmark 3540.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Northern Dance in Nuevo Leon]]\n\nThe foundation of Mexican music comes from its indigenous sounds and heritage. The original inhabitants of the land used drums (such as the [[teponaztli]]), [[flute]]s, [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattles]], [[conch]]es as trumpets and their [[voice]]s to make music and dances. This ancient music is still played in some parts of Mexico. However, much of the traditional contemporary music of Mexico was written during and after the Spanish colonial period, using many [[old world]] influenced instruments. Many traditional instruments, such as the [[Mexican vihuela]] used in [[Mariachi music]], were adapted from their old world predecessors and are now considered very Mexican.\n\n[[Image:JarabeTapatio.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Jarabe Tapat\u00edo]] in the traditional [[China Poblana]] dress.]]\n\nMexican society enjoys a vast array of music genres, showing the diversity of Mexican culture. Traditional music includes [[Mariachi]], [[banda music|Banda]], [[Norte\u00f1o (music)|Norte\u00f1o]], [[Ranchera]] and [[Corrido (Mexico)|Corrido]]s. Mexicans also listen to contemporary music such as [[Mexican pop music|pop]] and [[Mexican rock music|Mexican rock]]. Mexico has the largest media industry in Latin America, producing Mexican artists who are famous in the [[Americas]] and parts of Europe.\n\nFolk songs called [[corridos]] have been popular in Mexico since the early nineteen hundreds. It may tell the story of the Mexican Revolution, pride, [[Mestizaje]], romance, poverty, politics or crime. Notable [[Afro-Mexican]] contributions to the country's music are the [[Son Jarocho]] and the [[marimba]].\n\nMariachis perform along streets, festivals and restaurants. A common Mariachi group can include singers, [[violin]]s, a [[Guitarr\u00f3n mexicano|guitarr\u00f3n]], a [[guitarra de golpe]], vihuela, [[guitar]]s, and [[trumpet]]s. The most prominent Mariachi group is [[Vargas de Tecalitl\u00e1n]], which was originally formed in 1897.\n\n[[File:PolancoVoladoresdePapantla.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Danza de los Voladores]], a ritual dance performed by the [[Totonacs]].]]\n\nOther styles of traditional regional music in M\u00e9xico: [[Huapango]] or [[Son Huasteco]] (Huasteca, northeastern regions, violin and two guitars known as quinta huapanguera and [[jarana huasteca|jarana]]), Tambora (Sinaloa, mainly [[brass instruments]]) [[Duranguense]], Jarana (most of the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula) and [[Norte\u00f1a]] (North style, [[redoba]] and [[accordion]]).\n\nFolk dances are a feature of Mexican culture. Significant in dance tradition is the \"[[Jarabe Tapat\u00edo]]\", known as \"Mexican hat dance\". Traditional dancers perform a sequence of hopping steps, heel and toe-tapping movements.\n\nAmong the most known \"classical\" composers: [[Manuel M. Ponce]] (\"Estrellita\"), Revueltas, Jord\u00e1 (Elodia), [[Ricardo Castro]], [[Juventino Rosas]] (\"Sobre las olas\"), Carrillo (Sonido 13), Ibarra, Pablo Moncayo (Huapango) and [[Carlos Ch\u00e1vez]].\n\nPopular composers includes: [[Agust\u00edn Lara]], [[Consuelo Vel\u00e1zquez]] (\"[[B\u00e9same mucho]]\"), [[Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Jim\u00e9nez]], [[Armando Manzanero]], [[\u00c1lvaro Carrillo]], [[Joaqu\u00edn Pardav\u00e9]] and [[Alfonso Ortiz Tirado]].\n\nTraditional Mexican music has influenced the evolution of the [[Mexican pop]] and [[Mexican rock]] genre. Some well-known Mexican pop singers are [[Luis Miguel]] and [[Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez]]. Latin rock musicians such as [[Carlos Santana]], [[Caf\u00e9 Tacuba]] and [[Caifanes]] have incorporated Mexican folk tunes into their music. Traditional Mexican music is still alive in the voices of artists such as [[Lila Downs]].\n\n==Sport==\n{{Main|Sport in Mexico}}\n[[File:Azteca 008.png|thumb|Club Am\u00e9rica vs Cruz Azul at the [[Estadio Azteca]].]]\n\nThe traditional national sport of Mexico is [[Charreria]], which consists of a series of equestrian events. The national horse of Mexico, used in [[Charreria]], is the [[Azteca (horse)|Azteca]]. [[Bullfighting]], a tradition brought from Spain, is also popular. Mexico has the largest venue for bullfighting in the world - the [[Plaza M\u00e9xico]] in Mexico City which seats 48,000 people.\n\n[[Association Football|Football]] is the most popular team sport in Mexico. Most states have their own representative football teams. Among the country's significant teams include [[C.D. Guadalajara|Chivas de Guadalajara]], [[Club Am\u00e9rica]], [[Cruz Azul]], and [[Pumas de la UNAM]]. Notable players include [[Hugo S\u00e1nchez]], [[Claudio Su\u00e1rez]], [[Luis Hern\u00e1ndez (footballer)|Luis Hern\u00e1ndez]], [[Francisco Palencia]], [[Cuauht\u00e9moc Blanco]], [[Memo Ochoa]], [[Jared Borgetti]], [[Rafael M\u00e1rquez]], [[P\u00e1vel Pardo]], and [[Javier Hern\u00e1ndez]].\n\nThe country hosted the [[Summer Olympic Games]] in 1968 and the [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]], and was the first country to host the FIFA World Cup twice.\n\n==See also==\n[[File:DahliaDahlstarSunsetPink.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Dahlia]] was declared the national flower of Mexico in 1963.]]\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[National symbols of Mexico]]\n* [[List of museums in Mexico]] \n* [[Folktales of Mexico]]\n* [[Ghosts in Mexican culture]]\n* [[:Category:Festivals in Mexico|Festivals in Mexico]]\n* [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art]]\n* [[Textiles of Mexico]]\n* [[Mexican ceramics]]\n* [[Traditional Mexican handcrafted toys]]\n* [[China Poblana]]\n* [[Papel picado]]\n* [[Vaquero]]\n* [[Quincea\u00f1era]], celebration of a girl's fifteenth birthday\n* [[Loter\u00eda]], game\n* [[Serape]], shawl\n* [[Conquian]], card game\n* [[Alebrije]], folk art sculptures\n* [[El Chavo del Ocho]], sitcom\n* [[Rodeo]]\n* [[Narcoculture in Mexico]]\n{{div col end|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.geographia.com/mexico/mexicohistory.htm Mexico: History and Culture]\n\n{{Mexico topics}}\n{{Latin America topic|Culture of|Latin American culture}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Culture Of Mexico}}\n[[Category:Mexican culture| ]]\n", "name_user": "2a00:23c8:385:9400:403b:2674:f83:36b", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Mexico"}
