In modern [[Greece]], they are still used for [[ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal number]]s and in contexts similar to those in which [[Roman numerals]] are still used elsewhere in the West. For ordinary [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]]s, however, Greece uses [[Arabic numerals]].\n\n==History==\nThe [[Minoans|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean civilization]]s' [[Linear A]] and [[Linear B]] alphabets used a different system, called [[Aegean numerals]], which included specialised symbols for numbers: {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udd07}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udd10}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;10, {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udd19}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;100, {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udd22}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;1000, and {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udd2b}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;10000.<ref name=Verdun>{{cite web|url=http://www.dma.ens.fr/culturemath/histoire%20des%20maths/htm/Verdan/Verdan.htm|title=Syst\u00e8mes num\u00e9raux en Gr\u00e8ce ancienne: description et mise en perspective historique|author=Samuel Verdan|date=20 March 2007 |accessdate=2 March 2011|language=fr}}</ref>\n\n[[Attic numerals]] was another system that came into use perhaps in the 7th century BC. They were [[acrophonic]], derived (after the initial one) from the first letters of the names of the numbers represented. They ran {{GrGl|Zeta archaic}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, {{GrGl|Pi archaic}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;5, {{GrGl|Delta 04}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;10, {{GrGl|Eta classical}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;100, {{GrGl|Chi normal}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,000, and {{GrGl|Mu classical}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;10,000. The numbers {{nowrap|50, 500, 5,000, and 50,000}} were represented by the letter {{GrGl|Pi archaic}} with minuscule powers of ten written in the top right corner: [[File:Attic_00050.svg|x16px]], [[File:Attic_00500.svg|x16px]], [[File:Attic_05000.svg|x16px]], and [[File:Attic_50000.svg|x16px]].<ref name=\"Verdun\" /> One-half was represented by \u2282 (left half of a full circle).

The units from 1 to 9 are assigned to the first nine letters of the old [[Ionic alphabet]] from [[alpha (letter)|alpha]] to [[theta (letter)|theta]]. Instead of reusing these numbers to form multiples of the higher powers of ten, however, each multiple of ten from 10 to 90 was assigned its own separate letter from the next nine letters of the Ionic alphabet from [[iota (letter)|iota]] to [[koppa (letter)|koppa]]. Each multiple of one hundred from 100 to 900 was then assigned its own separate letter as well, from [[rho (letter)|rho]] to [[sampi (letter)|sampi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gwydir.demon.co.uk/jo/numbers/greek/|title=Classical Greek Numbers|last1=Edkins|first1=Jo|year=2006|accessdate=29 April 2013}}</ref> (The fact that this was ''not'' the traditional location of [[sampi (letter)|sampi]] or its possible predecessor [[san (letter)|san]] has led classicists to conclude that it was no longer in use even locally by the time the system was created.)\n\nThis [[alphabetic numeral system|alphabetic system]] operates on the additive principle in which the numeric values of the letters are added together to obtain the total. For example, 241 was represented as {{GrGl|Sigma classical}}{{GrGl|Mu classical}}{{GrGl|Alpha classical}}&nbsp;(200&nbsp;+&nbsp;40&nbsp;+&nbsp;1). (It was not always the case that the numbers ran from highest to lowest: a 4th-century BC inscription at Athens placed the units to the left of the tens. This practice continued in [[Asia Minor]] well into the [[Roman Greece|Roman period]].<ref name=heman/>) In ancient and medieval manuscripts, these numerals were eventually distinguished from letters using [[overbar]]s: {{overline|\u03b1}}, {{overline|\u03b2}}, {{overline|\u03b3}}, etc. In medieval manuscripts of the [[Book of Revelation]], the [[number of the Beast]] 666 is written as {{overline|\u03c7\u03be\u03db}}&nbsp;(600&nbsp;+&nbsp;60&nbsp;+&nbsp;6). (Numbers larger than 1,000 reused the same letters but included various marks to note the change.) Fractions were indicated as the denominator followed by a ''keraia'' (\u02b9);  \u03b3\u02b9 indicated one third, \u03b4\u02b9 one fourth and so on.  As an exception, special symbol \u2220\u02b9 indicated one half, and \u03b3\u00b0\u02b9 or \u03b3o\u02b9 was two-thirds.  These fractions were additive (also known as [[Egyptian fraction]]s); for example {{nowrap|\u03b4\u02b9 \u03db\u02b9}} indicated {{nowrap|{{frac|4}} + {{frac|6}} {{=}} {{frac|5|12}}}}.\n\nAlthough the [[Greek alphabet#Letter shapes|Greek alphabet]] began with only [[majuscule]] forms, surviving [[papyrus]] manuscripts from [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]] show that [[uncial]] and [[cursive]] [[Greek minuscule|minuscule]] forms began early.{{clarification|date=August 2017|reason=When? Minuscule was introduced in Constantinople not earlier than the first half of the 9th century, see Talk Uppercase/Lowercase}} These new letter forms sometimes replaced the former ones, especially in the case of the obscure numerals. The old Q-shaped koppa (\u03d8) began to be broken up ([[File:Greek Koppa cursive 02.svg|x16px]] and [[File:Greek Koppa cursive 03.svg|x16px]]) and simplified ([[File:Greek Koppa cursive 04.svg|x16px]] and [[File:Greek Koppa cursive 05.svg|x16px]]). The numeral for 6 changed several times. During antiquity, the original letter form of digamma (\u03dc) came to be avoided in favour of a special numerical one ({{GrGl|Digamma angular}}). By the [[Byzantine Greek|Byzantine era]], the letter was known as [[Digamma|episemon]] and written as {{GrGl|Digamma cursive 02}} or {{GrGl|Digamma cursive 06}}. This eventually merged with the [[sigma (letter)|sigma]]-[[tau (letter)|tau]] [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] [[stigma (letter)|stigma]] \u03db ({{GrGl|Digamma cursive 07}} or {{GrGl|Digamma cursive 04}}).\n\n{{anchor|keraia}}In [[modern Greek]], a number of other changes have been made. Instead of extending an over bar over an entire number, the '''''keraia'''''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> ({{lang|el|\u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03af\u03b1}}, <small>lit.</small>&nbsp;\"hornlike projection\") is marked to its upper right, a development of the short marks formerly used for single numbers and fractions. The modern ''keraia'' is a symbol ({{keraia}}) similar to the [[acute accent]] (\u00b4), the [[tonos]] (U+0384,\u0384) and the prime symbol (U+02B9, \u02b9), but has its own [[Unicode]] character as U+0374. [[Alexander the Great]]'s father [[Philip II of Macedon]] is thus known as {{lang|el|\u03a6\u03af\u03bb\u03b9\u03c0\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 \u0392\u02b9}} in modern Greek. A lower left ''keraia'' (Unicode: U+0375, \"Greek Lower Numeral Sign\") is now standard for distinguishing thousands: 2019 is represented as \u0375\u0392\u0399\u0398\u02b9 ({{nowrap|2 \u00d7 1,000 + 10 + 9}}).\n\nThe declining use of ligatures in the 20th century also means that stigma is frequently written as the separate letters \u03a3\u03a4\u02b9, although a single ''keraia'' is used for the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/numerals.html|title=Numerals: Stigma, Koppa, Sampi|author=Nick Nicholas|date=9 April 2005|accessdate=2 March

It was then used by [[Ptolemy]] ({{circa|140}}), [[Theon of Alexandria|Theon]] ({{circa|380}}) and Theon's daughter [[Hypatia of Alexandria|Hypatia]] (died&nbsp;415).\n\nIn [[Ptolemy's table of chords]], the first fairly extensive trigonometric table, there were 360 rows, portions of which looked as follows:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{array}{ccc} \\pi\\varepsilon\\varrho\\iota\\varphi\\varepsilon\\varrho\\varepsilon\\iota\\tilde\\omega\\nu & \\overset{\\text{'}}\\varepsilon\\nu\\vartheta\\varepsilon\\iota\\tilde\\omega\\nu & \\overset{\\text{`}}\\varepsilon\\xi\\eta\\kappa\\omicron\\sigma\\tau\\tilde\\omega\\nu \\\\\n\\begin{array}{|l|} \\hline \\pi\\delta\\angle' \\\\  \\pi\\varepsilon \\\\  \\pi\\varepsilon\\angle' \\\\  \\hline  \\pi\\stigma \\\\  \\pi\\stigma\\angle' \\\\  \\pi\\zeta \\\\  \\hline \\end{array} & \\begin{array}{|r|r|r|} \\hline \\pi & \\mu\\alpha & \\gamma \\\\  \\pi\\alpha & \\delta & \\iota\\varepsilon \\\\  \\pi\\alpha & \\kappa\\zeta & \\kappa\\beta \\\\  \\hline \\pi\\alpha & \\nu & \\kappa\\delta \\\\  \\pi\\beta & \\iota\\gamma & \\iota\\vartheta \\\\  \\pi\\beta & \\lambda\\stigma & \\vartheta \\\\  \\hline \\end{array} & \\begin{array}{|r|r|r|r|} \\hline \\circ & \\circ & \\mu\\stigma & \\kappa\\varepsilon \\\\  \\circ & \\circ & \\mu\\stigma & \\iota\\delta \\\\  \\circ & \\circ & \\mu\\stigma & \\gamma \\\\  \\hline \\circ & \\circ & \\mu\\varepsilon & \\nu\\beta \\\\  \\circ & \\circ & \\mu\\varepsilon & \\mu \\\\  \\circ & \\circ & \\mu\\varepsilon & \\kappa\\vartheta \\\\  \\hline \\end{array}\n\\end{array}\n</math>\nEach number in the first column, labeled {{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u1ff6\u03bd}}, is the number of degrees of arc on a circle.  Each number in the second column, labeled {{lang|grc|\u03b5\u1f50\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u1ff6\u03bd}}, is the length of the corresponding chord of the circle, when the diameter is 120.  Thus \u03c0\u03b4 represents an 84\u00b0 arc, and the \u2220\u2032 after it means one-half, so that \u03c0\u03b4\u2220\u2032 means {{frac|84|1|2}}\u00b0.  In the next column we see \u03c0&nbsp;\u03bc\u03b1&nbsp;\u03b3, meaning 80&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sfrac|41|60}}&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sfrac|3|60<sup>2</sup>}}.  That is the length of the chord corresponding to an arc of {{frac|84|1|2}}\u00b0 when the diameter of the circle is&nbsp;120.  The next column, labeled {{lang|grc|\u1f10\u03be\u03b7\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd}}, for \"sixtieths\", is the number to be added to the chord length for each 1\u00b0 increase in the arc, over the span of the next 12\u00b0.  Thus that last column was used for [[linear interpolation]].\n\nThe Greek sexagesimal placeholder or zero symbol changed over time. The symbol used on [[papyrus|papyri]] during the second century was a very small circle with an overbar several diameters long, terminated or not at both ends in various ways. Later, the overbar shortened to only one diameter, similar to the modern ''o'' macron (\u014d) which was still being used in late medieval Arabic manuscripts whenever alphabetic numerals were used. But the overbar was omitted in [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] manuscripts, leaving a bare ''\u03bf'' (omicron). This gradual change from an invented symbol to ''\u03bf'' does not support the hypothesis that the latter was the initial of \u03bf\u1f50\u03b4\u03ad\u03bd meaning \"nothing\".<ref>{{Cite book | edition = 2 | publisher = [[Dover Publications]] | last = Neugebauer | first = Otto | author-link = Otto E.

In modern [[Greece]], they are still used for [[ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal number]]s and in contexts similar to those in which [[Roman numerals]] are still used elsewhere in the West. For ordinary [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]]s, however, Greece uses [[Arabic numerals]].\n\n==History==\nThe [[Minoans|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean civilization]]s' [[Linear A]] and [[Linear B]] alphabets used a different system, called [[Aegean numerals]], which included specialised symbols for numbers: {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udd07}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udd10}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;10, {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udd19}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;100, {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udd22}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;1000, and {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udd2b}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;10000.<ref name=Verdun>{{cite web|url=http://www.dma.ens.fr/culturemath/histoire%20des%20maths/htm/Verdan/Verdan.htm|title=Syst\u00e8mes num\u00e9raux en Gr\u00e8ce ancienne: description et mise en perspective historique|author=Samuel Verdan|date=20 March 2007 |accessdate=2 March 2011|language=fr}}</ref>\n\n[[Attic numerals]] was another system that came into use perhaps in the 7th century BC. They were [[acrophonic]], derived (after the initial one) from the first letters of the names of the numbers represented. They ran {{GrGl|Zeta archaic}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, {{GrGl|Pi archaic}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;5, {{GrGl|Delta 04}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;10, {{GrGl|Eta classical}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;100, {{GrGl|Chi normal}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,000, and {{GrGl|Mu classical}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;10,000. The numbers {{nowrap|50, 500, 5,000, and 50,000}} were represented by the letter {{GrGl|Pi archaic}} with minuscule powers of ten written in the top right corner: [[File:Attic_00050.svg|x16px]], [[File:Attic_00500.svg|x16px]], [[File:Attic_05000.svg|x16px]], and [[File:Attic_50000.svg|x16px]].<ref name=\"Verdun\" /> One-half was represented by \u2282 (left half of a full circle).

The units from 1 to 9 are assigned to the first nine letters of the old [[Ionic alphabet]] from [[alpha (letter)|alpha]] to [[theta (letter)|theta]]. Instead of reusing these numbers to form multiples of the higher powers of ten, however, each multiple of ten from 10 to 90 was assigned its own separate letter from the next nine letters of the Ionic alphabet from [[iota (letter)|iota]] to [[koppa (letter)|koppa]]. Each multiple of one hundred from 100 to 900 was then assigned its own separate letter as well, from [[rho (letter)|rho]] to [[sampi (letter)|sampi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gwydir.demon.co.uk/jo/numbers/greek/|title=Classical Greek Numbers|last1=Edkins|first1=Jo|year=2006|accessdate=29 April 2013}}</ref> (The fact that this was ''not'' the traditional location of [[sampi (letter)|sampi]] or its possible predecessor [[san (letter)|san]] has led classicists to conclude that it was no longer in use even locally by the time the system was created.)\n\nThis [[alphabetic numeral system|alphabetic system]] operates on the additive principle in which the numeric values of the letters are added together to obtain the total. For example, 241 was represented as {{GrGl|Sigma classical}}{{GrGl|Mu classical}}{{GrGl|Alpha classical}}&nbsp;(200&nbsp;+&nbsp;40&nbsp;+&nbsp;1). (It was not always the case that the numbers ran from highest to lowest: a 4th-century BC inscription at Athens placed the units to the left of the tens. This practice continued in [[Asia Minor]] well into the [[Roman Greece|Roman period]].<ref name=heman/>) In ancient and medieval manuscripts, these numerals were eventually distinguished from letters using [[overbar]]s: {{overline|\u03b1}}, {{overline|\u03b2}}, {{overline|\u03b3}}, etc. In medieval manuscripts of the [[Book of Revelation]], the [[number of the Beast]] 666 is written as {{overline|\u03c7\u03be\u03db}}&nbsp;(600&nbsp;+&nbsp;60&nbsp;+&nbsp;6). (Numbers larger than 1,000 reused the same letters but included various marks to note the change.) Fractions were indicated as the denominator followed by a ''keraia'' (\u02b9);  \u03b3\u02b9 indicated one third, \u03b4\u02b9 one fourth and so on.  As an exception, special symbol \u2220\u02b9 indicated one half, and \u03b3\u00b0\u02b9 or \u03b3o\u02b9 was two-thirds.  These fractions were additive (also known as [[Egyptian fraction]]s); for example {{nowrap|\u03b4\u02b9 \u03db\u02b9}} indicated {{nowrap|{{frac|4}} + {{frac|6}} {{=}} {{frac|5|12}}}}.\n\nAlthough the [[Greek alphabet#Letter shapes|Greek alphabet]] began with only [[majuscule]] forms, surviving [[papyrus]] manuscripts from [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]] show that [[uncial]] and [[cursive]] [[Greek minuscule|minuscule]] forms began early.{{clarification|date=August 2017|reason=When? Minuscule was introduced in Constantinople not earlier than the first half of the 9th century, see Talk Uppercase/Lowercase}} These new letter forms sometimes replaced the former ones, especially in the case of the obscure numerals. The old Q-shaped koppa (\u03d8) began to be broken up ([[File:Greek Koppa cursive 02.svg|x16px]] and [[File:Greek Koppa cursive 03.svg|x16px]]) and simplified ([[File:Greek Koppa cursive 04.svg|x16px]] and [[File:Greek Koppa cursive 05.svg|x16px]]). The numeral for 6 changed several times. During antiquity, the original letter form of digamma (\u03dc) came to be avoided in favour of a special numerical one ({{GrGl|Digamma angular}}). By the [[Byzantine Greek|Byzantine era]], the letter was known as [[Digamma|episemon]] and written as {{GrGl|Digamma cursive 02}} or {{GrGl|Digamma cursive 06}}. This eventually merged with the [[sigma (letter)|sigma]]-[[tau (letter)|tau]] [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] [[stigma (letter)|stigma]] \u03db ({{GrGl|Digamma cursive 07}} or {{GrGl|Digamma cursive 04}}).\n\n{{anchor|keraia}}In [[modern Greek]], a number of other changes have been made. Instead of extending an over bar over an entire number, the '''''keraia'''''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> ({{lang|el|\u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03af\u03b1}}, <small>lit.</small>&nbsp;\"hornlike projection\") is marked to its upper right, a development of the short marks formerly used for single numbers and fractions. The modern ''keraia'' is a symbol ({{keraia}}) similar to the [[acute accent]] (\u00b4), the [[tonos]] (U+0384,\u0384) and the prime symbol (U+02B9, \u02b9), but has its own [[Unicode]] character as U+0374. [[Alexander the Great]]'s father [[Philip II of Macedon]] is thus known as {{lang|el|\u03a6\u03af\u03bb\u03b9\u03c0\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 \u0392\u02b9}} in modern Greek. A lower left ''keraia'' (Unicode: U+0375, \"Greek Lower Numeral Sign\") is now standard for distinguishing thousands: 2019 is represented as \u0375\u0392\u0399\u0398\u02b9 ({{nowrap|2 \u00d7 1,000 + 10 + 9}}).\n\nThe declining use of ligatures in the 20th century also means that stigma is frequently written as the separate letters \u03a3\u03a4\u02b9, although a single ''keraia'' is used for the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/numerals.html|title=Numerals: Stigma, Koppa, Sampi|author=Nick Nicholas|date=9 April 2005|accessdate=2 March

philosopher [[Archimedes]] gives an upper bound of the number of grains of sand required to fill the entire universe, using a contemporary estimation of its size.  This would defy the then-held notion that it is impossible to name a number greater than that of the sand on a beach or on the entire world.  In order to do that, he had to devise a [[The Sand Reckoner#Naming large numbers|new numeral scheme]] with much greater range.\n\n[[Pappus of Alexandria]] reports that [[Apollonius of Perga]] developed a simpler system based on [[Exponentiation|powers]] of the myriad; {{overset|\u03b1|\u039c}} was 10,000, {{overset|\u03b2|\u039c}} was 10,000<sup>2</sup> = 100,000,000, {{overset|\u03b3|\u039c}} was 10,000<sup>3</sup> = 10<sup>12</sup> and so on.<ref name=mactutor/>\n\n==Zero==\n[[File:P. Lund, Inv. 35a.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Example of the early Greek symbol for zero (lower right corner) from a 2nd-century papyrus]]\n{{anchor|Hellenistic zero}}<!--linked from \"Number\"-->\n[[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] [[astronomer]]s extended alphabetic Greek numerals into a [[sexagesimal]] [[positional notation|positional]] [[numeral system|numbering system]] by limiting each position to a maximum value of 50&nbsp;+&nbsp;9 and including a special symbol for [[0 (number)|zero]], which was also used alone like today's modern zero, more than as a simple placeholder. However, the positions were usually limited to the fractional part of a number (called minutes, seconds, thirds, fourths, etc.) \u2014 they were not used for the [[integer|integral]] part of a number. This system was probably adapted from [[Babylonian numerals]] by [[Hipparchus]] {{circa|140 BC}}. It was then used by [[Ptolemy]] ({{circa|140}}), [[Theon of Alexandria|Theon]] ({{circa|380}}) and Theon's daughter [[Hypatia of Alexandria|Hypatia]] (died&nbsp;415).\n\nIn [[Ptolemy's table of chords]], the first fairly extensive trigonometric table, there were 360 rows, portions of which looked as follows:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{array}{ccc} \\pi\\varepsilon\\varrho\\iota\\varphi\\varepsilon\\varrho\\varepsilon\\iota\\tilde\\omega\\nu & \\overset{\\text{'}}\\varepsilon\\nu\\vartheta\\varepsilon\\iota\\tilde\\omega\\nu & \\overset{\\text{`}}\\varepsilon\\xi\\eta\\kappa\\omicron\\sigma\\tau\\tilde\\omega\\nu \\\\\n\\begin{array}{|l|} \\hline \\pi\\delta\\angle' \\\\  \\pi\\varepsilon \\\\  \\pi\\varepsilon\\angle' \\\\  \\hline  \\pi\\stigma \\\\  \\pi\\stigma\\angle' \\\\  \\pi\\zeta \\\\  \\hline \\end{array} & \\begin{array}{|r|r|r|} \\hline \\pi & \\mu\\alpha & \\gamma \\\\  \\pi\\alpha & \\delta & \\iota\\varepsilon \\\\  \\pi\\alpha & \\kappa\\zeta & \\kappa\\beta \\\\  \\hline \\pi\\alpha & \\nu & \\kappa\\delta \\\\  \\pi\\beta & \\iota\\gamma & \\iota\\vartheta \\\\  \\pi\\beta & \\lambda\\stigma & \\vartheta \\\\  \\hline \\end{array} & \\begin{array}{|r|r|r|r|} \\hline \\circ & \\circ & \\mu\\stigma & \\kappa\\varepsilon \\\\  \\circ & \\circ & \\mu\\stigma & \\iota\\delta \\\\  \\circ & \\circ & \\mu\\stigma & \\gamma \\\\  \\hline \\circ & \\circ & \\mu\\varepsilon & \\nu\\beta \\\\  \\circ & \\circ & \\mu\\varepsilon & \\mu \\\\  \\circ & \\circ & \\mu\\varepsilon & \\kappa\\vartheta \\\\  \\hline \\end{array}\n\\end{array}\n</math>\nEach number in the first column, labeled {{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u1ff6\u03bd}}, is the number of degrees of arc on a circle.  Each number in the second column, labeled {{lang|grc|\u03b5\u1f50\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u1ff6\u03bd}}, is the length of the corresponding chord of the circle, when the diameter is 120.  Thus \u03c0\u03b4 represents an 84\u00b0 arc, and the \u2220\u2032 after it means one-half, so that \u03c0\u03b4\u2220\u2032 means {{frac|84|1|2}}\u00b0.  In the next column we see \u03c0&nbsp;\u03bc\u03b1&nbsp;\u03b3, meaning 80&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sfrac|41|60}}&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sfrac|3|60<sup>2</sup>}}.  That is the length of the chord corresponding to an arc of {{frac|84|1|2}}\u00b0 when the diameter of the circle is&nbsp;120.  The next column, labeled {{lang|grc|\u1f10\u03be\u03b7\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd}}, for \"sixtieths\", is the number to be added to the chord length for each 1\u00b0 increase in the arc, over the span of the next 12\u00b0.  Thus that last column was used for [[linear interpolation]].\n\nThe Greek sexagesimal placeholder or zero symbol changed over time. The symbol used on [[papyrus|papyri]] during the second century was a very small circle with an overbar several diameters long, terminated or not at both ends in various ways. Later, the overbar shortened to only one diameter, similar to the modern ''o'' macron (\u014d) which was still being used in late medieval Arabic manuscripts whenever alphabetic numerals were used. But the overbar was omitted in [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] manuscripts, leaving a bare ''\u03bf'' (omicron). This gradual change from an invented symbol to ''\u03bf'' does not support the hypothesis that the latter was the initial of \u03bf\u1f50\u03b4\u03ad\u03bd meaning \"nothing\".<ref>{{Cite book | edition = 2 | publisher = [[Dover Publications]] | last = Neugebauer | first = Otto | author-link = Otto E.

All of these zeros took the form {{nowrap|\u03bf {{!}} \u03bf \u03bf}}, where Ptolemy actually used three of the symbols described in the previous paragraph. The vertical bar (|) indicates that the integral part on the left was in a separate column labeled in the headings of his tables as ''digits'' (of five arc-minutes each), whereas the fractional part was in the next column labeled ''minute of immersion'', meaning sixtieths (and thirty-six-hundredths) of a digit.<ref>''Ptolemy's [[Almagest]]'', translated by [[G.
