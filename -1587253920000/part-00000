During his playing career he made over 500 league appearances and scored over one hundred goals appearing primarily as a [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|deep-lying]] [[Forward (association football)|forward]] but could also play as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]], or as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]]. A talented yet controversial player, Di Canio was known for his creativity, eye for goal, technical ability, and [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] skills, as well as his temperamental character, tenacity and aggression on the pitch.<ref name=\"Di Canio, Paolo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tuttocalciatori.net/Di_Canio_Paolo|title=Di Canio, Paolo|website=tuttocalciatori.net|language=Italian|accessdate=16 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Il Pallone Racconta: Paolo Di Canio\">{{cite web|url=http://ilpalloneracconta.blogspot.ca/2007/07/paolo-di-canio.html|title=Paolo Di Canio|publisher=Il Pallone Racconta|language=Italian|date=10 July 2014|accessdate=16 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Paolo di Canio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.magliarossonera.it/protagonisti/Gioc-Dicanio.html|title=Paolo di Canio|website=magliarossonera.it|language=Italian|accessdate=16 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=tuttojuve.com>{{cite web|url=http://www.tuttojuve.com/gli-eroi-bianconeri/gli-eroi-in-bianconero-paolo-di-canio-196426|title=Gli eroi in bianconero: Paolo DI CANIO|publisher=Tutto Juve|language=Italian|author1=Stefano Bedeschi|date=10 July 2014|accessdate=1 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/731574-epl-ranking-60-of-the-best-overseas-players-in-english-premier-league-history#slide15 |title=English Premier League: Ranking 60 of the Best Overseas Players in EPL History |publisher=Bleacher Report |last1=Thorpe |first1=Lee |date=14 June 2011 |accessdate=26 October 2019 }}</ref>\n\nDi Canio began his career in the Italian [[Serie A]], playing for [[S.S.

He subsequently spent seven years in the English [[Premier League]] with [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]. He returned to Italy in 2004, playing for Lazio and [[Atletico Roma F.C.|Cisco Roma]] before retiring in 2008. He played for the [[Italy national under-21 football team|Italian under-21s]], making 9 appearances and scoring 2 goals, and was notably a member of the squad that finished in third place at the [[1990 UEFA European Under-21 Championship]] under manager [[Cesare Maldini]], but was never capped for the [[Italy national football team|senior team]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.figc.it/nazionali/DettaglioConvocato?codiceConvocato=401&squadra=1|title=Nazionale in Cifre: Convocazioni e presenze in campo - Di Canio, Paolo|website=figc.it|publisher=FIGC|language=Italian|accessdate=16 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nAmong the individual awards he received as a player, Di Canio was named [[SPFA Players' Player of the Year]] in 1997 and West Ham's [[West Ham United F.C.#Hammer of the Year|player of the season]] in 2000. However, his career was at times characterised by controversy: he received an eleven-match ban in 1998 for pushing a referee and attracted negative publicity over his self allegiance to [[Italian fascism|fascism]].\n\nIn 2011, Di Canio entered football management in England with [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]], guiding them in his first full season as manager to promotion to [[Football League One|League One]].

Roma]] fans. However, Di Canio was drawn to their local rivals [[S.S. Lazio]]. As a young boy, he was addicted to cola and similar drinks and called ''Pallocca'', a slang term meaning ''lard-ball''.

After the Ottomans were defeated in [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918), [[France]] took control of Lebanon until 1943, when the country achieved its independence. The [[France|French]] introduced foods such as [[Flan (pie)|flan]], a [[caramel custard]] dessert dating back to the 16th century AD, [[eclairs]], [[french fries]] and [[croissant]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YEcLaAEACAAJ|title=The Culinary Heritage of Lebanon|last=Choueiri|first=Ramzi N.|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Ramzi Choueiri|isbn=978-9953-0-0753-3|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Lebanese diaspora]] who live worldwide have introduced new foods, spices and culinary practices into Lebanese cuisine, keeping the cuisine innovative and renowned both beyond and within its borders.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hannam|first=Kevin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHTDCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA136|title=Event Mobilities: Politics, place and performance|last2=Mostafanezhad|first2=Mary|last3=Rickly|first3=Jillian|date=2016-03-17|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-45047-4|page=136}}</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Byblos- Jbeil.jpg|alt=|thumb|A restaurant in the historic quarter and souks of [[Byblos]] (also called Jbeil)]]\nMost often foods are grilled, baked or saut\u00e9ed in olive oil; butter or cream is rarely used other than in a few desserts. Vegetables are often eaten raw, pickled, or cooked. Like most Mediterranean countries, much of what the Lebanese eat is dictated by the seasons and what is available. Lebanese cuisine also varies by region. South Lebanon is famous for its Kibbe, the [[Beqaa Valley]] for its meat pastries (such as [[sfiha]]), and north Lebanon and Saida ([[Sidon]]) for its sweets. \n\nIn [[Lebanon]], very rarely are drinks served without being accompanied by food.

Many dishes in Lebanese cuisine can be traced back thousands of years to eras of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Ancient Egypt]]ian, [[Phoenicia under Babylonian rule|Babylonian]], [[Phoenicia under Assyrian rule|Assyrian]], [[Hittites|Hittite]] and [[Phoenicia]]n rule.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mDnQwCJXUowC|title=Lebanon a country study|date=1989|language=en}}</ref> More recently, Lebanese cuisine was influenced by the different foreign civilizations that held power. From 1516 to 1918, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] controlled Lebanon and introduced a variety of foods that have become staples in the Lebanese diet, such as cooking with [[lamb and mutton|lamb]]. After the Ottomans were defeated in [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918), [[France]] took control of Lebanon until 1943, when the country achieved its independence. The [[France|French]] introduced foods such as [[Flan (pie)|flan]], a [[caramel custard]] dessert dating back to the 16th century AD, [[eclairs]], [[french fries]] and [[croissant]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YEcLaAEACAAJ|title=The Culinary Heritage of Lebanon|last=Choueiri|first=Ramzi N.|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Ramzi Choueiri|isbn=978-9953-0-0753-3|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Lebanese diaspora]] who live worldwide have introduced new foods, spices and culinary practices into Lebanese cuisine, keeping the cuisine innovative and renowned both beyond and within its borders.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hannam|first=Kevin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHTDCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA136|title=Event Mobilities: Politics, place and performance|last2=Mostafanezhad|first2=Mary|last3=Rickly|first3=Jillian|date=2016-03-17|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-45047-4|page=136}}</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Byblos- Jbeil.jpg|alt=|thumb|A resturant in the historic quarter and souks of [[Byblos]] (also called Jbeil)]]\nMost often foods are grilled, baked or saut\u00e9ed in olive oil; butter or cream is rarely used other than in a few desserts. Vegetables are often eaten raw, pickled, or cooked. Like most Mediterranean countries, much of what the Lebanese eat is dictated by the seasons and what is available. Lebanese cuisine also varies by region. South Lebanon is famous for its Kibbe, the [[Beqaa Valley]] for its meat pastries (such as [[sfiha]]), and north Lebanon and Saida ([[Sidon]]) for its sweets. \n\nIn [[Lebanon]], very rarely are drinks served without being accompanied by food. Similar to the [[tapas]] of [[Spain]], ''mezeluri'' of [[Romania]] and aperitivo of [[Italy]], ''[[mezze]]'' is an array of small dishes placed before the guests creating an array of colors, flavors, textures and aromas.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Walker|first=Harlan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GsNyprRS7EIC&pg=PA268|title=The Meal: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery, 2001|date=2002|publisher=Oxford Symposium|isbn=978-1-903018-24-8|page=268}}</ref><ref name=\"Cavendish\">{{Cite book|last=Cavendish|first=Marshall|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j894miuOqc4C&pg=PA979|title=World and Its Peoples|date=September 2006|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7571-2|page=979}}</ref> This style of serving food is less a part of family life than it is of entertaining and caf\u00e9s.

The assortments of dishes forming the mezze are generally consumed in small bites using a piece of Lebanese bread ([[khubz]], [[pita]]) or a fork.<ref name=\"Cavendish\" /> As a family, it is made up of three or four dishes, but in the restaurant, the mezze can range from twenty to sixty dishes, as the variant combinations and dishes involved are plenty.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jousiffe|first=Ann|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q7IUAQAAIAAJ|title=Lebanon|date=1998|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-0-86442-350-4|language=en}}</ref>  \n\nA typical ''[[mezze]]'' will consist of an elaborate variety of thirty hot and cold dishes and may include: \n\n* Salads such as [[tabbouleh]] and [[fattoush]], together with dip such as [[hummus]], [[baba ghanoush]] or ''moutabal'', and [[kebbeh]],\n* Some patties such as the [[sambusac]],\n*[[Stuffed grape leaves]] and pickles,\n* Roasted nuts, olives and vegetables,\n* Condiments like [[toum]] and [[Tarator|taratour]], ideal for spread on [[sfiha]].<ref name=\"Cavendish\"/><ref>{{Cite book|last=Rombauer|first=Irma S.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jcq2DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46|title=Joy of Cooking: 2019 Edition Fully Revised and Updated|last2=Becker|first2=Marion Rombauer|last3=Becker|first3=Ethan|last4=Becker|first4=John|last5=Scott|first5=Megan|date=2019-11-12|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-5011-6971-7|page=46}}</ref>\n\nFamily cuisine offers also a range of dishes, such as stews (or yakhneh), which can be cooked in many forms depending on the ingredients used and are usually served with [[meat]] and rice vermicelli.
