GGC supplementation would circumvent feedback inhibitory control of GCL by the end product GSH.  Accordingly, a method of elevating GSH levels with the notable advantage of bypassing negative feedback inhibition has been described.

She tells him Arnold's last instructions were to destroy the park, but she never did this. Dr. Ford leaves, but an unseen figure arrives, to which Dolores reports that she has not revealed anything. Elsie finds a satellite transmitter in the rogue host's body and suggests to Bernard someone is trying to smuggle data out of Westworld.\n\nThe Man in Black continues to search for Wyatt with Lawrence and Teddy. Teddy's wounds are severe, and the Man kills Lawrence to transfuse his blood for Teddy. The two continue and find a tavern where Dr. Ford waits for the Man. Ford asks the Man why he is seeking the maze, to which he responds that he is seeking \"something true\" believing Arnold had one more story to tell.\n\nLogan, William, and Dolores travel with Slim to the town of Pariah. Logan tells William that the park is in financial trouble after one of its original founders mysteriously died. At Pariah, they meet El Lazo, Slim's boss with close ties to the Confederados, ex-Confederate soldiers turned outlaws.\n\nEl Lazo offers to recruit Logan and William into the Confederados if they help steal an army wagon of [[nitroglycerin]] for them. While William seeks a peaceful route, Logan takes the wagon with force, and on their return, they bicker over their methods, but Logan reminds him that William would not be an executive vice president at Delos, Inc. without his help. Dolores has more visions of a church and a maze and wanders Pariah. She wakes to see El Lazo replacing the nitroglycerin with tequila. She tries to warn William but he is apathetic from his argument with Logan. She snaps him out of his with a beg and pleads for his help to escape the park. The two flee without warning Logan, and when the Confederados discover the deception, he is captured. William and Dolores board a train, but spot El Lazo aboard, traveling with several coffins branded with a maze symbol, with bodies embalmed with the nitroglycerin. El Lazo surrenders to them and asks them to call him Lawrence.\n\nMaeve and the other hosts from the saloon shootout are brought to operations. As technican Felix passes her body, she grabs his arm and tells him they need to talk.\n\n==Production==\nThe teleplay for \"Contrapasso\" was written by series co-creator [[Lisa Joy]], from a story by [[Dominic Mitchell]] and Joy.<ref name=\":05\">{{cite web|title=Westworld 05: Contrapasso|url=https://www.hbo.com/westworld/season-01/5-contrapasso/synopsis|publisher=[[HBO]]|accessdate=May 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\nThe episode was directed by [[Jonny Campbell]].<ref name=\":05\"/> Production designer Zack Grobler drew inspiration from various cultures like [[Latin America]] and [[Africa]] to create the town of Pariah.<ref name=\"pariah production\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/westworld-orgy-scene-explained-942103|title=Inside 'Westworld's' \"Epic\" Orgy Scene|first=Josh|last=Wigler|date=October 30, 2016|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=October 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n[[File:Ramin Djawadi.jpg|right|thumb|upright|alt=Ramin Djawadi|Composer [[Ramin Djawadi]] created the episode's musical score.]]\nIn an interview, composer [[Ramin Djawadi]] spoke about the song \"[[Something I Can Never Have]]\" by [[Nine Inch Nails]], that was translated in the episode.

She tells him Arnold's last instructions were to destroy the park, but she never did this. Dr. Ford leaves, but an unseen figure arrives, to which Dolores reports that she has not revealed anything. Elsie finds a satellite transmitter in the rogue host's body and suggests to Bernard someone is trying to smuggle data out of Westworld.\n\nThe Man in Black continues to search for Wyatt with Lawrence and Teddy. Teddy's wounds are severe, and the Man kills Lawrence to transfuse his blood for Teddy. The two continue and find a tavern where Dr. Ford waits for the Man. Ford asks the Man why he is seeking the maze, to which he responds that he is seeking \"something true\" believing Arnold had one more story to tell.\n\nLogan, William, and Dolores travel with Slim to the town of Pariah. Logan tells William that the park is in financial trouble after one of it's original founders mysteriously died. At Pariah, they meet El Lazo, Slim's boss with close ties to the Confederados, ex-Confederate soldiers turned outlaws.\n\nEl Lazo offers to recruit Logan and William into the Confederados if they help steal an army wagon of [[nitroglycerin]] for them. While William seeks a peaceful route, Logan takes the wagon with force, and on their return, they bicker over their methods, but Logan reminds him that William would not be an executive vice president at Delos, Inc. without his help. Dolores has more visions of a church and a maze and wanders Pariah. She wakes to see El Lazo replacing the nitroglycerin with tequila. She tries to warn William but he is apathetic from his argument with Logan. She snaps him out of his with a beg and pleads for his help to escape the park. The two flee without warning Logan, and when the Confederados discover the deception, he is captured. William and Dolores board a train, but spot El Lazo aboard, traveling with several coffins branded with a maze symbol, with bodies embalmed with the nitroglycerin. El Lazo surrenders to them and asks them to call him Lawrence.\n\nMaeve and the other hosts from the saloon shootout are brought to operations. As technican Felix passes her body, she grabs his arm and tells him they need to talk.\n\n==Production==\nThe teleplay for \"Contrapasso\" was written by series co-creator [[Lisa Joy]], from a story by [[Dominic Mitchell]] and Joy.<ref name=\":05\">{{cite web|title=Westworld 05: Contrapasso|url=https://www.hbo.com/westworld/season-01/5-contrapasso/synopsis|publisher=[[HBO]]|accessdate=May 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\nThe episode was directed by [[Jonny Campbell]].<ref name=\":05\"/> Production designer Zack Grobler drew inspiration from various cultures like [[Latin America]] and [[Africa]] to create the town of Pariah.<ref name=\"pariah production\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/westworld-orgy-scene-explained-942103|title=Inside 'Westworld's' \"Epic\" Orgy Scene|first=Josh|last=Wigler|date=October 30, 2016|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=October 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n[[File:Ramin Djawadi.jpg|right|thumb|upright|alt=Ramin Djawadi|Composer [[Ramin Djawadi]] created the episode's musical score.]]\nIn an interview, composer [[Ramin Djawadi]] spoke about the song \"[[Something I Can Never Have]]\" by [[Nine Inch Nails]], that was translated in the episode.

Cruises offered from that time circumnavigations Australia, circumnavigations [[New Zealand]], and visits to [[New Caledonia]] and [[Vanuatu]]. In 2012, she offered her first world cruise.\n\nIn April 2008, ''Sun Princess'' was based in Australia, operating out of Sydney during the winter months, and from Melbourne during the summer months. For the 2008/2009 season the cruise program included Australian circumnavigations, [[Fremantle]] - [[Malacca Straits]] return, [[Melbourne]] -  New Zealand / South Pacific. ''Sun Princess'' also sailed from Sydney for Melbourne plus [[Whitsunday Islands|Whitsundays]] return, a [[Japan]] return itinerary, and a 75 night Grand Pacific trip.\n\nDuring summer 2008/2009 whilst ''Sun Princess'' was operating out of Melbourne, she was joined by ''Dawn Princess'' operating out of Sydney. ''Dawn Princess'' was also permanently based in Australia from that time which was a change from Princess Cruises' original plans.\n\nDemand for ''Sun Princess'' cruises between Sydney and Fremantle and beyond from April to June 2008 was so strong that Princess Cruises scheduled additional sailings for 2009.  The company also decided to base the vessel in Fremantle from April to August that year.
