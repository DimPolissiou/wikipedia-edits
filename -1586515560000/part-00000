While this group now has a mostly tropical distribution, they originated in the Arctic in the late Eocene c. 35&nbsp;Mya from where they diversified across Laurasia and farther south across the Equator.<ref>{{Harvnb|McCullough|Moyle|Smith|Andersen|2019|loc=Conclusion, p. 7}}</ref>\n\n===Final split===\n{{Multiple image | total_width = 600 | align = right | perrow = 3\n | image1 = Opening of North Atlantic 090Ma.jpg\n | image2 = Opening of North Atlantic 050Ma.jpg\n | image3 = Opening of North Atlantic 030Ma.jpg\n | footer = Opening of the North Atlantic Ocean 90, 50, and 30 Mya.\n}}\nIn the Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic (c. 200&nbsp;Mya), the opening of the Central [[Atlantic Ocean]] was preceded by the formation of a series of large rift basins, such as the [[Newark Basin]], between eastern North America, from what is today the Gulf of Mexico to Nova Scotia, and in Africa and Europe, from Morocco to Greenland.<ref>{{Harvnb|Olsen|1997|loc=Introduction, p. 338}}</ref>\n\nBy {{circa|83&nbsp;Mya}} spreading had begun in the North Atlantic between the [[Rockall Plateau]], a continental fragment sitting on top of the Eurasian Plate, and North America.

The fossil record, however, suggests the intermittent presence of a Trans-Tethys land bridge, though the location and duration of such a land bridge remains enigmatic.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gheerbrant|Rage|2006|loc=Introduction, p. 225}}</ref>\n\n[[Pinaceae|Pine trees]] evolved in the early Mesozoic c. 250&nbsp;Mya and the [[List of Pinus species|pine genus]] originated in Laurasia in the Early Cretaceous c. 130&nbsp;Mya in competition with faster growing [[angiosperm|flowering plants]].  Pines adapted to cold and arid climates in environments were the growing season was shorter or wildfire common; this evolution limited pine range to between 31\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 north and resulted in a split into two subgenera: ''Strobus'' adapted to stressful environments and ''Pinus'' to fire-prone landscapes.  By the end of the Cretaceous pines were established across Laurasia, from North America to East Asia.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keeley|2012|loc=Introduction, pp. 445\u2013446; Mesozoic origin and diversification, pp. 450\u2013451}}</ref>\n\nFrom the Triassic to the Early Jurassic, before the break-up of Pangaea, [[archosaur]]s (crocodiles and dinosaurs including birds) had a global distribution.  This cosmopolitanism ended as Gondwana fragmented and Laurasia was assembled.  [[Pterosaur]] diversity reach a maximum in the Late Jurassic\u2014Early Cretaceous and plate tectonic didn't affect the distribution of these flying reptiles.  Crocodiles also diversified during the Early Cretaceous but were divided into Laurasian and Gondwanan populations; modern crocodiles evolved from the former.  The distribution of the three major groups of [[dinosaur]]s&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Theropoda|theropods]], [[Sauropoda|sauropods]], and [[Ornithischia|ornithischians]]&nbsp;\u2013 was similar that of the crocodiles.  East Asia remained isolated with endemic species including [[Psittacosaurus|psittacosaurs]] (horned dinosaurs) and [[Ankylosauridae]] (club-tailed, armoured dinosaurs).<ref> {{Harvnb|Milner|Milner|Evans|2000|p=319}}</ref>\n\nIn the early Eocene a peak in global warming led to a pan-Arctic fauna with alligators and amphibians present north of the Arctic Circle.  In the early Palaeogene, landbridges still connected continents, allowing land animals to migrate between them.  On the other hand, submerged areas occasionally divided continents: the [[Turgai Sea]] separated Europe and Asia from the Middle Jurassic to the Oligocene and as this sea or strait dried out, a massive faunal interchange took place and the resulting extinction event in Europe is known as the ''[[Grande Coupure]]''.<ref> {{Harvnb|Milner|Milner|Evans|2000|p=328}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Coraciiformes]] (an order of birds including kingfishers) evolved in Laurasia. While this group now has a mostly tropical distribution, they originated in the Arctic in the late Eocene c. 35&nbsp;Mya from where they diversified across Laurasia and farther south across the Equator.<ref>{{Harvnb|McCullough|Moyle|Smith|Andersen|2019|loc=Conclusion, p. 7}}</ref>\n\n===Final split===\n{{Multiple image | total_width = 600 | align = right | perrow = 3\n | image1 = Opening of North Atlantic 090Ma.jpg\n | image2 = Opening of North Atlantic 050Ma.jpg\n | image3 = Opening of North Atlantic 030Ma.jpg\n | footer = Opening of the North Atlantic Ocean 90, 50, and 30 Mya.\n}}\nIn the Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic (c. 200&nbsp;Mya), the opening of the Central [[Atlantic Ocean]] was preceded by the formation of a series of large rift basins, such as the [[Newark Basin]], between eastern North America, from what is today the Gulf of Mexico to Nova Scotia, and in Africa and Europe, from Morocco to Greenland.<ref>{{Harvnb|Olsen|1997|loc=Introduction, p. 338}}</ref>\n\nBy {{circa|83&nbsp;Mya}} spreading had begun in the North Atlantic between the [[Rockall Plateau]], a continental fragment sitting on top of the Eurasian Plate, and North America.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921. In 1922 he made an effort to establish Rugby League in the Tauranga area which failed however he did play matches for Tauranga and a Bay of Plenty league team who played against Auckland.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League Days===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move. Newton went on to win the Roope Rooster for the first time in their clubs history<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Roope Rooster Competition/Final Won by Newton/Game Played in Downpour\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>. \n\nIles was picked to play for Auckland against New Zealand on May 24. It was the first of 3 games he would play for them this season. The match was a warmup for the Australian Tour for the New Zealand side and was won by New Zealand 25-19 in front of 8,000 spectators at the [[Auckland Domain]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title =New Zealand Beats Auckland/Keenly Contested Game\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17170\n| date = 1919-05-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190526.2.105.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches. The Returned Soldiers team won 26-24 with Iles scoring two second half tries for the losing Auckland team<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Northern Union Grade\n| page =9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 172\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190722.2.130\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His last ever match in an Auckland jersey was played against [[Rugby League Hawkes Bay|Hawke\u2019s Bay]] at [[Eden Park]] on August 9 with 9,000 watching on. Iles scored two more tries. The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. After this tour they returned home and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]] sent a touring team to New Zealand<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kangaroos Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/kangaroos-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had played in a trial on May 14 to make the tour but was not selected.\n\nOn August 23 he played his first test for New Zealand at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]] and went down 21-44 in front of 8,000 spectators<ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Australia V New Zealand\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 282\n| date = 1919-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190825.2.88\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand. They would go on to win 26-10 in front of 6,000<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game/Australia v New Zealand/Visitors Outclassed\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 288\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190901.2.78\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In a bizarre situation Iles played for Auckland against his own Bay of Plenty union in a match on 31 July when an Auckland back was unable to make the trip to Tauranga and Iles was asked to take his place. Bay of Plenty won 17-10 but Iles played brilliantly and comment was made that he shouldn't have been left out of the Bay team in the first place\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Bay of Plenty Footballers Defeat Auckland Representatives\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7464, 2 August 1920, Page 3\n| date = 1920-08-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200802.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Effort to Introduce Rugby League to Tauranga===\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921. In 1922 he made an effort to establish Rugby League in the Tauranga area which failed however he did play matches for Tauranga and a Bay of Plenty league team who played against Auckland.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League Days===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move. Newton went on to win the Roope Rooster for the first time in their clubs history<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Roope Rooster Competition/Final Won by Newton/Game Played in Downpour\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>. \n\nIles was picked to play for Auckland against New Zealand on May 24. It was the first of 3 games he would play for them this season. The match was a warmup for the Australian Tour for the New Zealand side and was won by New Zealand 25-19 in front of 8,000 spectators at the [[Auckland Domain]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title =New Zealand Beats Auckland/Keenly Contested Game\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17170\n| date = 1919-05-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190526.2.105.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches. The Returned Soldiers team won 26-24 with Iles scoring two second half tries for the losing Auckland team<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Northern Union Grade\n| page =9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 172\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190722.2.130\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His last ever match in an Auckland jersey was played against [[Rugby League Hawkes Bay|Hawke\u2019s Bay]] at [[Eden Park]] on August 9 with 9,000 watching on. Iles scored two more tries. The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. After this tour they returned home and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]] sent a touring team to New Zealand<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kangaroos Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/kangaroos-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had played in a trial on May 14 to make the tour but was not selected.\n\nOn August 23 he played his first test for New Zealand at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]] and went down 21-44 in front of 8,000 spectators<ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Australia V New Zealand\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 282\n| date = 1919-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190825.2.88\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand. They would go on to win 26-10 in front of 6,000<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game/Australia v New Zealand/Visitors Outclassed\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 288\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190901.2.78\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In September of 1920 Iles made a return to [[Eden Park]], this time in a Bay of Plenty rugby jersey where they were defeated 17-34 to Auckland. Iles set up Bay of Plenty\u2019s first try and then scored two himself<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Auckland V Bay of Plenty/The Visitors Defeated\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVII, Issue 17580\n| date = 1920-09-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19200920.2.106\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIsles was playing for the Tauranga Football Club in the Jordan Cup competition for clubs and he also regularly appeared for the Tauranga representative team in Kusab Cup fixtures. During the Kusab Cup he played in matches against Mercury Bay<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Match at Tauranga\n| page = 9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVIII, Issue 17836\n| date = 1921-07-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210718.2.110.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>, Te Puke<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Kusabs' Cup Match Next Saturday\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7710\n| date = 1921-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210602.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>, [[Whakatane]] in the semi final, and Rotorua in the final. Tauranga won the Cup when they defeated Rotorua 16-9 at Arawa Park, [[Rotorua]] after several years of trying with Iles captaining the team\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Tauranga Wins Kusabs' Cup Final/Rotorua Beaten by Sixteen Points to Nine\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7742\n| date = 1921-07-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210711.2.4\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.\n\nHowever Iles greatest achievement of the year was on the 16th of August when he was selected to play for Bay of Plenty against the touring Springbok team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7773\n| date = 1921-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210816.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Effort to Introduce Rugby League to Tauranga===\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. They made efforts to organise a game with the newly formed Rotorua league team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8079\n| date = 1922-09-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220902.2.4\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He was still playing rugby union through this period and played for Tauranga in a drawn match with Rangataua in June\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rugby Union's Cup Matches Continued/Tauranga and Rangataua Play a Draw\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8007\n| date = 1922-06-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220612.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. On August 28 he wrote another letter suggesting a match between those players who had been selected for the Tauranga rugby union team and those who had not as there had evidently been some controversy over selections<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Challenge\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8075\n| date = 1922-08-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220829.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nOn September 30 Tauranga made history of sorts by playing in the first ever rugby league game in Te Puke<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.3\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>.

The ''Ramayana'' describes Mandodari as beautiful, pious, and righteous. She is extolled as one of the ''[[Panchakanya]]'' (\"Five Girls\"), the recital of whose names is believed to dispel sin.\n\nMandodari was the daughter of [[Mayasura]], the King of the [[Asura]]s (demons), and the ''[[apsara]]'' (celestial nymphs) Hema. Mandodari bears two sons: ''Meghanada'' ([[Indrajit]]) and [[Akshayakumara]]. According to some Ramayana adaptations, Mandodari is also the mother of [[Rama]]'s wife [[Sita]],  who is infamously kidnapped by Ravana. Despite her husband's faults, Mandodari loves him and advises him to follow the path of righteousness. Mandodari repeatedly advises Ravana to return Sita to Rama, but her advice falls on deaf ears. Her love and loyalty to Ravana are praised in the ''Ramayana''.\n\nDifferent versions of the ''Ramayana'' record her ill-treatment at the hands of Rama's monkey generals. Some versions say they disturb a sacrifice by Ravana, and some that they destroy her chastity, which was the last protection for Ravana's life. [[Hanuman]] tricks her into disclosing the location of a magical arrow which Rama uses to kill Ravana.\n\n==Birth==\nThe ''Uttara Ramayana'' narrates a story about the birth of Mandodari. [[Mayasura]] (Maya), the son of sage [[Kashyapa]] is married to the ''[[apsara]]'' (heavenly nymph) Hema. They have two sons, Mayavi and Dundubhi, but long for a daughter, so they start performing penances to seek the favour of the god [[Shiva]].<ref name = \"Mani476\"/>\n\n==Marriage and later life==\n[[File:Mandodaree Repressing the Wrath Of Ravana.jpg|thumb|Mandodaree Repressing the Wrath Of Ravana]]\nRavana comes to the house of Mayasura and falls in love with Mandodari.

Mandodari bears Ravana three sons: [[Meghanada]], [[Atikaya]] and [[Akshayakumara]].<ref name = \"Mani476\"/> [[Mandore]], a town located 9 km north of [[Jodhpur]], is believed to be the native place of Mandodari.

She is aware of Ravana's weakness towards women.{{sfn|Mukherjee|1999|p=39}}{{sfn|Ayyer|2006|pp=50-51}} A righteous woman, Mandodari tries to lead Ravana to righteousness, but Ravana always ignores her advice. She advises him to not to subdue the ''[[Navagraha]]'', the nine celestial beings that govern one's destiny, and not to seduce [[Vedavati]], who would be reborn as Sita and cause the destruction of Ravana.{{sfn|Ayyer|2006|pp=50-51}}\n\nRavana kidnaps [[Sita]], the wife of [[Rama]], the exiled prince of [[Ayodhya]], who is an incarnation of the god [[Vishnu]]. Mandodari advises Ravana to return Sita to Rama, but to no avail. Mandodari knows this lust will bring the downfall of Ravana.{{sfn|Mukherjee|1999|p=39}}{{sfn|Ayyer|2006|pp=50-51}}\nMandodari is described as a beautiful woman in Valmiki's Ramayana. When [[Hanuman]], the monkey messenger of Rama, comes to Lanka in search of Sita, he is stupefied by Mandodari's beauty when he enters Ravana's bed chambers and mistakes Mandodari for Sita.<ref name = \"Mani476\">Mani p. 476</ref> When Hanuman finally finds Sita, he finds Ravana threatening to kill Sita unless she marries him. Ravana raises his sword to behead Sita when she refuses. Mandodari saves Sita by holding Ravana's hand. Mandodari says that the murder of a woman is a heinous sin and thus Ravana should not kill Sita. She asks Ravana to entertain himself with his other wives and give up the idea of having Sita as his wife. Ravana spares Sita's life, but does not give up his wish to marry Sita.{{sfn|Wheeler|1869|p=338}} Though Mandodari considers Sita inferior to her in beauty and ancestry, Mandodari acknowledges Sita's devotion to Rama and compares her to goddesses like [[Sachi]] and [[Rohini (nakshatra)|Rohini]].{{sfn|Mukherjee|1999|p=39}}\n\nWhen all attempts for a peaceful return of Sita fail, Rama declares war on Ravana's Lanka. Before the final battle against Rama, Mandodari makes a last attempt to dissuade Ravana, but to no avail.{{sfn|Wheeler|1869|p=365}} Finally, Mandodari stands by her husband in the final battle like an obedient and faithful wife,{{sfn|Mukherjee|1999|p=39}} though she advises her son Meghanada, alias Indrajit (\"One who had conquered [[Indra]]; the god-king of heaven\"), not to fight Rama.{{sfn|Wheeler|1869|p=370}}\n\nSeveral manuscripts of the ''Ramayana'' mention a story in which Angada drags Mandodari by her hair in presence of Ravana as a punishment for Ravana's treatment of Sita. Satyatirtha, a commentator on ''Ramayana'', dismisses this story as spurious.{{sfn|Goldman et al.|2009|p=1320}} According to this story: When all of Ravana's sons and warriors die, Ravana organizes a ''[[yajna]]'' (\"fire sacrifice\") to assure his victory.

Mandodari bears two sons: ''Meghanada'' ([[Indrajit]]) and [[Akshayakumara]]. According to some Ramayana adaptations, Mandodari is also the mother of [[Rama]]'s wife [[Sita]],  who is infamously kidnapped by Ravana. Despite her husband's faults, Mandodari loves him and advises him to follow the path of righteousness. Mandodari repeatedly advises Ravana to return Sita to Rama, but her advice falls on deaf ears.

[[Mayasura]] (Maya), the son of sage [[Kashyapa]] is married to the ''[[apsara]]'' (heavenly nymph) Hema. They have two sons, Mayavi and Dundubhi, but long for a daughter, so they start performing penances to seek the favour of the god [[Shiva]].<ref name = \"Mani476\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, an apsara named Madh arrives at [[Mount Kailash]], the abode of Shiva, to pay her respects. In absence of his wife [[Parvati]], Madhura has clandestine coitus with Shiva . When Parvati returns, she finds traces of ashes from Shiva\u2019s body on the breasts of Madhura. Agitated, Parvati curses Madhura and sends her to live in a well as a frog for twelve years. Shiva consoles Madhura and says she will become a beautiful woman and be married to a great valorous man. After twelve years, Madhura becomes a beautiful maiden again and cries out loudly from the well. Mayasura and Hema, who are performing penance nearby, answer her call and adopt her as their daughter. They bring her up as Mandodari and Dhanyamalini is also born to them.<ref name = \"Mani476\"/>\n\n==Marriage and later life==\n[[File:Mandodaree Repressing the Wrath Of Ravana.jpg|thumb|Mandodaree Repressing the Wrath Of Ravana]]\nRavana comes to the house of Mayasura and falls in love with Mandodari.

Mandodari defies the stereotype of this racism. She is simple, unswerving, and self-effacing, driven by the light of knowledge which gives meaning to solid materialism in an age that is shrouded by impulse, passion, and desire. She is the instrument that awakens the mind and counsels reason when irrationality becomes the core being. That she goes unheard and unheeded does not change her path. To her, the [[dharmic]] part is inward-looking, while the role of the dutiful wife is the external self. Mandodari thought that her duty to her husband on issues of morals and values ended with her telling him what she thought of his actions. She neither put up any brave fight to stop him nor considered it her duty to do so.\n</blockquote>\n\nMandodari's role is short in the Ramayana but very important. She is described as a pious and righteous royal lady.{{sfn|Mukherjee|1999|p=39}}{{sfn|Ayyer|2006|pp=50-51}} Compared to the rest of the ''panchakanya'', Mukherjee considers Mandodari's life as \"less colourful and eventful\". He adds: \"Mandodari seldom got prominence ... Her image lacks substance and fades quickly\",{{sfn|Mukherjee|1999|p=39}} though he lays stress on her love and loyalty towards her husband.{{sfn|Mukherjee|1999|pp=48-49}} Pradip Bhattacharya, author of the book ''Panchkanya: Women of Substance'' notes that \"there is hardly anything special that Valmiki (Ramayana) has written about her (Mandodari) except that she warns her husband to return Sita and has enough influence to prevent him from raping her.\"<ref name=\"Bhattacharya\"/>\n\n==In other cultures==\nMandodari's name is used for one of the letters of the [[Thai alphabet]], ''tho montho'' (\u0e11 \u0e21\u0e13\u0e42\u0e11).\n\n==References==\n; Notes\n{{Reflist}}\n\n; Bibliography\n{{ref begin}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Ayyer|first=Dhanalakshmi |title=Women of substance: Mandodari : Pure as water|journal=[[The Week (Indian magazine)|The Week]]|year=2006|volume = 24|issue = 48|pages = 50\u20131 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |editor1=Robert P.
