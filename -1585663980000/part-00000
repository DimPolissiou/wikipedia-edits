Based on ''The Little Broomstick'' by [[Mary Stewart (novelist)|Mary Stewart]], this is Studio Ponoc's first feature film.<ref name=\"ponoc features\" />\n\nThe film tells a story of a girl named Mary Smith who finds \"fly-by-night\", a mysterious flower that can give her the power to become a witch for only one night.<ref name=\"polygon 20161216\" /><ref name=\"youtube trailer 2016\" /> The film was released in Japan on 8 July 2017.<ref name=\"imdb title\" /> In the English-language version of the film, which was concurrently released with a subtitled version in the United States on 19 January 2018, the film features the voices of [[Ruby Barnhill]], [[Kate Winslet]], and [[Jim Broadbent]].\n\n==Production==\nOn 15 December 2016 Yonebayashi and Nishimura  held a press conference. Here Yonebayashi, who had previously worked with Ghibli on \"[[When Marnie Was There]]\" and ''[[Arrietty]]'', said \"This is the first movie since leaving Studio Ghibli. At Studio Ponoc, we are working diligently with Yoshiaki Nishimura, a producer, and excellent staff.\"<ref name=\"natalie 213392\" />\n\nWhen Nishimura was asked about the establishment of the new studio he said, \"When the Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki notified me about the dissolution of the Ghibli Production Department , I was stimulated by the oversea creators when I went to the Academy Awards venue with \"[[The Tale of the Princess Kaguya|The Tale of Princess Kaguya]]\" Remember that you received it.\" After announcing it was based on The Little Broomstick, Nisimura said \"''[[When Marnie Was There|Marnie of Memories]]'' is a work that proved that Yonebayashi, who excels at dynamic painting, sealed his specialty and can draw trivial emotions. But as a producer, I want to see dynamic animation, so I decided to do a fantasy with a cheerful girl moving around.\" When asked if he consulted with Takahata or Miyasaki, he said he did not show Miyazaki any storyboards but he did talk to him. They both said the same thing, \"be prepared\".<ref name=\"natalie 213392\" /> Yonebayashi announced the voice actors on 13 April 2017. <ref name=\"cinra 20170413\" />\n\n===Music===\nComposer Muramatsu Takatsugu, who also scored Yonebayashi's last film ''[[When Marnie Was There]]'', is in charge of the soundtrack for ''Mary and the Witch's Flower''. Joshua Messick, one of the world's leading performers of the [[hammered dulcimer]], participated in the score recording.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" /><ref name=\"joshua messick ost\" />\n\nThe theme song is \"Rain\", performed by [[Sekai no Owari]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe story opens with an explosion inside a stone tower that bursts open a wall and leaves the place in flames. A young red-haired girl races away, a small pouch in her hand. Climbing to the end of a large tree branch, she's cornered there, but escapes when a broom flies by and she leaps on it. The people left behind send magical creatures after her, but she escapes.\n\nSometime later, Mary Smith moves into the northern English country estate of her Great-Aunt Charlotte ahead of her parents. The bored, friendless girl tries to make herself useful through chores, but she repeatedly messes up. A local boy named Peter teases her for both her clumsiness and her wild red hair, which she hates.\n\nTib-cat and Gib-cat, Peter's cats, lead Mary to some mysterious glowing flowers, one of which she picks. Zebedee, the estate gardener, identifies the flowers as \"fly-by-night\"; legend has it that witches covet the flower for its magical power. The next day, Gib-cat disappears and Mary follows Tib-cat to go look for her. Tib-cat leads her to a broomstick ensnared in a tree's roots. Mary frees the broomstick, but accidentally bursts a fly-by-night bulb on it. The bulb releases magical power in the form of a blue gelatinous substance, making the broomstick come to life and enabling Mary to ride it like a witch. The Little Broomstick whisks Mary and Tib-cat away to a complex of buildings hidden in the clouds, known as Endor College for witches and warlocks. It soon becomes clear that this is the place and the people from the opening scene.\n\nHead mistress Madam Mumblechook assumes Mary is a new pupil with Tib-cat as her familiar, and takes her on a tour of the college. The tour reveals a campus with modern technology and conveniences, where witches take courses in the magic arts alongside fields of science such as chemistry. During the tour Madam introduces Mary to Doctor Dee, the college's renowned chemistry teacher. Mary finds herself able to perform advanced spells such as invisibility. Madam and Doctor Dee become convinced that Mary is a prodigy, because of her performance as well as her red hair, which turns out be a distinguishing feature among the best witches.\n\nAt Madam's office, Mary finds a spell book hidden behind a picture of a fly-by-night. Mary admits that her magical ability comes from fly-by-night, and that Tib-cat actually belongs to Peter. Madam's attitude to Mary suddenly changes, but she still lets Mary return home once Mary turns over a piece of paper with Peter's address on it. She'd used it to deliver a package for her great-aunt. That night, Madam sends a message to Mary informing her that she's kidnapped Peter, and demands that Mary bring the fly-by-night bulbs to her. She and Tib-cat quickly fly back to Endor with the bulbs, but Madam and Doctor Dee imprison her in Doctor Dee's transformation spell lab. Mary finds Peter locked in the lab with her, and discovers that Doctor Dee has been experimenting on animals, including Gib-cat, transforming them into fantastic creatures. In the spell book, Mary finds a spell that can undo all magic, and she uses it to undo all the transformations and to unlock the lab. They try to escape on the Little Broomstick, but Madam and Doctor Dee recapture Peter. Before she is carried off, she vows to come back for him. \n\nThe Little Broomstick takes Mary to an isolated cottage on a tiny island that seems to be alive. Voices welcome here home, lighting lanterns and opening the door, and acting as if she's coming back. Within the cottage, Mary finds notes on transformation spells and a mirror that Great-Aunt Charlotte uses to contact her. Charlotte uses a sort of flashback image - Mary and her younger self walk through visions of the past - and she reveals that the cottage was her previous home, and she used to be a red-haired pupil who excelled at Endor. But one day Charlotte found fly-by-night on the campus, leading Madam and Doctor Dee to obsessively pursue a project to use the flower to transform all humans into witches. When one of their experiments disastrously failed, Charlotte decided to escape Endor, taking the flower with her. Charlotte begs Mary to use her last bulbs to return home, but Mary vows to rescue Peter instead. Madam shows up and tries to catch Mary, but she manages to slip away, and races back to the school.\n\nMary returns to Endor and finds Madam and Doctor Dee trying to use the flower to transform Peter into a witch. But the experiment fails again, leaving Peter trapped within a gelatinous monster that rampages across the campus. Mary gets the spell book to Peter, and he uses it to undo the failed experiment as well as all of Madam and Doctor Dee's research. Mary and Peter fly home, with Mary throwing away her last bulb and saying she does not need magic.\n\n==Characters==\n*Mary Smith, an 11 year old who is the main character of this story. She is innocent and often curious. She has red hair tied in twin bunches to the side, blue eyes, and [[freckles]]. She moves to the red house where her Great-Aunt Charlotte lives, but she does nothing well and spends her days in frustration and anxiety. One day, she finds a fly-by-night flower in the forest which eventually leads her to Endor College. {{voiced by|[[Hana Sugisaki]]|[[Ruby Barnhill]]}}<ref name=\"voice casts\" />\n*Peter, a 12 year old boy who delivers newspapers in the village.

Based on ''The Little Broomstick'' by [[Mary Stewart (novelist)|Mary Stewart]], this is Studio Ponoc's first feature film.<ref name=\"ponoc features\" />\n\nThe film tells a story of a girl named Mary Smith who finds \"fly-by-night\", a mysterious flower that can give her the power to become a witch for only one night.<ref name=\"polygon 20161216\" /><ref name=\"youtube trailer 2016\" /> The film was released in Japan on 8 July 2017.<ref name=\"imdb title\" /> In the English-language version of the film, which was concurrently released with a subtitled version in the United States on 19 January 2018, the film features the voices of [[Ruby Barnhill]], [[Kate Winslet]], and [[Jim Broadbent]].\n\n==Production==\nOn 15 December 2016 Yonebayashi and Nishimura  held a press conference. Here Yonebayashi, who had previously worked with Ghibli on \"[[When Marnie Was There]]\" and ''[[Arrietty]]'', said \"This is the first movie since leaving Studio Ghibli. At Studio Ponoc, we are working diligently with Yoshiaki Nishimura, a producer, and excellent staff.\"<ref name=\"natalie 213392\" />\n\nWhen Nishimura was asked about the establishment of the new studio he said, \"When the Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki notified me about the dissolution of the Ghibli Production Department , I was stimulated by the oversea creators when I went to the Academy Awards venue with \"[[The Tale of the Princess Kaguya|The Tale of Princess Kaguya]]\" Remember that you received it.\" After announcing it was based on The Little Broomstick, Nisimura said \"''[[When Marnie Was There|Marnie of Memories]]'' is a work that proved that Yonebayashi, who excels at dynamic painting, sealed his specialty and can draw trivial emotions. But as a producer, I want to see dynamic animation, so I decided to do a fantasy with a cheerful girl moving around.\" When asked if he consulted with Takahata or Miyasaki, he said he did not show Miyazaki any storyboards but he did talk to him. They both said the same thing, \"be prepared\".<ref name=\"natalie 213392\" /> Yonebayashi announced the voice actors on 13 April 2017. <ref name=\"cinra 20170413\" />\n\n===Music===\nComposer Muramatsu Takatsugu, who also scored Yonebayashi's last film ''[[When Marnie Was There]]'', is in charge of the soundtrack for ''Mary and the Witch's Flower''. Joshua Messick, one of the world's leading performers of the [[hammered dulcimer]], participated in the score recording.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" /><ref name=\"joshua messick ost\" />\n\nThe theme song is \"Rain\", performed by [[Sekai no Owari]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe story opens with an explosion inside a stone tower that bursts open a wall and leaves the place in flames. A young red-haired girl races away, a small pouch in her hand. Climbing to the end of a large tree branch, she's cornered there, but escapes when a broom flies by and she leaps on it. The people left behind send magical creatures after her, but she escapes.\n\nSometime later, Mary Smith moves into the northern English country estate of her Great-Aunt Charlotte ahead of her parents. The bored, friendless girl tries to make herself useful through chores, but she repeatedly messes up. A local boy named Peter teases her for both her clumsiness and her wild red hair, which she hates.\n\nTib-cat and Gib-cat, Peter's cats, lead Mary to some mysterious glowing flowers, one of which she picks. Zebedee, the estate gardener, identifies the flowers as \"fly-by-night\"; legend has it that witches covet the flower for its magical power. The next day, Gib-cat disappears and Mary follows Tib-cat to go look for her. Tib-cat leads her to a broomstick ensnared in a tree's roots. Mary frees the broomstick, but accidentally bursts a fly-by-night bulb on it. The bulb releases magical power in the form of a blue gelatinous substance, making the broomstick come to life and enabling Mary to ride it like a witch. The Little Broomstick whisks Mary and Tib-cat away to a complex of buildings hidden in the clouds, known as Endor College for witches. It soon becomes clear that this is the place and the people from the opening scene.\n\nHead mistress Madam Mumblechook assumes Mary is a new pupil with Tib-cat as her familiar, and takes her on a tour of the college. The tour reveals a campus with modern technology and conveniences, where witches take courses in the magic arts alongside fields of science such as chemistry. During the tour Madam introduces Mary to Doctor Dee, the college's renowned chemistry teacher. Mary finds herself able to perform advanced spells such as invisibility. Madam and Doctor Dee become convinced that Mary is a prodigy, because of her performance as well as her red hair, which turns out be a distinguishing feature among the best witches.\n\nAt Madam's office, Mary finds a spell book hidden behind a picture of a fly-by-night. Mary admits that her magical ability comes from fly-by-night, and that Tib-cat actually belongs to Peter. Madam's attitude to Mary suddenly changes, but she still lets Mary return home once Mary turns over a piece of paper with Peter's address on it. She'd used it to deliver a package for her great-aunt. That night, Madam sends a message to Mary informing her that she's kidnapped Peter, and demands that Mary bring the fly-by-night bulbs to her. She and Tib-cat quickly fly back to Endor with the bulbs, but Madam and Doctor Dee imprison her in Doctor Dee's transformation spell lab. Mary finds Peter locked in the lab with her, and discovers that Doctor Dee has been experimenting on animals, including Gib-cat, transforming them into fantastic creatures. In the spell book, Mary finds a spell that can undo all magic, and she uses it to undo all the transformations and to unlock the lab. They try to escape on the Little Broomstick, but Madam and Doctor Dee recapture Peter. Before she is carried off, she vows to come back for him. \n\nThe Little Broomstick takes Mary to an isolated cottage on a tiny island that seems to be alive. Voices welcome here home, lighting lanterns and opening the door, and acting as if she's coming back. Within the cottage, Mary finds notes on transformation spells and a mirror that Great-Aunt Charlotte uses to contact her. Charlotte uses a sort of flashback image - Mary and her younger self walk through visions of the past - and she reveals that the cottage was her previous home, and she used to be a red-haired pupil who excelled at Endor. But one day Charlotte found fly-by-night on the campus, leading Madam and Doctor Dee to obsessively pursue a project to use the flower to transform all humans into witches. When one of their experiments disastrously failed, Charlotte decided to escape Endor, taking the flower with her. Charlotte begs Mary to use her last bulbs to return home, but Mary vows to rescue Peter instead. Madam shows up and tries to catch Mary, but she manages to slip away, and races back to the school.\n\nMary returns to Endor and finds Madam and Doctor Dee trying to use the flower to transform Peter into a witch. But the experiment fails again, leaving Peter trapped within a gelatinous monster that rampages across the campus. Mary gets the spell book to Peter, and he uses it to undo the failed experiment as well as all of Madam and Doctor Dee's research. Mary and Peter fly home, with Mary throwing away her last bulb and saying she does not need magic.\n\n==Characters==\n*Mary Smith, an 11 year old who is the main character of this story. She is innocent and often curious. She has red hair tied in twin bunches to the side, blue eyes, and [[freckles]].

One day, she finds a fly-by-night flower in the forest which eventually leads her to Endor College. {{voiced by|[[Hana Sugisaki]]|[[Ruby Barnhill]]}}<ref name=\"voice casts\" />\n*Peter, a 12 year old boy who delivers newspapers in the village.

However, he overcame this handicap and became profoundly versed in Jain logic and rose to become a professor at Banaras Hindu University.

During his lifetime he won such awards as the [[Sahitya Akademi Award to Gujarati Writers|Sahitya Akademi Award]] and won recognition from the Government of India by getting [[Padma Bhushan]] award. Sukhlalji was also known as ''Pragnachaksu'' because he was so vastly learned despite being visually challenged.\n\n==Early life==\nSukhlal was born in the village of Limli village of [[Surendranagar district]], Gujarat on 8 December 1880 (fifth day of the bright day of the month of Margshirsh in [[Vikram Samvat]] 1937).<ref name=mohanlal>{{cite book | last =Mohan Lal | first = |title =Encyclopaedia of Indian literature, Volume 5| publisher =Sahitya Akademi| year =2006 | location =New Delhi | ISBN =81-260-1221-8}} p. 4215</ref> He belonged to Visa Shrimali [[Bania (caste)|Vanik]] community (merchant community) of Gujarat.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Talshi Sanghvi and his first wife Maniben were his parents. His mother died when he was four years old. He was raised in Limbdi by his distant relative, Muljibhai from [[Sayla]]. He lost his eyesight following [[small pox]] infection when he was sixteen. This made him more introspective and he devoted his life to learning.<ref name=mohanlal />\n\n==Education==\nHe attended discourses of Jain monks, and studied scriptures with the help of a reader. In 1904, he joined Shri Yashovijaya Jain Sanskrit Pathshala at [[Benaras]]. Within three years he committed to memory the whole of ''Siddha-Hema-vyakarana''. Besides grammar, he studied ''Tarkasamraha'', ''Muktavali'', and ''Vyaptichakra'' with various commentaries. He also became well-conversant with epics like ''[[Raghuvamsha]]'', ''Maghakavya'', and ''Naishadhacharitam'', besides ''Alamkarashastra'' and ''Kosha''. For further studies he went to [[Mithila (India)|Mithila]] in 1911, and then to Kashi where he devoted himself to a study of philosophy and literature. Later, he went to [[Agra]] where he edited important Jain works like ''Panchapratikramana'', the first four Karma granthas of Devendrasuri. and ''Yogadarsana'' and ''Yogavimshika'' of [[Haribhadra]] Suri.<ref name=mohanlal /> After passing Nyayacarya examination he continued to teach at Jain pathshalas where his students included future scholar-monks like [[Muni Jinvijay]], Muni Lalitvijay and Muni Punyavijay.<ref>{{cite book | last =Wiley | first =Kristi | title =The A to Z of Jainism | publisher =Vision Books (originally published by Scarecrow Press) | year =2006 | location =Delhi | isbn =81-7094-690-5 | oclc =422763446 }} p. 190</ref>\n\n==Career as a scholar and a philosopher==\nIn 1922, he joined Puratattva Mandir of [[Gujarat Vidyapith]] as professor of [[Indian philosophy]]. Here he edited Sanamatitarka of Siddhasena Divakara in five volumes containing valuable indices and appendices. He was assisted by Pandit Bechardasji in this task. From 1933 to 1944 he was a professor of Jain Philosophy at [[Benaras Hindu University]]. He devoted most of his time to writing and editing a number of valuable works in Sanskrit, Hindi, and Gujarati. He edited [[Tattvarthasutra]] and Nyayavatara in Gujarati with texts and translations. He edited Pramana-mimamsa by [[Hemacandra]], with detailed introduction and notes. He not only corrected the original readings with the help of the photocopies of the original manuscripts but also gave other comparative readings. He critically edited Jayarashi's Tatavapaplava\u2014a systematic work of [[Charvaka]]s which brought him wide recognition. He threw new light on the history of [[Buddhist philosophy]] by editing Archata\u2019s commentary on [[Dharmakirti]]'s ''Hetubindu''. After retirement from Banaras Hindu University in 1944, he came back to [[Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan]] where he worked with Jain monk Acarya Jinavijayaji. In 1957, Sukhlalji was invited by the M.S. University of Baroda to deliver five lectures on Indian philosophy, which were published in Gujarati (1951), Hindi (1971) and English (1977). His scholarly lectures or ''Atma-Paramatma'' and ''Sadhana'' delivered at Gujarat Vidyasabha were also published in Hindi and Gujarati under the title of ''Adhyatma vicharana'' The University of Bombay also invited him for lectures on Acharya [[Haribhadra]], which were published both in Gujarati (1961) and in Hindi (1966).\n\n==Legacy and influences==\nYoung Sukhlalji was inspired by the writings of Pandit [[Nathuram Premi]], who was to become a close family friend. Sukhlalji was non-sectarian in his attitude and shared a good rapport with many [[Digambara]] scholars like Premiji and observed their mutual respect:<ref>Jain Study Circular (January\u2013April 2006 Issue)</ref>\n\n:\"He (Premiji) was considered to be a Pandit\u2014a scholar of Jain tradition. To me it was a surprise! How could his writings be so impartial and audacious? I had come in contact with many Jain friends and scholars, but until then, excepting a few, I had not come across any scholar who was as non-sectarian or fearless as Premiji. So I had developed the perception that it was impossible to find a Jain scholar who was non-sectarian as well as fearless. Premiji's writings gradually made me realize that I had the wrong notion. This was the foremost reason for me to be attracted towards him.\n:[...]\n:We had an excellent understanding of traditions of one another but we had no sectarian complicities.\"\n\nSukhlalji also mentored three scholars of Jainism \u2013 Mahendrakumar Nyayacarya, Padmanabh Jaini and [[Dalsukh Dahyabhai Malvania|Dalsukh Malvania]]. Out of these, the second and third were his direct students. Sukhlalji always insisted on learning of [[Pali Canon]] for understanding Jainism and encouraged young Padmanabh Jaini to visit [[Sri Lanka]] to study [[Buddhism]].<ref>Jaini, Padmanabh (2000). p. vii</ref> Author [[Bimal Krishna Matilal|B. K. Matilal]] notes that Sukhlalji advocated \"a non-partisan historical comparative study of any Sanskrit philosophical text\" and noted in his preface to ''Advanced Studies in Indian Logic and Metaphysics (1961)'':<ref>{{cite book | last =Matilal | first =Bimal Krishna | title =Logic, language, and reality: Indian philosophy and contemporary issues| publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publ | year =1990 | location =Delhi | isbn =81-208-0717-0 }} p. xv</ref>\n\"I became firmly convinced that the study of any philosophical system inevitably demands certain prerequisites and these prerequisites include a fairly accurate understanding of the historical inter-relationships between the various philosophical systems of India.\"\n\nHe was known for his vast learning, sound scholarship, remarkable memory and for being a very ethical and conscientious person. Pandit Sukhlalji worked with a vast array of scholars and was good friends with all of them, despite not always agreeing with them. Some of the luminaries he worked with include Muni [[Jinvijay]], Muni Punyavijaya, Acarya [[Prem Suri]], Pandit [[Nathuram Premi]], Pandit Jugalkishore Mukhtar, Dr. Hiralal Jain, Dr A. N.

However, he overcame this handicap and became profoundly versed in Jain logic and rose to become a professor at Banaras Hindu University. [[Paul Dundas]] calls him one of the most incisive modern interpreters of [[Jain philosophy]].<ref>{{cite book | last =Dundas | first =Paul |author2=John Hinnels ed.  | title =The Jains | publisher =Routledge | year =2002 | location =London | isbn =0-415-26606-8 }} p. 228</ref> Dundas notes that Sanghavi represents what now seems to be a virtually lost scholarly and intellectual world.<ref name=\"Jaini vi\">Jaini p.vi</ref> He was a mentor for famous Jain scholar [[Padmanabh Jaini]]. During his lifetime he won such awards as the [[Sahitya Akademi Award to Gujarati Writers|Sahitya Akademi Award]] and won recognition from the Government of India by getting [[Padma Bhushan]] award. Sukhlalji was also known as ''Pragnachaksu'' because he was so vastly learned despite being visually challenged.\n\n==Early life==\nSukhlal was born in the village of Limli village of [[Surendranagar district]], Gujarat on 8 December 1880 (fifth day of the bright day of the month of Margshirsh in [[Vikram Samvat]] 1937).<ref name=mohanlal>{{cite book | last =Mohan Lal | first = |title =Encyclopaedia of Indian literature, Volume 5| publisher =Sahitya Akademi| year =2006 | location =New Delhi | ISBN =81-260-1221-8}} p. 4215</ref> He belonged to '''Visa Shrimali [[Bania (caste)|Vanik]]''' community (merchant community) of Gujarat.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Talshi Sanghvi and his first wife Maniben were his parents. His mother died when he was four years old. He was raised in Limbdi by his  distant relative, Muljibhai from [[Sayla]]. He lost his eyesight following [[small pox]] infection when he was sixteen.  This made him more introspective and he devoted his life to learning.<ref name=mohanlal />\n\n==Learning==\nHe attended discourses of Jain monks, and studied scriptures with the help of a reader. In 1904, he joined Shri Yashovijaya Jain Sanskrit Pathshala at [[Benaras]]. Within three years he committed to memory the whole of ''Siddha-Hema-vyakarana''. Besides grammar, he studied ''Tarkasamraha'', ''Muktavali'', and ''Vyaptichakra'' with various commentaries. He also became well-conversant with epics like ''[[Raghuvamsha]]'', ''Maghakavya'', and ''Naishadhacharitam'', besides ''Alamkarashastra'' and ''Kosha''. For further studies he went to [[Mithila (India)|Mithila]] in 1911, and then to Kashi where he devoted himself to a study of philosophy and literature. Later, he went to [[Agra]] where he edited important Jain works like ''Panchapratikramana'', the first four Karma granthas of Devendrasuri. and ''Yogadarsana'' and ''Yogavimshika'' of [[Haribhadra]] Suri.<ref name=mohanlal /> After passing Nyayacarya examination he continued to teach at Jain pathshalas where his students included future scholar-monks like [[Muni Jinvijay]], Muni Lalitvijay and Muni Punyavijay.<ref>{{cite book | last =Wiley | first =Kristi | title =The A to Z of Jainism | publisher =Vision Books (originally published by Scarecrow Press) | year =2006 | location =Delhi | isbn =81-7094-690-5 | oclc =422763446 }} p. 190</ref>\n\n==Career as a scholar and a philosopher==\nIn 1922 he joined Puratattva Mandir of [[Gujarat Vidyapith]] as professor of [[Indian philosophy]]. Here he edited Sanamatitarka of Siddhasena Divakara in five volumes containing valuable indices and appendices. He was assisted by Pandit Bechardasji in this task. From 1933 to 1944 he was a professor of Jain Philosophy at [[Benaras Hindu University]]. He devoted most of his time to writing and editing a number of valuable works in Sanskrit, Hindi, and Gujarati. He edited [[Tattvarthasutra]] and Nyayavatara in Gujarati with texts and translations. He edited Pramana-mimamsa by [[Hemacandra]], with detailed introduction and notes. He not only corrected the original readings with the help of the photocopies of the original manuscripts but also gave other comparative readings. He critically edited Jayarashi's Tatavapaplava\u2014a systematic work of [[Charvaka]]s which brought him wide recognition. He threw new light on the history of [[Buddhist philosophy]] by editing Archata\u2019s commentary on [[Dharmakirti]]'s ''Hetubindu''. After retirement from Banaras Hindu University in 1944, he came back to [[Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan]] where he worked with Jain monk Acarya Jinavijayaji. In 1957, Sukhlalji was invited by the M.S. University of Baroda to deliver five lectures on Indian philosophy, which were published in Gujarati (1951), Hindi (1971) and English (1977). His scholarly lectures or ''Atma-Paramatma'' and ''Sadhana'' delivered at Gujarat Vidyasabha were also published in Hindi and Gujarati under the title of ''Adhyatma vicharana'' The University of Bombay also invited him for lectures on Acharya [[Haribhadra]], which were published both in Gujarati (1961) and in Hindi (1966).\n\n==Legacy and influences==\nYoung Sukhlalji was inspired by the writings of Pandit [[Nathuram Premi]], who was to become a close family friend. Sukhlalji was non-sectarian in his attitude and shared a good rapport with many [[Digambara]] scholars like Premiji and observed their mutual respect:<ref>Jain Study Circular (January\u2013April 2006 Issue)</ref>\n\n:\"He (Premiji) was considered to be a Pandit\u2014a scholar of Jain tradition. To me it was a surprise! How could his writings be so impartial and audacious? I had come in contact with many Jain friends and scholars, but until then, excepting a few, I had not come across any scholar who was as non-sectarian or fearless as Premiji. So I had developed the perception that it was impossible to find a Jain scholar who was non-sectarian as well as fearless. Premiji's writings gradually made me realize that I had the wrong notion. This was the foremost reason for me to be attracted towards him.\n:[...]\n:We had an excellent understanding of traditions of one another but we had no sectarian complicities.\"\n\nSukhlalji also mentored three scholars of Jainism \u2013 Mahendrakumar Nyayacarya, Padmanabh Jaini and [[Dalsukh Dahyabhai Malvania|Dalsukh Malvania]]. Out of these, the second and third were his direct students. Sukhlalji always insisted on learning of [[Pali Canon]] for understanding Jainism and encouraged young Padmanabh Jaini to visit [[Sri Lanka]] to study [[Buddhism]].<ref>Jaini, Padmanabh (2000). p. vii</ref> Author [[Bimal Krishna Matilal|B. K. Matilal]] notes that Sukhlalji advocated \"a non-partisan historical comparative study of any Sanskrit philosophical text\" and noted in his preface to ''Advanced Studies in Indian Logic and Metaphysics (1961)'':<ref>{{cite book | last =Matilal | first =Bimal Krishna | title =Logic, language, and reality: Indian philosophy and contemporary issues| publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publ | year =1990 | location =Delhi | isbn =81-208-0717-0 }} p. xv</ref>\n\"I became firmly convinced that the study of any philosophical system inevitably demands certain prerequisites and these prerequisites include a fairly accurate understanding of the historical inter-relationships between the various philosophical systems of India.\"\n\nHe was known for his vast learning, sound scholarship, remarkable memory and for being a very ethical and conscientious person. Pandit Sukhlalji worked with a vast array of scholars and was good friends with all of them, despite not always agreeing with them. Some of the luminaries he worked with include Muni [[Jinvijay]], Muni Punyavijaya, Acarya [[Prem Suri]], Pandit [[Nathuram Premi]], Pandit Jugalkishore Mukhtar, Dr. Hiralal Jain, Dr A. N. Upadhye, Dr. Mahendrakumar Nyayacarya, Prof. Dr. [[Padmanabh Jaini]], Dr. [[Dalsukh Dahyabhai Malvania]] and Dr. Nagin J.

Located south of [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], it is bordered by the [[Fraser River]] to the north, the United States ([[Point Roberts, Washington]]) to the south and the city of [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]] to the east. Delta is composed of three distinct communities: [[Ladner, British Columbia|Ladner]], [[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|Tsawwassen]], and [[North Delta, British Columbia|North Delta]].\n\n==History==\nPrior to European settlement, Delta's flatlands and coastal shores were inhabited by the [[Tsawwassen First Nation|Tsawwassen]] [[indigenous peoples]], of the [[Coast Salish peoples|Coast Salish]] [[First Nations]]. The land was first sighted by Europeans in 1791, when Spanish explorer Lieutenant [[Francisco de Eliza]] mistook the area for an island and named it \"Isla de Cepeda\". The first European settler in Delta was James Kennedy who pre-empted 135 acres in what later became Annieville in February 1860. Thomas and [[William Henry Ladner|William Ladner]], began farming the area named after them in 1868. Farming and fishing helped the community grow quickly over the next few decades. In 1879, the area was incorporated as a municipality, named \"the Corporation of Delta\", and the village of Ladner was made as its administrative centre.\n\nDue to its geography, Delta was a relatively isolated community. The completion of the [[George Massey Tunnel]] in 1959 linking Ladner to [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]] and [[Vancouver]] along with the opening, in 1960, of the [[Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal]] and the [[British Columbia Highway 99|Highway 99]] being rerouted from the King George Highway in Surrey in 1962 to a new route through Delta, ended Delta's isolation and resulted in a massive 400% population growth over the next 20 years. The 1986 completion of the [[Alex Fraser Bridge]] connecting [[North Delta, British Columbia|North Delta]] to [[New Westminster]] and Vancouver also helped Delta's growth.\n\nOn September 22, 2017, at the request of Delta's council, the [[British Columbia#Government and politics|Government of British Columbia]] changed the name and classification of the Corporation of Delta to the City of Delta.<ref name=citystatus>{{cite web |publisher =Province of British Columbia |url=http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/oic/oic_cur/0362_2017 |title=Order of the Lieutenant Governor in Council |date=September 22, 2017 |accessdate=April 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Neighbourhoods==\nDelta comprises three distinct, geographically separate communities:\n*[[North Delta, British Columbia|North Delta]] (pop: 51,623) is home to over half of Delta's population. It is a largely suburban area in north-east Delta bordered by the [[Burns Bog]] and [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]].\n*[[Ladner, British Columbia|Ladner]] (pop: 21,112) is a 19th-century fishing village in north-west Delta that has expanded into a suburb. Fishing and farming are important industries. Ladner Trunk Road is its main street.\n*[[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|Tsawwassen]] (pop: 20,933) is a suburban community in south-west Delta that calls itself the sunniest place in [[Metro Vancouver]]. Luxury waterfront homes line Tsawwassen's coast. Tsawwassen is also home to the busy Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal which links the mainland to [[Vancouver Island]] and the [[Gulf Islands]]. Tsawwassen, together with Ladner are also known as South Delta.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Historical populations\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = right\n|width       = \n|state       = \n|shading     = \n|percentages = \n|footnote    = <ref>{{cite web|title=Census of Canada Historical Census Populations Municipalities from 1921 to 2011|url=https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/statistics/people-population-community/census}}</ref>\n|1921|2839\n|1931|3709\n|1941|4287\n|1951|6701\n|1956|8752\n|1961|14597\n|1966|20664\n|1971|45860\n|1976|64492\n|1981|74692\n|1986|79610\n|1991|88978\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]|95411\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]|96950\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]|96723\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]|99863\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]|102238\n}}\n\nAccording to the [[2011 canadian census|2011 Canadian Census]],<ref>2011 NHS/Census Profile of Delta: http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=5915011&Data=Count&SearchText=delta&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&A1=All&B1=All&Custom=&TABID=1</ref> the population of Delta is 99,863, a 3.3% increase from 2006. The population density is 554.4 people per square km. The median age is 42.8 years old, which is slightly higher than the national median age at 40.6 years old. There are 35,781 private dwellings with an occupancy rate of 97.1%. According to the 2011 National Household Survey, the median value of a dwelling in Delta is $562,181 which is significantly higher than the national average at $280,552. The median household income (after-taxes) in Delta is $71,590, quite higher than the national average at $54,089.\n===Ethnicity===\nAs of 2016, Delta's population is 102,238. About 36% of Delta's population are visible minorities, of which there are approximately 20,500 [[South Asian Canadian|South Asians]] and 7,700 [[Chinese Canadian|Chinese]] Canadians. There are also about 2,200 [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] peoples, some from Tsawwassen First Nation, who still hold a fraction of their former traditional territories on the [[Tsawwassen First Nation]] at the mouth of the Fraser River, which are shared with the [[Hwlitsum First Nation]] from the [[Gulf Islands]]. Forming over 20% of the population, Delta hosts the fourth largest South Asian population in British Columbia after neighbouring Vancouver, Surrey and Abbotsford.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | Racial Demographics of Delta<ref>[http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/prof/92-591/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=5915011&Geo2=PR&Code2=59&Data=Count&SearchText=Delta&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom=], Community Profiles from the 2006 Census, Statistics Canada - Census Subdivision</ref><ref name=\"delta-2016\">https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/search-recherche/results-resultats.cfm?Lang=E&TABID=1&G=1&Geo1=&Code1=&Geo2=&Code2=&SearchText=delta&SearchType=Begins&wb-srch-place=search Census Profile, 2016 Census\nDelta, District municipality [Census subdivision].

[[North Delta, British Columbia|North Delta]] is also home to the [[Burns Bog]], 40 square kilometres (10,000 acres) of natural [[wetland]]s that are important for wildlife.\n\nDelta includes [[Annacis Island]], an industrial island reached via the [[Alex Fraser Bridge]], which connects Delta with [[Richmond, BC|Richmond]] and [[New Westminster]].  Delta also includes a peninsula on the east side of the Fraser River at Delta's northern city limits, which is only accessible via [[Surrey, BC|Surrey]].\n\n===Climate===\nDelta is known for its relatively dry and sunny climate compared with other locations in [[Metro Vancouver Regional District|Metro Vancouver]].

The current mayor is George Harvie. Unlike most communities in Canada, but like [[Vancouver]] and [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], Delta has a system of locally based [[Slate (elections)|election slates]] such as TriDelta, IDEA, One Delta, Delta Residents Association, Delta Connect, DIVA, Independents Working For You, and Achieving For Delta.\n\nIn the [[House of Commons of Canada]], Delta is part of the [[Delta (electoral district)|Delta electoral district]]. As of the 2015 Federal general election, Delta's seat is held by [[Carla Qualtrough]] of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]]. In the 2017 Provincial general election, the North Delta seat went to [[Ravi Kahlon]] of the [[British Columbia New Democratic Party]] while the South Delta seat went to [[Ian Paton (politician)|Ian Paton]] of the [[British Columbia Liberal Party]]. \n\nDelta, unlike most Lower Mainland municipalities, has its own [[Delta Police Department|police department]].\n\nFormer Delta mayor [[Lois Jackson]] served from 1999 to 2018 and since 1973 has had a seat on Delta Council. Jackson was elected to council again in 2018.\n\n==Power==\nIn Delta is the Arnott Substation (ARN), the mainland terminal of the [[HVDC Vancouver Island]] circuit.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Alex Fraser Bridge 02.jpg|alt=|thumb|250x250px|The [[Alex Fraser Bridge]] links Delta to [[New Westminster]] and Richmond.]]\n\n*Public transportation in Delta is provided by the [[TransLink (British Columbia)|South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority]] bus system. There is no rapid transit system in Delta, though the [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] system in [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]] comes within three kilometres of the city's borders.\n*Delta is a major transportation hub for the Lower Mainland. Most vehicles leaving Vancouver for the United States pass through Delta's borders. Many vehicles destined for Vancouver Island use the Tsawwassen ferry terminal in Delta.\n*[[British Columbia Highway 99|Highway 99]] links [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]] to Delta via the [[George Massey Tunnel]], built in 1959. [[North Delta, British Columbia|North Delta]] is linked to [[New Westminster]] and Richmond by [[British Columbia Highway 91|Highway 91]] and the massive [[Alex Fraser Bridge]] (opened in 1986). Delta is linked to Surrey, [[Langley, British Columbia (district municipality)|Langley]], and all points eastward by [[British Columbia Highway 10|Highway 10]]. Traffic congestion during rush hour is quite common, although improvements area being made to Highway 91 interchanges at 72 Ave to remove a traffic light as well the ramps from Nordel Way. \n*[[British Columbia Highway 17|Highway 17]] in Delta provides a connection to the Tsawwassen [[BC Ferries|B.C. Ferry]] terminal, which provides car ferry connections to [[Vancouver Island]] and the [[Gulf Islands]]. In December 2013, north of the current junction with Deltaport Way, Highway 17 will be rerouted upon completion of the \"South Fraser Perimeter Road\", and will primarily run parallel to River Road through Tilbury and North Delta to all points east. The remaining stretch of Highway 17 north of that point will be renamed [[British Columbia Highway 17A|Highway 17A]].\n*River Road is also another connector through the municipality. River Road starts in Surrey and heads westbound through North Delta, under the Alex Fraser Bridge, north of Burns Bog, and then terminates at 62B Street, which then turns into Highway 17A.\n*Like River Road, the western communities of \"South Delta\" (Ladner and Tsawwassen) are linked to North Delta and communities to the east by Ladner Trunk Road; east of its crossover of Highway 91, the road becomes Highway 10.\n*[[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|56th Street]] is another major artery in the community, bisecting the Tsawwassen region; it is the only road leading into the community of [[Point Roberts, Washington|Point Roberts]], south of the Canada\u2013US border.\n*Delta is also home to [[Boundary Bay Airport]], [[List of the busiest airports in Canada|Canada's seventh busiest airport by aircraft movements]]. Boundary Bay Airport is primarily used for private aircraft, commercial charters, and flying lessons.\n\n===Major highways===\n*{{jct|state=BC|BC|10}}\n*{{jct|state=BC|BC|17}}\n*{{jct|state=BC|BC|17A}}\n*{{jct|state=BC|BC|91}}\n*{{jct|state=BC|BC|99}}\n\n== Health ==\nDelta is the westernmost community served by [[Fraser Health|Fraser Health Authority]] which operates [[Delta Hospital]] in Ladner and also funds home and community care. The Delta Hospice Society operates a facility near to the hospital.\n\n== Education ==\n[[Delta Public Schools]] operates Anglophone public schools in the city.\n\nThe ''[[Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique]]'' operates one Francophone primary school in that city: ''\u00e9cole du Bois-joli''.<ref>\"[http://www.csf.bc.ca/ecoles/en-colombie-britannique/carte-des-ecoles/ Carte des \u00e9coles].\" ''[[Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique]]''. Retrieved on 22 January 2015.</ref>\n\n==Delta sports==\nDelta has many minor sports teams in ice hockey, soccer, football, field hockey, baseball, softball, field lacrosse and box lacrosse. Over 160 young people play [[ringette]] in Delta. The Delta Ringette Association has 13 teams in 2005.\nNotable professional sports players from Delta are [[Jeff Francis]] (MLB), [[James Paxton (baseball)|James Paxton]] (MLB), [[Justin Morneau]] (MLB), [[Brent Seabrook]] (NHL), [[Troy Brouwer]] (NHL) and [[Mitch Berger]] (NFL).\n[[File:TourdeDeltaAD.jpg|thumb|right|[[White Spot / Delta Road Race (men's race)|Tour de Delta]] wall cover on electrical box outside of Delta, British Columbia municipal hall]] Delta's unique and varying terrain provides a challenging test for many of the world's best cyclists in the Tour de Delta (one day races, for [[White Spot / Delta Road Race (men's race)|men]] since 2001, and for [[White Spot / Delta Road Race (women's race)|women]] since 2011). Since its first event in 2001, the Tour de Delta has grown to be Canada's largest cycling event, held annually in July as part of BC Superweek.\nThe Delta Triathlon is also a very popular event, selling out each year in April. The event takes place in Ladner from the Ladner Leisure Centre.

Located south of [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], it is bordered by the [[Fraser River]] to the north, the United States ([[Point Roberts, Washington]]) to the south and the city of [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]] to the east. Delta is composed of three distinct communities: [[Ladner, British Columbia|Ladner]], [[Tsawwassen]], and [[North Delta, British Columbia|North Delta]].\n\n==History==\nPrior to European settlement, Delta's flatlands and coastal shores were inhabited by the [[Tsawwassen First Nation|Tsawwassen]] [[indigenous peoples]], of the [[Coast Salish peoples|Coast Salish]] [[First Nations]]. The land was first sighted by Europeans in 1791, when Spanish explorer Lieutenant [[Francisco de Eliza]] mistook the area for an island and named it \"Isla de Cepeda\". The first European settler in Delta was James Kennedy who pre-empted 135 acres in what later became Annieville in February 1860. Thomas and [[William Henry Ladner|William Ladner]], began farming the area named after them in 1868. Farming and fishing helped the community grow quickly over the next few decades. In 1879, the area was incorporated as a municipality, named \"the Corporation of Delta\", and the village of Ladner was made as its administrative centre.\n\nDue to its geography, Delta was a relatively isolated community. The completion of the [[George Massey Tunnel]] in 1959 linking Ladner to [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]] and [[Vancouver]] along with the opening, in 1960, of the [[Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal]] and the [[British Columbia Highway 99|Highway 99]] being rerouted from the King George Highway in Surrey in 1962 to a new route through Delta, ended Delta's isolation and resulted in a massive 400% population growth over the next 20 years. The 1986 completion of the [[Alex Fraser Bridge]] connecting [[North Delta, British Columbia|North Delta]] to [[New Westminster]] and Vancouver also helped Delta's growth.\n\nOn September 22, 2017, at the request of Delta's council, the [[British Columbia#Government and politics|Government of British Columbia]] changed the name and classification of the Corporation of Delta to the City of Delta.<ref name=citystatus>{{cite web |publisher =Province of British Columbia |url=http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/oic/oic_cur/0362_2017 |title=Order of the Lieutenant Governor in Council |date=September 22, 2017 |accessdate=April 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Neighbourhoods==\nDelta comprises three distinct, geographically separate communities:\n*[[North Delta, British Columbia|North Delta]] (pop: 51,623) is home to over half of Delta's population. It is a largely suburban area in north-east Delta bordered by the [[Burns Bog]] and [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]].\n*[[Ladner, British Columbia|Ladner]] (pop: 21,112) is a 19th-century fishing village in north-west Delta that has expanded into a suburb. Fishing and farming are important industries. Ladner Trunk Road is its main street.\n*[[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|Tsawwassen]] (pop: 20,933) is a suburban community in south-west Delta that calls itself the sunniest place in [[Metro Vancouver]]. Luxury waterfront homes line Tsawwassen's coast. Tsawwassen is also home to the busy Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal which links the mainland to [[Vancouver Island]] and the [[Gulf Islands]]. Tsawwassen, together with Ladner are also known as South Delta.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Historical populations\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = right\n|width       = \n|state       = \n|shading     = \n|percentages = \n|footnote    = <ref>{{cite web|title=Census of Canada Historical Census Populations Municipalities from 1921 to 2011|url=https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/statistics/people-population-community/census}}</ref>\n|1921|2839\n|1931|3709\n|1941|4287\n|1951|6701\n|1956|8752\n|1961|14597\n|1966|20664\n|1971|45860\n|1976|64492\n|1981|74692\n|1986|79610\n|1991|88978\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]|95411\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]|96950\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]|96723\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]|99863\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]|102238\n}}\n\nAccording to the [[2011 canadian census|2011 Canadian Census]],<ref>2011 NHS/Census Profile of Delta: http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=5915011&Data=Count&SearchText=delta&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&A1=All&B1=All&Custom=&TABID=1</ref> the population of Delta is 99,863, a 3.3% increase from 2006.

It is bordered by water on three sides: The [[Fraser River]] to the north, the [[Strait of Georgia|Georgia Strait]] to the west and [[Boundary Bay]] to the south. At {{convert|364|km2}}, Delta is the largest municipality in the GVRD; the second largest is its neighbour to the east, [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]], at {{convert|317.4|km2}}.\n\n[[File:Trachycarpus fortunei 56 st tsawwassen bc.jpg|thumb|250px|Trachycarpus Fortunei [[Palm Tree]]s line some streets in [[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|Tsawwassen]]]]\n\nDelta's flat, fertile land has made it one of the most important agricultural areas in [[Greater Vancouver]]. The [[Agricultural Land Reserve]] regulations preserve most of this land for agricultural use, preventing its conversion to suburban housing. [[North Delta, British Columbia|North Delta]] is also home to the [[Burns Bog]], 40 square kilometres (10,000 acres) of natural [[wetland]]s that are important for wildlife.\n\nDelta includes [[Annacis Island]], an industrial island reached via the [[Alex Fraser Bridge]], which connects Delta with [[Richmond, BC|Richmond]] and [[New Westminster]].  Delta also includes a peninsula on the east side of the Fraser River at Delta's northern city limits, which is only accessible via [[Surrey, BC|Surrey]].\n\n===Climate===\nDelta is known for its relatively dry and sunny climate compared with other locations in [[Metro Vancouver Regional District|Metro Vancouver]].

The current mayor is George Harvie. Unlike most communities in Canada, but like [[Vancouver]] and [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], Delta has a system of locally based [[Slate (elections)|election slates]] such as TriDelta, IDEA, One Delta, Delta Residents Association, Delta Connect, DIVA, Independents Working For You, and Achieving For Delta.\n\nIn the [[House of Commons of Canada]], Delta is part of the [[Delta (electoral district)|Delta electoral district]]. As of the 2015 Federal general election, Delta's seat is held by [[Carla Qualtrough]] of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]]. In the 2017 Provincial general election, the North Delta seat went to [[Ravi Kahlon]] of the [[British Columbia New Democratic Party]] while the South Delta seat went to [[Ian Paton (politician)|Ian Paton]] of the [[British Columbia Liberal Party]]. \n\nDelta, unlike most Lower Mainland municipalities, has its own [[Delta Police Department|police department]].\n\nFormer Delta mayor [[Lois Jackson]] served from 1999 to 2018 and since 1973 has had a seat on Delta Council. Jackson was elected to council again in 2018.\n\n==Power==\nIn Delta is the Arnott Substation (ARN), the mainland terminal of the [[HVDC Vancouver Island]] circuit.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Alex Fraser Bridge 02.jpg|alt=|thumb|250x250px|The [[Alex Fraser Bridge]] links Delta to [[New Westminster]] and Richmond.]]\n\n*Public transportation in Delta is provided by the [[TransLink (British Columbia)|South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority]] bus system. There is no rapid transit system in Delta, though the [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] system in [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]] comes within three kilometres of the city's borders.\n*Delta is a major transportation hub for the Lower Mainland. Most vehicles leaving Vancouver for the United States pass through Delta's borders. Many vehicles destined for Vancouver Island use the Tsawwassen ferry terminal in Delta.\n*[[British Columbia Highway 99|Highway 99]] links [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]] to Delta via the [[George Massey Tunnel]], built in 1959. [[North Delta, British Columbia|North Delta]] is linked to [[New Westminster]] and Richmond by [[British Columbia Highway 91|Highway 91]] and the massive [[Alex Fraser Bridge]] (opened in 1986). Delta is linked to Surrey, [[Langley, British Columbia (district municipality)|Langley]], and all points eastward by [[British Columbia Highway 10|Highway 10]]. Traffic congestion during rush hour is quite common, although improvements area being made to Highway 91 interchanges at 72 Ave to remove a traffic light as well the ramps from Nordel Way. \n*[[British Columbia Highway 17|Highway 17]] in Delta provides a connection to the Tsawwassen [[BC Ferries|B.C. Ferry]] terminal, which provides car ferry connections to [[Vancouver Island]] and the [[Gulf Islands]]. In December 2013, north of the current junction with Deltaport Way, Highway 17 will be rerouted upon completion of the \"South Fraser Perimeter Road\", and will primarily run parallel to River Road through Tilbury and North Delta to all points east. The remaining stretch of Highway 17 north of that point will be renamed [[British Columbia Highway 17A|Highway 17A]].\n*River Road is also another connector through the municipality. River Road starts in Surrey and heads westbound through North Delta, under the Alex Fraser Bridge, north of Burns Bog, and then terminates at 62B Street, which then turns into Highway 17A.\n*Like River Road, the western communities of \"South Delta\" (Ladner and Tsawwassen) are linked to North Delta and communities to the east by Ladner Trunk Road; east of its crossover of Highway 91, the road becomes Highway 10.\n*[[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|56th Street]] is another major artery in the community, bisecting the Tsawwassen region; it is the only road leading into the community of [[Point Roberts, Washington|Point Roberts]], south of the Canada\u2013US border.\n*Delta is also home to [[Boundary Bay Airport]], [[List of the busiest airports in Canada|Canada's seventh busiest airport by aircraft movements]]. Boundary Bay Airport is primarily used for private aircraft, commercial charters, and flying lessons.\n\n===Major highways===\n*{{jct|state=BC|BC|10}}\n*{{jct|state=BC|BC|17}}\n*{{jct|state=BC|BC|17A}}\n*{{jct|state=BC|BC|91}}\n*{{jct|state=BC|BC|99}}\n\n== Health ==\nDelta is the westernmost community served by [[Fraser Health|Fraser Health Authority]] which operates [[Delta Hospital]] in Ladner and also funds home and community care. The Delta Hospice Society operates a facility near to the hospital.\n\n== Education ==\n[[Delta Public Schools]] operates Anglophone public schools in the city.\n\nThe ''[[Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique]]'' operates one Francophone primary school in that city: ''\u00e9cole du Bois-joli''.<ref>\"[http://www.csf.bc.ca/ecoles/en-colombie-britannique/carte-des-ecoles/ Carte des \u00e9coles].\" ''[[Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique]]''.

Over 160 young people play [[ringette]] in Delta. The Delta Ringette Association has 13 teams in 2005.\nNotable professional sports players from Delta are [[Jeff Francis]] (MLB), [[James Paxton (baseball)|James Paxton]] (MLB), [[Justin Morneau]] (MLB), [[Brent Seabrook]] (NHL), [[Troy Brouwer]] (NHL) and [[Mitch Berger]] (NFL).\n[[File:TourdeDeltaAD.jpg|thumb|right|[[White Spot / Delta Road Race (men's race)|Tour de Delta]] wall cover on electrical box outside of Delta, British Columbia municipal hall]] Delta's unique and varying terrain provides a challenging test for many of the world's best cyclists in the Tour de Delta (one day races, for [[White Spot / Delta Road Race (men's race)|men]] since 2001, and for [[White Spot / Delta Road Race (women's race)|women]] since 2011). Since its first event in 2001, the Tour de Delta has grown to be Canada's largest cycling event, held annually in July as part of BC Superweek.\nThe Delta Triathlon is also a very popular event, selling out each year in April.
