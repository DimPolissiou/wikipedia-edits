The XV20 Camry range is split into different model codes indicative of the engine. [[Inline-four engine|Inline-four]] models utilize the SXV20 (gasoline) and SXV23 (CNG) codes, with MCV20 designating the [[V6 engine|six-cylinder (V6)]] versions.\n\nThe XV20 Camry continued as a sedan and station wagon, though the latter model was not sold in North America, where the sedan was launched in 1996 for the 1997 model year. The XV20 Camry was offered in 2.2-liter inline-four and 3.0-liter V6 engined versions. In Australia, the luxury-oriented version was badged '''Toyota Vienta'''.\n\nIn Japan, this model launched under the name Camry Gracia\u2014a prefix dropped by the sedan in 1999\u2014but retained by the wagon until end of production in 2001. An upmarket version of the wagon also sold as the '''Toyota Mark II Qualis'''. Furthermore, this was the first Camry to be [[badge-engineering|badge-engineered]] as a [[Daihatsu]]; the '''Daihatsu Altis''' sold in Japan was identical to the export version of the Camry. The Japanese [[Toyota Camry (XV10)|Scepter]] ceased to exist as the Japanese Camrys adopted the {{convert|1795|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide platform, thereby incurring an increased tax liability in Japan due to its extended length and width according to Japanese [[Vehicle size class#Japan|exterior dimension limits]]. The [[Toyota Camry#V50|Vista]] began departing from the Camry, remaining {{convert|1700|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide and eventually forming the basis of the growing Corolla. In addition, the Vista's sheet metal resembled a tall, formal sedan, while the Camry became sleeker. The [[Lexus ES#XV20|Lexus ES 300]] was again built from the Windom, which uses the Camry chassis.\n\nIn August 1999 for the 2000 model year, the sedan models in North America received a mid-model upgrade to the front and rear fascias, this included larger headlights that now feature a four-bulb system instead of two, a separated grille with chrome surround, larger taillights, and larger body-side moldings. Toyota Australia started production of the facelift model in 2000.\n\n== Development ==\nAs Japanese yen soared in the mid-1990s, the redesigned Camry had less content than the [[Toyota Camry (XV10)|previous model]] under pressure to reduce costs.<ref>{{cite news |first1=Mark |last1=Rechtin |first2=Ryan |last2=Beene |first3=Hans |last3=Greimel |date=2011-11-28 |url=http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20111128/OEM01/311289957/1292 |title=Japanese play the risky game of removing content |work=[[Automotive News]] |location=US |accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref> Following the debut of the XV10 in 1991, development immediately began under Kosaku Yamada under program code 415T.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.autonews.com/article/19940502/ANA/405020754/toyota-stresses-4-year-cycle-:31-new-models-in-next-3-years |title=Toyota stresses 4-year cycle : 31 new models in next 3 years |first=Richard |last=Johnson |work=Automotive News |location=US |date=1994-05-02 |access-date=2017-05-06}}</ref> Styling ended with a winning design competition proposal \"C\" by Kawazu Masahiko being chosen in August 1993, 36 months ahead of scheduled production.

The line-up of four-cylinder Camry models consisted of the CSi, Conquest and CSX models (automatic transmission was standard on Conquest and CSX); all three variants were available in sedan or wagon body styles. The Camry V6 models consisted of CSi and Conquest, again as sedans and wagons, with the wagons only available with automatic transmission. The Camry V6 Touring sedan model was launched in March 1999.\n\nThe Vienta V6 line up consisted of VXi and Grande sedans and the VXi wagon. The Vienta VXi was similarly equipped to the four-cylinder Camry CSX.\n\nIn September 2000, the revised Camry was launched. The Vienta V6 range was discontinued due to the launch of the [[Toyota Avalon#XX10|Avalon]] sedan in July 2000 and two new models were added to the Camry range: the top-of-the-range Azura V6 sedan and the Touring V6 wagon, both of which were available with an automatic transmission only. Towards the end of the model run, the limited edition Intrigue and Advantage sedans were launched.\n\nWheel sizes vary on this shape of Camry, with some using 14-inch wheels, while others use 15-inch.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Japan ===\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = 1997 Toyota Mark II Qualis 01.jpg \n| image2 = Toyota-mark2 qualis-rear.jpg\n| caption2 =Mark II Qualis (based on Camry wagon)\n}}\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = Toyota CAMRY GRACIA SEDAN 2.2 (SXV20) front.JPG\n| image2 = 1996-2001 Toyota Camry Gracia (XV20) sedan rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Camry Gracia\n}}\n\nThe Japanese market XV20s arrived in 1996, named Camry Gracia. Japanese sedans dropped the Gracia suffix in 1999, although it was retained by the wagon until its 2001 demise. The wagon was also sold in Japan as Toyota Mark II Qualis. It had no relation to the [[Toyota Mark II#X100|Mark II]] sedan (a rear-wheel drive executive car) besides the front and rear lights, which resembled those of the Mark II. The Mark II Qualis was also available in a 3.0G version, with the 3.0-liter V6 engine, not available on the Japanese market Camry. The Camry Gracia was sold only at Toyota Japanese dealerships called ''[[Toyota#Japan|Toyota Corolla Store]]'' alongside the Camry, while its twin the Mark II Qualis was exclusive to ''[[Toyota#Japan|Toyopet Store]]'' locations.\n\nAn equivalent model was launched as the Daihatsu Altis. It was only sold in Japan, and its production started from this generation. The Altis was introduced March 2000 as a flagship sedan for Daihatsu as a replacement for the [[Daihatsu Applause]]. Not very many Altis models were sold in Japan. This is because a typical Daihatsu is priced in the entry level pricing range, and the Altis was priced very similar to the comparable model Camry. The Altis was available with the 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine. Unlike the Camry, which is available as a sedan or wagon in Japan, the Altis sold only as a sedan. The name \"Altis\" is a variation of the word \"altitude\", implying a \"high elevation\" status as the top-level car for Daihatsu.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Middle East ===\nFor the Middle East market, the Camry was sourced from Australia. It was offered in three different trims as a sedan: the low-end XLI and mid-range GLI that both carried the four-cylinder engine\u2014and the luxury Grande with V6 engine. The station wagon was also offered with the GLI trim.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== North America ===\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = 1997-1999 Toyota Camry.jpg\n| caption1 = Pre-facelift Toyota Camry (US)\n| image2 = 2000-2001 Toyota Camry -- 07-04-2011.jpg\n| caption2 = Facelift Toyota Camry (US)\n}}\n\n[[File:Toyota camry interior.JPG|thumb|left|Interior]]\n\nIn the United States, the Camry SE was dropped and the base model was renamed the CE for the 1997 model year. Both the LE and the XLE trims were carried over from the previous generation. All trim levels were available with either the 2.2-liter inline-four or the 3.0-liter V6 engine. The LE-based Gallery Edition and Collector Edition were new for 2001 model year. Some of this generation Camry sold in the US were produced at TMMK as well as at the Tsutsumi plant in Japan. A Camry manufactured in Japan is denoted with a VIN starting with \"JT2\"; US-made models are denoted with a VIN starting with \"4T1\".\n\nManual transmissions were only available on the CE and LE V6 models. [[Toyota Racing Development]] (TRD) offered a supercharger kit for the V6 models, raising power to {{convert|247|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|242|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque.\n\nThe Camry had a mild refresh in August 1999 for the 2000 model year, and the addition of VVTi to the 2.2 litre 5S-FE engine.\n\nA coupe was added in 1998 for the 1999 model year, and then a convertible form in 1999 for the 2000 model year.

The XV20 Camry range is split into different model codes indicative of the engine. [[Inline-four engine|Inline-four]] models utilize the SXV20 (gasoline) and SXV23 (CNG) codes, with MCV20 designating the [[V6 engine|six-cylinder (V6)]] versions.\n\nThe XV20 Camry continued as a sedan and station wagon, though the latter model was not sold in North America, where the sedan was launched in 1996 for the 1997 model year. The XV20 Camry was offered in 2.2-liter inline-four and 3.0-liter V6 engined versions. In Australia, the luxury-oriented version was badged '''Toyota Vienta'''.\n\nIn Japan, this model launched under the name Camry Gracia\u2014a prefix dropped by the sedan in 1999\u2014but retained by the wagon until end of production in 2001. An upmarket version of the wagon also sold as the '''Toyota Mark II Qualis'''. Furthermore, this was the first Camry to be [[badge-engineering|badge-engineered]] as a [[Daihatsu]]; the '''Daihatsu Altis''' sold in Japan was identical to the export version of the Camry. The Japanese [[Toyota Camry (XV10)|Scepter]] ceased to exist as the Japanese Camrys adopted the {{convert|1795|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide platform, thereby incurring an increased tax liability in Japan due to its extended length and width according to Japanese [[Vehicle size class#Japan|exterior dimension limits]]. The [[Toyota Camry#V50|Vista]] began departing from the Camry, remaining {{convert|1700|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide and eventually forming the basis of the growing Corolla. In addition, the Vista's sheet metal resembled a tall, formal sedan, while the Camry became sleeker. The [[Lexus ES#XV20|Lexus ES 300]] was again built from the Windom, which uses the Camry chassis.\n\nIn August 1999 for the 2000 model year, the sedan models in North America received a mid-model upgrade to the front and rear fascias, this included larger headlights that now feature a four-bulb system instead of two, a separated grille with chrome surround, larger taillights, and larger body-side moldings. Toyota Australia started production of the facelift model in 2000.\n\n== Development ==\nAs Japanese yen soared in the mid-1990s, the redesigned Camry had less content than the [[Toyota Camry (XV10)|previous model]] under pressure to reduce costs.<ref>{{cite news |first1=Mark |last1=Rechtin |first2=Ryan |last2=Beene |first3=Hans |last3=Greimel |date=2011-11-28 |url=http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20111128/OEM01/311289957/1292 |title=Japanese play the risky game of removing content |work=[[Automotive News]] |location=US |accessdate=2014-04-29}}</ref> Following the debut of the XV10 in 1991, development immediately began under Kosaku Yamada under program code 415T.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.autonews.com/article/19940502/ANA/405020754/toyota-stresses-4-year-cycle-:31-new-models-in-next-3-years |title=Toyota stresses 4-year cycle : 31 new models in next 3 years |first=Richard |last=Johnson |work=Automotive News |location=US |date=1994-05-02 |access-date=2017-05-06}}</ref> Styling ended with a winning design competition proposal \"C\" by Kawazu Masahiko being chosen in August 1993, 36 months ahead of scheduled production.

Production in Thailand and Indonesia began in 1999, replacing Australia as the source of Camrys in Southeast Asia.\n\n=== Australia ===\n{{multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 200\n| image1 = 1997-2000 Toyota Camry (MCV20R) Conquest sedan (2016-07-07) 01.jpg | caption1 = Pre-facelift Toyota Camry Conquest sedan (MCV20R; Australia)\n| image2 =  1997-2000 Toyota Camry (SXV20R) CSi sedan (2015-10-18).jpg | caption2 = Pre-facelift Toyota Camry CSi sedan (SXV20R; Australia)\n}}\n\n{{multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 200\n| image1= 2002 Toyota Camry (SXV20R) Advantage sedan 01.jpg | caption1 = Facelift Toyota Camry Advantage sedan (SXV20R; Australia)\n| image2 = 2001 Toyota Camry (SXV20R) CSX sedan (2015-07-03) 02.jpg | caption2 = Facelift Toyota Camry CSX sedan (SXV20R; Australia)\n| image3 = 2000-2002 Toyota Camry (MCV20R) Conquest station wagon (2011-10-25).jpg | caption3 = Facelift Toyota Camry Conquest wagon (MCV20R; Australia)\n}}\n\nIn Australia, unlike the previous generation, the Camry name was also applied to the V6 variants, while the Toyota Vienta V6 range was revised as the \"upmarket\" models. The line-up of four-cylinder Camry models consisted of the CSi, Conquest and CSX models (automatic transmission was standard on Conquest and CSX); all three variants were available in sedan or wagon body styles. The Camry V6 models consisted of CSi and Conquest, again as sedans and wagons, with the wagons only available with automatic transmission. The Camry V6 Touring sedan model was launched in March 1999.\n\nThe Vienta V6 line up consisted of VXi and Grande sedans and the VXi wagon. The Vienta VXi was similarly equipped to the four-cylinder Camry CSX.\n\nIn September 2000, the revised Camry was launched. The Vienta V6 range was discontinued due to the launch of the [[Toyota Avalon#XX10|Avalon]] sedan in July 2000 and two new models were added to the Camry range: the top-of-the-range Azura V6 sedan and the Touring V6 wagon, both of which were available with an automatic transmission only. Towards the end of the model run, the limited edition Intrigue and Advantage sedans were launched.\n\nWheel sizes vary on this shape of Camry, with some using 14-inch wheels, while others use 15-inch.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Japan ===\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = 1997 Toyota Mark II Qualis 01.jpg \n| image2 = Toyota-mark2 qualis-rear.jpg\n| caption2 =Mark II Qualis (based on Camry wagon)\n}}\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = Toyota CAMRY GRACIA SEDAN 2.2 (SXV20) front.JPG\n| image2 = 1996-2001 Toyota Camry Gracia (XV20) sedan rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Camry Gracia\n}}\n\nThe Japanese market XV20s arrived in 1996, named Camry Gracia. Japanese sedans dropped the Gracia suffix in 1999, although it was retained by the wagon until its 2001 demise. The wagon was also sold in Japan as Toyota Mark II Qualis. It had no relation to the [[Toyota Mark II#X100|Mark II]] sedan (a rear-wheel drive executive car) besides the front and rear lights, which resembled those of the Mark II. The Mark II Qualis was also available in a 3.0G version, with the 3.0-liter V6 engine, not available on the Japanese market Camry. The Camry Gracia was sold only at Toyota Japanese dealerships called ''[[Toyota#Japan|Toyota Corolla Store]]'' alongside the Camry, while its twin the Mark II Qualis was exclusive to ''[[Toyota#Japan|Toyopet Store]]'' locations.\n\nAn equivalent model was launched as the Daihatsu Altis. It was only sold in Japan, and its production started from this generation. The Altis was introduced March 2000 as a flagship sedan for Daihatsu as a replacement for the [[Daihatsu Applause]]. Not very many Altis models were sold in Japan. This is because a typical Daihatsu is priced in the entry level pricing range, and the Altis was priced very similar to the comparable model Camry. The Altis was available with the 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine. Unlike the Camry, which is available as a sedan or wagon in Japan, the Altis sold only as a sedan. The name \"Altis\" is a variation of the word \"altitude\", implying a \"high elevation\" status as the top-level car for Daihatsu.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Middle East ===\nFor the Middle East market, the Camry was sourced from Australia. It was offered in three different trims as a sedan: the low-end XLI and mid-range GLI that both carried the four-cylinder engine\u2014and the luxury Grande with V6 engine. The station wagon was also offered with the GLI trim.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== North America ===\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = 1997-1999 Toyota Camry.jpg\n| caption1 = Pre-facelift Toyota Camry (US)\n| image2 = 2000-2001 Toyota Camry -- 07-04-2011.jpg\n| caption2 = Facelift Toyota Camry (US)\n}}\n\n[[File:Toyota camry interior.JPG|thumb|left|Interior]]\n\nIn the United States, the Camry SE was dropped and the base model was renamed the CE for the 1997 model year. Both the LE and the XLE trims were carried over from the previous generation. All trim levels were available with either the 2.2-liter inline-four or the 3.0-liter V6 engine. The LE-based Gallery Edition and Collector Edition were new for 2001 model year. Some of this generation Camry sold in the US were produced at TMMK as well as at the Tsutsumi plant in Japan. A Camry manufactured in Japan is denoted with a VIN starting with \"JT2\"; US-made models are denoted with a VIN starting with \"4T1\".\n\nManual transmissions were only available on the CE and LE V6 models. [[Toyota Racing Development]] (TRD) offered a supercharger kit for the V6 models, raising power to {{convert|247|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|242|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} of torque.\n\nThe Camry had a mild refresh in August 1999 for the 2000 model year, and the addition of VVTi to the 2.2 litre 5S-FE engine.\n\nA coupe was added in 1998 for the 1999 model year, and then a convertible form in 1999 for the 2000 model year. In contrast to the coupe from the third-generation Camrys, the new two-door cars were given a separate nameplate [[Toyota Camry Solara]], or simply Solara. They were also a significant styling departure from the sedan. The Solara was available in SE and SLE trims, corresponding roughly to the sedan's LE and XLE trims.\n\nToyota, in 1999, offered a four-cylinder, non-hybrid [[compressed natural gas|CNG]]-powered XV20 Camry in California to [[fleet vehicle|fleet]] customers.<ref>{{cite web |last=Johnson |first=Erik |date=November 2008 |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/car/08q4/toyota_camry_cng_hybrid_concept-auto_shows |title=Toyota Camry CNG Hybrid Concept \u2013 Auto Shows |work=[[Car and Driver]] |accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref>\n\n{{Euro NCAP |align=right |year=1998 |description=Camry 2.2 4-door saloon |reference_url=https://www.euroncap.com/en/results/toyota/camry/15493 |reference_name=euroncap1998 |adult_stars=4 |adult_score=25 |pedestrian_stars=2 |pedestrian_score=15 }}\n\nThe Camry V6 was again on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 1997.\n\nThe [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] gave the Camry a \"Good\" overall score in their frontal offset crash test.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=69 |title=Toyota Camry 1997\u20132001 models |publisher=[[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] |accessdate=2009-05-08}}</ref> Front seat-mounted [[Airbag#Side airbag|side torso airbags]] were optional beginning on 1999 models.\n\n=== Europe ===\nThe XV20 was also sold in Europe.

Following the discontinuation of the Excursion, Ford introduced the extended-length [[Ford Expedition#Expedition EL/Max|Ford Expedition EL/MAX]]; while matching the Chevrolet Suburban in terms of size, the Expedition EL/MAX shifted its chassis commonality from the Super Duty to the F-150.  As of current production, Ford has not produced another SUV derived from the Super Duty model line.  \n\nThroughout its production, the Ford Excursion was assembled at the [[Kentucky Truck Plant]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] alongside Super Duty pickup trucks; the final example was produced on September 30, 2005.\n\n==Origin==\nFor 1978, Ford introduced the second-generation [[Ford Bronco#Second generation (1978\u20131979)|Ford Bronco]].  To compete directly against the [[Chevrolet K5 Blazer|Chevrolet K5 Blazer/GMC Jimmy]] and [[Dodge Ramcharger]], the Bronco became a full-size SUV, adopting the chassis and powertrain of the F-100 pickup truck (lowering its production costs); continuing the most popular design of its predecessor, the second-generation Bronco was produced strictly as a three-door wagon (with a lift-off hardtop).      \n\nAfter the 1975 discontinuation of the [[International Harvester Travelall]], the Suburban became the sole full-size SUV produced in a four-door bodystyle (far larger than the [[Jeep Wagoneer (SJ)|Jeep Wagoneer]]).  During the 1980s and early 1990s, four-door Broncos were developed; in place of production vehicles, a limited number of license-built conversions (mating a Bronco body with F-Series crew cabs) were sold.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-american/curbside-classic-ford-classic-350-centurion-vehicles-creates-a-frankenstein-suburban-fighter/|title=Curbside Classic: Ford Classic 350 \u2013 Centurion Vehicles Creates A Frankenstein Suburban Fighter|last=Snitkoff|first=Edward|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160228070650/http://news.boldride.com/2015/11/ford-bronco-rare-centurion-classic/94489/|title=This is the 4-Door Ford Bronco You Didn\u2019t Know Existed|date=2016-02-28|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref>  Ford produced its first four-door SUV for 1991, as the [[Ford Explorer#First generation (1991\u20131994)|Ford Explorer]] replaced the [[Ford Bronco II|Bronco II]]; both model lines were derived from the compact [[Ford Ranger (Americas)|Ranger]] pickup truck.     \n\nFor 1997, the Ford Bronco was replaced by the [[Ford Expedition]]; coinciding with changing segment demands, the Expedition was offered solely as a five-door wagon.  While changing its body configuration, the Expedition retained model commonality with the F-Series with its Bronco predecessor.  Sized between the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]] and Suburban, the Expedition was fitted with three-row seating (offered by the Suburban).        \n\nFor 1999, Ford expanded the F-Series model range, with the F-250 and F-350 becoming the Super Duty series.  Intended for work usage and towing, Super Duty F-Series trucks received a heavier-duty chassis and suspension along with a distinct body design.  To compete against the 2500-series Suburban, Ford began development of a heavy-duty SUV derived from the F-250 Super Duty pickup truck.     \n\n==Design overview==\n\n===Chassis===\nThe Ford Excursion was produced sharing the platform architecture of the [[Ford Super Duty|F-250 Super Duty]] pickup truck. Sharing quite a bit of its chassis components and dimensions with the F-250 Super Cab, 8' Bed. The Excursion shares a common width, wheelbase, and front/rear track width with its F-250 counterpart. Other shared assemblies include the front and most of the rear suspension (the leaf springs and front spring hanger bracket were specific to the Excursion), along with the steering gear. From where the front sway bar mounts to the frame, back,is specific to the Excursion. And from this point back the frame is a little taller and much wider than its F-250 cousin.  The rear axle for all Excursions was a [[Sterling 10.5 axle]]. The [[four wheel drive]] models were equipped with a NV273 [[transfer case]] and [[Dana 50]] front axle. Gear ratios of 3:73 and 4:30 were offered.\n\nDuring the development of the chassis, Ford learned that its initial design caused smaller vehicles (such as a [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|Ford Taurus]]) to become severely overridden in a head-on collision. In the test, the tire of the Excursion drove up to the windshield of the Taurus (reducing the chance of survival for its driver).<ref name=\"bradsher\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/highmightydan00brad|url-access=registration|title=High and mighty: the dangerous rise of the SUV|last=Bradsher|first=Keith|publisher=PublicAffairs|year=2004|isbn=978-1-58648-203-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/highmightydan00brad/page/199 199]|accessdate=2012-06-12}}</ref>  As a response, Ford modified the chassis to include an under-bumper \"blocker beam\"; the device was initially tested by the French transportation ministry in 1971.<ref name=\"bradsher\" /> For the rear of the chassis, Ford chose to include a trailer hitch as standard equipment in production to reduce underriding in rear-end collisions by smaller vehicles.\n\n==== Powertrain ====\nDuring its entire production, the Excursion was offered with both gasoline and diesel engines.  The standard engine was a 5.4L Triton V8 with a 6.8L V10 offered as an option.  At its launch, the optional diesel engine was the Navistar-produced 7.3L Powerstroke V8; a 6.0L V8 was introduced during 2003, retaining the Powerstroke name.\n\nAll four engines were paired with an automatic transmission.  The 4-speed 4R100 automatic was fitted to the 5.4., 6.8, and 7.3L engines, with a 5-speed 5R110W automatic fitted to the 6.0L engine.  \n\nThough using the <big>\u00be</big>-ton chassis of the F-250, the Excursion was rated with a [[Gross vehicle weight rating|GVWR]] of {{convert|8900|lb|abbr=on}} when equipped with gasoline engines and {{convert|9200|lb|abbr=on}} with equipped with diesel engines.  As its GVWR was above {{convert|8500|lb|abbr=on|}}, the Excursion was exempt from EPA fuel economy ratings; reviewers cited fuel economy in the range of 12-15mpg with the V10 gasoline engine.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/vehicles/new/reviews/2000/lweitzman_ford_excursion_2000.html |title=The Ford Excursion, It doesn't get any Bigger |first=Larry |last=Weitzman |publisher=Theautochannel.com|year=2000 |accessdate=2012-09-17}}</ref>  While its GVWR exempted it from emissions standards applied to light-duty vehicles, Ford designed the powertrains of the Excursion to meet [[United States vehicle emission standards#Phase 1: 1994\u20131999|low-emissions vehicle]] (LEV) status.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.klik.com.my/item/story/479106/ford-excursion-makes-a-grand-debut|title=Ford Excursion makes a grand debut {{!}} KLiK|website=www.klik.com.my|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref>    \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Engine\n!Configuration\n!Fuel\n!Production\n!Horsepower output\n!Torque output\n!Transmission\n|-\n|Ford ''[[Ford Triton engine#5.4|Triton]] V8''\n|{{Convert|330|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} SOHC 2V V8\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Gasoline\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2000\u20132005\n|{{convert|255|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|350|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" |4-speed automatic\nFord [[Ford C6 transmission#4R100|4R100]]\n|-\n|Ford ''[[Ford Triton engine#6.8|Triton]] V10''\n|{{Convert|413|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} SOHC 2V V10\n|{{convert|310|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|425|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Ford/Navistar [[Ford Power Stroke engine#7.3|PowerStroke]] V8\n|{{Convert|444|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} OHV V8 turbo\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Diesel\n|2000\u20132003.5\n|{{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|525|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Ford/Navistar [[Ford Power Stroke engine#6.0 Power Stroke|PowerStroke]] V8\n|{{Convert|365|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} OHV 4V V8 turbo\n|2003.5-2005\n|{{convert|325|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|560|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|5-speed automatic\n\nFord 5R110W TorqShift<ref>2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 Ford Truck/SUV source books</ref>\n|}\n\n===Body design===\nWhile the Ford Expedition shared design influences from the popular Ford Explorer, the Excursion adopted a high degree of commonality from its F-250 Super Duty counterpart.  With the exception of its eggcrate grille (styled similar to the Ford Expedition and the third-generation Explorer), the front bodywork and two front doors are shared entirely with the Super Duty pickups, the rear doors are very similar to the Super Duty Crew Cab doors, but have more of a curve on the back side edge, thus being specific to the Excursion.  Styled similar to the Bronco (with flush-mounted glass), the Excursion is fitted with a third-row seat and rear cargo area behind the second-row door; dependent on configuration, the vehicle could accommodate to nine passengers.  In place of a conventional liftgate, the cargo door was configured as a 3-way design, pairing an upper liftgate with two lower dutch doors (similar to the 1992-2005 [[Chevrolet Astro]]); the taillamps were sourced from the E-Series van. \n\nDuring its production, the Excursion saw few major changes to its interior or exterior.  For 2002, the instrument panel was updated, receiving a digital odometer.  For 2005, the eggcrate grille was replaced by the three-bar grille used on Super Duty trucks.\n\nCoinciding with its design commonality with the Ford Super Duty crew cab, the Excursion is among one of the only mass-produced SUVs ever produced with four full-length passenger doors (along with the Expedition MAX and Lincoln Navigator L, the Chevrolet Suburban and its GMC and Cadillac counterparts, and the [[International Harvester Travelall|International Travelall]]).\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Ford Excursion, 12.

The base trim was XL (marketed nearly exclusively for fleet sales), XLT (standard trim in retail markets), and Limited (highest trim line). Following its use across many Ford light trucks, an Eddie Bauer trim package was introduced for the Excursion for 2003 (differing from the Limited primarily in appearance). \n\n'''XLT''': Included three rows of seating, leather-wrapped steering wheel with speed control, a security system, keyless entry, {{convert|16|inch|abbr=on|cm}} chrome steel rims or optional alloy rims, trailer towing, and an AM/FM radio with cassette and single-disc CD player with six premium speakers, and air conditioning.\n\n'''Limited''': Included same features as XLT, but adds a power driver's seat, rear audio controls, illuminated running boards, {{convert|16|in|abbr=on|cm}} alloy rims, front-speed sensitive windshield wipers, five power points, ten cupholders, heated front seats, leather seats, and an optional rear entertainment system with DVD player.\n\n==Reception==\nFor its 2000 model year launch, the Ford Excursion was described by [[Popular Science]] as the \"biggest sport utility on the planet.\"<ref>{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=RsHqYbQ6maEC&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=Ford+Excursion+is+the+biggest+sport-utility+on+the+planet |title=Big, bigger, biggest |journal=Popular Science |date=November 1999 |volume=255 |issue=5 |page=48 |accessdate=2012-09-07 }}</ref>  2000 would be the most successful model year for the Excursion, with nearly 69,000 examples sold.  After largely meeting sales projections at its launch<ref name=\":1\" />, demand for the model line was affected by the [[2000s energy crisis|energy crisis of the 2000s]].  While able to produce 70,000 examples yearly<ref name=\":1\" />, sales from 2001 onward struggled to reach half of that capacity, becoming the lowest-selling SUV sold by Ford or Lincoln-Mercury.      \n\nThe large size of the Excursion led to it being dubbed the ''Ford Valdez'' by [[Sierra Club|The Sierra Club]] in 1999 (in reference to the [[Exxon Valdez]] supertanker).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sdearthtimes.com/et0399/et0399s4.html|title=ET 3/99: Ford's new gas-guzzling SUV wins the \"Exxon Valdez\" award from the Sierra Club|website=www.sdearthtimes.com|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref>  In 2007, [[TIME Magazine]] selected it as one of the ''Fifty Worst Cars of All Time''.<ref name=\"time\">{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1658545_1658544_1658538,00.html|title=The 50 Worst Cars of All Time - TIME|date=2007-09-07|work=Time|access-date=2020-03-07|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n\n===F-250 Tropivan===\nFrom 1998 to 2012, a second-party SUV conversion of the Ford F-250 was sold in Brazil.<ref>{{cite web|title=Avalia\u00e7\u00e3o NA \u2013 F-250 Tropivan |url= https://www.noticiasautomotivas.com.br/avaliacao-na-f-250-tropivan/ |website=Not\u00edcias Automotivas |language=pt-BR |date=13 December 2010 |accessdate=11 November 2017}}</ref> Similar in design and layout to the Excursion, the F-250 Tropivan differed primarily in its being a second-party conversion (similar to the Centurion Classic). In contrast to the Excursion, two different wheelbases of the model were produced.\n\nAs with all Super Duty trucks in Brazil, the Tropivan had a different engine selection throughout its production run that included a 4.2&nbsp;L Essex gasoline V6 and two diesels: a 3.9&nbsp;L Cummins B-series and the 4.2&nbsp;L straight-6 MWM Sprint 6.07TCA.\n\n===Aftermarket===\nDuring and since its production, the Excursion has become a basis for several types of aftermarket vehicles.  As a result of its body commonality with the Super Duty model range, the bodywork of the Excursion led to aftermarket conversions of Ford medium-duty truck chassis (Ford F-650 and F-750) to SUVs; to accommodate the longer wheelbase, the body typically is fitted with an extra set of doors.  At the other end of the size scale, the [[Hennessey Performance Engineering#VelociRaptor SUV|Hennessey VelociRaptor SUV]] was created by mating the rear bodywork of the Excursion with the bodywork of the first-generation [[Ford Raptor]] (a practice similar to the creation of the 1990s Centurion Classic C350).  Other conversions involve fitting 2000-2005 Excursions with the front fascias of 2006-2016 Super Duty pickup trucks (as the Excursion shares its chassis with the F-250).   \n\nThe Excursion also served as a basis for stretch limousines; coinciding with its heavier-duty chassis, many examples were stretched (unofficially) longer than the 120-inch limit imposed by Ford on the Lincoln Town Car sedan.      \n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Ford Expedition SUV Limo (2783513262).jpg|Ford Excursion stretch limousine\nFile:ROCMP Ford Excursion limited Armored Car Display at CKS Memorial Hall Square 20140607a.jpg|Ford Excursion armored car in use by [[Republic of China Military Police]] (Taiwan)\nFile:Ford F650 4X4 Truck - Flickr - Highway Patrol Images.jpg|6-door Ford F-650 Super Duty SUV in Australia (Ford Excursion bodywork)\n</gallery>\n\n==Yearly U.S. sales==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Following the discontinuation of the Excursion, Ford introduced the extended-length [[Ford Expedition#Expedition EL/Max|Ford Expedition EL/MAX]]; while matching the Chevrolet Suburban in terms of size, the Expedition EL/MAX shifted its chassis commonality from the Super Duty to the F-150.  As of current production, Ford has not produced another SUV derived from the Super Duty model line.  \n\nThroughout its production, the Ford Excursion was assembled at the [[Kentucky Truck Plant]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] alongside Super Duty pickup trucks; the final example was produced on September 30, 2005.\n\n==Origin==\nFor 1978, Ford introduced the second-generation [[Ford Bronco#Second generation (1978\u20131979)|Ford Bronco]].  To compete directly against the [[Chevrolet K5 Blazer|Chevrolet K5 Blazer/GMC Jimmy]] and [[Dodge Ramcharger]], the Bronco became a full-size SUV, adopting the chassis and powertrain of the F-100 pickup truck (lowering its production costs); continuing the most popular design of its predecessor, the second-generation Bronco was produced strictly as a three-door wagon (with a lift-off hardtop).      \n\nAfter the 1975 discontinuation of the [[International Harvester Travelall]], the Suburban became the sole full-size SUV produced in a four-door bodystyle (far larger than the [[Jeep Wagoneer (SJ)|Jeep Wagoneer]]).  During the 1980s and early 1990s, four-door Broncos were developed; in place of production vehicles, a limited number of license-built conversions (mating a Bronco body with F-Series crew cabs) were sold.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-american/curbside-classic-ford-classic-350-centurion-vehicles-creates-a-frankenstein-suburban-fighter/|title=Curbside Classic: Ford Classic 350 \u2013 Centurion Vehicles Creates A Frankenstein Suburban Fighter|last=Snitkoff|first=Edward|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160228070650/http://news.boldride.com/2015/11/ford-bronco-rare-centurion-classic/94489/|title=This is the 4-Door Ford Bronco You Didn\u2019t Know Existed|date=2016-02-28|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref>  Ford produced its first four-door SUV for 1991, as the [[Ford Explorer#First generation (1991\u20131994)|Ford Explorer]] replaced the [[Ford Bronco II|Bronco II]]; both model lines were derived from the compact [[Ford Ranger (Americas)|Ranger]] pickup truck.     \n\nFor 1997, the Ford Bronco was replaced by the [[Ford Expedition]]; coinciding with changing segment demands, the Expedition was offered solely as a five-door wagon.  While changing its body configuration, the Expedition retained model commonality with the F-Series with its Bronco predecessor.  Sized between the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]] and Suburban, the Expedition was fitted with three-row seating (offered by the Suburban).        \n\nFor 1999, Ford expanded the F-Series model range, with the F-250 and F-350 becoming the Super Duty series.  Intended for work usage and towing, Super Duty F-Series trucks received a heavier-duty chassis and suspension along with a distinct body design.  To compete against the 2500-series Suburban, Ford began development of a heavy-duty SUV derived from the F-250 Super Duty pickup truck.     \n\n==Design overview==\n\n===Chassis===\nThe Ford Excursion was produced sharing the platform architecture of the [[Ford Super Duty|F-250 Super Duty]] pickup truck. Sharing quite a bit of its chassis components and dimensions with the F-250 Super Cab, 8' Bed. The Excursion shares a common width, wheelbase, and front/rear track width with its F-250 counterpart. Other shared assemblies include the front and most of the rear suspension (the leaf springs and front spring hanger bracket were specific to the Excursion), along with the steering gear. From where the front sway bar mounts to the frame, back,is specific to the Excursion. And from this point back the frame is a little taller and much wider than its F-250 cousin.  The rear axle for all Excursions was a [[Sterling 10.5 axle]]. The [[four wheel drive]] models were equipped with a NV273 [[transfer case]] and [[Dana 50]] front axle. Gear ratios of 3:73 and 4:30 were offered.\n\nDuring the development of the chassis, Ford learned that its initial design caused smaller vehicles (such as a [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|Ford Taurus]]) to become severely overridden in a head-on collision. In the test, the tire of the Excursion drove up to the windshield of the Taurus (reducing the chance of survival for its driver).<ref name=\"bradsher\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/highmightydan00brad|url-access=registration|title=High and mighty: the dangerous rise of the SUV|last=Bradsher|first=Keith|publisher=PublicAffairs|year=2004|isbn=978-1-58648-203-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/highmightydan00brad/page/199 199]|accessdate=2012-06-12}}</ref>  As a response, Ford modified the chassis to include an under-bumper \"blocker beam\"; the device was initially tested by the French transportation ministry in 1971.<ref name=\"bradsher\" /> For the rear of the chassis, Ford chose to include a trailer hitch as standard equipment in production to reduce underriding in rear-end collisions by smaller vehicles.\n\n==== Powertrain ====\nDuring its entire production, the Excursion was offered with both gasoline and diesel engines.  The standard engine was a 5.4L Triton V8 with a 6.8L V10 offered as an option.  At its launch, the optional diesel engine was the Navistar-produced 7.3L Powerstroke V8; a 6.0L V8 was introduced during 2003, retaining the Powerstroke name.\n\nAll four engines were paired with an automatic transmission.  The 4-speed 4R100 automatic was fitted to the 5.4., 6.8, and 7.3L engines, with a 5-speed 5R110W automatic fitted to the 6.0L engine.  \n\nThough using the <big>\u00be</big>-ton chassis of the F-250, the Excursion was rated with a [[Gross vehicle weight rating|GVWR]] of {{convert|8900|lb|abbr=on}} when equipped with gasoline engines and {{convert|9200|lb|abbr=on}} with equipped with diesel engines.  As its GVWR was above {{convert|8500|lb|abbr=on|}}, the Excursion was exempt from EPA fuel economy ratings; reviewers cited fuel economy in the range of 12-15mpg with the V10 gasoline engine.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/vehicles/new/reviews/2000/lweitzman_ford_excursion_2000.html |title=The Ford Excursion, It doesn't get any Bigger |first=Larry |last=Weitzman |publisher=Theautochannel.com|year=2000 |accessdate=2012-09-17}}</ref>  While its GVWR exempted it from emissions standards applied to light-duty vehicles, Ford designed the powertrains of the Excursion to meet [[United States vehicle emission standards#Phase 1: 1994\u20131999|low-emissions vehicle]] (LEV) status.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.klik.com.my/item/story/479106/ford-excursion-makes-a-grand-debut|title=Ford Excursion makes a grand debut {{!}} KLiK|website=www.klik.com.my|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref>    \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Engine\n!Configuration\n!Fuel\n!Production\n!Horsepower output\n!Torque output\n!Transmission\n|-\n|Ford ''[[Ford Triton engine#5.4|Triton]] V8''\n|{{Convert|330|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} SOHC 2V V8\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Gasoline\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2000\u20132005\n|{{convert|255|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|350|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" |4-speed automatic\nFord [[Ford C6 transmission#4R100|4R100]]\n|-\n|Ford ''[[Ford Triton engine#6.8|Triton]] V10''\n|{{Convert|413|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} SOHC 2V V10\n|{{convert|310|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|425|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Ford/Navistar [[Ford Power Stroke engine#7.3|PowerStroke]] V8\n|{{Convert|444|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} OHV V8 turbo\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Diesel\n|2000\u20132003.5\n|{{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|525|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Ford/Navistar [[Ford Power Stroke engine#6.0 Power Stroke|PowerStroke]] V8\n|{{Convert|365|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} OHV 4V V8 turbo\n|2003.5-2005\n|{{convert|325|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|560|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|5-speed automatic\n\nFord 5R110W TorqShift<ref>2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 Ford Truck/SUV source books</ref>\n|}\n\n===Body design===\nWhile the Ford Expedition shared design influences from the popular Ford Explorer, the Excursion adopted a high degree of commonality from its F-250 Super Duty counterpart.  With the exception of its eggcrate grille (styled similar to the Ford Expedition and the third-generation Explorer), the front bodywork and two front doors are shared entirely with the Super Duty pickups, the rear doors are very similar to the Super Duty Crew Cab doors, but have more of a curve on the back side edge, thus being specific to the Excursion.  Styled similar to the Bronco (with flush-mounted glass), the Excursion is fitted with a third-row seat and rear cargo area behind the second-row door; dependent on configuration, the vehicle could accommodate to nine passengers.  In place of a conventional liftgate, the cargo door was configured as a 3-way design, pairing an upper liftgate with two lower dutch doors (similar to the 1992-2005 [[Chevrolet Astro]]); the taillamps were sourced from the E-Series van. \n\nDuring its production, the Excursion saw few major changes to its interior or exterior.  For 2002, the instrument panel was updated, receiving a digital odometer.  For 2005, the eggcrate grille was replaced by the three-bar grille used on Super Duty trucks.\n\nCoinciding with its design commonality with the Ford Super Duty crew cab, the Excursion is among one of the only mass-produced SUVs ever produced with four full-length passenger doors (along with the Expedition MAX and Lincoln Navigator L, the Chevrolet Suburban and its GMC and Cadillac counterparts, and the [[International Harvester Travelall|International Travelall]]).\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Ford Excursion, 12.

The base trim was XL (marketed nearly exclusively for fleet sales), XLT (standard trim in retail markets), and Limited (highest trim line). Following its use across many Ford light trucks, an Eddie Bauer trim package was introduced for the Excursion for 2003 (differing from the Limited primarily in appearance). \n\n'''XLT''': Included three rows of seating, leather-wrapped steering wheel with speed control, a security system, keyless entry, {{convert|16|inch|abbr=on|cm}} chrome steel rims or optional alloy rims, trailer towing, and an AM/FM radio with cassette and single-disc CD player with six premium speakers, and air conditioning.\n\n'''Limited''': Included same features as XLT, but adds a power driver's seat, rear audio controls, illuminated running boards, {{convert|16|in|abbr=on|cm}} alloy rims, front-speed sensitive windshield wipers, five power points, ten cupholders, heated front seats, leather seats, and an optional rear entertainment system with DVD player.\n\n==Reception==\nFor its 2000 model year launch, the Ford Excursion was described by [[Popular Science]] as the \"biggest sport utility on the planet.\"<ref>{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=RsHqYbQ6maEC&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=Ford+Excursion+is+the+biggest+sport-utility+on+the+planet |title=Big, bigger, biggest |journal=Popular Science |date=November 1999 |volume=255 |issue=5 |page=48 |accessdate=2012-09-07 }}</ref>  2000 would be the most successful model year for the Excursion, with nearly 69,000 examples sold.  After largely meeting sales projections at its launch<ref name=\":1\" />, demand for the model line was affected by the [[2000s energy crisis|energy crisis of the 2000s]].  While able to produce 70,000 examples yearly<ref name=\":1\" />, sales from 2001 onward struggled to reach half of that capacity, becoming the lowest-selling SUV sold by Ford or Lincoln-Mercury.      \n\nThe large size of the Excursion led to it being dubbed the ''Ford Valdez'' by [[Sierra Club|The Sierra Club]] in 1999 (in reference to the [[Exxon Valdez]] supertanker).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sdearthtimes.com/et0399/et0399s4.html|title=ET 3/99: Ford's new gas-guzzling SUV wins the \"Exxon Valdez\" award from the Sierra Club|website=www.sdearthtimes.com|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref>  In 2007, [[TIME Magazine]] selected it as one of the ''Fifty Worst Cars of All Time''.<ref name=\"time\">{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1658545_1658544_1658538,00.html|title=The 50 Worst Cars of All Time - TIME|date=2007-09-07|work=Time|access-date=2020-03-07|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n\n===F-250 Tropivan===\nFrom 1998 to 2012, a second-party SUV conversion of the Ford F-250 was sold in Brazil.<ref>{{cite web|title=Avalia\u00e7\u00e3o NA \u2013 F-250 Tropivan |url= https://www.noticiasautomotivas.com.br/avaliacao-na-f-250-tropivan/ |website=Not\u00edcias Automotivas |language=pt-BR |date=13 December 2010 |accessdate=11 November 2017}}</ref> Similar in design and layout to the Excursion, the F-250 Tropivan differed primarily in its being a second-party conversion (similar to the Centurion Classic). In contrast to the Excursion, two different wheelbases of the model were produced.\n\nAs with all Super Duty trucks in Brazil, the Tropivan had a different engine selection throughout its production run that included a 4.2&nbsp;L Essex gasoline V6 and two diesels: a 3.9&nbsp;L Cummins B-series and the 4.2&nbsp;L straight-6 MWM Sprint 6.07TCA.\n\n===Aftermarket===\nDuring and since its production, the Excursion has become a basis for several types of aftermarket vehicles.  As a result of its body commonality with the Super Duty model range, the bodywork of the Excursion led to aftermarket conversions of Ford medium-duty truck chassis (Ford F-650 and F-750) to SUVs; to accommodate the longer wheelbase, the body typically is fitted with an extra set of doors.  At the other end of the size scale, the [[Hennessey Performance Engineering#VelociRaptor SUV|Hennessey VelociRaptor SUV]] was created by mating the rear bodywork of the Excursion with the bodywork of the first-generation [[Ford Raptor]] (a practice similar to the creation of the 1990s Centurion Classic C350).  Other conversions involve fitting 2000-2005 Excursions with the front fascias of 2006-2016 Super Duty pickup trucks (as the Excursion shares its chassis with the F-250).   \n\nThe Excursion also served as a basis for stretch limousines; coinciding with its heavier-duty chassis, many examples were stretched (unofficially) longer than the 120-inch limit imposed by Ford on the Lincoln Town Car sedan.      \n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Ford Expedition SUV Limo (2783513262).jpg|Ford Excursion stretch limousine\nFile:ROCMP Ford Excursion limited Armored Car Display at CKS Memorial Hall Square 20140607a.jpg|Ford Excursion armored car in use by [[Republic of China Military Police]] (Taiwan)\nFile:Ford F650 4X4 Truck - Flickr - Highway Patrol Images.jpg|6-door Ford F-650 Super Duty SUV in Australia (Ford Excursion bodywork)\n</gallery>\n\n==Yearly U.S. sales==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He was the son of William Henry Merrill (1840\u20131907), an editorial writer of the ''Boston Herald'', and Flora Agnes Judd (1842\u20131880).  He graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1889.   In 1897 he married Bessie A Henderson (1872\u20131956); they had five children.   He was a member of the Midday and University clubs of Chicago and of the Sigma Chi college fraternity.   He died on 17 September 1923 at the Presbyterian Hospital in Chicago, Illinois.   His burial was held at the Merrill Plot at Warsaw Cemetery in Warsaw, Wyoming County, New York.   \n\n== Career ==\nMerrill began his professional career as an electrical engineer in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].   In 1893, he was sent to Chicago, Illinois, to investigate the World's Fair Palace of Electricity.   He was hired by insurers for the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] to examine the safety of the electrical wiring in the Palace of Electricity.   This experience led him to eventually found the Underwriter's Electrical Bureau in 1894,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ul.com/aboutul/history/|title=History {{!}} UL|date=2014-08-01|work=UL|access-date=2017-08-18|language=en-US}}</ref> which later became [[Underwriters Laboratories]] in 1903.

He was the son of William Henry Merrill (1840\u20131907), an editorial writer of the ''Boston Herald'', and Flora Agnes Judd (1842\u20131880).  He graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1889.   In 1897 he married Bessie A Henderson (1872\u20131956); they had five children.   He was a member of the Midday and University clubs of Chicago and of the Sigma Chi college fraternity.   He died on 17 September 1923 at the Presbyterian Hospital in Chicago, Illinois.   His burial was held at the Merrill Plot at Warsaw Cemetery in Warsaw, Wyoming County, New York.   \n\n== Career ==\nMerrill began his professional career as an electrical engineer in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].   In 1893, he was sent to Chicago, Illinois, to investigate the World's Fair Palace of Electricity.   He was hired by insurers for the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] to examine the safety of the electrical wiring in the Palace of Electricity.

Its population was 4,422 in the 2016 census.<ref name=cso2016/> The town gives its name to the [[ecclesiastical province]] of ''Cashel''. Additionally, the ''[[cathedra]]'' of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly]] was originally in the town prior to the [[English Reformation]]. It is part of the parish of Cashel and Rosegreen in the same archdiocese.<ref>[http://www.cashel-emly.ie/main/parishes/cashel.htm Parish of Cashel and Rosegreen, diosesan website.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928202003/http://www.cashel-emly.ie/main/parishes/cashel.htm |date=28 September 2010 }}</ref> One of the six cathedrals of the [[Anglican]] [[Bishop of Cashel and Ossory]], who currently resides in [[Kilkenny]], is located in the town.

Prior to the construction of the motorway by-pass (in 2004), the town was noted as a bottleneck on the N8 Dublin to Cork [[roads in Ireland#National Primary Routes|route]].\n\n===Bus services===\n[[Bus \u00c9ireann]] operates an expressway service (route X8) between Dublin and Cork which calls at Cashel. [[Bus \u00c9ireann]] route 128X provides a link to [[Portlaoise]] via [[Urlingford]]. The Shamrock Bus Company operates a [[Thurles]] to [[Clonmel]] route via Cashel.\n\n===Rail services===\nCashel used to be served by a railway, the [[Cashel Extension Railway| Cashel spur line]], which is now closed. The nearest railway station is [[Cahir railway station|Cahir]], 17 kilometers away. This station is on an infrequently serviced line, but is useful if travelling east to/from [[Waterford]]. The  most convenient and frequently serviced rail station for Cashel is [[Thurles railway station|Thurles]] as this is on the Dublin-Cork InterCity rail line.\n\n===Airports===\nThe nearest airports are [[Cork Airport]] and [[Shannon Airport]], both of which are around 80&nbsp;km away. [[Dublin Airport]] is located 150&nbsp;km away,\n\n==History==\n\n===Ancient history===\nThe [[Rock of Cashel]], to which the town below owes its origin, is an isolated elevation of stratified [[limestone]], rising abruptly from a broad and fertile plain called the [[Golden Vale]]. The top of this eminence is crowned by a group of remarkable ruins.  Originally known as Fairy Hill, or Sid-Druim, the Rock was, in pagan times, the ''dun'', or castle, of the ancient Eoghnacht Chiefs of Munster. In Gaelic, ''Caiseal'' denotes a circular stone fort and is the name of several places in Ireland. The \"Book of Rights\" suggests the name is derived from ''Cais-il'', i.e. \"tribute stone\", because the Munster tribes paid tribute on the Rock. Here Corc, grandfather of Aengus Mac Natfraich, erected a fort. Cashel subsequently became the capital of Munster and, like [[Hill of Tara|Tara]] and [[Armagh]], it was a celebrated court. At the time of St.&nbsp;Patrick, when Aengus ruled as king, Cashel claimed supremacy over all the royal duns of the province.\n\nIn the 5th century, the [[E\u00f3ganachta]] dynasty founded their capital on and around the rock. Many kings of Munster have reigned here since. [[Saint Patrick]] is believed to have baptised Cashel's third king, Aengus. In 977 the [[D\u00e1l gCais]] usurper, [[Brian Boru]], was crowned here as the first non-E\u00f3ghanacht king of Cashel and Munster in over five hundred years. In 1101 his great-grandson, King [[Muirchertach Ua Briain]], gave the place to the [[bishop of Limerick]], thus denying it forever to the MacCarthys, the senior branch of the E\u00f3ganachta. The bishops had a famous school in Cashel and sent priests all over the continent, especially to [[Regensburg]] in Germany, where they maintained their own monastery, called [[Scots Monastery, Regensburg|Scots Monastery]].\n\n===Lordship of Ireland===\nThe Synod of Cashel of 1172 was organised by [[Henry II of England]]. The Synod sought to regulate some affairs of the Church in Ireland and to condemn some abuses, bringing the Church more into alignment with the [[Roman Rite]]. It has been suggested that the seventh act of the Synod called upon the clergy and people of Ireland to acknowledge [[Henry II of England]] as their king.<ref>{{cite book|last=McCormick|first=Stephen J.|authorlink=S. J. McCormick|title=The Pope and Ireland |url=https://archive.org/details/popeirelandconta00mccoiala|publisher=A. Waldteufel|location=San Francisco|year=1889|page=[https://archive.org/details/popeirelandconta00mccoiala/page/54 54]}}</ref> However, a careful reading of the [[Synod of Cashel#The seventh act|seventh act]] would not support this interpretation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Todd|first=William Gouan|title=A History of the ancient church in Ireland|page=Chapter XII}}</ref> Nevertheless, there is little doubt that the King's purpose in requiring the convocation was to overawe the Irish clergy with a display of his power; no doubt he succeeded in this. In this scenario, the convocation would be viewed as a pretext for the show of strength.\n\n[[St. Dominic's Abbey]], a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monastery, was established in 1243.\nOn 30 December 1640, Cashel was captured by an Irish force under Pilib \u00d3 Dubhuir (died 1648) of Dundrum and his brother Donnchadh \u00d3 Dubhuir (hanged in 1652). They took prisoner 300 members of the  English garrison and inhabitants. The following day, 15 prisoners were killed as revenge for earlier atrocities against the Irish; however, this was against \u00d3 Dubhuir's orders.  In 1647, during the [[Irish Confederate Wars]], the town was [[Sack of Cashel|stormed and sacked]] by English Parliamentarian troops under the [[Murrough O'Brien, 1st Earl of Inchiquin|6th Baron Inchiquin]] (later created the 1st [[Earl of Inchiquin]]). Over 1,000 [[Irish Catholic]] soldiers and civilians, including several prominent clerics, were killed in the attack and ensuing massacre.\n\n===Ecclesiastical history===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Archbishopric of Cashel]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] -->\n[[File:Cashel.JPG|thumb|Rock of Cashel]]\nAbout 450, Saint Patrick preached at the royal ''dun'' and converted king [[Aengus]]. The ''Tripartite Life'' of the saint relates that while \"he was baptising Aengus the spike of the [[crozier]] went through the foot of the King\" who bore with the painful wound in the belief \"that it was a rite of the Faith\". According to the same authority, twenty-seven kings of the race of Aengus and his brother Aillil ruled in Cashel until 897, when [[Cerm-gecan]] was slain in battle. There is no evidence that St Patrick founded a church at Cashel, or appointed a Bishop of Cashel. [[Ailbe|St Ailbe]], it is supposed, had already fixed his see at [[Emly]], not far off, and within the king's dominions. Cashel continued to be the chief residence of the Kings of Munster until 1100, hence its title, \"City of the Kings\". Before that date, there was no mention in the native annals of any Bishop, or Archbishop of Cashel. [[Cormac MacCullinan]] is referred to, but not correctly, as Archbishop of Cashel, by later writers. He was a bishop, but not of Cashel, where he was king. The most famous man in Ireland of his time, but more of a scholar and warrior than an ecclesiastic, Cormac has left us a glossary of Irish names, which displays his knowledge of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and the \"Psalter of Cashel\", a work treating of the history and antiquities of Ireland. He was slain in 903, in a great battle near Carlow.\n\n[[Brian Boru]] ([[Old Irish]]: ''Brian B\u00f3ruma'') fortified Cashel in 990. Murtagh O'Brien, King of Cashel, in presence of the chiefs and clergy, made a grant in 1101 of the \"Rock\" with the territory around it to O'Dunan, \"noble bishop and chief senior of Munster\", and dedicated it to God and St. Patrick. Then Cashel became an archiepiscopal see, and O'Dunan its first prelate as far as the [[primate (bishop)|primate]], [[St. Celsus]], could appoint him. At the [[synod of Kells]], 1152, [[Cardinal Paparo]] gave a [[pallium]] to [[Donat O'Lonergan]] of Cashel, and since then his successors have ruled the ecclesiastical province of Munster. In 1127 [[Cormac III of Munster]], King of Desmond, erected close to his palace on the \"Rock\" a church, now known as Cormac's Chapel, which was consecrated in 1134, when a synod was held within its walls. During the episcopate of Donal O'Hullican (1158\u20131182), the [[King of Limerick]], [[Domnall Mor O'Brien|Domnall O'Brien]], built in 1169 a more spacious church beside Cormac's Chapel, which then became a [[chapter house|chapterhouse]].\n\nMaurice, a Geraldine, filled the see from 1504 to 1523, and was succeeded by Edmund Butler, prior of [[Athassal]] Abbey, who was a natural son of Pierce, Earl of Ormond. In addition to the wars between the Irish and the English there arose a new element of discord, the Anglican Reformation introduced by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII Tudor]]. While residing at Kilmeaden Castle Archbishop Butler levied black-mail on the traders of the [[Suir]], robbing their boats and holding their persons for ransom. At a session of the royal [[privy council]] held at [[Clonmel]] in 1539, he swore to uphold the spiritual supremacy of the king and denied the power in Ireland of the Bishop of Rome. He died 1550 and was buried in the cathedral.\n\n=== Post Reformation ===\nRoland, a Geraldine (1553\u20131561), was created archbishop by the Roman Catholic English [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]]. After a vacancy of six years, Maurice FitzGibbon (1567\u20131578), a [[Cistercian]] abbot, was promoted to the archbishopric by [[Pope Pius V]], but James [[McCaul#Reformation and Dissolution|MacCaghwell]] (McCawell) was put forward by [[Elizabeth I of England]]. Thus began the Anglican religion at Cashel. FitzGibbon, who belonged to the royal Desmond family, being deprived of his see, fled to France and passed into Spain where he resided for a time at the Court. He conferred with the English ambassador at Paris to obtain pardon for leaving the country without the Queen's sanction, and to get permission to return. In this he failed, and going back to Ireland secretly he was arrested and imprisoned at Cork, where he died in 1578. On the death of MacCaghwell, Elizabeth advanced [[Miler MacGrath]], a [[Franciscan]] and [[Bishop of Down]], to the [[See of Cashel]]. He held at the same time four bishoprics and several [[benefice]]s, out of which he provided for his numerous offspring. Having occupied the see for fifty-two years, he died in 1622. His monument in the ruined cathedral bears an epitaph written by himself.\n\n[[Dermot O'Hurley]], or Diarmaid \u00d3 hUrthuile, of Limerick, a distinguished student of the [[Old University of Leuven|university of Louvain]] in the [[Duchy of Brabant]] and professor at [[Reims]] in France, was appointed Archbishop of Cashel in 1581 by Pope [[Gregory XIII]]. Having presided over the Roman Catholic diocese secretly for two years, he was discovered and brought before the [[Lord Justice]]s at Dublin, was tortured upon his refusal to take the [[Oath of Supremacy]] to the English crown and was subsequently hanged outside the city on 20 June, 1584.\n\n[[File:Huge crowd gathered at Cashel, Co. Tipperary for Corpus Christi procession (5785927872).jpg|thumb|Celebration of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] at Rock of Cashel c. 1922]]\nDr Butler 2nd (1774\u20131791), on being appointed to the Roman Catholic diocese, settled in [[Thurles]], where the Roman Catholic archbishops since then have resided. His successor, Archbishop Bray (1792\u20131820), built a large church in the early part of the 19th century, on the site of which Archbishop [[Patrick Leahy (bishop)|Patrick Leahy]] (1857\u20131874) erected a splendid cathedral in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style. It was completed and consecrated in 1879 by [[Thomas Croke|Archbishop Croke]] (1874\u20131902) and dedicated to [[Our Lady of the Assumption]].\n\nSt Albert (feast 8 January), a reputed former bishop, is the [[patron saint]] of the Roman Catholic diocese. The Archbishop of Cashel is Administrator of the ancient Diocese of Emly.\n\nThe Anglican archbishopric was reduced in status by legislation of 1833 and the bishopric combined initially with Waterford.

Its population was 4,422 in the 2016 census.<ref name=cso2016/> The town gives its name to the [[ecclesiastical province]] of ''Cashel''. Additionally, the ''[[cathedra]]'' of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly]] was originally in the town prior to the [[English Reformation]]. It is part of the parish of Cashel and Rosegreen in the same archdiocese.<ref>[http://www.cashel-emly.ie/main/parishes/cashel.htm Parish of Cashel and Rosegreen, diosesan website.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928202003/http://www.cashel-emly.ie/main/parishes/cashel.htm |date=28 September 2010 }}</ref> One of the six cathedrals of the [[Anglican]] [[Bishop of Cashel and Ossory]], who currently resides in [[Kilkenny]], is located in the town.

Prior to the construction of the motorway by-pass (in 2004), the town was noted as a bottleneck on the N8 Dublin to Cork [[roads in Ireland#National Primary Routes|route]].\n\n===Bus services===\n[[Bus \u00c9ireann]] operates an expressway service (route X8) between Dublin and Cork which calls at Cashel. [[Bus \u00c9ireann]] route 128X provides a link to [[Portlaoise]] via [[Urlingford]]. The Shamrock Bus Company operates a [[Thurles]] to [[Clonmel]] route via Cashel.\n\n===Rail services===\nCashel used to be served by a railway, the [[Cashel Extension Railway| Cashel spur line]], which is now closed. The nearest railway station is [[Cahir railway station|Cahir]], 17 kilometers away. This station is on an infrequently serviced line, but is useful if travelling east to/from [[Waterford]]. The  most convenient and frequently serviced rail station for Cashel is [[Thurles railway station|Thurles]] as this is on the Dublin-Cork InterCity rail line.\n\n===Airports===\nThe nearest airports are [[Cork Airport]] and [[Shannon Airport]], both of which are around 80&nbsp;km away. [[Dublin Airport]] is located 150&nbsp;km away,\n\n==History==\n\n===Ancient history===\nThe [[Rock of Cashel]], to which the town below owes its origin, is an isolated elevation of stratified [[limestone]], rising abruptly from a broad and fertile plain called the [[Golden Vale]]. The top of this eminence is crowned by a group of remarkable ruins.  Originally known as Fairy Hill, or Sid-Druim, the Rock was, in pagan times, the ''dun'', or castle, of the ancient Eoghnacht Chiefs of Munster. In Gaelic, ''Caiseal'' denotes a circular stone fort and is the name of several places in Ireland. The \"Book of Rights\" suggests the name is derived from ''Cais-il'', i.e. \"tribute stone\", because the Munster tribes paid tribute on the Rock. Here Corc, grandfather of Aengus Mac Natfraich, erected a fort. Cashel subsequently became the capital of Munster and, like [[Hill of Tara|Tara]] and [[Armagh]], it was a celebrated court. At the time of St.&nbsp;Patrick, when Aengus ruled as king, Cashel claimed supremacy over all the royal duns of the province.\n\nIn the 5th century, the [[E\u00f3ganachta]] dynasty founded their capital on and around the rock. Many kings of Munster have reigned here since. [[Saint Patrick]] is believed to have baptised Cashel's third king, Aengus. In 977 the [[D\u00e1l gCais]] usurper, [[Brian Boru]], was crowned here as the first non-E\u00f3ghanacht king of Cashel and Munster in over five hundred years. In 1101 his great-grandson, King [[Muirchertach Ua Briain]], gave the place to the [[bishop of Limerick]], thus denying it forever to the MacCarthys, the senior branch of the E\u00f3ganachta. The bishops had a famous school in Cashel and sent priests all over the continent, especially to [[Regensburg]] in Germany, where they maintained their own monastery, called [[Scots Monastery, Regensburg|Scots Monastery]].\n\n===Lordship of Ireland===\nThe Synod of Cashel of 1172 was organised by [[Henry II of England]]. The Synod sought to regulate some affairs of the Church in Ireland and to condemn some abuses, bringing the Church more into alignment with the [[Roman Rite]]. It has been suggested that the seventh act of the Synod called upon the clergy and people of Ireland to acknowledge [[Henry II of England]] as their king.<ref>{{cite book|last=McCormick|first=Stephen J.|authorlink=S. J. McCormick|title=The Pope and Ireland |url=https://archive.org/details/popeirelandconta00mccoiala|publisher=A. Waldteufel|location=San Francisco|year=1889|page=[https://archive.org/details/popeirelandconta00mccoiala/page/54 54]}}</ref> However, a careful reading of the [[Synod of Cashel#The seventh act|seventh act]] would not support this interpretation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Todd|first=William Gouan|title=A History of the ancient church in Ireland|page=Chapter XII}}</ref> Nevertheless, there is little doubt that the King's purpose in requiring the convocation was to overawe the Irish clergy with a display of his power; no doubt he succeeded in this. In this scenario, the convocation would be viewed as a pretext for the show of strength.\n\n[[St. Dominic's Abbey]], a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monastery, was established in 1243.\nOn 30 December 1640, Cashel was captured by an Irish force under Pilib \u00d3 Dubhuir (died 1648) of Dundrum and his brother Donnchadh \u00d3 Dubhuir (hanged in 1652). They took prisoner 300 members of the  English garrison and inhabitants. The following day, 15 prisoners were killed as revenge for earlier atrocities against the Irish; however, this was against \u00d3 Dubhuir's orders.  In 1647, during the [[Irish Confederate Wars]], the town was [[Sack of Cashel|stormed and sacked]] by English Parliamentarian troops under the [[Murrough O'Brien, 1st Earl of Inchiquin|6th Baron Inchiquin]] (later created the 1st [[Earl of Inchiquin]]). Over 1,000 [[Irish Catholic]] soldiers and civilians, including several prominent clerics, were killed in the attack and ensuing massacre.\n\n===Ecclesiastical history===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Archbishopric of Cashel]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] -->\n[[File:Cashel.JPG|thumb|Rock of Cashel]]\nAbout 450, Saint Patrick preached at the royal ''dun'' and converted king [[Aengus]]. The ''Tripartite Life'' of the saint relates that while \"he was baptising Aengus the spike of the [[crozier]] went through the foot of the King\" who bore with the painful wound in the belief \"that it was a rite of the Faith\". According to the same authority, twenty-seven kings of the race of Aengus and his brother Aillil ruled in Cashel until 897, when [[Cerm-gecan]] was slain in battle. There is no evidence that St Patrick founded a church at Cashel, or appointed a Bishop of Cashel. [[Ailbe|St Ailbe]], it is supposed, had already fixed his see at [[Emly]], not far off, and within the king's dominions. Cashel continued to be the chief residence of the Kings of Munster until 1100, hence its title, \"City of the Kings\". Before that date, there was no mention in the native annals of any Bishop, or Archbishop of Cashel. [[Cormac MacCullinan]] is referred to, but not correctly, as Archbishop of Cashel, by later writers. He was a bishop, but not of Cashel, where he was king. The most famous man in Ireland of his time, but more of a scholar and warrior than an ecclesiastic, Cormac has left us a glossary of Irish names, which displays his knowledge of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and the \"Psalter of Cashel\", a work treating of the history and antiquities of Ireland. He was slain in 903, in a great battle near Carlow.\n\n[[Brian Boru]] ([[Old Irish]]: ''Brian B\u00f3ruma'') fortified Cashel in 990. Murtagh O'Brien, King of Cashel, in presence of the chiefs and clergy, made a grant in 1101 of the \"Rock\" with the territory around it to O'Dunan, \"noble bishop and chief senior of Munster\", and dedicated it to God and St. Patrick. Then Cashel became an archiepiscopal see, and O'Dunan its first prelate as far as the [[primate (bishop)|primate]], [[St. Celsus]], could appoint him. At the [[synod of Kells]], 1152, [[Cardinal Paparo]] gave a [[pallium]] to [[Donat O'Lonergan]] of Cashel, and since then his successors have ruled the ecclesiastical province of Munster. In 1127 [[Cormac III of Munster]], King of Desmond, erected close to his palace on the \"Rock\" a church, now known as Cormac's Chapel, which was consecrated in 1134, when a synod was held within its walls. During the episcopate of Donal O'Hullican (1158\u20131182), the [[King of Limerick]], [[Domnall Mor O'Brien|Domnall O'Brien]], built in 1169 a more spacious church beside Cormac's Chapel, which then became a [[chapter house|chapterhouse]].\n\nMaurice, a Geraldine, filled the see from 1504 to 1523, and was succeeded by Edmund Butler, prior of [[Athassal]] Abbey, who was a natural son of Pierce, Earl of Ormond. In addition to the wars between the Irish and the English there arose a new element of discord, the Anglican Reformation introduced by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII Tudor]]. While residing at Kilmeaden Castle Archbishop Butler levied black-mail on the traders of the [[Suir]], robbing their boats and holding their persons for ransom. At a session of the royal [[privy council]] held at [[Clonmel]] in 1539, he swore to uphold the spiritual supremacy of the king and denied the power in Ireland of the Bishop of Rome. He died 1550 and was buried in the cathedral.\n\n=== Post Reformation ===\nRoland, a Geraldine (1553\u20131561), was created archbishop by the Roman Catholic English [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]]. After a vacancy of six years, Maurice FitzGibbon (1567\u20131578), a [[Cistercian]] abbot, was promoted to the archbishopric by [[Pope Pius V]], but James [[McCaul#Reformation and Dissolution|MacCaghwell]] (McCawell) was put forward by [[Elizabeth I of England]]. Thus began the Anglican religion at Cashel. FitzGibbon, who belonged to the royal Desmond family, being deprived of his see, fled to France and passed into Spain where he resided for a time at the Court. He conferred with the English ambassador at Paris to obtain pardon for leaving the country without the Queen's sanction, and to get permission to return. In this he failed, and going back to Ireland secretly he was arrested and imprisoned at Cork, where he died in 1578. On the death of MacCaghwell, Elizabeth advanced [[Miler MacGrath]], a [[Franciscan]] and [[Bishop of Down]], to the [[See of Cashel]]. He held at the same time four bishoprics and several [[benefice]]s, out of which he provided for his numerous offspring. Having occupied the see for fifty-two years, he died in 1622. His monument in the ruined cathedral bears an epitaph written by himself.\n\n[[Dermot O'Hurley]], or Diarmaid \u00d3 hUrthuile, of Limerick, a distinguished student of the [[Old University of Leuven|university of Louvain]] in the [[Duchy of Brabant]] and professor at [[Reims]] in France, was appointed Archbishop of Cashel in 1581 by Pope [[Gregory XIII]]. Having presided over the Roman Catholic diocese secretly for two years, he was discovered and brought before the [[Lord Justice]]s at Dublin, was tortured upon his refusal to take the [[Oath of Supremacy]] to the English crown and was subsequently hanged outside the city on 20 June, 1584.\n\n[[File:Huge crowd gathered at Cashel, Co. Tipperary for Corpus Christi procession (5785927872).jpg|thumb|Celebration of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] at Rock of Cashel c. 1922]]\nDr Butler 2nd (1774\u20131791), on being appointed to the Roman Catholic diocese, settled in [[Thurles]], where the Roman Catholic archbishops since then have resided. His successor, Archbishop Bray (1792\u20131820), built a large church in the early part of the 19th century, on the site of which Archbishop [[Patrick Leahy (bishop)|Patrick Leahy]] (1857\u20131874) erected a splendid cathedral in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style. It was completed and consecrated in 1879 by [[Thomas Croke|Archbishop Croke]] (1874\u20131902) and dedicated to [[Our Lady of the Assumption]].\n\nSt Albert (feast 8 January), a reputed former bishop, is the [[patron saint]] of the Roman Catholic diocese. The Archbishop of Cashel is Administrator of the ancient Diocese of Emly.\n\nThe Anglican archbishopric was reduced in status by legislation of 1833 and the bishopric combined initially with Waterford.

This is meant to help preschool children with learning the alphabet, spelling, reading and writing.\n\n==Characters==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Main Colour !!Information\n|-\n| A \n| Light green and dark green || She likes to sing and help the other vowels. She has a bandage on her cheek and apples keep falling on her head. In \"Prank\" She discovered a red clown nose and played jokes on all of the other Alphablocks. \n|-\n| B \n| Light blue and vermilion || She plays the bass guitar. She is D's sister and they play in a band together.\n|-\n| C \n| Red and white with blue stars || The only letter who performs stunts. She wears goggles and makes cracks in the ground. She often worries why she's even a letter because she makes the same sound as K. \n|-\n| D \n| Purple and bright green || He is a proper cube shape and he plays the drums. He is B's brother. His catchphrases include \"Don't despair\" and \"Disaster!\"\n|-\n| E \n| Red || He is the busiest letter in the alphabet. His 'eh's echo from the megaphone he uses. He also becomes Magic E who is red with a top hat and a black ninja outfit to make the other vowels say their names. There is also Silent E. He has the same look as Magic E, but he does not wear a top hat. In \"Sleep\" all he wanted to do is to rest his sleepy head, but the other Alphablocks had other plans in mind.\n|-\n| F\n| Purple and white with orange visor || She is into floating and blowing. She is designed like an astronaut with a small life-support backpack. She can fly about in the air or in outer space. Her 'ffff' sound is used to represent the sound of a rocket-pack attached to her.\n|-\n| G \n| Green || She looks like a plant with flowers on her sides and grassy hair. Sometimes she drinks water, and when that happens her hair grows. \n|-\n| H \n| Yellow and red || She likes to run, but she can get tired when running. Her 'h-h-h-h' sound is panting.\n|-\n| I \n| Magenta || Her singing can be too loud sometimes but the Alphablocks really like her singing. She is also self-absorbed and thinks she is the most important letter (reflecting the use of 'I' to refer to oneself, or the first person).\n|-\n| J \n| Blue and white with orange 'beak' || She looks like a penguin, but thinks she is a jay bird. She thinks she can sing and fly like a real jay.\n|-\n| K \n| Yellow, with a green jersey and red trousers || He likes to kick his ball. Sometimes he cooperates with his because the hard C makes the same sound as K. \n|-\n| L \n| Lavender pink with green <nowiki/>boots || She loves to sing songs with her 'luh-luh-luh' sound. She sings a special lullaby to help the others get to sleep.\n|-\n| M \n| White with blue feet || He is dressed up as a chef and likes to eat things (even things that are not food) which makes him quite greedy. This can annoy the other Alphablocks. \n|-\n| N \n|| Vermilion || He is quite stubborn and negative. He says \"No\" even if he means yes. In \"Ants\", A, P, T, and S were blaming him for nothing, which made him very upset. In \"Little Red N\" he faced a challenge when the dog, the cat, and the pig refused to help him make bread out of wheat. In \"Band\", he plays an N-shaped electric guitar.\n|-\n| O \n| Orange || He does not speak, only being able to make his \"o\" sounds, but he likes to investigate lots of things with his magnifying glass.\n|-\n| P \n| Bright green, blue and purple with white stars and dark green pointed shoes || She can appear and disappear by making a popping noise and it can scare the others when they are busy. She appears to be a pixie. She is very sweet and loves to help her friends.\n|-\n| Q\n| Teal with indigo hair || She is an old green woman who dresses like a queen and wants to be quite quarreling. She is also in love with U, which is who she also needs to make her 'qu' or 'q' sound, but he always runs away. \n|- \t\n| R \n| Red and black || She looks like a pirate (reflecting the stereotypical \"arrrrrr\" pirate exclamation), and she has a tomboy personality. She has a habit of trilling the \"R\"s]] in her words.\n|-\n| S \n| Red, white, blue, orange, green, and yellow || She resembles a beach ball. She can inflate and deflate and fly about. In \"Clap\" she became depressed when she questioned her status as a letter, because she makes the same sound as soft C.\n|-\n| T \n|Navy blue || He wears a monocle and has a white mustache. He really likes drinking tea. He says \"t, t\" when he is out of tea. He is one of the consonants who appears a lot.\n|-\n| U \n| Light blue with blue shoes || He wears square glasses and is quite moody. He always runs away from Q. He usually says words like \"unfair\" or \"unbelievable\". \n|-\n| V \n| Red and white || He is a racing driver who is very fast with his steering wheel and has feathers on his arms. His 'v-v-v' sound is his \"vroom\".\n|-\n| W \n|Dark blue || He cries when he gets hurt or when he is upset, causing floods everywhere. His 'w-w-w' sound is wailing. He refers to his name as his sound.\n|-\n| X \n| Yellow and blue with white boots and red cape || He is a superhero called The Exciting X who has x-ray vision. In \"Plusman\", he became Plusman when he accidentally hit his head on the ceiling, causing his letter shape to go all wonky and turn into a plus sign, and he turned red with a different personality. He then had the power to make compound words - putting two words together into one. In the same episode, he showed how he became Plusman with his laser by rotating his X the same way his letter shape did and made the compound word \"lunchbox\".\n|-\n| Y \n| Yellow || He is the youngest Alphablock. He perseveres even if he has trouble doing things.\n|-\n| Z \n|Lime green with silver beard || He is the oldest Alphablock who wears a medal and carries a walking stick. He can sleep almost anywhere (reflecting the \"zzz\" sound commonly used to represent the sound of sleeping or snoring in comic books).\n|}\n\n==Other characters==\n*Birthday Girl\n*Cow Boy\n*Singing Cow\n*Puppy\n*Cat\n*Rats\n*Bats\n*Dog\n*Sheep\n*Sheep Dog\n*Rams\n\n==Episodes==\n===Series 1 (2010)===\nVolume 1 originally ran in the UK from January to February 2010.<ref name=tvdb>{{cite web|url=http://thetvdb.com/?tab=series&id=138481|title=Alphablocks|publisher=tvdb}}</ref>\n{{colbegin|colwidth=20em}}\n{{ordered list|start=1\n | Alphablocks (Letters from A-Z)\n | Bee (The letter E)\n | Top (B_G)\n | Why (The letter Y)\n | Key (Letters C and K)\n | Glow\n | Sing (B_ND)\n | Band (_AB)\n | Party (The letter X, SA_)\n | Cha Cha Cha (Digraphs CH, SH and TH)\n | Race (Spelling words with the 26 letters)\n | Moon (Digraph OO)\n | Alphalympics (Spelling words with certain letters)\n | Sail (Digraph AI)\n | UFO (Spelling words with vowels, F and R)\n | Fox (The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog)\n | Surprise (Words with A, P, R and T)\n | Bus (Words with O, P, S and T)\n | Space (Words with A, C, E, P and S\n | Hide (Magic E and Digraph EE)\n | Quiet (Letters Q and U)\n | Map (Letter R and why she is a pirate)\n | Jaybird (Letter J)\n | Note (O-E)\n | Zzzzz (Letter Z and digraph ZZ)\n | Magic-E (Magic E)\n\n}}\n{{colend}}\n\n===Series 2 (2012)===\nVolume 2 originally ran in the UK from February to March 2012.<ref name=tvdb/>\n{{colbegin|colwidth=20em}}\n# Taps (S, A, T and P)\n# In (I and N)\n# Man (Letter M)\n# Din (letter D)\n# Dog (Letter G)\n# Cat (CVC words with A)\n# Pen (CVC words with E)\n# Up (CVC words with U)\n# Red (Letter R)\n# Hen (Letter H)\n# Bop (Letter B)\n# Fred (Letter F)\n# Hill (Digraphs SS, LL and FF)\n# Van (Letters J and V)\n# Zap (Letters Y and Z)\n# Dot (Letter O and why I has her dot)\n# Lips (vowels)\n# Box (various words)\n# Web (Letters W and X)\n# Quick (Letter Q)\n# Kick (Letters C and K)\n# Wig (CVC words with I)\n# Rainbow (CVC words with O)\n# On (All 26 letters)\n# ABC (The Alphabet Song)\n# The Cat Sat on the Mat (_AT)\n{{colend}}\n<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01cz0vd/episodes/2012 |title=Episodes from Alphablocks: Series 2 broadcast in 2012 |year=2012 |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=10 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Series 3 (2012)===\nVolume 3 originally aired from October 2012 to January 2013\n{{colbegin|colwidth=20em}}\n# Wish (_UG)\n# Snowman (_AN)\n# Win (CVC words with all the vowels)\n# Hat (_AP)\n# Little Red N (CVC words with all the vowels)\n# Dots (3 and 4 letter words)\n# Frog on a Dog (_OG)\n# Best (S changing a word)\n# Fit (_IT)\n# Odd (nonsense words)\n# Champ (Digraphs CH and SH)\n# Song (Digraph NG)\n# Thing (Digraph TH)\n# Beep (Digraph EE)\n# Train (Digraph AI)\n# Tightrope (Trigraph IGH)\n# Toad (Digraph OA)\n# Book (Digraph OO)\n# Hey!

This is meant to help preschool children with learning the alphabet, spelling, reading and writing.\n\n==Characters==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Main Colour !!Information\n|-\n| A \n| Light green and dark green || She likes to sing and help the other vowels. She has a bandage on her cheek and apples keep falling on her head. In \"Prank\" She discovered a red clown nose and played jokes on all of the other Alphablocks. \n|-\n| B \n| Light blue and vermilion || She plays the bass guitar. She is D's sister and they play in a band together.\n|-\n| C \n| Red and white with blue stars || The only letter who performs stunts. She wears goggles and makes cracks in the ground. She often worries why she's even a letter because she makes the same sound as K. \n|-\n| D \n| Purple and bright green || He is a proper cube shape and he plays the drums. He is B's brother. His catchphrases include \"Don't despair\" and \"Disaster!\"\n|-\n| E \n| Red || He is the busiest letter in the alphabet. His 'eh's echo from the megaphone he uses. He also becomes Magic E who is red with a top hat and a black ninja outfit to make the other vowels say their names. There is also Silent E. He has the same look as Magic E, but he does not wear a top hat. In \"Sleep\" all he wanted to do is to rest his sleepy head, but the other Alphablocks had other plans in mind.\n|-\n| F\n| Purple and white with orange visor || She is into floating and blowing. She is designed like an astronaut with a small life-support backpack. She can fly about in the air or in outer space. Her 'ffff' sound is used to represent the sound of a rocket-pack attached to her.\n|-\n| G \n| Green || She looks like a plant with flowers on her sides and grassy hair. Sometimes she drinks water, and when that happens her hair grows. \n|-\n| H \n| Yellow and red || She likes to run, but she can get tired when running. Her 'h-h-h-h' sound is panting.\n|-\n| I \n| Magenta || Her singing can be too loud sometimes but the Alphablocks really like her singing. She is also self-absorbed and thinks she is the most important letter (reflecting the use of 'I' to refer to oneself, or the first person).\n|-\n| J \n| Blue and white with orange 'beak' || She looks like a penguin, but thinks she is a jay bird. She thinks she can sing and fly like a real jay.\n|-\n| K \n| Yellow, with a green jersey and red trousers || He likes to kick his ball. Sometimes he cooperates with his because the hard C makes the same sound as K. \n|-\n| L \n| Lavender pink with green <nowiki/>boots || She loves to sing songs with her 'luh-luh-luh' sound. She sings a special lullaby to help the others get to sleep.\n|-\n| M \n| White with blue feet || He is dressed up as a chef and likes to eat things (even things that are not food) which makes him quite greedy. This can annoy the other Alphablocks. \n|-\n| N \n|| Vermilion || He is quite stubborn and negative. He says \"No\" even if he means yes. In \"Ants\", A, P, T, and S were blaming him for nothing, which made him very upset. In \"Little Red N\" he faced a challenge when the dog, the cat, and the pig refused to help him make bread out of wheat. In \"Band\", he plays an N-shaped electric guitar.\n|-\n| O \n| Orange || He does not speak, only being able to make his \"o\" sounds, but he likes to investigate lots of things with his magnifying glass.\n|-\n| P \n| Bright green, blue and purple with white stars and dark green pointed shoes || She can appear and disappear by making a popping noise and it can scare the others when they are busy. She appears to be a pixie. She is very sweet and loves to help her friends.\n|-\n| Q\n| Teal with indigo hair || She is an old green woman who dresses like a queen and wants to be quite quarreling. She is also in love with U, which is who she also needs to make her 'qu' or 'q' sound, but he always runs away. \n|- \t\n| R \n| Red and black || She looks like a pirate (reflecting the stereotypical \"arrrrrr\" pirate exclamation), and she has a tomboy personality. She has a habit of trilling the \"R\"s]] in her words.\n|-\n| S \n| Red, white, blue, orange, green, and yellow || She resembles a beach ball. She can inflate and deflate and fly about. In \"Clap\" she became depressed when she questioned her status as a letter, because she makes the same sound as soft C.\n|-\n| T \n|Navy blue || He wears a monocle and has a white mustache. He really likes drinking tea. He says \"t, t\" when he is out of tea. He is one of the consonants who appears a lot.\n|-\n| U \n| Light blue with blue shoes || He wears square glasses and is quite moody. He always runs away from Q. He usually says words like \"unfair\" or \"unbelievable\". \n|-\n| V \n| Red and white || He is a racing driver who is very fast with his steering wheel and has feathers on his arms. His 'v-v-v' sound is his \"vroom\".\n|-\n| W \n|Dark blue || He cries when he gets hurt or when he is upset, causing floods everywhere. His 'w-w-w' sound is wailing. He refers to his name as his sound.\n|-\n| X \n| Yellow and blue with white boots and red cape || He is a superhero called The Exciting X who has x-ray vision. In \"Plusman\", he became Plusman when he accidentally hit his head on the ceiling, causing his letter shape to go all wonky and turn into a plus sign, and he turned red with a different personality. He then had the power to make compound words - putting two words together into one. In the same episode, he showed how he became Plusman with his laser by rotating his X the same way his letter shape did and made the compound word \"lunchbox\".\n|-\n| Y \n| Yellow || He is the youngest Alphablock. He perseveres even if he has trouble doing things.\n|-\n| Z \n|Lime green with silver beard || He is the oldest Alphablock who wears a medal and carries a walking stick. He can sleep almost anywhere (reflecting the \"zzz\" sound commonly used to represent the sound of sleeping or snoring in comic books).\n|}\n\n==Other characters==\n*Birthday Girl\n*Cow Boy\n*Singing Cow\n*Puppy\n*Cat\n*Rats\n*Bats\n*Dog\n*Sheep\n*Sheep Dog\n*Rams\n\n==Episodes==\n===Series 1 (2010)===\nVolume 1 originally ran in the UK from January to February 2010.<ref name=tvdb>{{cite web|url=http://thetvdb.com/?tab=series&id=138481|title=Alphablocks|publisher=tvdb}}</ref>\n{{colbegin|colwidth=20em}}\n{{ordered list|start=1\n | Alphablocks (Letters from A-Z)\n | Bee (The letter E)\n | Top (B_G)\n | Why (The letter Y)\n | Key (Letters C and K)\n | Glow\n | Sing (B_ND)\n | Band (_AB)\n | Party (The letter X, SA_)\n | Cha Cha Cha (Digraphs CH, SH and TH)\n | Race (Spelling words with the 26 letters)\n | Moon (Digraph OO)\n | Alphalympics (Spelling words with certain letters)\n | Sail (Digraph AI)\n | UFO (Spelling words with vowels, F and R)\n | Fox (The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog)\n | Surprise (Words with A, P, R and T)\n | Bus (Words with O, P, S and T)\n | Space (Words with A, C, E, P and S\n | Hide (Magic E and Digraph EE)\n | Quiet (Letters Q and U)\n | Map (Letter R and why she is a pirate)\n | Jaybird (Letter J)\n | Note (O-E)\n | Zzzzz (Letter Z and digraph ZZ)\n | Magic-E (Magic E)\n\n}}\n{{colend}}\n\n===Series 2 (2012)===\nVolume 2 originally ran in the UK from February to March 2012.<ref name=tvdb/>\n{{colbegin|colwidth=20em}}\n# Taps (S, A, T and P)\n# In (I and N)\n# Man (Letter M)\n# Din (letter D)\n# Dog (Letter G)\n# Cat (CVC words with A)\n# Pen (CVC words with E)\n# Up (CVC words with U)\n# Red (Letter R)\n# Hen (Letter H)\n# Bop (Letter B)\n# Fred (Letter F)\n# Hill (Digraphs SS, LL and FF)\n# Van (Letters J and V)\n# Zap (Letters Y and Z)\n# Dot (Letter O and why I has her dot)\n# Lips (vowels)\n# Box (various words)\n# Web (Letters W and X)\n# Quick (Letter Q)\n# Kick (Letters C and K)\n# Wig (CVC words with I)\n# Rainbow (CVC words with O)\n# On (All 26 letters)\n# ABC (The Alphabet Song)\n# The Cat Sat on the Mat (_AT)\n{{colend}}\n<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01cz0vd/episodes/2012 |title=Episodes from Alphablocks: Series 2 broadcast in 2012 |year=2012 |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=10 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Series 3 (2012)===\nVolume 3 originally aired from October 2012 to January 2013\n{{colbegin|colwidth=20em}}\n# Wish (_UG)\n# Snowman (_AN)\n# Win (CVC words with all the vowels)\n# Hat (_AP)\n# Little Red N (CVC words with all the vowels)\n# Dots (3 and 4 letter words)\n# Frog on a Dog (_OG)\n# Best (S changing a word)\n# Fit (_IT)\n# Odd (nonsense words)\n# Champ (Digraphs CH and SH)\n# Song (Digraph NG)\n# Thing (Digraph TH)\n# Beep (Digraph EE)\n# Train (Digraph AI)\n# Tightrope (Trigraph IGH)\n# Toad (Digraph OA)\n# Book (Digraph OO)\n# Hey!
