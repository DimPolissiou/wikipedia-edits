Enhancers boost transcription of a particular gene by interacting with a promoter of that gene.

The second mechanism is referred to as promoter insertion. Promoters provide our cells with the specific sequences needed to begin translation. Promoter insertion has helped researchers learn more about the HIV virus. The third mechanism is gene inactivation. A example of gene inactivation is using insertional mutagenesis to insert a retrovirus that disrupts the genome of the T cell in leukemia patients and giving them a specific antigen called CAR allowing the T cells to target cancer cells. The final mechanisms is referred to as mRNA 3' end substitution. Our genes occasionally undergo point mutations causing beta-thalassemia that interrupts red blood cell function.

Enhancers boost transcription of a particular gene by interacting with a promoter of that gene. This particular mechanism was first used to help severely immunocompromised patients I need of bone marrow. Gammaretroviruses carrying enhancers were then inserted into patients. The second mechanism is referred to as promoter insertion. Promoters provide our cells with the specific sequences needed to begin translation. Promoter insertion has helped researchers learn more about the HIV virus. The third mechanism is gene inactivation. A example of gene inactivation is using insertional mutagenesis to insert a retrovirus that disrupts the genome of the T cell in leukemia patients and giving them a specific antigen called CAR allowing the T cells to target cancer cells. The final mechanisms is referred to as mRNA 3' end substitution. Our genes occasionally undergo point mutations causing beta-thalassemia that interrupts red blood cell function. To fix this problem the correct gene sequence for the red blood cells are introduced and a substitution is made.<ref name=\"Bushman_2020\"/>\n\n==Homologous recombination==\n[[Homologous recombination]] can be used to produce specific mutation in an organism. Vector containing DNA sequence similar to the gene to be modified is introduced to the cell, and by a process of recombination replaces the target gene in the chromosome.

{"title_page": "Personal foul (basketball)", "text_new": "[[File:Estudiantes vs Unicaja M\u00e1laga - Carl English y Zoran Dragi\u0107.jpg|270px|thumbnail|[[Zoran Dragi\u0107]] (right) contacts [[Carl English]] and commits a foul.]]\nIn [[basketball]], a '''personal foul''' is a breach of the rules that concerns illegal personal contact with an opponent. It is the most common type of foul in basketball. A player '''fouls out''' on reaching a limit on personal fouls for the game and is disqualified from participation in the remainder of the game.\n\nPlayers routinely initiate illegal contact to purposely affect the play, hoping it is seen as too minor to be ruled a foul. The threshold is subjective and varies among officials and from game to game. Most contact fouls are not regarded as [[Sportsmanship|unsportsmanlike]]. However, excessive or unjustified contact is penalized more severely. The [[NBA]] refers to these as '''[[flagrant foul]]s'''; other rulebooks call them '''unsportsmanlike''' or '''disqualifying''' fouls.\n\n\npenuis\n\n==Principles==\nPersonal contact does not necessarily constitute a personal foul, unless it gives a player an advantage or puts the opponent at a disadvantage.\n\n===Cylinder===\nIn [[FIBA]], the '''cylinder principle''' gives each player exclusive rights within an imaginary cylinder defined:\n*in the front by the palms of the hands, when the arms are bent at the elbows so that the forearms and hands are raised, but no farther in front than the feet,\n*in the rear by the buttocks,\n*at the sides by the outside edge of the arms and legs.\nThe cylinder extends from the floor to the ceiling, allowing the player to jump upward.\n\nA player can occupy any cylinder not already occupied by the opponent.  No one else is allowed to step or reach into this cylinder.  A player must not extend his limbs or bend his body in a way that is not normal.  If there is a breach of this principle that places the opponent at a disadvantage, the official may penalise it.\n\nThe NBA does not use the cylinder principle to judge contact; it only says that a player may not bend or reach in a position that is not normal (nor push, hold, and so on).\n\n===Elements of time and distance===\nThe '''elements of time and distance''' concern the reaction time and distance of another person.  They apply only to players without the ball, not to the ball carrier.  For example, a player cannot suddenly step in front of a sprinting player, even without invading the cylinder.  Another example is when a player sets a [[Screen (sports)|screen]] directly behind a player: the player would not physically be able to react to the screen in enough time to avoid it.\n\n==Types of foul==\n[[File:Personal a Doellman.webm|thumb|250px|[[Justin Doellman]], then a [[Valencia Basket]] player, is fouled in a [[Eurocup Basketball|Eurocup]] match.]]\n\n===Charging and blocking===<!-- This section is linked from [[Charge]] -->\n{{redirect|Offensive fouls|the Canadian play|Offensive Fouls}}\nWhen significant{{refn|group=n|The NBA rulebook (officiating guidelines, Section C) repeatedly excludes \"negligible and/or incidental....contact\".}} illegal contact between the ball-carrier and a defender occurs, it usually means that either \u2014\n*The defender committed a '''blocking''' foul, or\n*The ball-carrier committed the '''offensive foul''' of '''charging'''.\n\nDeciding between the two is complex, partly subjective, and often controversial.\n\nGenerally, the ball-carrier committed a charge if all of the following are true:\n*The defender was still, or moving sideways or backward but not forward, when contact occurred.\n*The defender took a legal guarding position before the contact, that is, one with both feet on the floor.\n*The defender was hit on the torso (as opposed to the arm or leg).\n\nIn the NBA, in contact during a move to the basket, officials do not consider the position of the defender's feet, but decide whether the defensive player's torso was set in position before the offensive player began his upward motion.<ref name=\"ESPN\">{{cite web|author=[[ESPN]]|publisher=espn.com|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/5397/notes-from-a-day-with-nba-referees|title=Notes from a Day with NBA Referees|accessdate=May 19, 2010}}</ref>\n\nA charging foul is usually not called if the ball-handler is within a 4-foot (1.22 m) radius around the center of the basket (known in the rules as the \"restricted area\" and sometimes colloquially as the \"smiley face\"<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/sports/basketball/1079891-460/referees-are-fouling-up-a-good-thing.html\n|title=Referees are fouling up a good thing\n|author=Alan Greenwood\n|newspaper=Nashua Telegraph\n|date=April 24, 2016\n|accessdate=August 29, 2016}}\n</ref>). That is, if the ball-carrier is under the basket, the defense usually cannot restrict his or her movement by drawing a charge. An exception is made if the offensive player receives the ball within an area close to the basket known as the \"lower defensive box.\"\n\nA related call is the '''player control foul'''.{{refn|group=n|NBA Rule 12-B-II states, \"The dribbler must be in control of his body at all times.\"}}\n\n;Strategy\nApart from using hands in neutral space to shield or deflect a pass or a shot, the defender uses his or her body to impede the ball-carrier's advance toward the basket.  The defender's only absolute way to achieve this is to stand directly in the ball-carrier's path and \"draw a charge.\"  Short of this, the defender's use of the body may make the ball-carrier hesitate or change tactics.  Both opponents are restrained by their desire not to commit a foul.\n\nIt is not a foul to grab for the ball, or to touch a hand of the ball-carrier that is on the ball, but the ball-carrier, especially in the act of shooting, can easily cause greater contact that is a blocking foul against the defender.\n\nOnce contact is made, the defender may fall to the ground to exaggerate the force of the collision and induce a foul to be called.  (The ball-carrier rarely does so, as it would disrupt the effort to score a goal.)  Overt deception is disparagingly called a \"[[Flop (basketball)|flop]]\" and is penalized at every level of basketball.\n\n;Screening\nA '''screen''' is an attempt by an offensive player to stop a defender from guarding the ball-carrier.  For example, [[John Stockton]] and [[Karl Malone]] were well known for their [[pick and roll]] (or ''screen and roll'') play.  The ball-carrier's teammate is the screener; he stands in the path of the defender as the ball-carrier dribbles past the screener.  This at least costs the defender time, and may induce a collision.  Either leaves the ball-carrier unguarded.  However, if the screener moves towards the ball-carrier when contact occurs, or does not respect the elements of time and distance, or initiates contact, he is charged with '''illegal screening''' or setting a '''moving pick'''.  These are blocking fouls.\n\n===Other fouls on the ball-carrier===\nIn the NBA, the ball-carrier cannot attempt to dribble past a defender where there is not enough space, such as dribbling between a defender and either a boundary or another defensive player. If the ball-carrier has space to put head and shoulders past the defender, then the defender is responsible.\n\nIn FIBA, this rule is not codified, but contact caused by the dribbler is still penalized.\n\n===Fouls away from the ball===\nThe rules are symmetrical for contact between offensive and defensive players not involving the ball-carrier.  Any player has the right to a position on the court legally acquired.  A player acquiring a position that will impede an opponent must respect the elements of time and distance; that is, not take a position so close, or so quickly, that the opponent cannot avoid contact.  This includes gradually slowing down after running with the opponent, and situations where the opponent is shielded from seeing the player's movement.\n\n===Other personal fouls===\n*'''Pushing''' \u2014 Contact that displaces an opponent (for example, pushing a player away from the basket, or using body weight to affect a player's movement).\n*'''Holding''' \u2014 Contact that interferes with a player's freedom of movement (for example, physically grabbing a player driving to the basket).\n*'''Illegal use of hands''' \u2014 Extending the hands outside the [[#Cylinder|cylinder]] and causing illegal contact (for example, going for a steal but hitting the player's hand or arm, or hitting the arm of a shooter).\n*'''Hand-checking''' \u2014 Contact by the defense on a ball handler that impedes a player's speed, quickness, rhythm, and/or balance.\n*'''Illegal use of elbow''' \u2014 Moving one's elbow outside the [[#Cylinder|cylinder]] to disadvantage an opponent. This mostly occurs during a post-up play situation, where either offense or defense attempt to gain a better position.\n*'''Illegal use of legs or knees''' (on the dunk): Jumping up with one knee forward as to intentionally hit the defender.\n\n===Non-foul===\nReferees who called every case of illegal player contact would dominate the game to the exclusion of the athletes, but reluctance to make calls would make the game excessively violent.  The rules direct referees to seek a balance between these extremes, though they do not define it.{{refn|group=n|For example, in the NBA rulebook, the [http://www.nba.com/analysis/rules_guides.html overview of officiating] discusses the need to \"create a balance of play\" and \"provide reasonable safety...without unduly limiting freedom of action.\"}}\n\nWhen players are competing for a ball that goes out of bounds, and one player commits illegal but minor contact, referees often do not feel a foul is justified but resolve the situation by simply awarding possession of the ball to the other team.\n\nThe \"reach-in foul\" is a misnomer. Reaching toward a player is not a foul, though physical contact may be a foul.\n\n==Penalties==\nThe official scorer records the foul in two counts of fouls on the scoresheet:\n*As a '''player foul''' against the offending player during the game.  A player who accumulates too many fouls will foul out (see below).\n*As a '''team foul''' against the offending player's team during the current quarter or half. A team that accumulates too many fouls in that period enters the [[Bonus (basketball)|penalty situation]] and puts the other team into the \"bonus.\" In college basketball, another, higher number of team fouls gives the other team a \"double bonus\" (men only) regarding the number of free throws. (See the article on [[free throws]].)\n\nOn a foul committed by the defense (and on a '''loose-ball foul''' when neither team is in possession of the ball), if the team committing the foul is in the penalty situation or the fouled player was in the act of shooting, the fouled player is awarded free throws. Otherwise, and on offensive fouls, the fouled player's team is awarded possession of the ball to pass inbounds from the out-of-bounds point nearest to the foul. The [[shot clock]] is reset.\n\nIn some rulebooks, such as that of FIBA, a [[technical foul]] is included in the count of player fouls.\n\nIf the game goes to [[Overtime (sports)#Basketball|overtime]], foul counts are not reset, but continue as though overtime were a continuation of the final regulation period. The NBA and WNBA are exceptions, in that each overtime period has its own count of team fouls.\n\n;Free throws plus possession\nThe NBA awards the fouled player free throws followed by possession of the ball in the following cases:\n*A [[flagrant foul]].\n*A defense foul when the ball carrier is in the frontcourt with a \"clear path\" to the basket (no defender between the ball carrier and the basket).<ref>{{Cite web\n |url         = http://www.basketballhow.com/information/rules/violations/fouls/personal-foul/clear-path-foul/\n |title       = Clear Path Foul\n |publisher   = basketballhow.com\n |accessdate  = 2014-09-22\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20141122205447/http://www.basketballhow.com/information/rules/violations/fouls/personal-foul/clear-path-foul/\n |archivedate = 2014-11-22\n}}</ref>\n*A foul \"away from the ball\" in the last two minutes of the game.\n\n===Strategy===\n[[File:Van Rossom vs. Alba.webm|thumb|right|250px|[[Sam Van Rossom]] scores a two-point shot and is fouled on the same play.]]\nFans and commentators often speak of a \"good foul\u201d when the fouled player would otherwise have made a sure basket. By fouling the player and preventing an easy two points, the defender forces the offensive player to \"earn\" the two points from the free throw line. However, if the foul does not prevent the player from scoring, the basket is counted and the fouled player gets an additional free throw.\n\nAfter the fouled player shoots free throws, the team that was on defense is likely to gain possession of the ball. This is by award, if the final free throw was made. Even if it is missed, defensive players can occupy better positions at the side of the lane to get the rebound.\n\nNear the end of the game, a team that is losing may purposefully foul offensive players to stop the clock and regain possession of the ball, with the hope that the player will miss his free throws. Coaches study free-throw percentages, so that the defense will foul a ball carrier who is poor at free-throw shooting. The \"[[Hack-a-Shaq]]\" strategy was famously practiced against [[Shaquille O'Neal]] in view of his poor percentage. The defense is not free to foul its choice of the five offensive players, as a foul \"away from the ball\" results in free throws plus possession. The use of intentional fouls to prolong a game is unique to basketball; most other sports consider such maneuvers a form of [[unsportsmanlike conduct]] and impose stiffer penalties to teams that attempt them (see the [[professional foul]] and [[unfair act]] in football codes).\n\n;Foul to give\nNear the end of the game, a team may have committed so few fouls that it can commit one or more fouls without putting the opponent in the bonus. It is said that the team has one or more '''fouls to give'''. A player who is not close to fouling out can foul an opponent with impunity to prevent a likely score.\n\nTo keep games from being bogged down with cheap fouls, the NBA rules provide that the second foul in the final two minutes of a half puts the fouled team in the bonus (enabling free throws) regardless of the number of team fouls.\n\n===Fouling out===\nA player who commits five personal fouls over the course of a 40-minute game,{{refn|group=n|In the WNBA and the [[Philippine Basketball Association]] [[PBA Developmental League|(PBA) Developmental League]], the limit is 6 personal fouls in a 40-minute game. In the [[NBA Summer League]], the limit is 10 fouls.}} or six in a 48-minute game, '''fouls out''' and is disqualified for the remainder of the game. A player within one or two fouls of fouling out is in \"foul trouble.\" Players who foul out are not ejected and may remain in the bench area for the remainder of the game. Fouling out of a game is not a disciplinary action.\n\nIn the NCAA and FIBA, if a team is reduced below five players by fouling out, injury, or ejection, play continues. A team is declared the loser if reduced to a single player.\n\nThis rule was invoked in an NCAA game between the Minnesota Golden Gophers and the Alabama Crimson Tide on November 25, 2017. With 13:39 remaining in the second half, a scuffle broke out involving Minnesota players in the game and Alabama players on the bench. Alabama's entire bench was ejected, leaving the Crimson Tide with only five active players. Alabama's Dazon Ingram fouled out at the 11:37 mark, and John Petty left the game with a sprained ankle, forcing the Tide to play the final 10:41 with three players.\n\nIn the NBA and WNBA, teams cannot be reduced below five players. A [[bonus (basketball)|player foul penalty]] situation exists when only five eligible players remain.  If there are only five players, a player who fouls out stays in the game. If another of the five players is ejected or injured, the last player to foul out rejoins the game.  Under the player foul penalty rule, each situation results in a technical foul, with the non-offending team shooting one technical foul free throw.  If that player commits another foul, the opponent will be awarded one additional free throw under the same situation in addition to any free throws awarded, including offensive fouls, which normally are not assessed free throws.

It is the most common type of foul in basketball. A player '''fouls out''' on reaching a limit on personal fouls for the game and is disqualified from participation in the remainder of the game.\n\nPlayers routinely initiate illegal contact to purposely affect the play, hoping it is seen as too minor to be ruled a foul. The threshold is subjective and varies among officials and from game to game. Most contact fouls are not regarded as [[Sportsmanship|unsportsmanlike]]. However, excessive or unjustified contact is penalized more severely. The [[NBA]] refers to these as '''[[flagrant foul]]s'''; other rulebooks call them '''unsportsmanlike''' or '''disqualifying''' fouls.\n\n==History==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = center\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = 129\n\n| image1    = 20130103 Max Bielfeldt draws a foul (1).JPG\n| width1    = \n| alt1      = \n| caption1  =\n\n| image2    = 20130103 Max Bielfeldt draws a foul (2).JPG\n| width2    = \n| alt2      = \n| caption2  =\n\n| image3    = 20130103 Max Bielfeldt draws a foul (3).JPG\n| width3    = \n| alt3      = \n| caption3  =\n\n| image4    = 20130103 Max Bielfeldt draws a foul (4).JPG\n| width4    = \n| alt4      = \n| caption4  =\n\n| image5    = 20130103 Max Bielfeldt draws a foul (5).JPG\n| width5    = \n| alt5      = \n| caption5  =\n\n| header            = \n| header_align      = <!-- left/right/center -->\n| header_background = \n| footer            = Max Bielfeldt of the [[2012\u201313 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team]] playing against [[2012\u201313 Northwestern Wildcats men's basketball team|Northwestern]] draws a [[foul (basketball)|foul]] with a pump fake in the team's January 3 [[2012\u201313 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season]] opener.\n| footer_align      = <!-- left/right/center -->\n| footer_background = \n| background color  = \n}}\nBasketball has always had the concept of fouls. In 1891, [[James Naismith]]'s original 13 rules<ref name=\"USAbasketball.com\">{{cite web\n| title=Dr. James Naismith's Original 13 Rules of Basket Ball\n| url=http://www.usab.com/history/dr-james-naismiths-original-13-rules-of-basketball.aspx\n| publisher=USA Basketball\n| accessdate=February 10, 2016}}</ref> defined a foul as:\n*running with the ball,\n*holding the ball with the arms or body,\n*striking the ball with the fist,\n*shouldering, holding, pushing, striking or tripping in any way of an opponent.\nOnly the fourth definition remains. Running with the ball and striking it with the fist are now violations.  Holding the ball with the arms or body is now rare but legal.\n\nOriginally, on a player's second foul, the player would be removed without substitution until the next successful goal (similar to a penalty in [[ice hockey]]). Before long, [[free throw]]s were introduced, originally worth three points each, then one. Originally, any team member was allowed to shoot free throws.  In 1924, the rules were changed so that the fouled player shot the free throws.\n\nThe victim of a contact foul used to be given three attempts at a free throw, and the offense retained possession of the basketball. Now, a player fouled in the act of shooting gets from one to three shots and the other team tends to get possession afterwards (see [[#Penalties|Penalties]] below).\n\n==Principles==\nPersonal contact does not necessarily constitute a personal foul, unless it gives a player an advantage or puts the opponent at a disadvantage.\n\n===Cylinder===\nIn [[FIBA]], the '''cylinder principle''' gives each player exclusive rights within an imaginary cylinder defined:\n*in the front by the palms of the hands, when the arms are bent at the elbows so that the forearms and hands are raised, but no farther in front than the feet,\n*in the rear by the buttocks,\n*at the sides by the outside edge of the arms and legs.\nThe cylinder extends from the floor to the ceiling, allowing the player to jump upward.\n\nA player can occupy any cylinder not already occupied by the opponent.  No one else is allowed to step or reach into this cylinder.  A player must not extend his limbs or bend his body in a way that is not normal.  If there is a breach of this principle that places the opponent at a disadvantage, the official may penalise it.\n\nThe NBA does not use the cylinder principle to judge contact; it only says that a player may not bend or reach in a position that is not normal (nor push, hold, and so on).\n\n===Elements of time and distance===\nThe '''elements of time and distance''' concern the reaction time and distance of another person.  They apply only to players without the ball, not to the ball carrier.  For example, a player cannot suddenly step in front of a sprinting player, even without invading the cylinder.  Another example is when a player sets a [[Screen (sports)|screen]] directly behind a player: the player would not physically be able to react to the screen in enough time to avoid it.\n\n==Types of foul==\n[[File:Personal a Doellman.webm|thumb|250px|[[Justin Doellman]], then a [[Valencia Basket]] player, is fouled in a [[Eurocup Basketball|Eurocup]] match.]]\n\n===Charging and blocking===<!-- This section is linked from [[Charge]] -->\n{{redirect|Offensive fouls|the Canadian play|Offensive Fouls}}\nWhen significant{{refn|group=n|The NBA rulebook (officiating guidelines, Section C) repeatedly excludes \"negligible and/or incidental....contact\".}} illegal contact between the ball-carrier and a defender occurs, it usually means that either \u2014\n*The defender committed a '''blocking''' foul, or\n*The ball-carrier committed the '''offensive foul''' of '''charging'''.\n\nDeciding between the two is complex, partly subjective, and often controversial.\n\nGenerally, the ball-carrier committed a charge if all of the following are true:\n*The defender was still, or moving sideways or backward but not forward, when contact occurred.\n*The defender took a legal guarding position before the contact, that is, one with both feet on the floor.\n*The defender was hit on the torso (as opposed to the arm or leg).\n\nIn the NBA, in contact during a move to the basket, officials do not consider the position of the defender's feet, but decide whether the defensive player's torso was set in position before the offensive player began his upward motion.<ref name=\"ESPN\">{{cite web|author=[[ESPN]]|publisher=espn.com|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/5397/notes-from-a-day-with-nba-referees|title=Notes from a Day with NBA Referees|accessdate=May 19, 2010}}</ref>\n\nA charging foul is usually not called if the ball-handler is within a 4-foot (1.22 m) radius around the center of the basket (known in the rules as the \"restricted area\" and sometimes colloquially as the \"smiley face\"<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/sports/basketball/1079891-460/referees-are-fouling-up-a-good-thing.html\n|title=Referees are fouling up a good thing\n|author=Alan Greenwood\n|newspaper=Nashua Telegraph\n|date=April 24, 2016\n|accessdate=August 29, 2016}}\n</ref>). That is, if the ball-carrier is under the basket, the defense usually cannot restrict his or her movement by drawing a charge. An exception is made if the offensive player receives the ball within an area close to the basket known as the \"lower defensive box.\"\n\nA related call is the '''player control foul'''.{{refn|group=n|NBA Rule 12-B-II states, \"The dribbler must be in control of his body at all times.\"}}\n\n;Strategy\nApart from using hands in neutral space to shield or deflect a pass or a shot, the defender uses his or her body to impede the ball-carrier's advance toward the basket.  The defender's only absolute way to achieve this is to stand directly in the ball-carrier's path and \"draw a charge.\"  Short of this, the defender's use of the body may make the ball-carrier hesitate or change tactics.  Both opponents are restrained by their desire not to commit a foul.\n\nIt is not a foul to grab for the ball, or to touch a hand of the ball-carrier that is on the ball, but the ball-carrier, especially in the act of shooting, can easily cause greater contact that is a blocking foul against the defender.\n\nOnce contact is made, the defender may fall to the ground to exaggerate the force of the collision and induce a foul to be called.  (The ball-carrier rarely does so, as it would disrupt the effort to score a goal.)  Overt deception is disparagingly called a \"[[Flop (basketball)|flop]]\" and is penalized at every level of basketball.\n\n;Screening\nA '''screen''' is an attempt by an offensive player to stop a defender from guarding the ball-carrier.  For example, [[John Stockton]] and [[Karl Malone]] were well known for their [[pick and roll]] (or ''screen and roll'') play.  The ball-carrier's teammate is the screener; he stands in the path of the defender as the ball-carrier dribbles past the screener.  This at least costs the defender time, and may induce a collision.  Either leaves the ball-carrier unguarded.  However, if the screener moves towards the ball-carrier when contact occurs, or does not respect the elements of time and distance, or initiates contact, he is charged with '''illegal screening''' or setting a '''moving pick'''.  These are blocking fouls.\n\n===Other fouls on the ball-carrier===\nIn the NBA, the ball-carrier cannot attempt to dribble past a defender where there is not enough space, such as dribbling between a defender and either a boundary or another defensive player. If the ball-carrier has space to put head and shoulders past the defender, then the defender is responsible.\n\nIn FIBA, this rule is not codified, but contact caused by the dribbler is still penalized.\n\n===Fouls away from the ball===\nThe rules are symmetrical for contact between offensive and defensive players not involving the ball-carrier.  Any player has the right to a position on the court legally acquired.  A player acquiring a position that will impede an opponent must respect the elements of time and distance; that is, not take a position so close, or so quickly, that the opponent cannot avoid contact.  This includes gradually slowing down after running with the opponent, and situations where the opponent is shielded from seeing the player's movement.\n\n===Other personal fouls===\n*'''Pushing''' \u2014 Contact that displaces an opponent (for example, pushing a player away from the basket, or using body weight to affect a player's movement).\n*'''Holding''' \u2014 Contact that interferes with a player's freedom of movement (for example, physically grabbing a player driving to the basket).\n*'''Illegal use of hands''' \u2014 Extending the hands outside the [[#Cylinder|cylinder]] and causing illegal contact (for example, going for a steal but hitting the player's hand or arm, or hitting the arm of a shooter).\n*'''Hand-checking''' \u2014 Contact by the defense on a ball handler that impedes a player's speed, quickness, rhythm, and/or balance.\n*'''Illegal use of elbow''' \u2014 Moving one's elbow outside the [[#Cylinder|cylinder]] to disadvantage an opponent. This mostly occurs during a post-up play situation, where either offense or defense attempt to gain a better position.\n*'''Illegal use of legs or knees''' (on the dunk): Jumping up with one knee forward as to intentionally hit the defender.\n\n===Non-foul===\nReferees who called every case of illegal player contact would dominate the game to the exclusion of the athletes, but reluctance to make calls would make the game excessively violent.  The rules direct referees to seek a balance between these extremes, though they do not define it.{{refn|group=n|For example, in the NBA rulebook, the [http://www.nba.com/analysis/rules_guides.html overview of officiating] discusses the need to \"create a balance of play\" and \"provide reasonable safety...without unduly limiting freedom of action.\"}}\n\nWhen players are competing for a ball that goes out of bounds, and one player commits illegal but minor contact, referees often do not feel a foul is justified but resolve the situation by simply awarding possession of the ball to the other team.\n\nThe \"reach-in foul\" is a misnomer. Reaching toward a player is not a foul, though physical contact may be a foul.\n\n==Penalties==\nThe official scorer records the foul in two counts of fouls on the scoresheet:\n*As a '''player foul''' against the offending player during the game.  A player who accumulates too many fouls will foul out (see below).\n*As a '''team foul''' against the offending player's team during the current quarter or half. A team that accumulates too many fouls in that period enters the [[Bonus (basketball)|penalty situation]] and puts the other team into the \"bonus.\" In college basketball, another, higher number of team fouls gives the other team a \"double bonus\" (men only) regarding the number of free throws. (See the article on [[free throws]].)\n\nOn a foul committed by the defense (and on a '''loose-ball foul''' when neither team is in possession of the ball), if the team committing the foul is in the penalty situation or the fouled player was in the act of shooting, the fouled player is awarded free throws. Otherwise, and on offensive fouls, the fouled player's team is awarded possession of the ball to pass inbounds from the out-of-bounds point nearest to the foul. The [[shot clock]] is reset.\n\nIn some rulebooks, such as that of FIBA, a [[technical foul]] is included in the count of player fouls.\n\nIf the game goes to [[Overtime (sports)#Basketball|overtime]], foul counts are not reset, but continue as though overtime were a continuation of the final regulation period. The NBA and WNBA are exceptions, in that each overtime period has its own count of team fouls.\n\n;Free throws plus possession\nThe NBA awards the fouled player free throws followed by possession of the ball in the following cases:\n*A [[flagrant foul]].\n*A defense foul when the ball carrier is in the frontcourt with a \"clear path\" to the basket (no defender between the ball carrier and the basket).<ref>{{Cite web\n |url         = http://www.basketballhow.com/information/rules/violations/fouls/personal-foul/clear-path-foul/\n |title       = Clear Path Foul\n |publisher   = basketballhow.com\n |accessdate  = 2014-09-22\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20141122205447/http://www.basketballhow.com/information/rules/violations/fouls/personal-foul/clear-path-foul/\n |archivedate = 2014-11-22\n}}</ref>\n*A foul \"away from the ball\" in the last two minutes of the game.\n\n===Strategy===\n[[File:Van Rossom vs. Alba.webm|thumb|right|250px|[[Sam Van Rossom]] scores a two-point shot and is fouled on the same play.]]\nFans and commentators often speak of a \"good foul\u201d when the fouled player would otherwise have made a sure basket. By fouling the player and preventing an easy two points, the defender forces the offensive player to \"earn\" the two points from the free throw line. However, if the foul does not prevent the player from scoring, the basket is counted and the fouled player gets an additional free throw.\n\nAfter the fouled player shoots free throws, the team that was on defense is likely to gain possession of the ball. This is by award, if the final free throw was made. Even if it is missed, defensive players can occupy better positions at the side of the lane to get the rebound.\n\nNear the end of the game, a team that is losing may purposefully foul offensive players to stop the clock and regain possession of the ball, with the hope that the player will miss his free throws. Coaches study free-throw percentages, so that the defense will foul a ball carrier who is poor at free-throw shooting. The \"[[Hack-a-Shaq]]\" strategy was famously practiced against [[Shaquille O'Neal]] in view of his poor percentage. The defense is not free to foul its choice of the five offensive players, as a foul \"away from the ball\" results in free throws plus possession. The use of intentional fouls to prolong a game is unique to basketball; most other sports consider such maneuvers a form of [[unsportsmanlike conduct]] and impose stiffer penalties to teams that attempt them (see the [[professional foul]] and [[unfair act]] in football codes).\n\n;Foul to give\nNear the end of the game, a team may have committed so few fouls that it can commit one or more fouls without putting the opponent in the bonus. It is said that the team has one or more '''fouls to give'''. A player who is not close to fouling out can foul an opponent with impunity to prevent a likely score.\n\nTo keep games from being bogged down with cheap fouls, the NBA rules provide that the second foul in the final two minutes of a half puts the fouled team in the bonus (enabling free throws) regardless of the number of team fouls.\n\n===Fouling out===\nA player who commits five personal fouls over the course of a 40-minute game,{{refn|group=n|In the WNBA and the [[Philippine Basketball Association]] [[PBA Developmental League|(PBA) Developmental League]], the limit is 6 personal fouls in a 40-minute game. In the [[NBA Summer League]], the limit is 10 fouls.}} or six in a 48-minute game, '''fouls out''' and is disqualified for the remainder of the game. A player within one or two fouls of fouling out is in \"foul trouble.\" Players who foul out are not ejected and may remain in the bench area for the remainder of the game. Fouling out of a game is not a disciplinary action.\n\nIn the NCAA and FIBA, if a team is reduced below five players by fouling out, injury, or ejection, play continues. A team is declared the loser if reduced to a single player.\n\nThis rule was invoked in an NCAA game between the Minnesota Golden Gophers and the Alabama Crimson Tide on November 25, 2017. With 13:39 remaining in the second half, a scuffle broke out involving Minnesota players in the game and Alabama players on the bench. Alabama's entire bench was ejected, leaving the Crimson Tide with only five active players. Alabama's Dazon Ingram fouled out at the 11:37 mark, and John Petty left the game with a sprained ankle, forcing the Tide to play the final 10:41 with three players.\n\nIn the NBA and WNBA, teams cannot be reduced below five players. A [[bonus (basketball)|player foul penalty]] situation exists when only five eligible players remain.  If there are only five players, a player who fouls out stays in the game. If another of the five players is ejected or injured, the last player to foul out rejoins the game.  Under the player foul penalty rule, each situation results in a technical foul, with the non-offending team shooting one technical foul free throw.  If that player commits another foul, the opponent will be awarded one additional free throw under the same situation in addition to any free throws awarded, including offensive fouls, which normally are not assessed free throws.  Each such situation will be scored as a non-unsportsmanlike conduct technical foul.  These technical fouls are not for unsportsmanlike conduct, so they do not result in ejections from the game.\n\nThis rule let [[Don Otten]] set the NBA record for personal fouls in a regular-season game.

The McHugh Gymnasium was built in front of Adelphia Hall and opened in 1983, a result of the school's first major fundraising campaign. Funds from this campaign were used to remodel the third floor of Adelphia Hall for improved science facilities.

Also construction was completed on the Thomas Healy, S.J., Theater and Classrooms.  This was the first major renovation since the addition of St. Ignatius Hall.  The  theater, which also accommodates school Masses, features an orchestra pit with hydraulics moving it up and down for various uses, including the transportation of heavy equipment.  The workout rooms and locker rooms were also altered in this remodel.  The space below the theater is used for arts classes, a sacristy (to be used for liturgies and Masses), and weight/workout rooms. In 2008, sections of pathway around the campus plaza were redone and electronic doors were installed on several major entrances.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Notable alumni==\n<!--ENTRIES ON THIS LIST SHOULD EITHER HAVE AN ACCOMPANYING EXISTING ARTICLE LINK WHICH VERIFIES THEY ARE AN ALUMNUS, OR RELIABLE SOURCES AS FOOTNOTES AGAINST THE NAME.-->\n* [[Bob Bellinger]], American football player\n* [[Bryce Fisher]], former NFL defensive lineman (1999\u20132008) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/players/brycefisher/profile?id=FIS192130 |title=Bryce Fisher |publisher=NFL.com |date=1977-12-05 |accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref>\n* [[Tom Gorman (tennis)|Tom Gorman]], former professional tennis player {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n* [[Spencer Hawes]], professional NBA basketball player, [[Milwaukee Bucks]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/playerfile/spencer_hawes/ |title=Spencer Hawes Info Page |publisher=NBA.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref>\n* [[Don Kardong]], Olympic marathon runner {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n* [[Amanda Knox]], convicted of murdering a fellow student in Italy, conviction later overturned<ref>{{cite book |last=Follain |first=J. |title=Death in Perugia: The Definitive Account of the Meredith Kercher Case from Her Murder to the Acquittal of Raffaele Sollecito and Amanda Knox |publisher=St. Martin's True Crime |date=2011 |isbn=978-0-340-99309-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/deathinperugia0002foll/page/13 13\u201315] |url=https://archive.org/details/deathinperugia0002foll/page/13 }}</ref>\n* [[Joe Lombardi]], NFL offensive coordinator, [[Detroit Lions]] <ref name=aggnsptr>{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-10-29/sports/8901270196_1_joe-lombardi-special-treatment-vince-lombardi |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |agency=(Seattle Times) |last=Peoples |first=John |title=Lombardi's grandson gets no special treatment |date=October 29, 1989 |accessdate=September 22, 2014}}</ref><ref name=jlbonleg>{{cite web |url=http://www.packersnews.com/story/sports/columnists/dougherty/2014/09/18/joe-lombardi-building-legacy/15868371/ |publisher=Packer News |title=Joe Lombardi building own NFL legacy |last=Dougherty |first=Pete |agency=Press-Gazette Media |date=September 18, 2014 |accessdate=September 22, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Mike McGavick]], former CEO of [[Safeco]] and former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate for the [[United States Senate]] {{Citation needed|reason=Previous footnote was a circular reference to WP using answers.com|date=July 2010}}\n* [[John McKay (attorney)|John McKay]], former US Attorney for the Western District Of Washington <ref>[http://www.law.seattleu.edu/x2991.xml McKay]</ref>  \n* [[Greg Nickels]], former mayor of [[Seattle]] (2002\u20132010) <ref name=\"Greg Nickels\">{{cite web|url=http://www.seattle.gov/mayor/about/bio.htm|title=ABOUT MAYOR GREGORY J.

The McHugh Gymnasium was built in front of Adelphia Hall and opened in 1983, a result of the school's first major fundraising campaign. Funds from this campaign were used to remodel the third floor of Adelphia Hall for improved science facilities. During this time the library, which then became known as Loyola Library, was moved to Peyton Hall.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThere were several major additions to Seattle Prep in the late 1990s. A new underground parking garage was built to replace the old parking lot, which was replaced by a grass [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quad]]. In addition, St. Ignatius Hall was erected across from Peyton and McDonnell Halls.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Chapel10.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Thomas Healy SJ Theater]]\n\nIn 2007, the PACCAR Commons (Donated by the Pigott family) were completed, including new office space with reception desks and also a sick room. Also construction was completed on the Thomas Healy, S.J., Theater and Classrooms.  This was the first major renovation since the addition of St. Ignatius Hall.  The  theater, which also accommodates school Masses, features an orchestra pit with hydraulics moving it up and down for various uses, including the transportation of heavy equipment.  The workout rooms and locker rooms were also altered in this remodel.  The space below the theater is used for arts classes, a sacristy (to be used for liturgies and Masses), and weight/workout rooms. In 2008, sections of pathway around the campus plaza were redone and electronic doors were installed on several major entrances.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Notable alumni==\n<!--ENTRIES ON THIS LIST SHOULD EITHER HAVE AN ACCOMPANYING EXISTING ARTICLE LINK WHICH VERIFIES THEY ARE AN ALUMNUS, OR RELIABLE SOURCES AS FOOTNOTES AGAINST THE NAME.-->\n* [[Bob Bellinger]], American football player\n* [[Bryce Fisher]], former NFL defensive lineman (1999\u20132008) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/players/brycefisher/profile?id=FIS192130 |title=Bryce Fisher |publisher=NFL.com |date=1977-12-05 |accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref>\n* [[Tom Gorman (tennis)|Tom Gorman]], former professional tennis player {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n* [[Spencer Hawes]], professional NBA basketball player, [[Milwaukee Bucks]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/playerfile/spencer_hawes/ |title=Spencer Hawes Info Page |publisher=NBA.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref>\n* [[Don Kardong]], Olympic marathon runner {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n* [[Amanda Knox]], convicted of murdering a fellow student in Italy, conviction later overturned<ref>{{cite book |last=Follain |first=J. |title=Death in Perugia: The Definitive Account of the Meredith Kercher Case from Her Murder to the Acquittal of Raffaele Sollecito and Amanda Knox |publisher=St. Martin's True Crime |date=2011 |isbn=978-0-340-99309-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/deathinperugia0002foll/page/13 13\u201315] |url=https://archive.org/details/deathinperugia0002foll/page/13 }}</ref>\n* [[Joe Lombardi]], NFL offensive coordinator, [[Detroit Lions]] <ref name=aggnsptr>{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-10-29/sports/8901270196_1_joe-lombardi-special-treatment-vince-lombardi |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |agency=(Seattle Times) |last=Peoples |first=John |title=Lombardi's grandson gets no special treatment |date=October 29, 1989 |accessdate=September 22, 2014}}</ref><ref name=jlbonleg>{{cite web |url=http://www.packersnews.com/story/sports/columnists/dougherty/2014/09/18/joe-lombardi-building-legacy/15868371/ |publisher=Packer News |title=Joe Lombardi building own NFL legacy |last=Dougherty |first=Pete |agency=Press-Gazette Media |date=September 18, 2014 |accessdate=September 22, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Mike McGavick]], former CEO of [[Safeco]] and former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate for the [[United States Senate]] {{Citation needed|reason=Previous footnote was a circular reference to WP using answers.com|date=July 2010}}\n* [[John McKay (attorney)|John McKay]], former US Attorney for the Western District Of Washington <ref>[http://www.law.seattleu.edu/x2991.xml McKay]</ref>  \n* [[Greg Nickels]], former mayor of [[Seattle]] (2002\u20132010) <ref name=\"Greg Nickels\">{{cite web|url=http://www.seattle.gov/mayor/about/bio.htm|title=ABOUT MAYOR GREGORY J.
