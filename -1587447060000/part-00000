The lookout was situated on the southern of the two peaks, offering the lookout staff a wide view over the entire [[Big Sur River]] watershed to the south, most of the [[Little Sur River]] watershed to the west and north west, and most of the Carmel River watershed to the east and south east.<ref name=\"dcq\">{{cite web |title=DCQ Winter Solstice '98 - Ventana Double Cone Lookout |url=https://www.ventanawild.org/news/ws98/dclook.html |website=www.ventanawild.org |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Bottchers Gap]] Guard Station was built in 1950, the Double Cone Trail was constructed that connected to the Rattlesnake Creek trail.

They also became part of other variety programs like ''Minna no Terebi'' and ''KAT-TUNx3''. KAT-TUN even became special supporters for the ''FIVB World Grand Champions Cup'' in 2005, wherein their song \"Gloria\" served as its theme song.\n\nFrom 2005 to January 2007, KAT-TUN was a regular participant in the variety show ''[[Utawara Hot Hit 10]]'' with [[Jun Matsumoto]]. From October 8, 2006, members Tanaka Koki & Nakamaru Yuichi hosted the show [[YouTachi! YOU\u305f\u3061!]] together, until the show ended on September 30, 2007.\n\nFrom April 4, 2007, KAT-TUN then began hosting their own talk show ''[[Cartoon KAT-TUN]]'' every Wednesday until March 24, 2010, comprising a total of 152 episodes. This was their last regular show as a 6-member group.\n\nAfter becoming a 5-member group, their next TV show titled ''KAT-TUN no Zettai Manetaku Naru TV'' began on October 18, 2011 on [[Nippon TV|NTV]] and lasted only for a total of 10 episodes, with the show's finale on December 20, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=KAT-TUN\u306e\u7d76\u5bfe\u30de\u30cd\u305f\u304f\u306a\u308bTV|url=http://www.ntv.co.jp/kzm/index.html|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=Japanese|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407193359/http://www.ntv.co.jp/kzm/index.html|archivedate=7 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nKAT-TUN then also had a one-off TV special titled ''KAT-TUN no Sekaiichi Dame Yoru Ni'' which was aired on the night of January 1, 2012 on [[TBS Television|TBS]]. It was soon followed by another special episode on April 3, 2012. Following the success of the two special episodes of the show, it became KAT-TUN's third regular TV show.

Yuichi Nakamaru and Tatsuya Ueda hosted ''R-One KAT-TUN'' every Tuesday from 12am \u2013 12:30am.\n\nKazuya Kamenashi had his own radio show called ''Kamenashi Kazuya - Kase by Kase'' until it ended on September 20. He has a new radio show called ''Kamenashi Kazuya - Hang Out'' and currently airs every Saturday from 10:20am \u2013 10:50am.\n\nTaguchi Junnosuke also had his own radio show called \"Tag-tune driving\" and a radio show together with Yuichi Nakamaru called \"KAT-TUN no Gats\u016bn\" from April 2012 and ended in March 2016.\n\n===Musicals===\nAs a group, KAT-TUN has appeared in [[Koichi Domoto]]'s ''[[Shock (musical)|Shock]]'' musical, ''Summary of Johnnys World'' with NEWS and [[Ya-ya-yah]] and Johnny's long-running ''Dream Boys'' musicals from 2004 to 2006.\n\nSince 2004, member Kazuya Kamenashi has played the lead role in ''Dream Boys'' musicals consecutively each year, after senior [[Hideaki Takizawa]] handed down the role to Kamenashi.\nKamenashi and fellow KAT-TUN member Koki Tanaka paired up to play the lead roles for the shows held in 2007 and 2008. The pair collaborated once again as the leads for the 2011 shows alongside fellow KAT-TUN member Yuichi Nakamaru. The 2012 shows for the musical began in September, and once again Kamenashi reprised his role as the lead for the musical.\n\n===Concerts===\nSince their first concert in 2002, granted after overwhelming numbers of fan requests to Johnny's, KAT-TUN regularly holds concerts during almost every season of the year in Japan. This has helped them gain more popularity with their fans. It was considered remarkable for a Johnny's group which had not yet officially debuted to be able to hold its own concerts.\n\nKAT-TUN was the first Japanese artist to perform for four days in a row at Tokyo Dome during their ''Queen of Pirates'' tour. The following year, they broke their own record becoming the first artists ever to perform for eight consecutive days at Tokyo Dome during their ''Break The Records: By You & For You 2009'' tour. Now, Johnny & Associates submitted this new record to [[Guinness Book of World Records]] for KAT-TUN to be recognized as the Japanese boy band who broke the records in Tokyo Dome performances.<ref name=\"guinness\">{{cite web|title=KAT-TUN concerts may qualify for Guinness|url=http://www.tokyograph.com/news/id-4850}}</ref>\n\nThe group (excluding Jin Akanishi) held their biggest ever concert tour in 2010 titled ''KAT-TUN -NO MORE PAI\u0418- WORLD TOUR 2010'' which consisted of concerts in many major cities across Japan. The tour also included concerts held in Taiwan and Korea; the first time the group has ever toured outside Japan for their official concerts. \nAlthough during their pre-debut years, KAT-TUN had on several occasions toured overseas with their senior groups, while they were still Johnny Jrs.\n\nTheir nationwide tour for 2012 titled ''KAT-TUN LIVE TOUR 2012 CHAIN'' began in Nagiita on Feb 11, they toured 12 cities across Japan including Sendai; which was one of the worst affected areas by the Tohoku earthquake & tsunami disaster back in March 2011.\n\n===Commercials===\nKAT-TUN regularly appeared in TV commercials to endorse for [[NTT docomo]], [[SKY PerfecTV!]], [[Rohto Pharmaceutical Co.|Rohto]] and [[Lotte (conglomerate)|Lotte]] from 2005 to 2009.\n\nSince 2010, member Kazuya Kamenashi endorses [[Panasonic Corporation|Panasonic]]'s Lamdash shaver and DOLTZ electric toothbrush, and [http://www.aoki-style.com/ AOKI] 3D slim suits. Kamenashi also endorses [http://www.beverage.co.jp/gogo/ KIRIN]'s 'Gogo no Kocha' tea since March 2012, and is endorsing [http://sours.jp/ SOURS Gummies] since early 2013.\n\nSince early 2011, the group together has endorsed [[Suzuki]]'s 'SOLIO' car, and has sung commercial theme songs for [http://www.sofina.co.jp/ Sofina] and Wing products.

Modern methods use an industrial [[food processor]] to produce large quantities for retail distribution. Freshly pounded taro without the addition of water is called ''pa\u2018i \u2018ai'' and is highly starchy and dough-like. Water is added to the ''pa\u2018i \u2018ai'' during mashing, and again just before eating, to achieve the desired consistency, which can range from highly [[Viscosity|viscous]] to liquid. As such, poi can be classified as \"one-finger\",  \"two-finger\", or \"three-finger\" depending on the consistency, alluding to how many fingers are required to scoop it up (the thicker the poi, the ''fewer'' fingers required to scoop a sufficient mouthful).<ref>Robert Trumbull,[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/31/travel/in-hawaii-poi-is-the-staff-of-life.html \"In Hawaii, Poi is the Staff of Life\"], \"The New York Times\", 31 Oct. 1982</ref>{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nPoi can be eaten immediately, when fresh and sweet, or left a bit longer to [[ferment]] and become sourer \u2013 it then develops a smell reminiscent of plain [[yoghurt]].

Poi was considered such an important and sacred aspect of daily Hawaiian life that Hawaiians believed that the spirit of [[Haloa (Hawaii)|H\u0101loa]], the legendary ancestor of the Hawaiian people, was present when a bowl of poi was uncovered for consumption at the family dinner table. Accordingly, all conflict among family members was required to come to an immediate halt.<ref>[http://www.grain.org/seedling/?id=441 GRAIN | Seedling | 2006 | Haloa]</ref>\n\nAlthough many of the world's people consume taro, only Hawaiians make poi.

Modern methods use an industrial [[food processor]] to produce large quantities for retail distribution. Freshly pounded taro without the addition of water is called ''pa\u2018i \u2018ai'' and is highly starchy and dough-like. Water is added to the ''pa\u2018i \u2018ai'' during mashing, and again just before eating, to achieve the desired consistency, which can range from highly [[Viscosity|viscous]] to liquid. As such, poi can be classified as \"one-finger\",  \"two-finger\", or \"three-finger\" depending on the consistency, alluding to how many fingers are required to scoop it up (the thicker the poi, the ''fewer'' fingers required to scoop a sufficient mouthful).{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nPoi can be eaten immediately, when fresh and sweet, or left a bit longer to [[ferment]] and become sourer \u2013 it then develops a smell reminiscent of plain [[yoghurt]]. A layer of water on top can prevent fermenting poi from developing a crust.\n\n==History and culture==\n[[File:Foot-prints of travel; or, Journeyings in many lands (1889) (14591199899).jpg|thumb|Hawaiians eating poi (1889)|alt=|left]]\n[[File:Hawaiian men pounding poi, c. 1890.jpg|thumb|Hawaiian men pounding poi (c. 1890)|alt=|left]]\n[[Taro]], a root vegetable thought to be native to [[Southern India]] and [[Southeast Asia]] and the primary poi ingredient, was highly regarded by Hawaiians, who believed that the taro plant (''kalo'') was the original ancestor of the Hawaiian people. Poi was considered such an important and sacred aspect of daily Hawaiian life that Hawaiians believed that the spirit of [[Haloa (Hawaii)|H\u0101loa]], the legendary ancestor of the Hawaiian people, was present when a bowl of poi was uncovered for consumption at the family dinner table.

There are at least 60 [[genera]] and 300 [[species]] altogether. Distributed in the [[temperate]] and warmer regions of the Earth, most are [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] animals; for example [[Europe]] has a mere 10 species, and only 2 of these occur outside the [[Mediterranean]] region.<ref name=Webb2018/>\n\n==Names==\nBroad-headed bugs are known as '''knobe''' in the [[Meto language|Meto]] and Funai [[Helong language|Helong]] languages of [[West Timor]], [[Indonesia]].<ref>[https://lexirumah.model-ling.eu/lexirumah/parameters/rice_ear_bug LexiRumah 2.2.3], \u2018rice ear bug\u2019/\u2018walang sangit\u2019.</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Alydidae by kadavoor.jpg|thumb|Riptortus sp. in [[Kerala]]]]\n[[File:DulichusInflatus.jpg|thumb|''[[Dulichius inflatus]]'', ant mimic]]\nBroad-headed bugs are up to {{convert|10|-|12|mm|1}} long, and have slender bodies. Some have long and very thin legs. The most notable characteristics of the family are that the head is broad, often similar in length and width to the [[pronotum]] and the [[scutellum (entomology)|scutellum]], and that the last [[antenna (biology)|antennal]] segments are elongated and curved. The [[compound eye]]s are globular and protruding, and they also have [[ocelli]]. The [[arthropod leg|femora]] of the hindlegs bear several strong spines; the tarsus has three segments. Most species have well-developed [[hemelytra]] (forewings), allowing them to fly well, but in some the hemelytra are vestigial. The membranous part of the hemelytra have several closely spaced long veins.\n\nAlydidae are generally of dusky or blackish coloration. The upperside of the [[abdomen#Invertebrates|abdomen]] is usually bright orange-red. this color patch is normally not visible as it is covered by the wings; it can be exposed, perhaps to warn would-be [[predator]]s of these animals' noxiousness: They frequently have scent glands that produce a stink considered to be worse than that of true stink bugs ([[Pentatomidae]]). The stink is said to smell similar to a bad case of [[halitosis]].\n\nSometimes the adults have  reduced wings. Both, nymphs and adults of some species, such as ''[[Dulichius inflatus]]'' and ''[[Hyalymenus]]'' spp. are [[ant mimic]]s and live in ant nests.<ref>{{cite journal|title=On the mimetic association between nymphs of ''Hyalymenus'' spp. (Hemiptera: Alydidae) and ants| author=Oliveira PO|year=1985| journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society| volume= 83| issue=4|pages=371\u2013384|doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1985.tb01182.x}}</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\nThese bugs mainly inhabit fairly [[arid]] and sandy [[habitat]], like seashores, [[heathland]], [[steppe]] and [[savanna]]s.

There are at least 60 [[genera]] and 300 [[species]] altogether. Distributed in the [[temperate]] and warmer regions of the Earth, most are [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] animals; for example [[Europe]] has a mere 10 species, and only 2 of these occur outside the [[Mediterranean]] region.<ref name=Webb2018/>\n\n==Names==\nBroad-headed bugs are known as '''knobe''' in the [[Meto language|Meto]] and Funai [[Helong language|Helong]] languages of [[West Timor]], [[Indonesia]].<ref>[https://lexirumah.model-ling.eu/lexirumah/parameters/rice_ear_bug LexiRumah 2.2.3], \u2018rice ear bug\u2019/\u2018walang sangit\u2019.</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Alydidae by kadavoor.jpg|thumb|Riptortus sp. in [[Kerala]]]]\n[[File:DulichusInflatus.jpg|thumb|''[[Dulichius inflatus]]'', ant mimic]]\nBroad-headed bugs are up to {{convert|10|-|12|mm|1}} long, and have slender bodies. Some have long and very thin legs. The most notable characteristics of the family are that the head is broad, often similar in length and width to the [[pronotum]] and the [[scutellum (entomology)|scutellum]], and that the last [[antenna (biology)|antennal]] segments are elongated and curved. The [[compound eye]]s are globular and protruding, and they also have [[ocelli]]. The [[arthropod leg|femora]] of the hindlegs bear several strong spines; the tarsus has three segments. Most species have well-developed [[hemelytra]] (forewings), allowing them to fly well, but in some the hemelytra are vestigial. The membranous part of the hemelytra have several closely spaced long veins.\n\nAlydidae are generally of dusky or blackish coloration. The upperside of the [[abdomen#Invertebrates|abdomen]] is usually bright orange-red. this color patch is normally not visible as it is covered by the wings; it can be exposed, perhaps to warn would-be [[predator]]s of these animals' noxiousness: They frequently have scent glands that produce a stink considered to be worse than that of true stink bugs ([[Pentatomidae]]). The stink is said to smell similar to a bad case of [[halitosis]].\n\nSometimes the adults have  reduced wings. Both, nymphs and adults of some species, such as ''[[Dulichius inflatus]]'' and ''[[Hyalymenus]]'' spp. are [[ant mimic]]s and live in ant nests.<ref>{{cite journal|title=On the mimetic association between nymphs of ''Hyalymenus'' spp. (Hemiptera: Alydidae) and ants| author=Oliveira PO|year=1985| journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society| volume= 83| issue=4|pages=371\u2013384|doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1985.tb01182.x}}</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\nThese bugs mainly inhabit fairly [[arid]] and sandy [[habitat]], like seashores, [[heathland]], [[steppe]] and [[savanna]]s.

Beginning with ''The Art of Bill Alexander and Lowell Speers'' Alexander teamed with other artists on PBS series' that ran from 1984\u20131992, included ''[[The Art of Bill Alexander & Robert Warren]]''. Alexander also teamed with painters Sharon Perkins and Diane Andr\u00e9.  Alexander and the second artist would alternate episodes, with both painters using the wet-on-wet method.  This series is often erroneously listed either as a series of books or as a single documentary.\n\nTV host and prolific painter [[Bob Ross]] studied under Alexander, from whom he learned his wet-on-wet technique, a method of painting rapidly using progressively thinner layers of oil paint.<ref>{{YouTube|id=oh5p5f5_-7A|title=Bob Ross: The Joy of Painting; A Walk in the Woods}}</ref> Ross dedicated the first episode of the second season of ''[[The Joy of Painting]]'' to Alexander, explaining that \"Years ago, Bill taught me this fantastic technique, and I feel as though he gave me a precious gift, and I'd like to share that gift with you [the viewer]\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{YouTube|id=GARWowi0QXI|title=\"The Joy of Painting with Bob Ross: Meadow Lake\", Season 2, Episode 1, 1 November 1983}}</ref> As Ross's popularity grew, his relationship with Alexander became increasingly strained.

Captured by Allied troops, he painted portraits of Allied officers' wives and he soon made his way to the United States.<ref>{{cite book | last = Alexander | first = William | title = The Bill Alexander Story: An Autobiography | year = 1983 | publisher = Kendall Hunt Pub Co | location = Dubuque, IA | isbn = 0-8403-2990-3 | pages = 244 | url = https://www.amazon.com/Bill-Alexander-Story-Autobiography/dp/0840329903/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1324890717&sr=1-1}}</ref>\n\n Bob Ross {{ }}==Career==give\nAfter World War II, Alexander became a refugee, and professional painter, pioneering the modern ''quick'' version of the [[wet-on-wet]] technique, and moving to North America. Later, he became a TV host on his painting education TV show.<ref name=PaintersOnline-2015-10-27/>\n\nAlexander is best known for the television program ''[[The Magic of Oil Painting]]'' (1974-1982), which ran on [[PBS]] in the United States. Beginning with ''The Art of Bill Alexander and Lowell Speers'' Alexander teamed with other artists on PBS series' that ran from 1984\u20131992, included ''[[The Art of Bill Alexander & Robert Warren]]''. Alexander also teamed with painters Sharon Perkins and Diane Andr\u00e9.  Alexander and the second artist would alternate episodes, with both painters using the wet-on-wet method.  This series is often erroneously listed either as a series of books or as a single documentary.\n\nTV host and prolific painter [[Bob Ross]] studied under Alexander, from whom he learned his wet-on-wet technique, a method of painting rapidly using progressively thinner layers of oil paint.<ref>{{YouTube|id=oh5p5f5_-7A|title=Bob Ross: The Joy of Painting; A Walk in the Woods}}</ref> Ross dedicated the first episode of the second season of ''[[The Joy of Painting]]'' to Alexander, explaining that \"Years ago, Bill taught me this fantastic technique, and I feel as though he gave me a precious gift, and I'd like to share that gift with you [the viewer]\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{YouTube|id=GARWowi0QXI|title=\"The Joy of Painting with Bob Ross: Meadow Lake\", Season 2, Episode 1, 1 November 1983}}</ref> As Ross's popularity grew, his relationship with Alexander became increasingly strained. In a 1991 interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', Alexander said of Ross, \"He betrayed me. I invented 'wet on wet'. I trained him, and he is copying me -- what bothers me is not just that he betrayed me, but that he thinks he can do it better.\"<ref>Stanley, A. (December 22, 1991).

In November 1990, Finkel played a tangential role in [[Curt Hennig]] defeating [[Kerry Von Erich]] to win the [[WWF Intercontinental Championship]] after he accepted a bribe from [[Ted DiBiase]] (whom Von Erich had recently attacked on ''The [[Bruce Prichard|Brother Love]] Show'') to let him take over as guest ring announcer for the match. DiBiase eventually helped Hennig win the title by hitting Von Erich with the championship belt and afterwards taunted Von Erich over his defeat.\n\n1992 saw the beginning of a feud with manager [[Bruno Lauer|Dr. Harvey Wippleman]], who regularly complained about Finkel's announcing. In 1992, Finkel was attacked by Wippleman's wrestler [[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala]]. At [[WrestleMania X]], Wippleman berated Finkel and tore off part of the announcer's tuxedo, who finally retaliated by pushing the manager to the ground. This led to Finkel's first match on January 9, 1995; on ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', he won a [[Professional wrestling match types|tuxedo match]] over Wippleman, by stripping him to his underwear.\n\nFinkel became involved in a feud between [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]] and [[Jeff Jarrett]], when Jarrett [[head shaving|shaved]] the already near-bald Finkel's head. This feud culminated in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Luchas de Apuestas|Hair versus Hair Match]] at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam 1998]], with Finkel in the corner of X-Pac. X-Pac won the match and Finkel assisted him in cutting Jarrett's hair.\n\nIn August 1999, Finkel became a lackey of the recently debuted [[Chris Jericho]].

Finkel ran down the aisle, shoving Chimel and ordering him to step aside. As Finkel started to announce, Chimel threw Finkel from the ring. While Jericho helped Finkel to the back, they crossed paths with [[Ken Shamrock]], who jostled with Jericho. Jericho convinced Finkel to distract Shamrock during his match. After Finkel berated Shamrock, Shamrock began twisting Finkel's finger, permitting Jericho to hit Shamrock from behind with a steel chair.

Similar effects occur in [[Tunisian crochet]].\n\n==Method==\nIllusion knitting uses two colours of yarn and is worked in stripes of two rows in each colour. Illusion knitting is based on the flat smooth [[stocking stitch]] and the raised [[garter stitch]]. It is this combination of textures which allows the image to be seen only from the proper angle.\n\nTraditionally, charts for illusion knitting  use four rows of knitting symbols to represent the stitches which the designer wishes to be seen. This makes the charts elongated and difficult to use for anything other than simple blocks of colour. These four rows make up two pairs where, in most cases, one pair is considered the opposite of the other. Where one pair has two rows of knit stitches, the other image pair has both knit and purl stitches.\n\nAs in [[mosaic knitting]], the knitter alternates between two colors.  Colors with good contrast are preferred but are not required.  The knitter knits two rows of color A, then two rows of color B, and repeats this throughout the body of the work.  Only knit or purl stitches are used.\n\n[[File:shadowknitpattern.gif|thumb|250px|This is a basic shadow knitting pattern created in [[Microsoft Excel]].]]\n\nEach row in the pattern, shown in the thumbnail to the right, represents four rows of knit or purl stitches, and each column represents one stitch.  To follow this pattern, a knitter would use black and white: white being the background color (BC), and black being the master color (MC).\n\n* Start at row one. This could be thought of as Row 1-1 and is a right-side row (RS).\n* Row 1-1 (RS): With BC, knit.\n* Row 1-2 (still following the pattern at row 1) (WS): Knit the blank boxes, purl the ones filled in.\n* Row 1-3 (RS): Change to MC, knit.\n* Row 1-4 (WS): Purl the blank boxes, knit the ones filled in.\n* Move to Row 2 on the pattern and begin knitting the BC. (This is row 2-1.) Repeat for all rows and bind off.\n\nThe visual effect of shadow knitting is due to the different height of the knit stitches on the wrong side rows.  A knit stitch is flat, while a purl stitch is raised.  Therefore, one can change which color (dark or light) stands out by changing from knit to purl.  So the basic idea is to create a pattern in knit stitches in the colors one wants and purl stitches in the background color.  When looking straight at the knitted piece, the stitches look approximately the same, but from an angle, only the raised purl stitches are visible.\n\nThere are no constraints on the position of the purl/knit stitches, so a nearly infinite variety of patterns can be made. The pattern will not be apparent from every direction of viewing, since one ridge may \"overshadow\" another. Knitters often enjoy watching when the picture created becomes visible. The stark contrast of alternating light and dark stripes is also visually interesting.\n\nExtensions of the method include using more than two colors or using other stitches; e.g., [[lace knitting]] or [[cable knitting]].\n\n== Viewing ==\nFor an illusion artwork to be effective it has to be able to be seen from a variety of angles. Generally, illusions that are designed to be viewed from the side are best. If the illusion hangs on the wall you can move around it and see the image appear and disappear. The illusion can be viewed equally well from the right and wrong sides. An illusion designed to be seen from the bottom would have to hang very high on the wall as you would probably never be able to see it from facing it directly. This type of illusion is best used on a flat surface.\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=Five views of Einstein Illusion\n|width=160\n|height=170\n|lines=0\n|align=center\n|File:Albert Einstein knitting illusion (1).jpg|\n|File:Albert Einstein knitting illusion (2).jpg|\n|File:Albert Einstein knitting illusion (3).jpg|\n|File:Albert Einstein knitting illusion (4).jpg|\n|File:Albert Einstein knitting illusion (5).jpg|\n\n}}\n\n== Creating  ==\n\n=== Charting ===\n[[File:Marilyn eye detail.PNG|thumb|Detail of chart showing Marilyn Monroe's eye]]\nSteve Plummer is a knitting artist who previously specialised in knitting wall-hangings and other items, primarily for the teaching of Mathematics. He approached illusion knitting from a mathematician's point of view and started to use a different method of charting.\n\nThese charts use a square grid and are created by laying the grid over an existing image then colouring in all the stitches that need to be seen as raised bumps. Throughout the charting process it is still possible to see the original image and there is no distortion. These charts are different because they allow the four rows of the traditional method to be condensed into two different rows of squares. They can be used for creating very simple images, if required, but also allow much more flexibility to create works of art. The old method allowed areas to show either light or dark; the new method allows for intermediate shading, still using just two colours and only one colour in each stripe. The amount of shading depends on the number of stitches that are raised compared to the number that are lowered.\n\nSome of Steve's illusions are quite large. His Mona Lisa is significantly bigger than the real thing. The size is dictated by the smallest detail he wants to see, which, in a portrait, may be the centre of the eye. This then has to become one raised bump (garter stitch) on the knitting and the ridge in front of it must lie flat so you can see over it (stocking stitch). The rest of the image is built around this detail.\n\nThe charting process takes perseverance, time and an amount of three-dimensional awareness. A chart can take up to 100 hours to produce. It is a process that can be learned by people with a little artistic ability and a lot of patience.\n\n=== Making and displaying ===\n\n:'''Yarn''': Illusions can be made using any smooth yarn in two contrasting colours. The same chart will work equally well in fine or  chunky yarn though the thicker yarn will create a much bigger piece of knitting and you may have to stand further back to get the best effect.\n\n:'''Needles''': The clearest images are created by knitting on needles slightly thinner than recommended for the weight of the yarn used. If the art work is to be a bed-cover or wearable it needs to remain soft and flexible so should not be knitted too tightly.\n\n:'''Markers''': It is essential to be able to keep your place on the chart so it helps to use markers to match to the grid lines, every 10 or 20 stitches.\n\n:'''Mounting pictures''': If a piece is to hang on the wall it can be mounted on a board which will ensure that it remains flat. It should be very slightly stretched to prevent sagging.\n \n:'''Mounting wearables''': Wearables, such as shawls, can be displayed on a bar with a strip of Velcro attached to it. They are easily removed for wearing.\n\n=== Combining with other knitting techniques ===\n\nIt is possible to combine illusion knitting with other textile techniques. Those listed below have been used successfully. There are probably many other possibilities.\n\n:'''Intarsia''' can be used to introduce extra colours, as in the illusion of Marilyn Monroe, which was inspired by Andy Warhol's screen prints. It has four different colours. The same method of charting is used as only two colours occur in any one section, although the four sections are knitted as one piece.\n\n:'''Modular knitting''' lends itself to illusions as small areas can be made separately then combined.\n\n:'''Mitred knitting''' works well. The charting method needs to be adapted slightly to accommodate the different directions of the knitting.\n\n== Geometric Illusion Art ==\n{{multiple image\n|image1=Cushions 1.jpg\n|caption1=Seen from an angle the cushions look alike\n|image2=Cushions 2.jpg\n|caption2=Seen from in front they are not the same\n}}\n\nIllusion Art does not have to be pictorial. It also lends itself to geometric works. Sometimes the same illusion can be created in different ways. It is much less successful for abstract art. The brain needs to be able to perceive an image and fill in the gaps, which would be extremely difficult with an abstract design.\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nIllusion Knitting Art is very new, the earliest exhibitions being held in 2010.\n\n===Steve Plummer and Pat Ashforth===\n*2010: [[University of Stirling]], [[Royal Horticultural Halls]], [[Herbert Art Gallery and Museum]] and other smaller venues.\n*2011: [[Science Museum (London)|London Science Museum]].\n*2011: [[Haworth Art Gallery]], UK: ''Einstein'' (above) was exhibited alongside 150 more conventional artworks at a juried exhibition and was voted the favourite piece, by visitors to the exhibition.\n*2012: [[Lafayette College]], Pennsylvania, USA.\n*2012 - 2013: [[Puzzling World]], Wanaka, NZ.\n*2012: Seven pieces by Steve Plummer acquired by [[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]].

It was written by [[Paul McCartney]] and [[John Lennon]]. The song was the Beatles' first number 1 hit on what became the [[UK Singles Chart|official UK singles chart]] but the second, after \"[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]]\", on most of the other singles charts published in the UK at the time. \"From Me to You\" failed to make an impact in the United States at the time of its initial release. Instead, a 1963 cover version released by [[Del Shannon]] resulted in the song becoming the first [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]] tune to enter the US pop charts.\n\n==Composition==\nLennon and McCartney began writing \"From Me to You\" while riding a [[Coach (vehicle)|coach]] heading to [[Shrewsbury]] as part of the Beatles' tour with [[Helen Shapiro]]. The title was inspired by the name of the letters section of the ''[[New Musical Express]]'', which they had been reading: \"From You to Us\".{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=94}} McCartney noted that their early songs tended to include the words \"I\", \"me\" or \"you\" in them, as a way of making them \"very direct and personal\" to the band's fans.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=148}}\n\nIn his 1980 interview with ''[[Playboy]]'', Lennon recalled writing the song:\n\n{{quote|We were writing it in a car I think, and I think the first line was mine. I mean I know it was mine. [''Hums melody of first line.''] And then after that we took it from there. It was far bluesier than that when we wrote it. The notes&mdash;today you could rearrange it pretty funky.{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=168}}}}\n\nBefore that interview, Lennon had stated, \"We nearly didn't record it because we thought it was too bluesy at first, but when we'd finished it and George Martin had scored it with harmonica, it was alright.\"{{sfn|Beatles In Their Own Words|1978}}\n\nMcCartney also talked about [[arrangement|rearranging]] the song in 1964:\n\n{{quote|\"From Me to You\"&mdash;it could be done as an old ragtime tune&mdash;especially the middle eight&mdash;and so we're not writing the tunes in any particular idiom. In five years' time we may arrange the tunes differently. But we'll probably write the same old rubbish!{{sfn|The Beatles Interview Database|2004}}}}\n \nSinger-songwriter [[Roger Greenaway]] recounted a story:{{elucidate|reason=What relevance does this story have with From Me to You?|date=September 2019}}\n\n{{quote|John and Paul were sitting at the back of the coach and [[Kenny Lynch]], who at this time fancied himself as a songwriter, sauntered up to the back of the coach and Kenny Lynch ... decided he would help them write a song. After a period of about half-an-hour had elapsed and nothing seemed to be coming from the back, Kenny rushed to the front and shouted, 'Well, that's it. I am not going to write any more of that bloody rubbish with those idiots. They don't know music from their backsides. That's it! No more help from me!'{{sfn|Cross|2005|pp=348\u2013349}}}}\n\nRegardless, the song was regarded by the Beatles as innovative and catchy enough to be released as a single. This was one Lennon\u2013McCartney song that the duo truly co-wrote; McCartney described it as \"very much co-written\".{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=148}}\n\n==Melody and lyrics==\n\"From Me to You\" comprises five verses and two bridges. The form is Intro V V B V V B V Coda. The first half of the fourth verse is instrumental. The last half of each verse is a mini-refrain, while the lyrics of the bridges are identical. The verses each consist of a rather short eight measures played in [[C major]]. In the bridge the song modulates to the subdominant (IV) key: [[F major]]. The tonic-subdominant modulation is almost a clich\u00e9, but Lennon & McCartney avoid the clich\u00e9 by going another route from I to IV than the standard I\u2013I<sup>7</sup>\u2013IV. At the bridge's climax, the chord changes are accompanied by \"woo!\" Another characterising element in the bridge is the [[augmented chord]] \u2013 a Gaug \u2013 that ends the bridge and leads back to home key (C major).{{sfn|Pollack|2001}} Lennon plays prominent [[harmonica]] solos during the beginning, middle and end of the song, as he did with \"[[Love Me Do]]\".\n\nMcCartney said of the song:\n\n{{quote|The thing I liked about \"From Me to You\" was it had a very complete middle. It went to a surprising place. The opening chord of the middle section of that song heralded a new batch for me. That was a pivotal song. Our songwriting lifted a little with that song.{{sfn|The Beatles Interview Database|2004}}}}\n\nThe idea of singing the song's opening lick\u2014the \"da da da da da dum dum da\" part\u2014was suggested by [[George Martin]], the Beatles' producer. The group thought it unusual but put their trust in Martin. \"In a way, this made [the Beatles] aware of George's enormous musical sense,\" EMI producer Ron Richards later said.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=387}}\n\nIn the song, the singer offers his love to the object of his affections\u2014he has \"everything that you want\". Although the song is based on first-person pronouns, it lacks a lead singer.\n\n==Recording and UK release==\n[[George Martin]] said of the song, \"I asked them for another song as good as '[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]]', and they brought me one\u2014'From Me to You.' ... There seemed to be a bottomless well of songs.\"<ref name=rollingstone>{{cite web|title=72 \u2013 'From Me to You'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-beatles-songs-20110919/from-me-to-you-19691231|work=100 Greatest Beatles Songs|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=17 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe recording on 5 March 1963 at [[Abbey Road Studios|EMI Studios]] in 6 takes with 7 edit pieces and went without a hitch and on 11 April [[Parlophone]] released \"From Me to You\" in the UK as a single, with \"[[Thank You Girl]]\" on the [[B-side]], catalogue number R5015.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|pp=28, 32, 200}} Nine days later, it kicked off a twenty-one week run in the British charts, reaching number one on 4 May, a position it would retain for seven weeks.\n\n\"From Me to You\" featured Lennon playing harmonica in a [[Jimmy Reed]]-inspired blues style he had learned from [[Delbert McClinton]], another American who was on the same bill with the Beatles in the early Sixties. \"It's chiseled in stone now that I taught Lennon how to play harmonica,\" McClinton said. \"John said, 'Show me something.' I was in a pretty unique position, because there just weren't a lot of people playing harmonica in popular music.\"<ref name=rollingstone />\n\n\"From Me to You\" was the first Beatles song to reach number one in the UK and is widely considered to be their first chart-topping song, for although \"Please Please Me\" reached the summit on almost every chart, it was only number two on [[Record Retailer]]'s chart, generally considered to be the most authoritative for the time. \"From Me to You\" would be the first of eleven consecutive British number one singles by the Beatles.\n\n\"From Me to You\" replaced [[Gerry and the Pacemakers]]' \"[[How Do You Do It]]\", a song that had been offered to the Beatles (and even recorded by them, though it remained officially unreleased until 1995) but ultimately rejected by them in favour of \"Please Please Me\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=18}} Gerry & The Pacemakers, who also hailed from [[Liverpool]], were very much rivals of the Beatles in their early days\u2014Gerry and the Pacemakers attained the first number one (\"How Do You Do It\") before the Beatles, and also claimed their second and third number ones before the Beatles did, slowly losing steam afterwards as [[Beatlemania]] launched and the Beatles dominated music worldwide in 1964.\n\nA true indication of how successful the Beatles became thanks to \"From Me to You\" (though it would soon be overshadowed by \"[[She Loves You]]\" and \"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]\") was expressed by McCartney: \"The first time I thought we'd really made it, was when I was lying in bed one morning, and I heard a milkman whistling 'From Me to You'. Actually, I'm sure that I once heard a bird whistling it as well. I swear I did!\"{{sfn|Cross|2005|pp=348\u2013349}}\n\n==First US release==\nWhen it released \"[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]]\" in the United States, [[Vee-Jay Records]] signed a licensing agreement giving it the right of first refusal on Beatles records for five years.{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=14}} Despite the failure of \"Please Please Me\" to catch on, Vee-Jay chose to release \"From Me to You\"; as a result, it was never turned down by [[Capitol Records|Capitol]], because it was never offered to them.{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=30}} \"From Me to You\" was released on Vee-Jay 522, with \"[[Thank You Girl]]\" on the B-side, on 27 May 1963.{{sfn|Wallgren|1982|p=17}} Even though ''[[Cash Box]]'' magazine called it a \"Pick of the Week\" when it was released, it initially failed even more miserably than its predecessor; through the end of June, \"From Me to You\" sold fewer than 4,000 copies and had failed to chart anywhere.{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=31}}\n\nWhen [[Del Shannon]] released a cover version of \"From Me to You\" on [[Bigtop Records]] in June, Vee-Jay tried to stimulate more interest in the original, both by placing magazine ads and by sending out additional promotional copies of the 45 stamped with the words \"The Original Hit\".{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=31}} But the biggest boost to the Beatles' version came from [[Dick Biondi]], who had played \"Please Please Me\" on [[WLS (AM)|WLS]] in [[Chicago]]. Biondi was fired by WLS in May and relocated to [[KRLA 1110]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] in June. He was able to convince his new employer to add \"From Me to You\" to its playlist, and it entered KRLA's \"Tune-Dex\" on 14 July,{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=31}} spending six weeks on the chart and peaking at 32 on 11 August.{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=41}}\n\nBecause of the airplay, and resulting sales, in Los Angeles, \"From Me to You\" made the ''Billboard'' [[Bubbling Under the Hot 100]] chart for three weeks, peaking at number 116 on 10 August, the same time the single peaked in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=31}} It was the first time the Beatles appeared on a national chart in ''Billboard''.{{sfn|Whitburn|2002|p=40}} The late attention in Los Angeles spurred sales of the 45; in the end, the original edition of \"From Me to You\" sold approximately 22,000 copies, roughly three times as many as \"Please Please Me\" had.{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=31}}\n\n==Second US release==\nVee-Jay chose to couple \"From Me to You\" with \"Please Please Me\" when it re-released the single on 3 January 1964,{{sfn|Wallgren|1982|p=22}} shortly after film of the Beatles had appeared on ''The [[Jack Paar]] Program'',  the [[NBC]] television [[prime-time]] version of Paar's previous ''\"[[Tonight Show]]\"'' .{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=90}} Had Vee-Jay known how all-encompassing [[Beatlemania]] would become, it likely would have saved \"From Me to You\" for use as an A-side, the way it did with \"[[Twist and Shout]]\" and \"[[Do You Want to Know a Secret]]\". But even as a B-side, \"From Me to You\" entered the ''Billboard'' chart on 7 March and peaked at number 41.{{sfn|Whitburn|2002|p=40}} The double-sided hit sold approximately 1.1 million copies in 1964.{{sfn|Spizer|1998|p=20}}\n\n==''Help!''==\nAn instrumental arrangement, \"From Me to You Fantasy\" is used in the film, ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', arranged by [[Ken Thorne]], and is track 3 of the original U.S. release of the soundtrack album. It appears during scenes of attempts to remove the ring from Ringo's finger while he sleeps in the Beatles' communal apartment.\n\n==Album availability==\n\"From Me to You\" made its first album appearance (overall) on the Canadian ''[[Twist and Shout (album)|Twist and Shout]]'' LP in 1964.  That same year, it made its US album debut on Vee-Jay's ''[[Jolly What!|Jolly What! England's Greatest Recording Stars: The Beatles and Frank Ifield on Stage]]''; its first appearance on a \"regular\" US Beatles album wouldn't come until 1973 when it appeared on the [[double LP]] compilation ''[[1962\u20131966]]''.    In 1966, \"From Me to You\" was first issued in the UK on ''[[A Collection of Beatles Oldies]]'', followed by the ''1962-1966'' compilation seven years later.  The first release on CD was in 1988 when it was included in the ''[[Past Masters]]'' compilation. It was later released on the ''1962-1966'' double CD and the single CD compilation ''[[1 (Beatles album)|1]].\n\n==Alternative mixes==\nThe mono version, which was issued as a single in 1963, has appeared on the 1988 issue of ''Past Masters'', the ''1962\u20131966'' CD reissues, the ''[[1 (The Beatles album)|1]]'' compilation released in 2000, and ''[[Mono Masters]]'' in 2009. The stereo version was included on the 1966 compilation ''A Collection of Beatles Oldies'', the original LP issues of ''1962\u20131966'' in 1973, and the 2009 reissue of ''Past Masters''.  The intro to the stereo version (recorded on two tracks) lacks the harmonica inserted into the mono mix.\n\n==Chart history==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1963\u201364)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Australian [[Kent Music Report]]<ref>{{cite book | title=Australian Chart Book (1940\u20131969) | author=Kent, David | publisher=Australian Chart Book | location=Turramurra | year=2005 | isbn=0-646-44439-5}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|9\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Ireland2|1|artist=The Beatles|song=From Me to You|accessdate=16 May 2016}}\n|-\n|New Zealand (''Lever Hit Parade'')<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hung|first1=Steffen|title=charts.nz - Forum - 1963 Chart (General)|url=https://charts.nz/forum.asp?todo=viewthread&id=46591&pages=|website=charts.nz|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Norway|9|artist=The Beatles|song=From Me to You|accessdate=16 May 2016}}\n|-\n|South Africa ([[Springbok Radio|Springbok]])\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|Swedish [[Sverigetopplistan|Kv\u00e4llstoppen Chart]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Swedish Charts 1962\u2013March 1966/Kv\u00e4llstoppen \u2013 Listresultaten vecka f\u00f6r vecka > Juni 1963|url=http://www.hitsallertijden.nl/charts/swedish%20charts/SwedishCharts1962-march66.pdf|publisher=hitsallertijden.nl|language=Swedish|accessdate=27 June 2018}}</ref>\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|5\n|-\n|{{singlechart|UK|1|date=8 May 1963|accessdate=16 May 2016}}\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Billboardhot100|41|artist=The Beatles|date=3 January 1964|accessdate=4 February 2020}}\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1963)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n|-\n|South Africa <ref>{{cite web|title=Top 20 Hit Singles of 1963|url=http://www.rock.co.za/files/sahits_1963.html|accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|UK <ref>[www.sixtiescity.net/charts/63chart.htm#top100 The 100 Best-Selling Singles of 1963]</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n|-\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Personnel==\n*[[John Lennon]]{{snd}}vocal, rhythm guitar, harmonica\n*[[Paul McCartney]]{{snd}}vocal, bass guitar\n*[[George Harrison]]{{snd}}lead guitar\n*[[Ringo Starr]]{{snd}}drums\n:Personnel per [[Ian MacDonald]]{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=77}}\n\n==Del Shannon cover==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = From Me to You\n| cover      = From_Me_to_You_-_Del_Shannon.jpeg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Del Shannon]]\n| album      =\n| B-side     = Two Silhouettes\n| released   = June {{Start date|1963}}<ref>''Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955\u20131990'' - ISBN 0-89820-089-X</ref>\n| format     = [[7-inch single]]\n| recorded   =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Rock and roll]]\n| length     = {{Duration|m=2|s=00}}\n| label      = [[Bigtop Records|Bigtop]]\n| writer     = [[Lennon\u2013McCartney#Lennon\u2013McCartney vs McCartney\u2013Lennon|McCartney\u2013Lennon]]\n| producer   =\n| chronology = [[Del Shannon]]\n| prev_title = [[Two Kinds of Teardrops]]\n| prev_year  = 1963\n| next_title = Sue's Gotta Be Mine\n| next_year  = 1963\n}}\nOn 18 April 1963, the Beatles were one of 15 acts to play at ''Swinging Sound '63'', an all-star concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[London, England|London]].

It was written by [[Paul McCartney]] and [[John Lennon]]. The song was the Beatles' first number 1 hit on what became the [[UK Singles Chart|official UK singles chart]] but the second, after \"[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]]\", on most of the other singles charts published in the UK at the time. \"From Me to You\" failed to make an impact in the United States at the time of its initial release. Instead, a 1963 cover version released by [[Del Shannon]] resulted in the song becoming the first [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]] tune to enter the US pop charts.\n\n==Composition==\nLennon and McCartney began writing \"From Me to You\" while riding a [[Coach (vehicle)|coach]] heading to [[Shrewsbury]] as part of the Beatles' tour with [[Helen Shapiro]]. The title was inspired by the name of the letters section of the ''[[New Musical Express]]'', which they had been reading: \"From You to Us\".{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=94}} McCartney noted that their early songs tended to include the words \"I\", \"me\" or \"you\" in them, as a way of making them \"very direct and personal\" to the band's fans.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=148}}\n\nIn his 1980 interview with ''[[Playboy]]'', Lennon recalled writing the song:\n\n{{quote|We were writing it in a car I think, and I think the first line was mine. I mean I know it was mine. [''Hums melody of first line.''] And then after that we took it from there. It was far bluesier than that when we wrote it. The notes&mdash;today you could rearrange it pretty funky.{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=168}}}}\n\nBefore that interview, Lennon had stated, \"We nearly didn't record it because we thought it was too bluesy at first, but when we'd finished it and George Martin had scored it with harmonica, it was alright.\"{{sfn|Beatles In Their Own Words|1978}}\n\nMcCartney also talked about [[arrangement|rearranging]] the song in 1964:\n\n{{quote|\"From Me to You\"&mdash;it could be done as an old ragtime tune&mdash;especially the middle eight&mdash;and so we're not writing the tunes in any particular idiom. In five years' time we may arrange the tunes differently. But we'll probably write the same old rubbish!{{sfn|The Beatles Interview Database|2004}}}}\n \nSinger-songwriter [[Roger Greenaway]] recounted a story:{{elucidate|reason=What relevance does this story have with From Me to You?|date=September 2019}}\n\n{{quote|John and Paul were sitting at the back of the coach and [[Kenny Lynch]], who at this time fancied himself as a songwriter, sauntered up to the back of the coach and Kenny Lynch ... decided he would help them write a song. After a period of about half-an-hour had elapsed and nothing seemed to be coming from the back, Kenny rushed to the front and shouted, 'Well, that's it. I am not going to write any more of that bloody rubbish with those idiots. They don't know music from their backsides. That's it! No more help from me!'{{sfn|Cross|2005|pp=348\u2013349}}}}\n\nRegardless, the song was regarded by the Beatles as innovative and catchy enough to be released as a single. This was one Lennon\u2013McCartney song that the duo truly co-wrote; McCartney described it as \"very much co-written\".{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=148}}\n\n==Melody and lyrics==\n\"From Me to You\" comprises five verses and two bridges. The form is Intro V V B V V B V Coda. The first half of the fourth verse is instrumental. The last half of each verse is a mini-refrain, while the lyrics of the bridges are identical. The verses each consist of a rather short eight measures played in [[C major]]. In the bridge the song modulates to the subdominant (IV) key: [[F major]]. The tonic-subdominant modulation is almost a clich\u00e9, but Lennon & McCartney avoid the clich\u00e9 by going another route from I to IV than the standard I\u2013I<sup>7</sup>\u2013IV. At the bridge's climax, the chord changes are accompanied by \"woo!\" Another characterising element in the bridge is the [[augmented chord]] \u2013 a Gaug \u2013 that ends the bridge and leads back to home key (C major).{{sfn|Pollack|2001}} Lennon plays prominent [[harmonica]] solos during the beginning, middle and end of the song, as he did with \"[[Love Me Do]]\".\n\nMcCartney said of the song:\n\n{{quote|The thing I liked about \"From Me to You\" was it had a very complete middle. It went to a surprising place. The opening chord of the middle section of that song heralded a new batch for me. That was a pivotal song. Our songwriting lifted a little with that song.{{sfn|The Beatles Interview Database|2004}}}}\n\nThe idea of singing the song's opening lick\u2014the \"da da da da da dum dum da\" part\u2014was suggested by [[George Martin]], the Beatles' producer. The group thought it unusual but put their trust in Martin. \"In a way, this made [the Beatles] aware of George's enormous musical sense,\" EMI producer Ron Richards later said.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=387}}\n\nIn the song, the singer offers his love to the object of his affections\u2014he has \"everything that you want\". Although the song is based on first-person pronouns, it lacks a lead singer.\n\n==Recording and UK release==\n[[George Martin]] said of the song, \"I asked them for another song as good as '[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]]', and they brought me one\u2014'From Me to You.' ... There seemed to be a bottomless well of songs.\"<ref name=rollingstone>{{cite web|title=72 \u2013 'From Me to You'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-beatles-songs-20110919/from-me-to-you-19691231|work=100 Greatest Beatles Songs|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=17 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe recording on 5 March 1963 at [[Abbey Road Studios|EMI Studios]] in 6 takes with 7 edit pieces and went without a hitch and on 11 April [[Parlophone]] released \"From Me to You\" in the UK as a single, with \"[[Thank You Girl]]\" on the [[B-side]], catalogue number R5015.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|pp=28, 32, 200}} Nine days later, it kicked off a twenty-one week run in the British charts, reaching number one on 4 May, a position it would retain for seven weeks.\n\n\"From Me to You\" featured Lennon playing harmonica in a [[Jimmy Reed]]-inspired blues style he had learned from [[Delbert McClinton]], another American who was on the same bill with the Beatles in the early Sixties. \"It's chiseled in stone now that I taught Lennon how to play harmonica,\" McClinton said. \"John said, 'Show me something.' I was in a pretty unique position, because there just weren't a lot of people playing harmonica in popular music.\"<ref name=rollingstone />\n\n\"From Me to You\" was the first Beatles song to reach number one in the UK and is widely considered to be their first chart-topping song, for although \"Please Please Me\" reached the summit on almost every chart, it was only number two on [[Record Retailer]]'s chart, generally considered to be the most authoritative for the time. \"From Me to You\" would be the first of eleven consecutive British number one singles by the Beatles.\n\n\"From Me to You\" replaced [[Gerry and the Pacemakers]]' \"[[How Do You Do It]]\", a song that had been offered to the Beatles (and even recorded by them, though it remained officially unreleased until 1995) but ultimately rejected by them in favour of \"Please Please Me\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=18}} Gerry & The Pacemakers, who also hailed from [[Liverpool]], were very much rivals of the Beatles in their early days\u2014Gerry and the Pacemakers attained the first number one (\"How Do You Do It\") before the Beatles, and also claimed their second and third number ones before the Beatles did, slowly losing steam afterwards as [[Beatlemania]] launched and the Beatles dominated music worldwide in 1964.\n\nA true indication of how successful the Beatles became thanks to \"From Me to You\" (though it would soon be overshadowed by \"[[She Loves You]]\" and \"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]\") was expressed by McCartney: \"The first time I thought we'd really made it, was when I was lying in bed one morning, and I heard a milkman whistling 'From Me to You'. Actually, I'm sure that I once heard a bird whistling it as well. I swear I did!\"{{sfn|Cross|2005|pp=348\u2013349}}\n\n==First US release==\nWhen it released \"[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]]\" in the United States, [[Vee-Jay Records]] signed a licensing agreement giving it the right of first refusal on Beatles records for five years.{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=14}} Despite the failure of \"Please Please Me\" to catch on, Vee-Jay chose to release \"From Me to You\"; as a result, it was never turned down by [[Capitol Records|Capitol]], because it was never offered to them.{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=30}} \"From Me to You\" was released on Vee-Jay 522, with \"[[Thank You Girl]]\" on the B-side, on 27 May 1963.{{sfn|Wallgren|1982|p=17}} Even though ''[[Cash Box]]'' magazine called it a \"Pick of the Week\" when it was released, it initially failed even more miserably than its predecessor; through the end of June, \"From Me to You\" sold fewer than 4,000 copies and had failed to chart anywhere.{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=31}}\n\nWhen [[Del Shannon]] released a cover version of \"From Me to You\" on [[Bigtop Records]] in June, Vee-Jay tried to stimulate more interest in the original, both by placing magazine ads and by sending out additional promotional copies of the 45 stamped with the words \"The Original Hit\".{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=31}} But the biggest boost to the Beatles' version came from [[Dick Biondi]], who had played \"Please Please Me\" on [[WLS (AM)|WLS]] in [[Chicago]]. Biondi was fired by WLS in May and relocated to [[KRLA 1110]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] in June. He was able to convince his new employer to add \"From Me to You\" to its playlist, and it entered KRLA's \"Tune-Dex\" on 14 July,{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=31}} spending six weeks on the chart and peaking at 32 on 11 August.{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=41}}\n\nBecause of the airplay, and resulting sales, in Los Angeles, \"From Me to You\" made the ''Billboard'' [[Bubbling Under the Hot 100]] chart for three weeks, peaking at number 116 on 10 August, the same time the single peaked in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=31}} It was the first time the Beatles appeared on a national chart in ''Billboard''.{{sfn|Whitburn|2002|p=40}} The late attention in Los Angeles spurred sales of the 45; in the end, the original edition of \"From Me to You\" sold approximately 22,000 copies, roughly three times as many as \"Please Please Me\" had.{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=31}}\n\n==Second US release==\nVee-Jay chose to couple \"From Me to You\" with \"Please Please Me\" when it re-released the single on 3 January 1964,{{sfn|Wallgren|1982|p=22}} shortly after film of the Beatles had appeared on ''The [[Jack Paar]] Program'',  the [[NBC]] television [[prime-time]] version of Paar's previous ''\"[[Tonight Show]]\"'' .{{sfn|Spizer|2004|p=90}} Had Vee-Jay known how all-encompassing [[Beatlemania]] would become, it likely would have saved \"From Me to You\" for use as an A-side, the way it did with \"[[Twist and Shout]]\" and \"[[Do You Want to Know a Secret]]\". But even as a B-side, \"From Me to You\" entered the ''Billboard'' chart on 7 March and peaked at number 41.{{sfn|Whitburn|2002|p=40}} The double-sided hit sold approximately 1.1 million copies in 1964.{{sfn|Spizer|1998|p=20}}\n\n==''Help!''==\nAn instrumental arrangement, \"From Me to You Fantasy\" is used in the film, ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', arranged by [[Ken Thorne]], and is track 3 of the original U.S. release of the soundtrack album. It appears during scenes of attempts to remove the ring from Ringo's finger while he sleeps in the Beatles' communal apartment.\n\n==Album availability==\n\"From Me to You\" made its first album appearance (overall) on the Canadian ''[[Twist and Shout (album)|Twist and Shout]]'' LP in 1964.  That same year, it made its US album debut on Vee-Jay's ''[[Jolly What!|Jolly What! England's Greatest Recording Stars: The Beatles and Frank Ifield on Stage]]''; its first appearance on a \"regular\" US Beatles album wouldn't come until 1973 when it appeared on the [[double LP]] compilation ''[[1962\u20131966]]''.    In 1966, \"From Me to You\" was first issued in the UK on ''[[A Collection of Beatles Oldies]]'', followed by the ''1962-1966'' compilation seven years later.  The first release on CD was in 1988 when it was included in the ''[[Past Masters]]'' compilation. It was later released on the ''1962-1966'' double CD and the single CD compilation ''[[1 (Beatles album)|1]].\n\n==Alternative mixes==\nThe mono version, which was issued as a single in 1963, has appeared on the 1988 issue of ''Past Masters'', the ''1962\u20131966'' CD reissues, the ''[[1 (The Beatles album)|1]]'' compilation released in 2000, and ''[[Mono Masters]]'' in 2009.
