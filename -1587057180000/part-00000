A marriage was ended either because of a [[Get (divorce document)|divorce document]] given by the man to his wife, or by the death of either party. Certain details, primarily as protections for the wife, were added in [[Talmud]]ic times. \n\nNon-Orthodox developments have brought changes in who may marry whom. Intermarriage is not encouraged.\n\n==Overview==\n===Historic view===\nIn traditional [[Judaism]], [[marriage]] is viewed as a contractual bond commanded by God in which a man and a woman come together to create a relationship in which God is directly involved. ({{bibleref||Deut.|24:1|HE}}) Though procreation is not the sole purpose, a Jewish marriage is traditionally expected to fulfil the commandment to have children. ({{bibleref||Gen.|1:28|HE}}) In this view, marriage is understood to mean that the husband and wife are merging into a single soul, which is why a man is considered \"incomplete\" if he is not married, as his soul is only one part of a larger whole that remains to be unified.<ref>Babylonian Talmud, Yebomoth 62b.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/448425/jewish/Why-Marry.htm |title=Why Marry? |access-date=2007-12-19 |publisher=[[Chabad.org]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224153323/https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/448425/jewish/Why-Marry.htm |archive-date=2007-12-24}}</ref>\n\n===Recent non-Orthodox views===\nNon-Orthodox Jewish denominations, such as Reconstructionist, Reform, and Conservative Judaism, recognize same-sex marriage, and de-emphasize procreation, focusing on marriage as a bond between a couple.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/06/01/conservative-jews-approve-gay-wedding-guidelines/ |title=Conservative Jews approve gay wedding guidelines |publisher=Fox News |date=2012-06-01 |access-date=2013-09-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/2000/03/Text-Of-The-Reform-Judaism-Gay-Marriage-Resolution.aspx# |title=Text of the Reform Judaism Gay Marriage Resolution |publisher=Beliefnet.com |date=2011-02-17 |access-date=2013-09-10}}</ref> This view is considered as a diversion from the [[halakha|Jewish Law]] by the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] denominations, rather than as a legitimate, alternative interpretation.\n\n== Engagement ==\n{{Judaism}}\n\nIn [[Jewish law]], an [[engagement]] ('' kiddushin'') is a contract between a man and a woman where they mutually promise to marry each other, and the terms on which it shall take place.<ref>''The Principles of Jewish Law'', Ed [[Menachem Elon]], {{ISBN|0-7065-1415-7}}, p. 353.</ref> The promise may be made by the intending parties or by their respective parents or other relatives on their behalf.<ref>([[Nashim|Kiddushin]] 9b)</ref> The promise is formalized in a document known as the {{lang|he-Latn|Shtar Tena'im}}, the \"Document of Conditions\", which is read prior to the {{lang|he-Latn|badekin}}. After the reading, the mothers of the future bride and groom break a plate. Today, some sign the contract on the day of the wedding, some do it as an earlier ceremony, and some do not do it at all.\n\nIn [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] communities, marriages may be arranged by the parents of the prospective bride and groom, who may arrange a [[shidduch]] by engaging a professional match-maker (\"''shadchan''\") who finds and introduces the prospective bride and groom and receives a \"brokerage-fee\" for his or her services. The young couple is not forced to marry if either does not accept the other.\n\n== Betrothal and marriage ==\n\nIn Jewish law, marriage consists of two separate acts, called ''[[erusin]]'' (or ''kiddushin'', meaning ''sanctification''<!--BUT historic Jewish writers sometimes use ''kiddushin'' to refer to marriage as a whole, so for the sake of avoiding ambiguity don't use it in the article as a synonym for erusin-->), which is the [[betrothal]] ceremony, and ''nissu'in'' or ''[[chupah]]'', the actual [[Jewish wedding|Jewish wedding ceremony]]. ''Erusin'' changes the couple's interpersonal status, while ''nissu'in'' brings about the legal consequences of the change of status. In [[Talmud]]ic times, these two ceremonies usually took place up to a year apart; the bride lived with her parents until the actual marriage ceremony (''nissuin''), which would take place in a room or tent that the groom had set up for her. Since the Middle Ages the two ceremonies have taken place as a combined ceremony performed in public.\n\nAccording to the Talmud,<ref>Kiddushin 1:1</ref> ''erusin'' involves the groom handing an object to the bride - either an object of value such as a ring, or a document stating that she is being betrothed to him. In order to be valid, this must be done in the presence of two unrelated male witnesses. After erusin, the laws of [[adultery]] apply, and the marriage cannot be dissolved without a [[Get (divorce document)|religious divorce]]. After ''nisuin'', the couple may live together.\n\n== Matrimony ==\n\n=== Marital harmony ===\n{{Main|Shalom bayit}}\nMarital harmony, known as \"''shalom bayis'',\" is valued in Jewish tradition. The Talmud states that a man should love his wife as much as he loves himself, and honour her ''more'' than he honours himself;<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''[[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]]'' 76b</ref> indeed, one who honours his wife was said, by the classical rabbis, to be rewarded with wealth.<ref name=\"BaMe59b\">''[[Baba Metzia]]'' 59b</ref> Similarly, a husband was expected to discuss with his wife any worldly matters that might arise in his life.<ref name=\"BaMe59b\"/> The Talmud forbids a husband from being overbearing to his household,<ref>''[[Gittin]]'' 6b</ref> and [[domestic abuse]] by him<!--but not by her--> was also condemned.<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/> It was said of a wife that ''God counts her tears''.<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/>\n\nAs for the wife, the greatest praise the Talmudic rabbis offered to any woman was that given to a wife who fulfils the wishes of her husband;<ref>''[[Nedarim (tractate)|Nedarim]]'' 66b</ref> to this end, an early [[midrash]] states that a wife should not leave the home ''too frequently''.<ref>''[[Genesis Rabbah]]'' 65:2</ref> [[Tzniut|A wife, also, was expected to be modest]], even if the only other person present with her was her husband.<ref>''[[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]]'' 140b</ref> God's presence dwells in a pure and loving home.<ref>''[[Sotah]]'' 17a</ref>\n\n=== Conjugal rights and obligations ===\nMarriage obligations and rights in [[Judaism]] are ultimately based on those apparent in the [[Bible]], which have been clarified, defined, and expanded on by many [[posek|prominent rabbinic authorities]] throughout history.\n\nTraditionally, the obligations of the husband include providing for his wife. He is obligated to provide for her sustenance for her benefit; in exchange, he is also entitled to her income. However, this is a right to the wife, and she can release her husband of the obligation of sustaining her, and she can then keep her income exclusively for herself. The document that provides for this is the [[ketuba]].\n\nThe Bible itself gives the wife protections, as per Exodus 21:10, although the rabbis may have added others later. The rights of the husband and wife are described in tractate [[Ketubot (tractate)|Ketubot]] in the Talmud, which explains how the rabbis balanced the two sets of rights of the wife and the husband.\n\nAccording to the non-traditional view, in the Bible the wife is treated as a possession owned by her husband,<ref name=\"JewEncMar\">{{Jewish Encyclopedia |article=marriage |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=M&artid=213}}</ref> but later Judaism imposed several obligations on the husband, effectively giving the wife several rights and freedoms;<ref name=\"JewEncMar\"/> indeed, being a Jewish wife was often a more favourable situation than being a wife in many other cultures.<ref name=\"JewEncMar\"/> For example, the [[Talmud]] establishes the principle that a wife is entitled, but not compelled, to the same dignity and social standing as her husband,<ref name=\"Ket48a\">''Ketubot'' 48a</ref><ref name=\"Ket61a\">''Ketubot'' 61a</ref> and is entitled to keep any additional advantages she had as a result of her social status before her marriage.<ref name=\"Ket48a\"/><ref name=\"Ket61a\"/>\n\n==== In the Bible ====\n[[Biblical Hebrew]] has two words for \"husband\": ''ba'al'' (also meaning \"master\"), and ''ish'' (also meaning \"man\", parallel to ''isha'' meaning \"woman\" or \"wife\"). The words are contrasted in [[Hosea]] 2:18 (2:16 in Christian Bibles), where God speaks to Israel as though it is his wife: \"On that day, says the Lord, you will call [me] 'my husband' (''ish''), and will no longer call me 'my master' (''ba'al'').\"\n\nEarly nomadic communities practised a form of marriage known as ''[[Beena marriage|beena]]'', in which a wife would own a tent of her own, within which she retains complete independence from her husband;<ref name=\"WRSKinship167\">[[William Robertson Smith]], ''Kinship and Marriage in early Arabia'', (1885), 167</ref> this principle appears to survive in parts of early Israelite society, as some early passages of the Bible appear to portray certain wives as each owning a tent as a personal possession<ref name=\"WRSKinship167\"/> (specifically, [[Jael]],<ref>{{bibleverse||Judges|4:7|}}</ref> [[Sarah]],<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|24:26|}}</ref> and Jacob's wives<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|31:33-34|}}</ref>). In later times, the Bible describes wives as being given the innermost room(s) of the husband's house, as her own private area to which men were not permitted;<ref>{{bibleverse||Judges|15:1|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||Judges|16:9|}}</ref> in the case of wealthy husbands, the Bible describes their wives as having each been given an entire house for this purpose.<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Kings|7:8|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse|2|Kings|24:15|}}</ref>\n\nIt was not, however, a life of complete freedom. The descriptions of the Bible suggest that a wife was expected to perform certain household tasks: spinning, sewing, weaving, manufacture of clothing, fetching of water, baking of bread, and [[animal husbandry]].<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|29:9|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|2:16|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|2:19|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|8:13|}}</ref> The [[Book of Proverbs]] contains an entire [[acrostic]] about the duties which would be performed by a ''virtuous'' wife.<ref>{{bibleverse||Proverbs|31:10-31|}}</ref>\n\nThe husband, too, is indirectly implied to have responsibilities to his wife. The [[Torah]] obligates a man to not deprive his wife of food, clothing, or of sexual activity;<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|21:10|}}</ref> if the husband does not provide the first wife with these things, she is to be divorced, without cost to her.<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|21:11|}}</ref> The Talmud interprets this as a requirement for a man to provide food and clothing to, and have sex with, each of his wives, even if he only has one.<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\">{{Jewish Encyclopedia |article=Husband and Wife |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=H&artid=986}}</ref>\n\nAs a [[Polygyny|polygynous]]<!--this is NOT a spelling mistake for 'polygamous'--> society, the Israelites did not have any laws which imposed [[monogamy]] on men.<ref name=\"CheyneAndBlackJeal\">{{EncyclopaediaBiblica |article=Jealousy, Ordeal of |section=Jannaeus-Jerah}}</ref><ref name=\"JewEncAdu\">{{Jewish Encyclopedia |article=Adultery |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=865&letter=A}}</ref> [[Adultery|Adulterous]] married women and adulterous betrothed women, and their male accomplices however, were subject to the [[death penalty]] by [[Adultery#In the Hebrew Bible|the biblical laws against adultery]],<ref>{{bibleverse||Ezekiel|16:40|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:10|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:22-25|}}</ref> According to the [[Priestly Code]] of the [[Book of Numbers]], if a woman was suspected of adultery, she was to be subjected to the [[Ordeal of the bitter water|Ordeal of Bitter Water]],<ref>{{bibleverse||Numbers|5:11-31|}}</ref> a form of [[trial by ordeal]], but one that took a miracle to convict. The [[literary prophets]] indicate that adultery was a frequent occurrence, despite their strong protests against it,<ref>{{bibleverse||Jeremiah|7:9|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||Jeremiah|23:10|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||Hosea|4:2|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||Malachi|3:5|}}</ref> and these legal strictnesses.<ref name=\"CheyneAndBlackJeal\"/>\n\n==== In the Talmud and Rabbinic Judaism ====\nThe Talmud sets a minimum provision which a husband must provide to his wife:<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/>\n* Enough bread for at least two meals a day\n* Sufficient oil for cooking and for lighting purposes\n* Sufficient wood for cooking\n* Fruit and vegetables\n* Wine, if it is customary in the locality for women to drink it\n* Three meals on each [[shabbat]] consisting of fish and meat\n* An [[Allowance (money)|allowance]] of a silver coin (Hebrew: ''ma'ah'') each week\n\n[[Beth din|Rabbinic courts]] could compel the husband to make this provision, if he fails to do so voluntarily.<ref>''Ketubot'' 77a</ref> [[Moses Schreiber]], a prominent 19th century halachic decisor, argued that if a man could not provide his wife with this minimum, he should be compelled to divorce her;<ref>Moses Schreiber, ''Hatam Sofer'' on ''[[Eben ha-'Ezer]]'', 131-132</ref> other Jewish rabbis argued that a man should be compelled to hire himself out, as a day-labourer, if he cannot otherwise make this provision to his wife.<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/>\n\nAccording to prominent Jewish writers of the Middle Ages, if a man is absent from his wife for a long period, the wife should be allowed to sell her husband's property, if necessary to sustain herself.<ref name=\"MaMiTI121022\">[[Maimonides]], ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', ''Ishut'' 12:10-22</ref><ref name=\"JabAshEbEz70\">[[Jacob ben Asher]], ''Eben ha-'Ezer'', 70</ref> Similarly, they argued that if a wife had to take out a loan to pay for her sustenance during such absence, her husband had to pay the debt on his return.<ref name=\"MaMiTI121022\"/><ref name=\"JabAshEbEz70\"/>\n\nIn order to offset the husband's duty to support his wife, she was required by the Talmud to surrender all her earnings to her husband, together with any profit she makes by accident, and the right of [[usufruct]] on her property;<ref name=\"Ket46b47b\">''Ketubot'' 46b-47b</ref> the wife was not required to do this if she wished to support herself.<ref name=\"Ket46b47b\"/> Although the wife always retained ownership of her property itself, if she died while still married to her husband, he was to be her heir, according to the opinion of the Talmud;<ref name=\"Ket46b47b\"/> this principle, though, was modified, in various ways, by the rabbis of the Middle Ages.<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/>\n\n===== Home and household =====\nIn Jewish tradition, the husband was expected to provide a home for his wife, furnished in accordance to local custom and appropriate to his status;<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/> the marital couple were expected to live together in this home, although if the husband's choice of work made it difficult to do so, the Talmud excuses him from the obligation.<ref>''Ketubot'' 61b</ref> Traditionally, if the husband changed his usual abode, the wife was considered to have a duty to move with him.<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/> In the Middle Ages, it was argued that if a person continued to refuse to live with their spouse, the spouse in question had sufficient [[grounds for divorce]].<ref>Maimonides, ''Mishneh Torah'', ''Ishut'' 14:1-16</ref><ref>Jacob ben Asher, ''Eben ha-'Ezer'', 76-77</ref>\n\nMost Jewish religious authorities held that a husband must allow his wife to eat at the same table as him, even if he gave his wife enough money to provide for herself.<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/> By contrast, if a husband mistreated his wife, or lived in a disreputable neighbourhood, the Jewish religious authorities would permit the wife to move to another home elsewhere, and would compel the husband to finance her life there.<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/>\n\nExpanding on the household tasks which the Bible implies a wife should undertake,<ref name=\"JewEncMar\"/> rabbinic literature requires her to perform all the housework (such as baking, cooking, washing, caring for her children, etc.), unless her marriage had given the husband a large [[dowry]];<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/> in the latter situation, the wife was expected only to tend to \"affectionate\" tasks, such as [[Making the bed|making his bed]] and serving him his food.<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/> Jewish tradition expected the husband to provide the bed linen and kitchen utensils.<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/> If the wife had young twin children, the Talmud made her husband responsible for caring for one of them.<ref>''Ketubot'' 59b</ref>\n\n===== Clothing =====\nThe Talmud elaborates on the biblical requirement of the husband to provide his wife with clothing, by insisting that each year he must provide each wife with 50 [[Zuz (Jewish coin)|zuzim]]'s-worth of clothing,<ref name=\"JewEncCos\">{{Jewish Encyclopedia |article=Costume |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=822&letter=C}}</ref> including garments appropriate to each [[season]] of the year.<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/> The Talmudic rabbis insist that this annual clothing gift should include one hat, one belt, and three pairs of shoes<ref>[[Ketubot (Talmud)|Ketubot]] 64b</ref> (one pair for each of the three main annual festivals: [[Passover]], [[Shabu'ot]], and [[Sukkoth]]<ref name=\"JewEncCos\"/>). The husband was also expected by the classical rabbis to provide his wife with jewellery and perfumes if he lived in an area where this was customary.<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/>\n\n===== Physical obligations =====\nThe Talmud argues that a husband is responsible for the protection of his wife's body. If his wife became ill, then he would be compelled, by the Talmud, to defray any medical expense which might be incurred in relation to this;<ref name=\"Ket46b47b\"/> the Talmud requires him to ensure that the wife receives care.<ref name=\"Ket46b47b\"/> Although he technically had the right to divorce his wife, enabling him to avoid paying for her medical costs, several prominent rabbis throughout history condemned such a course of action as ''inhuman'' behaviour, even if the wife was suffering from a prolonged illness.<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/>\n\nIf the wife dies, even if not due to illness, the Talmud's stipulations require the husband to arrange, and pay for, her burial;<ref name=\"Ket46a47b\">''Ketubot'' 46a-47b</ref> the burial must, in the opinion of the Talmud, be one conducted in a manner befitting the husband's social status, and in accordance with the local custom.<ref name=\"Ket46a47b\"/> Prominent rabbis of the Middle Ages clarified this, stating that the husband must make any provisions required by local burial customs, potentially including the hiring of mourners and the erection of a tombstone.<ref name=\"MaMiTorIs142324\">Maimonides, ''Mishneh Torah'', ''Ishut'' 14:23-24</ref><ref name=\"JabAshEbEz89\">Jacob ben Asher, ''Eben ha-'Ezer'', 89</ref> According to the Talmud, and later rabbinic writers, if the husband was absent, or refused to do these things, a rabbinical court should arrange the wife's funeral, selling some of the husband's property in order to defray the costs.<ref name=\"MaMiTorIs142324\"/><ref name=\"JabAshEbEz89\"/>\n\nIf the wife was captured, the husband was required by the Talmud and later writers to pay the ransom demanded for her release;<ref name=\"Ket51a\">''Ketubot'' 51a</ref><ref name=\"MaMiTorIs141822\">Maimonides, ''Mishneh Torah'', ''Ishut'' 14:18-22</ref><ref name=\"JabAshEbEz78\">Jacob ben Asher, ''Eben ha-'Ezer'', 78</ref><ref name=\"JKShuArYD25210\">[[Joseph Karo]], ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'', ''Yoreh De'ah'' 252:10</ref> there is some debate whether the husband was required only to pay up to the wife's market value as a slave,<ref>''[[Gittin]]'', 45a</ref> or whether he must pay any ransom, even to the point of having to sell his possessions to raise the funds.<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/> If the husband and wife were both taken captive, the historic Jewish view was that the rabbinic courts should first pay the ransom for the wife, selling some of the husband's property in order to raise the funds.<ref name=\"Ket51a\"/><ref name=\"MaMiTorIs141822\"/><ref name=\"JabAshEbEz78\"/><ref name=\"JKShuArYD25210\"/>\n\n===== Fidelity =====\nIn the classical era of the [[rabbi]]nic scholars, the death penalty for adultery was rarely applied. It forbids conviction if:\n* the woman had been raped, rather than consenting to the crime;<ref>''Ketubot'' 51b</ref>\n* the woman had mistaken the paramour for her husband;<ref name=\"JewEncAdu\"/>\n* the woman was unaware of the laws against adultery before she committed the crime;<ref name=\"JewEncAdu\"/>\n* the woman had not been properly warned. This requires that the two witnesses testifying against her warn her that the [[Torah]] prohibits adultery; that the penalty for adultery is death; and that she immediately responded that she is doing so with full knowledge of those facts. Even if she was warned, but did not acknowledge those facts immediately upon hearing them, and immediately before doing the act, she is not put to death. These conditions apply in all death-penalty convictions.<ref>Talmud, Ketubot 33a</ref>\n\nThese rules made it practically impossible to convict any woman of adultery; in nearly every case, women were acquitted.<ref name=\"JewEncAdu\"/> However, due to the belief that a priest should be untainted, a [[Kohen]] was compelled to divorce his wife if she had been raped.<ref name=\"JewEncAdu\"/><ref>''Yebamot'' 56b</ref>\n\nIn [[Talmud]] times, once the death penalty was no longer enforced (for any crimes)<ref>''Sanhedrin'' 41</ref> , even when a woman was convicted, the punishment was comparatively mild: adulteresses were flogged instead.<ref name=\"JewEncAdu\"/> Nevertheless, the husbands of convicted adulteresses were not permitted by the Talmud to forgive their guilty wives, instead being compelled to divorce them;<ref>''Sotah'' 6:1</ref> according to [[Maimonides]], a conviction for adultery nullified any right that the wife's ''[[Ketubah|marriage contract]]'' (Hebrew: ''ketubah'') gave her to a compensation payment for being divorced.<ref>Maimonides, ''Mishneh Torah'', ''Ishut'' 24:6</ref> Once divorced, an adulteress was not permitted, according to the Talmudic writers, to marry her paramour.<ref>''Sotah'' 5:1</ref>\n\nAs for men who committed adultery (with another man's wife<!--rather than with an unmarried woman-->), [[Abba ben Joseph bar Hama|Abba ben Joseph]] and [[Abba Arika]] are both quoted in the Talmud as expressing abhorrence, and arguing that such men would be condemned to [[Gehenna]].<ref>''Sotah'' 4b</ref>\n\n===== Family purity =====\n{{Main|Niddah}}\nThe laws of \"family purity\" (''tehorat hamishpacha'') are considered an important part of an Orthodox Jewish marriage, and adherence to them is (in Orthodox Judaism) regarded as a prerequisite of marriage. This involves observance of the various details of the menstrual [[niddah]] laws. Orthodox brides and grooms attend classes on this subject prior to the wedding. The niddah laws are regarded as an intrinsic part of marital life (rather than just associated with women). Together with a few other rules, including [[Keri|those about the ejaculation of semen]], these are collectively termed \"family purity\".\n\n===== Sexual relations =====\nIn marriage, conjugal relations are guaranteed as a fundamental right for a woman, along with food and clothing.<ref>[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/465161/jewish/The-Purposes-of-Marriage.htm The Jewish Way in Love & Marriage]</ref> This obligation is known as \"[[onah]]\".<ref>[http://www.jewfaq.org/sex.htm Judaism 101: Kosher Sex<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Sex within marriage is the woman's right, and the man's duty. The husband is forbidden from raping his wife, they are not to be intimate while drunk or while either party is angry at the other. A woman should be granted a ''[[Get (divorce document)|get]]'' (divorce) if she seeks it because her husband is disgusting or loathsome to her. If either partner consistently refuses to participate, that person is considered rebellious, and the other spouse can sue for divorce.<ref>[https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/maimonides</ref>\n\n== Age of marriage{{anchor|Child marriage}} ==\n\nCiting the primacy of the divine command given in Genesis 1:28, the time between puberty and age twenty has been considered the ideal time for men and women to be wed in traditional Jewish thought.

According to the [[National Jewish Population Survey|National Jewish Population Survey 2000-01]], 47% of marriages involving Jews in the United States between 1996 and 2001 were with non-Jewish partners. Jewish leaders in different branches generally agree that possible assimilation is a crisis, but they differ on the proper response to [[Jewish intermarriage|intermarriage]].\n\n; Attitudes\n* All branches of [[Orthodox Judaism]] do not sanction the validity or legitimacy of intermarriages.\n* [[Conservative Judaism]] does not sanction intermarriage, but encourages acceptance of the non-Jewish spouse within the family, hoping that such acceptance will lead to conversion.\n* [[Reform Judaism]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] permit total personal autonomy in interpretation of [[Halakha|Jewish Law]], and intermarriage is not forbidden. Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis are free to take their own approach to performing marriages between a Jewish and non-Jewish partner. Many, but not all, seek agreement from the couple that the children will be raised as Jewish. In other words, Judaism does not exist as a Law but as a voluntary lifestyle, to be tweaked as desired. This allows for any form of marriage to be officiated at by a Reform rabbi, so long as all parties involved label their lifestyle as Jewish.\n\nThere are also differences between streams on what constitutes an intermarriage, arising from their [[Who is a Jew|differing criteria for being Jewish]] in the first place. Orthodox Jews do not accept as Jewish a person whose mother is not Jewish, nor a convert whose conversion was conducted under the authority of a more liberal stream.\n\n{{Further information|Conservative Halakha#Restrictions on marriage}}\n\n== Marriage in Israel ==\n{{See also|Marriage in Israel}}\n\nIn [[Israel]], the only institutionalized form of Jewish marriage is the religious one, i. e., a marriage conducted under the auspices of the rabbinate. Specifically, marriage of Israeli Jews must be conducted according to Jewish Law ([[halakha]]), as viewed by [[Orthodox Judaism]]. One consequence is that Jews in Israel who cannot marry according to [[Jewish law]] (e. g., a [[kohen]] and a [[Divorce|divorc\u00e9e]], or a Jew and one who is not [[Who is a Jew?|halachically Jewish]]), cannot marry each other. This has led for calls, mostly from the secular segment of the Israeli public, for the institution of civil marriage.\n\nSome secular-Jewish Israelis travel abroad to have [[civil marriages]], either because they do not wish an Orthodox wedding or because their union cannot be sanctioned by ''halakha''. These marriages are legally recognized by the State, but are not recognized by the State Rabbinate.\n\nMarriages performed in Israel must be carried out by religious authorities of an official religion (Judaism, Islam, Christianity, or Druse), unless both parties are ''without religion''.\n\n== Divorce ==\n\nHalakha (Jewish law) allows for divorce. The document of divorce is termed a [[Get (divorce document)|''get'']]. The final divorce ceremony involves the husband giving the ''get'' document into the hand of the wife or her agent, but the wife may sue in rabbinical court to initiate the divorce. In such a case, a husband may be compelled to give the ''get'', if he has violated any of his numerous obligations;{{which|date=August 2016}} this was traditionally accomplished by beating and or monetary coercion.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The rationale was that since he was required to divorce his wife due to his (or her) violations of the contract, his good inclination desires to divorce her, and the community helps him to do what he wants to do anyway. In this case, the wife may or may not be entitled to a payment.\n\nSince around the 12th century, Judaism recognized the right of a wife abused physically or psychologically to a divorce.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/jewish-divorce-get-abuse/|title=Jewish Divorce: Get Abuse|website=My Jewish Learning|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n[[Conservative Judaism]] follows halacha, though differently than [[Orthodox Judaism]]. Reform Jews usually use an egalitarian form of the Ketubah at their weddings. They generally do not issue Jewish divorces, seeing a civil divorce as both necessary and sufficient; however, some Reform rabbis encourage the couple to go through a Jewish divorce procedure. Orthodox Judaism does not recognize civil law as overriding religious law, and thus does not view a civil divorce as sufficient. Therefore, a man or woman may be considered divorced by the Reform Jewish community, but still married by the Conservative community. Orthodox Judaism usually does not recognize Reform weddings because according to Talmudic law, the witnesses to the marriage must be Jews who observe halacha, which is seldom the case in reform weddings.\n\n=== Agunah ===\n{{Main|Agunah}}\nTraditionally, when a husband fled, or his whereabouts were unknown for any reason, the woman was considered an ''[[agunah]]'' (literally \"an anchored woman\"), and was not allowed to remarry; in traditional Judaism, divorce can only be initiated by the husband. Prior to modern communication, the death of the husband while in a distant land was a common cause of this situation. In modern times, when a husband refuses to issue a [[Get (divorce document)|''get'']] due to money, property, or custody battles, the woman who cannot remarry is considered a Michuseres Get, not an agunah. A man in this situation would not be termed a ''Misarev Get'' (literally, \"a refuser of a divorce document\"), unless a legitimate Beis Din had required him to issue a Get. The term ''[[agunah]]'' is often used in such circumstances, but it is not technically accurate.\n\nWithin both the Conservative and Orthodox communities, there are efforts to avoid situations where a woman is not able to obtain a Jewish divorce from her husband. The [[ketubah]] serves this function in [[Conservative Judaism]] in order to prevent husbands from refusing to give their wives a divorce. To do this, the ketubah has built in provisions; so, if predetermined circumstances occur, the divorce goes into effect immediately. <ref name=\":0\">Hoffman, Lawrence A. \u201cThe Jewish Wedding Ceremony.\u201d Life Cycles in Jewish and Christian Worship, University of Notre Dame Press, 1996, pp. 129\u2013153.</ref> After the fact, various Jewish and secular legal methods are used to deal with such problems. None of the legal solutions addresses the agunah problem in the case of a missing husband.\n\n== Same-sex marriage ==\n{{See also|Judaism and sexual orientation}}\n\n=== In antiquity ===\nThe [[Midrash]] is one of the few ancient religious texts that makes reference to [[same-sex marriage]]. The following teaching can be found twice in the Midrash:\n\n<blockquote>\"Rabbi Huna said in the name of Rabbi Joseph, 'The generation of the Flood was not wiped out until they wrote \u05d2\u05de\u05d5\u05de\u05e1\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea (either sexual hymns or marriage documents) for the union of a man to a male or to an animal.'\"<ref>Genesis Rabbah 26:5; Leviticus Rabbah 23:9</ref></blockquote>\nAnother important reference is found in the [[Babylonian Talmud]]:\n<blockquote>\"'Ula said: Non-Jews [litt. Bnei Noach, the progeny of Noah] accepted upon themselves thirty mitzvot [divinely ordered laws], but they only abide by three of them: The first one is that they do not write marriage documents for male couples, the second one is that they do not sell dead [human] meat by the pound in stores, and the third one is that they respect the Torah.'\" <ref>Chullin 92ab</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== In Orthodox Judaism ===\nOrthodox Judaism does not have a Jewish legal construct of same-gender marriage. While any two Jewish adults may be joined by a Jewish legal contract, the rites of kiddushin are reserved for a union of a man and woman. Orthodox Judaism does not recognize civil marriages to have theological legal standing, be they civil marriages between male and female, or between two adults of the same gender.\n\n=== In Conservative Judaism ===\nIn June 2012, the American branch of [[Conservative Judaism]] formally approved same-sex marriage ceremonies in a 13-0 vote.<ref name=\"SSM\">[http://www.philly.com/philly/news/religion/20120601_ap_conservativejewsapprovegayweddingguidelines.html?c=r Conservative Jews approve gay wedding guidelines]</ref>\n\n=== In Reform Judaism ===\nIn 1996, the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] passed a resolution approving same-sex civil marriage. However, this same resolution made a distinction between civil marriages and religious marriages; this resolution thus stated:\n\n: However we may understand homosexuality, whether as an illness, as a genetically based dysfunction or as a sexual preference and lifestyle - we cannot accommodate the relationship of two homosexuals as a \"marriage\" within the context of Judaism, for none of the elements of qiddushin (sanctification) normally associated with marriage can be invoked for this relationship.<ref>[http://mljewish.org/S.C.J/faq/18-03-08.html MLjewish.org]</ref>\n: The Central Conference of American Rabbis support the right of gay and lesbian couples to share fully and equally in the rights of civil marriage, and\n: That the CCAR oppose governmental efforts to ban gay and lesbian marriage.\n: That this is a matter of civil law, and is separate from the question of rabbinic officiation at such marriages.\n\nIn 1998, an ad-hoc CCAR committee on human sexuality issued its majority report (11 to 1, 1 abstention) which stated that the holiness within a Jewish marriage \"may be present in committed same gender relationships between two Jews and that these relationships can serve as the foundation of stable Jewish families, thus adding strength to the Jewish community.\" The report called for CCAR to support rabbis in officiating at same-sex marriages. Also in 1998, the Responsa Committee of the CCAR issued a lengthy ''teshuvah'' (rabbinical opinion)<ref>[http://www.ccarnet.org/cgi-bin/respdisp.pl?file=8&year=5756 CCARnet.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041217072309/http://www.ccarnet.org/cgi-bin/respdisp.pl?file=8&year=5756 |date=December 17, 2004 }}</ref> that offered detailed argumentation in support of both sides of the question whether a rabbi may officiate at a commitment ceremony for a same-sex couple.\n\nIn March 2000, CCAR issued a new resolution stating that \"We do hereby resolve that the relationship of a Jewish, same gender couple is worthy of affirmation through appropriate Jewish ritual, and further resolve, that we recognize the diversity of opinions within our ranks on this issue. We support the decision of those who choose to officiate at rituals of union for same-sex couples, and we support the decision of those who do not.\"\n\n=== In Reconstructionist Judaism ===\nThe [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association]] (RRA) encourages its members to officiate at same-sex marriages, though it does not require it of them.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Judaism}}\n* [[Jewish prenuptial agreement]]\n* [[Negiah]] (guidelines for physical contact)\n* [[Shadchan]] (matchmaker)\n* [[Tzniut]] (modest behavior)\n* [[Yichud]] (prohibitions of seclusion with the opposite sex)\n\n== References ==\n{{Commons category|Jewish weddings}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Marital life in Judaism}}\n{{Jewish life}}\n{{Jews and Judaism}}\n\n[[Category:Jewish marital law|Marriage]]\n[[Category:Judaism and society|Marriage]]\n[[Category:Judaism and sexuality|Marriage]]\n[[Category:Judaism and women|Marriage]]\n[[Category:Marriage]]\n[[Category:Judaism and children]]\n[[Category:Sexuality and age]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Isra\u00ebls-A Jewish Wedding-1903.jpg|thumb|260px|''A Jewish wedding'' ([[Jozef Isra\u00ebls]], 1903)]]\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Jewish Marriage Certificate - overall.jpg|thumb|260px |Jewish marriage certificate, dated 1740 ([[Brooklyn Museum]])]]\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn - Het Joodse bruidje.jpg|thumb|260px|''The Jewish Bride'' ([[Rembrandt]], 1662\u20136)]]\nThe Jewish view on marriage, historically, provided Biblically mandated<ref>Exodus 21:10</ref> rights to the wife which were accepted by the husband. A marriage was ended either because of a [[Get (divorce document)|divorce document]] given by the man to his wife, or by the death of either party. Certain details, primarily as protections for the wife, were added in [[Talmud]]ic times. \n\nNon-Orthodox developments have brought changes in who may marry whom. Intermarriage is not encouraged.\n\n==Overview==\n===Historic view===\nIn traditional [[Judaism]], [[marriage]] is viewed as a contractual bond commanded by God in which a man and a woman come together to create a relationship in which God is directly involved. ({{bibleref||Deut.|24:1|HE}}) Though procreation is not the sole purpose, a Jewish marriage is traditionally expected to fulfil the commandment to have children. ({{bibleref||Gen.|1:28|HE}}) In this view, marriage is understood to mean that the husband and wife are merging into a single soul, which is why a man is considered \"incomplete\" if he is not married, as his soul is only one part of a larger whole that remains to be unified.<ref>Babylonian Talmud, Yebomoth 62b.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/448425/jewish/Why-Marry.htm |title=Why Marry? |access-date=2007-12-19 |publisher=[[Chabad.org]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224153323/https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/448425/jewish/Why-Marry.htm |archivedate=2007-12-24}}</ref>\n\n===Recent non-Orthodox views===\nNon-Orthodox Jewish denominations, such as Reconstructionist, Reform, and Conservative Judaism, recognize same-sex marriage, and de-emphasize procreation, focusing on marriage as a bond between a couple.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/06/01/conservative-jews-approve-gay-wedding-guidelines/ |title=Conservative Jews approve gay wedding guidelines |publisher=Fox News |date=2012-06-01 |access-date=2013-09-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/2000/03/Text-Of-The-Reform-Judaism-Gay-Marriage-Resolution.aspx# |title=Text of the Reform Judaism Gay Marriage Resolution |publisher=Beliefnet.com |date=2011-02-17 |access-date=2013-09-10}}</ref> This view is considered as a diversion from the [[halakha|Jewish Law]] by the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] denominations, rather than as a legitimate, alternative interpretation.\n\n== Engagement ==\n{{Judaism}}\n\nIn [[Jewish law]], an [[engagement]] ('' kiddushin'') is a contract between a man and a woman where they mutually promise to marry each other, and the terms on which it shall take place.<ref>''The Principles of Jewish Law'', Ed [[Menachem Elon]], {{ISBN|0-7065-1415-7}}, p. 353.</ref> The promise may be made by the intending parties or by their respective parents or other relatives on their behalf.<ref>([[Nashim|Kiddushin]] 9b)</ref> The promise is formalized in a document known as the {{lang|he-Latn|Shtar Tena'im}}, the \"Document of Conditions\", which is read prior to the {{lang|he-Latn|badekin}}. After the reading, the mothers of the future bride and groom break a plate. Today, some sign the contract on the day of the wedding, some do it as an earlier ceremony, and some do not do it at all.\n\nIn [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] communities, marriages may be arranged by the parents of the prospective bride and groom, who may arrange a [[shidduch]] by engaging a professional match-maker (\"''shadchan''\") who finds and introduces the prospective bride and groom and receives a \"brokerage-fee\" for his or her services. The young couple is not forced to marry if either does not accept the other.\n\n== Betrothal and marriage ==\n\nIn Jewish law, marriage consists of two separate acts, called ''[[erusin]]'' (or ''kiddushin'', meaning ''sanctification''<!--BUT historic Jewish writers sometimes use ''kiddushin'' to refer to marriage as a whole, so for the sake of avoiding ambiguity don't use it in the article as a synonym for erusin-->), which is the [[betrothal]] ceremony, and ''nissu'in'' or ''[[chupah]]'', the actual [[Jewish wedding|Jewish wedding ceremony]]. ''Erusin'' changes the couple's interpersonal status, while ''nissu'in'' brings about the legal consequences of the change of status. In [[Talmud]]ic times, these two ceremonies usually took place up to a year apart; the bride lived with her parents until the actual marriage ceremony (''nissuin''), which would take place in a room or tent that the groom had set up for her. Since the Middle Ages the two ceremonies have taken place as a combined ceremony performed in public.\n\nAccording to the Talmud,<ref>Kiddushin 1:1</ref> ''erusin'' involves the groom handing an object to the bride - either an object of value such as a ring, or a document stating that she is being betrothed to him. In order to be valid, this must be done in the presence of two unrelated male witnesses. After erusin, the laws of [[adultery]] apply, and the marriage cannot be dissolved without a [[Get (divorce document)|religious divorce]]. After ''nisuin'', the couple may live together.\n\n== Matrimony ==\n\n=== Marital harmony ===\n{{Main article|Shalom bayit}}\nMarital harmony, known as \"''shalom bayis'',\" is valued in Jewish tradition. The Talmud states that a man should love his wife as much as he loves himself, and honour her ''more'' than he honours himself;<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''[[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]]'' 76b</ref> indeed, one who honours his wife was said, by the classical rabbis, to be rewarded with wealth.<ref name=\"BaMe59b\">''[[Baba Metzia]]'' 59b</ref> Similarly, a husband was expected to discuss with his wife any worldly matters that might arise in his life.<ref name=\"BaMe59b\"/> The Talmud forbids a husband from being overbearing to his household,<ref>''[[Gittin]]'' 6b</ref> and [[domestic abuse]] by him<!--but not by her--> was also condemned.<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/> It was said of a wife that ''God counts her tears''.<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/>\n\nAs for the wife, the greatest praise the Talmudic rabbis offered to any woman was that given to a wife who fulfils the wishes of her husband;<ref>''[[Nedarim (tractate)|Nedarim]]'' 66b</ref> to this end, an early [[midrash]] states that a wife should not leave the home ''too frequently''.<ref>''[[Genesis Rabbah]]'' 65:2</ref> [[Tzniut|A wife, also, was expected to be modest]], even if the only other person present with her was her husband.<ref>''[[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]]'' 140b</ref> God's presence dwells in a pure and loving home.<ref>''[[Sotah]]'' 17a</ref>\n\n=== Conjugal rights and obligations ===\nMarriage obligations and rights in [[Judaism]] are ultimately based on those apparent in the [[Bible]], which have been clarified, defined, and expanded on by many [[posek|prominent rabbinic authorities]] throughout history.\n\nTraditionally, the obligations of the husband include providing for his wife. He is obligated to provide for her sustenance for her benefit; in exchange, he is also entitled to her income. However, this is a right to the wife, and she can release her husband of the obligation of sustaining her, and she can then keep her income exclusively for herself. The document that provides for this is the [[ketuba]].\n\nThe Bible itself gives the wife protections, as per Exodus 21:10, although the rabbis may have added others later. The rights of the husband and wife are described in tractate [[Ketubot (tractate)|Ketubot]] in the Talmud, which explains how the rabbis balanced the two sets of rights of the wife and the husband.\n\nAccording to the non-traditional view, in the Bible the wife is treated as a possession owned by her husband,<ref name=\"JewEncMar\">{{Jewish Encyclopedia |article=marriage |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=M&artid=213}}</ref> but later Judaism imposed several obligations on the husband, effectively giving the wife several rights and freedoms;<ref name=\"JewEncMar\"/> indeed, being a Jewish wife was often a more favourable situation than being a wife in many other cultures.<ref name=\"JewEncMar\"/> For example, the [[Talmud]] establishes the principle that a wife is entitled, but not compelled, to the same dignity and social standing as her husband,<ref name=\"Ket48a\">''Ketubot'' 48a</ref><ref name=\"Ket61a\">''Ketubot'' 61a</ref> and is entitled to keep any additional advantages she had as a result of her social status before her marriage.<ref name=\"Ket48a\"/><ref name=\"Ket61a\"/>\n\n==== In the Bible ====\n[[Biblical Hebrew]] has two words for \"husband\": ''ba'al'' (also meaning \"master\"), and ''ish'' (also meaning \"man\", parallel to ''isha'' meaning \"woman\" or \"wife\"). The words are contrasted in [[Hosea]] 2:18 (2:16 in Christian Bibles), where God speaks to Israel as though it is his wife: \"On that day, says the Lord, you will call [me] 'my husband' (''ish''), and will no longer call me 'my master' (''ba'al'').\"\n\nEarly nomadic communities practised a form of marriage known as ''[[Beena marriage|beena]]'', in which a wife would own a tent of her own, within which she retains complete independence from her husband;<ref name=\"WRSKinship167\">[[William Robertson Smith]], ''Kinship and Marriage in early Arabia'', (1885), 167</ref> this principle appears to survive in parts of early Israelite society, as some early passages of the Bible appear to portray certain wives as each owning a tent as a personal possession<ref name=\"WRSKinship167\"/> (specifically, [[Jael]],<ref>{{bibleverse||Judges|4:7|}}</ref> [[Sarah]],<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|24:26|}}</ref> and Jacob's wives<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|31:33-34|}}</ref>). In later times, the Bible describes wives as being given the innermost room(s) of the husband's house, as her own private area to which men were not permitted;<ref>{{bibleverse||Judges|15:1|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||Judges|16:9|}}</ref> in the case of wealthy husbands, the Bible describes their wives as having each been given an entire house for this purpose.<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Kings|7:8|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse|2|Kings|24:15|}}</ref>\n\nIt was not, however, a life of complete freedom. The descriptions of the Bible suggest that a wife was expected to perform certain household tasks: spinning, sewing, weaving, manufacture of clothing, fetching of water, baking of bread, and [[animal husbandry]].<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|29:9|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|2:16|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|2:19|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|8:13|}}</ref> The [[Book of Proverbs]] contains an entire [[acrostic]] about the duties which would be performed by a ''virtuous'' wife.<ref>{{bibleverse||Proverbs|31:10-31|}}</ref>\n\nThe husband, too, is indirectly implied to have responsibilities to his wife. The [[Torah]] obligates a man to not deprive his wife of food, clothing, or of sexual activity;<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|21:10|}}</ref> if the husband does not provide the first wife with these things, she is to be divorced, without cost to her.<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|21:11|}}</ref> The Talmud interprets this as a requirement for a man to provide food and clothing to, and have sex with, each of his wives, even if he only has one.<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\">{{Jewish Encyclopedia |article=Husband and Wife |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=H&artid=986}}</ref>\n\nAs a [[Polygyny|polygynous]]<!--this is NOT a spelling mistake for 'polygamous'--> society, the Israelites did not have any laws which imposed [[monogamy]] on men.<ref name=\"CheyneAndBlackJeal\">{{EncyclopaediaBiblica |article=Jealousy, Ordeal of |section=Jannaeus-Jerah}}</ref><ref name=\"JewEncAdu\">{{Jewish Encyclopedia |article=Adultery |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=865&letter=A}}</ref> [[Adultery|Adulterous]] married women and adulterous betrothed women, and their male accomplices however, were subject to the [[death penalty]] by [[Adultery#In the Hebrew Bible|the biblical laws against adultery]],<ref>{{bibleverse||Ezekiel|16:40|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:10|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:22-25|}}</ref> According to the [[Priestly Code]] of the [[Book of Numbers]], if a woman was suspected of adultery, she was to be subjected to the [[Ordeal of the bitter water|Ordeal of Bitter Water]],<ref>{{bibleverse||Numbers|5:11-31|}}</ref> a form of [[trial by ordeal]], but one that took a miracle to convict.

name=\"CheyneAndBlackJeal\"/>\n\n==== In the Talmud and Rabbinic Judaism ====\nThe Talmud sets a minimum provision which a husband must provide to his wife:<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/>\n* Enough bread for at least two meals a day\n* Sufficient oil for cooking and for lighting purposes\n* Sufficient wood for cooking\n* Fruit and vegetables\n* Wine, if it is customary in the locality for women to drink it\n* Three meals on each [[shabbat]] consisting of fish and meat\n* An [[Allowance (money)|allowance]] of a silver coin (Hebrew: ''ma'ah'') each week\n\n[[Beth din|Rabbinic courts]] could compel the husband to make this provision, if he fails to do so voluntarily.<ref>''Ketubot'' 77a</ref> [[Moses Schreiber]], a prominent 19th century halachic decisor, argued that if a man could not provide his wife with this minimum, he should be compelled to divorce her;<ref>Moses Schreiber, ''Hatam Sofer'' on ''[[Eben ha-'Ezer]]'', 131-132</ref> other Jewish rabbis argued that a man should be compelled to hire himself out, as a day-labourer, if he cannot otherwise make this provision to his wife.<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/>\n\nAccording to prominent Jewish writers of the Middle Ages, if a man is absent from his wife for a long period, the wife should be allowed to sell her husband's property, if necessary to sustain herself.<ref name=\"MaMiTI121022\">[[Maimonides]], ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', ''Ishut'' 12:10-22</ref><ref name=\"JabAshEbEz70\">[[Jacob ben Asher]], ''Eben ha-'Ezer'', 70</ref> Similarly, they argued that if a wife had to take out a loan to pay for her sustenance during such absence, her husband had to pay the debt on his return.<ref name=\"MaMiTI121022\"/><ref name=\"JabAshEbEz70\"/>\n\nIn order to offset the husband's duty to support his wife, she was required by the Talmud to surrender all her earnings to her husband, together with any profit she makes by accident, and the right of [[usufruct]] on her property;<ref name=\"Ket46b47b\">''Ketubot'' 46b-47b</ref> the wife was not required to do this if she wished to support herself.<ref name=\"Ket46b47b\"/> Although the wife always retained ownership of her property itself, if she died while still married to her husband, he was to be her heir, according to the opinion of the Talmud;<ref name=\"Ket46b47b\"/> this principle, though, was modified, in various ways, by the rabbis of the Middle Ages.<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/>\n\n===== Home and household =====\nIn Jewish tradition, the husband was expected to provide a home for his wife, furnished in accordance to local custom and appropriate to his status;<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/> the marital couple were expected to live together in this home, although if the husband's choice of work made it difficult to do so, the Talmud excuses him from the obligation.<ref>''Ketubot'' 61b</ref> Traditionally, if the husband changed his usual abode, the wife was considered to have a duty to move with him.<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/> In the Middle Ages, it was argued that if a person continued to refuse to live with their spouse, the spouse in question had sufficient [[grounds for divorce]].<ref>Maimonides, ''Mishneh Torah'', ''Ishut'' 14:1-16</ref><ref>Jacob ben Asher, ''Eben ha-'Ezer'', 76-77</ref>\n\nMost Jewish religious authorities held that a husband must allow his wife to eat at the same table as him, even if he gave his wife enough money to provide for herself.<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/> By contrast, if a husband mistreated his wife, or lived in a disreputable neighbourhood, the Jewish religious authorities would permit the wife to move to another home elsewhere, and would compel the husband to finance her life there.<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/>\n\nExpanding on the household tasks which the Bible implies a wife should undertake,<ref name=\"JewEncMar\"/> rabbinic literature requires her to perform all the housework (such as baking, cooking, washing, caring for her children, etc.), unless her marriage had given the husband a large [[dowry]];<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/> in the latter situation, the wife was expected only to tend to \"affectionate\" tasks, such as [[Making the bed|making his bed]] and serving him his food.<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/> Jewish tradition expected the husband to provide the bed linen and kitchen utensils.<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/> If the wife had young twin children, the Talmud made her husband responsible for caring for one of them.<ref>''Ketubot'' 59b</ref>\n\n===== Clothing =====\nThe Talmud elaborates on the biblical requirement of the husband to provide his wife with clothing, by insisting that each year he must provide each wife with 50 [[Zuz (Jewish coin)|zuzim]]'s-worth of clothing,<ref name=\"JewEncCos\">{{Jewish Encyclopedia |article=Costume |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=822&letter=C}}</ref> including garments appropriate to each [[season]] of the year.<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/> The Talmudic rabbis insist that this annual clothing gift should include one hat, one belt, and three pairs of shoes<ref>[[Ketubot (Talmud)|Ketubot]] 64b</ref> (one pair for each of the three main annual festivals: [[Passover]], [[Shabu'ot]], and [[Sukkoth]]<ref name=\"JewEncCos\"/>). The husband was also expected by the classical rabbis to provide his wife with jewellery and perfumes if he lived in an area where this was customary.<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/>\n\n===== Physical obligations =====\nThe Talmud argues that a husband is responsible for the protection of his wife's body. If his wife became ill, then he would be compelled, by the Talmud, to defray any medical expense which might be incurred in relation to this;<ref name=\"Ket46b47b\"/> the Talmud requires him to ensure that the wife receives care.<ref name=\"Ket46b47b\"/> Although he technically had the right to divorce his wife, enabling him to avoid paying for her medical costs, several prominent rabbis throughout history condemned such a course of action as ''inhuman'' behaviour, even if the wife was suffering from a prolonged illness.<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/>\n\nIf the wife dies, even if not due to illness, the Talmud's stipulations require the husband to arrange, and pay for, her burial;<ref name=\"Ket46a47b\">''Ketubot'' 46a-47b</ref> the burial must, in the opinion of the Talmud, be one conducted in a manner befitting the husband's social status, and in accordance with the local custom.<ref name=\"Ket46a47b\"/> Prominent rabbis of the Middle Ages clarified this, stating that the husband must make any provisions required by local burial customs, potentially including the hiring of mourners and the erection of a tombstone.<ref name=\"MaMiTorIs142324\">Maimonides, ''Mishneh Torah'', ''Ishut'' 14:23-24</ref><ref name=\"JabAshEbEz89\">Jacob ben Asher, ''Eben ha-'Ezer'', 89</ref> According to the Talmud, and later rabbinic writers, if the husband was absent, or refused to do these things, a rabbinical court should arrange the wife's funeral, selling some of the husband's property in order to defray the costs.<ref name=\"MaMiTorIs142324\"/><ref name=\"JabAshEbEz89\"/>\n\nIf the wife was captured, the husband was required by the Talmud and later writers to pay the ransom demanded for her release;<ref name=\"Ket51a\">''Ketubot'' 51a</ref><ref name=\"MaMiTorIs141822\">Maimonides, ''Mishneh Torah'', ''Ishut'' 14:18-22</ref><ref name=\"JabAshEbEz78\">Jacob ben Asher, ''Eben ha-'Ezer'', 78</ref><ref name=\"JKShuArYD25210\">[[Joseph Karo]], ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'', ''Yoreh De'ah'' 252:10</ref> there is some debate whether the husband was required only to pay up to the wife's market value as a slave,<ref>''[[Gittin]]'', 45a</ref> or whether he must pay any ransom, even to the point of having to sell his possessions to raise the funds.<ref name=\"JewEncHusWif\"/> If the husband and wife were both taken captive, the historic Jewish view was that the rabbinic courts should first pay the ransom for the wife, selling some of the husband's property in order to raise the funds.<ref name=\"Ket51a\"/><ref name=\"MaMiTorIs141822\"/><ref name=\"JabAshEbEz78\"/><ref name=\"JKShuArYD25210\"/>\n\n===== Fidelity =====\nIn the classical era of the [[rabbi]]nic scholars, the death penalty for adultery was rarely applied. It forbids conviction if:\n* the woman had been raped, rather than consenting to the crime;<ref>''Ketubot'' 51b</ref>\n* the woman had mistaken the paramour for her husband;<ref name=\"JewEncAdu\"/>\n* the woman was unaware of the laws against adultery before she committed the crime;<ref name=\"JewEncAdu\"/>\n* the woman had not been properly warned. This requires that the two witnesses testifying against her warn her that the [[Torah]] prohibits adultery; that the penalty for adultery is death; and that she immediately responded that she is doing so with full knowledge of those facts. Even if she was warned, but did not acknowledge those facts immediately upon hearing them, and immediately before doing the act, she is not put to death. These conditions apply in all death-penalty convictions.<ref>Talmud, Ketubot 33a</ref>\n\nThese rules made it practically impossible to convict any woman of adultery; in nearly every case, women were acquitted.<ref name=\"JewEncAdu\"/> However, due to the belief that a priest should be untainted, a [[Kohen]] was compelled to divorce his wife if she had been raped.<ref name=\"JewEncAdu\"/><ref>''Yebamot'' 56b</ref>\n\nIn [[Talmud]] times, once the death penalty was no longer enforced (for any crimes)<ref>''Sanhedrin'' 41</ref> , even when a woman was convicted, the punishment was comparatively mild: adulteresses were flogged instead.<ref name=\"JewEncAdu\"/> Nevertheless, the husbands of convicted adulteresses were not permitted by the Talmud to forgive their guilty wives, instead being compelled to divorce them;<ref>''Sotah'' 6:1</ref> according to [[Maimonides]], a conviction for adultery nullified any right that the wife's ''[[Ketubah|marriage contract]]'' (Hebrew: ''ketubah'') gave her to a compensation payment for being divorced.<ref>Maimonides, ''Mishneh Torah'', ''Ishut'' 24:6</ref> Once divorced, an adulteress was not permitted, according to the Talmudic writers, to marry her paramour.<ref>''Sotah'' 5:1</ref>\n\nAs for men who committed adultery (with another man's wife<!--rather than with an unmarried woman-->), [[Abba ben Joseph bar Hama|Abba ben Joseph]] and [[Abba Arika]] are both quoted in the Talmud as expressing abhorrence, and arguing that such men would be condemned to [[Gehenna]].<ref>''Sotah'' 4b</ref>\n\n===== Family purity =====\n{{Main article|Niddah}}\nThe laws of \"family purity\" (''tehorat hamishpacha'') are considered an important part of an Orthodox Jewish marriage, and adherence to them is (in Orthodox Judaism) regarded as a prerequisite of marriage. This involves observance of the various details of the menstrual [[niddah]] laws. Orthodox brides and grooms attend classes on this subject prior to the wedding. The niddah laws are regarded as an intrinsic part of marital life (rather than just associated with women). Together with a few other rules, including [[Keri|those about the ejaculation of semen]], these are collectively termed \"family purity\".\n\n===== Sexual relations =====\nIn marriage, conjugal relations are guaranteed as a fundamental right for a woman, along with food and clothing.<ref>[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/465161/jewish/The-Purposes-of-Marriage.htm The Jewish Way in Love & Marriage]</ref> This obligation is known as \"[[onah]]\".<ref>[http://www.jewfaq.org/sex.htm Judaism 101: Kosher Sex<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Sex within marriage is the woman's right, and the man's duty. The husband is forbidden from raping his wife, they are not to be intimate while drunk or while either party is angry at the other. A woman should be granted a ''[[Get (divorce document)|get]]'' (divorce) if she seeks it because her husband is disgusting or loathsome to her. If either partner consistently refuses to participate, that person is considered rebellious, and the other spouse can sue for divorce.<ref>[https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/maimonides</ref>\n\n== Age of marriage{{anchor|Child marriage}} ==\n\nCiting the primacy of the divine command given in Genesis 1:28, the time between puberty and age twenty has been considered the ideal time for men and women to be wed in traditional Jewish thought.

According to the [[National Jewish Population Survey|National Jewish Population Survey 2000-01]], 47% of marriages involving Jews in the United States between 1996 and 2001 were with non-Jewish partners. Jewish leaders in different branches generally agree that possible assimilation is a crisis, but they differ on the proper response to [[Jewish intermarriage|intermarriage]].\n\n; Attitudes\n* All branches of [[Orthodox Judaism]] do not sanction the validity or legitimacy of intermarriages.\n* [[Conservative Judaism]] does not sanction intermarriage, but encourages acceptance of the non-Jewish spouse within the family, hoping that such acceptance will lead to conversion.\n* [[Reform Judaism]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] permit total personal autonomy in interpretation of [[Halakha|Jewish Law]], and intermarriage is not forbidden. Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis are free to take their own approach to performing marriages between a Jewish and non-Jewish partner. Many, but not all, seek agreement from the couple that the children will be raised as Jewish. In other words, Judaism does not exist as a Law but as a voluntary lifestyle, to be tweaked as desired. This allows for any form of marriage to be officiated at by a Reform rabbi, so long as all parties involved label their lifestyle as Jewish.\n\nThere are also differences between streams on what constitutes an intermarriage, arising from their [[Who is a Jew|differing criteria for being Jewish]] in the first place. Orthodox Jews do not accept as Jewish a person whose mother is not Jewish, nor a convert whose conversion was conducted under the authority of a more liberal stream.\n\n{{Further information|Conservative Halakha#Restrictions on marriage}}\n\n== Marriage in Israel ==\n{{See also|Marriage in Israel}}\n\nIn [[Israel]], the only institutionalized form of Jewish marriage is the religious one, i. e., a marriage conducted under the auspices of the rabbinate. Specifically, marriage of Israeli Jews must be conducted according to Jewish Law ([[halakha]]), as viewed by [[Orthodox Judaism]]. One consequence is that Jews in Israel who cannot marry according to [[Jewish law]] (e. g., a [[kohen]] and a [[Divorce|divorc\u00e9e]], or a Jew and one who is not [[Who is a Jew?|halachically Jewish]]), cannot marry each other. This has led for calls, mostly from the secular segment of the Israeli public, for the institution of civil marriage.\n\nSome secular-Jewish Israelis travel abroad to have [[civil marriages]], either because they do not wish an Orthodox wedding or because their union cannot be sanctioned by ''halakha''. These marriages are legally recognized by the State, but are not recognized by the State Rabbinate.\n\nMarriages performed in Israel must be carried out by religious authorities of an official religion (Judaism, Islam, Christianity, or Druse), unless both parties are ''without religion''.\n\n== Divorce ==\n\nHalakha (Jewish law) allows for divorce. The document of divorce is termed a [[Get (divorce document)|''get'']]. The final divorce ceremony involves the husband giving the ''get'' document into the hand of the wife or her agent, but the wife may sue in rabbinical court to initiate the divorce. In such a case, a husband may be compelled to give the ''get'', if he has violated any of his numerous obligations;{{which|date=August 2016}} this was traditionally accomplished by beating and or monetary coercion.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The rationale was that since he was required to divorce his wife due to his (or her) violations of the contract, his good inclination desires to divorce her, and the community helps him to do what he wants to do anyway. In this case, the wife may or may not be entitled to a payment.\n\nSince around the 12th century, Judaism recognized the right of a wife abused physically or psychologically to a divorce<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/jewish-divorce-get-abuse/|title=Jewish Divorce: Get Abuse|website=My Jewish Learning|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n[[Conservative Judaism]] follows halacha, though differently than [[Orthodox Judaism]]. Reform Jews usually use an egalitarian form of the Ketubah at their weddings. They generally do not issue Jewish divorces, seeing a civil divorce as both necessary and sufficient; however, some Reform rabbis encourage the couple to go through a Jewish divorce procedure. Orthodox Judaism does not recognize civil law as overriding religious law, and thus does not view a civil divorce as sufficient. Therefore, a man or woman may be considered divorced by the Reform Jewish community, but still married by the Conservative community. Orthodox Judaism usually does not recognize Reform weddings because according to Talmudic law, the witnesses to the marriage must be Jews who observe halacha, which is seldom the case in reform weddings.\n=== Agunah ===\n{{Main article|Agunah}}\nTraditionally, when a husband fled, or his whereabouts were unknown for any reason, the woman was considered an ''[[agunah]]'' (literally \"an anchored woman\"), and was not allowed to remarry; in traditional Judaism, divorce can only be initiated by the husband. Prior to modern communication, the death of the husband while in a distant land was a common cause of this situation. In modern times, when a husband refuses to issue a [[Get (divorce document)|''get'']] due to money, property, or custody battles, the woman who cannot remarry is considered a Michuseres Get, not an agunah. A man in this situation would not be termed a ''Misarev Get'' (literally, \"a refuser of a divorce document\"), unless a legitimate Beis Din had required him to issue a Get. The term ''[[agunah]]'' is often used in such circumstances, but it is not technically accurate.\n\nWithin both the Conservative and Orthodox communities, there are efforts to avoid situations where a woman is not able to obtain a Jewish divorce from her husband. The [[ketubah]] serves this function in [[Conservative Judaism]] in order to prevent husbands from refusing to give their wives a divorce. To do this, the ketubah has built in provisions; so, if predetermined circumstances occur, the divorce goes into effect immediately. <ref name=\":0\">Hoffman, Lawrence A. \u201cThe Jewish Wedding Ceremony.\u201d Life Cycles in Jewish and Christian Worship, University of Notre Dame Press, 1996, pp. 129\u2013153.</ref> After the fact, various Jewish and secular legal methods are used to deal with such problems. None of the legal solutions addresses the agunah problem in the case of a missing husband.\n\n== Same-sex marriage ==\n{{See also|Judaism and sexual orientation}}\n\n=== In antiquity ===\nThe [[Midrash]] is one of the few ancient religious texts that makes reference to [[same-sex marriage]]. The following teaching can be found twice in the Midrash:\n\n<blockquote>\"Rabbi Huna said in the name of Rabbi Joseph, 'The generation of the Flood was not wiped out until they wrote \u05d2\u05de\u05d5\u05de\u05e1\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea (either sexual hymns or marriage documents) for the union of a man to a male or to an animal.'\"<ref>Genesis Rabbah 26:5; Leviticus Rabbah 23:9</ref></blockquote>\nAnother important reference is found in the [[Babylonian Talmud]]:\n<blockquote>\"'Ula said: Non-Jews [litt. Bnei Noach, the progeny of Noah] accepted upon themselves thirty mitzvot [divinely ordered laws], but they only abide by three of them: The first one is that they do not write marriage documents for male couples, the second one is that they do not sell dead [human] meat by the pound in stores, and the third one is that they respect the Torah.'\" <ref>Chullin 92ab</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== In Orthodox Judaism ===\nOrthodox Judaism does not have a Jewish legal construct of same-gender marriage. While any two Jewish adults may be joined by a Jewish legal contract, the rites of kiddushin are reserved for a union of a man and woman. Orthodox Judaism does not recognize civil marriages to have theological legal standing, be they civil marriages between male and female, or between two adults of the same gender.\n\n=== In Conservative Judaism ===\nIn June 2012, the American branch of [[Conservative Judaism]] formally approved same-sex marriage ceremonies in a 13-0 vote.<ref name=\"SSM\">[http://www.philly.com/philly/news/religion/20120601_ap_conservativejewsapprovegayweddingguidelines.html?c=r Conservative Jews approve gay wedding guidelines]</ref>\n\n=== In Reform Judaism ===\nIn 1996, the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] passed a resolution approving same-sex civil marriage. However, this same resolution made a distinction between civil marriages and religious marriages; this resolution thus stated:\n\n: However we may understand homosexuality, whether as an illness, as a genetically based dysfunction or as a sexual preference and lifestyle - we cannot accommodate the relationship of two homosexuals as a \"marriage\" within the context of Judaism, for none of the elements of qiddushin (sanctification) normally associated with marriage can be invoked for this relationship.<ref>[http://mljewish.org/S.C.J/faq/18-03-08.html MLjewish.org]</ref>\n: The Central Conference of American Rabbis support the right of gay and lesbian couples to share fully and equally in the rights of civil marriage, and\n: That the CCAR oppose governmental efforts to ban gay and lesbian marriage.\n: That this is a matter of civil law, and is separate from the question of rabbinic officiation at such marriages.\n\nIn 1998, an ad-hoc CCAR committee on human sexuality issued its majority report (11 to 1, 1 abstention) which stated that the holiness within a Jewish marriage \"may be present in committed same gender relationships between two Jews and that these relationships can serve as the foundation of stable Jewish families, thus adding strength to the Jewish community.\" The report called for CCAR to support rabbis in officiating at same-sex marriages. Also in 1998, the Responsa Committee of the CCAR issued a lengthy ''teshuvah'' (rabbinical opinion)<ref>[http://www.ccarnet.org/cgi-bin/respdisp.pl?file=8&year=5756 CCARnet.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041217072309/http://www.ccarnet.org/cgi-bin/respdisp.pl?file=8&year=5756 |date=December 17, 2004 }}</ref> that offered detailed argumentation in support of both sides of the question whether a rabbi may officiate at a commitment ceremony for a same-sex couple.\n\nIn March 2000, CCAR issued a new resolution stating that \"We do hereby resolve that the relationship of a Jewish, same gender couple is worthy of affirmation through appropriate Jewish ritual, and further resolve, that we recognize the diversity of opinions within our ranks on this issue. We support the decision of those who choose to officiate at rituals of union for same-sex couples, and we support the decision of those who do not.\"\n\n=== In Reconstructionist Judaism ===\nThe [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association]] (RRA) encourages its members to officiate at same-sex marriages, though it does not require it of them.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Judaism}}\n* [[Jewish prenuptial agreement]]\n* [[Negiah]] (guidelines for physical contact)\n* [[Shadchan]] (matchmaker)\n* [[Tzniut]] (modest behavior)\n* [[Yichud]] (prohibitions of seclusion with the opposite sex)\n\n== References ==\n{{Commons category|Jewish weddings}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Marital life in Judaism}}\n{{Jewish life}}\n{{Jews and Judaism}}\n\n[[Category:Jewish marital law|Marriage]]\n[[Category:Judaism and society|Marriage]]\n[[Category:Judaism and sexuality|Marriage]]\n[[Category:Judaism and women|Marriage]]\n[[Category:Marriage]]\n[[Category:Judaism and children]]\n[[Category:Sexuality and age]]\n", "name_user": "Debresser", "label": "safe", "comment": "Restore period that was mistakenly removed.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_views_on_marriage"}

It was the location of a fur trading post of the [[Russian-American Company]] in 1842. After the sale of Russian-American possessions to the United States in 1867, it was officially named Russian Mission in the early 1900s. The sale of alcohol is prohibited. At the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] the population was 312, up from 296 in 2000.\n\n==History==\nThe first Russian-American Company fur trading post on the Yukon River was established here in 1837. The settlement was recorded as a Cup'ik village called \"Ikogmiut,\" meaning \"people of the point,\" in 1842 by the Imperial Russian Navy explorer [[Lavrenty Zagoskin]].\n\nThe first Russian Orthodox mission in Interior Alaska was established here in 1851 by the Alutiiq priest Jacob Netzuetov. The mission was called \"Pokrovskaya Mission,\" and the village name was changed to Russian Mission around 1900. It was often confused with a village on the Kuskokwim that was also called \"Russian Mission\" (or \"Little Russian Mission\") but which was renamed [[Chuathbaluk, Alaska|Chuathbaluk]] in the 1960s. \n\nThe city was incorporated in 1970.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=63e1d1bfc6784d8db178eb44ec20e3e3#|title=Russian Mission, Alaska|website=State of Alaska, Division of Community and Regional Affairs|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-17}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nRussian Mission is located at {{coord|61|47|8|N|161|20|3|W|type:city}} (61.785522, -161.334074).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nRussian Mission is located on the right (western) bank of the [[Yukon River]] in the [[Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta]], 25 miles southeast of Marshall. It lies 70 air miles northeast of Bethel and 376 miles west of Anchorage.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|6.2|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|5.7|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.5|sqmi|km2}} of it (8.27%) is water.\n\n==Climate==\nRussian Mission falls within the transitional climate zone, characterized by tundra interspersed with boreal forests, and weather patterns of long, cold winters and shorter, warm summers. Heavy northern winds often limit air access in the fall and winter. The Lower Yukon is ice-free from mid-June through October.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=63e1d1bfc6784d8db178eb44ec20e3e3#|title=Russian Mission, Alaska|website=State of Alaska, Division of Community and Regional Affairs|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-17}}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box <!-- Infobox begins -->\n|collapsed=    <!-- Any entry in this line will make the template initially collapsed.

It was the location of a fur trading post of the [[Russian-American Company]] in 1842. After the sale of Russian-American possessions to the United States in 1867, it was officially named Russian Mission in the early 1900s. The sale of alcohol is prohibited. At the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] the population was 312, up from 296 in 2000.\n\n==History==\nThe first Russian-American Company fur trading post on the Yukon River was established here in 1837. The settlement was recorded as a Cup'ik village called \"Ikogmiut,\" meaning \"people of the point,\" in 1842 by the Imperial Russian Navy explorer [[Lavrenty Zagoskin]].\n\nThe first Russian Orthodox mission in Interior Alaska was established here in 1851 by the Alutiiq priest Jacob Netzuetov. The mission was called \"Pokrovskaya Mission,\" and the village name was changed to Russian Mission around 1900. It was often confused with a village on the Kuskokwim that was also called \"Russian Mission\" (or \"Little Russian Mission\") but which was renamed [[Chuathbaluk, Alaska|Chuathbaluk]] in the 1960s. \n\nThe city was incorporated in 1970.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=63e1d1bfc6784d8db178eb44ec20e3e3#|title=Russian Mission, Alaska|website=State of Alaska, Division of Community and Regional Affairs|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-17}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nRussian Mission is located at {{coord|61|47|8|N|161|20|3|W|type:city}} (61.785522, -161.334074).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nRussian Mission is located on the right (western) bank of the [[Yukon River]] in the [[Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta]], 25 miles southeast of Marshall.

In recent history, Duke Matthew Sussex sent a text message to Queen Elizabeth to disallow all those who use the name Sussex. Both Prince Harry and his wife were banished to Canada as punishmen.\n\n==History==\nA title associated with Sussex first appeared with the [[Kingdom of Sussex]], an Anglo-Saxon kingdom that was annexed by the [[Kingdom of Wessex]] around 827<ref name=\"EcgODNB\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/8581 |last=Edwards |first=Heather |title=Ecgberht [Egbert] (d.&nbsp;839), king of the West Saxons in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |accessdate=22 June 2014}}</ref>, that later became part of the [[Kingdom of England]].

The title became extinct upon Prince Augustus Frederick's death in 1843.\n\nAlthough Prince Augustus Frederick was survived by a son and daughter by [[Lady Augusta Murray]], their marriage (purportedly solemnized at [[St George's Hanover Square Church]], [[Westminster]], in 1793) had been annulled for lack of royal permission under the [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]], rendering the children illegitimate under English law and unable to inherit titles from their father. Both children by the annulled marriage died childless, rendering the issue of their inheritance moot.\n\nOn 2 May 1831, Prince Augustus Frederick married secondly (and again in contravention of the [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]]), [[Cecilia Underwood, 1st Duchess of Inverness|Lady Cecilia Gore]] at [[Great Cumberland Place]], London.

[[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]. It takes its name from the county of [[Sussex]] in England.\n\n==History==\nA title associated with Sussex first appeared with the [[Kingdom of Sussex]], an Anglo-Saxon kingdom that was annexed by the [[Kingdom of Wessex]] around 827<ref name=\"EcgODNB\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/8581 |last=Edwards |first=Heather |title=Ecgberht [Egbert] (d.&nbsp;839), king of the West Saxons in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |accessdate=22 June 2014}}</ref>, that later became part of the [[Kingdom of England]]. In charters, [[List of monarchs of Sussex|Sussex's monarchs]] were sometimes referred to as [[ealdormen]], or ''duces'' in Latin, which is sometimes translated as \"dukes\".\n\n===First creation, 1801===\nThe title of Duke of Sussex was first conferred on 24 November 1801 upon [[Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex|Prince Augustus Frederick]],<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{London Gazette |date=24 November 1801 |issue=15429 |page=1403}}</ref> the sixth son of [[King George III]]. He was made [[Baron Arklow]] and [[Earl of Inverness]] at the same time, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The title became extinct upon Prince Augustus Frederick's death in 1843.\n\nAlthough Prince Augustus Frederick was survived by a son and daughter by [[Lady Augusta Murray]], their marriage (purportedly solemnized at [[St George's Hanover Square Church]], [[Westminster]], in 1793) had been annulled for lack of royal permission under the [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]], rendering the children illegitimate under English law and unable to inherit titles from their father. Both children by the annulled marriage died childless, rendering the issue of their inheritance moot.\n\nOn 2 May 1831, Prince Augustus Frederick married secondly (and again in contravention of the [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]]), [[Cecilia Underwood, 1st Duchess of Inverness|Lady Cecilia Gore]] at [[Great Cumberland Place]], London. Not being the Prince's legitimate wife, Lady Cecilia could not be received at court. On 30 March 1840, she was given the title of [[Duchess of Inverness]] in her own right by [[Queen Victoria]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=19842 |page=858 |date=31 March 1840}}</ref>\n\n===Second creation, 2018===\nIn 2018, the dukedom of Sussex was recreated and granted<!-- titles are in process of being created until passed by letters patent in about a month --> to [[Prince Harry]] to mark the occasion of [[Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle|his wedding]] to [[Meghan Markle]], who thereby became the first Duchess of Sussex.<ref name=\"harry\">[https://www.royal.uk/prince-harry-and-ms-meghan-markle-announcement-titles Prince Harry and Ms. Meghan Markle: Announcement of Titles], The Royal Household, 19 May 2018.</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Meghan Markle's royal title is Duchess of Sussex|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/royalwedding/meghan-markle-royal-title-after-marriage-prince-harry-wedding-duchess-sussex-connaught-a8308751.html|accessdate=23 May 2018|work=The Independent|date=17 April 2018}}</ref> On 19 May 2018, it was announced that Prince Harry would become Duke of Sussex in England, with the subsidiary titles of [[Earl of Dumbarton]] in [[Scotland]] and [[Baron Kilkeel]] in [[Northern Ireland]].
