They noticed two Arab men, Aiad Fatfata and Kifah Ghanimat, approaching them and were suspicious of their intentions. The men attacked them armed with a long serrated knife. The women attempted to fight back, Wilson managing to stab an attacker with a pocketknife, before they were subdued. The men stole their money and removed Wilson's necklace. Wilson recalled: \"I didn't understand whether they wanted to rape us or mug us. They removed my Star of David. I tried to convince them we weren't Jewish.\"\n\nWilson instructed Luken to feign an epileptic attack and told their assailants that they were part of a tour group that would soon be returning. After half an hour at being held at knife point, their shoes were removed and their hands tied behind their backs. After being gagged with parts of a fleece jacket, the two women were separated and forced to kneel on hands and knees. The two women begged for their lives to be spared but were then stabbed multiple times. Wilson later told police: \"I realized he was going to behead me. I saw Kristine murdered before my eyes. She was yelling. I didn't want it to hurt me. I tried to keep silent. It was tough, because the beatings were hard, but I tried to play dead.\"\n\nWilson was stabbed 13 times and sustained several broken ribs, punctured lungs and diaphragm, a dislocated shoulder, a broken shoulder blade, and a broken sternum; Luken was fatally stabbed in the attack. The attackers returned a few minutes later to confirm that the two women were dead. Wilson was stabbed again in the chest. She said: \"I played dead. I saw [the knife] hadn't gone into my heart. My friend was dying, I heard her making gurgling sounds.\" Wilson regained consciousness and found herself between bushes in the forest. Feeling weak and severely injured, she tried to shift herself to the forest trail so that other people might discover her. She recounted: \"I just wanted to sleep and felt as though I were about to collapse, but I knew I could not fall asleep. I tried to get up three times and fell down, I deviated from the path and couldn't find my way, and it was very difficult for me to breathe, but I had to make a switch in my head and think positive.\"\n\nWith her hands still bound behind her back, Wilson staggered barefoot and bleeding heavily from multiple stab wounds for more than 1,200 meters until reaching a parking lot where a family alerted the authorities. She was hospitalized in the [[Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital]] in a critical condition. Due to Wilson stabbing one of the attackers with a small penknife, the DNA on her knife led to the capture of a terror cell. She was declared a heroine by the Israeli [[Shin Bet]] and the Israeli press.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=walla.co.il|accessdate=5 December 2015|language=Hebrew|title=\u05d4\u05e9\u05d1\"\u05db: \u05d7\u05d1\u05e8\u05ea\u05d4 \u05e9\u05dc \u05d4\u05ea\u05d9\u05d9\u05e8\u05ea \u05e9\u05e0\u05e8\u05e6\u05d7\u05d4 \u05e4\u05e2\u05dc\u05d4 \u05db\u05d2\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4|url=http://news.walla.co.il/?w=/1/1785049}}</ref> \n\nPolice and border officials organized a large hunt for Luken, combing the forests around Beit Shemesh.

Ayad Fasafa and Kifah Ghanimat were linked to the scene and confessed to the crime. Police discovered that Kifah Ghanimat was the leader of a Palestinian terror cell of four members, all residents of the Hebron region, that included Ayad Fasafa and Ibrahim Ghanimat.\n\nIn addition to admitting to Luken's murder, members of the terror cell also confessed to the murder of Neta Sorek from earlier that year and said that they had perpetrated additional stabbing and shooting attacks.

They became friends and Luken, a keen hiker, and Wilson, a professional Israeli tour guide, decided to go hiking together in Israel during the Christmas holiday.<ref name=\"BBC\"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/palestinian-convicted-in-murders-of-american-and-israeli-women-near-jerusalem-1.386807|title=Palestinian convicted in murders of American and Israeli women near Jerusalem|work=[[Haaretz]]|date = 26 September 2011|accessdate=2 September 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"god\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4001856,00.html|title=Stabbing victim 'found God' in Israel|publisher=Ynet|accessdate=2 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/40737195|title=Slain U.S. tourist 'loved Israel'|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=2 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=200630|title=Memorial service for slain American to be held in J'lem|publisher=Jerusalem Post|accessdate=2 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Attack===\nOn Saturday afternoon, 18 December 2010, Luken and Wilson were hiking in the [[Mata, Israel|Mata]] forest, near the town of [[Beit Shemesh]], west of Jerusalem. They noticed two Arab men, Aiad Fatfata and Kifah Ghanimat, approaching them and were suspicious of their intentions. The men attacked them armed with a long serrated knife. The women attempted to fight back, Wilson managing to stab an attacker with a pocketknife, before they were subdued. The men stole their money and removed Wilson's necklace. Wilson recalled: \"I didn't understand whether they wanted to rape us or mug us. They removed my Star of David. I tried to convince them we weren't Jewish.\"\n\nWilson instructed Luken to feign an epileptic attack and told their assailants that they were part of a tour group that would soon be returning. After half an hour at being held at knife point, their shoes were removed and their hands tied behind their backs. After being gagged with parts of a fleece jacket, the two women were separated and forced to kneel on hands and knees. The two women begged for their lives to be spared but were then stabbed multiple times. Wilson later told police: \"I realized he was going to behead me. I saw Kristine murdered before my eyes. She was yelling. I didn't want it to hurt me. I tried to keep silent. It was tough, because the beatings were hard, but I tried to play dead.\"\n\nWilson was stabbed 13 times and sustained several broken ribs, punctured lungs and diaphragm, a dislocated shoulder, a broken shoulder blade, and a broken sternum; Luken was fatally stabbed in the attack. The attackers returned a few minutes later to confirm that the two women were dead. Wilson was stabbed again in the chest. She said: \"I played dead. I saw [the knife] hadn't gone into my heart. My friend was dying, I heard her making gurgling sounds.\" Wilson regained consciousness and found herself between bushes in the forest. Feeling weak and severely injured, she tried to shift herself to the forest trail so that other people might discover her. She recounted: \"I just wanted to sleep and felt as though I were about to collapse, but I knew I could not fall asleep. I tried to get up three times and fell down, I deviated from the path and couldn't find my way, and it was very difficult for me to breathe, but I had to make a switch in my head and think positive.\"\n\nWith her hands still bound behind her back, Wilson staggered barefoot and bleeding heavily from multiple stab wounds for more than 1,200 meters until reaching a parking lot where a family alerted the authorities. She was hospitalized in the [[Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital]] in a critical condition. Due to Wilson stabbing one of the attackers with a small penknife, the DNA on her knife led to the capture of a terror cell. She was declared a heroine by the Israeli [[Shin Bet]] and the Israeli press.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=walla.co.il|accessdate=5 December 2015|language=Hebrew|title=\u05d4\u05e9\u05d1\"\u05db: \u05d7\u05d1\u05e8\u05ea\u05d4 \u05e9\u05dc \u05d4\u05ea\u05d9\u05d9\u05e8\u05ea \u05e9\u05e0\u05e8\u05e6\u05d7\u05d4 \u05e4\u05e2\u05dc\u05d4 \u05db\u05d2\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4|url=http://news.walla.co.il/?w=/1/1785049}}</ref> \n\nPolice and border officials organized a large hunt for Luken, combing the forests around Beit Shemesh.

The police relied upon Wilson's testimony, and [[DNA samples]] were produced from the blood stains of Ayad Fasafa, who had been lightly stabbed by Wilson in the attack. Ayad Fasafa and Kifah Ghanimat were linked to the scene and confessed to the crime. Police discovered that Kifah Ghanimat was the leader of a Palestinian terror cell of four members, all residents of the Hebron region, that included Ayad Fasafa and Ibrahim Ghanimat.\n\nIn addition to admitting to Luken's murder, members of the terror cell also confessed to the murder of Neta Sorek from earlier that year and said that they had perpetrated additional stabbing and shooting attacks.

While there, he appeared as a guest lead on ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]''. The producers of a horror film called ''[[Sssssss]]'' (1973) saw Benedict's performance in ''Hawaii Five-O'' and promptly cast him as the lead in that movie. He next played the psychotic wife-beating husband of [[Twiggy]] in her American film debut, ''[[W (1974 film)|W]]'' (1974). Benedict starred in the television series ''[[Chopper One]]'', which aired for one season in 1974. He made two appearances in ''[[Charlie's Angels]]''.

The [[List of The A-Team episodes#Season 2: 1983\u20131984|second season]] episode \"Steel\" includes a scene at [[Universal Studios]] where Face is seen looking bemused as a [[Cylon (1978)|Cylon]] walks by him as an in-joke to his previous role in ''Battlestar Galactica''.

He is of German extraction.\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Chopper One cast 1974.JPG|thumb|Photo of the cast of the short-lived television program ''[[Chopper One]]''. From left: Dirk Benedict, [[Ted Hartley]], [[Jim McMullan]].]]\n\nBenedict's film debut was in the 1972 film ''[[Georgia, Georgia]]''. When the New York run for ''[[Butterflies Are Free]]'' ended, he received an offer to repeat his performance in [[Hawaii]], opposite [[Barbara Rush]]. While there, he appeared as a guest lead on ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]''. The producers of a horror film called ''[[Sssssss]]'' (1973) saw Benedict's performance in ''Hawaii Five-O'' and promptly cast him as the lead in that movie. He next played the psychotic wife-beating husband of [[Twiggy]] in her American film debut, ''[[W (1974 film)|W]]'' (1974). Benedict starred in the television series ''[[Chopper One]]'', which aired for one season in 1974. He made two appearances in ''[[Charlie's Angels]]''. He also appeared on the \"Donny & Marie\" variety show.\n\nBenedict's career break came in 1978 when he appeared as [[Lieutenant Starbuck]] in the movie and television series ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]''. The same year Benedict starred in the TV movie ''Cruise Into Terror'', and appeared in the ensemble movie ''[[Scavenger Hunt]]'' the following year.\n\n===1980s and 1990s===\nIn 1980, Benedict starred alongside [[Linda Blair]] in an action-comedy movie called ''[[Ruckus (film)|Ruckus]]''. In 1983, Dirk gained further popularity as con-man Lieutenant Templeton \"Face\" Peck in 1980s action television series ''[[The A-Team]]''. He played \"Faceman\" from {{start date|1982}} to {{end date|1986}}, although the series didn't air until January 1983, and the final episode wasn't shown until 1987 rebroadcasts. The [[List of The A-Team episodes#Season 2: 1983\u20131984|second season]] episode \"Steel\" includes a scene at [[Universal Studios]] where Face is seen looking bemused as a [[Cylon (1978)|Cylon]] walks by him as an in-joke to his previous role in ''Battlestar Galactica''. The clip is incorporated into the series' opening credit sequence from season 3 onward.\n\nIn 1986, Benedict starred as low-life band manager Harry Smilac in the movie ''[[Body Slam (film)|Body Slam]]'' along with [[Lou Albano]], [[Roddy Piper]], and cameo appearances by [[Freddie Blassie]], [[Ric Flair]], and [[Bruno Sammartino]]. His character Smilac ends up managing the pro-wrestler \"Quick Rick\" Roberts (Piper) and faces opposition by Captain Lou and his wrestling tag-team \"[[The Wild Samoans|the Cannibals]]\".\n\nIn 1987, Benedict took the title role of Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'' at the [[Classic Stage Company|Abbey Theatre]] in Manhattan. Both his performance and the entire production were lambasted by critics.<ref>Brucker, D.J.R. [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/22/theater/the-stage-hamlet.html \"The Stage: Hamlet\"], ''The New York Times'', September 22, 1987</ref> Benedict starred in the 1989 TV movie ''Trenchcoat in Paradise''.\n\nIn 1991, Benedict starred in ''[[Blue Tornado (film)|Blue Tornado]],'' playing Alex, [[call sign]] Fireball, an [[Italian Air Force]] [[fighter pilot]].

In 1993, Benedict starred in ''[[Shadow Force (film)|Shadow Force]]''.\n\nBenedict also appeared as Jake Barnes in the 1996 action-adventure film ''[[Alaska (1996 film)|Alaska]]''.\n\n===2000s and 2010s===\nIn 2000, Benedict wrote and directed his first screenplay, [[Cahoots (film)|''Cahoots'']].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/244091/Cahoots/overview|title=Cahoots|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 10, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908015459/https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/244091/Cahoots/overview|archivedate=September 8, 2008}}</ref> Benedict appeared in the 2006 German film ''[[Goldene Zeiten]]'' (\"Golden Times\") in a dual role, playing an American former TV star as well as a German lookalike who impersonates him.\n\nIn 2006, he wrote an online essay criticizing the then-airing ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' re-imagined series and, especially, its casting of a woman as his character, Starbuck, writing that \"the war against masculinity has been won\" and that \"a television show based on hope, spiritual faith, and family is unimagined and regurgitated as a show of despair, sexual violence and family dysfunction\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Benedict|first1=Dirk|url=http://www.dirkbenedictcentral.com/home/articles-readarticle.php?nid=5|title=Lost in Castration|website=Dirk Benedict Central|date=May 2004|accessdate=February 7, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220100737/http://www.dirkbenedictcentral.com/home/articles-readarticle.php?nid=5|archive-date=December 20, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nHe appeared as a contestant on the 2007 [[U.K.]] series of ''[[Celebrity Big Brother 5 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother]]''.

Dirk plays an eccentric T.V. host of a show called 'Stranger Than Fiction', which is like a hybrid of the Twilight Zone and the X-Files. The movie is a sci-fi, comedy, horror that follows a bunch of high school students trying to survive the night from a Space Ninja invasion.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn the 1970s, Benedict survived a prostate [[tumor]] believed to have been [[prostate cancer|cancerous]]. Having rejected conventional medical treatment, he credited his survival to the adoption of a [[macrobiotic diet]] recommended to him by actress [[Gloria Swanson]].<ref>{{cite magazine| last=Benedict |first=Dirk |url=http://people.com/archive/an-a-team-stars-toughest-battle-against-the-specter-of-cancer-is-waged-in-secret-and-alone-vol-20-no-15/| title=An A-Team Star's Toughest Battle\u2014Against the Specter of Cancer\u2014is Waged in Secret and Alone |work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=July 2, 2014 |accessdate=2017-09-22}}</ref>\nIn 1986, he married [[Toni Hudson]], an actress with whom he has two sons, George and Roland.
