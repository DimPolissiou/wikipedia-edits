There are no hedgehogs native to Australia and no living species native to the Americas (the extinct genus ''[[Amphechinus]]'' was once present in North America).\n\nHedgehogs share distant ancestry with [[shrew]]s (family Soricidae), with [[gymnure]]s possibly being the intermediate link, and they have changed little over the last 15 million years.<ref name='13 ways'>{{cite journal|vauthors=Reiter C, Gould GC |title=Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Hedgehog|journal= Natural History|year=1998|volume= 107 |issue =6|pages=52}}</ref> Like many of the first mammals, they have adapted to a nocturnal way of life.<ref name=\"nocturnal\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wildlifetrust.org.uk/facts/hedge.htm |title=WildlifeTrust.org.uk |publisher=WildlifeTrust.org.uk |accessdate=2013-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212223618/http://www.wildlifetrust.org.uk/facts/hedge.htm |archivedate=12 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Their spiny protection resembles that of the unrelated [[porcupine]]s, which are rodents, and [[echidna]]s, a type of [[monotreme]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''hedgehog'' came into use around the year 1450, derived from the [[Middle English]] ''heyghoge'', from ''heyg'', ''hegge'' (\"hedge\"), because it frequents hedgerows, and ''hoge'', ''hogge'' (\"hog\"), from its piglike snout.<ref>Oxford English Dictionary, Online edition. Retrieved 13 July 2007.</ref> Other names include ''urchin'', ''hedgepig'' and ''furze-pig''.\n\n==Physical description==\nHedgehogs are easily recognized by their [[Spine (zoology)|spines]], which are hollow hairs made stiff with [[keratin]].<ref name=Attenborough>{{cite AV media | author=Attenborough, David | title=Attenborough's Natural Curiosities 2 | volume=Armoured Animals | year=2014 | publisher=UKTV}}</ref> Their spines are not [[poison]]ous or [[wikt:barb|barb]]ed and, unlike the quills of a [[porcupine]], do not easily detach from their bodies. However, the immature animal's spines normally fall out as they are replaced with adult spines. This is called \"quilling\". Spines can also shed when the animal is diseased or under extreme stress. Hedgehogs are usually brown, with pale tips to the spines, though blonde hedgehogs are found on the UK island of [[Alderney]].\n\n[[File:cmglee Horniman hedgehog skin skeleton.jpg|thumb|A skin-skeletal preparation]]\n[[File:Hedgehog sting in SEM, 20x en.GIF|thumb|Close-up of the last 5 mm of a hedgehog spine ([[scanning electron microscope|SEM]] microscopy)]]\nAll species of hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball in self-defense, causing all of the spines to point outwards.<ref name=Attenborough/> The hedgehog's back contains two large muscles that control the position of the quills. When the creature is rolled into a ball, the quills on the back protect the tucked face, feet, and belly, which are not quilled. Since the effectiveness of this strategy depends on the number of spines, some desert hedgehogs that evolved to carry less weight are more likely to flee or attack, ramming an intruder with the spines; rolling into a spiny ball for those species is a last resort. The various species are prey to different predators: while forest hedgehogs are prey primarily to birds (especially [[owl]]s) and [[ferret]]s, smaller species like the [[long-eared hedgehog]] are prey to [[fox]]es, [[Gray wolf|wolves]], and [[mongoose]]s.\n\nHedgehogs are primarily [[nocturnal]], though some species can also be active during the day. Hedgehogs sleep for a large portion of the day under bushes, grasses, rocks, or most commonly in dens dug in the ground, with varying habits among the species. All wild hedgehogs can [[hibernation|hibernate]], though not all do, depending on temperature, species, and abundance of food.\n\nHedgehogs are fairly vocal and communicate through a combination of grunts, snuffles and/or squeals, depending on species.\n\nHedgehogs occasionally perform a ritual called [[self-anointing in animals|anointing]].<ref name=\"National Wildlife 1 June 2005\">{{cite news |last= Drew |first= Lisa W. | authorlink= |title= Meet the Hedgehog: What feeds on lizards, chews venomous toad skins and coats its spiky body with frothy saliva?|url= https://www.nwf.org/News-and-Magazines/National-Wildlife/Animals/Archives/2005/Meet-the-Hedgehog.aspx| date= 1 June 2005|work= [[National Wildlife]] |location= [[Reston, Virginia]]| publisher= [[National Wildlife Federation]] | accessdate=12 July 2017 }}</ref> When the animal encounters a new scent, it will lick and bite the source, then form a scented froth in its mouth and paste it on its [[Spine (zoology)|spines]] with its [[tongue]]. The purpose of this habit is unknown, but some experts believe anointing [[camouflage]]s the hedgehog with the new scent of the area and provides a possible poison or source of infection to predators poked by their spines. Anointing is sometimes also called [[anting (bird activity)|anting]] because of a similar behavior in birds.\n\nLike [[opossums]], mice, and [[mole (animal)|moles]], hedgehogs have some natural [[Snake venom#Immunity|immunity]] against some [[snake venom]] through the protein [[erinacin]] in the animal's muscular system, although it is available only in small amounts and a [[Viperidae|viper]] bite may still be fatal.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Tamotsu |last=Omori-Satoha |author2=Yoshio Yamakawab |author3=Dietrich Mebs |title=The antihemorrhagic factor, erinacin, from the European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), a metalloprotease inhibitor of large molecular size possessing ficolin/opsonin P35 lectin domains |journal=Toxicon |volume=38 |issue=11 |pages=1561\u201380 |date=November 2000 |pmid=10775756 |doi=10.1016/S0041-0101(00)00090-8 }}</ref> In addition, hedgehogs are one of four known mammalian groups with mutations that protect against another snake venom, [[Snake venom#Neurotoxins|\u03b1-neurotoxin]].

Retrieved 13 July 2007.</ref> Other names include ''urchin'', ''hedgepig'' and ''furze-pig''.\n\n==Physical description==\nHedgehogs are easily recognized by their [[Spine (zoology)|spines]], which are hollow hairs made stiff with [[keratin]].<ref name=Attenborough>{{cite AV media | author=Attenborough, David | title=Attenborough's Natural Curiosities 2 | volume=Armoured Animals | year=2014 | publisher=UKTV}}</ref> Their spines are not [[poison]]ous or [[wikt:barb|barb]]ed and, unlike the quills of a [[porcupine]], do not easily detach from their bodies. However, the immature animal's spines normally fall out as they are replaced with adult spines. This is called \"quilling\". Spines can also shed when the animal is diseased or under extreme stress. Hedgehogs are usually brown, with pale tips to the spines, though blonde hedgehogs are found on the UK island of [[Alderney]].\n\n[[File:cmglee Horniman hedgehog skin skeleton.jpg|thumb|A skin-skeletal preparation]]\n[[File:Hedgehog sting in SEM, 20x en.GIF|thumb|Close-up of the last 5 mm of a hedgehog spine ([[scanning electron microscope|SEM]] microscopy)]]\nAll species of hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball in self-defense, causing all of the spines to point outwards.<ref name=Attenborough/> The hedgehog's back contains two large muscles that control the position of the quills. When the creature is rolled into a ball, the quills on the back protect the tucked face, feet, and belly, which are not quilled. Since the effectiveness of this strategy depends on the number of spines, some desert hedgehogs that evolved to carry less weight are more likely to flee or attack, ramming an intruder with the spines; rolling into a spiny ball for those species is a last resort. The various species are prey to different predators: while forest hedgehogs are prey primarily to birds (especially [[owl]]s) and [[ferret]]s, smaller species like the [[long-eared hedgehog]] are prey to [[fox]]es, [[Gray wolf|wolves]], and [[mongoose]]s.\n\nHedgehogs are primarily [[nocturnal]], though some species can also be active during the day. Hedgehogs sleep for a large portion of the day under bushes, grasses, rocks, or most commonly in dens dug in the ground, with varying habits among the species. All wild hedgehogs can [[hibernation|hibernate]], though not all do, depending on temperature, species, and abundance of food.\n\nHedgehogs are fairly vocal and communicate through a combination of grunts, snuffles and/or squeals, depending on species.\n\nHedgehogs occasionally perform a ritual called [[self-anointing in animals|anointing]].<ref name=\"National Wildlife 1 June 2005\">{{cite news |last= Drew |first= Lisa W. | authorlink= |title= Meet the Hedgehog: What feeds on lizards, chews venomous toad skins and coats its spiky body with frothy saliva?|url= https://www.nwf.org/News-and-Magazines/National-Wildlife/Animals/Archives/2005/Meet-the-Hedgehog.aspx| date= 1 June 2005|work= [[National Wildlife]] |location= [[Reston, Virginia]]| publisher= [[National Wildlife Federation]] | accessdate=12 July 2017 }}</ref> When the animal encounters a new scent, it will lick and bite the source, then form a scented froth in its mouth and paste it on its [[Spine (zoology)|spines]] with its [[tongue]]. The purpose of this habit is unknown, but some experts believe anointing [[camouflage]]s the hedgehog with the new scent of the area and provides a possible poison or source of infection to predators poked by their spines. Anointing is sometimes also called [[anting (bird activity)|anting]] because of a similar behavior in birds.\n\nLike [[opossums]], mice, and [[mole (animal)|moles]], hedgehogs have some natural [[Snake venom#Immunity|immunity]] against some [[snake venom]] through the protein [[erinacin]] in the animal's muscular system, although it is available only in small amounts and a [[Viperidae|viper]] bite may still be fatal.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Tamotsu |last=Omori-Satoha |author2=Yoshio Yamakawab |author3=Dietrich Mebs |title=The antihemorrhagic factor, erinacin, from the European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), a metalloprotease inhibitor of large molecular size possessing ficolin/opsonin P35 lectin domains |journal=Toxicon |volume=38 |issue=11 |pages=1561\u201380 |date=November 2000 |pmid=10775756 |doi=10.1016/S0041-0101(00)00090-8 }}</ref> In addition, hedgehogs are one of four known mammalian groups with mutations that protect against another snake venom, [[Snake venom#Neurotoxins|\u03b1-neurotoxin]].

A Wuhan hospital notified the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) and health commissions on 27 December 2019. On 31 December Wuhan CDC admitted that there was a cluster of unknown pneumonia cases related to [[Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market|Huanan Seafood Market]] after the unverified documents appeared on the Internet. The potential disease outbreak soon drew nationwide attention including that of the [[National Health Commission]] (NHC) in [[Beijing]] who sent experts to Wuhan on the following day. On 8 January, a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of the pneumonia.<ref>{{Cite

The Sons of Pitch, GW's only male a cappella group, has been around since 2003, and the female group the GW Pitches was founded in 1996. All the groups are extremely committed to charity work, with the Troubadours holding an annual philanthropic concert in the fall entitled \"Acappellapalooza,\" and the Sons of Pitch holding one in the spring named \"The United States of A-Cappella.\" In the case of the former, groups from GWU are drawn for a concert, in the latter, groups from around the nation. The groups have raised tens of thousands of dollars for various charitable causes. Additionally, the university is home to the Voice gospel choir, a group that sings gospel music, the GW Vibes, a co-ed group focusing on soulful music. The GW Sirens, another all-girls group, and the GW Motherfunkers, a coed top 40 group, were created in 2003 and 2012, respectively.

The Sons of Pitch, GW's only male a cappella group, has been around since 2003, and the female group the GW Pitches was founded in 1996. All the groups are extremely committed to charity work, with the Troubadours holding an annual philanthropic concert in the fall entitled \"Acappellapalooza,\" and the Sons of Pitch holding one in the spring named \"The United States of A-Cappella.\" In the case of the former, groups from GWU are drawn for a concert, in the latter, groups from around the nation. The groups have raised tens of thousands of dollars for various charitable causes. Additionally, the university is home to the Voice gospel choir, a group that sings gospel music, the GW Vibes, a co-ed group focusing on soulful music. The GW Sirens, another all-girls group, and the GW Motherfunkers, a coed top 40 group, were created in 2003 and 2012, respectively.
