Many accounts have shown that it has a global distribution, having been isolated in select soils as well as on feathers and other substrates with high keratin content. It has also been found in indoor dust of hospitals and houses in [[Kanpur]], Northern [[India]] and as a common keratinophilic soil fungus in urban Berlin. This species has been associated with nail infections in humans as well as skin lesions and slower hair growth in [[guinea pigs]].\n\n==History and taxonomy==\n''Ctenomyces serratus'' was first discovered on a rotten, old feather by Eidam in 1880.<ref name= Orr1963/> When discovering it, Eidam observed different structures and assumed he was looking at different stages of growth of the fungus. However, in 1956 [[Chester Ray Benjamin|Benjamin]] revealed that Eidam's observations unintentionally included a species of ''Arthroderma''.<ref name=\"benjamin1956\" /> The fungus is a member of the family of [[Onygenaceae]].<ref name=\"currah1985\" /> The etymology of the species epithet \"serratus\" is derived from the Latin ''serra'' which means \"saw\" due to the saw-tooth appearance of peridial appendages.<ref name = eidam/>\n\n==Structural appearance and physiology==\nIts [[ascomata]] are orange-brown, rounded and measure approximately 100&ndash;350 \u03bcm in diameter, exclusive of its appendages.<ref name=eidam/> Its [[ascus|asci]] are hyaline and rounded, containing 8 lens-shaped, orange, ascospores, 7 \u03bcm in diameter.<ref name = eidam/> In addition, their [[wikt:peridium|peridial appendages]] are pale-orange and have a membranous inner layer with an outer layer of orange-brown, [[septate]], thick-walled and prickly hyphae that form a highly ramified mesh-like [[peridium]] with [[anastamosis|anastamosing]] connections.<ref name = eidam/> With its [[teleomorph]]ic stages being more commonly found, its [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|anamorph]] state is absent or rare, having large amounts of [[arthroconidia]].<ref name = eidam/> The conidial state has been treated in the form-genus, ''Chrysosporium''.<ref name = chrysosporium/><ref name=\"currah1985\" /> ''C. serratus'' is generally regarded to be heterothallic, only forming the [[ascus|sexual]] state when crossed with the compatible mating type;<ref name = mating/> however, the possibility has been raised that it may in fact be [[homothallism|homothallic]].<ref name = eidam/> Notably, its appendages are roughened, tooth-like and between 100\u2013150 \u03bcm in length with 5&ndash;11 cells.<ref name = eidam/> Growth is reliant on nitrogen sources that include the [[Absolute Configuration|L configurations]] of the [[amino acids]] [[alanine]], [[isoleucine]], [[methionine]], [[tyrosine]] and [[glycine]].<ref name=eidam/> This species prefers neutral to slightly [[alkaline]] conditions.<ref name = pH/> It can utilize [[fructose]] and is dependent on external sources of the B-vitamin, [[thiamine]].<ref name = pH/> One comparative study showed that its growth is only supported in amino acid mixtures and [[casein]] protein media.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} There has been suggestion that ''C. serratus'' may be able to fix atmospheric nitrogen.<ref name=fungic/> Commonly used [[fungicide]]s are active against this species, including: [[Benlate]], [[Calix Limited|Calix]] and Saprol.<ref name=fungic/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n\n{{Location map many| World\n| width   = 500\n| length  = 1000\n| float   = right\n| caption = Localities where ''C. serratus'' has been isolated\n| label = Argentina\n  | pos1 = right\n  | marksize1 = 1\n  | coordinates1 = {{coord|-38.42|-63.62}}\n| label2 = Canada\n  | pos2 = right\n  | marksize2 = 1\n  | coordinates2 = {{coord|56.13|-106.3}}\n| label3 = Slovakia\n  | pos3 = bottom left\n  | marksize3 = 1\n  | coordinates3 = {{coord|51|19.70}}\n| label4 = Spain\n  | pos4 = left\n  | marksize4 = 1\n  | coordinates4 = {{coord|40.12|-3}}\n| label5 = India\n  | pos5 = right\n  | marksize5 = 1\n  | coordinates5 = {{coord|20.59|78.96}}\n| label6 = USA\n  | pos6 = right\n  | marksize6 = 1\n  | coordinates6 = {{coord|37.09|-95.71}}\n| label7 = UK\n  | pos7 = left\n  | marksize7 = 1\n  | coordinates7 = {{coord|52.36|-1}}\n| label8 = Iraq\n  | pos8 = top\n  | marksize8 = 1\n  | coordinates8 = {{coord|33.22|43.68}}\n| label9 = Easter Island\n  | pos9 = right\n  | marksize9 = 1\n  | coordinates9 = {{coord|-27.11|-109.35}}\n| label10 = New Guinea\n  | pos10 = top\n  | marksize10 = 1\n  | coordinates10 = {{coord|-6.32|143.96}}\n| label11 = Galapagos Islands\n  | pos11 = right\n  | marksize11 = 1\n  | coordinates11 = {{coord|-0.95|-90.97}}\n| label12 = Germany\n  | pos12 = top\n  | marksize12 = 1\n  | coordinates12 = {{coord|54|10.45}}\n| label13 = Australia\n  | pos13 = right\n  | marksize13 = 1\n  | coordinates13 = {{coord|-25.27|133.78}}\n| label14 = Italy\n  | pos14 = right\n  | marksize14 = 1\n  | coordinates14 = {{coord|41.87|12.56}}\n| label15 = Kuwait\n  | pos15 = right\n  | marksize15 = 1\n  | coordinates15 = {{coord|29.31|47.48}}\n| label16 = Egypt\n  | pos16 = left\n  | marksize16 = 1\n  | coordinates16 = {{coord|26.82|30.80}}\n| label17 = South Korea\n  | pos17 = right\n  | marksize17 = 1\n  | coordinates17 = {{coord|35.91|127.77}}\n| label18 = Nigeria\n  | pos18 = right\n  | marksize18 = 1\n  | coordinates18 = {{coord|9.08|8.68}}\n| label19 = France\n  | pos19 = left\n  | marksize19 = 1\n  | coordinates19 = {{coord|46.23|2.21}}\n}}\n\n''Ctenomyces serratus'' is world-wide in distribution and shows some degree of habitat overlap with other keratinophilic fungi in the families, [[Arthrodermataceae]] and [[Onygenaceae]], due perhaps in part to its spread across political borders on feathered hosts. Literature reports document this species from 19 countries worldwide, with most specimens found in select soils, birds nests and animal [[wiktionary:dung|excrements]]. A single case of its appearance in [[turkeys]] has been found as well.\n\nWith most of its growth being on shed feathers due to its keratinophilic nature, this fungal species tends to grow wherever its host happens to lay shed feathers. Because of its strong association with migratory birds, its distribution includes a large variety of countries. For example, ''C. serratus'' has been found in hospitals and rooms in Northern [[India]],<ref name =hospitalsandhouses/> in soil samples in [[Berlin]]<ref name =berlin/> and on [[Cloven hoof|hooves]] and horns in goats and sheep in [[Egypt]].<ref name= egypt/>\n\n==Human and animal health implications==\n''Ctenomyces serratus'' is not considered pathogenic to humans; however, skin lesions and inhibited hair growth have been found in guinea pigs<ref name = eidam/> while it can be an etiological agent in nail infections.<ref name=infection/> In addition, a novel [[kappa opioid receptor]] binding inhibitor has been extracted from it.<ref name=\"kappaantag\" /> Its relevance to human health is based on Kappa opioid receptors, when highly activated, having negative effects that mimic those of depression, drug-seeking behaviour, and drug craving. As such, extracts of such inhibitory agents hold promise as potential sources of treatment for addressing drug-related dependence and addictions.<ref name=kappaantag/> This is mainly because these receptors are implicated in [[reward system]]s that lie at the root of addiction-related disorders.<ref name = kappa/>\n\n==References==\n {{Reflist | 30em | refs =\n\n<ref name=berlin>{{cite journal |last1=B\u00f6hme |first1=H. |title=''Ctenomyces serratus'' Eidam in Bodenproben aus Berlin |journal=Mycoses |date=September 1965 |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=108\u2013114 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0507.1965.tb02375.x }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"benjamin1956\">{{cite journal |last1=Benjamin |first1=R.

Many accounts have shown that it has a global distribution, having been isolated in select soils as well as on feathers and other substrates with high keratin content. It has also been found in indoor dust of hospitals and houses in [[Kanpur]], Northern [[India]] and as a common keratinophilic soil fungus in urban Berlin. This species has been associated with nail infections in humans as well as skin lesions and slower hair growth in [[guinea pigs]].\n\n==History and taxonomy==\n''Ctenomyces serratus'' was first discovered on a rotten, old feather by Eidam in 1880.<ref name= Orr1963/> When discovering it, Eidam observed different structures and assumed he was looking at different stages of growth of the fungus. However, in 1956 [[Chester Ray Benjamin|Benjamin]] revealed that Eidam's observations unintentionally included a species of ''Arthroderma''.<ref name=\"benjamin1956\" /> The fungus is a member of the family of [[Onygenaceae]].<ref name=\"currah1985\" /> The etymology of the species epithet \"serratus\" is derived from the Latin ''serra'' which means \"saw\" due to the saw-tooth appearance of peridial appendages.<ref name = eidam/>\n\n==Structural appearance and physiology==\nIts [[ascomata]] are orange-brown, rounded and measure approximately 100&ndash;350 \u03bcm in diameter, exclusive of its appendages.<ref name=eidam/> Its [[ascus|asci]] are hyaline and rounded, containing 8 lens-shaped, orange, ascospores, 7 \u03bcm in diameter.<ref name = eidam/> In addition, their [[wikt:peridium|peridial appendages]] are pale-orange and have a membranous inner layer with an outer layer of orange-brown, [[septate]], thick-walled and prickly hyphae that form a highly ramified mesh-like [[peridium]] with [[anastamosis|anastamosing]] connections.<ref name = eidam/> With its [[teleomorph]]ic stages being more commonly found, its [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|anamorph]] state is absent or rare, having large amounts of [[arthroconidia]].<ref name = eidam/> The conidial state has been treated in the form-genus, ''Chrysosporium''.<ref name = chrysosporium/><ref name=\"currah1985\" /> ''C. serratus'' is generally regarded to be heterothallic, only forming the [[ascus|sexual]] state when crossed with the compatible mating type;<ref name = mating/> however, the possibility has been raised that it may in fact be [[homothallism|homothallic]].<ref name = eidam/> Notably, its appendages are roughened, tooth-like and between 100\u2013150 \u03bcm in length with 5&ndash;11 cells.<ref name = eidam/> Growth is reliant on nitrogen sources that include the [[Absolute Configuration|L configurations]] of the [[amino acids]] [[alanine]], [[isoleucine]], [[methionine]], [[tyrosine]] and [[glycine]].<ref name=eidam/> This species prefers neutral to slightly [[alkaline]] conditions.<ref name = pH/> It can utilize [[fructose]] and is dependent on external sources of the B-vitamin, [[thiamine]].<ref name = pH/> One comparative study showed that its growth is only supported in amino acid mixtures and [[casein]] protein media.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} There has been suggestion that ''C. serratus'' may be able to fix atmospheric nitrogen.<ref name=fungic/> Commonly used [[fungicide]]s are active against this species, including: [[Benlate]], [[Calix Limited|Calix]] and Saprol.<ref name=fungic/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n\n{{Location map many| World\n| width   = 500\n| length  = 1000\n| float   = right\n| caption = Localities where ''C. serratus'' has been isolated\n| label = Argentina\n  | pos1 = right\n  | marksize1 = 1\n  | coordinates1 = {{coord|-38.42|-63.62}}\n| label2 = Canada\n  | pos2 = right\n  | marksize2 = 1\n  | coordinates2 = {{coord|56.13|-106.3}}\n| label3 = Slovakia\n  | pos3 = bottom left\n  | marksize3 = 1\n  | coordinates3 = {{coord|51|19.70}}\n| label4 = Spain\n  | pos4 = left\n  | marksize4 = 1\n  | coordinates4 = {{coord|40.12|-3}}\n| label5 = India\n  | pos5 = right\n  | marksize5 = 1\n  | coordinates5 = {{coord|20.59|78.96}}\n| label6 = USA\n  | pos6 = right\n  | marksize6 = 1\n  | coordinates6 = {{coord|37.09|-95.71}}\n| label7 = UK\n  | pos7 = left\n  | marksize7 = 1\n  | coordinates7 = {{coord|52.36|-1}}\n| label8 = Iraq\n  | pos8 = top\n  | marksize8 = 1\n  | coordinates8 = {{coord|33.22|43.68}}\n| label9 = Easter Island\n  | pos9 = right\n  | marksize9 = 1\n  | coordinates9 = {{coord|-27.11|-109.35}}\n| label10 = New Guinea\n  | pos10 = top\n  | marksize10 = 1\n  | coordinates10 = {{coord|-6.32|143.96}}\n| label11 = Galapagos Islands\n  | pos11 = right\n  | marksize11 = 1\n  | coordinates11 = {{coord|-0.95|-90.97}}\n| label12 = Germany\n  | pos12 = top\n  | marksize12 = 1\n  | coordinates12 = {{coord|54|10.45}}\n| label13 = Australia\n  | pos13 = right\n  | marksize13 = 1\n  | coordinates13 = {{coord|-25.27|133.78}}\n| label14 = Italy\n  | pos14 = right\n  | marksize14 = 1\n  | coordinates14 = {{coord|41.87|12.56}}\n| label15 = Kuwait\n  | pos15 = right\n  | marksize15 = 1\n  | coordinates15 = {{coord|29.31|47.48}}\n| label16 = Egypt\n  | pos16 = left\n  | marksize16 = 1\n  | coordinates16 = {{coord|26.82|30.80}}\n| label17 = South Korea\n  | pos17 = right\n  | marksize17 = 1\n  | coordinates17 = {{coord|35.91|127.77}}\n| label18 = Nigeria\n  | pos18 = right\n  | marksize18 = 1\n  | coordinates18 = {{coord|9.08|8.68}}\n| label19 = France\n  | pos19 = left\n  | marksize19 = 1\n  | coordinates19 = {{coord|46.23|2.21}}\n}}\n\n''Ctenomyces serratus'' is world-wide in distribution and shows some degree of habitat overlap with other keratinophilic fungi in the families, [[Arthrodermataceae]] and [[Onygenaceae]], due perhaps in part to its spread across political borders on feathered hosts. Literature reports document this species from 19 countries worldwide, with most specimens found in select soils, birds nests and animal [[wiktionary:dung|excrements]]. A single case of its appearance in [[turkeys]] has been found as well.\n\nWith most of its growth being on shed feathers due to its keratinophilic nature, this fungal species tends to grow wherever its host happens to lay shed feathers. Because of its strong association with migratory birds, its distribution includes a large variety of countries. For example, ''C. serratus'' has been found in hospitals and rooms in Northern [[India]],<ref name =hospitalsandhouses/> in soil samples in [[Berlin]]<ref name =berlin/> and on [[Cloven hoof|hooves]] and horns in goats and sheep in [[Egypt]].<ref name= egypt/>\n\n==Human and animal health implications==\n''Ctenomyces serratus'' is not considered pathogenic to humans; however, skin lesions and inhibited hair growth have been found in guinea pigs<ref name = eidam/> while it can be an etiological agent in nail infections.<ref name=infection/> In addition, a novel [[kappa opioid receptor]] binding inhibitor has been extracted from it.<ref name=\"kappaantag\" /> Its relevance to human health is based on Kappa opioid receptors, when highly activated, having negative effects that mimic those of depression, drug-seeking behaviour, and drug craving. As such, extracts of such inhibitory agents hold promise as potential sources of treatment for addressing drug-related dependence and addictions.<ref name=kappaantag/> This is mainly because these receptors are implicated in [[reward system]]s that lie at the root of addiction-related disorders.<ref name = kappa/>\n\n==References==\n {{Reflist | 30em | refs =\n\n<ref name=berlin>{{cite journal |last1=B\u00f6hme |first1=H. |title=''Ctenomyces serratus'' Eidam in Bodenproben aus Berlin |journal=Mycoses |date=September 1965 |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=108\u2013114 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0507.1965.tb02375.x }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"benjamin1956\">{{cite journal |last1=Benjamin |first1=R.

Primarily featured in his [[Epic (genre)|epic]] [[high fantasy]] novel ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1954), these magic rings are depicted as the titular objects essential in the [[Dark Lord (fiction)|Dark Lord]] [[Sauron]]'s conquest to rule over [[Middle-earth]] as the namesake \"Lord of the Rings\". Consisting of twenty bands in total, all but one were created by the [[Noldor]]in [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elven]]-smiths of Eregion, led by their ruler Celebrimbor under the deception of Sauron, who came in disguise as a fair-looking emissary named Annatar.\n\nWhen worn, each Ring can give its [[Ring-bearer|bearer]] a power to govern their respective [[Middle-earth peoples|race]]\u2014[[Three Rings]] were given to the remaining Elf leaders in Middle-earth, [[Seven Rings]] were sent to the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf-lords]], and [[Nine Rings]] to several leaders of [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]]. All Rings of Power are bound to a master ring, [[One Ring|the One]], which the Dark Lord had forged alone in secret at [[Mount Doom]] to control all the other wearers, effectively ruling a dominion over Middle-earth. Sauron waged an assault upon the Elves who hid them upon discovering his true motive. He successfully captured all but the Three, which remained hidden from him. Though the Seven only fueled the greed of the Dwarves, the Nine corrupted the men, whose desire for power made them fall under his dominance and eventually become the [[Nazg\u00fbl]], his chief servants. Numerous characters in the novel had taken possession of the Rings, most especially the One Ring, which was ultimately found by the [[hobbit]] [[Bilbo Baggins]], who later bequeathed it to his heir [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], who then took on a quest to destroy it.\n\nThough the One Ring had originally appeared in Tolkien's [[Juvenile fantasy|children's fantasy]] novel ''[[The Hobbit]]'' in 1937, all the twenty Rings of Power were fully documented in ''The Lord of the Rings'', which primarily focuses on the assembly of the [[The Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship]] from all of races of Middle-earth tasked to aid Frodo in destroying it whilst evading Sauron's attempts to recover it. According to Tolkien, the purpose of the Rings was to give their respective wearers \"wealth and dominion over others\", though Three Rings were made to \"heal and preserve\" the Elvendom in Middle-earth. Its primary power was \"the prevention and slowing of ''decay'' of time\" by granting its wearer an unnatural long life and rendering things invisible or visible. This power appealed the most to the Elves, whose gift of immortality had left them to desire for a physical world of Middle-earth to remain unchanged and delay the inevitable [[Dominion of Men]]. Tolkien's subsequent posthumous works such as ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', and ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', also offer a more detailed account on the history of the Rings of Power.\n\n== Fictional history ==\n{{see also|Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age}}\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = <poem>\n''Three Rings for the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elven]]-kings under the sky,''\n  ''Seven for the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]]-lords in their halls of stone,''\n''Nine for Mortal [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] doomed to die,''\n  ''One for the [[Sauron|Dark Lord]] on his dark throne,''\n''In the Land of [[Mordor]] where the Shadows lie,''\n  ''One Ring to rule them all, one Ring to find them,''\n  ''One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them''\n''In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie''</poem>\n |author = \u2014 [[J.R.R.

In the year 1200 of the Second Age, the Dark Lord [[Sauron]], disguised as a fair-looking emissary of the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]] named Annatar, the Lord of Gifts, persuaded Celebrimbor to help him.<ref name=\"Unfinished Tales 1\" group=T/> Humiliated by the fall of his master [[Morgoth]], Sauron had evaded the summons in [[Valinor]] to surrender and face judgment, opting instead to remain in [[Middle-earth]] and seek dominion over the Elves and the men of [[N\u00famen\u00f3r]].<ref name=\"Silmarillion 1\" group=T>{{harvp|Tolkien|1977|loc=Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age|p=298}}</ref> He was shunned by the Elven leaders [[Gil-galad]], [[C\u00edrdan]], [[Elrond]] and [[Galadriel]], but was successful in persuading Celebrimbor.<ref name=\"Silmarillion 1\" group=T/> Teaching him and his fellow smiths the craft of forging magic rings, they were able to create sets of Seven and Nine rings.

While the Nine were destroyed, the Three were carried out to [[Aman (Middle-earth)|the Sea]] at the end of the Third Age, giving the rise to the [[Dominion of Men]].{{Sfnp|Drout|2006|p=573}}<ref group=T>{{harvp|Tolkien|1955|loc=The Grey Havens}}</ref><ref name=\"Silmarillion 1\" group=T/>\n\n== Description ==\n\n=== The Three ===\n{{main|Three Rings}}\n\nCelebrimbor forged the Three Rings in Eregion without Sauron's direct assistance. Although \"unsullied\" by Sauron's hand, they were made by his craft and were bound to the One. Named for the three [[classical element|elements]] of fire, water, and air, these were the last rings to be made, and were given to the Elves to ward off the decay of time and to postpone weariness of the world.<ref name=\"Silmarillion 1\" group=T/>\n\n* Narya (the Ring of Fire, the Red Ring) was set with a ruby. Celebrimbor gave it to Gil-galad, who later gave it to C\u00edrdan.  C\u00edrdan entrusted it to [[Gandalf]] at the Grey Havens to aid in his labours.<ref name=\"Three Rings 1\" group=T/>\n* Nenya (the Ring of Water, the White Ring, the Ring of Adamant) was the chief of the Three. It was made of [[mithril]] and set with a \"shimmering white stone\". Celebrimbor gave it to Galadriel, who used it to protect and preserve the realm of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]].<ref name=\"Silmarillion 1\" group=T/>\n* Vilya (the Ring of Air, the Blue Ring) was the mightiest of the Three. It was made of gold and set with a Sapphire. Celebrimbor gave the ring to Gil-galad, and Gil-galad gave it in turn to Elrond, who used the ring in [[Rivendell]].<ref name=\"Silmarillion 1\" group=T/>\n\nWhen Sauron set the One Ring upon his finger, the Elves became aware of him and realized that he could use the One to control the Three. They immediately took off the rings to forestall him. Sauron demanded that the Three be given to him,<ref name=\"Silmarillion 1\" group=T/> but Galadriel counseled Celebrimbor to keep the Three Rings hidden.<ref name=\"Three Rings 1\" group=T/> Sauron fought the Elves to obtain them, and captured and tortured Celebrimbor, who died without revealing the rings' location.<ref name=\"Unfinished Tales 1\" group=T/> Sauron could not discover where they were hidden, and only after his defeat at the end of the Second Age, when the One Ring was cut from his finger, did the Elves begin to use them. The rings were rendered powerless when the One Ring was destroyed at the end of the Third Age, and their respective bearers carried them over the sea to the Undying Lands.<ref name=\"Silmarillion 1\" group=T/>\n\n=== The Seven ===\n{{redirect|Seven Rings|the Ariana Grande song|7 Rings}}\nThe Seven Rings were given to the leaders of the seven kindreds of the Dwarves\u2014[[Durin's Folk]], Firebeards, Broadbeams, Ironfists, Stiffbeards, Blacklocks, and Stonefoots;{{Sfnp|Strachan|Moseley|2017|p=62}} though a tradition by the Durin's Folk claimed that Durin received his ring from the Elven-smiths.<ref group=T>{{harvp|Tolkien|1955|loc=Appendix A: III. Durin's Folk}}</ref><ref name=\"Unfinished Tales 1\" group=T/> The Dwarves used their rings to increase their hoards of treasure, but Sauron failed to submit them to his will, nor did it render them invisible. Instead, he was only able to influence their sense of greed and anger.<ref name=\"Silmarillion 1\" group=T/> Over the years, Sauron was only successful in recovering three rings from the Dwarves, the last of which was seized from [[Thr\u00e1in II]] during his captivity in [[Dol Guldur]]. The rest of the Dwarves had only found out on the [[Council of Elrond]] that the ring in Thr\u00e1in's possession was the fabled Durin's ring.<ref name=\"Fellowship 2\" group=T/> Gandalf later recollects to Frodo that the remaining four were consumed by dragons.<ref name=\"Fellowship 1\" group=T/> Before the outbreak of the [[War of the Ring]], an envoy from Sauron attempted to bribe [[Dain II Ironfoot]] of the [[Lonely Mountain]] the three surviving rings and lost realm of [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]] in exchange for the recovery of the One Ring, to which Dain II refused.<ref name=\"Fellowship 2\" group=T/>\n\n=== The Nine ===\n{{see also|Nazg\u00fbl}}\nCelebrimbor and Annatar forged Nine Rings of Power which were meant to be given the men of Middle-earth. When Eregion was sacked, Sauron took them from a tortured Celebrimbor and later gave them several leaders of men\u2014three of which were from N\u00famen\u00f3r and one was an [[Easterling]]. The nine men who used their rings became \"mighty in their day, kings, sorcerers, and warriors of old.\" Giving them glory and great wealth, the rings also gave them an unending long life, yet it became unendurable to them. In addition, the rings gave to an ability to see things in worlds invisible to mortal men, but these are often the phantoms and delusions made by Sauron.<ref name=\"Silmarillion 1\" group=T/> One by one, they fell to the power of the One Ring and after 550 years, all nine of them have been turned into ring-wraiths \u2014 also known as the [[Nazg\u00fbl]].<ref group=T>{{harvp|Tolkien|1955|loc=Appendix B}}</ref> Bound to Sauron's will, they became invisible slave to him, and became his chief servants.<ref name=\"Silmarillion 1\" group=T/>\n\n=== The One ===\n{{main|The One Ring}}\n\n[[File:Unico Anello.png|thumb|upright|The [[One Ring]] was made by [[Sauron]] to rule all the others.]]\n\nThe One Ring was forged in the fires [[Mount Doom]] in secret by Sauron himself to rule over the wearers of the other Rings, and only there it can be unmade. Unlike the other Rings, the One was created as an unadorned gold band, but it bore the inscription of Sauron's incantation that can only become visible when heated by fire.<ref name=\"Fellowship 1\" group=T/> As the Rings of Power were made under the influence of the Sauron, the power of all Rings can only endure as long as its master ring survives.{{Sfnp|Drout|2006|p=573}}<ref group=T>{{harvp|Tolkien|1955|loc=The Grey Havens}}</ref> Sauron had to imbue much of his strength and will in making it, as the power of Elven Rings was very great, and for that which should govern them must be a thing of surpassing potency. While Sauron wore the One, he can perceive all that were done by means using the lesser Rings, and he could see and govern the very thoughts of those who wore them, and used it to gain mastery for almost all of Eriador, except for Lindon. Following Sauron's defeat to Elendil and Gil-galad at the War of the Last Alliance, the Ring was cut from his hand by Isildur, who took it as a [[weregild]] for his own and refused Elrond and C\u00edrdan's counsel to destroy it.<ref name=\"Silmarillion 1\" group=T/>\n\nIsildur bore the Ring as an heirloom of his house, but his host was ambushed by orcs on the river [[Anduin]]. Caught unguarded, he used the Ring to escape down the river, but he was betrayed by the Ring when it purposely slipped down his finger, leading him to his death.<ref name=\"Silmarillion 1\" group=T/> And for more than two and a half thousand years, the One Ring remained hidden on the riverbed and from all knowledge, until it was discovered by the Stoor hobbit [[D\u00e9agol]], accompanied by his friend [[Gollum|Sm\u00e9agol]]. It ensnared Sm\u00e9agol to murder D\u00e9agol and take the Ring for himself. For five hundred years deep within the [[Misty Mountains]], it corrupted him into becoming the creature Gollum, who called the Ring as his \"precious\".<ref name=\"Fellowship 1\" group=T/> It was then found by the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]] hobbit [[Bilbo Baggins]], who took the Ring from him as a prize during a [[riddle game|game of riddles]].<ref name=\"The Hobbit 1\" group=T>{{harvp|Tolkien|1937|ps=: In the first published edition of ''The Hobbit'', Gollum is portrayed as less obsessed with the One Ring, even offering it as a prize to Bilbo Baggins. This was later revised in the annotated version to correct the inconsistency of his characterization in ''The Lord of the Rings''.}}</ref>\n\nOnly perceiving it as a magic ring, Bilbo brought the One with him to the Shire and later bequeathed it to his heir [[Frodo Baggins]].<ref name=\"Fellowship 1\" group=T/> Made aware of its true nature as the master Ring of Power by the wizard [[Gandalf]], Frodo escaped the Shire with the Ring to seek refuge to Rivendell, where it was decided by the Council of Elrond to destroy it.

Primarily featured in his [[Epic (genre)|epic]] [[high fantasy]] novel ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1954), these magic rings are depicted as the titular objects essential in the [[Dark Lord (fiction)|Dark Lord]] [[Sauron]]'s conquest to rule over [[Middle-earth]] as the namesake \"Lord of the Rings\". Consisting of twenty bands in total, all but one were created by the [[Noldor]]in [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elven]]-smiths of Eregion, led by their ruler Celebrimbor under the deception of Sauron, who came in disguise as a fair-looking emissary named Annatar.\n\nWhen worn, each Ring can give its [[Ring-bearer|bearer]] a power to govern their respective [[Middle-earth peoples|race]]\u2014[[Three Rings]] were given to the remaining Elf leaders in Middle-earth, [[Seven Rings]] were sent to the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf-lords]], and [[Nine Rings]] to several leaders of [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]]. All Rings of Power are bound to a master ring, [[One Ring|the One]], which the Dark Lord had forged alone in secret at [[Mount Doom]] to control all the other wearers, effectively ruling a dominion over Middle-earth. Sauron waged an assault upon the Elves who hid them upon discovering his true motive. He successfully captured all but the Three, which remained hidden from him. Though the Seven only fueled the greed of the Dwarves, the Nine corrupted the men, whose desire for power made them fall under his dominance and eventually become the [[Nazg\u00fbl]], his chief servants. Numerous characters in the novel had taken possession of the Rings, most especially the One Ring, which was ultimately found by the [[hobbit]] [[Bilbo Baggins]], who later bequeathed it to his heir [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], who then took on a quest to destroy it.\n\nThough the One Ring had originally appeared in Tolkien's [[Juvenile fantasy|children's fantasy]] novel ''[[The Hobbit]]'' in 1937, all the twenty Rings of Power were fully documented in ''The Lord of the Rings'', which primarily focuses on the assembly of the [[The Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship]] from all of races of Middle-earth tasked to aid Frodo in destroying it whilst evading Sauron's attempts to recover it. According to Tolkien, the purpose of the Rings was to give their respective wearers \"wealth and dominion over others\", though Three Rings were made to \"heal and preserve\" the Elvendom in Middle-earth. Its primary power was \"the prevention and slowing of ''decay'' of time\" by granting its wearer an unnatural long life and rendering things invisible or visible.

Celebrimbor gave it to Gil-galad, who later gave it to C\u00edrdan.  C\u00edrdan entrusted it to [[Gandalf]] at the Grey Havens to aid in his labours.<ref name=\"Three Rings 1\" group=T/>\n* Nenya (the Ring of Water, the White Ring, the Ring of Adamant) was the chief of the Three. It was made of [[mithril]] and set with a \"shimmering white stone\". Celebrimbor gave it to Galadriel, who used it to protect and preserve the realm of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]].<ref name=\"Silmarillion 1\" group=T/>\n* Vilya (the Ring of Air, the Blue Ring) was the mightiest of the Three. It was made of gold and set with a Sapphire. Celebrimbor gave the ring to Gil-galad, and Gil-galad gave it in turn to Elrond, who used the ring in [[Rivendell]].<ref name=\"Silmarillion 1\" group=T/>\n\nWhen Sauron set the One Ring upon his finger, the Elves became aware of him and realized that he could use the One to control the Three. They immediately took off the rings to forestall him. Sauron demanded that the Three be given to him,<ref name=\"Silmarillion 1\" group=T/> but Galadriel counseled Celebrimbor to keep the Three Rings hidden.<ref name=\"Three Rings 1\" group=T/> Sauron fought the Elves to obtain them, and captured and tortured Celebrimbor, who died without revealing the rings' location.<ref name=\"Unfinished Tales 1\" group=T/> Sauron could not discover where they were hidden, and only after his defeat at the end of the Second Age, when the One Ring was cut from his finger, did the Elves begin to use them.

When Eregion was sacked, Sauron took them from a tortured Celebrimbor and later gave them several leaders of men\u2014three of which were from N\u00famen\u00f3r and one was an [[Easterling]]. The nine men who used their rings became \"mighty in their day, kings, sorcerers, and warriors of old.\" Giving them glory and great wealth, the rings also gave them an unending long life, yet it became unendurable to them. In addition, the rings gave to an ability to see things in worlds invisible to mortal men, but these are often the phantoms and delusions made by Sauron.<ref name=\"Silmarillion 1\" group=T/> One by one, they fell to the power of the One Ring and after 550 years, all nine of them have been turned into ring-wraiths \u2014 also known as the [[Nazg\u00fbl]].<ref group=T>{{harvp|Tolkien|1955|loc=Appendix B}}</ref> Bound to Sauron's will, they became invisible save to him, and became his chief servants.<ref name=\"Silmarillion 1\" group=T/>\n\n=== The One ===\n{{main|The One Ring}}\n\n[[File:Unico Anello.png|thumb|upright|The [[One Ring]] was made by [[Sauron]] to rule all the others.]]\n\nThe One Ring was forged in the fires [[Mount Doom]] in secret by Sauron himself to rule over the wearers of the other Rings, and only there it can be unmade.

While Sauron wore the One, he can perceive all that were done by means using the lesser Rings, and he could see and govern the very thoughts of those who wore them, and used it to gain mastery for almost all of Eriador, except for Lindon. Following Sauron's defeat to Elendil and Gil-galad at the War of the Last Alliance, the Ring was cut from his hand by Isildur, who took it as a [[weregild]] for his own and refused Elrond and C\u00edrdan's counsel to destroy it.<ref name=\"Silmarillion 1\" group=T/>\n\nIsildur bore the Ring as an heirloom of his house, but his host was ambushed by orcs on the river [[Anduin]]. Caught unguarded, he used the Ring to escape down the river, but he was betrayed by the Ring when it purposely slipped down his finger, leading him to his death.<ref name=\"Silmarillion 1\" group=T/> And for more than two and a half thousand years, the One Ring remained hidden on the riverbed and from all knowledge, until it was discovered by the Stoor hobbit [[D\u00e9agol]], accompanied by his friend [[Gollum|Sm\u00e9agol]]. It ensnared Sm\u00e9agol to murder D\u00e9agol and take the Ring for himself.

While there, and with Rubirosa as his liaison, Ramfis skipped class and took off for [[Hollywood]], eventually embarking on an affair with actress [[Kim Novak]]. Ramfis became notorious for buying luxury cars, [[mink]] coats, and jewelry for beautiful girls during his stay.  Ramfis's flashy gift-giving made the national news and members of the [[United States Congress]] were openly questioned by the press about what real use was being made of foreign aid given to the Dominican Republic.  At one point a bumper sticker began appearing on the cars of girls in Los Angeles that read: \"THIS CAR WAS NOT A GIFT FROM RAMFIS TRUJILLO\". {{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nSince his attendance at the military school was erratic at best, he was denied his diploma after completion. This fact greatly infuriated, and at the same time, humiliated his father.\n\nWhen he returned home, his wife Octavia filed for divorce.  His unruly behavior, including [[gang rape]]s of young women and frivolously ordering murders, forced his father to send him to a [[sanatorium]] in Belgium. Ramfis apparently suffered from psychological problems, possibly the result of the pressure that his father constantly placed on him, as he intended to remake his son into an image of himself. Dominican historian [[Bernardo Vega]] has documented Ramfis's history of mental hospital stays, and Robert Crassweller also wrote about it in his Trujillo's biography. Ramfis received [[electroshock]] treatments in Belgium as early as 1958; there were also stays in mental hospitals after that.\n\nNot long after all this, he moved to Paris to resume his socialite lifestyle. Many of these actions have most historians convinced that Ramfis never wanted to be a ruler like his father and that he just wanted to live the carefree and ''bon vivant'' life of a playboy, shunning any sort of responsibility. [[Lita Milan]] (n\u00e9e Iris Lia Menshell) became his second official wife during these years. She was an American of [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] immigrant parents, who had a short but relatively successful film career in Hollywood, most notably in ''[[The Left Handed Gun]]'', opposite [[Paul Newman]]. Because of her black hair and dark good looks, Lita was often cast as Latino and Native American girls.  They had two children.\n\n==Influential years==\n\nOn 30 May 1961, his father was assassinated in a plot to end the 31-year-long dictatorial regime. Ramfis quickly returned to the country and, with the help of [[Johnny Abbes Garc\u00eda]], the ruthless intelligence chief, brutally repressed any elements believed to be connected with his father's death, murdering many of the suspects himself.  However, soon afterward, he and puppet president [[Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer]] took some steps to open up the regime.  Ramfis eased his father's harsh censorship of the press, and also granted some civil liberties.  While these were rejected as insufficient by a people who had memories only of the Trujillo era and the decades of poverty and instability which had preceded it (for example: 1902&ndash;1905 [[bankruptcy]], 1911 [[Dominican Civil War (1911\u201312)|Civil War]], 1914 political deadlock and threat of U.S. invasion, [[United States occupation of the Dominican Republic (1916\u201324)|1916&ndash;1924 U.S. occupation]]).<ref name=\"Dominican Republic\">Dominican Republic</ref> even these meager reforms were opposed by the hardliners gathered around Ramfis' uncles.<ref name=\"Dominican Republic\"/>\n\nBoth internal and external pressures forced him into exile late in 1961, when he fled back to France, along with all of the surviving Trujillos, aboard the famed yacht ''Angelita'' (still sailing today as the cruise ship ''[[USCGC Sea Cloud (WPG-284)|Sea Cloud]]''), with his father's casket, which was allegedly lined with $4 million in cash, jewels and important papers.\n\nIn 1962, he settled down in Spain where he was protected by Generalisimo [[Francisco Franco]]. There he continued with his [[jet-set]] lifestyle, which included flying planes as a hobby (also one of the passions of Rubirosa).\n\nHe died on 27 December 1969, in Spain, from [[pneumonia]], in a hospital after being severely injured in a car accident, a fate similar to Rubirosa's, 11 days earlier in the outskirts of [[Madrid]]. The person in the car he hit, [[Teresa Bertr\u00e1n de Lis]], the [[Beltr\u00e1n Alfonso Osorio, 18th duke of Alburquerque|Duchess-consort of Alburquerque]], died instantly.<ref name=junot/>  \nTrujillo was initially buried in Madrid's [[Cementerio de la Almudena|Almudena]] cemetery, but his remains were subsequently moved to [[Mingorrubio Cemetery]] in [[El Pardo]] to accompany his father's remains.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://almomento.net/news/133/ARTICLE/8118/2008-04-11.html |title=Solitaria, en cementerio poco importante, est\u00e1 la tumba de Trujillo |last=Castellanos |first=Eddy |date=11 Apr 2008 |publisher=Almomento.net |language=Spanish |accessdate=14 November 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63BemmZHx?url=http://almomento.net/news/133/ARTICLE/8118/2008-04-11.html |archivedate=14 November 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>  Trujillo was driving at the time of the accident a [[Ferrari 330]]GT sports car (s/n 9151), a blue 2-door purchased in 1966.

Ramfis's flashy gift-giving made the national news and members of the [[United States Congress]] were openly questioned by the press about what real use was being made of foreign aid given to the Dominican Republic.  At one point a bumper sticker began appearing on the cars of girls in Los Angeles that read: \"THIS CAR WAS NOT A GIFT FROM RAMFIS TRUJILLO\". {{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nSince his attendance at the military school was erratic at best, he was denied his diploma after completion. This fact greatly infuriated, and at the same time, humiliated his father.\n\nWhen he returned home, his wife Octavia filed for divorce.  His unruly behavior, including [[gang rape]]s of young women and frivolously ordering murders, forced his father to send him to a [[sanatorium]] in Belgium. Ramfis apparently suffered from psychological problems, possibly the result of the pressure that his father constantly placed on him, as he intended to remake his son into an image of himself. Dominican historian [[Bernardo Vega]] has documented Ramfis's history of mental hospital stays, and Robert Crassweller also wrote about it in his Trujillo's biography. Ramfis received [[electroshock]] treatments in Belgium as early as 1958; there were also stays in mental hospitals after that.\n\nNot long after all this, he moved to Paris to resume his socialite lifestyle. Many of these actions have most historians convinced that Ramfis never wanted to be a ruler like his father and that he just wanted to live the carefree and ''bon vivant'' life of a playboy, shunning any sort of responsibility. [[Lita Milan]] (n\u00e9e Iris Lia Menshell) became his second official wife during these years. She was an American of [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] immigrant parents, who had a short but relatively successful film career in Hollywood, most notably in ''[[The Left Handed Gun]]'', opposite [[Paul Newman]]. Because of her black hair and dark good looks, Lita was often cast as Latino and Native American girls.  They had two children.\n\n==Influential years==\n\nOn 30 May 1961, his father was assassinated in a plot to end the 31-year-long dictatorial regime. Ramfis quickly returned to the country and, with the help of [[Johnny Abbes Garc\u00eda]], the ruthless intelligence chief, brutally repressed any elements believed to be connected with his father's death, murdering many of the suspects himself.  However, soon afterward, he and puppet president [[Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer]] took some steps to open up the regime.  Ramfis eased his father's harsh censorship of the press, and also granted some civil liberties.  While these were rejected as insufficient by a people who had memories only of the Trujillo era and the decades of poverty and instability which had preceded it (for example: 1902&ndash;1905 [[bankruptcy]], 1911 [[Dominican Civil War (1911\u201312)|Civil War]], 1914 political deadlock and threat of U.S. invasion, [[United States occupation of the Dominican Republic (1916\u201324)|1916&ndash;1924 U.S. occupation]]).<ref name=\"Dominican Republic\">Dominican Republic</ref> even these meager reforms were opposed by the hardliners gathered around Ramfis' uncles.<ref name=\"Dominican Republic\"/>\n\nBoth internal and external pressures forced him into exile late in 1961, when he fled back to France, along with all of the surviving Trujillos, aboard the famed yacht ''Angelita'' (still sailing today as the cruise ship ''[[USCGC Sea Cloud (WPG-284)|Sea Cloud]]''), with his father's casket, which was allegedly lined with $4 million in cash, jewels and important papers.\n\nIn 1962, he settled down in Spain where he was protected by Generalisimo [[Francisco Franco]]. There he continued with his [[jet-set]] lifestyle, which included flying planes as a hobby (also one of the passions of Rubirosa).\n\nHe died on 27 December 1969, in Spain, from [[pneumonia]], in a hospital after being severely injured in a car accident, a fate similar to Rubirosa's, 11 days earlier in the outskirts of [[Madrid]]. The person in the car he hit, [[Teresa Bertr\u00e1n de Lis]], the [[Beltr\u00e1n Alfonso Osorio, 18th duke of Alburquerque|Duchess-consort of Alburquerque]], died instantly.<ref name=junot/>  \nTrujillo was initially buried in Madrid's [[Cementerio de la Almudena|Almudena]] cemetery, but his remains were subsequently moved to [[Mingorrubio Cemetery]] in [[El Pardo]] to accompany his father's remains.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://almomento.net/news/133/ARTICLE/8118/2008-04-11.html |title=Solitaria, en cementerio poco importante, est\u00e1 la tumba de Trujillo |last=Castellanos |first=Eddy |date=11 Apr 2008 |publisher=Almomento.net |language=Spanish |accessdate=14 November 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63BemmZHx?url=http://almomento.net/news/133/ARTICLE/8118/2008-04-11.html |archivedate=14 November 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>  Trujillo was driving at the time of the accident a [[Ferrari 330]]GT sports car (s/n 9151), a blue 2-door purchased in 1966.
