The soft launch called for opening the league with fewer teams than planned and playing an abbreviated schedule. They hoped a functioning league would yield the UFL a superior position for attracting potential owners over competing leagues still under development (like the New USFL, which at the time was trumpeting a spring 2010 launch).\n\nThe markets chosen for the [[2009 UFL season|premiere season]] were New York City ([[Hartford Colonials|Sentinels]]), Las Vegas ([[Las Vegas Locomotives|Locomotives]]), Orlando ([[Florida Tuskers]]), and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] ([[Sacramento Mountain Lions|California Redwoods]]).  The league's short schedule made the kind of expensive promotional efforts often employed with a new league cost prohibitive. Additionally, the league had a full schedule of three home games in the same stadium in only one of their selected cities, Las Vegas.\n\nDuring the week of August 10, 2009, the four team names and their uniform jerseys were revealed. Each of the uniforms (and the team logos and helmets that were unveiled on October 2)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/United-Football-League-prnews-3774862174.html?x=0&.v=1|title=United Football League Reveals Team Logos for 'Premiere' Season|work=[[Yahoo!

Each of the team jerseys had the same design template, complete with a horizontal arc across the top front that resembles the arc on the UFL's logo.\n\nOne of the Redwoods' games was moved to San Jose; the other two were played in San Francisco (the move to San Jose was a short-notice move due to poor attendance in San Francisco; however, the San Jose game ended up being even more poorly attended). The league was unable to secure a fiscally reasonable deal for a stadium within New York City, forcing the league to have the Sentinels play one home game each in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]; on the campus of [[Hofstra University]] in [[Long Island]], and in [[New Jersey]]. In addition, one of the Tuskers' games was played at [[Tropicana Field]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], in part because the Tuskers shared ownership that year with the [[Tampa Bay Rays]]; this was not reprised in 2010.\n\nThe Florida Tuskers finished 2009 with a 6&ndash;0 record. The Las Vegas Locomotives were next at 4&ndash;2, the California Redwoods were 2&ndash;4, and the Sentinels were last at 0&ndash;6.

This \"[[Tuck rule (football)|tuck rule]]\" had become one of the most controversial rules in the NFL;<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/14/AR2005101401828.html |title=tuck Rule Hard to Grasp |accessdate=2007-08-06 |work=The Washington Post |first=Mark |last=Maske |date=2005-10-15 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914201115/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/14/AR2005101401828.html |archivedate=2010-09-14 }}</ref> in the UFL, however, an identical play was called a fumble. The tuck rule was eliminated by the NFL prior to the 2013 season.\n*'''[[Blitz (American football)|Blitzing]]/Rushing''' &ndash; On each play, the defense must use four [[Lineman (American football)|down linemen]] who must be in a [[three point stance|3-]] or 4-point stance at the snap. No more than six defenders could rush the passer. Penalty for violating this rule was ''illegal defense'' (signaled as unsportsmanlike conduct), with a 15-yard penalty and a first down. This rule was meant to both protect the quarterback and encourage more scoring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omaha.com/article/20100930/SPORTS/709309722/-1#a-break-for-qbs-blitz-restrictions-favor-ufl-offenses|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616042037/http://www.omaha.com/article/20100930/SPORTS/709309722/-1#a-break-for-qbs-blitz-restrictions-favor-ufl-offenses|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-06-16|title=A break for QBs: Blitz restrictions favor UFL offenses|work=[[Omaha World-Herald]]|first=Steven|last=Pivovar|date=2010-09-30|accessdate=2010-10-09}}</ref> A similar rule has been in effect for the NFL's [[Pro Bowl]] for several years.\n*'''Intentional grounding''' &ndash; A quarterback was allowed to intentionally ground the ball to avoid a sack, provided he gets the throw back to the line of scrimmage. He does not have to be outside the pocket to do so.\n*'''Fumbling out of the end zones''' &ndash; If the ball is fumbled forward into and out of the [[end zone]], it is placed back at the spot of the fumble, whereas in the NFL this play is ruled a [[touchback]] and possession goes over to the defending team.\n*'''Instant replay''' &ndash; As opposed to the NFL, where the [[Official (American football)#Referee|referee]] reviews disputed plays (other than turnovers, scoring plays, and plays inside the [[two-minute warning]]) through a video monitor on the sidelines, all UFL replay reviews were viewed upstairs by a replay official, who had 90 seconds to make a ruling.\n*'''[[Touchdown celebration]]s''' &ndash; Player celebrations (individual or group) were permitted only in the end zones or the bench areas.\n*'''[[Face mask (gridiron football)|Face masks]]''' &ndash; The UFL allowed the single-bar face mask, which the NFL had outlawed in 2007. Only one player, punter [[Scott Player]], used the single-bar mask.\n*'''Overtime''' &ndash; Starting in 2010 (for the playoffs) and 2012 (for all other games), the NFL has adopted a modified [[Sudden death (sport)|sudden death]] overtime, where sudden death occurs only if the opening drive of overtime ends in a touchdown (before, any score would immediately end the extra session). The UFL has from its inception employed an overtime system that assures each team at least one possession. Therefore, if the first team scored on their opening drive (even if it is a touchdown), their opponent was then given the opportunity to equal that score on the next drive, or surpass it if the other team's first drive resulted in anything less than a touchdown and [[two-point conversion|2-point conversion]]. If both teams remain tied after each has had one possession, overtime then reverted to sudden death. If the score remains tied after 15 minutes, the game ends in a tie, except that post-season games will be played to a victorious conclusion. The actual application of the OT rules occurred during [[2009 UFL Championship Game|the first UFL championship game in 2009]] when Las Vegas won on a field goal after the first possession by Florida ended in an interception.\n\n===Other differences from NFL===\n*'''[[Official (American football)|Officials]]''' &ndash; The UFL's roster of on-field officials included two women, head linesman Terri Valenti (who joined the league in 2009) and line judge [[Sarah Thomas (American football official)|Sarah Thomas]] (2010).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=4060016|title=United Football League Announces Officials And Explains Rules Differences For 2010 Season|work=United Football League|publisher=OurSportsCentral.com|date=2010-07-29|accessdate=2010-07-29|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174250/http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=4060016|archivedate=2011-06-29}}</ref> The officials wore unique attire during the 2009 inaugural season\u2014red polo shirts with black numbering, lettering, and piping, along with black pants and caps that were the same as in the NFL (white cap for the [[Official (American football)#Referee|referee]], black for the other officials); the combination set them apart from not only their NFL and college brethren but from the teams on the field, none of whom sported red jerseys in 2009. The officials changed to traditional black-and-white-striped uniforms with green accents starting in 2010.\n*'''[[Chain crew]] and markers''' &ndash; Instead of bright orange, the chain crews' equipment (including vests, yardage \"sticks\", down markers, and endzone pylons) were lime green, one of the UFL's signature colors.\n\n==The William Hambrecht Trophy==\nThe trophy given annually to the UFL champions was The [[William Hambrecht]] Trophy, named after the Las Vegas Locos owner and UFL founder. When the trophy was first awarded in 2009, the Hambrecht Trophy displayed similar qualities to the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]]. It featured the star from the UFL logo with a streak coming off of one of the corners down onto the base. This design was scrapped after year one. For the 2010 season, the Hambrecht Trophy was redesigned. It now featured two bases in the shape of the UFL logo connected by four columns with a UFL football on a kicking tee placed on the top base. The previous design was then used as the Championship Game MVP trophy.\n\n==Game scheduling==\nFor the 2009 and 2010 seasons, the UFL scheduled its games on non-traditional evenings for pro football: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings. Though these games conflicted with high school and college football events in some locations, the UFL's scheduling plan was different from that of the National Football League, which is prohibited under federal anti-trust exemption law ([[Title 15 of the United States Code|15 U.S.C.]] \u00a7 1291, i.e., the [[Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961]]) from broadcasting any professional game within seventy-five miles of any inter-collegiate or high school game on any Friday or Saturday, beginning with the second Friday in September and ending the second Saturday in December (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/daily-brief/2007/05/31/first-and-very-long-for-bill-hambrecht |title=First and very long for Bill Hambrecht |first=Megan |last=Barnett |date=2007-05-31 |work=News Blog |publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast Portfolio Magazine |accessdate=2009-02-16 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126005856/http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/daily-brief/2007/05/31/first-and-very-long-for-bill-hambrecht |archivedate=2009-01-26 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the league originally intended to play its games primarily on the traditional Sunday afternoon time setting for professional football, but starting its season in August, a full month before the start of the NFL regular season. However, financial difficulties forced the league to return to its schedule from previous years.\n\nIn 2012 it was announced that games would begin in September and that the schedule would be played over eight weeks. When this announcement was made, it had been anticipated that the league would have expanded beyond four active members. Games were to be played on Wednesday and Friday nights with six weeks of regular season action and two weeks of playoffs, culminating with a championship game in early November. The eventual schedule announced in August 2012 varied somewhat from this, with the regular season extended to eight weeks but only one playoff game. A revision announced in early September moved the opening week back to the last week in September. The regular season was to be unbalanced, with each team playing two of the others three times and the third one only twice. The 2012 championship game had originally been rescheduled to be played on December 1; during one week in late October the games were to have been played on Tuesday and Thursday nights.\n\n==The 2009 soft launch and the league's financial structure==\nThe UFL's original pay structure plan included a player [[salary cap]] range of $12\u201320 million per team with a staff salary cap of $3 million per team.   The UFL hoped to be paying at least 10 players on each roster in excess of $1 million each per season.  These players would provide name value and legitimacy for the league and would fast track the development of local fanbases and a national TV audience.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1669649,00.html |title=Battling the NFL: Two Hail-Mary passes |first=Sean |last=Gregory |date=2007-10-09 |work=Business & Tech |publisher=[[TIME Magazine]] |accessdate=2009-02-16 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514065258/http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1669649,00.html |archivedate=2009-05-14 }}</ref>\n\nThe original plan was predicated on luring in very wealthy owners like billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban.  The UFL however ultimately proved unsuccessful in securing commitments from enough of the deep-pocketed owners their original plan required.\n\nBy time the initial season began, the league had totally dumped its original salary structure to suit the reality of the soft launch.  The league's original plan would have had the average UFL salary in the $240,000-$500,000 range, far in excess of the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]]'s average salary.  The short schedule gutted the league's ability to generate TV or gate revenue.  To make a soft launch financially tolerable, player salaries had to be dramatically scaled back&mdash;pro-rated to reflect the shortened season.\n\nAn agent representing two players with NFL experience, Jack Bechta, reported his clients were offered UFL contracts at a base salary of $35,000. He confirmed with other agents that $35,000 was the league mandated salary for skill players and $25,000 for punters, place kickers and long snappers, at least for the 2009 inaugural season. One of the players represented by the agent was a quarterback who received an offer of $35,000, although he stated that his negotiations revealed that teams are allowed to pay one quarterback more than the $35,000 salary. Bonuses were limited to $10,000 per player.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalfootballpost.com/Will-they-play-for-35k.html|title=Will they play for 35k?|work=National Football Post|first=Jack|last=Betcha|date=2009-07-15|accessdate=2009-11-27|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216062618/http://www.nationalfootballpost.com/Will-they-play-for-35k.html|archivedate=2009-12-16}}</ref> In addition to the base salary, the league also paid for all housing expenses for its players.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://profootballweekly.com/blogs/2009/11/11/sit-down-with-ufl-gm-rick-mueller|title=Sit-down with UFL GM Rick Mueller|work=[[Pro Football Weekly]]|first=Dan|last=Winters|date=2009-11-11|accessdate=2009-11-12|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091117175622/http://www.profootballweekly.com/blogs/2009/11/11/sit-down-with-ufl-gm-rick-mueller|archivedate=2009-11-17}}</ref>\n\nThe league's initial salaries were roughly equal to the average per-game salaries in the Canadian Football League and, adjusted for inflation, equivalent to the old [[XFL (2001)|XFL]].

The soft launch called for opening the league with fewer teams than planned and playing an abbreviated schedule. They hoped a functioning league would yield the UFL a superior position for attracting potential owners over competing leagues still under development (like the New USFL, which at the time was trumpeting a spring 2010 launch).\n\nThe markets chosen for the [[2009 UFL season|premiere season]] were New York City ([[Hartford Colonials|Sentinels]]), Las Vegas ([[Las Vegas Locomotives|Locomotives]]), Orlando ([[Florida Tuskers]]), and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] ([[Sacramento Mountain Lions|California Redwoods]]).  The league's short schedule made the kind of expensive promotional efforts often employed with a new league cost prohibitive. Additionally, the league had a full schedule of three home games in the same stadium in only one of their selected cities, Las Vegas.\n\nDuring the week of August 10, 2009, the four team names and their uniform jerseys were revealed. Each of the uniforms (and the team logos and helmets that were unveiled on October 2)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/United-Football-League-prnews-3774862174.html?x=0&.v=1|title=United Football League Reveals Team Logos for 'Premiere' Season|work=[[Yahoo!

Each of the team jerseys had the same design template, complete with a horizontal arc across the top front that resembles the arc on the UFL's logo.\n\nOne of the Redwoods' games was moved to San Jose; the other two were played in San Francisco (the move to San Jose was a short-notice move due to poor attendance in San Francisco; however, the San Jose game ended up being even more poorly attended). The league was unable to secure a fiscally reasonable deal for a stadium within New York City, forcing the league to have the Sentinels play one home game each in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]; on the campus of [[Hofstra University]] in [[Long Island]], and in [[New Jersey]]. In addition, one of the Tuskers' games was played at [[Tropicana Field]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], in part because the Tuskers shared ownership that year with the [[Tampa Bay Rays]]; this was not reprised in 2010.\n\nThe Florida Tuskers finished 2009 with a 6&ndash;0 record. The Las Vegas Locomotives were next at 4&ndash;2, the California Redwoods were 2&ndash;4, and the Sentinels were last at 0&ndash;6.

This \"[[Tuck rule (football)|tuck rule]]\" had become one of the most controversial rules in the NFL;<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/14/AR2005101401828.html |title=tuck Rule Hard to Grasp |accessdate=2007-08-06 |work=The Washington Post |first=Mark |last=Maske |date=2005-10-15 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914201115/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/14/AR2005101401828.html |archivedate=2010-09-14 }}</ref> in the UFL, however, an identical play was called a fumble. The tuck rule was eliminated by the NFL prior to the 2013 season.\n*'''[[Blitz (American football)|Blitzing]]/Rushing''' &ndash; On each play, the defense must use four [[Lineman (American football)|down linemen]] who must be in a [[three point stance|3-]] or 4-point stance at the snap. No more than six defenders could rush the passer. Penalty for violating this rule was ''illegal defense'' (signaled as unsportsmanlike conduct), with a 15-yard penalty and a first down. This rule was meant to both protect the quarterback and encourage more scoring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omaha.com/article/20100930/SPORTS/709309722/-1#a-break-for-qbs-blitz-restrictions-favor-ufl-offenses|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616042037/http://www.omaha.com/article/20100930/SPORTS/709309722/-1#a-break-for-qbs-blitz-restrictions-favor-ufl-offenses|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-06-16|title=A break for QBs: Blitz restrictions favor UFL offenses|work=[[Omaha World-Herald]]|first=Steven|last=Pivovar|date=2010-09-30|accessdate=2010-10-09}}</ref> A similar rule has been in effect for the NFL's [[Pro Bowl]] for several years.\n*'''Intentional grounding''' &ndash; A quarterback was allowed to intentionally ground the ball to avoid a sack, provided he gets the throw back to the line of scrimmage. He does not have to be outside the pocket to do so.\n*'''Fumbling out of the end zones''' &ndash; If the ball is fumbled forward into and out of the [[end zone]], it is placed back at the spot of the fumble, whereas in the NFL this play is ruled a [[touchback]] and possession goes over to the defending team.\n*'''Instant replay''' &ndash; As opposed to the NFL, where the [[Official (American football)#Referee|referee]] reviews disputed plays (other than turnovers, scoring plays, and plays inside the [[two-minute warning]]) through a video monitor on the sidelines, all UFL replay reviews were viewed upstairs by a replay official, who had 90 seconds to make a ruling.\n*'''[[Touchdown celebration]]s''' &ndash; Player celebrations (individual or group) were permitted only in the end zones or the bench areas.\n*'''[[Face mask (gridiron football)|Face masks]]''' &ndash; The UFL allowed the single-bar face mask, which the NFL had outlawed in 2007. Only one player, punter [[Scott Player]], used the single-bar mask.\n*'''Overtime''' &ndash; Starting in 2010 (for the playoffs) and 2012 (for all other games), the NFL has adopted a modified [[Sudden death (sport)|sudden death]] overtime, where sudden death occurs only if the opening drive of overtime ends in a touchdown (before, any score would immediately end the extra session). The UFL has from its inception employed an overtime system that assures each team at least one possession. Therefore, if the first team scored on their opening drive (even if it is a touchdown), their opponent was then given the opportunity to equal that score on the next drive, or surpass it if the other team's first drive resulted in anything less than a touchdown and [[two-point conversion|2-point conversion]]. If both teams remain tied after each has had one possession, overtime then reverted to sudden death. If the score remains tied after 15 minutes, the game ends in a tie, except that post-season games will be played to a victorious conclusion. The actual application of the OT rules occurred during [[2009 UFL Championship Game|the first UFL championship game in 2009]] when Las Vegas won on a field goal after the first possession by Florida ended in an interception.\n\n===Other differences from NFL===\n*'''[[Official (American football)|Officials]]''' &ndash; The UFL's roster of on-field officials included two women, head linesman Terri Valenti (who joined the league in 2009) and line judge [[Sarah Thomas (American football official)|Sarah Thomas]] (2010).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=4060016|title=United Football League Announces Officials And Explains Rules Differences For 2010 Season|work=United Football League|publisher=OurSportsCentral.com|date=2010-07-29|accessdate=2010-07-29|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174250/http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=4060016|archivedate=2011-06-29}}</ref> The officials wore unique attire during the 2009 inaugural season\u2014red polo shirts with black numbering, lettering, and piping, along with black pants and caps that were the same as in the NFL (white cap for the [[Official (American football)#Referee|referee]], black for the other officials); the combination set them apart from not only their NFL and college brethren but from the teams on the field, none of whom sported red jerseys in 2009. The officials changed to traditional black-and-white-striped uniforms with green accents starting in 2010.\n*'''[[Chain crew]] and markers''' &ndash; Instead of bright orange, the chain crews' equipment (including vests, yardage \"sticks\", down markers, and endzone pylons) were lime green, one of the UFL's signature colors.\n\n==The William Hambrecht Trophy==\nThe trophy given annually to the UFL champions was The [[William Hambrecht]] Trophy, named after the Las Vegas Locos owner and UFL founder. When the trophy was first awarded in 2009, the Hambrecht Trophy displayed similar qualities to the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]]. It featured the star from the UFL logo with a streak coming off of one of the corners down onto the base. This design was scrapped after year one. For the 2010 season, the Hambrecht Trophy was redesigned. It now featured two bases in the shape of the UFL logo connected by four columns with a UFL football on a kicking tee placed on the top base. The previous design was then used as the Championship Game MVP trophy.\n\n==Game scheduling==\nFor the 2009 and 2010 seasons, the UFL scheduled its games on non-traditional evenings for pro football: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings. Though these games conflicted with high school and college football events in some locations, the UFL's scheduling plan was different from that of the National Football League, which is prohibited under federal anti-trust exemption law ([[Title 15 of the United States Code|15 U.S.C.]] \u00a7 1291, i.e., the [[Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961]]) from broadcasting any professional game within seventy-five miles of any inter-collegiate or high school game on any Friday or Saturday, beginning with the second Friday in September and ending the second Saturday in December (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/daily-brief/2007/05/31/first-and-very-long-for-bill-hambrecht |title=First and very long for Bill Hambrecht |first=Megan |last=Barnett |date=2007-05-31 |work=News Blog |publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast Portfolio Magazine |accessdate=2009-02-16 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126005856/http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/daily-brief/2007/05/31/first-and-very-long-for-bill-hambrecht |archivedate=2009-01-26 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the league originally intended to play its games primarily on the traditional Sunday afternoon time setting for professional football, but starting its season in August, a full month before the start of the NFL regular season. However, financial difficulties forced the league to return to its schedule from previous years.\n\nIn 2012 it was announced that games would begin in September and that the schedule would be played over eight weeks. When this announcement was made, it had been anticipated that the league would have expanded beyond four active members. Games were to be played on Wednesday and Friday nights with six weeks of regular season action and two weeks of playoffs, culminating with a championship game in early November. The eventual schedule announced in August 2012 varied somewhat from this, with the regular season extended to eight weeks but only one playoff game. A revision announced in early September moved the opening week back to the last week in September. The regular season was to be unbalanced, with each team playing two of the others three times and the third one only twice. The 2012 championship game had originally been rescheduled to be played on December 1; during one week in late October the games were to have been played on Tuesday and Thursday nights.\n\n==The 2009 soft launch and the league's financial structure==\nThe UFL's original pay structure plan included a player [[salary cap]] range of $12\u201320 million per team with a staff salary cap of $3 million per team.   The UFL hoped to be paying at least 10 players on each roster in excess of $1 million each per season.  These players would provide name value and legitimacy for the league and would fast track the development of local fanbases and a national TV audience.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1669649,00.html |title=Battling the NFL: Two Hail-Mary passes |first=Sean |last=Gregory |date=2007-10-09 |work=Business & Tech |publisher=[[TIME Magazine]] |accessdate=2009-02-16 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514065258/http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1669649,00.html |archivedate=2009-05-14 }}</ref>\n\nThe original plan was predicated on luring in very wealthy owners like billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban.  The UFL however ultimately proved unsuccessful in securing commitments from enough of the deep-pocketed owners their original plan required.\n\nBy time the initial season began, the league had totally dumped its original salary structure to suit the reality of the soft launch.  The league's original plan would have had the average UFL salary in the $240,000-$500,000 range, far in excess of the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]]'s average salary.  The short schedule gutted the league's ability to generate TV or gate revenue.  To make a soft launch financially tolerable, player salaries had to be dramatically scaled back&mdash;pro-rated to reflect the shortened season.\n\nAn agent representing two players with NFL experience, Jack Bechta, reported his clients were offered UFL contracts at a base salary of $35,000. He confirmed with other agents that $35,000 was the league mandated salary for skill players and $25,000 for punters, place kickers and long snappers, at least for the 2009 inaugural season. One of the players represented by the agent was a quarterback who received an offer of $35,000, although he stated that his negotiations revealed that teams are allowed to pay one quarterback more than the $35,000 salary. Bonuses were limited to $10,000 per player.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalfootballpost.com/Will-they-play-for-35k.html|title=Will they play for 35k?|work=National Football Post|first=Jack|last=Betcha|date=2009-07-15|accessdate=2009-11-27|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216062618/http://www.nationalfootballpost.com/Will-they-play-for-35k.html|archivedate=2009-12-16}}</ref> In addition to the base salary, the league also paid for all housing expenses for its players.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://profootballweekly.com/blogs/2009/11/11/sit-down-with-ufl-gm-rick-mueller|title=Sit-down with UFL GM Rick Mueller|work=[[Pro Football Weekly]]|first=Dan|last=Winters|date=2009-11-11|accessdate=2009-11-12|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091117175622/http://www.profootballweekly.com/blogs/2009/11/11/sit-down-with-ufl-gm-rick-mueller|archivedate=2009-11-17}}</ref>\n\nThe league's initial salaries were roughly equal to the average per-game salaries in the Canadian Football League and, adjusted for inflation, equivalent to the old [[XFL (2001)|XFL]].

At first they stood behind the goal line, when the referee decided to take the teams off the field into the dressing rooms and teams began to leave, one of Zenit fans punched Dynamo player [[Vladimir Granat]]. It was originally reported that Zenit player [[Jos\u00e9 Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n]] was also attacked. Later it has been clarified that Rond\u00f3n had a conflict with Dynamo player [[Marko Lomi\u0107]], but that incident was not registered by the referee or the game inspector.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Sport Express]]|url=http://news.sport-express.ru/2014-05-11/696981/|script-title=ru:\u0413\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0438 \u0420\u043e\u043d\u0434\u043e\u043d \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0432 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0447\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443 \"\u0417\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043c\" \u0438 \"\u0414\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043c\u043e\"|date=11 May 2014|language=Russian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|url=http://www.rsport.ru/football/20140511/745323004.html|script-title=ru:\u041a\u043e\u043d\u0444\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0442 \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443 \u0420\u043e\u043d\u0434\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u041b\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043c \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d \u0432 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0447\u0430 - \u0427\u0435\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0432|date=11 May 2014|language=Russian}}</ref> The game was abandoned.

Charcot simultaneously enters it from the other. They do not know each other, but agree to share the taxi. They are both on their way to the famous Jeunesse Dor\u00e9e restaurant and enjoy each other's company so much that they agree to dine together. The restaurant is full of private rooms, ideal for intimate suppers. Others who come to the restaurant, mostly in pursuit of amatory enterprise, are the Baron's son Hubert; the Baron's daughter, Jacqueline; R\u00e9n\u00e9, her fianc\u00e9 and cousin; Suzanne Pomarel, wife of a provincial merchant, whom the Baron has awarded a prize for virtue; Mme Charcot's husband; and finally M. Pomarel.\n\nMme Pomarel is an old flame of R\u00e9n\u00e9 and has agreed to have supper with him, but Hubert, who is much smitten by her, has persuaded R\u00e9n\u00e9 to let him take his place. The Baron, dining with Mme Charcot, has to hide under his table to avoid his wife. Pomarel arrives, quite tipsy, and greets Hubert. He does not suspect that the lady who has concealed herself behind a curtain, and whose outstretched hand he kisses with bibulous gallantry, is his own wife.  Hubert does not have sufficient funds to pay the bill.  In the ensuing flurry, the Baron discovers to his delight that his son is as immoral as he. Everyone narrowly avoids detection by his or her proper partner.\n\nUnfortunately for the errant men and women, the head waiter of the restaurant has been engaged as butler by Baroness Dauvray. All the main characters are present at breakfast at the Baron's house the next morning. They are horrified that the new butler knows everything about their escapades of the previous evening. In order to avoid being recognised by him, the Baron, Hubert and R\u00e9n\u00e9 all try to get under the table at the same time. In the end they manage to convince Pomarel that all the confusion was his fault for coming to the restaurant drunk. He apologises, and everyone is safe.\n\n==Roles and original cast==\n[[File:GirlintheTaxi-Hubert-Suzanne.jpg|thumb|right|Hubert and Suzanne react to Pomarel's unexpected arrival]]\n*Baron Dauvray  \u2013 [[Arthur Playfair]]\n*Baroness Delphine Dauvray  \u2013 [[Amy Augarde]]\n*Jacqueline  \u2013 Margaret Paton\n*Hubert  \u2013 Robert Averell \n*R\u00e9n\u00e9  \u2013 Alec Fraser\n*M.

The company considered moving its headquarters out of New Brunswick in the 1960s, but decided to stay in the town after city officials promised to revitalize downtown New Brunswick by demolishing old buildings and constructing new ones. While New Brunswick lost many historic structures, including the early home of Rutgers University, and most of its historic commercial waterfront to the redevelopment effort, the gentrification did attract people back to New Brunswick. Johnson & Johnson hired [[Henry N. Cobb]] from [[Pei Cobb Freed & Partners]] to design its new headquarters.

Invega Sustenna and Risperdal Consta were the first widely utilized long-acting depot injections for the treatment of schizophrenia. Designed to address the issue of poor patient compliance with oral therapy, they are administered by intramuscular injection at intervals of 2 weeks and one month, respectively.

Johnson & Johnson won the court case, and in 2009 Abbott was ordered to pay Johnson & Johnson $1.17&nbsp;billion in lost revenues and $504&nbsp;million in royalties.<ref name=Bloomberg2009>[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aF0Qoxe0JCiw Abbott Told to Pay Record $1.67&nbsp;billion Award to J&J], ''Bloomberg News'', June 29, 2009</ref> The judge also added $175.6&nbsp;million in interest to bring the total to $1.84&nbsp;billion.<ref name= bloomberg2010>[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-02/abbott-challenges-1-67-billion-patent-loss-to-j-j-over-arthritis-therapy.html Abbott Challenges $1.67&nbsp;billion Patent Loss to J&J Over Humira], ''Bloomberg News'', November 2, 2010</ref> This was the largest patent-infringement award in U.S. history<ref name=Bloomberg2009/> until the 2013 decision against Teva in favor of [[Takeda]] and [[Pfizer]] for over 2.1 billion dollars.<ref name= WSJ2013>[https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324188604578541080995659790 Pfizer, Takeda to Get $2.15 Billion Settlement], ''WSJ'', 6 12 2013</ref> In 2010 Abbott appealed the verdict<ref name= bloomberg2010/> and in 2011 won the appeal.<ref name=BusinessWeek2011>{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-02-23/abbott-wins-reversal-of-j-j-s-1-67-billion-patent-victory.html|title=abbott-wins-reversal-of-j-j-s-1-67-billion-patent-victory|work=Bloomberg.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506001424/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-02-23/abbott-wins-reversal-of-j-j-s-1-67-billion-patent-victory.html|archivedate=May 6, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Vaginal mesh implants ===\nTens of thousands of women worldwide have taken legal action against Johnson & Johnson after suffering serious complications following a vaginal mesh implant procedure.<ref name=\"cbsnews.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/states-file-lawsuit-against-johnson-johnson-over-pelvic-mesh-implants/|title=States file lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson over pelvic mesh implants|website=www.cbsnews.com}}</ref> In 2016 the U.S. states of [[California]] and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] filed a lawsuit against the company, accusing it of deception.<ref name=\"cbsnews.com\"/> More than 700 women began a [[class action]] against the company in the [[Federal Court of Australia]] in 2017, telling the court they \"suffered irreparable, debilitating pain after the devices began to erode into surrounding tissue and organs, causing infections and complications\".

The verdict included $70 million in compensatory damages and $347 million in punitive damages.

The appeals court ruled 3-0 that Jacqueline Fox's lawsuit lacked jurisdiction in Missouri because of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that imposed limits on where injury lawsuit can be filed which \". . . establishing a lawsuit's jurisdiction requires a stronger connection between the forum state and a plaintiff's claims.\"  Subsequently, this ruling would kill three other recent St. Louis jury verdicts of more than $200 million combined. Fox, 62, of [[Birmingham, Ala.]], died in 2015, about four months before her trial was held in [[St. Louis]] Circuit Court. She was among 65 plaintiffs, of whom only two were from Missouri.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/missouri-appeals-court-tosses-out-million-dollar-johnson-johnson-talcum/article_e976d9eb-c9dc-5fdf-b136-8d94bc6cfbdd.html|title=Missouri appeals court tosses out $72 million Johnson & Johnson talcum powder verdict|first=Joel|last=Currier}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2018, a St. Louis jury awarded nearly US$4.7 billion in damages to 22 women and their families after they claimed asbestos in Johnson & Johnson talcum powder caused their ovarian cancer.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Bever |first1=Lindsey |title=Johnson & Johnson ordered to pay $4.7 billion to women who say baby powder gave them cancer |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/07/13/johnson-johnson-ordered-to-pay-4-7-billion-to-women-who-say-baby-powder-gave-them-cancer/ |website=[[Washington Post]] |access-date=28 July 2018 |language=en |date=13 July 2018}}</ref>  Conversely, in December 2019, a St. Louis jury ruled in favor of Johnson & Johnson in the case of a single plaintiff who had used the company's talc-containing baby powder for thirty years with a similar claim.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/st-louis-jury-sides-with-johnson-johnson-in-talc-case/|title=St. Louis jury sides with Johnson & Johnson in talc case|last=Salter|first=Jim|date=23 December 2019|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=24 Dec 2019|url-status=live|agency=Associated Press}}</ref>  In 2019, the company's CEO, Alex Gorsky, declined to appear at a United States congressional hearing on the safety of the Johnson's and Johnson's Baby Powder and other talc-based cosmetics. J&J spokesman Ernie Knewitz said that the subcommittee had rejected the company's offers to send a talc testing expert or a J&J executive in charge of consumer products.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/johnson-johnson-ceo-refuses-attend-hearing-carcinogens-191210004346338.html|title=Johnson & Johnson CEO refuses to attend US hearing on carcinogens|last=|first=|date=2019-12-10|website=www.aljazeera.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2018, Johnson & Johnson said that it removed several chemicals from baby powder products and re-engineered them to make consumers more confident that products were safer for children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livemint.com/Companies/f2z1TqJx9HtNRwmAEiIXXK/Johnson-and-Johnsonremoveschemicals-to-make-products-safer.html|title=Johnson and Johnson removes chemicals to make products safer|access-date=25 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2018, with 11,700 people suing Johnson & Johnson over cancers allegedly caused by baby powder, the company was forced to release internal documents. The documents showed that the company had known about asbestos contamination since at least as early as 1971 and had spent decades finding ways to conceal the evidence from the public.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/johnson-johnson-knew-decades-asbestos-lurked-its-baby-powder-n948016|title=Johnson & Johnson knew for decades that asbestos lurked in some of its baby powder|website=NBC News}}</ref> On December 19, the company lost its request to reverse a jury verdict that ruled in favor of the accusers, which required the company to pay $4.14 billion in punitive damages and $550 million in compensatory damages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/jj-loses-its-battle-to-overturn-a-4-7b-baby-power-verdict|title=J&J loses its battle to overturn a $4.7B baby powder verdict|last=Scipioni|first=Jade|date=2018-12-19|website=FOXBusiness|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-19}}</ref> Though [[asbestos]] is a known [[carcinogen]], the potential link between asbestos-free talc and cancer also alleged in these lawsuits is a subject of scientific controversy, as discussed on the Neurologica blog by [[Steven Novella]]. A large study performed in 2003 found that ovarian cancer risk increased from a baseline of 0.0121% to 0.0161% in people who reported regularly using talc in the genital area. Two more studies over the next twelve years, which also relied on [[self-report]]ing, had similar results. However, none of the three studies showed a relationship between how long someone used talc and how much their cancer risk increased, which is expected in experiments with carcinogens and other toxic substances (see [[dose-response relationship]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/the-johnson-and-johnson-talc-cancer-case/|title=The Johnson and Johnson Talc Cancer Case|author=Steven Novella|website=Neurologica blog|access-date=2019-09-30|author-link=Steven Novella}}</ref>\n\n=== Opioid epidemic ===\n{{Further|Opioid epidemic in the United States}}\nBy 2018, the company had become embroiled in the [[opioid epidemic in the United States]] and had become a target of [[lawsuit]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dddmag.com/news/2018/03/doj-support-lawsuits-against-companies-selling-opioids|title=DOJ to Support Lawsuits Against Companies Selling Opioids|last=Gurman|first=Sadie|date=March 2, 2018|work=Drug Discovery & Development|access-date=2 March 2018|publisher=Advantage Business Media|agency=Associated Press|last2=Mulvihill|first2=Geoff}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/12/health/oklahoma-opioid-trial-johnson-and-johnson-kingpin/index.html|title=Johnson & Johnson acted as opioid kingpin, Oklahoma attorney general says|date=March 12, 2019|access-date=14 March 2019|publisher=CNN}}</ref> Over 500 opioid-related cases have been filed as of May 2018 against Johnson & Johnson and its competitors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://seekingalpha.com/article/4200206-trump-insurance-johnson-and-johnson|title=Trump Insurance For Johnson & Johnson|access-date=25 August 2018}}</ref> In Idaho, Johnson & Johnson is part of a lawsuit accusing the company for being partially to blame for opioid-related overdose deaths.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.idahostatesman.com/living/health-fitness/article216893150.html|title=11 Idaho counties take on Walmart, CVS, drug companies in opioid lawsuit|access-date=25 August 2018}}</ref> The first major trial began in Oklahoma in May 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/first-big-trial-in-opioid-crisis-set-to-kick-off-in-oklahoma-11558958401|title=First Big Trial in Opioid Crisis Set to Kick Off in Oklahoma|last=Randazzo|first=Sara|date=2019-05-27|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2019-05-28|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}</ref> On August 26, 2019, the Oklahoma judge ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $572 million for their part in the opioid crisis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/26/health/oklahoma-opioid-trial-verdict-bn/index.html|title=Oklahoma wins case against drugmaker in historic opioid trial|work=[[CNN]] | first1=Jacqueline | last1=Howard | first2=Wayne | last2=Drash | date=August 26, 2019 | access-date=August 26, 2019}}</ref> In October 2019, Johnson & Johnson reached a $20.4 million settlement with two Ohio counties grappling with the opioid epidemic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/articles/2019-10-02/johnson-and-johnson-agrees-to-pay-ohio-counties-204m-opioid-settlement|title=Johnson & Johnson to Pay Ohio Counties $20.4M Opioid Settlement|last=|first=|date=|website=www.usnews.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\n====Northeastern Ohio Settlement====\n\nIn October 2019, the company agreed to a settlement of US$20.4 million with two Ohio counties \u2013 Cuyahoga (Cleveland) and Summit (Akron).

If correct, this would explain many of Europa's features. Europa's immense network of crisscrossing cracks serves as a record of the stresses caused by massive tides in its global ocean. Europa's tilt could influence calculations of how much of its history is recorded in its frozen shell, how much heat is generated by tides in its ocean, and even how long the ocean has been liquid. Its ice layer must stretch to accommodate these changes. When there is too much stress, it cracks. A tilt in Europa's axis could suggest that its cracks may be much more recent than previously thought. The reason for this is that the direction of the spin pole may change by as much as a few degrees per day, completing one precession period over several months. A tilt could also affect the estimates of the age of Europa's ocean. Tidal forces are thought to generate the heat that keeps Europa's ocean liquid, and a tilt in the spin axis would cause more heat to be generated by tidal forces. Such additional heat would have allowed the ocean to remain liquid for a longer time. However, it has not yet been determined when this hypothesized shift in the spin axis might have occurred.<ref>Cook, Jia-Rui C.

This generates so-called [[Rossby wave]]s that travel quite slowly, at just a few kilometers per day, but can generate significant kinetic energy. For the current axial tilt estimate of 0.1 degree<!-- and assuming a linear dependency -->, the resonance from Rossby waves would contain 7.3{{E|18}} J of kinetic energy, which is two thousand times

If correct, this would explain many of Europa's features. Europa's immense network of crisscrossing cracks serves as a record of the stresses caused by massive tides in its global ocean. Europa's tilt could influence calculations of how much of its history is recorded in its frozen shell, how much heat is generated by tides in its ocean, and even how long the ocean has been liquid. Its ice layer must stretch to accommodate these changes. When there is too much stress, it cracks. A tilt in Europa's axis could suggest that its cracks may be much more recent than previously thought. The reason for this is that the direction of the spin pole may change by as much as a few degrees per day, completing one precession period over several months. A tilt could also affect the estimates of the age of Europa's ocean. Tidal forces are thought to generate the heat that keeps Europa's ocean liquid, and a tilt in the spin axis would cause more heat to be generated by tidal forces. Such additional heat would have allowed the ocean to remain liquid for a longer time. However, it has not yet been determined when this hypothesized shift in the spin axis might have occurred.<ref>Cook, Jia-Rui C.

This could be explained if Europa's surface rotates slightly faster than its interior, an effect that is possible due to the subsurface ocean mechanically decoupling Europa's surface from its rocky mantle and the effects of Jupiter's gravity tugging on Europa's outer ice crust.<ref name=\"Hurford2006\">{{cite journal |last1=Hurford |first1=T.A. |last2=Sarid |first2=A.R. |last3=Greenberg |first3=R. |title=Cycloidal cracks on Europa: Improved modeling and non-synchronous rotation implications |journal=Icarus |date=January 2007 |volume=186 |issue=1 |pages=218\u2013233 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2006.08.026 |bibcode=2007Icar..186..218H }}</ref> Comparisons of ''[[Voyager program|Voyager]]'' and ''Galileo'' spacecraft photos serve to put an upper limit on this hypothetical slippage.

Lenovo is the [[market share of personal computer vendors|world's largest personal computer vendor]] by unit sales, as of March 2019. It markets the [[ThinkPad]] and [[ThinkBook]] business lines of notebook computers; [[IdeaPad]], [[Lenovo Yoga|Yoga]], and Legion consumer lines of notebook laptops; and the [[IdeaCentre]] and [[ThinkCentre]] lines of desktops.\n\nLenovo has operations in more than 60 countries and sells its products in around 160 countries. Lenovo's principal facilities are in Beijing and [[Morrisville, North Carolina|Morrisville]] ([[North Carolina]], U.S.), with research centers in Beijing, [[Shanghai]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Xiamen]], [[Chengdu]], [[Nanjing]], [[Wuhan]], [[Yamato, Kanagawa|Yamato]] ([[Kanagawa Prefecture]], Japan), and Morrisville. It also has a joint venture with [[NEC]], Lenovo NEC Holdings, which produces personal computers for the Japanese market.\n\nLenovo was founded in Beijing in November 1984 as '''Legend''' and was incorporated in [[Hong Kong]] in 1988. Lenovo acquired [[IBM]]'s personal computer business in 2005 and agreed to acquire its Intel-based server business in 2014. Lenovo entered the smartphone market in 2012 and as of 2014 was the largest vendor of smartphones in Mainland China. In 2014, Lenovo acquired the mobile phone handset maker [[Motorola Mobility]] from [[Google]]. In 2017, Lenovo acquired [[Fujitsu]]'s personal computer business.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/11995/lenovo-to-acquire-controlling-stake-of-fujitsus-pc-business|title=Lenovo to Acquire Controlling Stake of Fujitsu's PC Business|first=Anton|last=Shilov|website=www.anandtech.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fujitsu-strategy-idUSKBN18X13P|title=Fujitsu to reach agreement \"soon\" on integrating PC business with Lenovo|date=6 June 2017|via=www.reuters.com}}</ref>\n\nLenovo is listed on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]] and is a constituent of the [[Hang Seng China-Affiliated Corporations Index]], often referred to as \"[[Red Chip]]s\".\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Early Years===\n[[Liu Chuanzhi]] along with a group of ten [[engineer]]s (all in their middle age) founded Lenovo on 1 November 1984 in Beijing with 200,000 yuan. The Chinese government approved Lenovo's incorporation on the same day. Ji\u01ce X\u00f9f\u00fa (\u8d3e\u7eed\u798f), one of the founders of Lenovo, indicates the first meeting in preparation for starting the company was held on 17 October of the same year. Eleven people, the entirety of the initial staff, attended. Each of the founders was a member of the Institute of Computing Technology attached to the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]]. The 200,000 yuan used as start-up capital was approved by Z\u0113ng M\u00e0och\u00e1o (\u66fe\u8302\u671d). The name for the company agreed upon at this meeting was the Chinese Academy of Sciences Computer Technology Research Institute New Technology Development Company.<ref name=book1/>\n\nTheir first significant effort, an attempt to import televisions, failed. The group rebuilt itself within a year by conducting quality checks on computers for new buyers. Lenovo soon started developing a circuit board that would allow IBM-compatible personal computers to process Chinese characters. This product was Lenovo's first major success. Lenovo also tried and failed to market a digital watch. Liu said, \"Our management team often differed on which commercial road to travel. This led to big discussions, especially between the engineering chief and myself. He felt that if the quality of the product was good, then it would sell itself. But I knew this was not true, that marketing and other factors were part of the eventual success of a product.\" The fact that its staff had little business experience compounded Lenovo's early difficulties. \"We were mainly scientists and didn't understand the market\", Liu said. \"We just learned by trial-and-error, which was very interesting\u2014but also very dangerous\", said Liu. In 1990, Lenovo started to manufacture and market computers using its own brand name.<ref name=\"chief\">{{cite news |title=China's High-Tech Hero |author=Dickie, Mure |newspaper=Chief Executive |date=1 January 2005}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1988, Lenovo placed its first recruitment advertisement. The ad was placed on the front page of the ''China Youth News''. Such ads were quite rare in China then. Out of the 500 respondents, 280 were selected to take a written employment exam. 120 of these candidates were interviewed in person. Although interviewers initially only had authority to hire 16 people, 58 were given offers. The new staff included 18 people with graduate degrees, 37 with undergraduate degrees, and three students with no university-level education. Their average age was 26. [[Yang Yuanqing]], the current CEO of Lenovo, was among that group.<ref name=book1/>\n\nLiu Chuanzhi received government permission to form a subsidiary in Hong Kong and to move there along with five other employees. Liu's father, already in Hong Kong, furthered his son's ambitions through mentoring and facilitating loans. Liu moved to Hong Kong in 1988. To save money during this period, Liu and his co-workers walked instead of taking public transportation. To keep up appearances, they rented hotel rooms for meetings.<ref name=book1/>\n\n===IPO, second offerings, and bond sales===\nLenovo became publicly traded after a 1994 Hong Kong listing that raised nearly US$30 million. Prior to its IPO, many analysts were optimistic about Lenovo. The company was praised for its good management, strong brand recognition, and growth potential. Analysts also worried about Lenovo's profitability. Lenovo's IPO was massively over-subscribed. On its first day of trading, the company's stock price hit a high of HK$2.07 and closed at HK$2.00. Proceeds from the offering were used to finance sales offices in Europe, North America and Australia, to expand and improve production and research and development, and to increase working capital.<ref name=book1/>\n\nWhen Lenovo was first listed, its managers thought the only purpose of going public was to raise capital. They had little understanding of the rules and responsibilities that went along with running a public company. Before Lenovo conducted its first secondary offering in 1997, Liu proudly announced the company's intent to mainland newspapers only to have its stock halted for two days by regulators to punish his statement. This occurred several times until Liu learned that he had to choose his words carefully in public. The first time Liu traveled to Europe on a \"roadshow\" to discuss his company's stock, he was shocked by the skeptical questions he was subjected to and felt offended. Liu later came to understand that he was accountable to shareholders. He said, \"Before I only had one boss, but CAS never asked me anything. I relied on my own initiative to do things. We began to think about issues of credibility. Legend began to learn how to become a truly international company.\"<ref name=book1/>\n\nTo fund its continued growth, Lenovo issued a secondary offering of 50 million shares on the Hong Kong market in March 2000 and raised about US$212 million.<ref name=book1/>\n\n[[Mary Ma]], Lenovo's chief financial officer from 1990 to 2007, was in charge of investor relations. Under her leadership, Lenovo successfully integrated Western-style accountability into its corporate culture. Lenovo's emphasis on transparency earned it a reputation for the best corporate governance among mainland Chinese firms. All major issues regarding its board, management, major share transfers, and mergers and acquisitions were fairly and accurately reported. While Hong Kong-listed firms were only required to issue financial reports twice per year, Lenovo followed the international norm of issuing quarterly reports. Lenovo created an audit committee and a compensation committee with non-management directors. The company started roadshows twice per year to meet institutional investors. Ma organized the first-ever investor relations conference held in Mainland China. The conference was held in Beijing in 2002 and televised on CCTV. Liu and Ma co-hosted the conference and both gave speeches on corporate governance.<ref name=book1/>\n\n[[File:Lenovo logo (English).svg|thumb|Former Lenovo logo, used from 2003 until 2015]]\nIn May 2015, Lenovo revealed a new logo at Lenovo Tech World in Beijing, with the slogan \"Innovation Never Stands Still\" ({{zh|c=\u521b\u65b0\u65e0\u6b62\u5883}}). Lenovo's new logo, created by Saatchi, New York, can be changed by its advertising agencies and sales partners, within restrictions, to fit the context. It has a lounging \"e\" and is surrounded by a box that can be changed to use a relevant scene, solid color, or photograph. Lenovo's Chief Marketing Officer David Roman said, \"When we first started looking at it, it wasn't about just a change in typography or the look of the logo. We asked 'If we really are a net-driven, customer-centric company, what should the logo look like?' We came up with the idea of a digital logo first \u2026 designed to be used on the internet and adaptable to context.\"<ref name=\"AALogo\">{{cite news |last=Snyder Bulik |first=Beth |date=28 May 2015 |title=Worldwide PC Leader Lenovo Rebrands For Post-PC World\n|url=http://adage.com/article/digital/lenovo-rebrands-logo-renewed-post-pc-push/298773/ |newspaper=Advertising Age |location=United States |access-date=8 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn early June 2015, Lenovo announced plans to sell up to US$650 million in five-year bonds denominated in Chinese yuan. The bonds will be sold in Hong Kong with coupon ranging from 4.95% to 5.05%. This is only the second sale of bonds in Lenovo's history.

It had a pastel-colored, shell-shaped case and a seven-port USB hub under its screen. As of 2000, the Tianxi was the best-selling computer in Chinese history. It sold more than 1,000,000 units in 2000 alone.<ref name=\"Tianxi\">{{cite news |last=Sima |first=Katherine |date=19 December 2005 |title=Lenovo's design strategy drives success |url=http://www.plasticsnews.com/article/20051219/NEWS/312199974/lenovo-s-design-strategy-drives-success |newspaper=Plastics News |location=United States |access-date=7 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Mergers, acquisitions, and partnerships===\nLenovo works to integrate the management of each newly acquired company into its larger culture.

So we started investing more ... and working very closely with key parts suppliers.\"<ref name=\"WS\"/> Previously, lack of integration due to numerous foreign acquisitions and an excessive number of \"key performance indicators\" (KPIs) was making Lenovo's expansion expensive and creating unacceptably slow delivery times to end-customers. Lenovo responded by reducing the number of KPIs from 150 to 5, offering intensive training to managers, and working to create a global Lenovo culture. Lenovo also doubled-down on vertical integration and manufacturing near target markets in order to cut costs at time when its competitors were making increased use of outsourcing off-shoring. By 2013, Lenovo ranked 20th on Gartner's list of top 50 supply chains, whereas in 2010 the company was unranked.<ref name=\"Big1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.strategy-business.com/article/00274?pg=2|title=Lenovo Goes Global|first=William J.|last=Holstein|date=8 August 2014|work=strategy+business}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, Lenovo partially moved production of its ThinkPad line of computers to Japan.

Some people have said we are a state-owned enterprise. It's 100% not true. In 1984 the Chinese Academy of Sciences only invested $25,000 in our company. The purpose of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to invest in this company was that they wanted to commercialize their research results. The Chinese Academy of Sciences is a pure research entity in China, owned by the government. From this point, you could say we're different from state-owned enterprises. Secondly, after this investment, this company is run totally by the founders and management team. The government has never been involved in our daily operation, in important decisions, strategic direction, nomination of the CEO and top executives and financial management. Everything is done by our management team.\"<ref name=\"state\">{{cite news |title=Q&A; Chinese Computer Giant Showcases Capitalist Credentials; Chairman of Lenovo, which acquired IBM's PC unit, says the firm has few government ties |author= |url= |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=4 May 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2006, the U.S. State Department was harshly criticized for purchasing 16,000 computers from Lenovo. Critics argued that Lenovo was controlled by the Chinese government and a potential vehicle for espionage against the United States. Yang spoke out forcefully and publicly to defend Lenovo. He said, \"We are not a government-controlled company.\" He pointed out that Lenovo pioneered China's transition to a market economy and that in the early 1990s had fought and beaten four state-owned enterprises that dominated the Chinese computer market. Those firms had the full backing of the state while Lenovo received no special treatment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2006-04-19/lenovos-foreign-affairs|title=Lenovo's Foreign Affairs|first=Steve|last=Hamm|date=20 April 2006|url-access=subscription }}</ref> The State Department deal went through. Yang worried that fears about Lenovo's supposed connections to the Chinese government would be an ongoing issue in the United States. Yang worked to ease worries by communicating directly with Congress.\n\nYang dramatically increased his ownership stake by acquiring 797 million shares in 2011. As of June 2011, Yang owned an 8 percent stake in Lenovo. He previously owned only 70 million shares. In a statement, Yang said, \"While the transaction is a personal financial matter, I want to be very clear that my decision to make this investment is based on my strong belief in the company's very bright future. Our culture is built on commitment and ownership&nbsp;\u2013 we do what we say, and we own what we do.

While Lenovo was founded using seed capital from the state-owned [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], Lenovo is run as a private enterprise with little or no interference by the state. Lenovo's senior executives, including many non-Chinese, rotate between two head offices, one in Beijing and the other in Morrisville, North Carolina, and Lenovo's research and development center in Japan. Two foreigners have previously served as Lenovo's CEO.<ref name=Econ1/>\n\nEnglish is Lenovo's official language. Lenovo's CEO, Yang Yuanqing, initially did not understand English well, but relocated his family to Morrisville to improve his language skills and learn American ways. One American Lenovo executive interviewed by ''The Economist'' praised Yang for his efforts to make Lenovo a friendly place for foreigners to work. He said that Yang had created a \"performance culture\" in place of the traditional Chinese work style of \"waiting to see what the emperor wants\".<ref name=Econ1/>\n\n===Leadership===\n\n====Yang Yuanqing====\n[[File:Yang Yuanqing.jpeg|thumb|Yang Yuanqing, Lenovo's Chairman and CEO]]\n{{Main|Yang Yuanqing}}\nYang Yuanqing is the chairman and chief executive officer of Lenovo.

Yang was chairman of Lenovo's board from 2004 to 2008, and returned as chairman in 2012 alongside his role as CEO.\n\nIn 2012, Yang received a $3 million bonus as a reward for record profits, which he in turn redistributed to about 10,000 of Lenovo's employees. According to Lenovo spokesman, Jeffrey Shafer, Yang felt that it would be the right thing to, \"redirect [the money] to the employees as a real tangible gesture for what they done.\" Shafer also said that Yang, who owns about eight percent of Lenovo's stock, \"felt that he was rewarded well simply as the owner of the company.\"<ref name=\"Bonus\">{{cite news |title=CEO of Lenovo Gives $3 Million in Bonuses to Employees |first=Lyneka |last=Little |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/business/2012/07/ceo-of-lenovo-gives-3-million-in-bonuses-to-employees/ |newspaper=ABC News |date=23 July 2012 |accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref> The bonuses were mostly distributed among staff working in positions such as production and reception who received an average of 2,000 yuan or about US$314.

Liu was trained as an engineer at a military college and later went on to work at the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]]. Like many young people during the Cultural Revolution, Liu was denounced and sent to the countryside where he worked as a laborer on a rice farm. Liu claims [[Hewlett-Packard]] as a key source of inspiration. In an interview with ''[[The Economist]]'' he stated that \"Our earliest and best teacher was Hewlett-Packard.\" For more than ten years, Lenovo was Hewlett-Packard's distributor in China.<ref name=\"Economist\">{{cite news |title=Face value: Legend in the making |author= |url=http://www.economist.com/node/780748 |newspaper=The Economist |date=15 September 2001 |accessdate=6 February 2013}}</ref> In reference to Lenovo's later acquisition of IBM's personal computer unit Liu said, \"I remember the first time I took part in a meeting of IBM agents. I was wearing an old business suit of my father's and I sat in the back row. Even in my dreams, I never imagined that one day we could buy the IBM PC business. It was unthinkable. Impossible.\"<ref name=\"chief\"/>\n\n====Board of directors====\nIn early 2013, Lenovo announced the addition of Yahoo founder [[Jerry Yang (entrepreneur)|Jerry Yang]] to its board. Lenovo's CEO Yang Yuanqing said, \"Jerry's appointment as an observer to our board furthers Lenovo's reputation as a transparent international company.\" Just prior to the appointment of Jerry Yang, Tudor Brown, the founder of British semiconductor design firm [[ARM Holdings|ARM]], was also appointed to Lenovo's board. Speaking of both men Yang Yuanqing said, \"We believe that they will add a great deal to our strategic thinking, long-term direction and, ultimately, our ability to achieve our aspirations in the PC plus era.\"\n\n==Marketing and sponsorships==\n\n===Emerging markets===\nIn 2009, Lenovo became the first personal computer manufacturer to divide countries into emerging markets and mature markets. Lenovo then developed a different set of strategies for each category. Lenovo's competitors have widely adopted the same approach<ref name=\"People\"/>\n\nIn 2012, Lenovo made a major effort to expand its market share in developing economies such as Brazil and India through acquisitions and increased budgets for marketing and advertising. While Lenovo has not revealed its total spending on marketing, it did increase marketing and advertising expenditures by $248 million in the fiscal year ending in 2012.<ref name=Econ1/>\n\n====China====\n[[File:A Lenovo Store in China.jpg|thumb|upright|A Lenovo Store in China]]\nIn China, Lenovo has a vast distribution network designed to make sure that there is at least one shop selling Lenovo computers within 50 kilometers of nearly all consumers. Lenovo has also developed close relationships with its Chinese distributors, who are granted exclusive territories and only carry Lenovo products.<ref name=Econ1/>\n\nAs of July 2013, Lenovo believes that urbanization initiatives being pushed by Premier [[Li Keqiang]] will allow it to sustain sales growth in China for the foreseeable future. Speaking at Lenovo's annual general meeting in Hong Kong in 2013, Yang Yuanqing said: \"I believe urbanisation will help us further increase the overall [domestic] PC market.\" Yang also stressed the opportunity presented by the China's relatively low penetration rate of personal computers. Lenovo previously benefited from the Chinese government's rural subsidies, part of a wider economic stimulus initiative, designed to increase purchases of appliances and electronics. That program, which Lenovo joined in 2004, ended in 2011. Lenovo enjoys consistent price premiums over its traditional competitors in rural markets and a stronger local sales and service presence.<ref name=\"FT2\">{{cite web |last=Hille |first=Kathrin |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/da66ab1e-e9fe-11e2-b2f4-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2Yk2jG67n |title=Lenovo optimistic about China's economy |publisher=FT.com |date=2013-07-11 |accessdate=2013-09-28}}</ref>\n\n====India====\nLenovo has gained significant market share in India through bulk orders to large companies and government agencies. For example, the government of [[Tamil Nadu]] ordered a million laptops from Lenovo in 2012 and single-handedly made the firm a market leader. Lenovo distributes most of the personal computers it sells in India through five national distributors such as [[Ingram Micro]] and Redington.<ref name=\"India6\"/>\n\nGiven that most smartphones and tablets are sold to individuals Lenovo is pursuing a different strategy making use of many small state-centric distributors. Amar Babu, Lenovo's managing director for India, said, \"To reach out to small towns and the hinterland, we have tied up with 40 regional distributors. We want our distributors to be exclusive to us.

In February 2013, Lenovo established a relationship with Reliance Communications to sell smartphones. The smartphones carried by Reliance have dual-SIM capability and support both GSM and CDMA. Babu claims that the relative under penetration of smartphones in India represents an opportunity for Lenovo.<ref name=\"India6\"/>\n\nLenovo has assembled a team of senior managers familiar with the Indian market, launched mobile phones at all price points there, and worked on branding to build market share. As of February 2014, Lenovo claims that its sales of smartphones in India have been increasing 100% per quarter while the market is only growing 15-20% over the same period. Lenovo did marketing tests of its smartphones in November 2012 in [[Gujarat]] and some southern cities, where Lenovo already had a strong presence. Lenovo's strategy has been to create awareness, maintain a broad selection of phones at all price points, and develop distribution networks. Lenovo partnered with two national distributors and over 100 local distributors. As of February 2014, more than 7,000 retail outlets in India sold Lenovo smartphones. Lenovo has also partnered with HCL in order to set up 250 service centres in 110 cities.<ref name=\"India1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/lenovo-creates-a-big-mobile-buzz/1228658?rheditorpick|title=Lenovo creates a big mobile buzz|first=Sudhir|last=Chowdhary|work=The Financial Express}}</ref>\n\nIn India, Lenovo grants distributors exclusive territories but allows them to sell computers from other companies. Lenovo uses its close relationships with distributors to gain [[market intelligence]] and speed up product development.\n\nLenovo reported a year-on-year increase of about 951% in tablet sales in India for the first quarter of 2014.

West Africa followed when Lenovo set-up a Nigerian legal office and then expanded to Ghana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Botswana.\n\nAccording to Lenovo's general manager for Africa, Graham Braum, Lenovo's strategy is to put \"great emphasis on products that sell well in Africa\" and roll out \"products alongside different African governments' rolling out of wireless technology\". Products such as the Lenovo Yoga series are popular in Africa because of their long battery life, as many areas have unreliable electrical supply. Other popular products include the Lenovo netbooks, which were introduced in 2008.<ref name=dexing>{{cite news |last=Dexing |first=Qin |date=2015-02-13 |title=Lenovo Expands to Africa |url=http://www.ecns.cn/business/2015/02-13/154889.shtml |newspaper=ECNS.com |access-date=2015-03-09}}</ref>\n\nLenovo picked Nigeria in 2013 to release its smartphone because unlike South Africa and other African countries, there is no requirement to partner with a local telecom firm to sell its phones.<ref name=\"Africa1\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-09/lenovo-will-debut-first-africa-smartphone-in-nigeria-by-year-end.html |work=Bloomberg |first=Chris |last=Spillane |title=Lenovo Plans to Debut Africa Smartphone in Nigeria This Year |date=10 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the long term, according to Braum, \"Lenovo in Africa will focus on continuing to consistently supply personal computer products and allow this market to grow, while moving into new territory such as mobile and enterprise.\"<ref name=dexing/>\n\n===United States===\nIn the United States, Lenovo began the \"For Those Who Do\" marketing campaign in 2010, created by the ad agency [[Saatchi & Saatchi]]. The campaign was Lenovo's first to go global, except for its domestic market in China, where it retained its existing \"Imagine\" ([[Pinyin]]: ''lian xiang'') slogan. The campaign did not reach China because \"do\" carries connotations of manual labor in the country, an image that Lenovo did not want attached to their brand.<ref name=fc>{{cite news |last=Salter|first=Chuck|title=Protect and Attack: Lenovo's New Strategy|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1793529/protect-and-attack-lenovos-new-strategy|accessdate=1 December 2013|newspaper=Fast Company|date=22 November 2011}}</ref> \"For Those Who Do\" was designed to appeal to young consumers in the 18- to 25-year-old demographic by stressing its utility to creative individuals that Lenovo's advertising refers to as \"doers\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Vega|first=Tanzina|title=Lenovo Aims a Campaign at the Apple Crowd|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/business/media/29adco.html?_r=0|accessdate=1 December 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=28 April 2011}}</ref> One of Lenovo's operational centers is located in North Carolina, United States.

David Roman, Lenovo's chief marketing officer, said, \"His partnership goes beyond traditional bounds by deeply integrating him into our organization as a product engineer. Ashton will help us break new ground by challenging assumptions, bringing a new perspective and contributing his technical expertise to Yoga Tablet and other devices.\" Kutcher co-founded [[A-Grade Investments]], an investor in [[Airbnb]], [[Foursquare City Guide|Foursquare]], [[Spotify]], [[Path (social network)|Path]], [[Uber]], and other technology firms.

Lenovo will receive advertising space in NFL venues and events and be allowed to use the NFL logo on its products and ads. Lenovo said that this sponsorship would boost its efforts to market to the key 18- to 35-year-old male demographic.\n\nThe NFL has been a Lenovo customer since 2007 and the sponsorship resulted from that relationship. NFL stars [[Jerry Rice]], [[DeAngelo Williams]], and [[Torry Holt]] were on hand for the announcement and a celebration with 1,500 Lenovo employees. Lenovo's sponsorship will last at least three years.<ref name=\"NFL\">{{cite news |title=Lenovo becomes an NFL sponsor |first=David |last=Ranii |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2012/07/25/2220073/lenovo-joins-team-nfl.html#storylink=misearch |newspaper=News Observer |date=25 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n===''The Pursuit''===\nLenovo used a short-film entitled ''The Pursuit'' in its \"For Those Who Do\" campaign launched in 2011. The film depicted a mysterious young woman using the IdeaPad Yoga 13 to stay one-step-ahead of her evil pursuers. [[Martin Campbell]], who previously worked on action movies and James Bond films such as GoldenEye and the remake of Casino Royale, shot this film. Lenovo was the first Chinese company to make use of such marketing techniques.<ref name=\"Big1\"/>\n\n===Tech World===\nIn May 2015, Lenovo hosted its first ever \"Tech World\" conference in Beijing. The CEOs of [[Intel]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Baidu]] delivered keynote addresses along with Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing. Lenovo also used Tech World to announce a refresh of its corporate logo and visual identity. The shift in Lenovo's visual presentation was accompanied by changes in Lenovo's business model.

Goodweird is designed to convey the idea that designs that seem strange initially often become familiar and widely accepted. The Goodweird campaign includes a video with famous images of early attempts to fly with the aid of homemade wings and a bicycle that transitions to a modern-day shot of a man soaring across mountains in a wingsuit before transitioning again to a shot of the [[Stealth Bomber]]. Lenovo worked with three agencies on Goodweird: London-based DLKW Low, We Are Social, and Blast Radius. Goodweird is part of Lenovo's wider strategy to appeal to millennials with an emphasis on design trendsetters. A portion of the funding for Goodweird is being directed to prominent [[YouTubers]] and Viners.

This process occurs even on clean installations of Windows. It was found that this program had been automatically installed using a new feature in [[Windows 8]], [[Features new to Windows 8#Windows Platform Binary Table|Windows Platform Binary Table]], which allows executable files to be stored within UEFI firmware for execution on startup, and is meant to \"allow critical software to persist even when the operating system has changed or been reinstalled in a 'clean' configuration\"; specifically, anti-theft security software.

The company designs, develops, manufactures, and sells [[personal computer]]s, [[tablet computer]]s, [[Lenovo smartphones|smartphones]], [[workstation]]s, [[server (computing)|servers]], [[electronic storage]] devices, IT management software, and [[smart TV|smart televisions]]. Lenovo is the [[market share of personal computer vendors|world's largest personal computer vendor]] by unit sales, as of March 2019. It markets the [[ThinkPad]] and [[ThinkBook]] business lines of notebook computers; [[IdeaPad]], [[Lenovo Yoga|Yoga]], and Legion consumer lines of notebook laptops; and the [[IdeaCentre]] and [[ThinkCentre]] lines of desktops.\n\nLenovo has operations in more than 60 countries and sells its products in around 160 countries. Lenovo's principal facilities are in Beijing and [[Morrisville, North Carolina|Morrisville]] ([[North Carolina]], U.S.), with research centers in Beijing, [[Shanghai]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Xiamen]], [[Chengdu]], [[Nanjing]], [[Wuhan]], [[Yamato, Kanagawa|Yamato]] ([[Kanagawa Prefecture]], Japan), and Morrisville. It also has a joint venture with [[NEC]], Lenovo NEC Holdings, which produces personal computers for the Japanese market.\n\nLenovo was founded in Beijing in November 1984 as '''Legend''' and was incorporated in [[Hong Kong]] in 1988. Lenovo acquired [[IBM]]'s personal computer business in 2005 and agreed to acquire its Intel-based server business in 2014. Lenovo entered the smartphone market in 2012 and as of 2014 was the largest vendor of smartphones in Mainland China. In 2014, Lenovo acquired the mobile phone handset maker [[Motorola Mobility]] from [[Google]]. In 2017, Lenovo acquired [[Fujitsu]]'s personal computer business.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/11995/lenovo-to-acquire-controlling-stake-of-fujitsus-pc-business|title=Lenovo to Acquire Controlling Stake of Fujitsu's PC Business|first=Anton|last=Shilov|website=www.anandtech.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fujitsu-strategy-idUSKBN18X13P|title=Fujitsu to reach agreement \"soon\" on integrating PC business with Lenovo|date=6 June 2017|via=www.reuters.com}}</ref>\n\nLenovo is listed on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]] and is a constituent of the [[Hang Seng China-Affiliated Corporations Index]], often referred to as \"[[Red Chip]]s\".\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Early Years===\n[[Liu Chuanzhi]] along with a group of ten [[engineer]]s (all in their middle age) founded Lenovo on 1 November 1984 in Beijing with 200,000 yuan. The Chinese government approved Lenovo's incorporation on the same day. Ji\u01ce X\u00f9f\u00fa (\u8d3e\u7eed\u798f), one of the founders of Lenovo, indicates the first meeting in preparation for starting the company was held on 17 October of the same year. Eleven people, the entirety of the initial staff, attended. Each of the founders was a member of the Institute of Computing Technology attached to the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]]. The 200,000 yuan used as start-up capital was approved by Z\u0113ng M\u00e0och\u00e1o (\u66fe\u8302\u671d). The name for the company agreed upon at this meeting was the Chinese Academy of Sciences Computer Technology Research Institute New Technology Development Company.<ref name=book1/>\n\nTheir first significant effort, an attempt to import televisions, failed. The group rebuilt itself within a year by conducting quality checks on computers for new buyers. Lenovo soon started developing a circuit board that would allow IBM-compatible personal computers to process Chinese characters. This product was Lenovo's first major success. Lenovo also tried and failed to market a digital watch. Liu said, \"Our management team often differed on which commercial road to travel. This led to big discussions, especially between the engineering chief and myself. He felt that if the quality of the product was good, then it would sell itself. But I knew this was not true, that marketing and other factors were part of the eventual success of a product.\" The fact that its staff had little business experience compounded Lenovo's early difficulties. \"We were mainly scientists and didn't understand the market\", Liu said. \"We just learned by trial-and-error, which was very interesting\u2014but also very dangerous\", said Liu. In 1990, Lenovo started to manufacture and market computers using its own brand name.<ref name=\"chief\">{{cite news |title=China's High-Tech Hero |author=Dickie, Mure |newspaper=Chief Executive |date=1 January 2005}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1988, Lenovo placed its first recruitment advertisement. The ad was placed on the front page of the ''China Youth News''. Such ads were quite rare in China then. Out of the 500 respondents, 280 were selected to take a written employment exam. 120 of these candidates were interviewed in person. Although interviewers initially only had authority to hire 16 people, 58 were given offers. The new staff included 18 people with graduate degrees, 37 with undergraduate degrees, and three students with no university-level education. Their average age was 26. [[Yang Yuanqing]], the current CEO of Lenovo, was among that group.<ref name=book1/>\n\nLiu Chuanzhi received government permission to form a subsidiary in Hong Kong and to move there along with five other employees. Liu's father, already in Hong Kong, furthered his son's ambitions through mentoring and facilitating loans. Liu moved to Hong Kong in 1988. To save money during this period, Liu and his co-workers walked instead of taking public transportation. To keep up appearances, they rented hotel rooms for meetings.<ref name=book1/>\n\n===IPO, second offerings, and bond sales===\nLenovo became publicly traded after a 1994 Hong Kong listing that raised nearly US$30 million. Prior to its IPO, many analysts were optimistic about Lenovo. The company was praised for its good management, strong brand recognition, and growth potential. Analysts also worried about Lenovo's profitability. Lenovo's IPO was massively over-subscribed. On its first day of trading, the company's stock price hit a high of HK$2.07 and closed at HK$2.00. Proceeds from the offering were used to finance sales offices in Europe, North America and Australia, to expand and improve production and research and development, and to increase working capital.<ref name=book1/>\n\nWhen Lenovo was first listed, its managers thought the only purpose of going public was to raise capital. They had little understanding of the rules and responsibilities that went along with running a public company. Before Lenovo conducted its first secondary offering in 1997, Liu proudly announced the company's intent to mainland newspapers only to have its stock halted for two days by regulators to punish his statement. This occurred several times until Liu learned that he had to choose his words carefully in public. The first time Liu traveled to Europe on a \"roadshow\" to discuss his company's stock, he was shocked by the skeptical questions he was subjected to and felt offended. Liu later came to understand that he was accountable to shareholders. He said, \"Before I only had one boss, but CAS never asked me anything. I relied on my own initiative to do things. We began to think about issues of credibility. Legend began to learn how to become a truly international company.\"<ref name=book1/>\n\nTo fund its continued growth, Lenovo issued a secondary offering of 50 million shares on the Hong Kong market in March 2000 and raised about US$212 million.<ref name=book1/>\n\n[[Mary Ma]], Lenovo's chief financial officer from 1990 to 2007, was in charge of investor relations. Under her leadership, Lenovo successfully integrated Western-style accountability into its corporate culture. Lenovo's emphasis on transparency earned it a reputation for the best corporate governance among mainland Chinese firms. All major issues regarding its board, management, major share transfers, and mergers and acquisitions were fairly and accurately reported. While Hong Kong-listed firms were only required to issue financial reports twice per year, Lenovo followed the international norm of issuing quarterly reports. Lenovo created an audit committee and a compensation committee with non-management directors. The company started roadshows twice per year to meet institutional investors. Ma organized the first-ever investor relations conference held in Mainland China. The conference was held in Beijing in 2002 and televised on CCTV. Liu and Ma co-hosted the conference and both gave speeches on corporate governance.<ref name=book1/>\n\n[[File:Lenovo logo (English).svg|thumb|Former Lenovo logo, used from 2003 until 2015]]\nIn May 2015, Lenovo revealed a new logo at Lenovo Tech World in Beijing, with the slogan \"Innovation Never Stands Still\" ({{zh|c=\u521b\u65b0\u65e0\u6b62\u5883}}). Lenovo's new logo, created by Saatchi, New York, can be changed by its advertising agencies and sales partners, within restrictions, to fit the context. It has a lounging \"e\" and is surrounded by a box that can be changed to use a relevant scene, solid color, or photograph. Lenovo's Chief Marketing Officer David Roman said, \"When we first started looking at it, it wasn't about just a change in typography or the look of the logo. We asked 'If we really are a net-driven, customer-centric company, what should the logo look like?' We came up with the idea of a digital logo first \u2026 designed to be used on the internet and adaptable to context.\"<ref name=\"AALogo\">{{cite news |last=Snyder Bulik |first=Beth |date=28 May 2015 |title=Worldwide PC Leader Lenovo Rebrands For Post-PC World\n|url=http://adage.com/article/digital/lenovo-rebrands-logo-renewed-post-pc-push/298773/ |newspaper=Advertising Age |location=United States |access-date=8 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn early June 2015, Lenovo announced plans to sell up to US$650 million in five-year bonds denominated in Chinese yuan. The bonds will be sold in Hong Kong with coupon ranging from 4.95% to 5.05%. This is only the second sale of bonds in Lenovo's history.

It had a pastel-colored, shell-shaped case and a seven-port USB hub under its screen. As of 2000, the Tianxi was the best-selling computer in Chinese history. It sold more than 1,000,000 units in 2000 alone.<ref name=\"Tianxi\">{{cite news |last=Sima |first=Katherine |date=19 December 2005 |title=Lenovo's design strategy drives success |url=http://www.plasticsnews.com/article/20051219/NEWS/312199974/lenovo-s-design-strategy-drives-success |newspaper=Plastics News |location=United States |access-date=7 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Mergers, acquisitions, and partnerships===\nLenovo works to integrate the management of each newly acquired company into its larger culture.

Some people have said we are a state-owned enterprise. It's 100% not true. In 1984 the Chinese Academy of Sciences only invested $25,000 in our company. The purpose of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to invest in this company was that they wanted to commercialize their research results. The Chinese Academy of Sciences is a pure research entity in China, owned by the government. From this point, you could say we're different from state-owned enterprises. Secondly, after this investment, this company is run totally by the founders and management team. The government has never been involved in our daily operation, in important decisions, strategic direction, nomination of the CEO and top executives and financial management. Everything is done by our management team.\"<ref name=\"state\">{{cite news |title=Q&A; Chinese Computer Giant Showcases Capitalist Credentials; Chairman of Lenovo, which acquired IBM's PC unit, says the firm has few government ties |author= |url= |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=4 May 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2006, the U.S. State Department was harshly criticized for purchasing 16,000 computers from Lenovo. Critics argued that Lenovo was controlled by the Chinese government and a potential vehicle for espionage against the United States. Yang spoke out forcefully and publicly to defend Lenovo. He said, \"We are not a government-controlled company.\" He pointed out that Lenovo pioneered China's transition to a market economy and that in the early 1990s had fought and beaten four state-owned enterprises that dominated the Chinese computer market. Those firms had the full backing of the state while Lenovo received no special treatment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2006-04-19/lenovos-foreign-affairs|title=Lenovo's Foreign Affairs|first=Steve|last=Hamm|date=20 April 2006|url-access=subscription }}</ref> The State Department deal went through. Yang worried that fears about Lenovo's supposed connections to the Chinese government would be an ongoing issue in the United States. Yang worked to ease worries by communicating directly with Congress.\n\nYang dramatically increased his ownership stake by acquiring 797 million shares in 2011. As of June 2011, Yang owned an 8 percent stake in Lenovo. He previously owned only 70 million shares. In a statement, Yang said, \"While the transaction is a personal financial matter, I want to be very clear that my decision to make this investment is based on my strong belief in the company's very bright future. Our culture is built on commitment and ownership&nbsp;\u2013 we do what we say, and we own what we do.

While Lenovo was founded using seed capital from the state-owned [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], Lenovo is run as a private enterprise with little or no interference by the state. Lenovo's senior executives, including many non-Chinese, rotate between two head offices, one in Beijing and the other in Morrisville, North Carolina, and Lenovo's research and development center in Japan. Two foreigners have previously served as Lenovo's CEO.<ref name=Econ1/>\n\nEnglish is Lenovo's official language. Lenovo's CEO, Yang Yuanqing, initially did not understand English well, but relocated his family to Morrisville to improve his language skills and learn American ways. One American Lenovo executive interviewed by ''The Economist'' praised Yang for his efforts to make Lenovo a friendly place for foreigners to work. He said that Yang had created a \"performance culture\" in place of the traditional Chinese work style of \"waiting to see what the emperor wants\".<ref name=Econ1/>\n\n===Leadership===\n\n====Yang Yuanqing====\n[[File:Yang Yuanqing.jpeg|thumb|Yang Yuanqing, Lenovo's Chairman and CEO]]\n{{Main|Yang Yuanqing}}\nYang Yuanqing is the chairman and chief executive officer of Lenovo.

Yang was chairman of Lenovo's board from 2004 to 2008, and returned as chairman in 2012 alongside his role as CEO.\n\nIn 2012, Yang received a $3 million bonus as a reward for record profits, which he in turn redistributed to about 10,000 of Lenovo's employees. According to Lenovo spokesman, Jeffrey Shafer, Yang felt that it would be the right thing to, \"redirect [the money] to the employees as a real tangible gesture for what they done.\" Shafer also said that Yang, who owns about eight percent of Lenovo's stock, \"felt that he was rewarded well simply as the owner of the company.\"<ref name=\"Bonus\">{{cite news |title=CEO of Lenovo Gives $3 Million in Bonuses to Employees |first=Lyneka |last=Little |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/business/2012/07/ceo-of-lenovo-gives-3-million-in-bonuses-to-employees/ |newspaper=ABC News |date=23 July 2012 |accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref> The bonuses were mostly distributed among staff working in positions such as production and reception who received an average of 2,000 yuan or about US$314.

Liu was trained as an engineer at a military college and later went on to work at the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]]. Like many young people during the Cultural Revolution, Liu was denounced and sent to the countryside where he worked as a laborer on a rice farm. Liu claims [[Hewlett-Packard]] as a key source of inspiration. In an interview with ''[[The Economist]]'' he stated that \"Our earliest and best teacher was Hewlett-Packard.\" For more than ten years, Lenovo was Hewlett-Packard's distributor in China.<ref name=\"Economist\">{{cite news |title=Face value: Legend in the making |author= |url=http://www.economist.com/node/780748 |newspaper=The Economist |date=15 September 2001 |accessdate=6 February 2013}}</ref> In reference to Lenovo's later acquisition of IBM's personal computer unit Liu said, \"I remember the first time I took part in a meeting of IBM agents. I was wearing an old business suit of my father's and I sat in the back row. Even in my dreams, I never imagined that one day we could buy the IBM PC business. It was unthinkable. Impossible.\"<ref name=\"chief\"/>\n\n====Board of directors====\nIn early 2013, Lenovo announced the addition of Yahoo founder [[Jerry Yang (entrepreneur)|Jerry Yang]] to its board. Lenovo's CEO Yang Yuanqing said, \"Jerry's appointment as an observer to our board furthers Lenovo's reputation as a transparent international company.\" Just prior to the appointment of Jerry Yang, Tudor Brown, the founder of British semiconductor design firm [[ARM Holdings|ARM]], was also appointed to Lenovo's board. Speaking of both men Yang Yuanqing said, \"We believe that they will add a great deal to our strategic thinking, long-term direction and, ultimately, our ability to achieve our aspirations in the PC plus era.\"\n\n==Marketing and sponsorships==\n\n===Emerging markets===\nIn 2009, Lenovo became the first personal computer manufacturer to divide countries into emerging markets and mature markets. Lenovo then developed a different set of strategies for each category. Lenovo's competitors have widely adopted the same approach<ref name=\"People\"/>\n\nIn 2012, Lenovo made a major effort to expand its market share in developing economies such as Brazil and India through acquisitions and increased budgets for marketing and advertising. While Lenovo has not revealed its total spending on marketing, it did increase marketing and advertising expenditures by $248 million in the fiscal year ending in 2012.<ref name=Econ1/>\n\n====China====\n[[File:A Lenovo Store in China.jpg|thumb|upright|A Lenovo Store in China]]\nIn China, Lenovo has a vast distribution network designed to make sure that there is at least one shop selling Lenovo computers within 50 kilometers of nearly all consumers. Lenovo has also developed close relationships with its Chinese distributors, who are granted exclusive territories and only carry Lenovo products.<ref name=Econ1/>\n\nAs of July 2013, Lenovo believes that urbanization initiatives being pushed by Premier [[Li Keqiang]] will allow it to sustain sales growth in China for the foreseeable future. Speaking at Lenovo's annual general meeting in Hong Kong in 2013, Yang Yuanqing said: \"I believe urbanisation will help us further increase the overall [domestic] PC market.\" Yang also stressed the opportunity presented by the China's relatively low penetration rate of personal computers. Lenovo previously benefited from the Chinese government's rural subsidies, part of a wider economic stimulus initiative, designed to increase purchases of appliances and electronics. That program, which Lenovo joined in 2004, ended in 2011. Lenovo enjoys consistent price premiums over its traditional competitors in rural markets and a stronger local sales and service presence.<ref name=\"FT2\">{{cite web |last=Hille |first=Kathrin |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/da66ab1e-e9fe-11e2-b2f4-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2Yk2jG67n |title=Lenovo optimistic about China's economy |publisher=FT.com |date=2013-07-11 |accessdate=2013-09-28}}</ref>\n\n====India====\nLenovo has gained significant market share in India through bulk orders to large companies and government agencies. For example, the government of [[Tamil Nadu]] ordered a million laptops from Lenovo in 2012 and single-handedly made the firm a market leader. Lenovo distributes most of the personal computers it sells in India through five national distributors such as [[Ingram Micro]] and Redington.<ref name=\"India6\"/>\n\nGiven that most smartphones and tablets are sold to individuals Lenovo is pursuing a different strategy making use of many small state-centric distributors. Amar Babu, Lenovo's managing director for India, said, \"To reach out to small towns and the hinterland, we have tied up with 40 regional distributors. We want our distributors to be exclusive to us. We will, in turn, ensure they have exclusive rights to distribute Lenovo products in their catchment area.\"<ref name=\"India6\">{{cite news |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-03-26/news/38040354_1_million-smartphones-lenovo-india-amar-babu |work=The Times Of India |title=Can Lenovo protect its leadership in PCs & gain share in mobile, tablet businesses in India? |date=26 March 2013}}</ref> As of 2013, Lenovo had about 6,000 retailers selling smartphones and tablets in India. In February 2013, Lenovo established a relationship with Reliance Communications to sell smartphones. The smartphones carried by Reliance have dual-SIM capability and support both GSM and CDMA. Babu claims that the relative under penetration of smartphones in India represents an opportunity for Lenovo.<ref name=\"India6\"/>\n\nLenovo has assembled a team of senior managers familiar with the Indian market, launched mobile phones at all price points there, and worked on branding to build market share. As of February 2014, Lenovo claims that its sales of smartphones in India have been increasing 100% per quarter while the market is only growing 15-20% over the same period. Lenovo did marketing tests of its smartphones in November 2012 in [[Gujarat]] and some southern cities, where Lenovo already had a strong presence. Lenovo's strategy has been to create awareness, maintain a broad selection of phones at all price points, and develop distribution networks. Lenovo partnered with two national distributors and over 100 local distributors. As of February 2014, more than 7,000 retail outlets in India sold Lenovo smartphones. Lenovo has also partnered with HCL in order to set up 250 service centres in 110 cities.<ref name=\"India1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/lenovo-creates-a-big-mobile-buzz/1228658?rheditorpick|title=Lenovo creates a big mobile buzz|first=Sudhir|last=Chowdhary|work=The Financial Express}}</ref>\n\nIn India, Lenovo grants distributors exclusive territories but allows them to sell computers from other companies. Lenovo uses its close relationships with distributors to gain [[market intelligence]] and speed up product development.\n\nLenovo reported a year-on-year increase of about 951% in tablet sales in India for the first quarter of 2014.

West Africa followed when Lenovo set-up a Nigerian legal office and then expanded to Ghana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Botswana.\n\nAccording to Lenovo's general manager for Africa, Graham Braum, Lenovo's strategy is to put \"great emphasis on products that sell well in Africa\" and roll out \"products alongside different African governments' rolling out of wireless technology\". Products such as the Lenovo Yoga series are popular in Africa because of their long battery life, as many areas have unreliable electrical supply. Other popular products include the Lenovo netbooks, which were introduced in 2008.<ref name=dexing>{{cite news |last=Dexing |first=Qin |date=2015-02-13 |title=Lenovo Expands to Africa |url=http://www.ecns.cn/business/2015/02-13/154889.shtml |newspaper=ECNS.com |access-date=2015-03-09}}</ref>\n\nLenovo picked Nigeria in 2013 to release its smartphone because unlike South Africa and other African countries, there is no requirement to partner with a local telecom firm to sell its phones.<ref name=\"Africa1\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-09/lenovo-will-debut-first-africa-smartphone-in-nigeria-by-year-end.html |work=Bloomberg |first=Chris |last=Spillane |title=Lenovo Plans to Debut Africa Smartphone in Nigeria This Year |date=10 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the long term, according to Braum, \"Lenovo in Africa will focus on continuing to consistently supply personal computer products and allow this market to grow, while moving into new territory such as mobile and enterprise.\"<ref name=dexing/>\n\n===United States===\nIn the United States, Lenovo began the \"For Those Who Do\" marketing campaign in 2010, created by the ad agency [[Saatchi & Saatchi]]. The campaign was Lenovo's first to go global, except for its domestic market in China, where it retained its existing \"Imagine\" ([[Pinyin]]: ''lian xiang'') slogan.

Lenovo said that this sponsorship would boost its efforts to market to the key 18- to 35-year-old male demographic.\n\nThe NFL has been a Lenovo customer since 2007 and the sponsorship resulted from that relationship. NFL stars [[Jerry Rice]], [[DeAngelo Williams]], and [[Torry Holt]] were on hand for the announcement and a celebration with 1,500 Lenovo employees.

[[Martin Campbell]], who previously worked on action movies and James Bond films such as GoldenEye and the remake of Casino Royale, shot this film. Lenovo was the first Chinese company to make use of such marketing techniques.<ref name=\"Big1\"/>\n\n===Tech World===\nIn May 2015, Lenovo hosted its first ever \"Tech World\" conference in Beijing. The CEOs of [[Intel]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Baidu]] delivered keynote addresses along with Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing. Lenovo also used Tech World to announce a refresh of its corporate logo and visual identity. The shift in Lenovo's visual presentation was accompanied by changes in Lenovo's business model.

Goodweird is designed to convey the idea that designs that seem strange initially often become familiar and widely accepted. The Goodweird campaign includes a video with famous images of early attempts to fly with the aid of homemade wings and a bicycle that transitions to a modern-day shot of a man soaring across mountains in a wingsuit before transitioning again to a shot of the [[Stealth Bomber]]. Lenovo worked with three agencies on Goodweird: London-based DLKW Low, We Are Social, and Blast Radius. Goodweird is part of Lenovo's wider strategy to appeal to millennials with an emphasis on design trendsetters. A portion of the funding for Goodweird is being directed to prominent [[YouTubers]] and Viners.

This process occurs even on clean installations of Windows. It was found that this program had been automatically installed using a new feature in [[Windows 8]], [[Features new to Windows 8#Windows Platform Binary Table|Windows Platform Binary Table]], which allows executable files to be stored within UEFI firmware for execution on startup, and is meant to \"allow critical software to persist even when the operating system has changed or been reinstalled in a 'clean' configuration\"; specifically, anti-theft security software.

This is a solution.\"<ref name=\"guiding\">Fisher, Bob (February 2001). \"Guiding Light\" ''American Cinematographer Magazine''. pp. 72-83</ref>\n\n==35 mm Univisium camera proposal==\n[[File:Univisium-simulated-digital-sound.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A simulated strip of 35 mm film in the proposed Univisium 2.00:1 [[Negative pulldown|3-perf]] format with two digital [[sound-on-film|soundtracks]] present. At far left and far right, outside the perforations, is the [[Sony Dynamic Digital Sound|SDDS]] soundtrack as an image of a digital signal. Between the perforations (on the left side) is the [[Dolby Digital]] soundtrack (note the tiny Dolby \"Double D\" logo in the center of each area between the perforations).]]\n\nStoraro recognized that ubiquitous HD origination was not yet viable and therefore proposed an alteration to standard 35&nbsp;mm photography to create a 2.00:1 aspect ratio and economize on film.\n\nBy using a negative area similar to that of the [[Super 35]] frame (which utilizes the full width of a 35&nbsp;mm film frame \"perf-to-perf\" as opposed to traditional 35&nbsp;mm which utilizes a smaller area of the 35&nbsp;mm frame offset to the right to accommodate space for an [[sound-on-film|optical soundtrack]]) combined with [[3-perf]] frame size (as opposed to standard 35&nbsp;mm photography which uses four perforations per frame). The Univisium camera would use an aperture opening of 24mm \u00d7 12mm (.945\" \u00d7 .472\") and three perforations per frame,<ref name=\"Univisium\" /> which would eliminate the waste associated with 2.40:1 Super 35&nbsp;mm photography (wherein nearly 50% of the frame is discarded){{Citation needed|reason=As far as I know, parts of the frame are discarded when using two-perf Techniscope. By using anamorphic lenses, \"proper\" widescreen, all four perfs are used|date=September 2016}} by creating a natural 2.00:1 aspect ratio utilizing the whole film area.\n\nIn addition to using the full film area, using three perforations per frame as opposed to four equates to using 25% less film for the same shooting time.  With the traditional four perforations per frame, 35&nbsp;mm film (at 24 frames per second) runs at 90 feet per minute (4 minutes 26 seconds per 400 feet of film), three perforations per frame runs at 67.5 feet per minute (5 minutes 56 seconds per 400 feet of film).<ref>Holben, Jay & Bankston, Douglas (February 2000). \"Inventive New Options for Film\" ''American Cinematographer Magazine'' pp. 105-107</ref> This would mean each magazine of film would have 33% more shooting time and a production that shot the same overall length of time as a four-perforation film would use 25% less film.\n\nThe proposal also points out that the 2.00:1 aspect ratio can be achieved using standard spherical lenses, which, compared to their anamorphic counterparts, are cheaper, faster (require less light), and have more photographic [[depth of field]] and less visual imperfections.  There are also a greater selection of spherical prime and zoom lenses than there are anamorphic lenses.\n\n3-perf also results in a quieter camera than 4-perf as there is less [[intermittent movement]] per frame.\n\nThe format also calls for shooting 25 frames per second, which eliminates problems associated with transferring film to video in the [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] system and is still fairly simple to transfer to the [[NTSC]] video format.\n\n===35 mm Univisium projection proposal===\nStoraro suggests a renovation to standard film projectors to present a 3-perf frame and eliminate the need for an anamorphic print to be made (to optically squeeze the 2:1 3-perf aspect ratio into a 1.33:1 4-perf frame).  As the image will fill the full film area (perf-to-perf) there is no room for a traditional optical soundtrack and Univisium requires two digital soundtracks, one for backup (which reside outside of the perforations on the edge of the film; [[Digital Theater System|DTS]], [[Sony Dynamic Digital Sound]], [[Dolby Digital]]).  The projectors would run at 25 frames per second, just as the cameras do.<ref name=\"Univisium\" />\n\nAs a compromise to standard technology (for the time being), Storaro says an anamorphic print can be made and presented in 24 frames per second with a digital and/or optical soundtrack. \n\nHowever, with the rise of the DCP (Digital Cinema Package), the 2:1 image can be projected from a ''flat'' (1.85:1) container in either 2K (1998x999) or 4K (3996x1998), with mild letterboxing.\n\n==Univisium in use==\nAlthough no film has utilized the full aspects of the proposal, particularly with regard to the projection standards, Storaro has since used Univisium for nearly all of his films.\n\nTechnovision<ref>Kodak ''In Camera Magazine''.

Retrieved 2007-06-11.</ref> This has proved controversial with many film enthusiasts, who believe that regardless of Storaro's attempt to unify all aspect ratios, films should be viewed in the ratio they were filmed in, without any cropping. Due to this backlash, ''Apocalypse Now'' and ''Reds'' use their original aspect ratios for Blu-ray release.\n\nOther films that were reframed to the Univisium aspect ratio on DVD include the 1998 DVD release of ''[[Top Gun]]'' (1986), the 1999 & 2004 DVDs of ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'' (1991), and the original DVD release of ''[[Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery]]'' (1997).\n\nMany trailers of upcoming films from ''[[20th Century Studios]]'' that are shot in the 2.39:1 aspect ratio are cropped to this format when they play ahead of any movies that were shot in 1.85:1.\n\nAccording to IMDB technical specification statistics, there are over 700 titles with 2:1 aspect ratios, and the number has been growing in recent years.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/interfaces</ref>\n\nNetflix production and post-production requirements state that they prefer content up to 2:1 aspect ratio anything wider must be evaluated and discussed.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://partnerhelp.netflixstudios.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000579527-Cameras-and-Image-Capture |title = Cameras and Image Capture}}</ref>\n\n===Aspect ratio used in music videos===\n\n*[[Miranda Cosgrove]]: ''[[Kissin U]]'' (2010)\n*[[Girls' Generation]]: ''[[Hoot (song)|Hoot (\ud6d7)]]'' (2010)\n*[[Shawn Mendes]] and [[Camila Cabello]]: ''[[Se\u00f1orita (Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello song)|Se\u00f1orita]]'' (2019)\n*[[Megan Thee Stallion]] feat.

The regiment served as [[mounted infantry]] from March 17, 1863, to November 1, 1864, notably as part of the [[Lightning Brigade (US Army of the Cumberland 1863)|Lightning Brigade]] during the [[Tullahoma campaign|Tullahoma]] and [[Chickamauga campaign|Chickamauga]] Campaigns.\n\n==Initial Infantry Service==\nThe 72nd Indiana Infantry was organized at [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]], [[Indiana]] and mustered in for a three-year enlistment at [[Indianapolis]], Indiana, on August 16, 1862, under the command of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Abram O. Miller.\n\n==Conversion to Mounted Infantry ==\n\nIn December 1862, the regiment received a new brigade commander, Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]. After frustrating chases on foot after mounted rebel cavalry raiders, the brigade was converted to mounted infantry. At the same time, Wilder proposed to the regiments in the brigade the private purchase of repeating rifles. The 72nd voted to go ahead with the conversion to mounted infantry and the purchase of the rifles. Along with the other regiments in the brigade, the 72nd chose [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s, invented by [[Christopher Spencer]], as their weapon.<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer carbine at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref> \n\n[[Image:Spencer-rifle transparent.png|thumb|left|300px|As part of the \"Wilder Lightning Brigade,\" the 72nd was among the first units fighting in the Civil War to receive the [[Spencer repeating rifle]].]]\nAfter intense training and development of new tactics, the \"Lightning Brigade\" was ready for service. The mounted infantry proof of concept for the Army of the Cumberland occurred in their first mounted infantry action at the [[Battle of Hoover's Gap]].<ref>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref><ref>http://howcanamandiebetter.com/the-lightning-brigade</ref> Despite torrential rains, the 72nd and its brigade gained the gap so quickly that they surprised and scattered surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J.

The 72nd drove the enemy before it along the seven mile length of the gap until they were halted by four brigades of infantry and four batteries of guns at the southeastern exit. The massive superiority of firepower the 17th and its brethren had with the Spencers allowed them to entrench and hold the southern entrance against numerous assaults by numerically superior rebel infantry and artillery through the rainy day until the sodden remainder of the XIV Corps slogged to join them at their position.\n\nWith the Lightning Brigade, the 72nd found itself detached from the XIV Corps to serve as a mobile reserve for all three of the Corps within the Cumberland. After playing a key role in the [[Second Battle of Chattanooga|feint]] that forced Bragg from Chattanooga, the regiment raided, skirmished, and scouted through the summer into the [[Chickamauga Campaign]]. The brigade distinguished itself with its performance at [[Battle of Chickamauga|Chickamauga]]. During the battle, it maintained integrity and discipline exacting high casualties on its attackers. After the battle, it retreated with the army to Chattanooga where it was besieged. \n\nThe performance of the brigade had demonstrated the value of mounted infantry, and Wilder and the regiments were commended. During the reorganization after Grant took command in the city, the brigade was broken up and the regiments were transferred to the Cavalry Corps. The 72nd and the [[123rd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|123rd Illinois]] were assigned to 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps.\n\n==Dismounting==\nIn positions at Terrapin Creek in [[Cherokee County, Alabama|Cherokee County, northern Alabama]], the 72nd was dismounted on 1 November. They became a regular infantry regiment armed with Spencers. For the remainder of the war, they operated in the regular infantry role.\n\n==Service History==\n\nIts assignments were as follows:\n* 40th Brigade, 12th Division, [[Army of the Ohio]], to November 1862. \n* 2nd Brigade, 5th Division, Center, [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], [[Army of the Cumberland]], to January 1863. \n* 2nd Brigade, 5th Division, XIV Corps, to June 1863. \n* 1st Brigade, 4th Division, XIV Corps, to October 1863.* \n* Wilder's Mounted Infantry Brigade, Cavalry Corps, Army of the Cumberland, to December 1863. \n* 3rd Brigade, 2nd Cavalry Division, Army of the Cumberland, to January 1864. \n* 3rd Brigade, Grierson's Cavalry Division, [[XVI Corps (Union Army)|XVI Corps]], [[Army of the Tennessee]], to March 1864. \n* 3rd Brigade, 2nd Cavalry Division, Army of the Cumberland, to October 1864. \n* 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, Wilson's Cavalry Corps, Military Division Mississippi, to June 1865.\n\nThe 72nd Indiana Infantry mustered out of service at [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], on June 26, 1865.\n\nThe 72nd served at the following locations:<ref>History of the 72d Indiana Volunteer Infantry of the Mounted Lightning Brigade, B.

Along with the other regiments in the brigade, the 72nd chose [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s, invented by [[Christopher Spencer]], as their weapon.<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer carbine at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref> \n\n[[Image:Spencer-rifle transparent.png|thumb|left|300px|As part of the \"Wilder Lightning Brigade,\" the 72nd was among the first units fighting in the Civil War to receive the [[Spencer repeating rifle]].]]\nAfter intense training and development of new tactics, the \"Lightning Brigade\" was ready for service. The mounted infantry proof of concept for the Army of the Cumberland occurred in their first mounted infantry action at the [[Battle of Hoover's Gap]].<ref>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref><ref>http://howcanamandiebetter.com/the-lightning-brigade</ref> Despite torrential rains, the 72nd and its brigade gained the gap so quickly that they surprised and scattered surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J. Russell Butler at breakfast in front of the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm National Park Service battle description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161310/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm |date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>. The 72nd drove the enemy before it along the seven mile length of the gap until they were halted by four brigades of infantry and four batteries of guns at the southeastern exit. The massive superiority of firepower the 17th and its brethren had with the Spencers allowed them to entrench and hold the southern entrance against numerous assaults by numerically superior rebel infantry and artillery through the rainy day until the sodden remainder of the XIV Corps slogged to join them at their position.\n\nWith the Lightning Brigade, the 72nd found itself detached from the XIV Corps to serve as a mobile reserve for all three of the Corps within the Cumberland. After playing a key role in the [[Second Battle of Chattanooga|feint]] that forced Bragg from Chattanooga, the regiment raided, skirmished, and scouted through the summer into the [[Chickamauga Campaign]]. The brigade distinguished itself with its performance at [[Battle of Chickamauga|Chickamauga]]. During the battle, it maintained integrity and discipline exacting high casualties on its attackers. After the battle, it retreated with the army to Chattanooga where it was besieged. \n\nThe performance of the brigade had demonstrated the value of mounted infantry, and Wilder and the regiments were commended. During the reorganization after Grant took command in the city, the brigade was broken up and the regiments were transferred to the Cavalry Corps. The 72nd and the [[123rd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|123rd Illinois]] were assigned to 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps.\n\n==Dismounting==\nIn Nashville\n\n==Service History==\n\nIts assignments were as follows:\n* 40th Brigade, 12th Division, [[Army of the Ohio]], to November 1862. \n* 2nd Brigade, 5th Division, Center, [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], [[Army of the Cumberland]], to January 1863. \n* 2nd Brigade, 5th Division, XIV Corps, to June 1863. \n* 1st Brigade, 4th Division, XIV Corps, to October 1863.* \n* Wilder's Mounted Infantry Brigade, Cavalry Corps, Army of the Cumberland, to December 1863. \n* 3rd Brigade, 2nd Cavalry Division, Army of the Cumberland, to January 1864. \n* 3rd Brigade, Grierson's Cavalry Division, [[XVI Corps (Union Army)|XVI Corps]], [[Army of the Tennessee]], to March 1864. \n* 3rd Brigade, 2nd Cavalry Division, Army of the Cumberland, to October 1864. \n* 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, Wilson's Cavalry Corps, Military Division Mississippi, to June 1865.\n\nThe 72nd Indiana Infantry mustered out of service at [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], on June 26, 1865.\n\nThe 72nd served at the following locations:<ref>History of the 72d Indiana Volunteer Infantry of the Mounted Lightning Brigade, B.
