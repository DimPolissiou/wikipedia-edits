He joined the [[Mexican Army]] in 1987, specializing in explosives, martial arts and [[grenade launcher]]s. In 1999, he deserted the military and joined the Gulf Cartel under kingpin [[Osiel C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n]], becoming one of the first members of its newly formed paramilitary wing, Los Zetas. Like Guerrero Reyes, most of the first members of Los Zetas were ex-military. Los Zetas was responsible for providing security services to C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n and carrying out executions on the cartel's behalf.\n\nKnown for his arrogance and violent behavior, Guerrero Reyes was a suspect in multiple murders, including those of his girlfriend and wife. Investigators suspect he was part of the commando group that assassinated kingpin [[Edelio L\u00f3pez Falc\u00f3n]]. Guerrero Reyes was also an instructor to new Zetas members, training them in combat and counter-insurgency. In 2004, he was killed in a drive-by shooting by unknown assailants along with four other people after he left a [[discotheque]] in [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]]. His murder remains unsolved; it is not known if he was killed by his own cartel or by rival gangsters.\n\n==Early life and career==\nGuerrero Reyes joined the [[Mexican Army]] on 1&nbsp;March 1987, as an infantry soldier in the 70th Infantry Battalion.<ref name=\"jOvhq\" /> From 11&nbsp;April to 17&nbsp;June 1989, he served as a paratrooper in the [[Brigada de Fusileros Paracaidistas|Parachute Rifle Brigade]] (BFP).<ref name=\":0\" />{{Sfn|Grayson|2017|p=225}} In the BFP, he became a specialist in explosives, martial arts and [[grenade launcher]]s.{{Sfn|Grayson|2017|p=225}} Guerrero Reyes was promoted to the rank of corporal in the infantry division on 1&nbsp;November 1990 and was assigned to lead a small squadron of five soldiers.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> On 1&nbsp;March 1992, he was promoted to second degree sergeant.<ref name=\":0\" /> Guerrero Reyes reportedly received military and counter-drug training in the United States.<ref name=\"J7SAr\" /> In addition to the BFP, he also received special forces training as a member of the elite [[Cuerpo de Fuerzas Especiales|Grupo Aerom\u00f3vil de Fuerzas Especiales]] (GAFE).{{efn|When Guerrero Reyes joined the BFP, it was one of the elite branches of the military along with [[Cuerpo de Fuerzas Especiales|Grupo Aerom\u00f3vil de Fuerzas Especiales]] (GAFE).<ref name=\":5\" />}}<ref name=\"qkLol\" /> In addition to his military duties, he was also assigned to work temporarily in the National Counter-Narcotics Institute (INCD).<ref name=\"uEEHl\" /> He deserted from the military on 4&nbsp;January 1999.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter this, Guerrero Reyes joined the [[Gulf Cartel]], a criminal group based in [[Tamaulipas]].<ref name=\"c9Inm\" /><ref name=\"PVepP\" /> He became a member of the cartel's newly created paramilitary group known as [[Los Zetas]], which was largely composed of ex-commandos.{{sfn|Ravelo|2007|p=255-258}} He was hired to work for the cartel boss [[Osiel C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n]], and was assigned under Zetas leader [[Arturo Guzm\u00e1n Decena]] (\"Z-1\").<ref name=\"cnnmex\" /> When Guerrero Reyes joined Los Zetas, the group's purpose was to provide security services to C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n and carry out executions on the cartel's behalf. Over the years, Los Zetas underwent organizational changes and became increasingly involved in other criminal activities alongside the Gulf Cartel, including drug trafficking.<ref name=\"logan\" /> With the collaboration of several Gulf Cartel and Zetas members,{{efn|The Gulf Cartel members were: Sergio Garza Garza (\"El Pollo\"), Rogelio Garc\u00eda Garc\u00eda (\"El Roger\") and [[Jorge Eduardo Costilla S\u00e1nchez]] (\"El Coss\"). The Zetas members were: [[Jes\u00fas Enrique Rej\u00f3n Aguilar]] (\"El Mamito\"), [[Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano]] (\"El Lazca\") and [[\u00d3scar Guerrero Silva]] (\"El Winniepooh\").{{Sfn|Garcia Cabrera|2012|p=362}}}} Guerrero Reyes forged alliances with South American drug suppliers like [[Andrea Posada Williamson]], Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo Nieto Benjumea, Elkin Fernando Cano Villa and Edwin Torrado.{{Sfn|Garcia Cabrera|2012|p=362}} In the cartel, Guerrero Reyes went by the alias \"El Guerrero\" (English: The Warrior), which derived from his surname Guerrero, and as \"Beto\", a nickname from his middle name Alberto.<ref name=\"c9Inm\" /> He also held the code names of \"Z-5\" and \"Z12-HK44\".{{Sfn|Grayson|2017|p=225}}<ref name=\"operacionesalias\" /> Guerrero Reyes is often cited as one of the founding members of Los Zetas who was reportedly part of the [[Grupo de los 14]] (English: Group of 14), who were the first fourteen Zetas members.<ref name=\"i16ZY\" />{{Sfn|Marley|2019|p=280-281}} He was based out of [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].{{Sfn|Grayson|2017|p=225}}\n\nAccording to the testimony of Agust\u00edn Hern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez, a close associate of C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n, who later became a protected witness under the code name \"Rafael\", Guerrero Reyes was also an instructor for new Zetas recruits.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\"I8w1N\" /> Under the instruction of Guzm\u00e1n Decena, Guerrero Reyes and former Army lieutenant Carlos Hau Casta\u00f1eda led Los Zetas's first training course at a farm known as Punta Selva in Matamoros.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\"procesoz5\" /> Guerrero Reyes provided instruction on how to use AK-47s, AR-15s with grenade launchers, and .50-calibre machine guns. He also taught how to conduct ambushes, rapid deployments, prisoner rescues, counter-insurgencies, intelligence gathering, marksmanship, aerial assault tactics, surveillance, and advanced communication techniques. The course included an art of intimidation class and rigorous physical fitness tests.{{Sfn|Grayson|2017|p=47}} The training program lasted about a month.<ref name=\":4\" /> These sessions in Matamoros lasted until September 2001, when C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n ordered them to be moved to Nuevo Le\u00f3n and other parts of Tamaulipas.<ref name=\"83uTZ\" />\n\nGuerrero Reyes was also reportedly responsible for participating in two prison breaks in Tamaulipas and [[Michoac\u00e1n]].<ref name=\"hmakT\" /> The first one occurred in Matamoros on 27&nbsp;December 2002, when approximately fifty Zetas members stormed the [[Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 3]] (\"Noroeste\") and released four inmates linked to the Gulf Cartel.<ref name=\"B4KJM\" /> Investigators stated that the Zetas went into the prison dressed in police uniforms and driving vehicles similar to those from the Army.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\"0rXJe\" /> Once inside the prison, they identified themselves as federal officers and showed the prison staff a forged document ordering the release of four individuals. When the staff reviewed the document, they were disarmed by the gunmen, who then forcibly retrieved the four prisoners.<ref name=\":6\" /> The second incident occurred in [[Apatzing\u00e1n]] on 4&nbsp;January 2004, when approximately forty Zetas members stormed the penitentiary to release five imprisoned Gulf Cartel members linked to [[Carlos Rosales Mendoza]] (\"El T\u00edsico\").<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\"7HQD5\" /> They entered the prison wearing police uniforms and simulated carrying out a routine inspection.<ref name=\":7\" /> Once inside the prison, they overwhelmed the guards and penetrated the security doors.<ref name=\"UVPQm\" /> During the raid, around twenty other inmates managed to escape.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Criminal charges ===\nOn 18&nbsp;June 2003, Mexico's [[Attorney General of Mexico|Attorney General's Office]] (PGR) placed an unspecified [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] on 31 members of Los Zetas, including Guerrero Reyes.<ref name=\"Aahsx\" /> Authorities stated that he was \"highly dangerous\" given his military background and his suspected role in homicides, drug trafficking, kidnappings, and [[carjacking]]s.<ref name=\"9Qkxa\" /> This announcement was made after the Specialized Unit Against Organized Crime (UEDO) identified him as a high-ranking member of Los Zetas following the 14&nbsp;March arrest of C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n.<ref name=\"9P6u7\" /> Unlike other Zetas members who voluntarily requested their release from the military, Guerrero Reyes had deserted and joined organized crime, which is considered high treason in a military court. Guerrero Reyes was wanted by the PGR, the [[Secretariat of National Defense (Mexico)|Secretariat of National Defense]] (SEDENA) and the [[Secretariat of Public Security]] (SSP) for his outstanding charges.<ref name=\"xrtMw\" /><ref name=\"B4KJM\" />\n\nKnown for his arrogance and violent behavior, Guerrero Reyes had an arrest warrant issued for his suspected involvement in multiple killings from 12&nbsp;February to 10&nbsp;March 2003.{{Sfn|Grayson|2017|p=225}}<ref name=\":3\" /> He was suspected of killing his girlfriend Erica Edith Gonz\u00e1lez, who was found dead in the rural community of La Venada along with two other people, and of his wife Jovanna Lizbeth Melchor Ceballos, who was killed with another man.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> According to the PGR and SEDENA, Guerrero Reyes was also a main suspect in the murder of kingpin [[Edelio L\u00f3pez Falc\u00f3n]] (\"El Yeyo\").<ref name=\"woBbP\" /> L\u00f3pez Falc\u00f3n was a former member of the Gulf Cartel, but left to join a rival criminal group after he encountered differences with the cartel after senior cartel member [[Gilberto Garc\u00eda Mena]] was arrested in 2001. Several within the cartel blamed L\u00f3pez Falc\u00f3n for his arrest.<ref name=\"sicariosjune\" /><ref name=\"flores\" /> C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n reportedly commissioned Guerrero Reyes and others, including Zetas members [[Jes\u00fas Enrique Rej\u00f3n Aguilar]] (\"El Mamito\"), [[Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano]] (\"El Lazca\") and/or [[\u00d3scar Guerrero Silva]] (\"El Winniepooh\"), to execute him. L\u00f3pez Falc\u00f3n was killed inside a restaurant on 6&nbsp;May.<ref name=\"cronicaexmili\" />\n\n== Shootout and death ==\nAt around 4:30&nbsp;a.m. on 10&nbsp;May 2004, Guerrero Reyes was killed by unknown assailants in a drive-by shooting in Matamoros.<ref name=\":3\" /> The attack occurred before dawn near the Wild West discotheque while Guerrero Reyes was inside a silver Jeep Liberty between Michoac\u00e1n and 16&nbsp;de&nbsp;Septiembre streets in Colonia Modelo, an industrial neighborhood.<ref name=\":1\" /> Guerrero Reyes had just left the discotheque and was described by authorities as a regular in strip clubs and night clubs in Matamoros.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"hmakT\" /> Besides Guerrero Reyes, four other people were killed. One of them was Leonardo Garc\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez, a former [[Matamoros Municipal Police]] officer and alleged cartel member. The other victims were female and identified as Perla Lourdes Garc\u00eda Torres, Rosa Isela Purata C\u00e1rdenas and Nancy L\u00f3pez Gonz\u00e1lez.<ref name=\":1\" /> Four of them died at the scene, but the last one was taken alive to the [[Dr. Alfredo Pumarejo Hospital]], where she eventually succumbed to her wounds.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> The victims' ages and addresses were not revealed to the press.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nNeighbors and witnesses stated that the shootout lasted between three and five minutes. One resident stated that at first he thought the noise was caused by the muffler of a vehicle, but as the attack progressed, he realized it was a shootout. The [[Federal Police (Mexico)|Mexican Federal Police]] arrived at the scene along with the [[Tamaulipas State Police]] and municipal police officers. Onlookers arrived at the scene to observe the aftermath hours later. Investigators discovered that Garcia's corpse was holding a grenade in his hand. Officials stated that Garcia was holding the grenade because he intended to use it against his attackers.<ref name=\":1\" /> Guerrero Reyes was wearing a grenade as a necklace.<ref name=\"hmakT\" />{{Sfn|Grayson|2017|p=90}} Matamoros fire fighters and bomb specialists were called to the scene to remove the grenades from Garcia's hand and from Guerrero Reyes' corpse.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> They were able to remove it without causing a detonation, but it took them around eight hours to defuse Guerrero Reyes's grenade.{{Sfn|Grayson|2017|p=90}} The vehicle Guerrero Reyes was in was hit over 100 times with automatic and semi-automatic firearms. Several of the bullets were fired through the windshield. Inside the vehicle, the police found two handguns and a machine gun. The vehicle was sent to the Tamaulipas State Police headquarters in southern Matamoros for further investigation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nNear the crime scene, the police arrested Jos\u00e9 Jes\u00fas Quintanilla (aged 19). He was driving a white Ford Mustang that authorities suspected was used by the shooters as a getaway vehicle. The vehicle was also taken to the state police headquarters along with the one driven by the victims. A police officer identified Quintanilla as a local customs broker; authorities did not reveal what charges he was arrested for, but they did confirm that he was captured for driving the vehicle that was presumably used by the assassins.<ref name=\":1\" /> It was later revealed that Guerrero Reyes was killed by four unidentified hitmen who carried out the attack in a white taxi.{{Sfn|Grayson|2010|p=185}} The motive behind the attack was not revealed, and state police chief [[Arturo Pedroza Aguirre]] said it was too early to determine if a drug cartel was involved. However,  Mexican investigators not authorized to speak with the press stated that it was organized crime-related. U.S. and Mexican authorities did not confirm if the attack was carried out by the Gulf Cartel or conducted by a rival gang which had sprung up in high numbers after the arrest of C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n.<ref name=\":1\" /> Guerrero Reyes's code name Z-5 was  vacated after his death and taken by Zetas member [[Braulio Arellano Dom\u00ednguez]], who initially held the code name Z-20.{{Sfn|Marley|2019|p=281-282}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Mexican Drug War]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sedena.gob.mx/leytrans/petic/2005/may/23052005a.html|title=Ley de Transparencia: Luis Alberto Guerrero Reyes|last=|first=|date=23 May 2005|website=|publisher=[[Secretariat of National Defense (Mexico)|Secretariat of National Defense]]|language=Spanish|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112175256/http://www.sedena.gob.mx/leytrans/petic/2005/may/23052005a.html|archive-date=12 November 2013|access-date=}}</ref>\n<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/229980.los-soldados-que-trajeron-el-caos.html|title=Los soldados que trajeron el caos|last=|first=|date=11 August 2006|work=El Siglo de Torre\u00f3n|access-date=|url-status=live|language=Spanish|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191227003510/https://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/229980.los-soldados-que-trajeron-el-caos.html|archive-date=27 December 2019}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"J7SAr\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.proceso.com.mx/96827/entrenados-para-delinquir|title=Entrenados\u2026 para delinquir|last=|first=|date=18 December 2005|work=[[Proceso (magazine)|Proceso]]|access-date=|language=Spanish|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190922024453/https://www.proceso.com.mx/96827/entrenados-para-delinquir|archive-date=22 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"uEEHl\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.estadomayor.mx/42792|title=La franquicia paramilitar se desmorona|last=Veled\u00edaz|first=Juan|date=15 May 2014|work=Estado Mayor|access-date=|language=Spanish|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190928214155/https://www.estadomayor.mx/42792|archivedate=28 September 2019}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"c9Inm\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.proceso.com.mx/190869/el-sofisticado-ejercito-del-narco|title=El sofisticado ej\u00e9rcito del narco|last=|first=|date=18 January 2004|work=[[Proceso (magazine)|Proceso]]|access-date=|language=Spanish|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190410201823/https://www.proceso.com.mx/190869/el-sofisticado-ejercito-del-narco|archive-date=10 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"cnnmex\">{{cite news|url=http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2011/07/05/el-origen-de-los-zetas-brazo-armado-del-cartel-del-golfo|title=El origen de 'Los Zetas': brazo armado del c\u00e1rtel del Golfo|date=5 July 2011|newspaper=CNNM\u00e9xico|accessdate=13 February 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EPd82OuM?url=http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2011/07/05/el-origen-de-los-zetas-brazo-armado-del-cartel-del-golfo|archivedate=13 February 2013|agency=[[Turner Broadcasting System]]|language=Spanish|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"logan\">{{cite web|last=Logan |first=Samuel |title=A Profile of Los Zetas: Mexico's Second Most Powerful Drug Cartel |url=http://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/a-profile-of-los-zetas-mexicos-second-most-powerful-drug-cartel |accessdate=16 July 2012 |publisher=[[Combating Terrorism Center]] |date=16 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826084447/http://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/a-profile-of-los-zetas-mexicos-second-most-powerful-drug-cartel |archivedate=26 August 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"operacionesalias\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.voltairenet.org/article161883.html|title=Las operaciones secretas del c\u00e1rtel del Golfo|last=R\u00e9yez|first=Jos\u00e9|date=31 August 2009|work=Red Voltaire|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710233815/http://www.voltairenet.org/article161883.html|archive-date=10 July 2017|url-status=live|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=https://archivo.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/155188.html|title=Entrenan a 'Zetas' en armas de alto poder|last=Gomez|first=Francisco|date=20 October 2007|work=[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]|access-date=|url-status=live|language=Spanish|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191226233328/https://archivo.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/155188.html|archive-date=26 December 2019}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"procesoz5\">{{cite news|url=https://www.proceso.com.mx/302887/302887-un-gobierno-paralelo-objetivo-de-los-zetas|title=Un gobierno paralelo, el objetivo del gobierno|last=Esquivel|first=J.

He joined the [[Mexican Army]] in 1987, specializing in explosives, martial arts and [[grenade launcher]]s. In 1999, he deserted the military and joined the Gulf Cartel under kingpin [[Osiel C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n]], becoming one of the first members of its newly formed paramilitary wing, Los Zetas. Like Guerrero Reyes, most of the first members of Los Zetas were ex-military. Los Zetas was responsible for providing security services to C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n and carrying out executions on the cartel's behalf.\n\nKnown for his arrogance and violent behavior, Guerrero Reyes was a suspect in multiple murders, including those of his girlfriend and wife. Investigators suspect he was part of the commando group that assassinated kingpin [[Edelio L\u00f3pez Falc\u00f3n]]. Guerrero Reyes was also an instructor to new Zetas members, training them in combat and counter-insurgency. In 2004, he was killed in a drive-by shooting by unknown assailants along with four other people after he left a [[discotheque]] in [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]]. His murder remains unsolved; it is not known if he was killed by his own cartel or by rival gangsters.\n\n==Early life and career==\nGuerrero Reyes joined the [[Mexican Army]] on 1&nbsp;March 1987, as an infantry soldier in the 70th Infantry Battalion.<ref name=\"jOvhq\" /> From 11&nbsp;April to 17&nbsp;June 1989, he served as a paratrooper in the [[Brigada de Fusileros Paracaidistas|Parachute Rifle Brigade]] (BFP).<ref name=\":0\" />{{Sfn|Grayson|2017|p=225}} In the BFP, he became a specialist in explosives, martial arts and [[grenade launcher]]s.{{Sfn|Grayson|2017|p=225}} Guerrero Reyes was promoted to the rank of corporal in the infantry division on 1&nbsp;November 1990 and was assigned to lead a small squadron of five soldiers.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> On 1&nbsp;March 1992, he was promoted to second degree sergeant.<ref name=\":0\" /> Guerrero Reyes reportedly received military and counter-drug training in the United States.<ref name=\"J7SAr\" /> In addition to the BFP, he also received special forces training as a member of the elite [[Cuerpo de Fuerzas Especiales|Grupo Aerom\u00f3vil de Fuerzas Especiales]] (GAFE).{{efn|When Guerrero Reyes joined the BFP, it was one of the elite branches of the military along with [[Cuerpo de Fuerzas Especiales|Grupo Aerom\u00f3vil de Fuerzas Especiales]] (GAFE).<ref name=\":5\" />}}<ref name=\"qkLol\"/> In addition to his military duties, he was also assigned to work temporarily in the National Counter-Narcotics Institute (INCD).<ref name=\"uEEHl\" /> He deserted from the military on 4&nbsp;January 1999.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter this, Guerrero Reyes joined the [[Gulf Cartel]], a criminal group based in [[Tamaulipas]].<ref name=\"c9Inm\" /><ref name=\"PVepP\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.insightcrime.org/mexico-organized-crime-news/gulf-cartel-profile/|title=Gulf Cartel|last=|first=|date=30 January 2020|website=|publisher=[[InSight Crime]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200401151723/https://www.insightcrime.org/mexico-organized-crime-news/gulf-cartel-profile/|archive-date=1 April 2020|access-date=}}</ref> He became a member of the cartel's newly created paramilitary group known as [[Los Zetas]], which was largely composed of ex-commandos.{{sfn|Ravelo|2007|p=255-258}} He was hired to work for the cartel boss [[Osiel C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n]], and was assigned under Zetas leader [[Arturo Guzm\u00e1n Decena]] (\"Z-1\").<ref name=\"cnnmex\" /> When Guerrero Reyes joined Los Zetas, the group's purpose was to provide security services to C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n and carry out executions on the cartel's behalf. Over the years, Los Zetas underwent organizational changes and became increasingly involved in other criminal activities alongside the Gulf Cartel, including drug trafficking.<ref name=\"logan\" /> With the collaboration of several Gulf Cartel and Zetas members,{{efn|The Gulf Cartel members were: Sergio Garza Garza (\"El Pollo\"), Rogelio Garc\u00eda Garc\u00eda (\"El Roger\") and [[Jorge Eduardo Costilla S\u00e1nchez]] (\"El Coss\").

He also taught how to conduct ambushes, rapid deployments, prisoner rescues, counter-insurgencies, intelligence gathering, marksmanship, aerial assault tactics, surveillance, and advanced communication techniques. The course included an art of intimidation class and rigorous physical fitness tests.{{Sfn|Grayson|2017|p=47}} The training program lasted about a month.<ref name=\":4\" /> These sessions in Matamoros lasted until September 2001, when C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n ordered them to be moved to Nuevo Le\u00f3n and other parts of Tamaulipas.<ref name=\"83uTZ\" />\n\nGuerrero Reyes was also reportedly responsible for participating in two prison breaks in Tamaulipas and [[Michoac\u00e1n]].<ref name=\"hmakT\" /> The first one occurred in Matamoros on 27&nbsp;December 2002, when approximately fifty Zetas members stormed the [[Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 3]] (\"Noroeste\") and released four inmates linked to the Gulf Cartel.<ref name=\"B4KJM\" /> Investigators stated that the Zetas went into the prison dressed in police uniforms and driving vehicles similar to those from the Army.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\"0rXJe\" /> Once inside the prison, they identified themselves as federal officers and showed the prison staff a forged document ordering the release of four individuals.

Guerrero Reyes was wanted by the PGR, the [[Secretariat of National Defense (Mexico)|Secretariat of National Defense]] (SEDENA) and the [[Secretariat of Public Security]] (SSP) for his outstanding charges.<ref name=\"xrtMw\" /><ref name=\"B4KJM\" />\n\nKnown for his arrogance and violent behavior, Guerrero Reyes had an arrest warrant issued for his suspected involvement in multiple killings from 12&nbsp;February to 10&nbsp;March 2003.{{Sfn|Grayson|2017|p=225}}<ref name=\":3\" /> He was suspected of killing his girlfriend Erica Edith Gonz\u00e1lez, who was found dead in the rural community of La Venada along with two other people, and of his wife Jovanna Lizbeth Melchor Ceballos, who was killed with another man.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> According to the PGR and SEDENA, Guerrero Reyes was also a main suspect in the murder of kingpin [[Edelio L\u00f3pez Falc\u00f3n]] (\"El Yeyo\").<ref name=\"woBbP\" /> L\u00f3pez Falc\u00f3n was a former member of the Gulf Cartel, but left to join a rival criminal group after he encountered differences with the cartel after senior cartel member [[Gilberto Garc\u00eda Mena]] was arrested in 2001.

L\u00f3pez Falc\u00f3n was killed inside a restaurant on 6&nbsp;May.<ref name=\"cronicaexmili\" />\n\n== Shootout and death ==\nAt around 4:30&nbsp;a.m. on 10&nbsp;May 2004, Guerrero Reyes was killed by unknown assailants in a drive-by shooting in Matamoros.<ref name=\":3\" /> The attack occurred before dawn near the Wild West discotheque while Guerrero Reyes was inside a silver Jeep Liberty between Michoac\u00e1n and 16&nbsp;de&nbsp;Septiembre streets in Colonia Modelo, an industrial neighborhood.<ref name=\":1\" /> Guerrero Reyes had just left the discotheque and was described by authorities as a regular in strip clubs and night clubs in Matamoros.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"hmakT\" /> Besides Guerrero Reyes, four other people were killed. One of them was Leonardo Garc\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez, a former [[Matamoros Municipal Police]] officer and alleged cartel member. The other victims were female and identified as Perla Lourdes Garc\u00eda Torres, Rosa Isela Purata C\u00e1rdenas and Nancy L\u00f3pez Gonz\u00e1lez.<ref name=\":1\" /> Four of them died at the scene, but the last one was taken alive to the [[Dr. Alfredo Pumarejo Hospital]], where she eventually succumbed to her wounds.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> The victims' ages and addresses were not revealed to the press.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nNeighbors and witnesses stated that the shootout lasted between three and five minutes. One resident stated that at first he thought the noise was caused by the muffler of a vehicle, but as the attack progressed, he realized it was a shootout. The [[Federal Police (Mexico)|Mexican Federal Police]] arrived at the scene along with the [[Tamaulipas State Police]] and municipal police officers. Onlookers arrived at the scene to observe the aftermath hours later. Investigators discovered that Garcia's corpse was holding a grenade in his hand. Officials stated that Garcia was holding the grenade because he intended to use it against his attackers.<ref name=\":1\" /> Guerrero Reyes was wearing a grenade as a necklace.<ref name=\"hmakT\" />{{Sfn|Grayson|2017|p=90}} Matamoros fire fighters and bomb specialists were called to the scene to remove the grenades from Garcia's hand and from Guerrero Reyes' corpse.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> They were able to remove it without causing a detonation, but it took them around eight hours to defuse Guerrero Reyes's grenade.{{Sfn|Grayson|2017|p=90}} The vehicle Guerrero Reyes was in was hit over 100 times with automatic and semi-automatic firearms. Several of the bullets were fired through the windshield. Inside the vehicle, the police found two handguns and a machine gun. The vehicle was sent to the Tamaulipas State Police headquarters in southern Matamoros for further investigation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nNear the crime scene, the police arrested Jos\u00e9 Jes\u00fas Quintanilla (aged 19). He was driving a white Ford Mustang that authorities suspected was used by the shooters as a getaway vehicle. The vehicle was also taken to the state police headquarters along with the one driven by the victims.

Beaker pottery appears in the [[Mount Pleasant Phase]] (2700\u20132000 BC), along with flat axes and the burial practice of [[inhumation]]. People of this period were also responsible for building [[Seahenge]] along with the later phases of [[Stonehenge]].\n\nMovement of Europeans brought new people to the islands from the continent. Recent tooth enamel isotope research on bodies found in early Bronze Age graves around Stonehenge indicates that at least some of the new arrivals came from the area of modern [[Switzerland]]. The Beaker culture displayed different behaviours from the earlier [[Neolithic]] people and cultural change was significant. Integration is thought to have been peaceful, as many of the early [[henge]] sites were seemingly adopted by the newcomers.\n\nAlso, the burial of dead (which until this period had usually been communal) became more individual. For example, in the Neolithic era, a large [[chambered cairn]] or [[long barrow]] was used to house the dead. The 'Early Bronze Age' saw people buried in individual [[tumulus|barrows]] (also commonly known and marked on modern British [[Ordnance Survey]] maps as tumuli), or sometimes in [[cist]]s covered with [[cairn]]s. They were often buried with a [[Beaker (archaeology)|beaker]] alongside the body.\n\nThere has been debate amongst archaeologists as to whether the \"Beaker people\" were a race of people who migrated to Britain ''en masse'' from the continent, or whether a Beaker cultural \"package\" of goods and behaviour (which eventually spread across most of Western Europe) diffused to Britain's existing inhabitants through trade across tribal boundaries. The former seems incontestable now since a 2017 study showed a major genetic shift in late Neolithic/early Bronze Age Britain, so that more than 90% of Britain's Neolithic gene pool was replaced with the coming of a people genetically similar to the Beaker people of the lower-Rhine area.<ref>{{cite biorxiv |last=Olalde|first=I\u00f1igo  |display-authors=etal |year=2017 |title=The Beaker Phenomenon And The Genomic Transformation Of Northwest Europe |biorxiv=135962}}</ref>\n\n\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 bronze \u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 \n[[File:British Museum gold thing 501594 fh000035.jpg|thumb|The [[Mold Cape]] is unique among survivals]] \n[[File:Brit Mus 17sept 052-crop.jpg|thumb|120px|The massive bronze [[Oxborough Dirk]] is too large to use]] \nSeveral regions of origin have been postulated for the [[Beaker culture]], notably the Iberian peninsula, the Netherlands and Central Europe.<ref>[https://www.worldcat.org/title/interpreting-the-beaker-phenomenon-in-mediterranean-france-an-iron-age-analogy/oclc/789660090&referer=brief_results Lemercier (2012) \"Interpreting the Beaker phenomenon in Mediterranean France : an Iron Age analogy\", p. 131]</ref> Part of the Beaker culture brought the skill of refining [[metal]] to Great Britain.

With this discovery, the [[Bronze Age]] began in Great Britain. Over the next thousand years, bronze gradually replaced stone as the main material for tool and weapon making.\n\nThe bronze axehead, made by [[casting]], was at first similar to its stone predecessors but then developed a socket for the wooden handle to fit into, and a small loop or ring to make lashing the two together easier. Groups of unused axes are often found together, suggesting ritual deposits to some, though many archaeologists believe that elite groups collected bronze items, perhaps restricting their use among the wider population.  Bronze swords of a graceful \"leaf\" shape, swelling gently from the handle before coming to a tip, have been found in considerable numbers, along with spear heads and arrow points.\n\nGreat Britain had large reserves of tin in the areas of [[Cornwall]] and [[Devon]] in what is now Southwest England, and thus tin [[mining]] began. By around 1600 BC, the southwest of the island was experiencing a trade boom as British tin was exported across Europe.\n\nBronze-age Britons were also skilled at [[Gold working in the Bronze Age British Isles|making jewellery from gold]], as well as occasional objects like the [[Rillaton Cup]] and [[Mold Cape]].

{"title_page": "Addled Parliament", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n{{EngvarB|date=August 2019}}\n\n{{Parliaments of England 1601}}\n\nThe '''Parliament of 1614''' was the second [[Parliament of England]] of the reign of [[James VI and I]], which sat between 5 April and 7 June 1614. Lasting only two months, it saw no bills pass and was not even regarded as a Parliament by its contemporaries. However, for this legislative failure it has been known to posterity as the '''Addled Parliament'''.\n\nJames had struggled with debt ever since he came to the English throne. The failure of the [[Blessed Parliament]] of 1604\u20131610 to, in its six-year sitting, rescue the king from his mounting debt or allow James to unite his two kingdoms, had left him bitter with the body. The four-year hiatus between Parliaments saw the royal debt and deficit grow further, despite the best efforts of [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]] [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]. The failure of the last and most lucrative financial expedient of this period, a foreign [[dowry]] from the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], finally convinced James to recall Parliament in early 1614.\n\nThe Parliament got off to a bad start, with poor choices made for the king's representatives in Parliament. Rumours of conspiracy to manage (the \"undertaking\") or pack the Parliament for the king, though not based in fact, spread quickly. The spreading of this rumour, and the ultimate failure of Parliament, has been generally attributed to the scheming of the [[crypto-Catholic]] [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]], though this allegation has met with some recent skepticism. Parliament opened on 5 April and, despite the king's wishes it would be a \"Parliament of Love\", flung itself immediately into the controversy over the conspiracies, splitting parliament and leading to the exclusion of one alleged packer. However, by late April, Parliament had moved on to a familiar controversy, that of [[impositions]]. [[House of Commons of England|The Commons]] were pitted against [[House of Lords of England|the Lords]], culminating in a controversy over an unrestrained speech by one prelate.\n\nJames grew impatient with the Parliamentary proceedings. He issued an ultimatum to Parliament, but they treated it irreverently. Insult was added to injury by belligerent, and supposedly threatening, attacks on him from the Commons. On the advice of Northampton, James dissolved Parliament on 7 June, and had 4 [[MP (UK)|MP]]s sent to the [[Tower of London]]. James devised new financial expedients to settle his still-growing debt, to little success. [[Historiographically]], historians are divided between the [[Whig history|Whiggish]] view of the Parliament as anticipating the constitutional disputes of future Parliaments, and the [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] view of it as a conflict primarily concerned with James's finances.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|James VI and I|Blessed Parliament}}\n[[File:King James I of England and VI of Scotland in Parliament by Renold or Reginold Elstrack (Elstracke).jpg|left|thumb|King James I at the [[Blessed Parliament]] on 5 November 1605.]]\nJames VI and I (1566\u20141625) ascended to the [[List of Scottish monarchs|Scottish throne]] on 24 July 1567, and subsequently to the [[List of English monarchs|English and Irish throne]] on 24 March 1603, becoming [[Union of the Crowns|the first king of to reign over both kingdoms]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} James inherited, with the latter throne, a national debt to the amount of \u00a3300,000, a sum that only increased during his reign. By 1608, it stood at \u00a31 million. During his predecessor [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s reign, the inward revenue of the crown had steadily fallen; taxes from customs and land were consistently undervalued and the parliamentary subsidies steadily shrank.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It did not help that James reigned as \"one of the most extravagant kings\" in English history.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} In peace, Elizabeth's yearly expenditure never rose above \u00a3300,000; almost immediately after James took the throne, it was at \u00a3400,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} James had instituted various extra-parliamentary plans to recuperate this lost income, but these drew controversy from Parliament, and James still wanted for money.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} Moreover, James was keen to not be \"a husband to two wives\" as king, and to unite his crowns as one kingdom of [[Great Britain]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} urging for \"one king, one people, and one law\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}{{efn|In James's original Latinism: \"{{lang|la|Unus Rex}} [...] {{lang|la|Unus Grex}} and {{lang|la|Una Lex}}\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}}} The first parliament of his reign, also known as the Blessed Parliament, was called in 1604; it took seven years, five sessions, to dissolve,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} ending unsatisfactorily for both king and Parliament.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In the first session, many members feared James's unification would lead to the dissolution of the English [[Common Law]] system. Though many prominent politicians publicly praised the idea of unification and MPs accepted a commission to investigate the union early in the Parliament, James's proposed title of the \"king of Great Britain\" was rejected outright.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} Between the first and second sessions, in October 1604, James assumed the title of king of Great Britain by proclamation, controversially circumventing parliament. Unification was not brought up at the second session, to ease outrage,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but by the end of the third session, unification faced such criticism from MPs that it was practically dead.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It was quietly dropped from discussion in the fourth and fifth sessions.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}\n\n[[File:John de Critz Robert Cecil Earl of Salisbury c 1608.png||thumb|[[Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury]] depicted with the white staff of a [[Lord High Treasurer]]. Though a skilled treasurer, Salisbury was unable to significantly reduce the Crown's crippling debt before his death.]]\n\nDuring the Blessed Parliament, Parliament's own aims saw similar disappointment; James rebuffed the proposed institution of Puritan ecclesiastical reforms,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} and failed to address two unpopular royal rights, [[purveyance]] and [[wardship]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{efn|According to Andrew Thrush of [[The History of Parliament]]: \"Purveyance was the right of the Crown to take up provisions for the royal household at below the market rate, while wardship was the right of the Crown to manage the estates of minors whose lands were held of the king.\"{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}}} In the second session, Parliament granted the king a subsidy of between \u00a3400,000, keen to exhibit royal support in the wake of the Gunpowder Plot,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but thanks to the reduction of these subsidies under Elizabeth, this was rather less than the king desired.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} After a 3-year delay between sessions due to plague, the fourth session was called in February 1610, and was dominated by financial discussion. [[Lord High Treasurer]], [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]] proposed the [[Great Contract]]: a financial plan wherein Parliament would grant the Crown \u00a3600,000 immediately (to pay off its debts) and an annual stipend of \u00a3200,000 thereafter; in return, the king was to abolish ten feudal dues, among them, purveyance. After much haggling, in which wardship was added to the abolished dues, the session adjourned on a supportive note. However, when the next session began, support had cooled. Parliament refused to give an annual stipend unless James abolished [[impositions]] as well.{{efn|Impositions were bringing James \u00a370,000 annually, a sum which would only expand with the growth of trade in England.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} By the 1630s, they were bringing the king \u00a3218,000 a year.{{sfn|Russell|1990|p=39}}}} Parliament did give the king an immediate subsidy, but the proposed \u00a3600,000 was reduced to a mere \u00a3100,000. By 6 November 1610, James demanded the other \u00a3500,000 and conditioned that, if impositions were to be abolished, Parliament would have to supply him with another equally lucrative income source. Parliament were outraged, and the Contract was abandoned three days later. Though both Salisbury and James made conciliatory gestures in hope of securing at least some more funds, James grew impatient, and proclaimed the dissolution of the Parliament on 31 December.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} James's first parliament ended on a bitter note; \"your greatest error\", he chastised Salisbury, \"hath been that ye ever expected to draw honey out of gall.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=80}}\n\nAfter this, James was not keen to call another Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} However, without Parliament to raise taxes, the treasury was forced to find new ways to raise money.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In 1611, the City of London loaned the Crown \u00a3100,000; \u00a360,000 was extracted from [[Louis XIII of France|the King of France]] over debts accumulated in the reign of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]; [[Honour#Awards|honours]] were sold to wealthy gentlemen, raising \u00a390,000; a forced loan was levied on nearly 10,000 people.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|pp=148\u2013149}} Yet, after the death of Treasurer Salisbury in 1612, England's finances still remained destitute, with a debt of \u00a3500,000 and annual [[Deficit spending|deficit]] of \u00a3160,000.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|p=149}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=10}} However, James's principal fiscal expedient was to be the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry, Prince of Wales]], for which he expected a sizeable [[dowry]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} not to mention a foreign ally.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=84}} James went into talks with several Catholic countries but, in late 1612, aged 18, Henry contracted [[typhoid]] and abruptly died;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=85}} [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]], newly heir-apparent at age 12, took his place in the negotiations. Negotiations were going most promisingly in France, where a marriage of Prince Charles to the 6-year-old Princess [[Christine of France]] promised a healthy sum of \u00a3240,000, almost halving James's debt.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} However, by early 1614, France's internal religious strife had intensified to such a point that civil war seemed imminent, so negotiations stalled on the French side; James grew impatient.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James's financial insecurity had only worsened in this time, the debt now at \u00a3680,000 and the deficit, \u00a3200,000.{{sfn|Roberts|1985|p=7}} Conspicuous consumption had raised yearly expenditure to an unsustainable \u00a3522,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|pp=98-99}} A group of advisors, led by the [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Earls of Suffolk]] and [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]], encouraged the king to call a Parliament to raise funds, convincing James \"that\"\u2014as he later put it\u2014\"my subjects did not hate me, which I know I had not deserved.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Northampton stringently opposed the summoning,{{sfn|Cramsie|2002|p=135}} but, reluctantly, in 1614, James summoned another parliament. [[Writs of election]] were issued on 19 February that year.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\n==Parliament==\n\n===Prologue===\n[[File:Randolph Crewe by Peter Lely.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ranulph Crewe]], [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]] for the Addled Parliament. Crewe was a surprising choice for Speaker, a last minute pick with little previous experience.]]\n\nThe Privy Council as a whole was not optimistic about the upcoming parliament. Two of the king's closest advisors were unavailable, the Earls of Salisbury was dead and Northampton was ill.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Even Suffolk and Pembroke were clueless of any way to prevent Parliament from bringing up thorny issues such as impositions again.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} However, two Councillors were to provide advice to the king over his new parliament, which would prove significant.{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Sir Francis Bacon]], who had been among the most vocal in favour of calling Parliament, blamed Salisbury entirely for the failure of the previous Parliament, privately holding the treasurer had undermine his early career. He asserted that Salisbury's deal-making had been the king's downfall, and that the king should approach Parliament as a king, rather than a merchant, and request subsidies on the basis of the Commons' good will.{{sfn|Willson|1967|pp=344-345}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|pp=251-252}} Bacon added to this that the king should employ patronage to win over the men of Parliament to his side.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=489}} [[Sir Henry Neville (died 1615)|Sir Henry Neville]] offered advice to the king on how to warm relations with Parliament, which he accepted amiably.{{sfn|Thrush|2010c}} But Neville's more portentous offer was that of an \"undertaking\", whereby Neville and a group of \"patriots\" would arrange to manage the Parliament in James's favour, in return for the office of Secretary of State.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} James rejected the undertaking derisively, and no such conspiracy was ever arranged,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} but rumours of its actual occurrence spread quickly in the lead up to Parliament.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=491}}\n\nMPs later accused James of trying to [[wikt:pack#Verb|pack]] the Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=52}} Indeed, Bacon had plainly advised the king on the \"placing of persons well-affected and discreet\" in Parliament,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=221-222}} and James was unapologetic in packing the Irish Parliament the previous year.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93}}{{efn|James attempted to pack the Irish Parliament of 1613 with Protestants by adding a 84 new seats to the former 148 that election: 38 represented tiny or as-yet nonexistent settlements in the Protestant [[Ulster plantation]]. The election came out with a Protestant majority of 32. James insisted he was within his royal right in doing this and mocked the Parliament's grievances.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93, 148}}}} A large number of Crown officials found themselves in this Parliament,{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} four Privy Councillors found themselves in the Commons, alongside plenty of Crown lawyers.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=222-223}} Though there is no evidence that the Crown sought to pack Parliament with easily controlled and pacified MPs, James certainly promoted the election of those sympathetic to the crown.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} However, there is more evidence of an apathy towards this Parliament from the [[Privy Council]]: few of the expected preparations were made.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} After some Byzantine wrangling in which another better-qualified candidate was dropped, [[Ranulph Crewe]], MP for the [[rotten borough|government-controlled borough]] of [[Saltash (UK Parliament constituency)|Saltash]], was chosen at the last minute to be the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]].{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=41-42}} This was a surprising choice: Crewe's previous experience in Parliament was limited to a short stint as an MP in 1597-98 and an appearance on two minor legal counsels, his legal career was no more impressive.{{sfn|Hunneyball|2010}} Crewe's inexperience precipitated the disorder that Parliament would quickly descend into.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=169}} James's most senior representative in the House of Commons, [[Ralph Winwood]], [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]], was announced similarly late. Though an spirited official and zealous Puritan, Winwood had no parliamentary experience at all and was a terse, unlikable figure.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=345}} The new House of Commons as a whole was not especially inexperienced,{{efn|61% (281 out of 464) of the members had never sat in Parliament before, a little above the Elizabethan average of 50%, but perfectly reasonable given the decade interval between elections.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}}} but it was the inexperience of his most important officials and advisors that was to damage the king.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}\n\n===Opening: Rumours and conspiracy===\n[[File:Henry Neville 1599.jpg|right|thumb|The first six weeks of Parliament were marked by the suspicion of an \"undertaking\", headed by Sir [[Henry Neville (died 1615)|Henry Neville]].]]\nParliament opened on 5 April 1614.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James opened the Parliament with the wish that it would come to be known as the \"Parliament of Love\", and that king and Parliament would go on in harmony and understanding.{{sfn|Mondi|2007|p=153}} His opening speech was divided into three sections: the first ({{lang|la|bona animi}}), decrying the growth of Catholicism and imploring the harsher enforcement of existing laws;{{efn|According to Thomas L. Moir, this aspect of James's speech \"displayed one of those flashes of visions which occasionally revealed his intellectual capacity.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=81}} Rather than demand the institution of new anti-Catholic legislature, James contended that persecution only aided the Catholic cause, and that, as Protestantism was correct, it could reject Catholicism for its own fallacies. Such an ostensibly tolerant doctrine was a novelty in James's time.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=81}}}} the second ({{lang|la|bona corporis}}), assuring parliament of the security of the [[Stuart dynasty]]; and the third ({{lang|la|bona fortunae}}), stating his financial necessity, and his aim not to bargain with Parliament any longer, but ask of their good will.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=226}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=80-82}} All but the religious aspect of this speech bore the unmistakable stamp of Bacon's influence.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=82}} Notably missing from the speech was any promise of compromise or reformation from the king.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=346}} In the same speech, he stringently denied any sanction of Neville's undertaking,{{sfn|Mondi|2007|p=153}} but speculation on the conspiracy was already widespread.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Neville's plan had, by now, been twisted into a far-reaching conspiracy of the king's court.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=346}} English diplomat Sir [[Thomas Roe]] was the first to allege that the rumours were promulgated by the Earl of Northampton's crypto-Catholic faction, who wanted the king to instead look for funds in a [[marital alliance]] with the Catholic Spain, thus favouring parliament's failure.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=491}} That Northampton masterminded many of the factors in the failure of this Parliament, is a hypothesis that has been accepted by most later historians,{{sfn|Peck|1981|loc=p. 533: \"Northampton was accused by some contemporaries and most later historians of engineering the abrupt dissolution of the Addled Parliament in 1614\"}} but has met with the notable rejection of Northampton's biographer, [[Linda Levy Peck]].{{sfn|Peck|1981|loc=p. 535: \"Secondly, the one thing that every schoolboy knows about Northampton - that he destroyed the Addled Parliament of 1614 - might be questioned\"}}\n\nSuspicions only compounded as Parliament proceeded, with the revelation that the king had corresponded with influential subjects in the hopes of securing the election of the sympathetic.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=346}} The House of Commons was divided between those who accepted the conspiracy and those who rejected it.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Commons thus immediately set about investigating the preceding elections for signs of misconduct.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}} Though little more was established, it was found that [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]], Sir [[Thomas Parry (ambassador)|Thomas Parry]] had swayed the election in [[Stockbridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Stockbridge]]. For a brief period, this investigation dominated the Commons: Parry was suspended from the House and, passingly, from his Chancellorship. For many in parliament, this seemed evidence enough that the king's officials had attempted to pack Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}}{{sfn|Seddon|2008}} Simultaneously, a [[Parliamentary committees of the United Kingdom|committee]] to inquire into the alleged undertaking was launched, though this proved less fruitful. The committee's chairman returned on 2 May; he spoke confusingly, but concluded against the existence of any undertaking. However, Parliamentary provocateur [[John Hoskins (poet)|John Hoskins]] demanded further investigation, which the House accepted.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} On 14 May, the inquiry ended; after six weeks of Parliament, rumours of an undertaking had finally been dismissed.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} By the end, resentment against the undertakers had dissipated, and Neville was never suspended for his part, but rather met with commendation from Parliament in his efforts to remedy its grievances.

After five days of debate, the Lords returned with their formal refusal of such a conference, meeting with the astonishment of many.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} The Lords had voted 39 to 30 against it, carried by the near unanimity of the Bishops against this conference.{{efn|Out of the 17 [[prelates]] who voted, all but one opposed the conference, namely the old-fashioned [[Archbishop of York]], [[Tobias Matthew]].{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}}}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}} [[Lord Spiritual]] [[Richard Neile]], who was one of the most vocal opponents of the conference,{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=116-117}} added insult to injury with a sharp speech condemning the petitioners.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}} The remarks made in this speech, known as the \"{{lang|la|Noli me tangere}} speech\", have been described by one historian as \"the most dangerous words used in the reign [of James I] by any politician.\"{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=228}} The Commons refused to conduct any more business until Neile had been punished for this affront.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Though the Commons received a tearful apology and retraction from the Bishop on 30 May, they were unsatisfied, and doubled down on their demands of disciplinary action.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=130-131}} By the end of May, as Moir put it, \"the temper of the Commons had reached a fever pitch\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=132}} and leadership had broke down in this intractable atmosphere.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=132-133}} No punishment for Neile, however, ever materialised, and the king was growing impatient with Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\n===Finale: James grows impatient===\n[[File:Henry Howard Earl of Northampton circle of Gheeraerts.JPG|right|thumb|[[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton]]'s wishes were finally fulfilled on his deathbed, as James dissolved Parliament and looked for Spanish support.]]\n\nParliament was adjourned on 1 June for [[Ascension Day]], reconvening again on 3 June.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} When the Commons met on this day, they received an ultimatum from the king: unless Parliament agreed to grant him a financial supply soon, he would dissolve Parliament on 9 June.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=136}} James expected this to shock the Commons into pursuing his aims, but instead it only entrenched the opposition further into its obstinancy. Many felt this demand was a bluff; the king was stil deeply in debt, and Parliamentary subsidies still seemed his only way out. Instead of effecting any subsidies, the Commons attacked the king mercilessly. His Court, especially the Scots, were accused of extravagance, suggesting the king would have no need for impositions or subsidies if not for these subjects.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} As one member memorably pronounced, James's courtiers were \"spaniels to the king and wolves to the people\".{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=229}} Possibly encouraged by Northampton,{{efn|According to Moir, Hoskins here \"seems to have been simply the tool of the pro-Spanish [i.e. Northampton's] interests.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} The provocative historical reference was submitted by two of Northampton's lackeys: [[Lionel Sharpe]], [[Sir Charles Cornwallis (diplomat)|Sir Charles Cornwallis]]. Gardiner alleges he was not the most historically learned member, and likely misunderstood the insinuation of the reference. Either way, Hoskins was promised the protection of Northampton (and possibly Somerset) and was perhaps given a \u00a320 bribe.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} This interpretation has been questioned by Peck, who asserts that Hoskyns' misunderstanding of the allusion was \"unlikely\" given his educational background, and Hoskyns was a known opponent of Scottish influence. Thus, in her view: \"it seems more reasonable to view Hoskyns not as the innocent tool or victim of the pro-Spanish interests, but as a member of the Commons who agreed with the idea of sending home the Scots\".{{sfn|Peck|1981|p=550}}}}           Hoskins grimly hinted that the lives of these Scottish courtiers were in danger, alluding to the ethnic massacre of the [[Anjou|Angevins]] in the [[Sicilian Vespers]]; this was communicated to the king as a threat to the life of himself and his closest friends, such that he likely feared himself in danger of assassination.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} One MP, Sir Thomas Roe, was more prescient, if somewhat melodramatic, in his judgement that the impending dissolution would be \"the ending, not only of this, but of all Parliaments\".{{sfn|Thrush|2014}} The Commons issued their own ultimatum to James: if he abolished impositions, \"wherewith the whole kingdom doth groan\", they would give him financial support.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\nHowever, James was in no position to give up such a source of income.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} While the anti-Northampton faction pleaded with the king to [[Prorogation in the United Kingdom|prorogue]] rather than dissolve Parliament, the king visited Northampton on his deathbed. Northampton persuaded the desperate king to dissolve Parliament, and shortly after James contacted the Spanish Ambassador, [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a, 1st Count of Gondomar|the Count of Gondomar]], to be assured of Spain's support. James dissolved Parliament on 7 June 1614. Northampton was finally gratified, seeing the end of the Addled Parliament little more than a week before he died.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} The Parliament had elapsed without any bill being passed with [[royal assent]], and thus was not constitutionally a Parliament.

Lasting only two months, it saw no bills pass and was not even regarded as a Parliament by its contemporaries. However, for this legislative failure it has been known to posterity as the '''Addled Parliament'''.\n\nJames had struggled with debt ever since he came to the English throne. The failure of the [[Blessed Parliament]] of 1604\u20131610 to, in its six-year sitting, rescue the king from his mounting debt or allow James to unite his two kingdoms, had left him bitter with the body. The four-year hiatus between Parliaments saw the royal debt and deficit grow further, despite the best efforts of [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]] [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]. The failure of the last and most lucrative financial expedient of this period, a foreign [[dowry]] from the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], finally convinced James to recall Parliament in early 1614.\n\nThe Parliament got off to a bad start, with poor choices made for the king's representatives in Parliament. Rumours of conspiracy to manage (the \"undertaking\") or pack the Parliament for the king, though not based in fact, spread quickly. The spreading of this rumour, and the ultimate failure of Parliament, has been generally attributed to the scheming of the [[crypto-Catholic]] [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]], though this allegation has met with some recent skepticism. Parliament opened on 5 April and, despite the king's wishes it would be a \"Parliament of Love\", flung itself immediately into the controversy over the conspiracies, splitting parliament and leading to the exclusion of one alleged packer. However, by late April, Parliament had moved on to a familiar controversy, that of [[impositions]]. [[House of Commons of England|The Commons]] were pitted against [[House of Lords of England|the Lords]], culminating in a controversy over an unrestrained speech by one prelate.\n\nJames grew impatient with the Parliamentary proceedings. He issued an ultimatum to Parliament, but they treated it irreverently. Insult was added to injury by belligerent, and supposedly threatening, attacks on him from the Commons. On the advice of Northampton, James dissolved Parliament on 7 June, and had 4 [[MP (UK)|MP]]s sent to the [[Tower of London]]. James devised new financial expedients to settle his still-growing debt, to little success. [[Historiographically]], historians are divided between the [[Whig history|Whiggish]] view of the Parliament as anticipating the constitutional disputes of future Parliaments, and the [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] view of it as a conflict primarily concerned with James's finances.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|James VI and I|Blessed Parliament}}\n[[File:King James I of England and VI of Scotland in Parliament by Renold or Reginold Elstrack (Elstracke).jpg|left|thumb|King James I at the [[Blessed Parliament]] on 5 November 1605.]]\nJames VI and I (1566\u20141625) ascended to the [[List of Scottish monarchs|Scottish throne]] on 24 July 1567, and subsequently to the [[List of English monarchs|English and Irish throne]] on 24 March 1603, becoming [[Union of the Crowns|the first king of to reign over both kingdoms]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} James inherited, with the latter throne, a national debt to the amount of \u00a3300,000, a sum that only increased during his reign. By 1608, it stood at \u00a31 million. During his predecessor [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s reign, the inward revenue of the crown had steadily fallen; taxes from customs and land were consistently undervalued and the parliamentary subsidies steadily shrank.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It did not help that James reigned as \"one of the most extravagant kings\" in English history.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} In peace, Elizabeth's yearly expenditure never rose above \u00a3300,000; almost immediately after James took the throne, it was at \u00a3400,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} James had instituted various extra-parliamentary plans to recuperate this lost income, but these drew controversy from Parliament, and James still wanted for money.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} Moreover, James was keen to not be \"a husband to two wives\" as king, and to unite his crowns as one kingdom of [[Great Britain]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} urging for \"one king, one people, and one law\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}{{efn|In James's original Latinism: \"{{lang|la|Unus Rex}} [...] {{lang|la|Unus Grex}} and {{lang|la|Una Lex}}\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}}} The first parliament of his reign, also known as the Blessed Parliament, was called in 1604; it took seven years, five sessions, to dissolve,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} ending unsatisfactorily for both king and Parliament.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In the first session, many members feared James's unification would lead to the dissolution of the English [[Common Law]] system. Though many prominent politicians publicly praised the idea of unification and MPs accepted a commission to investigate the union early in the Parliament, James's proposed title of the \"king of Great Britain\" was rejected outright.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} Between the first and second sessions, in October 1604, James assumed the title of king of Great Britain by proclamation, controversially circumventing parliament. Unification was not brought up at the second session, to ease outrage,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but by the end of the third session, unification faced such criticism from MPs that it was practically dead.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It was quietly dropped from discussion in the fourth and fifth sessions.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}\n\n[[File:John de Critz Robert Cecil Earl of Salisbury c 1608.png||thumb|[[Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury]] depicted with the white staff of a [[Lord High Treasurer]]. Though a skilled treasurer, Salisbury was unable to significantly reduce the Crown's crippling debt before his death.]]\n\nDuring the Blessed Parliament, Parliament's own aims saw similar disappointment; James rebuffed the proposed institution of Puritan ecclesiastical reforms,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} and failed to address two unpopular royal rights, [[purveyance]] and [[wardship]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{efn|According to Andrew Thrush of [[The History of Parliament]]: \"Purveyance was the right of the Crown to take up provisions for the royal household at below the market rate, while wardship was the right of the Crown to manage the estates of minors whose lands were held of the king.\"{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}}} In the second session, Parliament granted the king a subsidy of between \u00a3400,000, keen to exhibit royal support in the wake of the Gunpowder Plot,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but thanks to the reduction of these subsidies under Elizabeth, this was rather less than the king desired.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} After a 3-year delay between sessions due to plague, the fourth session was called in February 1610, and was dominated by financial discussion. [[Lord High Treasurer]], [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]] proposed the [[Great Contract]]: a financial plan wherein Parliament would grant the Crown \u00a3600,000 immediately (to pay off its debts) and an annual stipend of \u00a3200,000 thereafter; in return, the king was to abolish ten feudal dues, among them, purveyance. After much haggling, in which wardship was added to the abolished dues, the session adjourned on a supportive note. However, when the next session began, support had cooled. Parliament refused to give an annual stipend unless James abolished [[impositions]] as well.{{efn|Impositions were bringing James \u00a370,000 annually, a sum which would only expand with the growth of trade in England.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} By the 1630s, they were bringing the king \u00a3218,000 a year.{{sfn|Russell|1990|p=39}}}} Parliament did give the king an immediate subsidy, but the proposed \u00a3600,000 was reduced to a mere \u00a3100,000. By 6 November 1610, James demanded the other \u00a3500,000 and conditioned that, if impositions were to be abolished, Parliament would have to supply him with another equally lucrative income source. Parliament were outraged, and the Contract was abandoned three days later. Though both Salisbury and James made conciliatory gestures in hope of securing at least some more funds, James grew impatient, and proclaimed the dissolution of the Parliament on 31 December.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} James's first parliament ended on a bitter note; \"your greatest error\", he chastised Salisbury, \"hath been that ye ever expected to draw honey out of gall.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=80}}\n\nAfter this, James was not keen to call another Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} However, without Parliament to raise taxes, the treasury was forced to find new ways to raise money.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In 1611, the City of London loaned the Crown \u00a3100,000; \u00a360,000 was extracted from [[Louis XIII of France|the King of France]] over debts accumulated in the reign of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]; [[Honour#Awards|honours]] were sold to wealthy gentlemen, raising \u00a390,000; a forced loan was levied on nearly 10,000 people.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|pp=148\u2013149}} Yet, after the death of Treasurer Salisbury in 1612, England's finances still remained destitute, with a debt of \u00a3500,000 and annual [[Deficit spending|deficit]] of \u00a3160,000.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|p=149}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=10}} However, James's principal fiscal expedient was to be the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry, Prince of Wales]], for which he expected a sizeable [[dowry]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} not to mention a foreign ally.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=84}} James went into talks with several Catholic countries but, in late 1612, aged 18, Henry contracted [[typhoid]] and abruptly died;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=85}} [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]], newly heir-apparent at age 12, took his place in the negotiations. Negotiations were going most promisingly in France, where a marriage of Prince Charles to the 6-year-old Princess [[Christine of France]] promised a healthy sum of \u00a3240,000, almost halving James's debt.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} However, by early 1614, France's internal religious strife had intensified to such a point that civil war seemed imminent, so negotiations stalled on the French side; James grew impatient.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James's financial insecurity had only worsened in this time, the debt now at \u00a3680,000 and the deficit, \u00a3200,000.{{sfn|Roberts|1985|p=7}} Conspicuous consumption had raised yearly expenditure to an unsustainable \u00a3522,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|pp=98-99}} A group of advisors, led by the [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Earls of Suffolk]] and [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]], encouraged the king to call a Parliament to raise funds, convincing James \"that\"\u2014as he later put it\u2014\"my subjects did not hate me, which I know I had not deserved.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Northampton stringently opposed the meeting,{{sfn|Cramsie|2002|p=135}} but, reluctantly, James summoned another parliament in 1614.

Crewe was a surprising choice for Speaker, a last minute pick with little previous experience.]]\n\nThe Privy Council as a whole was not optimistic about the upcoming parliament. Two of the king's closest advisors were unavailable, the Earls of Salisbury was dead and Northampton was ill.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Even Suffolk and Pembroke were clueless of any way to prevent Parliament from bringing up thorny issues such as impositions again.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} However, two Councillors were to provide advice to the king over his new parliament, which would prove significant.{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Sir Francis Bacon]], who had been among the most vocal in favour of calling Parliament, blamed Salisbury entirely for the failure of the previous Parliament, privately holding the treasurer had undermine his early career. He asserted that Salisbury's deal-making had been the king's downfall, and that the king should approach Parliament as a king, rather than a merchant, and request subsidies on the basis of the Commons' good will.{{sfn|Willson|1967|pp=344-345}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|pp=251-252}} Bacon added to this that the king should employ patronage to win over the men of Parliament to his side.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=489}} [[Sir Henry Neville (died 1615)|Sir Henry Neville]] offered advice to the king on how to warm relations with Parliament, which he accepted amiably.{{sfn|Thrush|2010c}} But Neville's more portentous offer was that of an \"undertaking\", whereby Neville and a group of \"patriots\" would arrange to manage the Parliament in James's favour, in return for the office of Secretary of State.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} James rejected the undertaking derisively, and no such conspiracy was ever arranged,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} but rumours of its actual occurrence spread quickly in the lead up to Parliament.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=491}}\n\nMPs later accused James of trying to [[wikt:pack#Verb|pack]] the Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=52}} Indeed, Bacon had plainly advised the king on the \"placing of persons well-affected and discreet\" in Parliament,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=221-222}} and James was unapologetic in packing the Irish Parliament the previous year.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93}}{{efn|James attempted to pack the Irish Parliament of 1613 with Protestants by adding a 84 new seats to the former 148 that election: 38 represented tiny or as-yet nonexistent settlements in the Protestant [[Ulster plantation]]. The election came out with a Protestant majority of 32. James insisted he was within his royal right in doing this and mocked the Parliament's grievances.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93, 148}}}} A large number of Crown officials found themselves in this Parliament,{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} four Privy Councillors found themselves in the Commons, alongside plenty of Crown lawyers.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=222-223}} Though there is no evidence that the Crown sought to pack Parliament with easily controlled and pacified MPs, James certainly promoted the election of those sympathetic to the crown.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} However, there is more evidence of an apathy towards this Parliament from the [[Privy Council]]: few of the expected preparations were made.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} After some Byzantine wrangling in which another better-qualified candidate was dropped, [[Ranulph Crewe]], MP for the [[rotten borough|government-controlled borough]] of [[Saltash (UK Parliament constituency)|Saltash]], was chosen at the last minute to be the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]].{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=41-42}} This was a surprising choice: Crewe's previous experience in Parliament was limited to a short stint as an MP in 1597-98 and an appearance on two minor legal counsels, his legal career was no more impressive.{{sfn|Hunneyball|2010}} Crewe's inexperience precipitated the disorder that Parliament would quickly descend into.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=169}} James's most senior representative in the House of Commons, [[Ralph Winwood]], [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]], was announced similarly late. Though an spirited official and zealous Puritan, Winwood had no parliamentary experience at all and was a terse, unlikable figure.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=345}} The new House of Commons as a whole was not especially inexperienced,{{efn|61% (281 out of 464) of the members had never sat in Parliament before, a little above the Elizabethan average of 50%, but perfectly reasonable given the decade interval between elections.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}}} but it was the inexperience of his most important officials and advisors that was to damage the king.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}\n\n===Opening: Rumours and conspiracy===\n[[File:Henry Neville 1599.jpg|right|thumb|The first six weeks of Parliament were marked by the suspicion of an \"undertaking\", headed by Sir [[Henry Neville (died 1615)|Henry Neville]].]]\nParliament opened on 5 April 1614.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James opened the Parliament with the wish that it would come to be known as the \"Parliament of Love\", and that king and Parliament would go on in harmony and understanding.{{sfn|Mondi|2007|p=153}} His opening speech was divided into three sections: the first ({{lang|la|bona animi}}), decrying the growth of Catholicism and imploring the harsher enforcement of existing laws;{{efn|According to Thomas L. Moir, this aspect of James's speech \"displayed one of those flashes of visions which occasionally revealed his intellectual capacity.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=81}} Rather than demand the institution of new anti-Catholic legislature, James contended that persecution only aided the Catholic cause, and that, as Protestantism was correct, it could reject Catholicism for its own fallacies. Such an ostensibly tolerant doctrine was a novelty in James's time.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=81}}}} the second ({{lang|la|bona corporis}}), assuring parliament of the security of the [[Stuart dynasty]]; and the third ({{lang|la|bona fortunae}}), stating his financial necessity, and his aim not to bargain with Parliament any longer, but ask of their good will.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=226}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=80-82}} All but the religious aspect of this speech bore the unmistakable stamp of Bacon's influence.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=82}} Notably missing from the speech was any promise of compromise or reformation from the king.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=346}} In the same speech, he stringently denied any sanction of Neville's undertaking,{{sfn|Mondi|2007|p=153}} but speculation on the conspiracy was already widespread.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Neville's plan had, by now, been twisted into a far-reaching conspiracy of the king's court.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=346}} English diplomat Sir [[Thomas Roe]] was the first to allege that the rumours were promulgated by the Earl of Northampton's crypto-Catholic faction, who wanted the king to instead look for funds in a [[marital alliance]] with the Catholic Spain, thus favouring parliament's failure.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=491}} That Northampton masterminded many of the factors in the failure of this Parliament, is a hypothesis that has been accepted by most later historians,{{sfn|Peck|1981|loc=p. 533: \"Northampton was accused by some contemporaries and most later historians of engineering the abrupt dissolution of the Addled Parliament in 1614\"}} but has met with the notable rejection of Northampton's biographer, [[Linda Levy Peck]].{{sfn|Peck|1981|loc=p. 535: \"Secondly, the one thing that every schoolboy knows about Northampton - that he destroyed the Addled Parliament of 1614 - might be questioned\"}}\n\nSuspicions only compounded as Parliament proceeded, with the revelation that the king had corresponded with influential subjects in the hopes of securing the election of the sympathetic.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=346}} The House of Commons was divided between those who accepted the conspiracy and those who rejected it.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Commons thus immediately set about investigating the preceding elections for signs of misconduct.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}} Though little more was established, it was found that [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]], Sir [[Thomas Parry (ambassador)|Thomas Parry]] had swayed the election in [[Stockbridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Stockbridge]]. For a brief period, this investigation dominated the Commons: Parry was suspended from the House and, passingly, from his Chancellorship. For many in parliament, this seemed evidence enough that the king's officials had attempted to pack Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}}{{sfn|Seddon|2008}} Simultaneously, a [[Parliamentary committees of the United Kingdom|committee]] to inquire into the alleged undertaking was launched, though this proved less fruitful. The committee's chairman returned on 2 May; he spoke confusingly, but concluded against the existence of any undertaking. However, Parliamentary provocateur [[John Hoskins (poet)|John Hoskins]] demanded further investigation, which the House accepted.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} On 14 May, the inquiry ended; after six weeks of Parliament, rumours of an undertaking had finally been dismissed.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} By the end, resentment against the undertakers had dissipated, and Neville was never suspended for his part, but rather met with commendation from Parliament in his efforts to remedy its grievances.

After five days of debate, the Lords returned with their formal refusal of such a conference, meeting with the astonishment of many.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} The Lords had voted 39 to 30 against it, carried by the near unanimity of the Bishops against this conference.{{efn|Out of the 17 [[prelates]] who voted, all but one opposed the conference, namely the old-fashioned [[Archbishop of York]], [[Tobias Matthew]].{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}}}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}} [[Lord Spiritual]] [[Richard Neile]], who was one of the most vocal opponents of the conference,{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=116-117}} added insult to injury with a sharp speech condemning the petitioners.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}} The remarks made in this speech, known as the \"{{lang|la|Noli me tangere}} speech\", have been described by one historian as \"the most dangerous words used in the reign [of James I] by any politician.\"{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=228}} The Commons refused to conduct any more business until Neile had been punished for this affront.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Though the Commons received a tearful apology and retraction from the Bishop on 30 May, they were unsatisfied, and doubled down on their demands of disciplinary action.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=130-131}} By the end of May, as Moir put it, \"the temper of the Commons had reached a fever pitch\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=132}} and leadership had broke down in this intractable atmosphere.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=132-133}} No punishment for Neile, however, ever materialised, and the king was growing impatient with Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\n===Finale: James grows impatient===\n[[File:Henry Howard Earl of Northampton circle of Gheeraerts.JPG|right|thumb|[[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton]]'s wishes were finally fulfilled on his deathbed, as James dissolved Parliament and looked for Spanish support.]]\n\nParliament was adjourned on 1 June for [[Ascension Day]], reconvening again on 3 June.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} When the Commons met on this day, they received an ultimatum from the king: unless Parliament agreed to grant him a financial supply soon, he would dissolve Parliament on 9 June.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=136}} James expected this to shock the Commons into pursuing his aims, but instead it only entrenched the opposition further into its obstinancy. Many felt this demand was a bluff; the king was stil deeply in debt, and Parliamentary subsidies still seemed his only way out. Instead of effecting any subsidies, the Commons attacked the king mercilessly. His Court, especially the Scots, were accused of extravagance, suggesting the king would have no need for impositions or subsidies if not for these subjects.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} As one member memorably pronounced, James's courtiers were \"spaniels to the king and wolves to the people\".{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=229}} Possibly encouraged by Northampton,{{efn|According to Moir, Hoskins here \"seems to have been simply the tool of the pro-Spanish [i.e. Northampton's] interests.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} The provocative historical reference was submitted by two of Northampton's lackeys: [[Lionel Sharpe]], [[Sir Charles Cornwallis (diplomat)|Sir Charles Cornwallis]].

Either way, Hoskins was promised the protection of Northampton (and possibly Somerset) and was perhaps given a \u00a320 bribe.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} This interpretation has been questioned by Peck, who asserts that Hoskyns' misunderstanding of the allusion was \"unlikely\" given his educational background, and Hoskyns was a known opponent of Scottish influence. Thus, in her view: \"it seems more reasonable to view Hoskyns not as the innocent tool or victim of the pro-Spanish interests, but as a member of the Commons who agreed with the idea of sending home the Scots\".{{sfn|Peck|1981|p=550}}}}           Hoskins grimly hinted that the lives of these Scottish courtiers were in danger, alluding to the ethnic massacre of the [[Anjou|Angevins]] in the [[Sicilian Vespers]]; this was communicated to the king as a threat to the life of himself and his closest friends, such that he likely feared himself in danger of assassination.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} One MP, Sir Thomas Roe, was more prescient, if somewhat melodramatic, in his judgement that the impending dissolution would be \"the ending, not only of this, but of all Parliaments\".{{sfn|Thrush|2014}} The Commons issued their own ultimatum to James: if he abolished impositions, \"wherewith the whole kingdom doth groan\", they would give him financial support.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\nHowever, James was in no position to give up such a source of income.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} While the anti-Northampton faction pleaded with the king to [[Prorogation in the United Kingdom|prorogue]] rather than dissolve Parliament, the king visited Northampton on his deathbed. Northampton persuaded the desperate king to dissolve Parliament, and shortly after James contacted the Spanish Ambassador, [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a, 1st Count of Gondomar|the Count of Gondomar]], to be assured of Spain's support.

The same was done for Hoskins's encouragers a few days later.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=146}} Royal favour was extended to the king's supporters in Parliament, even the Speaker, who received a knighthood and a [[Serjeant-at-law|Serjeantry]].{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=148}} Simultaneously, James approached the Spanish Ambassador shortly after Parliament, confiding much in him, especially regarding his lack of confidence with Parliament.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} He reopened negotiations with Spain for a Spanish wife to his heir-apparent, anticipating a dowry of \u00a3600,000, enough to cover almost all his debt.{{sfn|Thrush|2010d}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}}\n\nShortly after the Parliament ended, the Privy Council went into talks of calling another, possibly [[Parliament of Scotland|in Scotland]],{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} but James surmised this break in Parliament would be final.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} Indeed, he would not call another Parliament for seven years. He only raised a [[3rd Parliament of King James I|Parliament in 1621]] as a last resort to raise money for his son-in-law [[Elector Palatine Frederick V]] during the [[Thirty Years' War]].{{sfn|Thrush|2010d}} This interlude was England's longest since 1515.{{sfn|Mondi|2007|p=140}} As one historian has commented, \"had it not been for the outbreak of the Thirty Years\u2019 War in 1618, he might have succeeded in avoiding Parliament for the rest of his reign.\"{{sfn|Thrush|2014}} In the mean time, still heavily in debt, James set about finding other ways to raise money. \"We shall see strange projects for money set on foot, and yet all will not help\", one observer noted.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|pp=158-159}} His financial needs were temporarily sated with a [[benevolence (tax)|benevolence]] asked of his wealthiest subjects in 1614, raising \u00a365,000;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=94}} the sale of the [[Cautionary Towns]] of [[Brielle]] and [[Vlissingen]] to the Dutch in 1616, raising \u00a3250,000;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=95}} and in 1617, the request of a loan of \u00a3100,000 from the [[City of London]] for a Scottish [[Royal entry|Progress]], though the City did not give this in full.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=100}} The deficit was slowly reduced from 1614 to 1618.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=153}} Yet, by 1620, his debt had risen to \u00a3900,000 and no marriage deal had materialised.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}\n\n==Historiography==\n[[File:Portrait of Samuel Rawson Gardiner.jpg|thumb|Victorian historian of James's reign [[Samuel Rawson Gardiner]] concluded that the Addled Parliament saw the \"first dawning\" of certain constitutional ideas in Parliament.]]\n[[Victorian era|Victorian]] Whig historian [[Samuel Rawson Gardiner]], in his monumental history of the lead up to the Civil War, took the view that the Parliament of 1614 was primarily concerned with \"higher questions\", i.e. those a constitutional nature, \"which, once mooted, can never drop out of sight\".{{sfn|Clucas|Davies|2003|p=1}}{{sfn|Gardiner|1883|p=228}} To this Parliament, Gardiner wrote, one can \"trace the first dawning of the idea that, in order to preserve the rights of the subject intact, it would be necessary to make some change in the relations between the authority of the Crown and the representatives of the people.\"{{sfn|Gardiner|1883|p=240}} Gardiner's judgement of the constitutional import of this assembly has met with the sympathy of some later historians.{{sfn|Russell|1990|p=31}} [[Thomas L. Moir]], in his 1958 monograph on the Parliament, saw the \"the development had begun which led ultimately to parliamentary control of the executive\" as early as the exclusion of Parry.{{sfn|Russell|1990|p=31}} As [[Maija Jansson]], editor of the 1614 Parliamentary proceedings, wrote in 1988: \"[f]ar from being the confused do-nothing assembly of tradition, the English parliament of 1614 addressed thorny constitutional issues and anticipated the concern with procedure and privilege that is evident throughout the sessions of the 1620s.\"{{sfn|Jansson|1988|p=1}}\n\nThis hypothesis regarding the Addled Parliament was criticised by the eminent Parliamentary historian [[Conrad Russell]] in his 1991 [[Stenton lecture]]\u2014entitled ''The Addled Parliament of 1614: The Limits of Revision''.{{sfn|Clucas|Davies|2003|p=2}} From Russell's revisionist perspective, the members of Parliament were engaged in a constitutionally conservative battle. The disagreement between Parliament and Crown was not a \"battle between rival constitutional ideas\"{{sfn|Clucas|Davies|2003|p=2}} but, as Russell concluded:\n{{quote|The central disagreement of James's reign was about the true [monetary] cost of government, and James\u2019s central failure was his failure to convince the House of Commons he needed as much as in fact he did. From that single failure, all the constitutional troubles of the reign stemmed.{{sfn|Clucas|Davies|2003|p=2}}}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Parliaments of England]]\n*[[List of MPs elected to the English parliament in 1614]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite book |last1=Clucas |first1=Stephen |last2=Davies |first2=Rosalind |date=2003 |chapter=Introduction |editor1-last=Clucas |editor1-first=Stephen |editor2-last=Davies |editor2-first=Rosalind |title=The Crisis of 1614 and The Addled Parliament: Literary and Historical Perspectives |edition=1st |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |location=Aldershot |isbn=978-0-7546-0681-9 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Crisis_of_1614_and_the_Addled_Parlia.html?id=wVdnAAAAMAAJ |ref=harv }}\n: {{cite book |last=Cramsie |first=John |date=2002 |title=Kingship and Crown Finance under James VI and I, 1603\u20131625 |location=Suffolk |publisher=The Boydell Press |series=[[Royal Historical Society Studies in History]] (New Series) |isbn=978-0-86193-259-7 |ref=harv }}\n: {{cite book |last=Croft |first=Pauline |author-link=Pauline Croft |date=2003 |title=King James |location=Hampshire |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |url=https://archive.org/details/kingjames00crof |url-access=registration |oclc=938114859 |ref=harv }}\n: {{cite book |last=Dietz |first=Frederick C. |date=1964 |title=English Public Finance, 1558\u20131641 |series=English Public Finance, 1485\u20131641 |volume=2 |edition=2nd |publisher=Barnes & Noble, Inc. |location=New York |url=https://archive.org/details/englishpublicfin0002diet |url-access=registration |oclc=22976184 |ref=harv }}\n: {{cite journal |last1=Duncan |first1=Owen |last2=Roberts |first2=Clayton |date=July 1978 |title= The Parliamentary Undertaking of 1614  |journal=[[The English Historical Review]] |volume=93 |issue=238 |pp=481\u2013498  |doi=10.1093/ehr/xciii.ccclxviii.481 |jstor=565464 |ref=harv }} \n: {{cite book |last=Gardiner |first=Samuel R. |date=1883 |title=History of England from the Accession of James I to the Outbreak of the Civil War, 1603\u20131642.
