Fernando di Leo made 17 films as a director and about 50 scripts from 1964 to 1985.{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=292}}\n\n==Biography==\nFernando Di Leo was born on 11 January 1932 in [[San Ferdinando di Puglia]].{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=292}} After briefly working in a Rome's film school [[Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia]], di Leo made his debut as a director as part of the omnibus comedy ''Gli eroi di ieri, oggi, domani'' with his episode titled ''Un posto in paradiso'' ({{translation|A Place in Heaven}}).{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=293}} Following this Di Leo wrote several scripts for Westerns, often uncredited.{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=293}} This included work on ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]''.{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=293}} Some of his Westerns had uncredited literary sources, such as ''[[Days of Vengeance]]'' which as loosely based on [[Alexandre Dumas]]' ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]''.{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=293}}\n\nDi Leo was a fan of ''[[film noir]]'' and wanted to make an Italian version of these films.{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=293}} Among his first efforts was the script for [[Mino Guerrini]]'s ''[[Date for a Murder]]'' based on [[Franco Enna]]'s novel ''Tempo di massacro'' written in 1955.{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=293}} In Di Leo's version, the setting is moved to a contemporary Rome and has elements of contemporary spy films.{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=293}} Di Leo worked with Guerrini again on on the film ''[[Gangsters '70]]'' which did not do well in the box office.{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=293}} Di Leo began directing more of his own films at the time including the [[War film|war film]] ''[[Red Roses for the Fuhrer]]'' and a few erotic films: ''[[A Woman on Fire]]'' and ''[[A Wrong Way to Love]]''.{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=293}} From 1969 to 1976, di Leo was able to produce many of his own works with his production company Duania cineproduzioni 70.{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=292}} He followed this with a return to ''noir'' with ''[[Naked Violence]]'', a film adapting a novel by [[Giorgio Scerbanenco]], a writer who Di Leo would adapt for several future film productions.{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=293}}\n\nDi Leo would make a ''[[giallo]]'' film with ''[[Slaughter Hotel]]'' starring [[Klaus Kinski]] and [[Margaret Lee]].{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=293}} Following this Di Leo worked on ''[[Caliber 9]]'' and ''[[The Italian Connection]]'' which were both inspired by the writing of Scerbanenco.{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=293}} He followed up this film ''[[Il Boss]]'', a film which got Di Leo in trouble with politicians and authorities due he the films display connections between the mafia and the Italy's major party [[Democrazia Cristiana]].{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=293}} Di Leo followed this up with ''[[Shoot First, Die Later]]'' in 1974.{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=293}} Di Leo worked through the latter half of the 1970s directing ''[[Mister Scarface]]'', ''[[Kidnap Syndicate]]'', and ''[[Nick the Sting]]''.{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=294}} He also wrote scripts for other directors such as [[Romolo Guerrieri]]'s ''[[Young, Violent, Dangerous]]'' and [[Ruggero Deodato]]'s ''[[Live Like a Cop, Die Like a Man]]''.{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=294}} Di Leo's last film produced by his company Duania cineproduzioni 70 was ''[[Rulers of the City]]'' in 1976.{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=294}} He continued with a few more films after with the ''film noir'' ''[[Blood and Diamonds]]'', the erotic drama ''[[To Be Twenty]]'' and ''[[Madness (1980 film)|Madness]]'' ins 1980.{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=294}} \n\nDi Leo worked in television in the 1980s, starting with the television series ''[[L'assassino ha le ore contate]]'', which involved six one-hour long made-for-tv films produced by [[RAI Uno]] which as of 2013 are unreleased.{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=294}} Di Leo also made ''The Violent Breed'' and his last film ''[[Killer vs. Killers]]'' towards the mid-1980s.{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=294}} ''Killer vs. Killers'' wasn't released theatrically in Italy and only surfaced 20 years later on DVD.{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=295}} Di Leo died in December 2003.{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=295}}\n\n==Select filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n!

Most patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles use modern [[mechanical ventilation|mechanical ventilators]] that push air into the airway with positive pressure. These are generally efficacious and have the advantage of not restricting patients' movements or caregivers' ability to examine the patients as significantly as an iron lung does.

Most patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles use modern [[mechanical ventilation|mechanical ventilators]] that push air into the airway with positive pressure. These are generally efficacious and have the advantage of not restricting patients' movements or caregivers' ability to examine the patients as significantly as an iron lung does. However, [[wikt:negative pressure|negative pressure]] ventilation is a truer approximation of normal physiological breathing and results in more normal distribution of air in the lungs. It may also be preferable in certain rare conditions, such as [[central hypoventilation syndrome]], in which failure of the medullary respiratory centers at the base of the brain results in patients having no [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic control]] of breathing.

The municipality covers an area of {{convert|{{Dutch municipality total area|Lisse}}|km2|abbr=on}} of which {{convert|{{Dutch municipality water area|Lisse}}|km2|abbr=on}} is water. Its population was {{formatnum:{{Dutch municipality population|Lisse}}}} in {{YEAR|{{Dutch municipality population|popbaseyear}}}}. Located within the municipal boundary is also the community [[De Engel (Lisse)|De Engel]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lisse,_kerk_2007-04-18_13.41.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Church:Sint-Agathakerk]]\n[[File:Molenlisse.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Windmill in Lisse.]]\n\nThe history of Lisse is closely related and similar to the neighboring towns of [[Hillegom]] and [[Sassenheim]]. Based on a document from 1198 which makes official mention of the town's name, Lisse celebrated its 800-year anniversary in 1998, although there is an indication that there was already a settlement there in the 10th century.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Lisse was a small settlement; there were only 50 houses in 1500. Because of prolonged warfare (particularly the wars of [[Charles I, Duke of Burgundy|Charles the Bold]] and the [[Eighty Years' War]]), poverty was prevalent. Its population lived from agriculture, [[animal husbandry]], and [[peat]] harvesting.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, Lisse was, like [[Hillegom]], home to many [[Estate (house)|estate]]s of rich merchants and nobility. The forests and gardens of the [[Keukenhof]], Meerenburg, Wildlust, Zandvliet, Overduin en Akervoorde, Wassergeest, Grotenhof, Ter Specke, Dubbelhoven, Rosendaal, Veenenburg en Berkhout, Middelburg, Ter Beek, and Uytermeer estates all added to the town's beauty and glory.\n\nYet in the following centuries, every one of these estates (except Keukenhof) was removed to make way for the cultivation of [[bulb]] flowers. The sandy soil in Lisse's surroundings were highly suitable for its growth provided the soil was fertilized. The nearby [[dune]]s were excavated and forests cut down progressively over time for more fields for the flower business. This brought employment and prosperity to this area.\n== Floriculture centre ==\n[[File:Gem-Lisse-OpenTopo.jpg|thumb|''Dutch Topographic map of Lisse, June 2015'']]\n[[File:Floriculture centre, Lisse.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A field of tulips in Lisse]]\nIn the 20th century, the bulb flower business continued to boom, resulting in the establishment of auction and trading houses, large-scale cultivators and [[cooperative]]s. Today, Lisse exports bulbflowers in large quantities to over a hundred countries worldwide.\n\nLocated at the centre of the \"Dune and Bulb Region\" ([[Duin- en Bollenstreek]]), Holland's flower-growing region, Lisse is also a major tourist attraction. During the spring when the fields around Lisse are in a colourful bloom, hundreds of thousands of local and foreign tourists visit the area. The only remaining estate that was not removed for flower cultivation ([[Keukenhof]]) became world-famous for its flower displays.\n\n==Tourism and attractions==\n\nThe most popular attraction in Lisse is [[Keukenhof]], open only during spring when the [[tulip]]s are flowering. Also each spring a [[flower parade]] called the Bollenstreek ''[[Bloemencorso]]'' is held through the main streets of Lisse. In August the fantasy festival [[Castlefest]] is held in the gardens of Castle Keukenhof.\n\nOther places of interest are the museums:\n*Huys Dever, a restored castle tower from the 14th century\n*Castle Keukenhof, part of the Keukenhof estate but open year-round\n*Museum ''De Zwarte Tulp'' (Black Tulip Museum), exhibiting the history of the Dutch' bulb-growing region\n\n===Sports===\nLisse is the home of [[FC Lisse]], a [[football (soccer)|football]] team currently playing in the Zaterdag [[Topklasse]].

The municipality covers an area of {{convert|{{Dutch municipality total area|Lisse}}|km2|abbr=on}} of which {{convert|{{Dutch municipality water area|Lisse}}|km2|abbr=on}} is water. Its population was {{formatnum:{{Dutch municipality population|Lisse}}}} in {{YEAR|{{Dutch municipality population|popbaseyear}}}}. Located within the municipal boundary is also the community [[De Engel (Lisse)|De Engel]]\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lisse,_kerk_2007-04-18_13.41.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Church:Sint-Agathakerk]]\n[[File:Molenlisse.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Windmill in Lisse.]]\n\nThe history of Lisse is closely related and similar to the neighboring towns of [[Hillegom]] and [[Sassenheim]]. Based on a document from 1198 which makes official mention of the town's name, Lisse celebrated its 800-year anniversary in 1998, although there is an indication that there was already a settlement there in the 10th century.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Lisse was a small settlement; there were only 50 houses in 1500. Because of prolonged warfare (particularly the wars of [[Charles I, Duke of Burgundy|Charles the Bold]] and the [[Eighty Years' War]]), poverty was prevalent. Its population lived from agriculture, [[animal husbandry]], and [[peat]] harvesting.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, Lisse was, like [[Hillegom]], home to many [[Estate (house)|estate]]s of rich merchants and nobility. The forests and gardens of the [[Keukenhof]], Meerenburg, Wildlust, Zandvliet, Overduin en Akervoorde, Wassergeest, Grotenhof, Ter Specke, Dubbelhoven, Rosendaal, Veenenburg en Berkhout, Middelburg, Ter Beek, and Uytermeer estates all added to the town's beauty and glory.\n\nYet in the following centuries, every one of these estates (except Keukenhof) was removed to make way for the cultivation of [[bulb]] flowers. The sandy soil in Lisse's surroundings were highly suitable for its growth provided the soil was fertilized. The nearby [[dune]]s were excavated and forests cut down progressively over time for more fields for the flower business. This brought employment and prosperity to this area.\n== Floriculture centre ==\n[[File:Gem-Lisse-OpenTopo.jpg|thumb|''Dutch Topographic map of Lisse, June 2015'']]\n[[File:Floriculture centre, Lisse.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A field of tulips in Lisse]]\nIn the 20th century, the bulb flower business continued to boom, resulting in the establishment of auction and trading houses, large-scale cultivators and [[cooperative]]s. Today, Lisse exports bulbflowers in large quantities to over a hundred countries worldwide.\n\nLocated at the centre of the \"Dune and Bulb Region\" ([[Duin- en Bollenstreek]]), Holland's flower-growing region, Lisse is also a major tourist attraction. During the spring when the fields around Lisse are in a colourful bloom, hundreds of thousands of local and foreign tourists visit the area. The only remaining estate that was not removed for flower cultivation ([[Keukenhof]]) became world-famous for its flower displays.\n\n==Tourism and attractions==\n\nThe most popular attraction in Lisse is [[Keukenhof]], open only during spring when the [[tulip]]s are flowering. Also each spring a [[flower parade]] called the Bollenstreek ''[[Bloemencorso]]'' is held through the main streets of Lisse. In August the fantasy festival [[Castlefest]] is held in the gardens of Castle Keukenhof.\n\nOther places of interest are the museums:\n*Huys Dever, a restored castle tower from the 14th century\n*Castle Keukenhof, part of the Keukenhof estate but open year-round\n*Museum ''De Zwarte Tulp'' (Black Tulip Museum), exhibiting the history of the Dutch' bulb-growing region\n\n===Sports===\nLisse is the home of [[FC Lisse]], a [[football (soccer)|football]] team currently playing in the Zaterdag [[Topklasse]].

His artwork appeared on nine different magazine covers from 1923 to 1932. Martin designed the then-world's largest ever electrical display in 1917. He reshaped the then-iconic Fisk Tire Boy in late 1929. He played in [[tennis]] tournaments around the [[New York metropolitan area|Greater New York area]] from 1909 to 1931.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

Some artists created a niche and then stuck with it, such as in drawing comical situations, domestic follies, political satire, pretty women or simple pleasures. His recurring theme was of a youthful boy engaged in various lighthearted activities.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

His artwork appeared on nine different magazine covers from 1923 to 1932. Martin designed the then-world's largest ever electrical display in 1917.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L. Chenery]] in 1925.<ref name=\"Collier's\">''A Cavalcade of Collier's'', edited by McArdle (''Collier's'' last editor), 1959 pp. xii-xiii.</ref><ref>''Magazines in the Twentieth Century'', Peterson, 1956 p. 188; ''The New York Times'', August 20, 1974 p. 38.</ref> Martin drew many of its covers during the mid-[[Roaring Twenties]], including seven in 1925 (twenty 1923\u201327). Some artists created a niche and then stuck with it, such as in drawing comical situations, domestic follies, political satire, pretty women or simple pleasures. His recurring theme was of a youthful boy engaged in various lighthearted activities. This included the following:<ref>These seventeen described activities, each appeared on a ''Collier's'' cover between Feb. 2, 1924 and Aug. 27, 1927.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

{"title_page": "Betrayal at Krondor", "text_new": "{{Infobox video game\n|title = Betrayal at Krondor\n|image = Betrayal at Krondor6.jpg\n|developer = [[Dynamix]]\n|publisher = [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra On-Line]]\n|director = John Cutter\n|designer = John Cutter<br>[[Neal Hallford]]\n|programmer = Nels Bruckner\n|artist = Michael McHugh\n|composer = Jan Paul Moorhead\n|series = ''[[The Riftwar Cycle|Riftwar]]''\n|released = June 22, 1993\n|genre = [[Role-playing game|Role-playing]]\n|modes = [[Single-player]]\n|platforms = [[MS-DOS]]\n}}\n\n'''''Betrayal at Krondor''''' is an [[MS-DOS]]-based [[role-playing video game]] developed by [[Dynamix]] and released by [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra On-Line]] in the summer of [[1993 in video gaming|1993]]. ''Betrayal at Krondor'' takes place largely in [[Midkemia]], the [[fantasy literature|fantasy world]] developed by [[Raymond E. Feist]] in his ''[[Riftwar]]'' novels. The game is designed to resemble a book, separated into chapters and narrated in the third-person with a quick-save bookmark feature.\n\nAlthough neither the dialog nor narrative were written by Feist himself, the game is considered canon, having been novelized as ''[[Krondor: The Betrayal]]'' five years later. Events in the game were also written into the ''[[Riftwar]]'' novels.\n\nPyroTechnix completed a sequel, ''[[Return to Krondor]]'', which was released by Sierra in 1998. Its protracted development experienced [[development hell|considerable delay]], and the finished product was not nearly as warmly received as ''Betrayal''.\n\n[[GOG.com]] released an [[Emulator|emulated]] version of ''Betrayal at Krondor'' for [[Microsoft Windows]] in 2010.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Betrayal at Krondor - main interface.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The main interface of ''Betrayal at Krondor''. The party is travelling east along a road.]]\nGameplay occurs mainly from a first-person perspective while traveling the overworld, dungeons, and caves, but switches to a third-person view during combat. The user interface is mouse-driven, with keyboard hotkeys for each action.\n\nThe game has two possible views, the 3D first-person view and the 2D top-down map view, where the player is represented with a triangular marker. The overworld is completely mapped, but other locations are [[automap|automatically mapped]] in the top-down view as the player explores them. The player can also view the full map of [[Midkemia]] and see their location.\n\nEach chapter's main plot usually takes place completely within one or two regions of the game world. However, the player is given enormous freedom to explore the world however they wish, with ample opportunity to perform optional sub-quests and enhance their characters' abilities, gain cash, upgrade weapons and armor, and so on. Only certain locations are accessible in each chapter, though the player is free to explore anywhere within those boundaries as well as take their time performing quests. While traveling, the party camps in the wilderness to rest and recover lost health and stamina, provided that there are no enemies in the vicinity.\n\n===Moredhel wordlock chests===\nOne of the game's unique features are the large assortment of [[Moredhel]] wordlock chests, hidden throughout the land. These chests have [[combination lock]]s with letters on each dial, and a [[riddle]] written upon them whose answer opens the chest. Wordlock chests can hold valuable items and equipment, as well as quest items essential to completing the game. If no member of the player's party can read Moredhel, the writing on the chest will appear untranslated, although it can still be opened by a [[brute-force attack|brute force]] method of systematically cycling through each tumbler. The Moredhel alphabet is a character substitution of the A-Z alphabet. Gorath, a Moredhel, can read it, and casting the Union spell allows Patrus to do so for short periods of time. Wordlock chests containing essential quest items are relatively easy to find, either located near roads or their locations being disclosed through interaction with NPCs. However, \"bonus\" wordlock chests are typically hidden in areas where the player is not likely to travel unless they are assiduously searching for treasure.\n\n===Plot and dialogue===\nThe storyline is advanced primarily through literary cutscenes. Each chapter begins and ends with a cutscene, consisting of text, dialogue, and animations. The player meets various NPCs during their travels. Dialogue is text-based and some NPCs have their own pictures as well. Conversation is [[tree (data structure)|tree]]-based: in some cases, the player can choose between various dialogue keywords. This is used to get information, training, and items, sometimes for a price.\n\n===RPG system and player character development===\n[[File:Betrayal at Krondor - character sheet.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Character sheet. Two skills - melee and crossbow accuracy - are emphasized, as indicated by the red pommels of the swords.]]\nThere are two or three characters in the adventuring party at any time. While the player meets various non-human characters during the game (including dwarves, elves, goblins, and dragons), five of the six player characters are human. The exception being Gorath, a dark elf. There are two classes of characters: fighters (Locklear, James, and Gorath) and magicians (Pug, Owyn, and Patrus). Fighters use [[sword]]s and [[crossbow]]s, while magicians use a [[Magic wand|staff]]. The only long-range attacks magicians are capable of are magic spells.\n\nThe character system is unique. The main character attributes are health, stamina, speed, and strength. Speed determines how many combat grid squares the character can move. Strength influences the amount of damage the character inflicts in [[m\u00eal\u00e9e]] combat. Spell-casting, swinging one's weapon, and combat damage first use up stamina. Once stamina is depleted, you begin to eat into health. Once it decreases, the character's skills (such as the crucial trait of weapon accuracy), as well as their movement speed, are adversely impacted.\n\nIn addition to attributes, each character has a set of skills expressed as percentages. Skills can be emphasized, causing them to improve faster, while de-emphasized skills improve slower. Unlike many other role-playing games, skills are improved by using them rather than through a leveling up system. For example, fixing weapons will improve the weaponcraft skill, which in turn will make the character more effective at fixing weapons in the future. Skills include defense, crossbow accuracy, m\u00eal\u00e9e weapon accuracy, spell-casting accuracy, enemy assessment, weapon and armor repair, barding, haggling, [[lockpicking]], scouting for ambushes, and stealth. Some NPCs offer training in skills and items can increase skills permanently or temporarily.\n\nCharacters can acquire various status effects that affect their health or skills. Characters whose health drops to zero in combat are knocked out and acquire \"near death\" status, making them ineffective in combat, and their health recovery rate drops virtually to nil. If the health of the entire party drops to zero, the game will end. Improved healing rate is handled as a status effect as well, as are poisoning, drunkenness, sickness (from eating spoiled rations), and plague, which is an extremely serious condition that can reduce the party to moribund husks incapable of any productive action.\n\n===Magic===\n<!--[[File:Betrayal at Krondor-Magic.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Combat spell-casting menu. Groups of spells are chosen through the buttons, spells itself through the symbols that appear within the pattern. For variable-strength spells, the desired magnitude is chosen by clicking the rim of the pattern.]]-->\nSpells are organized into six groups, grouped by magic symbol. Four groups of spells are combat spells and two groups are non-combat spells.\n\nSpells first drain the caster's stamina and then health. Some spells have variable strength; the player can choose how much energy the spell consumes. Some combat spells also require that the target being within line of sight of the caster.\n\nSpells are learned from scrolls that are found in caches or on enemies and can be bought from shops or NPCs throughout the world.\n\n===Items and inventory===\n[[File:Betrayal at Krondor - inventory.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Inventory screen.]]\nThe game features a wide variety of items, including equipment, food, treasure, and magical artifacts. Each item also has detailed background information available by right-clicking it.\n\nThe inventory management allows transferring items between the party characters. In the case of stacks of multiple items, there's also an option to distribute them evenly within the party. The game also manages money and keys independently.\n\nEach weapon and type of armor has modifiers affecting its combat effectiveness, such as accuracy, damage, blessing, and racial modifiers. After combat, most weapons and armor must be kept in shape with a whetstone or armorer's hammer respectively. There are also items that enhance weapons and armor, such as the poisonous silverthorn or fiery [[naphtha]].\n\nPlayer characters must carry and eat rations every day or their health starts dropping. Rations are sold in taverns and can be found on enemies and in caches. Rations can also be poisoned or spoiled and will sicken characters if they eat it, adversely affecting their health, although careful inspection of all packages of questionable provenance will avoid this possibility.\n\n===Combat===\n[[File:Betrayal at Krondor.jpg|left|thumb|300px|A battle scene. Gorath, marked with a green square on the grid, is having his turn; hovering mouse over the target marks it with a yellow square, and shows attack damage estimate on the bottom of the screen.]]\nCombat is turn-based and takes place on a grid, similar to [[tactical role-playing game]]s. The characters can move to a different location on the grid and if they can reach an enemy, can attack in the same move. There are two options for attacking: a thrust and a swing. The thrust is the default attack used when moving to attack an enemy. The swing often does more damage but is less accurate and uses up one point of health/stamina. Fighters can use crossbows and magicians can cast spells, but only if there are no enemy units in adjacent squares. The player can also rest, which regains health and stamina, defend against enemy m\u00eal\u00e9e attacks, or assess an enemy's capabilities.\n\nInjured enemies may try to flee from combat, and will escape entirely and permanently from the player's grasp,  unless they are killed or otherwise prevented them from reaching the upper edge of the battlefield. Defeated enemies remain on the ground after a battle, allowing the player to loot their remains. Salvaged items of little use to the party may be sold at shops in order to boost cash reserves.\n\nThe combat interface is also used to solve magical traps. Traps involve various types of hazards, such as fireball blasters and laser crystals, and the player either has to disable them using the objects provided or otherwise navigate through the trap and reach the top of the combat field.\n\nAlthough the game uses a [[GUI]], many actions can be performed using keys as well. There is a [[glitch]] (or intended hidden feature) that allows the player to make certain combinations of two moves in a single turn\u2014one using the mouse and another using the keyboard\u2014or rest twice by pressing 'R' before the turn begins and holding it through the turn. Computer opponents also seem to use this in some instances (like moving and defending in the same turn).\n\nAnother type of character-environment interaction, that could be considered a trap or a bonus, are the graveyards scattered around the landscape. The player is able to read the inscriptions on the gravestones (usually in the form of a short poetic eulogy), and then decide to dig up the grave (if someone has a shovel). Some graves reveal items and/or money, while others summon a ghost (in some cases, multiple ghosts), which must be fought using the standard combat interface.\n\n===Temples, stores and inns===\nTemples offer a variety of services including healing and blessing equipment. They also sell a relatively expensive [[teleportation]] service; the player is able to teleport between any temples they have already visited, with the price based on the distance traveled. This operates on the principle that a person visiting a new temple will memorize a unique pattern upon the wall, and by recalling this pattern at a different temple, be transported to the first temple with the aid of a priest.\n\nStores buy and sell various kinds of items; some also repair equipment. Inns and taverns allow characters to buy food and alcohol, gain information on local happenings, gamble (in some inns), talk to some NPCs, earn money by playing the lute, and sleep, which allows full healing of wounds and fatigue, whereas resting in the wilderness only restores 80% of health and stamina.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main characters===\n; Seigneur Locklear\n: (Chapters 1, 5, 7) Locklear is the youngest son of the Baron of Land's End, a Seigneur in Prince Arutha's court, and a skilled swordsman decorated for his service at Armengar and Sethanon during the Great Rising (''[[A Darkness at Sethanon]]''). Locklear recently entered the service of a Kingdom garrison in Yabon to investigate reports of moredhel activity, where he rescued Gorath of the Ardanien from an assassin.\n\n; Squire Owyn Beleforte\n: (Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9) Owyn is a nineteen-year-old magician and the youngest son of the Count of Tiburn. Uninterested in politics, Owyn instead idolizes the magician Pug. A resourceful and crafty boy, Owyn used part of his father's wealth to travel and study magic in secret. His father eventually discovered what he was doing and, due to the political embarrassment Owyn causes him, has given him a great deal of freedom, hoping that he will eventually settle down and become suitable for a political marriage. Owyn was traveling home from visiting his aunt in Yabon when he met Locklear and Gorath. Not eager to return to the boredom of life at home, Owyn hitches his fate to theirs.\n\n; Gorath of the Ardanien\n: (Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9) A hero of the Riftwar, Gorath was chieftain of Clan Ardanien and Delekhan's chief rival to the throne of Sar-Sargoth. Gorath believes Delekhan's plan to invade the Kingdom to be madness and betrays the moredhel to warn Prince Arutha, as it the only way to save his people from another disastrous war. There is also another reason for his exile: he has broken from the Dark Path and is \"Returning\" to the eledhel in Elvandar, assuming he is not killed by his brethren first.\n\n; Seigneur James\n: (Chapters 2, 3, 5, 7) Once known as Jimmy the Hand, James is a legend among the Mockers and the son of the Upright Man, though he is unaware of his parentage. After foiling a Nighthawk attempt to assassinate Prince Arutha (''[[Silverthorn (novel)|Silverthorn]]''), James was forced to give up his life as a thief and became a squire in Arutha's court, where he became best friends with Locklear. James eventually rose to the rank of Seigneur, becoming one of Arutha's most trusted and loyal servants but still wanders the Thieves' Highway, often on business for the Crown.\n\n; Patrus\n: (Chapters 5, 7) Patrus is the court magician and magical adviser to Baron Gabot in Northwarden and one of Owyn's early magical tutors. Despite his old age, he is a spry and capable magician, whose knowledge of the Union spell allows him to temporarily read moredhel.\n\n; Duke [[Pug (fictional character)|Pug conDoin]]\n: (Chapters 8, 9) As an orphan growing up in [[Crydee]], Pug was apprenticed to Kulgan the magician but showed little magical ability until he was captured by the [[Tsurani]] during the Riftwar (''[[Magician (Feist novel)|Magician: Apprentice]]''). Seeing potential in the boy, Tsurani Great Ones trained him in the magic of the Greater Path, previously nonexistent in Midkemia. When he returned, Pug helped the sorcerer [[Macros the Black]] end the Riftwar and was adopted into the royal family and given land to start his academy of magic at Stardock (''[[Magician (Feist novel)|Magician: Master]]''). Pug is considered the most powerful magician in Midkemia, having inherited much of Macros' power in addition to his Tsurani training. He is married to Katala, whom he met in Kelewan, and has two children: a biological son William and an adopted daughter Gamina, who has telepathic powers.\n\n===Allies===\n; Prince [[Arutha ConDoin|Arutha conDoin]]\n: Prince Arutha of Krondor is ruler of the Western Realm, younger brother of [[Lyam ConDoin|King Lyam]], and half-brother of Duke Martin of Crydee. Arutha proved himself one of the Kingdom's best field commanders defending Crydee during the Riftwar and became prince after the unexpected deaths of King Rodric, Prince Erland, and his father Duke Borric. He is a well-loved and capable ruler, albeit a reluctant one.\n\n; Cullich\n: Gorath's estranged wife Cullich is a moredhel witch who helped him escape from the Northlands. Cullich thinks Gorath's willingness to surrender his position as clan leader is a sign of weakness but she doesn't trust Delekhan and will help Gorath if she can.\n\n; Baron Gabot\n: Baron Gabot is commander of Northwarden, which guards one of the four passes between the Kingdom and the Northlands. Previously Huntmaster of Carse, Gabot was old acquaintances with Duke Martin, who recommended him to the position after Baron Rossol died. Like Martin's father Duke Borric, Gabot saw the benefit of having a magician in his service and appointed Patrus his magical adviser.\n\n; Liallan\n: As a powerful moredhel clan leader and Delekhan's consort, Liallan openly supports him though she believes his plan is doomed to fail. She has her eye on the throne of Sar-Sargoth for herself and secretly aids many of Delekhan's enemies, including engineering Gorath's escape from the Northlands. Should Delekhan and his son Moraeulf die during their invasion, it would leave her in a prime position to take over the leadership of the moredhel.\n\n; Duke Martin conDoin\n: Once known as Martin Longbow, Duke Martin of Crydee is the elder half-brother of King Lyam and Prince Arutha. The illegitimate son of Duke Borric, he was raised and trained by the elves in Elvandar before becoming Huntmaster and later Duke upon the death of his father. One of the best archers in Midkemia, Martin dislikes court life and often roams the forests with his longbow in hand.\n\n; The Oracle of Aal\n: The Aal are among the oldest races in the universe and one of the few to survive the Chaos Wars between the Valheru and the gods. The Oracle, the last of its dying race, agreed to help Pug and Tomas during the Great Rising in exchange for salvation. After the battle of Sethanon, Pug brought the Oracle to Sethanon and placed it in the body of the dragon Ryath, whose mind was drained by a Dreadlord (''A Darkness at Sethanon''). The Oracle of Aal now watches over the Lifestone and will send warning to Pug and a secret garrison near Sethanon if it is disturbed.\n\n; Squire Phillip\n: Though he appears to be a young noble about Owyn's age, Phillip is actually thirty-seven, a captain in the Kingdom Army, and a courier for the secret garrison near Sethanon. Owyn met him at a party in Yabon prior to the start of the game and meets him again throughout his travels.\n\n; Tomas\n: Prince Consort to Queen Aglaranna and Warleader of Elvandar, Tomas grew up in Crydee with his best friend Pug. During the Riftwar, Tomas discovered the dying dragon Rhuagh, who gave him an ancient suit of armor (''Magician: Apprentice''). The armor transformed Tomas into a blend of human and Valheru and gave him the memories and abilities of Ashen-Shugar, the Valheru to whom it once belonged. After marrying Aglaranna, Tomas considers Elvandar under his protection and only leaves in the most extreme of circumstances.\n\n===Villains===\n; Delekhan\n: Delekhan is the leader of the Moredhel Nations of the North. One of the Murmandamus' field generals during the Great Rising (''A Darkness at Sethanon''), Delekhan believes Murmandamus still lives, imprisoned by Prince Arutha at Sethanon. He has unified his people with the help of magicians known only as \"the Six\" (later revealed to be Tsurani Great Ones) in order to invade the [[Kingdom of the Isles]], free Murmandamus, and finish what was started a decade before.\n\n; Makala\n: Makala is a Great One, a magician from the Tsurani homeworld of [[Kelewan]], who is visiting Prince Arutha's court ostensibly as a representative of the Emperor of Tsuranuanni. Believing that Pug hid a weapon of tremendous power which could be used against the Tsurani, Makala set out to investigate what really happened at the battle of Sethanon. He manipulates Delekhan and the moredhel, using their attack as a diversion so that he can enter Sethanon unhindered.\n\n; Narab and Nago\n: The brothers Narab and Nago are magicians who serve Delekhan. Nago has infiltrated the Kingdom and coordinates moredhel spies from a secret location near Sarth. Narab has fallen out of favor with Delekhan, and seeking to regain his position in Delekhan's inner circle, captures Owyn and Gorath for him. However, Delekhan is displeased with what he has done so Narab turns on his former master and helps Owyn and Gorath escape. He then plans on becoming leader of the moredhel himself.\n\n; Navon du Sandau\n: To most he is simply a charismatic young merchant, but Navon is actually Neville Corvalis, the half-brother of Owyn's cousin Ugyne. When Ugyne's father Count Corvalis found out that Neville was his wife's illegitimate son, he arranged to have Neville killed in a wine cellar collapse. Though he was believed dead, Neville's body was never found. He was found by Nighthawks who had regrouped in Cavall after their destruction in Krondor by Prince Arutha (''A Darkness at Sethanon''). Using a Corvalis family heirloom, a magical spyglass, Neville convinced them he had magical powers and became their leader. He then set about exacting revenge on Count Corvalis, burning down the keep so the caverns underneath could be used as a Nighthawk hideout and courting Ugyne so he could take over her family's fortune.\n\n==Locations==\n\n===Midkemia===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Betrayal at Krondor-MidkemiaMap.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Midkemia, the Kingdom of the Isles, the Northlands, and Elvandar \u2013 as shown on the paper map included with Betrayal at Krondor|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Sunday, 11 October 2009|date=May 2012}}]] -->\n\n; Cavall Keep\n: (Accessible in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6) Cavall Keep is a small eastern farming town in the Kenting Hills ruled by Owyn's uncle, Count Geoffrey Corvalis. The keep burned down mysteriously three years ago, preventing access to the caverns underneath, which run south to the waterfall known as Cavall Run.\n\n; [[Elvandar]]\n: (Accessible in Chapter 6) The forest city of Elvandar, home of the eledhel (the light elves), lies far to the northwest of the duchy of Yabon and is ruled by Queen Aglaranna and Prince Consort Tomas. Though isolated and well-protected, the Tsurani attacked Elvandar during the Riftwar and there are still skirmishes with the moredhel on its northern borders.\n\n; Highcastle\n: (Accessible in Chapters 1, 2, 3) The frontier fort town of Highcastle guards Cutter's Gap, one of the four passes between the Kingdom and the Northlands. Overrun by the moredhel during the Great Rising (''A Darkness at Sethanon''), Prince Arutha had the fortifications reinforced in recent years. Highcastle is currently commanded by Baron Baldwin de la Troville and, in his absence, Baron Kevin of Zun.\n\n; Krondor\n: (Accessible in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6) Capital of the Western Realm of the Kingdom of the Isles, Krondor is the traditional home of the heir apparent to the throne. It is currently ruled by Prince Arutha and Princess Anita, though the sewers under the city are a maze of tunnels known as the Thieves' Highway and controlled by the Mockers, the thieves' guild of Krondor, and their mysterious leader, the Upright Man.\n\n; LaMut\n: (Accessible in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6) The city of LaMut is located in the duchy of Yabon, near the reopened rift to Kelewan. It is ruled by the Earl Kasumi and home to a large Tsurani population that settled there after the Riftwar.\n[[File:BaK Midkemia map.gif|left|thumb|200px|The in-game map of Midkemia]]\n\n; Malac's Cross\n: (Accessible in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6) The city of Malac's Cross marks the eastern boundary of the Western Realm and is home to the Abbaye Ishap, an ancient temple currently run by the Abbot Graves. Outside of the city, where the old city once stood, is a statue of a dragon, built as a tribute to Malac, from which the Oracle of Aal can be contacted.\n\n; Northwarden\n: (Accessible in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 5) The fortress of Northwarden lies on a narrow mountain path overlooking one of the four passes between the Kingdom and the Northlands. Northwarden is currently commanded by Baron Gabot.\n\n; Romney\n: (Accessible in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6) Located on the river Rom, the eastern city of Romney is known as the City of Guilds. Although ruled by Duke Romney, control of the city lies with its various merchant guilds, leading to the occasional guild war.\n\n; Sarth\n: (Accessible in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6) The town of Sarth is home to an ancient mountaintop fortress which was converted into an abbey and library by the Order of Ishap. The vaults have hundreds of thousands of books, containing a wealth of knowledge about the history and lore of Midkemia, tended to by Brother Anthony and Brother Marc. Beneath the vaults is an abandoned dwarven emerald mine known as the Mac Bourgalan Dok.\n\n; Sar-Isbandia (Armengar)\n: (Accessible in Chapter 4) The fortress city of Sar-Isbandia was built atop miles of naphtha tunnels long ago by the glamredhel (the mad elves) before they were obliterated by the moredhel (the dark elves). Located in the Vale of Isbandia north of the Inclindel Gap, humans from Yabon settled in the city hundreds of years ago, renamed it Armengar and became lifelong enemies of the moredhel. The Armengarians were among Murmandamus' first targets during the Great Rising so Prince Arutha and Guy du Bas-Tyra, the city's Protector, evacuated the city and attempted to destroy Murmandamus' army by incinerating the city (''A Darkness at Sethanon''). Recently, moredhel have moved into the ruins and started to rebuild.\n\n; Sar-Sargoth\n: (Accessible in Chapter 4) Twin city of Sar-Isbandia, the fortress city of Sar-Sargoth to the north was also built by the glamredhel and was taken by the moredhel as their capital. The tunnels beneath the city are home to Delekhan's dungeons while the outskirts are lined with pikes bearing the heads of his enemies.\n\n; Sethanon\n: (Surface ruins accessible in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6, underground ruins only accessible in Chapter 9) Once a minor barony in the heart of the Kingdom, Sethanon was poorly defended and completely destroyed during the Great Rising (''A Darkness at Sethanon''). Coincidentally built above the ancient Valheru ruins containing the Lifestone, King Lyam and Prince Arutha ordered the city abandoned after the Battle of Sethanon, ostensibly as a memorial to those who had died there, and stationed a secret garrison nearby to protect it. Within the ruins beneath the city lies the Lifestone and its guardian, the dragon Ryath, whose mind contains the Oracle of Aal.\n\n; Silden\n: (Accessible in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6) The eastern fishing town of Silden is a seaport on the Kingdom Sea. Located on a nearby island off the coast is the temple of Eortis, the dead god of the sea. Known for its shady underworld, someone known only as The Crawler has recently establish himself within the city, disrupting business for both the Mockers in Krondor and the guilds in Romney.\n\n===Timirianya===\n: (Accessible in Chapter 8) The desolate world of Timirianya was destroyed by the Valheru and is currently inhabited by Panath-Tiandn, humanoid serpents akin to [[Pantathians]]. During the Chaos Wars, the gods of Timirianya crystallized magic into solid manna, causing the Valheru to leave when they thought the world's energy was depleted. In order to cast magic on Timirianya, one must use a crystal staff and keep it charged with raw manna.\n\n; The Temple of Karzeen Mauk\n: Located in the north, all that remains of the high temple of the gods of Timirianya are nine pillars, within which the surviving gods have taken refuge. Only Dhatsavan, Lord of Gates, still has enough power left to communicate with visitors.\n\n; The Temple of Dhatsavan (Riftworld Mine)\n: Also known as the Riftworld Mine, the ruins of the temple are buried underground and are currently occupied by Panath-Tiandn. After Makala abducts her, Gamina is imprisoned in a crystal cage within the ruins.\n\n==Plot==\nTen years after ''[[A Darkness at Sethanon]]'', Seigneur Locklear is serving at a northern Kingdom garrison when he saves Gorath of the Ardanien from an assassin. Gorath has brought a warning of an invasion planned by Delekhan, leader of the moredhel, so Locklear agrees to take him to see Prince Arutha in Krondor. Injured from numerous attacks, they ask for help from Owyn Beleforte, a young magician from Tiburn. The game begins in their camp north of LaMut.\n\n===Chapter I: Into A Dark Night===\nOwyn is bandaging Gorath's and Locklear's injuries when they are attacked by a moredhel assassin whom Gorath dispatches before the three of them set out south. Surviving multiple assassination attempts, they eventually reach Krondor. Finding the palace gates sabotaged, they enter the palace via the sewers with Seigneur James' help. Upon meeting Prince Arutha, another moredhel assassin sneaks in and attempts to kill Gorath, only to be foiled by Pug.\n\n===Chapter II: Shadow Of The Nighthawks===\nGorath informs Arutha of Delekhan's plans, but Arutha does not trust him because he does not know the location of the attack. Gorath thinks they can find out by intercepting Delekhan's Nighthawk spies in Romney. Arutha arranges for James to escort Gorath to Romney and meet with a group of the king's soldiers investigating recent Nighthawk activity in the east. Arutha will muster his army and await word of where the attack will occur. James, Owyn, and Gorath secretly slip out of the city through the sewers and head east. Arriving at the tavern in Romney, they discover that the king's soldiers have all been murdered.\n\n===Chapter III: The Spyglass And The Spider===\nTwo clues were left behind at the murder scene: an enchanted spyglass and a silver spider. James, Owyn, and Gorath follow the trail of the spyglass and the spider north to Cavall Keep and uncover the leader of the Nighthawks, the merchant Navon du Sandau. After killing him, they enter the Nighthawks' hideout in the caverns beneath Cavall Keep, where they learn that Delekhan plans to attack Northwarden. Realizing that Nighthawks probably infiltrated the fortress, they split up. James heads to Northwarden while Owyn and Gorath head south to warn Arutha. Before they can reach Arutha though, Owyn and Gorath are captured by Narab, one of Delekhan's chieftains.\n\n===Chapter IV: Marked For Death===\nGorath and Owyn are taken to Sar-Sargoth, where Narab presents them to Delekhan. Delekhan, enraged that Narab has ruined his plans, tells him his life is forfeit. Narab turns on Delekhan and, unbeknownst to them, frees Owyn and Gorath. They escape Sar-Sargoth and head south to the Inclindel Gap, where they meet a Kingdom patrol and are taken to Arutha's camp. Learning of the impending attack on Northwarden, Arutha readies his army and sends Owyn and Gorath to Krondor to seek Pug's help in case the moredhel employ magic.\n\n===Chapter V: When Rivers Run Blood===\nJames and Locklear arrive at Northwarden and are sent by Baron Gabot to find his magical adviser Patrus. The three of them help Duke Martin prepare for the attack by poisoning moredhel food supplies, finding the minstrel Tamney, stealing the moredhel battle plans, and killing six moredhel magicians hiding behind Kingdom lines. Returning to Northwarden as the moredhel siege begins, they discover that Nighthawks have murdered Baron Gabot, leaving James in command. The battle goes badly and they are about to be overrun when Arutha arrives with his army in time to drive off the moredhel.\n\n===Chapter VI: Betrayal===\nMakala visits Pug in Krondor, telling him that Gamina is considered an abomination by the Assembly of Magicians and that he has imprisoned her until her fate can be decided. Pug is enraged at Makala's betrayal and vows to find her, blasting the words \"The Book Of Macros\" into the wall. When Katala is unable to find him or their daughter, she discovers his message and informs Owyn and Gorath. Following clues from the libraries at Sarth and the Abbaye Ishap, Owyn and Gorath head west to Elvandar, where Gorath completes his \"Returning\" and pledges his allegiance to Queen Aglaranna and Prince Consort Tomas. Tomas shows them the Book of Macros, a gift from Pug to find him should he leave the message to do so. Recently injured by a poisoned blade in a moredhel skirmish, Tomas asks Owyn and Gorath to go in his stead. Owyn and Gorath read the book, which teleports them into the unknown.\n\n===Chapter VII: The Long Ride===\nIn Northwarden, the moredhel raiding leader is captured and reveals that they plan to use a rift machine in the Dimwood to bypass Arutha's army, enter Sethanon, and free Murmandamus, whom they believe is alive and imprisoned there. Realizing that the attack was a diversion engineered by Makala, Arutha orders his troops to Sethanon and instructs James, Locklear, and Patrus to find and destroy the rift machine. After learning that the machine can be disrupted by a Tsurani device called a Waani, they find the machine and disable it. However, as the rift collapses, it pulls in everything nearby before exploding. James and Locklear grab onto trees but Patrus is sucked into the collapsing rift and is apparently killed. At the same moment, three figures appear in a flash of purple light.\n\n===Chapter VIII: Of Lands Afar===\nOwyn and Gorath are teleported to Timirianya, where Owyn realizes that magic does not work and Pug would be powerless. Owyn and Gorath eventually find Pug, who has figured out that by abducting Gamina and manipulating Delekhan, Makala has lured Pug away from Midkemia and Arutha's army away from Sethanon and is free to enter Sethanon unopposed and seek out the Lifestone. Using the Cup of Rlnn Skrr, Owyn restores Pug's powers and they find Gamina imprisoned in a crystal cage in the underground ruins of the Temple of Dhatsavan. Gorath smashes the cage and, using a special pattern stone Pug has brought, the four of them return to Midkemia.\n\n===Chapter IX: Mad Gods Rage===\nIn a flash of purple light, Pug, Owyn, and Gorath appear before James and Locklear in the Dimwood and tell them to wait for Arutha and let him know that there is no magical threat to his army; Makala will be waiting for Pug at Sethanon. Pug, Owyn, and Gorath travel to the caverns beneath Sethanon and kill the Tsurani Great Ones (\"the Six\") protecting the Lifestone Chamber. Gorath remains behind to protect the Oracle of Aal, which was incapacitated by Makala, while Pug and Owyn confront the magician. Makala believes that Pug was keeping the Lifestone hidden to use as a weapon and wants it destroyed, but Pug refuses because it would release the Valheru souls trapped inside. Engaging Makala in a magical battle, Pug and Owyn eventually kill him.\n\nAfterward, Gorath enters the chamber locked in combat with Delekhan. When Delekhan reaches for the Lifestone, Gorath tries to stop him and they begin to transform as the Valheru within try to escape. Pug and Owyn are forced to kill them both with a blast of magic in order to prevent the Valheru from being released. Returning above ground, Pug creates magical illusions of Murmandamus and Delekhan which are then incinerated by the Oracle of Aal. Having seen their leaders killed, the moredhel retreat, during which Narab kills Delekhan's son Moraeulf, fulfilling his plans for taking over the moredhel. Owyn is left alone with Pug, who reveals that since Owyn now knows about the Lifestone, Pug must ensure that the secret is safe and suggests that Owyn become one of his students at Stardock. Owyn laughs and replies that he's never wanted anything else.\n\n==Development==\nAlthough the game was licensed from Raymond E. Feist, a long-held myth was that the text and the story of the game were actually created by Feist himself. Feist states in his afterword to ''Krondor: The Betrayal'' that he was busy writing ''[[Krondor's Sons#The King's Buccaneer|The King's Buccaneer]]'' during the game's production and that the plot, text, and new characters were created solely by designers [[Neal Hallford]] and John Cutter. Feist did have editorial final say on the game, but most of what Hallford and Cutter created was left intact.\n\n===Technical details===\nThe game runs in 256-color 320x200 [[Video Graphics Array|VGA mode]]. The graphics engine uses [[texture mapping|texture]]d [[3D graphics]] to draw the terrain and uses [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] for most of the detailed objects. The engine does not support multilevel terrain as such, but obstacles such as hills and mountains are supported. Most shops, inns, temples, special locations, and large cities are navigated through pictures usable through [[Screen hotspot|hotspots]], while smaller towns have 3D buildings.\n\n[[Non-player character|NPC]] and character art is based on photographs. Environments are a mix of captured images and hand-drawn. In combat and puzzle screens, all characters are animated, except for movement - characters do not appear to move their legs while walking. The game models illuminate to a certain extent: in the overworld, day and night are modeled, and in underground locations, the player needs to use a torch or a light spell to illuminate their surroundings.\n\nThe game runs in [[protected mode]], using [[Borland C++]]'s Ergo [[DOS Protected Mode Interface|DPMI]] / RTM  [[DOS extender]].<ref>String in krondor.exe: \"Borland C++ - Copyright 1991 Borland Intl.\"</ref> It remained quite compatible with [[Microsoft Windows]] up to the 9x series and works very well in [[DOSBox]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dosbox.sourceforge.net/comp_list.php?showID=115&letter=B |title=Betrayal at Krondor DOSBox compatibility report |author=Harekiet |accessdate=2006-11-27 }}</ref> and [[VDMSound]].

Feist#The Riftwar Legacy|The Riftwar Legacy]]''. Feist credited Hallford and Cutter as co-authors of the original story for ''Krondor: the Betrayal'', and dedicated the book to both of them.\n\nThe game and book are set approximately halfway between ''[[A Darkness at Sethanon]]'' and ''[[Prince of the Blood (novel)|Prince of the Blood]]''. There are minor differences, such as Owyn's last name being Belefote rather than Beleforte and the towns of Tanneurs and Eggley are changed to Tannerus and Eggly, but the novel largely covers the main plot of the game accurately and ignores most of the sidequests.\n\nThe game first introduced Lysle Rigger, Jimmy the Hand's long lost twin brother as well as Kat and Abbot Graves, whose granddaughter was Katherine \"Kitty\" Graves. Both Lysle Rigger and Kitty Graves would play significant roles in Feist's [[Raymond E. Feist#The Serpentwar Saga|Serpentwar]] novels.\n\n==Reception==\nSales of the original 3\u00bd\" floppy disk release were slow, leading Sierra to sell the ''Riftwar'' rights back to Raymond Feist, but the game became a hit when it was re-released on CD-ROM.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Antara|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|pages=50\u201351}}</ref>\n\n''[[Pelit]]'' gave ''Betrayal at Krondor'' a 94% score, calling the game citing \"the wonderful game system, lack of bugs, and the book-like atmosphere\" and said \"Krondor is as big a revolution in turn-based role-playing games as the ''[[Ultima Underworld|Underworld]]''s were in 3D role-playing games.\"<ref>{{cite news |first=Niko |last=Nirvi |author2=Ossi M\u00e4ntylahti |title=Betrayal at Krondor |url=http://www.pelit.fi/index.php?id=60360 |work=[[Pelit]] |publisher=Sanoma Magazines |date=May 1993 |accessdate=2007-01-03 |issn=1235-1199 |language=Finnish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215140510/http://www.pelit.fi/index.php?id=60360 |archivedate=2007-12-15 }}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in October 1993 called ''Krondor'' \"a fantasy role-playing game unlike any other ... a new high-watermark in RPG design\".

''Betrayal at Krondor'' takes place largely in [[Midkemia]], the [[fantasy literature|fantasy world]] developed by [[Raymond E. Feist]] in his ''[[Riftwar]]'' novels. The game is designed to resemble a book, separated into chapters and narrated in the third-person with a quick-save bookmark feature.\n\nAlthough neither the dialog nor narrative were written by Feist himself, the game is considered canon, having been novelized as ''[[Krondor: The Betrayal]]'' five years later. Events in the game were also written into the ''[[Riftwar]]'' novels.\n\nPyroTechnix completed a sequel, ''[[Return to Krondor]]'', which was released by Sierra in 1998. Its protracted development experienced [[development hell|considerable delay]], and the finished product was not nearly as warmly received as ''Betrayal''.\n\n[[GOG.com]] released an [[Emulator|emulated]] version of ''Betrayal at Krondor'' for [[Microsoft Windows]] in 2010.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Betrayal at Krondor - main interface.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The main interface of ''Betrayal at Krondor''. The party is travelling east along a road.]]\nGameplay occurs mainly from a first-person perspective while traveling the overworld, dungeons, and caves, but switches to a third-person view during combat. The user interface is mouse-driven, with keyboard hotkeys for each action.\n\nThe game has two possible views, the 3D first-person view and the 2D top-down map view, where the player is represented with a triangular marker. The overworld is completely mapped, but other locations are [[automap|automatically mapped]] in the top-down view as the player explores them. The player can also view the full map of [[Midkemia]] and see their location.\n\nEach chapter's main plot usually takes place completely within one or two regions of the game world. However, the player is given enormous freedom to explore the world however they wish, with ample opportunity to perform optional sub-quests and enhance their characters' abilities, gain cash, upgrade weapons and armor, and so on. Only certain locations are accessible in each chapter, though the player is free to explore anywhere within those boundaries as well as take their time performing quests. While traveling, the party camps in the wilderness to rest and recover lost health and stamina, provided that there are no enemies in the vicinity.\n\n===Moredhel wordlock chests===\nOne of the game's unique features are the large assortment of [[Moredhel]] wordlock chests, hidden throughout the land. These chests have [[combination lock]]s with letters on each dial, and a [[riddle]] written upon them whose answer opens the chest. Wordlock chests can hold valuable items and equipment, as well as quest items essential to completing the game. If no member of the player's party can read Moredhel, the writing on the chest will appear untranslated, although it can still be opened by a [[brute-force attack|brute force]] method of systematically cycling through each tumbler. The Moredhel alphabet is a character substitution of the A-Z alphabet. Gorath, a Moredhel, can read it, and casting the Union spell allows Patrus to do so for short periods of time. Wordlock chests containing essential quest items are relatively easy to find, either located near roads or their locations being disclosed through interaction with NPCs. However, \"bonus\" wordlock chests are typically hidden in areas where the player is not likely to travel unless they are assiduously searching for treasure.\n\n===Plot and dialogue===\nThe storyline is advanced primarily through literary cutscenes. Each chapter begins and ends with a cutscene, consisting of text, dialogue, and animations. The player meets various NPCs during their travels. Dialogue is text-based and some NPCs have their own pictures as well. Conversation is [[tree (data structure)|tree]]-based: in some cases, the player can choose between various dialogue keywords. This is used to get information, training, and items, sometimes for a price.\n\n===RPG system and player character development===\n[[File:Betrayal at Krondor - character sheet.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Character sheet. Two skills - melee and crossbow accuracy - are emphasized, as indicated by the red pommels of the swords.]]\nThere are two or three characters in the adventuring party at any time. While the player meets various non-human characters during the game (including dwarves, elves, goblins, and dragons), five of the six player characters are human. The exception being Gorath, a dark elf. There are two classes of characters: fighters (Locklear, James, and Gorath) and magicians (Pug, Owyn, and Patrus). Fighters use [[sword]]s and [[crossbow]]s, while magicians use a [[Magic wand|staff]]. The only long-range attacks magicians are capable of are magic spells.\n\nThe character system is unique. The main character attributes are health, stamina, speed, and strength. Speed determines how many combat grid squares the character can move. Strength influences the amount of damage the character inflicts in [[m\u00eal\u00e9e]] combat. Spell-casting, swinging one's weapon, and combat damage first use up stamina. Once stamina is depleted, you begin to eat into health. Once it decreases, the character's skills (such as the crucial trait of weapon accuracy), as well as their movement speed, are adversely impacted.\n\nIn addition to attributes, each character has a set of skills expressed as percentages. Skills can be emphasized, causing them to improve faster, while de-emphasized skills improve slower. Unlike many other role-playing games, skills are improved by using them rather than through a leveling up system. For example, fixing weapons will improve the weaponcraft skill, which in turn will make the character more effective at fixing weapons in the future. Skills include defense, crossbow accuracy, m\u00eal\u00e9e weapon accuracy, spell-casting accuracy, enemy assessment, weapon and armor repair, barding, haggling, [[lockpicking]], scouting for ambushes, and stealth. Some NPCs offer training in skills and items can increase skills permanently or temporarily.\n\nCharacters can acquire various status effects that affect their health or skills. Characters whose health drops to zero in combat are knocked out and acquire \"near death\" status, making them ineffective in combat, and their health recovery rate drops virtually to nil. If the health of the entire party drops to zero, the game will end. Improved healing rate is handled as a status effect as well, as are poisoning, drunkenness, sickness (from eating spoiled rations), and plague, which is an extremely serious condition that can reduce the party to moribund husks incapable of any productive action.\n\n===Magic===\n<!--[[File:Betrayal at Krondor-Magic.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Combat spell-casting menu. Groups of spells are chosen through the buttons, spells itself through the symbols that appear within the pattern. For variable-strength spells, the desired magnitude is chosen by clicking the rim of the pattern.]]-->\nSpells are organized into six groups, grouped by magic symbol. Four groups of spells are combat spells and two groups are non-combat spells.\n\nSpells first drain the caster's stamina and then health. Some spells have variable strength; the player can choose how much energy the spell consumes. Some combat spells also require that the target being within line of sight of the caster.\n\nSpells are learned from scrolls that are found in caches or on enemies and can be bought from shops or NPCs throughout the world.\n\n===Items and inventory===\n[[File:Betrayal at Krondor - inventory.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Inventory screen.]]\nThe game features a wide variety of items, including equipment, food, treasure, and magical artifacts. Each item also has detailed background information available by right-clicking it.\n\nThe inventory management allows transferring items between the party characters. In the case of stacks of multiple items, there's also an option to distribute them evenly within the party. The game also manages money and keys independently.\n\nEach weapon and type of armor has modifiers affecting its combat effectiveness, such as accuracy, damage, blessing, and racial modifiers. After combat, most weapons and armor must be kept in shape with a whetstone or armorer's hammer respectively. There are also items that enhance weapons and armor, such as the poisonous silverthorn or fiery [[naphtha]].\n\nPlayer characters must carry and eat rations every day or their health starts dropping. Rations are sold in taverns and can be found on enemies and in caches. Rations can also be poisoned or spoiled and will sicken characters if they eat it, adversely affecting their health, although careful inspection of all packages of questionable provenance will avoid this possibility.\n\n===Combat===\n[[File:Betrayal at Krondor.jpg|left|thumb|300px|A battle scene. Gorath, marked with a green square on the grid, is having his turn; hovering mouse over the target marks it with a yellow square, and shows attack damage estimate on the bottom of the screen.]]\nCombat is turn-based and takes place on a grid, similar to [[tactical role-playing game]]s. The characters can move to a different location on the grid and if they can reach an enemy, can attack in the same move. There are two options for attacking: a thrust and a swing. The thrust is the default attack used when moving to attack an enemy. The swing often does more damage but is less accurate and uses up one point of health/stamina. Fighters can use crossbows and magicians can cast spells, but only if there are no enemy units in adjacent squares. The player can also rest, which regains health and stamina, defend against enemy m\u00eal\u00e9e attacks, or assess an enemy's capabilities.\n\nInjured enemies may try to flee from combat, and will escape entirely and permanently from the player's grasp,  unless they are killed or otherwise prevented them from reaching the upper edge of the battlefield. Defeated enemies remain on the ground after a battle, allowing the player to loot their remains. Salvaged items of little use to the party may be sold at shops in order to boost cash reserves.\n\nThe combat interface is also used to solve magical traps. Traps involve various types of hazards, such as fireball blasters and laser crystals, and the player either has to disable them using the objects provided or otherwise navigate through the trap and reach the top of the combat field.\n\nAlthough the game uses a [[GUI]], many actions can be performed using keys as well. There is a [[glitch]] (or intended hidden feature) that allows the player to make certain combinations of two moves in a single turn\u2014one using the mouse and another using the keyboard\u2014or rest twice by pressing 'R' before the turn begins and holding it through the turn. Computer opponents also seem to use this in some instances (like moving and defending in the same turn).\n\nAnother type of character-environment interaction, that could be considered a trap or a bonus, are the graveyards scattered around the landscape. The player is able to read the inscriptions on the gravestones (usually in the form of a short poetic eulogy), and then decide to dig up the grave (if someone has a shovel). Some graves reveal items and/or money, while others summon a ghost (in some cases, multiple ghosts), which must be fought using the standard combat interface.\n\n===Temples, stores and inns===\nTemples offer a variety of services including healing and blessing equipment. They also sell a relatively expensive [[teleportation]] service; the player is able to teleport between any temples they have already visited, with the price based on the distance traveled. This operates on the principle that a person visiting a new temple will memorize a unique pattern upon the wall, and by recalling this pattern at a different temple, be transported to the first temple with the aid of a priest.\n\nStores buy and sell various kinds of items; some also repair equipment. Inns and taverns allow characters to buy food and alcohol, gain information on local happenings, gamble (in some inns), talk to some NPCs, earn money by playing the lute, and sleep, which allows full healing of wounds and fatigue, whereas resting in the wilderness only restores 80% of health and stamina.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main characters===\n; Seigneur Locklear\n: (Chapters 1, 5, 7) Locklear is the youngest son of the Baron of Land's End, a Seigneur in Prince Arutha's court, and a skilled swordsman decorated for his service at Armengar and Sethanon during the Great Rising (''[[A Darkness at Sethanon]]''). Locklear recently entered the service of a Kingdom garrison in Yabon to investigate reports of moredhel activity, where he rescued Gorath of the Ardanien from an assassin.\n\n; Squire Owyn Beleforte\n: (Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9) Owyn is a nineteen-year-old magician and the youngest son of the Count of Tiburn. Uninterested in politics, Owyn instead idolizes the magician Pug. A resourceful and crafty boy, Owyn used part of his father's wealth to travel and study magic in secret. His father eventually discovered what he was doing and, due to the political embarrassment Owyn causes him, has given him a great deal of freedom, hoping that he will eventually settle down and become suitable for a political marriage. Owyn was traveling home from visiting his aunt in Yabon when he met Locklear and Gorath. Not eager to return to the boredom of life at home, Owyn hitches his fate to theirs.\n\n; Gorath of the Ardanien\n: (Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9) A hero of the Riftwar, Gorath was chieftain of Clan Ardanien and Delekhan's chief rival to the throne of Sar-Sargoth. Gorath believes Delekhan's plan to invade the Kingdom to be madness and betrays the moredhel to warn Prince Arutha, as it the only way to save his people from another disastrous war. There is also another reason for his exile: he has broken from the Dark Path and is \"Returning\" to the eledhel in Elvandar, assuming he is not killed by his brethren first.\n\n; Seigneur James\n: (Chapters 2, 3, 5, 7) Once known as Jimmy the Hand, James is a legend among the Mockers and the son of the Upright Man, though he is unaware of his parentage. After foiling a Nighthawk attempt to assassinate Prince Arutha (''[[Silverthorn (novel)|Silverthorn]]''), James was forced to give up his life as a thief and became a squire in Arutha's court, where he became best friends with Locklear. James eventually rose to the rank of Seigneur, becoming one of Arutha's most trusted and loyal servants but still wanders the Thieves' Highway, often on business for the Crown.\n\n; Patrus\n: (Chapters 5, 7) Patrus is the court magician and magical adviser to Baron Gabot in Northwarden and one of Owyn's early magical tutors. Despite his old age, he is a spry and capable magician, whose knowledge of the Union spell allows him to temporarily read moredhel.\n\n; Duke [[Pug (fictional character)|Pug conDoin]]\n: (Chapters 8, 9) As an orphan growing up in [[Crydee]], Pug was apprenticed to Kulgan the magician but showed little magical ability until he was captured by the [[Tsurani]] during the Riftwar (''[[Magician (Feist novel)|Magician: Apprentice]]''). Seeing potential in the boy, Tsurani Great Ones trained him in the magic of the Greater Path, previously nonexistent in Midkemia. When he returned, Pug helped the sorcerer [[Macros the Black]] end the Riftwar and was adopted into the royal family and given land to start his academy of magic at Stardock (''[[Magician (Feist novel)|Magician: Master]]''). Pug is considered the most powerful magician in Midkemia, having inherited much of Macros' power in addition to his Tsurani training. He is married to Katala, whom he met in Kelewan, and has two children: a biological son William and an adopted daughter Gamina, who has telepathic powers.\n\n===Allies===\n; Prince [[Arutha ConDoin|Arutha conDoin]]\n: Prince Arutha of Krondor is ruler of the Western Realm, younger brother of [[Lyam ConDoin|King Lyam]], and half-brother of Duke Martin of Crydee. Arutha proved himself one of the Kingdom's best field commanders defending Crydee during the Riftwar and became prince after the unexpected deaths of King Rodric, Prince Erland, and his father Duke Borric. He is a well-loved and capable ruler, albeit a reluctant one.\n\n; Cullich\n: Gorath's estranged wife Cullich is a moredhel witch who helped him escape from the Northlands. Cullich thinks Gorath's willingness to surrender his position as clan leader is a sign of weakness but she doesn't trust Delekhan and will help Gorath if she can.\n\n; Baron Gabot\n: Baron Gabot is commander of Northwarden, which guards one of the four passes between the Kingdom and the Northlands. Previously Huntmaster of Carse, Gabot was old acquaintances with Duke Martin, who recommended him to the position after Baron Rossol died. Like Martin's father Duke Borric, Gabot saw the benefit of having a magician in his service and appointed Patrus his magical adviser.\n\n; Liallan\n: As a powerful moredhel clan leader and Delekhan's consort, Liallan openly supports him though she believes his plan is doomed to fail. She has her eye on the throne of Sar-Sargoth for herself and secretly aids many of Delekhan's enemies, including engineering Gorath's escape from the Northlands. Should Delekhan and his son Moraeulf die during their invasion, it would leave her in a prime position to take over the leadership of the moredhel.\n\n; Duke Martin conDoin\n: Once known as Martin Longbow, Duke Martin of Crydee is the elder half-brother of King Lyam and Prince Arutha. The illegitimate son of Duke Borric, he was raised and trained by the elves in Elvandar before becoming Huntmaster and later Duke upon the death of his father. One of the best archers in Midkemia, Martin dislikes court life and often roams the forests with his longbow in hand.\n\n; The Oracle of Aal\n: The Aal are among the oldest races in the universe and one of the few to survive the Chaos Wars between the Valheru and the gods. The Oracle, the last of its dying race, agreed to help Pug and Tomas during the Great Rising in exchange for salvation. After the battle of Sethanon, Pug brought the Oracle to Sethanon and placed it in the body of the dragon Ryath, whose mind was drained by a Dreadlord (''A Darkness at Sethanon''). The Oracle of Aal now watches over the Lifestone and will send warning to Pug and a secret garrison near Sethanon if it is disturbed.\n\n; Squire Phillip\n: Though he appears to be a young noble about Owyn's age, Phillip is actually thirty-seven, a captain in the Kingdom Army, and a courier for the secret garrison near Sethanon. Owyn met him at a party in Yabon prior to the start of the game and meets him again throughout his travels.\n\n; Tomas\n: Prince Consort to Queen Aglaranna and Warleader of Elvandar, Tomas grew up in Crydee with his best friend Pug. During the Riftwar, Tomas discovered the dying dragon Rhuagh, who gave him an ancient suit of armor (''Magician: Apprentice''). The armor transformed Tomas into a blend of human and Valheru and gave him the memories and abilities of Ashen-Shugar, the Valheru to whom it once belonged. After marrying Aglaranna, Tomas considers Elvandar under his protection and only leaves in the most extreme of circumstances.\n\n===Villains===\n; Delekhan\n: Delekhan is the leader of the Moredhel Nations of the North. One of the Murmandamus' field generals during the Great Rising (''A Darkness at Sethanon''), Delekhan believes Murmandamus still lives, imprisoned by Prince Arutha at Sethanon. He has unified his people with the help of magicians known only as \"the Six\" (later revealed to be Tsurani Great Ones) in order to invade the [[Kingdom of the Isles]], free Murmandamus, and finish what was started a decade before.\n\n; Makala\n: Makala is a Great One, a magician from the Tsurani homeworld of [[Kelewan]], who is visiting Prince Arutha's court ostensibly as a representative of the Emperor of Tsuranuanni. Believing that Pug hid a weapon of tremendous power which could be used against the Tsurani, Makala set out to investigate what really happened at the battle of Sethanon. He manipulates Delekhan and the moredhel, using their attack as a diversion so that he can enter Sethanon unhindered.\n\n; Narab and Nago\n: The brothers Narab and Nago are magicians who serve Delekhan. Nago has infiltrated the Kingdom and coordinates moredhel spies from a secret location near Sarth. Narab has fallen out of favor with Delekhan, and seeking to regain his position in Delekhan's inner circle, captures Owyn and Gorath for him. However, Delekhan is displeased with what he has done so Narab turns on his former master and helps Owyn and Gorath escape. He then plans on becoming leader of the moredhel himself.\n\n; Navon du Sandau\n: To most he is simply a charismatic young merchant, but Navon is actually Neville Corvalis, the half-brother of Owyn's cousin Ugyne. When Ugyne's father Count Corvalis found out that Neville was his wife's illegitimate son, he arranged to have Neville killed in a wine cellar collapse. Though he was believed dead, Neville's body was never found. He was found by Nighthawks who had regrouped in Cavall after their destruction in Krondor by Prince Arutha (''A Darkness at Sethanon''). Using a Corvalis family heirloom, a magical spyglass, Neville convinced them he had magical powers and became their leader. He then set about exacting revenge on Count Corvalis, burning down the keep so the caverns underneath could be used as a Nighthawk hideout and courting Ugyne so he could take over her family's fortune.\n\n==Locations==\n\n===Midkemia===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Betrayal at Krondor-MidkemiaMap.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Midkemia, the Kingdom of the Isles, the Northlands, and Elvandar \u2013 as shown on the paper map included with Betrayal at Krondor|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Sunday, 11 October 2009|date=May 2012}}]] -->\n\n; Cavall Keep\n: (Accessible in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6) Cavall Keep is a small eastern farming town in the Kenting Hills ruled by Owyn's uncle, Count Geoffrey Corvalis. The keep burned down mysteriously three years ago, preventing access to the caverns underneath, which run south to the waterfall known as Cavall Run.\n\n; [[Elvandar]]\n: (Accessible in Chapter 6) The forest city of Elvandar, home of the eledhel (the light elves), lies far to the northwest of the duchy of Yabon and is ruled by Queen Aglaranna and Prince Consort Tomas. Though isolated and well-protected, the Tsurani attacked Elvandar during the Riftwar and there are still skirmishes with the moredhel on its northern borders.\n\n; Highcastle\n: (Accessible in Chapters 1, 2, 3) The frontier fort town of Highcastle guards Cutter's Gap, one of the four passes between the Kingdom and the Northlands. Overrun by the moredhel during the Great Rising (''A Darkness at Sethanon''), Prince Arutha had the fortifications reinforced in recent years. Highcastle is currently commanded by Baron Baldwin de la Troville and, in his absence, Baron Kevin of Zun.\n\n; Krondor\n: (Accessible in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6) Capital of the Western Realm of the Kingdom of the Isles, Krondor is the traditional home of the heir apparent to the throne. It is currently ruled by Prince Arutha and Princess Anita, though the sewers under the city are a maze of tunnels known as the Thieves' Highway and controlled by the Mockers, the thieves' guild of Krondor, and their mysterious leader, the Upright Man.\n\n; LaMut\n: (Accessible in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6) The city of LaMut is located in the duchy of Yabon, near the reopened rift to Kelewan. It is ruled by the Earl Kasumi and home to a large Tsurani population that settled there after the Riftwar.\n[[File:BaK Midkemia map.gif|left|thumb|200px|The in-game map of Midkemia]]\n\n; Malac's Cross\n: (Accessible in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6) The city of Malac's Cross marks the eastern boundary of the Western Realm and is home to the Abbaye Ishap, an ancient temple currently run by the Abbot Graves. Outside of the city, where the old city once stood, is a statue of a dragon, built as a tribute to Malac, from which the Oracle of Aal can be contacted.\n\n; Northwarden\n: (Accessible in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 5) The fortress of Northwarden lies on a narrow mountain path overlooking one of the four passes between the Kingdom and the Northlands. Northwarden is currently commanded by Baron Gabot.\n\n; Romney\n: (Accessible in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6) Located on the river Rom, the eastern city of Romney is known as the City of Guilds. Although ruled by Duke Romney, control of the city lies with its various merchant guilds, leading to the occasional guild war.\n\n; Sarth\n: (Accessible in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6) The town of Sarth is home to an ancient mountaintop fortress which was converted into an abbey and library by the Order of Ishap. The vaults have hundreds of thousands of books, containing a wealth of knowledge about the history and lore of Midkemia, tended to by Brother Anthony and Brother Marc. Beneath the vaults is an abandoned dwarven emerald mine known as the Mac Bourgalan Dok.\n\n; Sar-Isbandia (Armengar)\n: (Accessible in Chapter 4) The fortress city of Sar-Isbandia was built atop miles of naphtha tunnels long ago by the glamredhel (the mad elves) before they were obliterated by the moredhel (the dark elves). Located in the Vale of Isbandia north of the Inclindel Gap, humans from Yabon settled in the city hundreds of years ago, renamed it Armengar and became lifelong enemies of the moredhel. The Armengarians were among Murmandamus' first targets during the Great Rising so Prince Arutha and Guy du Bas-Tyra, the city's Protector, evacuated the city and attempted to destroy Murmandamus' army by incinerating the city (''A Darkness at Sethanon''). Recently, moredhel have moved into the ruins and started to rebuild.\n\n; Sar-Sargoth\n: (Accessible in Chapter 4) Twin city of Sar-Isbandia, the fortress city of Sar-Sargoth to the north was also built by the glamredhel and was taken by the moredhel as their capital. The tunnels beneath the city are home to Delekhan's dungeons while the outskirts are lined with pikes bearing the heads of his enemies.\n\n; Sethanon\n: (Surface ruins accessible in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6, underground ruins only accessible in Chapter 9) Once a minor barony in the heart of the Kingdom, Sethanon was poorly defended and completely destroyed during the Great Rising (''A Darkness at Sethanon''). Coincidentally built above the ancient Valheru ruins containing the Lifestone, King Lyam and Prince Arutha ordered the city abandoned after the Battle of Sethanon, ostensibly as a memorial to those who had died there, and stationed a secret garrison nearby to protect it. Within the ruins beneath the city lies the Lifestone and its guardian, the dragon Ryath, whose mind contains the Oracle of Aal.\n\n; Silden\n: (Accessible in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6) The eastern fishing town of Silden is a seaport on the Kingdom Sea. Located on a nearby island off the coast is the temple of Eortis, the dead god of the sea. Known for its shady underworld, someone known only as The Crawler has recently establish himself within the city, disrupting business for both the Mockers in Krondor and the guilds in Romney.\n\n===Timirianya===\n: (Accessible in Chapter 8) The desolate world of Timirianya was destroyed by the Valheru and is currently inhabited by Panath-Tiandn, humanoid serpents akin to [[Pantathians]]. During the Chaos Wars, the gods of Timirianya crystallized magic into solid manna, causing the Valheru to leave when they thought the world's energy was depleted. In order to cast magic on Timirianya, one must use a crystal staff and keep it charged with raw manna.\n\n; The Temple of Karzeen Mauk\n: Located in the north, all that remains of the high temple of the gods of Timirianya are nine pillars, within which the surviving gods have taken refuge. Only Dhatsavan, Lord of Gates, still has enough power left to communicate with visitors.\n\n; The Temple of Dhatsavan (Riftworld Mine)\n: Also known as the Riftworld Mine, the ruins of the temple are buried underground and are currently occupied by Panath-Tiandn. After Makala abducts her, Gamina is imprisoned in a crystal cage within the ruins.\n\n==Plot==\nTen years after ''[[A Darkness at Sethanon]]'', Seigneur Locklear is serving at a northern Kingdom garrison when he saves Gorath of the Ardanien from an assassin. Gorath has brought a warning of an invasion planned by Delekhan, leader of the moredhel, so Locklear agrees to take him to see Prince Arutha in Krondor. Injured from numerous attacks, they ask for help from Owyn Beleforte, a young magician from Tiburn. The game begins in their camp north of LaMut.\n\n===Chapter I: Into A Dark Night===\nOwyn is bandaging Gorath's and Locklear's injuries when they are attacked by a moredhel assassin whom Gorath dispatches before the three of them set out south. Surviving multiple assassination attempts, they eventually reach Krondor. Finding the palace gates sabotaged, they enter the palace via the sewers with Seigneur James' help. Upon meeting Prince Arutha, another moredhel assassin sneaks in and attempts to kill Gorath, only to be foiled by Pug.\n\n===Chapter II: Shadow Of The Nighthawks===\nGorath informs Arutha of Delekhan's plans, but Arutha does not trust him because he does not know the location of the attack. Gorath thinks they can find out by intercepting Delekhan's Nighthawk spies in Romney. Arutha arranges for James to escort Gorath to Romney and meet with a group of the king's soldiers investigating recent Nighthawk activity in the east. Arutha will muster his army and await word of where the attack will occur. James, Owyn, and Gorath secretly slip out of the city through the sewers and head east. Arriving at the tavern in Romney, they discover that the king's soldiers have all been murdered.\n\n===Chapter III: The Spyglass And The Spider===\nTwo clues were left behind at the murder scene: an enchanted spyglass and a silver spider. James, Owyn, and Gorath follow the trail of the spyglass and the spider north to Cavall Keep and uncover the leader of the Nighthawks, the merchant Navon du Sandau. After killing him, they enter the Nighthawks' hideout in the caverns beneath Cavall Keep, where they learn that Delekhan plans to attack Northwarden. Realizing that Nighthawks probably infiltrated the fortress, they split up. James heads to Northwarden while Owyn and Gorath head south to warn Arutha. Before they can reach Arutha though, Owyn and Gorath are captured by Narab, one of Delekhan's chieftains.\n\n===Chapter IV: Marked For Death===\nGorath and Owyn are taken to Sar-Sargoth, where Narab presents them to Delekhan. Delekhan, enraged that Narab has ruined his plans, tells him his life is forfeit. Narab turns on Delekhan and, unbeknownst to them, frees Owyn and Gorath. They escape Sar-Sargoth and head south to the Inclindel Gap, where they meet a Kingdom patrol and are taken to Arutha's camp. Learning of the impending attack on Northwarden, Arutha readies his army and sends Owyn and Gorath to Krondor to seek Pug's help in case the moredhel employ magic.\n\n===Chapter V: When Rivers Run Blood===\nJames and Locklear arrive at Northwarden and are sent by Baron Gabot to find his magical adviser Patrus. The three of them help Duke Martin prepare for the attack by poisoning moredhel food supplies, finding the minstrel Tamney, stealing the moredhel battle plans, and killing six moredhel magicians hiding behind Kingdom lines. Returning to Northwarden as the moredhel siege begins, they discover that Nighthawks have murdered Baron Gabot, leaving James in command. The battle goes badly and they are about to be overrun when Arutha arrives with his army in time to drive off the moredhel.\n\n===Chapter VI: Betrayal===\nMakala visits Pug in Krondor, telling him that Gamina is considered an abomination by the Assembly of Magicians and that he has imprisoned her until her fate can be decided. Pug is enraged at Makala's betrayal and vows to find her, blasting the words \"The Book Of Macros\" into the wall. When Katala is unable to find him or their daughter, she discovers his message and informs Owyn and Gorath. Following clues from the libraries at Sarth and the Abbaye Ishap, Owyn and Gorath head west to Elvandar, where Gorath completes his \"Returning\" and pledges his allegiance to Queen Aglaranna and Prince Consort Tomas. Tomas shows them the Book of Macros, a gift from Pug to find him should he leave the message to do so. Recently injured by a poisoned blade in a moredhel skirmish, Tomas asks Owyn and Gorath to go in his stead. Owyn and Gorath read the book, which teleports them into the unknown.\n\n===Chapter VII: The Long Ride===\nIn Northwarden, the moredhel raiding leader is captured and reveals that they plan to use a rift machine in the Dimwood to bypass Arutha's army, enter Sethanon, and free Murmandamus, whom they believe is alive and imprisoned there. Realizing that the attack was a diversion engineered by Makala, Arutha orders his troops to Sethanon and instructs James, Locklear, and Patrus to find and destroy the rift machine. After learning that the machine can be disrupted by a Tsurani device called a Waani, they find the machine and disable it. However, as the rift collapses, it pulls in everything nearby before exploding. James and Locklear grab onto trees but Patrus is sucked into the collapsing rift and is apparently killed. At the same moment, three figures appear in a flash of purple light.\n\n===Chapter VIII: Of Lands Afar===\nOwyn and Gorath are teleported to Timirianya, where Owyn realizes that magic does not work and Pug would be powerless. Owyn and Gorath eventually find Pug, who has figured out that by abducting Gamina and manipulating Delekhan, Makala has lured Pug away from Midkemia and Arutha's army away from Sethanon and is free to enter Sethanon unopposed and seek out the Lifestone. Using the Cup of Rlnn Skrr, Owyn restores Pug's powers and they find Gamina imprisoned in a crystal cage in the underground ruins of the Temple of Dhatsavan. Gorath smashes the cage and, using a special pattern stone Pug has brought, the four of them return to Midkemia.\n\n===Chapter IX: Mad Gods Rage===\nIn a flash of purple light, Pug, Owyn, and Gorath appear before James and Locklear in the Dimwood and tell them to wait for Arutha and let him know that there is no magical threat to his army; Makala will be waiting for Pug at Sethanon. Pug, Owyn, and Gorath travel to the caverns beneath Sethanon and kill the Tsurani Great Ones (\"the Six\") protecting the Lifestone Chamber. Gorath remains behind to protect the Oracle of Aal, which was incapacitated by Makala, while Pug and Owyn confront the magician. Makala believes that Pug was keeping the Lifestone hidden to use as a weapon and wants it destroyed, but Pug refuses because it would release the Valheru souls trapped inside. Engaging Makala in a magical battle, Pug and Owyn eventually kill him.\n\nAfterward, Gorath enters the chamber locked in combat with Delekhan. When Delekhan reaches for the Lifestone, Gorath tries to stop him and they begin to transform as the Valheru within try to escape. Pug and Owyn are forced to kill them both with a blast of magic in order to prevent the Valheru from being released. Returning above ground, Pug creates magical illusions of Murmandamus and Delekhan which are then incinerated by the Oracle of Aal. Having seen their leaders killed, the moredhel retreat, during which Narab kills Delekhan's son Moraeulf, fulfilling his plans for taking over the moredhel. Owyn is left alone with Pug, who reveals that since Owyn now knows about the Lifestone, Pug must ensure that the secret is safe and suggests that Owyn become one of his students at Stardock. Owyn laughs and replies that he's never wanted anything else.\n\n==Development==\nAlthough the game was licensed from Raymond E. Feist, a long-held myth was that the text and the story of the game were actually created by Feist himself. Feist states in his afterword to ''Krondor: The Betrayal'' that he was busy writing ''[[Krondor's Sons#The King's Buccaneer|The King's Buccaneer]]'' during the game's production and that the plot, text, and new characters were created solely by designers [[Neal Hallford]] and John Cutter. Feist did have editorial final say on the game, but most of what Hallford and Cutter created was left intact.\n\n===Technical details===\nThe game runs in 256-color 320x200 [[Video Graphics Array|VGA mode]]. The graphics engine uses [[texture mapping|texture]]d [[3D graphics]] to draw the terrain and uses [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] for most of the detailed objects. The engine does not support multilevel terrain as such, but obstacles such as hills and mountains are supported. Most shops, inns, temples, special locations, and large cities are navigated though pictures usable through [[Screen hotspot|hotspots]], while smaller towns have 3D buildings.\n\n[[Non-player character|NPC]] and character art is based on photographs. Environments are a mix of captured images and hand-drawn. In combat and puzzle screens, all characters are animated, except for movement - characters do not appear to move their legs while walking. The game models illuminate to a certain extent: in the overworld, day and night are modeled, and in underground locations, the player needs to use a torch or a light spell to illuminate their surroundings.\n\nThe game runs in [[protected mode]], using [[Borland C++]]'s Ergo [[DOS Protected Mode Interface|DPMI]] / RTM  [[DOS extender]].<ref>String in krondor.exe: \"Borland C++ - Copyright 1991 Borland Intl.\"</ref> It remained quite compatible with [[Microsoft Windows]] up to the 9x series and works very well in [[DOSBox]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dosbox.sourceforge.net/comp_list.php?showID=115&letter=B |title=Betrayal at Krondor DOSBox compatibility report |author=Harekiet |accessdate=2006-11-27 }}</ref> and [[VDMSound]].

Feist#The Riftwar Legacy|The Riftwar Legacy]]''. Feist credited Hallford and Cutter as co-authors of the original story for ''Krondor: the Betrayal'', and dedicated the book to both of them.\n\nThe game and book are set approximately halfway between ''[[A Darkness at Sethanon]]'' and ''[[Prince of the Blood (novel)|Prince of the Blood]]''. There are minor differences, such as Owyn's last name being Belefote rather than Beleforte and the towns of Tanneurs and Eggley are changed to Tannerus and Eggly, but the novel largely covers the main plot of the game accurately and ignores most of the sidequests.\n\nThe game first introduced Lysle Rigger, Jimmy the Hand's long lost twin brother as well as Kat and Abbot Graves, whose granddaughter was Katherine \"Kitty\" Graves. Both Lysle Rigger and Kitty Graves would play significant roles in Feist's [[Raymond E. Feist#The Serpentwar Saga|Serpentwar]] novels.\n\n==Reception==\nSales of the original 3\u00bd\" floppy disk release were slow, leading Sierra to sell the ''Riftwar'' rights back to Raymond Feist, but the game became a hit when it was re-released on CD-ROM.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Antara|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|pages=50\u201351}}</ref>\n\n''[[Pelit]]'' gave ''Betrayal at Krondor'' a 94% score, calling the game citing \"the wonderful game system, lack of bugs, and the book-like atmosphere\" and said \"Krondor is as big a revolution in turn-based role-playing games as the ''[[Ultima Underworld|Underworld]]''s were in 3D role-playing games.\"<ref>{{cite news |first=Niko |last=Nirvi |author2=Ossi M\u00e4ntylahti |title=Betrayal at Krondor |url=http://www.pelit.fi/index.php?id=60360 |work=[[Pelit]] |publisher=Sanoma Magazines |date=May 1993 |accessdate=2007-01-03 |issn=1235-1199 |language=Finnish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215140510/http://www.pelit.fi/index.php?id=60360 |archivedate=2007-12-15 }}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in October 1993 called ''Krondor'' \"a fantasy role-playing game unlike any other ... a new high-watermark in RPG design\".

Monsarrat ended the war as commander of a frigate, and drew on his wartime experience in his postwar [[sea stories]]. It has been alleged that during his wartime service, Monsarrat claimed to have seen the [[ghost ship]] ''[[Flying Dutchman]]'' while sailing the Pacific, near the location where the young [[King George V]] had seen her in 1881. No mention was made of this in his autobiographies however, and the ship he was supposedly serving on (HMS ''Jubilee'') did not, in fact, exist.\n\nResigning his wartime commission in 1946, Monsarrat entered the diplomatic service.

The story of a young, idealistic, aspiring writer coming to grips with the \"real world\" for the first time, it is at least partly autobiographical.\n\n''The Cruel Sea'' (1951), Monsarrat's first postwar novel, is widely regarded as his finest work, and is the only one of his novels that is still widely read. Based on his own wartime service, it followed the young naval officer Keith Lockhart through a series of postings in corvettes and frigates. It was one of the first novels to depict life aboard the vital, but unglamorous, \"small ships\" of World War II\u2014ships for which the sea was as much a threat as the Germans. Monsarrat's short-story collections ''H.M.S. Marlborough Will Enter Harbour'' (1949), and ''The Ship That Died of Shame'' (1959, made into a film of the [[The Ship That Died of Shame|same name]]), mined the same literary vein, and gained popularity by association with ''The Cruel Sea''.\n\nThe similar ''Three Corvettes'' (1945 and 1953) comprising ''H.M. Corvette'' (set aboard a Flower-class corvette in the [[North Atlantic]]), ''East Coast Corvette'' (as First Lieutenant of HMS ''Guillemot'') and ''Corvette Command'' (as Commanding Officer of {{HMS|Shearwater|L39|6}}) is actually an anthology of three true-experience stories he published during the war years and shows appropriate care for what the [[Censorship|Censor]] might say. Thus ''Guillemot'' appears under the pseudonym ''Dipper'' and ''Shearwater'' under the pseudonym ''Winger'' in the book. ''H M Frigate'' is similar but deals with his time in command of two frigates. His use of the name ''[[Dipper]]'' could allude to his formative years when summer holidays were spent with his family at [[Trearddur Bay]]. They were members of the famous sailing club based there, and he recounted much of this part of his life in a book ''My brother Denys''. Denys Monsarrat was killed in [[Egypt]] during the middle part of the war whilst his brother was serving with the Royal Navy. Another tale recounts his bringing his ship into [[Trearddur Bay]] during the war for old times' sake.\n\nMonsarrat's more famous novels, notably ''The Tribe That Lost Its Head'' (1956) and its sequel ''Richer Than All His Tribe'' (1968), drew on his experience in the diplomatic service and make important reference to the [[Colonialism|colonial]] experience of Britain in Africa. Several have peripheral connections to the sea: ''The Nylon Pirates'' (1960) tells a story of piracy aboard a modern ocean liner, not pirates in the traditional meaning of the word, but card-sharps, and ''A Fair Day's Work'' (1964) deals with labour unrest in a shipyard. ''The Kappillan of Malta'' (1973) is as much a story of a place, the island of [[Malta]], as it is of a priest on that island during the terrible days of World War II.\n\nHis book ''The Story of Esther Costello'' (1952), later made into a film \nof the [[The Story of Esther Costello|same name]], while perceived as an uncomplimentary take on the life of [[Helen Keller]] and her teachers and assistants, is really an expos\u00e9 of sleazy practices and exploitation of real causes in the fundraising racket, similar to criticisms of [[televangelism]].<ref>[http://www.filmsofcrawford.com/id112.html]{{dead link|date=March 2018}}</ref> It caused a minor public outcry when it first appeared, and Keller's staff considered suing him, then tried to keep the book off the shelves.<ref>Lash, Joseph, ''Helen and Teacher'', Addison Wesley 1997, pp. 732\u2013738.</ref>\n\nHis final work, unfinished at the time of his death but published in its incomplete form, was a two-volume historical novel titled ''The Master Mariner.'' Based on the legend of the [[Wandering Jew]], it told the story of an [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] English seaman who, as punishment for a terrible act of cowardice, is doomed to sail the world's seas until the end of time. His hero participates in critical moments in history; Monsarrat used him to illustrate the central role of seamen.\n\n===Autobiography===\nTwo non-fiction books, ''Life is a Four Letter Word: Breaking In'' (London, 1966) and ''Life is a Four Letter Word: Breaking Out'' (London, 1970) comprise Monsarrat's autobiography.\n\n==Death==\nNicholas Monsarrat died of cancer on 8 August 1979 in London.<ref name=\"obit\">{{cite web|last1=Pace|first1=Eric|title=Nicholas Monsarrat, Novelist, Dies; Wrote War Epic 'The Cruel Sea'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/09/archives/nicholas-monsarrat-novelist-dies-wrote-war-epic-the-cruel-sea-wrote.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=20 April 2017|page=17|date=4 Aug 1979}}</ref> The [[Royal Navy]] co-operated with his wish to be buried at sea.\n\nThe two naval ratings responsible for the lifting of the cask at his burial were AB Graham Savage and AB Stephen Knight, aboard [[HMS Scylla (F71)]].\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{div col}}\n* ''Think of Tomorrow'' (1934)\n* ''At First Sight'' (1935)\n* ''The Whipping Boy'' (1937)\n* ''This is the Schoolroom'' (1939)\n* ''The Visitor'' \u2013 play\n* ''H.M.

It has been alleged that during his wartime service, Monsarrat claimed to have seen the [[ghost ship]] ''[[Flying Dutchman]]'' while sailing the Pacific, near the location where the young [[King George V]] had seen her in 1881. No mention was made of this in his autobiographies however, and the ship he was supposedly serving on (HMS ''Jubilee'') did not, in fact, exist.\n\nResigning his wartime commission in 1946, Monsarrat entered the diplomatic service. He was posted at first to [[Johannesburg]], South Africa and then, in 1953, to [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], Canada.<ref name=\"obit\"/> He turned to writing full-time in 1959, settling first on [[Guernsey]], in the [[Channel Islands]], and later on the [[Malta|Maltese]] island of [[Gozo]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=J.

''The Visitor'', his only play, fell into the same category.<ref name=\"people\">{{cite web|last1=Hauptfuhrer|first1=Fred|title=To Ann and Nicholas Monsarrat, the Sea Is Never Cruel: It Inspires His Fiction and Their Idyll|url=http://people.com/archive/to-ann-and-nicholas-monsarrat-the-sea-is-never-cruel-it-inspires-his-fiction-and-their-idyll-vol-12-no-1/|website=People|publisher=People|accessdate=20 April 2017|date=2 July 1979}}</ref> His fourth novel and first major work, ''This is the Schoolroom'', took a different approach. The story of a young, idealistic, aspiring writer coming to grips with the \"real world\" for the first time, it is at least partly autobiographical.\n\n''The Cruel Sea'' (1951), Monsarrat's first postwar novel, is widely regarded as his finest work, and is the only one of his novels that is still widely read. Based on his own wartime service, it followed the young naval officer Keith Lockhart through a series of postings in corvettes and frigates. It was one of the first novels to depict life aboard the vital, but unglamorous, \"small ships\" of World War II\u2014ships for which the sea was as much a threat as the Germans. Monsarrat's short-story collections ''H.M.S. Marlborough Will Enter Harbour'' (1949), and ''The Ship That Died of Shame'' (1959, made into a film of the [[The Ship That Died of Shame|same name]]), mined the same literary vein, and gained popularity by association with ''The Cruel Sea''.\n\nThe similar ''Three Corvettes'' (1945 and 1953) comprising ''H.M. Corvette'' (set aboard a Flower-class corvette in the [[North Atlantic]]), ''East Coast Corvette'' (as First Lieutenant of HMS ''Guillemot'') and ''Corvette Command'' (as Commanding Officer of {{HMS|Shearwater|L39|6}}) is actually an anthology of three true-experience stories he published during the war years and shows appropriate care for what the [[Censorship|Censor]] might say. Thus ''Guillemot'' appears under the pseudonym ''Dipper'' and ''Shearwater'' under the pseudonym ''Winger'' in the book. ''H M Frigate'' is similar but deals with his time in command of two frigates. His use of the name ''[[Dipper]]'' could allude to his formative years when summer holidays were spent with his family at [[Trearddur Bay]]. They were members of the famous sailing club based there, and he recounted much of this part of his life in a book ''My brother Denys''. Denys Monsarrat was killed in [[Egypt]] during the middle part of the war whilst his brother was serving with the Royal Navy. Another tale recounts his bringing his ship into [[Trearddur Bay]] during the war for old times' sake.\n\nMonsarrat's more famous novels, notably ''The Tribe That Lost Its Head'' (1956) and its sequel ''Richer Than All His Tribe'' (1968), drew on his experience in the diplomatic service and make important reference to the [[Colonialism|colonial]] experience of Britain in Africa. Several have peripheral connections to the sea: ''The Nylon Pirates'' (1960) tells a story of piracy aboard a modern ocean liner, not pirates in the traditional meaning of the word, but card-sharps, and ''A Fair Day's Work'' (1964) deals with labour unrest in a shipyard. ''The Kappillan of Malta'' (1973) is as much a story of a place, the island of [[Malta]], as it is of a priest on that island during the terrible days of World War II.\n\nHis book ''The Story of Esther Costello'' (1952), later made into a film \nof the [[The Story of Esther Costello|same name]], while perceived as an uncomplimentary take on the life of [[Helen Keller]] and her teachers and assistants, is really an expos\u00e9 of sleazy practices and exploitation of real causes in the fundraising racket, similar to criticisms of [[televangelism]].<ref>[http://www.filmsofcrawford.com/id112.html]{{dead link|date=March 2018}}</ref> It caused a minor public outcry when it first appeared, and Keller's staff considered suing him, then tried to keep the book off the shelves.<ref>Lash, Joseph, ''Helen and Teacher'', Addison Wesley 1997, pp. 732\u2013738.</ref>\n\nHis final work, unfinished at the time of his death but published in its incomplete form, was a two-volume historical novel titled ''The Master Mariner.'' Based on the legend of the [[Wandering Jew]], it told the story of an [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] English seaman who, as punishment for a terrible act of cowardice, is doomed to sail the world's seas until the end of time. His hero participates in critical moments in history; Monsarrat used him to illustrate the central role of seamen.\n\n===Autobiography===\nTwo non-fiction books, ''Life is a Four Letter Word: Breaking In'' (London, 1966) and ''Life is a Four Letter Word: Breaking Out'' (London, 1970) comprise Monsarrat's autobiography.\n\n==Death==\nNicholas Monsarrat died of cancer on 8 August 1979 in London.<ref name=\"obit\">{{cite web|last1=Pace|first1=Eric|title=Nicholas Monsarrat, Novelist, Dies; Wrote War Epic 'The Cruel Sea'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/09/archives/nicholas-monsarrat-novelist-dies-wrote-war-epic-the-cruel-sea-wrote.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=20 April 2017|page=17|date=4 Aug 1979}}</ref> The [[Royal Navy]] co-operated with his wish to be buried at sea.\n\nThe two naval ratings responsible for the lifting of the cask at his burial were AB Graham Savage and AB Stephen Knight, aboard [[HMS Scylla (F71)]].\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{div col}}\n* ''Think of Tomorrow'' (1934)\n* ''At First Sight'' (1935)\n* ''The Whipping Boy'' (1937)\n* ''This is the Schoolroom'' (1939)\n* ''The Visitor'' \u2013 play\n* ''H.M.
