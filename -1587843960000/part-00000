It is quicker than few premier rajdhani trains on DDU-NDLS section.  \n\nSampoorna Kranti Express is also currently the fastest train in the Superfast category of Indian Railways. The train makes only three stops between Patna and New Delhi: at [[Kanpur Central]], [[Mirzapur]] and [[Mughalsarai, Varanasi|Mughalsarai]](also known as [[Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Junction  ]]). The train is hauled by [[WAP4 Engine|WAP7 Engine]]. It has LHB coaches. It is now operated on HOG system (Hotel Load) in which the power to coaches is provided directly from locomotive instead of EOGs (Power Cars). It is the first superfast train in India to have a LHB Rake. During its run with ICF coaches it ran with the maximum length permitted in Indian Railway of 24 coaches.

It provided support to land forces, carrying out [[reconnaissance]] and mounting air raids between other missions.\n\n==Insignia==\nThe insignia of the FARR was a yellow cross ([[Michael I of Romania|King Michael\u2019s]] monogram cross) in the fuselage and upper and lower wings, and the [[national colours]] on the tail, with a yellow engine cowling and vertical band on the fuselage. It was later changed at tricolor (red-yellow-blue) roundels on the fuselage and wings, and a tricolor band on the tail.\n\n==History==\nFARR flew aircraft from Germany and Italy, with their own and other foreign aircraft, as well as captured enemy aircraft. The Royal Romanian Air Force fought against the [[Hungarian Air Force|Magyar Kir\u00e1lyi Honv\u00e9d L\u00e9gier\u00f6]] (Royal Hungarian Air Force) during the Hungarian annexation of [[Transylvania]]. The most basic unit of their formations was the squadron (''Grup''). The Romanian Air Force fought alongside the [[Luftwaffe]] during the advance into the [[Ukraine]] and [[Crimea]], until the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], when the Southern Luftwaffe Command was installed in [[Bucharest]]. It also carried out some reconnaissance and patrol missions over the [[Black Sea]] alongside [[Bulgaria]]n units. The Romanian Air Force  was tasked with the air defence of the [[Ploie\u015fti]] oil installations, and also Bucharest against [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] air raids, and to protect Axis convoys in the Black Sea. These units fought against the [[USAAF]] and [[RAF]] during their raids against Romania.\n\nThe main models of aircraft used include the [[PZL P.24]]F, [[Hawker Hurricane]], [[Heinkel He 112]], [[Messerschmitt 109]]E and G types, [[Messerschmitt 110]] (for night defence), [[IAR 80]]A were used too, alongside other types of interceptors used by the [[Luftwaffe]] units in area.\n\nWhen the country was invaded by Soviet forces, King [[Michael of Romania|Mihai I]] (Michael) ordered Romanian forces to attack Axis forces, and the FARR was allied with Soviet [[Voenno-vozdushniye Sily]] against [[Germany|German]] and [[Hungary|Hungarian]] forces in [[Transylvania]] and [[Slovakia]], though some units continued to fight with the Axis in Luftwaffe volunteer units.\n\n==Romanian Air Aces==\n[[File:Rum\u00e4nien Oberstleutnant-dL C\u0103pitan-Comandor AbendanzugRock 1930-40.jpg|thumb|Dress uniform of a wing commander (\u201cC\u0103pitan-Comandor\u201d) 1930-40.]]\n* [[Horia Agarici]]\n* [[Constantin Cantacuzino (aviator)|Constantin Cantacuzino]]\n* Cristea Chirv\u0103su\u0163\u0103\n* [[Ion Dicezare]]\n* Tudor Greceanu\n* Ioan Maga\n* Ioan M\u0103l\u0103cescu\n* [[Ion Milu]]\n* [[Ion Mucenica]]\n* Constantin Lungulescu\n* [[Alexandru \u015eerb\u0103nescu]]\n* Daniel Vizanty\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:Ju-88 D-1 Trop 2.jpg|thumb|200px|A preserved [[Junkers Ju 88]] in the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]], painted with the Romanian markings it carried during World War II]]\n*Grupul 3\u00b0 Picaj, Corpul 2\u00b0 Aerian, Luftflotte 4, South [[Russia]] Front, Winter of 1943-44.\n*Grupul 3\u00b0 Picaj, Corpul 1\u00b0 Aerian, [[B\u0103r\u0103ganul|Cioara-Dolcesti]], Romania August 1944; under orders of Luftwaffe, Luftflotte Kommando 4 with commands in [[Debrecen]], [[Hungary]].\n*6th Fighter Group\n*7th Fighter Group\n*8th Fighter Group (1941\u20131943)\n*9th Fighter Group\n*5th Bomber Group\n\n==Aircraft companies==\n* [[Societatea Pentru Exploat\u0103ri Tehnice]] (SET), 1923, [[Bucharest]]\n* [[Industria Aeronautic\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103]] (IAR), 1925, [[Bra\u015fov]]\n* [[\u00centreprinderea de Construc\u021bii Aeronautice Rom\u00e2ne\u0219ti]] (ICAR), 1932, [[Bucharest]]\n\n'''Aircraft constructed under foreign license'''\n* [[Heinkel He 111]] H (30 examples by Brasov)\n* [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]G (15 109G-4a and 60 109G-6a IAR built examples by Brasov (1944-1947))\n* [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79]]JR (76 examples by Brasov)\n* [[PZL P.11]]f (80 examples by IAR)\n* [[PZL P.24]]E (50 examples by IAR)\n* [[IAR 36]] (Messerschmitt design) (5 examples by IAR)\n\n==Enemy aircraft interned or captured==\n{{Further information|List of aircraft of the Romanian Air Force#Interned or captured}}\nAs a result of the [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Soviet Invasion of Poland]], a large number of [[Polish Air Force]] aircraft were [[List of aircraft of the Romanian Air Force#Interned or captured|interned]] in Romania.

was officially named the '''Aeronautica Regala Romana''' ('''ARR'''), or the Romanian Royal Aeronautics, though it is more commonly referred to in English histories as the '''For\u0163ele Aeriene Regale ale Rom\u00e2niei''' (Royal Romanian Air Force, '''FARR'''), or simply '''For\u0163ele Aeriene Rom\u00e2ne''' ([[Romanian Air Force]]). It provided support to land forces, carrying out [[reconnaissance]] and mounting air raids between other missions.\n\n==Insignia==\nThe insignia of the FARR was a yellow cross ([[Michael I of Romania|King Michael\u2019s]] monogram cross) in the fuselage and upper and lower wings, and the [[national colours]] on the tail, with a yellow engine cowling and vertical band on the fuselage. It was later changed at tricolor (red-yellow-blue) roundels on the fuselage and wings, and a tricolor band on the tail.\n\n==History==\nFARR flew aircraft from Germany and Italy, with their own and other foreign aircraft, as well as captured enemy aircraft. The Royal Romanian Air Force fought against the [[Hungarian Air Force|Magyar Kir\u00e1lyi Honv\u00e9d L\u00e9gier\u00f6]] (Royal Hungarian Air Force) during the Hungarian annexation of [[Transylvania]]. The most basic unit of their formations was the squadron (''Grup''). The Romanian Air Force fought alongside the [[Luftwaffe]] during the advance into the [[Ukraine]] and [[Crimea]], until the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], when the Southern Luftwaffe Command was installed in [[Bucharest]]. It also carried out some reconnaissance and patrol missions over the [[Black Sea]] alongside [[Bulgaria]]n units. The Romanian Air Force  was tasked with the air defence of the [[Ploie\u015fti]] oil installations, and also Bucharest against [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] air raids, and to protect Axis convoys in the Black Sea. These units fought against the [[USAAF]] and [[RAF]] during their raids against Romania.\n\nThe main models of aircraft used include the [[PZL P.24]]F, [[Hawker Hurricane]], [[Heinkel He 112]], [[Messerschmitt 109]]E and G types, [[Messerschmitt 110]] (for night defence), [[IAR 80]]A were used too, alongside other types of interceptors used by the [[Luftwaffe]] units in area.\n\nWhen the country was invaded by Soviet forces, King [[Michael of Romania|Mihai I]] (Michael) ordered Romanian forces to attack Axis forces, and the FARR was allied with Soviet [[Voenno-vozdushniye Sily]] against [[Germany|German]] and [[Hungary|Hungarian]] forces in [[Transylvania]] and [[Slovakia]], though some units continued to fight with the Axis in Luftwaffe volunteer units.\n\n==Romanian Air Aces==\n[[File:Rum\u00e4nien Oberstleutnant-dL C\u0103pitan-Comandor AbendanzugRock 1930-40.jpg|thumb|Dress uniform of a wing commander (\u201cC\u0103pitan-Comandor\u201d) 1930-40.]]\n* [[Horia Agarici]]\n* [[Constantin Cantacuzino (aviator)|Constantin Cantacuzino]]\n* Cristea Chirv\u0103su\u0163\u0103\n* Ion Di Cesare\n* Tudor Greceanu\n* Ioan Maga\n* Ioan M\u0103l\u0103cescu\n* Ion Milu\n* Ioan Mucenica\n* Constantin Lungulescu\n* [[Alexandru \u015eerb\u0103nescu]]\n* Daniel Vizanty\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:Ju-88 D-1 Trop 2.jpg|thumb|200px|A preserved [[Junkers Ju 88]] in the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]], painted with the Romanian markings it carried during World War II]]\n*Grupul 3\u00b0 Picaj, Corpul 2\u00b0 Aerian, Luftflotte 4, South [[Russia]] Front, Winter of 1943-44.\n*Grupul 3\u00b0 Picaj, Corpul 1\u00b0 Aerian, [[B\u0103r\u0103ganul|Cioara-Dolcesti]], Romania August 1944; under orders of Luftwaffe, Luftflotte Kommando 4 with commands in [[Debrecen]], [[Hungary]].\n*6th Fighter Group\n*7th Fighter Group\n*8th Fighter Group (1941\u20131943)\n*9th Fighter Group\n*5th Bomber Group\n\n==Aircraft companies==\n* [[Societatea Pentru Exploat\u0103ri Tehnice]] (SET), 1923, [[Bucharest]]\n* [[Industria Aeronautic\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103]] (IAR), 1925, [[Bra\u015fov]]\n* [[\u00centreprinderea de Construc\u021bii Aeronautice Rom\u00e2ne\u0219ti]] (ICAR), 1932, [[Bucharest]]\n\n'''Aircraft constructed under foreign license'''\n* [[Heinkel He 111]] H (30 examples by Brasov)\n* [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]G (15 109G-4a and 60 109G-6a IAR built examples by Brasov (1944-1947))\n* [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79]]JR (76 examples by Brasov)\n* [[PZL P.11]]f (80 examples by IAR)\n* [[PZL P.24]]E (50 examples by IAR)\n* [[IAR 36]] (Messerschmitt design) (5 examples by IAR)\n\n==Enemy aircraft interned or captured==\n{{Further information|List of aircraft of the Romanian Air Force#Interned or captured}}\nAs a result of the [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Soviet Invasion of Poland]], a large number of [[Polish Air Force]] aircraft were [[List of aircraft of the Romanian Air Force#Interned or captured|interned]] in Romania.

They have generally maintained a varying degree of influence over many of the smaller mob families outside New York, including ties with the [[Philadelphia crime family|Philadelphia]], [[Patriarca crime family|Patriarca]], and [[Buffalo crime family|Buffalo]] crime families.\n\nThe current \"family\" was founded by [[Lucky Luciano|Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano]], and was known as the '''Luciano crime family''' from 1931 to 1957, when it was renamed after [[crime boss|boss]] [[Vito Genovese]]. Originally in control of the waterfront on the [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side of Manhattan]] and the [[Fulton Fish Market]], the family was run for years by \"the Oddfather\", [[Vincent Gigante|Vincent \"the Chin\" Gigante]], who feigned insanity by shuffling unshaven through New York's [[Greenwich Village]] wearing a tattered bath robe and muttering to himself incoherently to avoid prosecution.\n\nThe Genovese family is the oldest and the largest of the \"Five Families\". Finding new ways to make money in the 21st century, the family took advantage of lax [[due diligence]] by banks during the [[United States housing bubble|housing bubble]] with a wave of [[mortgage fraud]]s. Prosecutors say [[loan shark]] victims obtained [[home equity loan]]s to pay off debts to their mob bankers. The family found ways to use new technology to improve on [[Gaming law|illegal gambling]], with customers placing bets through offshore sites via the [[Internet]].\n\nAlthough the leadership of the Genovese family seemed to have been in limbo after the death of Gigante in 2005, they appear to be the most organized and powerful family in the [[United States]], with sources believing that [[Liborio Bellomo|Liborio \"Barney\" Bellomo]] is the current boss of the organization.<ref name=\"castff\">[http://www.wmob.com/cast.html The Frank And Fritzy Show: Cast] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314123945/http://www.wmob.com/cast.html |date=2008-03-14 }} - the wiretap network - wmob.com</ref> Unique in today's Mafia, the family has benefited greatly from members following \"[[Omert\u00e0]],\" a code of conduct emphasizing secrecy and non-cooperation with law enforcement and the justice system.

Morello's half brothers [[Nicholas Morello|Nicholas]], [[Vincenzo Terranova|Vincenzo]], [[Ciro Terranova|Ciro]] and the rest of [[Giuseppe Morello#Early life|his family]] joined him in New York the following year. The Morello brothers formed the 107th Street Mob and began dominating the Italian neighborhood of [[East Harlem]], parts of [[Manhattan]], and [[the Bronx]].\n\nOne of Giuseppe Morello's strongest allies was [[Ignazio Lupo|Ignazio \"the Wolf\" Lupo]], a mobster who controlled Manhattan's [[Little Italy, Manhattan|Little Italy]]. In 1903, Lupo married Morello's half sister, uniting both organizations. The Morello-Lupo alliance continued to prosper in 1903, when the group began a major [[counterfeit]]ing ring with powerful Sicilian ''[[Made man|mafioso]]'' [[Vito Cascioferro|Vito Cascio Ferro]], printing $5 bills in Sicily and [[smuggling]] them into the [[United States]]. New York police detective [[Joseph Petrosino]] began investigating the Morello family's counterfeiting operation, the [[barrel murder]]s and the [[Black Hand (extortion)|black hand]] [[extortion]] letters. On November 15, 1909, Morello, Lupo and others were arrested on counterfeiting charges. In February 1910, Morello and Lupo were sentenced to 25 and 30 years in prison, respectively.<ref name=\"Capeci guide\">[[Jerry Capeci|Capeci, Jerry]].

The Morellos had an alliance with [[Giosue Gallucci]], a prominent East Harlem businessman and [[Camorra|Camorrista]] with local political connections. On May 17, 1915, Gallucci was murdered in a power struggle between the Morellos and the [[Camorra in New York|Neapolitan Camorra organization]], which consisted of two [[Brooklyn]] gangs run by [[Pellegrino Morano]] and [[Alessandro Vollero]]. The fight over Gallucci's [[racket (crime)|racket]]s became known as the [[Mafia-Camorra War]]. After months of fighting, Morano offered a [[truce]]. A meeting was arranged at a Navy Street cafe owned by Vollero. On September 7, 1916, Nicholas Morello and his bodyguard [[Mafia\u2013Camorra War|Charles Ubriaco]] were ambushed and killed upon arrival by five members of the Camorra gang.<ref name=\"Morello, Ubriaco dead\">[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1916/09/08/105463376.pdf 2 Die In Pistol Fight in Brooklyn Street], The New York Times, September 8, 1916</ref> In 1917, Morano was charged with Morello's murder after Camorrista [[Ralph Daniello]] implicated him in the murder. By 1918, law enforcement had sent many Camorra gang members to prison, decimating the Camorra in New York and ending the war. Many of the remaining Camorra members joined the Morello family.\n\nThe Morellos now faced stronger rivals than the Camorra. With the passage of [[Prohibition]] in 1919 and the ban of alcohol sales, the family regrouped and built a lucrative [[rum-running|bootlegging]] operation in Manhattan. In 1920, both Morello and Lupo were released from prison and Brooklyn Mafia [[Boss (crime)|boss]] [[Salvatore D'Aquila]] ordered their murders. This is when [[Joe Masseria|Joseph Masseria]] and [[Umberto Valenti (gangster)|Rocco Valenti]], a former Brooklyn Camorra, began to fight for control of the Morello family.<ref>David Critchley ''The Origin of Organized Crime in America: The New York City Mafia, 1891\u20131931'' pg.155</ref> On December 29, 1920, Masseria's men murdered Valenti's ally, Salvatore Mauro. Then, on May 8, 1922, the Valenti gang murdered [[Vincenzo Terranova]]. Masseria's gang retaliated killing Morello member [[Silva Tagliagamba]]. On August 11, 1922, Masseria's men murdered Valenti, ending the conflict. Masseria won and took over the Morello family.<ref name=\"crimelibrary1\">[http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/family_epics/genovese1/1.html Epic saga of the Genovese Crime Family] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310091428/http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/family_epics/genovese1/1.html |date=2005-03-10 }}(Page 1)By Anthony Bruno - Crime Library on truTV.com</ref>\n\n===The Castellammarese era===\n[[File:Giuseppe \u201eJoe\u201c Masseria.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Joe Masseria]]]]\nDuring the mid-1920s, Masseria continued to expand his bootlegging, extortion, [[Loan shark|loansharking]], and [[illegal gambling]] rackets throughout New York. To operate and protect these rackets, Masseria recruited many ambitious young mobsters, including future ''Cosa Nostra'' powers [[Lucky Luciano|Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano]], [[Frank Costello]], [[Joe Adonis|Joseph \"Joey A\" Adonis]], [[Vito Genovese]], and [[Albert Anastasia]].\n\nLuciano soon became a top aide in Masseria's criminal organization. By the late 1920s, Masseria's main rival was boss [[Salvatore Maranzano]], who had come from Sicily to run the [[Bonanno crime family|Castellammarese clan]].

Morello's half brothers [[Nicholas Morello|Nicholas]], [[Vincenzo Terranova|Vincenzo]], [[Ciro Terranova|Ciro]] and the rest of [[Giuseppe Morello#Early life|his family]] joined him in New York the following year. The Morello brothers formed the 107th Street Mob and began dominating the Italian neighborhood of [[East Harlem]], parts of [[Manhattan]], and [[the Bronx]].\n\nOne of Giuseppe Morello's strongest allies was [[Ignazio Lupo|Ignazio \"the Wolf\" Lupo]], a mobster who controlled Manhattan's [[Little Italy, Manhattan|Little Italy]]. In 1903, Lupo married Morello's half sister, uniting both organizations. The Morello-Lupo alliance continued to prosper in 1903, when the group began a major [[counterfeit]]ing ring with powerful Sicilian ''[[Made man|mafioso]]'' [[Vito Cascioferro|Vito Cascio Ferro]], printing $5 bills in Sicily and [[smuggling]] them into the [[United States]]. New York police detective [[Joseph Petrosino]] began investigating the Morello family's counterfeiting operation, the [[barrel murder]]s and the [[Black Hand (extortion)|black hand]] [[extortion]] letters.

The Morellos had an alliance with [[Giosue Gallucci]], a prominent East Harlem businessman and [[Camorra|Camorrista]] with local political connections. On May 17, 1915, Gallucci was murdered in a power struggle between the Morellos and the [[Camorra in New York|Neapolitan Camorra organization]], which consisted of two [[Brooklyn]] gangs run by [[Pellegrino Morano]] and [[Alessandro Vollero]]. The fight over Gallucci's [[racket (crime)|racket]]s became known as the [[Mafia-Camorra War]]. After months of fighting, Morano offered a [[truce]]. A meeting was arranged at a Navy Street cafe owned by Vollero. On September 7, 1916, Nicholas Morello and his bodyguard [[Mafia\u2013Camorra War|Charles Ubriaco]] were ambushed and killed upon arrival by five members of the Camorra gang.<ref name=\"Morello, Ubriaco dead\">[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1916/09/08/105463376.pdf 2 Die In Pistol Fight in Brooklyn Street], The New York Times, September 8, 1916</ref> In 1917, Morano was charged with Morello's murder after Camorrista [[Ralph Daniello]] implicated him in the murder. By 1918, law enforcement had sent many Camorra gang members to prison, decimating the Camorra in New York and ending the war. Many of the remaining Camorra members joined the Morello family.\n\nThe Morellos now faced stronger rivals than the Camorra. With the passage of [[Prohibition]] in 1919 and the ban of alcohol sales, the family regrouped and built a lucrative [[rum-running|bootlegging]] operation in Manhattan. In 1920, both Morello and Lupo were released from prison and Brooklyn Mafia [[Boss (crime)|boss]] [[Salvatore D'Aquila]] ordered their murders. This is when [[Joe Masseria|Joseph Masseria]] and [[Umberto Valenti (gangster)|Rocco Valenti]], a former Brooklyn Camorra, began to fight for control of the Morello family.<ref>David Critchley ''The Origin of Organized Crime in America: The New York City Mafia, 1891\u20131931'' pg.155</ref> On December 29, 1920, Masseria's men murdered Valenti's ally, Salvatore Mauro.

After Genovese died in 1969, Lombardo was named his successor. However, the family appointed a series of \"front bosses\" to masquerade as the official family boss. The aim of these deceptions was to protect Lombardo by confusing law enforcement about who was the true leader of the family. In the late 1960s, Gambino loaned $4 million to Eboli for a drug scheme in an attempt to gain control of the Genovese family. When Eboli failed to pay back his debt, Gambino, with Commission approval, murdered Eboli in 1972.<ref name=\"newton 115\">{{cite book|last=Newton|first=Michael|title=The encyclopedia of unsolved crimes|year=2009|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York|isbn=1-4381-1914-3|pages=115|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gijG7fSwvjAC&pg=PA115&dq=%22Thomas+Eboli%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=TsRsT6L9EZGE0QHg9dTDBg&ved=0CEIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Thomas%20Eboli%22&f=false|edition=2nd}}</ref><ref name=funerals>{{cite news|last=Pace|first=Eric|title=Funerals Aren't What They Used to Be|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1972/07/23/91337694.pdf|accessdate=23 March 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 23, 1972}}</ref><ref name=\"gang figure\">{{cite news|last=Perlmutter|first=Emanuel|title=A Key Gang Figure Slain in Brooklyn|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1972/07/17/83448308.pdf|accessdate=23 March 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 17, 1972}}</ref>\n\nAfter Eboli's death, Genovese ''capo'' and Gambino ally [[Frank Tieri (mobster)|Frank \"Funzi\" Tieri]] was appointed as the new front boss.

Benson came in fourth place in the NL Rookie of the Year voting. He came up just shy of breaking the record for most strikeouts in team history by a rookie hurler.

It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' marked a move towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and Bowie himself, it was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London and featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later be known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album cover, photographed by Brian Ward in monochrome and re-coloured by Terry Pastor, was influenced by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] photo book that Bowie took with him to the photoshoot.\n\nThe album was initially released to favourable critical and commercial reception but wasn't a major success until the commercial breakthrough of his following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972). It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' chose it as part of their \"100 best albums of all time\" list in January 2010, with journalist [[Josh Tyrangiel]] praising Bowie's \"earthbound ambition to be a [[Bohemianism|boho]] poet with prodigal style\".<ref name=time /> The album has been reissued multiple times and remastered in 2015 as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the completion of his third studio album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' in May 1970, Bowie became less active in both the studio and on stage. This was partly due to challenges that were confronting his new manager [[Tony Defries]], who Bowie hired after firing his old manager [[Kenneth Pitt]] and departing music publisher Essex Music.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} After hearing Bowie's new single \"[[Holy Holy]]\", Defries signed a contract with Chrysalis but thereafter limited his work with Bowie to focus on other projects, including attempting to sign American singer-songwriter [[Stevie Wonder]] following his contract ending with [[Motown Records]]. Because of this, Bowie, who was devoting himself to songwriting, turned to Chrysalis partner Bob Grace. Grace, according to biographer Nicholas Pegg, had \"courted\" Bowie on \"the strength of 'Holy Holy'\", and subsequently booked time at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London for Bowie to record his demos.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} According to his then-wife [[Angie Bowie|Angela]], Bowie had spent time at Haddon composing songs on piano rather than acoustic guitar, which would \"infuse the flavour of the new album.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} Biographer [[Marc Spitz]] notes that a piano could not fit in in Plaistow Grove bedroom, nor was it suitable for playing in clubs or bus tours with his previous groups. Haddon Hall, however, gave him more of a sense of comfort and permanence, something he had not felt before when composing.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} Here he composed over three dozen songs, many of which would end up on ''Hunky Dory'' and its follow-up ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Two of these were \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\", which he recorded with his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in February 1971,{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}} and subsequently re-recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}\n\nIn August 1970, due to his disillusionment with Bowie's lack of enthusiasm during the sessions for ''The Man Who Sold the World'' and his dislike of Defries, bassist and producer [[Tony Visconti]] parted ways with Bowie; it was the last time he would see the artist for three to four years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}} [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]], who played guitar and drums, respectively for ''The Man Who Sold the World'', similarly parted ways with Bowie, primarily due to their disgruntlement with the artist on top of not being paid for their performances.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}} Visconti would then produce music for glam rock artist [[Marc Bolan]] while Ronson and Woodmansey went to [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]] and formed a short-lived group called Ronno with Benny Marshall of [[The Rats (British band)|the Rats]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=214}} \n\nThe first song Bowie wrote and demoed for ''Hunky Dory'' was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\" in January 1971. After recording a demo at Radio Luxembourg, Bowie gave the tape to Grace, who showed it to [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]]. Noone decided to record \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" and released it as his debut single later that year.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=202\u2013203}} Noone's version reached number 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in mid-June, with Noone telling ''[[NME]]'': \"My view is that David Bowie is the best writer in Britain at the moment...certainly the best since [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]].\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=220}}\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nAfter the minimal critical and commercial impact of his Arnold Corns project and leaving Mercury Records, Bowie regrouped in the studio in May 1971 to begin work on his next album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=216, 218}} Initially, he was joined by Arnold Corns guitarist Mark Pritchett, ''Space Oddity'' drummer [[Terry Cox]] and his former Turquoise colleague Tony Hill. However, he came to the conclusion that he couldn't do the project without Ronson.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} Ronson, who had not talked to Bowie in nine months and had become depressed, was enthusiastic when Bowie contacted him. Woodmansey returned with Ronson, who recruited a new bass player to replace Visconti. He initially suggested [[Rick Kemp]], who Bowie recorded with in the King Bees in the mid-1960s. However, upon meeting Bowie at Haddon Hall to audition, Bowie was dismissive of him and, according to Pegg, some reports say that Defries rejected Kemp on the grounds of his \"receding hairline;\" Kemp would instead join the English folk rock band [[Steeleye Span]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} So, Ronson suggested his acquaintance [[Trevor Bolder]], a former hairdresser and piano tuner who had previously seen Bowie live in 1970 and met Ronson at Haddon Hall.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} Upon Bolder's hiring, the trio grouped at Haddon to rehearse some of Bowie's new material, of which included album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}\n\n[[File:Ken Scott - 2014-11-14 - Andy Mabbett.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=Ken Scott in 2014|''Hunky Dory'' was the first production collaboration between Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] ''(pictured in 2014)''.]]\nFollowing the birth of his son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]], Bowie wrote the song \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" as a tribute to him. Also known as 'Zowie', Bowie would tell David Wigg in 1973: \"I got the name [Zowie] from a [[Batman]] comic.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} On 3 June, Bowie and the Spiders, along with traveled to the BBC's Paris Studios in London to record for [[John Peel]]'s radio show ''In Concert''.

He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at Haddon Hall, where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\". He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}} The piano Wakeman played on the album was an 1898 [[C. Bechstein|Bechstein]] that was the same one used for the Beatles' 1968 song \"[[Hey Jude]]\" and many of [[Elton John]] and [[Harry Nilsson]]'s early records, and would later be used by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] for \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} According to Wakeman, the sessions initially had a rough start, due to the band not learning the songs. He recalled in the Radio 2 documentary ''Golden Years'' and his autobiography ''Say Yes!'' that Bowie had to halt the sessions, telling the musicians off and to come back when they knew the music. Upon returning after a week, Wakeman said: \"the band were hot! They were so good, and the tracks just flowed through.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} However, this account has been disputed by other band members, including Bolder, who told Kevin Cann: \"[That's] rubbish. David would never have told the band off in the studio. Especially as Mick and Woody had already left him once, and everyone was now getting on. The band would not have survived that \u2013 it definitely didn't happen.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} Similarly, Scott said: \"I definitely don't remember that, and it's not something I would forget.

There is no known record of Moore responding and although the specific song Defries was asking him to play on is unknown, Cann deduces that it was most likely \"Life on Mars?\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}} During this day, the group recorded four takes of \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\", the final take appeared on the finished album.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=223\u2013224}} On 18 July, the group spent the day rehearsing and mixing. During the session, Bowie was introduced by Grace to a band known as Chameleon. He gave them his future ''Ziggy Stardust'' track \"[[Star (David Bowie song)|Star]]\", which they recorded their own unreleased version of.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=224}} On 26 July, a seven-hour mixing session took place in order to compile a promotional album for Gem Productions. At this point, the songs \"Oh! You Pretty Things\", \"Eight Line Poem\", \"Kooks\", \"Queen Bitch\" and \"Andy Warhol\" were recorded, although the mixes of \"Eight Line Poem\" and \"Kooks\" on the promotional album were different than the final mixes on ''Hunky Dory''.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=224\u2013225}} Two takes of \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\" were recorded on 30 July, the second take appearing on the final album. It was recorded on a tape that contained rejected versions of \"Song for Bob Dylan\" and \"Fill Your Heart\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=225}} On 6 August, the band recorded \"Life on Mars?\" and \"Song for Bob Dylan\", after which the album recording is deemed complete. Ronson guided the recording of \"Life on Mars?\", counting in each take and overdubbed his guitar, strings, Mellotron and Bowie's vocal.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=225}} Cann does not have a recording date for \"Changes\",{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=219\u2013225}} but Doggett writes that it was recorded sometime between June and July.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}}\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n[[File:Rickwakemanmoog.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Rick Wakeman performing in 2012|The album features piano by keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]] ''(pictured in 2012)'', whose playing greatly influenced the songs.]]\nAuthor [[Peter Doggett]] describes ''Hunky Dory'' as \"a collective of attractively accessible pop songs, through which Bowie tested out his feelings about the nature of stardom and power.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=11}} Musical biographer David Buckley said of the album: \"Its almost easy-listening status and conventional musical sensibility has detracted from the fact that, lyrically, this record lays down the blueprint for Bowie's future career.\"<ref name=buckstrange1>{{cite book |title=Strange Fascination \u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story |last=Buckley |first=David |year=2000 |origyear=1999 |publisher=Virgin Books |location=London |isbn=0-7535-0457-X |page=112}}</ref> Spitz describes it as a piano-driven record and because of this, it offers more of an inviting and warmer feel, especially when compared to ''Space Oddity'' and ''The Man Who Sold the World''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} The opening track, \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\", focused on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention (\"Strange fascination, fascinating me/Changes are taking the pace I'm going through\") and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream (\"Look out, you rock 'n' rollers\"). However, the composer also took time to pay tribute to his influences with the tracks \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\", \"[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]\" and the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] inspired \"[[Queen Bitch]]\".\n\nFollowing the [[hard rock]] of Bowie's previous album ''The Man Who Sold the World'', ''Hunky Dory'' saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of ''Space Oddity'', with light fare such as \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" and the cover \"Fill Your Heart\" sitting alongside heavier material like the [[occult]]-tinged \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" (whose lyric mentions the Golden Dawn (i.e. the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]) and [[Aleister Crowley]]) and the semi-autobiographical \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\". Between the two extremes was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\", whose pop tune hid lyrics, inspired by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], predicting the imminent replacement of modern man by \"the [[\u00dcbermensch|Homo Superior]]\", and which has been cited as a direct precursor to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" from Bowie's next album, ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}}\n\n== Title and artwork ==\nAlthough Bowie generally left naming his albums until last minute, the title, 'Hunky Dory', was announced at the John Peel session.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} It was suggested by Bob Grace of Chrysalis, who got the idea from an [[Esher]] pub landlord and formerly of the [[Royal Air Force]]. He told Peter and Leni Gillman, the authors of ''Alias David Bowie'', that the landlord had an unusual vocabulary that was \"peppered with upper-crust jargon\", using words such as 'prang' and 'whizzo', and phrases such as 'everything's hunky-dory'. Grace told Bowie and he loved it.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=606\u2013607}} Pegg notes that there was a song from 1957 by the American doo-wop band the Guytones also titled \"Hunky Dory\" that may have played a part as well.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}} Spitz notes that 'hunky-dory' is an English slang term that means everything is right in the world.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} The album's sleeve would bear the credit \"Produced by Ken Scott (assisted by the actor)\". The \"actor\" was Bowie himself, whose \"pet conceit\", in the words of ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]], was \"to think of himself as an actor\".{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=7\u201311}}\n\nThe cover artwork was taken by photographer Brian Ward at his [[Heddon Street]] studio,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=610\u2013611}} who was introduced to Bowie by Grace. One idea was for Bowie to dress as an Egyptian Pharoah, partly inspired by the British media's infatuation with the [[British Museum]]'s new [[Tutankhamun]] exhibit.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Photos of Bowie posing as a sphinx and in a lotus position were taken \u2013 one of them was released as part of the 1990 ''Space Oddity'' reissue \u2013 but the idea was ultimately not chosen. Bowie later recalled: \"We didn't run with it, as they say. Probably a good idea.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Rather than something extravagant, Bowie opted for a more minimalist image reflecting the album's \"preoccupation with the silver screen.\" Bowie later said: \"I was into Oxford bags, and there are a pair, indeed, on the back of the album. [I was attempting] what I presumed was kind of an [[Evelyn Waugh]] Oxbridge look.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} The final image is a close-up of Bowie looking up into space as he pushes his hair back from his forehead. Originally shot in monochrome, the image was re-coloured by illustrator Terry Pastor, who recently set up the Main Artery design studio in [[Covent Garden]] with George Underwood; Pastor would later design the cover and sleeve for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Pegg writes: \"Bowie's decision to use a re-coloured photo suggests a hand-tinted lobby-card from the days of the silent cinema and, simultaneously, Warhol's famous ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'' screen-prints.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Robert Dimery, in his book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]'', also notes the influenced of Warhol's ''Dietrich'' prints and writes that Bowie took a photo book that contained multiple ''Dietrich'' prints with him to the photoshoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 Albums You Must

It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' marked a move towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and Bowie himself, it was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London and featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later be known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album cover, photographed by Brian Ward in monochrome and re-coloured by Terry Pastor, was influenced by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] photo book that Bowie took with him to the photoshoot.\n\nThe album was initially released to favourable critical and commercial reception but wasn't a major success until the commercial breakthrough of his following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972). It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' chose it as part of their \"100 best albums of all time\" list in January 2010, with journalist [[Josh Tyrangiel]] praising Bowie's \"earthbound ambition to be a [[Bohemianism|boho]] poet with prodigal style\".<ref name=time /> The album has been reissued multiple times and remastered in 2015 as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the completion of his third studio album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' in May 1970, Bowie became less active in both the studio and on stage. This was partly due to challenges that were confronting his new manager [[Tony Defries]], who Bowie hired after firing his old manager [[Kenneth Pitt]] and departing music publisher Essex Music.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} After hearing Bowie's new single \"[[Holy Holy]]\", Defries signed a contract with Chrysalis but thereafter limited his work with Bowie to focus on other projects, including attempting to sign American singer-songwriter [[Stevie Wonder]] following his contract ending with [[Motown Records]]. Because of this, Bowie, who was devoting himself to songwriting, turned to Chrysalis partner Bob Grace. Grace, according to biographer Nicholas Pegg, had \"courted\" Bowie on \"the strength of 'Holy Holy'\", and subsequently booked time at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London for Bowie to record his demos.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} According to his then-wife [[Angie Bowie|Angela]], Bowie had spent time at Haddon composing songs on piano rather than acoustic guitar, which would \"infuse the flavour of the new album.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} Biographer [[Marc Spitz]] notes that a piano could not fit in in Plaistow Grove bedroom, nor was it suitable for playing in clubs or bus tours with his previous groups. Haddon Hall, however, gave him more of a sense of comfort and permanence, something he had not felt before when composing.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} Here he composed over three dozen songs, many of which would end up on ''Hunky Dory'' and its follow-up ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Two of these were \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\", which he recorded with his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in February 1971,{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}} and subsequently re-recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}\n\nIn August 1970, due to his disillusionment with Bowie's lack of enthusiasm during the sessions for ''The Man Who Sold the World'' and his dislike of Defries, bassist and producer [[Tony Visconti]] parted ways with Bowie; it was the last time he would see the artist for three to four years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}} [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]], who played guitar and drums, respectively for ''The Man Who Sold the World'', similarly parted ways with Bowie, primarily due to their disgruntlement with the artist on top of not being paid for their performances.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}} Visconti would then produce music for glam rock artist [[Marc Bolan]] while Ronson and Woodmansey went to [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]] and formed a short-lived group called Ronno with Benny Marshall of [[The Rats (British band)|the Rats]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=214}} \n\nThe first song Bowie wrote and demoed for ''Hunky Dory'' was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\" in January 1971. After recording a demo at Radio Luxembourg, Bowie gave the tape to Grace, who showed it to [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]]. Noone decided to record \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" and released it as his debut single later that year.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=202\u2013203}} Noone's version reached number 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in mid-June, with Noone telling ''[[NME]]'': \"My view is that David Bowie is the best writer in Britain at the moment...certainly the best since [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]].\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=220}}\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nAfter the minimal critical and commercial impact of his Arnold Corns project and leaving Mercury Records, Bowie regrouped in the studio in May 1971 to begin work on his next album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=216, 218}} Initially, he was joined by Arnold Corns guitarist Mark Pritchett, ''Space Oddity'' drummer [[Terry Cox]] and his former Turquoise colleague Tony Hill. However, he came to the conclusion that he couldn't do the project without Ronson.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} Ronson, who had not talked to Bowie in nine months and had become depressed, was enthusiastic when Bowie contacted him. Woodmansey returned with Ronson, who recruited a new bass player to replace Visconti. He initially suggested [[Rick Kemp]], who Bowie recorded with in the King Bees in the mid-1960s. However, upon meeting Bowie at Haddon Hall to audition, Bowie was dismissive of him and, according to Pegg, some reports say that Defries rejected Kemp on the grounds of his \"receding hairline;\" Kemp would instead join the English folk rock band [[Steeleye Span]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} So, Ronson suggested his acquaintance [[Trevor Bolder]], a former hairdresser and piano tuner who had previously seen Bowie live in 1970 and met Ronson at Haddon Hall.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} Upon Bolder's hiring, the trio grouped at Haddon to rehearse some of Bowie's new material, of which included album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}\n\n[[File:Ken Scott - 2014-11-14 - Andy Mabbett.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=Ken Scott in 2014|''Hunky Dory'' was the first production collaboration between Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] ''(pictured in 2014)''.]]\nFollowing the birth of his son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]], Bowie wrote the song \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" as a tribute to him. Also known as 'Zowie', Bowie would tell David Wigg in 1973: \"I got the name [Zowie] from a [[Batman]] comic.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} On 3 June, Bowie and the Spiders, along with traveled to the BBC's Paris Studios in London to record for [[John Peel]]'s radio show ''In Concert''. They were joined by [[Dana Gillespie]], Mark Pritchett, Geoffrey MacCormack (better known as [[Warren Peace]]) and George Underwood.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} The songs they performed were all originals written by Bowie, apart from a cover of [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Almost Grown (song)|Almost Grown]]\" and [[Ron Davies (songwriter)|Ron Davies]]' \"It Ain't Easy\",{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}} which was to be recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust'' a year later.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} The performance began with \"[[Queen Bitch]]\" and \"[[Bombers (David Bowie song)|Bombers]]\", which Peel says will both be on the upcoming album, although \"Bombers\" was to replaced by the cover \"Fill Your Heart\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}} They also played \"[[The Supermen]]\" from ''The Man Who Sold the World'', \"Looking for a Friend\" (which was sung by Pritchett), \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\" (which was sung by Underwood) and \"Andy Warhol\" (which was sung by Gillespie).{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} Although Bowie's backing trio were referred to as \"members of a group called Ronno\", the session would become the first performance with the trio who would become known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] and who would record with him for the next three years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}}<ref name=\"Gallucci UCR\" /> \n\n{{quote box|quote=[''Hunky Dory''] is very much a duo record.

He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at Haddon Hall, where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\". He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}} The piano Wakeman played on the album was an 1898 [[C. Bechstein|Bechstein]] that was the same one used for the Beatles' 1968 song \"[[Hey Jude]]\" and many of [[Elton John]] and [[Harry Nilsson]]'s early records, and would later be used by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] for \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} According to Wakeman, the sessions initially had a rough start, due to the band not learning the songs. He recalled in the Radio 2 documentary ''Golden Years'' and his autobiography ''Say Yes!'' that Bowie had to halt the sessions, telling the musicians off and to come back when they knew the music. Upon returning after a week, Wakeman said: \"the band were hot! They were so good, and the tracks just flowed through.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} However, this account has been disputed by other band members, including Bolder, who told Kevin Cann: \"[That's] rubbish. David would never have told the band off in the studio. Especially as Mick and Woody had already left him once, and everyone was now getting on. The band would not have survived that \u2013 it definitely didn't happen.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} Similarly, Scott said: \"I definitely don't remember that, and it's not something I would forget. I would definitely dispute that one.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}}\n\nWith Wakeman on the line-up, Bowie and the Spiders recorded reconvened at Trident on 9 July and recorded two takes of \"Bombers\" and \"It Ain't Easy\", the latter featuring backing vocals by Dana Gillespie.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}} According to Cann, five days later on 14 July, Defries sent a letter to jazz pianist [[Dudley Moore]] asking him to play piano during a session. There is no known record of Moore responding and although the specific song Defries was asking him to play on is unknown, Cann deduces that it was most likely \"Life on Mars?\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}} During this day, the group recorded four takes of \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\", the final take appeared on the finished album.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=223\u2013224}} On 18 July, the group spent the day rehearsing and mixing. During the session, Bowie was introduced by Grace to a band known as Chameleon. He gave them his future ''Ziggy Stardust'' track \"[[Star (David Bowie song)|Star]]\", which they recorded their own unreleased version of.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=224}} On 26 July, a seven-hour mixing session took place in order to compile a promotional album for Gem Productions. At this point, the songs \"Oh! You Pretty Things\", \"Eight Line Poem\", \"Kooks\", \"Queen Bitch\" and \"Andy Warhol\" were recorded, although the mixes of \"Eight Line Poem\" and \"Kooks\" on the promotional album were different than the final mixes on ''Hunky Dory''.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=224\u2013225}} Two takes of \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\" were recorded on 30 July, the second take appearing on the final album. It was recorded on a tape that contained rejected versions of \"Song for Bob Dylan\" and \"Fill Your Heart\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=225}} On 6 August, the band recorded \"Life on Mars?\" and \"Song for Bob Dylan\", after which the album recording is deemed complete. Ronson guided the recording of \"Life on Mars?\", counting in each take and overdubbed his guitar, strings, Mellotron and Bowie's vocal.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=225}} Cann does not have a recording date for \"Changes\", but Doggett writes that it was recorded sometime between June and July.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}}\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n[[File:Rickwakemanmoog.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Rick Wakeman performing in 2012|The album features piano by keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]] ''(pictured in 2012)'', whose playing greatly influenced the songs.]]\nAuthor [[Peter Doggett]] describes ''Hunky Dory'' as \"a collective of attractively accessible pop songs, through which Bowie tested out his feelings about the nature of stardom and power.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=11}} Musical biographer David Buckley said of the album: \"Its almost easy-listening status and conventional musical sensibility has detracted from the fact that, lyrically, this record lays down the blueprint for Bowie's future career.\"<ref name=buckstrange1>{{cite book |title=Strange Fascination \u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story |last=Buckley |first=David |year=2000 |origyear=1999 |publisher=Virgin Books |location=London |isbn=0-7535-0457-X |page=112}}</ref> Spitz describes it as a piano-driven record and because of this, it offers more of an inviting and warmer feel, especially when compared to ''Space Oddity'' and ''The Man Who Sold the World''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} The opening track, \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\", focused on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention (\"Strange fascination, fascinating me/Changes are taking the pace I'm going through\") and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream (\"Look out, you rock 'n' rollers\"). However, the composer also took time to pay tribute to his influences with the tracks \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\", \"[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]\" and the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] inspired \"[[Queen Bitch]]\".\n\nFollowing the [[hard rock]] of Bowie's previous album ''The Man Who Sold the World'', ''Hunky Dory'' saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of ''Space Oddity'', with light fare such as \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" and the cover \"Fill Your Heart\" sitting alongside heavier material like the [[occult]]-tinged \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" (whose lyric mentions the Golden Dawn (i.e. the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]) and [[Aleister Crowley]]) and the semi-autobiographical \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\". Between the two extremes was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\", whose pop tune hid lyrics, inspired by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], predicting the imminent replacement of modern man by \"the [[\u00dcbermensch|Homo Superior]]\", and which has been cited as a direct precursor to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" from Bowie's next album, ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}}\n\n== Title and artwork ==\nAlthough Bowie generally left naming his albums until last minute, the title, 'Hunky Dory', was announced at the John Peel session.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} It was suggested by Bob Grace of Chrysalis, who got the idea from an [[Esher]] pub landlord and formerly of the [[Royal Air Force]]. He told Peter and Leni Gillman, the authors of ''Alias David Bowie'', that the landlord had an unusual vocabulary that was \"peppered with upper-crust jargon\", using words such as 'prang' and 'whizzo', and phrases such as 'everything's hunky-dory'. Grace told Bowie and he loved it.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=606\u2013607}} Pegg notes that there was a song from 1957 by the American doo-wop band the Guytones also titled \"Hunky Dory\" that may have played a part as well.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}} Spitz notes that 'hunky-dory' is an English slang term that means everything is right in the world.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} The album's sleeve would bear the credit \"Produced by Ken Scott (assisted by the actor)\". The \"actor\" was Bowie himself, whose \"pet conceit\", in the words of ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]], was \"to think of himself as an actor\".{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=7\u201311}}\n\nThe cover artwork was taken by photographer Brian Ward at his [[Heddon Street]] studio,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=610\u2013611}} who was introduced to Bowie by Grace. One idea was for Bowie to dress as an Egyptian Pharoah, partly inspired by the British media's infatuation with the [[British Museum]]'s new [[Tutankhamun]] exhibit.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Photos of Bowie posing as a sphinx and in a lotus position were taken \u2013 one of them was released as part of the 1990 ''Space Oddity'' reissue \u2013 but the idea was ultimately not chosen. Bowie later recalled: \"We didn't run with it, as they say. Probably a good idea.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Rather than something extravagant, Bowie opted for a more minimalist image reflecting the album's \"preoccupation with the silver screen.\" Bowie later said: \"I was into Oxford bags, and there are a pair, indeed, on the back of the album. [I was attempting] what I presumed was kind of an [[Evelyn Waugh]] Oxbridge look.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} The final image is a close-up of Bowie looking up into space as he pushes his hair back from his forehead. Originally shot in monochrome, the image was re-coloured by illustrator Terry Pastor, who recently set up the Main Artery design studio in [[Covent Garden]] with George Underwood; Pastor would later design the cover and sleeve for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Pegg writes: \"Bowie's decision to use a re-coloured photo suggests a hand-tinted lobby-card from the days of the silent cinema and, simultaneously, Warhol's famous ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'' screen-prints.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Robert Dimery, in his book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]'', also notes the influenced of Warhol's ''Dietrich'' prints and writes that Bowie took a photo book that contained multiple ''Dietrich'' prints with him to the photoshoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 Albums You Must

With a claymation-style moon character serving as the original narrator and 'host', broadcasts tended to air monthly, as well as certain holidays. Films often fit a general theme, such as \"TNT Salutes [[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]\", \"Halloween Night\", \"Attack of the Sea Monsters\", \"A Christmas Nightmare\", \"[[Ray Harryhausen|Harryhausen]] Havoc\", or recurring \"[[Godzilla]] Marathons\", although other occasions had somewhat unrelated choices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cinemassacre.com/2018/11/08/the-history-of-tnts-monstervision/|title=TNT\u2019s MonsterVision TV Listings \u2013 Updated 11/8/2018|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-28}}</ref> Additionally, ''MonsterVision'' sometimes had special events, such as their \"[[Dracula]] Weekend\", which had a mini-interview with [[Christopher Lee]] in honor of the release of ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]''.<ref>{{Citation|last=lagedor30|title=Christopher Lee Talks Dracula|date=2013-05-29|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvtKVG3qJSQ|accessdate=2018-05-31}}</ref> A number of later marathons, beginning on June 5, 1993,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180529034516/https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:RLssssS8WNIJ:https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/89596350/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us|title=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on June 3, 1993 \u00b7 Page 48|date=2018-05-29|access-date=2018-05-29}}</ref> were presented by the well-known entertainment duo [[Penn and Teller]], before the show then transitioned to voice-over narration for the remaining duration of this period.\n\n=== Joe Bob Briggs Era (1996\u20132000) ===\nBeginning on June 28, 1996,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180526171930/https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Gbx9X7n4KkQJ:https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/12653430/+&cd=4&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us|title=The Daily Herald from Chicago, Illinois on June 28, 1996 \u00b7 Page 88|date=2018-05-26|access-date=2018-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414110458/http://www.joebobbriggs.com:80/index.php/en/damn-good-writing/monstervision/1214-the-hand|title=The Hand|date=2017-04-14|access-date=2018-05-26}}</ref> Joe Bob Briggs (John Bloom), the drive-in movie critic, became the official host of ''MonsterVision'', with the series transitioning into a regularly scheduled Friday time slot, every week at 11:00&nbsp;PM ET. ''MonsterVision'' would typically show no more than two films per night, though several episodes were much longer, such as the 1997 \"[[Super Bowl Sunday]] Special\", which consisted of sixteen continuous hours of horror movies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041227082217/http://www.angelfire.com/mn/nn/Omen.html|title=Monstervision Host Segments for The Omen|date=2004-12-27|access-date=2018-05-31}}</ref> Nonetheless, on usual double-feature nights, Joe Bob Briggs would appear anywhere between sixteen and twenty-four times throughout the movies, significantly more than he did on his previous program. In these sections, Briggs would discuss the films, and more, from the inside and outside of a staged trailer home with a green neon TNT sign in the background. Briggs was also frequently visited by one of a succession of 'mail girls', including Honey (Honey Michelle Gregory), Reno, Summer (Kathy Shower), and Rusty (Renner St. John), who not only served as attractive, comedic 'sidekicks,' but also brought Briggs fan letters, sometimes from actual prisoners. TNT also added the segment ''Joe Bob's Last Call'', which was used to showcase the final movie of the night.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910125805/http://www.mondo-video.com/joe-bob-briggs-interview|title=Joe Bob Briggs {{!}} Mondo Film & Video Guide|date=2011-09-10|access-date=2018-05-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180531052430/https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:fP8fKRQ68osJ:https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/111768116/+&cd=8&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us|title=The Courier-Journal from Louisville, Kentucky on January 17, 1997 \u00b7 Page 30|date=2018-05-31|access-date=2018-05-31}}</ref> Similarly, the program was occasionally able to feature guests such as rapper and actor [[Ice-T]], and directors [[Wes Craven]] and [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-07-04/news/9807040131_1_joe-bob-briggs-monstervision-movies|title=\"MonsterVision\": Television isn't just for entertainment... - tribunedigital-chicagotribune|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|access-date=2018-05-31|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Josh Hadley|title=Joe Bob Briggs Monstervision - Hairspray (with John Waters)|date=2017-06-29|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUjNRKpzwc|accessdate=2018-05-31}}</ref> \nWhen it came to the movies, ''MonsterVision'', under Briggs, would sometimes stray away from the typical horror and science fiction films, showing [[Western (genre)|westerns]], [[blaxploitation]], [[kung-fu]], dramas, comedies and other film genres, specifically in the later years. Additionally, as a way to connect fans further to the movies being presented during episodes, ''MonsterVision'' was known for its early use of the internet at [https://web.archive.org/web/19990209012302/http://www.tnt.turner.com/monstervision/ tnt.turner.com/monstervision].

He frequently played on the term \"[[kung fu]]\" to describe action sequences with a particular theme, such as 'Quicksand Fu' in ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome]]''. Briggs' introduction to ''[[Phantasm II]]'', for example, comprised: {{quote|\"Twelve dead bodies. Exploding house. One four-barreled sawed-off shotgun. Dwarf tossing. Ten breasts.

These could be more serious discussions, for example, of trivia about obscure film actors, or controversies such as the race debates around films such as ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]''. Conversely, Briggs' pieces could be more lighthearted, with deliberately outrageous political statements and occasional banter with his film crew. He frequently described his notional day-to-day activities, including supposed problems with his girlfriends (or lack thereof) and his four ex-wives (usually the fourth, \"Wanda Bodeine\"). Lastly, Briggs usually signed off each episode of ''MonsterVision'' with a casual debriefing on the movie just-ended, along with a series of deliberately bad jokes, and a reminder that \"the Drive-In will never die!\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFurthermore, during these sections, Briggs routinely criticized and lampooned TNT's censorship of the films, with frequent reference to the channel's owner, [[Ted Turner]]. This [[running gag]] culminated with a Halloween marathon of ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'' movies, which portrayed strange occurrences throughout the night, leading to Joe Bob realizing that Turner was trying to 'kill' him. The final scene saw Joe Bob give an impassioned apology to Turner, claiming he was an amazing person, before the video feed cut off eerily.<ref>{{Citation|last=ReadNWatchAnalog|title=Joe Bob Briggs \"Friday the 13th\" Marathon (complete) on \"Monstervision\"|date=2014-10-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoRUymBAlfk|accessdate=2018-05-31}}</ref> A similar stunt was staged in ''[[Blair Witch Project]]''-themed scenes for a later horror marathon, with the host mysteriously missing.<ref>{{Citation|last=ReadNWatchAnalog|title=Joe Bob Briggs -\"Nair Witch Project\"- Carrie - Child's Play 2 - Phantasm 1 & 2|date=2014-10-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoD3EmCY7sc|accessdate=2018-05-31}}</ref>\n\nBeginning on June 7, 1997,<ref>''New York Times'', ProQuest, Television Listing - June 7/8, 1997</ref> the series moved to Saturday nights in order to avoid further conflicts with TNT sports broadcasts.

Moving from Dallas to Los Angeles, not only was the general aesthetic of the show changed to feel more 'Hollywood', but the first film of each episode going forward tended to be more 'mainstream', while the second was usually in accordance with traditional ''MonsterVision''. Subsequently, this meant that the ''Joe Bob\u2019s Last Call'' segment would be dropped altogether. Although the original formula of the program was now changed, this transition allowed for more guests, such as [[Rhonda Shear]],<ref>{{Citation|last=ReadNWatchAnalog|title=Joe Bob Briggs w/Rhonda Shear presents \"in the Mouth of Madness\" w/Count Floyd|date=2014-10-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv1rDzM_Hes|accessdate=2018-05-31}}</ref> and horror movie specials still remained a staple of the show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151206034829/http://caseycorpier.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-drive-in-will-never-die-story-of.html|title=The Video Creep with Casey C.

In these sections, Briggs would discuss the films, and more, from the inside and outside of a staged trailer home with a green neon TNT sign in the background. Briggs was also frequently visited by one of a succession of 'mail girls', including Honey (Honey Michelle Gregory), Reno, Summer (Kathy Shower), and Rusty (Renner St. John), who not only served as attractive, comedic 'sidekicks,' but also brought Briggs fan letters, sometimes from actual prisoners. TNT also added the segment ''Joe Bob's Last Call'', which was used to showcase the final movie of the night.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910125805/http://www.mondo-video.com/joe-bob-briggs-interview|title=Joe Bob Briggs {{!}} Mondo Film & Video Guide|date=2011-09-10|access-date=2018-05-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180531052430/https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:fP8fKRQ68osJ:https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/111768116/+&cd=8&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us|title=The Courier-Journal from Louisville, Kentucky on January 17, 1997 \u00b7 Page 30|date=2018-05-31|access-date=2018-05-31}}</ref> Similarly, the program was occasionally able to feature guests such as rapper and actor [[Ice-T]], and directors [[Wes Craven]] and [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-07-04/news/9807040131_1_joe-bob-briggs-monstervision-movies|title=\"MonsterVision\": Television isn't just for entertainment... - tribunedigital-chicagotribune|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|access-date=2018-05-31|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Josh Hadley|title=Joe Bob Briggs Monstervision - Hairspray (with John Waters)|date=2017-06-29|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEUjNRKpzwc|accessdate=2018-05-31}}</ref> \nWhen it came to the movies, ''MonsterVision'', under Briggs, would sometimes stray away from the typical horror and science fiction films, showing [[Western (genre)|westerns]], [[blaxploitation]], [[kung-fu]], dramas, comedies and other film genres, specifically in the later years. Additionally, as a way to connect fans further to the movies being presented during episodes, ''MonsterVision'' was known for its early use of the internet at [https://web.archive.org/web/19990209012302/http://www.tnt.turner.com/monstervision/ tnt.turner.com/monstervision].

He frequently played on the term \"[[kung fu]]\" to describe action sequences with a particular theme, such as 'Quicksand Fu' in ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome]]''. Briggs' introduction to ''[[Phantasm II]]'', for example, comprised: {{quote|\"Twelve dead bodies. Exploding house. One four-barreled sawed-off shotgun. Dwarf tossing. Ten breasts.

These could be more serious discussions, for example, of trivia about obscure film actors, or controversies such as the race debates around films such as ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]''. Conversely, Briggs' pieces could be more lighthearted, with deliberately outrageous political statements and occasional banter with his film crew. He frequently described his notional day-to-day activities, including supposed problems with his girlfriends (or lack thereof) and his four ex-wives (usually the fourth, \"Wanda Bodeine\"). Lastly, Briggs usually signed off each episode of ''MonsterVision'' with a casual debriefing on the movie just-ended, along with a series of deliberately bad jokes, and a reminder that \"the Drive-In will never die!\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFurthermore, during these sections, Briggs routinely criticized and lampooned TNT's censorship of the films, with frequent reference to the channel's owner, [[Ted Turner]]. This [[running gag]] culminated with a Halloween marathon of ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'' movies, which portrayed strange occurrences throughout the night, leading to Joe Bob realizing that Turner was trying to 'kill' him. The final scene saw Joe Bob give an impassioned apology to Turner, claiming he was an amazing person, before the video feed cut off eerily.<ref>{{Citation|last=ReadNWatchAnalog|title=Joe Bob Briggs \"Friday the 13th\" Marathon (complete) on \"Monstervision\"|date=2014-10-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoRUymBAlfk|accessdate=2018-05-31}}</ref> A similar stunt was staged in ''[[Blair Witch Project]]''-themed scenes for a later horror marathon, with the host mysteriously missing.<ref>{{Citation|last=ReadNWatchAnalog|title=Joe Bob Briggs -\"Nair Witch Project\"- Carrie - Child's Play 2 - Phantasm 1 & 2|date=2014-10-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoD3EmCY7sc|accessdate=2018-05-31}}</ref>\n\nBeginning on June 7, 1997,<ref>''New York Times'', ProQuest, Television Listing - June 7/8, 1997</ref> the series moved to Saturday nights in order to avoid further conflicts with TNT sports broadcasts.

Moving from Dallas to Los Angeles, not only was the general aesthetic of the show changed to feel more 'Hollywood', but the first film of each episode going forward tended to be more 'mainstream', while the second was usually in accordance with traditional ''MonsterVision''. Subsequently, this meant that the ''Joe Bob\u2019s Last Call'' segment would be dropped altogether. Although the original formula of the program was now changed, this transition allowed for more guests, such as [[Rhonda Shear]],<ref>{{Citation|last=ReadNWatchAnalog|title=Joe Bob Briggs w/Rhonda Shear presents \"in the Mouth of Madness\" w/Count Floyd|date=2014-10-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv1rDzM_Hes|accessdate=2018-05-31}}</ref> and horror movie specials still remained a staple of the show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151206034829/http://caseycorpier.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-drive-in-will-never-die-story-of.html|title=The Video Creep with Casey C.
