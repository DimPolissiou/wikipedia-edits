A later ruler, Imam [[Muhammed Jasa]], a kinsman of Ahmad Gragn, yielded to the pressures of increasing [[Oromo people|Oromo]] raids and in 1577 abandoned the city, relocating to [[Asaita|Aussa]] and making his brother ruler of Harar. The new base not only failed to provide more security from the Oromos, it attracted the hostile attention of the neighboring [[Afar people|Afars]] who raided caravans traveling between Harar and the coast. The [[Imamate of Aussa|Imams of Aussa]] declined over the next century while Harar regained its independence under [[`Ali ibn Da`ud]], the founder of a dynasty that ruled the city from 1647 until 1875, when it was conquered by [[Egypt]].<ref>Richard Pankhurst, ''The Ethiopian Borderlands'' (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1997), pp. 375-377</ref>\n\nHarar was very dependent on [[Berbera]] for trade since the Middle Ages.

As a result of this, [[Dire Dawa]] was founded in 1902 as ''New Harar''. The British planned to revitalise the historic Berbera - Harar trade route by connecting the two cities via rail as a means to counter French influence in the region; however, the major infrastructure project was later abandoned.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C1915675|title=Berbera-Harrar Railway Survey Vol. 1|first=}}</ref> \n[[File:Harari Traditions (2202473839).jpg|thumb|left|A traditional home in Harar with a niche adorned with Islamic calligraphy.]]\nHarar was captured by Italian troops under Marshall [[Rodolfo Graziani]] during the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]] on 8 May 1937.

A later ruler, Imam [[Muhammed Jasa]], a kinsman of Ahmad Gragn, yielded to the pressures of increasing [[Oromo people|Oromo]] raids and in 1577 abandoned the city, relocating to [[Asaita|Aussa]] and making his brother ruler of Harar. The new base not only failed to provide more security from the Oromos, it attracted the hostile attention of the neighboring [[Afar people|Afars]] who raided caravans traveling between Harar and the coast. The [[Imamate of Aussa|Imams of Aussa]] declined over the next century while Harar regained its independence under [[`Ali ibn Da`ud]], the founder of a dynasty that ruled the city from 1647 until 1875, when it was conquered by [[Egypt]].<ref>Richard Pankhurst, ''The Ethiopian Borderlands'' (Lawrenceville: Red Sea Press, 1997), pp. 375-377</ref>\n\nHarar was very dependent on [[Berbera]] for trade since the Middle Ages.

As a result of this, [[Dire Dawa]] was founded in 1902 as ''New Harar''. The British planned to revitalise the historic Berbera - Harar trade route by connecting the two cities via rail as a means to counter French influence in the region; however, the major infrastructure project was later abandoned.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C1915675|title=Berbera-Harrar Railway Survey Vol. 1|first=}}</ref> \n[[File:Harari Traditions (2202473839).jpg|thumb|left|A traditional home in Harar with a niche adorned with Islamic calligraphy.]]\nHarar was captured by Italian troops under Marshall [[Rodolfo Graziani]] during the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]] on 8 May 1937.

Additionally, there were found different effects onto the targets of the FOXP2 gene in humans in how and whether there was expression of these additional genes. In this way, it is the FOXP2 gene's functioning that allows humans to be able to have language but does not allow chimps this same ability. Researchers deduced that this finding could be used to further study other unique human abilities such as higher up cognitive functioning that chimps are not able to exhibit.

The human variant of FOXP2 also had an effect on the exploratory behavior of the mice. In comparison with how this gene mutation functions in humans, in the humanized mouse model showed opposite effects when testing its effect on the levels of dopamine, plasticity of synapses, patterns of expression in the striatum and behavior that was exploratory in nature.<ref name=\"Enard_2009\" />\n\nWhen FOXP2 expression was altered in mice, it effected many different processes including the learning motor skills and the plasticity of synapses. It makes sense for the gene to have a role in the processing of sensory inputs because of its effects in the cortical and subcortical regions of the brain such as in the olfactory bulb, auditory and visual circuits as well as in somatosensory regions of the thalamus. Additionally, FOXP2 is found more in the sixth layer of the cortex than in the fifth so this is consistent with it having greater roles in sensory integration. FOXP2 was also found in the medial geniculate nucleus of the mouse brain which is the processing area that auditory inputs must go through in the thalamus so it was found that its mutations play a role in delaying the development of language learning. It also makes sense for FOXP2 mutations to have roles in the learning, integrating and outputs of motor functions due to its high expression found in the Purkinje cells and cerebellar nuclei of the Cortico-cerebellar circuits. High FOXP2 expression has also been shown in the spiny neurons which express type 1 dopamine receptors in the striatum, substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus and ventral tegmental area. The negative effects of the mutations of FOXP2 in these brain regions on motor abilities were shown in mice through tasks in lab studies. When analyzing the brain circuitry in these cases, scientists found greater levels of dopamine and decreased lengths of dendrites which caused defects in long term depression which is implicated in motor function learning and maintenance. Through EEG studies, it was also found that these mice had increased levels of activity in their striatum which contribute to these results.

In comparison with how this gene mutation functions in humans, in the humanized mouse model showed opposite effects when testing its effect on the levels of dopamine, plasticity of synapses, patterns of expression in the striatum and behavior that was exploratory in nature.<ref name=\"Enard_2009\" />\n\nWhen FOXP2 expression was altered in mice, it effected many different processes including the learning motor skills and the plasticity of synapses. It makes sense for the gene to have a role in the processing of sensory inputs because of its effects in the cortical and subcortical regions of the brain such as in the olfactory bulb, auditory and visual circuits as well as in somatosensory regions of the thalamus. Additionally, FOXP2 is found more in the sixth layer of the cortex than in the fifth so this is consistent with it having greater roles in sensory integration. FOXP2 was also found in the medial geniculate nucleus of the mouse brain which is the processing area that auditory inputs must go through in the thalamus so it was found that its mutations play a role in delaying the development of language learning. It also makes sense for FOXP2 mutations to have roles in the learning, integrating and outputs of motor functions due to its high expression found in the Purkinje cells and cerebellar nuclei of the Cortico-cerebellar circuits. High FOXP2 expression has also been shown in the spiny neurons which express type 1 dopamine receptors in the striatum, substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus and ventral tegmental area. The negative effects of the mutations of FOXP2 in these brain regions on motor abilities were shown in mice through tasks in lab studies. When analyzing the brain circuitry in these cases, scientists found greater levels of dopamine and decreased lengths of dendrites which caused defects in long term depression which is implicated in motor function learning and maintenance. Through EEG studies, it was also found that these mice had increased levels of activity in their striatum which contribute to these results.

They are Egyptians who have ancestry originating from the [[Levant]], mostly what is now [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]. The majority of Egypt's historic Syro-Lebanese community is [[Christians|Christian]] ([[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Melkite Greek Catholic]], [[Greek Orthodox]], and [[Maronite Catholic]]), although some families were also [[Muslim]] ([[Shia Islam|Shia]]/[[Sunni Islam|Sunni]]) and [[Jewish]].\n\nSince antiquity, there has always been a Levantine presence in Egypt, however, they started becoming a distinctive minority in Egypt around the early 18th century. The majority of Syro-Lebanese migrants who arrived in Egypt during this time were [[Francophone|French-speaking]] and highly influenced by the [[European Culture]]. By the dawn of the 20th century, the Syro-Lebanese of Egypt were considered a powerful and cosmopolitan community that played an important role in both Egypt's economy and culture. \n\nDue to the rise in nationalism along with the loss of economic freedoms during the 1950s, a part of Egypt's Syro-Lebanese community left the country immigrating to the [[Americas]], [[Europe]], and [[Australia]], as well as many returning to their native Lebanon (especially [[Beirut]]) and Syria. Notable descendants of Egypt's Syro-Lebanese community include the world-renowned Egyptian actor [[Omar Sharif]] (born Michel Chalhoub) and Egyptian film director [[Youssef Chahine]].\n\n==History==\nThe relations between Egypt and the [[Levant]] go back to ancient times. However, the earliest instance of modern Levantine migration to Egypt happened after 1724, when a schism in the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch]] resulted in a separate branch of Levantine Christians attached to Rome known as the [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Melkite Greek Catholics]]. Once the Syrian and Lebanese Greek Orthodox community was split, a migratory flow resulted in which Melkite Greek Catholics began leaving cities such as [[Damascus]], [[Aleppo]], [[Zahle]], and [[Sidon]] to move to Egypt. Regarding an early [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite]] presence in Egypt dating from the 18th century, it is said that the [[Holy See|Holy see of Rome]] appointed two Maronite priests to serve as advisers to the [[Franciscans]] who came from the Custody of the Holy Land to [[Evangelism|evangelize]] Egypt because \"no one knows the land and mentality of the Coptic Christians like the Maronites\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Catholics In Egypt Reflect Church's Rich And Varied Traditions |newspaper=L'Osservatore Romano|date=1 March 2000|volume=Weekly Edition in English|pages=6, 7|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CHISTORY/EGPTCATH.HTM}}</ref>[[File:Ikonenwand der Kirche des St. Saba(s), Alexandria, \u00c4gypten.jpg|thumb|Iconostasis of the Greek Orthodox Church of St. Sabbas, Alexandria, Egypt|235x235px]]Later during the mid-1800s, due to the [[1860 Lebanon conflict|political conflict]] that existed in Lebanon and Syria between the [[Christians|Christian]] and [[Druze]] religious sects, many [[Syrian people|Syrian]] and [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] Christians, as well as [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] and [[Jordanian people|Jordanian]] Christians to some extent, migrated to Egypt under the rule of [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]]. These Syro-Lebanese or [[Levant]]ine Christians, known in Egyptian Arabic as the \"Shawam\", were either of Greek Orthodox or Catholic (Melkite or Maronite) extraction. The reason immigrants from Lebanon and Syria were considered one ethnic group was because during the mid-1800s, Lebanon was not yet an independent state and was still part of [[Ottoman Syria]], or \"Bilad al-Sham\" in Arabic, hence their label as \"Shawam\" or \"Shami\".  Muhammad Ali Pasha endorsed various ethnic and religious groups, including Syro-Lebanese, [[Greeks in Egypt|Greeks]], [[Armenians in Egypt|Armenians]], [[Jews in Egypt|Jews]], [[Italians in Egypt|Italians]], and [[Maltese in Egypt|Maltese]] to settle in Egypt.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sol\u00e9|first=Robert|title=Birds of Passage|year=2000|publisher=Harvill Press|location=London, England|isbn=1860466974|url=https://archive.org/details/birdsofpassage00robe}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Sol\u00e9|first=Robert|title=Le Tarbouche|year=1992|publisher=Seuil|location=Paris|isbn=978-2020205108}}</ref>\nFrom the building of the Suez Canal to the creation of modern Downtown Cairo, Egypt\u2019s rulers went on a spending spree that attracted migrants from across the world. The Syro-Lebanese, who first migrated were [[French language|French-speaking]] and well-educated (largely due to [[Europe|European]] and [[American Home Missionary Society|American missionaries]]), had a mindset in the British-run economy of Egypt at the time. As a result, they were able to flourish as an energetic and cosmopolitan community until the [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] era of the mid-1950s, that adopted an Arabization mind set for the entire region.  Most of the Syro-Lebanese were self-employed businessmen or [[Artisan|craftsmen]] and had more of a \"[[Westernization|Westernized]]\" education than others. [[Robert Sol\u00e9]], a [[France|French]] author of Levantine-Egyptian descent, describes all of these aspects of the Syro-Lebanese community in Egypt in his book, \"Birds of Passage\", as well as in his other publications.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sol\u00e9|first=Robert|title=Birds of Passage|year=2000|publisher=Harvill Press|location=London, England|isbn=1860466974|url=https://archive.org/details/birdsofpassage00robe}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Sol\u00e9|first=Robert|title=Le Tarbouche|year=1992|publisher=Seuil|location=Paris|isbn=978-2020205108}}</ref>\n\nThe Syro-Lebanese established [[Greek Catholic Church|Melkite Greek-Catholic]] and Maronite Catholic churches throughout many areas of Egypt such as [[Cairo]], [[Alexandria]], [[Mansoura]], [[Suez]], [[Port Said]], and [[Tanta]]. The Greek Orthodox Syro-Lebanese experienced conflict trying to establish their own churches under their native [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch|Antiochian]] denomination, and became under the jurisdiction of the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], which was mainly run by an ethnic Greek clergy. \nIn Egypt, many families of Syro-Lebanese origin became successful in Egypt's business sector along with the established Armenian and Greek communities. Many were involved in Egypt's booming cotton industry. The famous Egyptian newspaper, \"[[Al-Ahram]]\", was created by the Syro-Lebanese Takla family in Egypt.<ref>{{cite book|last=Khoury|first=G\u00e9rard D.|title=S\u00e9lim Takla 1895-1945: Une Contribution \u00e0 L'ind\u00e9pendance Du Liban|year=2004|publisher=Karthala Editions|isbn=284586549X|pages=556|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iluH1VqaI5UC&pg=RA2-PA21-IA4&lpg=RA2-PA21-IA4&dq=takla+al-ahram&source=bl&ots=0Ndyxbiba-&sig=HvZt7lNGQuqPDa_VChc7ZGpB8bM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=6zHRULeAF-XL0AGH4oDAAw&ved=0CEgQ6AEwAw}}</ref>\nSyro-Lebanese families dominated the publishing industry, owning major printing houses like Dar al-Hilal (est. 1892), which gave them enormous influence on the country\u2019s cultural life. Even Rose al-Youssef, the quintessential Egyptian cultural figure from the first half of the twentieth century, was originally Levantine of Turkish descent. The (then) irreverent political and literary magazine she founded and named after herself continues to this day, albeit in state hands like Al-Ahram. Even the material culture of Cairo has been suffused by Syro-Lebanese influence. The most prolific architect in Central Cairo between the 1930s and 1960s was Antoine Selim Nahhas, who is seen as the one of the modernist architects in Egypt. Nahhas, who built among other important buildings the Beirut National Museum, established a wildly successful practice in Cairo, where he designed buildings for the rich and famous, often Levantine-Egyptians like himself, such as the actor Farid al-Atrash. [[File:Syro-Lebanese Christian women.jpg|thumb|235x235px|Christian Syro-Lebanese women in [[Cairo]], Egypt (1950)|alt=]]Even though the number of Levantine-Egyptians still in Egypt is drastically low today, the Syro-Lebanese community retains its strength in some aspects of the cultural and entertainment industries.

Their aggregate wealth was reckoned at one and a half billion francs, that is 10% of the Egyptian GDP. Those who had capital invested it in small businesses (oil, soaps, tobacco, patisserie). Others created more important companies trading or producing salt, sodium, textiles, perfume, wood, silk. This economic success led to the foundation of schools, clubs, and charities, generally linked to a place of worship which was most of the time a church. A minority returned to their home village but the majority remained \u201csemi-detached\u201d, settling for several generations in Egypt without for all that involving themselves fully in the host society.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fadel|first=Marwan Abi|title=Syro-Lebanese Migration Towards Egypt|url=http://hemed.univ-lemans.fr/cours2010/en/co/module_5.html}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Mansoura]], a city that used to be under huge [[France|French]] and [[Europe|European]] influence. The Levantines excelled equally as lawyers, cotton trade entrepreneurs, large real-estate owners, medical doctors and pharmacists, department store and restaurant and hotel owners, bankers, and financial agents. They were also renowned for their large estates, like the heirs of Comte Khalil de Saab and the Sussah family, Naguib Bek Sursuq, and the 'izba of George Daoud. They owned several international hotels. For instance, Khalil Bahari owned the Semiramis Hotel, which included the best restaurant in Mansoura. Dhaher al-Rayyes was the owner of the largest hotel in Mansoura, the [[Paris]] Hotel, while his brother, Bichara, owned the Claridge Hotel, and a third brother owned the Imperial Hotel. The Shawam of Mansoura occupied key positions as medical doctors, showing why nearly half of the doctors in Mansoura used to be foreigners at that time, mainly Europeans. Levantines also notably became bank managers. Some Shawam earned the titles of Count, like Count Saab and Count Chedid. Others earned the titles of Pasha and Bek, while a few even earned the title of Emir (Prince), like the Lutfallah, and subsequently the [[Sursock family|Sursock]], family.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abaza|first1=Mona|title=The Cotton Plantation Remembered: An Egyptian Family Story|date=15 November 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n\n==Identity==\n\nThe term \"Syro-Lebanese\" or \"Syrian-Lebanese\" is an [[umbrella term]] to identify the people of the Levant, especially the generations who lived when most of the region was known as [[Bilad al-Sham]], or [[Greater Syria]]. Between the late 18th century and early 20th century, thousands of Levantines left their homeland, mainly due to warfare, and Egypt became the first stop for many who aimed to reach the Western world. In Egypt, as well as other nations with Syrian and Lebanese diaspora communities, the Levantines mainly identified by religion and city of origin, rather than by ethnicity. For example, one could identify as a \"[[Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholic]] from [[Zahle]]\", while another could identify as \"[[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] from [[Aleppo]]\". For the most part, religious denomination and city of origin were more important to the Levantines than an actual \"Levantine\" or \"Syro-Lebanese\" identity. This may explain why it was generally easy for the Syro-Lebanese to assimilate into their newly found homelands and mix with other Christian populations, especially in Egypt. However, the Egyptians, and especially the Coptic [[Coptic Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], could easily point out a Levantine's non-native background due to their foreign Christian background, if not by their overall lighter skin tone. After generations of living in Egypt, most of this community's descendants, now with Egyptian nationality, tended to identify more as \"Egyptian\", rather than \"Levantine\", \"Syrian\", or \"Lebanese\", while still maintaining their original [[christian Denomination|Christian sect]] of identity. However, intermarriage for the Levantines in Egypt eventually became more common after generations, either with native Coptic Christians whom are in millions or with other foreign minority Christians such as [[Greek people|Greeks]], [[Armenian people|Armenians]], and [[Maltese people|Maltese]]. There was much less intermarriage between Levantine Christians and native Muslims, as marriage between Christians and Muslims is still considered taboo in Egypt.\n\n==Churches==\n\n[[Christianity]] is the dominant religion among Egyptians of Syro-Lebanese descent. The majority follow Greek Orthodox (originally [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch|Greek Orthodox Antiochian]], but then falling under [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Greek Orthodox Alexandrian]] jurisdiction in Egypt), a founder sect of Christianity since the [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman Egypt]], [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church]] and the [[Maronite Church]]. With [[Catholic school|Catholic education]] being popular among [[Christianity|Christian]] families in Egypt, many Levantines also naturally attended [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic churches]].\n\n\u2022 Greek Orthodox Churches ([[Greece|Greek]] [[Christian denomination|Church]]es):\n\n* [[Cairo]] - Greek Orthodox Church of St. George, Greek Catholic Cathedral of the Resurrection, Greek Catholic Annunciation Church, Greek Catholic Immaculate Conception Church, Greek Catholic St. George Church, Greek Catholic St. Mary of Peace Church, Greek Catholic St. Joseph Church, Greek Catholic St. Cyril Church\n* [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]] - Greek Catholic Dormition Cathedral, Saint Sabbas Greek Orthodox Church, Greek Catholic Immaculate Conception, Greek Catholic St. Joseph, \n* [[Damanhur]] - Saints Constantine and Helena Greek Orthodox Church\n* [[Damietta]] - Saint Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church, and an old Greek Catholic Church that was converted to a Coptic Orthodox Church.\n* [[El-Mahalla El-Kubra]] - Saint George Greek Orthodox Church, Saint Augustine Catholic Church\n* [[Mansoura]] - Saint Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church, Saints Athanasius and Cyril Greek Orthodox Church, Dormition Greek Catholic Church\n* [[Port Said]] - Saint Elias Greek Catholic Church\n* [[Shibin Al Kawm, Al Minufiyah|Shibin Al Kawm]] - Saint Spyridon Greek Orthodox Church\n* [[Tanta]] - Saint George Greek Orthodox Church, Dormition of the Holy Virgin Greek Orthodox Church, Presentation of the Lord Greek Orthodox Church, Saint Anne Greek Catholic Church\n* [[Zagazig]] - Three Hierarchs Greek Orthodox Church, Dormition of the Holy Virgin Greek Orthodox Church, Saint Joseph Catholic Church\n\n==Diaspora==\nThe number of Syro-Lebanese in Egypt has decreased due to the nationalization policies of the [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] government after the [[1952 Revolution|1952 revolution]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} As a result, there has been extensive migrations to other countries such as [[Canada]], the [[United States]], [[France]], [[Australia]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Belgium]]. The remaining Syro-Lebanese in Egypt began integrating into the rest of Egyptian society, including extensive intermarriage with [[Coptic Orthodox Church|Coptic Christians]] and Muslims. Today, most Egyptians of Levantine roots tend to identify more as Egyptian rather than Syrian or Lebanese, even though some traditionally belong to [[List of Christian denominations|Christian denominations]] like [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] other than Egypt's native [[Coptic Orthodox]], [[Coptic Catholic]], or native Protestant churches.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tewfik|first1=Paul Shoukri|title=The Syro-Lebanese of Egypt|date=17 December 2012}}</ref>{{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nA large number of Syro-Lebanese families from Egypt now reside in [[Montreal]]; The communities of [[St. George Antiochian Orthodox Church (Montreal)|St. George Antiochian Orthodox Church]], Saint-Sauveur Melkite Greek-Catholic Cathedral, and St. Maron Church (Maronite Catholic), have many parishioners who are from Egypt or are descendants of Egyptian immigrants.

Notable descendants of Egypt's Syro-Lebanese community include the world-renowned Egyptian actor [[Omar Sharif]] (born Michel Chalhoub) and Egyptian film director [[Youssef Chahine]].\n\n==History==\nThe relations between Egypt and the [[Levant]] go back to ancient times. However, the earliest instance of modern Levantine migration to Egypt happened after 1724, when a schism in the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch]] resulted in a separate branch of Levantine Christians attached to Rome known as the [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Melkite Greek Catholics]]. Once the Syrian and Lebanese Greek Orthodox community was split, a migratory flow resulted in which Melkite Greek Catholics began leaving cities such as [[Damascus]], [[Aleppo]], [[Zahle]], and [[Sidon]] to move to Egypt. Regarding an early [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite]] presence in Egypt dating from the 18th century, it is said that the [[Holy See|Holy see of Rome]] appointed two Maronite priests to serve as advisers to the [[Franciscans]] who came from the Custody of the Holy Land to [[Evangelism|evangelize]] Egypt because \"no one knows the land and mentality of the Coptic Christians like the Maronites\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Catholics In Egypt Reflect Church's Rich And Varied Traditions |newspaper=L'Osservatore Romano|date=1 March 2000|volume=Weekly Edition in English|pages=6, 7|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CHISTORY/EGPTCATH.HTM}}</ref>[[File:Ikonenwand der Kirche des St. Saba(s), Alexandria, \u00c4gypten.jpg|thumb|Iconostasis of the Greek Orthodox Church of St. Sabbas, Alexandria, Egypt|235x235px]]Later during the mid-1800s, due to the [[1860 Lebanon conflict|political conflict]] that existed in Lebanon and Syria between the [[Christians|Christian]] and [[Druze]] religious sects, many [[Syrian people|Syrian]] and [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] Christians, as well as [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] and [[Jordanian people|Jordanian]] Christians to some extent, migrated to Egypt under the rule of [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]]. These Syro-Lebanese or [[Levant]]ine Christians, known in Egyptian Arabic as the \"Shawam\", were either of Greek Orthodox or Catholic (Melkite or Maronite) extraction. The reason immigrants from Lebanon and Syria were considered one ethnic group was because during the mid-1800s, Lebanon was not yet an independent state and was still part of [[Ottoman Syria]], or \"Bilad al-Sham\" in Arabic, hence their label as \"Shawam\" or \"Shami\".  Muhammad Ali Pasha endorsed various ethnic and religious groups, including Syro-Lebanese, [[Greeks in Egypt|Greeks]], [[Armenians in Egypt|Armenians]], [[Jews in Egypt|Jews]], [[Italians in Egypt|Italians]], and [[Maltese in Egypt|Maltese]] to settle in Egypt.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sol\u00e9|first=Robert|title=Birds of Passage|year=2000|publisher=Harvill Press|location=London, England|isbn=1860466974|url=https://archive.org/details/birdsofpassage00robe}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Sol\u00e9|first=Robert|title=Le Tarbouche|year=1992|publisher=Seuil|location=Paris|isbn=978-2020205108}}</ref>\nFrom the building of the Suez Canal to the creation of modern Downtown Cairo, Egypt\u2019s rulers went on a spending spree that attracted migrants from across the world. The Syro-Lebanese, who first migrated were [[French language|French-speaking]] and well-educated (largely due to [[Europe|European]] and [[American Home Missionary Society|American missionaries]]), had a mindset in the British-run economy of Egypt at the time. As a result, they were able to flourish as an energetic and cosmopolitan community until the [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] era of the mid-1950s, that adopted an Arabization mind set for the entire region.  Most of the Syro-Lebanese were self-employed businessmen or [[Artisan|craftsmen]] and had more of a \"[[Westernization|Westernized]]\" education than others. [[Robert Sol\u00e9]], a [[France|French]] author of Levantine-Egyptian descent, describes all of these aspects of the Syro-Lebanese community in Egypt in his book, \"Birds of Passage\", as well as in his other publications.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sol\u00e9|first=Robert|title=Birds of Passage|year=2000|publisher=Harvill Press|location=London, England|isbn=1860466974|url=https://archive.org/details/birdsofpassage00robe}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Sol\u00e9|first=Robert|title=Le Tarbouche|year=1992|publisher=Seuil|location=Paris|isbn=978-2020205108}}</ref>\n\nThe Syro-Lebanese established [[Greek Catholic Church|Melkite Greek-Catholic]] and Maronite Catholic churches throughout many areas of Egypt such as [[Cairo]], [[Alexandria]], [[Mansoura]], [[Suez]], [[Port Said]], and [[Tanta]]. The Greek Orthodox Syro-Lebanese experienced conflict trying to establish their own churches under their native [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch|Antiochian]] denomination, and became under the jurisdiction of the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], which was mainly run by an ethnic Greek clergy. \nIn Egypt, many families of Syro-Lebanese origin became successful in Egypt's business sector along with the established Armenian and Greek communities. Many were involved in Egypt's booming cotton industry. The famous Egyptian newspaper, \"[[Al-Ahram]]\", was created by the Syro-Lebanese Takla family in Egypt.<ref>{{cite book|last=Khoury|first=G\u00e9rard D.|title=S\u00e9lim Takla 1895-1945: Une Contribution \u00e0 L'ind\u00e9pendance Du Liban|year=2004|publisher=Karthala Editions|isbn=284586549X|pages=556|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iluH1VqaI5UC&pg=RA2-PA21-IA4&lpg=RA2-PA21-IA4&dq=takla+al-ahram&source=bl&ots=0Ndyxbiba-&sig=HvZt7lNGQuqPDa_VChc7ZGpB8bM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=6zHRULeAF-XL0AGH4oDAAw&ved=0CEgQ6AEwAw}}</ref>\nSyro-Lebanese families dominated the publishing industry, owning major printing houses like Dar al-Hilal (est. 1892), which gave them enormous influence on the country\u2019s cultural life. Even Rose al-Youssef, the quintessential Egyptian cultural figure from the first half of the twentieth century, was originally Levantine of Turkish descent. The (then) irreverent political and literary magazine she founded and named after herself continues to this day, albeit in state hands like Al-Ahram. Even the material culture of Cairo has been suffused by Syro-Lebanese influence. The most prolific architect in Central Cairo between the 1930s and 1960s was Antoine Selim Nahhas, who is seen as the one of the modernist architects in Egypt. Nahhas, who built among other important buildings the Beirut National Museum, established a wildly successful practice in Cairo, where he designed buildings for the rich and famous, often Levantine-Egyptians like himself, such as the actor Farid al-Atrash. [[File:Syro-Lebanese Christian women.jpg|thumb|235x235px|Christian Syro-Lebanese women in Cairo, Egypt 1950's|alt=]]Even though the number of Levantine-Egyptians still in Egypt is drastically low today, the Syro-Lebanese community retains its strength in some aspects of the cultural and entertainment industries.

Their aggregate wealth was reckoned at one and a half billion francs, that is 10% of the Egyptian GDP. Those who had capital invested it in small businesses (oil, soaps, tobacco, patisserie). Others created more important companies trading or producing salt, sodium, textiles, perfume, wood, silk. This economic success led to the foundation of schools, clubs, and charities, generally linked to a place of worship which was most of the time a church. A minority returned to their home village but the majority remained \u201csemi-detached\u201d, settling for several generations in Egypt without for all that involving themselves fully in the host society.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fadel|first=Marwan Abi|title=Syro-Lebanese Migration Towards Egypt|url=http://hemed.univ-lemans.fr/cours2010/en/co/module_5.html}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Mansoura]], a city that used to be under huge [[France|French]] and [[Europe|European]] influence. The Levantines excelled equally as lawyers, cotton trade entrepreneurs, large real-estate owners, medical doctors and pharmacists, department store and restaurant and hotel owners, bankers, and financial agents. They were also renowned for their large estates, like the heirs of Comte Khalil de Saab and the Sussah family, Naguib Bek Sursuq, and the 'izba of George Daoud. They owned several international hotels. For instance, Khalil Bahari owned the Semiramis Hotel, which included the best restaurant in Mansoura. Dhaher al-Rayyes was the owner of the largest hotel in Mansoura, the [[Paris]] Hotel, while his brother, Bichara, owned the Claridge Hotel, and a third brother owned the Imperial Hotel. The Shawam of Mansoura occupied key positions as medical doctors, showing why nearly half of the doctors in Mansoura used to be foreigners at that time, mainly Europeans. Levantines also notably became bank managers. Some Shawam earned the titles of Count, like Count Saab and Count Chedid. Others earned the titles of Pasha and Bek, while a few even earned the title of Emir (Prince), like the Lutfallah, and subsequently the [[Sursock family|Sursock]], family.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abaza|first1=Mona|title=The Cotton Plantation Remembered: An Egyptian Family Story|date=15 November 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n\n==Identity==\n\nThe term \"Syro-Lebanese\" or \"Syrian-Lebanese\" is an [[umbrella term]] to identify the people of the Levant, especially the generations who lived when most of the region was known as [[Bilad al-Sham]], or [[Greater Syria]]. Between the late 18th century and early 20th century, thousands of Levantines left their homeland, mainly due to warfare, and Egypt became the first stop for many who aimed to reach the Western world. In Egypt, as well as other nations with Syrian and Lebanese diaspora communities, the Levantines mainly identified by religion and city of origin, rather than by ethnicity. For example, one could identify as a \"[[Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholic]] from [[Zahle]]\", while another could identify as \"[[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] from [[Aleppo]]\". For the most part, religious denomination and city of origin were more important to the Levantines than an actual \"Levantine\" or \"Syro-Lebanese\" identity. This may explain why it was generally easy for the Syro-Lebanese to assimilate into their newly found homelands and mix with other Christian populations, especially in Egypt. However, the Egyptians, and especially the Coptic [[Coptic Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], could easily point out a Levantine's non-native background due to their foreign Christian background, if not by their overall lighter skin tone. After generations of living in Egypt, most of this community's descendants, now with Egyptian nationality, tended to identify more as \"Egyptian\", rather than \"Levantine\", \"Syrian\", or \"Lebanese\", while still maintaining their original [[christian Denomination|Christian sect]] of identity. However, intermarriage for the Levantines in Egypt eventually became more common after generations, either with native Coptic Christians whom are in millions or with other foreign minority Christians such as [[Greek people|Greeks]], [[Armenian people|Armenians]], and [[Maltese people|Maltese]]. There was much less intermarriage between Levantine Christians and native Muslims, as marriage between Christians and Muslims is still considered taboo in Egypt.\n\n==Churches==\n\n[[Christianity]] is the dominant religion among Egyptians of Syro-Lebanese descent. The majority follow Greek Orthodox (originally [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch|Greek Orthodox Antiochian]], but then falling under [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Greek Orthodox Alexandrian]] jurisdiction in Egypt), a founder sect of Christianity since the [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman Egypt]], [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church]] and the [[Maronite Church]]. With [[Catholic school|Catholic education]] being popular among [[Christianity|Christian]] families in Egypt, many Levantines also naturally attended [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic churches]].\n\n\u2022 Greek Orthodox Churches ([[Greece|Greek]] [[Christian denomination|Church]]es):\n\n* [[Cairo]] - Greek Orthodox Church of St. George, Greek Catholic Cathedral of the Resurrection, Greek Catholic Annunciation Church, Greek Catholic Immaculate Conception Church, Greek Catholic St. George Church, Greek Catholic St. Mary of Peace Church, Greek Catholic St. Joseph Church, Greek Catholic St. Cyril Church\n* [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]] - Greek Catholic Dormition Cathedral, Saint Sabbas Greek Orthodox Church, Greek Catholic Immaculate Conception, Greek Catholic St. Joseph, \n* [[Damanhur]] - Saints Constantine and Helena Greek Orthodox Church\n* [[Damietta]] - Saint Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church, and an old Greek Catholic Church that was converted to a Coptic Orthodox Church.\n* [[El-Mahalla El-Kubra]] - Saint George Greek Orthodox Church, Saint Augustine Catholic Church\n* [[Mansoura]] - Saint Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church, Saints Athanasius and Cyril Greek Orthodox Church, Dormition Greek Catholic Church\n* [[Port Said]] - Saint Elias Greek Catholic Church\n* [[Shibin Al Kawm, Al Minufiyah|Shibin Al Kawm]] - Saint Spyridon Greek Orthodox Church\n* [[Tanta]] - Saint George Greek Orthodox Church, Dormition of the Holy Virgin Greek Orthodox Church, Presentation of the Lord Greek Orthodox Church, Saint Anne Greek Catholic Church\n* [[Zagazig]] - Three Hierarchs Greek Orthodox Church, Dormition of the Holy Virgin Greek Orthodox Church, Saint Joseph Catholic Church\n\n==Diaspora==\nThe number of Syro-Lebanese in Egypt has decreased due to the nationalization policies of the [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] government after the [[1952 Revolution|1952 revolution]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} As a result, there has been extensive migrations to other countries such as [[Canada]], the [[United States]], [[France]], [[Australia]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Belgium]]. The remaining Syro-Lebanese in Egypt began integrating into the rest of Egyptian society, including extensive intermarriage with [[Coptic Orthodox Church|Coptic Christians]] and Muslims. Today, most Egyptians of Levantine roots tend to identify more as Egyptian rather than Syrian or Lebanese, even though some traditionally belong to [[List of Christian denominations|Christian denominations]] like [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] other than Egypt's native [[Coptic Orthodox]], [[Coptic Catholic]], or native Protestant churches.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tewfik|first1=Paul Shoukri|title=The Syro-Lebanese of Egypt|date=17 December 2012}}</ref>{{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nA large number of Syro-Lebanese families from Egypt now reside in [[Montreal]]; The communities of [[St. George Antiochian Orthodox Church (Montreal)|St. George Antiochian Orthodox Church]], Saint-Sauveur Melkite Greek-Catholic Cathedral, and St. Maron Church (Maronite Catholic), have many parishioners who are from Egypt or are descendants of Egyptian immigrants.

User-centered design involves simplifying the structure of tasks, making things visible, getting the mapping right, exploiting the powers of constraint, designing for error, explaining [[affordance]]s and [[seven stages of action]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn his book ''The Things that Make Us Smart: Defending the Human Attribute in the Age of the Machine'',<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D0201626950/donnormanA/104-2013751-2967137|title=Things That Make us Smart: Defending Human Attributes in the Age of the Machine|last1=Norman|first1=Don|date=1993|publisher=Pursues Book Group}}</ref>{{Better source|date=April 2019}} Norman uses the term \u201ccognitive artifacts\u201d to describe \u201cthose artificial devices that maintain, display, or operate upon information in order to serve a representational function and that affect human cognitive performance\u201d.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} Similar to his ''The Design of Everyday Things'' book, Norman argues for the development of machines that fit our minds, rather than have our minds be conformed to the machine.\n\nOn the Revised Edition of ''The Design of Everyday Things,'' Norman backtracks on his previous claims about aesthetics and removed the term User-Centered Design altogether. In the preface of the book, he says :<blockquote>The first edition of the book focused upon making products understandable and usable. The total experience of a product covers much more than its usability: aesthetics, pleasure, and fun play critically important roles. There was no discussion of pleasure, enjoyment and emotion, Emotion is so important that I wrote an entire book, [[Emotional Design]], about the role it plays in design.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The design of everyday things|last=Norman, Donald A.|isbn=9780465050659|edition= Revised and expanded |location=New York, New York|oclc=849801329|date = November 5, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>He instead currently uses the term human-centered design and defines it as: \"an approach that puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving.\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\nHe is on numerous educational, private, and public sector advisory boards, including the editorial board of ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''.
