Released on May 11, 1989 through the [[Modern Records (1980)|Modern]] label, the album was recorded in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], mixed in [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]], and is loosely based around the theme of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s 1865 novel ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''.\n\nThe album was a commercial success. It reached number ten on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], propelled by the hit single \"[[Rooms on Fire]]\" (US #16), and achieved Platinum status for selling in excess of 1,000,000 units.

{"title_page": "Religiosity", "text_new": "'''Religiosity''' is difficult to define, but different scholars have seen this concept as broadly about religious orientations and involvement. It includes experiential, ritualistic, ideological, intellectual, consequential, creedal, communal, doctrinal, moral, and cultural dimensions.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Holdcroft|first1=Barbara|title=What is Religiosity?|journal=Catholic Education: A Journal of Inquiry and Practice|date=September 2006|volume=10|issue=1|pages=89\u2013103}}</ref> Sociologists of religion have observed that the people's beliefs, sense of belonging, and behavior often are not congruent with an individual's actual religious beliefs since there is much diversity in how one can be religious or not.<ref name=\"chaves\" /> Multiple problems exist in measuring religiosity.

People\u2019s religious ideas are fragmented, loosely connected, and context-dependent; like in all other domains of culture and in life. The beliefs, affiliations, and behaviors of any individual are complex activities that have many sources including culture. As examples of religious incongruence he notes, \"Observant Jews may not believe what they say in their Sabbath prayers. Christian ministers may not believe in God.

What most have found is that there are multiple dimensions (they often employ [[factor analysis]]). For instance, Cornwall, Albrecht, Cunningham and Pitcher (1986) identify six dimensions of religiosity based on the understanding that there are at least three components to religious behavior: knowing (cognition in the mind), feeling (effect to the spirit), and doing (behavior of the body). For each of these components of religiosity, there were two cross classifications resulting in the six dimensions:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cornwall |author2=Albrecht |author3=Cunningham |author4=Pitcher |title=The Dimensions of Religiosity: A Conceptual Model with an Empirical Test|journal=Review of Religious Research|year=1986|volume=27|issue=3|pages=226\u2013244|doi=10.2307/3511418|jstor=3511418 }}</ref>\n*Cognition\n**traditional [[orthodoxy]]\n**particularistic orthodoxy\n*Effect\n**Palpable\n**Tangible\n*Behavior\n**religious behavior\n**religious participation\n\nOther researchers have found different dimensions, ranging generally from four to twelve components. What most measures of religiosity find is that there is at least some distinction between religious doctrine, religious practice, and [[spirituality]].\n\nFor example{{original research inline|date=February 2011}}, one can accept the truthfulness of the [[Bible]] (belief dimension), but never attend a church or even belong to an organized religion (practice dimension).  Another example is an individual who does not hold orthodox [[Christian doctrine]]s (belief dimension), but does attend a [[Charismatic Movement|charismatic]] [[worship]] service (practice dimension) in order to develop his/her sense of oneness with the [[divinity|divine]] (spirituality dimension).\n\nAn individual could disavow all doctrines associated with organized religions (belief dimension), not affiliate with an organized religion or attend religious services (practice dimension), and at the same time be strongly committed to a higher power and feel that the connection with that higher power is ultimately relevant (spirituality dimension). These are explanatory examples of the broadest dimensions of religiosity and may not be reflected in specific religiosity measures.\n\nMost dimensions of religiosity are correlated, meaning people who often attend church services (practice dimension) are also likely to score highly on the belief and spirituality dimensions. But individuals do not have to score high on all dimensions or low on all dimensions; their scores can vary by dimension.\n\n[[Sociologists]] have differed over the exact number of components of religiosity. [[Charles Y. Glock|Charles Glock]]'s five-dimensional approach (Glock, 1972: 39) was among the first of its kind in the field of [[sociology of religion]].<ref>Glock, C. Y. (1972) \u2018On the Study of Religious Commitment\u2019 in J. E. Faulkner (ed.) Religion\u2019s Influence in Contemporary Society, Readings \nin the Sociology of Religion, Ohio: Charles E.

People\u2019s religious ideas are fragmented, loosely connected, and context-dependent; like in all other domains of culture and in life. The beliefs, affiliations, and behaviors of any individual are complex activities that have many sources including culture.

What most have found is that there are multiple dimensions (they often employ [[factor analysis]]). For instance, Cornwall, Albrecht, Cunningham and Pitcher (1986) identify six dimensions of religiosity based on the understanding that there are at least three components to religious behavior: knowing (cognition in the mind), feeling (effect to the spirit), and doing (behavior of the body). For each of these components of religiosity, there were two cross classifications resulting in the six dimensions:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cornwall |author2=Albrecht |author3=Cunningham |author4=Pitcher |title=The Dimensions of Religiosity: A Conceptual Model with an Empirical Test|journal=Review of Religious Research|year=1986|volume=27|issue=3|pages=226\u2013244|doi=10.2307/3511418|jstor=3511418 }}</ref>\n*Cognition\n**traditional [[orthodoxy]]\n**particularistic orthodoxy\n*Effect\n**Palpable\n**Tangible\n*Behavior\n**religious behavior\n**religious participation\n\nOther researchers have found different dimensions, ranging generally from four to twelve components. What most measures of religiosity find is that there is at least some distinction between religious doctrine, religious practice, and [[spirituality]].\n\nFor example{{original research inline|date=February 2011}}, one can accept the truthfulness of the [[Bible]] (belief dimension), but never attend a church or even belong to an organized religion (practice dimension).  Another example is an individual who does not hold orthodox [[Christian doctrine]]s (belief dimension), but does attend a [[Charismatic Movement|charismatic]] [[worship]] service (practice dimension) in order to develop his/her sense of oneness with the [[divinity|divine]] (spirituality dimension).\n\nAn individual could disavow all doctrines associated with organized religions (belief dimension), not affiliate with an organized religion or attend religious services (practice dimension), and at the same time be strongly committed to a higher power and feel that the connection with that higher power is ultimately relevant (spirituality dimension). These are explanatory examples of the broadest dimensions of religiosity and may not be reflected in specific religiosity measures.\n\nMost dimensions of religiosity are correlated, meaning people who often attend church services (practice dimension) are also likely to score highly on the belief and spirituality dimensions. But individuals do not have to score high on all dimensions or low on all dimensions; their scores can vary by dimension.\n\n[[Sociologists]] have differed over the exact number of components of religiosity. [[Charles Y. Glock|Charles Glock]]'s five-dimensional approach (Glock, 1972: 39) was among the first of its kind in the field of [[sociology of religion]].<ref>Glock, C. Y.

It was written and produced by Jackson, [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]]. The track was sent to [[contemporary hit radio]] in the US on May 23, 2000, after an [[Mastering (audio)|unmastered]] version was leaked to several radio stations. It is an upbeat [[electropop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Dance music|dance]] song with a syncopated drum loop and [[bassline]].

It then pans from a panoramic nighttime city view to a scene of Jackson singing from her bed in a confined apartment. During this scene, the AIBO and various objects in her room are shown, including a television displaying ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'', and a pair of [[moon shoes]]. Jackson then grabs a beverage from her fridge and starts singing in front of a mirror containing visually animated animal stickers. Four of her friends knock at her door and Jackson leaves with them. They dance through the apartment block hallway as their shoes morph into black futuristic high-heels, walking into an area filled with display screens and a circular platform.\n\nDuring the song's breakdown, they perform a choreographed dance routine on the tilting platform. The scenes are intercut with Jackson drawing an orange swirl and the AIBO watching the film in her apartment. Various people are also seen drawing orange swirls. In the next segment, Jackson is shown in the passenger seat of a car driving through a tunnel, as scenes from ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' appear as a reflection in the front window. The video concludes with a [[slow motion]] shot of Jackson falling backwards onto her bed and the AIBO resting in front of her.\n\n===Reception===\nWriting for DVD Movie Guide, Colin Jacobson praised the music video for deviating from the standard \"lip-synch/film snippet formula\" used among pop videos at the time, stating that it \"stands on its own\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/klumpsuncensored.shtml|title=Nutty Professor II: The Klumps \u2013 Uncensored Director's Cut (2000)|website=DVD Movie Guide|last=Jacobson|first=Colin|year=2000|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}</ref> Rod Stafford Hagwood of the ''Sun-Sentinel'' included \"Doesn't Really Matter\" among several videos which set fashion trends and increased the popularity of \"bright colorful clothes\" among youth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-08-08/lifestyle/0008070457_1_colors-young-women-video|title=What Are The Coolest Kids Wearing This Fall?

It was written and produced by Jackson, [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]]. The track was sent to [[contemporary hit radio]] in the US on May 23, 2000, after an [[Mastering (audio)|unmastered]] version was leaked to several radio stations. It is an upbeat [[electropop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Dance music|dance]] song with a syncopated drum loop and [[bassline]]. Based on a previously discarded poem Jackson wrote, the lyrics are about her film character's love for [[The Nutty Professor (character)|The Nutty Professor]].\n\nThe track received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised its upbeat sound and Jackson's [[breathy voice]]. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three consecutive weeks, becoming the singer's ninth US chart-topper. It was Jackson's 19th single to be certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), making her only the third singer, after [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Whitney Houston]], to achieve this feat. The song peaked at number five on the [[UK Singles Chart]], becoming Jackson's 15th single to reach the top 10 in the UK. It also peaked within the top 10 in Canada, Denmark, Poland, Italy, and Spain.\n\nThe [[Joseph Kahn]]-directed music video resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. It features an [[AIBO]], a prototype of the [[Acura CL]]-X, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a tilting platform. Production of the video costed over $2.5 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|2.5|2000|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}), making it one of the [[list of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos of all time]]. To promote the single, Jackson performed it on British television program ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and at the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards]]. The song was also performed during four of the singer's concert tours, and her 2019 Las Vegas residency, [[Janet Jackson: Metamorphosis]].\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Doesn't Really Matter|others=[[Janet Jackson]]|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Def Jam Records]]|id=562 916-2|location=New York City}}</ref> When asked to contribute a single for the [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], Jackson stated that she would consider if she found an appropriate song.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]|edition=3|page=902|isbn=0823077381}}</ref> The single would allow Jackson to continue releasing music, while simultaneously devoting time to her film career.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Action Jackson|magazine=[[USA Weekend]]|date=July 21\u201323, 2000|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T9cDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA181#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Janet at the Crossroads|last=Norment|first=Lynn|magazine=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|volume=41|number=1|page=181|date=November 2000|access-date=April 12, 2020}}</ref> To help inspire Jackson, director [[Peter Segal]] brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios where the singer was recording her seventh album, ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''.

Jackson wrote further lyrics for the song during the same night Jam came up with the melody alongside drum programmer Alex Richburg.<ref name=\"Bronson\"/> After an early version of the song was created, Jackson requested Jam and Richburg to add more instrumentation, however Jam decided to record from [[Broadcasting#Recorded and live forms|live to tape]] after Richburg left the studio.<ref name=\"Keyboard\">{{cite magazine|last=Rule|first=Greg|date=November 2000|title=Jimmy Jam: Inside Flyte Tyme studios|magazine=[[Keyboard (magazine)|Keyboard]]|volume=26|issue=11|pages=32-40|issn=07300158}}</ref> Initially conceived as a \"slow melody\", Jam chose to increase its [[tempo]].<ref name=\"Bronson\" />\n\nTwo different choruses were written by Jam and Jackson; Jam wrote \"Nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you\" while Jackson wrote \"Doesn't really matter\". They decided to use Jackson's chorus, and include Jam's chorus towards the end of the track. Jackson presented three songs to Segal on May 12, 2000, three days prior to his set deadline for the soundtrack.

It then pans from a panoramic nighttime city view to a scene of Jackson singing from her bed in a confined apartment. During this scene, the AIBO and various objects in her room are shown, including a television displaying ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'', and a pair of [[moon shoes]]. Jackson then grabs a beverage from her fridge and starts singing in front of a mirror containing visually animated animal stickers. Four of her friends knock at her door and Jackson leaves with them. They dance through the apartment block hallway as their shoes morph into black futuristic high-heels, walking into an area filled with display screens and a circular platform.\n\nDuring the song's breakdown, they perform a choreographed dance routine on the tilting platform. The scenes are intercut with Jackson drawing an orange swirl and the AIBO watching the film in her apartment. Various people are also seen drawing orange swirls. In the next segment, Jackson is shown in the passenger seat of a car driving through a tunnel, as scenes from ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' appear as a reflection in the front window. The video concludes with a [[slow motion]] shot of Jackson falling backwards onto her bed and the AIBO resting in front of her.\n\n===Reception===\nWriting for DVD Movie Guide, Colin Jacobson praised the music video for deviating from the standard \"lip-synch/film snippet formula\" used among pop videos at the time, stating that it \"stands on its own\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/klumpsuncensored.shtml|title=Nutty Professor II: The Klumps \u2013 Uncensored Director's Cut (2000)|website=DVD Movie Guide|last=Jacobson|first=Colin|year=2000|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}</ref> Rod Stafford Hagwood of the ''Sun-Sentinel'' included \"Doesn't Really Matter\" among several videos which set fashion trends and increased the popularity of \"bright colorful clothes\" among youth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-08-08/lifestyle/0008070457_1_colors-young-women-video|title=What Are The Coolest Kids Wearing This Fall?

Even though,the ''Declaration'' did not immediately accomplish its goals, it did set a precedent for a manner in which feminists could satirize their governments for their failures in equality, seen in documents such as ''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'' and ''A Declaration of Sentiments''.<ref>Carla Hesse, ''The Other Enlightenment: How French Women Became Modern''(2001), 42.</ref>\n\n=== Wollstonecraft and ''A Vindication'' ===\n{{Main|A Vindication of the Rights of Woman|Mary Wollstonecraft}}\n[[File:Wollstonecraft-right-of-woman.jpg|thumb|right|First edition print of ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'']]\nPerhaps the most cited feminist writer of the time was [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], often characterized as the first feminist philosopher. ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) is one of the first works that can unambiguously be called feminist, although by modern standards her comparison of women to the nobility, the elite of society (coddled, fragile, and in danger of intellectual and moral sloth) may at first seem dated as a feminist argument. Wollstonecraft identified the education and upbringing of women as creating their limited expectations based on a self-image dictated by the typically male perspective.<ref>Alexander, Meena. Women in Romanticism: Mary Wollstonecraft, Dorothy Wordsworth, and Mary Shelley. NY: Rowman and Littlefield (1989), 40</ref> Despite her perceived inconsistencies (Miriam Brody referred to the \"Two Wollstonecrafts\")<ref name=\"Brody\" /> reflective of problems that had no easy answers, this book remains a foundation stone of feminist thought.<ref name=\"Walters2005\"/>\n\nWollstonecraft believed that both genders contributed to inequality. She took women's considerable power over men for granted, and determined that both would require education to ensure the necessary changes in social attitudes. Given her humble origins and scant education, her personal achievements speak to her own determination. Wollstonecraft attracted the mockery of [[Samuel Johnson]], who described her and her ilk as \"Amazons of the pen\". Based on his relationship with [[Hester Thrale]],<ref>Prose, Francine. ''The Lives of the Muses''. New York: Harper Collins, 2002, pp. 29-56.</ref> he complained of women's encroachment onto a male territory of writing, and not their intelligence or education.

Female writers of the [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|utopian literature]] movement at the time of [[first-wave feminism]] often addressed sexism. [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]]'s ''[[Herland (novel)|Herland]]'' (1915) did so.{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=how?}} ''[[Sultana's Dream]]'' (1905) by [[Bengali science fiction|Bengali]] [[Islamic feminism|Muslim feminist]] [[Roquia Sakhawat Hussain]] depicts a gender-reversed [[purdah]] in a futuristic world.\n\nDuring the 1920s, writers such as [[Clare Winger Harris]] and [[Gertrude Barrows Bennett]] published science fiction stories written from female perspectives and occasionally dealt with gender- and sexuality-based topics while popular 1920s and 30s [[pulp science fiction]] exaggerated masculinity alongside sexist portrayals of women.<ref>Clute, John (1995).

''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction''. \"Martin's Griffin\", 424.</ref>\n\n[[Feminist science fiction]] poses questions about social issues such as how society constructs gender roles, how reproduction defines gender, and how the political power of men and women are unequal.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Some of the most notable feminist science fiction works have illustrated these themes using [[utopia]]s to explore societies where gender differences or gender power imbalances do not exist, and [[dystopia]]s to explore worlds where gender inequalities are escalated, asserting a need for feminist work to continue.<ref>Elyce Rae Helford, in Westfahl, Gary.

The war also left large numbers of women bereaved and with a net loss of household income. The scores of men killed and wounded shifted the demographic composition. War also split the feminist groups, with many women opposed to the war and others involved in the [[White feather|white feather campaign]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nFeminist scholars like [[Francoise Thebaud]] and [[Nancy F.

Labour swept to power in 1924. Astor's proposal to form a women's party in 1929 was unsuccessful. Women gained considerable electoral experience over the next few years as a series of minority governments ensured almost annual elections. Close affiliation with Labour also proved to be a problem for the [[National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship]] (NUSEC), which had little support in the Conservative party.

It also responds to the backlash against the second-wave's initiatives and movements.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Third-wave feminism seeks to challenge or avoid second-wave \"[[Essentialism|essentialist]]\" definitions of [[femininity]], which over-emphasized the experiences of white, upper-middle-class women. A [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] interpretation of gender and sexuality, or an understanding of gender as outside binary maleness and femaleness, is central to much of the third wave's ideology.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Third-wave feminists often describe \"micropolitics\",{{Clarify|date=May 2013}} and challenge second-wave paradigms about whether actions are unilaterally good for females.<ref name=Freedman/><ref name=Henry>Henry, Astrid, ''Not My Mother's Sister: Generational Conflict and Third-Wave Feminism'' (Indiana University Press, 2003), {{ISBN|978-0-253-21713-4}}</ref><ref name=Gillis>Gillis, Stacy, Gillian Howie & Rebecca Munford (eds), ''Third Wave Feminism: A Critical Exploration'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2007), {{ISBN|978-0-230-52174-2}}</ref><ref name=Faludi>Faludi, Susan, ''Backlash: The Undeclared War Against Women'' (Vintage, 1993), {{ISBN|978-0-09-922271-2}}</ref>{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=examples}}\n\nThese aspects of third-wave feminism arose in the mid-1980s. Feminist leaders rooted in the second wave like [[Gloria Anzald\u00faa]], [[bell hooks<!-- For this person's name, the initials should be in the lower case. -->]], [[Chela Sandoval]], [[Cherr\u00ede Moraga]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[Luisa Accati]], [[Maxine Hong Kingston]], and many other feminists of color, called for a new subjectivity in feminist voice. They wanted prominent feminist thought to consider race-related subjectivities.{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=examples}} This focus on the intersection between race and gender remained prominent through the 1991 [[Hill\u2013Thomas hearings]], but began to shift with the [[Freedom Ride 1992]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} a drive to register voters in poor minority communities whose rhetoric intended to rally young feminists. For many, the rallying of the young is the common link within third-wave feminism.<ref name=Freedman/><ref name=Henry/>\n\n==== Sexual politics ====\n[[Lesbianism]] during the second wave was visible within and without feminism. Lesbians felt sidelined by both gay liberation and women's liberation, where they were referred to as the \"[[Lavender Menace]]\", provoking ''[[The Woman-Identified Woman]]'', a 1970 manifesto that put lesbian women at the forefront of the liberation movement.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} [[Jill Johnston]]'s 1973 ''[[Lesbian Nation: The Feminist Solution]]'' argued for [[lesbian separatism]].{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=explain, connect to rest of paragraph}} In its extreme form, this was expressed as the only appropriate choice for a woman.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Eventually the lesbian movement was welcomed into the mainstream women's movement. This union's threat to male normativity was substantiated by the male backlash that followed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nIn [[reproductive rights]], feminists sought the right to contraception and birth control, which were almost universally restricted until the 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Feminists hoped to use the first [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]] to free women to decide the terms under which they will bear children. They felt that reproductive self-control was essential for full economic independence from men. Access to [[abortion]] was also widely demanded for these reasons, but was more difficult to secure due to existing, deep societal divisions over the issue. Although Shulamith Firestone was active during the second wave of feminism, her views on reproductive technology have connections to reproductive rights.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NT5F5DabEc0C&pg=PA4&dq=cyberfeminism#v=onepage&q=Shulamith%20Firestone&f=false|title=Cyberfeminism: Connectivity, Critique and Creativity|last=Hawthorne|first=Susan|last2=Klein|first2=Renate|date=1999|publisher=Spinifex Press|isbn=978-1-875559-68-8|language=en}}</ref> Firestone believed in the enhancement of technologically concerning reproduction, in order to eliminate the obligation for women to reproduce and end oppression and inequality against them. Enhancing technology to empower women and abolish the gender hierarchy are the main focuses of a newer developing philosophy in feminism, known as [[cyberfeminism]]. Cyberfeminism has strong ties to reproductive rights and technology.\n\nThird-wave feminists also fought to hasten social acceptance of female sexual freedom. As societal norms allowed men to have multiple sexual partners without rebuke, feminists sought sexual equality for that freedom and encouraged \"[[sexual liberation]]\" for women, including sex for pleasure with multiple partners, if desired.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} <!-- add critique here, previous section was completely unsourced from Feb 2007 to May 2013... -->\n\n==== Global feminism ====\nFollowing World War II, the [[United Nations]] (UN) extended feminism's global reach.

In 2014, Dodson worked with women to discover their sexual desires through masturbation. Dodson says her work has gained a fresh lease of life with a new audience of young, successful women who have never had an orgasm.

''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) is one of the first works that can unambiguously be called feminist, although by modern standards her comparison of women to the nobility, the elite of society (coddled, fragile, and in danger of intellectual and moral sloth) may at first seem dated as a feminist argument. Wollstonecraft identified the education and upbringing of women as creating their limited expectations based on a self-image dictated by the typically male perspective.<ref>Alexander, Meena.

NY: Rowman and Littlefield (1989), 40</ref> Despite her perceived inconsistencies (Miriam Brody referred to the \"Two Wollstonecrafts\")<ref name=\"Brody\" /> reflective of problems that had no easy answers, this book remains a foundation stone of feminist thought.<ref name=\"Walters2005\"/>\n\nWollstonecraft believed that both genders contributed to inequality. She took women's considerable power over men for granted, and determined that both would require education to ensure the necessary changes in social attitudes. Given her humble origins and scant education, her personal achievements speak to her own determination. Wollstonecraft attracted the mockery of [[Samuel Johnson]], who described her and her ilk as \"Amazons of the pen\". Based on his relationship with [[Hester Thrale]],<ref>Prose, Francine. ''The Lives of the Muses''. New York: Harper Collins, 2002, pp. 29-56.</ref> he complained of women's encroachment onto a male territory of writing, and not their intelligence or education.

Female writers of the [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|utopian literature]] movement at the time of [[first-wave feminism]] often addressed sexism. [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]]'s ''[[Herland (novel)|Herland]]'' (1915) did so.{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=how?}} ''[[Sultana's Dream]]'' (1905) by [[Bengali science fiction|Bengali]] [[Islamic feminism|Muslim feminist]] [[Roquia Sakhawat Hussain]] depicts a gender-reversed [[purdah]] in a futuristic world.\n\nDuring the 1920s, writers such as [[Clare Winger Harris]] and [[Gertrude Barrows Bennett]] published science fiction stories written from female perspectives and occasionally dealt with gender- and sexuality-based topics while popular 1920s and 30s [[pulp science fiction]] exaggerated masculinity alongside sexist portrayals of women.<ref>Clute, John (1995). ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction''. \"Martin's Griffin\", 1344.</ref> By the 1960s, science fiction combined [[sensationalism]] with political and technological critiques of society.

''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction''. \"Martin's Griffin\", 424.</ref>\n\n[[Feminist science fiction]] poses questions about social issues such as how society constructs gender roles, how reproduction defines gender, and how the political power of men and women are unequal.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Some of the most notable feminist science fiction works have illustrated these themes using [[utopia]]s to explore societies where gender differences or gender power imbalances do not exist, and [[dystopia]]s to explore worlds where gender inequalities are escalated, asserting a need for feminist work to continue.<ref>Elyce Rae Helford, in Westfahl, Gary.

The war also left large numbers of women bereaved and with a net loss of household income. The scores of men killed and wounded shifted the demographic composition. War also split the feminist groups, with many women opposed to the war and others involved in the [[White feather|white feather campaign]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nFeminist scholars like [[Francoise Thebaud]] and [[Nancy F.

Labour swept to power in 1924. Astor's proposal to form a women's party in 1929 was unsuccessful. Women gained considerable electoral experience over the next few years as a series of minority governments ensured almost annual elections. Close affiliation with Labour also proved to be a problem for the [[National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship]] (NUSEC), which had little support in the Conservative party.

While  ''l'Union des femmes de la Martinique,'' founded by Jeanne Lero was influenced by beliefs, ''Le Rassemblement f\u00e9minin,'' founded by [[Paulette Nardal]], claimed to not support any particular political party and only encouraged women to take political action in order to create social change.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Palmiste|first=Clara|date=2014-06-05|title=Le vote f\u00e9minin et la transformation des colonies fran\u00e7aises d'Am\u00e9rique en d\u00e9partements en 1946|url=http://journals.openedition.org/nuevomundo/66842|journal=Nuevo Mundo Mundos Nuevos|language=fr|doi=10.4000/nuevomundo.66842|issn=1626-0252|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==== Social reform ====\nThe political change did not immediately change social circumstances.

It also responds to the backlash against the second-wave's initiatives and movements.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Third-wave feminism seeks to challenge or avoid second-wave \"[[Essentialism|essentialist]]\" definitions of [[femininity]], which over-emphasized the experiences of white, upper-middle-class women. A [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] interpretation of gender and sexuality, or an understanding of gender as outside binary maleness and femaleness, is central to much of the third wave's ideology.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Third-wave feminists often describe \"micropolitics\",{{Clarify|date=May 2013}} and challenge second-wave paradigms about whether actions are unilaterally good for females.<ref name=Freedman/><ref name=Henry>Henry, Astrid, ''Not My Mother's Sister: Generational Conflict and Third-Wave Feminism'' (Indiana University Press, 2003), {{ISBN|978-0-253-21713-4}}</ref><ref name=Gillis>Gillis, Stacy, Gillian Howie & Rebecca Munford (eds), ''Third Wave Feminism: A Critical Exploration'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2007), {{ISBN|978-0-230-52174-2}}</ref><ref name=Faludi>Faludi, Susan, ''Backlash: The Undeclared War Against Women'' (Vintage, 1993), {{ISBN|978-0-09-922271-2}}</ref>{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=examples}}\n\nThese aspects of third-wave feminism arose in the mid-1980s. Feminist leaders rooted in the second wave like [[Gloria Anzald\u00faa]], [[bell hooks<!-- For this person's name, the initials should be in the lower case. -->]], [[Chela Sandoval]], [[Cherr\u00ede Moraga]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[Luisa Accati]], [[Maxine Hong Kingston]], and many other feminists of color, called for a new subjectivity in feminist voice. They wanted prominent feminist thought to consider race-related subjectivities.{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=examples}} This focus on the intersection between race and gender remained prominent through the 1991 [[Hill\u2013Thomas hearings]], but began to shift with the [[Freedom Ride 1992]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} a drive to register voters in poor minority communities whose rhetoric intended to rally young feminists. For many, the rallying of the young is the common link within third-wave feminism.<ref name=Freedman/><ref name=Henry/>\n\n==== Sexual politics ====\n[[Lesbianism]] during the second wave was visible within and without feminism. Lesbians felt sidelined by both gay liberation and women's liberation, where they were referred to as the \"[[Lavender Menace]]\", provoking ''[[The Woman-Identified Woman]]'', a 1970 manifesto that put lesbian women at the forefront of the liberation movement.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} [[Jill Johnston]]'s 1973 ''[[Lesbian Nation: The Feminist Solution]]'' argued for [[lesbian separatism]].{{Clarify|date=May 2013|reason=explain, connect to rest of paragraph}} In its extreme form, this was expressed as the only appropriate choice for a woman.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Eventually the lesbian movement was welcomed into the mainstream women's movement. This union's threat to male normativity was substantiated by the male backlash that followed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nIn [[reproductive rights]], feminists sought the right to contraception and birth control, which were almost universally restricted until the 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Feminists hoped to use the first [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]] to free women to decide the terms under which they will bear children. They felt that reproductive self-control was essential for full economic independence from men. Access to [[abortion]] was also widely demanded for these reasons, but was more difficult to secure due to existing, deep societal divisions over the issue. Although Shulamith Firestone was active during the second wave of feminism, her views on reproductive technology have connections to reproductive rights.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NT5F5DabEc0C&pg=PA4&dq=cyberfeminism#v=onepage&q=Shulamith%20Firestone&f=false|title=Cyberfeminism: Connectivity, Critique and Creativity|last=Hawthorne|first=Susan|last2=Klein|first2=Renate|date=1999|publisher=Spinifex Press|isbn=978-1-875559-68-8|language=en}}</ref> Firestone believed in the enhancement of technologically concerning reproduction, in order to eliminate the obligation for women to reproduce and end oppression and inequality against them. Enhancing technology to empower women and abolish the gender hierarchy are the main focuses of a newer developing philosophy in feminism, known as [[cyberfeminism]]. Cyberfeminism has strong ties to reproductive rights and technology.\n\nThird-wave feminists also fought to hasten social acceptance of female sexual freedom. As societal norms allowed men to have multiple sexual partners without rebuke, feminists sought sexual equality for that freedom and encouraged \"[[sexual liberation]]\" for women, including sex for pleasure with multiple partners, if desired.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} <!-- add critique here, previous section was completely unsourced from Feb 2007 to May 2013... -->\n\n==== Global feminism ====\nFollowing World War II, the [[United Nations]] (UN) extended feminism's global reach.

Dodson expressed that the previous waves of feminist were banal and anti-sexual, which is why she has chosen to look at a new stance of feminism, fourth wave feminism. In 2014, Dodson worked with women to discover their sexual desires through masturbation. Dodson says her work has gained a fresh lease of life with a new audience of young, successful women who have never had an orgasm.

There are also interactive timelines linking to a vast array of sources documenting the history of American feminism and providing information about current feminist activism.\n\n===Criticisms of the Wave Metaphor ===\nThe wave metaphor has been critiqued as inappropriate, limiting, and misleading by a number of feminist scholars.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Feminist Theory Reader: Local and Global Perspectives|last=Nicholson|first=Linda|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=McCann|editor-first=Carole R.|edition=3rd|location=New York|pages=|chapter=Feminism in \"Waves\": Useful Metaphor or Not?|editor-last2=Kim|editor-first2=Seung-Kyung|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Feminist Theory Reader: Local and Global Perspectives|last=Basu|first=Amrita|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=McCann|editor-first=Carole R.|edition=3rd|location=New York|pages=|chapter=Globalization of the Local/Localization of the Global: Mapping Transnational Women's Movements|editor-last2=Kim|editor-first2=Seung-Kyung|via=}}</ref>\n\nWhile this metaphor was once useful for United States feminists in order to gain the attention required to make large-scale political changes, as was the case for the women's suffrage movement of the 1940s, its relevance may have not only run its course but its usage has been argued as completely inappropriate.<ref name=\":0\" />  For example, the suffragettes did not use the term \u2018feminism\u2019 to describe themselves or their movement.<ref name=\":0\" />  This critique is shown through one early twentieth century feminist's words: \"All feminists are suffragists, but not all suffragists are feminists\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Grounding of Modern Feminism|last=Cott|first=Nancy|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1987|isbn=|location=New Haven and London|pages=15|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe wave metaphor has been described as misleading and even dangerous because it not only renders the periods of time in-between waves as silent and irrelevant, but it also contributes to the faulty conceptualization of a particular brand hegemonic feminism as the ultimate understanding of what feminism is.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />  These critiques advocate for the recognition of periods of mass social organizing rather than \u2018waves\u2019.<ref name=\":0\" />  It is argued that the wave metaphor weakens the strength and relevance of feminist arguments, since waves necessarily must peak and then retreat, which is not an accurate picture of feminist progress in the United States or elsewhere.<ref name=\":0\" />  Feminism does not retreat or disappear in-between \u2018waves'.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />  For example, after the explosion of mass social organizing in the 1960s, 70s and 80s, feminism was being worked into our institutions \u2013 a much less glamorous but just as important job that did not require such large-scale attention.<ref name=\":0\" />  As a result, we have seen more and more women in more areas of the job force, higher education, and the installation and success of Women\u2019s and Gender Studies programs across the United States, to name just a few examples of feminism\u2019s continuous and very relevant presence in this time between the \u2018waves\u2019.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe wave metaphor has further been criticized for privileging not only particular races and classes of women in the United States, but for privileging the feminism of the United States in general over other locations in the world.<ref name=\":1\" />  Amrita Basu argues for, \"the politics and conditions of emergence,\" instead of the wave metaphor, which does not allow for this privileging of particular people and nations but instead allows for the importance and understanding of any and all peoples in the world who have contributed to feminism and its many understandings and meanings.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== National histories of feminism ==\n\n=== France ===\n{{Main|Feminism in France}}\nThe 18th century [[French Revolution]]'s focus on [[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9|''\u00e9galit\u00e9'']] (equality) extended to the inequities faced by French women.

Niboyet was a Protestant who had adopted [[Saint-Simonianism]], and ''La Voix'' attracted other women from that movement, including the seamstress [[Jeanne Deroin]] and the primary schoolteacher [[Pauline Roland]]. Unsuccessful attempts were also made to recruit [[George Sand]].

Herrnstein]] and political scientist [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]], in which the authors argue that [[human intelligence]] is substantially influenced by both inherited and environmental factors and that it is a better predictor of many personal outcomes, including financial income, job performance, birth out of [[marriage|wedlock]], and involvement in crime than are an individual's parental [[socioeconomic status]]. They also argue that those with high intelligence, the \"cognitive elite\", are becoming separated from those of average and below-average intelligence. The book was controversial, especially where the authors wrote about [[Race and intelligence|racial differences in intelligence]] and discussed the implications of those differences.\n\nShortly after its publication, many people rallied both in criticism and defense of the book. A number of critical texts were written in response to it.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{One source|section|date=December 2019}} \n\n''The Bell Curve'', published in 1994, was written by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray to explain the variations in intelligence in American society, warn of some consequences of that variation, and propose social policies for mitigating the worst of the consequences. The book's title comes from the bell-shaped [[normal distribution]] of [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) scores in a population.\n\n===Introduction===\n\nThe book starts with an introduction that appraises the history of the concept of intelligence from [[Francis Galton]] to modern times. Spearman's introduction of the [[g factor (psychometrics)|general factor of intelligence]] and other early advances in research on intelligence are discussed along with a consideration of links between intelligence testing and racial politics. The 1960s are identified as the period in American history when social problems were increasingly attributed to forces outside the individual. This egalitarian ethos, Herrnstein and Murray argue, cannot accommodate biologically based individual differences.<ref name=\"devlin\">{{cite book| title= Intelligence, Genes, and Success: Scientists Respond to The Bell Curve| url= https://archive.org/details/intelligencegene00bern| url-access= registration| first1= Bernie| last1= Devlin | first2= Stephen E. | last2= Fienberg| first3=  Daniel P. | last3= Resnick| first4= Kathryn | last4= Roeder|author4-link= Kathryn Roeder |  publisher= Springer Science & Business Media| year= 1997 | isbn= 978-0387949864}}</ref>\n\nThe introduction states six of the authors' assumptions, which they claim to be \"beyond significant technical dispute\":<ref name=\"HerrnsteinMurray2010\">{{cite book|first1= Richard J. |last1= Herrnstein| first2= Charles |last2= Murray| title= Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s4CKqxi6yWIC|date=11 May 2010 |publisher=Simon and Schuster| isbn= 978-1-4391-3491-7| pages= 22\u201323}}</ref>\n# There is such a difference as a general factor of cognitive ability on which human beings differ.\n# All standardized tests of academic aptitude or achievement measure this general factor to some degree, but IQ tests expressly designed for that purpose measure it most accurately.\n# IQ scores match, to a first degree, whatever it is that people mean when they use the word intelligent, or smart in ordinary language.\n# IQ scores are stable, although not perfectly so, over much of a person's life.\n# Properly administered IQ tests are not demonstrably biased against social, economic, ethnic, or racial groups.\n# Cognitive ability is substantially [[Heritability|heritable]], apparently no less than 40 percent and no more than 80 percent.\nAt the close of the introduction, the authors warn the reader against committing the [[ecological fallacy]] of inferring things about individuals based on the aggregate data presented in the book. They also assert that intelligence is just one of many valuable human attributes and one whose importance among human virtues is overrated.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\n===Part I. The Emergence of a Cognitive Elite===\n\nIn the first part of the book Herrnstein and Murray chart how American society was transformed in the 20th century. They argue that America evolved from a society where social origin largely determined one's social status to one where cognitive ability is the leading determinant of status. The growth in college attendance, a more efficient recruitment of cognitive ability, and the sorting of cognitive ability by selective colleges are identified as important drivers of this evolution. Increased occupational sorting by cognitive ability is discussed. The argument is made, based on published meta-analyses, that cognitive ability is the best predictor of worker productivity.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nHerrnstein and Murray argue that due to increasing returns to cognitive ability, a cognitive elite is being formed in America. This elite is getting richer and progressively more segregated from the rest of society.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\n===Part II. Cognitive Classes and Social Behavior===\n\nThe second part describes how cognitive ability is related to social behaviors: high ability predicts socially desirable behavior, low ability undesirable behavior. The argument is made that group differences in social outcomes are better explained by intelligence differences rather than socioeconomic status, a perspective, the authors argue, that has been neglected in research.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nThe analyses reported in this part of the book were done using data from the [[National Longitudinal Surveys|National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experience of Youth]] (NLSY), a study conducted by the [[United States Department of Labor]]'s [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] tracking thousands of Americans starting in the 1980s. Only [[non-Hispanic white]]s are included in the analyses so as to demonstrate that the relationships between cognitive ability and social behavior are not driven by race or ethnicity.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nHerrnstein and Murray argue that intelligence is a better predictor of individuals' outcomes than parental socioeconomic status. This argument is based on analyses where individuals' IQ scores are shown to better predict their outcomes as adults than the socioeconomic status of their parents. Such results are reported for many outcomes, including poverty, dropping out of school, unemployment, marriage, divorce, illegitimacy, welfare dependency, criminal offending, and the probability of voting in elections.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nAll participants in the NLSY took the [[Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery]] (ASVAB), a battery of ten tests taken by all who apply for entry into the armed services. (Some had taken an IQ test in high school, and the median correlation of the [[Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery#Armed Forces Qualification Test|Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT)]] scores and those IQ test scores was .81). Participants were later evaluated for social and economic outcomes. In general, IQ/AFQT scores were a better predictor of life outcomes than [[social class]] background. Similarly, after statistically controlling for differences in IQ, many outcome differences between racial-ethnic groups disappeared.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Economic and social correlates of IQ\n!

The National Context===\n\nThis part of the book discusses ethnic differences in cognitive ability and social behavior. Herrnstein and Murray report that Asian Americans have a higher mean IQ than white Americans, who in turn outscore black Americans. The book argues that the black-white gap is not due to test bias, noting that IQ tests do not tend to underpredict the school or job performance of black individuals and that the gap is larger on apparently culturally neutral test items than on more culturally loaded items. The authors also note that adjusting for socioeconomic status does not eliminate the black-white IQ gap. However, they argue that the gap is narrowing.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nAccording to Herrnstein and Murray, the high [[heritability of IQ]] within races does not necessarily mean that the cause of differences between races is genetic. On the other hand, they discuss lines of evidence that have been used to support the thesis that the black-white gap is at least partly genetic, such as [[Spearman's hypothesis]]. They also discuss possible environmental explanations of the gap, such as the observed generational increases in IQ, for which they coin the term [[Flynn effect]]. At the close of this discussion, they write:<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\n{{quote|\"If the reader is now convinced that either the genetic or environmental explanation has won out to the exclusion of the other, we have not done a sufficiently good job of presenting one side or the other. It seems highly likely to us that both genes and environment have something to do with racial differences. What might the mix be? We are resolutely agnostic on that issue; as far as we can determine, the evidence does not yet justify an estimate.\"}}\n\nThe authors also stress that regardless of the causes of differences, people should be treated no differently.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nIn Part III, the authors also repeat many of the analyses from Part II, but now compare whites to blacks and Hispanics in the NLSY dataset. They find that after controlling for IQ, many differences in social outcomes between races are diminished.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nThe authors discuss the possibility that high birth rates among those with lower IQs may exert a downward pressure on the national distribution of cognitive ability. They argue that immigration may also have a similar effect.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nAt the close of Part III, Herrnstein and Murray discuss the relation of IQ to social problems. Using the NLSY data, they show that social problems increase as a monotonic function of lower IQ.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\n===Living Together===\n\nIn this final chapter, the authors discuss the relevance of cognitive ability for understanding major social issues in America.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nEvidence for experimental attempts to raise intelligence is reviewed. The authors conclude that currently there are no means to boost intelligence by more than a modest degree.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nThe authors criticize the \"levelling\" of general and secondary education and defend [[gifted education]]. They offer a critical overview of [[affirmative action]] policies in colleges and workplaces, arguing that their goal should be equality of opportunity rather than equal outcomes.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nHerrnstein and Murray offer a pessimistic portrait of America's future. They predict that a cognitive elite will further isolate itself from the rest of society, while the quality of life deteriorates for those at the bottom of the cognitive scale. As an antidote to this prognosis, they offer a vision of society where differences in ability are recognized and everybody can have a valued place, stressing the role of local communities and clear moral rules that apply to everybody.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\n==Policy recommendations==\n{{Primary sources|section|date=December 2019}}\nHerrnstein and Murray argued the average genetic IQ of the United States is declining, owing to the tendency of the more intelligent having fewer children than the less intelligent, the generation length to be shorter for the less intelligent, and the large-scale immigration to the United States of those with low intelligence. Discussing a possible future political outcome of an intellectually stratified society, the authors stated that they \"fear that a new kind of conservatism is becoming the dominant ideology of the affluent\u2014not in the social tradition of an Edmund Burke or in the economic tradition of an Adam Smith but 'conservatism' along Latin American lines, where to be conservative has often meant doing whatever is necessary to preserve the mansions on the hills from the menace of the slums below.\"<ref>p.&nbsp;518.</ref> Moreover, they fear that increasing welfare will create a \"custodial state\" in \"a high-tech and more lavish version of the Indian reservation for some substantial minority of the nation's population.\" They also predict increasing [[totalitarianism]]: \"It is difficult to imagine the United States preserving its heritage of individualism, equal rights before the law, free people running their own lives, once it is accepted that a significant part of the population must be made permanent wards of the states.\"<ref>p.&nbsp;526.</ref>\n\nThe authors recommended the elimination of welfare policies that encourage poor women to have babies:\n\n{{quote|We can imagine no recommendation for using the government to manipulate fertility that does not have dangers. But this highlights the problem: The United States already has policies that inadvertently social-engineer who has babies, and it is encouraging the wrong women. \"If the United States did as much to encourage high-IQ women to have babies as it now does to encourage low-IQ women, it would rightly be described as engaging in aggressive manipulation of fertility.\" The technically precise description of America's fertility policy is that it subsidizes births among poor women, who are also disproportionately at the low end of the intelligence distribution. We urge generally that these policies, represented by the extensive network of cash and services for low-income women who have babies, be ended. The government should stop subsidizing births to anyone rich or poor. The other generic recommendation, as close to harmless as any government program we can imagine, is to make it easy for women to make good on their prior decision not to get pregnant by making available birth control mechanisms that are increasingly flexible, foolproof, inexpensive, and safe.<ref>pp. 548\u2013549.</ref>}}\n\n==Media reception==\n''The Bell Curve'' received a great deal of media attention.

Lucas, [[Ann Swidler]], and Kim Voss in the book ''[[Inequality by Design]]'' recalculated the effect of socioeconomic status, using the same variables as ''The Bell Curve'', but weighting them differently. They found that if IQ scores are adjusted, as Herrnstein and Murray did, to eliminate the effect of [[education]], the ability of IQ to predict [[poverty]] can become dramatically larger, by as much as 61 percent for whites and 74 percent for blacks. According to the authors, Herrnstein and Murray's finding that IQ predicts poverty much better than socioeconomic status is substantially a result of the way they handled the statistics.<ref>''[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/5877.html Inequality by Design: Cracking the Bell Curve Myth]'' Claude S.

Korenman and Winship concluded: \"...{{nbsp}}there is evidence of substantial bias due to measurement error in their estimates of the effects of parents' socioeconomic status. In addition, Herrnstein and Murray's measure of parental socioeconomic status (SES) fails to capture the effects of important elements of family background (such as single-parent family structure at age 14). As a result, their analysis gives an exaggerated impression of the importance of IQ relative to parents' SES, and relative to family background more generally. Estimates based on a variety of methods, including analyses of siblings, suggest that parental family background is at least as important, and may be more important than IQ in determining socioeconomic success in adulthood.\"<ref>http://ssrn.com/abstract=225294 Korenman, Sanders and Winship, Christopher, \"A Reanalysis of The Bell Curve\" (August 1995).

This work argues that much of the public response was polemic, and failed to analyze the details of the science and validity of the statistical arguments underlying the book's conclusions.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\n=== Criticism of use of AFQT ===\nWilliam J. Matthews writes that part of ''The Bell Curve'''s analysis is based on the AFQT \"which is not an IQ test but designed to predict performance of certain criterion variables\".<ref name=\"badscience\">William J. Matthews, Ph.D. (1998) ''[http://goinside.com/1998/03/23/a-review-of-the-bell-curve-bad-science-makes-for-bad-conclusions/ A Review of the Bell Curve: Bad Science Makes for Bad Conclusions]''</ref> The AFQT covers subjects such as trigonometry.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHeckman observed that the AFQT was designed only to predict success in military training schools and that most of these tests appear to be achievement tests rather than ability tests, measuring factual knowledge and not pure ability. He continues:\n\n{{quote|Ironically, the authors delete from their composite AFQT score a timed test of numerical operations because it is not highly correlated with the other tests. Yet it is well known that in the data they use, this subtest is the single best predictor of earnings of all the AFQT test components. The fact that many of the subtests are only weakly correlated with each other, and that the best predictor of earnings is only weakly correlated with their \"g-loaded\" score, only heightens doubts that a single-ability model is a satisfactory description of human intelligence. It also drives home the point that the \"g-loading\" so strongly emphasized by Murray and Herrnstein measures only agreement among tests\u2014not predictive power for socioeconomic outcomes. By the same token, one could also argue that the authors have biased their empirical analysis against the conclusions they obtain by disregarding the test with the greatest predictive power.<ref name=heckman/><ref name=\"reason\">''[http://www.reason.com/news/show/29636.html Cracked Bell]'' James J.

Using the same data, we demonstrate their finding is very fragile.<ref>''The Intergenerational Transmission of 'Intelligence' Down the Slippery Slopes of 'The Bell Curve' '' Industrial Relations: A Journal of Economy and Society, Vol. 38, No. 3, July 1999</ref>}}\n\n=== Cognitive sorting ===\nCharles R. Tittle and Thomas Rotolo found that the more the written, IQ-like, examinations are used as screening devices for occupational access, the stronger the relationship between IQ and income. Thus, rather than higher IQ leading to status attainment because it indicates skills needed in a modern society, IQ may reflect the same test-taking abilities used in artificial screening devices by which status groups protect their domains.<ref>\"IQ and Stratification: An Empirical Evaluation of Herrnstein and Murray's Social Change Argument\".

Hauser]] write that Herrnstein and Murray provide scant evidence of growth in cognitive sorting. Using data from the General Social Survey, they tested each of these hypotheses using a short verbal ability test which was administered to about 12,500 American adults between 1974 and 1994; the results provided no support for any of the trend hypotheses advanced by Herrnstein and Murray. One chart in ''The Bell Curve'' purports to show that people with IQs above 120 have become \"rapidly more concentrated\" in high-IQ occupations since 1940. But Robert Hauser and his colleague Min-Hsiung Huang retested the data and came up with estimates that fell \"well below those of Herrnstein and Murray.\" They add that the data, properly used, \"do not tell us anything except that selected, highly educated occupation groups have grown rapidly since 1940.\"<ref>''[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ap/so/1997/00000026/00000003/art00604 Verbal Ability and Socioeconomic Success: A Trend Analysis]'' Hauser R.M.; Huang M.H.</ref>\n\nIn 1972, [[Noam Chomsky]] questioned Herrnstein's idea that society was developing towards a [[meritocracy]]. Chomsky criticized the assumptions that people only seek occupations based on material gain. He argued that Herrnstein would not want to become a baker or lumberjack even if he could earn more money that way. He also criticized the assumption that such a society would be fair with pay based on value of contributions. He argued that because there are already unjust great inequalities, people will often be paid, not for valuable contributions to society, but to preserve such inequalities.<ref name=Chomsky>Chomsky, Noam. 1972. \"[http://newlearningonline.com/new-learning/chapter-6-the-nature-of-learning/chomsky-on-iq-and-inequality/ Chomsky on IQ and inequality I.Q.

The authors were reported throughout the popular press as arguing that these IQ differences are strictly genetic, when in fact they attributed IQ differences to both genes and the environment in chapter 13: \"It seems highly likely to us that both genes and the environment have something to do with racial differences.\" The introduction to the chapter more cautiously states, \"The debate about whether and how much genes and environment have to do with ethnic differences remains unresolved.\"\n\nWhen several prominent critics turned this into an \"assumption\" that the authors had attributed most or all of the racial differences in IQ to genes, co-author Charles Murray responded by quoting two passages from the book:\n* If the reader is now convinced that either the genetic or environmental explanation has won out to the exclusion of the other, we have not done a sufficiently good job of presenting one side or the other. It seems highly likely to us that both genes and the environment have something to do with racial differences. What might the mix be? We are resolutely agnostic on that issue; as far as we can determine, the evidence does not justify an estimate.

So did white mountaineer children in the United States tested back in the early 1930s ... Strangely, Herrnstein and Murray refer to \"folklore\" that \"Jews and other immigrant groups were thought to be below average in intelligence.\" It was neither folklore nor anything as subjective as thoughts. It was based on hard data, as hard as any data in ''The Bell Curve''. These groups repeatedly tested below average on the mental tests of the World War I era, both in the army and in civilian life. For Jews, it is clear that later tests showed radically different results\u2014during an era when there was very little intermarriage to change the genetic makeup of American Jews.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://search.opinionarchives.com/Summary/AmericanSpectator/V28I2P32-1.htm|title=Ethnicity and IQ|first=Thomas|last=Sowell|year=1995|volume=28|issue=2|journal=[[The American Spectator]]}}</ref>}}\n\n[[J.

Herrnstein]] and political scientist [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]], in which the authors argue that [[human intelligence]] is substantially influenced by both inherited and environmental factors and that it is a better predictor of many personal outcomes, including financial income, job performance, birth out of [[marriage|wedlock]], and involvement in crime than are an individual's parental [[socioeconomic status]]. They also argue that those with high intelligence, the \"cognitive elite\", are becoming separated from those of average and below-average intelligence. The book was controversial, especially where the authors wrote about [[Race and intelligence|racial differences in intelligence]] and discussed the implications of those differences.\n\nShortly after its publication, many people rallied both in criticism and defense of the book. A number of critical texts were written in response to it.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{One source|section|date=December 2019}} \n\n''The Bell Curve'', published in 1994, was written by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray to explain the variations in intelligence in American society, warn of some consequences of that variation, and propose social policies for mitigating the worst of the consequences. The book's title comes from the bell-shaped [[normal distribution]] of [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) scores in a population.\n\n===Introduction===\n\nThe book starts with an introduction that appraises the history of the concept of intelligence from [[Francis Galton]] to modern times. Spearman's introduction of the [[g factor (psychometrics)|general factor of intelligence]] and other early advances in research on intelligence are discussed along with a consideration of links between intelligence testing and racial politics. The 1960s are identified as the period in American history when social problems were increasingly attributed to forces outside the individual. This egalitarian ethos, Herrnstein and Murray argue, cannot accommodate biologically based individual differences.<ref name=\"devlin\">{{cite book| title= Intelligence, Genes, and Success: Scientists Respond to The Bell Curve| url= https://archive.org/details/intelligencegene00bern| url-access= registration| first1= Bernie| last1= Devlin | first2= Stephen E. | last2= Fienberg| first3=  Daniel P. | last3= Resnick| first4= Kathryn | last4= Roeder|author4-link= Kathryn Roeder |  publisher= Springer Science & Business Media| year= 1997 | isbn= 978-0387949864}}</ref>\n\nThe introduction states six of the authors' assumptions, which they claim to be \"beyond significant technical dispute\":<ref name=\"HerrnsteinMurray2010\">{{cite book|first1= Richard J. |last1= Herrnstein| first2= Charles |last2= Murray| title= Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s4CKqxi6yWIC|date=11 May 2010 |publisher=Simon and Schuster| isbn= 978-1-4391-3491-7| pages= 22\u201323}}</ref>\n# There is such a difference as a general factor of cognitive ability on which human beings differ.\n# All standardized tests of academic aptitude or achievement measure this general factor to some degree, but IQ tests expressly designed for that purpose measure it most accurately.\n# IQ scores match, to a first degree, whatever it is that people mean when they use the word intelligent, or smart in ordinary language.\n# IQ scores are stable, although not perfectly so, over much of a person's life.\n# Properly administered IQ tests are not demonstrably biased against social, economic, ethnic, or racial groups.\n# Cognitive ability is substantially [[Heritability|heritable]], apparently no less than 40 percent and no more than 80 percent.\nAt the close of the introduction, the authors warn the reader against committing the [[ecological fallacy]] of inferring things about individuals based on the aggregate data presented in the book. They also assert that intelligence is just one of many valuable human attributes and one whose importance among human virtues is overrated.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\n===Part I. The Emergence of a Cognitive Elite===\n\nIn the first part of the book Herrnstein and Murray chart how American society was transformed in the 20th century. They argue that America evolved from a society where social origin largely determined one's social status to one where cognitive ability is the leading determinant of status. The growth in college attendance, a more efficient recruitment of cognitive ability, and the sorting of cognitive ability by selective colleges are identified as important drivers of this evolution. Increased occupational sorting by cognitive ability is discussed. The argument is made, based on published meta-analyses, that cognitive ability is the best predictor of worker productivity.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nHerrnstein and Murray argue that due to increasing returns to cognitive ability, a cognitive elite is being formed in America. This elite is getting richer and progressively more segregated from the rest of society.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\n===Part II. Cognitive Classes and Social Behavior===\n\nThe second part describes how cognitive ability is related to social behaviors: high ability predicts socially desirable behavior, low ability undesirable behavior. The argument is made that group differences in social outcomes are better explained by intelligence differences rather than socioeconomic status, a perspective, the authors argue, that has been neglected in research.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nThe analyses reported in this part of the book were done using data from the [[National Longitudinal Surveys|National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experience of Youth]] (NLSY), a study conducted by the [[United States Department of Labor]]'s [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] tracking thousands of Americans starting in the 1980s. Only [[non-Hispanic white]]s are included in the analyses so as to demonstrate that the relationships between cognitive ability and social behavior are not driven by race or ethnicity.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nHerrnstein and Murray argue that intelligence is a better predictor of individuals' outcomes than parental socioeconomic status. This argument is based on analyses where individuals' IQ scores are shown to better predict their outcomes as adults than the socioeconomic status of their parents. Such results are reported for many outcomes, including poverty, dropping out of school, unemployment, marriage, divorce, illegitimacy, welfare dependency, criminal offending, and the probability of voting in elections.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nAll participants in the NLSY took the [[Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery]] (ASVAB), a battery of ten tests taken by all who apply for entry into the armed services. (Some had taken an IQ test in high school, and the median correlation of the [[Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery#Armed Forces Qualification Test|Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT)]] scores and those IQ test scores was .81). Participants were later evaluated for social and economic outcomes. In general, IQ/AFQT scores were a better predictor of life outcomes than [[social class]] background. Similarly, after statistically controlling for differences in IQ, many outcome differences between racial-ethnic groups disappeared.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Economic and social correlates of IQ\n!

The National Context===\n\nThis part of the book discusses ethnic differences in cognitive ability and social behavior. Herrnstein and Murray report that Asian Americans have a higher mean IQ than white Americans, who in turn outscore black Americans. The book argues that the black-white gap is not due to test bias, noting that IQ tests do not tend to underpredict the school or job performance of black individuals and that the gap is larger on apparently culturally neutral test items than on more culturally loaded items. The authors also note that adjusting for socioeconomic status does not eliminate the black-white IQ gap. However, they argue that the gap is narrowing.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nAccording to Herrnstein and Murray, the high [[heritability of IQ]] within races does not necessarily mean that the cause of differences between races is genetic. On the other hand, they discuss lines of evidence that have been used to support the thesis that the black-white gap is at least partly genetic, such as [[Spearman's hypothesis]]. They also discuss possible environmental explanations of the gap, such as the observed generational increases in IQ, for which they coin the term [[Flynn effect]]. At the close of this discussion, they write:<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\n{{quote|\"If the reader is now convinced that either the genetic or environmental explanation has won out to the exclusion of the other, we have not done a sufficiently good job of presenting one side or the other. It seems highly likely to us that both genes and environment have something to do with racial differences. What might the mix be? We are resolutely agnostic on that issue; as far as we can determine, the evidence does not yet justify an estimate.\"}}\n\nThe authors also stress that regardless of the causes of differences, people should be treated no differently.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nIn Part III, the authors also repeat many of the analyses from Part II, but now compare whites to blacks and Hispanics in the NLSY dataset. They find that after controlling for IQ, many differences in social outcomes between races are diminished.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nThe authors discuss the possibility that high birth rates among those with lower IQs may exert a downward pressure on the national distribution of cognitive ability. They argue that immigration may also have a similar effect.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nAt the close of Part III, Herrnstein and Murray discuss the relation of IQ to social problems. Using the NLSY data, they show that social problems increase as a monotonic function of lower IQ.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\n===Living Together===\n\nIn this final chapter, the authors discuss the relevance of cognitive ability for understanding major social issues in America.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nEvidence for experimental attempts to raise intelligence is reviewed. The authors conclude that currently there are no means to boost intelligence by more than a modest degree.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nThe authors criticize the \"levelling\" of general and secondary education and defend [[gifted education]]. They offer a critical overview of [[affirmative action]] policies in colleges and workplaces, arguing that their goal should be equality of opportunity rather than equal outcomes.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\nHerrnstein and Murray offer a pessimistic portrait of America's future. They predict that a cognitive elite will further isolate itself from the rest of society, while the quality of life deteriorates for those at the bottom of the cognitive scale. As an antidote to this prognosis, they offer a vision of society where differences in ability are recognized and everybody can have a valued place, stressing the role of local communities and clear moral rules that apply to everybody.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\n==Policy recommendations==\n{{Primary sources|section|date=December 2019}}\nHerrnstein and Murray argued the average genetic IQ of the United States is declining, owing to the tendency of the more intelligent having fewer children than the less intelligent, the generation length to be shorter for the less intelligent, and the large-scale immigration to the United States of those with low intelligence. Discussing a possible future political outcome of an intellectually stratified society, the authors stated that they \"fear that a new kind of conservatism is becoming the dominant ideology of the affluent\u2014not in the social tradition of an Edmund Burke or in the economic tradition of an Adam Smith but 'conservatism' along Latin American lines, where to be conservative has often meant doing whatever is necessary to preserve the mansions on the hills from the menace of the slums below.\"<ref>p.&nbsp;518.</ref> Moreover, they fear that increasing welfare will create a \"custodial state\" in \"a high-tech and more lavish version of the Indian reservation for some substantial minority of the nation's population.\" They also predict increasing [[totalitarianism]]: \"It is difficult to imagine the United States preserving its heritage of individualism, equal rights before the law, free people running their own lives, once it is accepted that a significant part of the population must be made permanent wards of the states.\"<ref>p.&nbsp;526.</ref>\n\nThe authors recommended the elimination of welfare policies that encourage poor women to have babies:\n\n{{quote|We can imagine no recommendation for using the government to manipulate fertility that does not have dangers. But this highlights the problem: The United States already has policies that inadvertently social-engineer who has babies, and it is encouraging the wrong women. \"If the United States did as much to encourage high-IQ women to have babies as it now does to encourage low-IQ women, it would rightly be described as engaging in aggressive manipulation of fertility.\" The technically precise description of America's fertility policy is that it subsidizes births among poor women, who are also disproportionately at the low end of the intelligence distribution. We urge generally that these policies, represented by the extensive network of cash and services for low-income women who have babies, be ended. The government should stop subsidizing births to anyone rich or poor. The other generic recommendation, as close to harmless as any government program we can imagine, is to make it easy for women to make good on their prior decision not to get pregnant by making available birth control mechanisms that are increasingly flexible, foolproof, inexpensive, and safe.<ref>pp. 548\u2013549.</ref>}}\n\n==Media reception==\n''The Bell Curve'' received a great deal of media attention.

Lucas, [[Ann Swidler]], and Kim Voss in the book ''[[Inequality by Design]]'' recalculated the effect of socioeconomic status, using the same variables as ''The Bell Curve'', but weighting them differently. They found that if IQ scores are adjusted, as Herrnstein and Murray did, to eliminate the effect of [[education]], the ability of IQ to predict [[poverty]] can become dramatically larger, by as much as 61 percent for whites and 74 percent for blacks. According to the authors, Herrnstein and Murray's finding that IQ predicts poverty much better than socioeconomic status is substantially a result of the way they handled the statistics.<ref>''[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/5877.html Inequality by Design: Cracking the Bell Curve Myth]'' Claude S.

Korenman and Winship concluded: \"...{{nbsp}}there is evidence of substantial bias due to measurement error in their estimates of the effects of parents' socioeconomic status. In addition, Herrnstein and Murray's measure of parental socioeconomic status (SES) fails to capture the effects of important elements of family background (such as single-parent family structure at age 14). As a result, their analysis gives an exaggerated impression of the importance of IQ relative to parents' SES, and relative to family background more generally. Estimates based on a variety of methods, including analyses of siblings, suggest that parental family background is at least as important, and may be more important than IQ in determining socioeconomic success in adulthood.\"<ref>http://ssrn.com/abstract=225294 Korenman, Sanders and Winship, Christopher, \"A Reanalysis of The Bell Curve\" (August 1995).

This work argues that much of the public response was polemic, and failed to analyze the details of the science and validity of the statistical arguments underlying the book's conclusions.<ref name=\"devlin\"/>\n\n=== Criticism of use of AFQT ===\nWilliam J. Matthews writes that part of ''The Bell Curve'''s analysis is based on the AFQT \"which is not an IQ test but designed to predict performance of certain criterion variables\".<ref name=\"badscience\">William J. Matthews, Ph.D. (1998) ''[http://goinside.com/1998/03/23/a-review-of-the-bell-curve-bad-science-makes-for-bad-conclusions/ A Review of the Bell Curve: Bad Science Makes for Bad Conclusions]''</ref> The AFQT covers subjects such as trigonometry.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHeckman observed that the AFQT was designed only to predict success in military training schools and that most of these tests appear to be achievement tests rather than ability tests, measuring factual knowledge and not pure ability. He continues:\n\n{{quote|Ironically, the authors delete from their composite AFQT score a timed test of numerical operations because it is not highly correlated with the other tests. Yet it is well known that in the data they use, this subtest is the single best predictor of earnings of all the AFQT test components. The fact that many of the subtests are only weakly correlated with each other, and that the best predictor of earnings is only weakly correlated with their \"g-loaded\" score, only heightens doubts that a single-ability model is a satisfactory description of human intelligence. It also drives home the point that the \"g-loading\" so strongly emphasized by Murray and Herrnstein measures only agreement among tests\u2014not predictive power for socioeconomic outcomes. By the same token, one could also argue that the authors have biased their empirical analysis against the conclusions they obtain by disregarding the test with the greatest predictive power.<ref name=heckman/><ref name=\"reason\">''[http://www.reason.com/news/show/29636.html Cracked Bell]'' James J.

Using the same data, we demonstrate their finding is very fragile.<ref>''The Intergenerational Transmission of 'Intelligence' Down the Slippery Slopes of 'The Bell Curve' '' Industrial Relations: A Journal of Economy and Society, Vol. 38, No. 3, July 1999</ref>}}\n\n=== Cognitive sorting ===\nCharles R. Tittle and Thomas Rotolo found that the more the written, IQ-like, examinations are used as screening devices for occupational access, the stronger the relationship between IQ and income. Thus, rather than higher IQ leading to status attainment because it indicates skills needed in a modern society, IQ may reflect the same test-taking abilities used in artificial screening devices by which status groups protect their domains.<ref>\"IQ and Stratification: An Empirical Evaluation of Herrnstein and Murray's Social Change Argument\".

Hauser]] write that Herrnstein and Murray provide scant evidence of growth in cognitive sorting. Using data from the General Social Survey, they tested each of these hypotheses using a short verbal ability test which was administered to about 12,500 American adults between 1974 and 1994; the results provided no support for any of the trend hypotheses advanced by Herrnstein and Murray. One chart in ''The Bell Curve'' purports to show that people with IQs above 120 have become \"rapidly more concentrated\" in high-IQ occupations since 1940. But Robert Hauser and his colleague Min-Hsiung Huang retested the data and came up with estimates that fell \"well below those of Herrnstein and Murray.\" They add that the data, properly used, \"do not tell us anything except that selected, highly educated occupation groups have grown rapidly since 1940.\"<ref>''[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ap/so/1997/00000026/00000003/art00604 Verbal Ability and Socioeconomic Success: A Trend Analysis]'' Hauser R.M.; Huang M.H.</ref>\n\nIn 1972, [[Noam Chomsky]] questioned Herrnstein's idea that society was developing towards a [[meritocracy]]. Chomsky criticized the assumptions that people only seek occupations based on material gain. He argued that Herrnstein would not want to become a baker or lumberjack even if he could earn more money that way. He also criticized the assumption that such a society would be fair with pay based on value of contributions. He argued that because there are already unjust great inequalities, people will often be paid, not for valuable contributions to society, but to preserve such inequalities.<ref name=Chomsky>Chomsky, Noam. 1972. \"[http://newlearningonline.com/new-learning/chapter-6-the-nature-of-learning/chomsky-on-iq-and-inequality/ Chomsky on IQ and inequality I.Q.

The authors were reported throughout the popular press as arguing that these IQ differences are strictly genetic, when in fact they attributed IQ differences to both genes and the environment in chapter 13: \"It seems highly likely to us that both genes and the environment have something to do with racial differences.\" The introduction to the chapter more cautiously states, \"The debate about whether and how much genes and environment have to do with ethnic differences remains unresolved.\"\n\nWhen several prominent critics turned this into an \"assumption\" that the authors had attributed most or all of the racial differences in IQ to genes, co-author Charles Murray responded by quoting two passages from the book:\n* If the reader is now convinced that either the genetic or environmental explanation has won out to the exclusion of the other, we have not done a sufficiently good job of presenting one side or the other. It seems highly likely to us that both genes and the environment have something to do with racial differences. What might the mix be? We are resolutely agnostic on that issue; as far as we can determine, the evidence does not justify an estimate.

So did white mountaineer children in the United States tested back in the early 1930s ... Strangely, Herrnstein and Murray refer to \"folklore\" that \"Jews and other immigrant groups were thought to be below average in intelligence.\" It was neither folklore nor anything as subjective as thoughts. It was based on hard data, as hard as any data in ''The Bell Curve''. These groups repeatedly tested below average on the mental tests of the World War I era, both in the army and in civilian life. For Jews, it is clear that later tests showed radically different results\u2014during an era when there was very little intermarriage to change the genetic makeup of American Jews.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://search.opinionarchives.com/Summary/AmericanSpectator/V28I2P32-1.htm|title=Ethnicity and IQ|first=Thomas|last=Sowell|year=1995|volume=28|issue=2|journal=[[The American Spectator]]}}</ref>}}\n\n[[J.

At a protein farm, he retires [[List of Blade Runner characters#Sapper Morton|Sapper Morton]] and finds a box buried under a tree. The box contains the remains of a female replicant who died during a [[caesarean section]], demonstrating that replicants can reproduce biologically, previously thought impossible. K's superior, [[List of Blade Runner characters#Lt. Joshi|Lt. Joshi]], fears that this could lead to a war between humans and replicants. She orders K to find and retire the replicant child to hide the truth.\n\nK visits the headquarters of the Wallace Corporation, the successor to the defunct Tyrell Corporation in the manufacture of replicants. Wallace staff members identify the deceased female from DNA archives as [[List of Blade Runner characters#Rachael|Rachael]], an experimental replicant designed by [[List of Blade Runner characters#Dr. Eldon Tyrell|Dr. Eldon Tyrell]]. K learns of Rachael's romantic ties with former blade runner [[Rick Deckard]]. Wallace Corporation CEO [[List of Blade Runner characters#Niander Wallace|Niander Wallace]] wants to discover the secret to replicant reproduction to expand [[Space colonization|interstellar colonization]]. He sends his replicant enforcer [[List of Blade Runner characters#Luv|Luv]] to steal Rachael's remains and follow K to Rachael's child.\n\nAt Morton's farm, K sees the date 6-10-21 carved into the tree trunk and recognizes it from a childhood memory of a wooden toy horse. Because replicants' memories are artificial, K's [[Hologram|holographic]] [[AI]] girlfriend [[List of Blade Runner characters#Joi|Joi]] believes this is evidence that K was born, not created. He searches LAPD records and discovers twins born on that date with identical DNA aside from the [[Allosome|sex chromosome]], but only the boy is listed as alive. K tracks the child to an orphanage in ruined [[San Diego]] but discovers the records from that year to be missing. K recognizes the orphanage from his memories and finds the toy horse where he remembers hiding it.\n\n[[List of Blade Runner characters#Ana Stelline|Dr. Ana Stelline]], a replicant memory designer, confirms that the memory of the orphanage is real, leading K to conclude that he is Rachael's son. At LAPD headquarters, K fails a post-traumatic baseline test, marking him as a rogue replicant; he lies to Joshi by implying he killed the replicant child. Joshi gives K 48 hours to disappear. At Joi's request, K reluctantly transfers her to a mobile emitter, an emanator, so he cannot be tracked through her console memory-files. He has the toy horse analyzed, revealing traces of radiation that lead him to the ruins of [[Las Vegas]]. He finds Deckard, who reveals that he is the father of Rachael's child and that he scrambled the birth records to protect the child's identity; Deckard left the child in the custody of the replicant freedom movement.\n\nLuv kills Joshi and tracks K to Las Vegas. She kidnaps Deckard, destroys Joi, and leaves K to die. The replicant freedom movement rescues K. When their leader, [[List of Blade Runner characters#Freysa Sadeghpour|Freysa]], tells him that she helped deliver Rachael's child and that her child was actually a girl, K understands that he is not Rachael's child, deduces that Stelline is her daughter and that the memory of the toy horse is hers, one she implanted amongst those of other replicants whose memories she designed. To prevent Deckard from leading Wallace to Stelline or the freedom movement, Freysa asks K to kill Deckard for the greater good of all replicants.\n\nLuv takes Deckard to Wallace Corporation headquarters to meet Wallace. Wallace offers Deckard a clone of Rachael in exchange for revealing what he knows. Deckard refuses, and the clone is killed. As Luv transports Deckard to be tortured and interrogated off-world, K intercepts Luv's shuttle and tries to rescue Deckard. He fights Luv and manages to drown her, but he is mortally wounded. He stages Deckard's death to protect him from Wallace and the replicant freedom movement before taking Deckard to Stelline's office and handing him her toy horse. As K lies motionless on the steps, looking up at the snowing sky, Deckard enters the building and meets his daughter for the first time.{{efn|In an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', ''Blade Runner 2049'' screenwriter Michael Green confirmed that K dies as he lies motionless on the steps.<ref name=\"ewmovies\"/>}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Blade Runner characters}}\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Ryan Gosling]] as K\n*[[Harrison Ford]] as [[Rick Deckard]]\n*[[Ana de Armas]] as Joi\n*[[Sylvia Hoeks]] as Luv\n*[[Robin Wright]] as Lt.

Feminism is one potential solution to this problem: removing the barriers which make women feel that motherhood is a closing of doors.

The film was praised by critics for its performances, direction, cinematography, musical score, production design, visual effects, and faithfulness to the original film, and was considered by many critics to be among the best films of 2017.

[[List of Blade Runner characters#K|K]], a replicant, works for the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) as a \"blade runner,\" an officer who hunts and \"retires\" (kills) rogue replicants. At a protein farm, he retires [[List of Blade Runner characters#Sapper Morton|Sapper Morton]] and finds a box buried under a tree. The box contains the remains of a female replicant who died during a [[caesarean section]], demonstrating that replicants can reproduce biologically, previously thought impossible. K's superior, [[List of Blade Runner characters#Lt. Joshi|Lt. Joshi]], fears that this could lead to a war between humans and replicants. She orders K to find and retire the replicant child to hide the truth.\n\nK visits the headquarters of the Wallace Corporation, the successor to the defunct Tyrell Corporation in the manufacture of replicants. Wallace staff members identify the deceased female from DNA archives as [[List of Blade Runner characters#Rachael|Rachael]], an experimental replicant designed by [[List of Blade Runner characters#Dr. Eldon Tyrell|Dr. Eldon Tyrell]]. K learns of Rachael's romantic ties with former blade runner [[Rick Deckard]]. Wallace Corporation CEO [[List of Blade Runner characters#Niander Wallace|Niander Wallace]] wants to discover the secret to replicant reproduction to expand [[Space colonization|interstellar colonization]]. He sends his replicant enforcer [[List of Blade Runner characters#Luv|Luv]] to steal Rachael's remains and follow K to Rachael's child.\n\nAt Morton's farm, K sees the date 6-10-21 carved into the tree trunk and recognizes it from a childhood memory of a wooden toy horse. Because replicants' memories are artificial, K's [[Hologram|holographic]] [[AI]] girlfriend [[List of Blade Runner characters#Joi|Joi]] believes this is evidence that K was born, not created. He searches LAPD records and discovers twins born on that date with identical DNA aside from the [[Allosome|sex chromosome]], but only the boy is listed as alive. K tracks the child to an orphanage in ruined [[San Diego]] but discovers the records from that year to be missing. K recognizes the orphanage from his memories and finds the toy horse where he remembers hiding it.\n\n[[List of Blade Runner characters#Ana Stelline|Dr. Ana Stelline]], a replicant memory designer, confirms that the memory of the orphanage is real, leading K to conclude that he is Rachael's son. At LAPD headquarters, K fails a post-traumatic baseline test, marking him as a rogue replicant; he lies to Joshi by implying he killed the replicant child. Joshi gives K 48 hours to disappear. At Joi's request, K reluctantly transfers her to a mobile emitter, an emanator, so he cannot be tracked through her console memory-files. He has the toy horse analyzed, revealing traces of radiation that lead him to the ruins of [[Las Vegas]]. He finds Deckard, who reveals that he is the father of Rachael's child and that he scrambled the birth records to protect the child's identity; Deckard left the child in the custody of the replicant freedom movement.\n\nLuv kills Joshi and tracks K to Las Vegas. She kidnaps Deckard, destroys Joi, and leaves K to die. The replicant freedom movement rescues K. When their leader, [[List of Blade Runner characters#Freysa Sadeghpour|Freysa]], tells him that she helped deliver Rachael's child and that her child was actually a girl, K understands that he is not Rachael's child, deduces that Stelline is her daughter and that the memory of the toy horse is hers, one she implanted amongst those of other replicants whose memories she designed. To prevent Deckard from leading Wallace to Stelline or the freedom movement, Freysa asks K to kill Deckard for the greater good of all replicants.\n\nLuv takes Deckard to Wallace Corporation headquarters to meet Wallace. Wallace offers Deckard a clone of Rachael in exchange for revealing what he knows. Deckard refuses, and the clone is killed. As Luv transports Deckard to be tortured and interrogated off-world, K intercepts Luv's shuttle and tries to rescue Deckard. He fights Luv and manages to drown her, but he is mortally wounded. He stages Deckard's death to protect him from Wallace and the replicant freedom movement before taking Deckard to Stelline's office and handing him her toy horse. As K lies motionless on the steps, looking up at the snowing sky, Deckard enters the building and meets his daughter for the first time.{{efn|In an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', ''Blade Runner 2049'' screenwriter Michael Green confirmed that K dies as he lies motionless on the steps.<ref name=\"ewmovies\"/>}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Blade Runner characters}}\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Ryan Gosling]] as K\n*[[Harrison Ford]] as [[Rick Deckard]]\n*[[Ana de Armas]] as Joi\n*[[Sylvia Hoeks]] as Luv\n*[[Robin Wright]] as Lt.

Feminism is one potential solution to this problem: removing the barriers which make women feel that motherhood is a closing of doors.
