[[Art history|Art historians]] are, therefore ,able to use fashion with confidence and precision to date images, often to within five years, particularly in the case of images from the 15th century. Initially, changes in fashion led to a fragmentation across the upper classes of Europe of what had previously been a very similar style of dressing and the subsequent development of distinctive national styles. These national styles remained very different until a counter-movement in the 17th to 18th centuries imposed similar styles once again, mostly originating from [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] [[France]].<ref>Braudel, 317\u2013324</ref> Though the rich usually led fashion, the increasing affluence of [[early modern Europe]] led to the [[bourgeoisie]] and even peasants following trends at a distance, but still uncomfortably close for the elites \u2013 a factor that Fernand Braudel regards as one of the main motors of changing fashion.<ref>Braudel, 313\u2013315</ref>\n\n[[File:ADurerNuremburgVenetianWomen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s drawing contrasts a well turned out ''bourgeoise'' from [[Nuremberg]] (left) with her counterpart from Venice.

The Haute house was the name established by the government for the fashion houses that met the standards of the industry.

[[Fashion week]]s are held in these cities, where designers exhibit their new clothing collections to audiences.  A succession of major designers such as [[Coco Chanel]] and [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint-Laurent]] have kept Paris as the center most watched by the rest of the world, although ''haute couture'' is now subsidized by the sale of [[ready-to-wear]] collections and perfume using the same branding.\n\nModern [[Western culture|West]]erners have a vast number of choices available in the selection of their clothes. What a person chooses to wear can reflect his or her personality or interests. When people who have high cultural [[Social status|status]] start to wear new or different clothes, a fashion trend may start. People who like or respect these people become influenced by their style and begin wearing similarly styled clothes. Fashions may vary considerably within a society according to age, [[social class]], generation, occupation, and geography and may also vary over time. If an older person dresses according to the fashion young people use, he or she may look ridiculous in the eyes of both young and older people. The terms ''fashionista'' and ''[[fashion victim]]'' refer to someone who slavishly follows current fashions.\n\nOne can regard the system of sporting various fashions as a fashion language incorporating various fashion statements using a grammar of fashion. (Compare some of the work of [[Roland Barthes]].)\n\nIn recent years, Asian fashion has become increasingly significant in local and global markets. Countries such as China, Japan, India, and Pakistan have traditionally had large textile industries, which have often been drawn upon by Western designers, but now Asian clothing styles are also gaining influence based on their ideas.<ref>Lemire, B., & Riello, G (2008). \"East & West: Textiles and Fashion in Early Modern Europe\".

It was handmade for individuals, either as home production or on order from dressmakers and tailors. By the beginning of the 20th century\u2014with the rise of new technologies such as the [[sewing machine]], the rise of global capitalism and the development of the factory system of production, and the proliferation of retail outlets such as department stores\u2014clothing had increasingly come to be [[mass production|mass-produced]] in standard sizes and sold at fixed prices.\n\nAlthough the fashion industry developed first in Europe and America, {{as of | 2017 | lc = on}}, it is an international and highly globalized industry, with clothing often designed in one country, manufactured in another, and sold worldwide. For example, an American fashion company might source fabric in China and have the clothes manufactured in Vietnam, finished in Italy, and shipped to a warehouse in the United States for distribution to retail outlets internationally. The fashion industry has long been one of the largest employers in the United States,<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry#toc296474</ref> and it remains so in the 21st century. However, U.S. employment declined considerably as production increasingly moved overseas, especially to China. Because data on the fashion industry typically are reported for national economies and expressed in terms of the industry's many separate sectors, aggregate figures for the world [[textile industry|production of textiles]] and [[Clothing industry|clothing]] are difficult to obtain.

For example, First Lady [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]] was a fashionable icon of the early 1960s who led the formal dressing trend. By wearing a Chanel suit, a structural Givenchy shift dress ,or a soft color Cassini coat with Large buttons, it created her elegant look and led a delicate trend.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5J3PDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA52#v=onepage&q=First%20Lady%20Jacqueline%20Kennedy%20was%20a%20fashionable%20icon%20of%20the%20early%201960s|title=Women in Fashion|last=Rissman|first=Rebecca|date=2016-08-15|publisher=ABDO|isbn=9781680774856}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the political revolution also made much impact on the fashion trend. For example, during the 1960s, the economy had become wealthier, the divorce rate was increasing ,and the government approved the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]]. This revolution inspired the younger generation to rebellion. In 1964, the leg-baring mini-skirt became a significant  fashion trend of the 1960s. Given that fashion designers began to experiment with the shapes of garment, loose sleeveless, micro-minis, flared skirts, and trumpet sleeves. In this case, the mini-skirt trend became an icon of the 1960s.\n\nMoreover, the political movement built an impressive relationship with fashion trends. For instance, during the Vietnam war, the youth of America made a movement that affected the whole country. In the 1960s, the fashion trend was full of fluorescent colors, prints patterns, bell-bottom jeans, fringed vests, and skirt became a protest outfit of the 1960s. This trend was called Hippie , and it is still affecting the current fashion trend.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://classroom.synonym.com/political-economic-factors-influenced-fashion-1960s-12014.html|title=Political & Economic Factors That Influenced Fashion in the 1960s {{!}} The Classroom {{!}} Synonym|website=classroom.synonym.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref>\n\n=== Technology influences ===\n\nTechnology plays a significant role in most aspects of today's society.

The camouflage pattern in clothing was developed to help military personnel be less visible to enemy forces.  A trend emerged in the 1960s , and camouflage fabric was introduced to streetwear. The camouflage fabric trend disappeared and resurfaced several times since then.

According to Matika,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sundaynews.co.zw/does-pop-culture-influence-fashion/|title=Does pop culture influence fashion?|website=www.sundaynews.co.zw|access-date=2016-03-07}}</ref> \"Elements of popular culture become fused when a person's trend is associated with a preference for a genre of music\u2026like music, news or literature, fashion has been fused into everyday lives.\" Fashion is not only seen as pure aesthetic values; fashion is also a medium for performers to create an overall atmosphere and express their opinions altogether through music video. The latest music video \u2018Formation\u2019 by Beyonc\u00e9, according to Carlos,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/13396069/beyonce-music-video-givenchy-gucci-miu-miu/|title=The Fashion in Beyonc\u00e9's New Video Is as Powerful as Its Politics|last=Carlos|first=Marjon|website=Vogue|access-date=2016-03-07}}</ref> \"The pop star pays homage to her Creole root.... tracing the roots of the Louisiana cultural nerve center from the post-abolition era to present day, Beyonc\u00e9 catalogs the evolution of the city's vibrant style and its tumultuous history all at once.

For designer like Vivienne Westwood, runway shows are a platform for her voice on politics and current events. For her AW15 menswear show, according to Water,<ref name=\"Dazed\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/24335/1/vivienne-westwood-s-top-ten-political-moments|title=Vivienne Westwood's top ten political moments|last=Dazed|website=Dazed|access-date=2016-03-07}}</ref> \"where models with severely bruised faces channeled eco-warriors on a mission to save the planet.\" Another recent example is a staged feminist protest march for Chanel's SS15 show, rioting models chanting words of empowerment with signs like \"Feminist but feminine\" and \"Ladies first.\" According to Water,<ref name=\"Dazed\" /> \"The show tapped into Chanel's long history of championing female independence: founder Coco Chanel was a trailblazer for liberating the female body in the post-WWI era, introducing silhouettes that countered the restrictive corsets then in favour.\"\n\n=== Economic influences ===\n\n==== Circular economy ====\nWith increasing environmental awareness, the economic imperative to \"Spend now, think later\" is getting increasingly scrutinized.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Vaughn/Berelowitz|first=Jessica/Marian|date=2015|title=The circular economy|url=http://0-www.warc.com.library.scad.edu/Content/ContentViewer.aspx?MasterContentRef=4f8c0345-e2ef-48a2-ae79-b614a535a19d&q=economy+trend+fashion&CID=A105052&PUB=ATTICUS|journal=Warc|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> Today's consumer tends to be more mindful about consumption, looking for just enough and better, more durable options. People have also become more conscious of the impact their everyday consumption has on the environment and society, and these initiatives are often described as a move towards [[sustainable fashion]], yet critics argue a circular economy based on growth is an oxymoron, or an increasing spiral of consumption, rather than a utopian [[Cradle-to-cradle design|cradle-to-cradle]] circular solution.\n\nIn today's linear economical system, manufacturers extract resources from the earth to make products that will soon be discarded in landfills, on the other hand, under the [[Circular economy|circular]] model, the production of goods operates like systems in nature, where the waste and demise of a substance becomes the food and source of growth for something new. Companies such as MUD Jeans, which is based in the Netherlands employs a leasing scheme for jeans. This Dutch company \"represents a new consuming philosophy that is about using instead of owning,\" according to MUD's website. The concept also protects the company from volatile cotton prices. Consumers pay \u20ac7.50 a month for a pair of jeans; after a year, they can return the jeans to Mud,  trade them for a new pair and start another year-long lease, or keep them. MUD is responsible for any repairs during the lease period.<ref name=\":0\" /> Another ethical fashion company, [[Patagonia (clothing)|Patagonia]] set up the first multi-seller branded store on EBay in order to facilitate secondhand sales; consumers who take the Common Threads pledge can sell in this store and have their gear listed on Patagonia.com's \"Used Gear\" section.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== China's domestic spending ====\nConsumption as a share of gross domestic product in China has fallen for six decades, from 76 percent in 1952 to 28 percent in 2011. China plans to reduce [[tariff]]s on a number of consumer goods and expand its 72-hour transit visa plan to more cities in an effort to stimulate domestic consumption.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Ap|first=Tiffany|date=November 2015|title=China Makes Moves to Boost Consumption|url=http://0-wwd.com.library.scad.edu/retail-news/markets/china-consumption-beijing-import-tax-10286320/|journal=Women's Wear Daily|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe announcement of import tax reductions follows changes in June 2015, when the government cut the tariffs on clothing, cosmetics and various other goods by half. Among the changes \u2014 easier tax refunds for overseas shoppers and accelerated openings of more duty-free shops in cities covered by the 72-hour visa scheme. The 72-hour visa was introduced in Beijing and Shanghai in January 2013 and has been extended to 18 Chinese cities.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAccording to reports at the same time, Chinese consumer spending in other countries such as Japan has slowed even though the yen has dropped.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kaiser|first=Amanda|date=14 March 2016|title=Tokyo Fashion Week Starts in Challenging Economy|url=http://0-wwd.com.library.scad.edu/business-news/sourcing-global-markets/japan-fashion-week-fall-2016-10388614-10388614/|journal=Women's Wear Daily|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> There is clearly a trend in the next 5 years that the domestic fashion market will show an increase.\n\nChina is an interesting market for fashion retail as Chinese consumers' motivation to shop for fashion items are unique from Western Audiences.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=Christopher J.|last2=Wenyu|first2=Lu|date=2019-05-13|title=What influences Chinese fashion retail?

Chinese high-street shoppers prefer adventure and social shopping, while online shoppers are motived by idea shopping. Another difference is how gratification and idea shopping influence spending over \u00a51k per month on fashion items, and regular spending influenced by value shopping.\n\n=== Marketing ===\n[[File:Petite Panoply- Trip to Cumberland Island, Georgia (20775335400).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|A tourist couple wearing [[casual attire|casual]] clothes at [[Cumberland Island]], 2015]]\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=250\n| image1 = Chinese model posing as CEO (6759428801).jpg\n| image2 = LG\uc5d1\uc2a4\ub178\ud2b8 X300\u2019\uc758 CF \ub9e4\uc9c1(Magic)\ud3b8 (cropped).jpg\n| footer = Models posing in [[Informal attire|corporate office wear]].\n}}\n\n====Market research====\nConsumers of different groups have varying needs and demands. Factors taken into consideration when thinking of consumers' needs include key demographics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/consumer-needs-marketing-997.html|title=Consumer Needs & Marketing|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref>\nTo understand consumers' needs and predict fashion trends, fashion companies have to do [[market research]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://strategyn.com/customer-needs/|title=Strategyn|website=Strategyn|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref> There are two research methods: primary and secondary.<ref name=\"Consumer Research Methods\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.consumerpsychologist.com/cb_Research_Methods.html|title=Consumer Research Methods|website=www.consumerpsychologist.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref> Secondary methods are taking other information that has already been collected, for example using a book or an article for research. Primary research is collecting data through surveys, interviews, observation, and/or focus groups. Primary research often focuses on large sample sizes to determine customer's motivations to shop.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=Christopher J.|last2=Wenyu|first2=Lu|date=2019-05-13|title=What influences Chinese fashion retail? Shopping motivations, demographics and spending|url=https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JFMM-09-2017-0093/full/html|journal=Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management: An International Journal|language=en|volume=23|issue=2|pages=158\u2013175|doi=10.1108/JFMM-09-2017-0093|issn=1361-2026}}</ref>\n\nBenefits of primary research is specific information about a fashion brand's consumer is explored. Surveys are helpful tools; questions can be open-ended or closed-ended. A negative factor surveys and interviews present is that the answers can be biased, due to wording in the survey or on face-to-face interactions.  Focus groups, about 8 to 12 people, can be beneficial because several points can be addressed in depth. However, there are drawbacks to this tactic, too. With such a small sample size, it is hard to know if the greater public would react the same way as the focus group.<ref name=\"Consumer Research Methods\"/> Observation can really help a company gain insight on what a consumer truly wants. There is less of a bias because consumers are just performing their daily tasks, not necessarily realizing they are being observed. For example, observing the public by taking street style photos of people, the consumer did not get dressed in the morning knowing that would have their photo taken necessarily. They just wear what they would normally wear. Through observation patterns can be seen, helping trend forecasters know what their target market needs and wants.\n\nKnowing the needs of the consumers will increase a fashion companies' sales and profits. Through research and studying the consumers' lives the needs of the customer can be obtained and help fashion brands know what trends the consumers are ready for.\n\n====Symbolic consumption====\nConsumption is driven not only by need, the symbolic meaning for consumers is also a factor. Consumers engaging in symbolic consumption may develop a sense of self over an extended period of time as various objects are collected as part of the process of establishing their identity and, when the symbolic meaning is shared in a social group, to communicate their identity to others. For teenagers consumption plays a role in distinguishing the child self from the adult. Researchers have found that the fashion choices of teenagers are used for self-expression and also to recognize other teens who wear similar clothes. The symbolic association of clothing items can link individuals personality and interests, with music as a prominent factor influencing fashion decisions.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Piacentini |first1=Maria |title=Symbolic consumption in teenagers' clothing choices |journal=Journal of Consumer Behavior |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=251-262}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n[[File:Tanzturnier 28.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Latin dance]]rs in their [[costume]]s. The woman is wearing [[backless dress]] with deep slits on its lower portion, while the man is wearing a shirt with top buttons open.]]\n\nThe media plays a significant role when it comes to fashion. For instance, an important part of fashion is [[fashion journalism]]. Editorial critique, guidelines, and commentary can be found on television and in magazines, newspapers, fashion websites, social networks, and [[fashion blog]]s. In recent years, fashion blogging and [[YouTube]] videos have become a major outlet for spreading trends and fashion tips, creating an online culture of sharing one's style on a website or Instagram account. Through these media outlets readers and viewers all over the world can learn about fashion, making it very accessible.<ref>Fashion (2012, March 29). Wwd. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news</ref> In addition to fashion journalism, another media platform that is important in fashion industry is advertisement. Advertisements provide information to audiences and promote the sales of products and services. Fashion industry utilizes advertisements to attract consumers and promote its products to generate sales. Few decades ago when technology was still underdeveloped, advertisements heavily relied on radio, magazines, billboards, and newspapers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://smallbusiness.chron.com/examples-traditional-advertising-24312.html|title=Examples of Traditional Advertising|last=Lauren|first=Lynn|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> These days, there are more various ways in advertisements such as television ads, online-based ads using internet websites, and posts, videos, and live streaming in social media platforms.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, fashion magazines began to include photographs of various fashion designs and became even more influential than in the past.<ref>{{Citation|publisher=Fairchild Publications|isbn=9781501303869|doi=10.5040/9781501303869.ch-014|title = Marketing Fashion|year = 2012|chapter = Fashion Advertising, Sales Promotion, and Public Relations}}</ref> In cities throughout the world these magazines were greatly sought after and had a profound effect on public taste in clothing. Talented illustrators drew exquisite fashion plates for the publications which covered the most recent developments in fashion and beauty. Perhaps the most famous of these magazines was ''[[La Gazette du Bon Ton]]'', which was founded in 1912 by Lucien Vogel and regularly published until 1925 (with the exception of the war years).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abebooks.com/books/features/lithographs/gazette-du-bon-ton.shtml|title=Gazette du Bon Ton: A Journal of Good Taste|website=www.abebooks.com|access-date=2018-07-04}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Crystal Couture Fashion Show & Sale (32801142162).jpg|thumb|upright|A [[See-through clothing|see-through]] top worn along with [[pasties]] by a model at a [[fashion show]] in USA, 2017. Such [[fashion trend]]s get popularised through media.]]\n''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', founded in the United States in 1892, has been the longest-lasting and most successful of the hundreds of fashion magazines that have come and gone. Increasing affluence after [[World War&nbsp;II]] and, most importantly, the advent of cheap color printing in the 1960s, led to a huge boost in its sales and heavy coverage of fashion in mainstream women's magazines, followed by men's magazines in the 1990s. One such example of ''Vogue'''s popularity is the younger version, ''[[Teen Vogue]]'', which covers clothing and trends that are targeted more toward the \"fashionista on a budget\". [[Haute couture]] designers followed the trend by starting [[ready-to-wear]] and [[perfume]] lines which are heavily advertised in the magazines and now dwarf their original couture businesses. A recent development within fashion print media is the rise of text-based and critical magazines which aim to prove that fashion is not superficial, by creating a dialogue between fashion academia and the industry. Examples of this trend are: ''[[Fashion Theory (journal)|Fashion Theory]]'' (1997)  and ''[[Vestoj]]'' (2009). Television coverage began in the 1950s with small fashion features. In the 1960s and 1970s, fashion segments on various entertainment shows became more frequent, and by the 1980s, dedicated fashion shows such as ''[[Fashion Television]]'' started to appear. ''[[FashionTV]]'' was the pioneer in this undertaking and has since grown to become the leader in both Fashion Television and new media channels. The Fashion Industry is beginning to promote their styles through Bloggers on social media's. Vogue specified Chiara Ferragni as \"blogger of the moment\" due to the rises of followers through her Fashion Blog, that became popular.<ref>Fateh, Azhar. \u201cHow Social Media Is Changing Fashion?\u201d The Huffington Post, TheHuffingtonPost.com, 19 Jan. 2017, Retrieved From www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-social-media-is-changing-fashion_us_587edd29e4b06a0baf64918f.</ref>\n\nA few days after the 2010 Fall Fashion Week in New York City came to a close, ''[[The New Islander]]'''s Fashion Editor, Genevieve Tax, criticized the fashion industry for running on a seasonal schedule of its own, largely at the expense of real-world consumers. \"Because designers release their fall collections in the spring and their spring collections in the fall, fashion magazines such as ''Vogue'' always and only look forward to the upcoming season, promoting parkas come September while issuing reviews on shorts in January\", she writes. \"Savvy shoppers, consequently, have been conditioned to be extremely, perhaps impractically, farsighted with their buying.\"<ref>Tax, Genevieve.

Specific fashion brands have been featured in film, not only as [[product placement]] opportunities, but as bespoke items that have subsequently led to trends in fashion.<ref>Thompson, S.B.N., Hussein, Y., Jones, N.

This is evident not only from television shows directly spotlighting the fashion industry, but also movies, events and music videos which showcase fashion statements as well as promote specific brands through product placements.\n\n=== Controversial advertisements in fashion industry ===\n\n==== Racism in fashion advertisements ====\nThere are some fashion advertisements that were accused of racism and led to boycotts from the customers. Globally known, Swedish fashion brand H&M faced this issue with one of its children's wear advertisements in 2018. A black child wearing a hoodie with a slogan written as \"coolest monkey in the jungle\" right at the center was featured in the ad. When it was released, it immediate became controversial and even led to boycott. A lot of people including celebrities posted on social media about their resentments towards H&M and refusal to work with and buy its products. H&M issued a statement saying \"we apologise to anyone this may have offended\", which seemed insincere to some.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/hm-hoodie-racist-boycott-advertising-people-h-m-a8149246.html|title=People are boycotting H&M over 'racist' hoodie|date=2018-01-09|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> \nAnother fashion advertisement regarding racism is from GAP, American worldwide clothing brand. GAP collaborated with Ellen DeGeneres in 2016 for the advertisement. It features playful, four young girls where tall white girl is leaning with her arm on a shorter black girl's head. When this ad was released, some viewers harshly criticized that it underlies passive racism. A representative from The Root, black culture magazine commented on the ad that it portrays the message that the black people are undervalued and seen like props for white people to look better.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-35968787|title=Is this Gap advert racist?|date=2016-04-06|access-date=2019-10-29|language=en-GB}}</ref> There were different points of views on this issue, some saying that people are being too sensitive, and some getting offended.

British high fashion brand, Jimmy Choo, was blamed for having sexism in its ad which featured a female British mode wearing the brand's boots. In this two-minute ad, men whistle at a model, walking on the street with red, sleeveless mini dress. This ad gained lots of backlashes and criticism by the viewers since sexual harassment and misconduct was a huge issue during this time and even till now. Many people showed their dismay through social media posts, leading Jimmy Choo to pull down the ad from social media platforms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mashable.com/2017/12/22/jimmy-choo-cara-delevingne-catcall-ad/|title=Jimmy Choo pulls Cara Delevingne ad after online backlash|last=Gallucci|first=Nicole|website=Mashable|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref>\n\nFrench luxury fashion brand Yves Saint Laurent also faced this issue with its print ad shown in Paris in 2017. A female model is wearing a fishnet tights with roller-skate stilettos, almost lying down with her legs opened in front of the camera. This advertisement brought harsh comments from the viewers and French advertising organization directors for going against the advertising codes related to \"respect for decency, dignity and those prohibiting submission, violence or dependence, as well as the use of stereotypes.\" They even said that this ad is causing \"mental harm to adolescents.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://adage.com/article/advertising/degrading-yves-saint-laurent-ads-shock-french-public/308196|title='Misogynist' YSL Ads Shock Parisians Ahead of International Women's Day|date=2017-03-07|website=adage.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> Lot of sarcastic comments were made in social media about the ad and the poster was removed from the city.\n\n==Public relations and social media==\n[[File:Ines Sainz.jpg|thumb|upright|A Mexican sports reporter wearing [[little black dress]] and knee-high boots]]\n\nFashion [[public relations]] involves being in touch with a company's audiences and creating strong relationships with them, reaching out to media and initiating messages that project positive images of the company.<ref>Sherman, G., & Perlman, S.

A certain way is chosen and that becomes the fashion as defined by a certain people as a whole, so if a particular style has a meaning in an already occurring set of beliefs that style will become fashion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia): Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=39\u201355 [42]}}</ref> According to Ted Polhemus and Lynn Procter, fashion can be described as adornment, of which there are two types: fashion and anti-fashion. Through the capitalization and commoditisation of clothing, accessories, and shoes, etc., what once constituted anti-fashion becomes part of fashion as the lines between fashion and anti-fashion are blurred.<ref>{{cite book|last=Polhemus and Procter|first=Ted and Lynn|title=Fashion and Anti-fashion: An Anthropology of Clothing and Adornment|year=1978|publisher=Thames and Hudson|page=12}}</ref>\n\nThe definition of fashion and [[anti-fashion]] is as follows:  Anti-fashion is fixed and changes little over time.  Anti-fashion is different depending on the cultural or social group one is associated with or where one lives, but within that group or locality the style changes little.  Fashion is the exact opposite of anti-fashion.  Fashion changes very quickly and is not affiliated with one group or area of the world but is spread out throughout the world wherever people can communicate easily with each other. For example, Queen Elizabeth II's 1953 coronation gown is an example of anti-fashion because it is traditional and does not change over any period whereas a gown from fashion designer Dior's collection of 1953 is fashion because the style will change every season as Dior comes up with a new gown to replace the old one. In the Dior gown the length, cut, fabric, and embroidery of the gown change from season to season.  Anti-fashion is concerned with maintaining the status quo while fashion is concerned with social mobility. Time is expressed in terms of continuity in anti-fashion and as change in fashion. Fashion has changing modes of adornment while anti-fashion has fixed modes of adornment. Indigenous and peasant modes of adornment are an example of anti-fashion. Change in fashion is part of the larger system and is structured to be a deliberate change in style.<ref>{{cite book|last=Polhemus and Procter|first=Ted and Lynn|title=Fashion and Anti-fashion: An Anthropology of Clothing and Adornment|year=1978|publisher=Thames and Hudson|pages=12\u201313}}</ref>\n\nToday, people in rich countries are linked to people in poor countries through the commoditization and consumption of what is called fashion.  People work long hours in one area of the globe to produce things that people in another part of the globe are anxious to consume. An example of this is the chain of production and consumption of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] shoes, which are produced in Taiwan and then purchased in North America. At the production end, there is nation-building a hard working ideology that leads people to produce and entices people to consume with a vast amount of goods for the offering{{clarify|date=June 2015}}. Commodities are no longer just utilitarian but are fashionable, be they running shoes or sweat suits.<ref>{{cite book|last=Skoggard|first=Ian|title=Transnational Commodity Flows and the Global Phenomenon of the Brand|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=57\u201369}}</ref>\n\nThe change from anti-fashion to fashion because of the influence of western consumer-driven civilization can be seen in eastern Indonesia. The ikat textiles of the Ngada area of eastern Indonesia are changing because of modernization and development. Traditionally, in the Ngada area there was no idea similar to that of the Western idea of fashion, but anti-fashion in the form of traditional textiles and ways to adorn oneself were widely popular. Textiles in Indonesia have played many roles for the local people.  Textiles defined a person's rank and status; certain textiles indicated being part of the ruling class.  People expressed their ethnic identity and social hierarchy through textiles.  Because some Indonesians bartered ikat textiles for food, the textiles constituted economic goods, and as some textile design motifs had spiritual religious meanings, textiles were also a way to communicate religious messages.<ref>{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia): Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=39\u201343}}</ref>\n\nIn eastern Indonesia, both the production and use of traditional textiles have been transformed as the production, use and value associated with textiles have changed due to modernization.  In the past, women produced the textiles either for home consumption or to trade with others.  Today, this has changed as most textiles are not being produced at home. Western goods are considered modern and are valued more than traditional goods, including the sarong, which retain a lingering association with [[colonialism]].  Now, sarongs are used only for rituals and ceremonial occasions, whereas western clothes are worn to church or government offices. Civil servants working in urban areas are more likely than peasants to make the distinction between western and traditional clothes. Following Indonesia's independence from the Dutch, people increasingly started buying factory made shirts and sarongs. In textile-producing areas the growing of cotton and production of naturally colored thread became obsolete. Traditional motifs on textiles are no longer considered the property of a certain social class or age group. Wives of government officials are promoting the use of traditional textiles in the form of western garments such as skirts, vests and blouses.  This trend is also being followed by the general populace, and whoever can afford to hire a tailor is doing so to stitch traditional ikat textiles into western clothes. Thus, traditional textiles are now fashion goods and are no longer confined to the black, white and brown colour palette but come in array of colours. Traditional textiles are also being used in interior decorations and to make handbags, wallets and other accessories, which are considered fashionable by civil servants and their families. There is also a booming tourist trade in the eastern Indonesian city of Kupang where international as well as domestic tourists are eager to purchase traditionally printed western goods.<ref>{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia): Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|page=41 and 45\u201348}}</ref>\n\nThe use of traditional textiles for fashion is becoming big business in eastern Indonesia, but these traditional textiles are losing their ethnic identity markers and are being used as an item of fashion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia): Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnationa}}</ref>\n\n==Intellectual property==\nIn the fashion industry, [[intellectual property]] is not enforced as it is within the [[film industry]] and [[music industry]]. Robert Glariston, an intellectual property expert, mentioned in a fashion seminar held in LA{{which|date=March 2014}} that \"Copyright law regarding clothing is a current hot-button issue in the industry. We often have to draw the line between designers being inspired by a design and those outright stealing it in different places.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://outspoken.wpshower.com/2013/06/design-details-by-larger-companies-is-what-often/|title=Design details by larger companies is what often {{!}} Outspoken|website=outspoken.wpshower.com|access-date=2018-08-16}}</ref>  To take inspiration from others' designs contributes to the fashion industry's ability to establish clothing trends. For the past few years, [[WGSN (fashion forecaster)|WGSN]] has been a dominant source of fashion news and forecasts in encouraging fashion brands worldwide to be inspired by one another. Enticing consumers to buy clothing by establishing new trends is, some have argued, a key component of the industry's success. Intellectual property rules that interfere with this process of trend-making would, in this view, be counter-productive. On the other hand, it is often argued that the blatant theft of new ideas, unique designs, and design details by larger companies is what often contributes to the failure of many smaller or independent design companies.\n\nSince fakes are distinguishable by their poorer quality, there is still a demand for luxury goods, and as only a trademark or logo can be copyrighted, many fashion brands make this one of the most visible aspects of the garment or accessory. In handbags, especially, the designer's brand may be woven into the fabric (or the lining fabric) from which the bag is made, making the brand an intrinsic element of the bag.\n\nIn 2005, the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) held a conference calling for stricter intellectual property enforcement within the fashion industry to better protect small and medium businesses and promote competitiveness within the textile and clothing industries.<ref>[http://www.ipfrontline.com/depts/article.asp?id=7678&deptid=8 IPFrontline.com]

For men, [[Pharrell Williams]], [[Kanye West]], and [[Ice Cube]] have also helped define modern day fashion for black men. Today's fashion scene is not just clothes, but also hair and makeup. Recent trends have included the embracing of natural hair, traditional clothing worn with modern clothing, or traditional patterns used in modern clothing styles. All of these trends come with the long existing and persevering movement of \"Black is Beautiful\".\n\n=== Early American Fashion ===\nIn the mid to end of the 1900s, African American style changed and developed with the times. Around the 1950s is really when the black community was able to create their own distinct styles. The term \"Sunday attire\" was coined,  communities emphasized \"Correct\" dress, it was especially important when \"stepping out\" for social occasions with community members, a habit that continues in the early 2000s.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/fashion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/african-american-dress|title=African American Dress {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref> Hair-dos and hairstyles also became a fashion statement, for example the \"conk\" which is hair that is slightly flattened and waved.<ref name=\":2\" /> Afros also emerged and they were often used to symbolize the rejection of white beauty standards at the time.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-illustrative-identity_n_6519244|title=An Illustrative Identity of Fashion and Style Throughout African-American History and Movements|date=2015-02-10|website=HuffPost|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref> Around the 1970s is when flashy costumes began to appear and black artists really started to define their presences through fashion.

Supporters adorned symbolic clothing, accessories and hairstyles, usually native to Africa.

This created the distinctive Western outline of a tailored top worn over leggings or trousers.\n\nThe pace of change accelerated considerably in the following century, and women's and men's fashion, especially in the dressing and adorning of the hair, became equally complex. [[Art history|Art historians]] are, therefore ,able to use fashion with confidence and precision to date images, often to within five years, particularly in the case of images from the 15th century. Initially, changes in fashion led to a fragmentation across the upper classes of Europe of what had previously been a very similar style of dressing and the subsequent development of distinctive national styles. These national styles remained very different until a counter-movement in the 17th to 18th centuries imposed similar styles once again, mostly originating from [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] [[France]].<ref>Braudel, 317\u2013324</ref> Though the rich usually led fashion, the increasing affluence of [[early modern Europe]] led to the [[bourgeoisie]] and even peasants following trends at a distance, but still uncomfortably close for the elites \u2013 a factor that Fernand Braudel regards as one of the main motors of changing fashion.<ref>Braudel, 313\u2013315</ref>\n\n[[File:ADurerNuremburgVenetianWomen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s drawing contrasts a well turned out ''bourgeoise'' from [[Nuremberg]] (left) with her counterpart from Venice.

[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] illustrated the differences in his actual (or composite) contrast of Nuremberg and Venetian fashions at the close of the 15th century (''illustration, right''). The \"Spanish style\" of the late 16th century began the move back to synchronicity among upper-class Europeans, and after a struggle in the mid-17th century, French styles decisively took over leadership, a process completed in the 18th century.<ref>Braudel, 317\u2013321</ref>\n\nThough different textile colors and patterns changed from year to year,<ref>Thornton, Peter. ''Baroque and Rococo Silks''.</ref> the cut of a gentleman's coat and the length of his waistcoat, or the pattern to which a lady's dress was cut, changed more slowly. Men's fashions were primarily derived from military models, and changes in a European male silhouette were galvanized in theaters of European war where gentleman officers had opportunities to make notes of different styles such as the \"Steinkirk\" [[cravat]] or necktie.\n\n[[File:MA-Lebrun.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Marie Antoinette]], wife of Louis XVI, was a leader of fashion.

By 1800, all Western Europeans were dressing alike (or thought they were); local variation became first a sign of provincial culture and later a badge of the conservative peasant.<ref>James Laver and Fernand Braudel, op cit</ref>\n\nAlthough tailors and dressmakers were no doubt responsible for many innovations, and the textile industry indeed led many trends, the [[history of fashion design]] is generally understood to date from 1858 when the English-born [[Charles Frederick Worth]] opened the first authentic ''[[haute couture]]'' house in Paris. The Haute house was the name established by the government for the fashion houses that met the standards of the industry.  These fashion houses have to adhere to standards such as keeping at least twenty employees engaged in making the clothes, showing two collections per year at fashion shows, and presenting a certain number of patterns to costumers.<ref>Claire B.

[[Fashion week]]s are held in these cities, where designers exhibit their new clothing collections to audiences.  A succession of major designers such as [[Coco Chanel]] and [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint-Laurent]] have kept Paris as the center most watched by the rest of the world, although ''haute couture'' is now subsidized by the sale of [[ready-to-wear]] collections and perfume using the same branding.\n\nModern [[Western culture|West]]erners have a vast number of choices available in the selection of their clothes. What a person chooses to wear can reflect his or her personality or interests. When people who have high cultural [[Social status|status]] start to wear new or different clothes, a fashion trend may start. People who like or respect these people become influenced by their style and begin wearing similarly styled clothes. Fashions may vary considerably within a society according to age, [[social class]], generation, occupation, and geography and may also vary over time. If an older person dresses according to the fashion young people use, he or she may look ridiculous in the eyes of both young and older people. The terms ''fashionista'' and ''[[fashion victim]]'' refer to someone who slavishly follows current fashions.\n\nOne can regard the system of sporting various fashions as a fashion language incorporating various fashion statements using a grammar of fashion. (Compare some of the work of [[Roland Barthes]].)\n\nIn recent years, Asian fashion has become increasingly significant in local and global markets. Countries such as China, Japan, India, and Pakistan have traditionally had large textile industries, which have often been drawn upon by Western designers, but now Asian clothing styles are also gaining influence based on their ideas.<ref>Lemire, B., & Riello, G (2008). \"East & West: Textiles and Fashion in Early Modern Europe\".

It was handmade for individuals, either as home production or on order from dressmakers and tailors. By the beginning of the 20th century\u2014with the rise of new technologies such as the [[sewing machine]], the rise of global capitalism and the development of the factory system of production, and the proliferation of retail outlets such as department stores\u2014clothing had increasingly come to be [[mass production|mass-produced]] in standard sizes and sold at fixed prices.\n\nAlthough the fashion industry developed first in Europe and America, {{as of | 2017 | lc = on}}, it is an international and highly globalized industry, with clothing often designed in one country, manufactured in another, and sold worldwide. For example, an American fashion company might source fabric in China and have the clothes manufactured in Vietnam, finished in Italy, and shipped to a warehouse in the United States for distribution to retail outlets internationally. The fashion industry has long been one of the largest employers in the United States,<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1706624/fashion-industry#toc296474</ref> and it remains so in the 21st century. However, U.S. employment declined considerably as production increasingly moved overseas, especially to China. Because data on the fashion industry typically are reported for national economies and expressed in terms of the industry's many separate sectors, aggregate figures for the world [[textile industry|production of textiles]] and [[Clothing industry|clothing]] are difficult to obtain. However, by any measure, the clothing industry accounts for a significant share of world economic output.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/cheap-clothes-2012-6/|title=How Bargain Fashion Chains Will Keep Themselves Cut-Rate -- New York Magazine|work=NYMag.com|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref>\nThe fashion industry consists of four levels:\n\n# The production of raw materials, principally Fiber ,and textiles but also leather and fur.\n#The production of fashion goods by designers, manufacturers, contractors, and others.\n# Retail sales.\n# Various forms of advertising and promotion.\n\nThese levels consist of many separate but interdependent sectors.

For example, First Lady [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]] was a fashionable icon of the early 1960s who led the formal dressing trend. By wearing a Chanel suit, a structural Givenchy shift dress ,or a soft color Cassini coat with Large buttons, it created her elegant look and led a delicate trend.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5J3PDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA52#v=onepage&q=First%20Lady%20Jacqueline%20Kennedy%20was%20a%20fashionable%20icon%20of%20the%20early%201960s|title=Women in Fashion|last=Rissman|first=Rebecca|date=2016-08-15|publisher=ABDO|isbn=9781680774856}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the political revolution also made much impact on the fashion trend. For example, during the 1960s, the economy had become wealthier, the divorce rate was increasing ,and the government approved the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]]. This revolution inspired the younger generation to rebellion. In 1964, the leg-baring mini-skirt became a significant  fashion trend of the 1960s. Given that fashion designers began to experiment with the shapes of garment, loose sleeveless, micro-minis, flared skirts, and trumpet sleeves. In this case, the mini-skirt trend became an icon of the 1960s.\n\nMoreover, the political movement built an impressive relationship with fashion trends. For instance, during the Vietnam war, the youth of America made a movement that affected the whole country. In the 1960s, the fashion trend was full of fluorescent colors, prints patterns, bell-bottom jeans, fringed vests, and skirt became a protest outfit of the 1960s. This trend was called Hippie , and it is still affecting the current fashion trend.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://classroom.synonym.com/political-economic-factors-influenced-fashion-1960s-12014.html|title=Political & Economic Factors That Influenced Fashion in the 1960s {{!}} The Classroom {{!}} Synonym|website=classroom.synonym.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref>\n\n=== Technology influences ===\n\nTechnology plays a significant role in most aspects of today's society. Technological influences are growing more apparent in the fashion industry. Advances and new developments are shaping and creating current and future trends.\n\nDevelopments such as wearable technology have become an essential trend in fashion.

The camouflage pattern in clothing was developed to help military personnel be less visible to enemy forces.  A trend emerged in the 1960s , and camouflage fabric was introduced to streetwear. The camouflage fabric trend disappeared and resurfaced several times since then. Camouflage started to appear in high fashion by the 1990s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bergfashionlibrary.com|title=Home : Berg Fashion Library|website=www.bergfashionlibrary.com|access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref> Designers such as Valentino, Dior , and Dolce & Gabbana combined camouflage into their runway and ready-to-wear collections.\n\n=== Social influences ===\n[[File:Britney Europe.jpg|thumb|upright|Celebrities such as [[Britney Spears]] have popularised the concept of wearing [[underwear as outerwear]].]]\n[[File:Gabriel Garko and Laura Torrisi - nicogenin - 66\u00e8me Festival de Venise (Mostra) - The Road (3).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Red carpet fashion]]: Italian actors [[Gabriel Garko]] and [[Laura Torrisi]] wearing designer [[formal wear]] at [[Venice Film Festival]], 2009]]\n\nFashion relates to social and cultural context of an environment. According to Matika,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sundaynews.co.zw/does-pop-culture-influence-fashion/|title=Does pop culture influence fashion?|website=www.sundaynews.co.zw|access-date=2016-03-07}}</ref> \"Elements of popular culture become fused when a person's trend is associated with a preference for a genre of music\u2026like music, news or literature, fashion has been fused into everyday lives.\" Fashion is not only seen as pure aesthetic values; fashion is also a medium for performers to create an overall atmosphere and express their opinions altogether through music video. The latest music video \u2018Formation\u2019 by Beyonc\u00e9, according to Carlos,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/13396069/beyonce-music-video-givenchy-gucci-miu-miu/|title=The Fashion in Beyonc\u00e9's New Video Is as Powerful as Its Politics|last=Carlos|first=Marjon|website=Vogue|access-date=2016-03-07}}</ref> \"The pop star pays homage to her Creole root.... tracing the roots of the Louisiana cultural nerve center from the post-abolition era to present day, Beyonc\u00e9 catalogs the evolution of the city's vibrant style and its tumultuous history all at once. Atop a New Orleans police car in a red-and-white Gucci high-collar dress and combat boots, she sits among the ruins of Hurricane Katrina, immediately implanting herself in the biggest national debate on police brutality and race relations in modern day.\"\n\nRunway show is a reflection of fashion trend and a designer's thought. For designer like Vivienne Westwood, runway shows are a platform for her voice on politics and current events. For her AW15 menswear show, according to Water,<ref name=\"Dazed\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/24335/1/vivienne-westwood-s-top-ten-political-moments|title=Vivienne Westwood's top ten political moments|last=Dazed|website=Dazed|access-date=2016-03-07}}</ref> \"where models with severely bruised faces channeled eco-warriors on a mission to save the planet.\" Another recent example is a staged feminist protest march for Chanel's SS15 show, rioting models chanting words of empowerment with signs like \"Feminist but feminine\" and \"Ladies first.\" According to Water,<ref name=\"Dazed\" /> \"The show tapped into Chanel's long history of championing female independence: founder Coco Chanel was a trailblazer for liberating the female body in the post-WWI era, introducing silhouettes that countered the restrictive corsets then in favour.\"\n\n=== Economic influences ===\n\n==== Circular economy ====\nWith increasing environmental awareness, the economic imperative to \"Spend now, think later\" is getting increasingly scrutinized.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Vaughn/Berelowitz|first=Jessica/Marian|date=2015|title=The circular economy|url=http://0-www.warc.com.library.scad.edu/Content/ContentViewer.aspx?MasterContentRef=4f8c0345-e2ef-48a2-ae79-b614a535a19d&q=economy+trend+fashion&CID=A105052&PUB=ATTICUS|journal=Warc|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> Today's consumer tends to be more mindful about consumption, looking for just enough and better, more durable options. People have also become more conscious of the impact their everyday consumption has on the environment and society, and these initiatives are often described as a move towards [[sustainable fashion]], yet critics argue a circular economy based on growth is an oxymoron, or an increasing spiral of consumption, rather than a utopian [[Cradle-to-cradle design|cradle-to-cradle]] circular solution.\n\nIn today's linear economical system, manufacturers extract resources from the earth to make products that will soon be discarded in landfills, on the other hand, under the [[Circular economy|circular]] model, the production of goods operates like systems in nature, where the waste and demise of a substance becomes the food and source of growth for something new. Companies such as MUD Jeans, which is based in the Netherlands employs a leasing scheme for jeans. This Dutch company \"represents a new consuming philosophy that is about using instead of owning,\" according to MUD's website. The concept also protects the company from volatile cotton prices. Consumers pay \u20ac7.50 a month for a pair of jeans; after a year, they can return the jeans to Mud,  trade them for a new pair and start another year-long lease, or keep them. MUD is responsible for any repairs during the lease period.<ref name=\":0\" /> Another ethical fashion company, [[Patagonia (clothing)|Patagonia]] set up the first multi-seller branded store on EBay in order to facilitate secondhand sales; consumers who take the Common Threads pledge can sell in this store and have their gear listed on Patagonia.com's \"Used Gear\" section.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== China's domestic spending ====\nConsumption as a share of gross domestic product in China has fallen for six decades, from 76 percent in 1952 to 28 percent in 2011. China plans to reduce [[tariff]]s on a number of consumer goods and expand its 72-hour transit visa plan to more cities in an effort to stimulate domestic consumption.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Ap|first=Tiffany|date=November 2015|title=China Makes Moves to Boost Consumption|url=http://0-wwd.com.library.scad.edu/retail-news/markets/china-consumption-beijing-import-tax-10286320/|journal=Women's Wear Daily|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe announcement of import tax reductions follows changes in June 2015, when the government cut the tariffs on clothing, cosmetics and various other goods by half. Among the changes \u2014 easier tax refunds for overseas shoppers and accelerated openings of more duty-free shops in cities covered by the 72-hour visa scheme. The 72-hour visa was introduced in Beijing and Shanghai in January 2013 and has been extended to 18 Chinese cities.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAccording to reports at the same time, Chinese consumer spending in other countries such as Japan has slowed even though the yen has dropped.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kaiser|first=Amanda|date=14 March 2016|title=Tokyo Fashion Week Starts in Challenging Economy|url=http://0-wwd.com.library.scad.edu/business-news/sourcing-global-markets/japan-fashion-week-fall-2016-10388614-10388614/|journal=Women's Wear Daily|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> There is clearly a trend in the next 5 years that the domestic fashion market will show an increase.\n\nChina is an interesting market for fashion retail as Chinese consumers' motivation to shop for fashion items are unique from Western Audiences.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=Christopher J.|last2=Wenyu|first2=Lu|date=2019-05-13|title=What influences Chinese fashion retail?

Chinese high-street shoppers prefer adventure and social shopping, while online shoppers are motived by idea shopping. Another difference is how gratification and idea shopping influence spending over \u00a51k per month on fashion items, and regular spending influenced by value shopping.\n\n=== Marketing ===\n[[File:Petite Panoply- Trip to Cumberland Island, Georgia (20775335400).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|A tourist couple wearing [[casual attire|casual]] clothes at [[Cumberland Island]], 2015]]\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=250\n| image1 = Chinese model posing as CEO (6759428801).jpg\n| image2 = LG\uc5d1\uc2a4\ub178\ud2b8 X300\u2019\uc758 CF \ub9e4\uc9c1(Magic)\ud3b8 (cropped).jpg\n| footer = Models posing in [[Informal attire|corporate office wear]].\n}}\n\n====Market research====\nConsumers of different groups have varying needs and demands. Factors taken into consideration when thinking of consumers' needs include key demographics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/consumer-needs-marketing-997.html|title=Consumer Needs & Marketing|website=smallbusiness.chron.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref>\nTo understand consumers' needs and predict fashion trends, fashion companies have to do [[market research]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://strategyn.com/customer-needs/|title=Strategyn|website=Strategyn|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref> There are two research methods: primary and secondary.<ref name=\"Consumer Research Methods\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.consumerpsychologist.com/cb_Research_Methods.html|title=Consumer Research Methods|website=www.consumerpsychologist.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref> Secondary methods are taking other information that has already been collected, for example using a book or an article for research. Primary research is collecting data through surveys, interviews, observation, and/or focus groups. Primary research often focuses on large sample sizes to determine customer's motivations to shop.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=Christopher J.|last2=Wenyu|first2=Lu|date=2019-05-13|title=What influences Chinese fashion retail? Shopping motivations, demographics and spending|url=https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JFMM-09-2017-0093/full/html|journal=Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management: An International Journal|language=en|volume=23|issue=2|pages=158\u2013175|doi=10.1108/JFMM-09-2017-0093|issn=1361-2026}}</ref>\n\nBenefits of primary research is specific information about a fashion brand's consumer is explored. Surveys are helpful tools; questions can be open-ended or closed-ended. A negative factor surveys and interviews present is that the answers can be biased, due to wording in the survey or on face-to-face interactions.  Focus groups, about 8 to 12 people, can be beneficial because several points can be addressed in depth. However, there are drawbacks to this tactic, too. With such a small sample size, it is hard to know if the greater public would react the same way as the focus group.<ref name=\"Consumer Research Methods\"/> Observation can really help a company gain insight on what a consumer truly wants. There is less of a bias because consumers are just performing their daily tasks, not necessarily realizing they are being observed. For example, observing the public by taking street style photos of people, the consumer did not get dressed in the morning knowing that would have their photo taken necessarily. They just wear what they would normally wear. Through observation patterns can be seen, helping trend forecasters know what their target market needs and wants.\n\nKnowing the needs of the consumers will increase a fashion companies' sales and profits. Through research and studying the consumers' lives the needs of the customer can be obtained and help fashion brands know what trends the consumers are ready for.\n\n====Symbolic consumption====\nConsumption is driven not only by need, the symbolic meaning for consumers is also a factor. Consumers engaging in symbolic consumption may develop a sense of self over an extended period of time as various objects are collected as part of the process of establishing their identity and, when the symbolic meaning is shared in a social group, to communicate their identity to others. For teenagers consumption plays a role in distinguishing the child self from the adult. Researchers have found that the fashion choices of teenagers are used for self-expression and also to recognize other teens who wear similar clothes. The symbolic association of clothing items can link individuals personality and interests, with music as a prominent factor influencing fashion decisions.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Piacentini |first1=Maria |title=Symbolic consumption in teenagers' clothing choices |journal=Journal of Consumer Behavior |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=251-262}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n[[File:Tanzturnier 28.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Latin dance]]rs in their [[costume]]s. The woman is wearing [[backless dress]] with deep slits on its lower portion, while the man is wearing a shirt with top buttons open.]]\n\nThe media plays a significant role when it comes to fashion. For instance, an important part of fashion is [[fashion journalism]]. Editorial critique, guidelines, and commentary can be found on television and in magazines, newspapers, fashion websites, social networks, and [[fashion blog]]s. In recent years, fashion blogging and [[YouTube]] videos have become a major outlet for spreading trends and fashion tips, creating an online culture of sharing one's style on a website or Instagram account. Through these media outlets readers and viewers all over the world can learn about fashion, making it very accessible.<ref>Fashion (2012, March 29). Wwd. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news</ref> In addition to fashion journalism, another media platform that is important in fashion industry is advertisement. Advertisements provide information to audiences and promote the sales of products and services. Fashion industry utilizes advertisements to attract consumers and promote its products to generate sales. Few decades ago when technology was still underdeveloped, advertisements heavily relied on radio, magazines, billboards, and newspapers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://smallbusiness.chron.com/examples-traditional-advertising-24312.html|title=Examples of Traditional Advertising|last=Lauren|first=Lynn|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> These days, there are more various ways in advertisements such as television ads, online-based ads using internet websites, and posts, videos, and live streaming in social media platforms.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, fashion magazines began to include photographs of various fashion designs and became even more influential than in the past.<ref>{{Citation|publisher=Fairchild Publications|isbn=9781501303869|doi=10.5040/9781501303869.ch-014|title = Marketing Fashion|year = 2012|chapter = Fashion Advertising, Sales Promotion, and Public Relations}}</ref> In cities throughout the world these magazines were greatly sought after and had a profound effect on public taste in clothing. Talented illustrators drew exquisite fashion plates for the publications which covered the most recent developments in fashion and beauty. Perhaps the most famous of these magazines was ''[[La Gazette du Bon Ton]]'', which was founded in 1912 by Lucien Vogel and regularly published until 1925 (with the exception of the war years).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abebooks.com/books/features/lithographs/gazette-du-bon-ton.shtml|title=Gazette du Bon Ton: A Journal of Good Taste|website=www.abebooks.com|access-date=2018-07-04}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Crystal Couture Fashion Show & Sale (32801142162).jpg|thumb|upright|A [[See-through clothing|see-through]] top worn along with [[pasties]] by a model at a [[fashion show]] in USA, 2017. Such [[fashion trend]]s get popularised through media.]]\n''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', founded in the United States in 1892, has been the longest-lasting and most successful of the hundreds of fashion magazines that have come and gone. Increasing affluence after [[World War&nbsp;II]] and, most importantly, the advent of cheap color printing in the 1960s, led to a huge boost in its sales and heavy coverage of fashion in mainstream women's magazines, followed by men's magazines in the 1990s. One such example of ''Vogue'''s popularity is the younger version, ''[[Teen Vogue]]'', which covers clothing and trends that are targeted more toward the \"fashionista on a budget\". [[Haute couture]] designers followed the trend by starting [[ready-to-wear]] and [[perfume]] lines which are heavily advertised in the magazines and now dwarf their original couture businesses. A recent development within fashion print media is the rise of text-based and critical magazines which aim to prove that fashion is not superficial, by creating a dialogue between fashion academia and the industry. Examples of this trend are: ''[[Fashion Theory (journal)|Fashion Theory]]'' (1997)  and ''[[Vestoj]]'' (2009). Television coverage began in the 1950s with small fashion features. In the 1960s and 1970s, fashion segments on various entertainment shows became more frequent, and by the 1980s, dedicated fashion shows such as ''[[Fashion Television]]'' started to appear. ''[[FashionTV]]'' was the pioneer in this undertaking and has since grown to become the leader in both Fashion Television and new media channels. The Fashion Industry is beginning to promote their styles through Bloggers on social media's. Vogue specified Chiara Ferragni as \"blogger of the moment\" due to the rises of followers through her Fashion Blog, that became popular.<ref>Fateh, Azhar. \u201cHow Social Media Is Changing Fashion?\u201d The Huffington Post, TheHuffingtonPost.com, 19 Jan. 2017, Retrieved From www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-social-media-is-changing-fashion_us_587edd29e4b06a0baf64918f.</ref>\n\nA few days after the 2010 Fall Fashion Week in New York City came to a close, ''[[The New Islander]]'''s Fashion Editor, Genevieve Tax, criticized the fashion industry for running on a seasonal schedule of its own, largely at the expense of real-world consumers. \"Because designers release their fall collections in the spring and their spring collections in the fall, fashion magazines such as ''Vogue'' always and only look forward to the upcoming season, promoting parkas come September while issuing reviews on shorts in January\", she writes. \"Savvy shoppers, consequently, have been conditioned to be extremely, perhaps impractically, farsighted with their buying.\"<ref>Tax, Genevieve.

Specific fashion brands have been featured in film, not only as [[product placement]] opportunities, but as bespoke items that have subsequently led to trends in fashion.<ref>Thompson, S.B.N., Hussein, Y., Jones, N.

This is evident not only from television shows directly spotlighting the fashion industry, but also movies, events and music videos which showcase fashion statements as well as promote specific brands through product placements.\n\n=== Controversial advertisements in fashion industry ===\n\n==== Racism in fashion advertisements ====\nThere are some fashion advertisements that were accused of racism and led to boycotts from the customers. Globally known, Swedish fashion brand H&M faced this issue with one of its children's wear advertisements in 2018. A black child wearing a hoodie with a slogan written as \"coolest monkey in the jungle\" right at the center was featured in the ad. When it was released, it immediate became controversial and even led to boycott. A lot of people including celebrities posted on social media about their resentments towards H&M and refusal to work with and buy its products. H&M issued a statement saying \"we apologise to anyone this may have offended\", which seemed insincere to some.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/hm-hoodie-racist-boycott-advertising-people-h-m-a8149246.html|title=People are boycotting H&M over 'racist' hoodie|date=2018-01-09|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> \nAnother fashion advertisement regarding racism is from GAP, American worldwide clothing brand. GAP collaborated with Ellen DeGeneres in 2016 for the advertisement. It features playful, four young girls where tall white girl is leaning with her arm on a shorter black girl's head. When this ad was released, some viewers harshly criticized that it underlies passive racism. A representative from The Root, black culture magazine commented on the ad that it portrays the message that the black people are undervalued and seen like props for white people to look better.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-35968787|title=Is this Gap advert racist?|date=2016-04-06|access-date=2019-10-29|language=en-GB}}</ref> There were different points of views on this issue, some saying that people are being too sensitive, and some getting offended.

British high fashion brand, Jimmy Choo, was blamed for having sexism in its ad which featured a female British mode wearing the brand's boots. In this two-minute ad, men whistle at a model, walking on the street with red, sleeveless mini dress. This ad gained lots of backlashes and criticism by the viewers since sexual harassment and misconduct was a huge issue during this time and even till now. Many people showed their dismay through social media posts, leading Jimmy Choo to pull down the ad from social media platforms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mashable.com/2017/12/22/jimmy-choo-cara-delevingne-catcall-ad/|title=Jimmy Choo pulls Cara Delevingne ad after online backlash|last=Gallucci|first=Nicole|website=Mashable|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref>\n\nFrench luxury fashion brand Yves Saint Laurent also faced this issue with its print ad shown in Paris in 2017. A female model is wearing a fishnet tights with roller-skate stilettos, almost lying down with her legs opened in front of the camera. This advertisement brought harsh comments from the viewers and French advertising organization directors for going against the advertising codes related to \"respect for decency, dignity and those prohibiting submission, violence or dependence, as well as the use of stereotypes.\" They even said that this ad is causing \"mental harm to adolescents.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://adage.com/article/advertising/degrading-yves-saint-laurent-ads-shock-french-public/308196|title='Misogynist' YSL Ads Shock Parisians Ahead of International Women's Day|date=2017-03-07|website=adage.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> Lot of sarcastic comments were made in social media about the ad and the poster was removed from the city.\n\n==Public relations and social media==\n[[File:Ines Sainz.jpg|thumb|upright|A Mexican sports reporter wearing [[little black dress]] and knee-high boots]]\n\nFashion [[public relations]] involves being in touch with a company's audiences and creating strong relationships with them, reaching out to media and initiating messages that project positive images of the company.<ref>Sherman, G., & Perlman, S.

A certain way is chosen and that becomes the fashion as defined by a certain people as a whole, so if a particular style has a meaning in an already occurring set of beliefs that style will become fashion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia): Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=39\u201355 [42]}}</ref> According to Ted Polhemus and Lynn Procter, fashion can be described as adornment, of which there are two types: fashion and anti-fashion. Through the capitalization and commoditisation of clothing, accessories, and shoes, etc., what once constituted anti-fashion becomes part of fashion as the lines between fashion and anti-fashion are blurred.<ref>{{cite book|last=Polhemus and Procter|first=Ted and Lynn|title=Fashion and Anti-fashion: An Anthropology of Clothing and Adornment|year=1978|publisher=Thames and Hudson|page=12}}</ref>\n\nThe definition of fashion and [[anti-fashion]] is as follows:  Anti-fashion is fixed and changes little over time.  Anti-fashion is different depending on the cultural or social group one is associated with or where one lives, but within that group or locality the style changes little.  Fashion is the exact opposite of anti-fashion.  Fashion changes very quickly and is not affiliated with one group or area of the world but is spread out throughout the world wherever people can communicate easily with each other. For example, Queen Elizabeth II's 1953 coronation gown is an example of anti-fashion because it is traditional and does not change over any period whereas a gown from fashion designer Dior's collection of 1953 is fashion because the style will change every season as Dior comes up with a new gown to replace the old one. In the Dior gown the length, cut, fabric, and embroidery of the gown change from season to season.  Anti-fashion is concerned with maintaining the status quo while fashion is concerned with social mobility. Time is expressed in terms of continuity in anti-fashion and as change in fashion. Fashion has changing modes of adornment while anti-fashion has fixed modes of adornment. Indigenous and peasant modes of adornment are an example of anti-fashion. Change in fashion is part of the larger system and is structured to be a deliberate change in style.<ref>{{cite book|last=Polhemus and Procter|first=Ted and Lynn|title=Fashion and Anti-fashion: An Anthropology of Clothing and Adornment|year=1978|publisher=Thames and Hudson|pages=12\u201313}}</ref>\n\nToday, people in rich countries are linked to people in poor countries through the commoditization and consumption of what is called fashion.  People work long hours in one area of the globe to produce things that people in another part of the globe are anxious to consume. An example of this is the chain of production and consumption of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] shoes, which are produced in Taiwan and then purchased in North America. At the production end, there is nation-building a hard working ideology that leads people to produce and entices people to consume with a vast amount of goods for the offering{{clarify|date=June 2015}}. Commodities are no longer just utilitarian but are fashionable, be they running shoes or sweat suits.<ref>{{cite book|last=Skoggard|first=Ian|title=Transnational Commodity Flows and the Global Phenomenon of the Brand|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=57\u201369}}</ref>\n\nThe change from anti-fashion to fashion because of the influence of western consumer-driven civilization can be seen in eastern Indonesia. The ikat textiles of the Ngada area of eastern Indonesia are changing because of modernization and development. Traditionally, in the Ngada area there was no idea similar to that of the Western idea of fashion, but anti-fashion in the form of traditional textiles and ways to adorn oneself were widely popular. Textiles in Indonesia have played many roles for the local people.  Textiles defined a person's rank and status; certain textiles indicated being part of the ruling class.  People expressed their ethnic identity and social hierarchy through textiles.  Because some Indonesians bartered ikat textiles for food, the textiles constituted economic goods, and as some textile design motifs had spiritual religious meanings, textiles were also a way to communicate religious messages.<ref>{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia): Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|pages=39\u201343}}</ref>\n\nIn eastern Indonesia, both the production and use of traditional textiles have been transformed as the production, use and value associated with textiles have changed due to modernization.  In the past, women produced the textiles either for home consumption or to trade with others.  Today, this has changed as most textiles are not being produced at home. Western goods are considered modern and are valued more than traditional goods, including the sarong, which retain a lingering association with [[colonialism]].  Now, sarongs are used only for rituals and ceremonial occasions, whereas western clothes are worn to church or government offices. Civil servants working in urban areas are more likely than peasants to make the distinction between western and traditional clothes. Following Indonesia's independence from the Dutch, people increasingly started buying factory made shirts and sarongs. In textile-producing areas the growing of cotton and production of naturally colored thread became obsolete. Traditional motifs on textiles are no longer considered the property of a certain social class or age group. Wives of government officials are promoting the use of traditional textiles in the form of western garments such as skirts, vests and blouses.  This trend is also being followed by the general populace, and whoever can afford to hire a tailor is doing so to stitch traditional ikat textiles into western clothes. Thus, traditional textiles are now fashion goods and are no longer confined to the black, white and brown colour palette but come in array of colours. Traditional textiles are also being used in interior decorations and to make handbags, wallets and other accessories, which are considered fashionable by civil servants and their families. There is also a booming tourist trade in the eastern Indonesian city of Kupang where international as well as domestic tourists are eager to purchase traditionally printed western goods.<ref>{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia): Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnational Body|page=41 and 45\u201348}}</ref>\n\nThe use of traditional textiles for fashion is becoming big business in eastern Indonesia, but these traditional textiles are losing their ethnic identity markers and are being used as an item of fashion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Molnar|first=Andrea K|title=Transformations in the Use of Traditional Textiles of Ngada (Western Flores, Eastern Indonesia): Commercialization, Fashion and Ethnicity|year=1998|publisher=Berg|location=Consuming Fashion: Adorning the Transnationa}}</ref>\n\n==Intellectual property==\nIn the fashion industry, [[intellectual property]] is not enforced as it is within the [[film industry]] and [[music industry]]. Robert Glariston, an intellectual property expert, mentioned in a fashion seminar held in LA{{which|date=March 2014}} that \"Copyright law regarding clothing is a current hot-button issue in the industry. We often have to draw the line between designers being inspired by a design and those outright stealing it in different places.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://outspoken.wpshower.com/2013/06/design-details-by-larger-companies-is-what-often/|title=Design details by larger companies is what often {{!}} Outspoken|website=outspoken.wpshower.com|access-date=2018-08-16}}</ref>  To take inspiration from others' designs contributes to the fashion industry's ability to establish clothing trends. For the past few years, [[WGSN (fashion forecaster)|WGSN]] has been a dominant source of fashion news and forecasts in encouraging fashion brands worldwide to be inspired by one another. Enticing consumers to buy clothing by establishing new trends is, some have argued, a key component of the industry's success. Intellectual property rules that interfere with this process of trend-making would, in this view, be counter-productive. On the other hand, it is often argued that the blatant theft of new ideas, unique designs, and design details by larger companies is what often contributes to the failure of many smaller or independent design companies.\n\nSince fakes are distinguishable by their poorer quality, there is still a demand for luxury goods, and as only a trademark or logo can be copyrighted, many fashion brands make this one of the most visible aspects of the garment or accessory. In handbags, especially, the designer's brand may be woven into the fabric (or the lining fabric) from which the bag is made, making the brand an intrinsic element of the bag.\n\nIn 2005, the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) held a conference calling for stricter intellectual property enforcement within the fashion industry to better protect small and medium businesses and promote competitiveness within the textile and clothing industries.<ref>[http://www.ipfrontline.com/depts/article.asp?id=7678&deptid=8 IPFrontline.com]

African-American influencers often have been known to start trends though modern day social media, and even in past years they have been able to reach others with their fashion and style.\n\n=== Modern Day Fashion ===\nCelebrities like [[Rihanna]], [[Lupita Nyong'o]], [[Zendaya]], and [[Michelle Obama]] have been a few of the many fashion idols in the black female community. For men, [[Pharrell Williams]], [[Kanye West]], and [[Ice Cube]] have also helped define modern day fashion for black men. Today's fashion scene is not just clothes, but also hair and makeup. Recent trends have included the embracing of natural hair, traditional clothing worn with modern clothing, or traditional patterns used in modern clothing styles. All of these trends come with the long existing and persevering movement of \"Black is Beautiful\".\n\n=== Early American Fashion ===\nIn the mid to end of the 1900s, African American style changed and developed with the times. Around the 1950s is really when the black community was able to create their own distinct styles. The term \"Sunday attire\" was coined,  communities emphasized \"Correct\" dress, it was especially important when \"stepping out\" for social occasions with community members, a habit that continues in the early 2000s.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/fashion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/african-american-dress|title=African American Dress {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref> Hair-dos and hairstyles also became a fashion statement, for example the \"conk\" which is hair that is slightly flattened and waved.<ref name=\":2\" /> Afros also emerged and they were often used to symbolize the rejection of white beauty standards at the time.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-illustrative-identity_n_6519244|title=An Illustrative Identity of Fashion and Style Throughout African-American History and Movements|date=2015-02-10|website=HuffPost|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref> Around the 1970s is when flashy costumes began to appear and black artists really started to define their presences through fashion. Around this time is also when movements started using fashion as one of their outlets.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Movements using Fashion ===\n\n==== Civil Rights Movement ====\nBlack activists and supporters used fashion to express their solidarity and support of this  civil rights movement. Supporters adorned symbolic clothing, accessories and hairstyles, usually native to Africa. Politics and fashion were fused together during this time and the use of these symbolic fashion statements sent a message to America and the rest of the world that African Americans were proud of their heritage.<ref name=\":3\" /> They aimed to send an even stronger message that black is beautiful and they were not afraid to embrace their identities.<ref name=\":3\" /> An example would the [[Kente cloth]], it is a brightly colored strip of cloth that is stitched and woven together to create different accessories.<ref name=\":3\" /> This woven cloth of brightly colored strips of fabric became a strong symbolic representation of pride in African identity for African Americans of the 1960s and later.

Its train services are transitioning from a peak direction commuter railway to a [[GO Transit Regional Express Rail|Regional Express Network]].]]\n\nMost commuter (or suburban) trains are built to main line rail standards,{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} differing from [[light rail]] or [[rapid transit]] (metro rail)  systems by:\n*being larger\n*providing more seating and less standing room, owing to the longer distances involved\n*having (in most cases) a lower frequency of service\n*having scheduled services (i.e. trains run at specific times rather than at specific intervals)\n*serving lower-density suburban areas, typically connecting [[suburb]]s to the city center\n*sharing track or [[Right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] with intercity or [[freight]] trains\n*not fully grade separated (containing at-grade crossings with crossing gates)\n*being able to skip certain stations as an express service due to normally being driver controlled\n\n===Train schedule===\nCompared to [[rapid transit]] (or metro rail), commuter/suburban rail often has lower [[headway|frequency]], following a schedule rather than fixed intervals, and fewer stations spaced further apart. They primarily serve lower density suburban areas (non inner-city), and often share [[right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] with intercity or [[freight]] trains. Some services operate only during peak hours and others uses fewer departures during off peak hours and weekends. Average speeds are high, often 50&nbsp;km/h (30&nbsp;mph) or higher. These higher speeds better serve the longer distances involved. Some services include express services which skip some stations in order to run faster and separate longer distance riders from short-distance ones.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe general range of commuter trains' distance varies between 15 and 200&nbsp;km (10 and 125 miles).{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Sometimes long distances can be explained by that the train runs between two or several cities (e.g. S-Bahn in the [[Ruhr]] area of Germany). Distances between stations may vary, but are usually much longer than those of urban rail systems. In city centers the train either has a terminal station or passes through the city centre with notably fewer station stops than those of urban rail systems. Toilets are often available on-board trains and in stations.\n\n===Track===\nTheir ability to coexist with freight or intercity services in the same [[Right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] can drastically reduce system construction costs. However, frequently they are built with dedicated tracks within that right-of-way to prevent delays, especially where service densities have converged in the inner parts of the network.\n\nMost such trains run on the [[List of track gauges|local standard gauge]] track. Some systems may run on a narrower or broader gauge. Examples of [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] systems are found in Japan, [[Kereta Commuter Indonesia|Indonesia]], [[KTM Komuter|Malaysia]], [[Greater Bangkok Commuter rail|Thailand]], Switzerland, in the [[Brisbane]] ([[Queensland Rail]]'s [[Queensland Rail City network|City network]]) and [[Perth]] ([[Transperth]]) systems in Australia, in some systems in Sweden, and on the [[:it:Ferrovia Genova-Casella|Genoa-Casella line]] in Italy. Some countries and regions, including [[Helsinki commuter rail|Finland]], India, Pakistan, [[Elektrichka|Russia]], Brazil and Sri Lanka, as well as [[San Francisco]] ([[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]]) in the US and [[Metro Trains Melbourne|Melbourne]] and [[Adelaide Metro|Adelaide]] in Australia, use [[broad gauge]] track.\n\n===Distinction between other modes of rail===\n\n====Metro====\nMetro rail or [[rapid transit]] usually covers a smaller inner-urban area ranging outwards to between 12&nbsp;km to 20&nbsp;km (or 8 to 14 miles), has a higher train frequency and runs on separate tracks (underground or elevated), whereas commuter rail often shares tracks, technology and the legal framework within mainline railway systems.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nHowever, the classification as a metro or rapid rail can be difficult as both may typically cover a metropolitan area exclusively, run on separate tracks in the centre, and often feature purpose-built rolling stock. The fact that the terminology is not standardised across countries (even across English-speaking countries) further complicates matters. This distinction is most easily made when there are two (or more) systems such as New York's [[New York City Subway|subway]] and the [[Long Island Rail Road|LIRR]] and [[Metro-North Railroad]], Paris' [[Paris M\u00e9tro|M\u00e9tro]] and [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] along with [[Transilien]], London's tube lines of the [[London Underground|Underground]] and the [[London Overground|Overground]], (future) [[Crossrail]], [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]] along with other commuter rail [[Transport in London#Heavy rail|operators]], Madrid's [[Madrid Metro|Metro]] and [[Cercan\u00edas Madrid|Cercan\u00edas]], Barcelona's [[Barcelona Metro|Metro]] and [[Rodalies de Catalunya|Rodalies]], and Tokyo's [[Tokyo subway|subway]] and the [[East Japan Railway Company#Greater Tokyo Area|JR lines]] along with various privately owned and operated commuter rail systems.\n\n====S-Trains====\n\nAn [[S-Train]] is a type of hybrid [[urban rail|urban]]-[[suburban rail]] serving a [[metropolitan region]]. The most well-known S-train systems are the S-Bahn systems in Germany and Austria. Other well-known examples of S-train systems include the [[Copenhagen S-train|S-tog]] in [[Copenhagen]] and S-Bahn/RER systems in [[Switzerland]]. In Germany, the [[S-Bahn]] is regarded as a train category of its own, and exists in many large cities and in some other areas, with differing service and technical standards from city to city. \nMost S-Bahns typically behave like commuter rail with most trackage not separated from other trains, and long lines with trains running between cities and suburbs rather than within a city. The distances between stations however, are usually short. In larger systems there is usually a high frequency metro-like central corridor in the city center where all the lines converge into. Typical examples of large city S-Bahns include Munich and Frankfurt. S-Bahns also exist in some mid-size cities like Rostock and Magdeburg but behave more like typical commuter rail with lower frequencies and very little exclusive trackage. In [[Berlin]], the [[Berlin S-Bahn|S-Bahn systems]] arguably fulfill all considerations of a true metro system (despite the existence of [[U-Bahn]]s as well) \u2013 the trains run on tracks that are entirely separated from other trains, short distances between stations, high frequency and uses tunnels but do run a bit further out from the city centre, compared with U-Bahn. In Hamburg and Copenhagen, other, diesel driven trains, do continue where the S-Bahn ends (\"[[AKN Eisenbahn|A-Bahn]]\" in Hamburg area, and \"L-tog\" in Copenhagen).{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n====Regional rail====\n[[Regional rail]] usually provides [[rail transport|rail services]] between towns and cities, rather than purely linking major population hubs in the way [[inter-city rail]] does. Regional rail operates outside major cities. Unlike Inter-city, it stops at most or all stations between cities. It provides a service between smaller communities along the line, and also connections with long-distance services at interchange stations located at junctions or at larger towns along the line. Alternative names are \"local train\" or \"stopping train\". Examples include the former [[British Rail|BR]]'s [[Regional Railways]], France's [[Transport express r\u00e9gional|TER]] (''Transport express r\u00e9gional''), Germany's [[DB Regio]] and South Korea's [[Tonggeun]] services.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nRegional rail does not exist in this sense in the United States, so the term \"regional rail\" has become synonymous with commuter rail there, although the two are more clearly defined in Europe.\n\n====Inter-city rail====\n{{see also|Inter-city rail}}\n[[File:Sydney Trains H22 OSCAR.jpg|thumb|A [[NSW TrainLink]] [[NSW TrainLink H set|H set]] at Sydney's [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central station]].]]\nIn some European countries the distinction between commuter trains and long-distance/intercity trains is very hard to make, because of the relatively short distances involved. For example, so-called \"[[Inter-city rail|intercity]]\" trains in Belgium and the Netherlands carry many commuters and their equipment, range and speeds are similar to those of commuter trains in some larger countries. In the United Kingdom there is no real division of organisation and brand name between commuter, regional and inter-city trains, making it hard to categorize train connections.\n\n[[Elektrichka|Russian commuter trains]], on the other hand, frequently cover areas larger than Belgium itself, although these are still short distances by Russian standards. They have a different ticketing system from long-distance trains, and in major cities they often operate from a separate section of the train station.\n\nThe easiest way to identify these \"inter-city\" services is that they tend to operate as express services - only linking the main stations in the cities they link, not stopping at any other stations. However, this term is used in Australia (Sydney for example) to describe the regional trains operating beyond the boundaries of the suburban services, even though some of these \"inter-city\" services stop all stations similar to German regional services. In this regard, the German service delineations and corresponding naming conventions are clearer and better used for academic purposes.\n\n====High-speed rail====\nSometimes [[high-speed rail]] can serve daily use of commuters. The Japanese [[Shinkansen]] high speed rail system is heavily used by commuters in the [[Greater Tokyo Area]]. They commute between 100 and 200&nbsp;km by [[Shinkansen]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/fact-sheet-high-speed-rail-development-worldwide|title=Fact Sheet: High Speed Rail Development Worldwide {{!}} White Papers {{!}} EESI|website=www.eesi.org|access-date=2019-12-04}}</ref> To meet the demand of commuters, [[Japan Railways Group|JR]] sells commuter discount passes and operates 16-car [[bilevel car|bilevel]] [[E4 Series Shinkansen]] trains at rush hour, providing a capacity of 1,600 seats. Several lines in China, such as the [[Beijing\u2013Tianjin Intercity Railway]] and the [[Shanghai\u2013Nanjing High-Speed Railway]], serve a similar role with many more under construction or planned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shine.cn/news/metro/1806116099/|title=Metro closes the gap with areas across the border - SHINE|website=SHINE|language=en|access-date=2018-06-23}}</ref>\n\nThe high-speed services linking [[Z\u00fcrich]], [[Bern]] and [[Basel]] in [[Switzerland]] ({{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}}) have brought the Central Business Districts (CBDs) of these three cities within 1 hour of each other. This has resulted in unexpectedly high demand for new commuter trips between the three cities and a corresponding increase in suburban rail passengers accessing the high-speed services at the main city-centre stations (or Hauptbahnhof). The [[Regional-Express]] commuter service between [[Munich]] and [[Nuremberg]] in Germany go in ({{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}}) along a [[Nuremberg\u2013Munich high-speed railway|300 km/h high-speed line]].\n\nThe regional trains [[Stockholm]]\u2013[[Uppsala]], Stockholm\u2013[[V\u00e4ster\u00e5s]], Stockholm\u2013[[Eskilstuna]] and [[Gothenburg]]\u2013[[Trollh\u00e4ttan]] in [[Sweden]] reach {{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}} and have many daily commuters.\n\n==Train types==\nCommuter/suburban trains are usually optimized for maximum passenger volume, in most cases without sacrificing too much comfort and [[luggage]] space, though they seldom have all the amenities of long-distance trains. Cars may be single- or [[bilevel car|double-level]], and aim to provide seating for all. Compared to intercity trains, they have less space, fewer amenities and limited baggage areas.\n\n===Multiple unit type===\n\nCommuter rail trains are usually composed of [[multiple unit]]s, which are self-propelled, bidirectional, articulated passenger rail cars with driving motors on each (or every other) [[bogie]]. Depending on local circumstances and tradition they may be powered either by [[diesel engines]] located below the passenger compartment ([[diesel multiple unit]]s) or by electricity picked up from [[third rail]]s or [[overhead lines]] ([[electric multiple unit]]s). Multiple units are almost invariably equipped with control cabs at both ends, which is why such units are so frequently used to provide commuter services, due to the associated short turn-around time.\n\n===Locomotive hauled services===\n[[File:ACE EMD F40PH Fremont - San Jose.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Altamont Corridor Express]] train operating along the [[San Francisco Bay]]; a MPI F40PH-2C locomotive hauls a consist of Bombardier Bi-Level VI coaches.]]\nLocomotive hauled services are used in some countries or locations. This is often a case of [[Business operations|asset sweating]], by using a single large combined fleet for intercity and regional services. Loco hauled services are usually run in [[Push-pull train|push-pull]] formation, that is, the train can run with the locomotive at the \"front\" or \"rear\" of the train (pushing or pulling). Trains are often equipped with a control cab at the other end of the train from the locomotive, allowing the train operator to operate the train from either end. The motive power for locomotive-hauled commuter trains may be either electric or [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]], although some countries, such as Germany and some of the former Soviet-bloc countries, also use diesel-hydraulic locomotives.\n\n=== Seat plans ===\nIn the US and some other countries, a three-and-two seat plan is used. However, few people sit in the middle seat on these trains because they feel crowded and uncomfortable.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/31/nyregion/for-train-riders-middle-seat-isnt-the-center-of-attention.html|title=For Train Riders, Middle Seat Isn't the Center of Attention|first=Patrick|last=McGeehan|date=31 May 2005|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/06/opinion/on-the-802-express-threes-a-crowd-139947.html|title=On the 8:02 Express, Three's a Crowd|date=6 June 2005|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\nIn Japan and South Korea, longitudinal (sideways window-lining) seating is widely used in many commuter rail trains to increase capacity in rush hours. Carriages are usually not organized to increase [[seating capacity]] (although in some trains at least one carriage would feature more doors to facilitate easier boarding and alighting and bench seats so that they can be folded up during rush hour to provide more standing room) even in the case of commuting longer than 50&nbsp;km and commuters in the [[Greater Tokyo Area]] and the [[Seoul metropolitan area]] have to stand in the train for more than an hour.\n\n==Commuter rail systems around the world==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2009}}\n\n===Africa===\n{{See also|Template:Suburban railways in Africa}}\n[[File:Kalk Bay Station 3.jpg|thumb|A [[Metrorail (South Africa)|Metrorail]] train pulling out of [[Kalk Bay]] station in [[Cape Town]]]]\nCurrently there are not many examples of commuter rail in Africa. [[Metrorail (South Africa)|Metrorail]] operates in the major cities of South Africa, and there are some commuter rail services in Algeria, Botswana, Kenya, Morocco, Egypt and Tunisia.\nIn Algeria, [[SNTF]] operates commuter rail lines between the capital [[Algiers]] and its southern and eastern suburbs. They also serve to connect [[Algiers]]' main [[University of Science and Technology, Houari Boumediene|universities]] to each other. The [[Dar es Salaam commuter rail]] offers intracity services in [[Dar es Salaam]], Tanzania. In Botswana, the ([[Botswana Railways]]) \"BR Express\" has a commuter train between [[Lobatse]] and [[Gaborone]].\n\n===Asia===\n\n====East Asia====\n[[File:Tokyo Metro 16000 Series 16111f Semi Express.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Tokyo Metro 16000 series]] train operating a through service on the [[JR East]] [[Joban Line]], an example of high-density commuter rail in Japan.]]\n\nIn Japan, commuter rail systems have extensive network and frequent service and are heavily used. In many cases, Japanese commuter rail is operationally more like a typical metro system (with very high operating frequencies, an emphasis on [[standing passenger]]s, short station spacing) than it is like commuter rail in other countries. Japanese commuter rail also tends to be heavily interlined with subway lines, with commuter rail trains continuing into the subway network, and then out onto different commuter rail systems on the other side of the city.  Many Japanese commuter systems operate several levels of express trains to reduce the travel time to distant locations, often using station bypass tracks instead of dedicated express tracks. It is notable that the larger Japanese commuter rail systems are owned and operated by for-profit [[private railway]] companies, without public subsidy.\n\nCommuter rail systems have been inaugurated in several cities in China such as [[Beijing Suburban Railway|Beijing]], [[Jinshan Railway|Shanghai]], [[Central Plain Metropolitan Intercity Rail|Zhengzhou]], [[Wuhan Metropolitan Area Intercity Railway|Wuhan]], [[Changsha\u2013Zhuzhou\u2013Xiangtan Intercity Railway|Changsha]] and the [[Pearl River Delta Rapid Transit|Pearl River Delta]]. With plans for large systems in northeastern [[Zhejiang]], [[Jingjinji]], and [[Yangtze River Delta]] areas. The level of service varies considerably from line to line ranging [[high speed rail|high]] to near high speeds. More developed and established lines such as the [[Guangzhou\u2013Shenzhen Railway|Guangshen Railway]] have more frequent metro like service. Hong Kong [[MTR]]'s [[East Rail Line]], [[West Rail Line]] and [[Tung Chung Line]] were built to commuter rail standards but are operated as a metro system.\n\nIn Taiwan, [[West Coast line (Taiwan)|Western Line]] in [[Taipei]]-[[Taoyuan City|Taoyuan]] Metropolitan Area, [[Taichung]] Metropolitan Area, [[Tainan]]-[[Kaohsiung]] Metropolitan Area as well as [[Neiwan Line|Neiwan]]-[[Liujia Line]] in [[Hsinchu]] Area is considered commuter rail.\n\nOther examples in East Asia include [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway]] of which some lines are suburban lines operated by [[Korail]] in South Korea.\n\n====Southeast Asia====\n[[File:Commuterline at Palmerah Station 4.JPG|thumb|right|Electric multiple unit of [[KA Commuter Jabodetabek|KRL Commuterline]] [[KA Commuter Line Tanah Abang-Maja|Serpong Line]] train at Palmerah Station, [[Jakarta]]]]\n\nIn [[Indonesia]], the [[KRL Commuterline]] is the largest commuter rail system in the country, serving [[Jabodetabek|Jakarta metropolitan area]]. It connects the [[Jakarta]] city center with surrounding cities and sub-urbans in [[Banten]] and [[West Java]] provinces, including [[Depok]], [[Bogor]], [[Tangerang]], [[Bekasi]], Serpong and Maja. In July 2015, KA Commuter Jabodetabek served more than 850,000 passengers per day, which is almost triple of the 2011 figures, but still less than 3.5% of all Jabodetabek commutes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://megapolitan.kompas.com/read/2015/07/06/14142481/PT.KCJ.Keterlambatan.KRL.Sudah.di.Bawah.10.Menit |title=PT KCJ: Keterlambatan KRL Sudah di Bawah 10 Menit |date=July 6, 2015}}</ref> Other commuter rail systems in Indonesia include the [[Metro Surabaya Commuter Line]], Prambanan Ekspres Commuter, Solo Ekspres, Kedung Sepur, Greater Bandung Commuter, and Cut Meutia.\n\nIn the Philippines, the [[Philippine National Railways]] has two commuter rail systems currently operational; the [[PNR Metro Commuter Line]] in the [[Greater Manila Area]] and the [[PNR Bicol Commuter]] in the [[Bicol Region]]. A new commuter rail line in Metro Manila, the [[North\u2013South Commuter Railway]], is currently under construction. Its North section is set to be partially opened by 2021.\n\nIn Malaysia, the [[KTM Komuter]] serves [[Kuala Lumpur]] and the surrounding [[Klang Valley|Klang Valley area]].\n\nIn Thailand, the [[Greater Bangkok Commuter rail]] and the [[Airport Rail Link (Bangkok)|Airport Rail Link]] serve the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Region]]. The [[SRT Red Lines]], a new commuter line in Bangkok, started construction in 2009. It is currently slated to be opened by 2020.\n\nAnother commuter rail system in Southeast Asia is the [[Yangon Circular Railway]] in [[Myanmar]].\n\n====South Asia====\nIn India, commuter rail systems are present in major cities. [[Mumbai Suburban Railway]], the oldest suburban rail system in Asia, carries more than 7.24 million commuters on a daily basis which constitutes more than half of the total daily passenger capacity of the Indian Railways itself. [[Kolkata Suburban Railway]] is the biggest Suburban Railway network in India covering 348 stations carries more than 3.5 million commuters per day. The [[Chennai Suburban Railway]] along with [[Chennai MRTS|MRTS]] is another railway of comparison where more than 1 million people travel daily to different areas in [[Chennai]]. Other commuter railways in India include [[Hyderabad MMTS]], [[Delhi Suburban Railway]], [[Pune Suburban Railway]] and [[Lucknow-Kanpur Suburban Railway]].\n\nDelhi Regional Rapid Transit System(RRTS) is under construction on 3 routes in [[National Capital Region|Delhi NCR]].The rotes have planned according to  [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] suburban lines in [[Paris]].\n\n==== West Asia ====\nIn Iran, SYSTRA has done a \"Tehran long term urban rail study\". SYSTRA proposed 4 express lines similar to [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] suburban lines in [[Paris]]. [[Tehran Metro]] is going to construct express lines. For instance, the Rahyab Behineh, a consultant for Tehran Metro, is studying Tehran Express Line 2. Tehran Metro currently has a commuter line between [[Tehran]] and [[Karaj]]. [[Isfahan]] has two lines to its suburbs [[Baharestan]] and [[Fuladshahr]] under construction, and a third line to [[Shahinshahr]] is planned.\n\n===Europe===\n{{Main|R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|Commuter rail in the United Kingdom}}\n[[File:Ny pendeltag stockholm.jpg|thumb|right|Type [[SL X60|X60]] at Stockholm Central in Sweden]]\nMajor metropolitan areas in most European countries are usually served by extensive commuter/suburban rail systems. Well-known examples include [[BG Voz]] in [[Belgrade]] (Serbia), [[S-Bahn]] in Germany and German-speaking areas of Switzerland and Austria, [[Proastiakos]] in Greece, [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] in France and Belgium, [[Milan suburban railway service|suburban lines]] in [[Milan]] (Italy), [[Cercan\u00edas]] and [[Rodalies de Catalunya|Rodalies]] ([[Catalonia]]) in Spain, [[CP Urban Services]] in Portugal, [[Esko Prague|Esko]] in [[Prague]] and [[Ostrava]] (Czech Republic), [[H\u00c9V]] in [[Budapest]] (Hungary) and [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit|DART]] in [[Dublin]] (Ireland).\n\nIn Russia, Ukraine and some other countries of the former [[Soviet Union]], electrical multiple unit passenger suburban trains called [[Elektrichka]] are widespread.\n\nIn Sweden, electrified commuter rail systems known as ''Pendelt\u00e5g'' are present in the cities of [[Stockholm]] and [[Gothenburg]]. The [[Stockholm commuter rail]] system, which began in 1968, is similar to the S-Bahn train systems of Munich and Frankfurt such that it may share railway tracks with inter-city trains and freight trains, but for the most part run on its own dedicated tracks, and that it is primarily used to transport passengers from nearby towns and other suburban areas into the city centre, not for transportation inside the city centre. The [[Gothenburg commuter rail]] system, which began in 1960, is similar to the Stockholm system, but does fully share tracks with long-distance trains. Other train systems that are also considered as commuter rail but not counted as ''pendelt\u00e5g'' include [[Roslagsbanan]] and [[Saltsj\u00f6banan]] in Stockholm, [[M\u00e4lart\u00e5g]] in the [[M\u00e4laren Valley]], [[\u00d6stg\u00f6tapendeln]] in [[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland County]], [[Uppt\u00e5get]] in [[Uppsala County]], [[Norrt\u00e5g]] in northern [[Norrland]] and [[Sk\u00e5ne Commuter Rail]] in [[Sk\u00e5ne County]]. Sk\u00e5ne Commuter Rail (''P\u00e5gat\u00e5gen'') acts also as a regional rail system, as it serves cities over 100&nbsp;km (62 miles) and over one hour from the principal city of [[Malm\u00f6]].\n\nIn Norway, the [[Oslo Commuter Rail|Oslo commuter rail]] system mostly shares tracks with more long-distance trains, but also runs on some local railways without other traffic. Oslo has the largest commuter rail system in the Nordic countries in terms of line lengths and number of stations. But some lines have travel times (over an hour from Oslo) and frequencies (once per hour) which are more like regional trains. Also [[Bergen Commuter Rail|Bergen]], [[J\u00e6ren Commuter Rail|Stavanger]] and [[Tr\u00f8nderbanen|Trondheim]] have commuter rail systems. These have only one or two lines each and they share tracks with other trains.\n\nIn [[Finland]], the [[Helsinki commuter rail]] network runs on dedicated tracks from [[Helsinki Central railway station]] to [[Lepp\u00e4vaara railway station|Lepp\u00e4vaara]] and [[Kerava]]. The [[Ring Rail Line]] serves [[Helsinki Airport]] and northern suburbs of [[Vantaa]] and is exclusively used by the commuter rail network.

These networks have frequent services, with frequencies varying from every 10 to every 30 minutes on most suburban lines, and up to 3\u20135 minutes in peak on bundled underground lines in the city centres of Sydney, Brisbane, Perth and Melbourne. The networks in each state developed from mainline railways and have never been completely operationally separate from long distance and freight traffic, unlike [[Rapid transit|metro]] systems in some comparable countries, but nevertheless have cohesive identities and are the backbones of their respective cities' public transport system.

Its train services are transitioning from a peak direction commuter railway to a [[GO Transit Regional Express Rail|Regional Express Network]].]]\n\nMost commuter (or suburban) trains are built to main line rail standards,{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} differing from [[light rail]] or [[rapid transit]] (metro rail)  systems by:\n*being larger\n*providing more seating and less standing room, owing to the longer distances involved\n*having (in most cases) a lower frequency of service\n*having scheduled services (i.e. trains run at specific times rather than at specific intervals)\n*serving lower-density suburban areas, typically connecting [[suburb]]s to the city center\n*sharing track or [[Right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] with intercity or [[freight]] trains\n*not fully grade separated (containing at-grade crossings with crossing gates)\n*being able to skip certain stations as an express service due to normally being driver controlled\n\n===Train schedule===\nCompared to [[rapid transit]] (or metro rail), commuter/suburban rail often has lower [[headway|frequency]], following a schedule rather than fixed intervals, and fewer stations spaced further apart. They primarily serve lower density suburban areas (non inner-city), and often share [[right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] with intercity or [[freight]] trains. Some services operate only during peak hours and others uses fewer departures during off peak hours and weekends. Average speeds are high, often 50&nbsp;km/h (30&nbsp;mph) or higher. These higher speeds better serve the longer distances involved. Some services include express services which skip some stations in order to run faster and separate longer distance riders from short-distance ones.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe general range of commuter trains' distance varies between 15 and 200&nbsp;km (10 and 125 miles).{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Sometimes long distances can be explained by that the train runs between two or several cities (e.g. S-Bahn in the [[Ruhr]] area of Germany). Distances between stations may vary, but are usually much longer than those of urban rail systems. In city centers the train either has a terminal station or passes through the city centre with notably fewer station stops than those of urban rail systems. Toilets are often available on-board trains and in stations.\n\n===Track===\nTheir ability to coexist with freight or intercity services in the same [[Right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] can drastically reduce system construction costs. However, frequently they are built with dedicated tracks within that right-of-way to prevent delays, especially where service densities have converged in the inner parts of the network.\n\nMost such trains run on the [[List of track gauges|local standard gauge]] track. Some systems may run on a narrower or broader gauge. Examples of [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] systems are found in Japan, [[Kereta Commuter Indonesia|Indonesia]], [[KTM Komuter|Malaysia]], [[Greater Bangkok Commuter rail|Thailand]], Switzerland, in the [[Brisbane]] ([[Queensland Rail]]'s [[Queensland Rail City network|City network]]) and [[Perth]] ([[Transperth]]) systems in Australia, in some systems in Sweden, and on the [[:it:Ferrovia Genova-Casella|Genoa-Casella line]] in Italy. Some countries and regions, including [[Helsinki commuter rail|Finland]], India, Pakistan, [[Elektrichka|Russia]], Brazil and Sri Lanka, as well as [[San Francisco]] ([[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]]) in the US and [[Metro Trains Melbourne|Melbourne]] and [[Adelaide Metro|Adelaide]] in Australia, use [[broad gauge]] track.\n\n===Distinction between other modes of rail===\n\n====Metro====\nMetro rail or [[rapid transit]] usually covers a smaller inner-urban area ranging outwards to between 12&nbsp;km to 20&nbsp;km (or 8 to 14 miles), has a higher train frequency and runs on separate tracks (underground or elevated), whereas commuter rail often shares tracks, technology and the legal framework within mainline railway systems.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nHowever, the classification as a metro or rapid rail can be difficult as both may typically cover a metropolitan area exclusively, run on separate tracks in the centre, and often feature purpose-built rolling stock. The fact that the terminology is not standardised across countries (even across English-speaking countries) further complicates matters. This distinction is most easily made when there are two (or more) systems such as New York's [[New York City Subway|subway]] and the [[Long Island Rail Road|LIRR]] and [[Metro-North Railroad]], Paris' [[Paris M\u00e9tro|M\u00e9tro]] and [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] along with [[Transilien]], London's tube lines of the [[London Underground|Underground]] and the [[London Overground|Overground]], (future) [[Crossrail]], [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]] along with other commuter rail [[Transport in London#Heavy rail|operators]], Madrid's [[Madrid Metro|Metro]] and [[Cercan\u00edas Madrid|Cercan\u00edas]], Barcelona's [[Barcelona Metro|Metro]] and [[Rodalies de Catalunya|Rodalies]], and Tokyo's [[Tokyo subway|subway]] and the [[East Japan Railway Company#Greater Tokyo Area|JR lines]] along with various privately owned and operated commuter rail systems.\n\n====S-Trains====\n\nAn [[S-Train]] is a type of hybrid [[urban rail|urban]]-[[suburban rail]] serving a [[metropolitan region]]. The most well-known S-train systems are the S-Bahn systems in Germany and Austria. Other well-known examples of S-train systems include the [[Copenhagen S-train|S-tog]] in [[Copenhagen]] and S-Bahn/RER systems in [[Switzerland]]. In Germany, the [[S-Bahn]] is regarded as a train category of its own, and exists in many large cities and in some other areas, with differing service and technical standards from city to city. \nMost S-Bahns typically behave like commuter rail with most trackage not separated from other trains, and long lines with trains running between cities and suburbs rather than within a city. The distances between stations however, are usually short. In larger systems there is usually a high frequency metro-like central corridor in the city center where all the lines converge into. Typical examples of large city S-Bahns include Munich and Frankfurt. S-Bahns also exist in some mid-size cities like Rostock and Magdeburg but behave more like typical commuter rail with lower frequencies and very little exclusive trackage. In [[Berlin]], the [[Berlin S-Bahn|S-Bahn systems]] arguably fulfill all considerations of a true metro system (despite the existence of [[U-Bahn]]s as well) \u2013 the trains run on tracks that are entirely separated from other trains, short distances between stations, high frequency and uses tunnels but do run a bit further out from the city centre, compared with U-Bahn. In Hamburg and Copenhagen, other, diesel driven trains, do continue where the S-Bahn ends (\"[[AKN Eisenbahn|A-Bahn]]\" in Hamburg area, and \"L-tog\" in Copenhagen).{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n====Regional rail====\n[[Regional rail]] usually provides [[rail transport|rail services]] between towns and cities, rather than purely linking major population hubs in the way [[inter-city rail]] does. Regional rail operates outside major cities. Unlike Inter-city, it stops at most or all stations between cities. It provides a service between smaller communities along the line, and also connections with long-distance services at interchange stations located at junctions or at larger towns along the line. Alternative names are \"local train\" or \"stopping train\". Examples include the former [[British Rail|BR]]'s [[Regional Railways]], France's [[Transport express r\u00e9gional|TER]] (''Transport express r\u00e9gional''), Germany's [[DB Regio]] and South Korea's [[Tonggeun]] services.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nRegional rail does not exist in this sense in the United States, so the term \"regional rail\" has become synonymous with commuter rail there, although the two are more clearly defined in Europe.\n\n====Inter-city rail====\n{{see also|Inter-city rail}}\n[[File:Sydney Trains H22 OSCAR.jpg|thumb|A [[NSW TrainLink]] [[NSW TrainLink H set|H set]] at Sydney's [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central station]].]]\nIn some European countries the distinction between commuter trains and long-distance/intercity trains is very hard to make, because of the relatively short distances involved. For example, so-called \"[[Inter-city rail|intercity]]\" trains in Belgium and the Netherlands carry many commuters and their equipment, range and speeds are similar to those of commuter trains in some larger countries. In the United Kingdom there is no real division of organisation and brand name between commuter, regional and inter-city trains, making it hard to categorize train connections.\n\n[[Elektrichka|Russian commuter trains]], on the other hand, frequently cover areas larger than Belgium itself, although these are still short distances by Russian standards. They have a different ticketing system from long-distance trains, and in major cities they often operate from a separate section of the train station.\n\nThe easiest way to identify these \"inter-city\" services is that they tend to operate as express services - only linking the main stations in the cities they link, not stopping at any other stations. However, this term is used in Australia (Sydney for example) to describe the regional trains operating beyond the boundaries of the suburban services, even though some of these \"inter-city\" services stop all stations similar to German regional services. In this regard, the German service delineations and corresponding naming conventions are clearer and better used for academic purposes.\n\n====High-speed rail====\nSometimes [[high-speed rail]] can serve daily use of commuters. The Japanese [[Shinkansen]] high speed rail system is heavily used by commuters in the [[Greater Tokyo Area]]. They commute between 100 and 200&nbsp;km by [[Shinkansen]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/fact-sheet-high-speed-rail-development-worldwide|title=Fact Sheet: High Speed Rail Development Worldwide {{!}} White Papers {{!}} EESI|website=www.eesi.org|access-date=2019-12-04}}</ref> To meet the demand of commuters, [[Japan Railways Group|JR]] sells commuter discount passes and operates 16-car [[bilevel car|bilevel]] [[E4 Series Shinkansen]] trains at rush hour, providing a capacity of 1,600 seats. Several lines in China, such as the [[Beijing\u2013Tianjin Intercity Railway]] and the [[Shanghai\u2013Nanjing High-Speed Railway]], serve a similar role with many more under construction or planned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shine.cn/news/metro/1806116099/|title=Metro closes the gap with areas across the border - SHINE|website=SHINE|language=en|access-date=2018-06-23}}</ref>\n\nThe high-speed services linking [[Z\u00fcrich]], [[Bern]] and [[Basel]] in [[Switzerland]] ({{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}}) have brought the Central Business Districts (CBDs) of these three cities within 1 hour of each other. This has resulted in unexpectedly high demand for new commuter trips between the three cities and a corresponding increase in suburban rail passengers accessing the high-speed services at the main city-centre stations (or Hauptbahnhof). The [[Regional-Express]] commuter service between [[Munich]] and [[Nuremberg]] in Germany go in ({{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}}) along a [[Nuremberg\u2013Munich high-speed railway|300 km/h high-speed line]].\n\nThe regional trains [[Stockholm]]\u2013[[Uppsala]], Stockholm\u2013[[V\u00e4ster\u00e5s]], Stockholm\u2013[[Eskilstuna]] and [[Gothenburg]]\u2013[[Trollh\u00e4ttan]] in [[Sweden]] reach {{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}} and have many daily commuters.\n\n==Train types==\nCommuter/suburban trains are usually optimized for maximum passenger volume, in most cases without sacrificing too much comfort and [[luggage]] space, though they seldom have all the amenities of long-distance trains. Cars may be single- or [[bilevel car|double-level]], and aim to provide seating for all. Compared to intercity trains, they have less space, fewer amenities and limited baggage areas.\n\n===Multiple unit type===\n\nCommuter rail trains are usually composed of [[multiple unit]]s, which are self-propelled, bidirectional, articulated passenger rail cars with driving motors on each (or every other) [[bogie]]. Depending on local circumstances and tradition they may be powered either by [[diesel engines]] located below the passenger compartment ([[diesel multiple unit]]s) or by electricity picked up from [[third rail]]s or [[overhead lines]] ([[electric multiple unit]]s). Multiple units are almost invariably equipped with control cabs at both ends, which is why such units are so frequently used to provide commuter services, due to the associated short turn-around time.\n\n===Locomotive hauled services===\n[[File:ACE EMD F40PH Fremont - San Jose.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Altamont Corridor Express]] train operating along the [[San Francisco Bay]]; a MPI F40PH-2C locomotive hauls a consist of Bombardier Bi-Level VI coaches.]]\nLocomotive hauled services are used in some countries or locations. This is often a case of [[Business operations|asset sweating]], by using a single large combined fleet for intercity and regional services. Loco hauled services are usually run in [[Push-pull train|push-pull]] formation, that is, the train can run with the locomotive at the \"front\" or \"rear\" of the train (pushing or pulling). Trains are often equipped with a control cab at the other end of the train from the locomotive, allowing the train operator to operate the train from either end. The motive power for locomotive-hauled commuter trains may be either electric or [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]], although some countries, such as Germany and some of the former Soviet-bloc countries, also use diesel-hydraulic locomotives.\n\n=== Seat plans ===\nIn the US and some other countries, a three-and-two seat plan is used. However, few people sit in the middle seat on these trains because they feel crowded and uncomfortable.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/31/nyregion/for-train-riders-middle-seat-isnt-the-center-of-attention.html|title=For Train Riders, Middle Seat Isn't the Center of Attention|first=Patrick|last=McGeehan|date=31 May 2005|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/06/opinion/on-the-802-express-threes-a-crowd-139947.html|title=On the 8:02 Express, Three's a Crowd|date=6 June 2005|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\nIn Japan and South Korea, longitudinal (sideways window-lining) seating is widely used in many commuter rail trains to increase capacity in rush hours. Carriages are usually not organized to increase [[seating capacity]] (although in some trains at least one carriage would feature more doors to facilitate easier boarding and alighting and bench seats so that they can be folded up during rush hour to provide more standing room) even in the case of commuting longer than 50&nbsp;km and commuters in the [[Greater Tokyo Area]] and the [[Seoul metropolitan area]] have to stand in the train for more than an hour.\n\n==Commuter rail systems around the world==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2009}}\n\n===Africa===\n{{See also|Template:Suburban railways in Africa}}\n[[File:Kalk Bay Station 3.jpg|thumb|A [[Metrorail (South Africa)|Metrorail]] train pulling out of [[Kalk Bay]] station in [[Cape Town]]]]\nCurrently there are not many examples of commuter rail in Africa. [[Metrorail (South Africa)|Metrorail]] operates in the major cities of South Africa, and there are some commuter rail services in Algeria, Botswana, Kenya, Morocco, Egypt and Tunisia.\nIn Algeria, [[SNTF]] operates commuter rail lines between the capital [[Algiers]] and its southern and eastern suburbs. They also serve to connect [[Algiers]]' main [[University of Science and Technology, Houari Boumediene|universities]] to each other. The [[Dar es Salaam commuter rail]] offers intracity services in [[Dar es Salaam]], Tanzania. In Botswana, the ([[Botswana Railways]]) \"BR Express\" has a commuter train between [[Lobatse]] and [[Gaborone]].\n\n===Asia===\n\n====East Asia====\n[[File:Tokyo Metro 16000 Series 16111f Semi Express.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Tokyo Metro 16000 series]] train operating a through service on the [[JR East]] [[Joban Line]], an example of high-density commuter rail in Japan.]]\n\nIn Japan, commuter rail systems have extensive network and frequent service and are heavily used. In many cases, Japanese commuter rail is operationally more like a typical metro system (with very high operating frequencies, an emphasis on [[standing passenger]]s, short station spacing) than it is like commuter rail in other countries. Japanese commuter rail also tends to be heavily interlined with subway lines, with commuter rail trains continuing into the subway network, and then out onto different commuter rail systems on the other side of the city.  Many Japanese commuter systems operate several levels of express trains to reduce the travel time to distant locations, often using station bypass tracks instead of dedicated express tracks. It is notable that the larger Japanese commuter rail systems are owned and operated by for-profit [[private railway]] companies, without public subsidy.\n\nCommuter rail systems have been inaugurated in several cities in China such as [[Beijing Suburban Railway|Beijing]], [[Jinshan Railway|Shanghai]], [[Central Plain Metropolitan Intercity Rail|Zhengzhou]], [[Wuhan Metropolitan Area Intercity Railway|Wuhan]], [[Changsha\u2013Zhuzhou\u2013Xiangtan Intercity Railway|Changsha]] and the [[Pearl River Delta Rapid Transit|Pearl River Delta]]. With plans for large systems in northeastern [[Zhejiang]], [[Jingjinji]], and [[Yangtze River Delta]] areas. The level of service varies considerably from line to line ranging [[high speed rail|high]] to near high speeds. More developed and established lines such as the [[Guangzhou\u2013Shenzhen Railway|Guangshen Railway]] have more frequent metro like service. Hong Kong [[MTR]]'s [[East Rail Line]], [[West Rail Line]] and [[Tung Chung Line]] were built to commuter rail standards but are operated as a metro system.\n\nIn Taiwan, [[West Coast line (Taiwan)|Western Line]] in [[Taipei]]-[[Taoyuan City|Taoyuan]] Metropolitan Area, [[Taichung]] Metropolitan Area, [[Tainan]]-[[Kaohsiung]] Metropolitan Area as well as [[Neiwan Line|Neiwan]]-[[Liujia Line]] in [[Hsinchu]] Area is considered commuter rail.\n\nOther examples in East Asia include [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway]] of which some lines are suburban lines operated by [[Korail]] in South Korea.\n\n====Southeast Asia====\n[[File:Commuterline at Palmerah Station 4.JPG|thumb|right|Electric multiple unit of [[KA Commuter Jabodetabek|KRL Commuterline]] [[KA Commuter Line Tanah Abang-Maja|Serpong Line]] train at Palmerah Station, [[Jakarta]]]]\n\nIn [[Indonesia]], the [[KRL Commuterline]] is the largest commuter rail system in the country, serving [[Jabodetabek|Jakarta metropolitan area]]. It connects the [[Jakarta]] city center with surrounding cities and sub-urbans in [[Banten]] and [[West Java]] provinces, including [[Depok]], [[Bogor]], [[Tangerang]], [[Bekasi]], Serpong and Maja. In July 2015, KA Commuter Jabodetabek served more than 850,000 passengers per day, which is almost triple of the 2011 figures, but still less than 3.5% of all Jabodetabek commutes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://megapolitan.kompas.com/read/2015/07/06/14142481/PT.KCJ.Keterlambatan.KRL.Sudah.di.Bawah.10.Menit |title=PT KCJ: Keterlambatan KRL Sudah di Bawah 10 Menit |date=July 6, 2015}}</ref> Other commuter rail systems in Indonesia include the [[Metro Surabaya Commuter Line]], Prambanan Ekspres Commuter, Solo Ekspres, Kedung Sepur, Greater Bandung Commuter, and Cut Meutia.\n\nIn the Philippines, the [[Philippine National Railways]] has two commuter rail systems currently operational; the [[PNR Metro Commuter Line]] in the [[Greater Manila Area]] and the [[PNR Bicol Commuter]] in the [[Bicol Region]]. A new commuter rail line in Metro Manila, the [[North\u2013South Commuter Railway]], is currently under construction. Its North section is set to be partially opened by 2021.\n\nIn Malaysia, the [[KTM Komuter]] serves [[Kuala Lumpur]] and the surrounding [[Klang Valley|Klang Valley area]].\n\nIn Thailand, the [[Greater Bangkok Commuter rail]] and the [[Airport Rail Link (Bangkok)|Airport Rail Link]] serve the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Region]]. The [[SRT Red Lines]], a new commuter line in Bangkok, started construction in 2009. It is currently slated to be opened by 2020.\n\nAnother commuter rail system in Southeast Asia is the [[Yangon Circular Railway]] in [[Myanmar]].\n\n====South Asia====\nIn India, commuter rail systems are present in major cities. [[Mumbai Suburban Railway]], the oldest suburban rail system in Asia, carries more than 7.24 million commuters on a daily basis which constitutes more than half of the total daily passenger capacity of the Indian Railways itself. [[Kolkata Suburban Railway]] is the biggest Suburban Railway network in India covering 348 stations carries more than 3.5 million commuters per day. The [[Chennai Suburban Railway]] along with [[Chennai MRTS|MRTS]] is another railway of comparison where more than 1 million people travel daily to different areas in [[Chennai]]. Other commuter railways in India include [[Hyderabad MMTS]], [[Delhi Suburban Railway]], [[Pune Suburban Railway]] and [[Lucknow-Kanpur Suburban Railway]].\n\nDelhi Regional Rapid Transit System(RRTS) is under construction on 3 routes in [[National Capital Region|Delhi NCR]].The rotes have planned according to  [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] suburban lines in [[Paris]].\n\n==== West Asia ====\nIn Iran, SYSTRA has done a \"Tehran long term urban rail study\". SYSTRA proposed 4 express lines similar to [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] suburban lines in [[Paris]]. [[Tehran Metro]] is going to construct express lines. For instance, the Rahyab Behineh, a consultant for Tehran Metro, is studying Tehran Express Line 2. Tehran Metro currently has a commuter line between [[Tehran]] and [[Karaj]]. [[Isfahan]] has two lines to its suburbs [[Baharestan]] and [[Fuladshahr]] under construction, and a third line to [[Shahinshahr]] is planned.\n\n===Europe===\n{{Main|R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|Commuter rail in the United Kingdom}}\n[[File:Ny pendeltag stockholm.jpg|thumb|right|Type [[SL X60|X60]] at Stockholm Central in Sweden]]\nMajor metropolitan areas in most European countries are usually served by extensive commuter/suburban rail systems. Well-known examples include [[BG Voz]] in [[Belgrade]] (Serbia), [[S-Bahn]] in Germany and German-speaking areas of Switzerland and Austria, [[Proastiakos]] in Greece, [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] in France and Belgium, [[Milan suburban railway service|suburban lines]] in [[Milan]] (Italy), [[Cercan\u00edas]] and [[Rodalies de Catalunya|Rodalies]] ([[Catalonia]]) in Spain, [[CP Urban Services]] in Portugal, [[Esko Prague|Esko]] in [[Prague]] and [[Ostrava]] (Czech Republic), [[H\u00c9V]] in [[Budapest]] (Hungary) and [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit|DART]] in [[Dublin]] (Ireland).\n\nIn Russia, Ukraine and some other countries of the former [[Soviet Union]], electrical multiple unit passenger suburban trains called [[Elektrichka]] are widespread.\n\nIn Sweden, electrified commuter rail systems known as ''Pendelt\u00e5g'' are present in the cities of [[Stockholm]] and [[Gothenburg]]. The [[Stockholm commuter rail]] system, which began in 1968, is similar to the S-Bahn train systems of Munich and Frankfurt such that it may share railway tracks with inter-city trains and freight trains, but for the most part run on its own dedicated tracks, and that it is primarily used to transport passengers from nearby towns and other suburban areas into the city centre, not for transportation inside the city centre. The [[Gothenburg commuter rail]] system, which began in 1960, is similar to the Stockholm system, but does fully share tracks with long-distance trains. Other train systems that are also considered as commuter rail but not counted as ''pendelt\u00e5g'' include [[Roslagsbanan]] and [[Saltsj\u00f6banan]] in Stockholm, [[M\u00e4lart\u00e5g]] in the [[M\u00e4laren Valley]], [[\u00d6stg\u00f6tapendeln]] in [[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland County]], [[Uppt\u00e5get]] in [[Uppsala County]], [[Norrt\u00e5g]] in northern [[Norrland]] and [[Sk\u00e5ne Commuter Rail]] in [[Sk\u00e5ne County]]. Sk\u00e5ne Commuter Rail (''P\u00e5gat\u00e5gen'') acts also as a regional rail system, as it serves cities over 100&nbsp;km (62 miles) and over one hour from the principal city of [[Malm\u00f6]].\n\nIn Norway, the [[Oslo Commuter Rail|Oslo commuter rail]] system mostly shares tracks with more long-distance trains, but also runs on some local railways without other traffic. Oslo has the largest commuter rail system in the Nordic countries in terms of line lengths and number of stations. But some lines have travel times (over an hour from Oslo) and frequencies (once per hour) which are more like regional trains. Also [[Bergen Commuter Rail|Bergen]], [[J\u00e6ren Commuter Rail|Stavanger]] and [[Tr\u00f8nderbanen|Trondheim]] have commuter rail systems. These have only one or two lines each and they share tracks with other trains.\n\nIn [[Finland]], the [[Helsinki commuter rail]] network runs on dedicated tracks from [[Helsinki Central railway station]] to [[Lepp\u00e4vaara railway station|Lepp\u00e4vaara]] and [[Kerava]]. The [[Ring Rail Line]] serves [[Helsinki Airport]] and northern suburbs of [[Vantaa]] and is exclusively used by the commuter rail network. On 15 December 2019 Tampere got its own commuter rail service.\n\nIn Poland, commuter rail systems exist in [[Szybka Kolej Miejska (Tricity)|Tricity]], [[Szybka Kolej Miejska (Warsaw)|Warsaw]], [[Krakow]] and [[Katowice]]. There is also a similar system planned in [[Wroc\u0142aw]] and [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]].\n\nIn Romania, the first commuter trains were introduced in December 2019. They operate currently between [[Bucharest]] and Funduea or [[Buftea]].\n\n===Americas===\n====North and Central America====\n{{Main|Commuter rail in North America}}\n[[File:Metrolink F59PHI 885.jpg|thumb|Metrolink provides commuter rail service to six counties in Southern California.]]\nIn the United States, Canada, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Mexico regional passenger rail services are provided by governmental or quasi-governmental agencies, with a limited number of metropolitan areas served.\n\nEight commuter rail systems in the United States carried over ten million trips in 2018:{{Fix|text=which eight out of this list?}}\n* [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]'s [[Long Island Rail Road]], serving [[New York City]] and [[Long Island]]\n* [[NJ Transit Rail Operations]], serving New York City, New Jersey ([[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]]) and [[Philadelphia]]\n* Metropolitan Transportation Authority's [[Metro-North Railroad]], serving New York ([[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]] and New York City) and Southwest Connecticut ([[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]])\n* [[Metra]], serving northeast Illinois ([[Chicago]]), [[Northern Indiana]], and [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]]\n* [[SEPTA Regional Rail]], serving southeast Pennsylvania (Philadelphia), as well as [[Wilmington, Delaware]], and [[Trenton, New Jersey]]\n* [[Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority]], serving Massachusetts (Boston, [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]]) and [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]]\n* [[Caltrain]], serving California ([[San Francisco]], [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], and the [[San Francisco Peninsula]])\n* [[Metrolink (California)|Metrolink]], serving California ([[Los Angeles]], [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], and [[Southern California]])\n*[[Utah Transit Authority]] [[FrontRunner]], serving Utah ([[Wasatch Front]])\n*[[North County Transit District]] [[Coaster (San Diego)|Coaster]], serving California ([[San Diego County]])\n*[[Maryland Area Regional Commuter]], serving [[Maryland]] ([[Baltimore]]) and [[Washington, D.C.]]\n*[[Regional Transportation District]], serving [[Colorado]] ([[Denver]])\n*[[Virginia Railway Express]], serving suburbs of [[Northern Virginia]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]\n*[[Sounder commuter rail]], serving [[Washington (state)|Washington]] ([[Seattle]] / [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]])\n*[[Tri-Rail]], serving [[Florida]] ([[Miami]] / [[Fort Lauderdale]] / [[West Palm Beach]])\n*[[Trinity Railway Express]], serving [[Texas]] ([[Dallas]] / [[Fort Worth]])\n*[[Altamont Corridor Express]], serving [[California]] ([[San Jose, California|San Jose]] / [[Stockton, California|Stockton]])\n*[[SunRail]], serving [[Florida]] ([[Orlando]]/[[Poinciana, Florida|Poinciana]])\n*[[WES Commuter Rail]], serving [[Oregon]] ([[Beaverton, Oregon|Beverton]]/[[willsonville, Oregon|Willsonville]])\n*[[New Mexico Rail Runner Express]], serving [[New Mexico]] ([[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]])\n*[[Northstar Line]], serving [[Minnesota]] ([[Big Lake, Minnesota|Big Lake]] and downtown [[Minneapolis]])\n*[[Capital MetroRail]], serving [[Texas]] ([[Austin]])\n*[[A-train (Denton County)|A-train]],serving [[Texas]] ([[Denton County]])\n*[[Sonoma\u2013Marin Area Rail Transit|SMART]], serving [[California]] ([[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma]] and [[Marin County, California|Marin]] counties)\n*[[Music City Star]], serving [[Nashville]] and [[Lebanon, Tennessee]].\n\nNorth American commuter rail systems outside of the United States include:\n* [[GO Transit rail services]] in [[Toronto]]\n* [[Exo (public transit)|Exo]] in [[Montreal]]\n* [[West Coast Express]] in [[Vancouver]]\n* [[Suburban Railway of the Valley of Mexico Metropolitan Area]] serving [[Mexico City]]\n* [[Toluca-M\u00e9xico City commuter line]] serving [[Toluca]] and [[Mexico City]]\n\n===Central America===\n*[[Rail Transport in Honduras|City Rail]] serving [[La Ceiba]]\n*[[Rail Transport in El Salvador|San Salvador Suburban Rail]] serving [[San Salvador]] and [[Santa Ana]]\n*[[Tren Urbano de Costa Rica|Rail Transport in Costa Rica]] serving [[San Jose]]\n\n====South America====\n[[File:EMU CSR M20 en Barrancas.jpg|thumb|The [[Mitre Line]] is part of the extensive [[Rail transport in Argentina#Commuter networks|Buenos Aires metropolitan rail system]].]]\nExamples include an {{convert|899|km|mi|adj=on|abbr=on}} commuter system in the [[Rail transport in Argentina#Commuter networks|Buenos Aires metropolitan area]], the {{convert|225|km|mi|adj=on|abbr=on}} long [[Supervia]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], the [[Metrotr\u00e9n]] in [[Santiago]], [[Chile]], and the [[Valpara\u00edso Metro]] in [[Valpara\u00edso]], Chile.

CPTM has 94 stations with seven lines, numbered starting on 7 (the lines 1 to 6 and the line 15 belong to the [[S\u00e3o Paulo Metro]]), with a total length of {{convert|273|km}}.\n\n===Oceania===\n{{Main|Rail transport in Australia}}\n[[File:Siemens train in Metro Trains Melbourne Livery.jpg|thumb|A Melbourne Siemens commuter train]]\nThe five major cities in Australia have suburban railway systems in their metropolitan areas. These networks have frequent services, with frequencies varying from every 10 to every 30 minutes on most suburban lines, and up to 3\u20135 minutes in peak on bundled underground lines in the city centres of Sydney, Brisbane, Perth and Melbourne. The networks in each state developed from mainline railways and have never been completely operationally separate from long distance and freight traffic, unlike [[Rapid transit|metro]] systems in some comparable countries, but nevertheless have cohesive identities and are the backbones of their respective cities' public transport system. The suburban networks are almost completely electrified.\n\nThe main suburban rail networks in Australia are:\n*The [[Railways in Sydney|Sydney rail network]] operated by [[Sydney Trains]] in [[Sydney]] (with connected suburban services in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] and [[Wollongong]] run by its counterpart intercity operator, [[NSW TrainLink]]).\n*The [[Railways in Melbourne|Melbourne rail network]] operated by [[Metro Trains Melbourne]] in [[Melbourne]].\n*The [[Queensland Rail City network]] operated by [[Queensland Rail]] in [[Brisbane]].\n*[[Transperth Trains]] in [[Perth]].\n*The [[Railways in Adelaide|Adelaide rail network]] operated by [[Adelaide Metro]] in [[Adelaide]].\n\nNew Zealand has two frequent suburban rail services comparable to those in Australia: the [[Public transport in Auckland|Auckland rail network]] is operated by [[Transdev Auckland]] and the [[Public transport in the Wellington Region|Wellington rail network]] is operated by [[Transdev Wellington]].\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[List of suburban and commuter rail systems]]\n*[[Public transport]]\n*[[Commuting]]\n*[[Cercan\u00edas]], the commuter rail systems of Spain's major metropolitan areas\n*[[Commuter rail in the United Kingdom]]\n*[[Commuter rail in North America]]\n*[[Commuter rail in Australia]]\n*[[S-Bahn]], the combined city center and suburban railway system metro in Austria, Germany, Switzerland and Denmark\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070515131747/http://www.railserve.com/railnews/commuter_rail_transit.html Commuter Rail & Transit News] Current news concerning commuter rail development and issues\n\n{{Public transport}}\n{{Portal bar|Transport}}\n\n[[Category:Regional rail|*]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toSan Jos\u00e9(link changed toSan Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commuter_rail"}
