He later wrote that he was the son of R. Wentworth Smyth, a Jacobite who had fought in the risings of [[Jacobite rising of 1715|1715]] and [[Jacobite rising of 1745|1745]]. According to Stuart\u2019s account, in 1744 his father was sixty-six and married Maria Julia Dalziel, a girl of fifteen, as his second wife. He reported that his mother was a grand-daughter of [[James Crofts (British Army officer)|General James Crofts]], a natural son of the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]], and that his father was Monmouth\u2019s natural son by Henrietta Maria Wentworth, a daughter of [[Thomas Wentworth, 5th Baron Wentworth|Thomas, Lord Wentworth]], and grand-daughter of [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Cleveland]]. Henrietta Maria had died in 1686, not long after Monmouth's execution, and her son Wentworth had been adopted by a Colonel Smyth, an [[aide-de-camp]] of Monmouth, becoming the Colonel\u2019s heir.<ref name=dnb>[[Edward Irving Carlyle]], \u201cStuart, John Ferdinand Smyth\u201d, in ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]] 1885-1900'', Vol. 55</ref> Consequently, Stuart\u2019s father grew up in France.

The two schools are separated by {{convert|3|mi|km}} in [[Cincinnati]], making the archrivalry one of the closest major rivalries in the country. The game was first played in 1927, and has been played every year since 1946. In recent years, the game has been sponsored by [[Skyline Chili]]. \n \nThroughout its history, the game has been played at six different venues including the [[Armory Fieldhouse]] and [[Fifth Third Arena]] on the UC campus; and the [[Schmidt Field House]] and [[Cintas Center]] on the Xavier campus. However, the majority of the games have been played at two other sites\u2014[[Cincinnati Gardens]] and [[U.S. Bank Arena]]. The Gardens has served as the regular home court for both schools at different times, and was even shared by both teams from 1987 to 1989.  U.S. Bank Arena was UC's home court from 1976 to 1987 when it was known as Riverfront Coliseum.\n\nFrom 1989 to 2011, the game alternated between the schools' on-campus arenas.  However, the 2011 game was disrupted at the end by [[2011 Crosstown Shootout brawl|a bench-clearing brawl]]. As a result of this brawl, Cincinnati and Xavier suspended 4 players each for one game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/7341744/cincinnati-bearcats-suspend-four-players-brawl-xavier-musketeers|title=Cincinnati, Xavier both suspend four after brawl|date=2011-12-11|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref> ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'' reported on May 22, 2012 that due to the brawl, the game would be held at U.S. Bank Arena for the next two seasons.

The first game of the resumed series was held on February 18, 2015 during ESPN's Rivalry Week when Xavier hosted Cincinnati on December 12, 2015 at the Cintas Center.\n\n==History==\nThe history of the Crosstown Shootout dates back to 1928, when the University of Cincinnati helped St. Xavier College dedicate its brand new, $350,000 Schmidt Fieldhouse, which had a capacity of 4,500. Xavier won the game, 29\u201325, and the two teams didn't meet again until the 1942\u201343 season. The teams began playing on an annual basis starting in 1945\u201346, and from 1948 to 1958, they played each other twice a year.\n\nOne unique aspect is player and coach [[Tay Baker]], who was a player and longtime assistant at Cincinnati before taking over as Head Coach from 1965\u20131972. After resigning from UC with a 125\u201360 record, Baker moved across town where he coached Xavier from 1973\u20131979.\n\nThe rivalry between Cincinnati and Xavier is regarded as one of the best in the game. The two schools' short distance apart has distinguished it as a proximity rivalry. From 1990 through 2011 and again since 2015, the game alternates between Xavier's and Cincinnati's campus arenas on a yearly basis.<ref>{{cite web|title=Crosstown Shootout: A Cincinnati Tradition|url=http://www.crosstownshootout.com/history.php|accessdate=17 April 2012}}</ref> ESPN's [[Jay Bilas]] was quoted as saying, \"Cincinnati and Xavier have created a rivalry that is unparalleled when it comes to outright passion and civic division.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Crosstown Shootout: A Cincinnati Tradition|url=http://www.crosstownshootout.com/}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990 a local TV station refused to interrupt their coverage of the Cincinnati\u2013Xavier game for the 1990 [[State of the Union address]].<ref name=ESPN>{{cite web|last=O'Neil|first=Dana|title=Great rivalries are made of this...|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/7547805/rivalry-week-brings-best-men-college-basketball#Proximity}}</ref>\n\nThe game is widely regarded as one of the hottest tickets in Cincinnati every year.

Bearcats men's basketball|Bearcats]] and [[Xavier University]] [[Xavier Musketeers men's basketball|Musketeers]]. The two schools are separated by {{convert|3|mi|km}} in [[Cincinnati]], making the archrivalry one of the closest major rivalries in the country. The game was first played in 1927, and has been played every year since 1946. In recent years, the game has been sponsored by [[Skyline Chili]]. \n \nThroughout its history, the game has been played at six different venues including the [[Armory Fieldhouse]] and [[Fifth Third Arena]] on the UC campus; and the [[Schmidt Field House]] and [[Cintas Center]] on the Xavier campus. However, the majority of the games have been played at two other sites\u2014[[Cincinnati Gardens]] and [[U.S. Bank Arena]]. The Gardens has served as the regular home court for both schools at different times, and was even shared by both teams from 1987 to 1989.  U.S. Bank Arena was UC's home court from 1976 to 1987 when it was known as Riverfront Coliseum.\n\nFrom 1989 to 2011, the game alternated between the schools' on-campus arenas.  However, the 2011 game was disrupted at the end by [[2011 Crosstown Shootout brawl|a bench-clearing brawl]]. As a result of this brawl, Cincinnati and Xavier suspended 4 players each for one game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/7341744/cincinnati-bearcats-suspend-four-players-brawl-xavier-musketeers|title=Cincinnati, Xavier both suspend four after brawl|date=2011-12-11|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref> ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'' reported on May 22, 2012 that due to the brawl, the game would be held at U.S. Bank Arena for the next two seasons.

The first game of the resumed series was held on February 18, 2015 during ESPN's Rivalry Week when Xavier hosted Cincinnati on December 12, 2015 at the Cintas Center.\n\n==History==\nThe history of the Crosstown Shootout dates back to 1928, when the University of Cincinnati helped St. Xavier College dedicate its brand new, $350,000 Schmidt Fieldhouse, which had a capacity of 4,500. Xavier won the game, 29\u201325, and the two teams didn't meet again until the 1942\u201343 season. The teams began playing on an annual basis starting in 1945\u201346, and from 1948 to 1958, they played each other twice a year.\n\nOne unique aspect is player and coach [[Tay Baker]], who was a player and longtime assistant at Cincinnati before taking over as Head Coach from 1965\u20131972. After resigning from UC with a 125\u201360 record, Baker moved across town where he coached Xavier from 1973\u20131979.\n\nThe rivalry between Cincinnati and Xavier is regarded as one of the best in the game. The two schools' short distance apart has distinguished it as a proximity rivalry. From 1990 through 2011 and again since 2015, the game alternates between Xavier's and Cincinnati's campus arenas on a yearly basis.<ref>{{cite web|title=Crosstown Shootout: A Cincinnati Tradition|url=http://www.crosstownshootout.com/history.php|accessdate=17 April 2012}}</ref> ESPN's [[Jay Bilas]] was quoted as saying, \"Cincinnati and Xavier have created a rivalry that is unparalleled when it comes to outright passion and civic division.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Crosstown Shootout: A Cincinnati Tradition|url=http://www.crosstownshootout.com/}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990 a local TV station refused to interrupt their coverage of the Cincinnati\u2013Xavier game for the 1990 [[State of the Union address]].<ref name=ESPN>{{cite web|last=O'Neil|first=Dana|title=Great rivalries are made of this...|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/7547805/rivalry-week-brings-best-men-college-basketball#Proximity}}</ref>\n\nThe game is widely regarded as one of the hottest tickets in Cincinnati every year.

The scene as written had minimal direction, but Seehorn, in preparing for the shot, saw a number of subtleties with the scene that suggested she knew Jimmy intimately, that she had boundaries, and she was used to cleaning up after Jimmy's mistakes. She also felt from this scene that Kim would prefer to listen before speaking and using that as a position of power. The writers saw how Seehorn acted out the scene and realizes how much more it defined the character going forward, someone that prioritized work and placed boundaries on her relationship with Jimmy but still cared for him. Gilligan considered Seehorn's ongoing performance as Kim essential to her development.<ref name=\"vulture\" /> Seehorn had already gotten an idea that Kim enjoyed participating on Jimmy's cons, a fact established in the screenplay for the fourth episode of the first season \"[[Hero (Better Call Saul)|Hero]]\", but which Seehorn had yet to see. Seehorn was able to use very subtle smiles to indicate Kim's appreciation for Jimmy during that episode, which Gould said, \"The way she played it just felt so right that it gave us a strong feeling for where we were going with her.\"<ref name=\"rs seehorn vip\"/>\n\nWith this change, the writers saw Kim no longer being as moral as planned and gave her a darker side that arose from her childhood, something that gave her a chip on her shoulder that would make her give in to more unethical approaches if it got the job done, and thus one that readily feel into work alongside Jimmy in his cons after fighting her reluctant nature to join in.<ref name=\"vulture\" /> Gould called this \"The emotional connection between these two characters had a gravitational pull that started twisting the whole story around.\"<ref name=\"rs seehorn vip\"/> This also drastically altered the direction they took Jimmy's transformation into Saul. The first season finale, \"[[Marco (Better Call Saul)|Marco]]\" shows Jimmy walking away from a potential job with the law firm Davis & Main that Kim had set up for him. Season two was to continue with Jimmy outright forgoing the job, but because the writers wanted to include Kim more based on Seehorn's performance, they altered this to show Jimmy returning and accepting the job for Kim's sake.<ref name=\"rs seehorn vip\"/>\n\nDuring the first two seasons, Kim was rarely seen without a business suit or a tight [[ponytail]], a choice made between Seehorn, Gilligan, Gould and stylist Trish Almeida to show that Kim was \"all business\". In the third season, Kim gets into a car accident, breaking her arm which in actuality would make it difficult for Kim to put up her hair in a ponytail without significant effort. At this point, as Kim's character was starting to become unraveled, Almeida and Seeborn used how tight the ponytail was set as an implicit sign of Kim's internal turmoil: when it was set tight, Kim was focused on her job, but if was loose, it meant she was struggling with sadness and worry.<ref name=\"vulture\" />\n\nGilligan has called Kim's arc through the fifth season an \"impending tragedy\", as her nearly-illegal actions are towards \"self-destructive behavior\".<ref name=\"vulture\" /> Katie Beth Hall portrays a young Kim in a flashback in \"[[Wexler v. Goodman]]\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-recaps/better-call-saul-recap-season-5-episode-6-wexler-goodman-969907/ |title=\u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Recap: Girl, Interrupted |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |date=March 23, 2020 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200401233911/https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-recaps/better-call-saul-recap-season-5-episode-6-wexler-goodman-969907/ |archive-date=April 1, 2020 |access-date=April 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Character biography ==\n=== Background ===\nBorn in 1968 (according to her driver's license in \"JMM\"), Kim was raised in several [[Nebraska]] towns, including [[Red Cloud, Nebraska|Red Cloud]], but is intentionally vague about her past. In a flashback in \"Wexler v. Goodman\", Kim as a teenager is shown to have become self-reliant due to her mother's alcoholism. In \"[[The Guy for This]]\", she claims that as a child, her mother frequently moved them from place to place to keep one step ahead of landlords to whom they owed back rent, and never had a place to call home herself. Kim further claims she moved to Albuquerque because of the limited opportunities available in her hometown. Kim worked in the mailroom at Hamlin, Hamlin and McGill (HHM), where Howard Hamlin and Chuck McGill were lead partners.  Chuck's younger brother Jimmy was employed in the mailroom because of Chuck's insistence that he work a legitimate job and rid himself of his [[con artist]] past. With HHM loaning her the money to pay for law school, she completed her education and then joined the firm as an associate.  She soon became one of HHM's top lawyers, and her success inspired Jimmy to secretly attend a distance learning law school and become an attorney.  With Kim's encouragement, Jimmy started a solo practice after HHM decided against hiring him as an associate.\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nIn the show's present (2002), Jimmy, angered by how Chuck and Howard have treated him, has run-ins with HHM, including stealing a case from them and placing a billboard ad for his firm that copies Howard's signature look, the HHM colors, and HHM's logo. Kim follows Howard's direction to talk to Jimmy, but finds Jimmy's use of con games interesting; Jimmy, suggests that she should leave HHM and set up a firm with him. The fallout from Jimmy's actions cause Kim to lose some of her standing within HHM. She becomes more disenchanted with HHM after Jimmy brings the firm a potentially multi-million dollar class-action lawsuit against the Sandpiper retirement communities, only for Chuck to use Howard in blocking Jimmy's participation on the case. When the case grows in size, HHM calls on the services of another firm, Davis & Main, and Kim recommends Jimmy to them due to his familiarity with the case and rapport with the clients. Her recommendation results in Jimmy being offered an associate's position with D&M, which would enable him to continue working on the Sandpiper case.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Marco |episode-link=Marco (Better Call Saul) |series=Better Call Saul |series-link=Better Call Saul |network=AMC |date=April 6, 2015 |season=1 |number=10}}</ref>\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nJimmy is reluctant to take the job at Davis & Main, and hides away at a luxury hotel using an assumed name and stolen credit card. Kim tracks him down and tries to convince him to take the job. Instead, Jimmy brings her in on a con, convincing another hotel patron to pay for an expensive bottle of tequila. The con is a success, and they spend the night together; Kim keeps the elaborate bottle stopper as a memento.\n\nJimmy accepts the Davis & Main job and works with Kim on the Sandpiper lawsuit. Jimmy skirts the law in soliciting Sandpiper residents to join the class, creating the potential for damage to Davis & Main's reputation among its more conservative clients.  Later, he prepares a television advertisement to attract more members for the class, and airs it without getting the approval of his D&M superiors. Kim covers for him at HHM, staining her reputation even further. Jimmy offers to quit Davis & Main if it will help restore's Kim's reputation, but she insists she reclaim her standing at the firm on her own. Kim works her law school and professional contacts in the hopes of obtaining a major new client for HHM, and succeeds in convincing a large regional bank, Mesa Verde, to retain HHM as outside counsel. Howard is happy to have the business, but denies Kim credit. Reduced to entry-level document review and arguing unwinnable motions in court, Kim's courtroom proficiency draws the attention of Richard Schweikart, a partner at Schweikart & Cokely. Schweikart tells Kim HHM is not appreciative of her talents and offers her a position at his firm. Kim considers the offer while sitting at a bar, and begins talking to a man she recognizes as a potential mark. She calls Jimmy to join her, and they successfully complete another con, followed by another night together. Kim decides to leave HHM and establish her own solo practice, with Jimmy forming a solo practice in the same office so they can share expenses. Kim tries to bring Mesa Verde with her, and appears to succeed, but Chuck wins them back to HHM. Knowing that Kim wants Mesa Verde, Jimmy tampers with important documents in one of Chuck's filings on the bank's behalf. Inconsistencies in the documents at the state banking board meeting call Chuck's competence into question.  Mesa Verde signs on with Kim, and Chuck becomes obsessed with proving Jimmy's sabotage.  Kim infers Jimmy's guilt, and tells him that if there is any evidence, Chuck will find it. Jimmy realizes the clerk at the copy store where he altered the documents can identify him, so he goes to the store to buy the clerk's silence.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nChuck becomes increasingly obsessed with proving Jimmy's sabotage and tricks him into an incriminating statement, which Chuck records. Learning of the recording from Ernesto, Kim counsels Jimmy to wait and see what Chuck intends to do with it, but Jimmy breaks into Chuck's house to confront him, enabling Chuck to have Jimmy arrested.  Jimmy faces a bar investigation, and Kim and Jimmy's strategy of exposing Chuck's [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]] as a [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] illness discredits his testimony.  Jimmy is suspended from practicing law for a year, but not disbarred.  Chuck's paranoid performance as a witness degrades his professional reputation, and HHM loses standing in Albuquerque's legal community. While Jimmy tries various ways to generate income so Kim and he can keep their shared office, Kim takes on a second client. Rushing to a meeting after little sleep, she crashes her car and breaks her arm.  To save money, Kim and Jimmy break the lease on their office and Kim practices from home, while Jimmy helps her with day-to-day activities because her arm is in a cast during her recovery.  Howard forces Chuck out of HHM, and an increasingly erratic Chuck sets a fire in his home by knocking over a camping lantern, but makes no attempt to leave.\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nFollowing Chuck's suicide, Kim tries without success to break Jimmy out of his despondent mood.  Howard tells Jimmy and Kim he thinks that his decision to force Chuck's retirement from HHM after their malpractice insurance rates rose led to Chuck's death.  Jimmy conceals his role in causing the rate increase, allows Howard to shoulder the blame, and regains his usual happy-go-lucky demeanor.  Unaware of Jimmy's actions, Kim later berates Howard for mistreating Jimmy. Kim works on Mesa Verde's rapid regional expansion, but is increasingly bored with banking law, so she begins taking ''pro bono'' criminal defense cases, which she finds more interesting and satisfying. After she is reprimanded by Paige for putting her ''pro bono'' work ahead of Mesa Verde's, Kim persuades Schweikart & Cokely to hire her as a partner to manage a new banking division, which enables her to handle the Mesa Verde work while continuing to devote time and effort to criminal defense cases.  With her career becoming more successful, she becomes more distant from Jimmy, who works a boring job as a cellular phone store manager while he serves out the suspension of his law license.\n\nBy 2004 Jimmy has a lucrative side business reselling prepaid cellular phones on the street under the alias Saul Goodman, and hires Huell Babineaux as his bodyguard.  Huell has a run-in with a police officer, who arrests him, and Jimmy convinces Kim to defend Huell to keep him from receiving a prison sentence. Finding it impossible to convince the prosecuting attorney to enter into a plea bargain, Kim and Jimmy run a con to fake a show of support for Huell in his hometown.  They keep Huell out of prison, and then engage in a con that enables Kim to replace approved plans for a Mesa Verde branch in [[Lubbock, Texas]] with plans for a larger building, saving time and expense by bypassing the city zoning and planning approval processes.  After his suspension is over, Kim helps Jimmy win reinstatement to the bar by faking remorse for Chuck's death.  He promises to do justice to the McGill name, but after winning reinstatement shocks Kim by announcing that he does not intend to practice under his own name. As Kim questions Jimmy about his plan, he tells her \"S'all good, man!\"\n\n=== Season 5 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nAs he regains his law license, Jimmy tells Kim he realized the \"Saul Goodman\" alias from his prepaid cell phone business provides an instant client base for a criminal law practice. He engages in several activities to generate publicity for his new practice, including giving away his remaining cell phones. Kim continues her ''[[pro bono]]'' work. In one case, Kim's client does not want to accept a favorable plea bargain, and Jimmy suggests a con to trick him into taking it. Kim refuses, but then runs the con herself.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Magic Man |episode-link=Magic Man (Better Call Saul) |series=Better Call Saul |series-link=Better Call Saul |network=AMC |date=February 23, 2020 |season=5 |number=1}}</ref> Kim later discusses the issue with Jimmy, and says she wants to succeed without having to lie, so Jimmy agrees not to cross ethical lines when it comes to her clients.\n\nKim is asked by Mesa Verde to try to evict Everett Acker from his leased property owned by the bank to make way for a planned call center. Kim becomes sympathetic to Acker's desire to stay, and is unable to convince Kevin Wachtell, the bank president, to accept an alternative plan for the call center that would leave Acker alone. She decides to secretly scheme with Jimmy and have him represent Acker against the bank, creating numerous loopholes and delays in the legal actions, but Kevin remains fixed on the original plans. Jimmy and Kim, as a last course of action, find \"dirt\" on the bank's history to blackmail Kevin. However, Rich confronts Kim about her lack of passion in the case and possible collusion with Jimmy, threatening to take her off the Mesa Verde account. Kim tells Jimmy they need to arrange for the previously-discussed settlement offer for Acker and stop the con. Jimmy appears to agree, but at the settlement meeting, Jimmy stuns everyone with a much larger settlement demand, and produces the blackmail material he plans to broadcast as to tarnish Mesa Verde's reputation. Kevin later meets Jimmy privately to accept a more modest settlement in line with the original agreement that still is beneficial for Acker. Kim responds furiously to Jimmy's actions for not giving any warning about what he planned to do. After initially suggesting that they separate, she proposes marriage so that they can enjoy [[spousal privilege]].<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Wexler v. Goodman |episode-link=Wexler v.

Kim and Rich apologize to Kevin for the outcome of Acker's case. He lets them know he will decide whether to retain them, but after they leave, Kim leads Rich back to Kevin's office. She points out that Kevin consistently failed to heed their advice and says that whether he retains them or hires new counsel, she hopes he will be more willing to listen. Kevin indicates his approval by informing Kim and Rich that he will see them at their regular weekly meeting.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=JMM |episode-link=JMM (Better Call Saul) |series=Better Call Saul  |series-link=Better Call Saul |network=AMC |date=March 30, 2020 |season=5 |number=7}}</ref>\n\n[[Lalo Salamanca]] is in jail after being arraigned for murder under an alias, and Jimmy represents him. Jimmy tests his new status with Kim by telling her about Lalo, including his intent not to fight for Lalo's release. Using information supplied by Mike, Jimmy wins a bail motion, and Lalo's bail is set at $7 million, which Lalo says he can pay. Lalo directs Jimmy to go to a remote desert site to pick up the cash from The Cousins. Jimmy reluctantly agrees to go and asks for $100,000, which Lalo agrees to pay. Kim attempts to persuade Jimmy not to go, telling him he is an attorney, not a \"[[bagman]]\" for drug dealers, but Jimmy reassures that it will be an easy task because no one will suspect him of being the courier. However, while returning with the cash, Jimmy is ambushed by cartel gunmen, all but one of whom are killed by Mike. Jimmy and Mike spend the next day in the desert to eliminate the remaining gunman and return the cash to Albequerque. When Jimmy does not return home as planned, Kim pretends to be Lalo's attorney to visit him in jail. She reveals that she is Jimmy's wife and asks for his location so she can search. Lalo refuses to tell her where Jimmy is, saying that he will be fine because he is a survivor above all else.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Bagman |episode-link=Bagman (Better Call Saul) |series=Better Call Saul |series-link=Better Call Saul |network=AMC |date=April 6, 2020 |season=5 |number=8}}</ref>\n\nJimmy and Mike make their way to a truck stop, where Tyrus and Victor pick them up. Mike and Jimmy agree on a cover story to tell Lalo. Jimmy posts Lalo's bail and he is released. Jimmy says he was alone and after his car broke down he walked cross-country so he would not put the money at risk. Lalo says he plans to return to Mexico to avoid the scrutiny of suspicious police and prosecutors. Jimmy tells Kim the same story he told Lalo, but Kim realizes he is lying when she sees that he saved his coffee mug, which has a bullet hole. As Kim tends to Jimmy's sunburn and bruises, she admits she visited Lalo in jail. Jimmy asks her to stay away from him so she does not become too involved in the Salamanca's business, and she agrees. Kim quits Schweikart & Cokely and hands over the Mesa Verde account, but keeps her ''pro bono''. As she departs, she takes the bottle stopper she previously kept as a souvenir. Nacho drives Lalo to the same pickup site where Jimmy received the money, but instead of waiting for The Cousins, Lalo decides to search for Jimmy's car. After finding it, Lalo directs Nacho to drive back to Albuquerque. Mike calls Jimmy to warn him just before Lalo arrives at Jimmy and Kim's apartment. As Mike trains a sniper rifle on him from a nearby rooftop, Lalo makes Jimmy repeat the story of his desert trek, then reveals that he found bullet holes in Jimmy's car. Kim tells Lalo that the car was probably shot at by passersby for fun, and berates him for not trusting Jimmy. Lalo seems satisfied with her argument and leaves.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Bad Choice Road |episode-link=Bad Choice Road |series=Better Call Saul |series-link=Better Call Saul |network=AMC |date=April 13, 2020 |season=5 |number=9}}</ref>\n\nAfter Lalo leaves, Jimmy tells Kim the truth about his ordeal in the desert, and they decide to stay at a nearby hotel until they are safe. Kim returns to the courthouse and takes on a large number of ''pro bono'' cases. While there, she encounters Howard and tells him she has quit Schweikart & Cokely. Howard tells her about Jimmy's harassment campaign against him and assumes Jimmy is responsible for Kim's decision. Kim laughs at Howard, tells him she is insulted by the idea that she cannot decide for herself, and says he doesn't understand Jimmy. Howard angrily tells her that Chuck was the only one who really understood Jimmy. At the hotel, Jimmy tells Kim that Lalo will be killed, which he learned from Mike. That night, Kim suggests they derail Howard's career in order to resolve the Sandpiper case so that Jimmy will receive his seven-figure share of the expected settlement, which Kim wants to use to start a ''pro bono'' law firm. Jimmy advises against it, but Kim makes the same finger-gun expression that Jimmy uses as Saul, indicating that she is undergoing a similar transformation and is serious about sabotaging Howard.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Something Unforgivable |episode-link=Bad Choice Road |series=Better Call Saul |series-link=Better Call Saul |network=AMC |date=April 20, 2020 |season=5 |number=10}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n[[File:Rhea Seehorn by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Rhea Seehorn]] portrays Kim Wexler.]]\nDue to Kim Wexler's popularity in ''Better Call Saul'', creator Vince Gilligan hinted at a possible spin-off about her, he also said that a Wexler spin-off is the most likely to be done, saying, \"If we were to do another spin-off it would be the Kim Wexler show\".<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\nSalon commented on Kim Wexler's role in the fourth season:\n\n{{quote|But that is precisely why Kim has become the low-key heroine of season 4.

The scene as written had minimal direction, but Seehorn, in preparing for the shot, saw a number of subtleties with the scene that suggested she knew Jimmy intimately, that she had boundaries, and she was used to cleaning up after Jimmy's mistakes. She also felt from this scene that Kim would prefer to listen before speaking and using that as a position of power. The writers saw how Seehorn acted out the scene and realizes how much more it defined the character going forward, someone that prioritized work and placed boundaries on her relationship with Jimmy but still cared for him. Gilligan considered Seehorn's ongoing performance as Kim essential to her development.<ref name=\"vulture\" /> Seehorn had already gotten an idea that Kim enjoyed participating on Jimmy's cons, a fact established in the screenplay for the fourth episode of the first season \"[[Hero (Better Call Saul)|Hero]]\", but which Seehorn had yet to see. Seehorn was able to use very subtle smiles to indicate Kim's appreciation for Jimmy during that episode, which Gould said, \"The way she played it just felt so right that it gave us a strong feeling for where we were going with her.\"<ref name=\"rs seehorn vip\"/>\n\nWith this change, the writers saw Kim no longer being as moral as planned and gave her a darker side that arose from her childhood, something that gave her a chip on her shoulder that would make her give in to more unethical approaches if it got the job done, and thus one that readily feel into work alongside Jimmy in his cons after fighting her reluctant nature to join in.<ref name=\"vulture\" /> Gould called this \"The emotional connection between these two characters had a gravitational pull that started twisting the whole story around.\"<ref name=\"rs seehorn vip\"/> This also drastically altered the direction they took Jimmy's transformation into Saul. The first season finale, \"[[Marco (Better Call Saul)|Marco]]\" shows Jimmy walking away from a potential job with the law firm Davis & Main that Kim had set up for him. Season two was to continue with Jimmy outright forgoing the job, but because the writers wanted to include Kim more based on Seehorn's performance, they altered this to show Jimmy returning and accepting the job for Kim's sake.<ref name=\"rs seehorn vip\"/>\n\nDuring the first two seasons, Kim was rarely seen without a business suit or a tight [[ponytail]], a choice made between Seehorn, Gilligan, Gould and stylist Trish Almeida to show that Kim was \"all business\". In the third season, Kim gets into a car accident, breaking her arm which in actuality would make it difficult for Kim to put up her hair in a ponytail without significant effort. At this point, as Kim's character was starting to become unraveled, Almeida and Seeborn used how tight the ponytail was set as an implicit sign of Kim's internal turmoil: when it was set tight, Kim was focused on her job, but if was loose, it meant she was struggling with sadness and worry.<ref name=\"vulture\" />\n\nGilligan has called Kim's arc through the fifth season an \"impending tragedy\", as her nearly-illegal actions are towards \"self-destructive behavior\".<ref name=\"vulture\" /> Katie Beth Hall portrays a young Kim in a flashback in \"[[Wexler v. Goodman]]\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-recaps/better-call-saul-recap-season-5-episode-6-wexler-goodman-969907/ |title=\u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Recap: Girl, Interrupted |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |date=March 23, 2020 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200401233911/https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-recaps/better-call-saul-recap-season-5-episode-6-wexler-goodman-969907/ |archive-date=April 1, 2020 |access-date=April 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Character biography ==\n=== Background ===\nBorn in 1968 (according to her driver's license in \"JMM\"), Kim was raised in several [[Nebraska]] towns, including [[Red Cloud, Nebraska|Red Cloud]], but is intentionally vague about her past. In a flashback in \"Wexler v. Goodman\", Kim as a teenager is shown to have become self-reliant due to her mother's alcoholism. In \"[[The Guy for This]]\", she claims that as a child, her mother frequently moved them from place to place to keep one step ahead of landlords to whom they owed back rent, and never had a place to call home herself. Kim further claims she moved to Albuquerque because of the limited opportunities available in her hometown. Kim worked in the mailroom at Hamlin, Hamlin and McGill (HHM), where Howard Hamlin and Chuck McGill were lead partners.  Chuck's younger brother Jimmy was employed in the mailroom because of Chuck's insistence that he work a legitimate job and rid himself of his [[con artist]] past. With HHM loaning her the money to pay for law school, she completed her education and then joined the firm as an associate.  She soon became one of HHM's top lawyers, and her success inspired Jimmy to secretly attend a distance learning law school and become an attorney.  With Kim's encouragement, Jimmy started a solo practice after HHM decided against hiring him as an associate.\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nIn the show's present (2002), Jimmy, angered by how Chuck and Howard have treated him, has run-ins with HHM, including stealing a case from them and placing a billboard ad for his firm that copies Howard's signature look, the HHM colors, and HHM's logo. Kim follows Howard's direction to talk to Jimmy, but finds Jimmy's use of con games interesting; Jimmy, suggests that she should leave HHM and set up a firm with him. The fallout from Jimmy's actions cause Kim to lose some of her standing within HHM. She becomes more disenchanted with HHM after Jimmy brings the firm a potentially multi-million dollar class-action lawsuit against the Sandpiper retirement communities, only for Chuck to use Howard in blocking Jimmy's participation on the case. When the case grows in size, HHM calls on the services of another firm, Davis & Main, and Kim recommends Jimmy to them due to his familiarity with the case and rapport with the clients. Her recommendation results in Jimmy being offered an associate's position with D&M, which would enable him to continue working on the Sandpiper case.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Marco |episode-link=Marco (Better Call Saul) |series=Better Call Saul |series-link=Better Call Saul |network=AMC |date=April 6, 2015 |season=1 |number=10}}</ref>\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nJimmy is reluctant to take the job at Davis & Main, and hides away at a luxury hotel using an assumed name and stolen credit card. Kim tracks him down and tries to convince him to take the job. Instead, Jimmy brings her in on a con, convincing another hotel patron to pay for an expensive bottle of tequila. The con is a success, and they spend the night together; Kim keeps the elaborate bottle stopper as a memento.\n\nJimmy accepts the Davis & Main job and works with Kim on the Sandpiper lawsuit. Jimmy skirts the law in soliciting Sandpiper residents to join the class, creating the potential for damage to Davis & Main's reputation among its more conservative clients.  Later, he prepares a television advertisement to attract more members for the class, and airs it without getting the approval of his D&M superiors. Kim covers for him at HHM, staining her reputation even further. Jimmy offers to quit Davis & Main if it will help restore's Kim's reputation, but she insists she reclaim her standing at the firm on her own. Kim works her law school and professional contacts in the hopes of obtaining a major new client for HHM, and succeeds in convincing a large regional bank, Mesa Verde, to retain HHM as outside counsel. Howard is happy to have the business, but denies Kim credit. Reduced to entry-level document review and arguing unwinnable motions in court, Kim's courtroom proficiency draws the attention of Richard Schweikart, a partner at Schweikart & Cokely. Schweikart tells Kim HHM is not appreciative of her talents and offers her a position at his firm. Kim considers the offer while sitting at a bar, and begins talking to a man she recognizes as a potential mark. She calls Jimmy to join her, and they successfully complete another con, followed by another night together. Kim decides to leave HHM and establish her own solo practice, with Jimmy forming a solo practice in the same office so they can share expenses. Kim tries to bring Mesa Verde with her, and appears to succeed, but Chuck wins them back to HHM. Knowing that Kim wants Mesa Verde, Jimmy tampers with important documents in one of Chuck's filings on the bank's behalf. Inconsistencies in the documents at the state banking board meeting call Chuck's competence into question.  Mesa Verde signs on with Kim, and Chuck becomes obsessed with proving Jimmy's sabotage.  Kim infers Jimmy's guilt, and tells him that if there is any evidence, Chuck will find it. Jimmy realizes the clerk at the copy store where he altered the documents can identify him, so he goes to the store to buy the clerk's silence.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nChuck becomes increasingly obsessed with proving Jimmy's sabotage and tricks him into an incriminating statement, which Chuck records. Learning of the recording from Ernesto, Kim counsels Jimmy to wait and see what Chuck intends to do with it, but Jimmy breaks into Chuck's house to confront him, enabling Chuck to have Jimmy arrested.  Jimmy faces a bar investigation, and Kim and Jimmy's strategy of exposing Chuck's [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]] as a [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] illness discredits his testimony.  Jimmy is suspended from practicing law for a year, but not disbarred.  Chuck's paranoid performance as a witness degrades his professional reputation, and HHM loses standing in Albuquerque's legal community. While Jimmy tries various ways to generate income so Kim and he can keep their shared office, Kim takes on a second client. Rushing to a meeting after little sleep, she crashes her car and breaks her arm.  To save money, Kim and Jimmy break the lease on their office and Kim practices from home, while Jimmy helps her with day-to-day activities because her arm is in a cast during her recovery.  Howard forces Chuck out of HHM, and an increasingly erratic Chuck sets a fire in his home by knocking over a camping lantern, but makes no attempt to leave.\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nFollowing Chuck's suicide, Kim tries without success to break Jimmy out of his despondent mood.  Howard tells Jimmy and Kim he thinks that his decision to force Chuck's retirement from HHM after their malpractice insurance rates rose led to Chuck's death.  Jimmy conceals his role in causing the rate increase, allows Howard to shoulder the blame, and regains his usual happy-go-lucky demeanor.  Unaware of Jimmy's actions, Kim later berates Howard for mistreating Jimmy. Kim works on Mesa Verde's rapid regional expansion, but is increasingly bored with banking law, so she begins taking ''pro bono'' criminal defense cases, which she finds more interesting and satisfying. After she is reprimanded by Paige for putting her ''pro bono'' work ahead of Mesa Verde's, Kim persuades Schweikart & Cokely to hire her as a partner to manage a new banking division, which enables her to handle the Mesa Verde work while continuing to devote time and effort to criminal defense cases.  With her career becoming more successful, she becomes more distant from Jimmy, who works a boring job as a cellular phone store manager while he serves out the suspension of his law license.\n\nBy 2004 Jimmy has a lucrative side business reselling prepaid cellular phones on the street under the alias Saul Goodman, and hires Huell Babineaux as his bodyguard.  Huell has a run-in with a police officer, who arrests him, and Jimmy convinces Kim to defend Huell to keep him from receiving a prison sentence. Finding it impossible to convince the prosecuting attorney to enter into a plea bargain, Kim and Jimmy run a con to fake a show of support for Huell in his hometown.  They keep Huell out of prison, and then engage in a con that enables Kim to replace approved plans for a Mesa Verde branch in [[Lubbock, Texas]] with plans for a larger building, saving time and expense by bypassing the city zoning and planning approval processes.  After his suspension is over, Kim helps Jimmy win reinstatement to the bar by faking remorse for Chuck's death.  He promises to do justice to the McGill name, but after winning reinstatement shocks Kim by announcing that he does not intend to practice under his own name. As Kim questions Jimmy about his plan, he tells her \"S'all good, man!\"\n\n=== Season 5 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nAs he regains his law license, Jimmy tells Kim he realized the \"Saul Goodman\" alias from his prepaid cell phone business provides an instant client base for a criminal law practice. He engages in several activities to generate publicity for his new practice, including giving away his remaining cell phones. Kim continues her ''[[pro bono]]'' work. In one case, Kim's client does not want to accept a favorable plea bargain, and Jimmy suggests a con to trick him into taking it. Kim refuses, but then runs the con herself.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Magic Man |episode-link=Magic Man (Better Call Saul) |series=Better Call Saul |series-link=Better Call Saul |network=AMC |date=February 23, 2020 |season=5 |number=1}}</ref> Kim later discusses the issue with Jimmy, and says she wants to succeed without having to lie, so Jimmy agrees not to cross ethical lines when it comes to her clients.\n\nKim is asked by Mesa Verde to try to evict Everett Acker from his leased property owned by the bank to make way for a planned call center. Kim becomes sympathetic to Acker's desire to stay, and is unable to convince Kevin Wachtell, the bank president, to accept an alternative plan for the call center that would leave Acker alone. She decides to secretly scheme with Jimmy and have him represent Acker against the bank, creating numerous loopholes and delays in the legal actions, but Kevin remains fixed on the original plans. Jimmy and Kim, as a last course of action, find \"dirt\" on the bank's history to blackmail Kevin. However, Rich confronts Kim about her lack of passion in the case and possible collusion with Jimmy, threatening to take her off the Mesa Verde account. Kim tells Jimmy they need to arrange for the previously-discussed settlement offer for Acker and stop the con. Jimmy appears to agree, but at the settlement meeting, Jimmy stuns everyone with a much larger settlement demand, and produces the blackmail material he plans to broadcast as to tarnish Mesa Verde's reputation. Kevin later meets Jimmy privately to accept a more modest settlement in line with the original agreement that still is beneficial for Acker. Kim responds furiously to Jimmy's actions for not giving any warning about what he planned to do. After initially suggesting that they separate, she proposes marriage so that they can enjoy [[spousal privilege]].<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Wexler v. Goodman |episode-link=Wexler v.

Kim and Rich apologize to Kevin for the outcome of Acker's case. He lets them know he will decide whether to retain them, but after they leave, Kim leads Rich back to Kevin's office. She points out that Kevin consistently failed to heed their advice and says that whether he retains them or hires new counsel, she hopes he will be more willing to listen. Kevin indicates his approval by informing Kim and Rich that he will see them at their regular weekly meeting.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=JMM |episode-link=JMM (Better Call Saul) |series=Better Call Saul  |series-link=Better Call Saul |network=AMC |date=March 30, 2020 |season=5 |number=7}}</ref>\n\n[[Lalo Salamanca]] is in jail after being arraigned for murder under an alias, and Jimmy represents him. Jimmy tests his new status with Kim by telling her about Lalo, including his intent not to fight for Lalo's release. Using information supplied by Mike, Jimmy wins a bail motion, and Lalo's bail is set at $7 million, which Lalo says he can pay. Lalo directs Jimmy to go to a remote desert site to pick up the cash from The Cousins. Jimmy reluctantly agrees to go and asks for $100,000, which Lalo agrees to pay. Kim attempts to persuade Jimmy not to go, telling him he is an attorney, not a \"[[bagman]]\" for drug dealers, but Jimmy reassures that it will be an easy task because no one will suspect him of being the courier. However, while returning with the cash, Jimmy is ambushed by cartel gunmen, all but one of whom are killed by Mike. Jimmy and Mike spend the next day in the desert to eliminate the remaining gunman and return the cash to Albequerque. When Jimmy does not return home as planned, Kim pretends to be Lalo's attorney to visit him in jail. She reveals that she is Jimmy's wife and asks for his location so she can search. Lalo refuses to tell her where Jimmy is, saying that he will be fine because he is a survivor above all else.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Bagman |episode-link=Bagman (Better Call Saul) |series=Better Call Saul |series-link=Better Call Saul |network=AMC |date=April 6, 2020 |season=5 |number=8}}</ref>\n\nJimmy and Mike make their way to a truck stop, where Tyrus and Victor pick them up. Mike and Jimmy agree on a cover story to tell Lalo. Jimmy posts Lalo's bail and he is released. Jimmy says he was alone and after his car broke down he walked cross-country so he would not put the money at risk. Lalo says he plans to return to Mexico to avoid the scrutiny of suspicious police and prosecutors. Jimmy tells Kim the same story he told Lalo, but Kim realizes he is lying when she sees that he saved his coffee mug, which has a bullet hole. As Kim tends to Jimmy's sunburn and bruises, she admits she visited Lalo in jail. Jimmy asks her to stay away from him so she does not become too involved in the Salamanca's business, and she agrees. Kim quits Schweikart & Cokely and hands over the Mesa Verde account, but keeps her ''pro bono''. As she departs, she takes the bottle stopper she previously kept as a souvenir. Nacho drives Lalo to the same pickup site where Jimmy received the money, but instead of waiting for The Cousins, Lalo decides to search for Jimmy's car. After finding it, Lalo directs Nacho to drive back to Albuquerque. Mike calls Jimmy to warn him just before Lalo arrives at Jimmy and Kim's apartment. As Mike trains a sniper rifle on him from a nearby rooftop, Lalo makes Jimmy repeat the story of his desert trek, then reveals that he found bullet holes in Jimmy's car. Kim tells Lalo that the car was probably shot at by passersby for fun, and berates him for not trusting Jimmy. Lalo seems satisfied with her argument and leaves.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Bad Choice Road |episode-link=Bad Choice Road |series=Better Call Saul |series-link=Better Call Saul |network=AMC |date=April 13, 2020 |season=5 |number=9}}</ref>\n\nAfter Lalo leaves, Jimmy tells Kim the truth about his ordeal in the desert, and they decide to stay at a nearby hotel until they are safe. Kim returns to the courthouse and takes on a large number of ''pro bono'' cases. While there, she encounters Howard and tells him she has quit Schweikart & Cokely. Howard tells her about Jimmy's harassment campaign against him and assumes Jimmy is responsible for Kim's decision. Kim laughs at Howard, tells him she is insulted by the idea that she cannot decide for herself, and says he doesn't understand Jimmy. Howard angrily tells her that Chuck was the only one who really understood Jimmy. At the hotel, Jimmy tells Kim that Lalo will be killed, which he learned from Mike. Kim takes this to mean they are safe, though Jimmy insists it's only \"this time.\" That night, Kim suggests they derail Howard's career in order to resolve the Sandpiper case so that Jimmy will receive his seven-figure share of the expected settlement, which Kim wants to use to start a ''pro bono'' law firm. Jimmy advises against it, but Kim makes the same finger-gun expression that Jimmy uses as Saul, indicating that she is undergoing a similar transformation and is serious about sabotaging Howard.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Something Unforgivable |episode-link=Bad Choice Road |series=Better Call Saul |series-link=Better Call Saul |network=AMC |date=April 20, 2020 |season=5 |number=10}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n[[File:Rhea Seehorn by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Rhea Seehorn]] portrays Kim Wexler.]]\nDue to Kim Wexler's popularity in ''Better Call Saul'', creator Vince Gilligan hinted at a possible spin-off about her, he also said that a Wexler spin-off is the most likely to be done, saying, \"If we were to do another spin-off it would be the Kim Wexler show\".<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\nSalon commented on Kim Wexler's role in the fourth season:\n\n{{quote|But that is precisely why Kim has become the low-key heroine of season 4.

The combination of painted surface and exaggerated depth of the support made the works deliberately and obviously three-dimensional objects \u2013 an \u2018attempt to deny the viewer the desire to see the surface as anything other than surface\u2019.<ref>(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.11. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> This composed physical presence was inherent in even the most restrained of Butcher's works, as William Packer would go on to say in his introduction to Butcher's 2005 catalogue, Carbon Candy, \u2018even when hung conventionally, flat to the wall, they remain obviously and directly physical\u2019.<ref>\u201dCarbon Candy\u201d, p.4.

The introduction of metal as a support revolutionised Butcher's creative output and his approach to the act of painting, \u2018it may just be a flat piece of metal\u2026 But they all have little nicks, edges and imperfections\u2026 the end result is an accumulation of what I have learnt about that surface\u2019.<ref name=\"Arcs\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, ER.358.jpg|thumb|left|alt=ER.358.|ER.358 Oil and resin on extruded aluminium box sections.]]\n===Philosophy and approach to painting===\n\u2018The application or subtraction of paint\u2019 in Butcher's practice is executed through the use of \u2018a metal blade drawn across the painting\u2019s surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\">\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.7. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> pulling a thin transparent monochrome of oil and resin over the metal support, \u2018this procedure is then repeated and repeated, building up a surface of accumulated residues'.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> The outcome of each painting is determined by \u2018variations in colour modulation\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> and largely \u2018by the physical characteristics of the support\u2019.<ref>Eric Butcher [https://www.ericbutcher.com/statement\u201dstatement\u201d]</ref> 'Paint is registered in vertical and horizontal bands across the surface of the metal plane, with areas of metal left unpainted and its polished face exposed to the viewer. the colour is omitted and the bare aluminium emerges. As a result two rhythms arise; on the one hand the colour fields are interrupted by sections of contrasting colour, and on the other hand we have the various degrees of paint application, which range from impasto to diaphanous. They completely cover the aluminium, yet also let it shimmer through'.<ref>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.23. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref> \n\nAlthough Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d. San Francisco Chronicle, p.E-1.</ref> Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another,<ref name=\"Baker\" /> the display articulated Butcher's increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, \u2018installation\u2019 in creating a total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object.<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> As Kenneth Baker, in his [[San Francisco Chronicle]] review, wrote of the work's interaction with the space it occupied, \u2018to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation. Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n\n===Site-specific Installations===\nEric Butcher's site-specific installations are interventions in space. Like the intimate relationship between painted surface and objects that distinguish his work, they become 'a pause in the act or a mistake in the material'<ref name=Bildwerke>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.27. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref>, 'subtle and stunning, installed in space dispersed over corners, corridors or in staircases they become architecture in motion'.<ref name=TimeTrial16>Heide, Patrick (2019). 'Time Trial', p.16. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> This methodology can be seen in the lengths, or fragments, of aluminium that 'seem to cling to the wall [in his installations]. In part driven by chance, and yet still composed according to a strict order'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> The context of these installations have become increasingly important, 'determined by aspects of its context; both its physical environment and psychological purpose'<ref name=TimeTrial>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.89. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> as Butcher says in his recent catalogue, Time Trial. 'As soon as I started to consider the intersections between surfaces and the wall, I was naturally, logically led to a consideration of the whole environmental context of the work and hence to site-specificity.'<ref name=TimeTrial /> This mirrors his approach to the objects he works with, the 'relationship between the painted surface and the object (upon which one surface has been singled out for preferential treatment), between 'surface' and 'objectness'.<ref name=TimeTrial68>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.68. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> \n\nAlthough the components of these installations appear to 'cling to the wall'<ref name=Bildwerke />, the evidence of their fixings are increasingly integral to the installation, 'how a piece fixes to the wall, its method of construction, the way in which the work is joined together and adhered to its backing; I want this to be clear and evident. Bolts and fixings are used which in some cases pierce the painted surfaces'.<ref name=TimeTrial65>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.65. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref>\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n\n===Paperworks===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, 'they repeat\nthe principle of the aluminium works in their own specific way'<ref name=Bildwerke /> introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> In these paper works, impressions of metal plates are embossed into sheets of saturated paper by running it through a printing press.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 80. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> Some sections of the plates\u2019 impressions are then highlighted by ink, whereas some sections are cut out altogether \u2013 some left purely as a trace.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\" /> 'These interventions take place separated from one another, yet may also intertwine. Through these perforations, the wall which is behind the deckle edged paper becomes a component of the work and takes on a bigger or smaller role depending on the size and quantity of perforations'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> Butcher refers to this register of trace in his paper works as speaking, metaphorically, of loss and absence.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 81. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref>\n\nShortly after the death of his father, Butcher created a series of works from gunpowder residue and clay on burnt paper. These found 'drawings' were from 'spent fireworks cartridges from a beach display [that] had been casually tossed into the sea'<ref name=richnessrightness>(2019).\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\" Carey-Kent, Paul, p.124. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>. 'Eric started to gather them up for more suitable disposal. Then he became interested in how the spent energy had left its marks, especially as those traces were \u2013 in line with the aims of his wider practice \u2013 free from the subjectivity of creative decision making'.<ref name=richnessrightness /> Butcher states how 'the absence of something no longer present coupled with enormous pressure (in the case of the embossed pieces) or heat (in the case of the firework pieces) I find very suggestive and full of implications. On a metaphorical level they speak of loss and spent energy'.<ref>\"Time Trial\"(2019). Butcher, Eric, p.139. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>\n\nIt is also apparent that the artist is re-evaluating his own resources in his use of paper, taking environmental concerns into the work itself. As he says in the Time Trial catalogue, '[in] trying to consume less, tread more lightly on the planet, it would be curiously contradictory not to impose the same logic of questioning on my work. Aluminium production is an energy intensive business, so I am increasingly using recycled and reused materials'.<ref>\"Time Trial\"(2019). Butcher, Eric, p.124.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines)<ref>[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" {{ISSN|1749-9267}}.</ref>, which was themed to coincide with the show.\n\n\n==Further reading==\n*Butcher Shines at Toomey Tourell, Kenneth Baker, San Francisco Chronicle, pg.

Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> pulling a thin transparent monochrome of oil and resin over the metal support, \u2018this procedure is then repeated and repeated, building up a surface of accumulated residues'.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> The outcome of each painting is determined by \u2018variations in colour modulation\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> and largely \u2018by the physical characteristics of the support\u2019.<ref>Eric Butcher [https://www.ericbutcher.com/statement\u201dstatement\u201d]</ref> 'Paint is registered in vertical and horizontal bands across the surface of the metal plane, with areas of metal left unpainted and its polished face exposed to the viewer. the colour is omitted and the bare aluminium emerges. As a result two rhythms arise; on the one hand the colour fields are interrupted by sections of contrasting colour, and on the other hand we have the various degrees of paint application, which range from impasto to diaphanous. They completely cover the aluminium, yet also let it shimmer through'.<ref>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.23. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref> \n\nAlthough Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d. San Francisco Chronicle, p.E-1.</ref> Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another,<ref name=\"Baker\" /> the display articulated Butcher's increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, \u2018installation\u2019 in creating a total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object.<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> As Kenneth Baker, in his [[San Francisco Chronicle]] review, wrote of the work's interaction with the space it occupied, \u2018to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation. Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n\n===Site-specific Installations===\nEric Butcher's site-specific installations are interventions in space. Like the intimate relationship between painted surface and objects that distinguish his work, they become 'a pause in the act or a mistake in the material'<ref name=Bildwerke>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.27. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref>, 'subtle and stunning, installed in space dispersed over corners, corridors or in staircases they become architecture in motion'.<ref name=TimeTrial16>Heide, Patrick (2019). 'Time Trial', p.16. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> This methodology can be seen in the lengths, or fragments, of aluminium that 'seem to cling to the wall [in his installations]. In part driven by chance, and yet still composed according to a strict order'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> The context of these installations have become increasingly important, 'determined by aspects of its context; both its physical environment and psychological purpose'<ref name=TimeTrial>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.89. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> as Butcher says in his recent catalogue, Time Trial. 'As soon as I started to consider the intersections between surfaces and the wall, I was naturally, logically led to a consideration of the whole environmental context of the work and hence to site-specificity.'<ref name=TimeTrial /> This mirrors his approach to the objects he works with, the 'relationship between the painted surface and the object (upon which one surface has been singled out for preferential treatment), between 'surface' and 'objectness'.<ref name=TimeTrial68>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.68. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> \n\nAlthough the components of these installations appear to 'cling to the wall'<ref name=Bildwerke />, the evidence of their fixings are increasingly integral to the installation, 'how a piece fixes to the wall, its method of construction, the way in which the work is joined together and adhered to its backing; I want this to be clear and evident. Bolts and fixings are used which in some cases pierce the painted surfaces'.<ref name=TimeTrial65>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.65. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref>\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n\n===Paperworks===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, 'they repeat\nthe principle of the aluminium works in their own specific way'<ref name=Bildwerke /> introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> In these paper works, impressions of metal plates are embossed into sheets of saturated paper by running it through a printing press.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 80. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> Some sections of the plates\u2019 impressions are then highlighted by ink, whereas some sections are cut out altogether \u2013 some left purely as a trace.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\" /> 'These interventions take place separated from one another, yet may also intertwine. Through these perforations, the wall which is behind the deckle edged paper becomes a component of the work and takes on a bigger or smaller role depending on the size and quantity of perforations'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> Butcher refers to this register of trace in his paper works as speaking, metaphorically, of loss and absence.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 81. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref>\n\nShortly after the death of his father, Butcher created a series of works from gunpowder residue and clay on burnt paper. These found 'drawings' were from 'spent fireworks cartridges from a beach display [that] had been casually tossed into the sea'<ref name=richnessrightness>(2019).\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\" Carey-Kent, Paul, p.124. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>. 'Eric started to gather them up for more suitable disposal. Then he became interested in how the spent energy had left its marks, especially as those traces were \u2013 in line with the aims of his wider practice \u2013 free from the subjectivity of creative decision making'.<ref name=richnessrightness /> Butcher states how 'the absence of something no longer present coupled with enormous pressure (in the case of the embossed pieces) or heat (in the case of the firework pieces) I find very suggestive and full of implications. On a metaphorical level they speak of loss and spent energy'.<ref>\"Time Trial\"(2019). Butcher, Eric, p.139. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>\n\nIt is also apparent that the artist is re-evaluating his own resources in his use of paper, taking environmental concerns into the work itself. As he says in the Time Trial catalogue, '[in] trying to consume less, tread more lightly on the planet, it would be curiously contradictory not to impose the same logic of questioning on my work. Aluminium production is an energy intensive business, so I am increasingly using recycled and reused materials'.<ref>\"Time Trial\"(2019). Butcher, Eric, p.124.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines)<ref>[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" {{ISSN|1749-9267}}.</ref>, which was themed to coincide with the show.\n\n\n==Further reading==\n*Butcher Shines at Toomey Tourell, Kenneth Baker, San Francisco Chronicle, pg.
