Some {{convert|8|mi}} in length, it runs from [[Hulme End]] {{nowrap|({{coord|53.1307|-1.8480|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=Manifold Way (Hulme End trailhead)}})}} in the north to [[Waterhouses, Staffordshire|Waterhouses]] {{nowrap|({{coord|53.0480|-1.8654|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=Manifold Way (Waterhouses trailhead)}})}} in the south, mostly through the [[Manifold Valley]] and the valley of its only tributary, the [[River Hamps]], following the route of the former [[Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway]], a {{RailGauge|2ft6in}} gauge line which closed in 1934 after a short life.\n\nThe Manifold Way was opened in July 1937 by Staffordshire County Council after the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]] handed over the trackbed to them. Tarmacked throughout, and with only a slight downhill gradient from north to south, the path is also ideal for wheelchair users, prams, etc. However, for about {{convert|1+1/2|mi}}, near [[Wetton, Staffordshire|Wetton Mill]], the route is shared with motor traffic where the B-road has been diverted along its route.  This section includes Swainsley tunnel.\n\nUnlike other nearby walk- and cycleways, such as the [[Tissington Trail]] and the [[High Peak Trail]], which cross elevated areas of the [[Peak District]], the Manifold Way follows the valley bottoms and is altogether more sheltered.  The path passes through attractive scenery, and indeed tourism was one of the reasons for the original construction of the line.  Popular locations along the route include [[Thor's Cave]], the mill at [[Wetton Hill]] and [[Beeston Tor]].  A little to the east lies [[Dovedale]], a better-known beauty spot.\n\nThe Manifold Way does not pass through any significant centres of population; indeed it was once described by a railway worker as a line that started in the middle of nowhere, and ended up in the same place.  Whilst the railway did serve villages and hamlets along its route, these were mostly located about a mile above the valley, a fact which contributed to the railway's ultimate demise.\n\nWhilst walking along the Manifold Way the rivers [[River Manifold|Manifold]] and [[River Hamps|Hamps]] are never far away - in fact there are dozens of small bridges crossing them. However, over the summer months the River Manifold disappears down a [[Sinkhole|swallet]] or sink hole near Wetton Mill, to reappear some distance way, at [[Ilam, Staffordshire|Ilam]].\n\nIn all there were ten stations and halts along the line.  Most had some sort of waiting room, and also a siding, but were only small affairs.  The sites of the halts can be seen today, and there is also some evidence of the loading platforms, especially at [[Ecton, Staffordshire|Ecton]], where the dairy provided much business for the railway.\n\nThe valley-bottom nature of the Manifold Way offers much to see in the way of [[flora]] and [[fauna]], and animal wildlife.  Apart from the official Manifold Way route itself, the area also lends itself to many circular walking routes which utilize the route.\n\nThe Manifold Way passes through some areas which comprise the [[South Peak Estate]], land holdings owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].\n\nAt Hulme End, the old station building has been restored as a visitor centre, and the cafe/shop at Wetton Mill is a popular spot.

{"title_page": "V12 engine", "text_new": "{{short description|Piston engine with 12 cylinders in vee configuration}}\n{{Other uses|V12 (disambiguation)}}\n[[File:Porsche 3512 engine rear-left 2019 Prototyp Museum.jpg|thumb|right |1991 [[Porsche 3512]] Formula One engine]]\n\nA '''V12 engine''' is a twelve-cylinder [[Internal_combustion_engine#Reciprocating_engines|piston engine]] where two banks of six cylinders are arranged in a [[V engine|V configuration]] around a common crankshaft. V12 engines are more common than V10 engines, however they are less common than V8 engines.\n\nThe first V12 engine was built in 1904 for use in racing boats. Due to the balanced nature of the engine and the smooth delivery of power, V12 engines were popular in early luxury automobiles, boats, aircraft and tanks. V12 engines reached their apogee during World War II, following which they were mostly replaced by jet engines. In Formula One racing, V12 engines were popular during the late 1960s and early 1990s.\n\nThe most common use of V12 engines in the 21st century has been marine engines, large stationary engines and European sports/luxury cars.\n\n== Design ==\n=== Balance and smoothness ===\nEach bank of a V12 engine essentially functions as a [[straight-six engine]], which by itself has perfect primary and secondary [[engine balance]]. By using the correct V-angle, a V12 engine can therefore have perfect balance. The even [[firing order]] for a four-stroke V12 engine has an interval of 60 degrees, therefore a V12 engine can be perfectly balanced if a V-angle of 60 degrees, 120 degrees or 180 degrees is used. Many V12 engines use a V-angle of 60 degrees between the two banks of cylinders.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nunney |first=Malcolm James |title=Light and Heavy Vehicle Technology |edition=Fourth |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |year=2007 |pages=13\u201314 |isbn= 978-0-7506-8037-0}}</ref> V12 engines with other V-angles have been produced, sometimes using split [[crankpin]]s to reduce the unbalanced vibrations. The drawback of a V12 engine is the extra cost, complexity and friction losses compared with engines containing fewer cylinders.\n\nAt any given time, three of the cylinders in a V12 engine are in their power stroke, which increases the smoothness of the power delivery by eliminating gaps between power pulses.\n\nA V12 engine with a 180 degree V-angle is often called a [[flat-twelve engine]] (or a 'boxer twelve'), however this terminology is incorrect for the majority of 180-degree V12 engines, since they use shared crankpins and are therefore not configured as flat engines.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/rolls-royce-condor-ia-v-12-engine|title=Rolls-Royce Condor IA, V-12 Engine|date=2016-03-10|work=National Air and Space Museum|access-date=2017-05-24|language=en}}</ref>\n\nTheoretically, the rotating parts of a V12 racing engine could be lighter than a crossplane V8 engine of similar displacement, due to the V12 engine not requiring counterweights on the crankshaft or as much inertial mass for the flywheel. In addition, the exhaust system of a V12 engine is much simpler than would be required for a crossplane V8 engine to achieve pulsed exhaust gas tuning. However, use of V12 engines in motor racing is uncommon in the 21st century.\n\n=== Size and displacement ===\nA 60-degree V12 engine is typically narrower than a 90-degree V6 or V8 engine of similar displacement. However, the V12 engine is usually longer than V6 and V8 engines. The added length often makes it difficult to fit a V12 engine into a passenger car, however the length is not typically a problem for trucks engines and stationary engines. Due to its narrower width, the V12 is common in locomotive, armoured tank and marine engines. In these applications, the width of the engine is constrained by tight [[Loading gauge|railway clearances]] or [[Lane|street widths]], while the length of the vehicle is more flexible.\n\nIn twin-propeller boats, two V12 engines can be narrow enough to sit side-by-side, while three V12 engines are sometimes used in high-speed three-propeller configurations. Large, fast cruise ships can have six or more V12 engines. In historic piston-engine fighter and bomber aircraft, the long, narrow V12 configuration used in high-performance aircraft made them more streamlined than other engines, particularly the short, wide [[radial engine]].\n\n== Usage in marine vessels ==\n[[File:V-12 D\u00f6rwald marine motor.JPG|thumb |1904 Craig-D\u00f6rwald racing boat engine]]\n[[File:Two Main Engines, V12.jpg|thumb|right|Two large marine engines]]\n\nThe first V-engine (a V-twin design) was built by [[Gottlieb_Daimler#First_Daimler-Maybach_automobile_built_(1889)|Daimler]] in 1889,<ref>{{cite web |title=Legend 1: 1.5 PS Daimler two-cylinder engine. |url=https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/classic/museum/1-5-hp-daimler-two-cylinder-engine/ |website=www.mercedes-benz.com |accessdate=13 February 2020 |language=en}}</ref> then the first V8 engine was built by [[Antoinette (manufacturer)|Antoinette]] in 1903.

As in many marine engines, the camshaft could be slid longitudinally to engage a second set of [[cam]]s, giving valve timing that reversed the engine's rotation to achieve [[astern propulsion]].<ref>M. D\u00f6rwald,'' The Automobile Commercial Vehicle Review'', August 1904).</ref> The engine had a displacement of {{convert|1120|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} a weight of {{convert|950|lbs|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}} and developed {{convert|150|bhp|kW|abbr=on|order=flip}}.

The production version was rated at {{convert|225|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} at 2,000 rpm, making it the most powerful airplane engine in Great Britain at the outbreak of World War I.<ref name=\"Ludvigsen\"/> During and after World War I, various companies in the United States produced the [[Liberty L-12]] engine. In Austria, the [[Austro Daimler]] V12 engines were used by the large flying boats of the Naval Air Force and produced up to {{convert|345|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}. By the end of World War I, V12s were well established in aviation, powering some of the newest and largest fighter and bomber airplanes.\n\nAfter World War I, many [[Zeppelin]]s used V12 engines built by [[Maybach]] and [[Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft|Daimler]]. V12 engines powered the first transatlantic crossings by the Curtiss NC flying boats (using four Liberty L-12 engines), the first non-stop transatlantic crossing in a Vickers Vimy (using two [[Rolls-Royce Eagle]] engines) and the first transatlantic crossing by an airship in the R-34 class airship (using five [[Sunbeam Maori]] engines).\n\n=== 1940s to present ===\n[[File:YorkMerlin.JPG|thumb|1946 [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] airplane engine in an [[Avro York]]]]\nV12 engines reached their apogee during [[World War II]] with engines such as the British [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] and [[Rolls-Royce Griffon]], the Soviet [[Klimov VK-107]] and [[Mikulin AM-38]], the American [[Allison V-1710 engine|Allison V-1710]], and the German [[Daimler-Benz DB 600]] and [[Junkers#Junkers Jumo|Junkers Jumo]]. These engines generated about {{convert |1000|hp|kW|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the beginning of the war and over {{convert|1500|hp|kW|abbr=on|order=flip}} at their ultimate evolution stage. This rapid increase in power outputs was due to technology such as multi-speed [[supercharger]]s and high [[Octane rating|octane]] fuels, and the V12 layout was commonly adopted due to its low vibrations so that the powerful engines did not tear apart the light airframes of fighters.  \n\nThe Allied forces used V12 engines with an \"upright\" design, however many German engines (aside from the [[BMW VI]], which was designed prior to World War II) used an [[Inline engine (aeronautics)#Inverted engine|inverted engine]] design, which had a lower centre of gravity and improved pilot visibility for single-engined designs. The only American-design inverted V12 engine of any type to see even limited service in World War II was the air-cooled [[Ranger V-770]], which was used in aircraft that were only used for training purposes within the United States, such as the [[Fairchild AT-21 Gunner]].\n\nThe Rolls-Royce Merlin V12 engine was used in several British aircraft including the [[Hawker Hurricane]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighters, and the [[Avro Lancaster]] and [[de Havilland Mosquito]] bombers. The Hurricane and Spitfire playing a vital role in the Battle of Britain. The long, narrow configuration of the V12 contributed to good aerodynamics, while its smoothness allowed its use with relatively light and fragile airframes.\n\nIn the United States, the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine was produced under license by Packard Motor Car Company, which was used in the [[P-51 Mustang]] fighter. This engine was also incorporated into some models of the Curtiss P-40, specifically the P-40F and P-40L. Packard Merlins powered Canadian-built Hurricane, Lancaster, and Mosquito aircraft, as well as the UK-built [[Supermarine Spitfire (late Merlin powered variants)|Spitfire Mark XVI]], which was otherwise the same as the Mark IX with its British-built Merlin. The [[Allison V-1710]] was the liquid-cooled V12 engine designed in the United States that was used on active service during World War II. It was initially used in the [[P-38 Lightning]], however the [[turbosupercharger]] system required bulky ductwork and had poor high-altitude performance. In 1943, a version using a more conventional mechanical [[supercharger]] began production.\n\nAfter World War II, V12 engines became generally obsolete in aircraft due to the introduction of [[turbojet]] and [[turboprop]] engines that had more power for their weight, and fewer complications.\n\n== Usage in automobiles ==\n{{Listen|filename=Pagani Zonda R.ogg|title=Pagani Zonda R|type=sound|style=float:right;clear:none}}\nIn automobiles, V12 engines are less common than engines with fewer cylinders, due to their size, complexity and cost. They have been mostly used in expensive sports and luxury cars thanks to their power, smooth operation and distinctive sound.\n\n===1910s ===\n[[File:1916Packard1-35TownCarLimoKimballEngine.jpg|thumb|right|1916 [[Packard#1906\u20131930|Packard Twin Six]] engine]]\n\nOne of the earliest recorded uses of V12 engines in automobiles was in October 1913, when a custom-built racing car competed at the Brooklands circuit in the United Kingdom. The car was entered by [[Louis Coatalen]], who was chief engineer of the Sunbeam Motor Car Company. It was named 'Toodles V' (after Coatalen's pet name for his wife) and achieved several speed records in 1913 and 1914.<ref name=\"Ludvigsen\"/> The V12 engine had a displacement of {{convert|9.0|L|cuin|0|abbr=on}}, an aluminum crankcase, iron cylinders with L-shaped combustion chambers, a cam-in-block valvetrain and a V-angle of 60 degrees. Each bank of the engine consisted of two cylinder blocks with three cylinders each. Valve clearance was set by grinding the relevant parts, the engine lacking any easy means of adjustment. This reflected the intention for the engine to be later used in aircraft, since any adjustment method that could go wrong in flight was to be avoided. As initially built, the V12 was rated at {{convert|200|bhp|kW|-1|abbr=on|order=flip}} at 2,400 rpm and weighed approximately {{convert|750|lb|kg|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}.\n\nAmongst the first production cars to use a V12 engine were the 1915 [[Packard#1906\u20131930|Packard Twin Six]],<ref>{{cite web |title=1915 Packard Twin Six |url=https://larzanderson.org/history/the-collection/1915-packard-twin-six/ |website=www.larzanderson.org |accessdate=21 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Counting to Twelve: The Packard Twelve and Twin Six |url=https://ateupwithmotor.com/model-histories/packard-twelve-twin-six-history/ |website=www.ateupwithmotor.com |accessdate=21 February 2020 |date=26 June 2010}}</ref> the 1915  ''National'' V12 engine{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} and the 1917 [[Weidely Motors Company|Weidely Pathfinder]];<ref>{{cite web |title=The Great Pathfinder \u2013 \u201cKing of the Twelves\u201d |url=http://theoldmotor.com/?p=106867 |website=www.theoldmotor.com |accessdate=21 February 2020}}</ref> all of which were built in the United States. \n\n=== 1920s to 1930s ===\n[[File:1931Cadillac370AcoupeV12-engine.jpg|thumb|right |1931 [[Cadillac_V-12#Series_370_(1931\u20131935)|Cadillac Series 370A]] engine]]\n\nUsage of V12 engines in luxury cars increased from the 1920s,<ref>{{cite book |last= Georgano |first= G.N. |author-link= G.N.

The first V12 engine used in Formula One was in the 1964 [[Honda RA271]] racing car, and continued through to the 1968 [[Honda RA301]] racing car. The 1966 season saw V12 engines become popular, with new V12 engines from Ferrari, Maserati and Weslake. Ferrari's engine debuted in the [[Ferrari 312]] racing car and was used up to the 1975 [[Ferrari 312B]], after which Ferrari switched to a flat-twelve engine. Maserati's engine was introduced in the [[Cooper T81]] and was used until the 1969 [[Cooper T86]]. The Weslake V12 engine was used from 1966-1968 and was introduced in the [[Eagle Mk1]] racing car. BRM produced V12 engines from the 1968 [[BRM P133]] racing car until the 1977 [[BRM P207]]. The [[Matra Sports V12 engine]] was introduced in the 1968 ''Matra MS11'' racing car and used until the 1978 [[Ligier JS9]]. Few V12 engines were used in the following decade, with the exception of the Alfa Romeo V12 which was first used by the 1979 [[Brabham BT48]] and used by Alfa Romeo until the 1982 [[Alfa Romeo 182]].\n\nA resurgence of V12 engines in Formula One began in 1989, with the introduction of the [[Ferrari 640]] racing car. Ferrari continued to use V12 engines until the 1995 [[Ferrari 412 T2]] became the last Formula One car to use a V12 engine. The [[Lamborghini V12#Formula One|Lamborghini LE3512]] engine was used by various teams between 1989 and 1993. The ''Honda RA122-E'' engine was first used in the 1991 [[McLaren MP4/6]] and was raced until the 1992 [[McLaren MP4/7A]]. The ''Yamaha OX99'' engine was used in the 1990 [[Brabham BT59]] through to the 1992 [[Brabham BT60]].\n\nIn prototype sports car racing, the highly successful 2006-2008 [[Audi R10 TDI]] used a diesel twin-turbo V12 engine.

V12 engines are more common than V10 engines, however they are less common than V8 engines.\n\nThe first V12 engine was built in 1904 for use in racing boats. Due to the balanced nature of the engine and the smooth delivery of power, V12 engines were popular in early luxury automobiles, boats, aircraft and tanks. V12 engines reached their apogee during World War II, following which they were mostly replaced by jet engines. In Formula One racing, V12 engines were popular during the late 1960s and early 1990s.\n\nThe most common use of V12 engines in the 21st century has been marine engines, large stationary engines and European sports/luxury cars.\n\n== Design ==\n=== Balance and smoothness ===\nEach bank of a V12 engine essentially functions as a [[straight-six engine]], which by itself has perfect primary and secondary [[engine balance]]. By using the correct V-angle, a V12 engine can therefore have perfect balance. The even [[firing order]] for a four-stroke V12 engine has an interval of 60 degrees, therefore a V12 engine can be perfectly balanced if a V-angle of 60 degrees, 120 degrees or 180 degrees is used. Many V12 engines use a V-angle of 60 degrees between the two banks of cylinders.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nunney |first=Malcolm James |title=Light and Heavy Vehicle Technology |edition=Fourth |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |year=2007 |pages=13\u201314 |isbn= 978-0-7506-8037-0}}</ref> V12 engines with other V-angles have been produced, sometimes using split [[crankpin]]s to reduce the unbalanced vibrations. The drawback of a V12 engine is the extra cost, complexity and friction losses compared with engines containing fewer cylinders.\n\nAt any given time, three of the cylinders in a V12 engine are in their power stroke, which increases the smoothness of the power delivery by eliminating gaps between power pulses.\n\nA V12 engine with a 180 degree V-angle is often called a [[flat-twelve engine]] (or a 'boxer twelve'), however this terminology is incorrect for the majority of 180-degree V12 engines, since they use shared crankpins and are therefore not configured as flat engines.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/rolls-royce-condor-ia-v-12-engine|title=Rolls-Royce Condor IA, V-12 Engine|date=2016-03-10|work=National Air and Space Museum|access-date=2017-05-24|language=en}}</ref>\n\nTheoretically, the rotating parts of a V12 racing engine could be lighter than a crossplane V8 engine of similar displacement, due to the V12 engine not requiring counterweights on the crankshaft or as much inertial mass for the flywheel. In addition, the exhaust system of a V12 engine is much simpler than would be required for a crossplane V8 engine to achieve pulsed exhaust gas tuning. However, use of V12 engines in motor racing is uncommon in the 21st century.\n\n=== Size and displacement ===\nA 60-degree V12 engine is typically narrower than a 90-degree V6 or V8 engine of similar displacement. However, the V12 engine is usually longer than V6 and V8 engines. The added length often makes it difficult to fit a V12 engine into a passenger car, however the length is not typically a problem for trucks engines and stationary engines. Due to its narrower width, the V12 is common in locomotive, armoured tank and marine engines. In these applications, the width of the engine is constrained by tight [[Loading gauge|railway clearances]] or [[Lane|street widths]], while the length of the vehicle is more flexible.\n\nIn twin-propeller boats, two V12 engines can be narrow enough to sit side-by-side, while three V12 engines are sometimes used in high-speed three-propeller configurations. Large, fast cruise ships can have six or more V12 engines. In historic piston-engine fighter and bomber aircraft, the long, narrow V12 configuration used in high-performance aircraft made them more streamlined than other engines, particularly the short, wide [[radial engine]].\n\n== Usage in marine vessels ==\n[[File:V-12 D\u00f6rwald marine motor.JPG|thumb |1904 Craig-D\u00f6rwald racing boat engine]]\n[[File:Two Main Engines, V12.jpg|thumb|right|Two large marine engines]]\n\nThe first V-engine (a V-twin design) was built by [[Gottlieb_Daimler#First_Daimler-Maybach_automobile_built_(1889)|Daimler]] in 1889,<ref>{{cite web |title=Legend 1: 1.5 PS Daimler two-cylinder engine. |url=https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/classic/museum/1-5-hp-daimler-two-cylinder-engine/ |website=www.mercedes-benz.com |accessdate=13 February 2020 |language=en}}</ref> then the first V8 engine was built by [[Antoinette (manufacturer)|Antoinette]] in 1903.

The production version was rated at {{convert|225|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} at 2,000 rpm, making it the most powerful airplane engine in Great Britain at the outbreak of World War I.<ref name=\"Ludvigsen\"/> During and after World War I, various companies in the United States produced the [[Liberty L-12]] engine. In Austria, the [[Austro Daimler]] V12 engines were used by the large flying boats of the Naval Air Force and produced up to {{convert|345|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}. By the end of World War I, V12s were well established in aviation, powering some of the newest and largest fighter and bomber airplanes.\n\nAfter World War I, many [[Zeppelin]]s used V12 engines built by [[Maybach]] and [[Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft|Daimler]]. V12 engines powered the first transatlantic crossings by the Curtiss NC flying boats (using four Liberty L-12 engines), the first non-stop transatlantic crossing in a Vickers Vimy (using two [[Rolls-Royce Eagle]] engines) and the first transatlantic crossing by an airship in the R-34 class airship (using five [[Sunbeam Maori]] engines).\n\n=== 1940s to present ===\n[[File:YorkMerlin.JPG|thumb|1946 [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] airplane engine in an [[Avro York]]]]\nV12 engines reached their apogee during [[World War II]] with engines such as the British [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] and [[Rolls-Royce Griffon]], the Soviet [[Klimov VK-107]] and [[Mikulin AM-38]], the American [[Allison V-1710 engine|Allison V-1710]], and the German [[Daimler-Benz DB 600]] and [[Junkers#Junkers Jumo|Junkers Jumo]]. These engines generated about {{convert |1000|hp|kW|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the beginning of the war and over {{convert|1500|hp|kW|abbr=on|order=flip}} at their ultimate evolution stage. This rapid increase in power outputs was due to technology such as multi-speed [[supercharger]]s and high [[Octane rating|octane]] fuels, and the V12 layout was commonly adopted due to its low vibrations so that the powerful engines did not tear apart the light airframes of fighters.  \n\nThe Allied forces used V12 engines with an \"upright\" design, however many German engines (aside from the [[BMW VI]], which was designed prior to World War II) used an [[Inline engine (aeronautics)#Inverted engine|inverted engine]] design, which had a lower centre of gravity and improved pilot visibility for single-engined designs. The only American-design inverted V12 engine of any type to see even limited service in World War II was the air-cooled [[Ranger V-770]], which was used in aircraft that were only used for training purposes within the United States, such as the [[Fairchild AT-21 Gunner]].\n\nThe Rolls-Royce Merlin V12 engine was used in several British aircraft including the [[Hawker Hurricane]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighters, and the [[Avro Lancaster]] and [[de Havilland Mosquito]] bombers. The Hurricane and Spitfire playing a vital role in the Battle of Britain. The long, narrow configuration of the V12 contributed to good aerodynamics, while its smoothness allowed its use with relatively light and fragile airframes.\n\nIn the United States, the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine was produced under license by Packard Motor Car Company, which was used in the [[P-51 Mustang]] fighter. This engine was also incorporated into some models of the Curtiss P-40, specifically the P-40F and P-40L. Packard Merlins powered Canadian-built Hurricane, Lancaster, and Mosquito aircraft, as well as the UK-built [[Supermarine Spitfire (late Merlin powered variants)|Spitfire Mark XVI]], which was otherwise the same as the Mark IX with its British-built Merlin. The [[Allison V-1710]] was the liquid-cooled V12 engine designed in the United States that was used on active service during World War II. It was initially used in the [[P-38 Lightning]], however the [[turbosupercharger]] system required bulky ductwork and had poor high-altitude performance. In 1943, a version using a more conventional mechanical [[supercharger]] began production.\n\nAfter World War II, V12 engines became generally obsolete in aircraft due to the introduction of [[turbojet]] and [[turboprop]] engines that had more power for their weight, and fewer complications.\n\n== Usage in automobiles ==\n{{Listen|filename=Pagani Zonda R.ogg|title=Pagani Zonda R|type=sound|style=float:right;clear:none}}\nIn automobiles, V12 engines are less common than engines with fewer cylinders, due to their size, complexity and cost. They have been mostly used in expensive sports and luxury cars thanks to their power, smooth operation and distinctive sound.\n\n===1910s ===\n[[File:1916Packard1-35TownCarLimoKimballEngine.jpg|thumb|right|1916 [[Packard#1906\u20131930|Packard Twin Six]] engine]]\n\nOne of the earliest recorded uses of V12 engines in automobiles was in October 1913, when a custom-built racing car competed at the Brooklands circuit in the United Kingdom. The car was entered by [[Louis Coatalen]], who was chief engineer of the Sunbeam Motor Car Company. It was named 'Toodles V' (after Coatalen's pet name for his wife) and achieved several speed records in 1913 and 1914.<ref name=\"Ludvigsen\"/> The V12 engine had a displacement of {{convert|9.0|L|cuin|0|abbr=on}}, an aluminum crankcase, iron cylinders with L-shaped combustion chambers, a cam-in-block valvetrain and a V-angle of 60 degrees. Each bank of the engine consisted of two cylinder blocks with three cylinders each. Valve clearance was set by grinding the relevant parts, the engine lacking any easy means of adjustment. This reflected the intention for the engine to be later used in aircraft, since any adjustment method that could go wrong in flight was to be avoided. As initially built, the V12 was rated at {{convert|200|bhp|kW|-1|abbr=on|order=flip}} at 2,400 rpm and weighed approximately {{convert|750|lb|kg|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}.\n\nAmongst the first production cars to use a V12 engine were the 1915 [[Packard#1906\u20131930|Packard Twin Six]],<ref>{{cite web |title=1915 Packard Twin Six |url=https://larzanderson.org/history/the-collection/1915-packard-twin-six/ |website=www.larzanderson.org |accessdate=21 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Counting to Twelve: The Packard Twelve and Twin Six |url=https://ateupwithmotor.com/model-histories/packard-twelve-twin-six-history/ |website=www.ateupwithmotor.com |accessdate=21 February 2020 |date=26 June 2010}}</ref> the 1915  ''National'' V12 engine{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} and the 1917 [[Weidely Motors Company|Weidely Pathfinder]];<ref>{{cite web |title=The Great Pathfinder \u2013 \u201cKing of the Twelves\u201d |url=http://theoldmotor.com/?p=106867 |website=www.theoldmotor.com |accessdate=21 February 2020}}</ref> all of which were built in the United States. \n\n=== 1920s to 1930s ===\n[[File:1931Cadillac370AcoupeV12-engine.jpg|thumb|right |1931 [[Cadillac_V-12#Series_370_(1931\u20131935)|Cadillac Series 370A]] engine]]\n\nUsage of V12 engines in luxury cars increased from the 1920s,<ref>{{cite book |last= Georgano |first= G.N. |author-link= G.N.

The first V12 engine used in Formula One was in the 1964 [[Honda RA271]] racing car, and continued through to the 1968 [[Honda RA301]] racing car. The 1966 season saw V12 engines become popular, with new V12 engines from Ferrari, Maserati and Weslake. Ferrari's engine debuted in the [[Ferrari 312]] racing car and was used up to the 1975 [[Ferrari 312B]], after which Ferrari switched to a flat-twelve engine. Maserati's engine was introduced in the [[Cooper T81]] and was used until the 1969 [[Cooper T86]]. The Weslake V12 engine was used from 1966-1968 and was introduced in the [[Eagle Mk1]] racing car. BRM produced V12 engines from the 1968 [[BRM P133]] racing car until the 1977 [[BRM P207]]. The [[Matra Sports V12 engine]] was introduced in the 1968 ''Matra MS11'' racing car and used until the 1978 [[Ligier JS9]]. Few V12 engines were used in the following decade, with the exception of the Alfa Romeo V12 which was first used by the 1979 [[Brabham BT48]] and used by Alfa Romeo until the 1982 [[Alfa Romeo 182]].\n\nA resurgence of V12 engines in Formula One began in 1989, with the introduction of the [[Ferrari 640]] racing car. Ferrari continued to use V12 engines until the 1995 [[Ferrari 412 T2]] became the last Formula One car to use a V12 engine. The [[Lamborghini V12#Formula One|Lamborghini LE3512]] engine was used by various teams between 1989 and 1993. The ''Honda RA122-E'' engine was first used in the 1991 [[McLaren MP4/6]] and was raced until the 1992 [[McLaren MP4/7A]]. The ''Yamaha OX99'' engine was used in the 1990 [[Brabham BT59]] through to the 1992 [[Brabham BT60]].\n\nIn prototype sports car racing, the highly successful 2006-2008 [[Audi R10 TDI]] used a diesel twin-turbo V12 engine. The [[Peugeot 908 HDi FAP]], introduced in 2007, also used a diesel twin-turbo V12 engine.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\" caption=\"Formula One engines\">\nFile:Lambo V12 F1.JPG |1989-1993 [[Lamborghini_V12#Formula_One|Lamborghini LE3512]]\nFile:Honda RA121E engine front Honda Collection Hall.jpg |1991 [[Honda_in_Formula_One#Spirit,_Williams,_Lotus,_McLaren_and_Tyrrell_(1983\u20131992)|Honda RA121E]]\nFile:Matra MS11 (3).jpg |1968 [[Matra MS11]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Usage in trucks ==\n[[File:1960 GMC V12 702cid.JPG|thumb|1961 [[GMC_V6_engine#702|GMC Twin Six]] engine]]\n\nSeveral truck manufacturers have produced V12 diesel engines at various times. For example, the 1967-1982 [[Tatra T813]], built in Czechoslovakia, used a {{convert|17.6|L|cuin|0|abbr=on}} [[naturally aspirated]] V12 diesel engine, and the 1983-present [[Tatra T815]] is available with a {{convert|19.0|L|cuin|0|abbr=on}} V12 diesel engine in both naturally aspirated and turbocharged forms. In the United States, V12 versions of the 1938-1995 [[Detroit Diesel Series 71]], the 1967-1999 [[Detroit Diesel Series 149]] and the 1974-1995 [[Detroit Diesel Series 92]] were produced.\n\nTrucks using V12 gasoline (petrol) engines are rare, however several were produced in the United States from the 1930s until the 1970s. In 1931, ''American La France'' began producing firetrucks with V12 gasoline engines based on the ''Lycoming BB motor''. In 1935, the V12 engine used by the [[Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Company|Pierce Arrow]] luxury car was fitted to firetrucks built by Seagrave (with production continuing until 1970, since Seagrave purchased the equipment to manufacture the Pierce Arrow engines themselves). The 1960-1965 [[GMC_V6_engine#702|GMC Twin Six]] {{convert |702|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} gasoline V12 engine was basically the ''GMC 351'' V6 engine, doubled, with four rocker covers and four exhaust manifolds.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mort|first=Norm|title=American Trucks of the 1960s|year=2010|publisher=Veloce |isbn = 978-1-84584-228-4 |pages=41\u201344|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lM_mr0ihODcC&pg=PA42&dq=GMC+twin+six+702 |accessdate=6 October 2010}}</ref> Peak power was only {{convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, however peak torque was {{convert|585|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}.\n{{clear right}}\n\n== Usage in railway locomotives ==\nMany [[diesel locomotive]]s use V12 engines.

Since then the method has been extended to other models in one dimension: the (anisotropic) Heisenberg chain (XXZ model), the Lieb-Liniger interacting [[Bose gas]], the [[Hubbard model]], the [[Kondo model]], the [[Anderson impurity model]], the Richardson model etc.\n\n==Discussion==\nIn the framework of many-body [[quantum mechanics]], models solvable by the Bethe ansatz can be contrasted with free fermion models. One can say that the dynamics of a free model is one-body reducible: the many-body wave function for [[fermions]] ([[bosons]]) is the anti-symmetrized (symmetrized) product of one-body wave functions. Models solvable by the Bethe ansatz are not free: the two-body sector has a non-trivial [[S-matrix|scattering matrix]], which in general depends on the momenta.\n\nOn the other hand, the dynamics of the models solvable by the Bethe ansatz is two-body reducible: the many-body scattering matrix is a product of two-body scattering matrices. Many-body collisions happen as a sequence of two-body collisions and the many-body wave function can be represented in a form which contains only elements from two-body wave functions. The many-body scattering matrix is equal to the product of pairwise scattering matrices.\n\nThe generic form the Bethe ansatz for a many-body wavefunction is\n\n<math>\n\\Psi_M(j_1, \\cdots, j_M) = \\prod_{M \\geq a > b \\geq 1} \\text{sgn}(j_a - j_b) \\sum_{P \\in P_M} (-1)^{[P]} e^{i \\sum_{a=1}^M k_{P_a} j_a + \\frac{i}{2}\\sum_{M \\geq a > b \\geq 1} \\text{sgn}(j_a - j_b) \\phi(k_{P_a}, k_{P_b})}\n</math> \n\nin which <math>M</math> is the number of particles, <math>j_a, a=1, \\cdots M</math> their position, <math>P_M</math> is the set of all permutations of the integers <math>1, \\cdots, M</math>, <math>k_a</math> is the (quasi-)momentum of the <math>a</math>-th particle, <math>\\phi</math> is the scattering phase shift function and <math>sgn</math> is the sign function. This form is universal (at least for non-nested systems), with the momentum and scattering functions being model-dependent.\n\nThe [[Yang\u2013Baxter equation]] guarantees consistency of the construction. The [[Pauli exclusion principle]] is valid for models solvable by the Bethe ansatz, even for models of interacting [[bosons]].\n\nThe [[ground state]] is a [[Fermi surface|Fermi sphere]]. [[Periodic boundary conditions]] lead to the Bethe ansatz equations. In logarithmic form the Bethe ansatz equations can be generated by the [[Chen Nin Yang|Yang action]].

{"title_page": "Mask (computing)", "text_new": "{{Unreferenced|date=October 2019}}\n{{Redirect|Signal masking||Masking (disambiguation)}}\n\nIn [[computer science]], a '''mask''' or '''bitmask''' is data that is used for [[bitwise operation]]s, particularly in a [[bit field]]. Using a mask, multiple bits in a [[byte]], [[nibble]], [[Word (computer architecture)|word]] etc. can be set either on, off or inverted from on to off (or vice versa) in a single bitwise operation.\n\n==Common bitmask functions==\n\n===Masking bits to <code>1</code>===\nTo turn certain bits on, the [[Logical disjunction|bitwise <code>OR</code>]] operation can be used, following [[Logical disjunction#Bitwise operation|the principle]] that <code>Y OR 1 = 1</code> and <code>Y OR 0 = Y</code>. Therefore, to make sure a bit is on, <code>OR</code> can be used with a <code>1</code>. To leave a bit unchanged, <code>OR</code> is used with a <code>0</code>.\n\nExample: Masking ''on'' the higher [[nibble]] (bits 4, 5, 6, 7) the lower nibble (bits 0, 1, 2, 3) unchanged. \n     '''1001'''0101   '''1010'''0101\n  OR '''1111'''0000   '''1111'''0000\n   = '''1111'''0101   '''1111'''0101\n\n===Masking bits to <code>0</code>===\nMore often in practice bits are \"masked ''off''\" (or masked to <code>0</code>) than \"masked ''on''\" (or masked to <code>1</code>). When a bit is <code>AND</code>ed with a 0, the result is always 0, i.e. <code>Y AND 0 = 0</code>. To leave the other bits as they were originally, they can be <code>AND</code>ed with <code>1</code>, since <code>Y AND 1 = Y</code>.\n\nExample: Masking ''off'' the higher [[nibble]] (bits 4, 5, 6, 7) the lower nibble (bits 0, 1, 2, 3) unchanged. \n     '''1010'''0101   '''1010'''0101\n AND '''0000'''1111   '''0000'''1111\n   = '''0000'''0101   '''0000'''0101\n\n===Querying the status of a bit===\nIt is possible to use bitmasks to easily check the state of individual bits regardless of the other bits. To do this, turning off all the other bits using the bitwise <code>AND</code> is done as discussed [[#Masking bits to 0|above]] and the value is compared with <code>1</code>. If it is equal to <code>0</code>, then the bit was off, but if the value is any other value, then the bit was on. What makes this convenient is that it is not necessary to figure out what the value actually is, just that it is not <code>0</code>.\n\nExample: Querying the status of the 4th bit\n     1001'''1'''101   1001'''0'''101\n AND 0000'''1'''000   0000'''1'''000\n   = 0000'''1'''000   0000'''0'''000\n\n===Toggling bit values===\nSo far the article has covered how to turn bits on and turn bits off, but not both at once. Sometimes it does not really matter what the value is, but it must be made the opposite of what it currently is. This can be achieved using the [[Exclusive or|<code>XOR</code> (exclusive or)]] operation. <code>XOR</code> returns <code>1</code> [[if and only if]] an [[odd number]] of bits are <code>1</code>. Therefore, if two corresponding bits are <code>1</code>, the result will be a <code>0</code>, but if only one of them is <code>1</code>, the result will be <code>1</code>. Therefore inversion of the values of bits is done by <code>XOR</code>ing them with a <code>1</code>. If the original bit was <code>1</code>, it returns <code>1 XOR 1 = 0</code>. If the original bit was <code>0</code> it returns <code>0 XOR 1 = 1</code>. Also note that <code>XOR</code> masking is bit-safe, meaning that it will not affect unmasked bits because <code>Y XOR 0 = Y</code>, just like an <code>OR</code>.\n\nExample: Toggling bit values\n     10011101   10010101\n XOR '''00001111   11111111'''\n   = 10010010   01101010\n\nTo write arbitrary 1s and 0s to a subset of bits, first write 0s to that subset, then set the high bits:\n\n   register = (register & ~bitmask) | value;\n\n==Uses of bitmasks==\n\n=== Arguments to functions ===\nIn programming languages such as [[C (language)|C]], bit fields are a useful way to pass a set of named boolean arguments to a function. For example, in the graphics API [[OpenGL]], there is a command, <code>glClear()</code> which clears the screen or other buffers. It can clear up to four buffers (the color, depth, accumulation, and [[stencil buffer]]s), so the API authors could have had it take four arguments. But then a call to it would look like\n<source lang=\"c\"> glClear(1,1,0,0); // This is not how glClear actually works and would make for unstable code.</source>\nwhich is not very descriptive. Instead there are four defined field bits, <code>GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT</code>, <code>GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT</code>, <code>GL_ACCUM_BUFFER_BIT</code>, and <code>GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT</code> and <code>glClear()</code> is declared as\n<source lang=\"c\"> void glClear(GLbitfield bits);</source>\nThen a call to the function looks like this\n<source lang=\"c\"> glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);</source>\nInternally, a function taking a bitfield like this can use binary <code>and</code> to extract the individual bits. For example, an implementation of <code>glClear()</code> might look like:\n<source lang=\"c\">\nvoid glClear(GLbitfield bits) {\n  if ((bits & GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT) != 0) {\n    // Clear color buffer.\n  }\n  if ((bits & GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT) != 0) {\n    // Clear depth buffer.\n  }\n  if ((bits & GL_ACCUM_BUFFER_BIT) != 0) {\n    // Clear accumulation buffer.\n  }\n  if ((bits & GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT) != 0) {\n    // Clear stencil buffer.\n  }\n}</source>\nThe advantage to this approach is that function argument overhead is decreased. Since the minimum datum size is one byte, separating the options into separate arguments would be wasting seven bits per argument and would occupy more stack space. Instead, functions typically accept one or more 32-bit integers, with up to 32 option bits in each. While elegant, in the simplest implementation this solution is not [[type safety|type-safe]]. A <code>GLbitfield</code> is simply defined to be an <code>unsigned int</code>, so the compiler would allow a meaningless call to <code>glClear(42)</code> or even <code>glClear(GL_POINTS)</code>. In [[C++]] an alternative would be to create a class to encapsulate the set of arguments that glClear could accept and could be cleanly encapsulated in a library (see the external links for an example).\n\n===Inverse masks===\nMasks are used with IP addresses in IP ACLs (Access Control Lists) to specify what should be permitted and denied. To configure IP addresses on interfaces, masks start with 255 and have the large values on the left side: for example, IP address 209.165.202.129 with a 255.255.255.224 mask. Masks for IP ACLs are the reverse: for example, mask 0.0.0.255. This is sometimes called an inverse mask or a [[wildcard mask]]. When the value of the mask is broken down into binary (0s and 1s), the results determine which address bits are to be considered in processing the traffic. A 0 indicates that the address bits must be considered (exact match); a 1 in the mask is a \"don't care\". This table further explains the concept.\n\nMask example:\n\nnetwork address (traffic that is to be processed) \t\n10.1.1.0\n\nmask\t\n0.0.0.255\n\nnetwork address (binary)\t\n00001010.00000001.00000001.00000000\n\nmask (binary)\t\n00000000.00000000.00000000.11111111\n\nBased on the binary mask, it can be seen that the first three sets ([[Octet (computing)|octets]]) must match the given binary network address exactly (00001010.00000001.00000001). The last set of numbers is made of \"don't cares\" (.11111111). Therefore, all traffic that begins with 10.1.1. matches since the last octet is \"don't care\". Therefore, with this mask, network addresses 10.1.1.1 through 10.1.1.255 (10.1.1.x) are processed.\n\nSubtract the normal mask from 255.255.255.255 in order to determine the ACL inverse mask. In this example, the inverse mask is determined for network address 172.16.1.0 with a normal mask of 255.255.255.0.\n\n255.255.255.255 - 255.255.255.0 (normal mask) = 0.0.0.255 (inverse mask)\n\nACL equivalents\n\nThe source/source-wildcard of 0.0.0.0/255.255.255.255 means \"any\".\n\nThe source/wildcard of 10.1.1.2/0.0.0.0 is the same as \"host 10.1.1.2\"\n\n===Image masks===\n{{see also|Bit blit|Clipping path}}\n[[Image:Blit dot.gif|thumb|[[Raster graphics|Raster graphic]] [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s (left) and masks (right)]]\nIn [[computer graphics]], when a given image is intended to be placed over a background, the transparent areas can be specified through a binary mask. This way, for each intended image there are actually two [[bitmap]]s: the actual image, in which the  unused areas are given a [[pixel]] value with all [[bit]]s set to 0s, and an additional ''mask'', in which the correspondent image areas are given a pixel value of all bits set to 0s and the surrounding areas a value of all bits set to 1s. In the sample at right, black pixels have the all-zero bits and white pixels have the all-one bits.\n\nAt [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]], to put the image on the screen over the background, the program first masks the screen pixel's bits with the image mask at the desired coordinates using the [[bitwise AND]] operation. This preserves the background pixels of the transparent areas while resets with zeros the bits of the pixels which will be obscured by the overlapped image.\n\nThen, the program renders the image pixel's bits by combining them with the background pixel's bits using the [[Logical disjunction|bitwise OR]] operation. This way, the image pixels are appropriately placed while keeping the background surrounding pixels preserved. The result is a perfect compound of the image over the background.\n\n[[Image:Sprite rendering by binary image mask.png|center]]\n\nThis technique is used for painting pointing device cursors, in typical 2-D videogames for characters, bullets and so on (the [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s), for [[GUI]] [[Icon (computing)|icon]]s, and for video titling and other image mixing applications.\n\nAlthough related (due to being used for the same purposes), [[Palette (computing)#Transparent color in palettes|transparent color]]s and [[alpha channel]]s are techniques which do not involve the image pixel mixage by binary masking.\n\n===Hash tables===\nTo create a hashing function for a [[hash table]], often a function is used that has a large domain. To create an index from the output of the function, a modulo can be taken to reduce the size of the domain to match the size of the array; however, it is often faster on many processors to restrict the size of the hash table to powers of two sizes and use a bitmask instead.\n\nAn example of both modulo and masking in C:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\n#include <stdint.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main(void) {\n    const uint32_t NUM_BUCKETS = 0xFFFFFFFF;  // 2^32\n    const uint32_t MAX_RECORDS = 1<<10;  // 2^10\n    const uint32_t HASH_BITMASK = 0x3FF;  // (2^10)-1\n\n    char **token_array = NULL;\n    // Handle memory allocation for token_array\u2026\n\n    char token[] = \"some hashable value\";\n    uint32_t hashed_token = hash_function(token, strlen(token), NUM_BUCKETS);\n\n    // Using modulo\n    size_t index = hashed_token % MAX_RECORDS;\n\n    // OR\n\n    // Using bitmask\n    size_t index = hashed_token & HASH_BITMASK;\n\n    *(token_array+index) = token;\n\n    // Free the memory from token_array \u2026\n    return 0;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Affinity mask]]\n*[[Bit field]]\n*[[Bit manipulation]]\n*[[Bitwise operation]]\n*[[Subnetwork]]\n*[[Tagged pointer]]\n*[[umask]]\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://bitbucket.org/fudepan/mili/wiki/BitwiseEnums bit_enum: a type-safe C++ library for bitwise operations]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[Category:Binary arithmetic]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mask (Computing)}}\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=October 2019}}\n{{Redirect|Signal masking||Masking (disambiguation)}}\n\nIn [[computer science]], a '''mask''' or '''bitmask''' is data that is used for [[bitwise operation]]s, particularly in a [[bit field]].

To create an index from the output of the function, a modulo can be taken to reduce the size of the domain to match the size of the array; however, it is often faster on many processors to restrict the size of the hash table to powers of two sizes and use a bitmask instead.\n\nAn example of both modulo and masking in C:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\n#include <stdint.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main(void) {\n    const uint32_t NUM_BUCKETS = 0xFFFFFFFF;  // 2^32\n    const uint32_t MAX_RECORDS = 1<<10;  // 2^10\n    const uint32_t HASH_BITMASK = 0x3FF;  // (2^10)-1\n\n    char **token_array = NULL;\n    // Handle memory allocation for token_array\u2026\n\n    char token[] = \"some hashable value\";\n    uint32_t hashed_token = hash_function(token, strlen(token), NUM_BUCKETS);\n\n    // Using modulo\n    size_t index = hashed_token % MAX_RECORDS;\n\n    // OR\n\n    // Using bitmask\n    size_t index = hashed_token & HASH_BITMASK;\n\n    *(token_array+index) = token;\n\n    // Free the memory from token_array \u2026\n    return 0;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Affinity mask]]\n*[[Bit field]]\n*[[Bit manipulation]]\n*[[Bitwise operation]]\n*[[Subnetwork]]\n*[[Tagged pointer]]\n*[[umask]]\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://bitbucket.org/fudepan/mili/wiki/BitwiseEnums bit_enum: a type-safe C++ library for bitwise operations]\n\n[[Category:Binary arithmetic]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mask (Computing)}}\n", "name_user": "Dashingdang", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added a source/referece", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask_(computing)"}
