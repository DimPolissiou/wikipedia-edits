Among the municipalities in Quezon Province, Candelaria has the most desiccated coconut factories and oil refineries, such as Peter Paul Philippine Corporation, Primex Coco Products Inc., Pacific Royal Basic Foods, SuperStar Corporation, Tongsan Industrial Development Corporation, and others, which employ thousands of people.\n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation===\nPrior to 1885, the pioneering barangays of Candelaria in its western part, Taguan (Bukal), Kinatihan and Masin were parts of the Municipality of Tiaong, while Malabanban, Mangilag and Santa Catalina in the east, were under the jurisdiction of the town of Sariaya.\nSr. Don Ciriaco Nadres, a local leader of Barangay Masinand his wife Sra. Do\u00f1a Baltazara Bustamante, with the support of Don Simeon Nadres and wife Do\u00f1a Everista Ona, Don Justo Argao, Don Elino de Gala, Don Apolinario Gonzales, Don Tomas Cabu\u00f1ag, Don Ignacio de Ramos, Don Domingo de Alday, Don Tomas Regidor, Don Juan del Valle, Don Ambrocio Salazar, Don Buenaventura Cede\u00f1o and Don Hipolito Martinez, proposed the establishment of an independent government over these barangays. They became known as the founding families of the town.\nIt was on December 26, 1878, that a permit was granted by the Governor General of the Philippine Islands, Domingo Moriones y Murillo for the establishment of an independent government over these barangays. Its boundaries were fixed by means of a treaty signed by the notable leaders of Tiaong, Sariaya and the founding families of Candelaria.\n\nThe King of Spain, His Majesty Alfonso XII, finally approved the establishment of Candelaria as an independent town on August 5, 1879.\n\n===American Era and Japanese Occupation===\nIn 1902, after the cessation of the general hostilities against the Americans, administration of Candelaria was merged with the neighboring town of Sariaya. In 1908, after less than seven years, Candelaria was again managed independently, as a fourth-class municipality. During the American regime, the town progressed by leaps and bounds. Many houses and public edifices were constructed, and commerce and industries grew, until the Japanese invasion brought a further wave of destruction.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Candelaria,Quezonjf1680 13.JPG|thumb|right|Taguan River (bridge)]]\nThe municipality lies at the western part of Quezon Province, about 108 kilometers from the nation's capital, [[Manila]] and 23 kilometers from the provincial capital, [[Lucena, Philippines|Lucena City]]. To its northern part lies the famous [[Mount Banahaw]], to the east is the town of [[Sariaya, Quezon|Sariaya]], to the south is [[San Juan, Batangas]], and to the west are the towns of [[Dolores, Quezon|Dolores]] and [[Tiaong, Quezon|Tiaong]]. The neighboring cities are [[Lucena, Philippines|Lucena]], [[Tayabas]], [[San Pablo City, Laguna|San Pablo]] and [[Lipa City, Batangas|Lipa City]]. It is traversed by the [[Pan Philippine Highway]] and the [[Philippine National Railways]].\n\nCandelaria has an area of about 12,910 hectares and is an agricultural municipality, situated in the southern part of Mount Banahaw. The town proper is wedged by two rivers, namely, Masin and Quiapo rivers.\n\n==Barangays==\n\nCandelaria is politically subdivided into 25 [[barangay]]s, listed here with their respective Barangay Captains and population as of 2015:\n\n{| class = \"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Since 2005, Monsignor Carlos (Charles) Pedro A. Herrera, the parish priest, started his devotion to Nuestra Senora de Candelaria and honored her with a Candle Festival every February 2. The celebration was concluded with a procession through the streets of the town featuring the street dancing by the youth of the community in honor of the Blessed Virgin.  A parade of floats representing each of the 25 barangays was, also, featured during the festivities.\n\nA project in honor of the Blessed Mother Mary that will renovate the patio of the San Pedro Bautista Parish Church had been developed on April 22, 2012.  The renovated patio will convert the current parking lot into a multi-purpose open amphitheater for use of the people of Candelaria.  It will provide a venue for children and toddlers playground, jogging/walking path, a rosary garden, a via Dolorosa, and a stage for performances complete with controlled theater lighting.  The playground will be lit with lighting standards.  The fundraising for the project will be accomplished through a 1000 Points of Light campaign where each point of light will be represented by a Candelarian or friends of Candelaria contributing Php5000 or more.  Inauguration is scheduled for February 2, 2013, CANDLE FESTIVAL celebration.  Ground breaking is targeted for August 4, 2012, ARAW NG CANDELARIA.  The community project is expecting every Candelarians around the world to step up and bring their \"POINT OF LIGHT\".  The SPBPC parish council for economic affairs is taking the lead with Dr. Al Cornejo at the helm.\n\n==Local government==\n[[File:Candelaria,Quezonjf1933 02.JPG|thumb|right|Town hall]]\nElected officials (2019-2022):\n* '''Mayor''': Macario D.

Do\u00f1a Baltazara Bustamante, with the support of Don Simeon Nadres and wife Do\u00f1a Everista Ona, Don Justo Argao, Don Elino de Gala, Don Apolinario Gonzales, Don Tomas Cabu\u00f1ag, Don Ignacio de Ramos, Don Domingo de Alday, Don Tomas Regidor, Don Juan del Valle, Don Ambrocio Salazar, Don Buenaventura Cede\u00f1o and Don Hipolito Martinez, proposed the establishment of an independent government over these barangays. They became known as the founding families of the town.\nIt was on December 26, 1878, that a permit was granted by the Governor General of the Philippine Islands, Domingo Moriones y Murillo for the establishment of an independent government over these barangays. Its boundaries were fixed by means of a treaty signed by the notable leaders of Tiaong, Sariaya and the founding families of Candelaria.\n\nThe King of Spain, His Majesty Alfonso XII, finally approved the establishment of Candelaria as an independent town on August 5, 1879.\n\n===American Era and Japanese Occupation===\nIn 1902, after the cessation of the general hostilities against the Americans, administration of Candelaria was merged with the neighboring town of Sariaya. In 1908, after less than seven years, Candelaria was again managed independently, as a fourth-class municipality. During the American regime, the town progressed by leaps and bounds. Many houses and public edifices were constructed, and commerce and industries grew, until the Japanese invasion brought a further wave of destruction.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Candelaria,Quezonjf1680 13.JPG|thumb|right|Taguan River (bridge)]]\nThe municipality lies at the western part of Quezon Province, about 108 kilometers from the nation's capital, [[Manila]] and 23 kilometers from the provincial capital, [[Lucena, Philippines|Lucena City]]. To its northern part lies the famous [[Mount Banahaw]], to the east is the town of [[Sariaya, Quezon|Sariaya]], to the south is [[San Juan, Batangas]], and to the west are the towns of [[Dolores, Quezon|Dolores]] and [[Tiaong, Quezon|Tiaong]]. The neighboring cities are [[Lucena, Philippines|Lucena]], [[Tayabas]], [[San Pablo City, Laguna|San Pablo]] and [[Lipa City, Batangas|Lipa City]]. It is traversed by the [[Pan Philippine Highway]] and the [[Philippine National Railways]].\n\nCandelaria has an area of about 12,910 hectares and is an agricultural municipality, situated in the southern part of Mount Banahaw.

Since 2005, Monsignor Carlos (Charles) Pedro A. Herrera, the parish priest, started his devotion to Nuestra Senora de Candelaria and honored her with a Candle Festival every February 2. The celebration was concluded with a procession through the streets of the town featuring the street dancing by the youth of the community in honor of the Blessed Virgin.  A parade of floats representing each of the 25 barangays was, also, featured during the festivities.\n\nA project in honor of the Blessed Mother Mary that will renovate the patio of the San Pedro Bautista Parish Church had been developed on April 22, 2012.

It will provide a venue for children and toddlers playground, jogging/walking path, a rosary garden, a via Dolorosa, and a stage for performances complete with controlled theater lighting.  The playground will be lit with lighting standards.  The fundraising for the project will be accomplished through a 1000 Points of Light campaign where each point of light will be represented by a Candelarian or friends of Candelaria contributing Php5000 or more.  Inauguration is scheduled for February 2, 2013, CANDLE FESTIVAL celebration.  Ground breaking is targeted for August 4, 2012, ARAW NG CANDELARIA.

Vancouver Royal Canadians [[Association football|soccer]] club. The club played in the [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|North American Soccer League]] (NASL) at [[Empire Stadium (Vancouver)|Empire Stadium]] in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].\n\nFollowing the 1967 season, the USA and the FIFA-blacklisted [[National Professional Soccer League (1967)|National Professional Soccer League]] merged to form the [[North American Soccer League (1968\u20131984)|North American Soccer League]].<ref name=\"Merge\">{{cite news|author=[[Associated Press]]|title=20 cities picked for soccer loop|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 14, 1967|page=80}}</ref><ref name=\"Litterer\">{{cite web |url=http://homepages.sover.net/~spectrum/year/1968.html |title=The Year in American Soccer - 1968 |first=David |last=Litterer |date=January 31, 2010 |work=American Soccer Archives |accessdate=February 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150726055314/http://homepages.sover.net/~spectrum/year/1968.html |archive-date=July 26, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The merger meant that teams from the predecessor leagues competing against each other in the same markets needed to be moved, combined, or folded.  As part of this process, George Fleharty bought the Vancouver Royal Canadians from E.G. Eakins and folded his NPSL team, the [[San Francisco Golden Gate Gales]].<ref name=\"Merge\"/>  The new owner shortened the name to Vancouver Royals and chose player-coach [[Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s]] over future England manager [[Bobby Robson]], the previous owner's new manager for the Vancouver Royals; he resigned when offered the demotion to assistant manager.<ref name=\"Litterer\"/>  The 1968 Vancouver Royals' roster was put together without the preparation or advantage of importing an entire team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.funwhileitlasted.net/2013/03/29/1967-1968-vancouver-royal-canadians-vancouver-royals/ |title=1967-1968 Vancouver Royal Canadians / Vancouver Royals |first=Andy|last=Crossley|year=2013|work=Fun While It Lasted|accessdate=February 6, 2014}}</ref>  A significant amount of the team was recruited by Bobby Robson including two brothers from Hong Kong playing in England. Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s also brought in several Europeans, a few players with connections to the Golden Gate Gaels, as well as at least two local players from local leagues. A few foreign players settled in Vancouver after their playing careers including [[Peter Dinsdale]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasljerseys.com/Rosters/Royals_Rosters.htm#1967|title=Vancouver Royals|first=Dave|last=Morrison|accessdate=February 6, 2014}}</ref>\nThe Vancouver Royals had the third highest average attendance in the league at 6,197.  The club folded after the [[1968 North American Soccer League season|1968 season]] as the NASL contracted from seventeen clubs to five for the [[1969 North American Soccer League season|1969 NASL season]]. The five remaining teams were located roughly in the US Midwest with one team on the east coast.\n\n== Coaches ==\n\n*{{flagicon|England}} [[Bobby Robson]]\n*{{flagicon|Hungary}} {{flagicon|Spain}} [[Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s]]\n\n== Players ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Num\n!Name\n!Pos\n!Height\n!Weight\n!Apps\n!G\n!A\n|-\n| 1|| Chris Varnavas {{flagicon|Cyprus}}||G||183  ||77  ||26 ||0  ||0\n|-\n|2||[[Bobby Cram]] {{flagicon|England}} ||D|| 180||78 ||32||2||0\n|-\n|3|| [[Ger Lagendijk|Gerrit Lagendijk]] {{flagicon|Holland}}||D||173||73 ||5 || 1||0\n|-\n|4 || Antonio Collar {{flagicon|Spain}} ||M||180||76 ||20||0||0\n|-\n| 5|| Tomas Krivitz {{flagicon|Hungary}} ||D||175||77||25||0||0\n|-\n|6||[[Peter Dinsdale]] {{flagicon|England}}||D||180||80||30||0||0\n|-\n|7|| Lajos Vicek {{flagicon|Yugoslavia}} ||F||170||67||15||2||0\n|-\n|8|| Janos Hanek {{flagicon|Hungary}}||F||173||74||12||3||0\n|-\n|9||[[John Green (footballer, born 1939)|John Green]] {{flagicon|England}} ||F||175 ||68 ||25||4||0\n|-\n|10||[[Cheung Chi Doy]] {{flagicon|British Hong Kong}} ||F||173||71||11||2||0\n|-\n|11||[[Koulis Apostolidis|Kirk Apostolidis]] {{flagicon|Greece}}||F||178||77||7||0||0\n|-\n|11||Leif Claesson {{flagicon|Sweden}}||F||183||79||16||3||0\n|-\n|12||[[Cheung Chi Wai]] {{flagicon|British Hong Kong}} ||F||170||69||32||2||0\n|-\n|13|| Mirko Casic {{flagicon|Yugoslavia}} ||  ||  || ||2||0||0\n|-\n|13||Atilla Sandor {{flagicon|Germany}}||F||170||63||1||0||0\n|-\n|14|| Brian \"Pat\" O'Connell {{flagicon|England}}||F||173||72||27||6||0\n|-\n|15||Henry Hill {{flagicon|England}} ||D||175||75||3||0||0\n|-\n|16|| Gyorgy Liptak {{flagicon|Hungary}} ||D||178||83||12||0||0\n|-\n|17||  Jose Arranz {{flagicon|Spain}}||F||175||76||4||0||0\n|-\n|17|| [[Ike MacKay]]  {{flagicon|Canada}}||F||183||79||15||2||0\n|-\n|18|| Joaquin Rey {{flagicon|Spain}} ||M||178||72||22||4||0\n|-\n|19|| Jean-Pierre Chaillat {{flagicon|Hungary}}||F||165||70||2||0||0\n|-\n|20||Gary Delong {{flagicon|USA}}||G||178||71||9||0||0\n|-\n|21||Henry Klein {{flagicon|Luxembourg}}||F||180||79||26||20||4\n|-\n| ||Ken Pears {{flagicon|Canada}}||G|| ||  ||0||0||0\n|-\n| ||Reg Stratton {{flagicon|England}} ||F|| || ||4||0||0\n|}\n<small> Num = Number, Pos = Position, Height in cm, Weight in kg, Apps = Appearances, G = Goals, A = Assists</small>\n\n== Results ==\n\n=== Standings ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:17em\"| Pacific Division!!W!!L!!T!!GF!!GA!!Pts\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#ccf;\"\n| align=left |'''[[San Diego Toros]]'''||18||8||6||65||38||'''186'''\n|- align=center\n| align=left |'''[[Oakland Clippers]]'''||18||8||6||71||38||'''185'''\n|- align=center\n| align=left |'''[[Los Angeles Wolves]]'''||11||13||8||55||52||'''139'''\n|- align=center\n| align=left |'''[[Vancouver Royals]]'''||12||15||5||51||60||'''136'''\n|}\n\n=== Results by round ===\n{{#invoke:sports rbr table|table|legendpos=b\n|header=Round\n|label1= Ground\n| res1=[[Toronto Falcons|H]]/[[Baltimore Bays|H]]/[[New York Generals|H]]/[[St. Louis Stars (soccer)|A]]/[[Detroit Cougars (soccer)|A]]/[[Atlanta Chiefs|H]]/[[Chicago Mustangs (1967\u201368)|H]]/[[San Diego Toros|A]]/[[Oakland Clippers|H]]/[[Kansas City Spurs|H]]/[[Los Angeles Wolves|A]]/[[Kansas City Spurs|A]]/[[St. Louis Stars (soccer)|A]]/[[San Diego Toros|H]]/[[Oakland Clippers|H]]/[[St. Louis Stars (soccer)|H]]/[[Kansas City Spurs|H]]/[[Los Angeles Wolves|H]]/[[Oakland Clippers|A]]/[[Dallas Tornado|H]]/[[Boston Beacons|A]]/[[Cleveland Stokers|A]]/[[Toronto Falcons|A]]/[[San Diego Toros|H]]/[[Houston Stars|H]]/[[Oakland Clippers|A]]/[[Los Angeles Wolves|H]]/[[Washington Whips|H]]/[[San Diego Toros|A]]/[[Dallas Tornado|A]]/[[Los Angeles Wolves|A]]/[[Houston Stars|A]]\n|label2= Result\n| res2=W/W/W/L/L/W/D/L/L/D/W/L/D/L/D/L/W/W/L/W/L/W/L/L/W/L/W/L/L/W/L/D\n<!-- -->\n|text_H=Home|text_A=Away\n|color_W=green2|text_W=Win\n|color_D=yellow2|text_D=Draw\n|color_L=red2|text_L=Loss\n\n|updated=complete\n|source=[http://soccerstats.us/c/north-american-soccer-league/ soccerstats.us]\n|date=March 2012\n}}\n\n=== Match results ===\n\n{{footballbox collapsible\n|round = 1\n|date= April 7, 1968\n|time= \n|team1= [[Vancouver Royals]]\n|score= 4 -

The majority of national anthems are [[March (music)|marches]] or [[hymn]]s in style. The countries of [[Latin America]], [[Central Asia]], and [[Europe]] tend towards more ornate and [[opera]]tic pieces, while those in the [[Middle East]], [[Oceania]], [[Africa]], and the [[Caribbean]] use a more simplistic [[fanfare]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20140624-who-has-the-best-national-anthem|title=World Cup 2014: What makes a great national anthem?|last=Burton-Hill|first=Clemency|date=21 October 2014|website=BBC.com|language=en|access-date=26 March 2018}}</ref> Some [[List of sovereign states|countries]] that are devolved into multiple constituent states have their own official musical compositions for them (such as with the United Kingdom, Russian Federation, and the former Soviet Union); their constituencies' songs are sometimes referred to as national anthems even though they are not [[sovereign state]]s.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Handschrift Brussel p-37-38.jpg|thumb|Early version of the \"Wilhelmus\" as preserved in a manuscript of 1617 (Brussels, [[Royal Library of Belgium|Royal Library]], MS 15662, fol. 37v-38r)<ref>M. de Bruin, \"Het Wilhelmus tijdens de Republiek\", in: L.P. Grijp (ed.), ''Nationale hymnen. Het Wilhelmus en zijn buren. Volkskundig bulletin 24'' (1998), p. 16-42, 199\u2013200; esp. p. 28 n. 65.</ref>]]\nThe custom of an officially adopted national anthem became popular in the 19th century.\n\nThey are often patriotic songs that may have been in existence long before their designation as national anthem. The national anthem of the [[Netherlands]], \"[[Wilhelmus]]\", adopted as national anthem in 1932, originates in the 16th century: It was written between 1568 and 1572 during the [[Dutch Revolt]] and i\nhe national anthem of Spain in 1939. [[Denmark]] retains its royal anthem, ''[[Kong Christian stod ved h\u00f8jen mast]]'' (1780) alongside its national anthem (''[[Der er et yndigt land]]'', adopted 1835). In 1802, [[Gia Long]] commissioned a royal anthem in the European fashion for the [[Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty|Kingdom of Vietnam]].\n\nThe first national anthem to be officially adopted was ''[[La Marseillaise]]'', for the [[First French Republic]]. Composed in 1792, it was officially adopted by the [[French National Convention]] in 1796. It was retired in favour of ''[[Chant du d\u00e9part]]'' under the [[First French Empire]], and was re-instated in 1830, in the wake of the [[July Revolution]]. From this time, it became common for newly formed nations to define national anthems, notably as a result of the [[Latin American wars of independence]], for [[Argentina]] (1813), [[Peru]] (1821), [[Brazil]] (1831) but also [[Belgium]] (1830).\n\nAdoption of national anthems prior to the 1930s was mostly by newly formed or newly independent states, such as the [[First Portuguese Republic]] (''[[A Portuguesa]]'', 1911), the [[Kingdom of Greece]] (\"[[Hymn to Liberty]]\", 1865), the [[First Philippine Republic]] (''[[Marcha Nacional Filipina]]'', 1898), [[Lithuania]] (''[[Tauti\u0161ka giesm\u0117]]'', 1919), [[Weimar Germany]] (''[[Deutschlandlied]]'', 1922), [[Republic of Ireland]] (''[[Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann]]'', 1926) or [[Greater Lebanon]] (\"[[Lebanese National Anthem]]\", 1927).\n\nThe [[Olympic Charter]] of 1920 introduced the ritual of playing the national anthems of the gold medal winners. From this time, the playing of national anthems became increasingly popular at international sporting events, creating an incentive for such nations that did not yet have an officially defined national anthem to introduce one. <!--A [[Wales|Welsh]] patriotic song, ''[[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau]]'', in 1905 was sung in a Rugby game against [[New Zealand]] in [[Llanelli]], and came to be regarded as \"unofficial national anthem of Wales\" after this event.\n-->\n\nThe [[United States]] introduced the patriotic song ''[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]'' as national anthem in 1931. Following this, several nations moved to adopt as official national anthem patriotic songs that had already been in ''de facto'' use at official functions, such as [[Mexico]] (''[[Himno Nacional Mexicano|Mexicanos, al grito de guerra]]'', composed 1854, adopted 1943), [[Switzerland]] (\"[[Swiss Psalm]]\", composed 1841, ''de facto'' use from 1961, adopted 1981).\n\nBy the period of [[decolonisation]] in the 1960s, it had become common practice for newly independent nations to adopt an official national anthem. Some of these anthems were specifically commissioned, such as the anthem of [[Kenya]], ''[[Ee Mungu Nguvu Yetu]]'', produced by a dedicated \"Kenyan Anthem Commission\" in 1963.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://nationalanthems.me/kenya-ee-mungu-nguvu-yetu |title=Kenya |accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nA number of nations remain without official national anthem. In these cases, there are established ''de facto'' anthems played at sporting events or diplomatic receptions. These include the [[United Kingdom]] (\"[[God Save the Queen]]\"), [[Sweden]] (''[[Du gamla, Du fria]]'') and [[Norway]] (''[[Ja, vi elsker dette landet]]''). Countries that have moved to officially adopt their long-standing ''de facto'' anthems since the 1990s include: [[Luxembourg]] (''[[Ons Heemecht]]'', adopted 1993), [[South Africa]] (\"[[National anthem of South Africa]]\", adopted 1997), [[Israel]] (''[[Hatikvah]]'', composed 1888, ''de facto'' use from 1948, adopted 2004), [[Italy]] (''[[Il Canto degli Italiani]]'', adopted 2017).\n\n== Usage ==\n[[File:Atat\u00fcrk schoolroom wall.jpg|thumb|Schoolroom in [[Turkey]] with the words of the \"[[\u0130stikl\u00e2l Mar\u015f\u0131]]\"]]\nNational anthems are used in a wide array of contexts.

The \"[[Anthem of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]]\" was composed by [[Aram Khachaturian]].

The tune eventually selected was (and still is) the [[Allah Lanjutkan Usia Sultan|anthem]] of the constituent state of [[Perak]], which was in turn adopted from a popular French melody titled \"La Rosalie\" composed by the lyricist [[Pierre-Jean de B\u00e9ranger]].\n\nA few anthems have words by [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel laureates in literature]].

[[Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson]] wrote the lyrics for the Norwegian national anthem \"[[Ja, vi elsker dette landet]]\".\n\nOther countries had their anthems composed by locally important people. This is the case for [[Colombia]], whose [[National Anthem of Colombia|anthem's]] lyrics were written by former president and poet [[Rafael N\u00fa\u00f1ez (politician)|Rafael Nu\u00f1ez]], who also wrote the country's first constitution. A similar case is Liberia, the national [[All Hail, Liberia, Hail!|anthem]] of which was written by its third president, [[Daniel Bashiel Warner]].\n\n== Languages ==\nA national anthem, when it has lyrics (as is usually the case), is most often in the [[national language|national]] or most common language of the country, whether ''[[de facto]]'' or [[Official language|official]], there are notable exceptions. Most commonly, states with more than one [[national language]] may offer several versions of their anthem, for instance:\n*The \"[[Swiss Psalm]]\", the national anthem of [[Switzerland]], has different lyrics for each of the country's four [[official language]]s ([[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Romansh language|Romansh]]).\n*The national anthem of [[Canada]], \"[[O Canada]]\", has official lyrics in both English and French which are not translations of each other, and is frequently sung with a mixture of stanzas, representing the country's [[Bilingualism in Canada|bilingual nature]]. The song itself was originally written in French.\n*\"[[Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann|The Soldier's Song]]\", the national anthem of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], was originally written and adopted in English, but an [[Irish language|Irish]] translation, although never formally adopted, is nowadays almost always sung instead, even though only 10.5% of Ireland speaks Irish natively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cp10esil/p10esil/|title=Census of Population 2016 \u2013 Profile 10 Education, Skills and the Irish Language - CSO - Central Statistics Office|language=en|access-date=2018-02-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180212083359/http://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cp10esil/p10esil/|archive-date=12 February 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n*The current [[National anthem of South Africa|South African national anthem]] is unique in that five of the country's eleven official languages are used in the same anthem (the first [[stanza]] is divided between two languages, with each of the remaining three stanzas in a different language). It was created by combining two different songs together and then modifying the lyrics and adding new ones.\n*One of the two official national anthems of [[New Zealand]], \"[[God Defend New Zealand]]\", is commonly now sung with the first verse in [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] (\"Aotearoa\") and the second in [[English language|English]] (\"God Defend New Zealand\"). The tune is the same but the words are not a direct translation of each other. \n*\"[[God Bless Fiji]]\" has lyrics in English and [[Fijian language|Fijian]] which are not translations of each other. Although official, the Fijian version is rarely sung, and it is usually the English version that is performed at international sporting events.\n*Although [[Singapore]] has [[Languages of Singapore|four official languages]], with English being the current ''[[lingua franca]]'', the national anthem, \"[[Majulah Singapura]]\" is in [[Malay language|Malay]] and by law can only be sung with its original Malay lyrics, despite the fact that Malay is a minority language in Singapore. This is because Part XIII of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore declares, \u201cthe national language shall be the Malay language and shall be in the Roman script [\u2026]\u201d\n*There are several countries that do not have official lyrics to their national anthems. One of these is the \"[[Marcha Real]]\", the national anthem of [[Spain]]. Although it originally had lyrics those lyrics were discontinued after governmental changes in the early 1980s after [[Francisco Franco]]'s dictatorship ended. In 2007 a national competition to write words was held, but no lyrics were chosen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/9558331?story_id=9558331|title=Spain: Lost for words - The Economist|work=The Economist|accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref> Other national anthems with no words include \"[[Inno Nazionale della Repubblica]]\", the national anthem of [[San Marino]], that of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], that of [[Russia]] from 1990 to 2000, and that of [[Kosovo]], entitled \"[[Europe (anthem)|Europe]]\".\n*The [[National Anthem of India|national anthem]] of [[India]], \"[[Jana Gana Mana]]\", the official lyrics are in [[Bengali language|Bengali]]; they were adapted from a  poem written by [[Rabindranath Tagore]].\n*Despite the most common language in [[Wales]] being English, the Welsh National anthem \"[[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau]]\" is sung in the [[Welsh language]].\n*The national anthem of [[Finland]], \"[[Maamme]]\", was first written in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and only later translated to [[Finnish language|Finnish]].

The national anthem of the [[Netherlands]], \"[[Wilhelmus]]\", adopted as national anthem in 1932, originates in the 16th century: It was written between 1568 and 1572 during the [[Dutch Revolt]] and its current melody variant was composed shortly before 1626, and was a popular [[Orangism (Dutch Republic)|orangist]] march during the 17th century. The [[Japan]]ese national anthem, \"[[Kimigayo]]\" (adopted 1999), was composed in 1880, but its lyrics are taken from a [[Heian period|Heian period (794\u20131185)]] poem.<ref>Japan Policy Research Institute [http://www.jpri.org/publications/workingpapers/wp79.html JPRI Working Paper No. 79].</ref>\n\nIn the [[early modern period]], some [[European monarchies]] adopted [[royal anthem]]s. Some of these anthems have survived into current use. \"[[God Save the King|God Save the King/Queen]]\", first performed in 1619, remains the royal anthem of the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Commonwealth realms]]. ''[[La Marcha Real]]'', adopted as the royal anthem of the Spanish monarchy in 1770, was adopted as the national anthem of Spain in 1939. [[Denmark]] retains its royal anthem, ''[[Kong Christian stod ved h\u00f8jen mast]]'' (1780) alongside its national anthem (''[[Der er et yndigt land]]'', adopted 1835). In 1802, [[Gia Long]] commissioned a royal anthem in the European fashion for the [[Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty|Kingdom of Vietnam]].\n\nThe first national anthem to be officially adopted was ''[[La Marseillaise]]'', for the [[First French Republic]]. Composed in 1792, it was officially adopted by the [[French National Convention]] in 1796. It was retired in favour of ''[[Chant du d\u00e9part]]'' under the [[First French Empire]], and was re-instated in 1830, in the wake of the [[July Revolution]]. From this time, it became common for newly formed nations to define national anthems, notably as a result of the [[Latin American wars of independence]], for [[Argentina]] (1813), [[Peru]] (1821), [[Brazil]] (1831) but also [[Belgium]] (1830).\n\nAdoption of national anthems prior to the 1930s was mostly by newly formed or newly independent states, such as the [[First Portuguese Republic]] (''[[A Portuguesa]]'', 1911), the [[Kingdom of Greece]] (\"[[Hymn to Liberty]]\", 1865), the [[First Philippine Republic]] (''[[Marcha Nacional Filipina]]'', 1898), [[Lithuania]] (''[[Tauti\u0161ka giesm\u0117]]'', 1919), [[Weimar Germany]] (''[[Deutschlandlied]]'', 1922), [[Republic of Ireland]] (''[[Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann]]'', 1926) or [[Greater Lebanon]] (\"[[Lebanese National Anthem]]\", 1927).\n\nThe [[Olympic Charter]] of 1920 introduced the ritual of playing the national anthems of the gold medal winners. From this time, the playing of national anthems became increasingly popular at international sporting events, creating an incentive for such nations that did not yet have an officially defined national anthem to introduce one. <!--A [[Wales|Welsh]] patriotic song, ''[[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau]]'', in 1905 was sung in a Rugby game against [[New Zealand]] in [[Llanelli]], and came to be regarded as \"unofficial national anthem of Wales\" after this event.\n-->\n\nThe [[United States]] introduced the patriotic song ''[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]'' as national anthem in 1931.

A similar case is Liberia, the national [[All Hail, Liberia, Hail!|anthem]] of which was written by its third president, [[Daniel Bashiel Warner]].\n\n== Languages ==\nA national anthem, when it has lyrics (as is usually the case), is most often in the [[national language|national]] or most common language of the country, whether ''[[de facto]]'' or [[Official language|official]], there are notable exceptions. Most commonly, states with more than one [[national language]] may offer several versions of their anthem, for instance:\n*The \"[[Swiss Psalm]]\", the national anthem of [[Switzerland]], has different lyrics for each of the country's four [[official language]]s ([[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Romansh language|Romansh]]).\n*The national anthem of [[Canada]], \"[[O Canada]]\", has official lyrics in both English and French which are not translations of each other, and is frequently sung with a mixture of stanzas, representing the country's [[Bilingualism in Canada|bilingual nature]]. The song itself was originally written in French.\n*\"[[Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann|The Soldier's Song]]\", the national anthem of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], was originally written and adopted in English, but an [[Irish language|Irish]] translation, although never formally adopted, is nowadays almost always sung instead, even though only 10.5% of Ireland speaks Irish natively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cp10esil/p10esil/|title=Census of Population 2016 \u2013 Profile 10 Education, Skills and the Irish Language - CSO - Central Statistics Office|language=en|access-date=2018-02-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180212083359/http://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cp10esil/p10esil/|archive-date=12 February 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n*The current [[National anthem of South Africa|South African national anthem]] is unique in that five of the country's eleven official languages are used in the same anthem (the first [[stanza]] is divided between two languages, with each of the remaining three stanzas in a different language). It was created by combining two different songs together and then modifying the lyrics and adding new ones.\n*One of the two official national anthems of [[New Zealand]], \"[[God Defend New Zealand]]\", is commonly now sung with the first verse in [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] (\"Aotearoa\") and the second in [[English language|English]] (\"God Defend New Zealand\"). The tune is the same but the words are not a direct translation of each other. \n*\"[[God Bless Fiji]]\" has lyrics in English and [[Fijian language|Fijian]] which are not translations of each other. Although official, the Fijian version is rarely sung, and it is usually the English version that is performed at international sporting events.\n*Although [[Singapore]] has [[Languages of Singapore|four official languages]], with English being the current ''[[lingua franca]]'', the national anthem, \"[[Majulah Singapura]]\" is in [[Malay language|Malay]] and by law can only be sung with its original Malay lyrics, despite the fact that Malay is a minority language in Singapore. This is because Part XIII of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore declares, \u201cthe national language shall be the Malay language and shall be in the Roman script [\u2026]\u201d\n*There are several countries that do not have official lyrics to their national anthems. One of these is the \"[[Marcha Real]]\", the national anthem of [[Spain]]. Although it originally had lyrics those lyrics were discontinued after governmental changes in the early 1980s after [[Francisco Franco]]'s dictatorship ended. In 2007 a national competition to write words was held, but no lyrics were chosen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/9558331?story_id=9558331|title=Spain: Lost for words - The Economist|work=The Economist|accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref> Other national anthems with no words include \"[[Inno Nazionale della Repubblica]]\", the national anthem of [[San Marino]], that of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], that of [[Russia]] from 1990 to 2000, and that of [[Kosovo]], entitled \"[[Europe (anthem)|Europe]]\".\n*The [[National Anthem of India|national anthem]] of [[India]], \"[[Jana Gana Mana]]\", the official lyrics are in [[Bengali language|Bengali]]; they were adapted from a  poem written by [[Rabindranath Tagore]].\n*Despite the most common language in [[Wales]] being English, the Welsh National anthem \"[[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau]]\" is sung in the [[Welsh language]].\n*The national anthem of [[Finland]], \"[[Maamme]]\", was first written in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and only later translated to [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. It is nowadays sung in both languages as there is a [[Finland Swedish|Swedish speaking minority]] of about 6% in the country.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of national anthems]]\n* [[List of historical national anthems]]\n* [[List of anthems of non-sovereign countries, regions and territories]]\n* [[Royal anthem]]\n* [[Earth Anthem|Earth anthem]]\n* [[Honors music]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons|National anthem}}\n{{Wikiquote|National anthems}}\n{{Wikidata property|P85}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120424213330/http://www.nationalanthems.me/ NationalAnthems.me], national anthems of every country in the world (and historical national anthems) with streaming audio, lyrics, information and links\n* [http://www.lengua.com/hymnen.htm National Anthems (mp3 files)]\n* [https://www.govjobportal.net/2018/09/national-anthem-of-india-in-hindi.html National Anthems of India in Hindi]\n* [http://www.nationalanthems.info Nationalanthems.info], lyrics and history of national anthems\n* [http://www.national-symbol.com/ Recordings of countries' anthems (mp3 files)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150713134832/http://www.navyband.navy.mil/anthems.shtml Recordings of countries' anthems around the world] by the [[United States Navy Band]]\n{{Nationalanthemsoftheworld}}\n{{Nationalism}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:National Anthem}}\n[[Category:National anthems| ]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Dutch inventions]]\n", "name_user": "31.167.63.29", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(trSGH)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_anthem"}
