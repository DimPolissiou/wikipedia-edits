Its capital is [[Catbalogan City]]. It is bordered by [[Northern Samar]], [[Eastern Samar]], [[Leyte (province)|Leyte]] and the [[Leyte Gulf]], and includes several islands in the [[Samar Sea]]. Samar is connected to the [[Leyte|island of Leyte]] via the [[San Juanico Bridge]] (Marcos Bridge).\n\nIn 1768, Leyte and modern Samar was created out of the [[Samar Province (1768-1965)|historical province of Samar]].  In 1965, Northern and Eastern Samar were created.\n\nFishing and agriculture are the major economic activities in the province.<ref>http://www.samar.lgu-ph.com/econo.htm Economical Data</ref>\n\nOn 8 November 2013, the province was significantly damaged by [[Typhoon Haiyan|Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan)]], particularly the towns of [[Basey, Samar|Basey]], [[Marabut, Samar|Marabut]] and [[Santa Rita, Samar|Santa Rita]].\n\n==Etymology==\n''Samar'' is said{{by whom|date=May 2017}} to be derived from ''Samad'', the [[Visayan languages|Visayan]] word for \"wound\" or \"cut\", describing the rough physical features of the land which is rugged and deeply dissected by streams.\n\n==History==\n{{prose|date=April 2013}}\n\n* '''2 million-8,000 B.C''' \u2014 Based on geologic findings, during the ice ages or Pleistocene period (2 million years \u2013 8,000 B.C), the islands of Mindoro, Luzon, and Mindanao were connected as one big island through the islands of Samar, Leyte and Bohol.\n* '''8550 B.C.''' \u2014 Diggings in Sohoton Caves in Basey, Samar showed stone flake tools dated 8550 B.C.\n* '''1300''' \u2014 Other diggings along the Basey River revealed other stone flakes used until the 13th century.\n* '''1543''' \u2014 The explorer [[Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos]], first came to the island and named it ''Las Islas Filipinas''.\n* '''1596''' \u2014 Many names (such as ''Samal'', ''Ibabao'', ''Tandaya'') were given to Samar Island prior to the coming of the Spaniards in 1596. The name \"Samar\" was derived from the local language ''samad,'' meaning \"wound\" or \"cut\", aptly describing the rough physical features of the island, rugged and deeply dissected by streams. Recent scholars connect the name Samar to the ancient city of Samaria, the capital of the northern Kingdom of Israel. The early Datu of Samar, Iberein of Lawang Town, in the Northern part of the island may have a Samarian blood.  During the early days of Spanish occupation, Samar was under the jurisdiction of [[Cebu]].\n* '''Arrival of the First Missionaries Jesuits''' \u2014 On October 15, 1596, the first [[Jesuit]] Mission arrived in ''Tinago'' (now [[Dapdap]]) in [[Tarangnan]]. From Tinago, the missionaries Fr. [[Francisco de Otazo]], [[Bartolome Martes]], and [[Domingo Alonzo]] began teaching [[Catechism]] healing the sick and spread the [[Christianity]] faith into the interior settlements.\n* '''1649''' '''to 1650''' \u2014 On June 1, 1649, the people of [[Palapag]] led by [[Agustin Sumuroy]] revolted against the decree of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor General]] [[Diego Fajardo Chac\u00f3n|Diego Fajardo]] requiring able bodied men from the [[Visayas]] for service at the Cavite Shipyards. Like fire, the revolt quickly spread the neighboring town in the Northern and Western coast of Samar and to the nearby provinces of Bicol, [[Surigao (province)|Surigao]], [[Cebu]], [[Camiguin]] and as far as [[Zamboanga (province)|Zamboanga]]. It was suppressed in 1650 by the combined forces of the [[Spaniards]], Lutaos, and Pampangos.\n* '''1735''' \u2014 Samar and Leyte were united into one province with [[Carigara]], in Leyte, as the capital town.\n* '''1747''' \u2014 Samar and Leyte were separated for administrative effectiveness.\n* '''1762''' \u2014 Complaints from the Jesuits that the division was not working well, thus it was reunited again by the approval from the King of Spain.\n* '''1768''' \u2014 Jesuits were expelled in all Spanish dominions. The Franciscans arrived on September 25, 1768 and succeeded the administration of 14 parishes which was under by the spiritual care of the Jesuits for almost 172 years. The remaining three parishes of Guiuan, Balangiga and Basey in the south of Samar went under the administration of the Augustinians.\n* '''1777''' \u2014 The two provinces were divided for the last time, it was approved in Madrid in 1786 and had been effective in 1799.\n* '''1803''' \u2014 Guiuan, Balangiga and Basey were turned over to the Franciscans for the lack of Augustinian priests. \n* '''Royal Decree declares Samar as a Province''' \u2014 On August 11, 1841, [[Isabel II of Spain|Queen Isabella II of Spain]] signed a [[Royal Decree]] declaring Samar as a province.\n* '''1900''' \u2014 The [[Siege of Catubig|Battle of Catubig]] (April 15\u201318, 1900) occurred during the [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. On April 15, 1900, the Filipino guerrillas launched a surprise attack on a detachment of US 43rd Infantry Regiment, forcing the Americans to abandon Catubig town after the four-day siege.\n* '''1901''' \u2014 The [[Balangiga massacre]] occurred during the [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. September 28, 1901, the people of [[Balangiga, Eastern Samar|Balangiga]], [[Giporlos]], [[Lawaan]] and [[Quinapondan]] in [[Eastern Samar]] surprised and attacked the American forces station there, [[Balangiga massacre|killing 48 American soldiers]]. To avenge their defeat, American general [[Jacob H. Smith]] ordered his men to turn Samar into a \"howling wilderness\".\n* '''1910''' \u2014 On April 10, 1910, upon the papal bull of Pope Pius X separated the islands of Samar and Leyte from the Diocese of Cebu and erected the Diocese of Calbayog comprising both islands. Pablo Singzon de Anuncacion was named first Bishop and consecrated on June 12, 1910.\n* '''1941''' \u2014 The [[Philippines Campaign (1941\u201342)|invasion by the Japanese]] via fighter and bomber planes.\n* '''1941''' to '''1942''' \u2014 Filipino troops of the [[91st Division (Philippines)|91st Infantry Division]], Philippine Commonwealth Army, and [[USAFFE]] (under the Visayan-Mindanao Force) were established, but all fell to the invading Japanese forces. The general headquarters in Samar also fell to the Japanese. This resulted in the defeat of the Filipino troops of the USAFFE 91st Division.\n* '''1942''' \u2014 The occupying [[Imperial Japanese forces]] arrived in the province of Samar.\n* '''1942''' \u2013 The established of the 3rd Samar Company of the [[Philippine Constabulary]] were based at the general headquarters and camp base in [[Balangiga, Eastern Samar|Balangiga]]. \n* '''1942''' to '''1944''' \u2014 During the occupation, thousands of local Samare\u00f1os \u2014 men and women \u2014 joined guerrilla groups in the province and helped local Filipino troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army units [[Philippine resistance against Japan|fight the Japanese Imperial forces]] which led to the latter's defeat and started the pre-Allied liberation.\n** The [[4th Infantry Division (Philippines)|4th]], [[9th Infantry Division (Philippines)|9th]], 93rd, 95th and 96th Infantry Divisions of the Philippine Commonwealth Army were established from January 3, 1942 to June 30, 1946 at the military general headquarters and military camps. The military unit organizations started the anti-Japanese military operations in the province from 1942 to 1945.\n** The 96th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army was founded and established from January 3, 1942 to June 30, 1946 at the military general headquarters in the province of Samar.\n** The [[Philippine Guerrilla Forces]] or PGF were established from 1942 to 1998 as a guerrilla resistance organization with headquarters in San Andres, [[Villareal, Samar]].\n* '''September 18, 1944''' \u2014 Filipino troops of the constable 9th Samar Company of the [[Philippine Constabulary]] were ambushed at Barrio Cansumangay in [[Balangiga, Eastern Samar]] was fought against the Imperial Japanese force. The casualties almost 31 Japanese and 2 Filipinos killed in action. \n* '''1944''' \u2014 The [[Battle off Samar]] took place on October 24 as [[Vice Admiral]] [[Takeo Kurita]]'s Center Force warships clashed with several allied naval vessels in a collision course. His forces sank escort carrier {{USS|Gambier Bay|CVE-73}}, destroyers {{USS|Hoel|DD-533}} and {{USS|Johnston|DD-557}}, and escort destroyer {{USS|Samuel B. Roberts|DE-413}}, but at a cost of his cruisers [[Japanese cruiser Chikuma (1938)|''Chikuma'']], {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Chokai||2}}, and {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Suzuya|1934|2}}. Despite being a tactical victory for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], it did not alter the course of the Philippines campaign.\n* '''October 28, 1944''' \u2013 The established of the 9th Constabulary Regiment of the [[Philippine Constabulary]] were based at the general headquarters and camp base in [[Balangiga, Eastern Samar|Balangiga]] among the provincial companies in Leyte and Samar, constabulary battalions, infantry battalions and military-police battalions. Replaced by PC 9th Samar Company was fought by the Japanese. \n* '''1944''' to '''1945''' \u2014 Combined U.S. and Philippine Commonwealth military forces, including recognized guerrillas, liberated the province of Samar and defeated Imperial Japanese forces. The local Filipino soldiers under the 4th, 9th, 93rd, 95th and 96th Infantry Divisions of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 9th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary, started the battles in Samar and fought against Japanese troops.\n* '''1945''' \u2014 Filipino and Filipino-American soldiers under the [[1st Filipino Infantry Regiment (United States)|1st Filipino Infantry Regiment]] of the United States Army began the Battle of Samar and aided the local Filipino soldiers of the Philippine Commonwealth Army 4th, 9th, 93rd, 95th and 96th Infantry Divisions and the Philippine Constabulary [[9th Constabulary Regiment (Philippine Constabulary)|9th Constabulary Regiment]], the local Samare\u00f1o guerrilla resistance and the U.S. liberation forces defeated the Japanese liberating the province of Samar.\n* '''1965''' \u2014 On June 19, the [[Philippine Congress]] along with the three Samar [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Representatives]], Eladio T. Balite (1st District), Fernando R. Veloso (2nd District) and Felipe J.

The province is bordered on the north by [[Northern Samar]], east by [[Eastern Samar]], south by [[Leyte (province)|Leyte]] and the [[Leyte Gulf]], and west by the [[Samar Sea]].\n\n===Topography===\nSamar province is hilly, with mountain peaks ranging from {{Convert|200|to|800|m}} high and narrow strips of lowlands, which tend to lie in coastal peripheries or in the [[alluvial plain]]s and [[river delta|delta]]s accompanying large rivers. The largest lowlands are located along the northern coast extending up to the valleys of [[Catubig River|Catubig]] and [[Catarman River|Catarman]] rivers. Smaller lowlands in Samar are to be found in the [[Calbayog]] area and on the deltas and small valleys of Gandara and [[Ulot River|Ulot]] rivers. Slopes are generally steep and barren of trees due to [[deforestation]]. Run-off waters after heavy rains can provoke flooding in low-lying areas and the erosion of the mountains enlarges the coastal plains of the province.\n\n[[File:Ph fil samar.png|thumb]]\n\n===Climate and rainfall===\nAreas near the eastern coast of the province have no dry season (with a pronounced maximum rain period usually occurring from December to January), and are thus open to the northeast [[monsoon]]. Municipalities in the southeastern section of the province experience this type of climate.\n\nAreas located in the northwestern portion of the province have a more or less evenly distributed rainfall throughout the year.\n\n===Administrative divisions===\nThe province of Samar comprises two [[Legislative districts of Samar|congressional districts]], 24 [[municipalities of the Philippines|municipalities]] and two [[Cities of the Philippines|component cities]]. It has a total of 952 barangays.\n\n{{unbulleted list\n| {{Color box|#CCFFCC|\u2020|border=darkgray}} {{font|Provincial capital and component city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FFE6F3|\u2217|border=darkgray}} {{font|Component city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FDFDFD|border=darkgray}} {{font|Municipality|size=90%}}\n}}\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto;table-layout:fixed;text-align:right;background-color:#FDFDFD;font-size:90%;border-collapse:collapse;\"\n!

Samar is connected to the [[Leyte|island of Leyte]] via the [[San Juanico Bridge]] (Marcos Bridge).\n\nIn 1768, Leyte and modern Samar was created out of the [[Samar Province (1768-1965)|historical province of Samar]].  In 1965, Northern and Eastern Samar were created.\n\nFishing and agriculture are the major economic activities in the province.<ref>http://www.samar.lgu-ph.com/econo.htm Economical Data</ref>\n\nOn 8 November 2013, the province was significantly damaged by [[Typhoon Haiyan|Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan)]], particularly the towns of [[Basey, Samar|Basey]], [[Marabut, Samar|Marabut]] and [[Santa Rita, Samar|Santa Rita]].\n\n==Etymology==\n''Samar'' is said{{by whom|date=May 2017}} to be derived from ''Samad'', the [[Visayan languages|Visayan]] word for \"wound\" or \"cut\", describing the rough physical features of the land which is rugged and deeply dissected by streams.\n\n==History==\n{{prose|date=April 2013}}\n\n* '''2 million-8,000 B.C''' \u2014 Based on geologic findings, during the ice ages or Pleistocene period (2 million years \u2013 8,000 B.C), the islands of Mindoro, Luzon, and Mindanao were connected as one big island through the islands of Samar, Leyte and Bohol.\n* '''8550 B.C.''' \u2014 Diggings in Sohoton Caves in Basey, Samar showed stone flake tools dated 8550 B.C.\n* '''1300''' \u2014 Other diggings along the Basey River revealed other stone flakes used until the 13th century.\n* '''1543''' \u2014 The explorer [[Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos]], first came to the island and named it ''Las Islas Filipinas''.\n* '''1596''' \u2014 Many names (such as ''Samal'', ''Ibabao'', ''Tandaya'') were given to Samar Island prior to the coming of the Spaniards in 1596. The name \"Samar\" was derived from the local language ''samad,'' meaning \"wound\" or \"cut\", aptly describing the rough physical features of the island, rugged and deeply dissected by streams. Recent scholars connect the name Samar to the ancient city of Samaria, the capital of the northern Kingdom of Israel. The early Datu of Samar, Iberein of Lawang Town, in the Northern part of the island may have a Samarian blood.  During the early days of Spanish occupation, Samar was under the jurisdiction of [[Cebu]].\n* '''Arrival of the First Missionaries Jesuits''' \u2014 On October 15, 1596, the first [[Jesuit]] Mission arrived in ''Tinago'' (now [[Dapdap]]) in [[Tarangnan]]. From Tinago, the missionaries Fr. [[Francisco de Otazo]], [[Bartolome Martes]], and [[Domingo Alonzo]] began teaching [[Catechism]] healing the sick and spread the [[Christianity]] faith into the interior settlements.\n* '''1649''' '''to 1650''' \u2014 On June 1, 1649, the people of [[Palapag]] led by [[Agustin Sumuroy]] revolted against the decree of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor General]] [[Diego Fajardo Chac\u00f3n|Diego Fajardo]] requiring able bodied men from the [[Visayas]] for service at the Cavite Shipyards. Like fire, the revolt quickly spread the neighboring town in the Northern and Western coast of Samar and to the nearby provinces of Bicol, [[Surigao (province)|Surigao]], [[Cebu]], [[Camiguin]] and as far as [[Zamboanga (province)|Zamboanga]]. It was suppressed in 1650 by the combined forces of the [[Spaniards]], Lutaos, and Pampangos.\n* '''1735''' \u2014 Samar and Leyte were united into one province with [[Carigara]], in Leyte, as the capital town.\n* '''1747''' \u2014 Samar and Leyte were separated for administrative effectiveness.\n* '''1762''' \u2014 Complaints from the Jesuits that the division was not working well, thus it was reunited again by the approval from the King of Spain.\n* '''1768''' \u2014 Jesuits were expelled in all Spanish dominions. The Franciscans arrived on September 25, 1768 and succeeded the administration of 14 parishes which was under by the spiritual care of the Jesuits for almost 172 years. The remaining three parishes of Guiuan, Balangiga and Basey in the south of Samar went under the administration of the Augustinians.\n* '''1777''' \u2014 The two provinces were divided for the last time, it was approved in Madrid in 1786 and had been effective in 1799.\n* '''1803''' \u2014 Guiuan, Balangiga and Basey were turned over to the Franciscans for the lack of Augustinian priests. \n* '''Royal Decree declares Samar as a Province''' \u2014 On August 11, 1841, [[Isabel II of Spain|Queen Isabella II of Spain]] signed a [[Royal Decree]] declaring Samar as a province.\n* '''1900''' \u2014 The [[Siege of Catubig|Battle of Catubig]] (April 15\u201318, 1900) occurred during the [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. On April 15, 1900, the Filipino guerrillas launched a surprise attack on a detachment of US 43rd Infantry Regiment, forcing the Americans to abandon Catubig town after the four-day siege.\n* '''1901''' \u2014 The [[Balangiga massacre]] occurred during the [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. September 28, 1901, the people of [[Balangiga, Eastern Samar|Balangiga]], [[Giporlos]], [[Lawaan]] and [[Quinapondan]] in [[Eastern Samar]] surprised and attacked the American forces station there, [[Balangiga massacre|killing 48 American soldiers]]. To avenge their defeat, American general [[Jacob H. Smith]] ordered his men to turn Samar into a \"howling wilderness\".\n* '''1910''' \u2014 On April 10, 1910, upon the papal bull of Pope Pius X separated the islands of Samar and Leyte from the Diocese of Cebu and erected the Diocese of Calbayog comprising both islands.

The province is bordered on the north by [[Northern Samar]], east by [[Eastern Samar]], south by [[Leyte (province)|Leyte]] and the [[Leyte Gulf]], and west by the [[Samar Sea]].\n\n===Topography===\nSamar province is hilly, with mountain peaks ranging from {{Convert|200|to|800|m}} high and narrow strips of lowlands, which tend to lie in coastal peripheries or in the [[alluvial plain]]s and [[river delta|delta]]s accompanying large rivers. The largest lowlands are located along the northern coast extending up to the valleys of [[Catubig River|Catubig]] and [[Catarman River|Catarman]] rivers. Smaller lowlands in Samar are to be found in the [[Calbayog]] area and on the deltas and small valleys of Gandara and [[Ulot River|Ulot]] rivers. Slopes are generally steep and barren of trees due to [[deforestation]]. Run-off waters after heavy rains can provoke flooding in low-lying areas and the erosion of the mountains enlarges the coastal plains of the province.\n\n[[File:Ph fil samar.png|thumb]]\n\n===Climate and rainfall===\nAreas near the eastern coast of the province have no dry season (with a pronounced maximum rain period usually occurring from December to January), and are thus open to the northeast [[monsoon]]. Municipalities in the southeastern section of the province experience this type of climate.\n\nAreas located in the northwestern portion of the province have a more or less evenly distributed rainfall throughout the year.\n\n===Administrative divisions===\nThe province of Samar comprises two [[Legislative districts of Samar|congressional districts]], 24 [[municipalities of the Philippines|municipalities]] and two [[Cities of the Philippines|component cities]]. It has a total of 952 barangays.\n\n{{unbulleted list\n| {{Color box|#CCFFCC|\u2020|border=darkgray}} {{font|Provincial capital and component city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FFE6F3|\u2217|border=darkgray}} {{font|Component city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FDFDFD|border=darkgray}} {{font|Municipality|size=90%}}\n}}\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto;table-layout:fixed;text-align:right;background-color:#FDFDFD;font-size:90%;border-collapse:collapse;\"\n!

It runs on [[twisted pair]] or [[optical fiber cable]] in a [[Star topology|star wired bus topology]], similar to the IEEE standard 802.3i called [[10BASE-T]], itself an evolution of 10BASE5 (802.3) and 10BASE2 (802.3a). Fast Ethernet devices are generally backward compatible with existing 10BASE-T systems, enabling plug-and-play upgrades from 10BASE-T. Most switches and other networking devices with ports capable of Fast Ethernet can perform [[autonegotiation]], sensing a piece of 10BASE-T equipment and setting the port to 10BASE-T half duplex if the 10BASE-T equipment cannot perform auto negotiation itself. The standard specifies the use of [[CSMA/CD]] for media access control. A [[full-duplex]] mode is also specified and in practice all modern networks use [[Ethernet switch]]es and operate in full-duplex mode, even as legacy devices that use half duplex still exist.\n\nA Fast Ethernet adapter can be logically divided into a [[media access control]]ler (MAC), which deals with the higher-level issues of medium availability, and a physical layer interface ([[PHY]]). The MAC is typically linked to the PHY by a four-bit 25&nbsp;MHz synchronous parallel interface known as a [[media-independent interface]] (MII), or by a two-bit 50&nbsp;MHz variant called [[reduced media independent interface]] (RMII). In rare cases the MII may be an external connection but is usually a connection between ICs in a network adapter or even two sections within a single IC. The specs are written based on the assumption that the interface between MAC and PHY will be an MII but they do not require it. Fast Ethernet or [[Ethernet hub]]s may use the MII to connect to multiple PHYs for their different interfaces.\n\nThe MII fixes the theoretical maximum data bit rate for all versions of Fast Ethernet to 100&nbsp;Mbit/s. The [[information rate]] actually observed on real networks is less than the theoretical maximum, due to the necessary header and trailer (addressing and error-detection bits) on every [[Ethernet frame]], and the required [[interpacket gap]] between transmissions.\n\n== Copper ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0 1em 1em 0; text-align:center;\"\n|+ [[8P8C]] Wiring ([[TIA/EIA-568-B]] T568B)\n!

The segment length for a 100BASE-T cable is limited to {{convert|100|m|ft|0}} (the same limit as [[10BASE-T]] and [[gigabit Ethernet]]). All are or were standards under [[IEEE 802.3]] (approved 1995). Almost all 100BASE-T installations are 100BASE-TX.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Name\n! Standard\n! Status\n! Medium\n!

Each [[network segment]] can have a maximum cabling distance of {{convert|100|m|ft|0}}. One pair is used for each direction, providing [[full-duplex]] operation with 100&nbsp;Mbit/s of throughput in each direction.\n\nLike [[10BASE-T]], the active pairs in a standard connection are terminated on pins 1, 2, 3 and 6. Since a typical category 5 cable contains 4 pairs, it can support two 100BASE-TX links with a wiring adaptor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trinetusa.com/images/catalog/pages31-40.pdf |title=CAT5E Adapters |access-date=2012-12-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707221928/http://www.trinetusa.com/images/catalog/pages31-40.pdf |archive-date=2014-07-07 |df= }}</ref> Cabling is conventional wired to [[TIA/EIA-568-B]]'s termination standards, T568A or T568B. This places the active pairs on the orange and green pairs ([[canon (basic principle)|canon]]ical second and third pairs).\n\nThe configuration of 100BASE-TX networks is very similar to 10BASE-T. When used to build a [[local area network]], the devices on the network (computers, printers etc.) are typically connected to a [[Network hub|hub]] or [[Network switch|switch]], creating a [[star network]]. Alternatively it is possible to connect two devices directly using a [[Ethernet crossover cable|crossover cable]]. With today's equipment, crossover cables are generally not needed as most equipment support auto-negotiation along with [[auto MDI-X]] to select and match speed, duplex and pairing.\n\nWith 100BASE-TX hardware, the raw bits, presented 4 bits wide clocked at 25&nbsp;MHz at the MII, go through [[4B5B]] binary encoding to generate a series of 0 and 1 symbols clocked at a 125&nbsp;MHz [[symbol rate]]. The 4B5B encoding provides DC equalization and spectrum shaping. Just as in the 100BASE-FX case, the bits are then transferred to the physical medium attachment layer using [[NRZI]] encoding. However, 100BASE-TX introduces an additional, medium dependent sublayer, which employs [[MLT-3]] as a final encoding of the data stream before transmission, resulting in a maximum [[fundamental frequency]] of 31.25&nbsp;MHz. The procedure is borrowed from the ANSI X3.263 [[FDDI]] specifications, with minor changes.<ref name=\"mlt3\">\"The 100BASE-TX PMD (and MDI) is specified by incorporating the FDDI TP-PMD standard, ANSI X3.263: 1995 (TP-PMD), by reference, with the modifications noted below.\" (section 25.2 of IEEE802.3-2002).</ref>\n\n=== 100BASE-T1 ===\nIn '''100BASE-T1'''<ref>IEEE 802.3bw-2015 Clause 96</ref> the data is transmitted over a single copper pair, 3 bits per symbol, each transmitted as code pair using PAM3. It supports only full-duplex, transmitting in both directions simultaneously. The twisted-pair cable is required to support 66&nbsp;MHz, with a maximum length of 15&nbsp;m. No specific connector is defined. The standard is intended for automotive applications or when Fast Ethernet is to be integrated into another application.

Transmission uses 4 bits per symbol. The 4-bit symbol is expanded into two 3-bit symbols through a non-trivial scrambling procedure based on a [[linear feedback shift register]].<ref>IEEE 802.3y</ref> This is needed to flatten the bandwidth and emission spectrum of the signal, as well as to match transmission line properties. The mapping of the original bits to the symbol codes is not constant in time and has a fairly large period (appearing as a pseudo-random sequence). The final mapping from symbols to [[PAM-5]] line modulation levels obeys the table on the right. 100BASE-T2 was not widely adopted but the technology developed for it is used in 1000BASE-T.<ref name=\"TDG_ETH_2nd\" />\n\n=== 100BASE-T4 === <!-- This section is linked from [[Ethernet over twisted pair]] -->\n'''100BASE-T4''' was an early implementation of Fast Ethernet.  It requires four twisted copper pairs of [[Category 3 cable|voice grade twisted pair]], a lower performing cable compared to [[category 5 cable]] used by 100BASE-TX. Maximum distance is limited to 100 meters. One pair is reserved for transmit, one for receive, and the remaining two switch direction. The fact that 3 pairs are used to transmit in each direction makes 100BASE-T4 inherently half-duplex.\n\nA very unusual [[8B6T]] code is used to convert 8 data bits into 6 base-3 digits (the signal shaping is possible as there are nearly three times as many 6-digit base-3 numbers as there are 8-digit base-2 numbers). The two resulting 3-digit base-3 symbols are sent in parallel over 3 pairs using 3-level [[pulse-amplitude modulation]] (PAM-3).\n\n100BASE-T4 was not widely adopted but some of the technology developed for it is used in [[1000BASE-T]].<ref name=\"TDG_ETH_2nd\" />\n\n=== 100BaseVG ===\nProposed and marketed by [[Hewlett Packard]], [[100BaseVG]] was an alternative design using category 3 cabling and a token concept instead of CSMA/CD. It was slated for standardization as IEEE 802.12 but it quickly vanished when switched 100BASE-TX became popular.\n\n== Fiber optics ==\n{{Fibre legend}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Name\n!

The 100BASE-FX Physical Medium Dependent (PMD) sublayer is defined by [[FDDI]]'s PMD,<ref>IEEE 802.3 clause 26.2 ''Functional specifications''</ref> so 100BASE-FX is not compatible with [[10BASE-FL]], the 10&nbsp;Mbit/s version over optical fiber.\n\n100BASE-FX is still used for existing installation of multi-mode fiber where speed is not required, like industrial automation plants.<ref name=\"MOXA-EDS408A-datasheet\" /> It will probably be 10-20 years before 100BASE-FX is unavailable, since for many installation it is currently more expensive to replace all switches to a variant that have SFP that is used on all other 100BASE or 1000BASE fiber standards, then to just continue to replace 1:1, while products are available.\n\n===100BASE-LFX=== \n100BASE-LFX is a non-standard term to refer to Fast Ethernet transmission. It is very similar to 100BASE-FX but achieves longer distances up to 4-5&nbsp;km over a pair of multi-mode fibers due to higher quality optics than a FX, running on 1310&nbsp;nm wavelength lasers.

It is a lower cost alternative to using 100BASE-FX, because it uses short wavelength optics which are significantly less expensive than the long wavelength optics used in 100BASE-FX. 100BASE-SX uses the same wavelength as [[10BASE-FL]], the 10&nbsp;Mbit/s version over optical fiber. Unlike 100BASE-FX, this allows 100BASE-SX to be backwards-compatible with 10BASE-FL. Because of the shorter wavelength used (850&nbsp;nm) and the shorter distance it can support, 100BASE-SX uses less expensive optical components (LEDs instead of lasers) which makes it an attractive option for those upgrading from 10BASE-FL and those who do not require long distances.\n\n===100BASE-EX===\n100BASE-EX is a non-standard but industry accepted<ref name=\"FS-GLC-FE-100EX\" /> term to refer to Fast Ethernet transmission. It is very similar to 100BASE-LX10 but achieves longer distances up to 40&nbsp;km over a pair of single-mode fibers due to higher quality optics than a LX10, running on 1310&nbsp;nm wavelength lasers. It is sometimes referred to as LH (Long Haul), and is easily confused with 100BASE-LX10 or 100BASE-ZX because the use of -LX(10), -LH, -EX, and -ZX is ambiguous between vendors.\n\n===100BASE-ZX===\n100BASE-ZX is a non-standard but multi-vendor<ref name=\"FS-SFP-100ZX-55\" /> term to refer to Fast Ethernet transmission using 1,550&nbsp;nm wavelength to achieve distances of at least 70km over single-mode fiber. Some vendors specify distances up to 160km over single-mode fiber, sometimes called 100BASE-EZX. Ranges beyond 80&nbsp;km are highly dependent upon the path loss of the fiber in use, specifically the attenuation figure in dB per km, the number and quality of connectors/patch panels and splices located between transceivers.<ref>{{cite web |title=SFP15160FE0B / SFP / 100BASE-eZX |url=https://www.skylaneoptics.com/en/product/sfp15160fe0b-sfp-100base-ezx/ |website=Skylane Optics |accessdate=21 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[List of device bandwidths]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n* {{FOLDOC}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080916221133/http://www.cs.bsu.edu/homepages/peb/cs637/ethernet/100mbps.htm Common 100 Mbit/s Hardware Variations]\n* [http://www.inetdaemon.com/tutorials/networking/lan/ethernet/origins.shtml Origins and History of Ethernet]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090831104858/http://www.fols.org/fols_library/white_papers/ 100BASE-SX Fast Ethernet proposal site]\n* [http://www.fefe.de/linuxeth/ Fast Ethernet Chipsets Comparison]\n* [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/browse/standards/get-program/page/series?id=68 IEEE802.3 standards free download]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121009212203/http://www.hp.com/rnd/pdfs/100FXtechbrief.pdf ProCurve Networking 100BASE-FX Technical Brief]\n{{Ethernet}}\n\n[[Category:Ethernet]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Ethernet standards that carry traffic at the nominal rate of 100 Mbit/s}}\n[[File:Intel Pro-100 82558 PCI NIC.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Intel]] PRO/100 Fast Ethernet [[Network interface controller|NIC]], a PCI card]]\n\nIn [[computer network]]ing, '''Fast Ethernet''' [[Ethernet physical layer|physical layers]] carry traffic at the nominal rate of 100&nbsp;Mbit/s.

It runs on [[twisted pair]] or [[optical fiber cable]] in a [[Star topology|star wired bus topology]], similar to the IEEE standard 802.3i called [[10BASE-T]], itself an evolution of 10BASE5 (802.3) and 10BASE2 (802.3a). Fast Ethernet devices are generally backward compatible with existing 10BASE-T systems, enabling plug-and-play upgrades from 10BASE-T. Most switches and other networking devices with ports capable of Fast Ethernet can perform [[autonegotiation]], sensing a piece of 10BASE-T equipment and setting the port to 10BASE-T half duplex if the 10BASE-T equipment cannot perform auto negotiation itself. The standard specifies the use of [[CSMA/CD]] for media access control. A [[full-duplex]] mode is also specified and in practice all modern networks use [[Ethernet switch]]es and operate in full-duplex mode, even as legacy devices that use half duplex still exist.\n\nA Fast Ethernet adapter can be logically divided into a [[media access control]]ler (MAC), which deals with the higher-level issues of medium availability, and a physical layer interface ([[PHY]]). The MAC is typically linked to the PHY by a four-bit 25&nbsp;MHz synchronous parallel interface known as a [[media-independent interface]] (MII), or by a two-bit 50&nbsp;MHz variant called [[reduced media independent interface]] (RMII). In rare cases the MII may be an external connection but is usually a connection between ICs in a network adapter or even two sections within a single IC. The specs are written based on the assumption that the interface between MAC and PHY will be an MII but they do not require it. Fast Ethernet or [[Ethernet hub]]s may use the MII to connect to multiple PHYs for their different interfaces.\n\nThe MII fixes the theoretical maximum data bit rate for all versions of Fast Ethernet to 100&nbsp;Mbit/s. The [[information rate]] actually observed on real networks is less than the theoretical maximum, due to the necessary header and trailer (addressing and error-detection bits) on every [[Ethernet frame]], and the required [[interpacket gap]] between transmissions.\n\n== Copper ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0 1em 1em 0; text-align:center;\"\n|+ [[8P8C]] Wiring ([[TIA/EIA-568-B]] T568B)\n!

Each [[network segment]] can have a maximum cabling distance of {{convert|100|m|ft|0}}. One pair is used for each direction, providing [[full-duplex]] operation with 100&nbsp;Mbit/s of throughput in each direction.\n\nLike [[10BASE-T]], the active pairs in a standard connection are terminated on pins 1, 2, 3 and 6. Since a typical category 5 cable contains 4 pairs, it can support two 100BASE-TX links with a wiring adaptor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trinetusa.com/images/catalog/pages31-40.pdf |title=CAT5E Adapters |access-date=2012-12-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707221928/http://www.trinetusa.com/images/catalog/pages31-40.pdf |archive-date=2014-07-07 |df= }}</ref> Cabling is conventional wired to [[TIA/EIA-568-B]]'s termination standards, T568A or T568B. This places the active pairs on the orange and green pairs ([[canon (basic principle)|canon]]ical second and third pairs).\n\nThe configuration of 100BASE-TX networks is very similar to 10BASE-T. When used to build a [[local area network]], the devices on the network (computers, printers etc.) are typically connected to a [[Network hub|hub]] or [[Network switch|switch]], creating a [[star network]]. Alternatively it is possible to connect two devices directly using a [[Ethernet crossover cable|crossover cable]]. With today's equipment, crossover cables are generally not needed as most equipment support auto-negotiation along with [[auto MDI-X]] to select and match speed, duplex and pairing.\n\nWith 100BASE-TX hardware, the raw bits, presented 4 bits wide clocked at 25&nbsp;MHz at the MII, go through [[4B5B]] binary encoding to generate a series of 0 and 1 symbols clocked at a 125&nbsp;MHz [[symbol rate]]. The 4B5B encoding provides DC equalization and spectrum shaping. Just as in the 100BASE-FX case, the bits are then transferred to the physical medium attachment layer using [[NRZI]] encoding. However, 100BASE-TX introduces an additional, medium dependent sublayer, which employs [[MLT-3]] as a final encoding of the data stream before transmission, resulting in a maximum [[fundamental frequency]] of 31.25&nbsp;MHz. The procedure is borrowed from the ANSI X3.263 [[FDDI]] specifications, with minor changes.<ref name=\"mlt3\">\"The 100BASE-TX PMD (and MDI) is specified by incorporating the FDDI TP-PMD standard, ANSI X3.263: 1995 (TP-PMD), by reference, with the modifications noted below.\" (section 25.2 of IEEE802.3-2002).</ref>\n\n=== 100BASE-T1 ===\nIn '''100BASE-T1'''<ref>IEEE 802.3bw-2015 Clause 96</ref> the data is transmitted over a single copper pair, 3 bits per symbol, each transmitted as code pair using PAM3. It supports only full-duplex, transmitting in both directions simultaneously. The twisted-pair cable is required to support 66&nbsp;MHz, with a maximum length of 15&nbsp;m. No specific connector is defined. The standard is intended for automotive applications or when Fast Ethernet is to be integrated into another application. It was developed as [[BroadR-Reach]] before IEEE standardization.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1328371 |title=Driven by IEEE Standards, Ethernet Hits the Road in 2016 |publisher=EETimes |author=Junko Yoshida |date=2015-12-01 |accessdate=2016-10-06}}</ref>\n\n=== 100BASE-T2 === <!-- This section is linked from [[Ethernet over twisted pair]] -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|+ 100BASE-T2 symbols to [[Pulse-amplitude modulation|PAM-5]] line modulation level mapping\n|-\n!

Data is transmitted and received on both pairs simultaneously<ref name=\"Breyer and Riley\">{{cite book |title=Switched, Fast, and Gigabit Ethernet |author=Robert Breyer and Sean Riley |publisher=Macmillan Technical Publishing |year=1999 |page=107}}</ref> thus allowing full-duplex operation. Transmission uses 4 bits per symbol. The 4-bit symbol is expanded into two 3-bit symbols through a non-trivial scrambling procedure based on a [[linear feedback shift register]].<ref>IEEE 802.3y</ref> This is needed to flatten the bandwidth and emission spectrum of the signal, as well as to match transmission line properties. The mapping of the original bits to the symbol codes is not constant in time and has a fairly large period (appearing as a pseudo-random sequence). The final mapping from symbols to [[PAM-5]] line modulation levels obeys the table on the right. 100BASE-T2 was not widely adopted but the technology developed for it is used in 1000BASE-T.<ref name=\"TDG_ETH_2nd\" />\n\n=== 100BASE-T4 === <!-- This section is linked from [[Ethernet over twisted pair]] -->\n'''100BASE-T4''' was an early implementation of Fast Ethernet.  It requires four twisted copper pairs of [[Category 3 cable|voice grade twisted pair]], a lower performing cable compared to [[category 5 cable]] used by 100BASE-TX. Maximum distance is limited to 100 meters. One pair is reserved for transmit, one for receive, and the remaining two switch direction. The fact that 3 pairs are used to transmit in each direction makes 100BASE-T4 inherently half-duplex.\n\nA very unusual [[8B6T]] code is used to convert 8 data bits into 6 base-3 digits (the signal shaping is possible as there are nearly three times as many 6-digit base-3 numbers as there are 8-digit base-2 numbers). The two resulting 3-digit base-3 symbols are sent in parallel over 3 pairs using 3-level [[pulse-amplitude modulation]] (PAM-3).\n\n100BASE-T4 was not widely adopted but some of the technology developed for it is used in [[1000BASE-T]].<ref name=\"TDG_ETH_2nd\" />\n\n=== 100BaseVG ===\nProposed and marketed by [[Hewlett Packard]], [[100BaseVG]] was an alternative design using category 3 cabling and a token concept instead of CSMA/CD. It was slated for standardization as IEEE 802.12 but it quickly vanished when switched 100BASE-TX became popular.\n\n== Fiber optics ==\n{{Fibre legend}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Name\n!

The 100BASE-FX Physical Medium Dependent (PMD) sublayer is defined by [[FDDI]]'s PMD,<ref>IEEE 802.3 clause 26.2 ''Functional specifications''</ref> so 100BASE-FX is not compatible with [[10BASE-FL]], the 10&nbsp;Mbit/s version over optical fiber.\n\n100BASE-FX is still used for existing installation of multi-mode fiber where speed is not need, like industrial automation plants.<ref name=\"MOXA-EDS408A-datasheet\" /> It will probably be 10-20 years before 100BASE-FX is unavailable, since for many installation it is currently more expensive to replace all switches to a variant that have SFP that is used on all other 100BASE or 1000BASE fiber standards, then to just continue to replace 1:1, while products are available.\n\n===100BASE-LFX=== \n100BASE-LFX is a non-standard term to refer to Fast Ethernet transmission. It is very similar to 100BASE-FX but achieves longer distances up to 4-5&nbsp;km over a pair of multi-mode fibers due to higher quality optics than a FX, running on 1310&nbsp;nm wavelength lasers. It  is easily confused with 100BASE-LX10 or 100BASE-FX because the use of -FX, -LX and -LX10 is ambiguous between vendors. \nThe range is achieved with use of Fabry Perot laser transmitter.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fs.com/products/37324.html |title=Datasheet for SFP-100FX-31|publisher=FS.com |accessdate=2020-03-21}}</ref>\n\nWhen operating at 1300&nbsp;nm, the signal attenuation per km is about half the loss of 850nm.<ref name=\"Fluke-Fiber\">{{cite web |title= Knowledge Base Fiber |url=https://www.flukenetworks.com/knowledge-base/copper-testing/om1-om2-om3-om4-om5-and-os1-os2-fiber |website=Fluke Networks |accessdate=8 April 2020 |language=en-us |date=28 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Differences between OM1, OM2, OM3, OM4, OS1, OS2 fiber optic cable nomenclatures |url=https://www.stl.tech/connectivity-solution/optical-fibre/pdf/Differences_between_OM1__OM2__OM3__OM4_.pdf |website=stl.tech |accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref> Reach over multi-mode fiber may be extended by using 1300&nbsp;nm wavelength.\n\n===100BASE-SX===\n100BASE-SX is a version of Fast Ethernet over optical fiber standardized in TIA/EIA-785-1-2002. It is a lower cost alternative to using 100BASE-FX, because it uses short wavelength optics which are significantly less expensive than the long wavelength optics used in 100BASE-FX. 100BASE-SX uses the same wavelength as [[10BASE-FL]], the 10&nbsp;Mbit/s version over optical fiber. Unlike 100BASE-FX, this allows 100BASE-SX to be backwards-compatible with 10BASE-FL. Because of the shorter wavelength used (850&nbsp;nm) and the shorter distance it can support, 100BASE-SX uses less expensive optical components (LEDs instead of lasers) which makes it an attractive option for those upgrading from 10BASE-FL and those who do not require long distances.\n\n===100BASE-EX===\n100BASE-EX is a non-standard but industry accepted<ref name=\"FS-GLC-FE-100EX\" /> term to refer to Fast Ethernet transmission. It is very similar to 100BASE-LX10 but achieves longer distances up to 40&nbsp;km over a pair of single-mode fibers due to higher quality optics than a LX10, running on 1310&nbsp;nm wavelength lasers. It is sometimes referred to as LH (Long Haul), and is easily confused with 100BASE-LX10 or 100BASE-ZX because the use of -LX(10), -LH, -EX, and -ZX is ambiguous between vendors.\n\n===100BASE-ZX===\n100BASE-ZX is a non-standard but multi-vendor<ref name=\"FS-SFP-100ZX-55\" /> term to refer to Fast Ethernet transmission using 1,550&nbsp;nm wavelength to achieve distances of at least 70km over single-mode fiber. Some vendors specify distances up to 160km over single-mode fiber, sometimes called 100BASE-EZX. Ranges beyond 80&nbsp;km are highly dependent upon the path loss of the fiber in use, specifically the attenuation figure in dB per km, the number and quality of connectors/patch panels and splices located between transceivers.<ref>{{cite web |title=SFP15160FE0B / SFP / 100BASE-eZX |url=https://www.skylaneoptics.com/en/product/sfp15160fe0b-sfp-100base-ezx/ |website=Skylane Optics |accessdate=21 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[List of device bandwidths]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n* {{FOLDOC}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080916221133/http://www.cs.bsu.edu/homepages/peb/cs637/ethernet/100mbps.htm Common 100 Mbit/s Hardware Variations]\n* [http://www.inetdaemon.com/tutorials/networking/lan/ethernet/origins.shtml Origins and History of Ethernet]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090831104858/http://www.fols.org/fols_library/white_papers/ 100BASE-SX Fast Ethernet proposal site]\n* [http://www.fefe.de/linuxeth/ Fast Ethernet Chipsets Comparison]\n* [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/browse/standards/get-program/page/series?id=68 IEEE802.3 standards free download]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121009212203/http://www.hp.com/rnd/pdfs/100FXtechbrief.pdf ProCurve Networking 100BASE-FX Technical Brief]\n{{Ethernet}}\n\n[[Category:Ethernet]]\n", "name_user": "Samburney", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e100BASE-FX", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Ethernet"}

[[Sunlight]] provides the [[energy]] that [[green plants]] use to create [[sugars]] mostly in the form of [[starch]]es, which release energy into the living things that digest them. This process of [[photosynthesis]] provides virtually all the energy used by living things. Historically, another important source of light for humans has been [[fire]], from ancient campfires to modern [[kerosene lamp]]s. With the development of [[electric light]]s and [[history of electric power transmission|power systems]], electric lighting has effectively replaced firelight. Some species of animals generate their own light, a process called [[bioluminescence]]. For example, [[fireflies]] use light to locate mates, and [[vampire squid]]s use it to hide themselves from prey.\n\nThe primary properties of visible light are [[intensity (physics)|intensity]], propagation direction, frequency or wavelength [[spectrum]], and [[polarization (waves)|polarization]], while its [[speed of light|speed in a vacuum]], 299,792,458 meters per second, is one of the fundamental [[Mathematical constant|constants]] of nature. Visible light, as with all types of electromagnetic radiation (EMR), is experimentally found to always move at this speed in a vacuum.<ref name=\"LeClerq\">{{Cite book |last=Uzan |first=J-P |last2=Leclercq |first2=B |year=2008 |journal=The Natural Laws of the Universe: Understanding Fundamental Constants |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dSAWX8TNpScC&pg=PA43 |pages=43\u20134 |isbn=978-0-387-73454-5|bibcode=2008nlu..book.....U |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-74081-2 |title=The Natural Laws of the Universe }}</ref>\n\nIn [[physics]], the term ''light'' sometimes refers to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or not.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Camera lenses: from box camera to digital |author=Gregory Hallock Smith |publisher=SPIE Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8194-6093-6 |page=4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6mb0C0cFCEYC&pg=PA4}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Comprehensive Physics XII |author=Narinder Kumar |publisher=Laxmi Publications |year=2008 |isbn=978-81-7008-592-8 |page=1416 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=IryMtwHHngIC&pg=PA1416}}</ref> In this sense, [[gamma ray]]s, [[X-ray]]s, [[microwave]]s and [[radio wave]]s are also light. Like all types of EM radiation, visible light propagates as waves. However, the energy imparted by the waves is absorbed at single locations the way particles are absorbed. The absorbed energy of the EM waves is called a photon, and represents the [[quantum|quanta]] of light. When a wave of light is transformed and absorbed as a photon, the energy of the wave instantly collapses to a single location, and this location is where the photon \"arrives.\" This is what is called the [[wave function collapse]]. This dual wave-like and particle-like nature of light is known as the [[wave\u2013particle duality]]. The study of light, known as [[optics]], is an important research area in modern physics.\n\n==Electromagnetic spectrum and visible light==\n[[File:EM spectrum.svg|thumb|380px|The [[electromagnetic spectrum]], with the [[visible spectrum|visible portion]] highlighted]]\n{{Main|Electromagnetic spectrum}}\n\nGenerally, EM radiation (the designation \"radiation\" excludes static electric, magnetic, and [[near and far field|near fields]]), or EMR, is classified by wavelength into [[radio wave]]s, [[microwave]]s, [[infrared]], the [[visible spectrum]] that we perceive as light, [[ultraviolet]], [[X-ray]]s, and [[gamma ray]]s.\n\nThe behavior of EMR depends on its wavelength. Higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths, and lower frequencies have longer wavelengths.  When EMR interacts with single atoms and molecules, its behavior depends on the amount of energy per quantum it carries.\n\nEMR in the visible light region consists of [[quantum|quanta]] (called [[photon]]s) that are at the lower end of the energies that are capable of causing electronic excitation within molecules, which leads to changes in the bonding or chemistry of the molecule. At the lower end of the visible light spectrum, EMR becomes invisible to humans (infrared) because its photons no longer have enough individual energy to cause a lasting molecular change (a change in conformation) in the visual molecule [[retinal]] in the human retina, which change triggers the sensation of vision.\n\nThere exist animals that are sensitive to various types of infrared, but not by means of quantum-absorption. [[Infrared sensing in snakes]] depends on a kind of natural [[thermal imaging]], in which tiny packets of cellular water are raised in temperature by the infrared radiation. EMR in this range causes molecular vibration and heating effects, which is how these animals detect it.\n\nAbove the range of visible light, ultraviolet light becomes invisible to humans, mostly because it is absorbed by the cornea below 360 [[nanometer|nm]] and the internal lens below 400&nbsp;nm. Furthermore, the [[rod cell|rods]] and [[cone cell|cones]] located in the [[retina]] of the human eye cannot detect the very short (below 360&nbsp;nm) ultraviolet wavelengths and are in fact damaged by ultraviolet. Many animals with eyes that do not require lenses (such as insects and shrimp) are able to detect ultraviolet, by quantum photon-absorption mechanisms, in much the same chemical way that humans detect visible light.\n\nVarious sources define visible light as narrowly as 420\u2013680&nbsp;nm<ref>{{cite book |last=Laufer |first=Gabriel |title=Introduction to Optics and Lasers in Engineering |journal=Introduction to Optics and Lasers in Engineering |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4MxLPYMS5TUC&pg=PA11 |accessdate=20 October 2013 |date=13 July 1996 |isbn=978-0-521-45233-5 |page=11|bibcode=1996iole.book.....L }}</ref><ref name=\"Bradt2004\">{{cite book |last=Bradt |first=Hale |title=Astronomy Methods: A Physical Approach to Astronomical Observations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hp7vyaGvhLMC&pg=PA26 |accessdate=20 October 2013 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-53551-9 |page=26}}</ref> to as broadly as 380\u2013800&nbsp;nm.<ref name=\"OhannesianStreeter2001\">{{cite book |last1=Ohannesian |first1=Lena |last2=Streeter |first2=Anthony |title=Handbook of Pharmaceutical Analysis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwPb4wgqseYC&pg=PA187 |accessdate=20 October 2013 |date=9 November 2001 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8247-4194-5 |page=187}}</ref><ref name=\"AhluwaliaGoyal2000\">{{cite book |last1=Ahluwalia |first1=V.K. |last2=Goyal |first2=Madhuri |title=A Textbook of Organic Chemistry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tJNJnn0M75MC&pg=PA110 |accessdate=20 October 2013 |date=1 January 2000 |publisher=Narosa |isbn=978-81-7319-159-6 |page=110}}</ref> Under ideal laboratory conditions, people can see infrared up to at least 1050&nbsp;nm;<ref name=\"Sliney1976\">{{cite journal |last1=Sliney |first1=David H. |last2=Wangemann |first2=Robert T. |last3=Franks |first3=James K. |last4=Wolbarsht |first4=Myron L. |year=1976 |title=Visual sensitivity of the eye to infrared laser radiation |journal=[[Journal of the Optical Society of America]] |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=339\u2013341 |doi=10.1364/JOSA.66.000339 |pmid=1262982 |quote=The foveal sensitivity to several near-infrared laser wavelengths was measured.

The fixed value of the speed of light in SI units results from the fact that the meter is now defined in terms of the speed of light. All forms of electromagnetic radiation move at exactly this same speed in vacuum.\n\nDifferent [[physicist]]s have attempted to measure the speed of light throughout history. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] attempted to measure the speed of light in the seventeenth century. An early experiment to measure the speed of light was conducted by [[Ole R\u00f8mer]], a Danish physicist, in 1676. Using a [[telescope]], R\u00f8mer observed the motions of [[Jupiter]] and one of its [[natural satellite|moons]], [[Io (moon)|Io]]. Noting discrepancies in the apparent period of Io's orbit, he calculated that light takes about 22 minutes to traverse the diameter of Earth's orbit.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?view=body&id=pdf_1&handle=euclid.ss/1009212817 |title=Scientific Method, Statistical Method and the Speed of Light |journal=Statistical Science |year=2000 |volume=15 |pages=254\u2013278 |issue=3 |doi=10.1214/ss/1009212817 |mr=1847825|last1=Oldford |first1=R. W |last2=MacKay |first2=R. J |doi-access=free }}</ref> However, its size was not known at that time. If R\u00f8mer had known the diameter of the Earth's orbit, he would have calculated a speed of 227,000,000&nbsp;m/s.\n\nAnother more accurate measurement of the speed of light was performed in Europe by [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] in 1849. Fizeau directed a beam of light at a mirror several kilometers away. A rotating [[cog wheel]] was placed in the path of the light beam as it traveled from the source, to the mirror and then returned to its origin.  Fizeau found that at a certain rate of rotation, the beam would pass through one gap in the wheel on the way out and the next gap on the way back. Knowing the distance to the mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel, and the rate of rotation, Fizeau was able to calculate the speed of light as 313,000,000&nbsp;m/s.\n\n[[L\u00e9on Foucault]] carried out an experiment which used rotating mirrors to obtain a value of 298,000,000&nbsp;m/s in 1862. [[Albert A. Michelson]] conducted experiments on the speed of light from 1877 until his death in 1931. He refined Foucault's methods in 1926 using improved rotating mirrors to measure the time it took light to make a round trip from [[Mount Wilson (California)|Mount Wilson]] to [[Mount San Antonio]] in California. The precise measurements yielded a speed of 299,796,000&nbsp;m/s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Michelson |first=A.A. |title=Measurements of the velocity of light between Mount Wilson and Mount San Antonio |journal=Astrophysical Journal |date=January 1927 |volume=65 |pages=1 |doi=10.1086/143021 |bibcode=1927ApJ....65....1M}}</ref>\n\nThe effective velocity of light in various transparent substances containing ordinary [[matter]], is less than in vacuum. For example, the speed of light in water is about 3/4 of that in vacuum.\n\nTwo independent teams of physicists were said to bring light to a \"complete standstill\" by passing it through a [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]] of the element [[rubidium]], one team at [[Harvard University]] and the [[Rowland Institute for Science]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the other at the [[Harvard\u2013Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]], also in Cambridge.<ref>{{cite web |author=Harvard News Office |url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2001/01.24/01-stoplight.html |title=Harvard Gazette: Researchers now able to stop, restart light |publisher=News.harvard.edu |date=24 January 2001 |accessdate=8 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028041346/http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2001/01.24/01-stoplight.html |archivedate=28 October 2011 }}</ref> However, the popular description of light being \"stopped\" in these experiments refers only to light being stored in the excited states of atoms, then re-emitted at an arbitrary later time, as stimulated by a second laser pulse. During the time it had \"stopped\" it had ceased to be light.\n\n==Optics==\n{{Main|Optics}}\n\nThe study of light and the interaction of light and [[matter]] is termed [[optics]]. The observation and study of [[optical phenomena]] such as [[rainbow]]s and the [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora borealis]] offer many clues as to the nature of light.\n\n===Refraction===\n{{Main|Refraction}}\n[[File:Refraction-with-soda-straw.jpg|thumb|250 px|An example of refraction of light. The straw appears bent, because of refraction of light as it enters liquid (the water, in this case) from air.]]\n[[File:Cloud in the sunlight.jpg|thumb|250px|A cloud illuminated by sunlight]]\n\nRefraction is the bending of light rays when passing through a surface between one transparent material and another. It is described by [[Snell's Law]]:\n\n:<math>n_1\\sin\\theta_1 = n_2\\sin\\theta_2\\ .</math>\n\nwhere \u03b8<sub>1</sub> is the angle between the ray and the surface [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] in the first medium, \u03b8<sub>2</sub> is the angle between the ray and the surface normal in the second medium, and n<sub>1</sub> and n<sub>2</sub> are the [[Index of refraction|indices of refraction]], ''n'' = 1 in a [[vacuum]] and ''n'' > 1 in a [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]] [[Chemical substance|substance]].\n\nWhen a beam of light crosses the boundary between a vacuum and another medium, or between two different media, the wavelength of the light changes, but the frequency remains constant. If the beam of light is not [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] (or rather normal) to the boundary, the change in wavelength results in a change in the direction of the beam. This change of direction is known as [[refraction]].\n\nThe refractive quality of [[lens (optics)|lenses]] is frequently used to manipulate light in order to change the apparent size of images. [[Magnifying glass]]es, [[Glasses|spectacles]], [[contact lens]]es, [[microscope]]s and [[refracting telescope]]s are all examples of this manipulation.\n\n==Light sources== <!-- This section is linked from [[Source]] -->\n{{Redirect|Lightsource|the solar energy developer named Lightsource|Lightsource Renewable Energy}}\n{{Further|List of light sources}}\nThere are many sources of light. A body at a given temperature emits a characteristic spectrum of [[black-body]] radiation. A simple thermal source is sunlight, the radiation emitted by the [[chromosphere]] of the [[Sun]] at around  {{convert|6000|K|C F|abbr=off}} peaks in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum when plotted in wavelength units<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thulescientific.com/LYNCH%20&%20Soffer%20OPN%201999.pdf |title=Spectrum and the Color Sensitivity of the Eye |website=Thulescientific.com |accessdate=29 August 2017}}</ref> and roughly 44% of sunlight energy that reaches the ground is visible.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/spectra/am1.5/ |title=Reference Solar Spectral Irradiance: Air Mass 1.5 |accessdate=12 November 2009}}</ref> Another example is [[incandescent light bulb]]s, which emit only around 10% of their energy as visible light and the remainder as infrared. A common thermal light source in history is the glowing solid particles in [[fire|flames]], but these also emit most of their radiation in the infrared, and only a fraction in the visible spectrum.\n\nThe peak of the black-body spectrum is in the deep infrared, at about 10 [[micrometre|micrometer]] wavelength, for relatively cool objects like human beings. As the temperature increases, the peak shifts to shorter wavelengths, producing first a red glow, then a white one, and finally a blue-white color as the peak moves out of the visible part of the spectrum and into the ultraviolet. These colors can be seen when metal is heated to \"red hot\" or \"white hot\". Blue-white [[thermal emission]] is not often seen, except in stars (the commonly seen pure-blue color in a [[natural gas|gas]] flame or a [[Welding|welder's]] torch is in fact due to molecular emission, notably by CH radicals (emitting a wavelength band around 425&nbsp;nm, and is not seen in stars or pure thermal radiation).\n\nAtoms emit and absorb light at characteristic energies. This produces \"[[emission line]]s\" in the spectrum of each atom. [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|Emission]] can be [[spontaneous emission|spontaneous]], as in [[light-emitting diode]]s, [[gas discharge]] lamps (such as [[neon lamp]]s and [[neon sign]]s, [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s, etc.), and flames (light from the hot gas itself\u2014so, for example, [[sodium]] in a gas flame emits characteristic yellow light). Emission can also be [[stimulated emission|stimulated]], as in a [[laser]] or a microwave [[maser]].\n\nDeceleration of a free charged particle, such as an [[electron]], can produce visible radiation: [[cyclotron radiation]], [[synchrotron radiation]], and [[bremsstrahlung]] radiation are all examples of this. Particles moving through a medium faster than the speed of light in that medium can produce visible [[Cherenkov radiation]]. Certain chemicals produce visible radiation by [[chemoluminescence]]. In living things, this process is called [[bioluminescence]]. For example, [[firefly|fireflies]] produce light by this means, and boats moving through water can disturb plankton which produce a glowing wake.\n\nCertain substances produce light when they are illuminated by more energetic radiation, a process known as [[fluorescence]]. Some substances emit light slowly after excitation by more energetic radiation. This is known as [[phosphorescence]]. Phosphorescent materials can also be excited by bombarding them with subatomic particles. [[Cathodoluminescence]] is one example. This mechanism is used in [[cathode ray tube]] [[television set]]s and [[computer monitor]]s.\n\n[[File:Colorful artificial lighting at night.jpg|thumb|250px|Hong Kong illuminated by colorful [[lighting|artificial lighting.]]]]\n\nCertain other mechanisms can produce light:\n* [[Bioluminescence]]\n* [[Cherenkov radiation]]\n* [[Electroluminescence]]\n* [[Scintillation (physics)|Scintillation]]\n* [[Sonoluminescence]]\n* [[Triboluminescence]]\n\nWhen the concept of light is intended to include very-high-energy photons (gamma rays), additional generation mechanisms include:\n* Particle\u2013[[antiparticle]] annihilation\n* [[Radioactive decay]]\n\n==Units and measures==\n{{Main|Photometry (optics)|Radiometry}}\n\nLight is measured with two main alternative sets of units: [[radiometry]] consists of measurements of light power at all wavelengths, while [[photometry (optics)|photometry]] measures light with wavelength weighted with respect to a standardized model of human brightness perception.  Photometry is useful, for example, to quantify [[Illumination (lighting)]] intended for human use.  The SI units for both systems are summarized in the following tables.\n\n{{SI radiometry units|1|self|nb}}<!-- parameter 1 for table number, parameter 2 for compare destination page, parameter 3 for reference group -->\n{{SI light units|2|self|nb}}<!-- parameter 1 for table number, parameter 2 for compare destination page, parameter 3 for reference group -->\n\nThe photometry units are different from most systems of physical units in that they take into account how the human eye responds to light. The [[cone cell]]s in the human eye are of three types which respond differently across the visible spectrum, and the cumulative response peaks at a wavelength of around 555&nbsp;nm. Therefore, two sources of light which produce the same intensity (W/m<sup>2</sup>) of visible light do not necessarily appear equally bright. The photometry units are designed to take this into account, and therefore are a better representation of how \"bright\" a light appears to be than raw intensity. They relate to raw [[power (physics)|power]] by a quantity called [[luminous efficacy]], and are used for purposes like determining how to best achieve sufficient illumination for various tasks in indoor and outdoor settings. The illumination measured by a [[photocell]] sensor does not necessarily correspond to what is perceived by the human eye, and without filters which may be costly, photocells and [[charge-coupled device]]s (CCD) tend to respond to some [[infrared]], [[ultraviolet]] or both.\n\n==Light pressure==\n{{Main|Radiation pressure}}\nLight exerts physical pressure on objects in its path, a phenomenon which can be deduced by Maxwell's equations, but can be more easily explained by the particle nature of light: photons strike and transfer their momentum. Light pressure is equal to the power of the light beam divided by ''[[speed of light|c]]'', the speed of light.{{Spaces}} Due to the magnitude of ''c'', the effect of light pressure is negligible for everyday objects.{{Spaces}} For example, a one-milliwatt [[laser pointer]] exerts a force of about 3.3 [[newton (unit)|piconewtons]] on the object being illuminated; thus, one could lift a [[penny (United States coin)|U.S. penny]] with laser pointers, but doing so would require about 30 billion 1-mW laser pointers.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tang |first=Hong |title=May The Force of Light Be With You |journal=IEEE Spectrum |date=1 October 2009 |volume=46 |issue=10 |pages=46\u201351 |doi=10.1109/MSPEC.2009.5268000}}</ref>{{Spaces}} However, in [[nanometre]]-scale applications such as [[nanoelectromechanical systems]] (|NEMS), the effect of light pressure is more significant, and exploiting light pressure to drive NEMS mechanisms and to flip nanometre-scale physical switches in integrated circuits is an active area of research.<ref>See, for example, [http://www.eng.yale.edu/tanglab/research.htm nano-opto-mechanical systems research at Yale University].</ref> At larger scales, light pressure can cause [[asteroid]]s to spin faster,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2004/feb/asteroids-get-spun-by-the-sun/ |title=Asteroids Get Spun By the Sun |author=Kathy A. |website=Discover Magazine |date=5 February 2004}}</ref> acting on their irregular shapes as on the vanes of a [[windmill]].{{Spaces}} The possibility of making [[solar sail]]s that would accelerate spaceships in space is also under investigation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/roboticexplorers/solar_sails.html |title=Solar Sails Could Send Spacecraft 'Sailing' Through Space |website=NASA |date=31 August 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/news/releases/2004/04-208.html |title=NASA team successfully deploys two solar sail systems |website=NASA |date=9 August 2004}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the motion of the [[Crookes radiometer]] was originally attributed to light pressure, this interpretation is incorrect; the characteristic Crookes rotation is the result of a partial vacuum.<ref>P.

He wrote, \"radiation will exert pressure on both sides of the plate. The forces of pressure exerted on the two sides are equal if the plate is at rest. However, if it is in motion, more radiation will be reflected on the surface that is ahead during the motion (front surface) than on the back surface. The backwardacting force of pressure exerted on the front surface is thus larger than the force of pressure acting on the back. Hence, as the resultant of the two forces, there remains a force that counteracts the motion of the plate and that increases with the velocity of the plate. We will call this resultant 'radiation friction' in brief.\"\n\nUsually light momentum is aligned with its direction of motion.

The basic atoms are those of earth (''prthivi''), water (''pani''), fire (''agni''), and air (''vayu'') Light rays are taken to be a stream of high velocity of ''tejas'' (fire) atoms. The particles of light can exhibit different characteristics depending on the speed and the arrangements of the ''tejas'' atoms.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\nThe ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'' refers to sunlight as \"the seven rays of the sun\".<ref name=\"sifuae.com\"/>\n\nThe Indian [[Buddhist]]s, such as [[Dign\u0101ga]] in the 5th century and [[Dharmakirti]] in the 7th century, developed a type of atomism that is a philosophy about reality being composed of atomic entities that are momentary flashes of light or energy.

[[Isaac Newton]] studied Gassendi's work at an early age, and preferred his view to Descartes' theory of the ''plenum''. He stated in his ''Hypothesis of Light'' of 1675 that light was composed of [[Corpuscularianism|corpuscles]] (particles of matter) which were emitted in all directions from a source. One of Newton's arguments against the wave nature of light was that waves were known to bend around obstacles, while light travelled only in straight lines. He did, however, explain the phenomenon of the [[diffraction]] of light (which had been observed by [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi|Francesco Grimaldi]]) by allowing that a light particle could create a localised wave in the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]].\n\nNewton's theory could be used to predict the [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] of light, but could only explain [[refraction]] by incorrectly assuming that light accelerated upon entering a denser [[Medium (optics)|medium]] because the [[gravity|gravitational]] pull was greater. Newton published the final version of his theory in his ''[[Opticks]]'' of 1704. His reputation helped the [[particle theory of light]] to hold sway during the 18th century. The particle theory of light led [[Laplace]] to argue that a body could be so massive that light could not escape from it. In other words, it would become what is now called a [[black hole]]. Laplace withdrew his suggestion later, after a wave theory of light became firmly established as the model for light (as has been explained, neither a particle or wave theory is fully correct). A translation of Newton's essay on light appears in ''The large scale structure of space-time'', by [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[George F. R. Ellis]].\n\nThe fact that light could be [[polarized light|polarized]] was for the first time qualitatively explained by Newton using the particle theory. [[\u00c9tienne-Louis Malus]] in 1810 created a mathematical particle theory of polarization. [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] in 1812 showed that this theory explained all known phenomena of light polarization. At that time the polarization was considered as the proof of the particle theory.\n\n=== Wave theory ===\nTo explain the origin of [[color]]s, [[Robert Hooke]] (1635\u20131703) developed a \"pulse theory\" and compared the spreading of light to that of waves in water in his 1665 work ''[[Micrographia]]'' (\"Observation IX\"). In 1672 Hooke suggested that light's vibrations could be [[perpendicular]] to the direction of propagation. [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629\u20131695) worked out a mathematical wave theory of light in 1678, and published it in his ''[[Treatise on light]]'' in 1690. He proposed that light was emitted in all directions as a series of waves in a medium called the ''[[Luminiferous ether]]''.  As waves are not affected by gravity, it was assumed that they slowed down upon entering a denser medium.<ref>Fokko Jan Dijksterhuis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cPFevyomPUIC Lenses and Waves: Christiaan Huygens and the Mathematical Science of Optics in the 17th Century], Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2004, {{ISBN|1-4020-2697-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Christiaan Huygens-painting.jpeg|thumb|200 px|[[Christiaan Huygens]].]]\n\n[[File:Young Diffraction.png|right|thumb|200px|[[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]]'s sketch of a [[double-slit experiment]] showing [[diffraction]]. Young's experiments supported the theory that light consists of waves.]]\n\nThe wave theory predicted that light waves could interfere with each other like sound waves (as noted around 1800 by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]]). Young showed by means of a [[double-slit experiment|diffraction experiment]] that light behaved as waves. He also proposed that different [[color]]s were caused by different [[wavelength]]s of light, and explained color vision in terms of three-colored receptors in the eye. Another supporter of the wave theory was [[Leonhard Euler]]. He argued in ''Nova theoria lucis et colorum'' (1746) that [[diffraction]] could more easily be explained by a wave theory. In 1816 [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]] gave [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] an idea that the polarization of light can be explained by the wave theory if light were a [[transverse wave]].<ref>James R. Hofmann, ''Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re: Enlightenment and Electrodynamics'', Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 222.</ref>\n\nLater, Fresnel independently worked out his own wave theory of light, and presented it to the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences]] in 1817. [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson]] added to Fresnel's mathematical work to produce a convincing argument in favor of the wave theory, helping to overturn Newton's corpuscular theory.{{dubious|date=June 2018}}<!-- [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson]] says he was an opponent of the theory --> By the year 1821, Fresnel was able to show via mathematical methods that polarization could be explained by the wave theory of light if and only if light was entirely transverse, with no longitudinal vibration whatsoever.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe weakness of the wave theory was that light waves, like sound waves, would need a medium for transmission. The existence of the hypothetical substance ''luminiferous aether'' proposed by Huygens in 1678 was cast into strong doubt in the late nineteenth century by the [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]].\n\nNewton's corpuscular theory implied that light would travel faster in a denser medium, while the wave theory of Huygens and others implied the opposite. At that time, the [[speed of light]] could not be measured accurately enough to decide which theory was correct. The first to make a sufficiently accurate measurement was [[L\u00e9on Foucault]], in 1850.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Understanding Physics |author1=David Cassidy |author2=Gerald Holton |author3=James Rutherford |publisher=Birkh\u00e4user |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-387-98756-9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=rpQo7f9F1xUC&pg=PA382}}</ref> His result supported the wave theory, and the classical particle theory was finally abandoned, only to partly re-emerge in the 20th century.\n\n===Electromagnetic theory===\n{{Main|Electromagnetic radiation}}\n[[File:light-wave.svg|360px|thumb|A 3\u2013dimensional rendering of [[Polarization (waves)|linearly polarized]] light wave frozen in time and showing the two oscillating components of light; an [[electric field]] and a [[magnetic field]] perpendicular to each other and to the direction of motion (a [[transverse wave]]).]]\n\nIn 1845, [[Michael Faraday]] discovered that the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light is rotated when the light rays travel along the [[magnetic field]] direction in the presence of a transparent [[dielectric]], an effect now known as [[Faraday rotation]].<ref name=\"LongairMalcolm\">{{cite book |last=Longair |first=Malcolm |title=Theoretical Concepts in Physics |year=2003 |page=87}}</ref> This was the first evidence that light was related to [[electromagnetism]].

Maxwell discovered that self-propagating electromagnetic waves would travel through space at a constant speed, which happened to be equal to the previously measured speed of light. From this, Maxwell concluded that light was a form of electromagnetic radiation: he first stated this result in 1862 in ''On Physical Lines of Force''. In 1873, he published ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'', which contained a full mathematical description of the behavior of electric and magnetic fields, still known as [[Maxwell's equations]]. Soon after, [[Heinrich Hertz]] confirmed Maxwell's theory experimentally by generating and detecting radio waves in the laboratory, and demonstrating that these waves behaved exactly like visible light, exhibiting properties such as reflection, refraction, diffraction, and interference. Maxwell's theory and Hertz's experiments led directly to the development of modern radio, radar, television, electromagnetic imaging, and wireless communications.\n\nIn the quantum theory, photons are seen as [[wave packet]]s of the waves described in the classical theory of Maxwell. The quantum theory was needed to explain effects even with visual light that Maxwell's classical theory could not (such as [[spectral line]]s).\n\n===Quantum theory===\nIn 1900 [[Max Planck]], attempting to explain [[black-body radiation]] suggested that although light was a wave, these waves could gain or lose energy only in finite amounts related to their frequency. Planck called these \"lumps\" of light energy \"[[quantum|quanta]]\" (from a Latin word for \"how much\"). In 1905, Albert Einstein used the idea of light quanta to explain the [[photoelectric effect]], and suggested that these light quanta had a \"real\" existence. In 1923 [[Arthur Holly Compton]] showed that the wavelength shift seen when low intensity X-rays scattered from electrons (so called [[Compton scattering]]) could be explained by a particle-theory of X-rays, but not a wave theory. In 1926 [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] named these light quanta particles [[photon]]s.<ref>{{Open access}} {{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/IntroductionToMolecularSpectroscopy |title=Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy |last=Barrow |first=Gordon M. |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1962 |format=Scanned PDF |lccn=62-12478}}</ref>\n\nEventually the modern theory of [[quantum mechanics]] came to picture light as (in some sense) ''both'' a particle and a wave, and (in another sense), as a phenomenon which is ''neither'' a particle nor a wave (which actually are macroscopic phenomena, such as baseballs or ocean waves). Instead, modern physics sees light as something that can be described sometimes with mathematics appropriate to one type of macroscopic metaphor (particles), and sometimes another macroscopic metaphor (water waves), but is actually something that cannot be fully imagined. As in the case for radio waves and the X-rays involved in Compton scattering, physicists have noted that electromagnetic radiation tends to behave more like a classical wave at lower frequencies, but more like a classical particle at higher frequencies, but never completely loses all qualities of one or the other. Visible light, which occupies a middle ground in frequency, can easily be shown in experiments to be describable using either a wave or particle model, or sometimes both.\n\nIn February 2018, scientists reported, for the first time, the discovery of a new form of light, which may involve [[polariton]]s, that could be useful in the development of [[quantum computer]]s.<ref name=\"NW-20180216\">{{cite web |last=Hignett |first=Katherine |title=Physics Creates New Form of Light That Could Drive The Quantum Computing Revolution |url=http://www.newsweek.com/photons-light-physics-808862 |date=16 February 2018 |website=Newsweek |accessdate=17 February 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"SCI-20180216\">{{cite journal |author=Liang, Qi-Yu|display-authors=etal|title=Observation of three-photon bound states in a quantum nonlinear medium |date=16 February 2018 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=359 |issue=6377 |pages=783\u2013786 |doi=10.1126/science.aao7293 |pmid=29449489 |pmc=6467536|arxiv=1709.01478 |bibcode=2018Sci...359..783L }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Physics|Science}}\n{{div col|colwidth=13em}}\n* [[Automotive lighting]]\n* [[Ballistic photon]]\n* [[Black-body radiation]]\n* [[Color temperature]]\n* [[Fermat's principle]]\n* [[Huygens' principle]]\n* [[Incandescent light bulb]]\n* [[International Commission on Illumination]]\n* ''[[Journal of Luminescence]]''\n* [[Light art]]\n* [[Light beam]] \u2013 in particular about light beams visible from the side\n* [[Light Fantastic (TV series)]]\n* [[Light mill]]\n* [[Light painting]]\n* [[Light pollution]]\n* [[Light therapy]]\n* [[Lighting]]\n* [[List of light sources]]\n* ''[[Luminescence: The Journal of Biological and Chemical Luminescence]]''\n* [[Photic sneeze reflex]]\n* [[Photometry (optics)|Photometry]]\n* [[Photon]]\n* [[Right to light]]\n* [[Risks and benefits of sun exposure]]\n* [[Spectroscopy]]\n* [[Visible spectrum]]\n* [[Wave\u2013particle duality]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons-inline|Light}}\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n* {{Wikiquote-inline}}\n* {{Britannica|340440|Light (physics)}}\n* {{LEDV|27859}}\n{{Radiation}}\n{{Color topics}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Light| ]]\n[[Category:Radiation]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Electromagnetic radiation in or near visible spectrum}}\n{{Redirect|Visible light|light that cannot be seen with human eye|Electromagnetic radiation|other uses|Light (disambiguation)|and|Visible light (disambiguation)}}\n{{Pp|small=yes}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n[[File:Light dispersion conceptual waves.gif|thumb|upright=1.2|A triangular [[dispersive prism|prism]] [[dispersion (optics)|dispersing]] a beam of white light.

[[Sunlight]] provides the [[energy]] that [[green plants]] use to create [[sugars]] mostly in the form of [[starch]]es, which release energy into the living things that digest them. This process of [[photosynthesis]] provides virtually all the energy used by living things. Historically, another important source of light for humans has been [[fire]], from ancient campfires to modern [[kerosene lamp]]s. With the development of [[electric light]]s and [[history of electric power transmission|power systems]], electric lighting has effectively replaced firelight. Some species of animals generate their own light, a process called [[bioluminescence]]. For example, [[fireflies]] use light to locate mates, and [[vampire squid]]s use it to hide themselves from prey.\n\nThe primary properties of visible light are [[intensity (physics)|intensity]], propagation direction, frequency or wavelength [[spectrum]], and [[polarization (waves)|polarization]], while its [[speed of light|speed in a vacuum]], 299,792,458 meters per second, is one of the fundamental [[Mathematical constant|constants]] of nature.

Like all types of EM radiation, visible light propagates as waves. However, the energy imparted by the waves is absorbed at single locations the way particles are absorbed. The absorbed energy of the EM waves is called a photon, and represents the [[quantum|quanta]] of light. When a wave of light is transformed and absorbed as a photon, the energy of the wave instantly collapses to a single location, and this location is where the photon \"arrives.\" This is what is called the [[wave function collapse]]. This dual wave-like and particle-like nature of light is known as the [[wave\u2013particle duality]]. The study of light, known as [[optics]], is an important research area in modern physics.\n\n==Electromagnetic spectrum and visible light==\n[[File:EM spectrum.svg|thumb|380px|The [[electromagnetic spectrum]], with the [[visible spectrum|visible portion]] highlighted]]\n{{Main|Electromagnetic spectrum}}\n\nGenerally, EM radiation (the designation \"radiation\" excludes static electric, magnetic, and [[near and far field|near fields]]), or EMR, is classified by wavelength into [[radio wave]]s, [[microwave]]s, [[infrared]], the [[visible spectrum]] that we perceive as light, [[ultraviolet]], [[X-ray]]s, and [[gamma ray]]s.\n\nThe behavior of EMR depends on its wavelength. Higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths, and lower frequencies have longer wavelengths.  When EMR interacts with single atoms and molecules, its behavior depends on the amount of energy per quantum it carries.\n\nEMR in the visible light region consists of [[quantum|quanta]] (called [[photon]]s) that are at the lower end of the energies that are capable of causing electronic excitation within molecules, which leads to changes in the bonding or chemistry of the molecule. At the lower end of the visible light spectrum, EMR becomes invisible to humans (infrared) because its photons no longer have enough individual energy to cause a lasting molecular change (a change in conformation) in the visual molecule [[retinal]] in the human retina, which change triggers the sensation of vision.\n\nThere exist animals that are sensitive to various types of infrared, but not by means of quantum-absorption. [[Infrared sensing in snakes]] depends on a kind of natural [[thermal imaging]], in which tiny packets of cellular water are raised in temperature by the infrared radiation. EMR in this range causes molecular vibration and heating effects, which is how these animals detect it.\n\nAbove the range of visible light, ultraviolet light becomes invisible to humans, mostly because it is absorbed by the cornea below 360 [[nanometer|nm]] and the internal lens below 400&nbsp;nm. Furthermore, the [[rod cell|rods]] and [[cone cell|cones]] located in the [[retina]] of the human eye cannot detect the very short (below 360&nbsp;nm) ultraviolet wavelengths and are in fact damaged by ultraviolet.

The fixed value of the speed of light in SI units results from the fact that the meter is now defined in terms of the speed of light. All forms of electromagnetic radiation move at exactly this same speed in vacuum.\n\nDifferent [[physicist]]s have attempted to measure the speed of light throughout history. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] attempted to measure the speed of light in the seventeenth century. An early experiment to measure the speed of light was conducted by [[Ole R\u00f8mer]], a Danish physicist, in 1676. Using a [[telescope]], R\u00f8mer observed the motions of [[Jupiter]] and one of its [[natural satellite|moons]], [[Io (moon)|Io]]. Noting discrepancies in the apparent period of Io's orbit, he calculated that light takes about 22 minutes to traverse the diameter of Earth's orbit.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?view=body&id=pdf_1&handle=euclid.ss/1009212817 |title=Scientific Method, Statistical Method and the Speed of Light |journal=Statistical Science |year=2000 |volume=15 |pages=254\u2013278 |issue=3 |doi=10.1214/ss/1009212817 |mr=1847825|last1=Oldford |first1=R.

If R\u00f8mer had known the diameter of the Earth's orbit, he would have calculated a speed of 227,000,000&nbsp;m/s.\n\nAnother more accurate measurement of the speed of light was performed in Europe by [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] in 1849. Fizeau directed a beam of light at a mirror several kilometers away. A rotating [[cog wheel]] was placed in the path of the light beam as it traveled from the source, to the mirror and then returned to its origin.  Fizeau found that at a certain rate of rotation, the beam would pass through one gap in the wheel on the way out and the next gap on the way back. Knowing the distance to the mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel, and the rate of rotation, Fizeau was able to calculate the speed of light as 313,000,000&nbsp;m/s.\n\n[[L\u00e9on Foucault]] carried out an experiment which used rotating mirrors to obtain a value of 298,000,000&nbsp;m/s in 1862. [[Albert A. Michelson]] conducted experiments on the speed of light from 1877 until his death in 1931. He refined Foucault's methods in 1926 using improved rotating mirrors to measure the time it took light to make a round trip from [[Mount Wilson (California)|Mount Wilson]] to [[Mount San Antonio]] in California. The precise measurements yielded a speed of 299,796,000&nbsp;m/s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Michelson |first=A.A. |title=Measurements of the velocity of light between Mount Wilson and Mount San Antonio |journal=Astrophysical Journal |date=January 1927 |volume=65 |pages=1 |doi=10.1086/143021 |bibcode=1927ApJ....65....1M}}</ref>\n\nThe effective velocity of light in various transparent substances containing ordinary [[matter]], is less than in vacuum. For example, the speed of light in water is about 3/4 of that in vacuum.\n\nTwo independent teams of physicists were said to bring light to a \"complete standstill\" by passing it through a [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]] of the element [[rubidium]], one team at [[Harvard University]] and the [[Rowland Institute for Science]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the other at the [[Harvard\u2013Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]], also in Cambridge.<ref>{{cite web |author=Harvard News Office |url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2001/01.24/01-stoplight.html |title=Harvard Gazette: Researchers now able to stop, restart light |publisher=News.harvard.edu |date=24 January 2001 |accessdate=8 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028041346/http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2001/01.24/01-stoplight.html |archivedate=28 October 2011 }}</ref> However, the popular description of light being \"stopped\" in these experiments refers only to light being stored in the excited states of atoms, then re-emitted at an arbitrary later time, as stimulated by a second laser pulse. During the time it had \"stopped\" it had ceased to be light.\n\n==Optics==\n{{Main|Optics}}\n\nThe study of light and the interaction of light and [[matter]] is termed [[optics]]. The observation and study of [[optical phenomenon|optical phenomena]] such as [[rainbow]]s and the [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora borealis]] offer many clues as to the nature of light.\n\n===Refraction===\n{{Main|Refraction}}\n[[File:Refraction-with-soda-straw.jpg|thumb|250 px|An example of refraction of light. The straw appears bent, because of refraction of light as it enters liquid from air.]]\n[[File:Cloud in the sunlight.jpg|thumb|250px|A cloud illuminated by sunlight]]\n\nRefraction is the bending of light rays when passing through a surface between one transparent material and another. It is described by [[Snell's Law]]:\n\n:<math>n_1\\sin\\theta_1 = n_2\\sin\\theta_2\\ .</math>\n\nwhere \u03b8<sub>1</sub> is the angle between the ray and the [[Normal (geometry)|surface normal]] in the first medium, \u03b8<sub>2</sub> is the angle between the ray and the surface normal in the second medium, and n<sub>1</sub> and n<sub>2</sub> are the [[index of refraction|indices of refraction]], ''n'' = 1 in a [[vacuum]] and ''n'' > 1 in a [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]] [[Chemical substance|substance]].\n\nWhen a beam of light crosses the boundary between a vacuum and another medium, or between two different media, the wavelength of the light changes, but the frequency remains constant. If the beam of light is not [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] (or rather normal) to the boundary, the change in wavelength results in a change in the direction of the beam. This change of direction is known as [[refraction]].\n\nThe refractive quality of [[lens (optics)|lenses]] is frequently used to manipulate light in order to change the apparent size of images. [[Magnifying glass]]es, [[Glasses|spectacles]], [[contact lens]]es, [[microscope]]s and [[refracting telescope]]s are all examples of this manipulation.\n\n==Light sources== <!-- This section is linked from [[Source]] -->\n{{Redirect|Lightsource|the solar energy developer named Lightsource|Lightsource Renewable Energy}}\n{{Further|List of light sources}}\nThere are many sources of light. A body at a given temperature emits a characteristic spectrum of [[black-body]] radiation. A simple thermal source is sunlight, the radiation emitted by the [[chromosphere]] of the [[Sun]] at around  {{convert|6000|K|C F|abbr=off}} peaks in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum when plotted in wavelength units<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thulescientific.com/LYNCH%20&%20Soffer%20OPN%201999.pdf |title=Spectrum and the Color Sensitivity of the Eye |website=Thulescientific.com |accessdate=29 August 2017}}</ref> and roughly 44% of sunlight energy that reaches the ground is visible.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/spectra/am1.5/ |title=Reference Solar Spectral Irradiance: Air Mass 1.5 |accessdate=12 November 2009}}</ref> Another example is [[incandescent light bulb]]s, which emit only around 10% of their energy as visible light and the remainder as infrared. A common thermal light source in history is the glowing solid particles in [[fire|flames]], but these also emit most of their radiation in the infrared, and only a fraction in the visible spectrum.\n\nThe peak of the black-body spectrum is in the deep infrared, at about 10 [[micrometre|micrometer]] wavelength, for relatively cool objects like human beings. As the temperature increases, the peak shifts to shorter wavelengths, producing first a red glow, then a white one, and finally a blue-white color as the peak moves out of the visible part of the spectrum and into the ultraviolet. These colors can be seen when metal is heated to \"red hot\" or \"white hot\". Blue-white [[thermal emission]] is not often seen, except in stars (the commonly seen pure-blue color in a [[natural gas|gas]] flame or a [[Welding|welder's]] torch is in fact due to molecular emission, notably by CH radicals (emitting a wavelength band around 425&nbsp;nm, and is not seen in stars or pure thermal radiation).\n\nAtoms emit and absorb light at characteristic energies. This produces \"[[emission line]]s\" in the spectrum of each atom. [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|Emission]] can be [[spontaneous emission|spontaneous]], as in [[light-emitting diode]]s, [[gas discharge]] lamps (such as [[neon lamp]]s and [[neon sign]]s, [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s, etc.), and flames (light from the hot gas itself\u2014so, for example, [[sodium]] in a gas flame emits characteristic yellow light). Emission can also be [[stimulated emission|stimulated]], as in a [[laser]] or a microwave [[maser]].\n\nDeceleration of a free charged particle, such as an [[electron]], can produce visible radiation: [[cyclotron radiation]], [[synchrotron radiation]], and [[bremsstrahlung]] radiation are all examples of this. Particles moving through a medium faster than the speed of light in that medium can produce visible [[Cherenkov radiation]]. Certain chemicals produce visible radiation by [[chemoluminescence]]. In living things, this process is called [[bioluminescence]]. For example, [[firefly|fireflies]] produce light by this means, and boats moving through water can disturb plankton which produce a glowing wake.\n\nCertain substances produce light when they are illuminated by more energetic radiation, a process known as [[fluorescence]]. Some substances emit light slowly after excitation by more energetic radiation. This is known as [[phosphorescence]]. Phosphorescent materials can also be excited by bombarding them with subatomic particles. [[Cathodoluminescence]] is one example. This mechanism is used in [[cathode ray tube]] [[television set]]s and [[computer monitor]]s.\n\n[[File:Colorful artificial lighting at night.jpg|thumb|250px|Hong Kong illuminated by colorful [[lighting|artificial lighting.]]]]\n\nCertain other mechanisms can produce light:\n* [[Bioluminescence]]\n* [[Cherenkov radiation]]\n* [[Electroluminescence]]\n* [[Scintillation (physics)|Scintillation]]\n* [[Sonoluminescence]]\n* [[Triboluminescence]]\n\nWhen the concept of light is intended to include very-high-energy photons (gamma rays), additional generation mechanisms include:\n* Particle\u2013[[antiparticle]] annihilation\n* [[Radioactive decay]]\n\n==Units and measures==\n{{Main|Photometry (optics)|Radiometry}}\n\nLight is measured with two main alternative sets of units: [[radiometry]] consists of measurements of light power at all wavelengths, while [[photometry (optics)|photometry]] measures light with wavelength weighted with respect to a standardized model of human brightness perception.  Photometry is useful, for example, to quantify [[Illumination (lighting)]] intended for human use.  The SI units for both systems are summarized in the following tables.\n\n{{SI radiometry units|1|self|nb}}<!-- parameter 1 for table number, parameter 2 for compare destination page, parameter 3 for reference group -->\n{{SI light units|2|self|nb}}<!-- parameter 1 for table number, parameter 2 for compare destination page, parameter 3 for reference group -->\n\nThe photometry units are different from most systems of physical units in that they take into account how the human eye responds to light. The [[cone cell]]s in the human eye are of three types which respond differently across the visible spectrum, and the cumulative response peaks at a wavelength of around 555&nbsp;nm. Therefore, two sources of light which produce the same intensity (W/m<sup>2</sup>) of visible light do not necessarily appear equally bright. The photometry units are designed to take this into account, and therefore are a better representation of how \"bright\" a light appears to be than raw intensity. They relate to raw [[power (physics)|power]] by a quantity called [[luminous efficacy]], and are used for purposes like determining how to best achieve sufficient illumination for various tasks in indoor and outdoor settings. The illumination measured by a [[photocell]] sensor does not necessarily correspond to what is perceived by the human eye, and without filters which may be costly, photocells and [[charge-coupled device]]s (CCD) tend to respond to some [[infrared]], [[ultraviolet]] or both.\n\n==Light pressure==\n{{Main|Radiation pressure}}\nLight exerts physical pressure on objects in its path, a phenomenon which can be deduced by Maxwell's equations, but can be more easily explained by the particle nature of light: photons strike and transfer their momentum. Light pressure is equal to the power of the light beam divided by ''[[speed of light|c]]'', the speed of light.{{Spaces}} Due to the magnitude of ''c'', the effect of light pressure is negligible for everyday objects.{{Spaces}} For example, a one-milliwatt [[laser pointer]] exerts a force of about 3.3 [[newton (unit)|piconewtons]] on the object being illuminated; thus, one could lift a [[penny (United States coin)|U.S. penny]] with laser pointers, but doing so would require about 30 billion 1-mW laser pointers.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tang |first=Hong |title=May The Force of Light Be With You |journal=IEEE Spectrum |date=1 October 2009 |volume=46 |issue=10 |pages=46\u201351 |doi=10.1109/MSPEC.2009.5268000}}</ref>{{Spaces}} However, in [[nanometre]]-scale applications such as [[nanoelectromechanical systems]] (|NEMS), the effect of light pressure is more significant, and exploiting light pressure to drive NEMS mechanisms and to flip nanometre-scale physical switches in integrated circuits is an active area of research.<ref>See, for example, [http://www.eng.yale.edu/tanglab/research.htm nano-opto-mechanical systems research at Yale University].</ref> At larger scales, light pressure can cause [[asteroid]]s to spin faster,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2004/feb/asteroids-get-spun-by-the-sun/ |title=Asteroids Get Spun By the Sun |author=Kathy A. |website=Discover Magazine |date=5 February 2004}}</ref> acting on their irregular shapes as on the vanes of a [[windmill]].{{Spaces}} The possibility of making [[solar sail]]s that would accelerate spaceships in space is also under investigation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/roboticexplorers/solar_sails.html |title=Solar Sails Could Send Spacecraft 'Sailing' Through Space |website=NASA |date=31 August 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/news/releases/2004/04-208.html |title=NASA team successfully deploys two solar sail systems |website=NASA |date=9 August 2004}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the motion of the [[Crookes radiometer]] was originally attributed to light pressure, this interpretation is incorrect; the characteristic Crookes rotation is the result of a partial vacuum.<ref>P.

He wrote, \"radiation will exert pressure on both sides of the plate. The forces of pressure exerted on the two sides are equal if the plate is at rest. However, if it is in motion, more radiation will be reflected on the surface that is ahead during the motion (front surface) than on the back surface. The backwardacting force of pressure exerted on the front surface is thus larger than the force of pressure acting on the back. Hence, as the resultant of the two forces, there remains a force that counteracts the motion of the plate and that increases with the velocity of the plate. We will call this resultant 'radiation friction' in brief.\"\n\nUsually light momentum is aligned with its direction of motion.

[[Isaac Newton]] studied Gassendi's work at an early age, and preferred his view to Descartes' theory of the ''plenum''. He stated in his ''Hypothesis of Light'' of 1675 that light was composed of [[Corpuscularianism|corpuscles]] (particles of matter) which were emitted in all directions from a source. One of Newton's arguments against the wave nature of light was that waves were known to bend around obstacles, while light travelled only in straight lines. He did, however, explain the phenomenon of the [[diffraction]] of light (which had been observed by [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi|Francesco Grimaldi]]) by allowing that a light particle could create a localised wave in the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]].\n\nNewton's theory could be used to predict the [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] of light, but could only explain [[refraction]] by incorrectly assuming that light accelerated upon entering a denser [[Medium (optics)|medium]] because the [[gravity|gravitational]] pull was greater. Newton published the final version of his theory in his ''[[Opticks]]'' of 1704. His reputation helped the [[particle theory of light]] to hold sway during the 18th century. The particle theory of light led [[Laplace]] to argue that a body could be so massive that light could not escape from it. In other words, it would become what is now called a [[black hole]]. Laplace withdrew his suggestion later, after a wave theory of light became firmly established as the model for light (as has been explained, neither a particle or wave theory is fully correct). A translation of Newton's essay on light appears in ''The large scale structure of space-time'', by [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[George F. R. Ellis]].\n\nThe fact that light could be [[polarized light|polarized]] was for the first time qualitatively explained by Newton using the particle theory. [[\u00c9tienne-Louis Malus]] in 1810 created a mathematical particle theory of polarization. [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] in 1812 showed that this theory explained all known phenomena of light polarization. At that time the polarization was considered as the proof of the particle theory.\n\n=== Wave theory ===\nTo explain the origin of [[color]]s, [[Robert Hooke]] (1635\u20131703) developed a \"pulse theory\" and compared the spreading of light to that of waves in water in his 1665 work ''[[Micrographia]]'' (\"Observation IX\"). In 1672 Hooke suggested that light's vibrations could be [[perpendicular]] to the direction of propagation. [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629\u20131695) worked out a mathematical wave theory of light in 1678, and published it in his ''[[Treatise on light]]'' in 1690. He proposed that light was emitted in all directions as a series of waves in a medium called the ''[[Luminiferous ether]]''.  As waves are not affected by gravity, it was assumed that they slowed down upon entering a denser medium.<ref>Fokko Jan Dijksterhuis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cPFevyomPUIC Lenses and Waves: Christiaan Huygens and the Mathematical Science of Optics in the 17th Century], Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2004, {{ISBN|1-4020-2697-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Christiaan Huygens-painting.jpeg|thumb|200 px|[[Christiaan Huygens]].]]\n\n[[File:Young Diffraction.png|right|thumb|200px|[[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]]'s sketch of a [[double-slit experiment]] showing [[diffraction]]. Young's experiments supported the theory that light consists of waves.]]\n\nThe wave theory predicted that light waves could interfere with each other like sound waves (as noted around 1800 by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]]). Young showed by means of a [[double-slit experiment|diffraction experiment]] that light behaved as waves. He also proposed that different [[color]]s were caused by different [[wavelength]]s of light, and explained color vision in terms of three-colored receptors in the eye. Another supporter of the wave theory was [[Leonhard Euler]]. He argued in ''Nova theoria lucis et colorum'' (1746) that [[diffraction]] could more easily be explained by a wave theory. In 1816 [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]] gave [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] an idea that the polarization of light can be explained by the wave theory if light were a [[transverse wave]].<ref>James R. Hofmann, ''Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re: Enlightenment and Electrodynamics'', Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 222.</ref>\n\nLater, Fresnel independently worked out his own wave theory of light, and presented it to the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences]] in 1817. [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson]] added to Fresnel's mathematical work to produce a convincing argument in favor of the wave theory, helping to overturn Newton's corpuscular theory.{{dubious|date=June 2018}}<!-- [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson]] says he was an opponent of the theory --> By the year 1821, Fresnel was able to show via mathematical methods that polarization could be explained by the wave theory of light if and only if light was entirely transverse, with no longitudinal vibration whatsoever.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe weakness of the wave theory was that light waves, like sound waves, would need a medium for transmission. The existence of the hypothetical substance ''luminiferous aether'' proposed by Huygens in 1678 was cast into strong doubt in the late nineteenth century by the [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]].\n\nNewton's corpuscular theory implied that light would travel faster in a denser medium, while the wave theory of Huygens and others implied the opposite. At that time, the [[speed of light]] could not be measured accurately enough to decide which theory was correct. The first to make a sufficiently accurate measurement was [[L\u00e9on Foucault]], in 1850.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Understanding Physics |author1=David Cassidy |author2=Gerald Holton |author3=James Rutherford |publisher=Birkh\u00e4user |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-387-98756-9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=rpQo7f9F1xUC&pg=PA382}}</ref> His result supported the wave theory, and the classical particle theory was finally abandoned, only to partly re-emerge in the 20th century.\n\n===Electromagnetic theory===\n{{Main|Electromagnetic radiation}}\n[[File:light-wave.svg|360px|thumb|A 3\u2013dimensional rendering of [[Polarization (waves)|linearly polarized]] light wave frozen in time and showing the two oscillating components of light; an [[electric field]] and a [[magnetic field]] perpendicular to each other and to the direction of motion (a [[transverse wave]]).]]\n\nIn 1845, [[Michael Faraday]] discovered that the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light is rotated when the light rays travel along the [[magnetic field]] direction in the presence of a transparent [[dielectric]], an effect now known as [[Faraday rotation]].<ref name=\"LongairMalcolm\">{{cite book |last=Longair |first=Malcolm |title=Theoretical Concepts in Physics |year=2003 |page=87}}</ref> This was the first evidence that light was related to [[electromagnetism]].

Maxwell discovered that self-propagating electromagnetic waves would travel through space at a constant speed, which happened to be equal to the previously measured speed of light. From this, Maxwell concluded that light was a form of electromagnetic radiation: he first stated this result in 1862 in ''On Physical Lines of Force''. In 1873, he published ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'', which contained a full mathematical description of the behavior of electric and magnetic fields, still known as [[Maxwell's equations]]. Soon after, [[Heinrich Hertz]] confirmed Maxwell's theory experimentally by generating and detecting radio waves in the laboratory, and demonstrating that these waves behaved exactly like visible light, exhibiting properties such as reflection, refraction, diffraction, and interference. Maxwell's theory and Hertz's experiments led directly to the development of modern radio, radar, television, electromagnetic imaging, and wireless communications.\n\nIn the quantum theory, photons are seen as [[wave packet]]s of the waves described in the classical theory of Maxwell. The quantum theory was needed to explain effects even with visual light that Maxwell's classical theory could not (such as [[spectral line]]s).\n\n===Quantum theory===\nIn 1900 [[Max Planck]], attempting to explain [[black-body radiation]] suggested that although light was a wave, these waves could gain or lose energy only in finite amounts related to their frequency. Planck called these \"lumps\" of light energy \"[[quantum|quanta]]\" (from a Latin word for \"how much\"). In 1905, Albert Einstein used the idea of light quanta to explain the [[photoelectric effect]], and suggested that these light quanta had a \"real\" existence. In 1923 [[Arthur Holly Compton]] showed that the wavelength shift seen when low intensity X-rays scattered from electrons (so called [[Compton scattering]]) could be explained by a particle-theory of X-rays, but not a wave theory. In 1926 [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] named these light quanta particles [[photon]]s.<ref>{{Open access}} {{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/IntroductionToMolecularSpectroscopy |title=Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy |last=Barrow |first=Gordon M. |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1962 |format=Scanned PDF |lccn=62-12478}}</ref>\n\nEventually the modern theory of [[quantum mechanics]] came to picture light as (in some sense) ''both'' a particle and a wave, and (in another sense), as a phenomenon which is ''neither'' a particle nor a wave (which actually are macroscopic phenomena, such as baseballs or ocean waves). Instead, modern physics sees light as something that can be described sometimes with mathematics appropriate to one type of macroscopic metaphor (particles), and sometimes another macroscopic metaphor (water waves), but is actually something that cannot be fully imagined. As in the case for radio waves and the X-rays involved in Compton scattering, physicists have noted that electromagnetic radiation tends to behave more like a classical wave at lower frequencies, but more like a classical particle at higher frequencies, but never completely loses all qualities of one or the other. Visible light, which occupies a middle ground in frequency, can easily be shown in experiments to be describable using either a wave or particle model, or sometimes both.\n\nIn February 2018, scientists reported, for the first time, the discovery of a new form of light, which may involve [[polariton]]s, that could be useful in the development of [[quantum computer]]s.<ref name=\"NW-20180216\">{{cite web |last=Hignett |first=Katherine |title=Physics Creates New Form of Light That Could Drive The Quantum Computing Revolution |url=http://www.newsweek.com/photons-light-physics-808862 |date=16 February 2018 |website=Newsweek |accessdate=17 February 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"SCI-20180216\">{{cite journal |author=Liang, Qi-Yu|display-authors=etal|title=Observation of three-photon bound states in a quantum nonlinear medium |date=16 February 2018 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=359 |issue=6377 |pages=783\u2013786 |doi=10.1126/science.aao7293 |pmid=29449489 |pmc=6467536|arxiv=1709.01478 |bibcode=2018Sci...359..783L }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Physics|Science}}\n{{div col|colwidth=13em}}\n* [[Automotive lighting]]\n* [[Ballistic photon]]\n* [[Black-body radiation]]\n* [[Color temperature]]\n* [[Fermat's principle]]\n* [[Huygens' principle]]\n* [[Incandescent light bulb]]\n* [[International Commission on Illumination]]\n* ''[[Journal of Luminescence]]''\n* [[Light art]]\n* [[Light beam]] \u2013 in particular about light beams visible from the side\n* [[Light Fantastic (TV series)]]\n* [[Light mill]]\n* [[Light painting]]\n* [[Light pollution]]\n* [[Light therapy]]\n* [[Lighting]]\n* [[List of light sources]]\n* ''[[Luminescence: The Journal of Biological and Chemical Luminescence]]''\n* [[Photic sneeze reflex]]\n* [[Photometry (optics)|Photometry]]\n* [[Photon]]\n* [[Right to light]]\n* [[Risks and benefits of sun exposure]]\n* [[Spectroscopy]]\n* [[Visible spectrum]]\n* [[Wave\u2013particle duality]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons-inline|Light}}\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n* {{Wikiquote-inline}}\n* {{Britannica|340440|Light (physics)}}\n* {{LEDV|27859}}\n{{Radiation}}\n{{Color topics}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Light| ]]\n[[Category:Radiation]]\n", "name_user": "Commuter3", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOptics:Multiple link changes, clearer caption", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"}
