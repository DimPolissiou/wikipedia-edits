{"title_page": "Uncontrolled decompression", "text_new": "{{short description|An unplanned drop in the pressure of a sealed system }}\n'''Uncontrolled decompression''' is an unplanned drop in the [[pressure]] of a sealed system, such as an [[aircraft cabin]] or [[hyperbaric chamber]], and typically results from [[human reliability|human error]], [[fatigue (material)|material fatigue]], [[engineering]] failure, or [[impact (mechanics)|impact]], causing a [[pressure vessel]] to vent into its lower-pressure surroundings or fail to pressurize at all.\n\nSuch decompression may be classed as ''Explosive, Rapid'', or ''Slow'':\n* '''Explosive decompression''' (ED) is violent, the decompression being too fast for air to safely escape from the [[lung]]s.\n* '''Rapid decompression''', while still fast, is slow enough to allow the lungs to vent.\n* '''Slow''' or '''gradual decompression''' occurs so slowly that it may not be sensed before [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] sets in.\n\n==Description==\nThe term ''uncontrolled decompression'' here refers to the unplanned depressurisation of [[pressure vessel|vessels]] that are occupied by people; for example, a [[cabin pressurization|pressurised aircraft cabin]] at high altitude, a [[spacecraft]], or a [[hyperbaric chamber]]. For the catastrophic failure of other pressure vessels used to contain [[gas]], [[liquid]]s, or [[reactant]]s under pressure, the term [[explosion]] is more commonly used, or other specialised terms such as [[BLEVE]] may apply to particular situations.\n\nDecompression can occur due to structural failure of the pressure vessel, or failure of the compression system itself.<ref name=\"FAA-OPS\">{{cite web|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Administration]] |url=http://www.faa.gov/pilots/training/airman_education/media/ac%2061-107a.pdf|date=2007-07-15 |title=AC 61-107A \u2013 Operations of aircraft at altitudes above 25,000 feet msl and/or mach numbers (MMO) greater than .75|accessdate=2008-07-29}}</ref><ref name=Dehart>{{cite book |title=Fundamentals Of Aerospace Medicine: Translating Research Into Clinical Applications, 3rd Rev Ed.|last=Dehart|first=R.

Military pilots with [[oxygen mask]]s have to pressure-breathe, whereby the lungs fill with air when relaxed, and effort has to be exerted to expel the air again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aupress.au.af.mil/digital/pdf/book/brulle_engineering_space_age.pdf|title=Engineering the Space Age: A Rocket Scientist Remembers|author=Robert V.

An example of this is the 2005 [[Helios Airways Flight 522]] crash, in which the pilots failed to check the aircraft was pressurising automatically and then to react to the warnings that the aircraft was depressurising, eventually losing consciousness (along with most of the passengers and crew) from [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].\n\n==Pressure vessel seals and testing==\nSeals in high-pressure vessels are also susceptible to explosive decompression; the [[O-ring]]s or [[rubber]] [[gasket]]s used to seal pressurised pipelines tend to become saturated with high-pressure [[gas]]es. If the pressure inside the vessel is suddenly released, then the gases within the rubber gasket may expand violently, causing blistering or explosion of the material. For this reason, it is common for military and industrial equipment to be subjected to an explosive decompression test before it is certified as safe for use.\n\n==Myths==\n\n===Exposure to a vacuum causes the body to explode===\n{{See also|Effect of spaceflight on the human body}}\n\nThis  [[Urban legend|persistent myth]] is based on a failure to distinguish between two types of decompression and their exaggerated portrayal in some [[fiction|fictional works]]. The first type of decompression deals with changing from normal atmospheric pressure (one [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]]) to a vacuum (zero atmosphere) which is usually centered around [[space exploration]]. The second type of decompression changes from exceptionally high pressure (many atmospheres) to normal atmospheric pressure (one atmosphere) as what would be found from [[deep-sea diving]].\n\nThe first type is more common as pressure reduction from normal atmospheric pressure to a vacuum can be found in both space exploration and high-altitudes [[aviation]].

In 1974, explosive decompression onboard [[Turkish Airlines Flight 981]] caused the floor to collapse, severing vital flight control cables in the process. The [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] issued an [[Airworthiness Directive]] the following year requiring manufacturers of wide-body aircraft to strengthen floors so that they could withstand the effects of in-flight decompression caused by an opening of up to {{convert|20|sqft|m2}} in the lower deck cargo compartment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/about/media/b-chron.pdf|title=FAA Historical Chronology, 1926\u20131996|date=2005-02-18|accessdate=2008-09-01|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Authority]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080624211236/http://www.faa.gov/about/media/b-chron.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-06-24}}</ref>  Manufacturers were able to comply with the Directive either by strengthening the floors and/or installing relief vents called \"[[Dado (architecture)|dado panels]]\" between the passenger cabin and the cargo compartment.<ref>{{patent|US|6273365}}</ref>\n\nCabin doors are designed to make it nearly impossible to lose pressurization through opening a cabin door in flight, either accidentally or intentionally. The [[plug door]] design ensures that when the pressure inside the cabin exceeds the pressure outside the doors are forced shut and will not open until the pressure is equalised. Cabin doors, including the emergency exits, but not all cargo doors, open inwards, or must first be pulled inwards and then rotated before they can be pushed out through the door frame because at least one dimension of the door is larger than the door frame.  Pressurization prevented the doors of [[Saudia Flight 163]] from being opened on the ground after the aircraft made a successful emergency landing, resulting in the deaths of all 287 passengers and 14 crew members from fire and smoke.\n\nPrior to 1996, approximately 6,000 large commercial transport airplanes were [[type certificate|type certified]] to fly up to {{convert|45000|ft}}, without being required to meet special conditions related to flight at high altitude.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library%5CrgPolicy.nsf/0/90AA20C2F35901D98625713F0056B1B8?OpenDocument|title=Final Policy FAR Part 25 Sec. 25.841 07/05/1996&#124;Attachment 4}}</ref> In 1996, the FAA adopted Amendment 25\u201387, which imposed additional high-altitude cabin-pressure specifications, for new designs of aircraft types.<ref name=\"FAA_25.841\">{{cite web|url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgFAR.nsf/0/FED94F31539484AB852566720051AA5D?OpenDocument|title=Section 25.841: Airworthiness Standards: Transport Category Airplanes|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Administration]]|date=1996-05-07|accessdate=2008-10-02}}</ref>  For aircraft [[type certificate|certified]] to operate above 25,000 feet (FL 250; 7,600 m), it \"must be designed so that occupants will not be exposed to cabin pressure altitudes in excess of {{convert|15000|ft}} after any probable failure condition in the pressurization system.\"<ref name=\"FARs, 14 CFR, Part 25, Section 841\">{{cite web|url=http://www.flightsimaviation.com/data/FARS/part_25-841.html|title=FARs, 14 CFR, Part 25, Section 841}}</ref> In the event of a decompression which results from \"any failure condition not shown to be extremely improbable,\" the aircraft must be designed so that occupants will not be exposed to a cabin altitude exceeding {{convert|25000|ft}} for more than 2 minutes, nor exceeding an altitude of {{convert|40000|ft}} at any time.<ref name=\"FARs, 14 CFR, Part 25, Section 841\"/>  In practice, that new FAR amendment imposes an operational [[Ceiling (aeronautics)|ceiling]] of 40,000 feet on the majority of newly designed commercial aircraft.<ref name=\"Exemption No. 8695\">{{cite web|url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgEX.nsf/0/9929ce16709cad0f8625713f00551e74/$FILE/8695.doc|title=Exemption No. 8695|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Authority]]|date=2006-03-24|location=Renton, Washington|accessdate=2008-10-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library%5CrgPolicy.nsf/0/90AA20C2F35901D98625713F0056B1B8?OpenDocument|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Authority]]|date=2006-03-24|title=PS-ANM-03-112-16|accessdate=2009-09-23|author=Steve Happenny}}</ref><ref group=\"Note\">Notable exceptions include the [[Airbus A380]], [[Boeing 787]], and [[Concorde]]</ref>\n\nIn 2004, [[Airbus]] successfully petitioned the FAA to allow cabin pressure of the [[Airbus A380|A380]] to reach {{convert|43000|ft}} in the event of a decompression incident and to exceed {{convert|40000|ft}} for one minute.

and the crew was able to take some immediate actions after vehicle breakup, although the loads experienced were  much higher as a result of the aerodynamic loads (estimated at 16 G to 21 G).5  The Challenger crew became  incapacitated quickly and could not complete activation of all breathing air systems, leading to the conclusion that an incapacitating cabin depressurization occurred. By comparison, the Columbia crew experienced  lower loads (~3.5 G) at the CE. The fact that none of the crew members lowered their visors strongly  suggests that the crew was incapacitated after the CE by a rapid depressurization.  Although no quantitative conclusion can be made regarding the cabin depressurization rate, it is probable  that the cabin depressurization rate was high enough to incapacitate the crew in a matter of seconds. Conclusion L1-5. The depressurization incapacitated the crew members so rapidly that they were not able to lower their helmet visors.}}</ref>\n| Damage to orbiter [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]] at liftoff, leading to disintegration during reentry\n|-\n|[[Pinnacle Airlines Flight 3701]]\n|2004\n|[[Bombardier CRJ100/200|Bombardier CRJ-200]]\n|Accident\n|2/2\n|Gradual decompression\n|Engine flameout\n|-\n|[[Helios Airways Flight 522]]\n| 2005\n|[[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]]\n| Accident\n|{{ntsh|121}}121/121\n| Gradual decompression\n| Pressurization system set to manual for the entire flight<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/pio/pio.nsf/All/F15FBD7320037284C2257204002B6243/$file/FINAL%20REPORT%205B-DBY.pdf|title=Aircraft Accident Report \u2013 Helios Airways Flight HCY522 Boeing 737-31S at Grammatike, Hellas on 14 August 2005|publisher=Hellenic Republic Ministry Of Transport & Communications: Air Accident Investigation & Aviation Safety Board|date=Nov 2006|accessdate=2009-07-14}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Alaska Airlines]] Flight 536\n| 2005\n| [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80]]\n| Incident\n| {{ntsh|0}}0/142\n| Rapid decompression\n| Failure of operator to report collision involving a [[Ground support equipment|baggage loading cart]] at the departure gate<ref>{{cite web |url=http://investigativereportingworkshop.org/flying-cheap/incident/20051229X02026/1/ |title=Airline Accident: Accident \u2013 Dec. 26, 2005 \u2013 Seattle, Wash. |website=Investigative Reporting Workshop |accessdate=2017-08-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120223757/http://investigativereportingworkshop.org/flying-cheap/incident/20051229X02026/1/# |archive-date=2018-01-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Gol Transportes A\u00e9reos Flight 1907]]\n| 2006\n| [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-800]]\n| Accident\n| {{ntsh|154}}154/154\n| Explosive decompression\n| Mid-air collision\n|-\n| [[Adam Air Flight 574]]\n| 2007\n| [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-400]]\n| Accident\n| {{ntsh|102}}102/102\n| Explosive decompression\n| Mid-air breakup\n|-\n| [[Qantas Flight 30]]\n| 2008\n| [[Boeing 747-400]]\n| Incident\n| {{ntsh|0}}0/365\n| Rapid decompression<ref name=\"ATSB_200824\">{{cite press release\n  | title = Qantas Boeing 747-400 depressurisation and diversion to Manila on 25 July 2008\n  | publisher = [[Australian Transport Safety Bureau]]\n  | date = 2008-07-28\n  | url = http://www.atsb.gov.au/newsroom/2008/release/2008_24.aspx\n  | accessdate = 2008-07-28 }}\n</ref>\n| Fuselage ruptured by [[Oxygen tank|oxygen cylinder]] explosion\n|-\n| [[Southwest Airlines Flight 2294]]\n| 2009\n| [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]]\n| Incident\n| {{ntsh|0}}0/131\n| Rapid decompression\n| Metal fatigue<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8150346.stm|title=Hole in US plane forces landing|date=2009-07-14|accessdate=2009-07-15|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Southwest Airlines Flight 812]]\n| 2011\n| [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]]\n| Incident\n| {{ntsh|0}}0/123\n| Rapid decompression\n| Metal fatigue<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/04/03/southwest-jet-pre-existing-fatigue/?test=latestnews | work=Fox News | title=Southwest Jet Had Pre-existing Fatigue | date=2011-04-03}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]]\n| 2014\n| [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200ER]]\n| Shootdown\n| {{ntsh|298}}298/298\n| Explosive decompression\n| Shot down by a [[Buk missile system|Buk]] surface-to-air missile launcher;

An example of this is the 2005 [[Helios Airways Flight 522]] crash, in which the pilots failed to check the aircraft was pressurising automatically and then to react to the warnings that the aircraft was depressurising, eventually losing consciousness (along with most of the passengers and crew) from [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].\n\n==Pressure vessel seals and testing==\nSeals in high-pressure vessels are also susceptible to explosive decompression; the [[O-ring]]s or [[rubber]] [[gasket]]s used to seal pressurised pipelines tend to become saturated with high-pressure [[gas]]es. If the pressure inside the vessel is suddenly released, then the gases within the rubber gasket may expand violently, causing blistering or explosion of the material. For this reason, it is common for military and industrial equipment to be subjected to an explosive decompression test before it is certified as safe for use.\n\n==Myths==\n\n===Exposure to a vacuum causes the body to explode===\n{{See also|Effect of spaceflight on the human body}}\n\nThis  [[Urban legend|persistent myth]] is based on a failure to distinguish between two types of decompression and their exaggerated portrayal in some [[fiction|fictional works]]. The first type of decompression deals with changing from normal atmospheric pressure (one [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]]) to a vacuum (zero atmosphere) which is usually centered around [[space exploration]]. The second type of decompression changes from exceptionally high pressure (many atmospheres) to normal atmospheric pressure (one atmosphere) as what would be found from [[deep-sea diving]].\n\nThe first type is more common as pressure reduction from normal atmospheric pressure to a vacuum can be found in both space exploration and high-altitudes [[aviation]]. Research and experience have shown that while [[Effect of spaceflight on the human body#Space environments|exposure to a vacuum]] causes swelling, [[skin|human skin]] is tough enough to withstand the drop of one [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]].<ref name=\"Barratt\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi2691.htm|title=No. 2691 THE BODY AT VACUUM|work=www.uh.edu|author=Michael Barratt|accessdate=April 19, 2018|author-link=Michael Barratt (astronaut)}}</ref><ref name=\"Kruszelnicki\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2005/04/07/1320013.htm|title=Exploding Body in Vacuum|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)]]|author=Karl Kruszelnicki|date=April 7, 2005|accessdate=April 19, 2018|author-link=Karl Kruszelnicki}}</ref> The most serious risk from vacuum exposure is [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], in which the body is starved of [[oxygen]] that leads to unconsciousness within a few seconds.<ref name=\"FAA\" >{{cite web|title=Advisory Circular 61-107 |url=http://www.faa.gov/pilots/training/airman_education/media/AC%2061-107A.pdf|pages=table 1.1|publisher=[[FAA]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Flight Surgeon's Guide|chapter-url=http://wwwsam.brooks.af.mil/af/files/fsguide/HTML/Chapter_02.html|chapter=2|publisher=[[United States Air Force]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316011544/http://wwwsam.brooks.af.mil/af/files/fsguide/HTML/Chapter_02.html|archivedate=2007-03-16}}</ref> Rapid uncontrolled decompression can be much more dangerous than vacuum exposure itself.

In 1974, explosive decompression onboard [[Turkish Airlines Flight 981]] caused the floor to collapse, severing vital flight control cables in the process. The [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] issued an [[Airworthiness Directive]] the following year requiring manufacturers of wide-body aircraft to strengthen floors so that they could withstand the effects of in-flight decompression caused by an opening of up to {{convert|20|sqft|m2}} in the lower deck cargo compartment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/about/media/b-chron.pdf|title=FAA Historical Chronology, 1926\u20131996|date=2005-02-18|accessdate=2008-09-01|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Authority]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080624211236/http://www.faa.gov/about/media/b-chron.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-06-24}}</ref>  Manufacturers were able to comply with the Directive either by strengthening the floors and/or installing relief vents called \"[[Dado (architecture)|dado panels]]\" between the passenger cabin and the cargo compartment.<ref>{{patent|US|6273365}}</ref>\n\nCabin doors are designed to make it nearly impossible to lose pressurization through opening a cabin door in flight, either accidentally or intentionally. The [[plug door]] design ensures that when the pressure inside the cabin exceeds the pressure outside the doors are forced shut and will not open until the pressure is equalised. Cabin doors, including the emergency exits, but not all cargo doors, open inwards, or must first be pulled inwards and then rotated before they can be pushed out through the door frame because at least one dimension of the door is larger than the door frame.  Pressurization prevented the doors of [[Saudia Flight 163]] from being opened on the ground after the aircraft made a successful emergency landing, resulting in the deaths of all 287 passengers and 14 crew members from fire and smoke.\n\nPrior to 1996, approximately 6,000 large commercial transport airplanes were [[type certificate|type certified]] to fly up to {{convert|45000|ft}}, without being required to meet special conditions related to flight at high altitude.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library%5CrgPolicy.nsf/0/90AA20C2F35901D98625713F0056B1B8?OpenDocument|title=Final Policy FAR Part 25 Sec. 25.841 07/05/1996&#124;Attachment 4}}</ref> In 1996, the FAA adopted Amendment 25\u201387, which imposed additional high-altitude cabin-pressure specifications, for new designs of aircraft types.<ref name=\"FAA_25.841\">{{cite web|url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgFAR.nsf/0/FED94F31539484AB852566720051AA5D?OpenDocument|title=Section 25.841: Airworthiness Standards: Transport Category Airplanes|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Administration]]|date=1996-05-07|accessdate=2008-10-02}}</ref>  For aircraft [[type certificate|certified]] to operate above 25,000 feet (FL 250; 7,600 m), it \"must be designed so that occupants will not be exposed to cabin pressure altitudes in excess of {{convert|15000|ft}} after any probable failure condition in the pressurization system.\"<ref name=\"FARs, 14 CFR, Part 25, Section 841\">{{cite web|url=http://www.flightsimaviation.com/data/FARS/part_25-841.html|title=FARs, 14 CFR, Part 25, Section 841}}</ref> In the event of a decompression which results from \"any failure condition not shown to be extremely improbable,\" the aircraft must be designed so that occupants will not be exposed to a cabin altitude exceeding {{convert|25000|ft}} for more than 2 minutes, nor exceeding an altitude of {{convert|40000|ft}} at any time.<ref name=\"FARs, 14 CFR, Part 25, Section 841\"/>  In practice, that new FAR amendment imposes an operational [[Ceiling (aeronautics)|ceiling]] of 40,000 feet on the majority of newly designed commercial aircraft.<ref name=\"Exemption No. 8695\">{{cite web|url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgEX.nsf/0/9929ce16709cad0f8625713f00551e74/$FILE/8695.doc|title=Exemption No. 8695|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Authority]]|date=2006-03-24|location=Renton, Washington|accessdate=2008-10-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library%5CrgPolicy.nsf/0/90AA20C2F35901D98625713F0056B1B8?OpenDocument|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Authority]]|date=2006-03-24|title=PS-ANM-03-112-16|accessdate=2009-09-23|author=Steve Happenny}}</ref><ref group=\"Note\">Notable exceptions include the [[Airbus A380]], [[Boeing 787]], and [[Concorde]]</ref>\n\nIn 2004, [[Airbus]] successfully petitioned the FAA to allow cabin pressure of the [[Airbus A380|A380]] to reach {{convert|43000|ft}} in the event of a decompression incident and to exceed {{convert|40000|ft}} for one minute.

and the crew was able to take some immediate actions after vehicle breakup, although the loads experienced were  much higher as a result of the aerodynamic loads (estimated at 16 G to 21 G).5  The Challenger crew became  incapacitated quickly and could not complete activation of all breathing air systems, leading to the conclusion that an incapacitating cabin depressurization occurred. By comparison, the Columbia crew experienced  lower loads (~3.5 G) at the CE. The fact that none of the crew members lowered their visors strongly  suggests that the crew was incapacitated after the CE by a rapid depressurization.  Although no quantitative conclusion can be made regarding the cabin depressurization rate, it is probable  that the cabin depressurization rate was high enough to incapacitate the crew in a matter of seconds. Conclusion L1-5. The depressurization incapacitated the crew members so rapidly that they were not able to lower their helmet visors.}}</ref>\n| Damage to orbiter [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]] at liftoff, leading to disintegration during reentry\n|-\n|[[Pinnacle Airlines Flight 3701]]\n|2004\n|[[Bombardier CRJ100/200|Bombardier CRJ-200]]\n|Accident\n|2/2\n|Gradual decompression\n|Engine flameout\n|-\n|[[Helios Airways Flight 522]]\n| 2005\n|[[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]]\n| Accident\n|{{ntsh|121}}121/121\n| Gradual decompression\n| Pressurization system set to manual for the entire flight<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/pio/pio.nsf/All/F15FBD7320037284C2257204002B6243/$file/FINAL%20REPORT%205B-DBY.pdf|title=Aircraft Accident Report \u2013 Helios Airways Flight HCY522 Boeing 737-31S at Grammatike, Hellas on 14 August 2005|publisher=Hellenic Republic Ministry Of Transport & Communications: Air Accident Investigation & Aviation Safety Board|date=Nov 2006|accessdate=2009-07-14}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Alaska Airlines]] Flight 536\n| 2005\n| [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80]]\n| Incident\n| {{ntsh|0}}0/142\n| Rapid decompression\n| Failure of operator to report collision involving a [[Ground support equipment|baggage loading cart]] at the departure gate<ref>{{cite web |url=http://investigativereportingworkshop.org/flying-cheap/incident/20051229X02026/1/ |title=Airline Accident: Accident \u2013 Dec. 26, 2005 \u2013 Seattle, Wash. |website=Investigative Reporting Workshop |accessdate=2017-08-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120223757/http://investigativereportingworkshop.org/flying-cheap/incident/20051229X02026/1/# |archive-date=2018-01-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Gol Transportes A\u00e9reos Flight 1907]]\n| 2006\n| [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-800]]\n| Accident\n| {{ntsh|154}}154/154\n| Explosive decompression\n| Mid-air collision\n|-\n| [[Adam Air Flight 574]]\n| 2007\n| [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-400]]\n| Accident\n| {{ntsh|102}}102/102\n| Explosive decompression\n| Mid-air breakup\n|-\n| [[Qantas Flight 30]]\n| 2008\n| [[Boeing 747-400]]\n| Incident\n| {{ntsh|0}}0/365\n| Rapid decompression<ref name=\"ATSB_200824\">{{cite press release\n  | title = Qantas Boeing 747-400 depressurisation and diversion to Manila on 25 July 2008\n  | publisher = [[Australian Transport Safety Bureau]]\n  | date = 2008-07-28\n  | url = http://www.atsb.gov.au/newsroom/2008/release/2008_24.aspx\n  | accessdate = 2008-07-28 }}\n</ref>\n| Fuselage ruptured by [[Oxygen tank|oxygen cylinder]] explosion\n|-\n| [[Southwest Airlines Flight 2294]]\n| 2009\n| [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]]\n| Incident\n| {{ntsh|0}}0/131\n| Rapid decompression\n| Metal fatigue<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8150346.stm|title=Hole in US plane forces landing|date=2009-07-14|accessdate=2009-07-15|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Southwest Airlines Flight 812]]\n| 2011\n| [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]]\n| Incident\n| {{ntsh|0}}0/123\n| Rapid decompression\n| Metal fatigue<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/04/03/southwest-jet-pre-existing-fatigue/?test=latestnews | work=Fox News | title=Southwest Jet Had Pre-existing Fatigue | date=2011-04-03}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]]\n| 2014\n| [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200ER]]\n| Shootdown\n| {{ntsh|298}}298/298\n| Explosive decompression\n| Shot down by a [[Buk missile system|Buk]] surface-to-air missile launcher;

Whilst ''The F\u2013Z of Pop'' contained three re-recordings of past Bucks Fizz hits as well as eight new compositions, it was agreed that moving forward the group would now focus solely on new material. The group went back into the studio in summer 2018 to begin recording for the new album. Fairly early on into the recording process [[Jay Aston]] was diagnosed with mouth cancer and would require surgery and extensive treatment. During this time it had also been discussed to bring forward plans for a Christmas album to this year. Production quickly began to allow the producers to record all of Aston's vocal parts for the release before she had to undergo surgery which would leave her unable to sing for the foreseeable future.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/bucks-fizz-star-jay-aston-12861448|title=Bucks Fizz star recording album ahead of cancer op which could stop her singing|first=Tom|last=Bryant|date=July 5, 2018|website=mirror|access-date=March 27, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200327133609/https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/bucks-fizz-star-jay-aston-12861448|archive-date=March 27, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/bucks-fizz-star-jay-aston-13161110|title=Bucks Fizz star Jay Aston shares devastating side-effect of mouth cancer surgery|first=Emily|last=Retter|date=August 29, 2018|website=mirror|access-date=March 27, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200327132008/https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/bucks-fizz-star-jay-aston-13161110|archive-date=March 27, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The tracks were then finished with Baker and Nolan providing all the backing vocals for 15 songs which would become ''[[Christmas with the Fizz]]''.<ref name=\"auto2\" />\n\nIn 2019, plans were made for the Fizz to return to the studio to finish recording the album now that Aston had recovered sufficiently to begin singing again.

Whilst ''The F\u2013Z of Pop'' contained three re-recordings of past Bucks Fizz hits as well as eight new compositions, it was agreed that moving forward the group would now focus solely on new material. The group went back into the studio in summer 2018 to begin recording for the new album. Fairly early on into the recording process [[Jay Aston]] was diagnosed with mouth cancer and would require surgery and extensive treatment. During this time it had also been discussed to bring forward plans for a Christmas album to this year. Production quickly began to allow the producers to record all of Aston's vocal parts for the release before she had to undergo surgery which would leave her unable to sing for the foreseeable future.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/bucks-fizz-star-jay-aston-12861448|title=Bucks Fizz star recording album ahead of cancer op which could stop her singing|first=Tom|last=Bryant|date=July 5, 2018|website=mirror|access-date=March 27, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200327133609/https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/bucks-fizz-star-jay-aston-12861448|archive-date=March 27, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/bucks-fizz-star-jay-aston-13161110|title=Bucks Fizz star Jay Aston shares devastating side-effect of mouth cancer surgery|first=Emily|last=Retter|date=August 29, 2018|website=mirror|access-date=March 27, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200327132008/https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/bucks-fizz-star-jay-aston-13161110|archive-date=March 27, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The tracks were then finished with Baker and Nolan providing all the backing vocals for 15 songs which would become ''[[Christmas with the Fizz]]''.<ref name=\"auto2\" />\n\nIn 2019, plans were made for the Fizz to return to the studio to finish recording the album now that Aston had recovered sufficiently to begin singing again. It also gave her the chance to complete her lead vocal on the track \"From Here to Eternity\", which she had recorded a guide vocal for on the day she received her cancer diagnosis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/bucks-fizz-star-jay-aston-21619167|title=Bucks Fizz broke down in tears singing song same day Jay diagnosed with cancer|date=March 2, 2020|website=mirror|access-date=March 27, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200303173526/https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/bucks-fizz-star-jay-aston-21619167|archive-date=March 3, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nRecording of ''Smoke & Mirrors'' was completed in September 2019, it was mastered at [[Metropolis Group|Metropolis]], London and scheduled for release in the new year to avoid the Christmas market.

The other [[Erromanga languages]] are either moribund or extinct. Although the island is quite large (887&nbsp;km\u00b2), the total number of speakers of Erromango is estimated at around 1900.\n\n==Linguistic situation==\n\nSye is close to being the only language on Erromango. There were once four\u2014Sye, [[Sorung language|Sorung]], [[Ura language (Vanuatu)|Ura]] and [[Utaha language|Utaha]]\u2014but the latter three are extinct apart from a handful of recently discovered Ura speakers. [[Terry Crowley (linguist)|Terry Crowley]] counted six speakers of Ura in the mid-1990s. The [[South Vanuatu languages|South Vanuatu language group]] includes these four languages.\n\nErromango Island was once much more diverse linguistically. In the nineteenth century a massive depopulation took place and the languages were realigned. [[Terry Crowley (linguist)|Terry Crowley]] states that there would have been three different languages prior to European contact.\n\n=== Work on the language ===\n\nThe earliest published account of Erromangan languages is [[George N. Gordon|Gordon]] (1889), whose notes, which he took on the island, were published posthumously. [[Arthur Capell|Capell]] produced a description of the language in the 1920s on the basis of the same materials that were used before by [[Ray (linguist)|Ray]], another scholar. This sketch was never published but it is referred to in detail, however, in unpublished correspondence dated 1927 from [[Dempwolff]] to Ray, so he obviously had copies passed on to others.\n\n[[John Lynch (linguist)|John Lynch]] gathered new material from speakers of Erromangan in the 1960s and 1970s. A description combining the resources of both his and Capell\u2019s work was felt to be feasible and a detailed grammatical sketch was published by Lynch and Capell. Capell\u2019s description bases on translated sources, while Lynch\u2019s notes base on the spoken language. They published in 1983 and made clear that their work had to be regarded as provisional and to be supplemented.\n\n==Dialects==\n\nThe Erromangan language today is dialectically fairly homogeneous. There is very little difference spoken on the coast of the island.\nWhile the pre-contact population of the island has been estimated at around 6.000 people\u00b3, this number dropped to 400 by 1931. Entire villages became unviable through loss of population and people were apparently constantly building and reconstituting new villages, larger than the old ones and on a different place on the island. This huge demographic change took place in recent historical times. Thus, it is not too surprising that there is relatively little dialectal diversity.\n\nErromangans will point out quickly the differences in the language of the people from Potnarvin and Dillon\u2019s Bay but for an outsider these are very small. There are just some differences in very low-frequency lexical items.\n\n==Phonology==\n\n=== Consonants ===\n\nJust /s/ and /r/ underlie [[allophonic]] variations.\n\n{| border=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|-\n|   || [[Labial consonant|Labial]] ||  [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]] || [[Velar]] || [[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n| [[Stop consonant|Stop]] || {{IPA|p}} || {{IPA|t}} || {{IPA|k}}  ||\n|-\n| [[Fricative]] || {{IPA|v}} || {{IPA|s}} || {{IPA|\u0263}} || {{IPA|h}}\n|-\n| [[Nasal stop|Nasal]] || {{IPA|m}} || {{IPA|n}} || {{IPA|\u014b}} ||\n|-\n| [[Lateral consonant|Lateral]] || || {{IPA|l}} || ||\n|-\n| [[Trill consonant|Trill]] || || {{IPA|r}} || ||\n|-\n| [[Semivowel|Glide]] || {{IPA|(w)}} || {{IPA|y}}|| {{IPA|(w)}} ||\n|}\n\n=== Vowels ===\n\nThe main difference between the [[Southern Vanuatu]] vowel systems lies in the status of the mid central vowel. This vowel is not present in [[Anejom]], while it is in the [[Tanna languages|Tanna]] languages. In Erromango, however, while there is evidence for an underlying contrastive schwa, it does not contrast at the surface level of representation.\n\n==Typological overview and examples==\n\n=== Morphology ===\n\nOther than languages from the North Central Vanuatu subgroup the languages of the Southern Vanuatu subgroup have a rather complex [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]].\nThe phonemes are simple but the [[phonotactics]] of Sye allow a wide range of consonant clusters. They stand mostly in the middle of words and can occur at initial and end position, too.\n\n::/''nentrap''/\t[nendraph]\t\u2018hibiscus\u2019\n::/''retpon''/\t[retpon]\t\u2018his wife\u2019\n::/''navwanr''/\t[navwand]\t\u2018bubble\u2019\n::/''itso\u03b7ku''/\t[it\u222bso\u03b7ku]\t\u2018whole\u2019\n\n=== Word classes ===\n\nSye is typological fairly typical for an [[Oceanic language]] with regard to word classes. Both number and type of class that are needed are normal as well as the extent of multifunctionality.  The productive use of [[prefixes]] and [[compounding]] is also typical. Less productive are [[suffixes]].\n\n=== Reduplication ===\n\n[[Reduplication]] is attested in Sye, but to a much smaller extent than it is in other [[Oceanic languages]] with regard to productivity.\n\n::''{{lang|erg|isut}}'' \u2018far away\u2019 > ''{{lang|erg|isutisut}}'' \u2018very far away\u2019\n::''{{lang|erg|metuv}}'' \u2018softly\u2019 > ''{{lang|erg|metuvmetuv}}'' \u2018very softly\u2019\n::''{{lang|erg|omol}}'' \u2018fall\u2019 > ''{{lang|erg|omolomol}}'' \u2018fall all over\u2019\n::''{{lang|erg|potvon}}'' \u2018short\u2019 > ''{{lang|erg|potvonpotvon}}'' \u2018very short\u2019\n\nThere is, however, a considerable amount of inflectional affixation in the nominal, prepositional and verbal morphology.\n\n=== Inflection ===\n\nInflectional morphology with Sye noun phrases is restricted to the marking of number and some types of possession. In the example shown below, the suffix /''-me''/ is used to indicate the plural form of \u2018who\u2019.\n\n::{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|  ''Kem-antehep'' || ''nandu'' ||  [''mei''] ||\n|-\n| 2SG:PRES-MR:sit ||  ACC.SG || who  ||\n|}\n::\u2018Who (singular) are you sitting with?\u2019\n::{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|  ''Kem-antehep'' || ''ndal'' ||  [''mei-me''] ||\n|-\n| 2SG:PRES-MR:sit ||  ACC.PL || who-PL  ||\n|}\n::\u2018Who (plural) are you sitting with?\u2019\n\n=== Affixation ===\n\nVerbs are obligatorily marked by prefixes that express a wide range of subject categories and a number of orders of optional prefixes, which appear between the prefixes and the [[Word stem|stem]].\nBecause this aspect is rather complex the example, which shows the [[prefixation]] of /tovop/ is preceded by a brief overview of the prefix order:\n\nSUBJECT (PRIOR PAST) (ITERATIVE) (NEGATIVE) (EM-) STEM.\n\n::{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|  ''koh'' || ''koku-tovop'' ||\n|-\n| 1NONSG.INCL||  1DL.INCL:RECPAST-BR:laugh ||\n|}\n::\u2018we (both) laughed\u2019\n::{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|  ''koh'' || ''koli-tovop'' ||\n|-\n| 1NONSG.INCL||  1PL.INCL:RECPAST-BR:laugh ||\n|}\n::\u2018we (all) laughed\u2019\n\n[[Alienable possession]] is marked on phrase level; inalienable possession would be indicated on nouns.\n\n=== Syntax ===\n\nSye is a classical [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object|SVO]] language in that it has postmodifying adjectives as well as prepositions within the noun phrase. The fairly large set of [[prepositions]] makes it unusual. The absence of the widespread patterns of serial verbs makes Sye different from other Oceanic languages.\n\n=== Echo-subject construction ===\n\nLacking serial verbs, Sye \u2013 along with the other languages of the Southern Vanuatu subgroup \u2013 has what we can refer to as an [[echo subject]] construction. A verb that has the same subject as the preceding verb is marked with a special reduced set of prefixes which replace the full set of subject prefixes.\nIn the first of the following three examples just the verb /''kamlitouri''/ receives full inflection. The following verbs /''mlitantvi''/ (\u2018and we crossed\u2019), /''mlisac''/ (\u2018and we went up\u2019) and /''mlitelwogi''/ (\u2018and we went past\u2019) all carry echo subject markers. The second and the third example follow the same structure, however, in the third example the concurrence of the two events of departing and arriving is hard to grasp for non Erromango speakers.\n\n:{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|''Kamli-tour-i''||''ovon''||''kuri''||''mli-tantvi''||''nu''||''mli-sac''||''mli-telwog-i''||''ovon''||''nenduc.''||\n|-\n|1PL.EXCL:DISTPAST-BR:lead-CONST||PL||dog||PL:ES-BR:cross||river||PL:ES-ascend||PL:ES-BR:go.past-CONST||PL||garden||\n|}\n:\u2018We led the dogs and crossed the river and went up past the gardens.\u2019\n:{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|''Misi Ravosen''||''yi-vai''||''m-hac''||''Unpogkor''||''mute (< mu-ete)''||''yuwi''||''nandu.''||\n|-\n|missionary Robertson||3SG:DISTPAST-BR:take||SG:ES-go.up||Unpogkor||PL:ES-BR:stay||there||together||\n|}\n:\u2018The missionary Robertson took him up to Unpogkor and they stayed there together.\u2019\n:{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|''Y-owi''||''nur''||''Vila''||''m-tolki''||''eni-wi.''||\n|-\n|3SG:DISTPAST-BR:leave||place||Vila||SG:ES-BR:return||POSS:3SG-TOP||\n|}\n:\u2018(S)he left Vila and (thereby) returned home.\u2019\n\n=== Number ===\n\nThe near categorical marking of [[number]] on nouns is another important feature of the nominal morphology of Sye. The following examples describe three of the noun premodifiers of Sye: hai \u2018indefinite\u2019, ovon \u2018plural\u2019 and ndve \u2018how much?, how many\u2019. Square brackets surround the noun phrase being illustrated.\n\n:{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|''Kandvi (\u27e8ko-and\u0259v-i)''||''[hai''||''nei].''||\n|-\n|2SG:FUT-MR:cut-CONST||INDEF||stick||\n|}\n:\u2018You will cut a stick.\u2019\n:{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|''Kole-nompi''||''[ovon syame''||''iyih].''||\n|-\n|1PL:INCL:FUT-MR:do||PL||things\tthis||\n|}\n:\u2018We will do those things.\u2019\n:{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|''Koc-vai''||''[ndve''||''nvat]?''||\n|-\n|2SG:RECPAST-BR:get||how.many||stone||\n|}\n:\u2018How many stones did you get?\u2019\n\nAccompanying adjectives are also marked for number.\n\n=== Subject markers ===\n\nSubjects are marked by verbal prefixes, while objects are indicated through verbal suffixes. Both are common in Oceanic languages. There is a huge number of distinct inflectional sets of subject markers on verbs expressing a variety of tense-aspect-mood categories. Not only is this an unusually large number of inflectional categories, but many of these categories are discontinuously marked by combinations of morphotactically separate prefixes for which the constituent forms do not always have definable meanings of their own.\n\n=== Verb morphology ===\n\nA complex scheme of root-initial mutation is a salient feature of the verb morphology of [[Erromangan languages]] in general. Different root forms are determined by the nature of the preceding morphological environment. This stands in typological contrast to the other [[Central Vanuatu languages]] which have root forms that are invariant. Sye shares this pattern with the languages of Central Vanuatu, though the patterns of these languages are different in some other respects.\n\n=== Possession ===\n\nA characteristic of Sye is its lack of separately marked [[possession (linguistics)|possessive]] constructions for a variety of alienable categories, such as food and drink [[Possession (linguistics)|possession]]. These forms are typical for Oceanic languages. But Sye has separate constructions which are typically associated with the expression of [[Alienability (grammar)|alienable]] and [[inalienable possession|inalienable]] possession.\n\n== Abbreviations used ==\n\n*ACC.PL:\tplural accompanitive\n*ACC.SG:\tsingular accompanitive\n*BR: \t        basic root\n*CONST:\t        construct suffix\n*DISTPAST:\tdistant past\n*DL:\t\t[[dual (grammatical number)|dual]]\n*ES:\t\t[[echo subject]]\n*EXCL:\t\texclusive\n*FUT:\t\tfuture\n*INCL:\t\tinclusive\n*INDEF:\t        indefinite\n*MR: \t\tmodified root\n*NONSG: \tnon-singular\n*PL:\t\tplural\n*PRES:\t\tpresent\n*RECPAST:\trecent past\n*SG:\t\tsingular\n*TOP:\t\t[[toponymic]]\n\n== Literature ==\n*Capell, A. and Lynch, J. 1983. \"Sie vocabulary\".

They stand mostly in the middle of words and can occur at initial and end position, too.\n\n::/''nentrap''/\t[nendraph]\t\u2018hibiscus\u2019\n::/''retpon''/\t[retpon]\t\u2018his wife\u2019\n::/''navwanr''/\t[navwand]\t\u2018bubble\u2019\n::/''itso\u03b7ku''/\t[it\u222bso\u03b7ku]\t\u2018whole\u2019\n\n=== Word classes ===\n\nSye is typological fairly typical for an [[Oceanic language]] with regard to word classes. Both number and type of class that are needed are normal as well as the extent of multifunctionality.  The productive use of [[prefixes]] and [[compounding]] is also typical. Less productive are [[suffixes]].\n\n=== Reduplication ===\n\n[[Reduplication]] is attested in Sye, but to a much smaller extent than it is in other [[Oceanic languages]] with regard to productivity.\n\n::''{{lang|erg|isut}}'' \u2018far away\u2019 > ''{{lang|erg|isutisut}}'' \u2018very far away\u2019\n::''{{lang|erg|metuv}}'' \u2018softly\u2019 > ''{{lang|erg|metuvmetuv}}'' \u2018very softly\u2019\n::''{{lang|erg|omol}}'' \u2018fall\u2019 > ''{{lang|erg|omolomol}}'' \u2018fall all over\u2019\n::''{{lang|erg|potvon}}'' \u2018short\u2019 > ''{{lang|erg|potvonpotvon}}'' \u2018very short\u2019\n\nThere is, however, a considerable amount of inflectional affixation in the nominal, prepositional and verbal morphology.\n\n=== Inflection ===\n\nInflectional morphology with Sye noun phrases is restricted to the marking of number and some types of possession. In the example shown below, the suffix /''-me''/ is used to indicate the plural form of \u2018who\u2019.\n\n::{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|  ''Kem-antehep'' || ''nandu'' ||  [''mei''] ||\n|-\n| 2SG:PRES-MR:sit ||  ACC.SG || who  ||\n|}\n::\u2018Who (singular) are you sitting with?\u2019\n::{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|  ''Kem-antehep'' || ''ndal'' ||  [''mei-me''] ||\n|-\n| 2SG:PRES-MR:sit ||  ACC.PL || who-PL  ||\n|}\n::\u2018Who (plural) are you sitting with?\u2019\n\n=== Affixation ===\n\nVerbs are obligatorily marked by prefixes that express a wide range of subject categories and a number of orders of optional prefixes, which appear between the prefixes and the [[Word stem|stem]].\nBecause this aspect is rather complex the example, which shows the [[prefixation]] of /tovop/ is preceded by a brief overview of the prefix order:\n\nSUBJECT (PRIOR PAST) (ITERATIVE) (NEGATIVE) (EM-) STEM.\n\n::{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|  ''koh'' || ''koku-tovop'' ||\n|-\n| 1NONSG.INCL||  1DL.INCL:RECPAST-BR:laugh ||\n|}\n::\u2018we (both) laughed\u2019\n::{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|  ''koh'' || ''koli-tovop'' ||\n|-\n| 1NONSG.INCL||  1PL.INCL:RECPAST-BR:laugh ||\n|}\n::\u2018we (all) laughed\u2019\n\n[[Alienable possession]] is marked on phrase level; inalienable possession would be indicated on nouns.\n\n=== Syntax ===\n\nSye is a classical [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object|SVO]] language in that it has postmodifying adjectives as well as prepositions within the noun phrase. The fairly large set of [[prepositions]] makes it unusual. The absence of the widespread patterns of serial verbs makes Sye different from other Oceanic languages.\n\n=== Echo-subject construction ===\n\nLacking serial verbs, Sye \u2013 along with the other languages of the Southern Vanuatu subgroup \u2013 has what we can refer to as an [[echo subject]] construction. A verb that has the same subject as the preceding verb is marked with a special reduced set of prefixes which replace the full set of subject prefixes.\nIn the first of the following three examples just the verb /''kamlitouri''/ receives full inflection. The following verbs /''mlitantvi''/ (\u2018and we crossed\u2019), /''mlisac''/ (\u2018and we went up\u2019) and /''mlitelwogi''/ (\u2018and we went past\u2019) all carry echo subject markers. The second and the third example follow the same structure, however, in the third example the concurrence of the two events of departing and arriving is hard to grasp for non Erromango speakers.\n\n:{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|''Kamli-tour-i''||''ovon''||''kuri''||''mli-tantvi''||''nu''||''mli-sac''||''mli-telwog-i''||''ovon''||''nenduc.''||\n|-\n|1PL.EXCL:DISTPAST-BR:lead-CONST||PL||dog||PL:ES-BR:cross||river||PL:ES-ascend||PL:ES-BR:go.past-CONST||PL||garden||\n|}\n:\u2018We led the dogs and crossed the river and went up past the gardens.\u2019\n:{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|''Misi Ravosen''||''yi-vai''||''m-hac''||''Unpogkor''||''mute (< mu-ete)''||''yuwi''||''nandu.''||\n|-\n|missionary Robertson||3SG:DISTPAST-BR:take||SG:ES-go.up||Unpogkor||PL:ES-BR:stay||there||together||\n|}\n:\u2018The missionary Robertson took him up to Unpogkor and they stayed there together.\u2019\n:{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|''Y-owi''||''nur''||''Vila''||''m-tolki''||''eni-wi.''||\n|-\n|3SG:DISTPAST-BR:leave||place||Vila||SG:ES-BR:return||POSS:3SG-TOP||\n|}\n:\u2018(S)he left Vila and (thereby) returned home.\u2019\n\n=== Number ===\n\nThe near categorical marking of [[number]] on nouns is another important feature of the nominal morphology of Sye. The following examples describe three of the noun premodifiers of Sye: hai \u2018indefinite\u2019, ovon \u2018plural\u2019 and ndve \u2018how much?, how many\u2019. Square brackets surround the noun phrase being illustrated.\n\n:{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|''Kandvi (\u27e8ko-and\u0259v-i)''||''[hai''||''nei].''||\n|-\n|2SG:FUT-MR:cut-CONST||INDEF||stick||\n|}\n:\u2018You will cut a stick.\u2019\n:{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|''Kole-nompi''||''[ovon syame''||''iyih].''||\n|-\n|1PL:INCL:FUT-MR:do||PL||things\tthis||\n|}\n:\u2018We will do those things.\u2019\n:{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|''Koc-vai''||''[ndve''||''nvat]?''||\n|-\n|2SG:RECPAST-BR:get||how.many||stone||\n|}\n:\u2018How many stones did you get?\u2019\n\nAccompanying adjectives are also marked for number.\n\n=== Subject markers ===\n\nSubjects are marked by verbal prefixes, while objects are indicated through verbal suffixes. Both are common in Oceanic languages. There is a huge number of distinct inflectional sets of subject markers on verbs expressing a variety of tense-aspect-mood categories. Not only is this an unusually large number of inflectional categories, but many of these categories are discontinuously marked by combinations of morphotactically separate prefixes for which the constituent forms do not always have definable meanings of their own.\n\n=== Verb morphology ===\n\nA complex scheme of root-initial mutation is a salient feature of the verb morphology of [[Erromangan languages]] in general. Different root forms are determined by the nature of the preceding morphological environment. This stands in typological contrast to the other [[Central Vanuatu languages]] which have root forms that are invariant. Sye shares this pattern with the languages of Central Vanuatu, though the patterns of these languages are different in some other respects.\n\n=== Possession ===\n\nA characteristic of Sye is its lack of separately marked [[possession (linguistics)|possessive]] constructions for a variety of alienable categories, such as food and drink [[Possession (linguistics)|possession]]. These forms are typical for Oceanic languages. But Sye has separate constructions which are typically associated with the expression of [[Alienability (grammar)|alienable]] and [[inalienable possession|inalienable]] possession.\n\n== Abbreviations used ==\n\n*ACC.PL:\tplural accompanitive\n*ACC.SG:\tsingular accompanitive\n*BR: \t        basic root\n*CONST:\t        construct suffix\n*DISTPAST:\tdistant past\n*DL:\t\t[[dual (grammatical number)|dual]]\n*ES:\t\t[[echo subject]]\n*EXCL:\t\texclusive\n*FUT:\t\tfuture\n*INCL:\t\tinclusive\n*INDEF:\t        indefinite\n*MR: \t\tmodified root\n*NONSG: \tnon-singular\n*PL:\t\tplural\n*PRES:\t\tpresent\n*RECPAST:\trecent past\n*SG:\t\tsingular\n*TOP:\t\t[[toponymic]]\n\n== Literature ==\n*Capell, A. and Lynch, J. 1983. \"Sie vocabulary\".
