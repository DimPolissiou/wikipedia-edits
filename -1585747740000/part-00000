In addition to the several biomes and living quarters for people, there was an agricultural area and work space to study the interactions between humans, farming, technology and the rest of nature as a new kind of laboratory for the study of the global ecology. Its mission was a two-year closure experiment with a crew of eight humans (\"biospherians\").<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.2307/1312123|jstor = 1312123|title = Using a Closed Ecological System to Study Earth's Biosphere|journal = Bioscience|volume = 43|issue = 4|pages = 225\u2013236|last1 = Nelson|first1 = Mark|last2 = Burgess|first2 = Tony L|last3 = Alling|first3 = Abigail|last4 = Alvarez-Romo|first4 = Norberto|last5 = Dempster|first5 = William F|last6 = Walford|first6 = Roy L|last7 = Allen|first7 = John P|year = 1993}}</ref> Long-term it was seen as a precursor to gain knowledge about the use of closed biospheres in [[space colonization]].

Below ground was an extensive part of the technical infrastructure. Heating and cooling water circulated through independent piping systems and [[passive solar]] input through the glass [[space frame]] panels covering most of the facility, and [[electrical power]] was supplied into Biosphere&nbsp;2 from an onsite natural gas energy center.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nBiosphere 2 was only used twice for its original intended purposes as a closed-system experiment: once from 1991 to 1993, and the second time from March to September 1994. Both attempts, though heavily publicized, ran into problems including low amounts of food and oxygen, die-offs of many animals and plants included in the experiment (though this was anticipated since the project used a strategy of deliberately \"species-packing\" anticipating losses as the biomes developed), group dynamic tensions among the resident crew, outside politics and a power struggle over management and direction of the project. Nevertheless, the closure experiments set world records in closed ecological systems, agricultural production, health improvements with the high nutrient and low caloric diet the crew followed, and insights into the self-organization of complex biomic systems and atmospheric dynamics.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pushing the Limits: Insights from Biosphere 2|last=Nelson|first=Mark|publisher=University of Arizona|year=2018|isbn=978-0-8165-3732-7|location=Tucson AZ|pages=}}</ref> The second closure experiment achieved total food sufficiency and did not require injection of oxygen.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/S0925-8574(98)00100-1|title = The agricultural biome of Biosphere 2|journal = Ecological Engineering|volume = 13|issue = 1\u20134|pages = 199\u2013234|year = 1999|last1 = Marino|first1 = Bruno D.V|last2 = Mahato|first2 = Tilak Ram|last3 = Druitt|first3 = John W|last4 = Leigh|first4 = Linda|last5 = Lin|first5 = Guanghui|last6 = Russell|first6 = Robert M|last7 = Tubiello|first7 = Francesco N}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1994, during the middle of the second experiment, the managing company, Space Biosphere Ventures, was dissolved, and the facility was left in limbo.

Although he later changed his opinion, acknowledging the unique scope of this experiment and contributed to its success as a consultant, in a 1983 interview (8 years before the start of the experiment), Prance said, \"I was attracted to the [[Institute of Ecotechnics]] because funds for research were being cut and the institute seemed to have a lot of money which it was willing to spend freely. Along with others, I was ill-used. Their interest in science is not genuine. They seem to have some sort of secret agenda, they seem to be guided by some sort of religious or philosophical system.\" Prance went on in the 1991 newspaper interview to say \"they are visionaries ... And maybe to fulfill their vision they have become somewhat cultlike. But they are not a cult, per se ... I am interested in ecological restoration systems. And I think all sorts of scientific things can come of this experiment, far beyond the space goal ... When they came to me with this new project, they seemed so well organized, so inspired, I simply decided to forget the past. You shouldn't hold their past against them.\" <ref>''Phoenix New Times'', June 19, 1991.</ref>\n\nPoynter in her memoir rebuts the critique that because some of the creative team of Biosphere 2 were not credentialed scientists, the results of the endeavor are invalid. \"Some reporters hurled accusations that we were unscientific. Apparently because many of the SBV managers were not themselves degreed scientists, this called into question the entire validity of the project, even though some of the world\u2019s best scientists were working vigorously on the project\u2019s design and operation. The critique was not fair. Since leaving Biosphere 2, I have run a small business for ten years that sent experiments on the shuttle and to the space station, and is designing life support systems for the replacement shuttle and future moon base. I do not have a degree, not even an MBA from Harvard, as John [Allen] had. I hire scientists and top engineers. Our company\u2019s credibility is not called into question because of my credentials: we are judged on the quality of our work\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Human Experiment: Two Years and Twenty Minutes Inside Biosphere 2|last=Poynter|first=Jane|publisher=op. cit.|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> H.T. Odum noted that mavericks and outsiders have often contributed to the development of science: \"The original management of Biosphere 2 was regarded by many scientists as untrained for lack of scientific degrees, even though they had engaged in a preparatory study program for a decade, interacting with the international community of scientists including the Russians involved with closed systems. The history of science has many examples where people of atypical background open science in new directions, in this case implementing mesocosm organization and ecological engineering with fresh hypotheses\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Odum|first=H.T.|date=|title=Scales of Ecological Engineering|url=|journal=Op.

The scale of Biosphere 2 is unique and Biosphere 2 is already providing unexpected scientific results not possible through other means (notably the documented, unexpected decline in atmospheric oxygen levels.) Biosphere 2 will make important scientific contributions in the fields of biogeochemical cycling, the ecology of closed ecological systems, and restoration ecology.\"  Columbia University assembled outside scientists to evaluate the potential of the facility after they took over management, and concluded the following: \"A group of world-class scientists got together and decided the Biosphere 2 facility is an exceptional laboratory for addressing critical questions relative to the future of Earth and its environment.\"<ref>Dr. Michael Crow, Vice-Provost of Columbia University, Press Release December 20, 1994.</ref>\n\n== Columbia University ==\nIn December 1995 the Biosphere 2 owners transferred management to [[Columbia University]] of New York City.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2D9133AF93AA25752C1A960958260\n|title= Paradise Lost: Biosphere Retooled as Atmospheric Nightmare\n|first=William J.\n|last=Broad\n|newspaper=The New York Times\n|date=1996-11-19}}</ref> Columbia ran Biosphere 2 as a research site and campus until 2003.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E7D6173BF93AA3575AC0A9659C8B63\n|title= Columbia University Ends Its Association With Biosphere 2\n|first=Karen W.\n|last=Arenson\n|newspaper=The New York Times\n|date=2003-09-09}}</ref> Subsequently, management reverted to the owners.\n\nIn 1996, Columbia University changed the virtually airtight, materially closed structure designed for closed system research, to a \"flow-through\" system, and halted closed system research.

Both attempts, though heavily publicized, ran into problems including low amounts of food and oxygen, die-offs of many animals and plants included in the experiment (though this was anticipated since the project used a strategy of deliberately \"species-packing\" anticipating losses as the biomes developed), group dynamic tensions among the resident crew, outside politics and a power struggle over management and direction of the project. Nevertheless, the closure experiments set world records in closed ecological systems, agricultural production, health improvements with the high nutrient and low caloric diet the crew followed, and insights into the self-organization of complex biomic systems and atmospheric dynamics.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pushing the Limits: Insights from Biosphere 2|last=Nelson|first=Mark|publisher=University of Arizona|year=2018|isbn=978-0-8165-3732-7|location=Tucson AZ|pages=}}</ref> The second closure experiment achieved total food sufficiency and did not require injection of oxygen.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/S0925-8574(98)00100-1|title = The agricultural biome of Biosphere 2|journal = Ecological Engineering|volume = 13|issue = 1\u20134|pages = 199\u2013234|year = 1999|last1 = Marino|first1 = Bruno D.V|last2 = Mahato|first2 = Tilak Ram|last3 = Druitt|first3 = John W|last4 = Leigh|first4 = Linda|last5 = Lin|first5 = Guanghui|last6 = Russell|first6 = Robert M|last7 = Tubiello|first7 = Francesco N}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1994, during the middle of the second experiment, the managing company, Space Biosphere Ventures, was dissolved, and the facility was left in limbo.

The recipe for this vinegar has almost as many variations as its legend.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Vinaigre_des_4_Voleurs.jpg|thumb|upright|A 17th-century bottle]]\nThis specific vinegar composition is said to have been used during the medieval period when the black death was happening, to prevent the catching of this dreaded disease.<ref name=\"gattefosse\">Rene-Maurice Gattefosse, Gattefosse\u2019s Aromatherapy (CW Daniel Company, Ltd.  First published in Paris, France in 1937 by Girardot & Cie.), 85-86.</ref> Other similar types of herbal vinegars have been used as medicine since the time of Hippocrates.\n\nEarly recipes for this vinegar called for a number of herbs to be added into a vinegar solution and left to steep for several days.  The following vinegar recipe hung in the Museum of Paris in 1937, and is said to have been an original copy of the recipe posted on the walls of Marseilles during an episode of the plague:\n\n{{quote|Take three pints of strong white wine vinegar, add a handful of each of wormwood, meadowsweet, wild marjoram and sage, fifty cloves, two ounces of campanula roots, two ounces of angelic, rosemary and horehound and three large measures of champhor.  Place the mixture in a container for fifteen days, strain and express then bottle.  Use by rubbing it on the hands, ears and temples from time to time when approaching a plague victim.<ref name=\"gattefosse\" />}}\n\nPlausible reasons for not contracting the plague was that the herbal concoction contained natural flea repellents, since the flea is the carrier for the plague bacillus, ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''.  [[Artemisia vulgaris|Wormwood]] has properties similar to cedar as an insect repellent, as do aromatics such as sage, cloves, camphor, rosemary, and campanula.  [[Filipendula ulmaria|Meadowsweet]], although known to contain [[salicylic acid]], is mainly used to mask odors like decomposing bodies.\n\nAnother recipe called for dried rosemary, dried sage flowers, dried lavender flowers<ref>{{Cite book|title=The practical guide to using herbs : knowing, growing, cooking|last=Houdret, Jessica.|date=2006|publisher=Lorenz|isbn=978-0-7548-1647-8|oclc=84543649}}</ref>, fresh rue, camphor dissolved in spirit, sliced garlic, bruised cloves, and distilled wine vinegar.<ref>Hopkins, The Scientific American Encyclopedia of Formulas, 1910, 878.</ref>\n\nModern-day versions include various herbs that typically include [[Salvia officinalis|sage]], [[lavender]], [[thyme]], and [[rosemary]], along with [[garlic]]. Additional herbs sometimes include [[rue]], [[Mentha|mint]], and [[Artemisia (genus)|wormwood]]. It has become traditional to use four herbs in the recipe\u2014one for each thief, though earlier recipes often have a dozen herbs or more. It is still sold in [[Provence]]. In Italy a mixture called \"seven thieves vinegar\" is sold as a [[smelling salt]], though its ingredients appear to be the same as in four thieves mixtures.<ref>http://www.cooker.net/doc/3A7B645D81D2CFB5C12572EE004D745A</ref>\n\n==Mythology==\nThe usual story declares that a group of thieves during a European plague outbreak were robbing the dead or the sick. When they were caught, they offered to exchange their secret recipe, which had allowed them to commit the robberies without catching the disease, in exchange for leniency. Another version says that the thieves had already been caught before the outbreak and their sentence had been to bury dead plague victims; to survive this punishment, they created the vinegar. The city in which this happened is usually said to be [[Marseille]] or [[Toulouse]], and the time period can be given as anywhere between the 14th and 18th century depending on the storyteller.<ref name=\"legend\">[https://plaguesage.com Legend of Four Thieves Vinegar]</ref>\n\nAn alternative theory says that \"four thieves vinegar\" could be a corruption of \"Forthave's vinegar\", a concoction sold and invented by one Dick Forthave.

The recipe for this vinegar has almost as many variations as its legend.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Vinaigre_des_4_Voleurs.jpg|thumb|upright|A 17th-century bottle]]\nThis specific vinegar composition is said to have been used during the medieval period when the black death was happening, to prevent the catching of this dreaded disease.<ref name=\"gattefosse\">Rene-Maurice Gattefosse, Gattefosse\u2019s Aromatherapy (CW Daniel Company, Ltd.  First published in Paris, France in 1937 by Girardot & Cie.), 85-86.</ref> Other similar types of herbal vinegars have been used as medicine since the time of Hippocrates.\n\nEarly recipes for this vinegar called for a number of herbs to be added into a vinegar solution and left to steep for several days.  The following vinegar recipe hung in the Museum of Paris in 1937, and is said to have been an original copy of the recipe posted on the walls of Marseilles during an episode of the plague:\n\n{{quote|Take three pints of strong white wine vinegar, add a handful of each of wormwood, meadowsweet, wild marjoram and sage, fifty cloves, two ounces of campanula roots, two ounces of angelic, rosemary and horehound and three large measures of champhor.  Place the mixture in a container for fifteen days, strain and express then bottle.  Use by rubbing it on the hands, ears and temples from time to time when approaching a plague victim.<ref name=\"gattefosse\" />}}\n\nPlausible reasons for not contracting the plague was that the herbal concoction contained natural flea repellents, since the flea is the carrier for the plague bacillus, ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''.  [[Artemisia vulgaris|Wormwood]] has properties similar to cedar as an insect repellent, as do aromatics such as sage, cloves, camphor, rosemary, and campanula.  [[Filipendula ulmaria|Meadowsweet]], although known to contain [[salicylic acid]], is mainly used to mask odors like decomposing bodies.\n\nAnother recipe called for dried rosemary, dried sage flowers, dried lavender flowers<ref>{{Cite book|title=The practical guide to using herbs : knowing, growing, cooking|last=Houdret, Jessica.|date=2006|publisher=Lorenz|isbn=978-0-7548-1647-8|oclc=84543649}}</ref>, fresh rue, camphor dissolved in spirit, sliced garlic, bruised cloves, and distilled wine vinegar.<ref>Hopkins, The Scientific American Encyclopedia of Formulas, 1910, 878.</ref>\n\nModern-day versions include various herbs that typically include [[Salvia officinalis|sage]], [[lavender]], [[thyme]], and [[rosemary]], along with [[garlic]]. Additional herbs sometimes include [[rue]], [[Mentha|mint]], and [[Artemisia (genus)|wormwood]]. It has become traditional to use four herbs in the recipe\u2014one for each thief, though earlier recipes often have a dozen herbs or more. It is still sold in [[Provence]]. In Italy a mixture called \"seven thieves vinegar\" is sold as a [[smelling salt]], though its ingredients appear to be the same as in four thieves mixtures.<ref>http://www.cooker.net/doc/3A7B645D81D2CFB5C12572EE004D745A</ref>\n\n==Mythology==\nThe usual story declares that a group of thieves during a European plague outbreak were robbing the dead or the sick. When they were caught, they offered to exchange their secret recipe, which had allowed them to commit the robberies without catching the disease, in exchange for leniency. Another version says that the thieves had already been caught before the outbreak and their sentence had been to bury dead plague victims; to survive this punishment, they created the vinegar. The city in which this happened is usually said to be [[Marseille]] or [[Toulouse]], and the time period can be given as anywhere between the 14th and 18th century depending on the storyteller.<ref name=\"legend\">[https://plaguesage.com Legend of Four Thieves Vinegar]</ref>\n\nAn alternative theory says that \"four thieves vinegar\" could be a corruption of \"Forthave's vinegar\", a concoction sold and invented by one Richard Forthave.

There have been a couple of dangerous moments where McCurry came close to losing his life. He was almost drowned in India and he survived an airplane crash in Yugoslavia. McCurry has had his work featured in magazines worldwide and he is a frequent contributor to National Geographic.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nMcCurry concentrates on the toll war takes on humans. He intends to show what war does to not only the landscape, but to the people who inhabit that land. \"Most of my images are grounded in people. I look for the unguarded moment, the essential soul peeking out, experience etched on a person\u2019s face. I try to convey what it is like to be that person, a person caught in a broader landscape, that you could call the human condition.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> What McCurry wants his viewers to take away from his photographs is the \"human connection between all of us.\" He believes there is always some common thing between all humans despite the differences in religion, language, ethnicity, etc.<ref name=\":1\" /> McCurry also states, \"I have found that I get completely consumed by the importance of the story I am telling, the feeling that the world has got to know. It's never about the adrenaline. It's about the story.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> However, sometimes McCurry has witnessed some \"horrific\" and \"distressing\" sights. In times like these, he uses his camera as a \"shield\" because it's easier to witness these events through a viewfinder.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nOn September 10, 2001, McCurry had just gotten back from Tibet. The morning of September 11, McCurry received a call saying the World Trade Center was on fire. He went up to the roof of his building and started taking photographs, he didn't know it was a plane that hit the towers. McCurry was on the roof when both of the towers fell, \"they were just gone.

He describes the scene, \"there was this very fine white powder everywhere and all this office paper, but there was no recognizable office equipment\u2014no filing cabinets, telephones, computers. It seemed like the whole thing had been pulverized.\" McCurry left later that night and went back early on September 12, he didn't have any press credentials and had to sneak past security.

He said that he had no nostalgia about working in film in an interview with ''[[The Guardian]].'' \"Perhaps old habits are hard to break, but my experience is that the majority of my colleagues, regardless of age, have switched over...

Eastman Kodak gifted him the last roll of [[Kodachrome]] film to ever be produced by [[Kodak]]. McCurry shot the roll, which was processed in July 2010 by Dwayne's Photo in Parsons, Kansas. Most of these photos were published on the Internet by Vanity Fair. McCurry states, \"I shot it for 30 years and I have several hundred thousand pictures on Kodachrome in my archive.

He originally planned to study cinematography and filmmaking, but instead gained a degree in theater arts and graduated in 1974.

There have been a couple of dangerous moments where McCurry came close to losing his life. He was almost drowned in India and he survived an airplane crash in Yugoslavia. McCurry has had his work featured in magazines worldwide and he is a frequent contributor to National Geographic.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nMcCurry concentrates on the toll war takes on humans. He intends to show what war does to not only the landscape, but to the people who inhabit that land. \"Most of my images are grounded in people. I look for the unguarded moment, the essential soul peeking out, experience etched on a person\u2019s face. I try to convey what it is like to be that person, a person caught in a broader landscape, that you could call the human condition.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> What McCurry wants his viewers to take away from his photographs is the \"human connection between all of us.\" He believes there is always some common thing between all humans despite the differences in religion, language, ethnicity, etc.<ref name=\":1\" /> McCurry also states, \"I have found that I get completely consumed by the importance of the story I am telling, the feeling that the world has got to know. It's never about the adrenaline. It's about the story.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> However, sometimes McCurry has witnessed some \"horrific\" and \"distressing\" sights. In times like these, he uses his camera as a \"shield\" because it's easier to witness these events through a viewfinder.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nOn September 10, 2001, McCurry had just gotten back from Tibet. The morning of September 11, McCurry received a call saying the World Trade Center was on fire. He went up to the roof of his building and started taking photographs, he didn't know it was a plane that hit the towers. McCurry was on the roof when both of the towers fell, \"they were just gone. It didn\u2019t seem possible. Like you\u2019re seeing something but you don\u2019t really believe what you\u2019re seeing.\"<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanphotomag.com/steve-mccurry-ground-zero-photographs#page-2|title=Steve McCurry: The Ground Zero Photographs|work=American Photo|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en}}</ref> After the fall of the towers, McCurry ran to Ground Zero with his assistant. He describes the scene, \"there was this very fine white powder everywhere and all this office paper, but there was no recognizable office equipment\u2014no filing cabinets, telephones, computers. It seemed like the whole thing had been pulverized.\" McCurry left later that night and went back early on September 12, he didn't have any press credentials and had to sneak past security. He was eventually caught and escorted off Ground Zero, he wouldn't go back again.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nMcCurry is portrayed in a TV documentary ''The Face of the Human Condition'' (2003) by [[Denis Delestrac]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.all-about-photo.com/photographers/photographer.php?id=81&name=steve-mccurry|title=Steve McCurry Photographer - All About Photo|last=all-about-photo.com|website=www.all-about-photo.com|access-date=2018-03-22}}</ref>\n\nMcCurry switched from shooting color slide film to digital capture in 2005 for the convenience of editing in the field and transmitting images to photo editors. He said that he had no nostalgia about working in film in an interview with ''[[The Guardian]].'' \"Perhaps old habits are hard to break, but my experience is that the majority of my colleagues, regardless of age, have switched over... The quality has never been better.

Eastman Kodak gifted him the last roll of [[Kodachrome]] film to ever be produced by [[Kodak]]. McCurry shot the roll, which was processed in July 2010 by Dwayne's Photo in Parsons, Kansas. Most of these photos were published on the Internet by Vanity Fair. McCurry states, \"I shot it for 30 years and I have several hundred thousand pictures on Kodachrome in my archive. I'm trying to shoot 36 pictures that act as some kind of wrap up \u2013 to mark the passing of Kodachrome. It was a wonderful film.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.laurarathe.com/artists/steve-mccurry/featured-works?view=thumbnails|title=Steve McCurry - Artists - LAURA RATHE FINE ART|website=www.laurarathe.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, he was hired by [[Microsoft]] to take photographs in areas of [[New Zealand]], which were used as wallpapers in [[Windows 10]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://maryleejohnson.com/Windows-10-Wallpaper-Photography-Steve-McCurry|title=Windows 10 Wallpaper Photography - Steve McCurry|last=Johnson|first=Marylee|website=maryleejohnson.com|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, his book ''Steve McCurry.

His father, intending that he should enter the church, sent him to [[Eton College]] in 1737 and then to [[St John's College, Cambridge]] in 1748.<ref>{{acad|id=SMT747W2|name=Smith, William}}</ref> The vivacious spirit for which he was well known at Eton led him into problems at Cambridge. One evening he drank too freely with some friends and, being pursued by a proctor, he unwisely snapped an unloaded pistol at him. He refused the punishment that was imposed, and quit the University to avoid expulsion.<ref>'\"Gentleman Smith\", the original Charles Surface', in [[William Hone]] (ed.), ''The Every-Day Book: or, The Guide to the Year'' (London 1825), II, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8CEIAAAAQAAJ&pg=RA1-PA260#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 1287\u20131291] (Google).</ref>\n\n===Covent Garden 1753\u20131774===\nSmith was inclined towards the stage: upon arrival in London, he applied to [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] at the original [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] Theatre, where he first appeared in January 1753 in the role of Theodosius (in [[Nathaniel Lee]]'s tragedy of ''The Force of Love''<ref>'Obituary notice of William Smith', ''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>), a performance attended by many of his college friends in a spirit of solidarity. He next appeared as Polydore in [[Thomas Otway]]'s ''[[The Orphan (play)|The Orphan]]'', Southampton in ''The Earl of Essex'', and Dolabella in [[John Dryden]]'s ''[[All For Love (play)|All for Love]]''. Having taken various subordinate roles in casts led by Mrs. Cibber and [[Spranger Barry]] (whose pupil he had effectively become<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>), on Barry's retirement he took on many of that actor's principal parts. If he had defects, they were generally overlooked by his audiences, who admired his upright and independent private life. The poet [[Charles Churchill (satirist)|Charles Churchill]], in his \"Rosciad\" satire of 1761, said of him: \"Smith the genteel, the airy, and the smart; Smith was just gone to school to say his part.\"<ref>C. Churchill, ''The Rosciad'' Fifth edition (Author, London 1771), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eQ4UAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA20#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 20] (Google).</ref> Smith was at Covent Garden for 22 years.\n\n===Drury Lane 1774\u20131788===\nAt the end of season in 1774 he and the actress [[Elizabeth Hartley (actress)|Elizabeth Hartley]], who played his on-stage lover in ''Henry II or The Fall of Rosamond'', caused a scandal when they absconded to France.

Langhans|pages=156\u2013164}}</ref> Garrick having engaged him for [[Drury Lane]], he remained there until retirement in 1788. Though for a long time he played lead roles in tragedy, for which he had a suitably tall and well-proportioned figure, his facial features lacked the flexibility and expressiveness, and his vocal delivery was somewhat too harsh and monotonous, to be considered ideal.<ref>J. Boaden, ''The Life of Mrs. Jordan: Including Original Private Correspondence'', 2 vols (Edward Bull, London 1831), I, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2H4XAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA120#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 120-23] (Google).</ref> However, he won popularity as [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]], [[Henry IV, Part 1|Hotspur]], and Hastings, and was also admired in the roles of Kitely (''[[Every Man in his Humour]]'', in which he was preferred to Garrick<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>), Archer, and Oakly. It was said that he prided himself on the reflection that he was never called upon to perform in an [[after-piece]], or to pass through a trapdoor in any entrance or exit on the stage.<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', as above.</ref>\n\n===Charles Surface===\nSmith's masterpiece was his impersonation of Charles Surface in [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]'s ''[[The School for Scandal]]'',<ref>C. Deelman, 'The original cast of The School for Scandal', ''The Review of English Studies'' 1962 XIII (51), pp.&nbsp;257\u2013266.</ref> which won the highest praise for originality, boldness of conception, truth, freedom, ease, and gracefulness of action and manner.<ref>W. Hone, ''The Every-Day Book'' (London 1825), II, pp. 1287\u20131291.</ref> He is mentioned favourably in [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]]'s ''[[Essays of Elia]]'':<blockquote>\"...it was then the fashion to cry down John Kemble, who took the part after Smith; but, I thought, very unjustly. Smith, I fancy, was more airy, and took the eye with a certain gaiety of person. He brought with him no sombre recollections of tragedy. He had not to expiate the fault of having pleased beforehand in lofty declamation. He had no sins of Hamlet or of Richard to atone for. His failure in these parts was a passport to success in one of so opposite a tendency.\"<ref>C. Lamb, 'On the artificial comedy of the last century', in ''Essays of Elia'' ed. A. Ainger (Macmillan and Co. Ltd., London 1910), pp. 192-201, [https://archive.org/details/essaysofelia00lambrich/page/200/mode/2up at p. 200] (Internet Archive).</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn 9 March 1788, after a performance of [[Hamlet]], Smith announced his intention to retire and \"resign the sprightly Charles to abler hands and younger heads\". After a performance of the role on 9 June 1788, he gave his farewell speech, though he did appear once more in 1798 in a benefit performance for his friend [[Thomas King (actor)|Thomas King]], when, 'having grown very lusty, he went through the character with that spirit, ease, and elegance, for which he was unequalled.'<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>\n\n==Personal life and retirement==\nIn his early days, Smith was often distracted from his professional work by his love of fox-hunting.<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', as above.</ref> He first married the sister of [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich]], Mrs Kelland Courtnay (a widow), who died in 1762. His elopement to Ireland with Elizabeth Hartley followed. In later life he was remarried, to Miss Newson of [[Leiston]] in Suffolk. (Through the second marriage in the Newson family is traced a relationship to [[Hamlet Watling]], whose brother Edwin also married a daughter of Smith's<ref>Hamlet Watling, 'Suffolk Heraldry & Genealogy in 12 Vols' (MS, [[Ipswich Museum]], Christchurch Mansion) Vol 8.</ref>). Smith died at [[Bury St Edmunds]] on 13 September 1819 in his 89th year.

His father, intending that he should enter the church, sent him to [[Eton College]] in 1737 and then to [[St John's College, Cambridge]] in 1748.<ref>{{acad|id=SMT747W2|name=Smith, William}}</ref> The vivacious spirit for which he was well known at Eton led him into problems at Cambridge. One evening he drank too freely with some friends and, being pursued by a proctor, he unwisely snapped an unloaded pistol at him. He refused the punishment that was imposed, and quit the University to avoid expulsion.<ref>'\"Gentleman Smith\", the original Charles Surface', in [[William Hone]] (ed.), ''The Every-Day Book: or, The Guide to the Year'' (London 1825), II, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8CEIAAAAQAAJ&pg=RA1-PA260#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 1287\u20131291] (Google).</ref>\n\n===Covent Garden 1753\u20131774===\nSmith was inclined towards the stage: upon arrival in London, he applied to [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] at the original [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] Theatre, where he first appeared in January 1753 in the role of Theodosius (in [[Nathaniel Lee]]'s tragedy of ''The Force of Love''<ref>'Obituary notice of William Smith', ''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>), a performance attended by many of his college friends in a spirit of solidarity. He next appeared as Polydore in [[Thomas Otway]]'s ''[[The Orphan (play)|The Orphan]]'', Southampton in ''The Earl of Essex'', and Dolabella in [[John Dryden]]'s ''[[All For Love (play)|All for Love]]''. Having taken various subordinate roles in casts led by Mrs. Cibber and [[Spranger Barry]] (whose pupil he had effectively become<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>), on Barry's retirement he took on many of that actor's principal parts. If he had defects, they were generally overlooked by his audiences, who admired his upright and independent private life. The poet [[Charles Churchill (satirist)|Charles Churchill]], in his \"Rosciad\" satire of 1761, said of him: \"Smith the genteel, the airy, and the smart; Smith was just gone to school to say his part.\"<ref>C. Churchill, ''The Rosciad'' Fifth edition (Author, London 1771), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eQ4UAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA20#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 20] (Google).</ref> Smith was at Covent Garden for 22 years.\n\n===Drury Lane 1774\u20131788===\nAt the end of season in 1774 he and the actress [[Elizabeth Hartley (actress)|Elizabeth Hartley]], who played his on-stage lover in ''Henry II or The Fall of Rosamond'', caused a scandal when they absconded to France. They travelled on to [[Cork (city)|Cork, Ireland]] where they acted together. They both returned to London for the autumn season, Hartley to continue at Covent Garden and Smith to Drury Lane.<ref>{{cite book|title=Habgood to Houbert: Volume 7 of A Biographical Dictionary of Actors, Actresses, Musicians, Dancers, Managers and Other Stage Personnel in London, 1660-1800|year=1982|publisher=SIU Press|isbn=9780809309184|author=Edward A. Langhans|pages=156\u2013164}}</ref> Garrick having engaged him for [[Drury Lane]], he remained there until retirement in 1788. Though for a long time he played lead roles in tragedy, for which he had a suitably tall and well-proportioned figure, his facial features lacked the flexibility and expressiveness, and his vocal delivery was somewhat too harsh and monotonous, to be considered ideal.<ref>J. Boaden, ''The Life of Mrs. Jordan: Including Original Private Correspondence'', 2 vols (Edward Bull, London 1831), I, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2H4XAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA120#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 120-23] (Google).</ref> However, he won popularity as [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]], [[Henry IV, Part 1|Hotspur]], and Hastings, and was also admired in the roles of Kitely (''[[Every Man in his Humour]]'', in which he was preferred to Garrick<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>), Archer, and Oakly. It was said that he prided himself on the reflection that he was never called upon to perform in an [[after-piece]], or to pass through a trapdoor in any entrance or exit on the stage.<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', as above.</ref>\n\n===Charles Surface===\nSmith's masterpiece was his impersonation of Charles Surface in [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]'s ''[[The School for Scandal]]'',<ref>C. Deelman, 'The original cast of The School for Scandal', ''The Review of English Studies'' 1962 XIII (51), pp.&nbsp;257\u2013266.</ref> which won the highest praise for originality, boldness of conception, truth, freedom, ease, and gracefulness of action and manner.<ref>W. Hone, ''The Every-Day Book'' (London 1825), II, pp. 1287\u20131291.</ref> He is mentioned favourably in [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]]'s ''[[Essays of Elia]]'':<blockquote>\"...it was then the fashion to cry down John Kemble, who took the part after Smith; but, I thought, very unjustly. Smith, I fancy, was more airy, and took the eye with a certain gaiety of person. He brought with him no sombre recollections of tragedy. He had not to expiate the fault of having pleased beforehand in lofty declamation. He had no sins of Hamlet or of Richard to atone for. His failure in these parts was a passport to success in one of so opposite a tendency.\"<ref>C. Lamb, 'On the artificial comedy of the last century', in ''Essays of Elia'' ed. A. Ainger (Macmillan and Co. Ltd., London 1910), pp. 192-201, [https://archive.org/details/essaysofelia00lambrich/page/200/mode/2up at p. 200] (Internet Archive).</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn 9 March 1788, after a performance of [[Hamlet]], Smith announced his intention to retire and \"resign the sprightly Charles to abler hands and younger heads\". After a performance of the role on 9 June 1788, he gave his farewell speech, though he did appear once more in 1798 in a benefit performance for his friend [[Thomas King (actor)|Thomas King]], when, 'having grown very lusty, he went through the character with that spirit, ease, and elegance, for which he was unequalled.'<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>\n\n==Personal life and retirement==\nIn his early days, Smith was often distracted from his professional work by his love of fox-hunting.<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', as above.</ref> He first married the sister of [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich]], Mrs Kelland Courtnay (a widow), who died in 1762. His elopement to Ireland with Elizabeth Hartley followed. In later life he was remarried, to Miss Newson of [[Leiston]] in Suffolk. (Through the second marriage in the Newson family is traced a relationship to [[Hamlet Watling]], whose brother Edwin also married a daughter of Smith's<ref>Hamlet Watling, 'Suffolk Heraldry & Genealogy in 12 Vols' (MS, [[Ipswich Museum]], Christchurch Mansion) Vol 8.</ref>). Smith died at [[Bury St Edmunds]] on 13 September 1819 in his 89th year. There his elegant figure was remembered as always wearing a white hat edged with green, a blue coat, figured waistcoat, fustian coloured breeches, and gaiters to match, and carrying a gold-headed cane.
