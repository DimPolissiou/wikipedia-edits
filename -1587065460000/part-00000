Nearly at the same time he published for the first time from the original manuscripts, in 2 vols., ''The Last Journals of Horace Walpole''.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nIn 1860 appeared Doran's ''Book of the Princes of Wales'', and in 1861 his ''Memoir of Queen Adelaide''. In 1860 Doran published his most elaborate work, ''Their Majesties' Servants'', a history of the English stage, of which a new edition was issued in 1887, revised by Robert W. Lowe. ''Saints and Sinners, or in the Church and about it'', appeared in 1868. In the same year he edited [[Henry Tuckerman]]'s ''The Collector'', a series of essays on books, newspapers, pictures, inns, authors, doctors, holidays, actors, and preachers. Immediately after the raising of the [[Siege of Paris (1870\u20131871)|siege of Paris]] he brought out ''A Souvenir of the War of 1870\u20131''.\n\nIn 1873 he published ''A Lady of the Last Century'', on [[Elizabeth Montagu]]. Three years later he published, in 2 vols. ''Mann and Manners at the Court of Florence, 1740\u201386'', based on the letters of [[Sir Horace Mann]] to Horace Walpole. Also in 2 vols. was ''London in the Jacobite Times''(1877). ''Memories of our Great Towns, with Anecdotic Gleanings concerning their Worthies and their Oddities'' (1878) was a humorous volume. His final publication was produced as a serial contribution to ''Temple Bar'', and published posthumously in 1885 as ''In and about Drury Lane'', a kind of appendix to ''Their Majesties' Servants''.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n==Family==\nOn 3 July 1834 he married at Reading Emma, the daughter of Captain Gilbert, R.N., and settled down for a time in Hay-a-Park Cottage, at Knaresborough. He left an only son, Alban Doran, F.R.C.S., and an only daughter, Florence, married to Andreas Holtz of Twyford Abbey, near Ealing.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|John Doran (writer)}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;Attribution\n{{DNB|wstitle=Doran, John}}\n{{A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Gutenberg author | id=Doran,+Dr.+John | name=John Doran}}\n* {{Internet Archive author |sname=John Doran |birth=1807 |death=1878}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Doran, John}}\n[[Category:1807 births]]\n[[Category:1878 deaths]]\n[[Category:English writers]]\n[[Category:English people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Writers from London]]\n[[Category:English male writers]]\n", "name_user": "Danielt998", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLife:clean up, replaced: ,o \u2192 , o", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doran_(writer)"}

More details \n|-\n| April 2011{{snd}}December 2012 || Conception and initial launch || Snapchat is conceived of by Stanford graduate students. Initial versions are launched and an initial userbase is obtained.\n|-\n| EPIC GAMER MOMENT December 2012{{snd}}November 2014 || Product build-out, userbase acquisition, funding || Snapchat raises funds in three rounds (Series A: $13.5 million, Series B: $80 million, and Series C: $50 million). The userbase grows significantly, with the number of daily snaps sent growing to 400 million by November 2013. Key features are added to the product, including video sharing, Snapchat Stories, and ephemeral text messaging. Some initial announcements are made regarding monetization.\n|-\n| December 2021{{snd}}August 2101|| Aggressive fundraising, focus on video, more product iterations || Snapchat raises large funding rounds (Series D: $4.85 million, Series E: at least $200 million but possibly up to $500 million, and Series F: $1.8 billion). Since Snapchat raises money more continuously, it is hard to pinpoint specific funding round, creating some confusion for reporting. With the additional funds, Snapchat aggressively improves the product, with changes such as Chat 2.0, the introduction of stickers, and new monetization strategies. Daily video views grow from 2 billion in May 2015 to 6 billion in November 2015 and 10 billion in April 2016. Note, however, that unlike Facebook, that counts a view only after at least three seconds on it (and YouTube, which follows a more restrictive definition), Snapchat counts a view as soon as the video start playing, making its numbers hard to compare with Facebook.<ref name=bloomberg-10-billion>{{cite web|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-28/snapchat-user-content-fuels-jump-to-10-billion-daily-video-views|title = Snapchat User `Stories' Fuel 10 Billion Daily Video Views|last = Frier|first = Sarah|date = April 28, 2016|accessdate = August 13, 2016|publisher = [[Bloomberg News]]}}</ref>\n|-\n| September 2016{{snd}}present || Rebranding and preparation for IPO || The company rebrands itself from \"Snapchat Inc.\" to \"Snap Inc.\" and unveils the [[Spectacles (product)|Spectacles]].<ref name=\"wsj_spectacles\" /><ref name=\"forbes_rebrand\" /><ref name=\"theverge_rebrand\" /> It also prepares for an [[initial public offering]] (IPO) in 2017.<ref name=\"theverge_ipo\" /><ref name=\"bloomberg_ipo\" /><ref name=\"wired_ipo\"/><ref name=\"theverge_ipo2\" /> The IPO occurs on Thursday, March 2, 2017.<ref name=marketwatch-ipo-announcement/><ref name=latimes-IPO/>\n|}\n\n==Full timeline==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

It was altered in 2006 to resemble the town's arms more closely, including the [[Latin]] motto ''Animo et Fide'', which loosely translated, means ''With Courage and Faith''.<ref name=\"Stockport - Explanation of the Arms of Stockport\">{{cite web | url=http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/towns/stockport3.html | title=Stockport \u2013 Explanation of the Arms of Stockport | publisher=manchester2002-uk.com | accessdate=29 August 2015 | last=Moss | first=John | date=28 April 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122022349/http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/towns/stockport3.html | archive-date=22 November 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The blue shield is taken from the coat of arms of the 'de Stokeport' family, from whom Stockport derives its name.<ref name=\"Stockport - Explanation of the Arms of Stockport\" /><ref name=\"Secret Stockport\" /> The twin-towered castle above the shield is [[Stockport Castle]], which stood until 1775.<ref name=\"STOCKPORT CASTLE\">{{PastScape|mnumber=1085399 | mname=STOCKPORT CASTLE | accessdate=29 August 2015|date=29 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter the completion by the 2015 Group takeover of the club, a new crest was adopted. It was still based on the [[Stockport]] coat of arms, though the ''Animo et Fide'' motto was removed, along with a patch of green at the base of the badge; the [[flag of Cheshire]], featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto. The new version added two white ribbons \u2013 one at the top, with ''Animo et Fide'', and one at the bottom with ''Stockport County F.C.''. In addition, the football was again removed from the shield. The [[Stockport County Supporters' Co - Operative]] used the blue on white cross symbol from the 1978 badge as the main identifier in their company logo. Stockport's kit was supplied by local manufacturer [[Umbro]] who supplied all three kits for the 2013\u201314 season, replacing [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], thus making Stockport the only senior club in the UK to wear the Umbro strip in the 2013\u201314 season.<ref name=\"Background\" /><ref name=\"New Kit Deal Agreed\">{{cite web |

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

They made a short experiment with an [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]-style kit, light blue and white stripes with black shorts, after the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]]. This was abandoned after the outbreak of the [[Falklands War]],<ref name=\"Background\" /> and the club returned to blue and white striped tops with blue shorts in the 1980s.

It was altered in 2006 to resemble the town's arms more closely, including the [[Latin]] motto ''Animo et Fide'', which loosely translated, means ''With Courage and Faith''.<ref name=\"Stockport - Explanation of the Arms of Stockport\">{{cite web | url=http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/towns/stockport3.html | title=Stockport \u2013 Explanation of the Arms of Stockport | publisher=manchester2002-uk.com | accessdate=29 August 2015 | last=Moss | first=John | date=28 April 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122022349/http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/towns/stockport3.html | archive-date=22 November 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The blue shield is taken from the coat of arms of the 'de Stokeport' family, from whom Stockport derives its name.<ref name=\"Stockport - Explanation of the Arms of Stockport\" /><ref name=\"Secret Stockport\" /> The twin-towered castle above the shield is [[Stockport Castle]], which stood until 1775.<ref name=\"STOCKPORT CASTLE\">{{PastScape|mnumber=1085399 | mname=STOCKPORT CASTLE | accessdate=29 August 2015|date=29 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter the completion by the 2015 Group takeover of the club, a new crest was adopted. It was still based on the [[Stockport]] coat of arms, though the ''Animo et Fide'' motto was removed, along with a patch of green at the base of the badge; the [[flag of Cheshire]], featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto. The new version added two white ribbons \u2013 one at the top, with ''Animo et Fide'', and one at the bottom with ''Stockport County F.C.''. In addition, the football was again removed from the shield. The [[Stockport County Supporters' Co - Operative]] used the blue on white cross symbol from the 1978 badge as the main identifier in their company logo. Stockport's kit was supplied by local manufacturer [[Umbro]] who supplied all three kits for the 2013\u201314 season, replacing [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], thus making Stockport the only senior club in the

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

Though both their families moved independently from England to the same town in Canada, Nicholls and Vickers didn't meet until junior high in 1969, where they began collaborating almost immediately. The writing duo moved to Los Angeles in 1983 to continue their careers, and are members of [[Writers Guild of America, West|WGA]], [[Writers Guild of Canada|WGC]], [[Societe des Artistes, Compositeurs et Dramatistes|SACD]], [[SOCAN]], [[Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television|ACCT]], and [[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences|ATAS]].\n\n==Career==\nNicholls and Vickers began writing music and comedy together while at Ridgeway Junior High School (now \u00c9cole \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire Antonine Maillet or Antonine-Maillet Elementary School) in [[Oshawa]], Ontario (Canada). After high school they wrote for stage, radio, TV, syndicated cartoonists and stand-up comedians.\n\nFrom 1979 to 1982 they performed in [[Southern Ontario]] as Nobby Clegg and the Civilians, after having received airplay at [[Brampton, Ontario|Brampton]] alternative station [[CFNY-FM]] with home-recorded songs. The band found some success with the singles \"Essay - Me Dad\" and \"I Wanna Be in Commercials,\" which were also included in the 1981 compilation ''Toronto Calling''. Nicholls and Vickers later used the band's name for a character on the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] show ''[[Rude Awakening (TV series)|Rude Awakening]]''. In that series, the Nobby Clegg character was played by [[Roger Daltrey]], best known as the lead singer of [[The Who]].\n\nFrom 1986 to 1992 they helped write 770 hours of produced material for ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', earning 4 [[Emmy]] nominations, and were the show's [[head writer]]s from December 1989, until Carson's retirement on 22 May 1992.\n\nIn 1997, the pair received a [[Genie]] nomination, Best Animated Series, for ''[[Ned's Newt]]'' ([[Nelvana]]). They also received a [[Writers Guild of Canada|WGC]] nomination for the series in 1999. The title character was voiced by [[Harland Williams]] and was cited in several interviews as one of the favorite TV shows of legendary cartoonist Ed Gorey.  [http://emdashes.com/2004/12/interview-edward-gorey-newsday.php]\n\nIn 2001, the two received a [[Gemini Award|Gemini]] nomination for \"Best Comedy Series\" for their work developing, writing the pilot, and serving as Story Editors on ''[[John Callahan's Quads!]]''.\n\nThe duo were nominated for a Pulcinella Award, Best Animated Episode, at the 2003 Cartoons on the Bay Festival in [[Positano]], Italy, for both ''[[The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]'' and ''[[The World of Tosh]]''.
