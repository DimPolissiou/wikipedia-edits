Both names were also used after the unification, with Italian Libya becoming the official name of the newly combined colony. \n\nIn 1923, indigenous rebels associated with the [[Senussi]] Order organized the [[Libyan resistance movement]] against Italian settlement in Libya.

British Egypt had ceded Kufra and Jarabub to Italian Libya on December 6, 1925, but it was not until the early 1930s that Italy was in full control of the place.

This citizenship was necessary for any Libyan with ambitions to rise in the military or civil organizations. The recipients were officially referred to as Moslem Italians. Libya had become the fourth shore of Italy\u201d(Trye 1998). The incorporation of Libya into the Italian Empire gave the Italian Army a greater ability to exploit native Libyans for military service. Native Libyans served in Italian formations from the beginning of the Italian occupation of Libya. On 1 March 1940, the 1st and 2nd Libyan Divisions were formed. These Libyan Infantry divisions were organized along the lines of the binary Italian infantry division. The 5th Italian Army received the 2nd Libyan Infantry division which it incorporated into the 13th corps. The Italian 10th Army received the 1st Libyan Infantry Division which it incorporated into the reserve. The Italian Libyan infantry divisions were colonial formations (\"colonial\" in the sense of consisting of native troops). These formations had Italian officers commanding them with Libyan NCOs and soldiers. These native Libyan formations were made up of people drawn from the coastal Libyan populations. The training and readiness of these divisions was on an equal footing with the regular Italian formations in North Africa. Their professionalism and 'esprit de corps' made them some of the best Italian infantry formations in North Africa. The Libyan divisions were loyal to Italy and provided a good combat record.<ref>[http://cgsc.cdmhost.com/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/p4013coll2&CISOPTR=597&filename=591.pdf.

The first [[Siege of Tobruk]] in April 1941 marked the first failure of Rommel's [[Blitzkrieg]] tactics. In 1942 there was the [[Battle of Gazala]] when the Axis troops finally conquered Tobruk and pushed the defeated British troops inside Egypt again. Defeat during the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] in Egypt spelled doom for the Axis forces in Libya and meant the end of the [[Western Desert Campaign]].\n\nIn February 1943, retreating German and Italian forces were forced to abandon Libya as they were pushed out of Cyrenaica and Tripolitania, thus ending Italian jurisdiction and control over Libya.\n\nThe Fezzan was occupied by the [[Free French]] in 1943.

Both names were also used after the unification, with Italian Libya becoming the official name of the newly combined colony. \n\nIn 1923, indigenous rebels associated with the [[Senussi]] Order organized the [[Libyan resistance movement]] against Italian settlement in Libya.

This citizenship was necessary for any Libyan with ambitions to rise in the military or civil organizations. The recipients were officially referred to as Moslem Italians. Libya had become the fourth shore of Italy\u201d(Trye 1998). The incorporation of Libya into the Italian Empire gave the Italian Army a greater ability to exploit native Libyans for military service. Native Libyans served in Italian formations from the beginning of the Italian occupation of Libya. On 1 March 1940, the 1st and 2nd Libyan Divisions were formed. These Libyan Infantry divisions were organized along the lines of the binary Italian infantry division. The 5th Italian Army received the 2nd Libyan Infantry division which it incorporated into the 13th corps. The Italian 10th Army received the 1st Libyan Infantry Division which it incorporated into the reserve. The Italian Libyan infantry divisions were colonial formations (\"colonial\" in the sense of consisting of native troops). These formations had Italian officers commanding them with Libyan NCOs and soldiers. These native Libyan formations were made up of people drawn from the coastal Libyan populations. The training and readiness of these divisions was on an equal footing with the regular Italian formations in North Africa. Their professionalism and 'esprit de corps' made them some of the best Italian infantry formations in North Africa. The Libyan divisions were loyal to Italy and provided a good combat record.<ref>[http://cgsc.cdmhost.com/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/p4013coll2&CISOPTR=597&filename=591.pdf.

In 1942 there was the [[Battle of Gazala]] when the Axis troops finally conquered Tobruk and pushed the defeated British troops inside Egypt again. Defeat during the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] in Egypt spelled doom for the Axis forces in Libya and meant the end of the [[Western Desert Campaign]].\n\nIn February 1943, retreating German and Italian forces were forced to abandon Libya as they were pushed out of Cyrenaica and Tripolitania, thus ending Italian jurisdiction and control over Libya.\n\nThe Fezzan was occupied by the [[Free French]] in 1943.

A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor.

A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor.

Many Muslims study Classical Arabic in order to read the [[Quran]] in its original language. It is important to note that written Classical Arabic underwent fundamental changes during the early Islamic era, adding dots to distinguish similarly written letters, and adding the [[Arabic_diacritics#Tashkil_(marks_used_as_phonetic_guides)|''tashk\u012bl'']] (diacritical markings that guide pronunciation) by [[Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali]], [[Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi]], and other scholars. It was the lingua franca across the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], and the [[Horn of Africa]] during classic times and in [[Andalusia]] before classic time. \n\n=== Modern Standard Arabic ===\n\nModern Standard Arabic (MSA) is the literary standard across the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and [[Horn of Africa]], and is one of the six official languages of the [[United Nations]]. Most printed material by the [[Arab League]]&mdash;including most books, newspapers, magazines, official documents, and reading primers for small children&mdash;is written in MSA. It was developed in the early part of the 19th century. [[Varieties of Arabic|\"Colloquial\" Arabic]] refers to the many regional dialects derived from Classical Arabic spoken daily across the region and learned as a [[first language]], and as [[second language]] if people speak other languages native to their particular country. They are not normally written, although a certain amount of literature (particularly plays and poetry, including songs) exists in many of them.\n\nLiterary Arabic (MSA) is the official language of all Arab League countries and is the only form of Arabic taught in schools at all stages. Additionally, some members of religious minorities recite prayers in it, as it is considered the [[literary language]]. Translated versions of the bible which are used in the Arabic speaking countries are mostly written in MSA aside from Classical Arabic.{{clarify|date=September 2018|Are Bibles written in Classical Arabic?}} Muslims recite prayers in it; revised editions of numerous literary texts from [[Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid]] times are also written in MSA.\n\nThe sociolinguistic situation of Arabic in modern times provides a prime example of the linguistic phenomenon of [[diglossia]]{{spaced ndash}}the use of two distinct varieties of the same language, usually in different social contexts.<ref>Farghaly, A., Shaalan, K. [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1644879.1644881 Arabic Natural Language Processing: Challenges and Solutions], ACM Transactions on Asian Language Information Processing (TALIP), the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), 8(4)1-22, December 2009.</ref> This diglossic situation facilitates [[code-switching]] in which a speaker switches back and forth between the two dialects of the language, sometimes even within the same sentence. People speak MSA as a [[third language]] if they speak other languages native to a country as their first language and colloquial Arabic dialects as their second language. Modern Standard Arabic is also spoken by people of Arab descent outside the Arab world when people of Arab descent speaking different dialects communicate to each other. As there is a prestige or standard dialect of vernacular Arabic, speakers of standard colloquial dialects code-switch between these particular dialects and MSA.\n\nClassical Arabic is considered normative; a few contemporary authors attempt (with varying degrees of success) to follow the syntactic and grammatical norms laid down by classical grammarians (such as [[Sibawayh]]) and to use the vocabulary defined in classical dictionaries (such as the ''Lisan al-Arab, {{lang-ar|\u0644\u0650\u0633\u064e\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628}}).\n\nHowever, the exigencies of modernity have led to the adoption of numerous terms which would have been mysterious to a classical author, whether taken from other languages (e.&nbsp;g. {{lang|ar|\u0641\u064a\u0644\u0645}} ''film'') or coined from existing lexical resources (e.&nbsp;g. {{lang|ar|\u0647\u0627\u062a\u0641}} ''h\u0101tif''&nbsp; \"caller\" > \"telephone\").{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} Structural influence from foreign languages or from the vernaculars has also affected Modern Standard Arabic: for example, MSA texts sometimes use the format \"A, B, C and D\" when listing things, whereas Classical Arabic prefers \"A and B and C and D\", and subject-initial sentences may be more common in MSA than in Classical Arabic.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Alan S.

Modern Standard Arabic principally differs from Classical Arabic in three areas: lexicon, stylistics, and certain innovations on the periphery that are not strictly regulated by the classical authorities. On the whole, Modern Standard Arabic is not homogeneous; there are authors who write in a style very close to the classical models and others who try to create new stylistic patterns.<ref>https://asianabsolute.co.uk/arabic-language-dialects/ Arabic Language Dialects</ref><!-- a different style makes it a different language? --> Add to this regional differences in vocabulary depending upon the influence of the local Arabic varieties and the influences of foreign languages, such as French in Africa and Lebanon or English in Egypt, Jordan, and other countries.<ref>Wolfdietrich Fischer. 1997. \"Classical Arabic,\" ''The Semitic Languages''. London:  Routledge. Pg 189.</ref>\n\nAs MSA is a revised and simplified form of Classical Arabic, MSA in terms of lexicon omitted the obsolete words used in Classical Arabic. As diglossia is involved, various Arabic dialects freely [[loanword|borrow words]] from MSA. This situation is similar to [[Romance languages]], wherein scores of words were borrowed directly from [[Classical Latin|formal Latin]] (most literate Romance speakers were also literate in Latin); educated speakers of standard colloquial dialects speak in this kind of communication.\n\nReading out loud in MSA for various reasons is becoming increasingly simpler, using less strict rules compared to CA, notably the [[i`r\u0101b|inflection]] is omitted, making it closer to spoken varieties of Arabic. It depends on the speaker's knowledge and attitude to the grammar of Classical Arabic, as well as the region and the intended audience.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nPronunciation of native words, loanwords, foreign names in MSA is loose, names can be pronounced or even spelled differently in different regions and by different speakers. Pronunciation also depends on the person's education, linguistic knowledge and abilities. There may be sounds used, which are missing in the Classical Arabic but may exist in colloquial varieties - consonants - {{IPAslink|v}}, {{IPAslink|p}}, {{IPAslink|t\u0361\u0283}} (often realized as {{IPAblink|t}}+{{IPAblink|\u0283}})<!--DON'T ADD [\u0261] BECAUSE IT'S THE STANDARD FOR LITERARY ARABIC in Egypt AND REGIONS IN YEMEN-->, these consonants may or may not be written with special letters; and vowels - {{IPAblink|o}}, {{IPAblink|e}} (both short and long), there are no special letters in Arabic to distinguish between {{IPA|[e~i]}} and {{IPA|[o~u]}} pairs but the sounds o and e (short and long) exist in the colloquial varieties of Arabic and some foreign words in MSA. The differentiation of [[varieties of Arabic#phonetics|pronunciation of informal dialects]] is the influence from other languages previously spoken and some still presently spoken in the regions, such as [[Coptic language|Coptic]] in Egypt, [[French language|French]], [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], [[Italian language|Italian]],  [[Spanish language|Spanish]],  [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Punic language|Punic]] or [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] in North Africa, [[Himyaritic language|Himyaritic]], [[Modern South Arabian]] and [[Old South Arabian]] in Yemen and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] in the Levant.\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{Main article|Arabic phonology|l1=Modern Standard Arabic phonology}}\n\n=== Consonants ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Modern Standard Arabic consonant phonemes\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Dental consonant|Dental]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Denti-alveolar consonant|Denti-alveolar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Palato-alveolar consonant|Palato-<br>alveolar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Uvular consonant|Uvular]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Pharyngeal consonant|Pharyngeal]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|- style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\n! plain\n!

Differences are also apparent in the use of punctuation and writing styles.\n\nIt should be mentioned that many Arabic speakers do not find a noteworthy difference between these varieties, and may sometimes refer to both by the same name: ''al-\u02bbArab\u012byah al-Fu\u1e63\u1e25\u00e1'', \"the Eloquent Arabic\".\n\n=== Differences in syntax ===\nMSA tends to use simplified structures and drop more complicated ones commonly used in Classical Arabic. Some examples include reliance on verb sentences instead of noun phrases and semi-sentences, as well as avoiding phrasal adjectives and accommodating feminine forms of ranks and job titles.<ref name=\"Arabic\" />\n\n=== Differences in terminology ===\nTerminology is the main domain where MSA and CA differ substantially. This stems from the need of MSA to adapt with modern-day terminology in the technical, literary, and scientific domains. The vast majority of these terms refer to items or concepts that did not exist in the time of CA. MSA tends to be more accepting to non-Arabic terminology. Despite the efforts of Arabic Language Academies in the second half of the 20th century to Arabize modern terminology using classical Arabization practices, the fast pace of modern development made transliteration the method of choice for Arabizing modern day terminology.<ref name=\"Arabic\">{{Cite web|url=http://msarabic.com/index.php/en/paper|title=White Paper|last=Arabic|first=AL|website=msarabic.com|access-date=2016-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223214727/http://www.msarabic.com/index.php/en/paper|archive-date=2018-02-23|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://al-arabic.com/index.php/blog-wrapper/blog/82-blog/translation-localization/104-transliteration-in-arabic|title=\u0648\u0631\u0642\u0629 \u0639\u0645\u0644 \u062d\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0639\u0631\u064a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0641\u0638\u064a \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u063a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629|last=\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f|first=\u062f. \u0639\u0644\u064a|website=al-arabic.com|access-date=2016-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823014756/http://al-arabic.com/index.php/blog-wrapper/blog/82-blog/translation-localization/104-transliteration-in-arabic|archive-date=2016-08-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Differences in pronunciation ===\nMSA differs from CA in the use of sounds not available in the Arabic script and diacritics ([[Tashk\u012bl]]). Unlike Classical Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic accepts the use of consonants that are not supported in the Arabic script, such as {{IPAslink|p}}, and {{IPAslink|v}}. Modern Standard Arabic normally does not use Tashk\u012bl, but only in disambiguation and not the full word is diacriticized, while Classical Arabic found in [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]] scriptures normally prefer indicating full diacritics.<ref name=\"Arabic\"/>\n\n=== Differences in punctuation ===\nModern Standard Arabic has adopted several punctuation marks from other languages, and dropped some classical Arabic ones. Modern technology, especially in printing press and the use of the Internet, has contributed largely to this trend.<ref name=\"Arabic\"/>\n\n=== Differences in style ===\nModern Standard Arabic adopts modern writing forms, such as essays, opinion articles, and technical reports, instead of classical ones. Moreover, some new writing forms are directly imported from foreign languages, such as guides, blog posts, and other forms of writing. Moreover, some classical writing forms disappeared completely, such as [[Maqama|Maqam]].\n\n== Regional variants ==\nMSA is loosely uniform across the Middle East as it is based on the convention of Arabic speakers rather than being a regulated language which rules are followed (that is despite the number of academies regulating Arabic). It can be thought of as being in a continuum between CA (the regulated language described in grammar books) and the [[varieties of Arabic|spoken vernaculars]] while leaning much more to CA in its written form than its spoken form.\n\nRegional variations exist due to influence from [[Varieties of Arabic|the spoken vernaculars]]. TV hosts who read prepared MSA scripts, for example in [[Al Jazeera]], are ordered to give up national or ethnic pronunciations by changing their pronunciation of certain phonemes (e.g. the realization of the Classical ''{{transl|ar|ALA|j\u012bm}}'' {{lang|ar|[[\u062c]]}} as {{IPAblink|\u0261}} by Egyptians), though other traits may show the speaker's region, such as the [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] and the exact value of vowels and the pronunciation of other consonants. People who speak MSA also mix vernacular and Classical in pronunciation, words, and grammatical forms. Classical/vernacular mixing in formal writing can also be found (e.g., in some Egyptian newspaper editorials); others are written in Modern Standard/vernacular mixing, including entertainment news.\n\n== Speakers ==\n{{see also|Arab League#Literacy in Arab league countries}}\nPeople who are literate in Modern Standard Arabic are primarily found in most countries of the [[Arab League]]. It may be assumed that the number of speakers of the language to be the number of literate people in this region,{{Original research inline|date=August 2019}} because it is compulsory in schools of most of the Arab League to learn Modern Standard Arabic. People who are literate in the language are usually more so [[passive speaker (language)|passively]], as they mostly use the language in reading and writing, not in speaking.\n\nThe countries with the largest populations that mandate MSA be taught in all schools are, with [[Rounding#Round half up|rounded-up]] numbers (data from 2008\u20142014): <!--DON'T ADD OTHER COUNTRIES.

Many Muslims study Classical Arabic in order to read the [[Quran]] in its original language. It is important to note that written Classical Arabic underwent fundamental changes during the early Islamic era, adding dots to distinguish similarly written letters, and adding the [[Arabic_diacritics#Tashkil_(marks_used_as_phonetic_guides)|''tashk\u012bl'']] (diacritical markings that guide pronunciation) by [[Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali]], [[Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi]], and other scholars. It was the lingua franca across the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], and the [[Horn of Africa]] during classic times and in [[Andalusia]] before classic time. \n\n=== Modern Standard Arabic ===\n\nModern Standard Arabic (MSA) is the literary standard across the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and [[Horn of Africa]], and is one of the six official languages of the [[United Nations]]. Most printed material by the [[Arab League]]&mdash;including most books, newspapers, magazines, official documents, and reading primers for small children&mdash;is written in MSA. It was developed in the early part of the 19th century. [[Varieties of Arabic|\"Colloquial\" Arabic]] refers to the many regional dialects derived from Classical Arabic spoken daily across the region and learned as a [[first language]], and as [[second language]] if people speak other languages native to their particular country. They are not normally written, although a certain amount of literature (particularly plays and poetry, including songs) exists in many of them.\n\nLiterary Arabic (MSA) is the official language of all Arab League countries and is the only form of Arabic taught in schools at all stages. Additionally, some members of religious minorities recite prayers in it, as it is considered the [[literary language]]. Translated versions of the bible which are used in the Arabic speaking countries are mostly written in MSA aside from Classical Arabic.{{clarify|date=September 2018|Are Bibles written in Classical Arabic?}} Muslims recite prayers in it; revised editions of numerous literary texts from [[Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid]] times are also written in MSA.\n\nThe sociolinguistic situation of Arabic in modern times provides a prime example of the linguistic phenomenon of [[diglossia]]{{spaced ndash}}the use of two distinct varieties of the same language, usually in different social contexts.<ref>Farghaly, A., Shaalan, K. [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1644879.1644881 Arabic Natural Language Processing: Challenges and Solutions], ACM Transactions on Asian Language Information Processing (TALIP), the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), 8(4)1-22, December 2009.</ref> This diglossic situation facilitates [[code-switching]] in which a speaker switches back and forth between the two dialects of the language, sometimes even within the same sentence. People speak MSA as a [[third language]] if they speak other languages native to a country as their first language and colloquial Arabic dialects as their second language. Modern Standard Arabic is also spoken by people of Arab descent outside the Arab world when people of Arab descent speaking different dialects communicate to each other. As there is a prestige or standard dialect of vernacular Arabic, speakers of standard colloquial dialects code-switch between these particular dialects and MSA.\n\nClassical Arabic is considered normative; a few contemporary authors attempt (with varying degrees of success) to follow the syntactic and grammatical norms laid down by classical grammarians (such as [[Sibawayh]]) and to use the vocabulary defined in classical dictionaries (such as the ''Lisan al-Arab, {{lang-ar|\u0644\u0650\u0633\u064e\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628}}).\n\nHowever, the exigencies of modernity have led to the adoption of numerous terms which would have been mysterious to a classical author, whether taken from other languages (e.&nbsp;g. {{lang|ar|\u0641\u064a\u0644\u0645}} ''film'') or coined from existing lexical resources (e.&nbsp;g. {{lang|ar|\u0647\u0627\u062a\u0641}} ''h\u0101tif''&nbsp; \"caller\" > \"telephone\").{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} Structural influence from foreign languages or from the vernaculars has also affected Modern Standard Arabic: for example, MSA texts sometimes use the format \"A, B, C and D\" when listing things, whereas Classical Arabic prefers \"A and B and C and D\", and subject-initial sentences may be more common in MSA than in Classical Arabic.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Alan S. Kaye |year= 1991 |title= The Hamzat al-Wa\u1e63l in Contemporary Modern Standard Arabic |journal= Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume= 111 |issue= 3 |pages= 572\u2013574 |doi= 10.2307/604273 |jstor= 604273}}</ref> For these reasons, Modern Standard Arabic is generally treated separately in non-Arab sources.<ref>http://www.londonarabictuition.com/lessons.php?type=2 London Arabic Tuition</ref> Speakers of Modern Standard Arabic do not always observe the intricate rules of Classical Arabic grammar. Modern Standard Arabic principally differs from Classical Arabic in three areas: lexicon, stylistics, and certain innovations on the periphery that are not strictly regulated by the classical authorities. On the whole, Modern Standard Arabic is not homogeneous; there are authors who write in a style very close to the classical models and others who try to create new stylistic patterns.<ref>https://asianabsolute.co.uk/arabic-language-dialects/ Arabic Language Dialects</ref><!-- a different style makes it a different language? --> Add to this regional differences in vocabulary depending upon the influence of the local Arabic varieties and the influences of foreign languages, such as French in Africa and Lebanon or English in Egypt, Jordan, and other countries.<ref>Wolfdietrich Fischer. 1997. \"Classical Arabic,\" ''The Semitic Languages''. London:  Routledge. Pg 189.</ref>\n\nAs MSA is a revised and simplified form of Classical Arabic, MSA in terms of lexicon omitted the obsolete words used in Classical Arabic. As diglossia is involved, various Arabic dialects freely [[loanword|borrow words]] from MSA. This situation is similar to [[Romance languages]], wherein scores of words were borrowed directly from [[Classical Latin|formal Latin]] (most literate Romance speakers were also literate in Latin); educated speakers of standard colloquial dialects speak in this kind of communication.\n\nReading out loud in MSA for various reasons is becoming increasingly simpler, using less strict rules compared to CA, notably the [[i`r\u0101b|inflection]] is omitted, making it closer to spoken varieties of Arabic. It depends on the speaker's knowledge and attitude to the grammar of Classical Arabic, as well as the region and the intended audience.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nPronunciation of native words, loanwords, foreign names in MSA is loose, names can be pronounced or even spelled differently in different regions and by different speakers. Pronunciation also depends on the person's education, linguistic knowledge and abilities.

Differences are also apparent in the use of punctuation and writing styles.\n\nIt should be mentioned that many Arabic speakers do not find a noteworthy difference between these varieties, and may sometimes refer to both by the same name: ''al-\u02bbArab\u012byah al-Fu\u1e63\u1e25\u00e1'', \"the Eloquent Arabic\".\n\n=== Differences in syntax ===\nMSA tends to use simplified structures and drop more complicated ones commonly used in Classical Arabic. Some examples include reliance on verb sentences instead of noun phrases and semi-sentences, as well as avoiding phrasal adjectives and accommodating feminine forms of ranks and job titles.<ref name=\"Arabic\" />\n\n=== Differences in terminology ===\nTerminology is the main domain where MSA and CA differ substantially. This stems from the need of MSA to adapt with modern-day terminology in the technical, literary, and scientific domains. The vast majority of these terms refer to items or concepts that did not exist in the time of CA. MSA tends to be more accepting to non-Arabic terminology. Despite the efforts of Arabic Language Academies in the second half of the 20th century to Arabize modern terminology using classical Arabization practices, the fast pace of modern development made transliteration the method of choice for Arabizing modern day terminology.<ref name=\"Arabic\">{{Cite web|url=http://msarabic.com/index.php/en/paper|title=White Paper|last=Arabic|first=AL|website=msarabic.com|access-date=2016-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223214727/http://www.msarabic.com/index.php/en/paper|archive-date=2018-02-23|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://al-arabic.com/index.php/blog-wrapper/blog/82-blog/translation-localization/104-transliteration-in-arabic|title=\u0648\u0631\u0642\u0629 \u0639\u0645\u0644 \u062d\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0639\u0631\u064a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0641\u0638\u064a \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u063a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629|last=\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f|first=\u062f. \u0639\u0644\u064a|website=al-arabic.com|access-date=2016-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823014756/http://al-arabic.com/index.php/blog-wrapper/blog/82-blog/translation-localization/104-transliteration-in-arabic|archive-date=2016-08-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Differences in pronunciation ===\nMSA differs from CA in the use of sounds not available in the Arabic script and diacritics ([[Tashk\u012bl]]). Unlike Classical Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic accepts the use of consonants that are not supported in the Arabic script, such as {{IPAslink|p}}, and {{IPAslink|v}}. Modern Standard Arabic normally does not use Tashk\u012bl, but only in disambiguation and not the full word is diacriticized, while Classical Arabic found in [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]] scriptures normally prefer indicating full diacritics.<ref name=\"Arabic\"/>\n\n=== Differences in punctuation ===\nModern Standard Arabic has adopted several punctuation marks from other languages, and dropped some classical Arabic ones. Modern technology, especially in printing press and the use of the Internet, has contributed largely to this trend.<ref name=\"Arabic\"/>\n\n=== Differences in style ===\nModern Standard Arabic adopts modern writing forms, such as essays, opinion articles, and technical reports, instead of classical ones. Moreover, some new writing forms are directly imported from foreign languages, such as guides, blog posts, and other forms of writing. Moreover, some classical writing forms disappeared completely, such as [[Maqama|Maqam]].\n\n== Regional variants ==\nMSA is loosely uniform across the Middle East as it is based on the convention of Arabic speakers rather than being a regulated language which rules are followed (that is despite the number of academies regulating Arabic). It can be thought of as being in a continuum between CA (the regulated language described in grammar books) and the [[varieties of Arabic|spoken vernaculars]] while leaning much more to CA in its written form than its spoken form.\n\nRegional variations exist due to influence from [[Varieties of Arabic|the spoken vernaculars]]. TV hosts who read prepared MSA scripts, for example in [[Al Jazeera]], are ordered to give up national or ethnic pronunciations by changing their pronunciation of certain phonemes (e.g. the realization of the Classical ''{{transl|ar|ALA|j\u012bm}}'' {{lang|ar|[[\u062c]]}} as {{IPAblink|\u0261}} by Egyptians), though other traits may show the speaker's region, such as the [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] and the exact value of vowels and the pronunciation of other consonants. People who speak MSA also mix vernacular and Classical in pronunciation, words, and grammatical forms. Classical/vernacular mixing in formal writing can also be found (e.g., in some Egyptian newspaper editorials); others are written in Modern Standard/vernacular mixing, including entertainment news.\n\n== Speakers ==\n{{see also|Arab League#Literacy in Arab league countries}}\nPeople who are literate in Modern Standard Arabic are primarily found in most countries of the [[Arab League]]. It may be assumed that the number of speakers of the language to be the number of literate people in this region,{{Original research inline|date=August 2019}} because it is compulsory in schools of most of the Arab League to learn Modern Standard Arabic. People who are literate in the language are usually more so [[passive speaker (language)|passively]], as they mostly use the language in reading and writing, not in speaking.\n\nThe countries with the largest populations that mandate MSA be taught in all schools are, with [[Rounding#Round half up|rounded-up]] numbers (data from 2008\u20142014): <!--DON'T ADD OTHER COUNTRIES.

The major reasons for this change in position had been due to South African production falling by 50% in the past decade as production costs there have risen, more stringent safety regulations have been implemented, and existing mines have become depleted.\n\nOn the other hand, as of 2014 [[gold]] output in China had more than doubled since year 2000. In recent years, China's [[gold mining]] industry has received increased foreign and domestic investment, and project numbers have increased as more discoveries have been found.

In 2000, there were about 2,000 gold producers - most of them relatively small and unsophisticated by international standards.  Few are able to operate on a global platform, though the number of producers had shrunk to about 800 in 2007 after [[mergers and acquisitions]] and restructuring and consolidation. Most of these firms' technological standards and management are weak and inefficient.\n\nThe country's oldest and largest gold producer is the [[China National Gold Group Corporation]] (CNGGC), which accounts for 20% of total gold production in China and controls more than 30% of domestic reserves. CNGGC also controls [[Zhongji Gold]], the first [[publicly listed]] gold mining company in China.\n\n== Production and reserves ==\nChina's gold reserves are relatively small (about 7% of the world total). Production has usually been concentrated in the eastern provinces of [[Shandong]], [[Henan]], [[Fujian]] and [[Liaoning]]. Recently, western provinces such as [[Guizhou]] and [[Yunnan]] have seen a sharp increase, but from a relatively small base.

Though foreign investment still constitutes a very important part of gold mining expansion, since 1995 it has no longer been actively encouraged by the Chinese government.\n\nVancouver-based [[Jinshan Gold Mines]] Inc. started production in July at its [[Chang Shan Hao]] gold mine in China's northern province of [[Inner Mongolia]], reaching 19,000 ounces of gold by December 18. The mine is designed to produce about 120,000 ounces of gold per year, making it one of the country's largest producers.\n\nMultibillion-dollar Indian Liberty Group owns two mines in China, and is scheduled to start mining in 2012\n\n[[Gold Fields]] and Australia's [[Sino Gold Mining]] Ltd., have set up a joint venture focused on discovering large gold deposits in China with the potential to produce about 500,000 ounces a year. [[Sino Gold]] has been buying stakes in Chinese gold deposits and explorers.

In 2007, [[fabrication (metal)|fabrication]] rose 18%, helped by demand from China's increasingly wealthy middle and upper classes. With a rapid rise in domestic demand, China is now the world's fourth largest gold-consuming country. Chinese market demand accounts for 9.2% of worldwide gold consumption.\n\n== Investment in Foreign Mines ==\nIn 2006 the Chinese Government began encouraging some private and state-owned companies to pursue mining deals outside of China.

It is first necessary to make clear the meaning of the names; they are distinct, despite the persistently held opinion in onomastic (dictionaries) and popular thought. In Spain Ignacio and I\u00f1igo are at times used interchangeably just as if they were Jacobo and Jaime. With reference to the name I\u00f1igo, it is fitting to give some essential notions to eliminate ambiguities and help understand what follows. This name first appears on the Ascoli brome (dated November 18, 90 BC), in a list of Spanish knights belonging to a Turma salluitana or Saragossan. It speaks of Elandus Enneces f[ilius], and according to Men\u00e9ndez Pidal the final \u00abs\u00bb is the \u00abz\u00bb of Spanish patronymics, and could be nothing other than Elando I\u00f1iguez. It is an ancestral Hispanic name. Ignacio, on the other hand, is a Latin name. In classical Latin there is Egnatius with an initial E. It appears only twice with an initial I (Ignatius) in the sixty volumes of the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum. This late Latin and Greek form prevailed. In the classical period Egnatius was used as a nomen (gentilitial name) and not as a praenomen (first name) or cognomen (surname), except in very rare cases. (...) The most important conclusion, perhaps unexpected, but not unknown, is that St. Ignatius did not change his name. That is to say, he did not intend to change it. What he did was to adopt for France and Italy a name which he believed was a simple variant of his own, and which was more acceptable among foreigners.... If he had remained in Spain, he would have, without doubt, remained I\u00f1igo.}}</ref>\n\n\u00cd\u00f1igo was the youngest of thirteen children.

It also inspired his method of meditation, since Ludolph proposes that the reader place himself mentally at the scene of the Gospel story, visualising the crib at the Nativity, etc. This type of meditation, known as Simple Contemplation, was the basis for the method that St. Ignatius would promote in his ''[[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]]''.<ref>Sr Mary Immaculate Bodenstedt, \"The Vita Christi of Ludolphus the Carthusian\", a Dissertation, Washington: Catholic University of America Press 1944 British Library Catalogue No. Ac2692.y/29.(16).</ref><ref>\"The Vita Christi\" by Charles Abbot Conway ''Analecta Cartusiana'' 34</ref><ref>\"Ludolph's Life of Christ\" by Father Henry James Coleridge in ''The Month'' Vol. 17 (New Series VI) July\u2013December 1872, pp. 337\u2013370</ref>\n\nAside from dreaming about imitating the saints in his readings, \u00cd\u00f1igo was still wandering off in his mind about what \"he would do in service to his king and in honor of the royal lady he was in love with\".

These women were considered ''[[alumbrados]]'' (Illuminated, Illuminati, or Enlightened Ones) \u2013 a group that was linked in their zeal and spirituality to Franciscan reforms, but had incurred mounting suspicion on the part of the administrators of the Inquisition.

It is first necessary to make clear the meaning of the names; they are distinct, despite the persistently held opinion in onomastic (dictionaries) and popular thought. In Spain Ignacio and I\u00f1igo are at times used interchangeably just as if they were Jacobo and Jaime. With reference to the name I\u00f1igo, it is fitting to give some essential notions to eliminate ambiguities and help understand what follows. This name first appears on the Ascoli brome (dated November 18, 90 BC), in a list of Spanish knights belonging to a Turma salluitana or Saragossan. It speaks of Elandus Enneces f[ilius], and according to Men\u00e9ndez Pidal the final \u00abs\u00bb is the \u00abz\u00bb of Spanish patronymics, and could be nothing other than Elando I\u00f1iguez. It is an ancestral Hispanic name. Ignacio, on the other hand, is a Latin name. In classical Latin there is Egnatius with an initial E. It appears only twice with an initial I (Ignatius) in the sixty volumes of the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum. This late Latin and Greek form prevailed. In the classical period Egnatius was used as a nomen (gentilitial name) and not as a praenomen (first name) or cognomen (surname), except in very rare cases. (...) The most important conclusion, perhaps unexpected, but not unknown, is that St. Ignatius did not change his name. That is to say, he did not intend to change it. What he did was to adopt for France and Italy a name which he believed was a simple variant of his own, and which was more acceptable among foreigners.... If he had remained in Spain, he would have, without doubt, remained I\u00f1igo.}}</ref>\n\n\u00cd\u00f1igo was the youngest of thirteen children.

Hospitals in those days were run by religious orders, and the reading material available to bedridden patients tended to be selected from scripture or devotional literature.

This work took Ludolph forty years to complete.</ref> This book would influence his whole life, inspiring him to devote himself to God and follow the example of [[Francis of Assisi]] and other great monks. It also inspired his method of meditation, since Ludolph proposes that the reader place himself mentally at the scene of the Gospel story, visualising the crib at the Nativity, etc. This type of meditation, known as Simple Contemplation, was the basis for the method that St. Ignatius would promote in his ''[[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]]''.<ref>Sr Mary Immaculate Bodenstedt, \"The Vita Christi of Ludolphus the Carthusian\", a Dissertation, Washington: Catholic University of America Press 1944 British Library Catalogue No. Ac2692.y/29.(16).</ref><ref>\"The Vita Christi\" by Charles Abbot Conway ''Analecta Cartusiana'' 34</ref><ref>\"Ludolph's Life of Christ\" by Father Henry James Coleridge in ''The Month'' Vol. 17 (New Series VI) July\u2013December 1872, pp. 337\u2013370</ref>\n\nAside from dreaming about imitating the saints in his readings, \u00cd\u00f1igo was still wandering off in his mind about what \"he would do in service to his king and in honor of the royal lady he was in love with\".
