It stars [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]], [[Claire Bloom]], [[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]], and [[Russ Tamblyn]]. The film depicts the experiences of a small group of people invited by a [[paranormal]] investigator to investigate a purportedly [[haunted house]].\n\nScreenwriter Gidding, who had worked with director Wise on the film ''[[I Want to Live!]]'' (1958), began a six-month write of the script after reading the book, which Wise had given to him. He perceived the book to be more about mental breakdown than [[ghost]]s, and although he was informed after meeting author Shirley Jackson that it was very much a supernatural novel, elements of mental breakdown were introduced into the film. The film was shot at the [[MGM-British Studios]] near London, UK on a budget of US$1.05 million, with exteriors and the grounds shot at [[Ettington Park Hotel|Ettington Park]] (now the Ettington Park Hotel) in the village of [[Ettington]], [[Warwickshire]]. Julie Harris was cast by Wise, who found her ideal for the psychologically fragile Eleanor, though during production she suffered from depression and had an uneasy relationship with her co-stars. The interior sets were by [[Elliot Scott]], credited by Wise as instrumental in the making of ''The Haunting''. They were designed to be brightly lit, with no dark corners or recesses, and decorated in a [[Rococo#Interior design|Rococo]] style; all the rooms had ceilings to create a claustrophobic effect on film. Numerous devices and tricks were used in the filming. Wise used a 30mm [[Anamorphic format|anamorphic]], [[wide-angle lens]] [[Panavision]] camera that was not technically ready for use and caused distortions. It was only given to Wise on condition that he sign a memorandum in which he acknowledged that the lens was imperfect. Wise and cinematographer Davis Boulton planned sequences that kept the camera moving, utilizing low-angle takes, and incorporating unusual [[Panning (camera)|pans]] and [[tracking shot]]s.\n\nThe film was released on 18 September 1963. In 2010, ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper ranked it as the 13th-best horror film of all time. Director [[Martin Scorsese]] has placed ''The Haunting'' first on his list of the 11 scariest horror films of all time. ''The Haunting'' was released on [[DVD]] in its original screen format with commentary in 2003, and was released on [[Blu-ray]] on 15 October 2013. [[The Haunting (1999 film)|The film was remade in 1999]] by director [[Jan de Bont]], starring [[Liam Neeson]], [[Lili Taylor]], [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] and [[Owen Wilson]], but that version was heavily panned by critics and audiences.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=October 2019}}\nDr. John Markway narrates the history of the 90-year-old Hill House, which was constructed in [[Massachusetts]] by Hugh Crain as a home for his wife. She died when her carriage crashed against a tree as she approached the house for the first time. Crain remarried, but his second wife died in the house from a fall down the stairs. Crain's daughter Abigail lived in the house for the rest of her life, never moving out of the [[Nursery (room)|nursery]]. She died calling for her nurse-companion. The companion inherited the house, but later [[Suicide|hanged herself]] from a spiral staircase in the library. Hill House was eventually inherited by a Mrs. Sanderson, although it has stood empty for some time.\n\nMarkway wishes to study the reported paranormal activity at Hill House. He secures a lease from Mrs. Sanderson to occupy the mansion for the duration of his investigation; conditional to his acceptance is that he take Luke Sanderson, her heir, with him. Among several prospective choices only two individuals accept Markway's invitation to join the investigation\u2014a psychic, Theodora, also known as Theo, and the meek Eleanor Lance, who experienced [[poltergeist]] activity as a child. Eleanor spent her adult life caring for her invalid mother, whose recent death has left Eleanor with severe guilt.\n\nThe large, maze-like mansion's walls were constructed with angles slightly askew, resulting in off-center [[Perspective (visual)|perspectives]] and doors that open and close by themselves. The immense library contains the ramshackle spiral staircase from which the previous owner hanged herself; the vast [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatory]] is adorned with eerie statues. During their first night in the house, Eleanor and Theo are terrified by [[supernatural]] occurrences outside Theo's bedroom door. Deafening banging is heard against the door and the voice of a young girl is heard echoing with laughter. Despite the turbulence, Eleanor feels a tentative affinity to Hill House.\n\nThe team explores the house the next day, discovering a [[Cold spot (paranormal)|cold spot]] outside the nursery and encountering other supernatural phenomena. Markway reveals more about the hauntings that have allegedly occurred. Following another night of loud disturbances the team discovers the words \"HELP ELEANOR COME HOME\" scrawled on a wall, which causes Eleanor severe distress.\n\nThat night, Theo moves into Eleanor's room and they fall asleep in the same bed.  Eleanor is awakened by the sounds of a man speaking indistinctly and a woman laughing.  Fearful, Eleanor asks Theo to hold her hand and soon she feels a crushing grip. As Eleanor hears the sound of a young girl crying, she shouts at whoever is causing the child pain. Theo awakens with a start and turns on the light. Eleanor then sees that she has moved from the bed to the couch, and realizes that Theo was not the one she felt holding her hand.\n\nThe following day Dr. Markway's wife Grace arrives at Hill House to warn her husband that a reporter has learned of Markway's investigation of Hill House. Markway is concerned when Grace announces that she plans to join the group for the duration of the investigation. She demands a bed in the nursery despite her husband's warning that it is likely the center of the disturbances. That night the group experiences loud banging and an unseen force attempting to force its way through the living room in which they are staying.  The banging then proceeds to move its way up towards the nursery, where sounds of destruction are heard. This prompts Eleanor to run towards the source; however, Grace is nowhere to be found. Her disappearance is then confirmed the following  morning. Eleanor's mental instability worsens as she falls further under the spell of Hill House. She enters the library and climbs the dilapidated spiral staircase. Once she reaches the top, Grace appears unexpectedly at a trap door and the startled Eleanor nearly falls to her death. Markway rescues Eleanor but just misses seeing Grace, who has disappeared back into the house.\n\nMarkway becomes alarmed at Eleanor's obsession with Hill House in spite of the dangers it poses for her. Despite Eleanor's pleas to stay, Markway insists that she leave at once and asks Luke to accompany her home. Before he can join her in the car, Eleanor drives off and speeds down the road toward the front gates. She soon feels the steering wheel move by itself and the car advances erratically. At first she struggles to regain control but then surrenders to the unseen force. Suddenly Grace appears from behind a tree and steps in front of the car. Eleanor crashes into the tree and is killed. Luke observes it seemed that Eleanor deliberately aimed the car at the tree, but Markway asserts that something was in the car with her. He notes that the tree that claimed Eleanor's life is the same one that killed the first Mrs. Crain. Theo remarks that Eleanor got what she wanted\u2014to remain with the house.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]] as Eleanor \"Nell\" Lance\n*[[Claire Bloom]] as Theodora \"Theo\"\n*[[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]] as Dr. John Markway\n*[[Russ Tamblyn]] as Luke Sanderson\n*[[Fay Compton]] as Mrs. Sanderson\n*[[Rosalie Crutchley]] as Mrs. Dudley\n*[[Lois Maxwell]] as Grace Markway\n*[[Valentine Dyall]] as Mr. Dudley\n*[[Diane Clare]] as Carrie Fredericks\n*[[Ronald Adam (actor)|Ronald Adam]] as Eldridge Harper\n{{col-2}}\n;Uncredited roles\n*Pamela Buckley as First Mrs. Crain\n*Janet Mansell as 8-year-old Abigail Crain\n*[[Amy Dalby]] as 80-year-old Abigail Crain\n*Rosemary Dorken as Abigail Crain's Nurse-Companion\n*Verina Greenlaw as Dora Fredericks\n*Claude Jones as Garage Attendant\n*Freda Knorr as Second Mrs. Crain\n*[[Howard Lang]] as Hugh Crain\n*[[Paul Maxwell]] as Bud Fredericks\n*Susan Richards as Nurse\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Robert Wise]] was in post-production on ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'' when he read a review in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine of author [[Shirley Jackson]]'s novel, ''[[The Haunting of Hill House]]''.{{sfn|Rigby|2000|p=120}} Wise read the book and found it frightening; he passed it to screenwriter friend Nelson Gidding, with whom he had worked on the film ''[[I Want to Live!]]'' (1958).<ref name=\"Marriott1959\">[[#Marriott|Marriott 2012]], p. 1959</ref> Gidding did a full [[Film treatment|story treatment]] for Wise before proceeding to work on the adaptation.<ref name=\"Gidding65\" /> As Gidding crafted the screenplay, he came to believe that the novel was not a ghost story at all, but rather a compilation of the insane thoughts of the lead character, Eleanor Vance. He theorised that Vance was having a [[nervous breakdown]], envisaging a scenario in which Hill House is the hospital where she is held, Markway is her psychiatrist, the cold, banging, and violence are the results of [[Electroconvulsive therapy|shock treatment]], and the opening and closing of doors reflected the opening and closing of hospital doors.<ref>[[#Gidding|Gidding and Weaver 2001]], p. 64.</ref> Wise and Gidding traveled to [[Bennington, Vermont]] to meet Jackson, who told them that it was a good idea but that the novel was definitely about the supernatural.<ref>[[#Gidding|Gidding and Weaver 2001]], pp. 64-65.</ref> Nonetheless, elements of the insanity concept remained in the script, so that the audience was left wondering whether the supernatural events in the film were in Eleanor's mind or whether they were real.<ref name=\"Gidding65\">[[#Gidding|Gidding and Weaver 2001]], p. 65.</ref> It was also during their visit to speak with Jackson that Wise and Gidding chose the title for the film. As they did not want to keep the book title, they asked Jackson if she had considered an alternative title. She suggested ''The Haunting'', which Wise and Gidding immediately adopted.<ref name=\"Sloane22\">[[#Sloane|Sloane 1995]], p. 22.</ref>\n\n===Script===\nWriting the screenplay took about six months. During this period, Gidding worked alone, and although he passed some of his work to Wise to show him that work on the screenplay was progressing well, he and Wise did not otherwise collaborate on the screenplay.<ref name=\"Gidding65\" /> The screenplay made other changes to the story. The number of characters was cut down, the backstory was significantly shortened, most of the supernatural events depicted in the novel were kept off-screen, and the greater part of the action was set inside the house to heighten the audience's feeling of claustrophobia.<ref name=\"Marriott1959\" /> Eleanor's role as an outcast was also emphasized. The character of Theodora was given a sharper, slightly more cruel sense of humor in order to make her a foil for Eleanor but also to heighten Eleanor's outsider status. The role of Luke became more flippant, and Dr. Markway (Montague in the novel) was made a more confident character.<ref name=\"Keesey\">{{cite web|author=Keesey, Pam |date=January 2002|url=http://www.monsterzine.com/200201/haunting.php|title= The Haunting and the Power of Suggestion: Why Robert Wise's Masterpiece Continues to Deliver the Goods to Modern Audiences|publisher=MonsterZine|accessdate=7 October 2012}}</ref> The screenplay was finished just after Wise completed work on ''West Side Story''.{{sfn|Bansak|1995|p=481}}\n\nWise approached [[United Artists]] with the project, but after much delay they turned him down. Wise's agent then suggested that, since Wise owed [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) a film under an old contract, Wise should take the project there. MGM agreed, but would only give Wise a $1 million budget. Wise knew he could not do the film at MGM's Culver City Studios (now the [[Sony Pictures Studios]]), so took it to England, as the [[Eady Levy]] gave tax breaks and financing to films made there as a way of subsidizing and promoting the British film industry.{{sfn|Bansak|1995|pp=481, 482}}  Someone suggested to Wise that he approach [[MGM-British Studios|MGM's Borehamwood Studios subsidiary]]. Wise had been asked to come to the United Kingdom for a [[Royal Command Performance]] of ''West Side Story'', and during the trip made the financing pitch to MGM Borehamwood.

But she also chose it because she had a long-standing interest in [[parapsychology]].<ref name=\"Sloane22\" /> English actress Claire Bloom was cast as Theo. In part, however, the decision to cast Bloom and Johnson was because of [[Eady Levy]] requirements that the cast be partly British.{{sfn|Morris|2009|p=58}} To make Bloom's character appear more bohemian, [[beatnik]] clothing designer [[Mary Quant]] was hired to design mod clothing specifically for the Theodora character.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/454500582.html?dids=454500582:454500582&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Dec+11%2C+1962&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=Julie+Harris+Seen+as+%27Haunting%27+Hit&pqatl=google |author=Scheuer, Philip K. |title=Julie Harris Seen as 'Haunting' Hit|newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=11 December 1962|accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]], under contract to MGM, was cast as Dr. Markway. Wise saw Johnson in a [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] production of ''[[The Devils (play)|The Devils]]''. Impressed with his acting, he offered him the role. Johnson later said he received invaluable film acting advice from Wise. Wise told him to keep his eyes steady, to blink less, and to try not to time his acting (Wise said he would take care of that in the editing room). Johnson also credited Wise with helping him to craft a much more natural acting performance.<ref name=\"Sloane22\" /> [[Russ Tamblyn]], also under contract to MGM, initially turned down the role as Luke because he felt that the character was \"a jerk\", although he thought that the script was very good. The studio forced him to reconsider, threatening him with suspension.<ref name=\"Marriott1959\" /> Tamblyn told the British cinema magazine ''Film Review'' in 1995 that while reading the script a second time, he realised the character was much more interesting. \"This is the ironic part,\" he said, \"it turned out to be one of my favourite films that I've been in!\"<ref name=\"Sloane22\" />\n\n[[Stunt performer]] Connie Tilton appears twice in the film.

''Cinefantastique'', 29:4/5 (October 1997), p. 141.</ref> The sets were designed to be brightly lit, with no dark corners or recesses, and decorated in a [[Rococo#Interior design|Rococo]] style. All rooms had ceilings to create a claustrophobic effect on film (this was unusual, as most film sets forgo ceilings to add in lighting and filming). Actor Richard Johnson said that the sets' eeriness created a \"subdued atmosphere\" among the cast and crew.<ref name=\"Marriott1959\" />\n\nWise says that his contract with MGM specified that the picture could only be shot in black-and-white, which Wise preferred for this genre of film.<ref name=\"Szebin\" /> He attempted to make Ettington Park look more sinister through various lighting effects and camera settings, but this failed.<ref name=\"Pressbook2\" /> Wise and Boulton then hit on the idea of using [[infrared film]] for establishing shots of the house. Infrared film stocks were quickly rushed to the location shoot from Belgium.<ref name=\"Pressbook2\" /> The new film worked. Wise felt the infrared film brought out the \"striations of the stone\" and made the mansion look like \"more of a monster house\".{{sfn|Rigby|2000|p=121}}<ref>[[#Silver|Silver and Wise 2002]], p. 133.</ref> Wise very much wanted to make ''The Haunting'' a tribute to [[Val Lewton]], the producer and writer under whom Wise had directed his first film (the supernatural horror picture ''[[Curse of the Cat People]]'').<ref name=\"Sloane23\" /> Wise says that Lewton's theory of horror was that people were more afraid of the unknown than things they could see. The decision to show little that was supernatural was made very early in the picture's pre-production.<ref name=\"Sloane24\" /> Wise and cinematographer Davis Boulton also wanted to make distances in the film (such as hallways) look longer and darker than the audience would anticipate. Wise approached the [[Panavision]] company, and wanted an [[Anamorphic format|anamorphic]], [[wide-angle lens]]. The only lens Panavision had was a 40mm. Wise learned that the company was working on a 30mm lens, but it contained distortions and was not ready. Wise kept pressing, and eventually Panavision turned over the 30mm lens on the condition that Wise signed a memorandum in which he acknowledged it was imperfect.<ref name=\"Leemann177\">[[#Wise|Wise and Leemann 1995]], p. 177.</ref> Wise and Boulton also planned shots that kept the camera moving, utilised low-angle shots, and incorporated unusual [[Panning (camera)|pans]] and [[tracking shot]]s. This led to some of the most active camera movements in Wise's film career.{{sfn|Busch|2010|p=41}} To accentuate the feeling that the house was alive, exterior shots were filmed so that the windows appeared to be eyes.<ref name=\"Sloane23\">[[#Sloane|Sloane 1995]], p. 23.</ref>\n\nDuring the shoot, Harris suffered from [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and believed that her co-stars did not take the film as seriously as she did.<ref>\"In Review: 'The Haunting'\". ''Cinefantastique''. 35:4 (2003), p. 68.</ref> At times, she would cry in her makeup chair prior to the day's shoot. The other actors remember her as being distant, not a part of their socializing and joking, and Harris did not speak to Bloom during filming, which puzzled Bloom. Afterward, Harris told Bloom that the lack of interaction had helped her build her own performance and the two women reconciled.<ref name=\"Marriott1959\" />  Harris incorporated her own depression into her performance. Wise heightened the sense of character conflict by having the characters \"step on one another's lines\", allowing one character to begin talking before the other had finished. On occasion, the characters simply talk at the same time.<ref name=\"Keesey\" />\n\nTo enhance the actors' performances during scenes in which they react to off-stage voices or sounds, Wise and his sound editors created a \"pre-scored\" soundtrack of voices and noises. These were played back during filming, and Wise says they greatly enhanced the acting performances.{{sfn|Bansak|1995|p=482}} Although some sounds were replaced during post-production, the \"pre-scored\" sounds were left on the soundtrack just as the actors heard them.{{sfn|Morris|2009|p=58}} Sound editors collected and created sounds in an empty manor house for a week to create the pre-score.<ref name=\"Pressbook2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/1560/The-Haunting/tcm-archives.html|title= How Do You Photograph Nothing? Robert Wise Finds the Unique Solution. ''The Haunting''|publisher=Pressbook. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1963, p. 2., via Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=7 October 2012}}</ref> Some of the sounds are very low in the bass range,{{sfn|Ahlzen|Song|2003|p=162}} which can cause physical sensations at high volume.\n\n===Effects and editing===\nThe film contains a number of [[special effect]]s, many of which were achieved in ways not immediately obvious to the viewer. In one scene, a supernatural force pushes against a large parlor door, bending it inward repeatedly. Though the door appears to some viewers to have been made of latex, it was in fact made of [[laminate]]d wood; the strange buckling was simply the result of a strong crew member pushing a piece of timber hard against it.{{sfn|Morris|2009|p=58}}\n\nTwo physical effects were used to make the spiral staircase in the library appear frightening. In one scene, the camera appears to ascend the staircase at a rapid rate. Wise achieved this effect by using the staircase's handrail as a makeshift [[Camera dolly|dolly track]]: a camera was attached to the rail and then slowly allowed to slide down (all the while being controlled by a wire so that its fall could be controlled). The sequence was then reversed and run at high speed, which gave the final cut an unworldly feel.<ref name=\"Leemann177\" /> In another scene, the staircase appears to become unstable and give way as Luke Sanderson ascends it. Later, Eleanor goes up the staircase in a trance-like state and is rescued by Dr. Markway, even as the staircase seems ready to collapse. The collapsing staircase effect was designed by a metalworker at the Borehamwood studios.<ref name=\"Sloane24\">[[#Sloane|Sloane 1995]], p. 24.</ref> The effect was created by tying portions of the steps and railing to a cable that ran inside the staircase's central support column. When the cable was slackened, elements of the stairway loosened up and moved freely. Conversely, when the cable was tightened, the staircase appeared solid and stable.<ref name=\"Marriott1959\" /> The effect disturbed the cast so much that Robert Wise had to ascend the staircase while it was shaking in order to prove that it was safe.<ref name=\"Sloane24\" />\n\nOther effects also relied on simple cinema tricks. Early in the film, the audience sees Abigail Crain lying in bed, aging from a young child to an old woman. A camera was fixed over the bed, and four different actresses (each a different age) posed in the bed beneath the camera. [[Dissolve (filmmaking)|Dissolves]] were then used to illustrate the aging process.<ref name=\"Sloane24\" /> In another scene, the characters come across a \"cold spot\" in the haunted mansion. Wise had initially wanted the actors to simply play up \"the 'quality of [being] cold' in [the] sequence\", but he quickly recognized that an additional visual effect was needed to more clearly emphasize the temperature drop.<ref name=\"Pressbook2\" /> To overcome the unique issue of having to \"photograph 'nothing'\", Wise instructed the makeup department to apply a special makeup onto the actors. This makeup contained a compound that was usually invisible to the naked eye but that appeared under certain filters. When it came time to film, the actors walked onto the portion of the set that was supposed to represent the cold spot, and these filters were gradually drawn over the set's lights. This gave the visual impression that the characters had turned pale due to a drop in temperature.<ref name=\"Pressbook2\" />\n\nThe camera work and editing work together to further heighten the frightening qualities of the film. Eleanor is often viewed from above, and in one scene the camera closes in so tightly on her that she is forced backward over a railing.<ref name=\"Marriott1959\" /> Eleanor's viewpoint is often juxtaposed with eerie views of the house, as if both viewpoints were the same.<ref name=\"Marriott1959\" /><ref name=\"Keesey\" /> Many of the editing choices in the film were also used to heighten the audience's discomfort. There are a number of rapid [[Cut (transition)|cuts]] in the film that throw off the viewer's sense of spatial orientation, and [[Dutch angle]]s are used to imply that reality is off-kilter. Likewise, [[cutting on action]]\u2014showing the characters exiting a room to the right, only to show them entering the next room from the left\u2014is often violated, so that the viewer cannot get a clear sense of which rooms and hallways are connected to one another.<ref name=\"Marriott1959\" /> The film also lacks temporal clues, and there are few shots in which the audience can see out a window to determine whether it is night or day. In other instances, windows are visible but do little to establish temporality: for instance, when Eleanor is rescued by Dr. Markway on the unstable spiral staircase, some of the windows nearby show strong sunlight streaming in, while others show darkness outside.<ref name=\"Marriott1959\" />\n\n''The Haunting'' is notable for its [[lesbian]] character, Theodora. Although the character's lesbianism is subtly mentioned in the novel, the film makes it explicit.{{sfn|Castle|1993|p=246, n. 15}} The film is also one of the few Hollywood motion pictures to depict a lesbian as feminine and not predatory.<ref>[[#White|White 1999]], p. 78-91.</ref> Theodora's lesbianism helps to create conflict in the picture. Had Theodora been heterosexual, Eleanor's growing attraction to Markway would not have threatened her. But with Theodora a clear lesbian, Markway becomes a threat that causes conflict between the psychic and the investigator.<ref name=\"Keesey\" /> Originally, Gidding's script had contained a scene early in the film in which Theodora is shown in her apartment in the city. It is clear from the context that she has just broken off with her female lover: \"I hate you\" is written on the mirror in lipstick. Theodora is yelling curses at her out the window and more. However, Wise decided to cut the scene, believing it to be too explicit for a film that worked hard to make things implicit.<ref name=\"Leemann177\" /><ref>Szebin, Frederick C. \"The Sound of Screaming\". ''Cinefantastique''. 29:4/5 (October 1997), p. 140.</ref> According to Harris, film censors demanded that Theo never be shown to touch Eleanor, in order to keep the lesbianism less obvious.<ref name=\"Sloane22\" />\n\n==Reception==\n''The Haunting'' was released on 18 September 1963. Audiences were frightened by it. Film critic Dora Jane Hamblin related how four of her female friends, expecting a ho-hum film, took out make-up during the film's first few minutes with the intention of fixing their faces. The film proved so frightening, she said, that the women were jumping out of their seats and losing their items.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GlIEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA40-IA2&ots=ROW67w8ijl&dq=%22The%20Haunting%22%20movie&pg=PA37#v=onepage&q=%22The%20Haunting%22%20movie&f=false Hamblin, Dora Jane. \"Great New Scary Film\"].

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the acting effective, Davis Boulton's cinematography extraordinarily dexterous and visually exciting, and Elliott Scott's production design of the \"monstrous\" house most decidedly the star of the film. However, the unnamed reviewer felt Gidding's screenplay had \"major shortcomings\" in that the plot was incomprehensible at points, and the motivation for the characters was poor.<ref>\"Film Reviews: 'The Haunting'\".

It stars [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]], [[Claire Bloom]], [[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]], and [[Russ Tamblyn]]. The film depicts the experiences of a small group of people invited by a [[paranormal]] investigator to investigate a purportedly [[haunted house]].\n\nScreenwriter Gidding, who had worked with director Wise on the film ''[[I Want to Live!]]'' (1958), began a six-month write of the script after reading the book, which Wise had given to him. He perceived the book to be more about mental breakdown than [[ghost]]s, and although he was informed after meeting author Shirley Jackson that it was very much a supernatural novel, elements of mental breakdown were introduced into the film. The film was shot at the [[MGM-British Studios]] near London, UK on a budget of US$1.05 million, with exteriors and the grounds shot at [[Ettington Park Hotel|Ettington Park]] (now the Ettington Park Hotel) in the village of [[Ettington]], [[Warwickshire]]. Julie Harris was cast by Wise, who found her ideal for the psychologically fragile Eleanor, though during production she suffered from depression and had an uneasy relationship with her co-stars. The interior sets were by [[Elliot Scott]], credited by Wise as instrumental in the making of ''The Haunting''. They were designed to be brightly lit, with no dark corners or recesses, and decorated in a [[Rococo#Interior design|Rococo]] style; all the rooms had ceilings to create a claustrophobic effect on film. Numerous devices and tricks were used in the filming. Wise used a 30mm [[Anamorphic format|anamorphic]], [[wide-angle lens]] [[Panavision]] camera that was not technically ready for use and caused distortions. It was only given to Wise on condition that he sign a memorandum in which he acknowledged that the lens was imperfect. Wise and cinematographer Davis Boulton planned sequences that kept the camera moving, utilizing low-angle takes, and incorporating unusual [[Panning (camera)|pans]] and [[tracking shot]]s.\n\nThe film was released on 18 September 1963. In 2010, ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper ranked it as the 13th-best horror film of all time. Director [[Martin Scorsese]] has placed ''The Haunting'' first on his list of the 11 scariest horror films of all time. ''The Haunting'' was released on [[DVD]] in its original screen format with commentary in 2003, and was released on [[Blu-ray]] on 15 October 2013. [[The Haunting (1999 film)|The film was remade in 1999]] by director [[Jan de Bont]], starring [[Liam Neeson]], [[Lili Taylor]], [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] and [[Owen Wilson]], but that version was heavily panned by critics and audiences.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=October 2019}}\nDr. John Markway narrates the history of the 90-year-old Hill House, which was constructed in [[Massachusetts]] by Hugh Crain as a home for his wife. She died when her carriage crashed against a tree as she approached the house for the first time. Crain remarried, but his second wife died in the house from a fall down the stairs. Crain's daughter Abigail lived in the house for the rest of her life, never moving out of the [[Nursery (room)|nursery]]. She died calling for her nurse-companion. The companion inherited the house, but later [[Suicide|hanged herself]] from a spiral staircase in the library. Hill House was eventually inherited by a Mrs. Sanderson, although it has stood empty for some time.\n\nMarkway wishes to study the reported paranormal activity at Hill House. He secures a lease from Mrs. Sanderson to occupy the mansion for the duration of his investigation; conditional to his acceptance is that he take Luke Sanderson, her heir, with him. Among several prospective choices only two individuals accept Markway\u2019s invitation to join the investigation\u2014a psychic, Theodora, also known as Theo, and the meek Eleanor Lance, who experienced [[poltergeist]] activity as a child. Eleanor spent her adult life caring for her invalid mother, whose recent death has left Eleanor with severe guilt.\n\nThe large, maze-like mansion's walls were constructed with angles slightly askew, resulting in off-center [[Perspective (visual)|perspectives]] and doors that open and close by themselves. The immense library contains the ramshackle spiral staircase from which the previous owner hanged herself; the vast [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatory]] is adorned with eerie statues. During their first night in the house, Eleanor and Theo are terrified by [[supernatural]] occurrences outside Theo's bedroom door. Deafening banging is heard against the door and the voice of a young girl is heard echoing with laughter. Despite the turbulence, Eleanor feels a tentative affinity to Hill House.\n\nThe team explores the house the next day, discovering a [[Cold spot (paranormal)|cold spot]] outside the nursery and encountering other supernatural phenomena. Markway reveals more about the hauntings that have allegedly occurred. Following another night of loud disturbances the team discovers the words \"HELP ELEANOR COME HOME\" scrawled on a wall, which causes Eleanor severe distress.\n\nThat night, Theo moves into Eleanor's room and they fall asleep in the same bed.  Eleanor is awakened by the sounds of a man speaking indistinctly and a woman laughing.  Fearful, Eleanor asks Theo to hold her hand and soon she feels a crushing grip. As Eleanor hears the sound of a young girl crying, she shouts at whoever is causing the child pain. Theo awakens with a start and turns on the light. Eleanor then sees that she has moved from the bed to the couch, and realizes that Theo was not the one she felt holding her hand.\n\nThe following day Dr. Markway's wife Grace arrives at Hill House to warn her husband that a reporter has learned of Markway's investigation of Hill House. Markway is concerned when Grace announces that she plans to join the group for the duration of the investigation. She demands a bed in the nursery despite her husband's warning that it is likely the center of the disturbances. That night the group experiences loud banging and an unseen force attempting to force its way through the living room in which they are staying.  The banging then proceeds to move its way up towards the nursery, where sounds of destruction are heard. This prompts Eleanor to run towards the source; however, Grace is nowhere to be found. Her disappearance is then confirmed the following  morning. Eleanor's mental instability worsens as she falls further under the spell of Hill House. She enters the library and climbs the dilapidated spiral staircase. Once she reaches the top, Grace appears unexpectedly at a trap door and the startled Eleanor nearly falls to her death. Markway rescues Eleanor but just misses seeing Grace, who has disappeared back into the house.\n\nMarkway becomes alarmed at Eleanor's obsession with Hill House in spite of the dangers it poses for her. Despite Eleanor's pleas to stay, Markway insists that she leave at once and asks Luke to accompany her home. Before he can join her in the car, Eleanor drives off and speeds down the road toward the front gates. She soon feels the steering wheel move by itself and the car advances erratically. At first she struggles to regain control but then surrenders to the unseen force. Suddenly Grace appears from behind a tree and steps in front of the car. Eleanor crashes into the tree and is killed. Luke observes it seemed that Eleanor deliberately aimed the car at the tree, but Markway asserts that something was in the car with her. He notes that the tree that claimed Eleanor's life is the same one that killed the first Mrs. Crain. Theo remarks that Eleanor got what she wanted\u2014to remain with the house.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]] as Eleanor \"Nell\" Lance\n*[[Claire Bloom]] as Theodora \"Theo\"\n*[[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]] as Dr. John Markway\n*[[Russ Tamblyn]] as Luke Sanderson\n*[[Fay Compton]] as Mrs. Sanderson\n*[[Rosalie Crutchley]] as Mrs. Dudley\n*[[Lois Maxwell]] as Grace Markway\n*[[Valentine Dyall]] as Mr. Dudley\n*[[Diane Clare]] as Carrie Fredericks\n*[[Ronald Adam (actor)|Ronald Adam]] as Eldridge Harper\n{{col-2}}\n;Uncredited roles\n*Pamela Buckley as First Mrs. Crain\n*Janet Mansell as 8-year-old Abigail Crain\n*[[Amy Dalby]] as 80-year-old Abigail Crain\n*Rosemary Dorken as Abigail Crain's Nurse-Companion\n*Verina Greenlaw as Dora Fredericks\n*Claude Jones as Garage Attendant\n*Freda Knorr as Second Mrs. Crain\n*[[Howard Lang]] as Hugh Crain\n*[[Paul Maxwell]] as Bud Fredericks\n*Susan Richards as Nurse\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Robert Wise]] was in post-production on ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'' when he read a review in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine of author [[Shirley Jackson]]'s novel, ''[[The Haunting of Hill House]]''.{{sfn|Rigby|2000|p=120}} Wise read the book and found it frightening; he passed it to screenwriter friend Nelson Gidding, with whom he had worked on the film ''[[I Want to Live!]]'' (1958).<ref name=\"Marriott1959\">[[#Marriott|Marriott 2012]], p. 1959</ref> Gidding did a full [[Film treatment|story treatment]] for Wise before proceeding to work on the adaptation.<ref name=\"Gidding65\" /> As Gidding crafted the screenplay, he came to believe that the novel was not a ghost story at all, but rather a compilation of the insane thoughts of the lead character, Eleanor Vance. He theorised that Vance was having a [[nervous breakdown]], envisaging a scenario in which Hill House is the hospital where she is held, Markway is her psychiatrist, the cold, banging, and violence are the results of [[Electroconvulsive therapy|shock treatment]], and the opening and closing of doors reflected the opening and closing of hospital doors.<ref>[[#Gidding|Gidding and Weaver 2001]], p. 64.</ref> Wise and Gidding traveled to [[Bennington, Vermont]] to meet Jackson, who told them that it was a good idea but that the novel was definitely about the supernatural.<ref>[[#Gidding|Gidding and Weaver 2001]], pp. 64-65.</ref> Nonetheless, elements of the insanity concept remained in the script, so that the audience was left wondering whether the supernatural events in the film were in Eleanor's mind or whether they were real.<ref name=\"Gidding65\">[[#Gidding|Gidding and Weaver 2001]], p. 65.</ref> It was also during their visit to speak with Jackson that Wise and Gidding chose the title for the film. As they did not want to keep the book title, they asked Jackson if she had considered an alternative title. She suggested ''The Haunting'', which Wise and Gidding immediately adopted.<ref name=\"Sloane22\">[[#Sloane|Sloane 1995]], p. 22.</ref>\n\n===Script===\nWriting the screenplay took about six months. During this period, Gidding worked alone, and although he passed some of his work to Wise to show him that work on the screenplay was progressing well, he and Wise did not otherwise collaborate on the screenplay.<ref name=\"Gidding65\" /> The screenplay made other changes to the story. The number of characters was cut down, the backstory was significantly shortened, most of the supernatural events depicted in the novel were kept off-screen, and the greater part of the action was set inside the house to heighten the audience's feeling of claustrophobia.<ref name=\"Marriott1959\" /> Eleanor's role as an outcast was also emphasized. The character of Theodora was given a sharper, slightly more cruel sense of humor in order to make her a foil for Eleanor but also to heighten Eleanor's outsider status. The role of Luke became more flippant, and Dr. Markway (Montague in the novel) was made a more confident character.<ref name=\"Keesey\">{{cite web|author=Keesey, Pam |date=January 2002|url=http://www.monsterzine.com/200201/haunting.php|title= The Haunting and the Power of Suggestion: Why Robert Wise's Masterpiece Continues to Deliver the Goods to Modern Audiences|publisher=MonsterZine|accessdate=7 October 2012}}</ref> The screenplay was finished just after Wise completed work on ''West Side Story''.{{sfn|Bansak|1995|p=481}}\n\nWise approached [[United Artists]] with the project, but after much delay they turned him down. Wise's agent then suggested that, since Wise owed [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) a film under an old contract, Wise should take the project there. MGM agreed, but would only give Wise a $1 million budget. Wise knew he could not do the film at MGM's Culver City Studios (now the [[Sony Pictures Studios]]), so took it to England, as the [[Eady Levy]] gave tax breaks and financing to films made there as a way of subsidizing and promoting the British film industry.{{sfn|Bansak|1995|pp=481, 482}}  Someone suggested to Wise that he approach [[MGM-British Studios|MGM's Borehamwood Studios subsidiary]]. Wise had been asked to come to the United Kingdom for a [[Royal Command Performance]] of ''West Side Story'', and during the trip made the financing pitch to MGM Borehamwood. They offered a budget of $1.050 million.{{sfn|Bansak|1995|pp=481, 482}} With the Eady Levy support, this allowed the film to go forward with production in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"Gidding65\" />\n\n===Casting===\nAlthough [[Susan Hayward]] was reported to be in the running for one of the two female leads, [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]] was chosen for the role of Eleanor Vance.<ref>[[#Gidding|Gidding and Weaver 2001]], p. 66.</ref> Wise had seen Harris on stage, and felt she was right for the part of the psychologically fragile Eleanor.<ref name=\"Marriott1959\" /> Harris agreed to do the film in part because the role was complex and the idea of the house taking over Eleanor's mind was interesting. But she also chose it because she had a long-standing interest in [[parapsychology]].<ref name=\"Sloane22\" /> English actress Claire Bloom was cast as Theo. In part, however, the decision to cast Bloom and Johnson was because of [[Eady Levy]] requirements that the cast be partly British.{{sfn|Morris|2009|p=58}} To make Bloom's character appear more bohemian, [[beatnik]] clothing designer [[Mary Quant]] was hired to design mod clothing specifically for the Theodora character.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/454500582.html?dids=454500582:454500582&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Dec+11%2C+1962&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=Julie+Harris+Seen+as+%27Haunting%27+Hit&pqatl=google |author=Scheuer, Philip K. |title=Julie Harris Seen as 'Haunting' Hit|newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=11 December 1962|accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]], under contract to MGM, was cast as Dr. Markway. Wise saw Johnson in a [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] production of ''[[The Devils (play)|The Devils]]''. Impressed with his acting, he offered him the role. Johnson later said he received invaluable film acting advice from Wise. Wise told him to keep his eyes steady, to blink less, and to try not to time his acting (Wise said he would take care of that in the editing room). Johnson also credited Wise with helping him to craft a much more natural acting performance.<ref name=\"Sloane22\" /> [[Russ Tamblyn]], also under contract to MGM, initially turned down the role as Luke because he felt that the character was \"a jerk\", although he thought that the script was very good. The studio forced him to reconsider, threatening him with suspension.<ref name=\"Marriott1959\" /> Tamblyn told the British cinema magazine ''Film Review'' in 1995 that while reading the script a second time, he realised the character was much more interesting. \"This is the ironic part,\" he said, \"it turned out to be one of my favourite films that I've been in!\"<ref name=\"Sloane22\" />\n\n[[Stunt performer]] Connie Tilton appears twice in the film. She portrays the death of the \"Second Mrs. Crain\" by flinging herself backward down a flight of stairs.<ref name=\"Pressbook2a\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/1560/The-Haunting/tcm-archives.html|title= \"Dying' Can Be A Living in Movies\".

All rooms had ceilings to create a claustrophobic effect on film (this was unusual, as most film sets forgo ceilings to add in lighting and filming). Actor Richard Johnson said that the sets' eeriness created a \"subdued atmosphere\" among the cast and crew.<ref name=\"Marriott1959\" />\n\nWise says that his contract with MGM specified that the picture could only be shot in black-and-white, which Wise preferred for this genre of film.<ref name=\"Szebin\" /> He attempted to make Ettington Park look more sinister through various lighting effects and camera settings, but this failed.<ref name=\"Pressbook2\" /> Wise and Boulton then hit on the idea of using [[infrared film]] for establishing shots of the house. Infrared film stocks were quickly rushed to the location shoot from Belgium.<ref name=\"Pressbook2\" /> The new film worked. Wise felt the infrared film brought out the \"striations of the stone\" and made the mansion look like \"more of a monster house\".{{sfn|Rigby|2000|p=121}}<ref>[[#Silver|Silver and Wise 2002]], p. 133.</ref> Wise very much wanted to make ''The Haunting'' a tribute to [[Val Lewton]], the producer and writer under whom Wise had directed his first film (the supernatural horror picture ''[[Curse of the Cat People]]'').<ref name=\"Sloane23\" /> Wise says that Lewton's theory of horror was that people were more afraid of the unknown than things they could see. The decision to show little that was supernatural was made very early in the picture's pre-production.<ref name=\"Sloane24\" /> Wise and cinematographer Davis Boulton also wanted to make distances in the film (such as hallways) look longer and darker than the audience would anticipate. Wise approached the [[Panavision]] company, and wanted an [[Anamorphic format|anamorphic]], [[wide-angle lens]]. The only lens Panavision had was a 40mm. Wise learned that the company was working on a 30mm lens, but it contained distortions and was not ready. Wise kept pressing, and eventually Panavision turned over the 30mm lens on the condition that Wise signed a memorandum in which he acknowledged it was imperfect.<ref name=\"Leemann177\">[[#Wise|Wise and Leemann 1995]], p. 177.</ref> Wise and Boulton also planned shots that kept the camera moving, utilised low-angle shots, and incorporated unusual [[Panning (camera)|pans]] and [[tracking shot]]s. This led to some of the most active camera movements in Wise's film career.{{sfn|Busch|2010|p=41}} To accentuate the feeling that the house was alive, exterior shots were filmed so that the windows appeared to be eyes.<ref name=\"Sloane23\">[[#Sloane|Sloane 1995]], p. 23.</ref>\n\nDuring the shoot, Harris suffered from [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and believed that her co-stars did not take the film as seriously as she did.<ref>\"In Review: 'The Haunting'\". ''Cinefantastique''. 35:4 (2003), p. 68.</ref> At times, she would cry in her makeup chair prior to the day's shoot. The other actors remember her as being distant, not a part of their socializing and joking, and Harris did not speak to Bloom during filming, which puzzled Bloom. Afterward, Harris told Bloom that the lack of interaction had helped her build her own performance and the two women reconciled.<ref name=\"Marriott1959\" />  Harris incorporated her own depression into her performance. Wise heightened the sense of character conflict by having the characters \"step on one another's lines\", allowing one character to begin talking before the other had finished. On occasion, the characters simply talk at the same time.<ref name=\"Keesey\" />\n\nTo enhance the actors' performances during scenes in which they react to off-stage voices or sounds, Wise and his sound editors created a \"pre-scored\" soundtrack of voices and noises. These were played back during filming, and Wise says they greatly enhanced the acting performances.{{sfn|Bansak|1995|p=482}} Although some sounds were replaced during post-production, the \"pre-scored\" sounds were left on the soundtrack just as the actors heard them.{{sfn|Morris|2009|p=58}} Sound editors collected and created sounds in an empty manor house for a week to create the pre-score.<ref name=\"Pressbook2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/1560/The-Haunting/tcm-archives.html|title= How Do You Photograph Nothing? Robert Wise Finds the Unique Solution. ''The Haunting''|publisher=Pressbook. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1963, p. 2., via Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=7 October 2012}}</ref> Some of the sounds are very low in the bass range,{{sfn|Ahlzen|Song|2003|p=162}} which can cause physical sensations at high volume.\n\n===Effects and editing===\nThe film contains a number of [[special effect]]s, many of which were achieved in ways not immediately obvious to the viewer. In one scene, a supernatural force pushes against a large parlor door, bending it inward repeatedly. Though the door appears to some viewers to have been made of latex, it was in fact made of [[laminate]]d wood; the strange buckling was simply the result of a strong crew member pushing a piece of timber hard against it.{{sfn|Morris|2009|p=58}}\n\nTwo physical effects were used to make the spiral staircase in the library appear frightening. In one scene, the camera appears to ascend the staircase at a rapid rate. Wise achieved this effect by using the staircase's handrail as a makeshift [[Camera dolly|dolly track]]: a camera was attached to the rail and then slowly allowed to slide down (all the while being controlled by a wire so that its fall could be controlled). The sequence was then reversed and run at high speed, which gave the final cut an unworldly feel.<ref name=\"Leemann177\" /> In another scene, the staircase appears to become unstable and give way as Luke Sanderson ascends it. Later, Eleanor goes up the staircase in a trance-like state and is rescued by Dr. Markway, even as the staircase seems ready to collapse. The collapsing staircase effect was designed by a metalworker at the Borehamwood studios.<ref name=\"Sloane24\">[[#Sloane|Sloane 1995]], p. 24.</ref> The effect was created by tying portions of the steps and railing to a cable that ran inside the staircase's central support column. When the cable was slackened, elements of the stairway loosened up and moved freely. Conversely, when the cable was tightened, the staircase appeared solid and stable.<ref name=\"Marriott1959\" /> The effect disturbed the cast so much that Robert Wise had to ascend the staircase while it was shaking in order to prove that it was safe.<ref name=\"Sloane24\" />\n\nOther effects also relied on simple cinema tricks. Early in the film, the audience sees Abigail Crain lying in bed, aging from a young child to an old woman. A camera was fixed over the bed, and four different actresses (each a different age) posed in the bed beneath the camera. [[Dissolve (filmmaking)|Dissolves]] were then used to illustrate the aging process.<ref name=\"Sloane24\" /> In another scene, the characters come across a \"cold spot\" in the haunted mansion. Wise had initially wanted the actors to simply play up \"the 'quality of [being] cold' in [the] sequence\", but he quickly recognized that an additional visual effect was needed to more clearly emphasize the temperature drop.<ref name=\"Pressbook2\" /> To overcome the unique issue of having to \"photograph 'nothing'\", Wise instructed the makeup department to apply a special makeup onto the actors. This makeup contained a compound that was usually invisible to the naked eye but that appeared under certain filters. When it came time to film, the actors walked onto the portion of the set that was supposed to represent the cold spot, and these filters were gradually drawn over the set's lights. This gave the visual impression that the characters had turned pale due to a drop in temperature.<ref name=\"Pressbook2\" />\n\nThe camera work and editing work together to further heighten the frightening qualities of the film. Eleanor is often viewed from above, and in one scene the camera closes in so tightly on her that she is forced backward over a railing.<ref name=\"Marriott1959\" /> Eleanor's viewpoint is often juxtaposed with eerie views of the house, as if both viewpoints were the same.<ref name=\"Marriott1959\" /><ref name=\"Keesey\" /> Many of the editing choices in the film were also used to heighten the audience's discomfort. There are a number of rapid [[Cut (transition)|cuts]] in the film that throw off the viewer's sense of spatial orientation, and [[Dutch angle]]s are used to imply that reality is off-kilter. Likewise, [[cutting on action]]\u2014showing the characters exiting a room to the right, only to show them entering the next room from the left\u2014is often violated, so that the viewer cannot get a clear sense of which rooms and hallways are connected to one another.<ref name=\"Marriott1959\" /> The film also lacks temporal clues, and there are few shots in which the audience can see out a window to determine whether it is night or day. In other instances, windows are visible but do little to establish temporality: for instance, when Eleanor is rescued by Dr. Markway on the unstable spiral staircase, some of the windows nearby show strong sunlight streaming in, while others show darkness outside.<ref name=\"Marriott1959\" />\n\n''The Haunting'' is notable for its [[lesbian]] character, Theodora. Although the character's lesbianism is subtly mentioned in the novel, the film makes it explicit.{{sfn|Castle|1993|p=246, n. 15}} The film is also one of the few Hollywood motion pictures to depict a lesbian as feminine and not predatory.<ref>[[#White|White 1999]], p. 78-91.</ref> Theodora's lesbianism helps to create conflict in the picture. Had Theodora been heterosexual, Eleanor's growing attraction to Markway would not have threatened her. But with Theodora a clear lesbian, Markway becomes a threat that causes conflict between the psychic and the investigator.<ref name=\"Keesey\" /> Originally, Gidding's script had contained a scene early in the film in which Theodora is shown in her apartment in the city. It is clear from the context that she has just broken off with her female lover: \"I hate you\" is written on the mirror in lipstick. Theodora is yelling curses at her out the window and more. However, Wise decided to cut the scene, believing it to be too explicit for a film that worked hard to make things implicit.<ref name=\"Leemann177\" /><ref>Szebin, Frederick C. \"The Sound of Screaming\". ''Cinefantastique''. 29:4/5 (October 1997), p. 140.</ref> According to Harris, film censors demanded that Theo never be shown to touch Eleanor, in order to keep the lesbianism less obvious.<ref name=\"Sloane22\" />\n\n==Reception==\n''The Haunting'' was released on 18 September 1963. Audiences were frightened by it. Film critic Dora Jane Hamblin related how four of her female friends, expecting a ho-hum film, took out make-up during the film's first few minutes with the intention of fixing their faces. The film proved so frightening, she said, that the women were jumping out of their seats and losing their items.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GlIEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA40-IA2&ots=ROW67w8ijl&dq=%22The%20Haunting%22%20movie&pg=PA37#v=onepage&q=%22The%20Haunting%22%20movie&f=false Hamblin, Dora Jane. \"Great New Scary Film\"]. ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''. 30 August 1963. Accessed 8 October 2012.</ref> In [[Houston]], [[Texas]], a local cinema promoted the film as so chilling that it held a contest to see which of four patrons could sit all the way through a midnight screening; the prize was $100.<ref>[[#Welling|Welling 2007]], p. 281.</ref> Despite these stunts, ''The Haunting'' was only an average success at the box office.{{sfn|Bansak|1995|p=479}}\n\n''The Haunting'' opened to mixed reception, the consensus generally being that it was a stylish film but had major flaws in the plot and lacked excitement. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the acting effective, Davis Boulton's cinematography extraordinarily dexterous and visually exciting, and Elliott Scott's production design of the \"monstrous\" house most decidedly the star of the film. However, the unnamed reviewer felt Gidding's screenplay had \"major shortcomings\" in that the plot was incomprehensible at points, and the motivation for the characters was poor.<ref>\"Film Reviews: 'The Haunting'\". ''Variety''. 31 December 1962.</ref> [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' cited ''The Haunting'' as \"one of the most highly regarded haunted house films ever produced\" but surmised that \"there is really no point to it\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A06E4D81431E73BBC4152DFBF668388679EDE|title=The Haunting (1963)|newspaper=The New York Times|date=19 September 1963|accessdate=12 September 2013}}</ref> Writing in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' magazine, critic [[Pauline Kael]] called the film \"moderately elegant and literate and expensive\", but criticised Russ Tamblyn for being \"feeble [and] cowardly-comic\".<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Kael, Pauline|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1964/11/are-movies-going-to-pieces/306083/|title=Are Movies Going to Pieces?|magazine= The Atlantic|date=November 1964|accessdate=12 September 2013}}</ref> She considered the film to be superior to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Birds (1963 film)|The Birds]]'', also released in 1963, yet didn't consider it to be a great film.{{sfn|Hawkins|2000|p=54}} Kael said of it, \"It wasn't a great movie but I certainly wouldn't have thought that it could offend anyone. Yet part of the audience at ''The Haunting'' wasn't merely bored, it was hostile\u2014as if the movie, by assuming interests they didn't have, made them feel resentful or inferior. I've never felt this in an audience toward crude, bad movies\u2026 But the few scattered people at ''The Haunting'' were restless and talkative, the couple sitting near me arguing\u2014the man threatening to leave, the woman assuring him that something would happen.

Between the long terminal repeats there are genes that can be transcribed equivalent to retrovirus genes [[Group specific antigen|gag]] and [[Pol_(HIV)|pol]]. These genes overlap so they encode a protease that processes the resulting transcript into functional gene products. Gag gene products associate with other retrotransposon transcripts to form virus-like particles. Pol gene products include enzymes reverse transcriptase, [[integrase]] and [[ribonuclease]] H domains.

Instead they have short repeats thats can have an inverted order of bases next to each other aside from [[Direct repeat|direct repeats]] found in LTR retrotransposons that is just one sequence of bases repeating itself. \n\nAlthough they are retrotransposons, they cannot carry out reverse transcription using an RNA transposition intermediate in the same way as LTR retrotransposons. Those two key components of the retrotransposon are still necessary but the way they are incorporated into the chemical reactions is different. This is because unlike LTR retrotransposons, non-LTR retrotransposons do not contain sequences that bind tRNA. \n\nThey mostly fall into two types - LINEs and SINEs. SVA elements are the exception between the two as they share similarities with both LINEs and SINEs, containing Alu elements and different numbers of the same repeat. SVAs are shorter than LINEs but longer than SINEs. \n\nWhile historically viewed as \"junk DNA\", research suggests in some cases, both LINEs and SINEs were incorporated into novel genes so as to evolve new functionality.<ref name=\"Santangelo\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Santangelo AM, de Souza FS, Franchini LF, Bumaschny VF, Low MJ, Rubinstein M | title = Ancient exaptation of a CORE-SINE retroposon into a highly conserved mammalian neuronal enhancer of the proopiomelanocortin gene | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 3 | issue = 10 | pages = 1813\u201326 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17922573 | pmc = 2000970 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0030166 }}</ref>\n\n===LINEs===\n{{Main article | Long interspersed nuclear element}}\n\nWhen a LINE is transcribed, the transcript contains an RNA polymerase II promoter that ensures LINEs can be copied into whichever location it decides to insert itself into.

This transcript is the RNA transposition intermediate.  \n\nThe RNA transposition intermediate moves from the nucleus into the cytoplasm for translation. This gives the two coding regions of a LINE that in turn binds back to the RNA it is transcribed from. The LINE RNA then moves back into the nucleus to insert into the eukaryotic genome. \n\nLINEs insert themselves into regions of the eukaryotic genome that are rich in bases AT. At AT regions LINE uses its nuclease to cut one strand of the eukaryotic double-stranded DNA. The adenine-rich sequence in LINE transcript base pairs with the cut strand to flag where the LINE will be inserted with hydroxyl groups. Reverse transcriptase recognises these hydroxyl groups to synthesise LINE retrotransposon where the DNA is cut. Like with LTR retrotransposons, this new inserted LINE contains eukaryotic genome information so it can be copied and pasted into other genomic regions easily. The information sequences are longer and more variable than those in LTR retrotransposons. \n\nMost LINE copies have variable length at the start because reverse transcription usually stops before DNA synthesis is complete. In some cases this causes RNA polymerase II promoter to be lost so LINEs cannot transpose further.<ref name=Singer>{{cite journal | vauthors = Singer MF | title = SINEs and LINEs: highly repeated short and long interspersed sequences in mammalian genomes | journal = Cell | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 433\u20134 | date = March 1982 | pmid = 6280868 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(82)90194-5 }}</ref>\n\n====Human L1====\n{{Main article | LINE1}}\n\nAmong the LINE, there are several subgroups, such as L1, L2 and L3.

SINEs cannot transpose by themselves because they cannot encode SINE transcripts. They usually consist of parts derived from tRNA and LINEs. The tRNA portion contains an RNA polymerase III promoter which the same kind of enzyme as RNA polymerase II. This makes sure the LINE copies would be transcriped into RNA for further transposition. The LINE component remains so LINE-binding proteins can recognise the LINE part of the SINE.\n\n====Alu elements====\nThe most common SINE in primates is [[Alu element|''Alu'']]. Alu elements are approximately 350 base pairs long, do not contain any coding sequences, and can be recognized by the [[restriction enzyme]] [[List of restriction enzyme cutting sites: A#Whole list navigation|AluI]] (hence the name). The distribution of these elements has been implicated in some genetic diseases and cancers. Copy and pasting Alu RNA requires the Alu\u2019s adenine-rich end and the rest of the sequence bound to a signal. The signal-bound Alu region can then associate with ribosomes. LINE RNA associates on the same ribosomes as the Alu elements. Binding to the same ribosome allows Alu elements of SINEs to interact with LINE. This simultaneous translation of Alu element and LINE allows SINE copy and pasting.\n\n==SVA elements==\nSVA elements are present at lower levels than SINES and LINEs in humans. The starts of SVA and Alu elements are similar, followed by repeats and an end similar to endogenous retrovirus. LINEs bind to sites flanking SVA elements to transpose them. SVA are one of the youngest transposable element in great apes genome and among the most active and polymorphic in the human population.\n\nA recent study developed a network method that reveals SVA retroelement (RE) proliferation dynamics in\nhominid genomes <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Levy OR, Knisbacher BA, Levanon EY, Havlin SH | title = Integrating networks and comparative genomics reveals retroelement proliferation dynamics in hominid genomes | journal = Science Advances | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | date = 2017 | pmid = 29043294| pmc = 5640379 | doi = 10.1126/sciadv.1701256 }}</ref>The method enable to track the course of SVA proliferation, identify yet unknown active communities, and detect tentative \u201cmaster REs\u201d that play key roles in SVA propagation. Thus, providing  support for the fundamental \u201cmaster gene\u201d model of RE proliferation.\n\n==Role in human disease==\nRetrotransposons ensure they are not lost by chance by occuring only in cell genetics that can be passed on from one generation to the next from parent gametes. However, LINEs can transpose into the human embryo cells that eventually develop into the nervous system, raising the question whether this LINE retrotransposition affects brain function. LINE retrotransposition is also a feature of several cancers, but it is unclear whether retrotransposition itself causes cancer instead of just a symptom.\nUncontrolled retrotransposition is bad for both the host organism and retrotransposons themselves so they have to be regulated. Retrotransposons are regulated by [[RNA interference]]. RNA interference is carried out by a bunch of short [[Non-coding_RNA|non-coding RNAs]]. The short non-coding RNA interacts with protein Argonaute to degrade retrotransposon transcripts and change their DNA histone structure to reduce their transcription.\n\n==Role in evolution==\nLTR retrotransposons came about later than non-LTR retrotransposons, possibly from an ancestral non-LTR retrotransposon acquiring an integrase from a DNA transposon. Retroviruses gained additional properties to their virus envelopes by taking the relevant genes from other viruses using the power of LTR retrotransposon.\n\nDue to their retrotransposition mechanism, retrotransposons amplify in number quickly, composing 40% of the human genome. The insertion rates for LINE1, Alu and SVA elements are 1/200 - 1/20, 1/20 and 1/900 respectively. The LINE1 insertion rates have varied a lot over the past 35 million years, so they indicate points in genome evolution. \n\nNotably a large number of 100 kilobases in the maize genome show variety due to the presence or absence of retrotransposons. However since maize is unusually genetically compared to other plants it cannot be used to predict retrotransposition in other plants.\n\nMutations caused by retrotransposons include:\n* Gene inactivation\n* Changing gene regulation\n* Changing gene products\n* Acting as DNA repair sites\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Transposon]]\n* [[Paleogenetics]]\n* [[Paleovirology]]\n* [[Insertion sequences]]\n* [[Copy-number variation]]\n* [[Genomic organization]]\n* [[Interspersed repeat]]\n* [[Retrotransposon marker]]s, a powerful method of reconstructing phylogenies.\n* [[RetrOryza]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Repeated sequence}}\n\n[[Category:Mobile genetic elements]]\n[[Category:Molecular biology]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Retrotransposons.png|right|Simplified representation of the life cycle of a retrotransposon|440px]]\n\n'''Retrotransposons''' (also called '''Class I transposable elements''' or '''transposons via RNA intermediates''') are a type of [[Gene|genetic]] component that copy and paste themselves into different genomic locations ([[transposon]]) by converting RNA back into DNA through the process [[reverse transcription]] using an RNA transposition intermediate.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dombroski BA, Feng Q, Mathias SL, Sassaman DM, Scott AF, Kazazian HH, Boeke JD | title = An in vivo assay for the reverse transcriptase of human retrotransposon L1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae | journal = Molecular and Cellular Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 7 | pages = 4485\u201392 | date = July 1994 | pmid = 7516468 | pmc = 358820 | doi = 10.1128/mcb.14.7.4485 }}</ref> \n\nThrough reverse transcription retrotransposons amplify themselves quickly to become abundant in eukaryotic genomes such as [[maize]] (49-78%) <ref name=\"SanMiguelandBennetzen\">{{cite journal |vauthors=SanMiguel P, Bennetzen JL |title=Evidence that a recent increase in maize genome size was caused by the massive amplification of intergene retrotranposons |journal=Annals of Botany |volume=82 |issue=Suppl A |pages=37\u201344 |year=1998 |url=http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/82/suppl_1/37.pdf |doi=10.1006/anbo.1998.0746}}</ref>and humans (42%).<ref name=\"Landeretal\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lander ES, Linton LM, Birren B, Nusbaum C, Zody MC, Baldwin J, etal | title = Initial sequencing and analysis of the human genome | journal = Nature | volume = 409 | issue = 6822 | pages = 860\u2013921 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11237011 | doi = 10.1038/35057062 }}</ref> They are only present in eukaryotes but share features with [[retrovirus|retroviruses]] such as [[HIV]].\n\nThere are two main types of retrotransposon, LTR and non-LTRs.

Because the retrotransposon contains eukaryotic genome information it can insert copies of itself into other genomic locations within a eukaryotic cell.\n\nLTR retrotransposons are sub-classified into the Ty1-''copia''-like ([[Pseudoviridae]]), Ty3-''gypsy''-like ([[Metaviridae]]), and BEL-Pao-like groups. Ty1-''copia'' and Ty3-''gypsy'' groups of retrotransposons are commonly found with up to a few million copies per [[haploid]] [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] in animals, fungi, protista, and plants genomes. BEL-Pao like elements have so far only been found in animals.<ref name=\"Copland\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Copeland CS, Mann VH, Morales ME, Kalinna BH, Brindley PJ | title = The Sinbad retrotransposon from the genome of the human blood fluke, Schistosoma mansoni, and the distribution of related Pao-like elements | journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 20 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15725362 | pmc = 554778 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2148-5-20 }}</ref><ref name=\"wicker\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wicker T, Sabot F, Hua-Van A, Bennetzen JL, Capy P, Chalhoub B, Flavell A, Leroy P, Morgante M, Panaud O, Paux E, SanMiguel P, Schulman AH | title = A unified classification system for eukaryotic transposable elements | journal = Nature Reviews.

RNA-binding protein binds RNA-transposition intermediate. Nucleases are enzymes that break phosphodiester bonds between nucleotides in nucleic acids. Instead they have short repeats thats can have an inverted order of bases next to each other aside from [[Direct repeat|direct repeats]] found in LTR retrotransposons that is just one sequence of bases repeating itself. \n\nAlthough they are retrotransposons, they cannot carry out reverse transcription using an RNA transposition intermediate in the same way as LTR retrotransposons. Those two key components of the retrotransposon are still necessary but the way they are incorporated into the chemical reactions is different. This is because unlike LTR retrotransposons, non-LTR retrotransposons do not contain sequences that bind tRNA. \n\nThey mostly fall into two types - LINEs and SINEs. SVA elements are the exception between the two as they share similarities with both LINEs and SINEs, containing Alu elements and different numbers of the same repeat. SVAs are shorter than LINEs but longer than SINEs. \n\nWhile historically viewed as \"junk DNA\", research suggests in some cases, both LINEs and SINEs were incorporated into novel genes so as to evolve new functionality.<ref name=\"Santangelo\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Santangelo AM, de Souza FS, Franchini LF, Bumaschny VF, Low MJ, Rubinstein M | title = Ancient exaptation of a CORE-SINE retroposon into a highly conserved mammalian neuronal enhancer of the proopiomelanocortin gene | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 3 | issue = 10 | pages = 1813\u201326 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17922573 | pmc = 2000970 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0030166 }}</ref>\n\n===LINEs===\n{{Main article | Long interspersed nuclear element}}\n\nWhen a LINE is transcribed, the transcript contains an RNA polymerase II promoter that ensures LINEs can be copied into whichever location it decides to insert itself into.

This transcript is the RNA transposition intermediate.  \n\nThe RNA transposition intermediate moves from the nucleus into the cytoplasm for translation. This gives the two coding regions of a LINE that in turn binds back to the RNA it is transcribed from. The LINE RNA then moves back into the nucleus to insert into the eukaryotic genome. \n\nLINEs insert themselves into regions of the eukaryotic genome that are rich in bases AT. At AT regions LINE uses its nuclease to cut one strand of the eukaryotic double-stranded DNA. The adenine-rich sequence in LINE transcript base pairs with the cut strand to flag where the LINE will be inserted with hydroxyl groups. Reverse transcriptase recognises these hydroxyl groups to synthesise LINE retrotransposon where the DNA is cut. Like with LTR retrotransposons, this new inserted LINE contains eukaryotic genome information so it can be copied and pasted into other genomic regions easily. The information sequences are longer and more variable than those in LTR retrotransposons. \n\nMost LINE copies have variable length at the start because reverse transcription usually stops before DNA synthesis is complete. In some cases this causes RNA polymerase II promoter to be lost so LINEs cannot transpose further.<ref name=Singer>{{cite journal | vauthors = Singer MF | title = SINEs and LINEs: highly repeated short and long interspersed sequences in mammalian genomes | journal = Cell | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 433\u20134 | date = March 1982 | pmid = 6280868 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(82)90194-5 }}</ref>\n\n====Human L1====\n{{Main article | LINE1}}\n\nAmong the LINE, there are several subgroups, such as L1, L2 and L3.

SINEs cannot transpose by themselves because they cannot encode SINE transcripts. They usually consist of parts derived from tRNA and LINEs. The tRNA portion contains an RNA polymerase III promoter which the same kind of enzyme as RNA polymerase II. This makes sure the LINE copies would be transcriped into RNA for further transposition. The LINE component remains so LINE-binding proteins can recognise the LINE part of the SINE.\n\n====Alu elements====\nThe most common SINE in primates is [[Alu element|''Alu'']]. Alu elements are approximately 350 base pairs long, do not contain any coding sequences, and can be recognized by the [[restriction enzyme]] [[List of restriction enzyme cutting sites: A#Whole list navigation|AluI]] (hence the name). The distribution of these elements has been implicated in some genetic diseases and cancers. Copy and pasting Alu RNA requires the Alu\u2019s adenine-rich end and the rest of the sequence bound to a signal. The signal-bound Alu region can then associate with ribosomes. LINE RNA associates on the same ribosomes as the Alu elements. Binding to the same ribosome allows Alu elements of SINEs to interact with LINE. This simultaneous translation of Alu element and LINE allows SINE copy and pasting.\n\n==SVA elements==\nSVA elements are present at lower levels than SINES and LINEs in humans. The starts of SVA and Alu elements are similar, followed by repeats and an end similar to endogenous retrovirus. LINEs bind to sites flanking SVA elements to transpose them. SVA are one of the youngest transposable element in great apes genome and among the most active and polymorphic in the human population.\n\nA recent study developed a network method that reveals SVA retroelement (RE) proliferation dynamics in\nhominid genomes <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Levy OR, Knisbacher BA, Levanon EY, Havlin SH | title = Integrating networks and comparative genomics reveals retroelement proliferation dynamics in hominid genomes | journal = Science Advances | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | date = 2017 | pmid = 29043294| pmc = 5640379 | doi = 10.1126/sciadv.1701256 }}</ref>The method enable to track the course of SVA proliferation, identify yet unknown active communities, and detect tentative \u201cmaster REs\u201d that play key roles in SVA propagation. Thus, providing  support for the fundamental \u201cmaster gene\u201d model of RE proliferation.\n\n==Role in human disease==\nRetrotransposons ensure they are not lost by chance by occuring only in cell genetics that can be passed on from one generation to the next from parent gametes. However, LINEs can transpose into the human embryo cells that eventually develop into the nervous system, raising the question whether this LINE retrotransposition affects brain function. LINE retrotransposition is also a feature of several cancers, but it is unclear whether retrotransposition itself causes cancer instead of just a symptom.\nUncontrolled retrotransposition is bad for both the host organism and retrotransposons themselves so they have to be regulated. Retrotransposons are regulated by [[RNA interference]]. RNA interference is carried out by a bunch of short [[Non-coding_RNA|non-coding RNAs]]. The short non-coding RNA interacts with protein Argonaute to degrade retrotransposon transcripts and change their DNA histone structure to reduce their transcription.\n\n==Role in evolution==\nLTR retrotransposons came about later than non-LTR retrotransposons, possibly from an ancestral non-LTR retrotransposon acquiring an integrase from a DNA transposon. Retroviruses gained additional properties to their virus envelopes by taking the relevant genes from other viruses using the power of LTR retrotransposon.\n\nDue to their retrotransposition mechanism, retrotransposons amplify in number quickly, composing 40% of the human genome. The insertion rates for LINE1, Alu and SVA elements are 1/200 - 1/20, 1/20 and 1/900 respectively. The LINE1 insertion rates have varied a lot over the past 35 million years, so they indicate points in genome evolution. \n\nNotably a large number of 100 kilobases in the maize genome show variety due to the presence or absence of retrotransposons. However since maize is unusually genetically compared to other plants it cannot be used to predict retrotransposition in other plants.\n\nMutations caused by retrotransposons include:\n* Gene inactivation\n* Changing gene regulation\n* Changing gene products\n* Acting as DNA repair sites\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Transposon]]\n* [[Paleogenetics]]\n* [[Paleovirology]]\n* [[Insertion sequences]]\n* [[Copy-number variation]]\n* [[Genomic organization]]\n* [[Interspersed repeat]]\n* [[Retrotransposon marker]]s, a powerful method of reconstructing phylogenies.\n* [[RetrOryza]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Repeated sequence}}\n\n[[Category:Mobile genetic elements]]\n[[Category:Molecular biology]]\n", "name_user": "Trappist the monk", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:cite repair;", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrotransposon"}

The film stars [[Josh O'Connor]] and [[Alec Sec\u0103reanu]]. The plot follows a young sheep farmer in [[Yorkshire]] whose life is transformed by a Romanian migrant worker. \n\nUpon release, the film received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised the performances (particularly O\u2019Connor's) and story, as well as commending it as a promising start for Lee. It was the only UK-based production to feature in the world drama category at the 2017 [[Sundance Film Festival]], where it won the world cinema directing award.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Yorkshire]], Johnny lives on the family farm with his father, Martin, and grandmother, Deirdre. Due to his father having suffered from a stroke, and his grandmother's age, much of the day-to-day running of the farm falls to Johnny. In his social time, Johnny engages in binge drinking and furtive sexual encounters with other men. Returning late to the farm after such an encounter with a young auctioneer, he is berated by his father because a calf has died from a [[breech birth]] in his absence.\n\nGheorghe, a Romanian migrant worker, is hired as extra help for the [[lambing season]]. He arrives and spends his first night in a caravan that the family has organised as his accommodation. As the [[Sheep|ewes]] have moved away from the main part of the farm, and as part of the farm's boundary wall remains unrepaired by Johnny, it is decided that Johnny and Gheorghe should spend several days camping nearer to the animals. When one of the ewes gives birth to an unconscious runt, Johnny is intrigued when Gheorghe is able to resuscitate and care for it. One morning, after Johnny refers to Gheorghe yet again as a \"[[gypsy]]\", Gheorghe tackles him to the ground and warns Johnny not to speak that way to him again.\n\nThe next day, the two men again engage in a fight which results in Johnny performing fellatio on Gheorghe and the two men have rough and passionate sex in the dirt. While Johnny initially does not acknowledge the encounter, the two share cigarettes and a sugar packet<ref>{{cite web\n | url =http://anthemmagazine.com/screen-test-alec-secareanu/\n | title =Screen Test: Alec Secareanu\n | last =Chang\n | first =Kee\n | date =26 October 2017\n | website =Anthem Magazine\n | publisher =\n | access-date =4 March 2018 | quote = \"We see that echoed around the campfire when he sneaks packets of sugar into his instant rice cups, right?

That night, Gheorghe resists Johnny's aggressive move to have sex, instead patiently showing him that sex can also be tender, and the two men kiss for the first time.\n\nReturning to the farm, Johnny invites Gheorghe to stay with him in the house, but Gheorghe elects to remain in the caravan. When Martin suffers a second stroke, Johnny realises that the running of the farm is now entirely his responsibility, and asks Gheorghe if he will stay with him. When Gheorghe expresses uncertainty over whether they can stay together and maintain the farm simultaneously, Johnny reacts poorly, drinking to excess and engaging in another random sexual encounter. When Gheorghe realises what Johnny has done, he abruptly leaves the farm.\n\nMartin is released from the hospital but is now fully debilitated. Johnny, desperate to make up with Gheorghe, tells his father that he will stay to run the farm, but that things must be run on his terms.

The film stars [[Josh O'Connor]] and [[Alec Sec\u0103reanu]]. The plot follows a young sheep farmer in [[Yorkshire]] whose life is transformed by a Romanian migrant worker. \n\nUpon release, the film received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised the performances (particularly O\u2019Connor\u2019s) and story, as well as commending it as a promising start for Lee. It was the only UK-based production to feature in the world drama category at the 2017 [[Sundance Film Festival]], where it won the world cinema directing award.\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Yorkshire]], Johnny lives on the family farm with his father, Martin, and grandmother, Deirdre. Due to his father having suffered from a stroke, and his grandmother's age, much of the day-to-day running of the farm falls to Johnny. In his social time, Johnny engages in binge drinking and furtive sexual encounters with other men. Returning late to the farm after such an encounter with a young auctioneer, he is berated by his father because a calf has died from a [[breech birth]] in his absence.\n\nGheorghe, a Romanian migrant worker, is hired as extra help for the [[lambing season]]. He arrives and spends his first night in a caravan that the family has organised as his accommodation. As the [[Sheep|ewes]] have moved away from the main part of the farm, and as part of the farm's boundary wall remains unrepaired by Johnny, it is decided that Johnny and Gheorghe should spend several days camping nearer to the animals. When one of the ewes gives birth to an unconscious runt, Johnny is intrigued when Gheorghe is able to resuscitate and care for it. One morning, after Johnny refers to Gheorghe yet again as a \"[[gypsy]]\", Gheorghe tackles him to the ground and warns Johnny not to speak that way to him again.\n\nThe next day, the two men again engage in a fight which results in Johnny performing fellatio on Gheorghe and the two men have rough and passionate sex in the dirt. While Johnny initially does not acknowledge the encounter, the two share cigarettes and a sugar packet<ref>{{cite web\n | url =http://anthemmagazine.com/screen-test-alec-secareanu/\n | title =Screen Test: Alec Secareanu\n | last =Chang\n | first =Kee\n | date =26 October 2017\n | website =Anthem Magazine\n | publisher =\n | access-date =4 March 2018 | quote = \"We see that echoed around the campfire when he sneaks packets of sugar into his instant rice cups, right? I thought it was drugs at first.\" \"Yes, it's sugar packets. That\u2019s what keeps him going.\"}}</ref> for their [[cup noodles]] throughout the day. That night, Gheorghe resists Johnny's aggressive move to have sex, instead patiently showing him that sex can also be tender, and the two men kiss for the first time.\n\nReturning to the farm, Johnny invites Gheorghe to stay with him in the house, but Gheorghe elects to remain in the caravan. When Martin suffers a second stroke, Johnny realises that the running of the farm is now entirely his responsibility, and asks Gheorghe if he will stay with him. When Gheorghe expresses uncertainty over whether they can stay together and maintain the farm simultaneously, Johnny reacts poorly, drinking to excess and engaging in another random sexual encounter. When Gheorghe realises what Johnny has done, he abruptly leaves the farm.\n\nMartin is released from the hospital but is now fully debilitated. Johnny, desperate to make up with Gheorghe, tells his father that he will stay to run the farm, but that things must be run on his terms. Martin gives his tacit approval to Johnny, who sets off to bring Gheorghe back to the farm. After he finds Gheorghe working in [[Scotland]], the two men reconcile. Gheorghe returns with Johnny; the caravan is taken away, and Gheorghe moves into the house.<ref name=\":TA:\">{{cite news|last1=Rahman|first1=Miran|title=Planned feature film could receive key funding support|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/11399303.Planned_feature_film_could_receive_key_funding_support/|accessdate=11 January 2017|work=Bradford Telegraph and Argus|date=9 August 2014}}</ref><ref name=\":BFI:\">{{cite web|title=British Council Film: God's Own Country|url=http://film.britishcouncil.org/gods-own-country|website=film.britishcouncil.org|publisher=British Film Council|accessdate=11 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast is listed alphabetically until film has been given a full release and the cast list is given -->\n* [[Josh O'Connor]] as Johnny Saxby\n* [[Alec Sec\u0103reanu]] as Gheorghe Ionescu\n* [[Ian Hart]] as Martin Saxby\n* [[Gemma Jones]] as Deirdre Saxby<ref>{{cite web|title=God's Own Country full cast and crew|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5635086/fullcredits|website=imdb.com|accessdate=11 January 2017|date=23 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe film is partly based on writer and director Francis Lee's own life, where he also had to make a decision to either stay and work on his family's farm or go off to drama school.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rosser|first1=Michael|title='God's Own Country' cast revealed as shoot begins|url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/gods-own-country-cast-revealed-as-shoot-begins/5101798.article#|website=screendaily.com|accessdate=11 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe film was shot in Yorkshire, specifically around the [[Silsden]] area of [[Keighley]] in [[West Yorkshire]],<ref name=\":TA:\" /> with some other scenes being shot in [[Keighley Bus Station]]<ref name=\":KN:\">{{cite news|last1=Knights|first1=David|title=New movie God's Own Country filmed at Keighley bus station|url=http://www.keighleynews.co.uk/news/14462790.New_movie_God_s_Own_Country_filmed_at_Keighley_bus_station/|accessdate=11 January 2017|work=Keighley News|date=29 April 2016}}</ref> and [[Airedale General Hospital]] with [[Haworth]] and [[Otley]] also featuring as backdrops for the film.<ref name=\":KN:\" />\n\nThe production was financed in part through the British Film Council's iFeature programme with additional funding being secured from Creative England.<ref name=\":BFI:\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on 23 January 2017.

The subjects were well-known courtesans, geisha, and others associated with the [[Yoshiwara]] pleasure districts of [[Edo]] (modern Tokyo).\n\nDue to legal restrictions, the names of the women appear do not appear in the prints.  To get around this, ''hanji-e'' picture-puzzles appear in the [[rebus]] in the top corner of each print; solving them reveals the names.  In 1796, the restrictions were tightened, and even the ''hanji-e'' were disallowed.  Thereafter, the prints were republished as '''''F\u016bry\u016b Rokkasen''''' ({{lang|ja|\u98a8\u6d41\u516d\u6b4c\u64b0}}, \"Elegant Six Immortal Poets\"), with the ''hanji-e'' replaced with pictures of the ''[[Rokkasen]]'' \"Six Immortal Poets\" of the 9th century.\n\n==Background==\n\n[[Ukiyo-e]] art flourished in Japan during the [[Edo period]] from the 17th to 19th centuries, and took as its primary subjects [[oiran|courtesans]], [[kabuki]] actors, and others associated with the \"floating world\" lifestyle of the [[Y\u016bkaku|pleasure districts]].  Alongside paintings, mass-produced [[Woodblock printing|woodblock prints]] were a major form of the genre.{{sfn|Fitzhugh|1979|p=27}}  In the mid-18th century full-colour ''{{transl|ja|nishiki-e}}'' prints became common, printed using a large number of woodblocks, one for each colour.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=80\u201383}}  A prominent genre was ''{{transl|ja|[[bijin-ga]]}}'' (\"pictures of beauties\"), which depicted most often [[Oiran|courtesans]] and [[geisha]] at leisure, and promoted the entertainments of the pleasure districts.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=60}}\n\n[[Kitagawa Utamaro]] ({{circa|1753}}\u20131806) made his name in the 1790s with his ''bijin [[\u014dkubi-e]]'' (\"large-headed pictures of beautiful women\") portraits, focusing on the head and upper torso, a style others had previously employed in portraits of kabuki actors.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=87\u201388}}  Utamaro experimented with line, colour, and printing techniques to bring out subtle differences in the features, expressions, and backdrops of subjects from a wide variety of class and background.  Utamaro's individuated beauties were in sharp contrast to the stereotyped, idealized images that had been the norm.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=88}}\n\n==Publication==\n\nThe six prints are multicolour ''[[nishiki-e]]'' prints in ''[[\u014dban]]'' size (about {{convert|38|x|25|cm|in|disp=comma|abbr=on|0}}).

[[ukiyo-e]] prints designed by the Japanese artist [[Utamaro]] and published in {{circa|1795\u201396}}.  The subjects were well-known courtesans, geisha, and others associated with the [[Yoshiwara]] pleasure districts of [[Edo]] (modern Tokyo).\n\nDue to legal restrictions, the names of the women appear do not appear in the prints.  To get around this, ''hanji-e'' picture-puzzles appear in the [[rebus]] in the top corner of each print; solving them reveals the names.  In 1796, the restirctions were tightened, and even the ''hanji-e'' were disallowed.  Thereafter, the prints were republished as '''''F\u016bry\u016b Rokkasen''''' ({{lang|ja|\u98a8\u6d41\u516d\u6b4c\u64b0}}, \"Elegant Six Immortal Poets\"), with the ''hanji-e'' replaced with pictures of the ''[[Rokkasen]]'' \"Six Immortal Poets\" of the 9th century.\n\n==Background==\n\n[[Ukiyo-e]] art flourished in Japan during the [[Edo period]] from the 17th to 19th centuries, and took as its primary subjects [[oiran|courtesans]], [[kabuki]] actors, and others associated with the \"floating world\" lifestyle of the [[Y\u016bkaku|pleasure districts]].  Alongside paintings, mass-produced [[Woodblock printing|woodblock prints]] were a major form of the genre.{{sfn|Fitzhugh|1979|p=27}}  In the mid-18th century full-colour ''{{transl|ja|nishiki-e}}'' prints became common, printed using a large number of woodblocks, one for each colour.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=80\u201383}}  A prominent genre was ''{{transl|ja|[[bijin-ga]]}}'' (\"pictures of beauties\"), which depicted most often [[Oiran|courtesans]] and [[geisha]] at leisure, and promoted the entertainments of the pleasure districts.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=60}}\n\n[[Kitagawa Utamaro]] ({{circa|1753}}\u20131806) made his name in the 1790s with his ''bijin [[\u014dkubi-e]]'' (\"large-headed pictures of beautiful women\") portraits, focusing on the head and upper torso, a style others had previously employed in portraits of kabuki actors.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=87\u201388}}  Utamaro experimented with line, colour, and printing techniques to bring out subtle differences in the features, expressions, and backdrops of subjects from a wide variety of class and background.  Utamaro's individuated beauties were in sharp contrast to the stereotyped, idealized images that had been the norm.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=88}}\n\n==Publication==\n\nThe six prints are multicolour ''[[nishiki-e]]'' prints in ''[[\u014dban]]'' size (about {{convert|38|x|25|cm|in|disp=comma|abbr=on|0}}).  They were published in {{circa|1796}} by {{illm|\u014cmiya Gonkur\u014d|ja|\u8fd1\u6c5f\u5c4b\u6a29\u4e5d\u90ce}}.{{sfn|Yamaguchi|1991|p=49}}  Retitled versions of the prints appeared in a later series titled ''F\u016bry\u016b Rokkasen'' ({{lang|ja|\u98a8\u6d41\u516d\u6b4c\u64b0}}, \"Elegant Six Immortal Poets\").{{sfn|Michener|1983|p=334}}\n\n==Description and analysis==\n\nThe series depicts six well-known beauties associated with the [[Yoshiwara]] pleasure districts\u2014courtesans, geisha, and the like.{{sfn|\u014ckubo|2016|p=51}}  A [[rebus]] appears in the corner of each print bearing the title ''K\u014dmei Bijin Rokkasen'' ({{lang|ja|\u9ad8\u540d\u7f8e\u4eba\u516d\u5bb6\u64b0}}, \"Renowned Beauties from the Six Best Houses\"){{sfn|Yamaguchi|1991|p=49}} and a ''[[hanji-e]]''{{efn|{{lang|ja|\u5224\u3058\u7d75}} ''{{transl|ja|hanji-e}}''}} picture-puzzle.{{sfn|Kobayashi|2006|p=12}}  This was done in response to a shogunal edict of 1793 (one of the [[Kansei Reforms]]) that banned the inscription of names on ukiyo-e prints.{{sfn|Yamaguchi|1991|p=49}}  To get around this restriction\u2014and perhaps to add the pleasure of a puzzle for viewers to solve{{sfn|Kobayashi|2000|p=17}}\u2014Utamaro resorted to ''hanji-e'' to symbolize the name of the model.  The restrictions expanded to include even these measures in 1796.{{efn|This restriction came into effect in the eight month of Kansei 8 on the [[Japanese calendar]].{{sfn|Yamaguchi|1991|p=49}} }}{{sfn|Yamaguchi|1991|p=49}}\n\nIn ''F\u016bry\u016b Rokkasen'' the ''hanji-e'' is replaced with the seated figure of one of the ''[[rokkasen]]'' \"six poetry immortals\" of the mid-9th century.{{sfn|Yamaguchi|1991|p=49}}  ''Rokkasen'' is spelled with different ''kanji'' characters in the two series; the earlier is a parody of the latter, which is derived from the original ''kanji'' characters for the  ''rokkasen'' poets.  Both series were published by [[\u014cmiya Kenkura]] and are signed ''Utamaro hitsu'' ({{lang|ja|\u6b4c\u9ebf\u7b46}}).  Estimated publication dates range from 1794 to 1798.{{sfn|Michener|1983|p=334}}\n\nOther minor differences in printed copies exist\u2014the print of O-Kita, for example, has editions with and without the seal ''saishutsu'' ({{lang|ja|\u518d\u51fa}}, \"re-appearance\") on it, and there are editions of both Hinodeya goke and O-Hisa with eyebrows<!-- Velez collection France --> and with the eyebrows shaved off<!-- Tokyo National Library -->.{{sfn|Yamaguchi|1991|p=49}}\n\n===Naniwaya O-Kita===\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"300\" caption=\"\">\nUtamaro (1795\u201396) K\u014dmei bijin rokkasen - Naniwaya O-Kita.jpg|''K\u014dmei Bijin Rokkasen'' version\nUtamaro (1790s) F\u016bry\u016b Rokkasen - Naniwaya O-Kita.jpg|''F\u016bry\u016b Rokkasen'' version, matching O-Kita with the poet [[Ariwara no Narihira]]\n</gallery>\n\nUtamaro depicts the popular teahouse girl O-Kita of the Naniwaya ({{lang|ja|\u96e3\u6ce2\u5c4b\u304a\u304d\u305f}}) when she was about 18<!-- \u5341\u4e5d\u6b73 by Eastern age reckoning -->.
