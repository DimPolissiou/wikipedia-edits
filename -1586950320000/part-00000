It was fought between the invading forces of the first [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Babur]] and the [[Rajput|Rajput forces]] led by [[Rana Sanga]] of [[Mewar]], after the [[Battle of Panipat (1526)|Battle of Panipat]]. The victory in the battle consolidated the new Mughal dynasty in India.<ref>An Advanced History of India, Dr K.K.Datta, p. 429.</ref>\n\n==Background==\nUntil 1524, [[Babur]]s aim was to only expand his rule to [[Punjab region|Punjab]], mainly to fulfill the legacy of his ancestor Timur, since it used to be part of his empire.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|pp=27\u201329}} Major parts of north India were under the rule of [[Ibrahim Lodi]] of the [[Lodi dynasty]], but the empire was crumbling and there were many defectors. He received invitations from Daulat Khan Lodi, Governor of [[Punjab]] and Ala-ud-Din, uncle of Ibrahim to invade the Delhi Sultanate. The Rajput ruler [[Rana Sanga]] upon knowing of Baburs invasion had also sent an ambassador to Babur at Kabul, offering to join in Babur's attack on Sultan [[Ibrahim Lodi]]. Sanga had offered to attack [[Agra]] while Babur would be attacking [[Delhi]]. [[Ibrahim Lodi]] was defeated in the [[First Battle of Panipat]], Babur completely destroyed the Lodi army in the battle and killed the Sultan, while losing a few hundred in the conflict.<ref name=\"RSCHMI\">{{cite book|last=Chaurasia|first=Radhey Shyam|title=History of medieval India : from 1000 A.D. to 1707 A.D.|year=2002|publisher=Atlantic Publ.|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-269-0123-3|pages=89\u201390|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8XnaL7zPXPUC&lpg=PA89&dq=babur%20receiving%20invitations%20from%20Daulat%20Khan%20Lodi&pg=PA89#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> However, while Babur did attack Lodi and took over Delhi and Agra, Sanga made no move, apparently having changed his mind. Babur had resented this backsliding; in his autobiography, Babur accuses Rana Sanga of breach of the agreement. Historian [[Satish Chandra (historian)|Satish Chandra]] speculates that Sanga may have imagined a long, drawn-struggle taking place between Babur and Lodi, following which he would be able to take control of the regions he coveted. Alternatively, writes Chandra, Sanga may have thought that in the event of a Mughal victory, Babur would withdraw from [[Delhi]] and [[Agra]], like [[Timur]], once he had seized the treasures of these cities. Once he realized that Babur intended to stay on in India, Sanga proceeded to build a grand coalition that would either force Babur out of India or confine him to Afghanistan. In early 1527 Babur started receiving reports of Sanga's advance towards Agra.{{sfn|Chandra|2006|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n==Initial skirmishes==\nAfter the [[First Battle of Panipat]], Babur had recognized that his primary threat came from two allied quarters: Rana Sanga and the Afghans ruling eastern India at the time. In a council that Babur called, it was decided that the Afghans represented the bigger threat, and consequently [[Humayun]] was sent at the head of an army to fight the Afghans in the east. However, upon hearing of Rana Sanga's advancement on Agra, Humayun was hastily recalled. Military detachments were then sent by Babur to conquer Dholpur, Gwaliar and Bayana, strong forts forming the outer boundaries of Agra. The commanders of Dholpur and Gwalior surrendered their forts to Babur, accepting his generous terms. However, Nizam Khan, the commander of Bayana, opened negotiations with both Babur and Afghans. The force sent by Babur to Bayana was defeated and dispersed by Rana Sanga.{{sfn|Chandra|2006|p=33}}\n\n==Rajput-Afghan alliance against Babur==\nRana Sanga had succeeded in building a formidable military alliance against Babur. He was joined by virtually all the leading Rajput kings from Rajasthan, including those from Harauti, Jalor, Sirohi, Dungarpur and Dhundhar. [[Ganga Rathore of Marwar|Rao Ganga]] of Marwar did not join personally but sent a contingent on his behalf led by his son Maldev Rathore. Rao Medini Rai of Chanderi in Malwa also joined the alliance. Further, Mahmud Lodi, the younger son of Sikandar Lodi, whom the Afghans had proclaimed their new sultan also joined the alliance with a force of 10,000 Afghans with him. Khanzada Hasan Khan Mewati, the ruler of Mewat, also joined the alliance with a force of 12,000. Babur denounced the Afghans who joined the alliance against him as ''kafirs'' and ''murtads'' (those who had apostatized from Islam). Chandra also argues that the alliance weaved together by Sanga represented a Rajput-Afghan alliance with the proclaimed mission of expelling Babur and restoring the Lodi empire.{{sfn|Chandra|2006|p=34}}\n\n==Babur rallies his troops==\nAccording to Babur, Rana Sanga's army consisted of 200,000 soldiers. However, according to Alexander Kinloch, this is an exaggeration as the Rajput army did not exceed 40,000 men during the campaign in Gujarat.<ref>8 Chaturkula Charitra, p. 25</ref> Even if this figure is exaggerated, Chandra comments that it is indisputable that Sanga's army greatly outnumbered Babur's forces.{{sfn|Chandra|2006}} The greater numbers and reported courage of the Rajputs served to instil fear in Babur's army. An astrologer added to the general unease by his foolish predictions. To raise the flagging morale of his soldiers, Babur gave a religious colour to the battle against Hindus. Babur proceeded to renounce future consumption of wine, broke his drinking cups, poured out all the stores of liquor on the ground and promulgated a pledge of total abstinence.{{sfn|Chandra|2006|p=34}} In his autobiography, Babur writes that: {{quote|It was a really good plan, and it had a favourable propagandistic effect on friend and foe.<ref name=\"baburnama\">{{cite book |title=The Baburnama: Memoirs of Babur, Prince and Emperor |publisher=Modern Library |isbn=0-375-76137-3 |year=2002 |author=Babur, Emperor of Hindustan |others=translated, edited and annotated by W. M. Thackston |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/babarinizam00babu }}</ref>}}\n\n==The battle==\nThe Battle of Khanwa took place at Khanwa, near [[Fatehpur Sikri|Fatehpur-Sikri]], on 16 March 1527. Before the battle, Babur had carefully inspected the site. Like in Panipat, he strengthened his front by procuring carts that were fastened by iron chains (not leather straps, as at Panipat) in the Ottoman fashion. These were used for providing shelter to horses and for storing artillery. Gaps between the carts were used for horsemen to charge at the opponent at an opportune time. To lengthen the line, ropes made of rawhide were placed over wheeled wooden tripods. Behind the tripods, matchlock men were placed who could fire and, if required, advance. The flanks were given protection by digging ditches. In addition to the regular force, small contingents were kept apart on the left flank and in front for the ''tulghuma'' (flanking) tactic. Thus, a strong offensive-defensive formation had been prepared by Babur. Rana Sanga, fighting in a traditional way, attacked the Mughal army's flanks. He was prevented from breaking through by reinforcements dispatched by Babur. Once the advance of the Rajputs and their Afghan allies had been contained, Babur's flanking tactic came into play. The carts and matchlock men were ordered to advance, hemming in the Rajputs and their allies. At about this time [[Silhadi]] of Raisen deserted the Ranas army and went over to [[Babur]]'s. Despite putting up a gallant fight, Rana Sanga and his allies suffered a disastrous defeat. Following his victory, Babur ordered a tower of enemy skulls to be erected, a practice formulated by [[Timur]] against his adversaries, irrespective of their religious beliefs. According to Chandra, the objective of constructing a tower of skulls was not just to record a great victory, but also to terrorize opponents. Earlier, the same tactic had been used by Babur against the Afghans of Bajaur.{{sfn|Chandra|2006}}{{page needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Battle of Khanwa demonstrated that Rajput bravery was not enough to counter Babur's superior generalship and organizational skills. Babur himself commented: {{Quote|Swordsmen though some Hindustanis maybe, most of them are ignorant and unskilled in military move and stand, in soldierly counsel and procedure.}}{{sfn|Chandra|2006|p=35}}\n\nRana Sanga managed to evade capture and escape to Chittor, but the grand alliance he had built collapsed. Quoting [[L. F. Rushbrook Williams|Rushbrook Williams]], Chandra writes: {{Quote|The powerful confederacy which depended so largely for its unity upon the strength and reputation of Mewar, was shattered by a single defeat and ceased henceforth to be a dominant factor in the politics of Hindustan.}}{{sfn|Chandra|2006}}\n\nOn 30 January 1528 Rana Sanga died in Chittor, apparently poisoned by his own chiefs, who held his plans of renewing the fight with Babur to be suicidal.{{sfn|Chandra|2006}}\n\nIt is suggested that had it not been for the cannon of Babur, Rana Sanga might have achieved victory.

It was fought between the invading forces of the first [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Babur]] and the [[Rajput|Rajput forces]] led by [[Rana Sanga]] of [[Mewar]], after the [[Battle of Panipat (1526)|Battle of Panipat]]. The victory in the battle consolidated the new Mughal dynasty in India.<ref>An Advanced History of India, Dr K.K.Datta, p. 429.</ref>\n\n==Background==\nUntil 1524, [[Babur]]s aim was to only expand his rule to [[Punjab region|Punjab]], mainly to fulfill the legacy of his ancestor Timur, since it used to be part of his empire.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|pp=27\u201329}} Major parts of north India were under the rule of [[Ibrahim Lodi]] of the [[Lodi dynasty]], but the empire was crumbling and there were many defectors. He received invitations from Daulat Khan Lodi, Governor of [[Punjab]] and Ala-ud-Din, uncle of Ibrahim to invade the Delhi Sultanate. The Rajput ruler [[Rana Sanga]] upon knowing of Baburs invasion had also sent an ambassador to Babur at Kabul, offering to join in Babur's attack on Sultan [[Ibrahim Lodi]]. Sanga had offered to attack [[Agra]] while Babur would be attacking [[Delhi]]. [[Ibrahim Lodi]] was defeated in the [[First Battle of Panipat]], Babur completely destroyed the Lodi army in the battle and killed the Sultan, while losing a few hundred in the conflict.<ref name=\"RSCHMI\">{{cite book|last=Chaurasia|first=Radhey Shyam|title=History of medieval India : from 1000 A.D. to 1707 A.D.|year=2002|publisher=Atlantic Publ.|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-269-0123-3|pages=89\u201390|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8XnaL7zPXPUC&lpg=PA89&dq=babur%20receiving%20invitations%20from%20Daulat%20Khan%20Lodi&pg=PA89#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> However, while Babur did attack Lodi and took over Delhi and Agra, Sanga made no move, apparently having changed his mind. Babur had resented this backsliding; in his autobiography, Babur accuses Rana Sanga of breach of the agreement. Historian [[Satish Chandra (historian)|Satish Chandra]] speculates that Sanga may have imagined a long, drawn-struggle taking place between Babur and Lodi, following which he would be able to take control of the regions he coveted. Alternatively, writes Chandra, Sanga may have thought that in the event of a Mughal victory, Babur would withdraw from [[Delhi]] and [[Agra]], like [[Timur]], once he had seized the treasures of these cities. Once he realized that Babur intended to stay on in India, Sanga proceeded to build a grand coalition that would either force Babur out of India or confine him to Afghanistan. In early 1527 Babur started receiving reports of Sanga's advance towards Agra.{{sfn|Chandra|2006|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n==Initial skirmishes==\nAfter the [[First Battle of Panipat]], Babur had recognized that his primary threat came from two allied quarters: Rana Sanga and the Afghans ruling eastern India at the time. In a council that Babur called, it was decided that the Afghans represented the bigger threat, and consequently [[Humayun]] was sent at the head of an army to fight the Afghans in the east. However, upon hearing of Rana Sanga's advancement on Agra, Humayun was hastily recalled. Military detachments were then sent by Babur to conquer Dholpur, Gwaliar and Bayana, strong forts forming the outer boundaries of Agra. The commanders of Dholpur and Gwalior surrendered their forts to Babur, accepting his generous terms. However, Nizam Khan, the commander of Bayana, opened negotiations with both Babur and Afghans. The force sent by Babur to Bayana was defeated and dispersed by Rana Sanga.{{sfn|Chandra|2006|p=33}}\n\n==Rajput-Afghan alliance against Babur==\nRana Sanga had succeeded in building a formidable military alliance against Babur. He was joined by virtually all the leading Rajput kings from Rajasthan, including those from Harauti, Jalor, Sirohi, Dungarpur and Dhundhar. [[Ganga Rathore of Marwar|Rao Ganga]] of Marwar did not join personally but sent a contingent on his behalf led by his son Maldev Rathore. Rao Medini Rai of Chanderi in Malwa also joined the alliance. Further, Mahmud Lodi, the younger son of Sikandar Lodi, whom the Afghans had proclaimed their new sultan also joined the alliance with a force of 10,000 Afghans with him. Khanzada Hasan Khan Mewati, the ruler of Mewat, also joined the alliance with a force of 12,000. Babur denounced the Afghans who joined the alliance against him as ''kafirs'' and ''murtads'' (those who had apostatized from Islam). Chandra also argues that the alliance weaved together by Sanga represented a Rajput-Afghan alliance with the proclaimed mission of expelling Babur and restoring the Lodi empire.{{sfn|Chandra|2006|p=34}}\n\n==Babur rallies his troops==\nAccording to Babur, Rana Sanga's army consisted of 200,000 soldiers. However, according to Alexander Kinloch, this is an exaggeration as the Rajput army did not exceed 40,000 men during the campaign in Gujarat.<ref>8 Chaturkula Charitra, p. 25</ref> Even if this figure is exaggerated, Chandra comments that it is indisputable that Sanga's army greatly outnumbered Babur's forces.{{sfn|Chandra|2006}} The greater numbers and reported courage of the Rajputs served to instil fear in Babur's army. An astrologer added to the general unease by his foolish predictions. To raise the flagging morale of his soldiers, Babur gave a religious colour to the battle against Hindus. Babur proceeded to renounce future consumption of wine, broke his drinking cups, poured out all the stores of liquor on the ground and promulgated a pledge of total abstinence.{{sfn|Chandra|2006|p=34}} In his autobiography, Babur writes that: {{quote|It was a really good plan, and it had a favourable propagandistic effect on friend and foe.<ref name=\"baburnama\">{{cite book |title=The Baburnama: Memoirs of Babur, Prince and Emperor |publisher=Modern Library |isbn=0-375-76137-3 |year=2002 |author=Babur, Emperor of Hindustan |others=translated, edited and annotated by W. M. Thackston |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/babarinizam00babu }}</ref>}}\n\n==The battle==\nThe Battle of Khanwa took place at Khanwa, near [[Fatehpur Sikri|Fatehpur-Sikri]], on 16 March 1527. Before the battle, Babur had carefully inspected the site. Like in Panipat, he strengthened his front by procuring carts that were fastened by iron chains (not leather straps, as at Panipat) in the Ottoman fashion. These were used for providing shelter to horses and for storing artillery. Gaps between the carts were used for horsemen to charge at the opponent at an opportune time. To lengthen the line, ropes made of rawhide were placed over wheeled wooden tripods. Behind the tripods, matchlock men were placed who could fire and, if required, advance. The flanks were given protection by digging ditches. In addition to the regular force, small contingents were kept apart on the left flank and in front for the ''tulghuma'' (flanking) tactic. Thus, a strong offensive-defensive formation had been prepared by Babur. Rana Sanga, fighting in a traditional way, attacked the Mughal army's flanks. He was prevented from breaking through by reinforcements dispatched by Babur. Once the advance of the Rajputs and their Afghan allies had been contained, Babur's flanking tactic came into play. The carts and matchlock men were ordered to advance, hemming in the Rajputs and their allies. At about this time [[Silhadi]] of Raisen deserted the Ranas army and went over to [[Babur]]'s. Despite putting up a gallant fight, Rana Sanga and his allies suffered a disastrous defeat. Following his victory, Babur ordered a tower of enemy skulls to be erected, a practice formulated by [[Timur]] against his adversaries, irrespective of their religious beliefs. According to Chandra, the objective of constructing a tower of skulls was not just to record a great victory, but also to terrorize opponents. Earlier, the same tactic had been used by Babur against the Afghans of Bajaur.{{sfn|Chandra|2006}}{{page needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Battle of Khanwa demonstrated that Rajput bravery was not enough to counter Babur's superior generalship and organizational skills. Babur himself commented: {{Quote|Swordsmen though some Hindustanis maybe, most of them are ignorant and unskilled in military move and stand, in soldierly counsel and procedure.}}{{sfn|Chandra|2006|p=35}}\n\nRana Sanga managed to evade capture and escape to Chittor, but the grand alliance he had built collapsed. Quoting [[L. F. Rushbrook Williams|Rushbrook Williams]], Chandra writes: {{Quote|The powerful confederacy which depended so largely for its unity upon the strength and reputation of Mewar, was shattered by a single defeat and ceased henceforth to be a dominant factor in the politics of Hindustan.}}{{sfn|Chandra|2006}}\n\nOn 30 January 1528 Rana Sanga died in Chittor, apparently poisoned by his own chiefs, who held his plans of renewing the fight with Babur to be suicidal.{{sfn|Chandra|2006}}\n\nIt is suggested that had it not been for the cannon of Babur, Rana Sanga might have achieved victory.

Of these, 33 battalions are part of the [[Standing army|Regular army]] and the remaining 16 a part of the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]]. The British Army's Infantry forms a highly flexible organisation, taking on a variety of roles, including armoured, [[Mechanized infantry|mechanised]], [[air assault]] and [[Light infantry|light]].\n\n==Recruitment and training==\n===Recruitment===\nTraditionally, regiments that form the combat arms of the British Army (cavalry and infantry) recruit from specific areas of the country. Infantry regiments had been assigned specific areas from which they would recruit from by the mid eighteenth century. These were formalised under the [[Cardwell Reforms]] that began in the 1860s. Under this scheme, single battalion infantry regiments were amalgamated into two battalion regiments, then assigned to a depot and associated recruiting area (which would usually correspond to all or part of a county). The recruiting area (usually) would then become part of the regiment's title. It was this that gave rise to the concept of the \"county regiment\", with the local infantry regiment becoming part of the fabric of its local area.\n\nOver time, regiments have been amalgamated further, which has led to recruiting areas of individual regiments increasing in size. Often, these amalgamations have been between regiments whose recruiting areas border each other. However, there have been occasions where regiments of a similar type, but from widely different areas, have been amalgamated. Two modern examples have been the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (amalgamated from the county regiments of Northumberland, Warwickshire, [[City of London]] and Lancashire, all of which were regiments of [[fusiliers]]) and The Light Infantry (amalgamated from the county regiments of Cornwall, Somerset, Shropshire, South Yorkshire and Durham, all of which were regiments of [[light infantry]]).\n\nSince September 2007, when the most recent reforms were completed, the infantry has consisted of 18 separate regiments. The five regiments of foot guards recruit from their respective [[home nations]] (with the exception of the Coldstream Guards, which recruits from the counties through which the regiment marched between Coldstream and London). Scotland, Ireland and Wales each have a single regiment of [[line infantry]] from which they recruit (though the battalions of the Royal Regiment of Scotland recruit from the areas they recruited from when they were separate regiments), while England has seven line infantry and rifles regiments. The Parachute Regiment recruits nationally, while the Royal Gurkha Rifles recruits most of its serving personnel from [[Nepal]], and the [[Royal Gibraltar Regiment]] recruits from the [[UK]] and [[Commonwealth nations]]\n\nBefore the [[Second World War]], infantry recruits were required to be at least {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m}} tall. They initially enlisted for seven years with the colours and a further five years with the reserve. They trained at their own regimental depot.<ref>[[War Office]], ''His Majesty's Army'', 1938</ref>\n\n===Training===\nUnlike the other trades in the army, which have separate units for basic training and specialised training, new recruits into the infantry undergo a single course at the [[Infantry Training Centre (British Army)|Infantry Training Centre Catterick]]. This course, called the \"Combat Infantryman's Course\" (CIC), lasts 26 weeks as standard and teaches recruits both the basics of soldiering (Phase 1 training) and the specifics of soldiering in the infantry (Phase 2 training). On completion of the CIC, the newly qualified infantry soldier will then be posted to his battalion.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Marshall|first1=Andrew|title=British Army Phase 1: Initial Military Training|url=http://bootcampmilitaryfitnessinstitute.wordpress.com/military-training/armed-forces-of-the-united-kingdom/british-army-phase-1-initial-military-training/|accessdate=27 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nFor some infantry units, the CIC is longer, due to specific additional requirements for individual regiments:\n*The Foot Guards CIC has an additional two-week enhanced drill course.\n*The Parachute Regiment CIC has an additional two-week [[P Coy|Pre-Parachute Selection]] (PPS) course.\n*The Brigade of Gurkhas CIC combines the Common Military Syllabus with the CIC, together with courses on British culture and the [[English Language]]. The Gurkha CIC lasts 37 weeks.\n\nOfficers receive their initial training at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]], infantry officers then undertake the '''Platoon Commander's Battle Course''', is run at the [[Infantry Battle School]] at Brecon in Wales. It is here that leadership and tactics are taught to new platoon commanders. New NCOs and Warrant Officers are also sent on courses at Brecon when they come up for promotion. This encompasses Phase 3 training. Phase 3 training is also undertaken at the Support Weapons School at Warminster, where new officers, NCOs and soldiers are trained in the use of support weapons (mortars, anti-tank weapons) and in communications.\n\nTerritorial Infantrymen undertake preliminary training at [[Regional training centre|Regional Training Centres]] prior to attending a two-week CIC(TA) at Catterick.\n\n===Headquarters Infantry===\nHeadquarters Infantry, which is located at [[Waterloo Lines]] on Imber Road in [[Warminster]], is responsible for recruiting, manning and training policy of the Infantry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/23300.aspx|title=Headquarters Infantry|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Divisions of infantry==\n\nThe majority of the infantry in the British Army is divided for administrative purposes into four divisions. These are not the same as the ready and regenerative divisions (see below), but are based on either the geographical recruiting areas of the regiments, or the type of regiments:\n*The [[Guards Division]] has the five regiments of [[Foot Guards]].\n*The [[Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division]] has the infantry regiments from [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Ireland]].\n*The [[King's Division]] has the regiments from the north of [[England]].\n*The [[Queen's Division]] has the regiments from the east of England and the remaining regiment of [[Fusilier]]s.\n\nA further division, the [[Light Division]], grouped together [[The Light Infantry]] and [[The Royal Green Jackets]] until they were amalgamated to form [[The Rifles]] in 2007, while the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] merged with the [[Scottish Division]] in 2017 to become The Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division.\n\n===Regular army===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Guards Division!!Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division!!King's Division!!Queen's Division\n|-\n|[[Grenadier Guards]]<br />(GREN GDS)|||[[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]<br />(SCOTS)||[[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment|The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment<br />(King's, Lancashire and Border)]]<br />(LANCS)||[[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment<br />(Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]<br />(PWRR)\n|-\n|[[Coldstream Guards]]<br />(CLDM GDS)||[[Royal Welsh|The Royal Welsh]]<br />(R WELSH)||[[Yorkshire Regiment|The Yorkshire Regiment<br />(14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)]]<br />(YORKS)||[[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers|The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]<br />(RRF)\n|-\n|[[Scots Guards]]<br />(SG)||[[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling),<br /> 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]]<br />(R IRISH)||[[Mercian Regiment|The Mercian Regiment (Cheshires,<br />Worcesters and Foresters, and Staffords)]]<br />(MERCIAN) ||[[Royal Anglian Regiment|The Royal Anglian Regiment]]<br />(R ANGLIAN)\n|-\n|[[Irish Guards]]<br />(IG)|| || ||[[Royal Gibraltar Regiment|The Royal Gibraltar Regiment]]<br />(RG)\n|-\n|[[Welsh Guards]]<br />(WG)|| || ||\n|}\n\nThere are further infantry units in the army that are not grouped in the various divisions:\n* [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]] (PARA)\n* [[Royal Gurkha Rifles|The Royal Gurkha Rifles]] (RGR)\n* [[The Rifles]] (RIFLES)\n\n===Army Reserve===\n*[[52nd Lowland Volunteers|52nd Lowland]], 6th Battalion [[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n*[[51st Highland Volunteers|51st Highland]], 7th Battalion [[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]\n*[[London Regiment (1993)|The London Regiment]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment|The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's, Lancashire and Border)]]\n*5th Battalion, [[The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[The Royal Anglian Regiment]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Yorkshire Regiment|The Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th & 33rd/76th Foot)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Mercian Regiment|The Mercian Regiment (Cheshire, Worcesters & Foresters, and Staffords)]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[Royal Welsh|The Royal Welsh]]\n*2nd Battalion, [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th & Ulster Defence Regiment)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]]\n*6th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n*7th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n*8th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n\n[[File:British Infantry 2020 Refine.png|thumb|center|920px|British Army Infantry Organization after Army 2020 Refine reform (click to enlarge)]]\n\n\n==Types of infantry==\n\n===Operations===\nWithin the British Army, there are six main types of infantry:\n*'''Armoured Infantry''' - armoured infantry are equipped with the [[Warrior Tracked Armoured Vehicle|Warrior]] armoured personnel carrier, a tracked vehicle that can deploy over all terrain.\n*'''Mechanised Infantry''' - mechanised infantry (or \"protected mobility infantry) are equipped with wheeled armoured vehicles for transporting troops. This is divided into \"heavy protected mobility infantry\" (with large vehicles such as [[Cougar (vehicle)|Mastiff]]), and \"light protected mobility infantry\" (with smaller vehicles such as [[Ocelot (vehicle)|Foxhound]]).\n*'''Light Infantry''' - light infantry are not equipped with armoured vehicles; such units may specialise in jungle and/or arctic warfare\n*'''Air Assault Infantry''' - air assault infantry are trained to be deployed using [[helicopter]]s, parachute or aircraft.\n*'''Specialised Infantry''' - infantry configured to undertake training, mentoring and assistance to indigenous forces in partner nations.\n*'''Public duties''' - infantry on public duties are essentially light infantry units undertaking primarily ceremonial tasks.\n\n===Traditions===\nThe infantry is traditionally divided into three types:\n*'''[[Foot Guards]]''' - foot guards are those infantry regiments that were formed specifically to provide close guard to the King. Soldiers in the guards were usually the best trained and equipped members of the infantry. However, they would fight in the same way as ordinary regiments.\n*'''[[Line Infantry]]''' - line infantry refers to those regiments that historically fought in linear formations, unlike light troops, who fought in loose order.  The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw expansion of the roles of the infantry. To this end, the [[company (military unit)|companies]] stationed on each flank of an infantry battalion were specialist units, with a company of [[light infantry]] trained as skirmishers to operate independently on the battlefield, and a company of [[grenadiers]], who were usually the biggest and strongest men in the battalion, operating as the lead assault troops.\n*'''[[Light Infantry]]/[[Rifle regiment|Rifles]]''' - in the late eighteenth century, the development of the [[Baker rifle]] led to the commissioning by the British Army of regiments specially trained to use the new weapon. These regiments would operate as skirmishers and [[marksman|sharpshooters]] on the edges of the field of battle. These regiments wore green rather than red tunics to enable them to blend in more with the environment, thus giving them the nickname \"green jackets\".\n\nThe tactical distinctions between infantry regiments disappeared in the late nineteenth century, but remain in tradition. In the order of precedence, the five regiments of foot guards are ranked above the ten regiments of traditional line infantry, who are ranked above the two remaining regiments of rifles.\n\n==Divisions and brigades==\nBattalions are attached permanently (semi-permanently for light role battalions) to formations.

World War]], reductions in the size of the infantry led to the amalgamation of the existing [[regimental depot]]s, together with their operational battalions, into geographically based infantry depots, each designated by a letter of the alphabet from A to O (not including I). In 1948, upon the further reduction of line infantry and rifle regiments to a single battalion, the 14 infantry depots were renamed as geographical brigades (with the exception of Depot J, which was the brigade for those regiments designated as \"light infantry\", and Depot O, which was for the two regiments of rifles<ref>Whitaker's Almanack 1956, p. 471</ref> ). These brigades assumed the administrative functions from the individual regimental depots, essentially forming what amounted to a multi-battalion regiment. This was taken a stage further following the [[1957 Defence White Paper]], when each brigade adopted a single cap badge that would be worn by all of the regiments under its administration. This led to discussions within the government regarding the flexibility of the infantry under the then present regimental system, as well as the difficulty of potentially making reductions to the size of the army owing to the emotive nature of the amalgamation of regiments into single battalions. This led to the concept of the \"[[large regiment]]\", which would use the existing brigades as the basis of new, multi-battalion infantry regiments, amalgamating the existing single-battalion regiments en masse, with each of them becoming a battalion of the new formation.<ref>More adaptations forecast in the Army: study of \"large regiment\" basis for infantry, ''The Times'', 9 March 1962</ref> This process had to a certain degree begun in the [[East Anglian Brigade|East Anglian]] and [[Green Jackets Brigade]]s, which had redesignated the regiments they were responsible for from their old names to numbered designations.<ref>Bigger infantry regiments planned by War Office, ''The Times'', 16 March 1962</ref> These two became the first large regiments as the Royal Anglian Regiment and [[Royal Green Jackets]] in 1964 and 1966 respectively.<ref>First of new large regiments, ''The Times'', 25 February 1964</ref><ref>New Green Jackets Regiment, ''The Times'', 29 May 1965</ref> Four further large regiments (The [[Queen's Regiment]], Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, [[Royal Irish Rangers]] and [[The Light Infantry|Light Infantry]]) were formed between 1966 and 1968, before the process was halted - the brigade system was abolished, with instead all of the remaining infantry regiments grouped into six administrative divisions.\n\nThe amalgamations into large regiments coincided with a planned reduction in the size of the infantry - the intention was that the junior battalion of each large regiment or brigade (prior to the implementation of the divisional structure) would be removed, whether by amalgamation or disbanding. This saw plans for the creation of four new single battalion infantry regiments:\n*[[Royal Regiment of Wales]] - [[South Wales Borderers]] and [[Welch Regiment]]\n*[[Queen's Lancashire Regiment]] - [[Lancashire Regiment]] and [[Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire)]]\n*[[Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment|Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment (29th/45th Foot)]] - [[Worcestershire Regiment]] and [[Sherwood Foresters]]\n*Royal Regiment of Gloucestershire and Hampshire - [[Gloucestershire Regiment]] and [[Royal Hampshire Regiment]]\n\nAt the same time, three more single battalion regiments elected to disband rather than amalgamate:\n*[[The Cameronians|The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)]]\n*[[York and Lancaster Regiment]]\n*[[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's)]]\n\nThree of the regimental amalgamations, two of the regimental disbandments, plus another three of the planned disbandings of large regiment battalions, took place between 1968 and 1970. However, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 General Election]] saw a change of administration, with the new [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Heath ministry|government]] electing to review the plans. The outcome of this saw the planned amalgamation of the Gloucestershire Regiment and Royal Hampshire Regiment rescinded, together with plans to disband another four infantry battalions completely. Instead, six battalions were reduced in size to a single company:\n*2nd Battalion, [[Scots Guards]] (2nd Battalion Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsguards.co.uk/history1.htm |title=History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=Scots Guards Association |access-date=2 September 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Royal Hampshire Regiment (Minden Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://1rhamps.com/rhamps/rhamps.html |title=Royal Hampshire Regiment from 1946-1992 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=The Royal Hampshire Regiment |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Balaclava Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://argylls1945to1971.co.uk/AandSH_BalaklavaCoy.htm |title= 1st Battalion The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Balaklava Company 1971|author=<!--Not stated--> |date=28 January 2015 |website=The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders History from 1945 to 1971 |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Queen's Regiment (Albuhera Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://queensregimentalassociation.org/queens-forebears.html |title=The Queen's Regiment: Formation and Forebears |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=The Queen's Regiment Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment (Tiger Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vikingveterans.com/history-of-the-1st-battalion-the-royal-anglian-regiment/ |title=History of the 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2017 |website=Viking Veterans |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*3rd Battalion, Royal Green Jackets (R Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |title=The Royal Green Jackets: The Formation and Origins of the Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=February 2009 |website=greenjackets-net.org.uk |publisher=Royal Green Jackets Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |page=31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401111607/http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |archive-date=1 April 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nThe battalions of the Scots Guards, Royal Hampshire Regiment, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, and Royal Green Jackets were subsequently reconstituted.\n\n===Delivering Security in a Changing World (2003)===\n{{main|Delivering Security in a Changing World}}\n[[HM Treasury]] asked for major cuts in the strength of the infantry in 2003, with at least ten battalions to be disbanded. This proved so unacceptable that, in November 2003, there was consideration to instead reducing each battalion to two rifle companies (with the third to come from the TA).<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/11/24/narmy24.xml News - Telegraph<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> By March 2004, ECAB had shown that the maximum number of battalions it was possible to cut was four. This was finally officially announced as part of the army [[Delivering Security in a Changing World|re-organisation]]. The [[arms plot]] system would be abolished; instead, individual battalions would be given fixed roles. To ensure that officers and men could continue to gain the variety of skills that the arms plot provided, the restructuring would also see a series of amalgamations of the remaining single battalion infantry regiments into large regiments. In addition, the regular army will lose four battalions. The roles are divided up as follows:\n*Armoured Infantry - 8 battalions (including Land Warfare Training Battalion)\n*Mechanised Infantry - 3 battalions\n*Light Role Infantry (including public duties and Gurkhas) - 20 battalions\n*Air Assault Infantry - 4 battalions\n*Commando Infantry - 1 battalion\n*Territorial Army Infantry - 14 battalions\n\nThe reorganisation was a hybrid of the systems used to organise the regular infantry in [[Australian Army|Australia]] and [[Canadian Army|Canada]]. Australia's regular infantry encompasses eight battalions in a single large regiment, the [[Royal Australian Regiment]] - this system is the one undertaken by the [[Scottish Division]] and the [[Light Division]]. Canada's regular infantry has three regiments, each of three battalions, which is how the [[King's Division]] and the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] will be restructured (albeit with one regiment of three battalions and one of two battalions each).\n\nIn addition to the army's infantry battalions, there are three further battalion-sized commando infantry units, which are part of the [[Royal Marines]], as well as eight field squadrons (each larger than an infantry company) of the [[RAF Regiment]], who have responsibility for the ground defence of air assets and are under the control of the [[Royal Air Force]].\n\nThe majority of infantry battalions are attached to one of the deployable brigades. However, there are a number of formations that exist to administer those infantry battalions that are not assigned to deployable brigades, but are instead available for independent deployment on [[roulement]] tours.\n\n====Guards Division====\nEach battalion in the five single battalion regiments of the Guards Division has a fixed role:\n*Armoured Infantry ([[Scots Guards|1 SG]]) - 1\n*Light Role/Public Duties ([[Grenadier Guards|1 GREN GDS]], [[Coldstream Guards|1 COLDM GDS]], [[Irish Guards|1 IG]], [[Welsh Guards|1 WG]]) - 4\n\nTwo battalions will be assigned as general light role battalions, with the other two assigned to public duties.

The ultimate conclusion of this process was to reduce the size of the [[British Army]] from approximately 102,000 to approximately 82,000 by 2020. The detail of the process was subsequently announced as ''[[Future of the British Army (Army 2020)|Army 2020]]'' in July 2012. As part of this, the infantry was reduced in size from 36 regular battalions to 31. Of the five to be withdrawn, two were armoured infantry units, two general light infantry and one a specialist air assault infantry battalion. The withdrawal of two armoured infantry battalions is to bring this into line with the planned future operational structure, intended to see three \"armoured infantry brigades\", each with a pair of infantry battalions, forming the core of the Army's \"reaction forces\". These two battalions, along with the two light infantry battalions, will be disbanded and their personnel distributed among the remaining battalions of each regiment.

Two notable ones depicting the modern British Army have been ''[[Spearhead (TV series)|Spearhead]]'' from the period of the late 1970s, and ''[[Soldier Soldier]]'' from the early to mid-1990s. Both are seen as reasonably accurate depictions of life in the army at those times, and both are centred on a fictional infantry regiment.

Of these, 33 battalions are part of the [[Standing army|Regular army]] and the remaining 16 a part of the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]]. The British Army's Infantry forms a highly flexible organisation, taking on a variety of roles, including armoured, [[Mechanized infantry|mechanised]], [[air assault]] and [[Light infantry|light]].\n\n==Recruitment and training==\n===Recruitment===\nTraditionally, regiments that form the combat arms of the British Army (cavalry and infantry) recruit from specific areas of the country. Infantry regiments had been assigned specific areas from which they would recruit from by the mid eighteenth century. These were formalised under the [[Cardwell Reforms]] that began in the 1860s. Under this scheme, single battalion infantry regiments were amalgamated into two battalion regiments, then assigned to a depot and associated recruiting area (which would usually correspond to all or part of a county). The recruiting area (usually) would then become part of the regiment's title. It was this that gave rise to the concept of the \"county regiment\", with the local infantry regiment becoming part of the fabric of its local area.\n\nOver time, regiments have been amalgamated further, which has led to recruiting areas of individual regiments increasing in size. Often, these amalgamations have been between regiments whose recruiting areas border each other. However, there have been occasions where regiments of a similar type, but from widely different areas, have been amalgamated. Two modern examples have been the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (amalgamated from the county regiments of Northumberland, Warwickshire, [[City of London]] and Lancashire, all of which were regiments of [[fusiliers]]) and The Light Infantry (amalgamated from the county regiments of Cornwall, Somerset, Shropshire, South Yorkshire and Durham, all of which were regiments of [[light infantry]]).\n\nSince September 2007, when the most recent reforms were completed, the infantry has consisted of 18 separate regiments. The five regiments of foot guards recruit from their respective [[home nations]] (with the exception of the Coldstream Guards, which recruits from the counties through which the regiment marched between Coldstream and London). Scotland, Ireland and Wales each have a single regiment of [[line infantry]] from which they recruit (though the battalions of the Royal Regiment of Scotland recruit from the areas they recruited from when they were separate regiments), while England has seven line infantry and rifles regiments. The Parachute Regiment recruits nationally, while the Royal Gurkha Rifles recruits most of its serving personnel from [[Nepal]], and the [[Royal Gibraltar Regiment]] recruits from the [[UK]] and [[Commonwealth nations]]\n\nBefore the [[Second World War]], infantry recruits were required to be at least {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m}} tall. They initially enlisted for seven years with the colours and a further five years with the reserve. They trained at their own regimental depot.<ref>[[War Office]], ''His Majesty's Army'', 1938</ref>\n\n===Training===\nUnlike the other trades in the army, which have separate units for basic training and specialised training, new recruits into the infantry undergo a single course at the [[Infantry Training Centre (British Army)|Infantry Training Centre Catterick]]. This course, called the \"Combat Infantryman's Course\" (CIC), lasts 26 weeks as standard and teaches recruits both the basics of soldiering (Phase 1 training) and the specifics of soldiering in the infantry (Phase 2 training). On completion of the CIC, the newly qualified infantry soldier will then be posted to his battalion.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Marshall|first1=Andrew|title=British Army Phase 1: Initial Military Training|url=http://bootcampmilitaryfitnessinstitute.wordpress.com/military-training/armed-forces-of-the-united-kingdom/british-army-phase-1-initial-military-training/|accessdate=27 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nFor some infantry units, the CIC is longer, due to specific additional requirements for individual regiments:\n*The Foot Guards CIC has an additional two-week enhanced drill course.\n*The Parachute Regiment CIC has an additional two-week [[P Coy|Pre-Parachute Selection]] (PPS) course.\n*The Brigade of Gurkhas CIC combines the Common Military Syllabus with the CIC, together with courses on British culture and the [[English Language]]. The Gurkha CIC lasts 37 weeks.\n\nOfficers receive their initial training at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]], infantry officers then undertake the '''Platoon Commander's Battle Course''', is run at the [[Infantry Battle School]] at Brecon in Wales. It is here that leadership and tactics are taught to new platoon commanders. New NCOs and Warrant Officers are also sent on courses at Brecon when they come up for promotion. This encompasses Phase 3 training. Phase 3 training is also undertaken at the Support Weapons School at Warminster, where new officers, NCOs and soldiers are trained in the use of support weapons (mortars, anti-tank weapons) and in communications.\n\nTerritorial Infantrymen undertake preliminary training at [[Regional training centre|Regional Training Centres]] prior to attending a two-week CIC(TA) at Catterick.\n\n===Headquarters Infantry===\nHeadquarters Infantry, which is located at [[Waterloo Lines]] on Imber Road in [[Warminster]], is responsible for recruiting, manning and training policy of the Infantry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/23300.aspx|title=Headquarters Infantry|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Divisions of infantry==\n\nThe majority of the infantry in the British Army is divided for administrative purposes into four divisions. These are not the same as the ready and regenerative divisions (see below), but are based on either the geographical recruiting areas of the regiments, or the type of regiments:\n*The [[Guards Division]] has the five regiments of [[Foot Guards]].\n*The [[Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division]] has the infantry regiments from [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Ireland]].\n*The [[King's Division]] has the regiments from the north of [[England]].\n*The [[Queen's Division]] has the regiments from the east of England and the remaining regiment of [[Fusilier]]s.\n\nA further division, the [[Light Division]], grouped together [[The Light Infantry]] and [[The Royal Green Jackets]] until they were amalgamated to form [[The Rifles]] in 2007, while the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] merged with the [[Scottish Division]] in 2017 to become The Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division.\n\n===Regular army===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Guards Division!!Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division!!King's Division!!Queen's Division\n|-\n|[[Grenadier Guards]]<br />(GREN GDS)|||[[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]<br />(SCOTS)||[[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment|The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment<br />(King's, Lancashire and Border)]]<br />(LANCS)||[[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment<br />(Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]<br />(PWRR)\n|-\n|[[Coldstream Guards]]<br />(CLDM GDS)||[[Royal Welsh|The Royal Welsh]]<br />(R WELSH)||[[Yorkshire Regiment|The Yorkshire Regiment<br />(14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)]]<br />(YORKS)||[[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers|The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]<br />(RRF)\n|-\n|[[Scots Guards]]<br />(SG)||[[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling),<br /> 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]]<br />(R IRISH)||[[Mercian Regiment|The Mercian Regiment (Cheshires,<br />Worcesters and Foresters, and Staffords)]]<br />(MERCIAN) ||[[Royal Anglian Regiment|The Royal Anglian Regiment]]<br />(R ANGLIAN)\n|-\n|[[Irish Guards]]<br />(IG)|| || ||[[Royal Gibraltar Regiment|The Royal Gibraltar Regiment]]<br />(RG)\n|-\n|[[Welsh Guards]]<br />(WG)|| || ||\n|}\n\nThere are further infantry units in the army that are not grouped in the various divisions:\n* [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]] (PARA)\n* [[Royal Gurkha Rifles|The Royal Gurkha Rifles]] (RGR)\n* [[The Rifles]] (RIFLES)\n\n===Army Reserve===\n*[[52nd Lowland Volunteers|52nd Lowland]], 6th Battalion [[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n*[[51st Highland Volunteers|51st Highland]], 7th Battalion [[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]\n*[[London Regiment (1993)|The London Regiment]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment|The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's, Lancashire and Border)]]\n*5th Battalion, [[The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[The Royal Anglian Regiment]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Yorkshire Regiment|The Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th & 33rd/76th Foot)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Mercian Regiment|The Mercian Regiment (Cheshire, Worcesters & Foresters, and Staffords)]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[Royal Welsh|The Royal Welsh]]\n*2nd Battalion, [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th & Ulster Defence Regiment)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]]\n*6th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n*7th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n*8th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n\n[[File:British Infantry 2020 Refine.png|thumb|center|920px|British Army Infantry Organization after Army 2020 Refine reform (click to enlarge)]]\n\n\n==Types of infantry==\n\n===Operations===\nWithin the British Army, there are six main types of infantry:\n*'''Armoured Infantry''' - armoured infantry are equipped with the [[Warrior Tracked Armoured Vehicle|Warrior]] armoured personnel carrier, a tracked vehicle that can deploy over all terrain.\n*'''Mechanised Infantry''' - mechanised infantry (or \"protected mobility infantry) are equipped with wheeled armoured vehicles for transporting troops. This is divided into \"heavy protected mobility infantry\" (with large vehicles such as [[Cougar (vehicle)|Mastiff]]), and \"light protected mobility infantry\" (with smaller vehicles such as [[Ocelot (vehicle)|Foxhound]]).\n*'''Light Infantry''' - light infantry are not equipped with armoured vehicles; such units may specialise in jungle and/or arctic warfare\n*'''Air Assault Infantry''' - air assault infantry are trained to be deployed using [[helicopter]]s, parachute or aircraft.\n*'''Specialised Infantry''' - infantry configured to undertake training, mentoring and assistance to indigenous forces in partner nations.\n*'''Public duties''' - infantry on public duties are essentially light infantry units undertaking primarily ceremonial tasks.\n\n===Traditions===\nThe infantry is traditionally divided into three types:\n*'''[[Foot Guards]]''' - foot guards are those infantry regiments that were formed specifically to provide close guard to the King. Soldiers in the guards were usually the best trained and equipped members of the infantry. However, they would fight in the same way as ordinary regiments.\n*'''[[Line Infantry]]''' - line infantry refers to those regiments that historically fought in linear formations, unlike light troops, who fought in loose order.  The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw expansion of the roles of the infantry. To this end, the [[company (military unit)|companies]] stationed on each flank of an infantry battalion were specialist units, with a company of [[light infantry]] trained as skirmishers to operate independently on the battlefield, and a company of [[grenadiers]], who were usually the biggest and strongest men in the battalion, operating as the lead assault troops.\n*'''[[Light Infantry]]/[[Rifle regiment|Rifles]]''' - in the late eighteenth century, the development of the [[Baker rifle]] led to the commissioning by the British Army of regiments specially trained to use the new weapon. These regiments would operate as skirmishers and [[marksman|sharpshooters]] on the edges of the field of battle. These regiments wore green rather than red tunics to enable them to blend in more with the environment, thus giving them the nickname \"green jackets\".\n\nThe tactical distinctions between infantry regiments disappeared in the late nineteenth century, but remain in tradition. In the order of precedence, the five regiments of foot guards are ranked above the ten regiments of traditional line infantry, who are ranked above the two remaining regiments of rifles.\n\n==Divisions and brigades==\nBattalions are attached permanently (semi-permanently for light role battalions) to formations. As of the planned Army 2020 (Refine) postings:\n===[[1st (United Kingdom) Division]]===\n1st (United Kingdom) Division forms the core of what is referred to as the \"Adaptable Force\", and is composed of four infantry brigades made up of regular and paired reserve battalions, primarily for use in domestic situations or overseas commitments, but also with a capability for brigade level deployments if required, and with sufficient notice.\n*'''[[4th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters North East]]'''\n**[[Royal Highland Fusiliers|The Royal Highland Fusiliers]], [[Royal Regiment of Scotland|2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland]] (Light Infantry)\n**2nd Battalion, [[Yorkshire Regiment|The Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)]] (Light Infantry){{efn|name=Cyprus|group=note}}\n**1st Battalion, [[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment|The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's, Lancashire and Border)]] (Light Infantry){{efn|name=Cyprus|group=note}}\n**[[52nd Lowland Regiment|52nd Lowland]], 6th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland (Army Reserve){{efn|name=Reserve|group=note|Army reserve battalions are 'paired' with regular battalions}}\n**4th Battalion, The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's, Lancashire and Border) (Army Reserve){{efn|name=Reserve|group=note|Army reserve battalions are 'paired' with regular battalions}}\n**4th Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot) (Army Reserve){{efn|name=Reserve|group=note|Army reserve battalions are 'paired' with regular battalions}}\n*'''[[7th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters East]]'''\n**1st Battalion, [[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]] (Light Infantry){{efn|name=Cyprus|group=note}}\n**1st Battalion, [[Royal Anglian Regiment|The Royal Anglian Regiment]] (Light Infantry){{efn|name=Cyprus|group=note}}\n**1st Battalion, [[The Rifles]] (Light Infantry)\n**4th Battalion, The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires) (Army Reserve){{efn|name=Reserve|group=note|Army reserve battalions are 'paired' with regular battalions}}\n**3rd Battalion, The Royal Anglian Regiment (Army Reserve){{efn|name=Reserve|group=note|Army reserve battalions are 'paired' with regular battalions}}\n**6th Battalion, The Rifles (Army Reserve){{efn|name=Reserve|group=note|Army reserve battalions are 'paired' with regular battalions}}\n*'''[[11th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters South East]]'''\n**1st Battalion, [[Grenadier Guards]] (Mechanised Infantry [Light]){{efn|name=Guards|group=note}}\n**1st Battalion, [[Welsh Guards]] (Mechanised Infantry [Light]){{efn|name=Guards|group=note}}\n**1st Battalion, [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]] (Mechanised Infantry [Light])\n**3rd Battalion, The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires) (Army Reserve){{efn|name=Reserve|group=note|Army reserve battalions are 'paired' with regular battalions}}\n**[[London Regiment (1993)|The London Regiment]] (Army Reserve)\n**2nd Battalion, The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment) (Army Reserve){{efn|name=Reserve|group=note|Army reserve battalions are 'paired' with regular battalions}}\n*'''[[51st Infantry Brigade and Headquarters Scotland]]'''\n**[[Black Watch|The Black Watch]], 3rd Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland (Mechanised Infantry [Light])\n**2nd Battalion, The Rifles (Light Infantry)\n**[[51st Highland Regiment|51st Highland]], 7th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland (Army Reserve){{efn|name=Reserve|group=note|Army reserve battalions are 'paired' with regular battalions}}\n**8th Battalion, The Rifles (Army Reserve){{efn|name=Reserve|group=note|Army reserve battalions are 'paired' with regular battalions}}\n**[[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|Balaklava Company]], 5th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland (Public Duties){{efn|name=Company|group=note}}\n\n===[[3rd (United Kingdom) Division]]===\n3rd (United Kingdom) Division is the primary element of the \"Reaction Force\", with a number of armoured infantry brigades intended to operate as the primary force intended for brigade level deployments at up to three months notice.

World War]], reductions in the size of the infantry led to the amalgamation of the existing [[regimental depot]]s, together with their operational battalions, into geographically based infantry depots, each designated by a letter of the alphabet from A to O (not including I). In 1948, upon the further reduction of line infantry and rifle regiments to a single battalion, the 14 infantry depots were renamed as geographical brigades (with the exception of Depot J, which was the brigade for those regiments designated as \"light infantry\", and Depot O, which was for the two regiments of rifles<ref>Whitaker's Almanack 1956, p. 471</ref> ). These brigades assumed the administrative functions from the individual regimental depots, essentially forming what amounted to a multi-battalion regiment. This was taken a stage further following the [[1957 Defence White Paper]], when each brigade adopted a single cap badge that would be worn by all of the regiments under its administration. This led to discussions within the government regarding the flexibility of the infantry under the then present regimental system, as well as the difficulty of potentially making reductions to the size of the army owing to the emotive nature of the amalgamation of regiments into single battalions. This led to the concept of the \"[[large regiment]]\", which would use the existing brigades as the basis of new, multi-battalion infantry regiments, amalgamating the existing single-battalion regiments en masse, with each of them becoming a battalion of the new formation.<ref>More adaptations forecast in the Army: study of \"large regiment\" basis for infantry, ''The Times'', 9 March 1962</ref> This process had to a certain degree begun in the [[East Anglian Brigade|East Anglian]] and [[Green Jackets Brigade]]s, which had redesignated the regiments they were responsible for from their old names to numbered designations.<ref>Bigger infantry regiments planned by War Office, ''The Times'', 16 March 1962</ref> These two became the first large regiments as the Royal Anglian Regiment and [[Royal Green Jackets]] in 1964 and 1966 respectively.<ref>First of new large regiments, ''The Times'', 25 February 1964</ref><ref>New Green Jackets Regiment, ''The Times'', 29 May 1965</ref> Four further large regiments (The [[Queen's Regiment]], Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, [[Royal Irish Rangers]] and [[The Light Infantry|Light Infantry]]) were formed between 1966 and 1968, before the process was halted - the brigade system was abolished, with instead all of the remaining infantry regiments grouped into six administrative divisions.\n\nThe amalgamations into large regiments coincided with a planned reduction in the size of the infantry - the intention was that the junior battalion of each large regiment or brigade (prior to the implementation of the divisional structure) would be removed, whether by amalgamation or disbanding. This saw plans for the creation of four new single battalion infantry regiments:\n*[[Royal Regiment of Wales]] - [[South Wales Borderers]] and [[Welch Regiment]]\n*[[Queen's Lancashire Regiment]] - [[Lancashire Regiment]] and [[Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire)]]\n*[[Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment|Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment (29th/45th Foot)]] - [[Worcestershire Regiment]] and [[Sherwood Foresters]]\n*Royal Regiment of Gloucestershire and Hampshire - [[Gloucestershire Regiment]] and [[Royal Hampshire Regiment]]\n\nAt the same time, three more single battalion regiments elected to disband rather than amalgamate:\n*[[The Cameronians|The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)]]\n*[[York and Lancaster Regiment]]\n*[[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's)]]\n\nThree of the regimental amalgamations, two of the regimental disbandments, plus another three of the planned disbandings of large regiment battalions, took place between 1968 and 1970. However, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 General Election]] saw a change of administration, with the new [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Heath ministry|government]] electing to review the plans. The outcome of this saw the planned amalgamation of the Gloucestershire Regiment and Royal Hampshire Regiment rescinded, together with plans to disband another four infantry battalions completely. Instead, six battalions were reduced in size to a single company:\n*2nd Battalion, [[Scots Guards]] (2nd Battalion Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsguards.co.uk/history1.htm |title=History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=Scots Guards Association |access-date=2 September 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Royal Hampshire Regiment (Minden Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://1rhamps.com/rhamps/rhamps.html |title=Royal Hampshire Regiment from 1946-1992 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=The Royal Hampshire Regiment |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Balaclava Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://argylls1945to1971.co.uk/AandSH_BalaklavaCoy.htm |title= 1st Battalion The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Balaklava Company 1971|author=<!--Not stated--> |date=28 January 2015 |website=The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders History from 1945 to 1971 |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Queen's Regiment (Albuhera Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://queensregimentalassociation.org/queens-forebears.html |title=The Queen's Regiment: Formation and Forebears |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=The Queen's Regiment Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment (Tiger Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vikingveterans.com/history-of-the-1st-battalion-the-royal-anglian-regiment/ |title=History of the 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2017 |website=Viking Veterans |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*3rd Battalion, Royal Green Jackets (R Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |title=The Royal Green Jackets: The Formation and Origins of the Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=February 2009 |website=greenjackets-net.org.uk |publisher=Royal Green Jackets Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |page=31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401111607/http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |archive-date=1 April 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nThe battalions of the Scots Guards, Royal Hampshire Regiment, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, and Royal Green Jackets were subsequently reconstituted.\n\n===Delivering Security in a Changing World (2003)===\n{{main|Delivering Security in a Changing World}}\n[[HM Treasury]] asked for major cuts in the strength of the infantry in 2003, with at least ten battalions to be disbanded. This proved so unacceptable that, in November 2003, there was consideration to instead reducing each battalion to two rifle companies (with the third to come from the TA).<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/11/24/narmy24.xml News - Telegraph<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> By March 2004, ECAB had shown that the maximum number of battalions it was possible to cut was four. This was finally officially announced as part of the army [[Delivering Security in a Changing World|re-organisation]]. The [[arms plot]] system would be abolished; instead, individual battalions would be given fixed roles. To ensure that officers and men could continue to gain the variety of skills that the arms plot provided, the restructuring would also see a series of amalgamations of the remaining single battalion infantry regiments into large regiments. In addition, the regular army will lose four battalions. The roles are divided up as follows:\n*Armoured Infantry - 8 battalions (including Land Warfare Training Battalion)\n*Mechanised Infantry - 3 battalions\n*Light Role Infantry (including public duties and Gurkhas) - 20 battalions\n*Air Assault Infantry - 4 battalions\n*Commando Infantry - 1 battalion\n*Territorial Army Infantry - 14 battalions\n\nThe reorganisation was a hybrid of the systems used to organise the regular infantry in [[Australian Army|Australia]] and [[Canadian Army|Canada]]. Australia's regular infantry encompasses eight battalions in a single large regiment, the [[Royal Australian Regiment]] - this system is the one undertaken by the [[Scottish Division]] and the [[Light Division]]. Canada's regular infantry has three regiments, each of three battalions, which is how the [[King's Division]] and the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] will be restructured (albeit with one regiment of three battalions and one of two battalions each).\n\nIn addition to the army's infantry battalions, there are three further battalion-sized commando infantry units, which are part of the [[Royal Marines]], as well as eight field squadrons (each larger than an infantry company) of the [[RAF Regiment]], who have responsibility for the ground defence of air assets and are under the control of the [[Royal Air Force]].\n\nThe majority of infantry battalions are attached to one of the deployable brigades. However, there are a number of formations that exist to administer those infantry battalions that are not assigned to deployable brigades, but are instead available for independent deployment on [[roulement]] tours.\n\n====Guards Division====\nEach battalion in the five single battalion regiments of the Guards Division has a fixed role:\n*Armoured Infantry ([[Scots Guards|1 SG]]) - 1\n*Light Role/Public Duties ([[Grenadier Guards|1 GREN GDS]], [[Coldstream Guards|1 COLDM GDS]], [[Irish Guards|1 IG]], [[Welsh Guards|1 WG]]) - 4\n\nTwo battalions will be assigned as general light role battalions, with the other two assigned to public duties.

The ultimate conclusion of this process was to reduce the size of the [[British Army]] from approximately 102,000 to approximately 82,000 by 2020. The detail of the process was subsequently announced as ''[[Future of the British Army (Army 2020)|Army 2020]]'' in July 2012. As part of this, the infantry was reduced in size from 36 regular battalions to 31. Of the five to be withdrawn, two were armoured infantry units, two general light infantry and one a specialist air assault infantry battalion. The withdrawal of two armoured infantry battalions is to bring this into line with the planned future operational structure, intended to see three \"armoured infantry brigades\", each with a pair of infantry battalions, forming the core of the Army's \"reaction forces\". These two battalions, along with the two light infantry battalions, will be disbanded and their personnel distributed among the remaining battalions of each regiment. The air assault battalion will be reduced to company strength, with the intention that it is assigned as a permanent [[public duties]] unit in Scotland.\n\nThe affected regiments were:\n*[[Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n**The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 5th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland - Reduced to an incremental company and assigned to [[public duties]] in Scotland.\n*[[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st Battalion.\n*[[Yorkshire Regiment|Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot) (Green Howards) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st and 3rd Battalions. 3 YORKS will eventually be renamed as 1 YORKS. 1 YORKS will eventually be renumbered as 2 YORKS.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140102194816/http://www.dwr.org.uk/news.php?id=2&nw=239 Duke of Wellington's Regiment]</ref>\n*[[Mercian Regiment]]\n**3rd Battalion, The Mercian Regiment (Staffords) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st and 2nd Battalions.\n*[[Royal Welsh]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Royal Welsh (Royal Regiment of Wales) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st Battalion.\n\nIn addition, the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]] was transferred to the administration of the [[Prince of Wales' Division]].\n\n===Army 2020 Refine===\nUnder a further review called [[Future of the British Army (Army 2020 Refine)|Army 2020 Refine]], the 1st Battalion, Scots Guards and the 4th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland will be equipped with [[Mechanised Infantry Vehicle]]s and form the core of the first Strike Brigade under the Reaction Force. Five infantry battalions will undertake the new specialist infantry role; these units will provide an increased contribution to countering terrorism and building stability overseas, and will number around 300 personnel. Four of these battalions, 1st Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland; 2nd Battalion, The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment; 2nd Battalion, The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment; and 4th Battalion, The Rifles, will be existing battalions, while the fifth will be formed as a new battalion of the Royal Gurkha Rifles <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2016-12-15/HCWS367/|title=Strategic Defence and Security Review - Army: Written statement - HCWS367|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/defence-committee/sdsr-2015-and-the-army/oral/34418.html|title=Oral evidence: SDSR 2015 and the Army, HC 108|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=17 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.janes.com/article/81826/uk-to-recruit-more-gurkha-soldiers |title=UK to recruit more Gurkha soldiers |last=Ripley |first=Tim |date=18 July 2018|website=Jane's 360 |publisher= |access-date=20 July 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n====Guards Division====\n*Heavy Protected Mobility Infantry (1 SG) - 1\n*Light Role Infantry (1 COLDM GDS, 1 IG) - 2\n*Light Role/Public Duties (1 GREN GDS, 1 WG) - 2\n*Public Duties (2 GREN GDS, 2 COLDM GDS, 2 SG){{ref|Alpha|\u03b1}}\n*Army Reserve (LONDONS) - 1\n<small>All five battalions will periodically rotate roles</small>\n\n====Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division====\n*Armoured Infantry (1 R WELSH) - 1\n*Heavy Protected Mobility Infantry (4 SCOTS) - 1\n*Light Protected Mobility Infantry (3 SCOTS, 1 R IRISH) - 2\n*Light Role Infantry (2 SCOTS) - 1\n*Specialised Training Infantry (1 SCOTS) - 1\n*Public Duties - (5 SCOTS){{ref|Alpha|\u03b1}}\n*Army Reserve - (6 SCOTS, 7 SCOTS, 3 R WELSH, 2 R IRISH) - 4\n\n====King's Division====\n*Armoured Infantry (1 YORKS, 1 MERCIAN) - 2\n*Light Protected Mobility Infantry (2 YORKS) - 1\n*Light Role Infantry (1 LANCS, 2 MERCIAN) - 2\n*Specialised Training Infantry (2 LANCS) - 1\n*Army Reserve (4 LANCS, 4 YORKS, 4 MERCIAN) - 3\n\n====Queen's Division====\n*Armoured Infantry (1 PWRR, 1 RRF) - 2\n*Light Protected Mobility Infantry (2 R ANGLIAN) - 1\n*Light Role Infantry (1 R ANGLIAN) - 1\n*Light Role Infantry (Home Defence) (1 RG) - 1\n*Specialised Training Infantry (2 PWRR) - 1\n*Army Reserve (3 PWRR, 4 PWRR, 5 RRF, 3 R ANGLIAN) - 4\n\n====The Rifles====\n*Armoured Infantry (5 RIFLES) - 1\n*Light Protected Mobility Infantry (3 RIFLES) - 1\n*Light Role Infantry (1 RIFLES, 2 RIFLES) - 2\n*Specialised Training Infantry (4 RIFLES) - 1\n*Army Reserve (6 RIFLES, 7 RIFLES, 8 RIFLES) - 3\n\n====Other infantry regiments====\n*Light Role Infantry (1 RGR, 2 RGR) - 2\n*Parachute Infantry (2 PARA, 3 PARA) - 2\n*Specialised Training Infantry (3 RGR) - 1\n*Army Reserve (4 PARA) - 1\n<small>:{{note|Alpha|\u03b1}} These are the battalions represented by the [[British Army incremental infantry companies|four incremental companies]]</small>\n\n==Other regiments==\n\n===Disbanded regiments===\nOver time, a handful of infantry regiments have disappeared from the roll through disbandment rather than amalgamation.

He was particularly concerned at the prospect of a French invasion of the [[British Isles]]<ref>Lambert p. 149</ref> which led him to keep a large force in the [[English Channel]]. In 1756 he was criticised for not sending enough ships with [[John Byng|Admiral Byng]] to [[Siege of Fort St Philip (1756)|relieve Minorca]] because he wanted to protect Britain from a threatened invasion, only to see [[Battle of Minorca (1756)|Byng fail to save Minorca]] while no invasion attempt materialised.

He was particularly concerned at the prospect of a French invasion of the [[British Isles]]<ref>Lambert p. 149</ref> which led him to keep a large force in the [[English Channel]]. In 1756 he was criticised for not sending enough ships with [[John Byng|Admiral Byng]] to [[Siege of Fort St Philip (1756)|relieve Minorca]] because he wanted to protect Britain from a threatened invasion, only to see [[Battle of Minorca (1756)|Byng fail to save Minorca]] while no invasion attempt materialised.

He instituted a close [[blockade]] of the French coast, which proved crippling to the French economy and ensured no invasion fleet could slip out undetected. The British victories at the [[Battle of Lagos]] in August 1759 and the [[Battle of Quiberon Bay]] in November 1759 destroyed any realistic hope of a major invasion of the British Isles.<ref>Anderson pp. 381-83</ref>\n\nAs well as securing home defense, Anson co-ordinated with [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] a series of British attacks on French colonies around the globe. By 1760 the British had captured [[Canada]], [[Senegal]] and [[Guadeloupe]] from the French, and followed it up by [[Capture of Belle \u00cele|capturing Belle \u00cele]] and Dominica in 1761. In 1762 the entry of Spain into the war offered further chances for British expeditions. Anson was the architect of a plan to [[Battle of Manila (1762)|seize Manila]] in the Philippines and, using the idea and plans of Admiral [[Sir Charles Knowles, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Knowles]]<ref>Battle for Empire The very first world war 1756-63 by Tom Pocock.

The remaining three fourths are shown. Dotted lines indicate where the cake may be cut in order to divide it into equal parts. Each fourth of the cake is denoted by the fraction {{sfrac|1|4}}.]]\n\nA '''fraction''' (from [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|fractus}}'', \"broken\") represents a part of a whole or, more generally, any number of equal parts. When spoken in everyday English, a fraction describes how many parts of a certain size there are, for example, one-half, eight-fifths, three-quarters. A ''common'', ''vulgar'', or ''simple'' fraction (examples: <math>\\tfrac{1}{2}</math> and <math>\\tfrac{17}{3}</math>) consists of an [[integer]] numerator displayed above a line (or before a slash), and a non-zero integer denominator, displayed below (or after) that line. Numerators and denominators are also used in fractions that are not ''common'', including compound fractions, complex fractions, and mixed numerals.\n\nWe begin with positive common fractions, where the numerator and denominator are [[natural number]]s. The numerator represents a number of equal parts, and the denominator indicates how many of those parts make up a unit or a whole. The denominator cannot be zero because zero parts can never make up a whole. For example, in the fraction 3/4, the numerator, 3, tells us that the fraction represents 3 equal parts, and the denominator, 4, tells us that 4 parts make up a whole. The picture to the right illustrates <math>\\tfrac{3}{4}</math>or {{frac|3|4}} of a cake.\n\nA common fraction is a numeral which represents a [[rational number]]. That same number can also be represented as a decimal, a percent, or with a negative exponent. For example, 0.01, 1%, and 10<sup>\u22122</sup> all equal the fraction 1/100. An integer such as the number 7 can be thought of as having an implicit denominator of one: 7 equals 7/1.\n\nOther uses for fractions are to represent [[ratio]]s and [[division (mathematics)|division]].<ref>H. Wu, \"The Mis-Education of Mathematics Teachers\", ''Notices of the American Mathematical Society'', Volume 58, Issue 03 (March 2011), [http://www.ams.org/notices/201103/rtx110300372p.pdf#page374 page 374] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820101254/http://www.ams.org/notices/201103/rtx110300372p.pdf#page374 |date=2017-08-20 }}</ref> Thus the fraction {{sfrac|3|4}} is also used to represent the ratio 3:4 (the ratio of the part to the whole) and the division 3 \u00f7 4 (three divided by four). The non-zero denominator in the case using a fraction to represent division is an example of the rule that [[division by zero]] is undefined.\n\nWe can also write negative fractions, which represent the opposite of a positive fraction. For example, if {{sfrac|1|2}} represents a half dollar profit, then \u2212{{sfrac|1|2}} represents a half dollar loss. Because of the rules of division of signed numbers, which require that, for example, negative divided by positive is negative, \u2212{{sfrac|1|2}}, {{sfrac|-1|2}} and {{sfrac|1|-2}}, all represent the same fraction, negative one-half. Because a negative divided by a negative produces a positive, {{sfrac|-1|-2}} represents positive one-half.\n\nIn mathematics the set of all numbers that can be expressed in the form a/b, where a and b are [[integer]]s and b is not zero, is called the set of rational numbers and is represented by the symbol '''Q''', which stands for [[quotient]]. The test for a number being a rational number is that it can be written in that form (i.e., as a common fraction). However, the word ''fraction'' is also used to describe mathematical expressions that are not rational numbers, for example [[algebraic fraction]]s (quotients of algebraic expressions), and expressions that contain [[irrational number]]s, such as {{sqrt|2}}/2 (see [[square root of 2]]) and \u03c0/4 (see [[proof that \u03c0 is irrational]]).\n\n==Vocabulary<!--'Fraction bar' redirects here-->==\n{{See also|Numeral (linguistics)#Fractional numbers|English numerals#Fractions and decimals}}\nIn a fraction, the number of equal parts being described is the '''numerator''' (from [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|numer\u0101tor}}'', \"counter\" or \"numberer\"), and the type or variety of the parts is the '''denominator''' (from [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|d\u0113n\u014dmin\u0101tor}}'', \"thing that names or designates\").<!--both boldface per WP:R#PLA--><ref name=schwartzman>{{cite book |last=Schwartzman|first=Steven |title=The Words of Mathematics: An Etymological Dictionary of Mathematical Terms Used in English |url=https://archive.org/details/wordsofmathemati0000schw|url-access=registration|publisher=Mathematical Association of America |date=1994|isbn=978-0-88385-511-9 }}</ref> As an example, the fraction {{frac|8|5}} amounts to eight parts, each of which is of the type named \"fifth\". In terms of [[division (math)|division]], the numerator corresponds to the [[division (math)|dividend]], and the denominator corresponds to the [[division (math)|divisor]].\n\nInformally, the numerator and denominator may be distinguished by placement alone but in formal contexts they are usually separated by a '''fraction bar'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->. The fraction bar may be horizontal (as in {{sfrac|1|3}}), oblique (as in 2/5), or diagonal (as in {{frac|4|9}}).<ref name=ambrose/> These marks are respectively known as the horizontal bar; the virgule, [[slash mark|slash]] ([[American English|US]]), or [[oblique stroke|stroke]] ([[British English|UK]]); and the fraction bar, solidus, or [[fraction slash]].{{refn|group=n|Some typographers such as [[Robert Bringhurst|Bringhurst]] mistakenly distinguish the slash {{angle brackets|[[/]]}} as the ''[[wikt:virgule|virgule]]'' and the fraction slash {{angle brackets|[[\u2044]]}} as the ''[[solidus mark|solidus]]'',<ref name=\"bringhurst\">{{cite book |last=Bringhurst |first=Robert |year=2002 |title=The Elements of Typographic Style |edition=3rd |publisher=Hartley & Marks |isbn=978-0-88179-206-5 |pages=81\u201382 |contribution=5.2.5: Use the Virgule with Words and Dates, the Solidus with Split-level Fractions |location=[[Point Roberts, Washington|Point Roberts]]}}</ref> although in fact both are synonyms for the standard slash.<ref name=verg>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=1st |title=virgule, ''n.'' |date=1917 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press }}</ref><ref name=oedsolid>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=1st |title=solidus, ''n.<sup>1</sup>'' |date=1913 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press }}</ref>}} In [[typography]], fractions stacked vertically are also known as \"[[en (typography)|en]]\" or \"[[en dash|nut]] fractions\", and diagonal ones as \"[[em (typography)|em]]\" or \"mutton fractions\", based on whether a fraction with a single-digit numerator and denominator occupies the proportion of a narrow ''en'' square, or a wider ''em'' square.<ref name=ambrose>{{cite book |last=Ambrose |first=Gavin |author2=Paul Harris |display-authors=1 |ref={{harvid|Ambrose & al.}} |p=[https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=IW9MAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA74 74] |url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=IW9MAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover |title=The Fundamentals of Typography |edition=2nd |publisher=AVA Publishing |location=Lausanne |date=2006 |isbn=978-2-940411-76-4 |access-date=2016-02-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304022742/https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=IW9MAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=live }}.</ref> In traditional typefounding, a piece of type bearing a complete fraction (e.g. {{sfrac|1|2}}) was known as a \"case fraction,\" while those representing only part of fraction were called \"piece fractions.\"\n\nThe denominators of English fractions are generally expressed as [[Ordinal number (linguistics)#Variations|ordinal numbers]], in the plural if the numerator is not one. (For example, {{frac|2|5}} and {{frac|3|5}} are both read as a number of \"fifths\".) Exceptions include the denominator 2, which is always read \"half\" or \"halves\", the denominator 4, which may be alternatively expressed as \"quarter\"/\"quarters\" or as \"fourth\"/\"fourths\", and the denominator 100, which may be alternatively expressed as \"hundredth\"/\"hundredths\" or \"[[percent]]\". When the denominator is 1, it may be expressed in terms of \"wholes\" but is more commonly ignored, with the numerator read out as a whole number. (For example, {{sfrac|3|1}} may be described as \"three wholes\" or as simply \"three\".) When the numerator is one, it may be omitted. (For example, \"a tenth\" or \"each quarter\".)\n\nThe entire fraction may be expressed as a single composition, in which case it is hyphenated, or as a number of fractions with a numerator of one, in which case they are not. (For example, \"two-fifths\" is the fraction {{sfrac|2|5}} and \"two fifths\" is the same fraction understood as 2 instances of {{fract|1|5}}.) Fractions should always be hyphenated when used as adjectives. Alternatively, a fraction may be described by reading it out as the numerator \"over\" the denominator, with the denominator expressed as a [[cardinal number]]. (For example, {{sfrac|3|1}} may also be expressed as \"three over one\".) The term \"over\" is used even in the case of solidus fractions, where the numbers are placed left and right of a [[slash mark]]. (For example, 1/2 may be read \"one-half\", \"one half\", or \"one over two\".) Fractions with large denominators that are ''not'' powers of ten are often rendered in this fashion (e.g., {{sfrac|1|117}} as \"one over one hundred seventeen\") while those with denominators divisible by ten are typically read in the normal ordinal fashion (e.g., {{sfrac|6|1000000}} as \"six-millionths\", \"six millionths\", or \"six one-millionths\").\n\n==Forms of fractions==\n===Simple, common, or vulgar fractions===\nA '''simple fraction''' (also known as a '''common fraction''' or '''vulgar fraction''') is a [[rational number]] written as ''a''/''b'' or <math>\\tfrac{a}{b}</math>, where ''a'' and ''b'' are both [[integers]].<ref>{{MathWorld |title=Common Fraction |id=CommonFraction}}</ref> As with other fractions, the denominator (''b'') cannot be zero. Examples include <math>\\tfrac{1}{2}</math>, <math>-\\tfrac{8}{5}</math>, <math>\\tfrac{-8}{5}</math>, and <math>\\tfrac{8}{-5}</math>. ''Simple fractions'' can be positive or negative, and they can be proper or improper (see below). Compound fractions, complex fractions, mixed numerals, and decimals (see below) are not ''simple fractions;'' though, unless irrational, they can be evaluated to a simple fraction.\n* A [[unit fraction]] is a common fraction with a numerator of 1, e.g. <math>\\tfrac{1}{7}</math>. Unit fractions can also be expressed using negative exponents, as in 2<sup>\u22121</sup>, which represents 1/2, and 2<sup>\u22122</sup>, which represents 1/(2<sup>2</sup>) or 1/4.\n* A [[Dyadic rational|dyadic fraction]] is a common fraction in which the denominator is a [[power of two]], e.g. <math>\\tfrac{1}{8}=\\tfrac{1}{2^3}</math>.\n\n===Proper and improper fractions===\nCommon fractions can be classified as either proper or improper. When the numerator and the denominator are both positive, the fraction is called proper if the numerator is less than the denominator, and improper otherwise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-vul1.htm|title=World Wide Words: Vulgar fractions|work=World Wide Words|accessdate=2014-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030183347/http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-vul1.htm|archive-date=2014-10-30|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{MathWorld |title=Improper Fraction |id=ImproperFraction}}</ref> In general, a common fraction is said to be a '''proper fraction''' if the [[absolute value]] of the fraction is strictly less than one\u2014that is, if the fraction is greater than \u22121 and less than 1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/65128.html|title=Math Forum \u2013 Ask Dr. Math:Can Negative Fractions Also Be Proper or Improper?|author=Laurel|date=31 March 2004|publisher=|accessdate=2014-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109010850/http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/65128.html|archive-date=9 November 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.necompact.org/ea/gle_support/Math/resources_number/prop_fraction.htm|title=New England Compact Math Resources|publisher=|access-date=2011-12-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415053421/http://www.necompact.org/ea/gle_support/Math/resources_number/prop_fraction.htm|archive-date=2012-04-15|url-status=dead}}</ref> It is said to be an '''improper fraction''', or sometimes '''top-heavy fraction''',<ref>{{cite book|last1=Greer|first1=A.|title=New comprehensive mathematics for 'O' level|date=1986|publisher=Thornes|location=Cheltenham|isbn=978-0-85950-159-0|page=5|edition=2nd ed., reprinted.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wX2dxeDahAwC&pg=PA5|accessdate=2014-07-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119204758/https://books.google.com/books?id=wX2dxeDahAwC&pg=PA5|archive-date=2019-01-19|url-status=live}}</ref> if the absolute value of the fraction is greater than or equal to 1. Examples of proper fractions are 2/3, \u20133/4, and 4/9; examples of improper fractions are 9/4, \u20134/3, and 3/3.\n\n===Reciprocals and the \"invisible denominator\"===\nThe '''reciprocal''' of a fraction is another fraction with the numerator and denominator exchanged. The reciprocal of <math>\\tfrac{3}{7}</math>, for instance, is <math>\\tfrac{7}{3}</math>. The product of a fraction and its reciprocal is 1, hence the reciprocal is the [[multiplicative inverse]] of a fraction. The reciprocal of a proper fraction is improper, and the reciprocal of an improper fraction not equal to 1 (that is, numerator and denominator are not equal) is a proper fraction.\n\nWhen the numerator and denominator of a fraction are equal (<math>\\tfrac{7}{7}</math>, for example), its value is 1, and the fraction therefore is improper. Its reciprocal also has the value 1, and is improper, too.\n\nAny integer can be written as a fraction with the number one as denominator. For example, 17 can be written as <math>\\tfrac{17}{1}</math>, where 1 is sometimes referred to as the ''invisible denominator''. Therefore, every fraction or integer, except for zero, has a reciprocal. The reciprocal of 17 is <math>\\tfrac{1}{17}</math>.\n\n===Ratios===\nA [[ratio]] is a relationship between two or more numbers that can be sometimes expressed as a fraction. Typically, a number of items are grouped and compared in a ratio, specifying numerically the relationship between each group. Ratios are expressed as \"group 1 to group 2 ... to group ''n''\". For example, if a car lot had 12 vehicles, of which\n* 2 are white,\n* 6 are red, and\n* 4 are yellow,\n\nthen the ratio of red to white to yellow cars is 6 to 2 to 4. The ratio of yellow cars to white cars is 4 to 2 and may be expressed as 4:2 or 2:1.\n\nA ratio is often converted to a fraction when it is expressed as a ratio to the whole. In the above example, the ratio of yellow cars to all the cars on the lot is 4:12 or 1:3. We can convert these ratios to a fraction and say that 4/12 of the cars or \u2153 of the cars in the lot are yellow. Therefore, if a person randomly chose one car on the lot, then there is a one in three chance or [[probability]] that it would be yellow.\n\n===Decimal fractions and percentages===\nA '''[[decimal fraction]]''' is a fraction whose denominator is not given explicitly, but is understood to be an integer power of ten. Decimal fractions are commonly expressed using decimal notation in which the implied denominator is determined by the number of [[Numerical digit|digits]] to the right of a [[decimal separator]], the appearance of which (e.g., a period, a raised period (\u2022), a comma) depends on the locale (for examples, see [[Decimal separator#Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system|decimal separator]]). Thus for 0.75 the numerator is 75 and the implied denominator is 10 to the second power, ''viz.'' 100, because there are two digits to the right of the decimal separator. In decimal numbers greater than 1 (such as 3.75), the [[fractional part]] of the number is expressed by the digits to the right of the decimal (with a value of 0.75 in this case). 3.75 can be written either as an improper fraction, 375/100, or as a mixed number, <math>3\\tfrac{75}{100}</math>.\n\nDecimal fractions can also be expressed using [[scientific notation]] with negative exponents, such as {{val|6.023|e=-7}}, which represents 0.0000006023. The {{val|e=-7}} represents a denominator of {{val|e=7}}. Dividing by {{val|e=7}} moves the decimal point 7 places to the left.\n\nDecimal fractions with infinitely many digits to the right of the decimal separator represent an [[infinite series]]. For example, {{sfrac|1|3}} = 0.333... represents the infinite series 3/10 + 3/100 + 3/1000 + ... .\n\nAnother kind of fraction is the [[percentage]] (Latin ''per centum'' meaning \"per hundred\", represented by the symbol %), in which the implied denominator is always 100. Thus, 51% means 51/100. Percentages greater than 100 or less than zero are treated in the same way, e.g. 311% equals 311/100, and \u221227% equals \u221227/100.\n\nThe related concept of ''[[permille]]'' or ''parts per thousand'' (ppt) has an implied denominator of 1000, while the more general [[parts-per notation]], as in 75 ''parts per million'' (ppm), means that the proportion is 75/1,000,000.\n\nWhether common fractions or decimal fractions are used is often a matter of taste and context. Common fractions are used most often when the denominator is relatively small. By [[mental calculation]], it is easier to multiply 16 by 3/16 than to do the same calculation using the fraction's decimal equivalent (0.1875). And it is more [[accurate]] to multiply 15 by 1/3, for example, than it is to multiply 15 by any decimal approximation of one third. Monetary values are commonly expressed as decimal fractions with denominator 100, i.e., with two decimals, for example $3.75. However, as noted above, in pre-decimal British currency, shillings and pence were often given the form (but not the meaning) of a fraction, as, for example 3/6 (read \"three and six\") meaning 3 shillings and 6 pence, and having no relationship to the fraction 3/6.\n\n==={{anchor|Mixed numbers}}Mixed numbers===\nA '''mixed numeral''' (also called a ''mixed fraction'' or ''mixed number'') is a traditional denotation of the sum of a non-zero integer and a proper fraction (having the same sign). It is used primarily in measurement: <math>2\\tfrac{3}{16}</math>inches, for example. Scientific measurements almost invariably use decimal notation rather than mixed numbers. The sum is implied without the use of a visible operator such as the appropriate \"+\". For example, in referring to two entire cakes and three quarters of another cake, the numerals denoting the integer part and the fractional part of the cakes are written next to each other as <math>2\\tfrac{3}{4}</math>instead of the unambiguous notation <math>2+\\tfrac{3}{4}.</math> Negative mixed numerals, as in <math>-2\\tfrac{3}{4}</math>, are treated like <math> -(2+\\tfrac{3}{4}).</math> Any such sum of a ''whole'' plus a ''part'' can be converted to an [[improper fraction]] by applying the rules of [[Fraction (mathematics)#Adding unlike quantities|adding unlike quantities]].\n\nThis tradition is, formally, in conflict with the notation in algebra where adjacent factors, without an explicit [[infix operator]], denote a product. When two algebraic expressions are written next to each other, the operation of multiplication is implied by this general rule: <math>2x</math>always means the product of <math>2</math> and <math display=\"inline\">x</math>, even if the value of <math>x</math> is a fraction. The expression <math> 2 \\tfrac{b}{c} </math> for example is not a mixed number; instead, multiplication is expressly required, where <math> 2 \\tfrac{b}{c} = 2 \\cdot \\tfrac{b}{c}.</math>\n\nFor better readability, the multiplication is sometimes made explicit or parentheses are added. So, <math> 2 \\tfrac{b}{c}</math> may be written as\n\n: <math> 2 \\cdot \\tfrac{b}{c},\\quad</math> or <math>\\quad 2 \\times \\tfrac{b}{c},\\quad</math> or <math> \\quad 2 \\left(\\tfrac{b}{c}\\right),\\;\\ldots</math>\n\nAn improper fraction can be converted to a mixed number as follows:\n\n# Using [[Euclidean division]] (division with remainder), divide the numerator by the denominator. In the example, <math>\\tfrac{11}{4}</math>, divide 11 by 4. 11 \u00f7 4 = 2 remainder 3.\n# The [[quotient]] (without the remainder) becomes the whole number part of the mixed number. The remainder becomes the numerator of the fractional part. In the example, 2 is the whole number part and 3 is the numerator of the fractional part.\n# The new denominator is the same as the denominator of the improper fraction. In the example, it is 4. Thus <math>\\tfrac{11}{4} =2\\tfrac{3}{4}</math>.\n\n===Historical notions===\n====Egyptian fraction====\nAn [[Egyptian fraction]] is the sum of distinct positive unit fractions, for example <math>\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{1}{3}</math>. This definition derives from the fact that the [[ancient Egypt]]ians expressed all fractions except <math>\\tfrac{1}{2}</math>, <math>\\tfrac{2}{3}</math> and <math>\\tfrac{3}{4}</math> in this manner. Every positive rational number can be expanded as an Egyptian fraction. For example, <math>\\tfrac{5}{7}</math> can be written as <math>\\tfrac{1}{2} + \\tfrac{1}{6} + \\tfrac{1}{21}.</math> Any positive rational number can be written as a sum of unit fractions in infinitely many ways. Two ways to write <math>\\tfrac{13}{17}</math> are <math>\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{1}{4}+\\tfrac{1}{68}</math> and <math>\\tfrac{1}{3}+\\tfrac{1}{4}+\\tfrac{1}{6}+\\tfrac{1}{68}</math>.\n\n===='Complex' and 'Compound' fractions====\nThe notions \u2018complex fraction\u2019 and \u2018compound fraction\u2019 are both outdated<ref>https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/complex-fraction {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201182513/https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/complex-fraction |date=2017-12-01 }} et al.</ref> and nowadays used in no well-defined manner, partly even taken synonymously for each other<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/complex-fraction |title=Complex fraction definition and meaning |publisher=Collins English Dictionary |date=2018-03-09 |accessdate=2018-03-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201182513/https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/complex-fraction |archive-date=2017-12-01 |url-status=live }}</ref> or for mixed numerals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sosmath.com/algebra/fraction/frac5/frac5.html |title=Compound Fractions |publisher=Sosmath.com |date=1996-02-05 |accessdate=2018-03-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314105714/http://www.sosmath.com/algebra/fraction/frac5/frac5.html |archive-date=2018-03-14 |url-status=live }}</ref> They lost their meaning as technical terms and the attributes \"complex\" and \"compound\" tend to be used in their every day meaning of \"consisting of parts\".\n* Complex fractions\n::''Not to be confused with [[Division of complex numbers|fractions involving complex numbers]]\nIn a '''complex fraction''', either the numerator, or the denominator, or both, is a fraction or a mixed number,<ref name=\"Trotter\">{{cite book|last=Trotter|first=James|title=A complete system of arithmetic|page=65|year=1853|url=https://books.google.com/?id=a0sDAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA65&dq=%2B%22complex+fraction%22+%2B%22compound+fraction%22#v=onepage&q=%22complex%20fraction%22&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\"Barlow\">{{cite book|last=Barlow|first=Peter|title=A new mathematical and philosophical dictionary|year=1814|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BBowAAAAYAAJ&pg=PT329&dq=%2B%22complex+fraction%22+%2B%22compound+fraction%22#v=onepage&q=%2B%22complex%20fraction%22%20%2B%22compound%20fraction%22&f=false}}</ref> corresponding to division of fractions.

So 5/10/20/40 is not a valid mathematical expression, because of multiple possible interpretations, e.g. as\n:<math>5/(10/(20/40)) = \\frac{5}{10/\\tfrac{20}{40}} = \\frac{1}{4}\\quad</math> or as <math>\\quad (5/10)/(20/40) = \\frac{\\tfrac{5}{10}}{\\tfrac{20}{40}} = 1</math>\n* Compound fractions\nA '''compound fraction''' is a fraction of a fraction, or any number of fractions connected with the word ''of'',<ref name=\"Trotter\" /><ref name=\"Barlow\" /> corresponding to multiplication of fractions. To reduce a compound fraction to a simple fraction, just carry out the multiplication (see the section on [[#Multiplication|multiplication]]). For example, <math>\\tfrac{3}{4}</math> of <math>\\tfrac{5}{7}</math> is a compound fraction, corresponding to <math>\\tfrac{3}{4} \\times \\tfrac{5}{7} = \\tfrac{15}{28}</math>. The terms compound fraction and complex fraction are closely related and sometimes one is used as a synonym for the other. (For example, the compound fraction <math>\\tfrac{3}{4} \\times \\tfrac{5}{7}</math> is equivalent to the complex fraction <math>\\tfrac{3/4}{7/5}</math>.)\n\n==Arithmetic with fractions==\nLike whole numbers, fractions obey the [[commutative]], [[associative]], and [[distributive property|distributive]] laws, and the rule against [[division by zero]].\n\n===Equivalent fractions===\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same (non-zero) number results in a fraction that is equivalent to the original fraction. This is true because for any non-zero number <math>n</math>, the fraction <math>\\tfrac{n}{n} = 1</math>. Therefore, multiplying by <math>\\tfrac{n}{n}</math>is equivalent to multiplying by one, and any number multiplied by one has the same value as the original number. By way of an example, start with the fraction <math>\\tfrac{1}{2}</math>. When the numerator and denominator are both multiplied by 2, the result is <math>\\tfrac{2}{4}</math>, which has the same value (0.5) as <math>\\tfrac{1}{2}</math>. To picture this visually, imagine cutting a cake into four pieces; two of the pieces together (<math>\\tfrac{2}{4}</math>) make up half the cake (<math>\\tfrac{1}{2}</math>).\n\n====Simplifying (Reducing) fractions====\n\nDividing the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same non-zero number will also yield an equivalent fraction. If the numerator and the denominator of a fraction are both divisible by a number (called a factor) greater than 1, then the fraction can be reduced to an equal fraction with a smaller numerator and a smaller denominator. To do this, the [[greatest common factor]] is identified, and both the numerator and the denominator are divided by this factor. For example, if both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction <math>\\tfrac{a}{b}</math>are divisible by <math>c,</math> then they can be written as <math>a=cd</math> and <math>b=ce,</math> so the fraction becomes <math>\\tfrac{cd}{ce}</math>, which can be reduced by dividing both the numerator and denominator by <math>c</math> to give the reduced fraction <math>\\tfrac{d}{e}.</math>\n\nIf the numerator and the denominator do not share any factor greater than 1, then the fraction is said to be irreducible, in lowest terms, or in simplest terms. For example, <math>\\tfrac{3}{9}</math>is not in lowest terms because both 3 and 9 can be exactly divided by 3. In contrast, <math>\\tfrac{3}{8}</math> ''is'' in lowest terms\u2014the only positive integer that goes into both 3 and 8 evenly is 1.\n\nUsing these rules, we can show that <math>\\tfrac{5}{10}</math>= <math>\\tfrac{1}{2}</math>= <math>\\tfrac{10}{20}</math>= <math>\\tfrac{50}{100}</math>.\n\nAs another example, since the greatest common divisor of 63 and 462 is 21, the fraction <math>\\tfrac{63}{462}</math>can be reduced to lowest terms by dividing the numerator and denominator by 21:\n:<math>\\tfrac{63}{462} = \\tfrac{63 \\div 21}{462 \\div 21}= \\tfrac{3}{22}</math>\n\nThe [[Euclidean algorithm]] gives a method for finding the greatest common divisor of any two positive integers.\n\n===Comparing fractions===\nComparing fractions with the same positive denominator yields the same result as comparing the numerators:\n\n:<math>\\tfrac{3}{4}>\\tfrac{2}{4}</math> because {{nowrap|3 &gt; 2}}, and the equal denominators <math>4</math> are positive.\n\nIf the equal denominators are negative, then the opposite result of comparing the numerators holds for the fractions:\n\n:<math>\\tfrac{3}{-4}<\\tfrac{2}{-4}</math> because <math>\\tfrac{a}{-b}= \\tfrac{-a}{b}</math> and <math>-3 < -2</math>.\n\nIf two positive fractions have the same numerator, then the fraction with the smaller denominator is the larger number. When a whole is divided into equal pieces, if fewer equal pieces are needed to make up the whole, then each piece must be larger. When two positive fractions have the same numerator, they represent the same number of parts, but in the fraction with the smaller denominator, the parts are larger.\n\nOne way to compare fractions with different numerators and denominators is to find a common denominator. To compare <math>\\tfrac{a}{b}</math> and <math>\\tfrac{c}{d}</math>, these are converted to <math>\\tfrac{a\\cdot d}{b\\cdot d}</math> and <math>\\tfrac{b\\cdot c}{b\\cdot d}</math> (where the dot signifies multiplication and is an alternative symbol to \u00d7). Then ''bd'' is a common denominator and the numerators ''ad'' and ''bc'' can be compared. It is not necessary to determine the value of the common denominator to compare fractions \u2013 one can just compare ''ad'' and ''bc'', without evaluating ''bd'', e.g., comparing <math>\\tfrac{2}{3}</math> ? <math>\\tfrac{1}{2}</math> gives <math>\\tfrac{4}{6}>\\tfrac{3}{6}</math>.\n\nFor the more laborious question <math>\\tfrac{5}{18}</math> ? <math>\\tfrac{4}{17},</math> multiply top and bottom of each fraction by the denominator of the other fraction, to get a common denominator, yielding <math>\\tfrac{5 \\times 17}{18 \\times 17}</math> ? <math>\\tfrac{18 \\times 4}{18 \\times 17}</math>. It is not necessary to calculate <math>18 \\times 17</math> \u2013 only the numerators need to be compared. Since 5\u00d717 (=&nbsp;85) is greater than 4\u00d718 (=&nbsp;72), the result of comparing is <math>\\tfrac{5}{18}>\\tfrac{4}{17}</math>.\n\nBecause every negative number, including negative fractions, is less than zero, and every positive number, including positive fractions, is greater than zero, it follows that any negative fraction is less than any positive fraction. This allows, together with the above rules, to compare all possible fractions.\n\n===Addition===\nThe first rule of addition is that only like quantities can be added; for example, various quantities of quarters. Unlike quantities, such as adding thirds to quarters, must first be converted to like quantities as described below: Imagine a pocket containing two quarters, and another pocket containing three quarters; in total, there are five quarters. Since four quarters is equivalent to one (dollar), this can be represented as follows:\n:<math>\\tfrac24+\\tfrac34=\\tfrac54=1\\tfrac14</math>.\n\n[[File:Cake fractions.svg|thumb|right|270px|If <math>\\tfrac12</math> of a cake is to be added to <math>\\tfrac14</math> of a cake, the pieces need to be converted into comparable quantities, such as cake-eighths or cake-quarters.]]\n\n====Adding unlike quantities====\nTo add fractions containing unlike quantities (e.g. quarters and thirds), it is necessary to convert all amounts to like quantities. It is easy to work out the chosen type of fraction to convert to; simply multiply together the two denominators (bottom number) of each fraction. In case of an integer number apply the [[Fraction (mathematics)#Reciprocals and the \"invisible denominator\"|invisible denominator]] <math>1.</math>\n\nFor adding quarters to thirds, both types of fraction are converted to twelfths, thus:\n\n: <math>\\frac14\\ + \\frac13=\\frac{1\\times3}{4\\times3}\\ + \\frac{1\\times4}{3\\times4}=\\frac3{12}\\ + \\frac4{12}=\\frac7{12}.</math>\n\nConsider adding the following two quantities:\n:<math>\\frac35+\\frac23</math>\nFirst, convert <math>\\tfrac35</math> into fifteenths by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by three: <math>\\tfrac35\\times\\tfrac33=\\tfrac9{15}</math>. Since <math>\\tfrac33</math> equals 1, multiplication by <math>\\tfrac33</math> does not change the value of the fraction.\n\nSecond, convert <math>\\tfrac23</math> into fifteenths by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by five: <math>\\tfrac23\\times\\tfrac55=\\tfrac{10}{15}</math>.\n\nNow it can be seen that:\n\n:<math>\\frac35+\\frac23</math>\n\nis equivalent to:\n\n:<math>\\frac9{15}+\\frac{10}{15}=\\frac{19}{15}=1\\frac4{15}</math>\n\nThis method can be expressed algebraically:\n:<math>\\frac{a}{b} + \\frac {c}{d} = \\frac{ad+cb}{bd}</math>\n\nThis algebraic method always works, thereby guaranteeing that the sum of simple fractions is always again a simple fraction. However, if the single denominators contain a common factor, a smaller denominator than the product of these can be used. For example, when adding <math>\\tfrac{3}{4}</math> and <math>\\tfrac{5}{6}</math> the single denominators have a common factor <math>2,</math> and therefore, instead of the denominator 24 (4&thinsp;\u00d7&thinsp;6), the halved denominator 12 may be used, not only reducing the denominator in the result, but also the factors in the numerator.\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\frac34+\\frac56 &= \\frac{3\\cdot 6}{4\\cdot 6}+\\frac{4 \\cdot 5}{4\\cdot 6}=\\frac{18}{24} + \\frac{20}{24}&=\\frac{19}{12}\\\\\n&=\\frac{3\\cdot 3}{4\\cdot 3}+\\frac{2\\cdot 5}{2\\cdot 6} =\\frac{9}{12} + \\frac{10}{12}&=\\frac{19}{12}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe smallest possible denominator is given by the [[least common multiple]] of the single denominators, which results from dividing the rote multiple by all common factors of the single denominators. This is called the least common denominator.\n\n===Subtraction===\nThe process for subtracting fractions is, in essence, the same as that of adding them: find a common denominator, and change each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the chosen common denominator. The resulting fraction will have that denominator, and its numerator will be the result of subtracting the numerators of the original fractions. For instance,\n\n:<math>\\tfrac23-\\tfrac12=\\tfrac46-\\tfrac36=\\tfrac16</math>\n\n===Multiplication===\n====Multiplying a fraction by another fraction====\nTo multiply fractions, multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators. Thus:\n\n:<math>\\tfrac{2}{3} \\times \\tfrac{3}{4} = \\tfrac{6}{12}</math>\n\nTo explain the process, consider one third of one quarter. Using the example of a cake, if three small slices of equal size make up a quarter, and four quarters make up a whole, twelve of these small, equal slices make up a whole. Therefore, a third of a quarter is a twelfth. Now consider the numerators. The first fraction, two thirds, is twice as large as one third. Since one third of a quarter is one twelfth, two thirds of a quarter is two twelfth. The second fraction, three quarters, is three times as large as one quarter, so two thirds of three quarters is three times as large as two thirds of one quarter. Thus two thirds times three quarters is six twelfths.\n\nA short cut for multiplying fractions is called \"cancellation\". Effectively the answer is reduced to lowest terms during multiplication. For example:\n\n:<math>\\tfrac{2}{3} \\times \\tfrac{3}{4} = \\tfrac{\\cancel{2} ^{~1}}{\\cancel{3} ^{~1}} \\times \\tfrac{\\cancel{3} ^{~1}}{\\cancel{4} ^{~2}} = \\tfrac{1}{1} \\times \\tfrac{1}{2} = \\tfrac{1}{2}</math>\n\nA two is a common [[Divisor|factor]] in both the numerator of the left fraction and the denominator of the right and is divided out of both. Three is a common factor of the left denominator and right numerator and is divided out of both.\n\n====Multiplying a fraction by a whole number====\nSince a whole number can be rewritten as itself divided by 1, normal fraction multiplication rules can still apply.\n\n:<math>6 \\times \\tfrac{3}{4} = \\tfrac{6}{1} \\times \\tfrac{3}{4} = \\tfrac{18}{4}</math> This method works because the fraction 6/1 means six equal parts, each one of which is a whole.\n\n====Multiplying mixed numbers====\nWhen multiplying mixed numbers, it is considered preferable {{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} to convert the mixed number into an improper fraction. For example:\n\n:<math>3 \\times 2\\tfrac{3}{4} = 3 \\times \\left (\\tfrac{8}{4} + \\tfrac{3}{4} \\right ) = 3 \\times \\tfrac{11}{4} = \\tfrac{33}{4} = 8\\tfrac{1}{4}</math>\n\nIn other words, <math>2\\tfrac{3}{4}</math> is the same as <math>\\tfrac{8}{4} + \\tfrac{3}{4}</math>, making 11 quarters in total (because 2 cakes, each split into quarters makes 8 quarters total) and 33 quarters is <math>8\\tfrac{1}{4}</math>, since 8 cakes, each made of quarters, is 32 quarters in total.\n\n===Division===\nTo divide a fraction by a whole number, you may either divide the numerator by the number, if it goes evenly into the numerator, or multiply the denominator by the number. For example, <math>\\tfrac{10}{3} \\div 5</math> equals <math>\\tfrac{2}{3}</math> and also equals <math>\\tfrac{10}{3 \\cdot 5} = \\tfrac{10}{15}</math>, which reduces to <math>\\tfrac{2}{3}</math>. To divide a number by a fraction, multiply that number by the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of that fraction. Thus, <math>\\tfrac{1}{2} \\div \\tfrac{3}{4} = \\tfrac{1}{2} \\times \\tfrac{4}{3} = \\tfrac{1 \\cdot 4}{2 \\cdot 3} = \\tfrac{2}{3}</math>.\n\n===\n\n==Fractions in abstract mathematics==\nIn addition to being of great practical importance, fractions are also studied by mathematicians, who check that the rules for fractions given above are [[well defined|consistent and reliable]]. Mathematicians define a fraction as an ordered pair <math>(a,b)</math>of [[integer]]s <math>a</math>and <math>b \\ne 0,</math> for which the operations [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], and [[division (mathematics)|division]] are defined as follows:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Fraction |title=Fraction |publisher=Encyclopedia of Mathematics |date=2012-04-06 |accessdate=2012-08-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021043927/http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Fraction |archive-date=2014-10-21 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n:<math>(a,b) + (c,d) = (ad+bc,bd) \\,</math>\n\n:<math>(a,b) - (c,d) = (ad-bc,bd) \\,</math>\n\n:<math>(a,b) \\cdot (c,d) = (ac,bd)</math>\n\n:<math>(a,b) \\div (c,d) = (ad,bc) \\quad(\\text{with, additionally, } c \\ne 0) </math>\n\nThese definitions agree in every case with the definitions given above; only the notation is different. Alternatively, instead of defining subtraction and division as operations, the \"inverse\" fractions with respect to addition and multiplication might be defined as:\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{llrrl}\n     &-(a,b) &= &(-a, b) &\\quad \\text{additive inverse fractions,} \\\\\n      &&&&\\quad\\text{with } (0,b) \\text{ as additive unities, and}\\\\\n     &\\;\\;\\ (a,b)^{-1} &= &(b,a) &\\quad \\text{multiplicative inverse fractions, for } a \\ne 0, \\\\\n      &&&&\\quad\\text{with } (b,b) \\text{ as multiplicative unities}.\n   \\end{array}</math>\n\nFurthermore, the [[Relation (mathematics)|relation]], specified as\n:<math>(a, b) \\sim (c, d)\\quad \\iff \\quad ad=bc,</math>\n\nis an [[equivalence relation]] of fractions. Each fraction from one equivalence class may be considered as a representative for the whole class, and each whole class may be considered as one abstract fraction. This equivalence is preserved by the above defined operations, i.e., the results of operating on fractions are independent of the selection of representatives from their equivalence class. Formally, for addition of fractions\n:<math>(a,b) \\sim (a',b')\\quad</math> and <math>\\quad (c,d) \\sim (c',d') \\quad</math> imply\n::<math>((a,b) + (c,d)) \\sim ((a',b') + (c',d'))</math>\n\nand similarly for the other operations.\n\nIn case of fractions of integers the fractions with <math>(a,b)</math>coprime are often taken as uniquely determined representatives for their ''equivalent'' fractions, which are considered to be the ''same'' rational number. This way the fractions of integers make up the field of the rational numbers.\n\nMore generally, ''a'' and ''b'' may be elements of any [[integral domain]] ''R'', in which case a fraction is an element of the [[field of fractions]] of ''R''. For example, [[polynomial]]s in one indeterminate, with coefficients from some integral domain ''D'', are themselves an integral domain, call it ''P''. So for ''a'' and ''b'' elements of ''P'', the generated ''field of fractions'' is the field of [[rational fraction]]s (also known as the field of [[rational function]]s).\n\n==Algebraic fractions==\n{{Main|Algebraic fraction}}\nAn algebraic fraction is the indicated [[quotient]] of two [[algebraic expression]]s. As with fractions of integers, the denominator of an algebraic fraction cannot be zero. Two examples of algebraic fractions are <math>\\frac{3x}{x^2+2x-3}</math> and <math>\\frac{\\sqrt{x+2}}{x^2-3}</math>. Algebraic fractions are subject to the same [[field (mathematics)|field properties]] as arithmetic fractions.\n\nIf the numerator and the denominator are [[polynomial]]s, as in <math>\\frac{3x}{x^2+2x-3}</math>, the algebraic fraction is called a '''rational fraction''' (or '''rational expression'''). An '''irrational fraction''' is one that is not rational, as, for example, one that contains the variable under a fractional exponent or root, as in <math>\\frac{\\sqrt{x+2}}{x^2-3}</math>.\n\nThe terminology used to describe algebraic fractions is similar to that used for ordinary fractions. For example, an algebraic fraction is in lowest terms if the only factors common to the numerator and the denominator are 1 and \u22121. An algebraic fraction whose numerator or denominator, or both, contain a fraction, such as <math>\\frac{1 + \\tfrac{1}{x}}{1 - \\tfrac{1}{x}}</math>, is called a '''complex fraction'''.\n\nThe field of rational numbers is the [[field of fractions]] of the integers, while the integers themselves are not a field but rather an [[integral domain]]. Similarly, the [[Rational fraction|rational expressions]] are the field of fractions of [[polynomial]]s. There are different integral domains of polynomials, depending on the integral domain the [[coefficient]]s of the polynomials are from (e.g. from integers, [[real numbers]], [[complex numbers]], ...). Considering the field of fractions generated by polynomials with real coefficients, [[radical expression]]s such as <math>\\textstyle \\sqrt{2}/2</math>are also rational fractions, as is the transcendental expression <math display=\"inline\">\\pi/2</math>, since all of <math>\\sqrt{2},\\pi,</math>and <math>2</math>are (constant) polynomials over the ''reals''. These same expressions, however, would not be considered elements of the field of fractions generated by polynomials with ''integer'' coefficients. This specific field would contain just the <math>2</math>of the three polynomials above, or <math>1/2</math>as fraction, but no radical or transcendental expressions.\n\nThe term [[partial fraction]] is used when decomposing rational expressions into sums. The goal is to write the rational expression as the sum of other rational expressions with denominators of lesser degree. For example, the rational expression <math>\\frac{2x}{x^2-1}</math> can be rewritten as the sum of two fractions: <math>\\frac{1}{x+1} + \\frac{1}{x-1}</math>. This is useful in many areas such as integral calculus and differential equations.\n\n==Radical expressions==\n{{Main|Nth root|Rationalization (mathematics)}}\nA fraction may also contain [[Nth root|radicals]] in the numerator and/or the denominator. If the denominator contains radicals, it can be helpful to [[Rationalisation (mathematics)|rationalize]] it (compare [[Nth root#Simplified form of a radical expression|Simplified form of a radical expression]]), especially if further operations, such as adding or comparing that fraction to another, are to be carried out. It is also more convenient if division is to be done manually. When the denominator is a [[monomial]] square root, it can be rationalized by multiplying both the top and the bottom of the fraction by the denominator:\n\n: <math>\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{7}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{7}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{\\sqrt{7}} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{7}}{7}</math>\n\nThe process of rationalization of [[binomial (polynomial)|binomial]] denominators involves multiplying the top and the bottom of a fraction by the [[Conjugate (algebra)|conjugate]] of the denominator so that the denominator becomes a rational number. For example:\n\n:<math>\\frac{3}{3-2\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{3}{3-2\\sqrt{5}} \\cdot \\frac{3+2\\sqrt{5}}{3+2\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{3(3+2\\sqrt{5})}{{3}^2 - (2\\sqrt{5})^2} = \\frac{ 3 (3 + 2\\sqrt{5} ) }{ 9 - 20 } = - \\frac{ 9+6 \\sqrt{5} }{11}</math>\n:<math>\\frac{3}{3+2\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{3}{3+2\\sqrt{5}} \\cdot \\frac{3-2\\sqrt{5}}{3-2\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{3(3-2\\sqrt{5})}{{3}^2 - (2\\sqrt{5})^2} = \\frac{ 3 (3 - 2\\sqrt{5} ) }{ 9 - 20 } = - \\frac{ 9-6 \\sqrt{5} }{11}</math>\n\nEven if this process results in the numerator being irrational, like in the examples above, the process may still facilitate subsequent manipulations by reducing the number of irrationals one has to work with in the denominator.\n\n==Typographical variations==\nIn computer displays and [[typography]], simple fractions are sometimes printed as a single character, e.g. \u00bd ([[one half]]). See the article on [[Number Forms]] for information on doing this in [[Unicode]].\n\nScientific publishing distinguishes four ways to set fractions, together with guidelines on use:<ref name=\"galen\">{{Cite journal | title = Putting Fractions in Their Place | first = Leslie Blackwell | last = Galen | journal = [[American Mathematical Monthly]] | date = March 2004 | volume = 111 | pages = 238\u2013242 | number = 3 | doi = 10.2307/4145131 | url = http://www.integretechpub.com/research/papers/monthly238-242.pdf | jstor = 4145131 | access-date = 2010-01-27 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110713044149/http://www.integretechpub.com/research/papers/monthly238-242.pdf | archive-date = 2011-07-13 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n* '''special fractions:''' fractions that are presented as a single character with a slanted bar, with roughly the same height and width as other characters in the text.

These are not used in modern mathematical notation, but in other contexts.\n* '''case fractions:''' similar to special fractions, these are rendered as a single typographical character, but with a horizontal bar, thus making them ''upright''.

While the notation \"two shillings and six pence\" did not represent a fraction, the forward slash is now used in fractions, especially for fractions inline with prose (rather than displayed), to avoid uneven lines. It is also used for fractions within fractions ([[#Complex fractions|complex fractions]]) or within exponents to increase legibility.

Their methods gave the same answer as modern methods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://egyptianmath.blogspot.com|title=Math History|author=Milo Gardner|date=December 19, 2005|accessdate=2006-01-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219160259/http://egyptianmath.blogspot.com/|archive-date=December 19, 2005|url-status=live}} See for examples and an explanation.</ref> The Egyptians also had a different notation for [[dyadic fraction]]s in the [[Akhmim Wooden Tablet]] and several [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] problems.\n\nThe [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] used unit fractions and (later) continued fractions. [[Pythagoreans|Followers]] of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[Greek philosophy|philosopher]] [[Pythagoras]] ({{circa|lk=no|530}}&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}) discovered that the [[square root of two]] [[irrational numbers|cannot be expressed as a fraction of integers]].

The remaining three fourths are shown. Dotted lines indicate where the cake may be cut in order to divide it into equal parts. Each fourth of the cake is denoted by the fraction {{sfrac|1|4}}.]]\n\nA '''fraction''' (from [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|fractus}}'', \"broken\") represents a part of a whole or, more generally, any number of equal parts. When spoken in everyday English, a fraction describes how many parts of a certain size there are, for example, one-half, eight-fifths, three-quarters. A ''common'', ''vulgar'', or ''simple'' fraction (examples: <math>\\tfrac{1}{2}</math> and <math>\\tfrac{17}{3}</math>) consists of an [[integer]] numerator displayed above a line (or before a slash), and a non-zero integer denominator, displayed below (or after) that line. Numerators and denominators are also used in fractions that are not ''common'', including compound fractions, complex fractions, and mixed numerals.\n\nWe begin with positive common fractions, where the numerator and denominator are [[natural number]]s. The numerator represents a number of equal parts, and the denominator indicates how many of those parts make up a unit or a whole. The denominator cannot be zero because zero parts can never make up a whole. For example, in the fraction 3/4, the numerator, 3, tells us that the fraction represents 3 equal parts, and the denominator, 4, tells us that 4 parts make up a whole. The picture to the right illustrates <math>\\tfrac{3}{4}</math>or {{frac|3|4}} of a cake.\n\nA common fraction is a numeral which represents a [[rational number]]. That same number can also be represented as a decimal, a percent, or with a negative exponent. For example, 0.01, 1%, and 10<sup>\u22122</sup> all equal the fraction 1/100. An integer such as the number 7 can be thought of as having an implicit denominator of one: 7 equals 7/1.\n\nOther uses for fractions are to represent [[ratio]]s and [[division (mathematics)|division]].<ref>H. Wu, \"The Mis-Education of Mathematics Teachers\", ''Notices of the American Mathematical Society'', Volume 58, Issue 03 (March 2011), [http://www.ams.org/notices/201103/rtx110300372p.pdf#page374 page 374] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820101254/http://www.ams.org/notices/201103/rtx110300372p.pdf#page374 |date=2017-08-20 }}</ref> Thus the fraction {{sfrac|3|4}} is also used to represent the ratio 3:4 (the ratio of the part to the whole) and the division 3 \u00f7 4 (three divided by four). The non-zero denominator in the case using a fraction to represent division is an example of the rule that [[division by zero]] is undefined.\n\nWe can also write negative fractions, which represent the opposite of a positive fraction. For example, if {{sfrac|1|2}} represents a half dollar profit, then \u2212{{sfrac|1|2}} represents a half dollar loss. Because of the rules of division of signed numbers, which require that, for example, negative divided by positive is negative, \u2212{{sfrac|1|2}}, {{sfrac|-1|2}} and {{sfrac|1|-2}}, all represent the same fraction, negative one-half. Because a negative divided by a negative produces a positive, {{sfrac|-1|-2}} represents positive one-half.\n\nIn mathematics the set of all numbers that can be expressed in the form a/b, where a and b are [[integer]]s and b is not zero, is called the set of rational numbers and is represented by the symbol '''Q''', which stands for [[quotient]]. The test for a number being a rational number is that it can be written in that form (i.e., as a common fraction). However, the word ''fraction'' is also used to describe mathematical expressions that are not rational numbers, for example [[algebraic fraction]]s (quotients of algebraic expressions), and expressions that contain [[irrational number]]s, such as {{sqrt|2}}/2 (see [[square root of 2]]) and \u03c0/4 (see [[proof that \u03c0 is irrational]]).\n\n==Vocabulary<!--'Fraction bar' redirects here-->==\n{{See also|Numeral (linguistics)#Fractional numbers|English numerals#Fractions and decimals}}\nIn a fraction, the number of equal parts being described is the '''numerator''' (from [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|numer\u0101tor}}'', \"counter\" or \"numberer\"), and the type or variety of the parts is the '''denominator''' (from [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|d\u0113n\u014dmin\u0101tor}}'', \"thing that names or designates\").<!--both boldface per WP:R#PLA--><ref name=schwartzman>{{cite book |last=Schwartzman|first=Steven |title=The Words of Mathematics: An Etymological Dictionary of Mathematical Terms Used in English |url=https://archive.org/details/wordsofmathemati0000schw|url-access=registration|publisher=Mathematical Association of America |date=1994|isbn=978-0-88385-511-9 }}</ref> As an example, the fraction {{frac|8|5}} amounts to eight parts, each of which is of the type named \"fifth\".

The fraction bar may be horizontal (as in {{sfrac|1|3}}), oblique (as in 2/5), or diagonal (as in {{frac|4|9}}).<ref name=ambrose/> These marks are respectively known as the horizontal bar; the virgule, [[slash mark|slash]] ([[American English|US]]), or [[oblique stroke|stroke]] ([[British English|UK]]); and the fraction bar, solidus, or [[fraction slash]].{{refn|group=n|Some typographers such as [[Robert Bringhurst|Bringhurst]] mistakenly distinguish the slash {{angle brackets|[[/]]}} as the ''[[wikt:virgule|virgule]]'' and the fraction slash {{angle brackets|[[\u2044]]}} as the ''[[solidus mark|solidus]]'',<ref name=\"bringhurst\">{{cite book |last=Bringhurst |first=Robert |year=2002 |title=The Elements of Typographic Style |edition=3rd |publisher=Hartley & Marks |isbn=978-0-88179-206-5 |pages=81\u201382 |contribution=5.2.5: Use the Virgule with Words and Dates, the Solidus with Split-level Fractions |location=[[Point Roberts, Washington|Point Roberts]]}}</ref> although in fact both are synonyms for the standard slash.<ref name=verg>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=1st |title=virgule, ''n.'' |date=1917 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press }}</ref><ref name=oedsolid>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=1st |title=solidus, ''n.<sup>1</sup>'' |date=1913 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press }}</ref>}} In [[typography]], fractions stacked vertically are also known as \"[[en (typography)|en]]\" or \"[[en dash|nut]] fractions\", and diagonal ones as \"[[em (typography)|em]]\" or \"mutton fractions\", based on whether a fraction with a single-digit numerator and denominator occupies the proportion of a narrow ''en'' square, or a wider ''em'' square.<ref name=ambrose>{{cite book |last=Ambrose |first=Gavin |author2=Paul Harris |display-authors=1 |ref={{harvid|Ambrose & al.}} |p=[https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=IW9MAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA74 74] |url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=IW9MAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover |title=The Fundamentals of Typography |edition=2nd |publisher=AVA Publishing |location=Lausanne |date=2006 |isbn=978-2-940411-76-4 |access-date=2016-02-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304022742/https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=IW9MAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=live }}.</ref> In traditional typefounding, a piece of type bearing a complete fraction (e.g. {{sfrac|1|2}}) was known as a \"case fraction,\" while those representing only part of fraction were called \"piece fractions.\"\n\nThe denominators of English fractions are generally expressed as [[Ordinal number (linguistics)#Variations|ordinal numbers]], in the plural if the numerator is not one. (For example, {{frac|2|5}} and {{frac|3|5}} are both read as a number of \"fifths\".) Exceptions include the denominator 2, which is always read \"half\" or \"halves\", the denominator 4, which may be alternatively expressed as \"quarter\"/\"quarters\" or as \"fourth\"/\"fourths\", and the denominator 100, which may be alternatively expressed as \"hundredth\"/\"hundredths\" or \"[[percent]]\". When the denominator is 1, it may be expressed in terms of \"wholes\" but is more commonly ignored, with the numerator read out as a whole number. (For example, {{sfrac|3|1}} may be described as \"three wholes\" or as simply \"three\".) When the numerator is one, it may be omitted. (For example, \"a tenth\" or \"each quarter\".)\n\nThe entire fraction may be expressed as a single composition, in which case it is hyphenated, or as a number of fractions with a numerator of one, in which case they are not. (For example, \"two-fifths\" is the fraction {{sfrac|2|5}} and \"two fifths\" is the same fraction understood as 2 instances of {{fract|1|5}}.) Fractions should always be hyphenated when used as adjectives. Alternatively, a fraction may be described by reading it out as the numerator \"over\" the denominator, with the denominator expressed as a [[cardinal number]]. (For example, {{sfrac|3|1}} may also be expressed as \"three over one\".) The term \"over\" is used even in the case of solidus fractions, where the numbers are placed left and right of a [[slash mark]]. (For example, 1/2 may be read \"one-half\", \"one half\", or \"one over two\".) Fractions with large denominators that are ''not'' powers of ten are often rendered in this fashion (e.g., {{sfrac|1|117}} as \"one over one hundred seventeen\") while those with denominators divisible by ten are typically read in the normal ordinal fashion (e.g., {{sfrac|6|1000000}} as \"six-millionths\", \"six millionths\", or \"six one-millionths\").\n\n==Forms of fractions==\n===Simple, common, or vulgar fractions===\nA '''simple fraction''' (also known as a '''common fraction''' or '''vulgar fraction''') is a [[rational number]] written as ''a''/''b'' or <math>\\tfrac{a}{b}</math>, where ''a'' and ''b'' are both [[integers]].<ref>{{MathWorld |title=Common Fraction |id=CommonFraction}}</ref> As with other fractions, the denominator (''b'') cannot be zero. Examples include <math>\\tfrac{1}{2}</math>, <math>-\\tfrac{8}{5}</math>, <math>\\tfrac{-8}{5}</math>, and <math>\\tfrac{8}{-5}</math>. ''Simple fractions'' can be positive or negative, and they can be proper or improper (see below). Compound fractions, complex fractions, mixed numerals, and decimals (see below) are not ''simple fractions;'' though, unless irrational, they can be evaluated to a simple fraction.\n* A [[unit fraction]] is a common fraction with a numerator of 1, e.g. <math>\\tfrac{1}{7}</math>. Unit fractions can also be expressed using negative exponents, as in 2<sup>\u22121</sup>, which represents 1/2, and 2<sup>\u22122</sup>, which represents 1/(2<sup>2</sup>) or 1/4.\n* A [[Dyadic rational|dyadic fraction]] is a common fraction in which the denominator is a [[power of two]], e.g. <math>\\tfrac{1}{8}=\\tfrac{1}{2^3}</math>.\n\n===Proper and improper fractions===\nCommon fractions can be classified as either proper or improper. When the numerator and the denominator are both positive, the fraction is called proper if the numerator is less than the denominator, and improper otherwise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-vul1.htm|title=World Wide Words: Vulgar fractions|work=World Wide Words|accessdate=2014-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030183347/http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-vul1.htm|archive-date=2014-10-30|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{MathWorld |title=Improper Fraction |id=ImproperFraction}}</ref> In general, a common fraction is said to be a '''proper fraction''' if the [[absolute value]] of the fraction is strictly less than one\u2014that is, if the fraction is greater than \u22121 and less than 1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/65128.html|title=Math Forum \u2013 Ask Dr. Math:Can Negative Fractions Also Be Proper or Improper?|author=Laurel|date=31 March 2004|publisher=|accessdate=2014-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109010850/http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/65128.html|archive-date=9 November 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.necompact.org/ea/gle_support/Math/resources_number/prop_fraction.htm|title=New England Compact Math Resources|publisher=|access-date=2011-12-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415053421/http://www.necompact.org/ea/gle_support/Math/resources_number/prop_fraction.htm|archive-date=2012-04-15|url-status=dead}}</ref> It is said to be an '''improper fraction''', or sometimes '''top-heavy fraction''',<ref>{{cite book|last1=Greer|first1=A.|title=New comprehensive mathematics for 'O' level|date=1986|publisher=Thornes|location=Cheltenham|isbn=978-0-85950-159-0|page=5|edition=2nd ed., reprinted.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wX2dxeDahAwC&pg=PA5|accessdate=2014-07-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119204758/https://books.google.com/books?id=wX2dxeDahAwC&pg=PA5|archive-date=2019-01-19|url-status=live}}</ref> if the absolute value of the fraction is greater than or equal to 1. Examples of proper fractions are 2/3, \u20133/4, and 4/9; examples of improper fractions are 9/4, \u20134/3, and 3/3.\n\n===Reciprocals and the \"invisible denominator\"===\nThe '''reciprocal''' of a fraction is another fraction with the numerator and denominator exchanged. The reciprocal of <math>\\tfrac{3}{7}</math>, for instance, is <math>\\tfrac{7}{3}</math>. The product of a fraction and its reciprocal is 1, hence the reciprocal is the [[multiplicative inverse]] of a fraction. The reciprocal of a proper fraction is improper, and the reciprocal of an improper fraction not equal to 1 (that is, numerator and denominator are not equal) is a proper fraction.\n\nWhen the numerator and denominator of a fraction are equal (<math>\\tfrac{7}{7}</math>, for example), its value is 1, and the fraction therefore is improper. Its reciprocal also has the value 1, and is improper, too.\n\nAny integer can be written as a fraction with the number one as denominator. For example, 17 can be written as <math>\\tfrac{17}{1}</math>, where 1 is sometimes referred to as the ''invisible denominator''. Therefore, every fraction or integer, except for zero, has a reciprocal. The reciprocal of 17 is <math>\\tfrac{1}{17}</math>.\n\n===Ratios===\nA [[ratio]] is a relationship between two or more numbers that can be sometimes expressed as a fraction. Typically, a number of items are grouped and compared in a ratio, specifying numerically the relationship between each group. Ratios are expressed as \"group 1 to group 2 ... to group ''n''\". For example, if a car lot had 12 vehicles, of which\n* 2 are white,\n* 6 are red, and\n* 4 are yellow,\n\nthen the ratio of red to white to yellow cars is 6 to 2 to 4. The ratio of yellow cars to white cars is 4 to 2 and may be expressed as 4:2 or 2:1.\n\nA ratio is often converted to a fraction when it is expressed as a ratio to the whole. In the above example, the ratio of yellow cars to all the cars on the lot is 4:12 or 1:3. We can convert these ratios to a fraction and say that 4/12 of the cars or \u2153 of the cars in the lot are yellow. Therefore, if a person randomly chose one car on the lot, then there is a one in three chance or [[probability]] that it would be yellow.\n\n===Decimal fractions and percentages===\nA '''[[decimal fraction]]''' is a fraction whose denominator is not given explicitly, but is understood to be an integer power of ten. Decimal fractions are commonly expressed using decimal notation in which the implied denominator is determined by the number of [[Numerical digit|digits]] to the right of a [[decimal separator]], the appearance of which (e.g., a period, a raised period (\u2022), a comma) depends on the locale (for examples, see [[Decimal separator#Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system|decimal separator]]). Thus for 0.75 the numerator is 75 and the implied denominator is 10 to the second power, ''viz.'' 100, because there are two digits to the right of the decimal separator. In decimal numbers greater than 1 (such as 3.75), the [[fractional part]] of the number is expressed by the digits to the right of the decimal (with a value of 0.75 in this case). 3.75 can be written either as an improper fraction, 375/100, or as a mixed number, <math>3\\tfrac{75}{100}</math>.\n\nDecimal fractions can also be expressed using [[scientific notation]] with negative exponents, such as {{val|6.023|e=-7}}, which represents 0.0000006023. The {{val|e=-7}} represents a denominator of {{val|e=7}}. Dividing by {{val|e=7}} moves the decimal point 7 places to the left.\n\nDecimal fractions with infinitely many digits to the right of the decimal separator represent an [[infinite series]]. For example, {{sfrac|1|3}} = 0.333... represents the infinite series 3/10 + 3/100 + 3/1000 + ... .\n\nAnother kind of fraction is the [[percentage]] (Latin ''per centum'' meaning \"per hundred\", represented by the symbol %), in which the implied denominator is always 100. Thus, 51% means 51/100. Percentages greater than 100 or less than zero are treated in the same way, e.g. 311% equals 311/100, and \u221227% equals \u221227/100.\n\nThe related concept of ''[[permille]]'' or ''parts per thousand'' (ppt) has an implied denominator of 1000, while the more general [[parts-per notation]], as in 75 ''parts per million'' (ppm), means that the proportion is 75/1,000,000.\n\nWhether common fractions or decimal fractions are used is often a matter of taste and context. Common fractions are used most often when the denominator is relatively small. By [[mental calculation]], it is easier to multiply 16 by 3/16 than to do the same calculation using the fraction's decimal equivalent (0.1875). And it is more [[accurate]] to multiply 15 by 1/3, for example, than it is to multiply 15 by any decimal approximation of one third. Monetary values are commonly expressed as decimal fractions with denominator 100, i.e., with two decimals, for example $3.75. However, as noted above, in pre-decimal British currency, shillings and pence were often given the form (but not the meaning) of a fraction, as, for example 3/6 (read \"three and six\") meaning 3 shillings and 6 pence, and having no relationship to the fraction 3/6.\n\n==={{anchor|Mixed numbers}}Mixed numbers===\nA '''mixed numeral''' (also called a ''mixed fraction'' or ''mixed number'') is a traditional denotation of the sum of a non-zero integer and a proper fraction (having the same sign). It is used primarily in measurement: <math>2\\tfrac{3}{16}</math>inches, for example. Scientific measurements almost invariably use decimal notation rather than mixed numbers. The sum is implied without the use of a visible operator such as the appropriate \"+\". For example, in referring to two entire cakes and three quarters of another cake, the numerals denoting the integer part and the fractional part of the cakes are written next to each other as <math>2\\tfrac{3}{4}</math>instead of the unambiguous notation <math>2+\\tfrac{3}{4}.</math> Negative mixed numerals, as in <math>-2\\tfrac{3}{4}</math>, are treated like <math> -(2+\\tfrac{3}{4}).</math> Any such sum of a ''whole'' plus a ''part'' can be converted to an [[improper fraction]] by applying the rules of [[Fraction (mathematics)#Adding unlike quantities|adding unlike quantities]].\n\nThis tradition is, formally, in conflict with the notation in algebra where adjacent factors, without an explicit [[infix operator]], denote a product. When two algebraic expressions are written next to each other, the operation of multiplication is implied by this general rule: <math>2x</math>always means the product of <math>2</math> and <math display=\"inline\">x</math>, even if the value of <math>x</math> is a fraction. The expression <math> 2 \\tfrac{b}{c} </math> for example is not a mixed number; instead, multiplication is expressly required, where <math> 2 \\tfrac{b}{c} = 2 \\cdot \\tfrac{b}{c}.</math>\n\nFor better readability, the multiplication is sometimes made explicit or parentheses are added. So, <math> 2 \\tfrac{b}{c}</math> may be written as\n\n: <math> 2 \\cdot \\tfrac{b}{c},\\quad</math> or <math>\\quad 2 \\times \\tfrac{b}{c},\\quad</math> or <math> \\quad 2 \\left(\\tfrac{b}{c}\\right),\\;\\ldots</math>\n\nAn improper fraction can be converted to a mixed number as follows:\n\n# Using [[Euclidean division]] (division with remainder), divide the numerator by the denominator. In the example, <math>\\tfrac{11}{4}</math>, divide 11 by 4. 11 \u00f7 4 = 2 remainder 3.\n# The [[quotient]] (without the remainder) becomes the whole number part of the mixed number. The remainder becomes the numerator of the fractional part. In the example, 2 is the whole number part and 3 is the numerator of the fractional part.\n# The new denominator is the same as the denominator of the improper fraction. In the example, it is 4. Thus <math>\\tfrac{11}{4} =2\\tfrac{3}{4}</math>.\n\n===Historical notions===\n====Egyptian fraction====\nAn [[Egyptian fraction]] is the sum of distinct positive unit fractions, for example <math>\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{1}{3}</math>. This definition derives from the fact that the [[ancient Egypt]]ians expressed all fractions except <math>\\tfrac{1}{2}</math>, <math>\\tfrac{2}{3}</math> and <math>\\tfrac{3}{4}</math> in this manner. Every positive rational number can be expanded as an Egyptian fraction. For example, <math>\\tfrac{5}{7}</math> can be written as <math>\\tfrac{1}{2} + \\tfrac{1}{6} + \\tfrac{1}{21}.</math> Any positive rational number can be written as a sum of unit fractions in infinitely many ways. Two ways to write <math>\\tfrac{13}{17}</math> are <math>\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{1}{4}+\\tfrac{1}{68}</math> and <math>\\tfrac{1}{3}+\\tfrac{1}{4}+\\tfrac{1}{6}+\\tfrac{1}{68}</math>.\n\n===='Complex' and 'Compound' fractions====\nThe notions \u2018complex fraction\u2019 and \u2018compound fraction\u2019 are both outdated<ref>https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/complex-fraction {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201182513/https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/complex-fraction |date=2017-12-01 }} et al.</ref> and nowadays used in no well-defined manner, partly even taken synonymously for each other<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/complex-fraction |title=Complex fraction definition and meaning |publisher=Collins English Dictionary |date=2018-03-09 |accessdate=2018-03-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201182513/https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/complex-fraction |archive-date=2017-12-01 |url-status=live }}</ref> or for mixed numerals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sosmath.com/algebra/fraction/frac5/frac5.html |title=Compound Fractions |publisher=Sosmath.com |date=1996-02-05 |accessdate=2018-03-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314105714/http://www.sosmath.com/algebra/fraction/frac5/frac5.html |archive-date=2018-03-14 |url-status=live }}</ref> They lost their meaning as technical terms and the attributes \"complex\" and \"compound\" tend to be used in their every day meaning of \"consisting of parts\".\n* Complex fractions\n::''Not to be confused with [[Division of complex numbers|fractions involving complex numbers]]\nIn a '''complex fraction''', either the numerator, or the denominator, or both, is a fraction or a mixed number,<ref name=\"Trotter\">{{cite book|last=Trotter|first=James|title=A complete system of arithmetic|page=65|year=1853|url=https://books.google.com/?id=a0sDAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA65&dq=%2B%22complex+fraction%22+%2B%22compound+fraction%22#v=onepage&q=%22complex%20fraction%22&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\"Barlow\">{{cite book|last=Barlow|first=Peter|title=A new mathematical and philosophical dictionary|year=1814|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BBowAAAAYAAJ&pg=PT329&dq=%2B%22complex+fraction%22+%2B%22compound+fraction%22#v=onepage&q=%2B%22complex%20fraction%22%20%2B%22compound%20fraction%22&f=false}}</ref> corresponding to division of fractions. For example, <math>\\frac{\\tfrac{1}{2}}{\\tfrac{1}{3}}</math> and <math>\\frac{12\\tfrac{3}{4}}{26}</math> are complex fractions. To reduce a complex fraction to a simple fraction, treat the longest fraction line as representing division. For example:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\tfrac{1}{2}}{\\tfrac{1}{3}}=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\times\\tfrac{3}{1}=\\tfrac{3}{2}</math>\n\n:<math>\\frac{12\\tfrac{3}{4}}{26} = 12\\tfrac{3}{4} \\cdot \\tfrac{1}{26} = \\tfrac{12 \\cdot 4 + 3}{4} \\cdot \\tfrac{1}{26} = \\tfrac{51}{4} \\cdot \\tfrac{1}{26} = \\tfrac{51}{104}</math>\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\tfrac{3}{2}}5=\\tfrac{3}{2}\\times\\tfrac{1}{5}=\\tfrac{3}{10}</math>\n\n:<math>\\frac{8}{\\tfrac{1}{3}}=8\\times\\tfrac{3}{1}=24.</math>\n\nIf, in a complex fraction, there is no unique way to tell which fraction lines takes precedence, then this expression is improperly formed, because of ambiguity. So 5/10/20/40 is not a valid mathematical expression, because of multiple possible interpretations, e.g. as\n:<math>5/(10/(20/40)) = \\frac{5}{10/\\tfrac{20}{40}} = \\frac{1}{4}\\quad</math> or as <math>\\quad (5/10)/(20/40) = \\frac{\\tfrac{5}{10}}{\\tfrac{20}{40}} = 1</math>\n* Compound fractions\nA '''compound fraction''' is a fraction of a fraction, or any number of fractions connected with the word ''of'',<ref name=\"Trotter\" /><ref name=\"Barlow\" /> corresponding to multiplication of fractions. To reduce a compound fraction to a simple fraction, just carry out the multiplication (see the section on [[#Multiplication|multiplication]]). For example, <math>\\tfrac{3}{4}</math> of <math>\\tfrac{5}{7}</math> is a compound fraction, corresponding to <math>\\tfrac{3}{4} \\times \\tfrac{5}{7} = \\tfrac{15}{28}</math>. The terms compound fraction and complex fraction are closely related and sometimes one is used as a synonym for the other. (For example, the compound fraction <math>\\tfrac{3}{4} \\times \\tfrac{5}{7}</math> is equivalent to the complex fraction <math>\\tfrac{3/4}{7/5}</math>.)\n\n==Arithmetic with fractions==\nLike whole numbers, fractions obey the [[commutative]], [[associative]], and [[distributive property|distributive]] laws, and the rule against [[division by zero]].\n\n===Equivalent fractions===\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same (non-zero) number results in a fraction that is equivalent to the original fraction. This is true because for any non-zero number <math>n</math>, the fraction <math>\\tfrac{n}{n} = 1</math>. Therefore, multiplying by <math>\\tfrac{n}{n}</math>is equivalent to multiplying by one, and any number multiplied by one has the same value as the original number. By way of an example, start with the fraction <math>\\tfrac{1}{2}</math>. When the numerator and denominator are both multiplied by 2, the result is <math>\\tfrac{2}{4}</math>, which has the same value (0.5) as <math>\\tfrac{1}{2}</math>. To picture this visually, imagine cutting a cake into four pieces; two of the pieces together (<math>\\tfrac{2}{4}</math>) make up half the cake (<math>\\tfrac{1}{2}</math>).\n\n====Simplifying (Reducing) fractions====\n\nDividing the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same non-zero number will also yield an equivalent fraction. If the numerator and the denominator of a fraction are both divisible by a number (called a factor) greater than 1, then the fraction can be reduced to an equal fraction with a smaller numerator and a smaller denominator. To do this, the [[greatest common factor]] is identified, and both the numerator and the denominator are divided by this factor. For example, if both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction <math>\\tfrac{a}{b}</math>are divisible by <math>c,</math> then they can be written as <math>a=cd</math> and <math>b=ce,</math> so the fraction becomes <math>\\tfrac{cd}{ce}</math>, which can be reduced by dividing both the numerator and denominator by <math>c</math> to give the reduced fraction <math>\\tfrac{d}{e}.</math>\n\nIf the numerator and the denominator do not share any factor greater than 1, then the fraction is said to be irreducible, in lowest terms, or in simplest terms. For example, <math>\\tfrac{3}{9}</math>is not in lowest terms because both 3 and 9 can be exactly divided by 3. In contrast, <math>\\tfrac{3}{8}</math> ''is'' in lowest terms\u2014the only positive integer that goes into both 3 and 8 evenly is 1.\n\nUsing these rules, we can show that <math>\\tfrac{5}{10}</math>= <math>\\tfrac{1}{2}</math>= <math>\\tfrac{10}{20}</math>= <math>\\tfrac{50}{100}</math>.\n\nAs another example, since the greatest common divisor of 63 and 462 is 21, the fraction <math>\\tfrac{63}{462}</math>can be reduced to lowest terms by dividing the numerator and denominator by 21:\n:<math>\\tfrac{63}{462} = \\tfrac{63 \\div 21}{462 \\div 21}= \\tfrac{3}{22}</math>\n\nThe [[Euclidean algorithm]] gives a method for finding the greatest common divisor of any two positive integers.\n\n===Comparing fractions===\nComparing fractions with the same positive denominator yields the same result as comparing the numerators:\n\n:<math>\\tfrac{3}{4}>\\tfrac{2}{4}</math> because {{nowrap|3 &gt; 2}}, and the equal denominators <math>4</math> are positive.\n\nIf the equal denominators are negative, then the opposite result of comparing the numerators holds for the fractions:\n\n:<math>\\tfrac{3}{-4}<\\tfrac{2}{-4}</math> because <math>\\tfrac{a}{-b}= \\tfrac{-a}{b}</math> and <math>-3 < -2</math>.\n\nIf two positive fractions have the same numerator, then the fraction with the smaller denominator is the larger number. When a whole is divided into equal pieces, if fewer equal pieces are needed to make up the whole, then each piece must be larger. When two positive fractions have the same numerator, they represent the same number of parts, but in the fraction with the smaller denominator, the parts are larger.\n\nOne way to compare fractions with different numerators and denominators is to find a common denominator. To compare <math>\\tfrac{a}{b}</math> and <math>\\tfrac{c}{d}</math>, these are converted to <math>\\tfrac{a\\cdot d}{b\\cdot d}</math> and <math>\\tfrac{b\\cdot c}{b\\cdot d}</math> (where the dot signifies multiplication and is an alternative symbol to \u00d7). Then ''bd'' is a common denominator and the numerators ''ad'' and ''bc'' can be compared. It is not necessary to determine the value of the common denominator to compare fractions \u2013 one can just compare ''ad'' and ''bc'', without evaluating ''bd'', e.g., comparing <math>\\tfrac{2}{3}</math> ? <math>\\tfrac{1}{2}</math> gives <math>\\tfrac{4}{6}>\\tfrac{3}{6}</math>.\n\nFor the more laborious question <math>\\tfrac{5}{18}</math> ? <math>\\tfrac{4}{17},</math> multiply top and bottom of each fraction by the denominator of the other fraction, to get a common denominator, yielding <math>\\tfrac{5 \\times 17}{18 \\times 17}</math> ? <math>\\tfrac{18 \\times 4}{18 \\times 17}</math>. It is not necessary to calculate <math>18 \\times 17</math> \u2013 only the numerators need to be compared. Since 5\u00d717 (=&nbsp;85) is greater than 4\u00d718 (=&nbsp;72), the result of comparing is <math>\\tfrac{5}{18}>\\tfrac{4}{17}</math>.\n\nBecause every negative number, including negative fractions, is less than zero, and every positive number, including positive fractions, is greater than zero, it follows that any negative fraction is less than any positive fraction. This allows, together with the above rules, to compare all possible fractions.\n\n===Addition===\nThe first rule of addition is that only like quantities can be added; for example, various quantities of quarters. Unlike quantities, such as adding thirds to quarters, must first be converted to like quantities as described below: Imagine a pocket containing two quarters, and another pocket containing three quarters; in total, there are five quarters. Since four quarters is equivalent to one (dollar), this can be represented as follows:\n:<math>\\tfrac24+\\tfrac34=\\tfrac54=1\\tfrac14</math>.\n\n[[File:Cake fractions.svg|thumb|right|270px|If <math>\\tfrac12</math> of a cake is to be added to <math>\\tfrac14</math> of a cake, the pieces need to be converted into comparable quantities, such as cake-eighths or cake-quarters.]]\n\n====Adding unlike quantities====\nTo add fractions containing unlike quantities (e.g. quarters and thirds), it is necessary to convert all amounts to like quantities. It is easy to work out the chosen type of fraction to convert to; simply multiply together the two denominators (bottom number) of each fraction. In case of an integer number apply the [[Fraction (mathematics)#Reciprocals and the \"invisible denominator\"|invisible denominator]] <math>1.</math>\n\nFor adding quarters to thirds, both types of fraction are converted to twelfths, thus:\n\n: <math>\\frac14\\ + \\frac13=\\frac{1\\times3}{4\\times3}\\ + \\frac{1\\times4}{3\\times4}=\\frac3{12}\\ + \\frac4{12}=\\frac7{12}.</math>\n\nConsider adding the following two quantities:\n:<math>\\frac35+\\frac23</math>\nFirst, convert <math>\\tfrac35</math> into fifteenths by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by three: <math>\\tfrac35\\times\\tfrac33=\\tfrac9{15}</math>. Since <math>\\tfrac33</math> equals 1, multiplication by <math>\\tfrac33</math> does not change the value of the fraction.\n\nSecond, convert <math>\\tfrac23</math> into fifteenths by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by five: <math>\\tfrac23\\times\\tfrac55=\\tfrac{10}{15}</math>.\n\nNow it can be seen that:\n\n:<math>\\frac35+\\frac23</math>\n\nis equivalent to:\n\n:<math>\\frac9{15}+\\frac{10}{15}=\\frac{19}{15}=1\\frac4{15}</math>\n\nThis method can be expressed algebraically:\n:<math>\\frac{a}{b} + \\frac {c}{d} = \\frac{ad+cb}{bd}</math>\n\nThis algebraic method always works, thereby guaranteeing that the sum of simple fractions is always again a simple fraction. However, if the single denominators contain a common factor, a smaller denominator than the product of these can be used. For example, when adding <math>\\tfrac{3}{4}</math> and <math>\\tfrac{5}{6}</math> the single denominators have a common factor <math>2,</math> and therefore, instead of the denominator 24 (4&thinsp;\u00d7&thinsp;6), the halved denominator 12 may be used, not only reducing the denominator in the result, but also the factors in the numerator.\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\frac34+\\frac56 &= \\frac{3\\cdot 6}{4\\cdot 6}+\\frac{4 \\cdot 5}{4\\cdot 6}=\\frac{18}{24} + \\frac{20}{24}&=\\frac{19}{12}\\\\\n&=\\frac{3\\cdot 3}{4\\cdot 3}+\\frac{2\\cdot 5}{2\\cdot 6} =\\frac{9}{12} + \\frac{10}{12}&=\\frac{19}{12}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe smallest possible denominator is given by the [[least common multiple]] of the single denominators, which results from dividing the rote multiple by all common factors of the single denominators. This is called the least common denominator.\n\n===Subtraction===\nThe process for subtracting fractions is, in essence, the same as that of adding them: find a common denominator, and change each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the chosen common denominator. The resulting fraction will have that denominator, and its numerator will be the result of subtracting the numerators of the original fractions. For instance,\n\n:<math>\\tfrac23-\\tfrac12=\\tfrac46-\\tfrac36=\\tfrac16</math>\n\n===Multiplication===\n====Multiplying a fraction by another fraction====\nTo multiply fractions, multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators. Thus:\n\n:<math>\\tfrac{2}{3} \\times \\tfrac{3}{4} = \\tfrac{6}{12}</math>\n\nTo explain the process, consider one third of one quarter. Using the example of a cake, if three small slices of equal size make up a quarter, and four quarters make up a whole, twelve of these small, equal slices make up a whole. Therefore, a third of a quarter is a twelfth. Now consider the numerators. The first fraction, two thirds, is twice as large as one third. Since one third of a quarter is one twelfth, two thirds of a quarter is two twelfth. The second fraction, three quarters, is three times as large as one quarter, so two thirds of three quarters is three times as large as two thirds of one quarter. Thus two thirds times three quarters is six twelfths.\n\nA short cut for multiplying fractions is called \"cancellation\". Effectively the answer is reduced to lowest terms during multiplication. For example:\n\n:<math>\\tfrac{2}{3} \\times \\tfrac{3}{4} = \\tfrac{\\cancel{2} ^{~1}}{\\cancel{3} ^{~1}} \\times \\tfrac{\\cancel{3} ^{~1}}{\\cancel{4} ^{~2}} = \\tfrac{1}{1} \\times \\tfrac{1}{2} = \\tfrac{1}{2}</math>\n\nA two is a common [[Divisor|factor]] in both the numerator of the left fraction and the denominator of the right and is divided out of both. Three is a common factor of the left denominator and right numerator and is divided out of both.\n\n====Multiplying a fraction by a whole number====\nSince a whole number can be rewritten as itself divided by 1, normal fraction multiplication rules can still apply.\n\n:<math>6 \\times \\tfrac{3}{4} = \\tfrac{6}{1} \\times \\tfrac{3}{4} = \\tfrac{18}{4}</math> This method works because the fraction 6/1 means six equal parts, each one of which is a whole.\n\n====Multiplying mixed numbers====\nWhen multiplying mixed numbers, it is considered preferable {{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} to convert the mixed number into an improper fraction. For example:\n\n:<math>3 \\times 2\\tfrac{3}{4} = 3 \\times \\left (\\tfrac{8}{4} + \\tfrac{3}{4} \\right ) = 3 \\times \\tfrac{11}{4} = \\tfrac{33}{4} = 8\\tfrac{1}{4}</math>\n\nIn other words, <math>2\\tfrac{3}{4}</math> is the same as <math>\\tfrac{8}{4} + \\tfrac{3}{4}</math>, making 11 quarters in total (because 2 cakes, each split into quarters makes 8 quarters total) and 33 quarters is <math>8\\tfrac{1}{4}</math>, since 8 cakes, each made of quarters, is 32 quarters in total.\n\n===Division===\nTo divide a fraction by a whole number, you may either divide the numerator by the number, if it goes evenly into the numerator, or multiply the denominator by the number. For example, <math>\\tfrac{10}{3} \\div 5</math> equals <math>\\tfrac{2}{3}</math> and also equals <math>\\tfrac{10}{3 \\cdot 5} = \\tfrac{10}{15}</math>, which reduces to <math>\\tfrac{2}{3}</math>. To divide a number by a fraction, multiply that number by the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of that fraction. Thus, <math>\\tfrac{1}{2} \\div \\tfrac{3}{4} = \\tfrac{1}{2} \\times \\tfrac{4}{3} = \\tfrac{1 \\cdot 4}{2 \\cdot 3} = \\tfrac{2}{3}</math>.\n\n===Converting between decimals and fractions===\nTo change a common fraction to a decimal, do a long division of the decimal representations of the numerator by the denominator (this is idiomatically also phrased as \"divide the denominator into the numerator\"), and round the answer to the desired accuracy. For example, to change \u00bc to a decimal, divide <math>1.00</math> by <math>4</math> (\"<math>4</math> into <math>1.00</math>\"), to obtain <math>0.25</math>. To change \u2153 to a decimal, divide <math>1.000...</math> by <math>3</math> (\"<math>3</math> into <math>1.0000...</math>\"), and stop when the desired accuracy is obtained, e.g., at <math>4</math> decimals with <math>0.3333</math>. The fraction \u00bc can be written exactly with two decimal digits, while the fraction \u2153 cannot be written exactly as a decimal with a finite number of digits. To change a decimal to a fraction, write in the denominator a <math>1</math> followed by as many zeroes as there are digits to the right of the decimal point, and write in the numerator all the digits of the original decimal, just omitting the decimal point. Thus <math>12.3456 = \\tfrac{123456}{10000}.</math>\n\n====Converting repeating decimals to fractions====\n{{See also| Repeating decimal }}\nDecimal numbers, while arguably more useful to work with when performing calculations, sometimes lack the precision that common fractions have. Sometimes an infinite [[repeating decimal]] is required to reach the same precision. Thus, it is often useful to convert repeating decimals into fractions.\n\nThe preferred{{By whom|date=January 2020}} way to indicate a repeating decimal is to place a bar (known as a [[Vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]]) over the digits that repeat, for example 0.{{overline|789}} = 0.789789789... For repeating patterns where the repeating pattern begins immediately after the decimal point, a simple division of the pattern by the same number of nines as numbers it has will suffice. For example:\n:0.{{overline|5}} = 5/9\n:0.{{overline|62}} = 62/99\n:0.{{overline|264}} = 264/999\n:0.{{overline|6291}} = 6291/9999\nIn case [[leading zero]]s precede the pattern, the nines are suffixed by the same number of [[trailing zero]]s:\n:0.0{{overline|5}} = 5/90\n:0.000{{overline|392}} = 392/999000\n:0.00{{overline|12}} = 12/9900\nIn case a non-repeating set of decimals precede the pattern (such as 0.1523{{overline|987}}), we can write it as the sum of the non-repeating and repeating parts, respectively:\n:0.1523 + 0.0000{{overline|987}}\nThen, convert both parts to fractions, and add them using the methods described above:\n:1523&thinsp;/&thinsp;10000 + 987&thinsp;/&thinsp;9990000 = 1522464&thinsp;/&thinsp;9990000\n\nAlternatively, algebra can be used, such as below:\n\n# Let ''x'' = the repeating decimal:\n#: ''x'' = 0.1523{{overline|987}}\n# Multiply both sides by the power of 10 just great enough (in this case 10<sup>4</sup>) to move the decimal point just before the repeating part of the decimal number:\n#: 10,000''x'' = 1,523.{{overline|987}}\n# Multiply both sides by the power of 10 (in this case 10<sup>3</sup>) that is the same as the number of places that repeat:\n#: 10,000,000''x'' = 1,523,987.{{overline|987}}\n# Subtract the two equations from each other (if ''a'' = ''b'' and ''c'' = ''d'', then ''a'' \u2212 ''c'' = ''b'' \u2212 ''d''):\n#: 10,000,000''x'' \u2212 10,000''x'' = 1,523,987.{{overline|987}} \u2212 1,523.{{overline|987}}\n# Continue the subtraction operation to clear the repeating decimal:\n#: 9,990,000''x'' = 1,523,987 \u2212 1,523\n#: <span style=\"visibility:hidden\">9,990,000''x''</span> = 1,522,464\n# Divide both sides by 9,990,000 to represent ''x'' as a fraction\n#: ''x'' = 1522464&thinsp;/&thinsp;9990000\n\n==Fractions in abstract mathematics==\nIn addition to being of great practical importance, fractions are also studied by mathematicians, who check that the rules for fractions given above are [[well defined|consistent and reliable]].

Alternatively, instead of defining subtraction and division as operations, the \"inverse\" fractions with respect to addition and multiplication might be defined as:\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{llrrl}\n     &-(a,b) &= &(-a, b) &\\quad \\text{additive inverse fractions,} \\\\\n      &&&&\\quad\\text{with } (0,b) \\text{ as additive unities, and}\\\\\n     &\\;\\;\\ (a,b)^{-1} &= &(b,a) &\\quad \\text{multiplicative inverse fractions, for } a \\ne 0, \\\\\n      &&&&\\quad\\text{with } (b,b) \\text{ as multiplicative unities}.\n   \\end{array}</math>\n\nFurthermore, the [[Relation (mathematics)|relation]], specified as\n:<math>(a, b) \\sim (c, d)\\quad \\iff \\quad ad=bc,</math>\n\nis an [[equivalence relation]] of fractions. Each fraction from one equivalence class may be considered as a representative for the whole class, and each whole class may be considered as one abstract fraction. This equivalence is preserved by the above defined operations, i.e., the results of operating on fractions are independent of the selection of representatives from their equivalence class. Formally, for addition of fractions\n:<math>(a,b) \\sim (a',b')\\quad</math> and <math>\\quad (c,d) \\sim (c',d') \\quad</math> imply\n::<math>((a,b) + (c,d)) \\sim ((a',b') + (c',d'))</math>\n\nand similarly for the other operations.\n\nIn case of fractions of integers the fractions with <math>(a,b)</math>coprime are often taken as uniquely determined representatives for their ''equivalent'' fractions, which are considered to be the ''same'' rational number. This way the fractions of integers make up the field of the rational numbers.\n\nMore generally, ''a'' and ''b'' may be elements of any [[integral domain]] ''R'', in which case a fraction is an element of the [[field of fractions]] of ''R''. For example, [[polynomial]]s in one indeterminate, with coefficients from some integral domain ''D'', are themselves an integral domain, call it ''P''. So for ''a'' and ''b'' elements of ''P'', the generated ''field of fractions'' is the field of [[rational fraction]]s (also known as the field of [[rational function]]s).\n\n==Algebraic fractions==\n{{Main|Algebraic fraction}}\nAn algebraic fraction is the indicated [[quotient]] of two [[algebraic expression]]s. As with fractions of integers, the denominator of an algebraic fraction cannot be zero. Two examples of algebraic fractions are <math>\\frac{3x}{x^2+2x-3}</math> and <math>\\frac{\\sqrt{x+2}}{x^2-3}</math>. Algebraic fractions are subject to the same [[field (mathematics)|field properties]] as arithmetic fractions.\n\nIf the numerator and the denominator are [[polynomial]]s, as in <math>\\frac{3x}{x^2+2x-3}</math>, the algebraic fraction is called a '''rational fraction''' (or '''rational expression'''). An '''irrational fraction''' is one that is not rational, as, for example, one that contains the variable under a fractional exponent or root, as in <math>\\frac{\\sqrt{x+2}}{x^2-3}</math>.\n\nThe terminology used to describe algebraic fractions is similar to that used for ordinary fractions. For example, an algebraic fraction is in lowest terms if the only factors common to the numerator and the denominator are 1 and \u22121. An algebraic fraction whose numerator or denominator, or both, contain a fraction, such as <math>\\frac{1 + \\tfrac{1}{x}}{1 - \\tfrac{1}{x}}</math>, is called a '''complex fraction'''.\n\nThe field of rational numbers is the [[field of fractions]] of the integers, while the integers themselves are not a field but rather an [[integral domain]]. Similarly, the [[Rational fraction|rational expressions]] are the field of fractions of [[polynomial]]s. There are different integral domains of polynomials, depending on the integral domain the [[coefficient]]s of the polynomials are from (e.g. from integers, [[real numbers]], [[complex numbers]], ...). Considering the field of fractions generated by polynomials with real coefficients, [[radical expression]]s such as <math>\\textstyle \\sqrt{2}/2</math>are also rational fractions, as is the transcendental expression <math display=\"inline\">\\pi/2</math>, since all of <math>\\sqrt{2},\\pi,</math>and <math>2</math>are (constant) polynomials over the ''reals''. These same expressions, however, would not be considered elements of the field of fractions generated by polynomials with ''integer'' coefficients. This specific field would contain just the <math>2</math>of the three polynomials above, or <math>1/2</math>as fraction, but no radical or transcendental expressions.\n\nThe term [[partial fraction]] is used when decomposing rational expressions into sums. The goal is to write the rational expression as the sum of other rational expressions with denominators of lesser degree. For example, the rational expression <math>\\frac{2x}{x^2-1}</math> can be rewritten as the sum of two fractions: <math>\\frac{1}{x+1} + \\frac{1}{x-1}</math>. This is useful in many areas such as integral calculus and differential equations.\n\n==Radical expressions==\n{{Main|Nth root|Rationalization (mathematics)}}\nA fraction may also contain [[Nth root|radicals]] in the numerator and/or the denominator. If the denominator contains radicals, it can be helpful to [[Rationalisation (mathematics)|rationalize]] it (compare [[Nth root#Simplified form of a radical expression|Simplified form of a radical expression]]), especially if further operations, such as adding or comparing that fraction to another, are to be carried out. It is also more convenient if division is to be done manually. When the denominator is a [[monomial]] square root, it can be rationalized by multiplying both the top and the bottom of the fraction by the denominator:\n\n: <math>\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{7}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{7}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{\\sqrt{7}} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{7}}{7}</math>\n\nThe process of rationalization of [[binomial (polynomial)|binomial]] denominators involves multiplying the top and the bottom of a fraction by the [[Conjugate (algebra)|conjugate]] of the denominator so that the denominator becomes a rational number. For example:\n\n:<math>\\frac{3}{3-2\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{3}{3-2\\sqrt{5}} \\cdot \\frac{3+2\\sqrt{5}}{3+2\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{3(3+2\\sqrt{5})}{{3}^2 - (2\\sqrt{5})^2} = \\frac{ 3 (3 + 2\\sqrt{5} ) }{ 9 - 20 } = - \\frac{ 9+6 \\sqrt{5} }{11}</math>\n:<math>\\frac{3}{3+2\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{3}{3+2\\sqrt{5}} \\cdot \\frac{3-2\\sqrt{5}}{3-2\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{3(3-2\\sqrt{5})}{{3}^2 - (2\\sqrt{5})^2} = \\frac{ 3 (3 - 2\\sqrt{5} ) }{ 9 - 20 } = - \\frac{ 9-6 \\sqrt{5} }{11}</math>\n\nEven if this process results in the numerator being irrational, like in the examples above, the process may still facilitate subsequent manipulations by reducing the number of irrationals one has to work with in the denominator.\n\n==Typographical variations==\nIn computer displays and [[typography]], simple fractions are sometimes printed as a single character, e.g. \u00bd ([[one half]]). See the article on [[Number Forms]] for information on doing this in [[Unicode]].\n\nScientific publishing distinguishes four ways to set fractions, together with guidelines on use:<ref name=\"galen\">{{Cite journal | title = Putting Fractions in Their Place | first = Leslie Blackwell | last = Galen | journal = [[American Mathematical Monthly]] | date = March 2004 | volume = 111 | pages = 238\u2013242 | number = 3 | doi = 10.2307/4145131 | url = http://www.integretechpub.com/research/papers/monthly238-242.pdf | jstor = 4145131 | access-date = 2010-01-27 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110713044149/http://www.integretechpub.com/research/papers/monthly238-242.pdf | archive-date = 2011-07-13 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n* '''special fractions:''' fractions that are presented as a single character with a slanted bar, with roughly the same height and width as other characters in the text. Generally used for simple fractions, such as: \u00bd, \u2153, \u2154, \u00bc, and \u00be. Since the numerals are smaller, legibility can be an issue, especially for small-sized fonts. These are not used in modern mathematical notation, but in other contexts.\n* '''case fractions:''' similar to special fractions, these are rendered as a single typographical character, but with a horizontal bar, thus making them ''upright''.

While the notation \"two shillings and six pence\" did not represent a fraction, the forward slash is now used in fractions, especially for fractions inline with prose (rather than displayed), to avoid uneven lines.
