During movement, an individual cilium deforms using a high-friction power stroke followed by a low-friction recovery stroke. Since there are multiple cilia packed together on an individual organism, they display collective behavior in a [[metachronal rhythm]]. This means the deformation of one cilium is in phase with the deformation of its neighbor, causing deformation waves that propagate along the surface of the organism. These propagating waves of cilia are what allow the organism to use the cilia in a coordinated manner to move. A typical example of a ciliated microorganism is the ''[[Paramecium]]'', a one-celled, ciliated protozoan covered by thousands of cilia. The cilia beating together allow the ''Paramecium'' to propel through the water at speeds of 500 micrometers per second.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lauga|first=Eric|author2=Thomas R Powers|title=The hydrodynamics of swimming microorganisms|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|date=25 August 2009|volume=72|issue=9|pages=096601|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/72/9/096601|bibcode=2009RPPh...72i6601L|arxiv=0812.2887}}</ref>\n\n<gallery caption=\"Flagellate, ciliates and amoeba\" mode=packed heights=140px style=float:left;>\nFile:Flagellum base diagram-en.svg|Bacterial flagellum rotated by a [[molecular motor]] at its base\nFile:PSM V61 D203 Salmon spermatozoa for artificial propagation.png|Salmon [[spermatozoa]]\nFile:\u0418\u043d\u0444\u0443\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0442\u0443\u0444\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438!.gif|[[Paramecium]] feeding on bacteria\nFile:Oxytricha trifallax.jpg|The ciliate ''[[Oxytricha trifallax]]'' with cilia clearly visible\nFile:Collection Penard MHNG Specimen 05bis-1-1 Amoeba proteus.tif|Amoeba with ingested diatoms\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Marine fungi===\n[[File:Lichen rock.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Lichen]] on a rock in a marine [[splash zone]].

They \"breathe\" [[electron donor]]s such as nitrates and nitrites, manganese and iron oxides, oxidized sulfur compounds and carbon dioxide.\n\nThere is very little energy at greater depths, and metabolism can be up to a million times slower than at the surface. Cells may live for thousands of years before dividing and there is no known limit to their age. The subsurface accounts for about 90% of the [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] in bacteria and archaea, and 15% of the total biomass for the biosphere. Eukaryotes are also found, mostly microscopic, but including some multicellular life.

During movement, an individual cilium deforms using a high-friction power stroke followed by a low-friction recovery stroke. Since there are multiple cilia packed together on an individual organism, they display collective behavior in a [[metachronal rhythm]]. This means the deformation of one cilium is in phase with the deformation of its neighbor, causing deformation waves that propagate along the surface of the organism. These propagating waves of cilia are what allow the organism to use the cilia in a coordinated manner to move. A typical example of a ciliated microorganism is the ''[[Paramecium]]'', a one-celled, ciliated protozoan covered by thousands of cilia. The cilia beating together allow the ''Paramecium'' to propel through the water at speeds of 500 micrometers per second.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lauga|first=Eric|author2=Thomas R Powers|title=The hydrodynamics of swimming microorganisms|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|date=25 August 2009|volume=72|issue=9|pages=096601|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/72/9/096601|bibcode=2009RPPh...72i6601L|arxiv=0812.2887}}</ref>\n\n<gallery caption=\"Flagellate, ciliates and amoeba\" mode=packed heights=140px style=float:left;>\nFile:Flagellum base diagram-en.svg|Bacterial flagellum rotated by a [[molecular motor]] at its base\nFile:PSM V61 D203 Salmon spermatozoa for artificial propagation.png|Salmon [[spermatozoa]]\nFile:\u0418\u043d\u0444\u0443\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0442\u0443\u0444\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0431\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438!.gif|[[Paramecium]] feeding on bacteria\nFile:Oxytricha trifallax.jpg|The ciliate ''[[Oxytricha trifallax]]'' with cilia clearly visible\nFile:Collection Penard MHNG Specimen 05bis-1-1 Amoeba proteus.tif|Amoeba with ingested diatoms\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Marine fungi===\n[[File:Lichen rock.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Lichen]] on a rock in a marine [[splash zone]].

They \"breathe\" [[electron donor]]s such as nitrates and nitrites, manganese and iron oxides, oxidized sulfur compounds and carbon dioxide.\n\nThere is very little energy at greater depths, and metabolism can be up to a million times slower than at the surface. Cells may live for thousands of years before dividing and there is no known limit to their age. The subsurface accounts for about 90% of the [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] in bacteria and archaea, and 15% of the total biomass for the biosphere. Eukaryotes are also found, mostly microscopic, but including some multicellular life. Viruses are also present and infect the microbes.\n\n[[File:Unidentified spherical algal microorganism.jpg|thumb|left| Unidentified spherical algal microorganism, part of the [[microbial dark matter]]]]\n[[File:Subsurface life environments.jpg|thumb|320px| {{center|Subsurface life environments}}]]\n\nIn 2018, researchers from the [[Deep Carbon Observatory]] announced that [[life form]]s, including 70% of the bacteria and archaea on Earth, totaling a biomass of 23&nbsp;billion tonnes [[carbon]], live up to {{nowrap|{{convert|4.8|km|mi|abbr=on}}}} deep underground, including {{nowrap|{{convert|2.5|km|mi|abbr=on}}}} below the seabed.<ref name=\"EA-20181211\">{{cite news |author=Deep Carbon Observatory |title=Life in deep Earth totals 15 to 23&nbsp;billion tons of carbon \u2013 hundreds of times more than humans |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-12/tca-lid120318.php |date=10 December 2018 |work=[[EurekAlert!]] |accessdate=11 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"SA-20181211\">{{cite news |last=Dockrill |first=Peter |title=Scientists Reveal a Massive Biosphere of Life Hidden Under Earth's Surface |url=https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-lift-lid-on-massive-biosphere-of-life-hidden-under-earth-s-surface |date=11 December 2018 |work=Science Alert |accessdate=11 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"TI-20181211\">{{cite news |last=Gabbatiss |first=Josh |title=Massive 'deep life' study reveals billions of tonnes of microbes living far beneath Earth's surface |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/deep-life-microbes-underground-bacteria-earth-surface-carbon-observatory-science-study-a8677521.html |date=11 December 2018 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=11 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 2019 microbial organisms were discovered living {{Convert|7900|ft}} below the surface, [[Sulfate-reducing microorganisms|breathing sulfur]] and eating rocks such as [[pyrite]] as their regular food source.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/01490451.2019.1641770 | volume=36 | title='Follow the Water': Hydrogeochemical Constraints on Microbial Investigations 2.4 km Below Surface at the Kidd Creek Deep Fluid and Deep Life Observatory | year=2019 | journal=Geomicrobiology Journal | pages=859\u2013872 | last1 = Lollar | first1 = Garnet S. | last2 = Warr | first2 = Oliver | last3 = Telling | first3 = Jon | last4 = Osburn | first4 = Magdalena R. | last5 = Sherwood Lollar | first5 = Barbara}}</ref><ref>[https://deepcarbon.net/worlds-oldest-groundwater-supports-life-through-water-rock-chemistry World\u2019s Oldest Groundwater Supports Life Through Water-Rock Chemistry], July 29, 2019, deepcarbon.net.</ref><ref>[https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/strange-life-forms-found-deep-mine-point-vast-underground-galapagos-ncna1050906 Strange life-forms found deep in a mine point to vast 'underground Galapagos'], By Corey S.

{"title_page": "Hoover free flights promotion", "text_new": "{{short description|Marketing promotion by Hoover Company}}\n{{Copy edit|date=April 2020}}\nThe '''Hoover free flights promotion''' was a [[marketing]] [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]] run by the British division of the [[The Hoover Company|Hoover Company]]. Beginning in 1992, Hoover offered free airline tickets that it could not afford, resulting in protest and legal action by customers who claimed not to have received tickets. The campaign was a financial setback for the company and led to the loss of Hoover's [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal Warrant]] after a 2004 BBC Documentary.\n\n==The promotion==\nThe promotion was created to sell surplus washing machines and vacuum cleaners. Hoover promised free airline tickets to customers who purchased a Hoover product worth at least [[British pound|\u00a3]]100. However, Hoover made the process of obtaining these flights annoyingly time-consuming:\n\n* A customer who bought a Hoover product for at least \u00a3100 had to mail in their receipt and an application within fourteen days of purchase\n* Hoover sent a registration form; the customer had fourteen days to send it back\n* Hoover sent a travel voucher; the customer had thirty days to select three combinations of departure airport, date, and destination\n* Hoover had the right to reject the customer\u2019s choices; the customer could then select three alternatives\n* Hoover also had the right to reject these alternatives and select three combinations of its own choosing; if none of those worked, the customer was out of luck<ref>{{cite web |last1=Crockett |first1=Zachary |title=The worst sales promotion in history |url=https://thehustle.co/the-worst-sales-promotion-in-history/?cmpid=email-hist-inside-history-2019-0806_Image1-08132019&om_rid=735949a4ca1960744f04623c61fa8e666992b47a7d93cf5b3284c03fc6b1948b&om_mid=712869778&kx_EmailCampaignID=33979&kx_EmailCampaignName=email-hist-inside-history-2019-0806_Image1-08132019&kx_EmailRecipientID=735949a4ca1960744f04623c61fa8e666992b47a7d93cf5b3284c03fc6b1948b |website=thehustle.co |accessdate=19 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the offer was for two round-trip tickets to select destinations in Europe, which proved highly successful in clearing the surplus. As few customers actually used the vouchers, Hoover expanded the offer to include destinations in the United States.\n\nAt this point, however, the consumer response increased enormously as Hoover was offering around \u00a3600 worth of airline tickets for an outlay of just \u00a3100. Customers opted to purchase the cheapest product that was enough to satisfy the \u00a3100 requirement, with some not even bothering to pick up the product they had purchased. The Hoover factory had to increase production and hire additional employees to meet demand for the cheapest qualifying vacuum cleaner.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIt was estimated that enough people tried to convert their vouchers to tickets to fill 500 [[Boeing 747]]s (the largest-capacity passenger planes of the time).{{cn|reason=by whom?|date=April 2020}}{{clarify|reason=exact number?|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Protests==\nIn 1993, the Hoover Holidays Pressure Group was formed, led by Harry Cichy and Sandy Jack, to protest that the company was not keeping its promises. Buying some shares in Hoover's parent company, [[Maytag]], the [[pressure group]] went to the Maytag [[Annual General Meeting]] in [[Newton, Iowa]]. Sandy Jack expressed his concerns to the [[CEO]] of Maytag, [[Len Hadley]]. The presence of the group made headline news on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and the front cover of ''[[The Des Moines Register]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/130339664/?terms=Hoover+flight+promotion|title=Free Vacuum Cleaner Travel agency deal on flights turns tables on Hoover fiasco|date= April 7, 1993|page=1|publisher=Des Moines Register|author=William Ryberg|accessdate=23 July 2017|url-access=subscription|via=newspapers.com}}</ref>\n\n==Repercussions and legal action==\nIn 1994, Jack took Hoover to court over the free flight promotion.

Beginning in 1992, Hoover offered free airline tickets that it could not afford, resulting in protest and legal action by customers who claimed not to have received tickets. The campaign was a financial setback for the company and led to the loss of Hoover's [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal Warrant]] after a 2004 BBC Documentary.\n\n==The promotion==\nThe promotion was created to sell surplus washing machines and vacuum cleaners. Hoover promised free airline tickets to customers who purchased a Hoover product worth at least [[British pound|\u00a3]]100. However, Hoover made the process of obtaining these flights annoyingly time-consuming:\n\n* A customer who bought a Hoover product for at least \u00a3100 had to mail in their receipt and an application within fourteen days of purchase.\n* Hoover sent a registration form; the customer had fourteen days to send it back.\n* Hoover sent a travel voucher; the customer had thirty days to select three combinations of departure airport, date, and destination. \n* Hoover had the right to reject the customer\u2019s choices; the customer could then select three alternatives.\n* Hoover also had the right to reject these alternatives and select three combinations of its own choosing; if none of those worked, the customer was out of luck.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Crockett |first1=Zachary |title=The worst sales promotion in history |url=https://thehustle.co/the-worst-sales-promotion-in-history/?cmpid=email-hist-inside-history-2019-0806_Image1-08132019&om_rid=735949a4ca1960744f04623c61fa8e666992b47a7d93cf5b3284c03fc6b1948b&om_mid=712869778&kx_EmailCampaignID=33979&kx_EmailCampaignName=email-hist-inside-history-2019-0806_Image1-08132019&kx_EmailRecipientID=735949a4ca1960744f04623c61fa8e666992b47a7d93cf5b3284c03fc6b1948b |website=thehustle.co |accessdate=19 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the offer was for two round-trip tickets to select destinations in Europe, which proved highly successful in clearing the surplus. As few customers actually used the vouchers, Hoover expanded the offer to include destinations in the United States.\n\nHowever, at this point, the consumer response increased enormously, as Hoover was offering around \u00a3600 worth of airline tickets for an outlay of just \u00a3100. Customers opted to purchase the cheapest product that was enough to satisfy the \u00a3100 requirement, with some not even bothering to pick up the product they had purchased. The Hoover factory had to increase production and hire additional employees to meet demand for the cheapest qualifying vacuum cleaner.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIt was estimated that enough people tried to convert their vouchers to tickets to fill 500 [[Boeing 747]]s (the largest-capacity passenger planes of the time).{{cn|reason=by whom?|date=April 2020}}{{clarify|reason=exact number?|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Protests==\nIn 1993, the Hoover Holidays Pressure Group was formed, led by Harry Cichy and Sandy Jack, to protest that the company was not keeping its promises.

Problems were anticipated, and arose, because many programs represented four-digit years with only the final two digits \u2013 making the year 2000 indistinguishable from 1900.  The assumption of a twentieth-century date in such programs could cause various errors, such as the incorrect display of dates and the inaccurate ordering of automated dated records or real-time events.\n\nIn 1997, the [[British Standards Institute]] (BSI) developed [[Technical standard|standard]] DISC PD2000-1 defining \"Year 2000 Conformity requirements\" as four rules:<ref name=\"BSI\">[http://www.empress.com/whatsnew/Y2K/bdd200.htm BSI Standard] on year 2000.</ref>\n\n# No valid date will cause any interruption in operations.<ref name=\"BSI\" />\n#Date-based functionality must behave consistently for dates prior to, during and after year 2000.<ref name=\"BSI\" />\n#In all interfaces and in all storage, the century must be unambiguous, either specified, or calculable by [[algorithm]].<ref name=\"BSI\" />\n#Year 2000 must be recognised as a leap year.<ref name=\"BSI\" />\n\nIt identifies two problems that may exist in many [[computer programs]]. First, the practice of representing the year with two digits became problematic with logical error(s) arising upon \"rollover\" from xx99 to xx00. This had caused some date-related processing to operate incorrectly for dates and times on and after 1 January 2000, and on other critical dates which were billed \"event horizons\". Without corrective action, long-working systems would break down when the \"... 97, 98, 99, 00 ...\" ascending numbering assumption suddenly became invalid.\n\nSecondly, some programmers had misunderstood the [[Gregorian calendar]] rule that determines whether years that are exactly divisible by 100 are not [[leap year]]s, and assumed that the year 2000 would not be a leap year. In reality, there is a rule in the Gregorian calendar system that states years divisible by 400 are leap years &ndash; thus making 2000 a leap year.\n\nCorrecting all of this, however, was not the largest part of the problem. By 1997, AT&T had estimated that \"60% of the time and money needed for its total compliance efforts\" would be devoted to testing the source code changes made to address the issue.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Testing for 2000 |magazine=[[InformationWeek]] |date=15 September 1997 |author1=Bruce Caldwell |author2=Andy Patrizio |pages=42\u201356 |via=ProQuest ABI/INFORM Collection}}</ref>\n\nCompanies and organisations in some countries, but not all, checked, fixed, and upgraded their computer systems to address the anticipated problem.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2000/02/leap-day-tuesday-last-y2k-worry |title=Leap Day Tuesday Last Y2K Worry |date=25 February 2000 |website=Wired |access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref> Very few computer failures were reported when the clocks rolled over into 2000.<ref name=\"bbc_boost\">{{cite news |last=Carrington |first=Damian |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/590932.stm |title=Was Y2K bug a boost? |date=4 January 2000 |access-date=19 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040422221434/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/590932.stm |archive-date=22 April 2004 |work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nY2K is a [[numeronym]] and was the common abbreviation for the year 2000 software problem. The abbreviation combines the letter ''Y'' for \"year\", the number 2 and a capitalized version of ''k'' for the SI unit prefix [[kilo-|kilo]] meaning 1000; hence, ''2K'' signifies 2000.

Back then, it was very important. We used to spend a lot of time running through various mathematical exercises before we started to write our programs so that they could be very clearly delimited with respect to space and the use of capacity. It never entered our minds that those programs would have lasted for more than a few years. As a consequence, they are very poorly documented.

Many tricks were used to squeeze needed data into fixed-field 80-character records. Saving two digits for every date field was significant in this effort.\n\nIn the 1960s, computer memory and mass storage were scarce and expensive. Early [[core memory]] cost one dollar per bit. Popular commercial computers, such as the [[IBM 1401]], shipped with as little as 2&nbsp;kilobytes of memory.<ref>The name IBM 1401 reflected the smallest amount of memory: 1,400 characters. {{Cite web |url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/140x/A24-1403-5_1401_Reference_Apr62.pdf |title=IBM 1401 Reference manual|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809033646/http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/140x/A24-1403-5_1401_Reference_Apr62.pdf|archive-date=9 August 2010}}</ref> Programs often mimicked card processing techniques. Commercial programming languages of the time, such as [[COBOL]] and [[IBM RPG|RPG]], processed numbers in their character representations. Over time the punched cards were converted to [[magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape]] and then disc files, but the structure of the data usually changed very little. Data was still input using punched cards until the mid-1970s. Machine architectures, programming languages and application designs were evolving rapidly. Neither managers nor programmers of that time expected their programs to remain in use for many decades. The realisation that databases were a new type of program with different characteristics had not yet come.\n\n====Early attention====\nThere were exceptions, of course. The first person known to publicly address this issue was [[Bob Bemer]], who had noticed it in 1958 as a result of work on genealogical software. He spent the next twenty years trying to make programmers, [[International Business Machines|IBM]], the [[Federal government of the United States|government of the United States]] and the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] aware of the problem, with little result. This included the recommendation that the COBOL [[Picture clause]] should be used to specify four digit years for dates.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A4138-2004Jun24.html |title=Key computer coding creator dies |date=25 June 2004 |work=The Washington Post |access-date=25 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s the brokerage industry began to address this issue, mostly because of bonds with maturity dates beyond the year 2000. By 1987 the [[New York Stock Exchange]] had reportedly spent over $20 million, including \"a team of 100\" programmers on Y2K.<ref name=\"Globe.Y2K\">{{Cite news |last=Andrew-Gee |first=Eric |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-y2k-20th-anniversary-how-canada-prepared |title=Y2K: The strange, true history of how Canada prepared for an apocalypse that never happened, but changed us all |date=28 December 2019 |work=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\nDespite magazine articles on the subject from 1970 onward, the majority of programmers and managers only started recognising Y2K as a looming problem in the mid-1990s, but even then, inertia and complacency caused it to be mostly unresolved until the last few years of the decade. In 1989, [[Erik Naggum]] was instrumental in ensuring that internet mail used four digit representations of years by including a strong recommendation to this effect in the internet host requirements document RFC 1123.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123 |title=Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Application and Support |date=October 1989 |editor-last=Braden |editor-first=Robert |publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force |access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref> On [[April Fools' Day]] of 1998 some companies set their mainframe computer dates to 2001, so that \"the wrong date will be perceived as good fun instead of bad computing\" while having a full day of testing.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[CIO magazine]] |date=15 November 1997 |title=Helpful Year 2000 hint |author=D.

Embedded systems with similar date logic were expected to malfunction and cause utilities and other crucial infrastructure to fail.\n\nSaving space on stored dates persisted into the Unix era, with most systems representing dates to a single 32-bit word, typically representing dates as [[Unix time|elapsed seconds from some fixed date]], which causes the similar [[Y2K38 problem]].\n\n===Resulting bugs from date programming===\n[[File:JavaScript getYear Method Problem.png|thumb|Webpage screenshots showing the [[JavaScript]] .getYear() method problem, which depicts the Year 2000 problem]]\n[[File:Apple Lisa Workshop.png|thumb|An [[Apple Lisa]] does not accept the date]]\nStorage of a combined date and time within a fixed binary field is often considered a solution, but the possibility for software to misinterpret dates remains because such date and time representations must be relative to some known origin. Rollover of such systems is still a problem but can happen at varying dates and can fail in various ways. For example:\n* An upscale grocer's 1997 credit-card caused crash of their 10 cash registers, repeatedly, due to year 2000 expiration dates, was the source of the first Y2K-related lawsuit.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[InformationWeek]] |date=15 September 1997 |page=50 |last=Patrizio |first=Andy |title=Visa Debits The Vendors}}</ref>\n* The [[Microsoft Excel]] spreadsheet program had a very elementary Y2K problem: Excel (in both Windows and Mac versions, when they are set to start at 1900) incorrectly set the year 1900 as a leap year for compatibility with Lotus 1-2-3.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/214326 |title=Microsoft Knowledge Base article 214326 |date=17 December 2015 |publisher=Microsoft Support |access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref> In addition, the years 2100, 2200, and so on, were regarded as leap years. This bug was fixed in later versions, but since the [[Epoch (computing)|epoch]] of the Excel timestamp was set to the meaningless date of [[0 January]] 1900 in previous versions, the year 1900 is still regarded as a leap year to maintain backward compatibility.\n* In the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], the standard library function to extract the year from a timestamp returns the year minus 1900. Many programs using functions from C, such as [[Perl]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], two programming languages widely used in web development, incorrectly treated this value as the last two digits of the year. On the web this was usually a harmless presentation bug, but it did cause many dynamically generated web pages to display 1 January 2000 as \"1/1/19100\", \"1/1/100\", or other variants, depending on the display format. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=\"many\". Please quantify and give examples of sites where this did or would have happened if not caught}}\n* [[JavaScript]] was changed due to concerns over the Y2K bug, and the return value for years changed and thus differed between versions from sometimes being a four digit representation and sometimes a two-digit representation forcing programmers to rewrite already working code to make sure web pages worked for all versions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://docs.sun.com/source/816-6410-10/date.htm#1194138 |title=JavaScript Reference Javascript 1.2 |publisher=Sun Microsystems |access-date=7 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://docs.sun.com/source/816-6408-10/date.htm#1194138 |title=JavaScript Reference Javascript 1.3 |publisher=Sun |access-date=7 June 2009}}</ref>\n* Older applications written for the commonly used UNIX [[Source Code Control System]] failed to handle years that began with the digit \"2\".\n* In the Windows 3.x file manager, dates displayed as 1/1/<!-- immutable date format-->19:0 for 1/<!-- immutable date format-->1/2000 (because the colon is the character after \"9\" in the [[ASCII]] character set). An update was available.\n* Some software, such as [[Math Blaster Episode I: In Search of Spot]] which only treats years as two-digit values instead of four, will give a given year as \"1900\", \"1901\", and so on, depending on the last two digits of the present year.\n\n===Date bugs similar to Y2K===\n{{main|Time formatting and storage bugs}}\n\n====4 January 1975====\nThis date overflowed the 12-bit field that had been used in the Decsystem 10 operating systems. There were numerous problems and crashes related to this bug while an alternative format was developed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/4.45.html |title=The Risks Digest Volume 4: Issue 45 |website=The Risks Digest}}</ref>\n\n====9 September 1999====\nEven before 1 January 2000 arrived, there were also some worries about 9 September 1999 (albeit less than those generated by Y2K). Because this date could also be written in the numeric format 9/9/99, it could have conflicted with the date value <code>9999</code>, frequently used to specify an unknown date. It was thus possible that database programs might act on the records containing unknown dates on that day. Data entry operators commonly entered 9999 into required fields for an unknown future date, (e.g., a termination date for cable television or telephone service), in order to process computer forms using [[CICS]] software.<ref>Stockton, J.R., \"[http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/critdate.htm Critical and Significant Dates]\" ''Merlyn''.</ref> Somewhat similar to this is the end-of-file code <code>9999</code>, used in older programming languages. While fears arose that some programs might unexpectedly terminate on that date, the bug was more likely to confuse computer operators than machines.\n\n====Leap years====\n{{Main|Zeller's congruence}}\nNormally, a year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by four. A year divisible by 100, however, is not a leap year in the Gregorian calendar unless it is also divisible by 400. For example, 1600 was a leap year, but 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not. Some programs may have relied on the oversimplified rule that ''a year divisible by four is a leap year''. This method works fine for the year 2000 (because it is a leap year), and will not become a problem until 2100, when older legacy programs will likely have long since been replaced. Other programs contained incorrect leap year logic, assuming for instance that no year divisible by 100 could be a leap year. An assessment of this ''leap year problem'' including a number of real life code fragments appeared in 1998.<ref>A. van Deursen, \"[http://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/~arie/papers/klint.pdf The Leap Year Problem]\" ''The Year/2000 Journal'' 2(4):65\u201370, July/August 1998.</ref> For information on why century years are treated differently, see [[Gregorian calendar]].\n\n====Year 2010 problem====\nSome systems had problems once the year rolled over to 2010. This was dubbed by some in the media as the \"Y2K+10\" or \"Y2.01K\" problem.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.crn.com.au/News/163864,bank-of-queensland-hit-by-y201k-glitch.aspx |title=Bank of Queensland hit by \"Y2.01k\" glitch |date=4 January 2010 |publisher=CRN |access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe main source of problems was confusion between hexadecimal number encoding and [[binary-coded decimal]] encodings of numbers. Both hexadecimal and BCD encode the numbers 0\u20139 as 0x0\u20130x9. But BCD encodes the number 10 as 0x10, whereas hexadecimal encodes the number 10 as 0x0A; 0x10 interpreted as a hexadecimal encoding represents the number 16.\n\nFor example, because the SMS protocol uses BCD for dates, some mobile phone software incorrectly reported dates of SMSes as 2016 instead of 2010. [[Windows Mobile]] is the first software reported to have been affected by this glitch; in some cases WM6 changes the date of any incoming SMS message sent after 1 January 2010 from the year \"2010\" to \"2016\".<ref name=\"wm6\">{{Cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10425455-56.html?tag=newsLatestHeadlinesArea.0#addcomm |title=Windows Mobile glitch dates 2010 texts 2016 |date=5 January 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"cellphone2010\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/windows-mobile-phones-suffer-y2k-10-bug-661062 |title=Windows Mobile phones suffer Y2K+10 bug |date=4 January 2010 |access-date=4 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023061135/http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/windows-mobile-phones-suffer-y2k-10-bug-661062 |archive-date=23 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOther systems affected include [[EFTPOS]] terminals,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.itwire.com/content/view/30308/53/ |title=Bank of Queensland vs Y2K \u2013 an update |date=4 January 2010}}</ref> and the [[PlayStation 3]] (except the Slim model).<ref name=\"PS3-1\">{{Cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/error-8001050f-takes-down-playstation-network-5482365|title=Error: 8001050F Takes Down PlayStation Network|website=Gizmodo}}</ref>\n\nThe most important occurrences of such a glitch were in Germany, where upwards of 20 million bank cards became unusable, and with Citibank Belgium, whose digipass customer identification chips failed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rtlinfo.be/info/monde/europe/297916/bug-de-l-an-2010-en-allemagne-plus-de-20-millions-de-cartes-bancaires-inutilisables |title=2010 Bug in Germany |date=5 January 2010 |publisher=RTL |language=French |access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Year 2038 problem====\n{{main|Year 2038 problem}}\n\nThe original [[Unix time]] datatype (<code>[[time_t]]</code>) stores a date and time as a signed long integer (on 32-bit systems a 32-bit integer) representing the number of seconds since 1 January 1970. During and after 2038, this number will exceed 2{{sup|31}}&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, the largest number representable by a signed [[long integer]] on 32-bit systems, causing the [[Year 2038 problem]] (also known as the Unix Millennium bug or [[Y2K38]]). As a long integer in 64-bit systems uses 64 bits, the problem does not realistically exist on 64-bit systems that use the [[LP64]] model.\n\n==Programming solutions{{anchor|bugfix}}==\nSeveral very different approaches were used to solve the Year 2000 problem in legacy systems. Five of them follow:\n;Date expansion\n: Two-digit years were expanded to include the century (becoming four-digit years) in programs, files, and databases. This was considered the \"purest\" solution, resulting in unambiguous dates that are permanent and easy to maintain. However, this method was costly, requiring massive testing and conversion efforts, and usually affecting entire systems.\n;Date compression\n: Dates can be compressed into binary 14-bit numbers.  This allows retention of [[data structure alignment]], using an [[integer]] value for years. Such a scheme is capable of representing 16384 different years; the exact scheme varies by the selection of [[Unix Epoch|epoch]].\n;Date re-partitioning\n: In legacy databases whose size could not be economically changed, six-digit year/month/day codes were converted to three-digit years (with 1999 represented as 099 and 2001 represented as 101, etc.) and three-digit days ([[ordinal date]] in year). Only input and output instructions for the date fields had to be modified, but most other date operations and whole record operations required no change. This delays the eventual roll-over problem to the end of the year 2899.\n;[[Date windowing|Windowing]]\n: Two-digit years were retained, and programs determined the century value only when needed for particular functions, such as date comparisons and calculations. (The century \"window\" refers to the 100-year period to which a date belongs.) This technique, which required installing small patches of code into programs, was simpler to test and implement than date expansion, thus much less costly. While not a permanent solution, windowing fixes were usually designed to work for several decades. This was thought acceptable, as older legacy systems tend to eventually get replaced by newer technology.<ref>\"''The Case for Windowing: Techniques That Buy 60 Years''\", article by Raymond B.

For example, they list \"01996\" as their year of founding.\n* While there was no one comprehensive internet Y2K effort, multiple internet trade associations and organisations banded together to form the Internet Year 2000 Campaign.<ref>[http://www.cybertelecom.org/year2000/ Internet Year 2000 Campaign] archived at Cybertelecom.</ref> This effort partnered with the White House's Internet Y2K Roundtable.\n\nThe Y2K issue was a major topic of discussion in the late 1990s and as such showed up in most popular media. A number of \"Y2K disaster\" books were published such as ''Deadline Y2K'' by Mark Joseph. Movies such as ''Y2K: Year to Kill'' capitalised on the currency of Y2K, as did numerous TV shows, comic strips, and computer games.\n\n==Fringe group responses==\nA variety of fringe groups and individuals such as those within some [[fundamentalist]] religious organizations, [[survivalists]], [[cults]], anti-social movements, [[self-sufficiency]] enthusiasts, [[communes]] and those attracted to [[conspiracy theories]], embraced Y2K as a tool to engender fear and provide a form of evidence for their respective theories. [[End of the world (civilization)|End-of-the-world]] scenarios and [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] themes were common in their communication.\n\nInterest in the survivalist movement peaked in 1999 in its second wave for that decade, triggered by Y2K fears. In the time before extensive efforts were made to rewrite computer programming codes to mitigate the possible impacts, some writers such as [[Gary North (economist)|Gary North]], [[Ed Yourdon]], [[James Howard Kunstler]],<ref name=\"y2k2\">{{Cite web |url=http://kunstler.com/mags_y2k.html |title=My Y2K\u2014A Personal Statement |last=Kunstler |first=Jim |year=1999 |publisher=Kunstler, Jim |access-date=12 December 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927062527/http://kunstler.com/mags_y2k.html |archive-date=27 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and Ed Yardeni anticipated widespread power outages, food and gasoline shortages, and other emergencies. North and others raised the alarm because they thought Y2K code fixes were not being made quickly enough. While a range of authors responded to this wave of concern, two of the most survival-focused texts to emerge were ''Boston on Y2K'' (1998) by [[Kenneth W. Royce]], and Mike Oehler's ''The Hippy Survival Guide to Y2K''.\n\nY2K was also exploited by some [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] and [[Charismatic Christianity|charismatic]] Christian leaders throughout the Western world, particularly in North America and Australia.<ref name=\"au.org\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.au.org/church-state/february-2000-church-state/featured/false-prophets-real-profits |title=False Prophets, Real Profits - Americans United |access-date=9 November 2016}}</ref> Their promotion of the perceived risks of Y2K was combined with [[end times]] thinking and [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] [[prophecies]] in an attempt to influence followers.<ref name=\"au.org\" /> The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported in late 1999, \"The Rev.

Problems were anticipated, and arose, because many programs represented four-digit years with only the final two digits \u2013 making the year 2000 indistinguishable from 1900.  The assumption of a twentieth-century date in such programs could cause various errors, such as the incorrect display of dates and the inaccurate ordering of automated dated records or real-time events.\n\nIn 1997, the [[British Standards Institute]] (BSI) developed [[Technical standard|standard]] DISC PD2000-1 defining \"Year 2000 Conformity requirements\" as four rules:<ref name=\"BSI\">[http://www.empress.com/whatsnew/Y2K/bdd200.htm BSI Standard] on year 2000.</ref>\n\n# No valid date will cause any interruption in operations.<ref name=\"BSI\" />\n#Date-based functionality must behave consistently for dates prior to, during and after year 2000.<ref name=\"BSI\" />\n#In all interfaces and in all storage, the century must be unambiguous, either specified, or calculable by [[algorithm]].<ref name=\"BSI\" />\n#Year 2000 must be recognised as a leap year.<ref name=\"BSI\" />\n\nIt identifies two problems that may exist in many [[computer programs]]. First, the practice of representing the year with two digits became problematic with logical error(s) arising upon \"rollover\" from xx99 to xx00. This had caused some date-related processing to operate incorrectly for dates and times on and after 1 January 2000, and on other critical dates which were billed \"event horizons\". Without corrective action, long-working systems would break down when the \"... 97, 98, 99, 00 ...\" ascending numbering assumption suddenly became invalid.\n\nSecondly, some programmers had misunderstood the [[Gregorian calendar]] rule that determines whether years that are exactly divisible by 100 are not [[leap year]]s, and assumed that the year 2000 would not be a leap year. In reality, there is a rule in the Gregorian calendar system that states years divisible by 400 are leap years &ndash; thus making 2000 a leap year.\n\nCorrecting all of this, however, was not the largest part of the problem. By 1997, AT&T had estimated that \"60% of the time and money needed for its total compliance efforts\" would be devoted to testing the source code changes made to address the issue.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Testing for 2000 |magazine=[[InformationWeek]] |date=15 September 1997 |author1=Bruce Caldwell |author2=Andy Patrizio |pages=42\u201356 |via=ProQuest ABI/INFORM Collection}}</ref>\n\nCompanies and organisations in some countries, but not all, checked, fixed, and upgraded their computer systems to address the anticipated problem.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2000/02/leap-day-tuesday-last-y2k-worry |title=Leap Day Tuesday Last Y2K Worry |date=25 February 2000 |website=Wired |access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref> Very few computer failures were reported when the clocks rolled over into 2000.<ref name=\"bbc_boost\">{{cite news |last=Carrington |first=Damian |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/590932.stm |title=Was Y2K bug a boost? |date=4 January 2000 |access-date=19 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040422221434/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/590932.stm |archive-date=22 April 2004 |work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nY2K is a [[numeronym]] and was the common abbreviation for the year 2000 software problem. The abbreviation combines the letter ''Y'' for \"year\", the number 2 and a capitalized version of ''k'' for the SI unit prefix [[kilo-|kilo]] meaning 1000; hence, ''2K'' signifies 2000. It was also named the \"Millennium Bug\" because it was associated with the popular (rather than literal) roll-over of the [[millennium]], even though most of the problems could have occurred at the end of ''any'' ordinary century.\n\n''[[Computerworld]]''{{'}}s 1993 three-page \"Doomsday 2000\" article by [[Peter de Jager]] was called \"the information-age equivalent of the midnight ride of Paul Revere\" by ''The New York Times''.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Eric Andrew-Gee |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-y2k-20th-anniversary-how-canada-prepared |title=Y2K: The strange, true history of how Canada prepared for an apocalypse that never happened, but changed us all |date=28 December 2019 |work=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Cory Johnson |date=29 December 1999 |title=Y2K Crier's Crisis |url=https://www.thestreet.com/opinion/y2k-criers-crisis-839189 |magazine=[[TheStreet]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Barnaby J.

Since programs could simply prefix \"19\" to the year of a date, most programs internally used, or stored on disc or tape, data files where the date format was six digits, in the form MMDDYY, MM as two digits for the month, DD as two digits for the day, and YY as two digits for the year. As space on disc and tape was also expensive, this also saved money by reducing the size of stored data files and data bases.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.comlinks.com/mag/accr.htm |title=Accrued Savings of the Year 2000 Computer Date Problem |last=Kappelman |first=Leon |last2=Scott |first2=Phil |date=25 November 1996 |website=Computerworld}}</ref>\n\nSome programs, when facing two digit years, could not distinguish between 2000 and 1900.

I used to write those programs back in the 1960s and 1970s, and was proud of the fact that I was able to squeeze a few elements of space out of my program by not having to put a 19 before the year. Back then, it was very important. We used to spend a lot of time running through various mathematical exercises before we started to write our programs so that they could be very clearly delimited with respect to space and the use of capacity. It never entered our minds that those programs would have lasted for more than a few years. As a consequence, they are very poorly documented. If I were to go back and look at some of the programs I wrote 30 years ago, I would have one terribly difficult time working my way through step-by-step.\"|\u2014[[Alan Greenspan]], 1998<ref>Testimony by [[Alan Greenspan]], ex-Chairman of the [[Federal Reserve]] before the [[Senate Banking Committee]], 25 February 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-16-057997-4}}</ref>}}\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, well before the computer era, business data processing was done using [[unit record equipment]] and [[punched card]]s, most commonly the 80-column variety employed by IBM, which dominated the industry. Many tricks were used to squeeze needed data into fixed-field 80-character records. Saving two digits for every date field was significant in this effort.\n\nIn the 1960s, computer memory and mass storage were scarce and expensive. Early [[core memory]] cost one dollar per bit. Popular commercial computers, such as the [[IBM 1401]], shipped with as little as 2&nbsp;kilobytes of memory.<ref>The name IBM 1401 reflected the smallest amount of memory: 1,400 characters. {{Cite web |url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/140x/A24-1403-5_1401_Reference_Apr62.pdf |title=IBM 1401 Reference manual|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809033646/http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/140x/A24-1403-5_1401_Reference_Apr62.pdf|archive-date=9 August 2010}}</ref> Programs often mimicked card processing techniques. Commercial programming languages of the time, such as [[COBOL]] and [[IBM RPG|RPG]], processed numbers in their character representations. Over time the punched cards were converted to [[magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape]] and then disc files, but the structure of the data usually changed very little. Data was still input using punched cards until the mid-1970s. Machine architectures, programming languages and application designs were evolving rapidly. Neither managers nor programmers of that time expected their programs to remain in use for many decades. The realisation that databases were a new type of program with different characteristics had not yet come.\n\n====Early attention====\nThere were exceptions, of course. The first person known to publicly address this issue was [[Bob Bemer]], who had noticed it in 1958 as a result of work on genealogical software. He spent the next twenty years trying to make programmers, [[International Business Machines|IBM]], the [[Federal government of the United States|government of the United States]] and the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] aware of the problem, with little result. This included the recommendation that the COBOL [[Picture clause]] should be used to specify four digit years for dates.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A4138-2004Jun24.html |title=Key computer coding creator dies |date=25 June 2004 |work=The Washington Post |access-date=25 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s the brokerage industry began to address this issue, mostly because of bonds with maturity dates beyond the year 2000. By 1987 the [[New York Stock Exchange]] had reportedly spent over $20 million, including \"a team of 100\" programmers on Y2K.<ref name=\"Globe.Y2K\">{{Cite news |last=Andrew-Gee |first=Eric |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-y2k-20th-anniversary-how-canada-prepared |title=Y2K: The strange, true history of how Canada prepared for an apocalypse that never happened, but changed us all |date=28 December 2019 |work=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\nDespite magazine articles on the subject from 1970 onward, the majority of programmers and managers only started recognising Y2K as a looming problem in the mid-1990s, but even then, inertia and complacency caused it to be mostly unresolved until the last few years of the decade. In 1989, [[Erik Naggum]] was instrumental in ensuring that internet mail used four digit representations of years by including a strong recommendation to this effect in the internet host requirements document RFC 1123.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123 |title=Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Application and Support |date=October 1989 |editor-last=Braden |editor-first=Robert |publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force |access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref> On [[April Fools' Day]] of 1998 some companies set their mainframe computer dates to 2001, so that \"the wrong date will be perceived as good fun instead of bad computing\" while having a full day of testing.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[CIO magazine]] |date=15 November 1997 |title=Helpful Year 2000 hint |author=D. Kolstedt |page=12}}</ref>\n\nWhile using 3 digit years and 3 digit dates within that year was used by some, others chose to use the number of days since a fixed date, such as 1 January 1900.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[InformationWeek]] |quote=extends .. the 23rd century |title=Thinking Ahead  |date=28 October 1996  |page=8}}</ref> Inaction was not an option, and risked major failure. Embedded systems with similar date logic were expected to malfunction and cause utilities and other crucial infrastructure to fail.\n\nSaving space on stored dates persisted into the Unix era, with most systems representing dates to a single 32-bit word, typically representing dates as [[Unix time|elapsed seconds from some fixed date]], which causes the similar [[Y2K38 problem]].\n\n===Resulting bugs from date programming===\n[[File:JavaScript getYear Method Problem.png|thumb|Webpage screenshots showing the [[JavaScript]] .getYear() method problem, which depicts the Year 2000 problem]]\n[[File:Apple Lisa Workshop.png|thumb|An [[Apple Lisa]] does not accept the date]]\nStorage of a combined date and time within a fixed binary field is often considered a solution, but the possibility for software to misinterpret dates remains because such date and time representations must be relative to some known origin. Rollover of such systems is still a problem but can happen at varying dates and can fail in various ways. For example:\n* An upscale grocer's 1997 credit-card caused crash of their 10 cash registers, repeatedly, due to year 2000 expiration dates, was the source of the first Y2K-related lawsuit.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[InformationWeek]] |date=15 September 1997 |page=50 |last=Patrizio |first=Andy |title=Visa Debits The Vendors}}</ref>\n* The [[Microsoft Excel]] spreadsheet program had a very elementary Y2K problem: Excel (in both Windows and Mac versions, when they are set to start at 1900) incorrectly set the year 1900 as a leap year for compatibility with Lotus 1-2-3.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/214326 |title=Microsoft Knowledge Base article 214326 |date=17 December 2015 |publisher=Microsoft Support |access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref> In addition, the years 2100, 2200, and so on, were regarded as leap years. This bug was fixed in later versions, but since the [[Epoch (computing)|epoch]] of the Excel timestamp was set to the meaningless date of [[0 January]] 1900 in previous versions, the year 1900 is still regarded as a leap year to maintain backward compatibility.\n* In the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], the standard library function to extract the year from a timestamp returns the year minus 1900. Many programs using functions from C, such as [[Perl]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], two programming languages widely used in web development, incorrectly treated this value as the last two digits of the year. On the web this was usually a harmless presentation bug, but it did cause many dynamically generated web pages to display 1 January 2000 as \"1/1/19100\", \"1/1/100\", or other variants, depending on the display format. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=\"many\". Please quantify and give examples of sites where this did or would have happened if not caught}}\n* [[JavaScript]] was changed due to concerns over the Y2K bug, and the return value for years changed and thus differed between versions from sometimes being a four digit representation and sometimes a two-digit representation forcing programmers to rewrite already working code to make sure web pages worked for all versions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://docs.sun.com/source/816-6410-10/date.htm#1194138 |title=JavaScript Reference Javascript 1.2 |publisher=Sun Microsystems |access-date=7 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://docs.sun.com/source/816-6408-10/date.htm#1194138 |title=JavaScript Reference Javascript 1.3 |publisher=Sun |access-date=7 June 2009}}</ref>\n* Older applications written for the commonly used UNIX [[Source Code Control System]] failed to handle years that began with the digit \"2\".\n* In the Windows 3.x file manager, dates displayed as 1/1/<!-- immutable date format-->19:0 for 1/<!-- immutable date format-->1/2000 (because the colon is the character after \"9\" in the [[ASCII]] character set). An update was available.\n* Some software, such as [[Math Blaster Episode I: In Search of Spot]] which only treats years as two-digit values instead of four, will give a given year as \"1900\", \"1901\", and so on, depending on the last two digits of the present year.\n\n===Date bugs similar to Y2K===\n{{main|Time formatting and storage bugs}}\n\n====4 January 1975====\nThis date overflowed the 12-bit field that had been used in the Decsystem 10 operating systems. There were numerous problems and crashes related to this bug while an alternative format was developed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/4.45.html |title=The Risks Digest Volume 4: Issue 45 |website=The Risks Digest}}</ref>\n\n====9 September 1999====\nEven before 1 January 2000 arrived, there were also some worries about 9 September 1999 (albeit less than those generated by Y2K). Because this date could also be written in the numeric format 9/9/99, it could have conflicted with the date value <code>9999</code>, frequently used to specify an unknown date. It was thus possible that database programs might act on the records containing unknown dates on that day. Data entry operators commonly entered 9999 into required fields for an unknown future date, (e.g., a termination date for cable television or telephone service), in order to process computer forms using [[CICS]] software.<ref>Stockton, J.R., \"[http://www.merlyn.demon.co.uk/critdate.htm Critical and Significant Dates]\" ''Merlyn''.</ref> Somewhat similar to this is the end-of-file code <code>9999</code>, used in older programming languages. While fears arose that some programs might unexpectedly terminate on that date, the bug was more likely to confuse computer operators than machines.\n\n====Leap years====\n{{Main|Zeller's congruence}}\nNormally, a year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by four. A year divisible by 100, however, is not a leap year in the Gregorian calendar unless it is also divisible by 400. For example, 1600 was a leap year, but 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not. Some programs may have relied on the oversimplified rule that ''a year divisible by four is a leap year''. This method works fine for the year 2000 (because it is a leap year), and will not become a problem until 2100, when older legacy programs will likely have long since been replaced. Other programs contained incorrect leap year logic, assuming for instance that no year divisible by 100 could be a leap year. An assessment of this ''leap year problem'' including a number of real life code fragments appeared in 1998.<ref>A. van Deursen, \"[http://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/~arie/papers/klint.pdf The Leap Year Problem]\" ''The Year/2000 Journal'' 2(4):65\u201370, July/August 1998.</ref> For information on why century years are treated differently, see [[Gregorian calendar]].\n\n====Year 2010 problem====\nSome systems had problems once the year rolled over to 2010. This was dubbed by some in the media as the \"Y2K+10\" or \"Y2.01K\" problem.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.crn.com.au/News/163864,bank-of-queensland-hit-by-y201k-glitch.aspx |title=Bank of Queensland hit by \"Y2.01k\" glitch |date=4 January 2010 |publisher=CRN |access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe main source of problems was confusion between hexadecimal number encoding and [[binary-coded decimal]] encodings of numbers. Both hexadecimal and BCD encode the numbers 0\u20139 as 0x0\u20130x9. But BCD encodes the number 10 as 0x10, whereas hexadecimal encodes the number 10 as 0x0A; 0x10 interpreted as a hexadecimal encoding represents the number 16.\n\nFor example, because the SMS protocol uses BCD for dates, some mobile phone software incorrectly reported dates of SMSes as 2016 instead of 2010.

During and after 2038, this number will exceed 2{{sup|31}}&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, the largest number representable by a signed [[long integer]] on 32-bit systems, causing the [[Year 2038 problem]] (also known as the Unix Millennium bug or [[Y2K38]]). As a long integer in 64-bit systems uses 64 bits, the problem does not realistically exist on 64-bit systems that use the [[LP64]] model.\n\n==Programming solutions{{anchor|bugfix}}==\nSeveral very different approaches were used to solve the Year 2000 problem in legacy systems. Five of them follow:\n;Date expansion\n: Two-digit years were expanded to include the century (becoming four-digit years) in programs, files, and databases. This was considered the \"purest\" solution, resulting in unambiguous dates that are permanent and easy to maintain. However, this method was costly, requiring massive testing and conversion efforts, and usually affecting entire systems.\n;Date compression\n: Dates can be compressed into binary 14-bit numbers.  This allows retention of [[data structure alignment]], using an [[integer]] value for years. Such a scheme is capable of representing 16384 different years; the exact scheme varies by the selection of [[Unix Epoch|epoch]].\n;Date re-partitioning\n: In legacy databases whose size could not be economically changed, six-digit year/month/day codes were converted to three-digit years (with 1999 represented as 099 and 2001 represented as 101, etc.) and three-digit days ([[ordinal date]] in year). Only input and output instructions for the date fields had to be modified, but most other date operations and whole record operations required no change. This delays the eventual roll-over problem to the end of the year 2899.\n;[[Date windowing|Windowing]]\n: Two-digit years were retained, and programs determined the century value only when needed for particular functions, such as date comparisons and calculations. (The century \"window\" refers to the 100-year period to which a date belongs.) This technique, which required installing small patches of code into programs, was simpler to test and implement than date expansion, thus much less costly. While not a permanent solution, windowing fixes were usually designed to work for several decades. This was thought acceptable, as older legacy systems tend to eventually get replaced by newer technology.<ref>\"''The Case for Windowing: Techniques That Buy 60 Years''\", article by Raymond B.

For example, they list \"01996\" as their year of founding.\n* While there was no one comprehensive internet Y2K effort, multiple internet trade associations and organisations banded together to form the Internet Year 2000 Campaign.<ref>[http://www.cybertelecom.org/year2000/ Internet Year 2000 Campaign] archived at Cybertelecom.</ref> This effort partnered with the White House's Internet Y2K Roundtable.\n\nThe Y2K issue was a major topic of discussion in the late 1990s and as such showed up in most popular media. A number of \"Y2K disaster\" books were published such as ''Deadline Y2K'' by Mark Joseph. Movies such as ''Y2K: Year to Kill'' capitalised on the currency of Y2K, as did numerous TV shows, comic strips, and computer games.\n\n==Fringe group responses==\nA variety of fringe groups and individuals such as those within some [[fundamentalist]] religious organizations, [[survivalists]], [[cults]], anti-social movements, [[self-sufficiency]] enthusiasts, [[communes]] and those attracted to [[conspiracy theories]], embraced Y2K as a tool to engender fear and provide a form of evidence for their respective theories. [[End of the world (civilization)|End-of-the-world]] scenarios and [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] themes were common in their communication.\n\nInterest in the survivalist movement peaked in 1999 in its second wave for that decade, triggered by Y2K fears. In the time before extensive efforts were made to rewrite computer programming codes to mitigate the possible impacts, some writers such as [[Gary North (economist)|Gary North]], [[Ed Yourdon]], [[James Howard Kunstler]],<ref name=\"y2k2\">{{Cite web |url=http://kunstler.com/mags_y2k.html |title=My Y2K\u2014A Personal Statement |last=Kunstler |first=Jim |year=1999 |publisher=Kunstler, Jim |access-date=12 December 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927062527/http://kunstler.com/mags_y2k.html |archive-date=27 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and Ed Yardeni anticipated widespread power outages, food and gasoline shortages, and other emergencies. North and others raised the alarm because they thought Y2K code fixes were not being made quickly enough. While a range of authors responded to this wave of concern, two of the most survival-focused texts to emerge were ''Boston on Y2K'' (1998) by [[Kenneth W. Royce]], and Mike Oehler's ''The Hippy Survival Guide to Y2K''.\n\nY2K was also exploited by some [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] and [[Charismatic Christianity|charismatic]] Christian leaders throughout the Western world, particularly in North America and Australia.<ref name=\"au.org\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.au.org/church-state/february-2000-church-state/featured/false-prophets-real-profits |title=False Prophets, Real Profits - Americans United |access-date=9 November 2016}}</ref> Their promotion of the perceived risks of Y2K was combined with [[end times]] thinking and [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] [[prophecies]] in an attempt to influence followers.<ref name=\"au.org\" /> The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported in late 1999, \"The Rev.

The ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' noted this in their article, \"Apocalypse Now\u2009\u2014\u2009Y2K spurs fears\", where they reported the increased call for repentance in the populace in order to avoid God's wrath.<ref>Rivera, J., 17 February 1999, \"Apocalypse Now \u2013 Y2K spurs fears\", ''The Baltimore Sun''</ref> Christian leader, [[Col Stringer]], in his commentary has published, \"Fear-creating writers sold over 45 million books citing every conceivable catastrophe from civil war, planes dropping from the sky to the end of the civilised world as we know it.

It is not clear how commonly, if at all, the word was used as an ethnonym in Old High German.\n\nUsed as a noun, ''ein diutscher'' in the sense of \"a German\" emerges in [[Middle High German]], attested from the second half of the 12th century.<ref>\ne.g. [[Walther von der Vogelweide]]. See [[Matthias von Lexer|Lexer]], ''Mittelhochdeutsches Handw\u00f6rterbuch'' (1872\u20131878), s.v. \"Diutsche\".\nThe Middle High German [[Song of Roland]] (ca. 1170) has  ''in diutisker erde'' (65.6) for \"in the German realm, in Germany\".\nThe phrase ''in t\u00fctschem land'', whence the modern ''[[Deutschland]]'', is attested in the late 15th century (e.g. [[Johann Geiler von Kaysersberg]], [[Ship of Fools (satire)|Ship of Fools]], see Grimm, ''[[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]]'', s.v. \"Deutsch\").</ref>\n\nThe [[Old French]] term ''alemans'' is taken from the name of the [[Alamanni]]. It was loaned into [[Middle English]] as ''almains'' in the early 14th century.

The fairy tales collections collected and published by [[Brothers Grimm|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]] in the 19th century became famous throughout the world.\n\nTheologian [[Martin Luther|Luther]], who translated the Bible into German, is widely credited for having set the basis for the modern \"High German\" language. Among the most admired German poets and authors are [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Heinrich von Kleist|Kleist]], [[E.T.A.

The rise of the modern natural sciences and the related decline of religion raised a series of questions, which recur throughout German philosophy, concerning the relationships between knowledge and faith, reason and emotion, and scientific, ethical, and artistic ways of seeing the world.\n[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]]]\n\n[[List of German-language philosophers|German philosophers]] have helped shape [[western philosophy]] from as early as the Middle Ages ([[Albertus Magnus]]). Later, [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] (17th century) and most importantly [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] played central roles in the [[history of philosophy]]. [[Kantianism]] inspired the work of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and [[Nietzsche]] as well as [[German idealism]] defended by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]. [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] helped develop [[communist theory]] in the second half of the 19th century while [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]] pursued the tradition of German philosophy in the 20th century. A number of German intellectuals were also influential in [[sociology]], most notably [[Theodor Adorno|Adorno]], [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas|Habermas]], [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]], [[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]],  [[Georg Simmel|Simmel]], [[Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies|T\u00f6nnies]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]]. The [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] founded in 1810 by linguist and philosopher [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] served as an influential model for a number of modern western universities.\n\nIn the 21st century, Germany has been an important country for the development of contemporary [[analytic philosophy]] in continental Europe, along with France, Austria, Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries.<ref>Searle, John.

The wars launched a new movement that was born in France itself during the French Revolution. Nationalism during the 19th century threatened the old aristocratic regimes. Many ethnic groups of Central and Eastern Europe had been divided for centuries, ruled over by the old Monarchies of the [[Romanovs]] and the [[Habsburgs]]. Germans, for the most part, had been a loose and disunited people since the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] when the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was shattered into a patchwork of states.

Both sought to expand their influence and territory. The Austrian Empire \u2013 like the [[Holy Roman Empire]] \u2013 was a multi-ethnic state, but German-speaking people there did not have an absolute numerical majority; the creation of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was one result of the growing nationalism of other ethnicities especially the [[Hungarians]] in Austrian territory. Prussia under [[Otto von Bismarck]] would eventually ride on the coat-tails of nationalism to unite all of modern-day Germany. Following several wars, most notably the  [[Austro-Prussian war|German war]] in 1866 between the two most powerful German states, Austria and Prussia, with the latter being victorious, the [[German Empire]] (\"Second Reich\") was created in 1871 as \"Little Germany\" without Austria following the proclamation of [[Wilhelm I]] as head of a union of German-speaking states, while disregarding millions of its non-German subjects who desired self-determination from German rule.\n\nThe creation of the multi-ethnic Austria-Hungary empire created strong ethnic conflict between the different ethnicities of the empire.

Nationalism and Pan-Germanism became almost taboo because they had been used so destructively by the Nazis. Indeed, the word \"Volksdeutscher\" in reference to ethnic Germans naturalized during WWII later developed into a mild epithet.\n\nFrom the 1960s, Germany also saw increasing immigration, especially from Turkey, under an official programme aimed at encouraging \"[[Gastarbeiter]]\" or guestworkers to the country to provide labour during the post-war economic boom years. Although it had been expected that such workers would return home, many settled in Germany, with their descendants becoming German citizens.<ref name=\"Spiegel\">[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/at-home-in-a-foreign-country-german-turks-struggle-to-find-their-identity-a-795299.html At Home in a Foreign Country: German Turks Struggle to Find Their Identity], Spiegel Online.</ref>\n\n===1990\u2013present===\n{{Further|German reunification}}\n\nHowever, [[German reunification]] in 1990 revived the old debates.

It is not clear how commonly, if at all, the word was used as an ethnonym in Old High German.\n\nUsed as a noun, ''ein diutscher'' in the sense of \"a German\" emerges in [[Middle High German]], attested from the second half of the 12th century.<ref>\ne.g. [[Walther von der Vogelweide]]. See [[Matthias von Lexer|Lexer]], ''Mittelhochdeutsches Handw\u00f6rterbuch'' (1872\u20131878), s.v. \"Diutsche\".\nThe Middle High German [[Song of Roland]] (ca. 1170) has  ''in diutisker erde'' (65.6) for \"in the German realm, in Germany\".\nThe phrase ''in t\u00fctschem land'', whence the modern ''[[Deutschland]]'', is attested in the late 15th century (e.g. [[Johann Geiler von Kaysersberg]], [[Ship of Fools (satire)|Ship of Fools]], see Grimm, ''[[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]]'', s.v. \"Deutsch\").</ref>\n\nThe [[Old French]] term ''alemans'' is taken from the name of the [[Alamanni]]. It was loaned into [[Middle English]] as ''almains'' in the early 14th century. The word ''Dutch'' is attested in English from the 14th century, denoting continental West Germanic (\"Dutch\" and \"German\") dialects and their speakers.<ref>''OED'', s.v.

In [[Slavic languages]], the Germans were given the name of   ''{{lang|sla|n\u011bm\u044cci}} '' (singular ''{{lang|sla|n\u011bm\u044cc\u044c}}''), originally meaning \"mute.\"\n\nThe English term ''Germans'' is only attested from the mid-16th century, based on the classical Latin term ''Germani'' used by [[Julius Caesar]] and later [[Tacitus]].

Along the trade routes, Hanseatic trade stations became centers of the German culture. [[German town law]] ''(Stadtrecht)'' was promoted by the presence of large, relatively wealthy German populations, their influence and political power. Thus people who would be considered \"Germans\", with a common culture, language, and [[worldview]] different from that of the surrounding rural peoples, colonized trading towns as far north of present-day Germany as [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] (in [[Norway]]), [[Stockholm]] (in [[Sweden]]), and [[Vyborg]] (now in Russia). The Hanseatic League was not exclusively German in any ethnic sense: many towns who joined the league were outside the Holy Roman Empire and a number of them may only loosely be characterized as ''German''. The Empire itself was not entirely German either. It had a multi-ethnic and multi-lingual structure, some of the smaller ethnicities and languages used at different times were Dutch, Italian, French, Czech and Polish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dhm.de/ausstellungen/heiliges-roemisches-reich/index_3.html|title=Heiliges R\u00f6misches Reich Deutscher Nation|website=Dhm.de|accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy the [[Middle Ages]], large numbers of [[Jews]] lived in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and had assimilated into German culture, including many Jews who had previously assimilated into French culture and had spoken a mixed Judeo-French language.<ref name=\"Ulrich Ammon 2006\">Ulrich Ammon, Norbert Dittmar, Klaus J.

The [[Thirty Years' War]], a series of conflicts fought mainly in the territory of modern Germany, weakened the coherence of the Holy Roman Empire, leading to the emergence of different, smaller German states known as ''[[Kleinstaaterei]]'' in [[18th-century Germany]].\n\nThe [[Napoleonic Wars]] were the cause of the final dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, and ultimately the cause for the quest for a German [[nation state]] in 19th-century [[German nationalism]]. After the [[Congress of Vienna]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Prussia]] emerged as two competitors. Austria, trying to remain the dominant power in Central Europe, led the way in the terms of the Congress of Vienna. The Congress of Vienna was essentially conservative, assuring that little would change in Europe and preventing Germany from uniting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colby.edu/personal/r/rmscheck/GermanyA3.html|title=Raffael Scheck's Web Page \u00bb Raffael Scheck's Home Page|website=Colby.edu|accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref> These terms came to a sudden halt following the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolutions of 1848]] and the [[Crimean War]] in 1856, paving the way for [[German unification]] in the 1860s.

The fairy tales collections collected and published by [[Brothers Grimm|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]] in the 19th century became famous throughout the world.\n\nTheologian [[Martin Luther|Luther]], who translated the Bible into German, is widely credited for having set the basis for the modern \"High German\" language. Among the most admired German poets and authors are [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Heinrich von Kleist|Kleist]], [[E.T.A.

The rise of the modern natural sciences and the related decline of religion raised a series of questions, which recur throughout German philosophy, concerning the relationships between knowledge and faith, reason and emotion, and scientific, ethical, and artistic ways of seeing the world.\n[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]]]\n\n[[List of German-language philosophers|German philosophers]] have helped shape [[western philosophy]] from as early as the Middle Ages ([[Albertus Magnus]]). Later, [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] (17th century) and most importantly [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] played central roles in the [[history of philosophy]]. [[Kantianism]] inspired the work of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and [[Nietzsche]] as well as [[German idealism]] defended by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]. [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] helped develop [[communist theory]] in the second half of the 19th century while [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]] pursued the tradition of German philosophy in the 20th century. A number of German intellectuals were also influential in [[sociology]], most notably [[Theodor Adorno|Adorno]], [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas|Habermas]], [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]], [[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]],  [[Georg Simmel|Simmel]], [[Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies|T\u00f6nnies]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]]. The [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] founded in 1810 by linguist and philosopher [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] served as an influential model for a number of modern western universities.\n\nIn the 21st century, Germany has been an important country for the development of contemporary [[analytic philosophy]] in continental Europe, along with France, Austria, Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries.<ref>Searle, John.

Germans, for the most part, had been a loose and disunited people since the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] when the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was shattered into a patchwork of states.

Both sought to expand their influence and territory. The Austrian Empire \u2013 like the [[Holy Roman Empire]] \u2013 was a multi-ethnic state, but German-speaking people there did not have an absolute numerical majority; the creation of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was one result of the growing nationalism of other ethnicities especially the [[Hungarians]] in Austrian territory. Prussia under [[Otto von Bismarck]] would eventually ride on the coat-tails of nationalism to unite all of modern-day Germany. Following several wars, most notably the  [[Austro-Prussian war|German war]] in 1866 between the two most powerful German states, Austria and Prussia, with the latter being victorious, the [[German Empire]] (\"Second Reich\") was created in 1871 as \"Little Germany\" without Austria following the proclamation of [[Wilhelm I]] as head of a union of German-speaking states, while disregarding millions of its non-German subjects who desired self-determination from German rule.\n\nThe creation of the multi-ethnic Austria-Hungary empire created strong ethnic conflict between the different ethnicities of the empire.

Indeed, the word \"Volksdeutscher\" in reference to ethnic Germans naturalized during WWII later developed into a mild epithet.\n\nFrom the 1960s, Germany also saw increasing immigration, especially from Turkey, under an official programme aimed at encouraging \"[[Gastarbeiter]]\" or guestworkers to the country to provide labour during the post-war economic boom years. Although it had been expected that such workers would return home, many settled in Germany, with their descendants becoming German citizens.<ref name=\"Spiegel\">[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/at-home-in-a-foreign-country-german-turks-struggle-to-find-their-identity-a-795299.html At Home in a Foreign Country: German Turks Struggle to Find Their Identity], Spiegel Online.</ref>\n\n===1990\u2013present===\n{{Further|German reunification}}\n\nHowever, [[German reunification]] in 1990 revived the old debates.

The evolution in Germany's national identity stems from focusing less on its [[Nazi]] past and more on its Prussian history, which many Germans believe was betrayed\u2014and not represented\u2014by [[Nazism]].<ref name=\"Heilbrunn\"/> The evolution is further precipitated by Germany's conspicuous position as Europe's strongest economy. Indeed, this German sphere of influence has been welcomed by the countries that border it, as demonstrated by Polish foreign minister [[Radek Sikorski]]'s effusive praise for his country's western neighbor.<ref name=\"Heilbrunn\"/> This shift in thinking is boosted by a newer generation of Germans who see World War II as a distant memory.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Demographics of Germany]]\n* [[Anti-German sentiment]]\n* [[Die Deutschen]], ZDF's documentary television series\n* [[Ethnic groups in Europe]]\n* [[Genetic history of Europe]]\n* [[German eastward expansion]]\n* [[List of Alsatians and Lorrainians]]\n* [[List of Austrians]]\n* [[List of ancient Germanic peoples]]\n* [[List of Swiss people]]\n* [[List of terms used for Germans]]\n* [[Names for the German language]]\n* [[Organised persecution of ethnic Germans]]\n\n{{Portal bar|Ancient Germanic culture|Germany|Austria|Switzerland|Luxembourg|Germans}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* Bryce, Benjamin.

Detroit manufacturers such as [[Packard Motor Car Company|Packard]] and [[Hudson Motor Car Company|Hudson]] merged into other companies and eventually disappeared. At its peak population of 1,849,568, in the [[1950 United States Census|1950 Census]], the city was the 5th-largest in the United States, after New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles.\n\nIn this postwar era, the auto industry continued to create opportunities for many African Americans from the South, who continued with their [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to Detroit and other northern and western cities to escape the strict [[Jim Crow]] laws and racial discrimination policies of the South. As before the war, competition had been fierce for employment, housing, and land. Racial discrimination took place in employment, keeping the work force and better jobs predominantly white. These unequal opportunities in employment resulted in unequal housing opportunities for the majority of the black community. Despite changes in demographics, for instance, Detroit's police force, fire department, and other city jobs were held by predominately white residents.\n\nThe surge in Detroit's black population with the Great Migration augmented the strain on housing scarcity. Black people were often turned away from bank loans to obtain housing and interest rates, and rents were unfairly inflated to prevent their moving into white neighborhoods. Such discrimination also took place due to [[redlining]] by banks and federal housing policy, which limited the ability of blacks to improve their housing, and encouraged white people to guard the racial divide that defined their neighborhoods. This marginalized the agency of black Detroiters\u2014another important aspect in the history of postwar Detroit.<ref name=\"The Origins of the Urban Crisis\">{{cite book |last1=Sugrue |first1=Thomas |title=The Origins of the Urban Crisis |year=2005 |publisher=Princeton University Press}}</ref>\n\n[[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#1950|As in other major American cities]] in the postwar era, construction of a federally subsidized, extensive highway and freeway system around Detroit, and pent-up demand for new housing stimulated suburbanization; highways made commuting by car easier. However, this construction had negative implications for many urban residents. Highways were constructed through neighborhoods of poor and minority residents who had less political power to oppose them. (The neighborhoods were mostly low income or considered blighted, made up of older housing, where investment had been lacking due to racial redlining, so the highways were presented as a kind of urban renewal.) They displaced residents with little consideration of the effects of breaking up functioning neighborhoods.<ref name=\"The Origins of the Urban Crisis\"/> \n\nIn 1956, Detroit's last heavily used [[streetcar|electric streetcar line]], which traveled along the length of Woodward Avenue, was removed and replaced with gas-powered buses.

[[Martin Luther King Jr.]] gave a [[Detroit Walk to Freedom|major speech]] as part of a civil rights march in Detroit that foreshadowed his \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech in Washington, D.C., two months later. While the [[civil rights movement]] gained significant federal civil rights laws in 1964 and 1965, longstanding inequities resulted in confrontations between the police and inner city black youth who wanted change. \n\nLongstanding tensions in Detroit culminated in the [[1967 Detroit riot|Twelfth Street riot]] in July 1967. Governor [[George W. Romney]] ordered the [[Michigan National Guard]] into Detroit, and President Johnson sent in U.S. Army troops. The result was 43 dead, 467 injured, over 7,200 arrests, and more than 2,000 buildings destroyed, mostly in black residential and business areas. Thousands of small businesses closed permanently or relocated to safer neighborhoods.

The NAACP argued that although schools were not legally segregated, the city of Detroit and its surrounding counties had enacted policies to maintain [[Racial segregation in the United States#Education|racial segregation]] in public schools. The NAACP also suggested a direct relationship between unfair housing practices and educational segregation, as the composition of students in the schools followed segregated neighborhoods.<ref name=Meinke2011>{{cite journal|last=Meinke|first=Samantha|title=Milliken v Bradley: The Northern Battle for Desegregation|journal=Michigan Bar Journal|date=September 2011|volume=90|issue=9|pages=20\u201322|url=http://www.michbar.org/journal/pdf/pdf4article1911.pdf|accessdate=July 27, 2012}}</ref> The District Court held all levels of government accountable for the segregation in its ruling.

In 1948, the landmark Supreme Court case of [[Shelley v. Kraemer|Shelley v Kraemer]] outlawed restrictive covenants and while racism in housing did not disappear, it allowed affluent black families to begin moving to traditionally white neighborhoods. Proving their persistent prejudice and unwillingness to integrate, many white families with the financial ability moved to the suburbs of Detroit taking their jobs and tax dollars with them. By 1950, much of the city's white population had moved to the suburbs as macrostructural processes such as \"[[white flight]]\" and \"[[suburbanization]]\" led to a complete population shift.\n\n[[File:Brightmoor Farmway.JPG|thumb|A home in [[Brightmoor]] painted with a map of the neighborhood.

Detroit manufacturers such as [[Packard Motor Car Company|Packard]] and [[Hudson Motor Car Company|Hudson]] merged into other companies and eventually disappeared. At its peak population of 1,849,568, in the [[1950 United States Census|1950 Census]], the city was the 5th-largest in the United States, after New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles.\n\nIn this postwar era, the auto industry continued to create opportunities for many African Americans from the South, who continued with their [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to Detroit and other northern and western cities to escape the strict [[Jim Crow]] laws and racial discrimination policies of the South. As before the war, competition had been fierce for employment, housing, and land. Racial discrimination took place in employment, keeping the work force and better jobs predominantly white. These unequal opportunities in employment resulted in unequal housing opportunities for the majority of the black community. Despite changes in demographics, for instance, Detroit's police force, fire department, and other city jobs were held by predominately white residents.\n\nThe surge in Detroit's black population with the Great Migration augmented the strain on housing scarcity. Black people were often turned away from bank loans to obtain housing and interest rates, and rents were unfairly inflated to prevent their moving into white neighborhoods. Such discrimination also took place due to [[redlining]] by banks and federal housing policy, which limited the ability of blacks to improve their housing, and encouraged white people to guard the racial divide that defined their neighborhoods. This marginalized the agency of black Detroiters\u2014another important aspect in the history of postwar Detroit.<ref name=\"The Origins of the Urban Crisis\">{{cite book |last1=Sugrue |first1=Thomas |title=The Origins of the Urban Crisis |year=2005 |publisher=Princeton University Press}}</ref>\n\n[[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#1950|As in other major American cities]] in the postwar era, construction of a federally subsidized, extensive highway and freeway system around Detroit, and pent-up demand for new housing stimulated suburbanization; highways made commuting by car easier. However, this construction had negative implications for many urban residents. Highways were constructed through neighborhoods of poor and minority residents who had less political power to oppose them. (The neighborhoods were mostly low income or considered blighted, made up of older housing, where investment had been lacking due to racial redlining, so the highways were presented as a kind of urban renewal.) They displaced residents with little consideration of the effects of breaking up functioning neighborhoods.<ref name=\"The Origins of the Urban Crisis\"/> \n\nIn 1956, Detroit's last heavily used [[streetcar|electric streetcar line]], which traveled along the length of Woodward Avenue, was removed and replaced with gas-powered buses. It was the last line of what had once been a 534-mile network of electric streetcars.

Industry also moved to the suburbs, seeking large plots of land for single story factories. By the 21st century, the metro Detroit area had developed as one of the most [[Urban sprawl|sprawling]] job markets in the United States; combined with poor public transport, this resulted in many new jobs being beyond the reach of urban low-income workers.<ref>[http://www.freep.com/article/20130418/BUSINESS06/304180118/jobs-sprawl-Detroit-Brookings-Institution \"Metro Detroit job sprawl worst in U.S.; many jobs beyond reach of poor\"], ''Detroit Free Press''.

In 1948, the landmark Supreme Court case of [[Shelley v.

Proving their persistent prejudice and unwillingness to integrate, many white families with the financial ability moved to the suburbs of Detroit taking their jobs and tax dollars with them. By 1950, much of the city's white population had moved to the suburbs as macrostructural processes such as \"[[white flight]]\" and \"[[suburbanization]]\" led to a complete population shift.\n\n[[File:Brightmoor Farmway.JPG|thumb|A home in [[Brightmoor]] painted with a map of the neighborhood.
