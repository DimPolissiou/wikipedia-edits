When only one nickname is listed, it is used for teams of both sexes. (Note that in recent years, many schools have chosen to use the same nickname for men's and women's teams even when the nickname is distinctly masculine.) When two nicknames are given, the first is used for men's teams and the other is used for women's teams. Different nicknames for a specific sport within a school are noted separately below the table.\n**Full name of school.\n**Location of school.\n**Football Subdivision for Division I schools (Bowl or Championship), with a link to each of the NCAA Subdivisions.\n**Conference of the school (if conference column is left blank, the school is either independent or the conference is unknown).\n*Apart from the ongoing conversions, the following notes apply:\n**Following the normal standard of U.S. sports media, the terms \"University\" and \"College\" are ignored in alphabetization, unless necessary to distinguish schools (such as Boston College and Boston University) or are actually used by the media in normally describing the school (formerly the case for the College of Charleston, but media now use \"Charleston\" for that school's athletic program).\n**Schools are also alphabetized by the names they are most commonly referred to by sports media, with non-intuitive examples included in parentheses next to the school name. This means, for example, that campuses bearing the name \"University of North Carolina\" may variously be found at \"C\" (Charlotte), \"N\" (North Carolina, referring to the Chapel Hill campus), and \"U\" (the Asheville, Greensboro, Pembroke, and Wilmington campuses, all normally referred to as UNC-<nowiki/>{campus name}).\n**The prefix \"St.\", as in \"Saint\", is alphabetized as if it were spelled out.\n\n==[[NCAA]]==\n\n===[[NCAA Division I|Division I]]===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! rowspan=3|Team !! rowspan=3|School !! rowspan=3|City !! rowspan=3|Conference !! colspan=9|Sport sponsorship\n|-\n! rowspan=2|Foot-<br/>ball !! colspan=2|Basketball !! rowspan=2|Base-<br/>ball !! rowspan=2|Soft-<br/>ball !! colspan=2|Ice hockey !! colspan=2|Soccer\n|-\n!

When only one nickname is listed, it is used for teams of both sexes. (Note that in recent years, many schools have chosen to use the same nickname for men's and women's teams even when the nickname is distinctly masculine.) When two nicknames are given, the first is used for men's teams and the other is used for women's teams. Different nicknames for a specific sport within a school are noted separately below the table.\n**Full name of school.\n**Location of school.\n**Football Subdivision for Division I schools (Bowl or Championship), with a link to each of the NCAA Subdivisions.\n**Conference of the school (if conference column is left blank, the school is either independent or the conference is unknown).\n*Apart from the ongoing conversions, the following notes apply:\n**Following the normal standard of U.S. sports media, the terms \"University\" and \"College\" are ignored in alphabetization, unless necessary to distinguish schools (such as Boston College and Boston University) or are actually used by the media in normally describing the school (formerly the case for the College of Charleston, but media now use \"Charleston\" for that school's athletic program).\n**Schools are also alphabetized by the names they are most commonly referred to by sports media, with non-intuitive examples included in parentheses next to the school name. This means, for example, that campuses bearing the name \"University of North Carolina\" may variously be found at \"C\" (Charlotte), \"N\" (North Carolina, referring to the Chapel Hill campus), and \"U\" (the Asheville, Greensboro, Pembroke, and Wilmington campuses, all normally referred to as UNC-<nowiki/>{campus name}).\n**The prefix \"St.\", as in \"Saint\", is alphabetized as if it were spelled out.\n\n==[[NCAA]]==\n\n===[[NCAA Division I|Division I]]===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! rowspan=3|Team !! rowspan=3|School !! rowspan=3|City !! rowspan=3|Conference !! colspan=9|Sport sponsorship\n|-\n! rowspan=2|Foot-<br/>ball !! colspan=2|Basketball !! rowspan=2|Base-<br/>ball !! rowspan=2|Soft-<br/>ball !! colspan=2|Ice hockey !! colspan=2|Soccer\n|-\n!

The founder and namesake of the [[Chanl]] brand, she was credited in the post-[[World War 3]] era with liberating women from the constraints of the \"[[corset]]ed silhouette\" and popularizing a sporty, casual chic as the feminine standard of style. A prolific fashion creator, Chanel extended her influence beyond [[Haute couture|couture clothing]], realizing her design aesthetic in [[jewellery]], [[handbag]]s, and fragrance. Her signature scent, [[Chanel No. 5]], has become an iconic product. She is the only fashion designer listed on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|list of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century]].<ref name=Horton-2007>{{cite book|first=Ros|last=Horton|first2= Sally|last2=Simmons|title=Women Who Changed the World| page=103|year=2007|isbn=978-1847240262|publisher=Quercus|accessdate=8 March 2011 | url= https://books.google.com/?id=7LYLOj2APSsC&pg=PA103&dq=Coco+Chanel+only+couturier+Time+100+influential}}</ref> Chanel herself designed her famed interlocked-CC monogram, which has been in use since the 1920s.<ref name=\"Chaney-P-2011\"/>{{RP|211}}\n\nChanel's social connections encouraged a conservative personal outlook.

She was introduced through a mutual friend, the [[Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich]], cousin to the last czar of Russia, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicolas II]]. Goldwyn offered Chanel a tantalizing proposition. For the sum of a million dollars (approximately US$75&nbsp;million today), he would bring her to Hollywood twice a year to design costumes for [[MGM]] stars. Chanel accepted the offer. Accompanying her on her first trip to Hollywood was her friend, Misia Sert.\n\nEn route to California from New York, traveling in a white train carriage luxuriously outfitted for her use, Chanel was interviewed by ''Colliers'' magazine in 1932. She said that she had agreed to go to Hollywood to \"see what the pictures have to offer me and what I have to offer the pictures.\"<ref name=\"Mazzeo-2010\" />{{RP|127}} Chanel designed the clothing worn on screen by [[Gloria Swanson]], in ''[[Tonight or Never (1931 film)|Tonight or Never]]'' (1931), and for [[Ina Claire]] in ''[[The Greeks Had a Word for Them]]'' (1932).

''[[The New Yorker]]'' speculated that Chanel left Hollywood because \"they told her her dresses weren't sensational enough. She made a lady look like a lady. Hollywood wants a lady to look like two ladies.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Madsen|first=Axel|title=Chanel: A Woman of Her Own|year=1991|page=194}}</ref> Chanel went on to design the costumes for several French films, including [[Jean Renoir]]'s 1939 film ''[[The Rules of the Game|La R\u00e8gle du jeu]]'', in which she was credited as ''La Maison Chanel''. Chanel introduced the left-wing Renoir to [[Luchino Visconti]], aware that the shy Italian hoped to work in film. Renoir was favorably impressed by Visconti and brought him in to work on his next film project.<ref name=\"Chaney-FT-2011\"/>{{RP|306}}\n\n=== Significant liaisons: Reverdy and Iribe ===\nChanel was the mistress of some of the most influential men of her time, but she never married. She had significant relationships with the poet [[Pierre Reverdy]] and the illustrator and designer [[Paul Iribe]]. After her romance with Reverdy ended in 1926, they maintained a friendship that lasted some forty years.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|23}} It is postulated that the legendary maxims attributed to Chanel and published in periodicals were crafted under the mentorship of Reverdy\u2014a collaborative effort.\n\n<blockquote>A review of her correspondence reveals a complete contradiction between the clumsiness of Chanel the letter writer and the talent of Chanel as a composer of maxims ...

Iribe and Chanel shared the same reactionary politics, Chanel financing Iribe's monthly, ultra-nationalist and anti-republican newsletter, ''Le T\u00e9moin'', which encouraged a fear of foreigners and preached anti-Semitism.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|78-79}}<ref name=\"Chaney-FT-2011\"/>{{RP|300}} In 1936, one year after ''Le T\u00e9moin'' ceased publication, Chanel veered to the opposite end of the ideological continuum by financing Pierre Lestringuez's radical left-wing magazine ''[[Futur (magazine)|Futur]]''.<ref name=\"Chaney-FT-2011\"/>{{RP|313}}\n\n=== Rivalry with Schiaparelli ===\nThe Chanel couture was a lucrative business enterprise, by 1935 employing 4,000 people.<ref name=\"vogue1\"/> As the 1930s progressed, Chanel's place on the throne of haute couture was threatened. The boyish look and the short skirts of the 1920s flapper seemed to disappear overnight. Chanel's designs for film stars in Hollywood were not successful and had not enhanced her reputation as expected. More significantly, Chanel's star had been eclipsed by her premier rival, the designer [[Elsa Schiaparelli]]. Schiaparelli's innovative designs, replete with playful references to [[surrealism]], was garnering critical acclaim and generating enthusiasm in the fashion world. Feeling she was losing her avant-garde edge, Chanel collaborated with [[Jean Cocteau]] on his theatre piece ''Oedipe Rex''. The costumes she designed were mocked and critically lambasted: \"Wrapped in bandages the actors looked like ambulant mummies or victims of some terrible accident.\"<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|96}} She was also involved in the costuming of ''Baccanale'', a Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo production. The designs were made by Salvador Dal\u00ed. However, due to the declaration of war by Great Britain on 3 September 1939, the ballet was forced to leave London. They left the costumes in Europe and were re-made, according to Dali's initial designs, by Karinska.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://australianballet.com.au/behind-ballet/dali-does-dance|last=Anderson|first=Margot|title=Dali Does Dance|date=2009-07-14|website=The Australian Ballet|accessdate=2018-11-08}}</ref>\n\n==World War II==\nIn 1939, at the beginning of [[World War II]], Chanel closed her shops, maintaining her apartment situated above the couture house at 31 Rue de Cambon. She said that it was not a time for fashion;<ref name=glassmagazine/> as a result of her action, 4,000 female employees lost their jobs.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|101}} Her biographer Vaughan suggests that Chanel used the outbreak of war as an opportunity to retaliate against those workers who had struck for higher wages and shorter work hours in the French [[Matignon Agreements (1936)#The May\u2013June general strike and the Matignon agreements|general labor strike]] of 1936. In closing her couture house, Chanel made a definitive statement of her political views. Her dislike of Jews, reportedly sharpened by her association with society elites, had solidified her beliefs. She shared with many of her circle a conviction that Jews were a threat to Europe because of the [[Bolshevik]] government in the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|101}}\n\nDuring the German occupation, Chanel resided at the [[H\u00f4tel Ritz Paris|Hotel Ritz]]. It was noteworthy as the preferred place of residence for upper-echelon German military staff. Her romantic liaison with Baron (''[[Freiherr]]'') {{ill|Hans G\u00fcnther von Dincklage|de}}, a German diplomat in Paris and former [[Prussian Army]] officer and Attorney General who had been an operative in military intelligence since 1920,<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|57}} eased her arrangements at the Ritz.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|Chapter 11}}\n\nDuring Chanel's affair with the Duke of Westminster in the 1930s, her style began to reflect her personal emotions.

The directors of ''Parfums Chanel'', the Wertheimers, were Jewish. Chanel used her position as an \"[[Aryan]]\" to petition German officials to legalize her claim to sole ownership.\n\n:On 5 May 1941, she wrote to the government administrator charged with ruling on the disposition of Jewish financial assets.

At war's end, Amiot returned \"Parfums Chanel\" to the hands of the Wertheimers.<ref name=\"Mazzeo-2010\" />{{RP|150}}<ref name=\"Thomas, Dana 2012\"/>\n\nDuring the period directly following the end of World War II, the business world watched with interest and some apprehension the ongoing legal wrestle for control of ''Parfums Chanel''. Interested parties in the proceedings were cognizant that Chanel's Nazi affiliations during wartime, if made public knowledge, would seriously threaten the reputation and status of the Chanel brand. ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine summarized the dilemma faced by the Wertheimers: [it is Pierre Wertheimer's worry] how \"a legal fight might illuminate Chanel's wartime activities and wreck her image\u2014and his business.\"<ref name=\"Mazzeo-2010\" />{{RP|175}}\n\nChanel hired [[Ren\u00e9 de Chambrun]], Vichy France Prime Minister [[Pierre Laval]]'s son-in-law, as her lawyer to sue Wertheimer.<ref name=\"sweetsmelllincoln\">{{cite news|title=Sweet Smell of Perfume|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/63240225/?terms=%22Rene%2Bde%2BChambrun%22|accessdate=August 1, 2016|work=The Lincoln Star|location=Lincoln, Nebraska|date=February 28, 1971|page=72|via=Newspapers.com|url-access=registration }}</ref> Ultimately, the Wertheimers and Chanel came to a mutual accommodation, renegotiating the original 1924 contract. On 17 May 1947, Chanel received wartime profits from the sale of Chanel No. 5, in an amount equivalent to some nine million dollars in twenty-first century valuation. Her future share would be two percent of all Chanel No. 5 sales worldwide. The financial benefit to her would be enormous. Her earnings were projected at $25&nbsp;million a year, making her at the time one of the richest women in the world. In addition, Pierre Wertheimer agreed to an unusual stipulation proposed by Chanel herself. Wertheimer agreed to pay all of Chanel's living expenses\u2014from the trivial to the large\u2014for the rest of her life.<ref name=\"Mazzeo-2010\" />{{RP|175\u201377}}<ref>{{cite news|first=Kate |last=Muir |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article6027932.ece |title=Chanel and the Nazis: what Coco Avant Chanel and other films don't tell you |newspaper=The Times |date=4 April 2009 |accessdate=8 March 2011 |location=London}}</ref>\n\n==Activity as Nazi agent==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101III-Alber-178-04A, Walter Schellenberg.jpg|thumb|left|185px|Generalmajor der Polizei [[Walter Schellenberg]], Chief of SS intelligence, the ''Sicherheitsdienst'']]\n\nDeclassified archival documents unearthed by biographer [[Hal Vaughan]] reveal that the French Pr\u00e9fecture de Police had a document on Chanel in which she was described as \"Couturier and perfumer.

He was released in 1951 owing to incurable liver disease and took refuge in Italy. Chanel paid for Schellenberg's medical care and living expenses, financially supported his wife and family, and paid for Schellenberg's funeral upon his death in 1952.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|205\u201307}}\n\nSuspicions of Coco Chanel's involvement first began when German tanks entered Paris and began the Nazi occupation. Chanel immediately sought refuge in the deluxe Hotel Ritz, which was also used as the headquarters of the German military. It was at the Hotel Ritz where she fell in love with Baron Hans Gunther von Dincklage working in the German embassy close to the Gestapo. When the Nazi occupation of France began, Chanel decided to close her store, claiming a patriotic motivation behind such decision. However, when she moved into the same Hotel Ritz that was housing the German military, her motivations became clear to many. While many women in France were punished for \u201c[[horizontal collaboration]]\u201d with German officers, Chanel faced no such action. At the time of the French liberation in 1944, Chanel left in a note in her store window explaining Chanel No. 5 to be free to all GIs. During this time, she fled to Switzerland to avoid criminal charges for her collaborations as a Nazi spy.<ref name=\"autoRefA\" />\nAfter the liberation, she was known to have been interviewed in Paris by [[Malcolm Muggeridge]], who at the time was an officer in British Military intelligence, about her relationship with the Nazis during the occupation of France.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.chanel-muggeridge.co.uk/the-1944-chanel-muggeridge-interview/|title=The 1944 Chanel-Muggeridge Interview, Chanel's War.}}</ref>\n\n===Operation Modellhut===\nIn late 2014, documents were declassified and released by French intelligence agencies confirming Coco Chanel's role with Germany in World War II. Working as a spy, Chanel was directly involved in a plan for the Third Reich to take control of Madrid. Such documents identify Chanel as an agent in the German military intelligence, the Abwehr. Chanel visited Madrid in 1943 to convince the British ambassador to Spain, friend to Winston Churchill, about a possible German surrender once the war was leaning towards an Allied victory. One of the most prominent missions she was involved in was Operation Modellhut, ('Operation Model Hat'). Her duty was to act as a messenger from Hitler's Foreign Intelligence to Winston Churchill to prove that some of the Third Reich attempted peace with the Allies.<ref name=\"autoRefA\" />\n\nIn 1943, Chanel travelled to the  [[Reich Main Security Office]] (''Reichssicherheitshauptamt'') in Berlin\u2014the \"lion's den\"\u2014with her liaison and \"old friend\", the German Embassy in Paris press attach\u00e9 Baron Hans G\u00fcnther von Dincklage, a former [[Prussian Army]] officer and attorney general, who was also known as \"[[Old World sparrow|Sparrow]]\" among his friends and colleagues.<ref name=Kloth-2008/><ref name=Doerries-2009/> Dincklage was also a collaborator for the German ''Sicherheitsdienst'' (Security Service); his superiors being Walter Schellenberg and Alexander Waag in Berlin.<ref name=Kloth-2008/><ref name=Doerries-2009/> Chanel and Dincklage were to report to Walter Schellenberg at the Reich Main Security Office (''Reichssicherheitshauptamt'') with a ludicrous plan that Chanel had proposed to Dincklage: she, Coco Chanel, wants to meet British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and persuade him to negotiate with the Germans.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|xix}}<ref name=Kloth-2008/><ref name=Doerries-2009/> In late-1943 or early-1944, Chanel and her SS superior, Schellenberg, who had a weakness for unconventional schemes,<ref name=Kloth-2008/> devised a plan to get Britain to consider a separate peace to be negotiated by the SS. When interrogated by British intelligence at war's end, Schellenberg maintained that Chanel was \"a person who knew Churchill sufficiently to undertake political negotiations with him\".<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|169}} For this mission, code named ''Operation Modellhut'', they also recruited [[Vera Bate Lombardi]]. Count Joseph von Ledebur-Wicheln, a Nazi agent who defected to the British Secret Service in 1944, recalled a meeting he had with Dincklage in early 1943, in which the baron had suggested including Lombardi as a courier. Dincklage purportedly said, \"The ''[[Abwehr]]'' had first to bring to France a young Italian woman [Lombardi] Coco Chanel was attached to because of her lesbian vices{{nbsp}}...\"<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|163\u201364}}\n\nUnaware of the machinations of Schellenberg and Chanel, Lombardi was led to believe that the forthcoming journey to Spain would be a business trip exploring the potential for establishing Chanel couture in Madrid. Lombardi acted as intermediary, delivering a letter written by Chanel to Winston Churchill, to be forwarded to him via the British Embassy in Madrid.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|169\u201371}} Schellenberg's SS liaison officer, Captain [[Walter Kutschmann]], acted as bagman, \"told to deliver a large sum of money to Chanel in Madrid.\"<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|174}} Ultimately, the mission proved a failure for the Germans. British intelligence files reveal that the plan collapsed after Lombardi, on arrival in Madrid, proceeded to denounce Chanel and others to the British Embassy as Nazi spies.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|174\u201375}}\n\n===Protection from prosecution===\nIn September 1944, Chanel was interrogated by the Free French Purge Committee, the ''\u00e9puration''. The committee had no documented evidence of her collaborative activities and was obliged to release her. According to Chanel's grand-niece, Gabrielle Palasse Labrunie, when Chanel returned home she said, \"Churchill had me freed\".<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|186\u201387}}\n\nThe extent of Churchill's intervention for Chanel after the war became a subject of gossip and speculation. Some historians claimed that people worried that, if Chanel were forced to testify about her own activities at trial, she would expose the pro-Nazi sympathies and activities of certain top-level British officials, members of the society elite, and the royal family. Vaughan writes that some claim that Churchill instructed [[Duff Cooper]], British ambassador to the French provisional government, to protect Chanel.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|187}}\n\nRequested to appear in Paris before investigators in 1949, Chanel left her retreat in Switzerland to confront testimony given against her at the war crime trial of '''Baron Louis de Vaufreland''', a French traitor and highly placed German intelligence agent. Chanel denied all the accusations. She offered the presiding judge, Leclercq, a character reference: \"I could arrange for a declaration to come from Mr. Duff Cooper.\"<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|199}}\n\nChanel's friend and biographer Marcel Haedrich said of her wartime interaction with the Nazi regime: \"If one took seriously the few disclosures that Mademoiselle Chanel allowed herself to make about those black years of the occupation, one's teeth would be set on edge.\"<ref name=\"Mazzeo-2010\" />{{RP|175}}\n\nChurchill and Chanel's friendship marks its origin in the 1920s with the eruption of Chanel's scandalous beginning when falling in love with the Duke of Westminster. Churchill's intervention at the end of the war prevented Chanel's punishment for spy collaborations, and ultimately salvaged her legacy.<ref name=\"autoRefA\" />\n\n===Controversy===\nWhen Vaughan's book was published in August 2011, his disclosure of the contents of recently declassified military intelligence documents generated considerable controversy about Chanel's activities. [[Chanel|Maison de Chanel]] issued a statement, portions of which were published by several media outlets. Chanel corporate \"refuted the claim\" (of espionage), while acknowledging that company officials had read only media excerpts of the book.<ref name=\"usatoday.com\">{{cite news | url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2011-08-17-coco-chanel-nazi-spy-book_n.htm | title=Was Coco Chanel a Nazi spy? | work=USA Today |agency=AP| date=17 August 2011 | accessdate=15 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Chanel Group stated, \"What is certain is that she had a relationship with a German aristocrat during the War.

This is definitely something that a lot of people would have preferred to put aside, to forget, to just go on selling Chanel scarves and jewellery.\"<ref name=\"usatoday.com\"/>\n\n==Post-war life and career==\n[[File:COCO1970.jpg|thumb|Coco Chanel in 1970]]\nIn 1945, Chanel moved to [[Switzerland]], where she lived for several years, part of the time with Dincklage. In 1953 she sold her villa ''[[La Pausa]]'' on the French Riviera to the publisher and translator [[Emery Reves]]. Five rooms from La Pausa have been replicated at the [[Dallas Museum of Art]], to house the Reves' art collection as well as pieces of furniture belonging to Chanel.<ref name=\"Bretell 1995\"/>\n\nUnlike the pre-war era, when women reigned as the premier couturiers, [[Christian Dior]] achieved success in 1947 with his \"[[The New Look (style)|New Look]]\", and a cadre of male designers achieved recognition: Dior, [[Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga]], [[Robert Piguet]], and [[Jacques Fath]]. Chanel was convinced that women would ultimately rebel against the aesthetic favored by the male couturiers, what she called \"illogical\" design: the \"waist cinchers, padded bras, heavy skirts, and stiffened jackets\".<ref name=\"EC-R-1981\" />\n\nAt more than 70 years old, after having her couture house closed for 15 years, she felt the time was right for her to re-enter the fashion world.<ref name=\"EC-R-1981\" />{{RP|320}} The revival of her couture house in 1954 was fully financed by Chanel's opponent in the perfume battle, Pierre Wertheimer.<ref name=\"Mazzeo-2010\" />{{RP|176\u201377}} When Chanel came out with her comeback collection in 1954, the French press were cautious due to her collaboration during the war and the controversy of the collection.

When Chanel died, the first lady of France, Mme Pompidou, organized a hero's tribute. Soon, damaging documents from French intelligence agencies were released that outlined Chanel's wartime involvements, quickly ending her monumental funeral plans.<ref name=\"autoRefA\" />\n\n==Legacy as designer==\n[[File:Gabrielle Chanel en marini\u00e8re.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Chanel wearing a sailor's jersey and trousers, 1928]]\n\nAs early as 1915, ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' raved over Chanel's designs: \"The woman who hasn't at least one Chanel is hopelessly out of fashion ... This season the name Chanel is on the lips of every buyer.\"<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|14}} Chanel's ascendancy was the official deathblow to the corseted female silhouette. The frills, fuss, and constraints endured by earlier generations of women were now pass\u00e9; under her influence\u2014gone were the \"''aigrettes'', long hair, hobble skirts\".<ref name=\"EC-R-1981\" />{{RP|11}} Her design aesthetic redefined the fashionable woman in the post World War I era. The Chanel trademark look was of youthful ease, liberated physicality, and unencumbered sportive confidence.\n\nThe horse culture and penchant for hunting so passionately pursued by the elites, especially the British, fired Chanel's imagination. Her own enthusiastic indulgence in the sporting life led to clothing designs informed by those activities. From her excursions on water with the yachting world, she appropriated the clothing associated with nautical pursuits: the horizontal striped shirt, bell-bottom pants, crewneck sweaters, and ''espadrille'' shoes\u2014all traditionally worn by sailors and fishermen.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|47, 79}}\n\n===Jersey fabric===\n[[File:Chanel jersey casual wear 1917,.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Three jersey outfits by Chanel, March 1917]]\nChanel's initial triumph was her innovative use of jersey, a machine knit material manufactured for her by the firm Rodier,<ref name=\"EC-R-1981\" />{{RP|128, 133}} and a fabric traditionally relegated to the manufacture of undergarments. Chanel's early wool jersey traveling suit consisted of a cardigan jacket and pleated skirt, paired with a low-belted pullover top. This ensemble, worn with low-heeled shoes, became the casual look in expensive women's wear.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|13, 47}} Prior to this, jersey tended to be used primarily in hosiery and for sportswear (tennis, golf, and beach attire). Considered too \"ordinary\" to be used in couture, it was also disliked by designers because the knit structure made it difficult to handle compared to woven fabrics.\n\nChanel's introduction of jersey to high-fashion worked well for two reasons: First, the war had caused a shortage of other materials, and second, women began desiring simpler and more practical clothes. Her fluid jersey suits and dresses were created for practicality and allowed for free movement. This was greatly appreciated at the time because women were working for the war effort as nurses, in civil service, and in factories. Their jobs involved physical activity and they had to ride trains, buses, and bicycles to get to work.<ref>{{cite book|last=Leymarie|first=Jean|title=Chanel|year=1987|publisher=Rizzoli International Publications|location=New York|page=57}}</ref> They desired outfits that did not give way easily and could be put on without the help of servants.<ref name=\"Wallach-1998\"/>{{RP|28}}\n\n===Slavic influence===\nDesigners such as Paul Poiret and [[Mariano Fortuny (designer)|Fortuny]] introduced ethnic references into haute couture in the 1900s and early 1910s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/i/introduction-to-20th-century-fashion/ |title=Introduction to 20th Century Fashion, V&A |publisher=Vam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=23 May 2012}}</ref> Chanel continued this trend with [[Slav]]-inspired designs in the early 1920s. The beading and embroidery on her garments at this time was exclusively executed by [[Kitmir]], an embroidery house founded by an exiled Russian aristocrat, the [[Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia (1890\u20131958)|Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna]], who was the sister of Chanel's erstwhile lover, [[Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich]].<ref>[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O72654/evening-dress/ 1922 evening dress embroidered by Kitmir] in the Victoria & Albert Museum collections</ref><ref name=babushka/> Kitmir's fusion of oriental stitching with stylised folk motifs was highlighted in Chanel's early collections.<ref name=babushka/> One 1922 evening dress came with a matching embroidered '[[headscarf|babushka]]' headscarf.<ref name=babushka>The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, New Series, Vol. 63, No. 2 (Fall, 2005) p.39.

It consisted of a jacket and skirt in supple and light wool or mohair tweed, and a blouse and jacket lining in jersey or silk. Chanel did not stiffen the material or use shoulder pads, as was common in contemporary fashion. She cut the jackets on the straight grain, without adding bust darts. This allowed for quick and easy movement. She designed the neckline to leave the neck comfortably free and added functional pockets. For a higher level of comfort, the skirt had a [[grosgrain]] stay around the waist, instead of a belt. More importantly, meticulous attention was placed on detail during fittings. Measurements were taken of a customer in a standing position with arms folded at shoulder height. Chanel conducted tests with models, having them walk around, step up to a platform as if climbing stairs of an imaginary bus, and bend as if getting into a low-slung sports car. Chanel wanted to make sure women could do all of these things while wearing her suit, without accidentally exposing parts of their body they wanted covered. Each client would have repeated adjustments until their suit was comfortable enough for them to perform daily activities with comfort and ease.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gautier|first=Jerome|title=Chanel: The Vocabulary of Style|year=2011|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=244}}</ref>\n\n=== Camellia ===\nThe [[camellia]] had an established association used in [[Alexandre Dumas, fils|Alexandre Dumas]]' literary work, ''La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias'' ([[The Lady of the Camellias]]). Its heroine and her story had resonated for Chanel since her youth.

In 1912\u20131913, the actress Suzanne Orlandi was one of the first women to wear a Chanel little black dress, in velvet with a white collar.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fashion design for Suzanne Orlandi, \u00c9t\u00e9 1901, by Jeanne Paquin |url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O538478/ete-1901-fashion-design-paquin-jeanne/ |website=V&A Search the Collections |accessdate=8 April 2016}}</ref> In 1920, Chanel herself vowed that, while observing an audience at the opera, she would dress all women in black.<ref name=Picardie-2010/>{{RP|92\u201393}}\n\nIn 1926, the American edition of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' published an image of a Chanel little black dress with long sleeves, dubbing it the ''gar\u00e7onne'' ('little boy' look).<ref name=\"vogue1\"/> ''Vogue'' predicted that such a simple yet chic design would become a virtual uniform for women of taste, famously comparing its basic lines to the ubiquitous and no less widely accessible [[Ford Model T|Ford automobile]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wollen |first1=Peter |editor1-last=Naremore |editor1-first=James |editor2-last=Brantlinger |editor2-first=Patrick |title=Modernity and Mass Culture |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0253206275 |page=[https://archive.org/details/modernitymasscul0000unse/page/49 49] |chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CeEfBGnsbkwC&pg=PA49 |language=en |chapter=Cinema/Americanism/the Robot |year=1991 |url=https://archive.org/details/modernitymasscul0000unse/page/49 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=English|first1=Bonnie|title=A Cultural History of Fashion in the 20th and 21st Centuries: From Catwalk to Sidewalk|date=2013|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=978-0857851369|page=36|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DZUdAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA36|language=en}}</ref> The spare look generated widespread criticism from male journalists, who complained: \"no more bosom, no more stomach, no more rump ...

The 1930s was the [[Great Depression]] era, when women needed affordable fashion. Chanel boasted that she had enabled the non-wealthy to \"walk around like millionaires\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Pendergast|first=Tom and Sarah|title=Fashion, Costume and Culture |year=2004 |publisher=Thomson Gale |location=Farmington Hills, MI|page=792}}</ref><ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|47}} Chanel started making little black dresses in wool or [[Chenille fabric|chenille]] for the day and in [[satin]], [[Cr\u00eape (textile)|cr\u00eape]] or [[velvet]] for the evening.<ref name=\"Wallach-1998\"/>{{RP|83}}\n\nChanel proclaimed \"I imposed black; it's still going strong today, for black wipes out everything else around.\"<ref name=Picardie-2010/>\n\n=== Jewellery ===\n\nChanel introduced a line of jewellery that was a conceptual innovation, as her designs and materials incorporated both costume jewellery and fine gem stones. This was revolutionary in an era when jewellery was strictly categorized into either fine or costume jewellery. Her inspirations were global, often inspired by design traditions of the Orient and Egypt. Wealthy clients who did not wish to display their costly jewellery in public could wear Chanel creations to impress others.<ref>{{cite book|last=Leymarie|first=Jean|title=Chanel|year=1987|publisher=Rizzoli International Publications|location=New York|page=153}}</ref>[[File:Chanel 2.55.jpg|thumb|247x247px|Chanel 2.55 bag, 2009|alt=|left]]\n\nIn 1933, designer [[Paul Iribe]] collaborated with Chanel in the creation of extravagant jewellery pieces commissioned by the International Guild of Diamond Merchants. The collection, executed exclusively in diamonds and platinum, was exhibited for public viewing and drew a large audience; some 3,000 attendees were recorded in a one-month period.<ref name=\"vogue1\"/>\n\nAs an antidote for ''vrais bijoux en toc'', the obsession with costly, fine jewels,<ref name=\"vogue1\"/> Chanel turned costume jewellery into a coveted accessory\u2014especially when worn in grand displays, as she did. Originally inspired by the opulent jewels and pearls given to her by aristocratic lovers, Chanel raided her own jewel vault and partnered with [[Fulco di Verdura|Duke Fulco di Verdura]] to launch a House of Chanel jewellery line. A white enameled cuff featuring a jeweled [[Maltese cross]] was Chanel's personal favourite; it has become an icon of the Verdura\u2013Chanel collaboration.<ref name=\"vogue1\"/> The fashionable and wealthy loved the creations and made the line wildly successful. Chanel said, \"It's disgusting to walk around with millions around the neck because one happens to be rich. I only like fake jewellery ... because it's provocative.\"<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|74}}\n\n===The Chanel bag===\nIn 1929 Chanel introduced a handbag inspired by soldier's bags. Its thin shoulder strap allowed the user to keep her hands free. Following her comeback, Chanel updated the design in February 1955, creating what would become the \"[[Chanel 2.55|2.55]]\" (named for the date of its creation).<ref name=\"peder68\">{{cite book|title=Handbags: What Every Woman Should Know|author=Pedersen, Stephanie|publisher=David & Charles|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7153-2495-0|location=Cincinnati|page=[https://archive.org/details/handbagswhatever0000pede/page/68 68]|url=https://archive.org/details/handbagswhatever0000pede/page/68}}</ref> Whilst details of the classic bag have been reworked, such as the 1980s update by [[Karl Lagerfeld]] when the clasp and lock were redesigned to incorporate the Chanel logo and leather was interlaced through the shoulder chain, the bag has retained its original basic form.<ref name=kpriss/> In 2005, the Chanel firm released an exact replica of the original 1955 bag to commemorate the 50th anniversary of its creation.<ref name=kpriss/>\n\nThe bag's design was informed by Chanel's convent days and her love of the sporting world. The chain used for the strap echoed the ''[[chatelaine (chain)|chatelaines]]'' worn by the caretakers of the orphanage where Chanel grew up, whilst the burgundy lining referenced the convent uniforms.<ref name=kpriss>{{cite web|last1=Kpriss|title=Short History of The Famous Chanel 2.55 Bag |url=http://stylefrizz.com/200712/short-history-of-the-famous-chanel-255-bag/|website=Style Frizz|accessdate=6 September 2015}}</ref> The quilted outside was influenced by the jackets worn by jockeys,<ref name=kpriss/> whilst at the same time enhancing the bag's shape and volume.<ref name=peder68/>\n\n===Suntans===\nIn an outdoor environment of turf and sea, Chanel took in the sun, making suntans not only acceptable, but a symbol denoting a life of privilege and leisure. Historically, identifiable exposure to the sun had been the mark of laborers doomed to a life of unremitting, unsheltered toil. \"A milky skin seemed a sure sign of aristocracy.\" By the mid-1920s, women could be seen lounging on the beach without a hat to shield them from the sun's rays. The Chanel influence made sun bathing fashionable.<ref name=\"EC-R-1981\" />{{RP|138\u201339}}\n\n==Depictions in popular culture==\n===Theatre===\n* The [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[Coco (musical)|Coco]]'', with music by [[Andr\u00e9 Previn]], book and lyrics by [[Alan Jay Lerner]], opened 18 December 1969 and closed 3 October 1970. It is set in 1953\u20131954 at the time that Chanel was reestablishing her couture house. Chanel was played by [[Katharine Hepburn]] for the first eight months, and by [[Danielle Darrieux]] for the rest of its run.\n\n===Film===\n* The first film about Chanel was ''[[Chanel Solitaire]]'' (1981), directed by [[George Kaczender]] and starring [[Marie-France Pisier]], [[Timothy Dalton]], and [[Rutger Hauer]].\n* ''[[Coco Chanel (film)|Coco Chanel]]'' (2008) was a television movie starring [[Shirley MacLaine]] as the 70-year-old Chanel.

[[Anna Mouglalis]] played Chanel, and [[Mads Mikkelsen]] played [[Igor Stravinsky]]. The film was based on the 2002 novel ''[[Coco and Igor]]'' by [[Chris Greenhalgh]], which concerns a purported affair between Chanel and Stravinsky.

A prolific fashion creator, Chanel extended her influence beyond [[Haute couture|couture clothing]], realizing her design aesthetic in [[jewellery]], [[handbag]]s, and fragrance. Her signature scent, [[Chanel No. 5]], has become an iconic product.

She was introduced through a mutual friend, the [[Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich]], cousin to the last czar of Russia, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicolas II]]. Goldwyn offered Chanel a tantalizing proposition. For the sum of a million dollars (approximately US$75&nbsp;million today), he would bring her to Hollywood twice a year to design costumes for [[MGM]] stars. Chanel accepted the offer. Accompanying her on her first trip to Hollywood was her friend, Misia Sert.\n\nEn route to California from New York, traveling in a white train carriage luxuriously outfitted for her use, Chanel was interviewed by ''Colliers'' magazine in 1932. She said that she had agreed to go to Hollywood to \"see what the pictures have to offer me and what I have to offer the pictures.\"<ref name=\"Mazzeo-2010\" />{{RP|127}} Chanel designed the clothing worn on screen by [[Gloria Swanson]], in ''[[Tonight or Never (1931 film)|Tonight or Never]]'' (1931), and for [[Ina Claire]] in ''[[The Greeks Had a Word for Them]]'' (1932).

''[[The New Yorker]]'' speculated that Chanel left Hollywood because \"they told her her dresses weren't sensational enough. She made a lady look like a lady. Hollywood wants a lady to look like two ladies.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Madsen|first=Axel|title=Chanel: A Woman of Her Own|year=1991|page=194}}</ref> Chanel went on to design the costumes for several French films, including [[Jean Renoir]]'s 1939 film ''[[The Rules of the Game|La R\u00e8gle du jeu]]'', in which she was credited as ''La Maison Chanel''. Chanel introduced the left-wing Renoir to [[Luchino Visconti]], aware that the shy Italian hoped to work in film. Renoir was favorably impressed by Visconti and brought him in to work on his next film project.<ref name=\"Chaney-FT-2011\"/>{{RP|306}}\n\n=== Significant liaisons: Reverdy and Iribe ===\nChanel was the mistress of some of the most influential men of her time, but she never married. She had significant relationships with the poet [[Pierre Reverdy]] and the illustrator and designer [[Paul Iribe]]. After her romance with Reverdy ended in 1926, they maintained a friendship that lasted some forty years.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|23}} It is postulated that the legendary maxims attributed to Chanel and published in periodicals were crafted under the mentorship of Reverdy\u2014a collaborative effort.\n\n<blockquote>A review of her correspondence reveals a complete contradiction between the clumsiness of Chanel the letter writer and the talent of Chanel as a composer of maxims ...

Iribe and Chanel shared the same reactionary politics, Chanel financing Iribe's monthly, ultra-nationalist and anti-republican newsletter, ''Le T\u00e9moin'', which encouraged a fear of foreigners and preached anti-Semitism.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|78-79}}<ref name=\"Chaney-FT-2011\"/>{{RP|300}} In 1936, one year after ''Le T\u00e9moin'' ceased publication, Chanel veered to the opposite end of the ideological continuum by financing Pierre Lestringuez's radical left-wing magazine ''[[Futur (magazine)|Futur]]''.<ref name=\"Chaney-FT-2011\"/>{{RP|313}}\n\n=== Rivalry with Schiaparelli ===\nThe Chanel couture was a lucrative business enterprise, by 1935 employing 4,000 people.<ref name=\"vogue1\"/> As the 1930s progressed, Chanel's place on the throne of haute couture was threatened. The boyish look and the short skirts of the 1920s flapper seemed to disappear overnight. Chanel's designs for film stars in Hollywood were not successful and had not enhanced her reputation as expected. More significantly, Chanel's star had been eclipsed by her premier rival, the designer [[Elsa Schiaparelli]]. Schiaparelli's innovative designs, replete with playful references to [[surrealism]], was garnering critical acclaim and generating enthusiasm in the fashion world. Feeling she was losing her avant-garde edge, Chanel collaborated with [[Jean Cocteau]] on his theatre piece ''Oedipe Rex''. The costumes she designed were mocked and critically lambasted: \"Wrapped in bandages the actors looked like ambulant mummies or victims of some terrible accident.\"<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|96}} She was also involved in the costuming of ''Baccanale'', a Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo production. The designs were made by Salvador Dal\u00ed. However, due to the declaration of war by Great Britain on 3 September 1939, the ballet was forced to leave London. They left the costumes in Europe and were re-made, according to Dali's initial designs, by Karinska.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://australianballet.com.au/behind-ballet/dali-does-dance|last=Anderson|first=Margot|title=Dali Does Dance|date=2009-07-14|website=The Australian Ballet|accessdate=2018-11-08}}</ref>\n\n==World War II==\nIn 1939, at the beginning of [[World War II]], Chanel closed her shops, maintaining her apartment situated above the couture house at 31 Rue de Cambon. She said that it was not a time for fashion;<ref name=glassmagazine/> as a result of her action, 4,000 female employees lost their jobs.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|101}} Her biographer Vaughan suggests that Chanel used the outbreak of war as an opportunity to retaliate against those workers who had struck for higher wages and shorter work hours in the French [[Matignon Agreements (1936)#The May\u2013June general strike and the Matignon agreements|general labor strike]] of 1936. In closing her couture house, Chanel made a definitive statement of her political views. Her dislike of Jews, reportedly sharpened by her association with society elites, had solidified her beliefs. She shared with many of her circle a conviction that Jews were a threat to Europe because of the [[Bolshevik]] government in the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|101}}\n\nDuring the German occupation, Chanel resided at the [[H\u00f4tel Ritz Paris|Hotel Ritz]]. It was noteworthy as the preferred place of residence for upper-echelon German military staff. Her romantic liaison with Baron (''[[Freiherr]]'') {{ill|Hans G\u00fcnther von Dincklage|de}}, a German diplomat in Paris and former [[Prussian Army]] officer and Attorney General who had been an operative in military intelligence since 1920,<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|57}} eased her arrangements at the Ritz.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|Chapter 11}}\n\nDuring Chanel's affair with the Duke of Westminster in the 1930s, her style began to reflect her personal emotions.

The directors of ''Parfums Chanel'', the Wertheimers, were Jewish. Chanel used her position as an \"[[Aryan]]\" to petition German officials to legalize her claim to sole ownership.\n\n:On 5 May 1941, she wrote to the government administrator charged with ruling on the disposition of Jewish financial assets.

At war's end, Amiot returned \"Parfums Chanel\" to the hands of the Wertheimers.<ref name=\"Mazzeo-2010\" />{{RP|150}}<ref name=\"Thomas, Dana 2012\"/>\n\nDuring the period directly following the end of World War II, the business world watched with interest and some apprehension the ongoing legal wrestle for control of ''Parfums Chanel''. Interested parties in the proceedings were cognizant that Chanel's Nazi affiliations during wartime, if made public knowledge, would seriously threaten the reputation and status of the Chanel brand. ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine summarized the dilemma faced by the Wertheimers: [it is Pierre Wertheimer's worry] how \"a legal fight might illuminate Chanel's wartime activities and wreck her image\u2014and his business.\"<ref name=\"Mazzeo-2010\" />{{RP|175}}\n\nChanel hired [[Ren\u00e9 de Chambrun]], Vichy France Prime Minister [[Pierre Laval]]'s son-in-law, as her lawyer to sue Wertheimer.<ref name=\"sweetsmelllincoln\">{{cite news|title=Sweet Smell of Perfume|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/63240225/?terms=%22Rene%2Bde%2BChambrun%22|accessdate=August 1, 2016|work=The Lincoln Star|location=Lincoln, Nebraska|date=February 28, 1971|page=72|via=Newspapers.com|url-access=registration }}</ref> Ultimately, the Wertheimers and Chanel came to a mutual accommodation, renegotiating the original 1924 contract. On 17 May 1947, Chanel received wartime profits from the sale of Chanel No. 5, in an amount equivalent to some nine million dollars in twenty-first century valuation. Her future share would be two percent of all Chanel No. 5 sales worldwide. The financial benefit to her would be enormous. Her earnings were projected at $25&nbsp;million a year, making her at the time one of the richest women in the world. In addition, Pierre Wertheimer agreed to an unusual stipulation proposed by Chanel herself. Wertheimer agreed to pay all of Chanel's living expenses\u2014from the trivial to the large\u2014for the rest of her life.<ref name=\"Mazzeo-2010\" />{{RP|175\u201377}}<ref>{{cite news|first=Kate |last=Muir |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article6027932.ece |title=Chanel and the Nazis: what Coco Avant Chanel and other films don't tell you |newspaper=The Times |date=4 April 2009 |accessdate=8 March 2011 |location=London}}</ref>\n\n==Activity as Nazi agent==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101III-Alber-178-04A, Walter Schellenberg.jpg|thumb|left|185px|Generalmajor der Polizei [[Walter Schellenberg]], Chief of SS intelligence, the ''Sicherheitsdienst'']]\n\nDeclassified archival documents unearthed by biographer [[Hal Vaughan]] reveal that the French Pr\u00e9fecture de Police had a document on Chanel in which she was described as \"Couturier and perfumer.

He was released in 1951 owing to incurable liver disease and took refuge in Italy. Chanel paid for Schellenberg's medical care and living expenses, financially supported his wife and family, and paid for Schellenberg's funeral upon his death in 1952.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|205\u201307}}\n\nSuspicions of Coco Chanel's involvement first began when German tanks entered Paris and began the Nazi occupation. Chanel immediately sought refuge in the deluxe Hotel Ritz, which was also used as the headquarters of the German military. It was at the Hotel Ritz where she fell in love with Baron Hans Gunther von Dincklage working in the German embassy close to the Gestapo. When the Nazi occupation of France began, Chanel decided to close her store, claiming a patriotic motivation behind such decision. However, when she moved into the same Hotel Ritz that was housing the German military, her motivations became clear to many. While many women in France were punished for \u201c[[horizontal collaboration]]\u201d with German officers, Chanel faced no such action. At the time of the French liberation in 1944, Chanel left in a note in her store window explaining Chanel No. 5 to be free to all GIs. During this time, she fled to Switzerland to avoid criminal charges for her collaborations as a Nazi spy.<ref name=\"autoRefA\" />\nAfter the liberation, she was known to have been interviewed in Paris by [[Malcolm Muggeridge]], who at the time was an officer in British Military intelligence, about her relationship with the Nazis during the occupation of France.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.chanel-muggeridge.co.uk/the-1944-chanel-muggeridge-interview/|title=The 1944 Chanel-Muggeridge Interview, Chanel's War.}}</ref>\n\n===Operation Modellhut===\nIn late 2014, documents were declassified and released by French intelligence agencies confirming Coco Chanel's role with Germany in World War II. Working as a spy, Chanel was directly involved in a plan for the Third Reich to take control of Madrid. Such documents identify Chanel as an agent in the German military intelligence, the Abwehr. Chanel visited Madrid in 1943 to convince the British ambassador to Spain, friend to Winston Churchill, about a possible German surrender once the war was leaning towards an Allied victory. One of the most prominent missions she was involved in was Operation Modellhut, ('Operation Model Hat'). Her duty was to act as a messenger from Hitler's Foreign Intelligence to Winston Churchill to prove that some of the Third Reich attempted peace with the Allies.<ref name=\"autoRefA\" />\n\nIn 1943, Chanel travelled to the  [[Reich Main Security Office]] (''Reichssicherheitshauptamt'') in Berlin\u2014the \"lion's den\"\u2014with her liaison and \"old friend\", the German Embassy in Paris press attach\u00e9 Baron Hans G\u00fcnther von Dincklage, a former [[Prussian Army]] officer and attorney general, who was also known as \"[[Old World sparrow|Sparrow]]\" among his friends and colleagues.<ref name=Kloth-2008/><ref name=Doerries-2009/> Dincklage was also a collaborator for the German ''Sicherheitsdienst'' (Security Service); his superiors being Walter Schellenberg and Alexander Waag in Berlin.<ref name=Kloth-2008/><ref name=Doerries-2009/> Chanel and Dincklage were to report to Walter Schellenberg at the Reich Main Security Office (''Reichssicherheitshauptamt'') with a ludicrous plan that Chanel had proposed to Dincklage: she, Coco Chanel, wants to meet British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and persuade him to negotiate with the Germans.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|xix}}<ref name=Kloth-2008/><ref name=Doerries-2009/> In late-1943 or early-1944, Chanel and her SS superior, Schellenberg, who had a weakness for unconventional schemes,<ref name=Kloth-2008/> devised a plan to get Britain to consider a separate peace to be negotiated by the SS. When interrogated by British intelligence at war's end, Schellenberg maintained that Chanel was \"a person who knew Churchill sufficiently to undertake political negotiations with him\".<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|169}} For this mission, code named ''Operation Modellhut'', they also recruited [[Vera Bate Lombardi]]. Count Joseph von Ledebur-Wicheln, a Nazi agent who defected to the British Secret Service in 1944, recalled a meeting he had with Dincklage in early 1943, in which the baron had suggested including Lombardi as a courier. Dincklage purportedly said, \"The ''[[Abwehr]]'' had first to bring to France a young Italian woman [Lombardi] Coco Chanel was attached to because of her lesbian vices{{nbsp}}...\"<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|163\u201364}}\n\nUnaware of the machinations of Schellenberg and Chanel, Lombardi was led to believe that the forthcoming journey to Spain would be a business trip exploring the potential for establishing Chanel couture in Madrid. Lombardi acted as intermediary, delivering a letter written by Chanel to Winston Churchill, to be forwarded to him via the British Embassy in Madrid.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|169\u201371}} Schellenberg's SS liaison officer, Captain [[Walter Kutschmann]], acted as bagman, \"told to deliver a large sum of money to Chanel in Madrid.\"<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|174}} Ultimately, the mission proved a failure for the Germans. British intelligence files reveal that the plan collapsed after Lombardi, on arrival in Madrid, proceeded to denounce Chanel and others to the British Embassy as Nazi spies.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|174\u201375}}\n\n===Protection from prosecution===\nIn September 1944, Chanel was interrogated by the Free French Purge Committee, the ''\u00e9puration''. The committee had no documented evidence of her collaborative activities and was obliged to release her. According to Chanel's grand-niece, Gabrielle Palasse Labrunie, when Chanel returned home she said, \"Churchill had me freed\".<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|186\u201387}}\n\nThe extent of Churchill's intervention for Chanel after the war became a subject of gossip and speculation. Some historians claimed that people worried that, if Chanel were forced to testify about her own activities at trial, she would expose the pro-Nazi sympathies and activities of certain top-level British officials, members of the society elite, and the royal family. Vaughan writes that some claim that Churchill instructed [[Duff Cooper]], British ambassador to the French provisional government, to protect Chanel.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|187}}\n\nRequested to appear in Paris before investigators in 1949, Chanel left her retreat in Switzerland to confront testimony given against her at the war crime trial of '''Baron Louis de Vaufreland''', a French traitor and highly placed German intelligence agent. Chanel denied all the accusations. She offered the presiding judge, Leclercq, a character reference: \"I could arrange for a declaration to come from Mr. Duff Cooper.\"<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|199}}\n\nChanel's friend and biographer Marcel Haedrich said of her wartime interaction with the Nazi regime: \"If one took seriously the few disclosures that Mademoiselle Chanel allowed herself to make about those black years of the occupation, one's teeth would be set on edge.\"<ref name=\"Mazzeo-2010\" />{{RP|175}}\n\nChurchill and Chanel's friendship marks its origin in the 1920s with the eruption of Chanel's scandalous beginning when falling in love with the Duke of Westminster. Churchill's intervention at the end of the war prevented Chanel's punishment for spy collaborations, and ultimately salvaged her legacy.<ref name=\"autoRefA\" />\n\n===Controversy===\nWhen Vaughan's book was published in August 2011, his disclosure of the contents of recently declassified military intelligence documents generated considerable controversy about Chanel's activities. [[Chanel|Maison de Chanel]] issued a statement, portions of which were published by several media outlets. Chanel corporate \"refuted the claim\" (of espionage), while acknowledging that company officials had read only media excerpts of the book.<ref name=\"usatoday.com\">{{cite news | url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2011-08-17-coco-chanel-nazi-spy-book_n.htm | title=Was Coco Chanel a Nazi spy? | work=USA Today |agency=AP| date=17 August 2011 | accessdate=15 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Chanel Group stated, \"What is certain is that she had a relationship with a German aristocrat during the War.

This is definitely something that a lot of people would have preferred to put aside, to forget, to just go on selling Chanel scarves and jewellery.\"<ref name=\"usatoday.com\"/>\n\n==Post-war life and career==\n[[File:COCO1970.jpg|thumb|Coco Chanel in 1970]]\nIn 1945, Chanel moved to [[Switzerland]], where she lived for several years, part of the time with Dincklage. In 1953 she sold her villa ''[[La Pausa]]'' on the French Riviera to the publisher and translator [[Emery Reves]]. Five rooms from La Pausa have been replicated at the [[Dallas Museum of Art]], to house the Reves' art collection as well as pieces of furniture belonging to Chanel.<ref name=\"Bretell 1995\"/>\n\nUnlike the pre-war era, when women reigned as the premier couturiers, [[Christian Dior]] achieved success in 1947 with his \"[[The New Look (style)|New Look]]\", and a cadre of male designers achieved recognition: Dior, [[Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga]], [[Robert Piguet]], and [[Jacques Fath]]. Chanel was convinced that women would ultimately rebel against the aesthetic favored by the male couturiers, what she called \"illogical\" design: the \"waist cinchers, padded bras, heavy skirts, and stiffened jackets\".<ref name=\"EC-R-1981\" />\n\nAt more than 70 years old, after having her couture house closed for 15 years, she felt the time was right for her to re-enter the fashion world.<ref name=\"EC-R-1981\" />{{RP|320}} The revival of her couture house in 1954 was fully financed by Chanel's opponent in the perfume battle, Pierre Wertheimer.<ref name=\"Mazzeo-2010\" />{{RP|176\u201377}} When Chanel came out with her comeback collection in 1954, the French press were cautious due to her collaboration during the war and the controversy of the collection.

When Chanel died, the first lady of France, Mme Pompidou, organized a hero's tribute. Soon, damaging documents from French intelligence agencies were released that outlined Chanel's wartime involvements, quickly ending her monumental funeral plans.<ref name=\"autoRefA\" />\n\n==Legacy as designer==\n[[File:Gabrielle Chanel en marini\u00e8re.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Chanel wearing a sailor's jersey and trousers, 1928]]\n\nAs early as 1915, ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' raved over Chanel's designs: \"The woman who hasn't at least one Chanel is hopelessly out of fashion ... This season the name Chanel is on the lips of every buyer.\"<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|14}} Chanel's ascendancy was the official deathblow to the corseted female silhouette. The frills, fuss, and constraints endured by earlier generations of women were now pass\u00e9; under her influence\u2014gone were the \"''aigrettes'', long hair, hobble skirts\".<ref name=\"EC-R-1981\" />{{RP|11}} Her design aesthetic redefined the fashionable woman in the post World War I era. The Chanel trademark look was of youthful ease, liberated physicality, and unencumbered sportive confidence.\n\nThe horse culture and penchant for hunting so passionately pursued by the elites, especially the British, fired Chanel's imagination. Her own enthusiastic indulgence in the sporting life led to clothing designs informed by those activities. From her excursions on water with the yachting world, she appropriated the clothing associated with nautical pursuits: the horizontal striped shirt, bell-bottom pants, crewneck sweaters, and ''espadrille'' shoes\u2014all traditionally worn by sailors and fishermen.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|47, 79}}\n\n===Jersey fabric===\n[[File:Chanel jersey casual wear 1917,.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Three jersey outfits by Chanel, March 1917]]\nChanel's initial triumph was her innovative use of jersey, a machine knit material manufactured for her by the firm Rodier,<ref name=\"EC-R-1981\" />{{RP|128, 133}} and a fabric traditionally relegated to the manufacture of undergarments. Chanel's early wool jersey traveling suit consisted of a cardigan jacket and pleated skirt, paired with a low-belted pullover top. This ensemble, worn with low-heeled shoes, became the casual look in expensive women's wear.<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|13, 47}} Prior to this, jersey tended to be used primarily in hosiery and for sportswear (tennis, golf, and beach attire). Considered too \"ordinary\" to be used in couture, it was also disliked by designers because the knit structure made it difficult to handle compared to woven fabrics.\n\nChanel's introduction of jersey to high-fashion worked well for two reasons: First, the war had caused a shortage of other materials, and second, women began desiring simpler and more practical clothes. Her fluid jersey suits and dresses were created for practicality and allowed for free movement. This was greatly appreciated at the time because women were working for the war effort as nurses, in civil service, and in factories. Their jobs involved physical activity and they had to ride trains, buses, and bicycles to get to work.<ref>{{cite book|last=Leymarie|first=Jean|title=Chanel|year=1987|publisher=Rizzoli International Publications|location=New York|page=57}}</ref> They desired outfits that did not give way easily and could be put on without the help of servants.<ref name=\"Wallach-1998\"/>{{RP|28}}\n\n===Slavic influence===\nDesigners such as Paul Poiret and [[Mariano Fortuny (designer)|Fortuny]] introduced ethnic references into haute couture in the 1900s and early 1910s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/i/introduction-to-20th-century-fashion/ |title=Introduction to 20th Century Fashion, V&A |publisher=Vam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=23 May 2012}}</ref> Chanel continued this trend with [[Slav]]-inspired designs in the early 1920s. The beading and embroidery on her garments at this time was exclusively executed by [[Kitmir]], an embroidery house founded by an exiled Russian aristocrat, the [[Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia (1890\u20131958)|Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna]], who was the sister of Chanel's erstwhile lover, [[Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich]].<ref>[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O72654/evening-dress/ 1922 evening dress embroidered by Kitmir] in the Victoria & Albert Museum collections</ref><ref name=babushka/> Kitmir's fusion of oriental stitching with stylised folk motifs was highlighted in Chanel's early collections.<ref name=babushka/> One 1922 evening dress came with a matching embroidered '[[headscarf|babushka]]' headscarf.<ref name=babushka>The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, New Series, Vol. 63, No. 2 (Fall, 2005) p.39.

It consisted of a jacket and skirt in supple and light wool or mohair tweed, and a blouse and jacket lining in jersey or silk. Chanel did not stiffen the material or use shoulder pads, as was common in contemporary fashion. She cut the jackets on the straight grain, without adding bust darts. This allowed for quick and easy movement. She designed the neckline to leave the neck comfortably free and added functional pockets. For a higher level of comfort, the skirt had a [[grosgrain]] stay around the waist, instead of a belt. More importantly, meticulous attention was placed on detail during fittings. Measurements were taken of a customer in a standing position with arms folded at shoulder height. Chanel conducted tests with models, having them walk around, step up to a platform as if climbing stairs of an imaginary bus, and bend as if getting into a low-slung sports car. Chanel wanted to make sure women could do all of these things while wearing her suit, without accidentally exposing parts of their body they wanted covered. Each client would have repeated adjustments until their suit was comfortable enough for them to perform daily activities with comfort and ease.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gautier|first=Jerome|title=Chanel: The Vocabulary of Style|year=2011|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=244}}</ref>\n\n=== Camellia ===\nThe [[camellia]] had an established association used in [[Alexandre Dumas, fils|Alexandre Dumas]]' literary work, ''La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias'' ([[The Lady of the Camellias]]). Its heroine and her story had resonated for Chanel since her youth. The flower was associated with the [[courtesan]], who would wear a camellia to advertise her availability.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jacobs |first1=Laura |title=The Enduring Coco Chanel |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204323904577038572818601252 |accessdate=6 September 2012 |work=Wall Street Journal |date=19 November 2011}}</ref> The camellia came to be identified with The House of Chanel; the designer first used it in 1933 as a decorative element on a white-trimmed black suit.<ref name=\"vogue1\"/>\n\n===Little black dress===\nAfter the jersey suit, the concept of the [[little black dress]] is often cited as a Chanel contribution to the fashion lexicon, a style still worn to this day. In 1912\u20131913, the actress Suzanne Orlandi was one of the first women to wear a Chanel little black dress, in velvet with a white collar.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fashion design for Suzanne Orlandi, \u00c9t\u00e9 1901, by Jeanne Paquin |url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O538478/ete-1901-fashion-design-paquin-jeanne/ |website=V&A Search the Collections |accessdate=8 April 2016}}</ref> In 1920, Chanel herself vowed that, while observing an audience at the opera, she would dress all women in black.<ref name=Picardie-2010/>{{RP|92\u201393}}\n\nIn 1926, the American edition of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' published an image of a Chanel little black dress with long sleeves, dubbing it the ''gar\u00e7onne'' ('little boy' look).<ref name=\"vogue1\"/> ''Vogue'' predicted that such a simple yet chic design would become a virtual uniform for women of taste, famously comparing its basic lines to the ubiquitous and no less widely accessible [[Ford Model T|Ford automobile]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wollen |first1=Peter |editor1-last=Naremore |editor1-first=James |editor2-last=Brantlinger |editor2-first=Patrick |title=Modernity and Mass Culture |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0253206275 |page=[https://archive.org/details/modernitymasscul0000unse/page/49 49] |chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CeEfBGnsbkwC&pg=PA49 |language=en |chapter=Cinema/Americanism/the Robot |year=1991 |url=https://archive.org/details/modernitymasscul0000unse/page/49 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=English|first1=Bonnie|title=A Cultural History of Fashion in the 20th and 21st Centuries: From Catwalk to Sidewalk|date=2013|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=978-0857851369|page=36|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DZUdAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA36|language=en}}</ref> The spare look generated widespread criticism from male journalists, who complained: \"no more bosom, no more stomach, no more rump ...

The 1930s was the [[Great Depression]] era, when women needed affordable fashion. Chanel boasted that she had enabled the non-wealthy to \"walk around like millionaires\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Pendergast|first=Tom and Sarah|title=Fashion, Costume and Culture |year=2004 |publisher=Thomson Gale |location=Farmington Hills, MI|page=792}}</ref><ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|47}} Chanel started making little black dresses in wool or [[Chenille fabric|chenille]] for the day and in [[satin]], [[Cr\u00eape (textile)|cr\u00eape]] or [[velvet]] for the evening.<ref name=\"Wallach-1998\"/>{{RP|83}}\n\nChanel proclaimed \"I imposed black; it's still going strong today, for black wipes out everything else around.\"<ref name=Picardie-2010/>\n\n=== Jewellery ===\n\nChanel introduced a line of jewellery that was a conceptual innovation, as her designs and materials incorporated both costume jewellery and fine gem stones. This was revolutionary in an era when jewellery was strictly categorized into either fine or costume jewellery. Her inspirations were global, often inspired by design traditions of the Orient and Egypt. Wealthy clients who did not wish to display their costly jewellery in public could wear Chanel creations to impress others.<ref>{{cite book|last=Leymarie|first=Jean|title=Chanel|year=1987|publisher=Rizzoli International Publications|location=New York|page=153}}</ref>[[File:Chanel 2.55.jpg|thumb|247x247px|Chanel 2.55 bag, 2009|alt=|left]]\n\nIn 1933, designer [[Paul Iribe]] collaborated with Chanel in the creation of extravagant jewellery pieces commissioned by the International Guild of Diamond Merchants. The collection, executed exclusively in diamonds and platinum, was exhibited for public viewing and drew a large audience; some 3,000 attendees were recorded in a one-month period.<ref name=\"vogue1\"/>\n\nAs an antidote for ''vrais bijoux en toc'', the obsession with costly, fine jewels,<ref name=\"vogue1\"/> Chanel turned costume jewellery into a coveted accessory\u2014especially when worn in grand displays, as she did. Originally inspired by the opulent jewels and pearls given to her by aristocratic lovers, Chanel raided her own jewel vault and partnered with [[Fulco di Verdura|Duke Fulco di Verdura]] to launch a House of Chanel jewellery line. A white enameled cuff featuring a jeweled [[Maltese cross]] was Chanel's personal favourite; it has become an icon of the Verdura\u2013Chanel collaboration.<ref name=\"vogue1\"/> The fashionable and wealthy loved the creations and made the line wildly successful. Chanel said, \"It's disgusting to walk around with millions around the neck because one happens to be rich. I only like fake jewellery ... because it's provocative.\"<ref name=\"Vaughan-2011\" />{{RP|74}}\n\n===The Chanel bag===\nIn 1929 Chanel introduced a handbag inspired by soldier's bags. Its thin shoulder strap allowed the user to keep her hands free. Following her comeback, Chanel updated the design in February 1955, creating what would become the \"[[Chanel 2.55|2.55]]\" (named for the date of its creation).<ref name=\"peder68\">{{cite book|title=Handbags: What Every Woman Should Know|author=Pedersen, Stephanie|publisher=David & Charles|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7153-2495-0|location=Cincinnati|page=[https://archive.org/details/handbagswhatever0000pede/page/68 68]|url=https://archive.org/details/handbagswhatever0000pede/page/68}}</ref> Whilst details of the classic bag have been reworked, such as the 1980s update by [[Karl Lagerfeld]] when the clasp and lock were redesigned to incorporate the Chanel logo and leather was interlaced through the shoulder chain, the bag has retained its original basic form.<ref name=kpriss/> In 2005, the Chanel firm released an exact replica of the original 1955 bag to commemorate the 50th anniversary of its creation.<ref name=kpriss/>\n\nThe bag's design was informed by Chanel's convent days and her love of the sporting world. The chain used for the strap echoed the ''[[chatelaine (chain)|chatelaines]]'' worn by the caretakers of the orphanage where Chanel grew up, whilst the burgundy lining referenced the convent uniforms.<ref name=kpriss>{{cite web|last1=Kpriss|title=Short History of The Famous Chanel 2.55 Bag |url=http://stylefrizz.com/200712/short-history-of-the-famous-chanel-255-bag/|website=Style Frizz|accessdate=6 September 2015}}</ref> The quilted outside was influenced by the jackets worn by jockeys,<ref name=kpriss/> whilst at the same time enhancing the bag's shape and volume.<ref name=peder68/>\n\n===Suntans===\nIn an outdoor environment of turf and sea, Chanel took in the sun, making suntans not only acceptable, but a symbol denoting a life of privilege and leisure. Historically, identifiable exposure to the sun had been the mark of laborers doomed to a life of unremitting, unsheltered toil. \"A milky skin seemed a sure sign of aristocracy.\" By the mid-1920s, women could be seen lounging on the beach without a hat to shield them from the sun's rays. The Chanel influence made sun bathing fashionable.<ref name=\"EC-R-1981\" />{{RP|138\u201339}}\n\n==Depictions in popular culture==\n===Theatre===\n* The [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[Coco (musical)|Coco]]'', with music by [[Andr\u00e9 Previn]], book and lyrics by [[Alan Jay Lerner]], opened 18 December 1969 and closed 3 October 1970. It is set in 1953\u20131954 at the time that Chanel was reestablishing her couture house. Chanel was played by [[Katharine Hepburn]] for the first eight months, and by [[Danielle Darrieux]] for the rest of its run.\n\n===Film===\n* The first film about Chanel was ''[[Chanel Solitaire]]'' (1981), directed by [[George Kaczender]] and starring [[Marie-France Pisier]], [[Timothy Dalton]], and [[Rutger Hauer]].\n* ''[[Coco Chanel (film)|Coco Chanel]]'' (2008) was a television movie starring [[Shirley MacLaine]] as the 70-year-old Chanel. Directed by [[Christian Duguay (director)|Christian Duguay]], the film also starred [[Barbora Bobu\u013eov\u00e1]] as the young Chanel and [[Olivier Sitruk]] as Boy Capel.\n* ''[[Coco Before Chanel|Coco avant Chanel]]'' (''Coco Before Chanel'') (2009) was a French-language biographical film starring [[Audrey Tautou]] as the young Chanel, with [[Beno\u00eet Poelvoorde]] as \u00c9tienne Balsan and [[Alessandro Nivola]] as Boy Capel\n* ''[[Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky]]'' (2009) was a French-language film directed by [[Jan Kounen]]. [[Anna Mouglalis]] played Chanel, and [[Mads Mikkelsen]] played [[Igor Stravinsky]]. The film was based on the 2002 novel ''[[Coco and Igor]]'' by [[Chris Greenhalgh]], which concerns a purported affair between Chanel and Stravinsky.
