The bottom of the short ski was either plain or covered with animal skin to aid this use, while the long ski supporting the weight of the skier was treated with animal fat in similar manner to modern [[ski wax]]ing. Early record of this type of skis survives in works of [[Olaus Magnus]].<ref>Olaus Magnus, 1555:1,4</ref> He associates them to [[Sami people]] and gives [[Sami languages|Sami]] names of savek and golos for the plain and skinned short ski. Finnish names for these are ''lyly and kalhu'' for long and short ski.\n\nThe seal hunters at the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] had developed a special long ski to sneak into shooting distance to the seals' breathing holes, though the ski was useful in moving in the packed ice in general and was made specially long, 3\u20134 meters, to protect against cracks in the ice.

[http://www.vbm.se/assets/files/Pdf/Vbn_history_69f/1971_2.pdf]</ref>\n\nAround 1850 artisans in Telemark, Norway invent the cambered ski. This ski arches up in the middle, under the binding, which distributes the skier's weight more evenly across the length of the ski. Earlier plank-style skis had to be thick enough not to bow downward and sink in the snow under the skier's weight.<ref name=\"Evolution of Ski Shape\">{{cite web|last=Masia|first=Seth|title=Evolution of Ski Shape|url=http://skiinghistory.org/history/evolution-ski-shape/|accessdate=15 November 2012}}</ref> Norheim's ski was also the first with a [[sidecut]] that narrowed the ski underfoot while the tip and tail remained wider. This enabled the ski to flex and turn more easily.<ref name=\"Evolution of Ski Shape\" />\n\nIn 1950 [[Howard Head]] introduced the [[Head Standard]], constructed by sandwiching aluminum alloy around a [[plywood]] core. The design included steel edges (invented in 1928 in [[Austria]],<ref name=\"Evolution of Ski Shape\"/>) and the exterior surfaces were made of [[phenol formaldehyde resin]] which could hold wax.

In the 1800s, skiing evolved into a sport and the toe strap was replaced by a metal clip under the toe. This provided much greater grip on the boot, allowing the ski to be pushed sideways. The heel strap also changed over time; in order to allow a greater range of motion, a spring was added to allow the strap to lengthen when the boot was rotated up off the ski.\n\nThis buckled strap was later replaced by a metal cable.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lert|first1=Wolfgang|title=A Binding Revolution|journal=Skiing Heritage Journal|date=March 2002|page=26}}</ref> The cable binding remained in use, and even increased in popularity, throughout this period as cross-country skiing developed into a major sport of its own. Change eventually came through the evolution of the [[Rottefella]] binding, first introduced in 1927. The original Rottefella eliminated the heel strap, which held the boot forward in the binding, by drilling small holes in the sole of the boot which fit into pins in the toe piece. This was standardized as the 3-pin system, which was widespread by the 1970s.<ref name=rot>[http://www.rottefella.no/en/Our-history/ \"About Us\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906104003/http://www.rottefella.no/en/Our-history/ |date=2015-09-06 }}, Rottefella</ref> It has now generally been replaced by the NNN system.\n\nThe introduction of ski lifts in 1908 led to an evolution of skiing as a sport. In the past, skiers would have to ski or walk up the hills they intended to ski down. With the lift, the skiers could leave their skis on, and would be skiing downhill all the time. The need to unclip the heel for cross-country use was eliminated, at least at resorts with lifts. As lifts became more common, especially with the introduction of the chairlift in 1936, the ski world split into cross-country and downhill, a split that remains to this day.\n\nIn 1937 Hjalmar Hvam broke his leg skiing, and while recuperating from surgery, invented the Saf-Ski toe binding.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Masia|first1=Seth|title=RELEASE!

The bottom of the short ski was either plain or covered with animal skin to aid this use, while the long ski supporting the weight of the skier was treated with animal fat in similar manner to modern [[ski wax]]ing. Early record of this type of skis survives in works of [[Olaus Magnus]].<ref>Olaus Magnus, 1555:1,4</ref> He associates them to [[Sami people]] and gives [[Sami languages|Sami]] names of savek and golos for the plain and skinned short ski. Finnish names for these are ''lyly and kalhu'' for long and short ski.\n\nThe seal hunters at the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] had developed a special long ski to sneak into shooting distance to the seals' breathing holes, though the ski was useful in moving in the packed ice in general and was made specially long, 3\u20134 meters, to protect against cracks in the ice. This is called skredst\u00e5ng in Swedish.<ref>\"V\u00e4sterbotten 1971 nr. 2\" magazine in Swedish, includes copious pictures of the ski and the associated equipment. [http://www.vbm.se/assets/files/Pdf/Vbn_history_69f/1971_2.pdf]</ref>\n\nAround 1850 artisans in Telemark, Norway invent the cambered ski. This ski arches up in the middle, under the binding, which distributes the skier's weight more evenly across the length of the ski. Earlier plank-style skis had to be thick enough not to bow downward and sink in the snow under the skier's weight.<ref name=\"Evolution of Ski Shape\">{{cite web|last=Masia|first=Seth|title=Evolution of Ski Shape|url=http://skiinghistory.org/history/evolution-ski-shape/|accessdate=15 November 2012}}</ref> Norheim's ski was also the first with a [[sidecut]] that narrowed the ski underfoot while the tip and tail remained wider. This enabled the ski to flex and turn more easily.<ref name=\"Evolution of Ski Shape\" />\n\nIn 1950 [[Howard Head]] introduced the [[Head Standard]], constructed by sandwiching aluminum alloy around a [[plywood]] core. The design included steel edges (invented in 1928 in [[Austria]],<ref name=\"Evolution of Ski Shape\"/>) and the exterior surfaces were made of [[phenol formaldehyde resin]] which could hold wax.

These introduced a new ski geometry, common today, with a much wider tip and tail than waist. When tipped onto their edges, they bend into a curved shape and carve a turn.

In the 1800s, skiing evolved into a sport and the toe strap was replaced by a metal clip under the toe. This provided much greater grip on the boot, allowing the ski to be pushed sideways. The heel strap also changed over time; in order to allow a greater range of motion, a spring was added to allow the strap to lengthen when the boot was rotated up off the ski.\n\nThis buckled strap was later replaced by a metal cable.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lert|first1=Wolfgang|title=A Binding Revolution|journal=Skiing Heritage Journal|date=March 2002|page=26}}</ref> The cable binding remained in use, and even increased in popularity, throughout this period as cross-country skiing developed into a major sport of its own. Change eventually came though the evolution of the [[Rottefella]] binding, first introduced in 1927. The original Rottefella eliminated the heel strap, which held the boot forward in the binding, by drilling small holes in the sole of the boot which fit into pins in the toe piece. This was standardized as the 3-pin system, which was widespread by the 1970s.<ref name=rot>[http://www.rottefella.no/en/Our-history/ \"About Us\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906104003/http://www.rottefella.no/en/Our-history/ |date=2015-09-06 }}, Rottefella</ref> It has now generally been replaced by the NNN system.\n\nThe introduction of ski lifts in 1908 led to an evolution of skiing as a sport. In the past, skiers would have to ski or walk up the hills they intended to ski down. With the lift, the skiers could leave their skis on, and would be skiing downhill all the time. The need to unclip the heel for cross-country use was eliminated, at least at resorts with lifts. As lifts became more common, especially with the introduction of the chairlift in 1936, the ski world split into cross-country and downhill, a split that remains to this day.\n\nIn 1937 Hjalmar Hvam broke his leg skiing, and while recuperating from surgery, invented the Saf-Ski toe binding.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Masia|first1=Seth|title=RELEASE!

As skiing became more specialized, so too did ski boots, leading to the splitting of designs between those for [[alpine skiing]] and [[cross-country skiing (sport)|cross-country skiing]].<ref>Seth Masia [https://www.skiinghistory.org/news/short-colorful-history-ski-boots \"A Short History of Ski Boots\"] at SkiingHistory.org</ref>\n\nModern skiing developed as an all-round sport with uphill, downhill and cross-country portions.
