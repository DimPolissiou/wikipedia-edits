Hence, the yeshiva curriculum contains weekly classes in [[Tanakh]], [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Hasidic philosophy]], and the works of Jewish  scholars such as [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]], [[Maimonides]], [[Judah Halevi]], [[Joseph B.

The yeshiva believes that the keys to solving Israel\u2019s socioeconomic gaps lie in integration and education. All the students volunteer in the community mainly in the field of education. Many of the yeshiva's alumni settle in Yeruham instead of heading to the country's central cities.\n\nThe yeshiva also promotes other programs, among them:\n* ''Ye'adim'' (goals) - Concern of the Ethiopian Jewry in Israel's situation led Yerucham students to create a leadership training program for Ethiopian students with the intention of their returning to their communities. During the 5 years of Hesder the students synchronize their full Yeshiva studies with a [[Bachelor of Education|B.Ed.]] degree in [[Herzog College]].\n* Young Study Partners - First and second year students dedicate 2 hours weekly to studying Torah subjects with children from the local elementary school. They also serve as positive role models for the local youth and look to form a connection with their families.\n* Charity Fund - The goal of the Fund is to help the needy of Yeruham become self-sufficient and better managers of their money. The Fund uses the cooperation of the local welfare and professional financial advisors to this end.\n* ''B'levav Shalem'' Yeshiva High School \u2013 Because of the lack of high quality religious high schools in the [[Negev]], and as a part of the integration program the Hesder Yeshiva believes in, it was decided by alumni, residents of Yerucham, to open a Yeshiva High School for the local and general population.\n\n==Educational staff==\n[[File:\u05d4\u05e8\u05d1 \u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d2.JPG|thumb|Rabbi Blumenzweig]]\nIn addition to Rabbi Blumenzweig, rabbis who teach in the Yeshiva include Rabbis [[Uriel Eitam]], Chaim Wolfson, Shai Gnizi, Shmuel Gleizer, Achiya Ben Pazi, Shmuel Ariel and Elyakim Sharir<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/33/51/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd - \u05e6\u05d5\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4|website=www.yhy.co.il|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>.

Night seder consists of learning bekiut, and it goes from 8:30pm until at least 11:00pm, although there is no given time for night seder to end, and many students learn until much later.[[File:Hayeshiva.jpg|thumb|Lunch room of the Yeshiva]]'''Daily Schedule''': \n\nShachrit: 6:30am-8:00am\n\nBreakfast: 8:00am-8:30am\n\nMorning seder: 8:30am-1:00pm\n\nLunch/break: 1:00pm-3:00pm\n\nMincha: 3:00pm-3:20pm\n\nAfternoon seder: 3:20pm-7:30pm\n\nSupper: 7:30pm-8:00pm\n\nMarriv: 8:00pm-8:30pm \n\nNight seder: 8:30pm-11:00pm (or later)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/26/46/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd|last=|first=|date=|website=www.yhy.co.il|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>\n\nThe yeshiva guides its students to base their perspective upon the teachings of [[Yehuda Halevi|Rabbi Yehuda Halevi]] and the [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|Maharal of Prague]] in accordance with the ideology of [[Abraham Isaac Kook|Rabbi A.Y. Kook]], as is often customary in Religious Zionist yeshivas.\nWith the goal of educating students to deal independently with the challenges they face living as an [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|observant Jews in modern time]] in mind, the yeshiva encourages a broader study of Biblical, rabbinic, and other classical and modern sources. Hence, the yeshiva curriculum contains weekly classes in [[Tanakh]], [[Medieval philosophy|Medieval]] [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Hasidic philosophy]], and the works of contemporary scholars such as Rabbi [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]].\n\n==Educational approach==\nThe yeshiva educates its students to be aware of their surroundings and attentive to the needs of society in general. The yeshiva believes that the keys to solving Israel\u2019s socioeconomic gaps lie in integration and education. All the students volunteer in the community mainly in the field of education. Many of the yeshiva's alumni settle in Yeruham instead of heading to the country's central cities.\n\nThe yeshiva also promotes other programs, among them:\n* ''Ye'adim'' (goals) - Concern of the Ethiopian Jewry in Israel's situation led Yerucham students to create a leadership training program for Ethiopian students with the intention of their returning to their communities. During the 5 years of Hesder the students synchronize their full Yeshiva studies with a [[Bachelor of Education|B.Ed.]] degree in [[Herzog College]].\n* Young Study Partners - First and second year students dedicate 2 hours weekly to studying Torah subjects with children from the local elementary school. They also serve as positive role models for the local youth and look to form a connection with their families.\n* Charity Fund - The goal of the Fund is to help the needy of Yeruham become self-sufficient and better managers of their money. The Fund uses the cooperation of the local welfare and professional financial advisors to this end.\n* ''B'levav Shalem'' Yeshiva High School \u2013 Because of the lack of high quality religious high schools in the [[Negev]], and as a part of the integration program the Hesder Yeshiva believes in, it was decided by alumni, residents of Yerucham, to open a Yeshiva High School for the local and general population.\n\n==Educational staff==\n[[File:\u05d4\u05e8\u05d1 \u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d2.JPG|thumb|Rabbi Blumenzweig]]\nIn addition to Rabbi Blumenzweig, rabbis who teach in the Yeshiva include Rabbis [[Uriel Eitam]], Chaim Wolfson, Shai Gnizi, Shmuel Gleizer, Achiya Ben Pazi, Shmuel Ariel and Elyakim Sharir<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/33/51/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd - \u05e6\u05d5\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4|website=www.yhy.co.il|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>.

When his mother died in 1465, he succeeded to her feudal claims.\n\nAs a [[condottiero]], Alfonso fought in the most important wars of the age, such the war following the [[Pazzi Conspiracy]] (1478\u20131480) and the [[War of Ferrara]] (1482\u20131484).

The Margrave convinced his soldiers to reboard the boats and provided two additional boats to alleviate crowding.{{sfnp|Krebs|2013|p=54}}  The Margrave sailed with them as far as [[Mainz]], where he succeeded in getting a bridge opened without the consent of Archbishop-Elector [[Friedrich Karl Joseph von Erthal]].{{sfnp|Lowell|1884|p=48\u201350}}\n\nThe Margrave of Ansbach-Bayreuth was deeply in debt when the war broke out, and received more than \u00a3100,000 for the use of his soldiers.{{sfnp|Lowell|1884|p=11}} In 1791 he sold Ansbach and Bayreuth to [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and lived the rest of his life in England on a Prussian pension.{{sfnp|Lowell|1884|p=12}}\n\n===Waldeck===\n[[Waldeck (state)|Waldeck]] had made a treaty to support Great Britain in London on 20 April 1776. Prince [[Friedrich Karl August, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont|Friedrich Karl August of Waldeck]] kept three regiments ready for paid foreign service. The first of these regiments, with 684 officers and men, sailed from [[Portsmouth]] in July 1776 and participated in the [[New York and New Jersey campaign|New York campaign]].{{sfnp|Eelking|1893|p=47}} During the campaign the Waldeck regiment captured wine and spirits belonging to American [[Charles Lee (general)|General Lee]] and were embittered towards the British General Howe when he made them empty the bottles by the roadside.{{sfnp|Eelking|1893|p=50}}\n\nThe Waldeck troops were integrated into the German auxiliaries under Hessian General Wilhelm von Knyphausen.\n\nIn 1778, the 3rd Waldeck Regiment was sent to defend [[Pensacola, Florida#British|Pensacola]] as part of the British force under General [[John Campbell, of Strachur|John Campbell]].{{sfnp|Krebs|2013|P=218-219}}  The Regiment was dispersed throughout [[West Florida]], including [[Fort Bute]], [[Mobile, Alabama#Colonial|Mobile]] and Baton Rouge.  The regimental commander, Colonel Johann Ludwig Wilhelm von Hanxleden, complained that his soldiers were sickened and even died due to the climate.  The remote locations received few supply ships, and the soldiers' pay was insufficient to buy local goods.  Prince August informed Lord Germain that Waldeck could not recruit new soldiers fast enough to replace those dying in West Florida.{{sfnp|Krebs|2013|p=220}}  In addition to slow supplies, the British and Waldeck forces did not receive news in a timely manner.  They were unaware that [[Spain and the American Revolutionary War|Spain had declared war]] on Great Britain until they were attacked by forces under [[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez, 1st Viscount of Galveston|Spanish Governor Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez]].  When this campaign was complete at the [[Siege of Pensacola]], Spain recruited many of the poorly fed and supplied Waldeck soldiers.{{sfnp|Krebs|2013|p=222}}  British prisoners of war were later exchanged, but Waldeck prisoners of war were kept by the Spanish in New Orleans, [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]], and more than a year in [[Havana]] before finally being exchanged in 1782.{{sfnp|Krebs|2013|p=219}}\n\nWaldeck contributed 1,225 men to the war, and lost 720 as casualties or deserters.<ref name=E257/>  In the course of the war, 358 Waldeck soldiers died from sickness, and 37 died from combat.{{sfnp|Krebs|2013|p=219}}\n\n===Hanover===\n\nFive battalions of troops of the [[Electorate of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] (Hanover), whose Elector was none other than the British King George III, were sent to [[Gibraltar]] and [[Menorca]] to relieve the British soldiers stationed there, who could then be sent to fight in America.<ref name=\"Eelking, 16\"/>  Since Hanover was ruled in [[personal union]] and had its own government, Hanoverian troops were deployed under a British-Hanoverian Treaty in which Great Britain agreed to pay Hanoverian expenses and defend Hanover against invasion while the troops were away.{{sfnp|Rosengarten|1886|p=62\u201363}}  These Hanoverian soldiers were defenders during the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar]], the largest and longest battle of the war, and in the [[Invasion of Menorca, 1781|defense of Menorca]].  Late in the war, two regiments from Hanover were sent to [[British India]], where they served under British command in the [[Siege of Cuddalore]] against a combined French and [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysorean]] defense.\n\n===Anhalt-Zerbst===\nThe Prince of [[Principality of Anhalt-Zerbst|Anhalt-Zerbst]], [[Frederick Augustus, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst|Frederick Augustus]] signed a treaty to provide Great Britain with 1,160 men in 1777.  The Regiment of two battalions was raised in five months, and consisted of 900 new recruits.{{sfnp|Eelking|1893|p=238}} One battalion of 600\u2013700 men arrived in the Canadas in May 1778 to guard [[Quebec City]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Chapter 2: The Revolt of Pontiac and the American Invasion.

In 1690, German colonials built the first paper mill in North America, and the Bible was printed in America in German before it was printed in English. By the mid-18th century, approximately 10% of the colonial American population spoke German.{{sfnp|Bobrick|1997|p=41}} Germans were easily the largest non-British European minority in British North America, but their assimilation and [[Anglicisation]] varied greatly.{{sfnp|Wolf|1993|p=263}}\n\nDuring the [[French and Indian War]], Great Britain utilized the large German population in North America by forming the [[Royal American Regiment]], whose enlisted men were principally German colonists.{{sfnp|Rosengarten|1886|p=11}} The regiment's first commander was General [[Henry Bouquet]], a Swiss native. The regiment would later be commanded by General Howe. Other Germans came to North America during the French and Indian War, including [[Frederick, Baron de Weissenfels]], who settled in [[New York State]] as a British officer. When the Revolutionary War began, Weissenfels deserted the British forces and served with the rebellion from 1775 until the end of the war, obtaining a Congressional commission as a lieutenant colonel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.rbc/rbpe.20901100|title=A brief memoir of the late Colonel Frederick Baron de Weissenfels|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}</ref>\n\nAs with other ethnic groups in the British colonies, German-speaking colonists were divided, supporting both the Patriot and Loyalist causes.

Other colonies formed German regiments, or filled the ranks of local militias with German Americans. German colonists in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], formed a [[fusilier]] company in 1775, and some Germans in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] enlisted under General [[Anthony Wayne]].{{sfnp|Rosengarten|1906|p=18}}\n\nGerman colonists are most remembered in [[Pennsylvania in the American Revolution|Pennsylvania]], partly due to friendlier naturalization terms for immigrants,{{sfnp|Rosengarten|1886|p=10}} and also because the German soldiers in Pennsylvania stand in contrast to the large, pacifist [[Quaker]] population in Pennsylvania.{{sfnp|Rosengarten|1886|p=11}} Brothers [[Peter Muhlenberg|Peter]] and [[Frederick Muhlenberg]], for example, were first-generation Pennsylvanians who were educated at the German [[Francke Foundations]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Horn |first=Joshua |title=Peter Muhlenberg: The Pastor Turned Soldier |date=9 November 2015 |journal=Journal of the American Revolution |url=http://allthingsliberty.com/2015/11/peter-muhlenberg-the-pastor-turned-soldier/#_edn2 |accessdate=29 November 2015}}</ref>  Both were elected to Congress, and Peter served on Washington's general staff.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Jonathan M |title=God on Three Sides.

Unlike most continental line units, it drew from multiple states,{{sfnp|Stephenson|2007|p=30}} initially comprising eight companies: four from [[Maryland]] and four (later five) from Pennsylvania. [[Nicholas Haussegger]], a major under General Anthony Wayne, was commissioned as the colonel. <!-- [[John Adams]] hoped the German Regiment would free \"natives of the country who were needed for Agriculture, Manufactures, and Commerce.\"{{sfnp|Stephenson|2007|p=30}} [Unclear in this context, as the unit was drawn from ethnic German colonists, not hired as auxiliaries or mercenaries] --> The regiment saw service at the [[Battle of Trenton]] and the [[Battle of Princeton]], and took part in [[Sullivan Expedition|campaigns against American Indians]]. The regiment was disbanded 1 January 1781.{{sfnp|Rosengarten|1886|p=103}}\n\n===Europeans===\nEuropean Germans also came to the United States as allied soldiers. Some Germans came to the United States under the French flag. [[Johann de Kalb]] was a [[Bavaria]]n who served in the armies of France before receiving a commission as a general in the Continental Army. France had eight German-speaking regiments with over 2,500 soldiers.{{sfnp|Rosengarten|1886|p=110\u2013111}} The famous [[Lauzun's Legion]] included both French and German soldiers, and was commanded in German.{{sfnp|Marston|2003|p=20}}  There were also German soldiers and officers in the French [[Royal Deux-Ponts Regiment]].<ref name=\"The Revolution's Black Soldiers\"/>\n\n[[File:Friedrich der Gro\u00dfe (1781 or 1786) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Frederick the Great (1781)]]\nOther Germans came to the United States to utilize their military training. [[Frederick William, Baron de Woedtke]], for example, was a Prussian officer who obtained a Congressional commission early in the war; he died in New York in 1776.{{sfnp|Lossing|1860|=123}}  [[Gustave Rosenthal]] was an ethnic German from [[Estonia]] who became an officer in the Continental Army. He returned to Estonia after the war, but other German soldiers, such as [[David Ziegler]], chose to stay and become citizens in the nation they had helped found.\n\nPerhaps the most well-known German to support the Patriot cause was [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]] from [[Prussia]], who came to America independently, through France, and served under [[George Washington]] as [[inspector general]]. General von Steuben is credited with training the Continental Army at [[Valley Forge]], and he later wrote the first [[Military drill|drill]] manual for the [[United States Army]]. In June 1780 he was given command of the advance guard in the defense of [[Morristown, New Jersey]] from General Knyphausen \u2013 a battle briefly led by two opposing German generals.{{sfnp|Lockhart|2008|p=225\u2013227}}\n\nVon Steuben's native Prussia joined the [[First League of Armed Neutrality|League of Armed Neutrality]],{{sfnp|Commager|1958|p=994}} and [[Frederick II of Prussia]] was well appreciated in the United States for his support early in the war. He expressed interest in opening trade with the United States and bypassing English ports, and allowed an American agent to buy arms in Prussia.{{sfnp|Rosengarten|1906|p=5}} Frederick predicted American success,{{sfnp|Rosengarten|1906|p=13}} and promised to recognize the United States and American diplomats once France did the same.{{sfnp|Rosengarten|1906|p=14}} Prussia also interfered in the recruiting efforts of Russia and neighboring German states when they raised armies to send to the Americas, and Frederick II forbade enlistment for the American war within Prussia.{{sfnp|Rosengarten|1886|p=22}} All Prussian roads were denied to troops from Anhalt-Zerbst,{{sfnp|Lowell|1884|p=50}} which delayed reinforcements that Howe had hoped to receive during the winter of 1777\u20131778.{{sfnp|Rosengarten|1906|p=17}}\n\nHowever, when the [[War of the Bavarian Succession]] erupted, Frederick II became much more cautious with Prussian/British relations. US ships were denied access to Prussian ports, and Frederick refused to officially recognize the United States until they had signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]]. Even after the war, Frederick II predicted that the United States was too large to operate as a [[republic]], and that it would soon rejoin the British Empire with representatives in Parliament.{{sfnp|Rosengarten|1906|p=19}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n;Notes\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{cite book |last=Bobrick |first=Benson |title=Angel in the Whirlwind.

Unlike most continental line units, it drew from multiple states,{{sfnp|Stephenson|2007|p=30}} initially comprising eight companies: four from [[Maryland]] and four (later five) from Pennsylvania. [[Nicholas Haussegger]], a major under General Anthony Wayne, was commissioned as the colonel. <!-- [[John Adams]] hoped the German Regiment would free \"natives of the country who were needed for Agriculture, Manufactures, and Commerce.\"{{sfnp|Stephenson|2007|p=30}} [Unclear in this context, as the unit was drawn from ethnic German colonists, not hired as auxiliaries or mercenaries] --> The regiment saw service at the [[Battle of Trenton]] and the [[Battle of Princeton]], and took part in [[Sullivan Expedition|campaigns against American Indians]]. The regiment was disbanded 1 January 1781.{{sfnp|Rosengarten|1886|p=103}}\n\n===Europeans===\nEuropean Germans also came to the United States as allied soldiers. Some Germans came to the United States under the French flag. [[Johann de Kalb]] was a [[Bavaria]]n who served in the armies of France before receiving a commission as a general in the Continental Army. France had eight German-speaking regiments with over 2,500 soldiers.{{sfnp|Rosengarten|1886|p=110\u2013111}} The famous [[Lauzun's Legion]] included both French and German soldiers, and was commanded in German.{{sfnp|Marston|2003|p=20}}  There were also German soldiers and officers in the French [[Royal Deux-Ponts Regiment]].<ref name=\"The Revolution's Black Soldiers\"/>\n\n[[File:Friedrich der Gro\u00dfe (1781 or 1786) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Frederick the Great (1781)]]\nOther Germans came to the United States to utilize their military training. [[Frederick William, Baron de Woedtke]], for example, was a Prussian officer who obtained a Congressional commission early in the war; he died in New York in 1776.{{sfnp|Lossing|1860|=123}}  [[Gustave Rosenthal]] was an ethnic German from [[Estonia]] who became an officer in the Continental Army. He returned to Estonia after the war, but other German soldiers, such as [[David Ziegler]], chose to stay and become citizens in the nation they had helped found.\n\nPerhaps the most well-known German to support the Patriot cause was [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]] from [[Prussia]], who came to America independently, through France, and served under [[George Washington]] as [[inspector general]]. General von Steuben is credited with training the Continental Army at [[Valley Forge]], and he later wrote the first [[Military drill|drill]] manual for the [[United States Army]]. In June 1780 he was given command of the advance guard in the defense of [[Morristown, New Jersey]] from General Knyphausen \u2013 a battle briefly led by two opposing German generals.{{sfnp|Lockhart|2008|p=225\u2013227}}\n\nVon Steuben's native Prussia joined the [[First League of Armed Neutrality|League of Armed Neutrality]],{{sfnp|Commager|1958|p=994}} and [[Frederick II of Prussia]] was well appreciated in the United States for his support early in the war. He expressed interest in opening trade with the United States and bypassing English ports, and allowed an American agent to buy arms in Prussia.{{sfnp|Rosengarten|1906|p=5}} Frederick predicted American success,{{sfnp|Rosengarten|1906|p=13}} and promised to recognize the United States and American diplomats once France did the same.{{sfnp|Rosengarten|1906|p=14}} Prussia also interfered in the recruiting efforts of Russia and neighboring German states when they raised armies to send to the Americas, and Frederick II forbade enlistment for the American war within Prussia.{{sfnp|Rosengarten|1886|p=22}} All Prussian roads were denied to troops from Anhalt-Zerbst,{{sfnp|Lowell|1884|p=50}} which delayed reinforcements that Howe had hoped to receive during the winter of 1777\u20131778.{{sfnp|Rosengarten|1906|p=17}}\n\nHowever, when the [[War of the Bavarian Succession]] erupted, Frederick II became much more cautious with Prussian/British relations. US ships were denied access to Prussian ports, and Frederick refused to officially recognize the United States until they had signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]]. Even after the war, Frederick II predicted that the United States was too large to operate as a [[republic]], and that it would soon rejoin the British Empire with representatives in Parliament.{{sfnp|Rosengarten|1906|p=19}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n;Notes\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{cite book |last=Bobrick |first=Benson |title=Angel in the Whirlwind.

Fifty-one were built, of which the Germans seized twenty-four when they occupied [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Bohemia-Moravia]] in March 1939 and the [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovaks]] captured eighteen when they declared independence from Czechoslovakia at the same time. Romania acquired nine when Czech troops sought refuge in Romania after the Hungarian invasion of [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] that same month. Slovak vehicles saw combat in the [[Slovak-Hungarian War]], the [[invasion of Poland]], the opening months of [[Operation Barbarossa]] and the [[Slovak National Uprising]].\n\n== Description ==\nThe ''OA vz. 30's'' armored body was mounted on a [[Tatra (company)|Tatra]] 6 x 4 ''T-72'' truck chassis. The chassis design was unusual as it was a central tube design with independently sprung rear half-axles which gave good cross-country performance. The driver sat on the right side using an observation port protected by an armored shutter with a vision slit. The assistant driver sat on the left and had a small vision port for his ''[[ZB vz. 26]]'' light machine gun. It was mounted in a firing slit directly to his front. There were similar vision ports on both sides. The crew accessed the fighting compartment from a door in the rear of the vehicle. The gunner sat in a small, cylindrical turret with 360\u00b0 of traverse. It had an observation port in the front and vision slits on both sides and the rear. The turret had another ''ZB vz. 26'' light machine gun in a ball mount. Another machine gun was carried inside the vehicle. 3000 rounds were stored for the machine guns. The armor ranged between {{convert|3|to|6|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick; this was deemed enough to deflect ordinary bullets fired from over {{convert|100|m|yd}} distance.<ref>Kliment and Francev, pp. 28-30</ref>\n\nThe {{convert|1.91|l|cuin}}, air-cooled, {{convert|32|hp|kW}}, 4-cylinder [[Flat engine|boxer]] Tatra ''71'' engine was mounted in the front. It gave a top speed of {{convert|60|km/h|mph}}. It could cross a ditch {{convert|.5|m|ft}} wide, climb an obstacle {{convert|.28|m|ft}} high and ford a stream {{convert|.3|m|ft}} deep.<ref>Kliment and Francev, p. 275</ref>\n\n== Development ==\nThe development history for the OA vz. 30 is difficult to sort out, but the Czech Army had been evaluating various Tatra truck chassis for use as armored cars since 1926 with a number of prototypes built over the years with both wooden and metal bodies to test vehicle layouts. An order was finally placed on 6 March 1933 for fifty-one for delivery in December. Tatra was late and only delivered the first six on 29 January 1934 followed by sixteen more in February and the rest in July because their garages in [[Milovice (Nymburk District)|Milovice]] were not yet complete.<ref>Kliment and Francev, pp. 29-31</ref>\n\n== Operational history ==\n[[File:Lt38 3.jpg|thumb|306x306px|Replica of OA vz. 30]]\n===Czechoslovakia===\nIn service they proved to have some serious shortcomings. The engines were weak and did not allow the vehicle to fully exploit the abilities of the chassis, not even being able to cross the ditches at the sides of roads. The armor was thin and could be penetrated at close range by rifles and the ''ZB vz. 26'' machine guns were not capable of sustained fire.<ref>Kliment and Francev, p. 31</ref>\n\nThe Army decided to organize them in three-vehicle platoons assigned to the reconnaissance companies of the four ''Mobile (Rychl\u00e1) Divisions'' and assigned the extra platoons to support the border areas. These platoons were heavily used suppressing the [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)#Final crisis in 1938|protests and violence]] instigated by [[Konrad Henlein]]'s [[Sudeten German Party]] (''Sudetendeutsche Partei'' - SdP) and the ''Sudetendeutsche Freikorps'' (paramilitary groups trained in Germany by [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-instructors) between May and October 1938. After the [[Munich Agreement]] two companies of ''OA vz. 30s'' were sent to reinforce Slovakia and Ruthenia where they were used to repel Hungarian and Polish border-crossers, sometimes up to a battalion in strength. They helped to screen the infantry when they had to evacuate southern Slovakia after the [[First Vienna Award]] on 2 November 1938.<ref>Kliment and Francev, pp. 31-3</ref> Ten armored cars, no longer needed once that the border areas had been annexed by Germany and Hungary, were sold to the Gendarmerie in February\u2014March 1939.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fronta.cz/obrnene-automobily-oa-vz-30-u-cetnictva|title=Obrn\u011bn\u00e9 automobily OA vz. 30 u \u010detnictva|language=Czech|accessdate=2009-05-19}}</ref> Two companies defended Carpatho-Ukraine in March 1939 from a Hungarian attack, but were forced to seek refuge in Slovakia and Romania.

One was destroyed during the [[Slovak-Hungarian War]] that began a week later. The seventeen surviving ''OA vz. 30''s formed one company in the ''Armored Battalion \"Martin\"'' formed by the Slovak Army in mid-1939, but that was reduced to a platoon by late 1939.<ref>Kliment and Nakl\u00e1dal, pp. 36-7</ref> Four armored cars reinforced the ''2nd Infantry Division'' during the [[Slovak invasion of Poland|invasion of Poland]] and three others reinforced a cavalry reconnaissance unit in the vicinity of [[Sanok]].

Fifty-one were built, of which the Germans seized twenty-four when they occupied [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Bohemia-Moravia]] in March 1939 and the [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovaks]] captured eighteen when they declared independence from Czechoslovakia at the same time. Romania acquired nine when Czech troops sought refuge in Romania after the Hungarian invasion of [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] that same month. Slovak vehicles saw combat in the [[Slovak-Hungarian War]], the [[invasion of Poland]], the opening months of [[Operation Barbarossa]] and the [[Slovak National Uprising]].\n\n== Description ==\nThe ''OA vz. 30's'' armored body was mounted on a [[Tatra (company)|Tatra]] 6 x 4 ''T-72'' truck chassis. The chassis design was unusual as it was a central tube design with independently sprung rear half-axles which gave good cross-country performance. The driver sat on the right side using an observation port protected by an armored shutter with a vision slit. The assistant driver sat on the left and had a small vision port for his ''[[ZB vz. 26]]'' light machine gun. It was mounted in a firing slit directly to his front. There were similar vision ports on both sides. The crew accessed the fighting compartment from a door in the rear of the vehicle. The gunner sat in a small, cylindrical turret with 360\u00b0 of traverse. It had an observation port in the front and vision slits on both sides and the rear. The turret had another ''ZB vz. 26'' light machine gun in a ball mount. Another machine gun was carried inside the vehicle. 3000 rounds were stored for the machine guns. The armor ranged between {{convert|3|to|6|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick; this was deemed enough to deflect ordinary bullets fired from over {{convert|100|m|yd}} distance.<ref>Kliment and Francev, pp. 28-30</ref>\n\nThe {{convert|1.91|l|cuin}}, air-cooled, {{convert|32|hp|kW}}, 4-cylinder [[Flat engine|boxer]] Tatra ''71'' engine was mounted in the front. It gave a top speed of {{convert|60|km/h|mph}}. It could cross a ditch {{convert|.5|m|ft}} wide, climb an obstacle {{convert|.28|m|ft}} high and ford a stream {{convert|.3|m|ft}} deep.<ref>Kliment and Francev, p. 275</ref>\n\n== Development ==\nThe development history for the OA vz. 30 is difficult to sort out, but the Czech Army had been evaluating various Tatra truck chassis for use as armored cars since 1926 with a number of prototypes built over the years with both wooden and metal bodies to test vehicle layouts. An order was finally placed on 6 March 1933 for fifty-one for delivery in December. Tatra was late and only delivered the first six on 29 January 1934 followed by sixteen more in February and the rest in July because their garages in [[Milovice (Nymburk District)|Milovice]] were not yet complete.<ref>Kliment and Francev, pp. 29-31</ref>\n\n== Operational history ==\n===Czechoslovakia===\nIn service they proved to have some serious shortcomings. The engines were weak and did not allow the vehicle to fully exploit the abilities of the chassis, not even being able to cross the ditches at the sides of roads. The armor was thin and could be penetrated at close range by rifles and the ''ZB vz. 26'' machine guns were not capable of sustained fire.<ref>Kliment and Francev, p. 31</ref>\n\nThe Army decided to organize them in three-vehicle platoons assigned to the reconnaissance companies of the four ''Mobile (Rychl\u00e1) Divisions'' and assigned the extra platoons to support the border areas. These platoons were heavily used suppressing the [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)#Final crisis in 1938|protests and violence]] instigated by [[Konrad Henlein]]'s [[Sudeten German Party]] (''Sudetendeutsche Partei'' - SdP) and the ''Sudetendeutsche Freikorps'' (paramilitary groups trained in Germany by [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-instructors) between May and October 1938. After the [[Munich Agreement]] two companies of ''OA vz. 30s'' were sent to reinforce Slovakia and Ruthenia where they were used to repel Hungarian and Polish border-crossers, sometimes up to a battalion in strength. They helped to screen the infantry when they had to evacuate southern Slovakia after the [[First Vienna Award]] on 2 November 1938.<ref>Kliment and Francev, pp. 31-3</ref> Ten armored cars, no longer needed once that the border areas had been annexed by Germany and Hungary, were sold to the Gendarmerie in February\u2014March 1939.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fronta.cz/obrnene-automobily-oa-vz-30-u-cetnictva|title=Obrn\u011bn\u00e9 automobily OA vz. 30 u \u010detnictva|language=Czech|accessdate=2009-05-19}}</ref> Two companies defended Carpatho-Ukraine in March 1939 from a Hungarian attack, but were forced to seek refuge in Slovakia and Romania.

One was destroyed during the [[Slovak-Hungarian War]] that began a week later.
