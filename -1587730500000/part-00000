It was first released in Japan on January 21, 1999, in North America on April 26, 1999,<ref name=\"IGNrels\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/games/super-smash-bros/n64-10494 |title=Super Smash Bros. |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc. |accessdate=September 1, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GSrel\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/super-smash-bros/ |title=Super Smash Bros. |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc. |accessdate=September 1, 2013}}</ref> and in Europe on November 19, 1999. The first game in the [[Super Smash Bros.|''Super Smash Bros.'' series]], it is a crossover between several different Nintendo franchises, including ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', ''[[Star Fox]]'', ''[[List of Yoshi video games|Yoshi]]'', ''[[Donkey Kong]]'', ''[[Metroid]]'', ''[[F-Zero]]'', ''[[Mother (video game series)|Mother]]'', ''[[Kirby (series)|Kirby]]'', and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon (video game series)|Pok\u00e9mon]]''. It presents a cast of characters and locations from these franchises and allows players to use each character's unique skills and the stage's hazards to inflict damage, recover health, and ultimately knock opponents off the stage. It did not exist for long as it's successor Super Smash Bros. Melee was released not long after\n\n''Super Smash Bros.'' received mostly positive reviews upon its release. It was a commercial success, selling over five million copies worldwide by 2001,<ref name=\"N-sider\">{{cite web|url= http://www.n-sider.com/articleview.php?articleid=120|title=Super Smash Bros.

The game spawned a series of sequels for each successive Nintendo console, starting with ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'' which was released for the [[GameCube]] in 2001.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{see also|Super Smash Bros.#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of the Super Smash Bros. series}}\n[[File:Mk stockmatch.jpg|thumb|left|Ness from ''[[EarthBound]]'' facing [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]] on the Mushroom Kingdom stage, based on the [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'']] franchise.|alt=A scenery full of platforms, blocks and fences in the style of the Super Mario Bros. video game. On a platform, a boy wearing a baseball cap throws a bolt of lightning and in another stand, a round, pink creature wearing red shoes stands still.]]\nThe ''Super Smash Bros.'' series is a departure from the general genre of fighting games; instead of depleting an opponent's life bar, ''Smash Bros.'' players seek to knock opposing characters off a stage. Each player has a damage total, represented by a percentage, which rises as the damage is taken and can reach maximum damage of 999%. As this percentage rises, the character is knocked progressively farther by attacks. To knock out (KO) an opponent, the player must send that character flying off the edge of the stage, which is not an enclosed arena but rather an area with open boundaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/howto/basic/basic01.html|title=The Basic Rules|work=Smash Bros. DOJO!! |publisher=Smashbros.com|accessdate=April 15, 2008}}</ref> When knocked off the stage, a character may use jumping moves in an attempt to return; some characters have longer-ranged jumps and may have an easier time \"recovering\" than others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/howto/basic/basic03.html|title=You Must Recover!|work=Smash Bros. DOJO!! |publisher=Smashbros.com|accessdate=April 15, 2008}}</ref> Additionally, characters have different weights, making it harder for heavier opponents to be knocked off the edge, but harder for them to recover once sent flying.\n\nWhile games such as ''[[Street Fighter]]'' and ''[[Tekken]]'' require players to memorize complicated button-input combinations, ''Super Smash Bros.'' uses the same control combinations to access all moves for all characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/160/160494p1.html|title=Super Smash Bros. review|author=Peer Schneider|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=April 27, 1999|accessdate=April 16, 2008|author-link=Peer Schneider}}</ref> Characters are additionally not limited to only facing opponents, instead being allowed to move freely. The game focuses more on aerial and platforming skills than other fighting games, with larger, more dynamic stages rather than a simple flat platform. ''Smash Bros.'' also implements blocking and dodging mechanics. Grabbing and throwing other characters is also possible.\n\nVarious weapons and power-ups can be used in battle to inflict damage, recover health, or dispense additional items. They fall randomly onto the stage in the form of items from Nintendo franchises, such as Koopa shells, hammers, and Pok\u00e9 Balls.<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318161642/http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/characters/index.html|archivedate=March 18, 2008|url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/characters/index.html|title=Smash Bros. DOJO!!}}</ref> The nine multiplayer stages are locations taken from or in the style of Nintendo franchises, such as Planet Zebes from ''[[Metroid (series)|Metroid]]'' and Sector Z from ''[[Star Fox (series)|Star Fox]]''. Although stages are rendered in three dimensions, players move within a two-dimensional plane. Stages are dynamic, ranging from simple moving platforms to dramatic alterations of the entire stage. Each stage offers unique gameplay and strategic motives, making the chosen stage an additional factor in the fight.\n \t\nIn the game's [[Single-player video game|single-player]] mode, the player battles a series of [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|computer-controlled]] opponents in a specific order, attempting to defeat them with a limited number of lives in a limited amount of time. While the player can determine the [[Balance (game design)#Difficulty level|difficulty level]] and the number of lives, the series of opponents never changes. If the player loses all of their lives or runs out of time, they can continue at the cost of a loss of overall points. This mode is referred to as Classic Mode in sequels.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/various/various11.html| title=Classic| publisher=Smashbros.com| first=Masahiro| last=Sakurai| date=October 30, 2007| access-date=June 1, 2008| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430210522/http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/various/various11.html| archive-date=April 30, 2008| df=mdy-all}}</ref> The single-player mode also includes two minigames, \"Break the Targets\" and \"Board the Platforms\", in which the objective is to break each target or board multiple special platforms, respectively. A \"Training Mode\" is also available in which players can manipulate the environment and experiment against computer opponents without the restrictions of a standard match.\n\nUp to four people can play in [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode, which has specific rules predetermined by the players. Stock and timed matches are two of the multiplayer modes of play.<ref name=Spot/> This gives each player a certain number of lives or a selected time limit, before beginning the match. Free for all or team battles are also a choice during matches using stock or time. A winner is declared once time runs out, or if all players except one or a team have lost all of their lives. A multiplayer game may also end in a tie if two or more players have the same score when the timer expires, which causes the round to end in [[sudden death (sport)|sudden death]]. During sudden death, all fighters are given 300% damage and the last fighter standing will win the match.\n\n==Characters==\n{{see also|Characters in the Super Smash Bros. series}}\nThe game includes twelve playable characters from popular Nintendo franchises.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/16387/page_3.html |title=Guides: Super Smash Bros.

[[Masahiro Sakurai]] was interested in making a fighting game for four players. As he did not yet have any original ideas, his first designs were of simple base characters. He made a presentation of what was then called ''Kakuto-Geemu Ryuoh'' (''Dragon King: The Fighting Game'')<ref name=\"Hobby\"/> to co-worker [[Satoru Iwata]], who helped him continue. Sakurai understood that many fighting games did not sell well and that he had to think of a way to make his game original.<ref name= Hobby/> His first idea was to include famous Nintendo characters and put them in a fight.<ref name=\"Hobby\"/> Knowing he would not get permission, Sakurai made a prototype of the game without sanction from Nintendo and did not inform them until he was sure the game was well-balanced.<ref name=\"Hobby\"/> The prototype he presented featured [[Mario]], [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]], [[Samus Aran|Samus]] and [[Fox McCloud|Fox]] as playable characters.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=2008 |title= The Man who made Mario fight|journal=[[Hobby Consoles]] |volume= |issue=202 |pages=22 |url= |doi= }}</ref>  The idea was later approved.<ref name=\"Hobby\">{{cite web|url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/ssbb/6/0|title=Iwata Asks: Super Smash Bros.

Each player has a damage total, represented by a percentage, which rises as the damage is taken and can reach maximum damage of 999%. As this percentage rises, the character is knocked progressively farther by attacks. To knock out (KO) an opponent, the player must send that character flying off the edge of the stage, which is not an enclosed arena but rather an area with open boundaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/howto/basic/basic01.html|title=The Basic Rules|work=Smash Bros.

The game focuses more on aerial and platforming skills than other fighting games, with larger, more dynamic stages rather than a simple flat platform. ''Smash Bros.'' also implements blocking and dodging mechanics. Grabbing and throwing other characters is also possible.\n\nVarious weapons and power-ups can be used in battle to inflict damage, recover health, or dispense additional items. They fall randomly onto the stage in the form of items from Nintendo franchises, such as Koopa shells, hammers, and Pok\u00e9 Balls.<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318161642/http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/characters/index.html|archivedate=March 18, 2008|url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/characters/index.html|title=Smash Bros. DOJO!!}}</ref> The nine multiplayer stages are locations taken from or in the style of Nintendo franchises, such as Planet Zebes from ''[[Metroid (series)|Metroid]]'' and Sector Z from ''[[Star Fox (series)|Star Fox]]''. Although stages are rendered in three dimensions, players move within a two-dimensional plane. Stages are dynamic, ranging from simple moving platforms to dramatic alterations of the entire stage. Each stage offers unique gameplay and strategic motives, making the chosen stage an additional factor in the fight.\n \t\nIn the game's [[Single-player video game|single-player]] mode, the player battles a series of [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|computer-controlled]] opponents in a specific order, attempting to defeat them with a limited number of lives in a limited amount of time. While the player can determine the [[Balance (game design)#Difficulty level|difficulty level]] and the number of lives, the series of opponents never changes. If the player loses all of their lives or runs out of time, they can continue at the cost of a loss of overall points. This mode is referred to as Classic Mode in sequels.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/various/various11.html| title=Classic| publisher=Smashbros.com| first=Masahiro| last=Sakurai| date=October 30, 2007| access-date=June 1, 2008| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430210522/http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/various/various11.html| archive-date=April 30, 2008| df=mdy-all}}</ref> The single-player mode also includes two minigames, \"Break the Targets\" and \"Board the Platforms\", in which the objective is to break each target or board multiple special platforms, respectively. A \"Training Mode\" is also available in which players can manipulate the environment and experiment against computer opponents without the restrictions of a standard match.\n\nUp to four people can play in [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode, which has specific rules predetermined by the players. Stock and timed matches are two of the multiplayer modes of play.<ref name=Spot/> This gives each player a certain number of lives or a selected time limit, before beginning the match. Free for all or team battles are also a choice during matches using stock or time. A winner is declared once time runs out, or if all players except one or a team have lost all of their lives. A multiplayer game may also end in a tie if two or more players have the same score when the timer expires, which causes the round to end in [[sudden death (sport)|sudden death]]. During sudden death, all fighters are given 300% damage and the last fighter standing will win the match.\n\n==Characters==\n{{see also|Characters in the Super Smash Bros. series}}\nThe game includes twelve playable characters from popular Nintendo franchises.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/16387/page_3.html |title=Guides: Super Smash Bros.

Sakurai understood that many fighting games did not sell well and that he had to think of a way to make his game original.<ref name= Hobby/> His first idea was to include famous Nintendo characters and put them in a fight.<ref name=\"Hobby\"/> Knowing he would not get permission, Sakurai made a prototype of the game without sanction from Nintendo and did not inform them until he was sure the game was well-balanced.<ref name=\"Hobby\"/> The prototype he presented featured [[Mario]], [[Donkey Kong (character)|Donkey Kong]], [[Samus Aran|Samus]] and [[Fox McCloud|Fox]] as playable characters.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=2008 |title= The Man who made Mario fight|journal=[[Hobby Consoles]] |volume= |issue=202 |pages=22 |url= |doi= }}</ref>  The idea was later approved.<ref name=\"Hobby\">{{cite web|url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/ssbb/6/0|title=Iwata Asks: Super Smash Bros.
