offensive ways of describing [[COVID-19]]. These terms are linked to [[Wuhan]], where the virus was first detected, or China in general, via [[portmanteau]] with terms from traditional [[Chinese Martial Arts]], ''Wushu'' and ''Kung Fu''. Use of these terms (popularised in social media and [[alt-right]] sources) not only downplays the seriousness of the deadly disease but also misinforms by suggesting it is a strain of [[influenza]] (when it is ''not'' a [[flu]]), while simultaneously mocking Chinese culture. It also implies that the pandemic is China's aggressive gift to the world, when actually thousands of Chinese suffered and died from COVID-19, especially in Wuhan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-coronavirus-china-virus-white-house-kung-flu|title=Trump doubles down on 'China virus', demands to know who in White House used phrase 'Kung Flu'|date=2020-03-18|website=Fox News|language=en|access-date=2020-03-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329102358/https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-coronavirus-china-virus-white-house-kung-flu|archive-date=29 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2020/03/19/a-last-desperate-pivot-trump-and-his-allies-go-full-racist-on-coronavirus/|title=A last, desperate pivot: Trump and his allies go full racist on coronavirus|date=2020-03-19|website=Salon|language=en|access-date=2020-03-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329202750/https://www.salon.com/2020/03/19/a-last-desperate-pivot-trump-and-his-allies-go-full-racist-on-coronavirus/|archive-date=29 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Misinformation===\n{{main|Misinformation related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n\nThe disease does not spread by shop items that have the name of \"Corona\" on them and products from China are not necessarily at risk of giving the disease either.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/01/30/coronavirus-is-not-the-corona-beer-virus-what-people-are-googling/|title=Coronavirus Is Not The 'Corona Beer Virus', What People Are Googling|last=Lee|first=Bruce Y.|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200316122432/https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/01/30/coronavirus-is-not-the-corona-beer-virus-what-people-are-googling/|archive-date=16 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/can-i-get-coronavirus-from-a-package-being-delivered-from-china|title=Can I get coronavirus from a package delivered from China?|date=2020-02-26|website=Daily Breeze|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n\n==Research==\n\nBecause of its key role in the transmission and progression of SARS-CoV-2, [[Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2|ACE2]] has been the focus of a significant proportion of research and various [[Therapy|therapeutic]] approaches have been suggested.<ref name=\"Xu Zhong Deng Peng p.\"/> Personal hygiene, and a healthy lifestyle and [[Healthy diet|diet]] have been recommended to improve immunity.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Li-sheng |last2=Wang |first2=Yi-ru |last3=Ye |first3=Da-wei |last4=Liu |first4=Qing-quan |title=A review of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) based on current evidence |journal=International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents |date=19 March 2020 |page=105948 |doi=10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105948 |pmid=32201353 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300984 |accessdate=27 March 2020 |language=en |issn=0924-8579 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200327232545/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300984 |archive-date=27 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn order to improve and accelerate the exchange of data among researchers globally, the [[European Bioinformatics Institute]] has started developing the European COVID-19 Data Platform. Understanding the biology, epidemiology, transmission, and evolution of the virus puts the scientific community one step closer to creating diagnostics, therapeutics, and effective vaccines. One of the greatest challenges at this stage is finding ways to rapidly access and share data and results. The European COVID-19 Data Platform aims to address this challenge by providing an open, trusted, and scalable platform where researchers can store and share relevant datasets. It will also create a shared computational space where scientists and public health workers can collaborate. The European COVID-19 Data Platform consists of two connected components: SARS-CoV-2 Data Hubs, which will organise the flow of sequence data from the outbreak and provide comprehensive open data sharing for the European and global research communities and COVID-19 Portal, which will bring together and continuously update relevant COVID-19 datasets and tools.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.embl.org/news/lab-matters/corona-updates/|title=EMBL\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.embl.org/news/science/embl-ebi-leads-international-collaboration-to-share-covid-19-research-data/?_ga=2.135566577.1552695299.1585763730-859685221.1575360586|title=EMBL-EBI leads International collaboration to share COVID-19 research data}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/pathogens/covid-19|title=EMBL-EBI COVID-19 Data Platform}}</ref>\n\n===Vaccine===\n\n{{main|COVID-19 vaccine}}\n\nThere is no available vaccine, but research into developing a vaccine has been undertaken by various agencies.

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination). Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies would have to be tested for safety and efficacy.<ref name=\"Chen Strych Hotez Bottazzi p.\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen WH, Strych U, Hotez PJ, Bottazzi ME | title=The SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Pipeline: an Overview | journal=Current Tropical Medicine Reports | date=3 March 2020 | pages=1\u20134 |doi=10.1007/s40475-020-00201-6 |doi-access=free | pmid=32219057 | pmc=7094941 | name-list-format = vanc}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in [[Seattle]].

Understanding the biology, epidemiology, transmission, and evolution of the virus puts the scientific community one step closer to creating diagnostics, therapeutics, and effective vaccines. One of the greatest challenges at this stage is finding ways to rapidly access and share data and results. The European COVID-19 Data Platform aims to address this challenge by providing an open, trusted, and scalable platform where researchers can store and share relevant datasets. It will also create a shared computational space where scientists and public health workers can collaborate. The European COVID-19 Data Platform consists of two connected components: SARS-CoV-2 Data Hubs, which will organise the flow of sequence data from the outbreak and provide comprehensive open data sharing for the European and global research communities and COVID-19 Portal, which will bring together and continuously update relevant COVID-19 datasets and tools.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.embl.org/news/lab-matters/corona-updates/|title=EMBL\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.embl.org/news/science/embl-ebi-leads-international-collaboration-to-share-covid-19-research-data/?_ga=2.135566577.1552695299.1585763730-859685221.1575360586|title=EMBL-EBI leads International collaboration to share COVID-19 research data}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/pathogens/covid-19|title=EMBL-EBI COVID-19 Data Platform}}</ref>\n\n===Vaccine===\n\n{{main|COVID-19 vaccine}}\n\nThere is no available vaccine, but research into developing a vaccine has been undertaken by various agencies.

The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

Qalats can be quickly constructed over the course of a single season, and they can be extremely large, sometimes covering several acres. Towers may be placed at the corners or points along the walls to create a more defensible position, but most qala compounds consist only of the walls.\n\nWhile the foundation of a qala compound may be stone or fired brick, the walls are typically dried mud. Walls are created by laying down a row of adobe bricks with [[Mortar (masonry)#Ancient mortar|mud mortar]] along the entire length of the wall.  By the time that the mason returns to the point of origin, the mortar is dry and the next row can be added on top of the old. Using this technique walls dozens of feet high can be built very rapidly.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Kennedy, Hugh N.

Qalats can be quickly constructed over the course of a single season, and they can be extremely large, sometimes covering several acres. Towers may be placed at the corners or points along the walls to create a more defensible position, but most qala compounds consist only of the walls.\n\nWhile the foundation of a qala compound may be stone or fired brick, the walls are typically dried mud. Walls are created by laying down a row of adobe bricks with [[Mortar (masonry)#Ancient mortar|mud mortar]] along the entire length of the wall.  By the time that the mason returns to the point of origin, the mortar is dry and the next row can be added on top of the old. Using this technique walls dozens of feet high can be built very rapidly.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Kennedy, Hugh N.

In 1997, when Crisp disbanded, she released her debut [[studio album]] titled ''OnlySee'' in Australia. She moved to London, England, and provided lead vocals for the British duo [[Zero 7]]. In 2000, Sia released her second studio album, ''[[Healing Is Difficult]]'', and her third studio album, ''[[Colour the Small One]]'', in 2004, but all of these struggled to connect with a mainstream audience.\n\nSia relocated to New York City in 2005 and toured in the United States. Her fourth and fifth studio albums, ''[[Some People Have Real Problems]]'' and ''[[We Are Born]]'', were released in 2008 and 2010, respectively. Each was certified gold by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] and attracted wider notice than her earlier albums. Uncomfortable with her growing fame, Sia took a hiatus from performing, during which she focused on songwriting for other artists, producing successful collaborations \"[[Titanium (song)|Titanium]]\" (with [[David Guetta]]) which top UK charts stepping her into fame, \"[[Diamonds (Rihanna song)|Diamonds]]\" (with [[Rihanna]]) and \"[[Wild Ones (song)|Wild Ones]]\" (with [[Flo Rida]]).\n\nIn 2014, Sia broke through as a solo recording artist when her sixth studio album, ''[[1000 Forms of Fear]]'', debuted at No 1 in the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and generated the top-ten single \"[[Chandelier (song)|Chandelier]]\" which also won the International song of the year award presented by NRJ Music Awards and a trilogy of music videos starring child dancer [[Maddie Ziegler]]. Since then, Sia has usually worn a wig that obscures her face to protect her privacy.<ref name=Age/> Her seventh studio album ''[[This Is Acting]]'' (2016), spawned her first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number one single, \"[[Cheap Thrills (song)|Cheap Thrills]]\" and is the first woman artist to top the Billboard hot 100 after 40 yrs of age since Madonna sent her song \"Music\" back in 2000 .The same year, Sia gave her [[Nostalgic for the Present Tour]], which incorporated dancing by Ziegler and others and other performance art elements. Her eighth studio album, ''[[Everyday Is Christmas (album)|Everyday Is Christmas]]'', was released in 2017 and [[reissue]]d in 2018 with three bonus tracks. In 2018 and 2019 she collaborated with [[Labrinth]] and [[Diplo]] in the group [[LSD (group)|LSD]], and they released their [[LSD (album)|self-titled debut album]] in April 2019.

In 1997, when Crisp disbanded, she released her debut [[studio album]] titled ''OnlySee'' in Australia. She moved to London, England, and provided lead vocals for the British duo [[Zero 7]]. In 2000, Sia released her second studio album, ''[[Healing Is Difficult]]'', and her third studio album, ''[[Colour the Small One]]'', in 2004, but all of these struggled to connect with a mainstream audience.\n\nSia relocated to New York City in 2005 and toured in the United States. Her fourth and fifth studio albums, ''[[Some People Have Real Problems]]'' and ''[[We Are Born]]'', were released in 2008 and 2010, respectively. Each was certified gold by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] and attracted wider notice than her earlier albums. Uncomfortable with her growing fame, Sia took a hiatus from performing, during which she focused on songwriting for other artists, producing successful collaborations \"[[Titanium (song)|Titanium]]\" (with [[David Guetta]]) which top UK charts stepping her into fame, \"[[Diamonds (Rihanna song)|Diamonds]]\" (with [[Rihanna]]) and \"[[Wild Ones (song)|Wild Ones]]\" (with [[Flo Rida]]).\n\nIn 2014, Sia broke through as a solo recording artist when her sixth studio album, ''[[1000 Forms of Fear]]'', debuted at No 1 in the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and generated the top-ten single \"[[Chandelier (song)|Chandelier]]\" which also won the International song of the year award presented by NRJ Music Awards and a trilogy of music videos starring child dancer [[Maddie Ziegler]]. Since then, Sia has usually worn a wig that obscures her face to protect her privacy.<ref name=Age/> Her seventh studio album ''[[This Is Acting]]'' (2016), spawned her first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number one single, \"[[Cheap Thrills (song)|Cheap Thrills]]\" and is the first woman artist to top the Billboard hot 100 after 40 yrs of age since madonna sent her song \"Music\" back in 2000 .The same year, Sia gave her [[Nostalgic for the Present Tour]], which incorporated dancing by Ziegler and others and other performance art elements. Her eighth studio album, ''[[Everyday Is Christmas (album)|Everyday Is Christmas]]'', was released in 2017 and [[reissue]]d in 2018 with three bonus tracks.

Its western border is the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; it shares land borders with [[Zambia]] and [[Angola]] to the north, [[Botswana]] to the east and [[South Africa]] to the south and east. Although [[Kazungula|it does not]] border [[Zimbabwe]], less than 200 metres of the [[Zambezi|Zambezi River]] separates the two countries. Namibia gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990, following the [[Namibian War of Independence]]. Its capital and largest city is [[Windhoek]], and it is a member state of the [[United Nations]] (UN), the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC), the [[African Union]] (AU), and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. \n\nNamibia, the driest country in Sub-Saharan Africa,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/23/world/africa/namibia-eye-on-country-profile/index.html |title=Namibia country profile: moving on from a difficult past |author=Peter Shadbolt |website=CNN |date=24 October 2012}}</ref> was inhabited since early times by the [[San people|San]], [[Damara people|Damara]] and [[Nama people|Nama]] people. Around the 14th century, [[immigrating]] [[Bantu peoples]] arrived as part of the [[Bantu expansion]]. Since then, the Bantu groups, the largest being the [[Ovambo people|Ovambo]], have dominated the population of the country; since the late 19th century, they have constituted a majority.\n\nIn 1878, the [[Cape Colony|Cape of Good Hope]], then a British colony, annexed the port of [[Walvis Bay]] and the offshore [[Penguin Islands]]; these became an integral part of the new [[Union of South Africa]] at its creation in 1910. In 1884 the [[German Empire]] established rule over most of the territory, forming a colony known as [[German South West Africa]]. It developed farming and infrastructure. Between 1904 and 1908 it perpetrated a [[Herero and Namaqua genocide|genocide]] against the Herero and Nama people. German rule ended in 1915 with a defeat by South African forces. In 1920, after the end of [[World War I]], the [[League of Nations]] [[League of Nations mandate|mandated]] the administration of the colony to South Africa. It imposed its laws, including racial classifications and rules. From 1948, with the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] elected to power, South Africa applied [[apartheid]] also to what was then known as [[South West Africa]].\n\nIn the later 20th century, uprisings and demands for political representation by native African political activists seeking independence resulted in the UN assuming direct responsibility over the territory in 1966, but South Africa maintained ''de facto'' rule. In 1973 the UN recognised the South West Africa People's Organisation ([[SWAPO]]) as the official representative of the Namibian people; the party is dominated by the Ovambo, who are a large plurality in the territory. Following continued guerrilla warfare, South Africa installed an interim administration in Namibia in 1985. Namibia obtained full independence from South Africa in 1990. However, [[Walvis Bay]] and the [[Penguin Islands]] remained under South African control until 1994.\n\nNamibia has a population of 2.6&nbsp;million people and a stable [[multi-party system|multi-party]] [[parliamentary democracy]]. Agriculture, [[herding]], [[Tourism in Namibia|tourism]] and the [[Mineral industry of Namibia|mining industry]]&nbsp;\u2013 including mining for gem diamonds, [[Uranium mining|uranium]], [[Gold mining|gold]], [[Silver mining|silver]], and [[base metal]]s&nbsp;\u2013 form the basis of its [[Economy of Namibia|economy]]. The large, arid [[Namib Desert]] has resulted in Namibia being overall one of the [[List of countries and territories by population density|least densely populated]] countries in the world.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name of the country is derived from the [[Namib Desert]], the oldest desert in the world.<ref name=at1315>Spriggs, A. (2001) {{WWF ecoregion|name=Africa: Namibia|id=at1315}}</ref> The name ''Namib'' itself is of [[nama language|Nama]] origin and means \"vast place\". Before its independence in 1990, the area was known first as [[German South-West Africa]] (''Deutsch-S\u00fcdwestafrika''), then as South-West Africa, reflecting the colonial occupation by the Germans and the South Africans.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Namibia}}\n\n===Pre-colonial period===\n[[File:Buschmannkinder.jpg|thumb|[[San people]] are Namibia's oldest [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|indigenous]] inhabitants.]]\nThe dry lands of Namibia have been inhabited since early times by San, Damara, and Nama.

The Nama-Herero War broke out in 1880, with hostilities ebbing only after the [[German Empire]] deployed troops to the contested places and cemented the status quo among the Nama, Oorlam, and Herero.{{sfn|Vedder|1997|p=659}}\n\nThe first Europeans to disembark and explore the region were the Portuguese navigators [[Diogo C\u00e3o]] in 1485 and [[Bartolomeu Dias]] in 1486, but the Portuguese did not try to claim the area. Like most of interior [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], Namibia was not extensively explored by Europeans until the 19th century. At that time traders and settlers came principally from Germany and Sweden. In the late 19th century, [[Dorsland Trek]]kers crossed the area on their way from the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] to [[Angola]]. Some of them settled in Namibia instead of continuing their journey.\n\n===German rule===\n{{see also|German South West Africa|Herero and Namaqua genocide}}\n[[File:Kirche denkmal nam.jpg|thumb|German church and monument to colonists in Windhoek, Namibia.]]\nNamibia became a German colony in 1884 under [[Otto von Bismarck]] to forestall perceived British encroachment and was known as [[German South West Africa]] (''Deutsch-S\u00fcdwestafrika'').<ref>{{cite web|title=German South West Africa|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9036573/German-South-West-Africa|accessdate=15 April 2008}}</ref> The [[Palgrave Commission]] by the British governor in Cape Town determined that only the natural deep-water harbour of [[Walvis Bay]] was worth occupying and thus annexed it to the Cape province of British South Africa.\n\nFrom 1904 to 1907, the [[Herero people|Herero]] and the [[Nama people|Namaqua]] [[Herero Wars|took up arms]] against brutal German colonialism.

Otherwise, surface water is restricted to a few large storage dams retaining and damming up these seasonal floods and their runoff.

Around the 14th century, [[immigrating]] [[Bantu peoples]] arrived as part of the [[Bantu expansion]]. Since then, the Bantu groups, the largest being the [[Ovambo people|Ovambo]], have dominated the population of the country; since the late 19th century, they have constituted a majority.\n\nIn 1878, the [[Cape Colony|Cape of Good Hope]], then a British colony, annexed the port of [[Walvis Bay]] and the offshore [[Penguin Islands]]; these became an integral part of the new [[Union of South Africa]] at its creation in 1910. In 1884 the [[German Empire]] established rule over most of the territory, forming a colony known as [[German South West Africa]]. It developed farming and infrastructure. Between 1904 and 1908 it perpetrated a [[Herero and Namaqua genocide|genocide]] against the Herero and Nama people. German rule ended in 1915 with a defeat by South African forces. In 1920, after the end of [[World War I]], the [[League of Nations]] [[League of Nations mandate|mandated]] the administration of the colony to South Africa. It imposed its laws, including racial classifications and rules. From 1948, with the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] elected to power, South Africa applied [[apartheid]] also to what was then known as [[South West Africa]].\n\nIn the later 20th century, uprisings and demands for political representation by native African political activists seeking independence resulted in the UN assuming direct responsibility over the territory in 1966, but South Africa maintained ''de facto'' rule. In 1973 the UN recognised the South West Africa People's Organisation ([[SWAPO]]) as the official representative of the Namibian people; the party is dominated by the Ovambo, who are a large plurality in the territory. Following continued guerrilla warfare, South Africa installed an interim administration in Namibia in 1985. Namibia obtained full independence from South Africa in 1990. However, [[Walvis Bay]] and the [[Penguin Islands]] remained under South African control until 1994.\n\nNamibia has a population of 2.6&nbsp;million people and a stable [[multi-party system|multi-party]] [[parliamentary democracy]]. Agriculture, [[herding]], [[Tourism in Namibia|tourism]] and the [[Mineral industry of Namibia|mining industry]]&nbsp;\u2013 including mining for gem diamonds, [[Uranium mining|uranium]], [[Gold mining|gold]], [[Silver mining|silver]], and [[base metal]]s&nbsp;\u2013 form the basis of its [[Economy of Namibia|economy]]. The large, arid [[Namib Desert]] has resulted in Namibia being overall one of the [[List of countries and territories by population density|least densely populated]] countries in the world.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name of the country is derived from the [[Namib Desert]], the oldest desert in the world.<ref name=at1315>Spriggs, A. (2001) {{WWF ecoregion|name=Africa: Namibia|id=at1315}}</ref> The name ''Namib'' itself is of [[nama language|Nama]] origin and means \"vast place\". Before its independence in 1990, the area was known first as [[German South-West Africa]] (''Deutsch-S\u00fcdwestafrika''), then as South-West Africa, reflecting the colonial occupation by the Germans and the South Africans.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Namibia}}\n\n===Pre-colonial period===\n[[File:Buschmannkinder.jpg|thumb|[[San people]] are Namibia's oldest [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|indigenous]] inhabitants.]]\nThe dry lands of Namibia have been inhabited since early times by San, Damara, and Nama.

The Nama-Herero War broke out in 1880, with hostilities ebbing only after the [[German Empire]] deployed troops to the contested places and cemented the status quo among the Nama, Oorlam, and Herero.{{sfn|Vedder|1997|p=659}}\n\nThe first Europeans to disembark and explore the region were the Portuguese navigators [[Diogo C\u00e3o]] in 1485 and [[Bartolomeu Dias]] in 1486, but the Portuguese did not try to claim the area. Like most of interior [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], Namibia was not extensively explored by Europeans until the 19th century. At that time traders and settlers came principally from Germany and Sweden. In the late 19th century, [[Dorsland Trek]]kers crossed the area on their way from the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] to [[Angola]]. Some of them settled in Namibia instead of continuing their journey.\n\n===German rule===\n{{see also|German South West Africa|Herero and Namaqua genocide}}\n[[File:Kirche denkmal nam.jpg|thumb|German church and monument to colonists in Windhoek, Namibia.]]\nNamibia became a German colony in 1884 under [[Otto von Bismarck]] to forestall perceived British encroachment and was known as [[German South West Africa]] (''Deutsch-S\u00fcdwestafrika'').<ref>{{cite web|title=German South West Africa|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9036573/German-South-West-Africa|accessdate=15 April 2008}}</ref> The [[Palgrave Commission]] by the British governor in Cape Town determined that only the natural deep-water harbour of [[Walvis Bay]] was worth occupying and thus annexed it to the Cape province of British South Africa.\n\nFrom 1904 to 1907, the [[Herero people|Herero]] and the [[Nama people|Namaqua]] [[Herero Wars|took up arms]] against brutal German colonialism.

Otherwise, surface water is restricted to a few large storage dams retaining and damming up these seasonal floods and their runoff. Where people do not live near perennial rivers or make use of the storage dams, they are dependent on groundwater. Even isolated communities and those economic activities located far from good surface water sources, such as mining, agriculture, and tourism, can be supplied from groundwater over nearly 80% of the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iwrm-namibia.info.na/iwrm/fundaments-in-iwrm/groundwater-in-namibia/index.php |title=Groundwater in Namibia |website=Integrated Water Resource Management |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729155617/http://www.iwrm-namibia.info.na/iwrm/fundaments-in-iwrm/groundwater-in-namibia/index.php |archive-date=29 July 2016 }}</ref>\n\nMore than 100,000 [[borehole]]s have been drilled in Namibia over the past century.
