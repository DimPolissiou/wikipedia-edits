By 1985 Inosanto's father would venture on his own and establish the Inosanto Academy of Martial Arts in the Marina del Rey, California \n\nGrowing up surrounded by the martial arts world, she studied many forms including [[Jeet Kune Do]] and [[Eskrima|Filipino Martial Arts]] which she learned from her father, Dan Inosanto and his instructors under him, (Dan Inosanto is the world's leading authority in [[Jeet Kune Do]] under founder [[Bruce Lee]], Diana Lee Inosanto's first godfather).<ref>''Bruce Lee - Die Faust Hollywoods'', documentary by Annette Baumeister in the series ''Too Young To Die'', [[ZDF]] / [[Arte]], Germany 2015</ref>  She was exposed to Asian and European weaponry and empty hand systems that included  Filipino Kali &[[Eskrima]], and [[Jeet Kune Do]], but [[Muay Thai]], Indonesian [[Silat]], French [[Savate]], [[Shoot wrestling]], European '''[[sabre]]''' '''[[sword]]'''  play and [[Chinese martial arts#Wushu|Wushu]]. \n\nShe has appeared on the cover of numerous martial arts magazines including ''[[Black Belt Magazine]]'', ''Martial Arts Illustrated'', ''Inside Karate'', ''Self Defense'' and ''Inside Kung Fu''.  Diana Lee Inosanto was named Woman of the year by ''Black Belt Magazine'' in 2009.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n== The Early Years and Struggles in Hollywood ==\nWhen it came to the performing arts, Diana began learning dance under the encouragement of her mother, and drama under the guidance of her aunt, Asian American actress Lilia Inosanto, also known as Lona Nai. \u00a0 She would later participate in high school plays at Narbonne High School. \u00a0Upon graduation, her Aunt Lilia guided Diana to study with famed Broadway casting director and acting teacher, the late [[Michael Shurtleff]], author of the renowned book \u2018Audition\u2019 a bible for aspiring actors. \u00a0 Years later, she would go on to study with Asian American character actor, [[Tzi Ma]] through East West Players workshops and joined Lodestone Theater Ensemble, continuing to grow as an actress, participating in everything from Shakespeare to contemporary plays. \u00a0She also explored the Michael Chekhov method with acting coach, [[Lisa Dalton]].\n\nWhile pursuing a professional career in acting in the 1990s, Diana discovered that the Hollywood system lacked opportunities in diversity and that roles that casted for ethnically ambiguous types like herself were rare. Even more challenging, she had an early marriage that ended in divorce after three years.  She also found herself a single mother of a son with [[Autism spectrum|autism]] and assumed she would have to quit Hollywood and find a traditional line of work to better care for her son. \u00a0\n\nIn 1994, Diana met [[Ron Balicki]], a former Cooke County Deputy Sheriff and long time martial arts student and instructor under her father.  Formally from Chicago, Illinois, Ron Balicki moved to Los Angeles to manage the Inosanto Academy of Martial Arts and establish himself as a stuntman, fight trainer, choreographer and stunt coordinator.  \n\nOn December 6th, 1995 they were married.  By 1996, they would establish an organization called Martial Arts Research Systems, also known as MARS or MARS Action Group, teaching people from different walks of life: civilians, military, police and even Hollywood actors and stunt performers looking to expand their physical expression on camera.  Together, they would progressively build together a martial arts seminar circuit teaching students in the United States, Canada, Australia, China and Europe.  By 2003, they had a son together.\n\n==Film and TV career==\nBecause of Inosanto\u2019s martial arts ability, she was spotted by the producers of Barb Wire who saw her demonstrating a fight scene with [[Ron Balicki]]  who had been training New Zealand actor, [[Temuera Morrison]]. \u00a0She was asked \u00a0to be included in the fight scene with Morrison (a stunt acting role that was originally written for a man.) \u00a0Thereafter, she was immediately recommended to be the martial arts stunt double for Daytime Emmy Award winning actress, [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] for the presentation to pitch ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' as a TV Show, directed by [[Joss Whedon]]. \u00a0This would be the beginning of Diana\u2019s years as a stuntwoman in Hollywood where she found success working on popular film and TV shows. \n\nBut eventually she tired of this kind of work and took \u00a0inspiration from other notable Indie filmmakers and writers like Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino, Kevin Smith and Jon Favreau. She decided to seize control to create her own film projects. \u00a0Making the most of her stunt work, Inosanto learned about the filming process by watching and absorbing while on set the craft of filmmaking from such A-list directors, like Ang Lee, John Woo, Barry Sonnenfeld, Chris Columbus and Dean Devlin.\n\nBy 2010, Inosanto\u2019s first Indie film, [[The Sensei]], a film that she wrote, directed, and starred in, would be one of the earliest digitally released films distributed on Netflix and I-Tunes. \u00a0Filmed on a small budget, The Sensei was a film that takes place in the 1980s. \u00a0It tells a story about a gay teenager being bullied in a rural town during the height of the AIDS epidemic in middle America. The character McClain is befriended by a female martial arts teacher (Inosanto) who teaches him to defend himself and more important, self-acceptance. \n\nAlarmed by the brutality of the [[Matthew Shepard]] case, the high suicide rate among gay teenagers, and the personal stories of struggling martial school owners who were conflicted about allowing gay students in their schools and retaliation from the communities that they served, these events had a profound impact on Inosanto writing \u201cThe Sensei\u201d. \u00a0Considered controversial for its time in the martial arts world, Inosanto would go on to win awards and accolades at film festivals like LA Femme International Film Fest, Hoboken International Film Festival, Philadelphia Asian American Film Fest, \n\nSan Francisco's Frameline, Germany's Verzaubert Film Festival, New York's Newfest and the Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival where she had her world premiere at the Directors Guild of America. \u00a0\n\nIn addition, Inosanto also had the support of the Matthew Shepard Foundation. \u00a0In fact, so powerful was her message about on \u201cThe Sensei\u201d that the Asian American Justice Center presented Ms. Inosanto with the 2011 American Courage Award, in Washington, D.C. where members of Congress and humanitarian activists were present, to honor her bravery and dedication to the cause of civil rights and use of incredible creative aptitude to deliver the message of advancing social justice.\n\nBy 2011, Diana Lee Inosanto became the first woman to receive the Maverick Award at the AOF International Film Festival.\n\nIn 2012, she appears in the film ''[[I Am Bruce Lee]]''\u00a0 along with her father about being a firsthand witness to the impact the late Bruce Lee had around the world and the close friendship her father had with his late close friend and teacher.\n\n===Movies and television work includes===\n[[File:Diana Lee Inosanto on the beach.jpg|thumb|On the beach, 2004.]]\n* [[Spy (2015 film)|Spy]] (2015) (Martial Arts Trainer - [[Melissa McCarthy]])\n* \"[[I, Frankenstein]]\" (2014) (Martial Arts Trainer - [[Aaron Eckhart]] / Socratis Otto)\n* \"[[Sinners and Saints (2010 film)|Sinners and Saints]]\" (2010) (Co-Producer / Assistant Stunt Coordinator)\n* \"[[The Sensei]]\" (2008) (Director) (Producer) (Actress)\n* \"[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]\" (2006) (Actress)\n* \"[[Rent (film)|Rent]]\" (2005) (Actress)\n* \"The Prodigy\" (2006) (Actress) (Associate Producer)\n* \"The Vault\" (2005) (Actress)\n* \"[[Resident Evil: Apocalypse]]\" (2004) (Fight Choreography)\n* \"[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]\"  (2003) (2004) (2005) TV Series (Stunts)\n* \"Hulk\" (2003) (Actress)\n* \"Fist of Cheese\" (2004) TV Series (Assistant Stunt Coordinator) (Associate Producer)\n* \"The Time Machine\" (2002) (Actress)\n* \"On Sundays \" - (Co Producer) (2002)\n* \"A Ribbon of Dreams\" (2002) (Associate Producer)\n* \"Life Streams\" (2000) (Actress) (Co Producer)\n* \"Modern Warriors\" (2000) Herself\n* \"Blade\" (2000) (Stunts)\n* \"Mystery Men\" (1999) (Stunts)\n* \"Wild Wild West\" (1999) (Stunts)\n* \"Red Corner\" (1999) (Stunts)\n* \"The Patriot\" (1998) (Stunts)\n* \"Face/Off\" (1997) (Stunts)\n* \"The Roseanne Show\" (1998) TV Series (Stunt Actress)\n* \"[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]\" (1996) TV Series (Stunts)\n* \"Spy Game\" (1997) TV Series (Stunts)\n* \"[[Barb Wire]]\" (1996) (Stunts)\n* \"MTV New Edition Music Video \"Hit Me Off\" - (Stunts) (1996)\n* \"10-8: Officers on Duty\" (2003) TV Series (Stunts)\n* \"Black Scorpion\" (1999) (Stunts)\n* \"MADtv\" (2001) (Actress)\n* \"[[The Last Man on Planet Earth]]\" (1999) (Stunts)\n* \"Team Knight Rider\" (1998) (Actress)\n* \"Walker, Texas Ranger\" (1998) (Stunts)\n* \"Moonlighting\" (1988) (Actress)\n\n==Theatre work==\nInosanto is active in Southern California theatre, as a member of the [[Asian American theatre]] group, [[Lodestone Theatre Ensemble]].

The 66ers were a national phenomenon that grew from a small-town team to an organization of accomplished amateur athletes receiving national and worldwide attention.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Under the sponsorship of the company's owner, [[Frank Phillips (oil industrialist)|Frank Phillips]], the team, which began playing in 1919, participated in the [[Amateur Athletic Union]], the nation\u2019s premier basketball league before the [[National Basketball Association]]. Between 1920 and 1950, some of the strongest basketball teams in the United States were sponsored by corporations\u2014[[Phillips 66]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[Safeway Inc.]], [[Caterpillar Inc.]], and others.\n\nThe 66ers were a perennial power in [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]] basketball in the 1940s, and 1950s. The team won 11 national championships at the [[AAU National Tournament]] between 1940 and 1963, including six consecutive AAU tournament titles, from 1943 to 1948.<ref>http://www.phillips66.com/EN/newsroom/feature-stories/Pages/Phillips66ers.aspx</ref>\nIn 1948, the 66ers combined with [[Adolph Rupp]]'s \"Fabulous Five\" [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|University of Kentucky]] [[1947\u201348 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|team]] to form the [[United States men's national basketball team|U.S. team]] that won the [[Basketball at the 1948 Summer Olympics|Olympic basketball tournament]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.straitpinkie.com/kentucky-2/all-time-kentucky-team-starting-pg-12-ralph-beard/|title= All-Time Kentucky Team (Starting PG): #12 Ralph Beard|publisher= straitpinkie.com|accessdate= May 27, 2013|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131005231849/http://www.straitpinkie.com/kentucky-2/all-time-kentucky-team-starting-pg-12-ralph-beard/|archivedate= October 5, 2013|df= }}</ref>\n\nIn almost 50 seasons, the 66ers earned 1543 wins against 271 losses. Twelve 66ers and two coaches represented the [[United States men's national basketball team|United States]] in Olympic tournaments, and three of them were the only amateur players to have ever played on two Olympic basketball teams. The club ceased operations in 1968.\n\n==History==\n\n===Team creation===\nPhillips Petroleum was started in 1917, at the start of the oil boom. \nIn 1919 several of Bartlesville\u2019s local boys were returning from World War I. Some of them found jobs at Phillips and a few decided to form a Phillips basketball team. In 1920 the Phillips team began playing other corporate teams. In 1921, a group of Phillips employees, looking for some way to stay in shape during the winter months, organized a team in the Bartlesville YMCA basketball league.<br />\nThey played in Bartlesville and neighboring towns for several years, strictly small-time. It wasn't long, however, before a rivalry built up with Empire Oil & Gas.\n\n===1921-1942: First years in AAU===\nThe 66ers joined the [[Amateur Athletic Association (basketball)|Amateur Athletic Union]] -which featured best basketball players at that time- in 1921.<br />\nThe best player of the team in the 1920s was Paul Endacott who had been a college star at Kansas and was named the [[Amateur Athletic Association (basketball)|Amateur Athletic Union]] Player of the Year in 1923 (there was no NCAA tournament in those days). Paul Endacott started playing for the 66ers in 1927 being a Phillips employee. By the same year a rivalry with Phillips University of Enid who the national collegiate runner-up started to rise.<br /> \nPhillips 66 didn't field a team for the 1928-29 season. But the following season coinciding with the start of marketing products to the public, the Phillips' brass decided to go all out with its basketball team. Phillips University of Enid coach Lou Wilkie was hired as the first full-time coach in 1929, and several good players many from the disbanded Mid-Continent Oil Co. team were brought in.\nThe 1929-30 team lost in the second round of the National AAU tournament, as did the next year's version. Then, with the Depression raging, Phillips dropped basketball to concentrate on survival. That strategy worked, and by 1936, Phillips was more convinced than ever that a strong basketball team would be good for business.<br />\nThe AAU's annual tournament drew the best players in the world, as well as thousands of fans and dozens of sports writers and broadcasters. During the 1930s, the only professional basketball teams were barnstormers like the [[House of David (commune)|House of David]] and the [[Harlem Globetrotters]]. In all those years the 66ers played against teams fielded by various commercial companies, under the sanction of the Amateur Athletic Union.<br />\nPaul Endacott and young prospect David Perkins were the key players in the 1930s. Phillips gradually made a name for itself, finishing second in the AAU tournament in 1936-37 and again in 1938-39 with a 36-11 record. That season three of those 11 losses came at the hands of the Oklahoma City Parks. When the Parks disbanded after the season, Phillips hired the top two players, Grady Lewis and Bill Martin who earned AAU All-America honors as a guard at Oklahoma.<br />\nWith those addition in the squad and the likes of Joe Fortenberry and Don Lockard, the 66ers rolled to a 48-5 record and a 39-36 victory over the reigning champions [[Denver Nuggets (1948\u201350)|Denver Nuggets]] in the finals of the 1939-1940 AAU tournament. When the team got back to the Bartlesville station, there was a tremendous number of people out to welcome the champions.<br />\nThe team finished second in the 1940-1941 season. One of its losses came after the season, in a Red Cross benefit game in Tulsa. There, the 66ers lost to Arkansas, led by a skinny 6-8 center John Freiberger who joined the 66ers the next year. But  that was the time that the World War II war escalated and with the United States involved, and most of the top players of the 66ers joined the military. Bill Martin joined the Army Air Corps in 1942 and John Freiberger in 1943, thus the team had poor results during the 1941-1942 season.\n\n===1943-1946: Beginning of the dynasty===\nPhillips dominated the AAU titles from 1943 to 1948, winning six straight titles and posting a 241-24 record (+909) against all comers. With the World War II war ongoing in 1943 and Phillips being a war-related industry, most of its employees were exempt from the draft. And with other AAU teams weakened the 66ers won AAU titles in 1943-44, 1944\u201345 and 1945-1946.\n\n===1946-1952: Bob Kurland era===\nIn the 1945-46 season, the college basketball was dominated by the first two \"modern big men'' [[George Mikan]] of the [[DePaul Blue Demons men's basketball|DePaul Blue Demons]], and two-time NCAA champion [[Bob Kurland]] of the  [[Oklahoma State Cowboys men's basketball|Oklahoma A&M Aggies]]. Bob Kurland became a 66er in 1946 and considered the club's greatest player since then.<br />\nKurland made the 66ers more popular and powerful than ever. Huge crowds thronged to the Bartlesville high school gym, which only seated 1,400 to see Kurland and the 66ers rolled to a 52-2 record in 1946-47. It was the year that the war had ended, and most of the former players returned, including Freiberger and Martin. Those two teamed up with Bob Kurland and the 66ers rolled to their fourth straight AAU championship in 1946-1947 season.<br />\nThe 66ers achieved a stunning 62-3 record in 1947-48 and won their AAU 5th title in a row.<br />\nPhillips also dominated the 1948 Olympic trials, beating NCAA champion [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky Wildcats]], 53-49, in the finals. That put five 66ers [[Bob Kurland]], [[Cab Renick]], [[Lew Beck (basketball)|Lew Beck]], [[Gordon Carpenter]] and R.C. Pitts on the Olympic team, and made Phillips coach [[Bud Browning]] the head coach over Kentucky's [[Adolph Rupp]]. Ironically, it was the second time Rupp had played second fiddle to a Phillips man. He was a back-up to [[Paul Endacott]] in their college days at Kansas.<br />\nThe Phillips 66ers' record finished in 1949 after the Oilers lost to the Oakland Bittners in the AAU finals. According to George Durham, the team's publicity director and business manager for 20 years that team generated approximately $545,000 in free publicity during the 1948-49 season.<br />\nThe 66ers won the AAU title again in 1949-50, but that was followed by two bare seasons in 1950-1951 and 1951-1952 where they did not manage to repeat the triumph in the Olympic Trial Games (Peoria Caterpillars won the playoffs). Kurland set a record by being named to his second Olympic team in 1952, but he broke a lot of hearts in Bartlesville by deciding to retire just after the Games. \nThe following year 1953 [[Clyde Lovellette]] joined Mikan signing for the [[Los Angeles Lakers|Minneapolis Lakers]].\n\n===1953-1960: Restructure and Olympic triumphs===\nIn 1953 a 6\u20136 foot forward named [[Pete Silas]] signed from the NCAA [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets men's basketball|Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]]. Silas had led the Southeastern Conference in scoring despite competing against such talented players as [[Cliff Hagen]] and Frank Ramsey and Louisiana State's [[Bob Pettit]]. He made the Armed Forces All-Stars and played on the gold-medal-winning Pan-American Games team in 1955. Despite the fact that Silas was in the Army the 66ers led by a 6-9 scoring-machine forward from Colorado named [[Burdie Haldorson]] won the 1956 Olympic Trials playoffs and sent five men to the [[Basketball at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Olympics]]. <br />\nHaldorson set the team record by scoring 53 points against the [[Cleveland Pipers]] in 1960. He also tied Kurland's record by making the Olympic team for the second time in [[Basketball at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympics]]. He retired after that and went to work for Phillips' Denver division.\n\n===1960-1968: Decline and the end===\nBy the time Haldorson retired, AAU basketball was dying a slow death. TV had discovered the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], and the pros were starting to stabilize and pay more money than teams like Phillips could. The [[National Industrial Basketball League]], the top amateur loop, disbanded in 1961.<br />\nThe Phillips players were strictly amateurs. They worked during the daytime and practiced at night. They got no special treatment, except for being excused from work at noon on game day. As the pro salaries increased, it got harder to get and keep quality players. But still a few good players came to Bartlesville. Like a 6-1 guard from the lowly Wabash College named [[Charlie Bowerman]], and [[Gary Thompson (basketball)|Gary Thompson]] from Iowa State. Thompson helped the 66ers win the 1961-1962 AAU tournament, and he was named the MVP.<br />\nIn the 1960s the AAU basketball faced hard times. The Big Ten had always prohibited its teams from playing AAU squads, and in the mid-60s other conferences followed suit. Newspapers started cutting down on space given to AAU teams, partly because of the pro glut and partly because of an attitude that companies should pay for all advertising and publicity.<br />\nThe team cost about $150,000 a year to operate, not including players' salaries. Very little of that was recouped by ticket sales. The highest tickets were $2, but most of the tickets were $1 or 50 cents.<br />\nThe final blow fell in 1967: The [[American Basketball Association|ABA]] was founded. The ABA was on firmer financial footing than the old [[American Basketball League (1925-1955)|ABL]], and it needed bodies to compete with the established NBA. Seven 66ers jumped to the new league, most notably [[Darel Carrier]] and [[John Beasley (basketball)|John Beasley]], both of whom had excellent ABA careers.<br />\nThe 66ers already had an AAU schedule for 1967-68, so enough players were called out of retirement to form a team to play out the schedule. The 66ers lost their last game ever, 57-52, to the Spokane (Washington) Vaughan Realtors in the quarterfinals of the AAU national tournament.<br />\nThe 66ers fulfilled their other goal: making the Phillips' name and this northeastern Oklahoma town known all over the country.\n\n==Notable players==\nThe Oilers placed a record of 39 players in the [[AAU Men's Basketball All-Americans|AAU's All-America teams]]  and 21 became members of the AAU Basketball Hall of Fame.  In the 1930s, these All-Americans included [[Jay Wallenstrom]] (1937) and [[Ray Ebbing]] (1939).\n\n===AAU All-Americans===\nIn the 1940s, Phillips 66 All-Americans were the players below: \n*[[Doc Lockard]] (1940)\n*[[Joe Fortenberry]] (1940)\n*[[Grady Lewis]] (1940)\n*[[Hank Luisetti]] (1942)\n*[[Bill Martin (AAU basketball)|Bill Martin]] (1942, 1946)\n*[[Jimmy McNatt]] (1943\u20131946)\n*[[Gordon Carpenter]] (1943\u20131947)\n*[[Fred Pralle]] (1944)\n*[[Paul Lindemann]] (1945)\n*[[Marty Nash]] (1946\u20131947)\n*[[Bob Kurland]] (1947\u20131952)\n*[[Cab Renick]] (1947\u20131948)\n*[[R.

The 66ers were a national phenomenon that grew from a small-town team to an organization of accomplished amateur athletes receiving national and worldwide attention.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Under the sponsorship of the company's owner, [[Frank Phillips (oil industrialist)|Frank Phillips]], the team, which began playing in 1919, participated in the [[Amateur Athletic Union]], the nation\u2019s premier basketball league before the [[National Basketball Association]]. Between 1920 and 1950, some of the strongest basketball teams in the United States were sponsored by corporations\u2014[[Phillips 66]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[Safeway Inc.]], [[Caterpillar Inc.]], and others.\n\nThe 66ers were a perennial power in [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]] basketball in the 1940s, and 1950s. The team won 11 national championships at the [[AAU National Tournament]] between 1940 and 1963, including six consecutive AAU tournament titles, from 1943 to 1948.<ref>http://www.phillips66.com/EN/newsroom/feature-stories/Pages/Phillips66ers.aspx</ref>\nIn 1948, the 66ers combined with [[Adolph Rupp]]'s \"Fabulous Five\" [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|University of Kentucky]] [[1947\u201348 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|team]] to form the [[United States men's national basketball team|U.S. team]] that won the [[Basketball at the 1948 Summer Olympics|Olympic basketball tournament]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.straitpinkie.com/kentucky-2/all-time-kentucky-team-starting-pg-12-ralph-beard/|title= All-Time Kentucky Team (Starting PG): #12 Ralph Beard|publisher= straitpinkie.com|accessdate= May 27, 2013|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131005231849/http://www.straitpinkie.com/kentucky-2/all-time-kentucky-team-starting-pg-12-ralph-beard/|archivedate= October 5, 2013|df= }}</ref>\n\nIn almost 50 seasons, the 66ers earned 1543 wins against 271 losses. Twelve 66ers and two coaches represented the [[United States men's national basketball team|United States]] in Olympic tournaments, and three of them were the only amateur players to have ever played on two Olympic basketball teams. The club ceased operations in 1968.\n\n==History==\n\n===Team creation===\nPhillips Petroleum was started in 1917, at the start of the oil boom. \nIn 1919 several of Bartlesville\u2019s local boys were returning from World War I. Some of them found jobs at Phillips and a few decided to form a Phillips basketball team. In 1920 the Phillips team began playing other corporate teams. In 1921, a group of Phillips employees, looking for some way to stay in shape during the winter months, organized a team in the Bartlesville YMCA basketball league.<br />\nThey played in Bartlesville and neighboring towns for several years, strictly small-time. It wasn't long, however, before a rivalry built up with Empire Oil & Gas.\n\n===1921-1942: First years in AAU===\nThe 66ers joined the [[Amateur Athletic Association (basketball)|Amateur Athletic Union]] -which featured best basketball players at that time- in 1921.<br />\nThe best player of the team in the 1920s was Paul Endacott who had been a college star at Kansas and was named the [[Amateur Athletic Association (basketball)|Amateur Athletic Union]] Player of the Year in 1923 (there was no NCAA tournament in those days). Paul Endacott started playing for the 66ers in 1927 being a Phillips employee. By the same year a rivalry with Phillips University of Enid who the national collegiate runner-up started to rise.<br /> \nPhillips 66 didn't field a team for the 1928-29 season. But the following season coinciding with the start of marketing products to the public, the Phillips' brass decided to go all out with its basketball team. Phillips University of Enid coach Lou Wilkie was hired as the first full-time coach in 1929, and several good players many from the disbanded Mid-Continent Oil Co. team were brought in.\nThe 1929-30 team lost in the second round of the National AAU tournament, as did the next year's version. Then, with the Depression raging, Phillips dropped basketball to concentrate on survival. That strategy worked, and by 1936, Phillips was more convinced than ever that a strong basketball team would be good for business.<br />\nThe AAU's annual tournament drew the best players in the world, as well as thousands of fans and dozens of sports writers and broadcasters. During the 1930s, the only professional basketball teams were barnstormers like the [[House of David (commune)|House of David]] and the [[Harlem Globetrotters]]. In all those years the 66ers played against teams fielded by various commercial companies, under the sanction of the Amateur Athletic Union.<br />\nPaul Endacott and young prospect David Perkins were the key players in the 1930s. Phillips gradually made a name for itself, finishing second in the AAU tournament in 1936-37 and again in 1938-39 with a 36-11 record. That season three of those 11 losses came at the hands of the Oklahoma City Parks. When the Parks disbanded after the season, Phillips hired the top two players, Grady Lewis and Bill Martin who earned AAU All-America honors as a guard at Oklahoma.<br />\nWith those addition in the squad and the likes of Joe Fortenberry and Don Lockard, the 66ers rolled to a 48-5 record and a 39-36 victory over the reigning champions [[Denver Nuggets (1948\u201350)|Denver Nuggets]] in the finals of the 1939-1940 AAU tournament. When the team got back to the Bartlesville station, there was a tremendous number of people out to welcome the champions.<br />\nThe team finished second in the 1940-1941 season. One of its losses came after the season, in a Red Cross benefit game in Tulsa. There, the 66ers lost to Arkansas, led by a skinny 6-8 center John Freiberger who joined the 66ers the next year. But  that was the time that the World War II war escalated and with the United States involved, and most of the top players of the 66ers joined the military. Bill Martin joined the Army Air Corps in 1942 and John Freiberger in 1943, thus the team had poor results during the 1941-1942 season.\n\n===1943-1946: Beginning of the dynasty===\nPhillips dominated the AAU titles from 1943 to 1948, winning six straight titles and posting a 241-24 record (+909) against all comers. With the World War II war ongoing in 1943 and Phillips being a war-related industry, most of its employees were exempt from the draft. And with other AAU teams weakened the 66ers won AAU titles in 1943-44, 1944\u201345 and 1945-1946.\n\n===1946-1952: Bob Kurland era===\nIn the 1945-46 season, the college basketball was dominated by the first two \"modern big men'' [[George Mikan]] of the [[DePaul Blue Demons men's basketball|DePaul Blue Demons]], and two-time NCAA champion [[Bob Kurland]] of the  [[Oklahoma State Cowboys men's basketball|Oklahoma A&M Aggies]]. Bob Kurland became a 66er in 1946 and considered the club's greatest player since then.<br />\nKurland made the 66ers more popular and powerful than ever. Huge crowds thronged to the Bartlesville high school gym, which only seated 1,400 to see Kurland and the 66ers rolled to a 52-2 record in 1946-47. It was the year that the war had ended, and most of the former players returned, including Freiberger and Martin. Those two teamed up with Bob Kurland and the 66ers rolled to their fourth straight AAU championship in 1946-1947 season.<br />\nThe 66ers achieved a stunning 62-3 record in 1947-48 and won their AAU 5th title in a row.<br />\nPhillips also dominated the 1948 Olympic trials, beating NCAA champion [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky Wildcats]], 53-49, in the finals. That put five 66ers [[Bob Kurland]], [[Cab Renick]], [[Lew Beck (basketball)|Lew Beck]], [[Gordon Carpenter]] and R.C. Pitts on the Olympic team, and made Phillips coach [[Bud Browning]] the head coach over Kentucky's [[Adolph Rupp]]. Ironically, it was the second time Rupp had played second fiddle to a Phillips man. He was a back-up to [[Paul Endacott]] in their college days at Kansas.<br />\nThe Phillips 66ers' record finished in 1949 after the Oilers lost to the Oakland Bittners in the AAU finals. According to George Durham, the team's publicity director and business manager for 20 years that team generated approximately $545,000 in free publicity during the 1948-49 season.<br />\nThe 66ers won the AAU title again in 1949-50, but that was followed by two bare seasons in 1950-1951 and 1951-1952 where they did not manage to repeat the triumph in the Olympic Trial Games (Peoria Caterpillars won the playoffs). Kurland set a record by being named to his second Olympic team in 1952, but he broke a lot of hearts in Bartlesville by deciding to retire just after the Games. \nThe following year 1953 [[Clyde Lovellette]] joined Mikan signing for the [[Los Angeles Lakers|Minneapolis Lakers]].\n\n===1953-1960: Restructure and Olympic triumphs===\nIn 1953 a 6\u20136 foot forward named [[Pete Silas]] signed from the NCAA [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets men's basketball|Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]]. Silas had led the Southeastern Conference in scoring despite competing against such talented players as [[Cliff Hagen]] and Frank Ramsey and Louisiana State's [[Bob Pettit]]. He made the Armed Forces All-Stars and played on the gold-medal-winning Pan-American Games team in 1955. Despite the fact that Silas was in the Army the 66ers led by a 6-9 scoring-machine forward from Colorado named [[Burdie Haldorson]] won the 1956 Olympic Trials playoffs and sent five men to the [[Basketball at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Olympics]]. <br />\nHaldorson set the team record by scoring 53 points against the [[Cleveland Pipers]] in 1960. He also tied Kurland's record by making the Olympic team for the second time in [[Basketball at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympics]]. He retired after that and went to work for Phillips' Denver division.\n\n===1960-1968: Decline and the end===\nBy the time Haldorson retired, AAU basketball was dying a slow death. TV had discovered the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], and the pros were starting to stabilize and pay more money than teams like Phillips could. The [[National Industrial Basketball League]], the top amateur loop, disbanded in 1961.<br />\nThe Phillips players were strictly amateurs. They worked during the daytime and practiced at night. They got no special treatment, except for being excused from work at noon on game day. As the pro salaries increased, it got harder to get and keep quality players. But still a few good players came to Bartlesville. Like a 6-1 guard from the lowly Wabash College named [[Charlie Bowerman]], and [[Gary Thompson (basketball)|Gary Thompson]] from Iowa State. Thompson helped the 66ers win the 1961-1962 AAU tournament, and he was named the MVP.<br />\nIn the 1960s the AAU basketball faced hard times. The Big Ten had always prohibited its teams from playing AAU squads, and in the mid-60s other conferences followed suit. Newspapers started cutting down on space given to AAU teams, partly because of the pro glut and partly because of an attitude that companies should pay for all advertising and publicity.<br />\nThe team cost about $150,000 a year to operate, not including players' salaries. Very little of that was recouped by ticket sales. The highest tickets were $2, but most of the tickets were $1 or 50 cents.<br />\nThe final blow fell in 1967: The [[American Basketball Association|ABA]] was founded. The ABA was on firmer financial footing than the old [[American Basketball League (1925-1955)|ABL]], and it needed bodies to compete with the established NBA. Seven 66ers jumped to the new league, most notably [[Darrell Carrier]] and [[John Beasley (basketball)|John Beasley]], both of whom had excellent ABA careers.<br />\nThe 66ers already had an AAU schedule for 1967-68, so enough players were called out of retirement to form a team to play out the schedule. The 66ers lost their last game ever, 57-52, to the Spokane (Washington) Vaughan Realtors in the quarterfinals of the AAU national tournament.<br />\nThe 66ers fulfilled their other goal: making the Phillips' name and this northeastern Oklahoma town known all over the country.\n\n==Notable players==\nThe Oilers placed a record of 39 players in the [[AAU Men's Basketball All-Americans|AAU's All-America teams]]  and 21 became members of the AAU Basketball Hall of Fame.  In the 1930s, these All-Americans included [[Jay Wallenstrom]] (1937) and [[Ray Ebbing]] (1939).\n\n===AAU All-Americans===\nIn the 1940s, Phillips 66 All-Americans were the players below: \n*[[Doc Lockard]] (1940)\n*[[Joe Fortenberry]] (1940)\n*[[Grady Lewis]] (1940)\n*[[Hank Luisetti]] (1942)\n*[[Bill Martin (AAU basketball)|Bill Martin]] (1942, 1946)\n*[[Jimmy McNatt]] (1943\u20131946)\n*[[Gordon Carpenter]] (1943\u20131947)\n*[[Fred Pralle]] (1944)\n*[[Paul Lindemann]] (1945)\n*[[Marty Nash]] (1946\u20131947)\n*[[Bob Kurland]] (1947\u20131952)\n*[[Cab Renick]] (1947\u20131948)\n*[[R.

Created by [[\u00c1lex Pina]], the series was initially intended as a limited series to be told in two parts. It had its original run of 15 episodes on Spanish network(of time span about approx.60-70+ min) [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]] from 2 May 2017 through 23 November 2017. [[Netflix]] acquired the global streaming rights in late 2017. It re-cut the series into 22 shorter episodes ( time span about 40-55min aprox)and released them worldwide, beginning with the first part on 20 December 2017, followed by the second part on 6 April 2018.So orginal (9+6)15 episode was recut into(13+9)22 episode in netflix platform. In April 2018, Netflix renewed the series with a significantly increased budget for 16 new episodes total. Part 3, with eight episodes, was released on 19 July 2019. Part 4, also with eight episodes, has been released on 3 April 2020. A documentary involving the producers and the cast will premiere on Netflix the same day, titled ''Money Heist: The Phenomenon''.\n\n\nThe first two parts revolve around a long-prepared, multi-day assault on the [[Royal Mint of Spain]] in [[Madrid]], in which a group of robbers take hostages as part of their plan to print and escape with \u20ac2.4 billion. It involves eight robbers, code-named after cities and led by the Professor ([[\u00c1lvaro Morte]]) from an external location. The story is primarily focused on one of the robbers, Tokyo ([[\u00darsula Corber\u00f3]]), as they battle with hostages on the inside and the police on the outside. In the third part, the surviving robbers are forced out of hiding, and with the help of new members, they plan and perform an assault on the [[Bank of Spain]].\n\nThe series was filmed in Madrid, Spain. Significant portions of part 3 were also filmed in [[Panama]], [[Thailand]] and [[Florence]], Italy. The narrative is told in a real-time-like fashion and relies on flashbacks, time-jumps, hidden character motivations and an unreliable narrator for complexity. The series subverts the heist genre by being told from the perspective of a woman (Tokyo) and having a strong [[Spaniard|Spanish]] identity, where emotional dynamics offset the perfect strategic crime.\n\nThe series received critical acclaim for its sophisticated plot, interpersonal dramas, direction and for trying to innovate Spanish television. The Italian anti-fascist song \"[[Bella ciao]]\", which plays multiple times throughout the series, became a summer hit across Europe in 2018. By 2018, the series was the most-watched non-English language series and one of the most-watched series overall on Netflix,<ref name=newstatesman_180824 /> with a particular resonance coming from viewers from Mediterranean Europe and the Latin world.\n\n== Series overview ==\n{{main|List of Money Heist episodes}}\n{{:List of Money Heist episodes}}\n\n=== Season 1: Parts 1 and 2 (2017) ===\n\nPart 1 begins with the aftermath of a failed bank robbery by a woman named \"Tokyo\", as a man named the \"Professor\" saves her from being caught by the police and proposes her a heist of drastic proportions. After a brief outline of the planned heist, the story jumps to the beginning of a multi-day assault on the [[Royal Mint of Spain]] in [[Madrid]]. The eight robbers are code-named after cities: Tokyo, Moscow, Berlin, Nairobi, Rio, Denver, Helsinki and Oslo. Dressed in red jumpsuits with a mask of the Spanish painter [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], the group of robbers take 67 hostages as part of their plan to print and escape with \u20ac2.4 billion through a self-built escape tunnel. The Professor heads the heist from an external location. Flashbacks throughout the series show the five months of preparation in an abandoned hunting estate in the [[Province of Toledo|Toledo]] countryside; the robbers are not to share personal information nor engage in personal relationships, and the assault shall be without bloodshed.\n\nThroughout parts 1 and 2, the robbers inside the Mint have difficulties sticking to the pre-defined rules, and face uncooperative hostages, violence, isolation, and mutiny. Tokyo commentates the events through [[voice-over]]s. While Denver pursues a love affair with the hostage M\u00f3nica Gaztambide, inspector Raquel Murillo of the [[National Police Corps]] negotiates with the Professor on the outside and begins an intimate relationship with his alter ego \"Salva\". The Professor's identity is repeatedly close to being uncovered, until Raquel realises his true identity, but is emotionally unable and unwilling to hand him over to the police. At the end of part 2, after 128 hours, the robbers escape successfully from the Mint with \u20ac984 million printed, but at the cost of the lives of Oslo, Moscow and Berlin. One year after the heist, Raquel decodes postcards left by the Professor for a location in [[Palawan]] in the Philippines, where she reunites with him.\n\n=== Season 2: Part 3 (2019) ===\n\nPart 3 begins two to three years after the heist on the Royal Mint of Spain, showing the robbers enjoying their lives paired-up in diverse locations. However, when [[Europol]] captures Rio with an intercepted phone, the Professor picks up Berlin's old plans to assault the [[Bank of Spain]] to force Europol to hand over Rio. He and Raquel (going by \"Lisbon\") get the gang, including M\u00f3nica (going by \"Stockholm\"), back together and enlist three new members: Bogot\u00e1, Palermo and Marseille. Flashbacks to the Professor and Berlin outline the planned new heist and their different approaches to love. The disguised robbers sneak into the heavily guarded bank, take hostages and eventually gain access to the gold and state secrets, while the Professor and Lisbon travel in an [[RV]] and then an ambulance while communicating with the robbers and the police. A breach in the bank is thwarted, forcing the police, led by Colonel Luis Tamayo and pregnant inspector Alicia Sierra, to release Rio to the robbers. Nairobi gets gravely injured by a police-inflicted [[sniper]] shot in the chest, and Lisbon is caught by the police. With another police assault on the bank incoming, and believing Lisbon to have been executed by the police, the Professor radios Palermo and declares [[DEFCON 2]] on the police. Part 3 concludes by showing Lisbon alive and in custody, and Tokyo narrating that the Professor had fallen for his own trap and that \"the war had begun.\"\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n\n=== Main ===\n<!-- Main and recurring are split and ordered as they appear in the series' credits. -->\n* [[\u00darsula Corber\u00f3]] as Silene Oliveira (Tokyo): the narrator; she was a runaway robber until scouted by the Professor to participate in his plan.\n* [[\u00c1lvaro Morte]] as Sergio Marquina (The Professor / Salvador \"Salva\" Mart\u00edn): the mastermind of the heist who assembled the group, and Berlin's brother.\n* [[Itziar Itu\u00f1o]] as Raquel Murillo (Lisbon): an inspector of the [[National Police Corps]] who is put in charge of the case until she joins the group in part 3.\n* [[Pedro Alonso]] as Andr\u00e9s de Fonollosa (Berlin): a terminally ill jewel thief and the Professor's second-in-command and brother.\n* [[Alba Flores]] as \u00c1gata Jim\u00e9nez (Nairobi): an expert in forgery in charge of printing the money for the group.\n* [[Miguel Herr\u00e1n]] as An\u00edbal Cort\u00e9s (Rio): a young hacker and Tokyo's boyfriend.\n* [[Paco Tous]] as Agust\u00edn Ramos (Moscow) (part 1\u20132; featured part 3 & 4): a former miner turned criminal and Denver's father.\n* [[Jaime Lorente]] as Daniel/Ricardo{{efn|The official website lists Denver's name as Daniel,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.antena3.com/series/casa-de-papel/noticias/conoce-los-verdaderos-nombres-de-la-banda-de-atracadores-de-la-casa-de-papel_201711255a1940100cf2f56e3ec268dd.html |title=Conoce los verdaderos nombres de la banda de atracadores de 'La casa de papel' |language=es |publisher=antena3.com |last=\u00c1lvarez |first=Jennifer |date=25 November 2017 |access-date=16 August 2019}}</ref> but in the show he has called himself Ricardo.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Part 2, episode 8 |series=Money Heist |network=Netflix <!--|season= |series-no= |number=--> |time=36:50 |quote= |language=}}</ref>}} Ramos (Denver): Moscow's son who joins him in the heist.\n* [[Esther Acebo]] as M\u00f3nica Gaztambide (Stockholm): one of the hostages who is Arturo Rom\u00e1n's secretary and mistress, carrying his child out of wedlock.

Created by [[\u00c1lex Pina]], the series was initially intended as a limited series to be told in two parts. It had its original run of 15 episodes on Spanish network(of time span about approx.60-70+ min) [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]] from 2 May 2017 through 23 November 2017. [[Netflix]] acquired the global streaming rights in late 2017. It re-cut the series into 22 shorter episodes ( time span about 40-55min aprox)and released them worldwide, beginning with the first part on 20 December 2017, followed by the second part on 6 April 2018.So orginal (9+6)15 episode was recut into(13+9)22 episode in netflix platform. In April 2018, Netflix renewed the series with a significantly increased budget for 16 new episodes total. Part 3, with eight episodes, was released on 19 July 2019. Part 4, also with eight episodes, has been released on 3 April 2020. A documentary involving the producers and the cast will premiere on Netflix the same day, titled ''Money Heist: The Phenomenon''.\n\n\nThe first two parts revolve around a long-prepared, multi-day assault on the [[Royal Mint of Spain]] in [[Madrid]], in which a group of robbers take hostages as part of their plan to print and escape with \u20ac2.4 billion. It involves eight robbers, code-named after cities and led by the Professor ([[\u00c1lvaro Morte]]) from an external location. The story is primarily focused on one of the robbers, Tokyo ([[\u00darsula Corber\u00f3]]), as they battle with hostages on the inside and the police on the outside. In the third part, the surviving robbers are forced out of hiding, and with the help of new members, they plan and perform an assault on the [[Bank of Spain]].\n\nThe series was filmed in Madrid, Spain. Significant portions of part 3 were also filmed in [[Panama]], [[Thailand]] and [[Florence]], Italy. The narrative is told in a real-time-like fashion and relies on flashbacks, time-jumps, hidden character motivations and an unreliable narrator for complexity. The series subverts the heist genre by being told from the perspective of a woman (Tokyo) and having a strong [[Spaniard|Spanish]] identity, where emotional dynamics offset the perfect strategic crime.\n\nThe series received critical acclaim for its sophisticated plot, interpersonal dramas, direction and for trying to innovate Spanish television. The Italian anti-fascist song \"[[Bella ciao]]\", which plays multiple times throughout the series, became a summer hit across Europe in 2018. By 2018, the series was the most-watched non-English language series and one of the most-watched series overall on Netflix,<ref name=newstatesman_180824 /> with a particular resonance coming from viewers from Mediterranean Europe and the Latin world.\n\n== Series overview ==\n{{main|List of Money Heist episodes}}\n{{:List of Money Heist episodes}}\n\n=== Season 1: Parts 1 and 2 (2017) ===\n\nPart 1 begins with the aftermath of a failed bank robbery by a woman named \"Tokyo\", as a man named the \"Professor\" saves her from being caught by the police and proposes her a heist of drastic proportions. After a brief outline of the planned heist, the story jumps to the beginning of a multi-day assault on the [[Royal Mint of Spain]] in [[Madrid]]. The eight robbers are code-named after cities: Tokyo, Moscow, Berlin, Nairobi, Rio, Denver, Helsinki and Oslo. Dressed in red jumpsuits with a mask of the Spanish painter [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], the group of robbers take 67 hostages as part of their plan to print and escape with \u20ac2.4 billion through a self-built escape tunnel. The Professor heads the heist from an external location. Flashbacks throughout the series show the five months of preparation in an abandoned hunting estate in the [[Province of Toledo|Toledo]] countryside; the robbers are not to share personal information nor engage in personal relationships, and the assault shall be without bloodshed.\n\nThroughout parts 1 and 2, the robbers inside the Mint have difficulties sticking to the pre-defined rules, and face uncooperative hostages, violence, isolation, and mutiny. Tokyo commentates the events through [[voice-over]]s. While Denver pursues a love affair with the hostage M\u00f3nica Gaztambide, inspector Raquel Murillo of the [[National Police Corps]] negotiates with the Professor on the outside and begins an intimate relationship with his alter ego \"Salva\". The Professor's identity is repeatedly close to being uncovered, until Raquel realises his true identity, but is emotionally unable and unwilling to hand him over to the police. At the end of part 2, after 128 hours, the robbers escape successfully from the Mint with \u20ac984 million printed, but at the cost of the lives of Oslo, Moscow and Berlin. One year after the heist, Raquel decodes postcards left by the Professor for a location in [[Palawan]] in the Philippines, where she reunites with him.\n\n=== Season 2: Part 3 (2019) ===\n\nPart 3 begins two to three years after the heist on the Royal Mint of Spain, showing the robbers enjoying their lives paired-up in diverse locations. However, when [[Europol]] captures Rio with an intercepted phone, the Professor picks up Berlin's old plans to assault the [[Bank of Spain]] to force Europol to hand over Rio. He and Raquel (going by \"Lisbon\") get the gang, including M\u00f3nica (going by \"Stockholm\"), back together and enlist three new members: Bogot\u00e1, Palermo and Marseille. Flashbacks to the Professor and Berlin outline the planned new heist and their different approaches to love. The disguised robbers sneak into the heavily guarded bank, take hostages and eventually gain access to the gold and state secrets, while the Professor and Lisbon travel in an [[RV]] and then an ambulance while communicating with the robbers and the police. A breach in the bank is thwarted, forcing the police, led by Colonel Luis Tamayo and pregnant inspector Alicia Sierra, to release Rio to the robbers. Nairobi gets gravely injured by a police-inflicted [[sniper]] shot in the chest, and Lisbon is caught by the police. With another police assault on the bank incoming, and believing Lisbon to have been executed by the police, the Professor radios Palermo and declares [[DEFCON 2]] on the police. Part 3 concludes by showing Lisbon alive and in custody, and Tokyo narrating that the Professor had fallen for his own trap and that \"the war had begun.\"\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n\n=== Main ===\n<!-- Main and recurring are split and ordered as they appear in the series' credits. -->\n* [[\u00darsula Corber\u00f3]] as Silene Oliveira (Tokyo): the narrator; she was a runaway robber until scouted by the Professor to participate in his plan.\n* [[\u00c1lvaro Morte]] as Sergio Marquina (The Professor / Salvador \"Salva\" Mart\u00edn): the mastermind of the heist who assembled the group, and Berlin's brother.\n* [[Itziar Itu\u00f1o]] as Raquel Murillo (Lisbon): an inspector of the [[National Police Corps]] who is put in charge of the case until she joins the group in part 3.\n* [[Pedro Alonso]] as Andr\u00e9s de Fonollosa (Berlin): a terminally ill jewel thief and the Professor's second-in-command and brother.\n* [[Alba Flores]] as \u00c1gata Jim\u00e9nez (Nairobi) (part 1\u20134): an expert in forgery in charge of printing the money for the group.\n* [[Miguel Herr\u00e1n]] as An\u00edbal Cort\u00e9s (Rio): a young hacker and Tokyo's boyfriend.\n* [[Paco Tous]] as Agust\u00edn Ramos (Moscow) (part 1\u20132; featured part 3 & 4): a former miner turned criminal and Denver's father.\n* [[Jaime Lorente]] as Daniel/Ricardo{{efn|The official website lists Denver's name as Daniel,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.antena3.com/series/casa-de-papel/noticias/conoce-los-verdaderos-nombres-de-la-banda-de-atracadores-de-la-casa-de-papel_201711255a1940100cf2f56e3ec268dd.html |title=Conoce los verdaderos nombres de la banda de atracadores de 'La casa de papel' |language=es |publisher=antena3.com |last=\u00c1lvarez |first=Jennifer |date=25 November 2017 |access-date=16 August 2019}}</ref> but in the show he has called himself Ricardo.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Part 2, episode 8 |series=Money Heist |network=Netflix <!--|season= |series-no= |number=--> |time=36:50 |quote= |language=}}</ref>}} Ramos (Denver): Moscow's son who joins him in the heist.\n* [[Esther Acebo]] as M\u00f3nica Gaztambide (Stockholm): one of the hostages who is Arturo Rom\u00e1n's secretary and mistress, carrying his child out of wedlock.

Now we want more, which is not little.\"<ref name=elpais_170503 /> Reviewing the full first part, Marcos lauded the series for its outstanding direction, musical selection and for trying to innovate Spanish television, but criticized the length and ebbing tension.<ref name=elpais_171124>{{cite web |url=https://elpais.com/cultura/2017/11/24/television/1511480525_162365.html |title=\u2018La casa de papel\u2019 ha ganado |language=es |last=Marcos |first=Natalia |website=[[elpais.com]] |access-date=12 August 2019 |date=24 November 2017}}</ref> At the end of the series' original run, Nay\u00edn Costas of ''El Confidencial'' commended the series for its \"high quality closure\" that may make the finale \"one of the best episodes of the Spanish season\", but regretted that it aimed to satisfy viewers with a predictable happy ending rather than risk to \"do something different, original, ambitious\", and that the show was unable to follow in the footsteps of Pina's ''[[Locked Up (TV series)|Locked Up]]''.<ref name=elconfidencial_171123>{{cite web |last=Costas |first=Nay\u00edn |url=https://www.elconfidencial.com/television/series-tv/2017-11-23/final-como-acaba-la-casa-de-papel-muerte-berlin-hermano-profesor_1482592/ |title=Final feliz en 'La casa de papel', un gran cap\u00edtulo lastrado por la falta de sorpresa |language=es |publisher=elconfidencial.com |date=23 November 2017 |access-date=5 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter the show's move to Netflix for its international release, Adrian Hennigan of the Israeli ''[[Haaretz]]'' said the series was \"more of a twisty thriller than soapy telenovela, driven by its ingenious plot, engaging characters, tense flash points, pulsating score and occasional moments of humor\", but taunted the English title \"Money Heist\" as bland.<ref name=haaretz_180807 /> In a scathing review, Pauline Bock of the British magazine ''[[New Statesman]]'' questioned the global hype of the series, saying that it was \"full of plot holes, clich\u00e9d slow-motions, corny love stories and gratuitous sex scenes\", before continuing to add that \"the music is pompous, the voice-over irritating, and it's terribly edited\".<ref name=newstatesman_180824 /> [[John Doyle (critic)|John Doyle]] of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' praised parts 1 and 2 for the heist genre subversions; he also said that the series could be \"deliciously melodramatic at times\" with \"outrageous twists and much passion\" like a telenovela.<ref name=theglobeandmail>{{cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/article-three-great-foreign-dramas-on-netflix-for-a-summer-binge/?cmpid=rss1 |title=Three great foreign dramas on Netflix for a summer binge |last=Doyle |first=John |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |access-date=12 August 2019 |date=22 June 2018}}</ref> Jennifer Keishin Armstrong of the [[BBC]] saw the series' true appeal in the interpersonal dramas emerging through the heist between \"the beautiful robbers, their beautiful hostages and the beautiful authorities trying to negotiate with them.\"<ref name=bbc_190312 /> David Hugendick of ''[[Die Zeit]]'' found the series \"sometimes a bit sentimental, a little cartoonesque\", and the drama sometimes too telenovela-like, but \"all with a good sense for timing and spectacle.\"<ref name=zeit_180410>{{cite web |last=Hugendick |first=David |url=https://www.zeit.de/kultur/film/2018-04/haus-des-geldes-serie-netflix |title=Knackt das System! |language=de |publisher=[[zeit.de]] |date=10 April 2018 |access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave part 3 an approval rating of 100% based on 11 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"An audacious plan told in a non-linear fashion keeps the third installment moving as ''Money Heist'' refocuses on the relations between its beloved characters.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/la_casa_de_papel/s03 |title=Money Heist: Part 3 (2019) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref> While lauding the technical achievements, Javier Zurro of ''[[El Espa\u00f1ol]]'' described the third part as \"first-class entertainment\" that was unable to transcend its roots and lacked novelty. He felt unaffected by the internal drama between the characters and specifically disliked Tokyo's narration for its hollowness.<ref name=elespanol_190724 /> Alex Jim\u00e9nez of Spanish newspaper ''[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]'' found part 3 mostly succeeding in its attempts to reinvent the show and stay fresh.<ref name=abc_190725 />  Euan Ferguson of ''[[The Guardian]]'' recommended watching part 3, as \"it's still a glorious ''[[Peaky Blinders (TV series)|Peaky Blinders]]'', just with [[tapas]] and subtitles\",<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/28/week-in-tv-i-am-nicola-orange-is-new-black-keeping-faith-money-heist |title=The week in TV: I Am Nicola; Orange Is the New Black; Keeping Faith; Money Heist |last=Ferguson |first=Euan |publisher=theguardian.com |access-date=7 October 2019 |date=28 July 2019}}</ref> while Pere Sol\u00e0 Gimferrer of ''[[La Vanguardia]]'' found that the amount of plot holes in part 3 could only be endured with constant [[suspension of disbelief]].<ref name=lavanguardia_190809 /> Though entertained, Alfonso Rivadeneyra Garc\u00eda of Peruvian newspaper ''[[El Comercio (Peru)|El Comercio]]'' said the show does \"what it does best: pretend to be the smartest boy in class when, in fact, it is only the most alive.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://elcomercio.pe/tvmas/series/casa-papel-temporada-3-review-resena-spoilers-netflix-ecpm-noticia-654511 |title=\"La casa de papel\" temporada 3: rese\u00f1amos sin SPOILERS los primeros 3 episodios |language=es |last=Rivadeneyra Garc\u00eda |first=Alfonso |publisher=elcomercio.pe |access-date=3 October 2019 |date=19 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Awards and nominations ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:95%; width:99%;\"\n|-\n!
