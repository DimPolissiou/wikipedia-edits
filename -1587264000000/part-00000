The show features a [[quiz]] competition in which contestants are presented with [[general knowledge]] clues in the form of answers, and must phrase their responses in the form of questions. The original daytime version debuted on [[NBC]] on March 30, 1964, and aired until January 3, 1975. A weekly nighttime [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] edition aired from September 1974 to September 1975, and a revival, ''The All-New Jeopardy!'', ran on NBC from October 1978 to March 1979. The current version, a daily syndicated show produced by [[Sony Pictures Television]], premiered on September 10, 1984.\n\nBoth NBC versions and the weekly syndicated version were hosted by [[Art Fleming]]. [[Don Pardo]] served as announcer until 1975, and [[John Harlan (announcer)|John Harlan]] announced for the 1978\u20131979 season. Since its inception, the daily syndicated version has featured [[Alex Trebek]] as host and [[Johnny Gilbert]] as announcer.\n\nWith over 8,000 episodes aired,<ref name=\"Jeopardy 8000\">{{cite web|url=https://abc7chicago.com/entertainment/james-holzhauer-reaches-new-jeopardy-winnings-milestone/5315851/|title='Jeopardy!'

The contestants compete in a quiz game comprising three rounds: Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy!, and Final Jeopardy!{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The material for the clues covers a wide variety of topics, including history and current events, the sciences, the arts, popular culture, literature, and languages.{{Sfn|Eisenberg|1993}} Category titles often feature puns, wordplay, or shared themes, and the host will regularly remind contestants of topics or place emphasis on category themes before the start of the round.\n\nAll clues in the show are presented as \"answers\", and responses must be phrased in the form of a question.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} For example, if a contestant were to select \"Presidents for $200\", the resulting clue could be \"This 'Father of Our Country' didn't really chop down a cherry tree\", to which the correct response would be \"Who is/was [[George Washington]]?\" (Contestants are free to phrase the response in the form of any question; the traditional phrasing of \"who is/are\" for people or \"what is/are\" for things or words is almost always used.) When the correct response is the name of a person, the [[surname]] is sufficient except in categories where the host explicitly states the full name is required or the surname is not sufficiently unambiguous. \n\n===First two rounds===\n[[File:Jeopardy game board.png|thumb|255px|left|The layout of the ''Jeopardy!'' game board since November 26, 2001, showing the dollar values used in the first round. Categories at the top of the board vary between each round and episode.]]\n\nThe Jeopardy! and Double Jeopardy! rounds each feature six categories, each of which contains five clues, which are ostensibly valued by difficulty.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The dollar values of the clues increased over time. On the original ''Jeopardy!'' series, clue values in the first round ranged from $10 to $50.{{Sfn|Harris|2006|p=13}} On ''The All-New Jeopardy!'', they ranged from $25\u2013$125. In the two pilots that led to the current series, the first kept the $25\u2013$125 values for the Jeopardy! round, while the second doubled these to $50\u2013$250. The current series' first round originally ranged from $100\u2013$500 (doubled again from the second pilot),{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} and was doubled to $200\u2013$1,000 on November 26, 2001.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Show No. 3966 (Harold Skinner vs. Geoffrey Zimmermann vs. Kristin Lawhead)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|airdate=November 26, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe Jeopardy! round begins when the returning champion selects any position on the game board. The underlying clue is revealed and read aloud by the host, after which any contestant may ring-in using a [[lock-out device|hand-held signaling device]]. The first contestant to ring-in successfully is prompted to provide a response to the clue. If the contestant responds correctly, the clue's dollar value is added to the contestant's score, and they may select a new clue from the board. An incorrect response, or a failure to respond within five seconds, deducts the clue's value from the contestant's score and allows the other contestants the opportunity to ring in and respond. If the response is not technically incorrect but otherwise judged to be too vague to be deemed the correct response, the contestant is given additional time to provide a more specific response.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} Whenever none of the contestants ring in and respond correctly, the host gives the correct response and the \"last correct questioner\" chooses the next clue.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\">{{Cite book|title=Jeopardy! DVD Home Game System Instruction Booklet|year=2007|publisher=[[MGA Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\nContestants are encouraged to select the clues in order from lowest to highest value, as the show's writers write the clues in each category to flow from one to the next, as is the case with game shows that ask questions in a linear string. Contestants are not required to do so unless the category requires clues to be taken in order; the \"Forrest Bounce\", a strategy in which contestants randomly pick clues to confuse opponents, has been used successfully by [[Arthur Chu]] and the strategy's namesake [[Chuck Forrest]], despite Trebek noting that the strategy not only annoys him but staffers as well since it also disrupts the rhythm that develops when revealing the clues and increases the potential for error.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Marchese|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/alex-trebek-jeopardy-in-conversation.html|title=In Conversation: Alex Trebek|work=Vulture.com|date=November 12, 2018|accessdate=November 13, 2018|quote=What bothers me is when contestants jump all over the board even after the Daily Doubles have been dealt with. Why are they doing that? They\u2019re doing themselves a disservice. When the show's writers construct categories they do it so that there's a flow in terms of difficulty, and if you jump to the bottom of the category you may get a clue that would be easier to understand if you\u2019d begun at the top of the category and saw how the clues worked.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113001332/https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/alex-trebek-jeopardy-in-conversation.html|archive-date=November 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Another unorthodox strategy is to sweep through the highest values on the board first; if successful, this has several advantages: the player will have more money to wager on Daily Doubles, and other players will have to answer more questions correctly to earn the same amount of money. [[James Holzhauer]], whose April\u2013June 2019 winning streak included the ten highest single-day money totals in the show's history, regularly used this strategy, in conjunction with the Forrest Bounce and aggressive Daily Double wagering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/jeopardy-winner-james-holzhauer-sets-sights-new-record-t152397|title=A Las Vegas pro gambler is rewriting the 'Jeopardy!' record book \u2014 here's how|first=Scott|last=Stump|work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]|date=April 18, 2019|accessdate=April 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190420122141/https://www.today.com/popculture/jeopardy-winner-james-holzhauer-sets-sights-new-record-t152397|archive-date=April 20, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFrom the premiere of the original ''Jeopardy!'' until the end of the first season of the current syndicated series, contestants were allowed to ring in as soon as the clue was revealed. Since September 1985, contestants are required to wait until the clue is read before ringing in. To accommodate the rule change, lights were added to the game board (unseen by home viewers) to signify when it is permissible for contestants to signal;{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=59\u201360}} attempting to signal before the light goes on locks the contestant out for half of a second.{{Sfn|Richmond|2004|p=41}} The change was made to allow the home audience to play along with the show more easily and to keep an extremely fast contestant from potentially dominating the game. In pre-1985 episodes, a buzzer would sound when a contestant signaled; according to Trebek, the buzzer was eliminated because it was \"distracting to the viewers\" and sometimes presented a problem when contestants rang in while Trebek was still reading the clue.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=59\u201360}} Contestants who are visually impaired or blind are given a card with the category names printed in [[Braille]] before each round begins, and an audible tone is played after the clue has been read aloud. The second round, Double Jeopardy!, features six new categories of clues. Clue values are doubled from the Jeopardy! round.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The contestant with the least amount of money at the end of the Jeopardy! round makes the first selection in the Double Jeopardy! round;<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> if there is a tie, the tied contestant standing at the leftmost lectern (from the host's perspective) selects first.\n\nA \"Daily Double\" is hidden behind one clue in the Jeopardy! round, and two in Double Jeopardy!{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The name and inspiration were taken from a [[horse racing]] [[Daily double|term]].{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=2\u20133}} Daily Double clues with a sound or video component are known as \"Audio Daily Doubles\" and \"Video Daily Doubles\" respectively. Before the clue is revealed, the contestant who selects the Daily Double must declare a wager, from a minimum of $5 to a maximum of his/her entire score (known as a \"true Daily Double\") or the highest clue value available in the round, whichever is greater.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/><ref name=\"5-rules\">{{cite web|title=5 Rules Every Jeopardy!

Not answering the Daily Double also deducts the wager. Whether or not the contestant responds correctly, he or she chooses the next clue.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> Daily Doubles are usually hidden behind higher-valued questions, and almost never on the top row (only eight of the over 11,000 Daily Doubles since November 2001, 0.07%, have been in that location).<ref>{{cite web|title=Where are Daily Doubles located?|work=FiveThirtyEight|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/roeder-jeopardy-3.png?w=1150|accessdate=May 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424161628/https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/roeder-jeopardy-3.png?w=1150|archive-date=April 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Jeopardy! round, except in response to the Daily Double clue, contestants are not penalized for forgetting to phrase their response in the form of a question, although the host will remind contestants to watch their phrasing in future responses. In the Double Jeopardy! round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, with a response not phrased in the form of a question counting as wrong if it is not re-phrased before the host or judges make a ruling.<ref name=\"5-rules\" />\n\nIf it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be correct or incorrect during the taping of an episode, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity (typically after the Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy! rounds, the first break, or a Daily Double break). If it occurs after taping of an episode is completed, the affected contestant(s) are invited back to compete on a future show, complying with federal quiz show regulations.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=64}}\n\nContestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with $0 or a negative score are automatically eliminated from the game at that point and awarded the third-place prize.

At the end of the Double Jeopardy! round, the host announces the Final Jeopardy! category and a commercial break follows. During the break, partitions are placed between the contestant lecterns, and each contestant makes a final wager; they may wager any amount of their earnings, but may not wager certain numbers with connotations that are deemed inappropriate ([[69 (sex position)|69]], [[Number of the Beast|666]], and [[Fourteen Words|1488]] are among the forbidden wagers, though [[Triskadekaphobia|13]], [[420 (cannabis culture)|420]], and [[September 11 attacks|911]] are allowed).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/jeopardy-players-cant-wagers-nodding-144821770.html |title='Jeopardy' players aren't allowed to make wagers referencing sex, Nazis, or Satan |access-date=May 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501121047/https://news.yahoo.com/jeopardy-players-cant-wagers-nodding-144821770.html |archive-date=May 1, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Contestants write their wagers using a [[light pen]] on an electronic display on their lectern.{{Sfn|Dutta|1999|p=xxix}} After the break, the Final Jeopardy! clue is revealed and read by the host. The contestants have 30 seconds to write their responses on the electronic display, while the show's iconic [[Jeopardy!#Theme music|\"Think!\" music]] plays in the background. In the event that either the display or the pen malfunctions, contestants can use an [[index card]] and a marker to manually write their response and wager. Visually impaired or blind contestants use a [[Braille]] keyboard to type in a wager and response.\n\nIn the rare occurrences where there is only one contestant remaining, that contestant automatically wins unless (s)he wagers his or her entire score (which has never been attempted in such a situation) and loses. Otherwise, contestants' responses are revealed in order of their pre-Final Jeopardy! scores from lowest to highest. Players who are tied after Double Jeopardy! have their responses revealed from right to left from the viewer's perspective. As soon as the first correct response is revealed the host confirms it to be so, usually including some brief context, otherwise, the host only reveals the correct response with context after all responses are revealed to be incorrect. A correct response adds the amount of the contestant's wager to his/her score, while a miss, failure to respond, insufficiently specific response or failure to phrase the response as a question (even if correct) deducts it.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> Misspelling is not penalized so long as the spelling does not affect the pronunciation of the word.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://jeremiahstanghini.com/2013/08/05/the-official-final-jeopardy-spelling-rules/ |title=The Official Final Jeopardy Spelling Rules [UPDATED] |date=August 5, 2013 |accessdate=October 31, 2019 |first=Jeremiah |last=Stanghini}}</ref>\n\nThe contestant with the highest score at the end of the round is that day's winner. If there is a tie for second place, consolation prizes are awarded based on the scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round. If all three contestants finish with $0, no one returns as champion for the next show, and based on scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round, the two contestants who were first and second will receive the second-place prize, and the contestant in third will receive the third-place prize.\n\nThe strategy for wagering in Final Jeopardy! has been studied. If the leader's score is more than twice the second place contestant's score, the leader can guarantee victory by making a sufficiently small wager.<ref name=\"gilbert-hatcher\">{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=George T.|last2=Hatcher|first2=Rhonda L.|title=Wagering in Final Jeopardy!|journal=Mathematics Magazine|date=October 1, 1994|volume=67|issue=4|pages=268|doi=10.2307/2690846|jstor=2690846}}</ref>{{rp|269}} Otherwise, according to ''Jeopardy!''

The show pays for travel for returning champions and players invited back because of errors who must make multiple trips to Los Angeles. If a tournament travels (does not stay in Los Angeles) on the second week, the show pays for travel.{{Sfn|Jennings|2006|p=122}}\n\nDuring Art Fleming's hosting run, all three contestants received their winnings in cash (contestants who finished with a negative score were not required to pay) and parting gifts, usually an encyclopedia set. This was changed at the start of Trebek's hosting run to avoid the problem of contestants who would stop participating in the game, or avoid wagering in Final Jeopardy!, rather than risk losing the money they had already won; this also allowed the show to increase the clue values since only one contestant's score would have to be paid instead of three.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=57}} From 1984 to 2002, non-winning contestants on the Trebek version received vacation packages and merchandise, which were donated by manufacturers as promotional consideration. Since 2004, a presenting sponsor has provided cash prizes to the losing contestants ({{as of|2019}}, [[GEICO]] serves as the presenting sponsor of the consolation prizes, except for the Tournaments, which are sponsored by [[Consumer Cellular]]).{{Sfn|Mogel|2004|p=148}}\n\n===Returning champions===\nThe winner of each episode returns to compete against two new contestants on the next episode.

In all situations with three new contestants (most notably, unseeded tournaments in the first round), the draw will also determine who will take the champion's position and select first to start the game. (The player scoring the highest in the preceding round will be given the chance to select first in the semi-final and finals.)\n\n===Variations for tournament play===\nTournaments generally run for 10 consecutive episodes and feature 15 contestants. The first five episodes, the quarter-finals, feature three new contestants each day. Other than in the Tournament of Champions, the quarter-finals are unseeded and contestants participate in a random draw to determine playing order and lectern positions over the course of the five games. The Tournament of Champions is seeded based on total winnings in regular games to determine playing order and lectern positions, with the top five players occupying the champion's lectern for the quarter-final games.\n\nThe winners of the five quarter-final games and the four highest-scoring non-winners (\"wild cards\"), advance to the semi-finals, which run for three days. The semi-finals are seeded with the quarter-final winners being seeded 1\u20135 based on their quarter-final scores and the wild cards being seeded 6\u20139. The winners of the quarter-final games with the three highest scores occupy the champion's lectern for the semi-finals. The winners of the three semi-final games advance to play in a two-game final match, in which the scores from both games are combined to determine the overall standings. This format has been used since the first Tournament of Champions in 1985 and was devised by Trebek himself.{{Sfn|Eisenberg|1993|p=75}}\n\nTo prevent later contestants from playing to beat the earlier wild card scores instead of playing to win, contestants are \"completely isolated from the studio until it is their time to compete\".{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=174}}\n\nIf there is a tie for the final wild-card position, the non-winner that advances will be based on the same regulations as two contestants who tie for second; the tie-breaker is the contestant's score after the Double Jeopardy! round, and if further tied, the score after the Jeopardy! round determines the contestant who advances as the wild card.\n\nIf two or more contestants tie for the highest score (greater than zero) at the end of the match (first round, semi-final game, or end of a two-game final), the standard tiebreaker is used. However, if two or more contestants tie for the highest score at the end of the first game of a two-game final, no tiebreaker is played.\n\nIf none of the contestants in a quarter-final or semi-final game end with a positive score, no contestant automatically qualifies from that game, and an additional wild card contestant advances instead.<ref name=\"Teen Tournament Semifinal\">{{Cite episode|title=Teen Tournament Semi-final Game 2 (Tori Amos vs. Joe Vertnik vs. Kelton Ellis)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|date=February 7, 2013}}</ref> This occurred in the quarter-finals of the 1991 Seniors Tournament and the semi-finals of the 2013 Teen Tournament.<ref name=\"Teen Tournament Semifinal\"/>\n\nIn the finals, contestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with a $0 or negative score on either day do not play Final Jeopardy! that day. Their score for that leg is recorded as $0.\n\n==Conception and development==\nIn a 1964 [[Associated Press]] profile released shortly before the original ''Jeopardy!'' series premiered, [[Merv Griffin]] offered the following account of how he created the quiz show:\n{{quote|My wife Julann just came up with the idea one day when we were in a plane bringing us back to [[New York City]] from [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]].

The show features a [[quiz]] competition in which contestants are presented with [[general knowledge]] clues in the form of answers, and must phrase their responses in the form of questions. The original daytime version debuted on [[NBC]] on March 30, 1964, and aired until January 3, 1975. A weekly nighttime [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] edition aired from September 1974 to September 1975, and a revival, ''The All-New Jeopardy!'', ran on NBC from October 1978 to March 1979. The current version, a daily syndicated show produced by [[Sony Pictures Television]], premiered on September 10, 1984.\n\nBoth NBC versions and the weekly syndicated version were hosted by [[Art Fleming]]. [[Don Pardo]] served as announcer until 1975, and [[John Harlan (announcer)|John Harlan]] announced for the 1978\u20131979 season. Since its inception, the daily syndicated version has featured [[Alex Trebek]] as host and [[Johnny Gilbert]] as announcer.\n\nWith over 8,000 episodes aired,<ref name=\"Jeopardy 8000\">{{cite web|url=https://abc7chicago.com/entertainment/james-holzhauer-reaches-new-jeopardy-winnings-milestone/5315851/|title='Jeopardy!'

The contestants compete in a quiz game comprising three rounds: Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy!, and Final Jeopardy!{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The material for the clues covers a wide variety of topics, including history and current events, the sciences, the arts, popular culture, literature, and languages.{{Sfn|Eisenberg|1993}} Category titles often feature puns, wordplay, or shared themes, and the host will regularly remind contestants of topics or place emphasis on category themes before the start of the round.\n\nAll clues in the show are presented as \"answers\", and responses must be phrased in the form of a question.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} For example, if a contestant were to select \"Presidents for $200\", the resulting clue could be \"This 'Father of Our Country' didn't really chop down a cherry tree\", to which the correct response would be \"Who is/was [[George Washington]]?\" (Contestants are free to phrase the response in the form of any question; the traditional phrasing of \"who is/are\" for people or \"what is/are\" for things or words is almost always used.) When the correct response is the name of a person, the [[surname]] is sufficient except in categories where the host explicitly states the full name is required or the surname is not sufficiently unambiguous. \n\n===First two rounds===\n[[File:Jeopardy game board.png|thumb|255px|left|The layout of the ''Jeopardy!'' game board since November 26, 2001, showing the dollar values used in the first round. Categories at the top of the board vary between each round and episode.]]\n\nThe Jeopardy! and Double Jeopardy! rounds each feature six categories, each of which contains five clues, which are ostensibly valued by difficulty.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The dollar values of the clues increased over time. On the original ''Jeopardy!'' series, clue values in the first round ranged from $10 to $50.{{Sfn|Harris|2006|p=13}} On ''The All-New Jeopardy!'', they ranged from $25\u2013$125. In the two pilots that led to the current series, the first kept the $25\u2013$125 values for the Jeopardy! round, while the second doubled these to $50\u2013$250. The current series' first round originally ranged from $100\u2013$500 (doubled again from the second pilot),{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} and was doubled to $200\u2013$1,000 on November 26, 2001.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Show No. 3966 (Harold Skinner vs. Geoffrey Zimmermann vs. Kristin Lawhead)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|airdate=November 26, 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe Jeopardy! round begins when the returning champion selects any position on the game board. The underlying clue is revealed and read aloud by the host, after which any contestant may ring-in using a [[lock-out device|hand-held signaling device]]. The first contestant to ring-in successfully is prompted to provide a response to the clue. If the contestant responds correctly, the clue's dollar value is added to the contestant's score, and they may select a new clue from the board. An incorrect response, or a failure to respond within five seconds, deducts the clue's value from the contestant's score and allows the other contestants the opportunity to ring in and respond. If the response is not technically incorrect but otherwise judged to be too vague to be deemed the correct response, the contestant is given additional time to provide a more specific response.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} Whenever none of the contestants ring in and respond correctly, the host gives the correct response and the \"last correct questioner\" chooses the next clue.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\">{{Cite book|title=Jeopardy! DVD Home Game System Instruction Booklet|year=2007|publisher=[[MGA Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\nContestants are encouraged to select the clues in order from lowest to highest value, as the show's writers write the clues in each category to flow from one to the next, as is the case with game shows that ask questions in a linear string. Contestants are not required to do so unless the category requires clues to be taken in order; the \"Forrest Bounce\", a strategy in which contestants randomly pick clues to confuse opponents, has been used successfully by [[Arthur Chu]] and the strategy's namesake [[Chuck Forrest]], despite Trebek noting that the strategy not only annoys him but staffers as well since it also disrupts the rhythm that develops when revealing the clues and increases the potential for error.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Marchese|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/alex-trebek-jeopardy-in-conversation.html|title=In Conversation: Alex Trebek|work=Vulture.com|date=November 12, 2018|accessdate=November 13, 2018|quote=What bothers me is when contestants jump all over the board even after the Daily Doubles have been dealt with. Why are they doing that? They\u2019re doing themselves a disservice. When the show's writers construct categories they do it so that there's a flow in terms of difficulty, and if you jump to the bottom of the category you may get a clue that would be easier to understand if you\u2019d begun at the top of the category and saw how the clues worked.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113001332/https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/alex-trebek-jeopardy-in-conversation.html|archive-date=November 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Another unorthodox strategy is to sweep through the highest values on the board first; if successful, this has several advantages: the player will have more money to wager on Daily Doubles, and other players will have to answer more questions correctly to earn the same amount of money. [[James Holzhauer]], whose April\u2013June 2019 winning streak included the ten highest single-day money totals in the show's history, regularly used this strategy, in conjunction with the Forrest Bounce and aggressive Daily Double wagering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/jeopardy-winner-james-holzhauer-sets-sights-new-record-t152397|title=A Las Vegas pro gambler is rewriting the 'Jeopardy!' record book \u2014 here's how|first=Scott|last=Stump|work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]|date=April 18, 2019|accessdate=April 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190420122141/https://www.today.com/popculture/jeopardy-winner-james-holzhauer-sets-sights-new-record-t152397|archive-date=April 20, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFrom the premiere of the original ''Jeopardy!'' until the end of the first season of the current syndicated series, contestants were allowed to ring in as soon as the clue was revealed. Since September 1985, contestants are required to wait until the clue is read before ringing in. To accommodate the rule change, lights were added to the game board (unseen by home viewers) to signify when it is permissible for contestants to signal;{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=59\u201360}} attempting to signal before the light goes on locks the contestant out for half of a second.{{Sfn|Richmond|2004|p=41}} The change was made to allow the home audience to play along with the show more easily and to keep an extremely fast contestant from potentially dominating the game. In pre-1985 episodes, a buzzer would sound when a contestant signaled; according to Trebek, the buzzer was eliminated because it was \"distracting to the viewers\" and sometimes presented a problem when contestants rang in while Trebek was still reading the clue.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=59\u201360}} Contestants who are visually impaired or blind are given a card with the category names printed in [[Braille]] before each round begins, and an audible tone is played after the clue has been read aloud. The second round, Double Jeopardy!, features six new categories of clues. Clue values are doubled from the Jeopardy! round.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The contestant with the least amount of money at the end of the Jeopardy! round makes the first selection in the Double Jeopardy! round;<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> if there is a tie, the tied contestant standing at the leftmost lectern (from the host's perspective) selects first.\n\nA \"Daily Double\" is hidden behind one clue in the Jeopardy! round, and two in Double Jeopardy!{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} The name and inspiration were taken from a [[horse racing]] [[Daily double|term]].{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|pp=2\u20133}} Daily Double clues with a sound or video component are known as \"Audio Daily Doubles\" and \"Video Daily Doubles\" respectively. Before the clue is revealed, the contestant who selects the Daily Double must declare a wager, from a minimum of $5 to a maximum of his/her entire score (known as a \"true Daily Double\") or the highest clue value available in the round, whichever is greater.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/><ref name=\"5-rules\">{{cite web|title=5 Rules Every Jeopardy!

Not answering the Daily Double also deducts the wager. Whether or not the contestant responds correctly, he or she chooses the next clue.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> Daily Doubles are usually hidden behind higher-valued questions, and almost never on the top row (only eight of the over 11,000 Daily Doubles since November 2001, 0.07%, have been in that location).<ref>{{cite web|title=Where are Daily Doubles located?|work=FiveThirtyEight|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/roeder-jeopardy-3.png?w=1150|accessdate=May 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424161628/https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/roeder-jeopardy-3.png?w=1150|archive-date=April 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Jeopardy! round, except in response to the Daily Double clue, contestants are not penalized for forgetting to phrase their response in the form of a question, although the host will remind contestants to watch their phrasing in future responses. In the Double Jeopardy! round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, with a response not phrased in the form of a question counting as wrong if it is not re-phrased before the host or judges make a ruling.<ref name=\"5-rules\" />\n\nIf it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be correct or incorrect during the taping of an episode, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity (typically after the Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy! rounds, the first break, or a Daily Double break). If it occurs after taping of an episode is completed, the affected contestant(s) are invited back to compete on a future show, complying with federal quiz show regulations.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=64}}\n\nContestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with $0 or a negative score are automatically eliminated from the game at that point and awarded the third-place prize. On at least one episode hosted by Art Fleming, all three contestants finished Double Jeopardy! with $0 or less, and as a result, no Final Jeopardy! round was played.{{Sfn|Fabe|1979}} This rule is still in place for the Trebek version, although staff has suggested that it is not set in stone and that executive producer [[Harry Friedman]] may decide to display the clue for home viewers' play if such a situation were ever to occur.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jeopardy.com/jbuzz/features/four-rare-jeopardy-scenarios |title=Breaking Down Four Rare ''Jeopardy!''

During the break, partitions are placed between the contestant lecterns, and each contestant makes a final wager; they may wager any amount of their earnings, but may not wager certain numbers with connotations that are deemed inappropriate ([[69 (sex position)|69]], [[Number of the Beast|666]], and [[Fourteen Words|1488]] are among the forbidden wagers, though [[Triskadekaphobia|13]], [[420 (cannabis culture)|420]], and [[September 11 attacks|911]] are allowed).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/jeopardy-players-cant-wagers-nodding-144821770.html |title='Jeopardy' players aren't allowed to make wagers referencing sex, Nazis, or Satan |access-date=May 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501121047/https://news.yahoo.com/jeopardy-players-cant-wagers-nodding-144821770.html |archive-date=May 1, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Contestants write their wagers using a [[light pen]] on an electronic display on their lectern.{{Sfn|Dutta|1999|p=xxix}} After the break, the Final Jeopardy! clue is revealed and read by the host. The contestants have 30 seconds to write their responses on the electronic display, while the show's iconic [[Jeopardy!#Theme music|\"Think!\" music]] plays in the background. In the event that either the display or the pen malfunctions, contestants can use an [[index card]] and a marker to manually write their response and wager. Visually impaired or blind contestants use a [[Braille]] keyboard to type in a wager and response.\n\nIn the rare occurrences where there is only one contestant remaining, that contestant automatically wins unless (s)he wagers his or her entire score (which has never been attempted in such a situation) and loses. Otherwise, contestants' responses are revealed in order of their pre-Final Jeopardy! scores from lowest to highest. Players who are tied after Double Jeopardy! have their responses revealed from right to left from the viewer's perspective. As soon as the first correct response is revealed the host confirms it to be so, usually including some brief context, otherwise, the host only reveals the correct response with context after all responses are revealed to be incorrect. A correct response adds the amount of the contestant's wager to his/her score, while a miss, failure to respond, insufficiently specific response or failure to phrase the response as a question (even if correct) deducts it.<ref name=\"Gameplay rules\"/> Misspelling is not penalized so long as the spelling does not affect the pronunciation of the word.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://jeremiahstanghini.com/2013/08/05/the-official-final-jeopardy-spelling-rules/ |title=The Official Final Jeopardy Spelling Rules [UPDATED] |date=August 5, 2013 |accessdate=October 31, 2019 |first=Jeremiah |last=Stanghini}}</ref>\n\nThe contestant with the highest score at the end of the round is that day's winner. If there is a tie for second place, consolation prizes are awarded based on the scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round. If all three contestants finish with $0, no one returns as champion for the next show, and based on scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round, the two contestants who were first and second will receive the second-place prize, and the contestant in third will receive the third-place prize.\n\nThe strategy for wagering in Final Jeopardy! has been studied. If the leader's score is more than twice the second place contestant's score, the leader can guarantee victory by making a sufficiently small wager.<ref name=\"gilbert-hatcher\">{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=George T.|last2=Hatcher|first2=Rhonda L.|title=Wagering in Final Jeopardy!|journal=Mathematics Magazine|date=October 1, 1994|volume=67|issue=4|pages=268|doi=10.2307/2690846|jstor=2690846}}</ref>{{rp|269}} Otherwise, according to ''Jeopardy!''

In the case of a tie, all tying top scorers were paid their winnings.{{Sfn|Newcomb|2004|pp=1222\u20131224}} Non-winners receive consolation prizes instead of their winnings in the game. Since May 16, 2002, consolation prizes have been $2,000 for the second-place contestant(s) and $1,000 for the third-place contestant.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Show No. 4089 (Ronnie O'Rourke vs. Ben Tritle vs. Allison Owens)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|date=May 16, 2002}}</ref> Since the show does not generally provide travel or lodging for contestants, cash consolation prizes offset these costs. The show pays for travel for returning champions and players invited back because of errors who must make multiple trips to Los Angeles. If a tournament travels (does not stay in Los Angeles) on the second week, the show pays for travel.{{Sfn|Jennings|2006|p=122}}\n\nDuring Art Fleming's hosting run, all three contestants received their winnings in cash (contestants who finished with a negative score were not required to pay) and parting gifts, usually an encyclopedia set. This was changed at the start of Trebek's hosting run to avoid the problem of contestants who would stop participating in the game, or avoid wagering in Final Jeopardy!, rather than risk losing the money they had already won; this also allowed the show to increase the clue values since only one contestant's score would have to be paid instead of three.{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=57}} From 1984 to 2002, non-winning contestants on the Trebek version received vacation packages and merchandise, which were donated by manufacturers as promotional consideration. Since 2004, a presenting sponsor has provided cash prizes to the losing contestants ({{as of|2019}}, [[GEICO]] serves as the presenting sponsor of the consolation prizes, except for the Tournaments, which are sponsored by [[Consumer Cellular]]).{{Sfn|Mogel|2004|p=148}}\n\n===Returning champions===\nThe winner of each episode returns to compete against two new contestants on the next episode. Originally, a contestant who won five consecutive days retired undefeated and was guaranteed a spot in the Tournament of Champions; the five-day limit was eliminated at the beginning of season 20 on September 8, 2003.<ref>{{Cite press release|title=''Jeopardy!''

In all situations with three new contestants (most notably, unseeded tournaments in the first round), the draw will also determine who will take the champion's position and select first to start the game. (The player scoring the highest in the preceding round will be given the chance to select first in the semi-final and finals.)\n\n===Variations for tournament play===\nTournaments generally run for 10 consecutive episodes and feature 15 contestants. The first five episodes, the quarter-finals, feature three new contestants each day. Other than in the Tournament of Champions, the quarter-finals are unseeded and contestants participate in a random draw to determine playing order and lectern positions over the course of the five games. The Tournament of Champions is seeded based on total winnings in regular games to determine playing order and lectern positions, with the top five players occupying the champion's lectern for the quarter-final games.\n\nThe winners of the five quarter-final games and the four highest-scoring non-winners (\"wild cards\"), advance to the semi-finals, which run for three days. The semi-finals are seeded with the quarter-final winners being seeded 1\u20135 based on their quarter-final scores and the wild cards being seeded 6\u20139. The winners of the quarter-final games with the three highest scores occupy the champion's lectern for the semi-finals. The winners of the three semi-final games advance to play in a two-game final match, in which the scores from both games are combined to determine the overall standings. This format has been used since the first Tournament of Champions in 1985 and was devised by Trebek himself.{{Sfn|Eisenberg|1993|p=75}}\n\nTo prevent later contestants from playing to beat the earlier wild card scores instead of playing to win, contestants are \"completely isolated from the studio until it is their time to compete\".{{Sfn|Trebek|Barsocchini|1990|p=174}}\n\nIf there is a tie for the final wild-card position, the non-winner that advances will be based on the same regulations as two contestants who tie for second; the tie-breaker is the contestant's score after the Double Jeopardy! round, and if further tied, the score after the Jeopardy! round determines the contestant who advances as the wild card.\n\nIf two or more contestants tie for the highest score (greater than zero) at the end of the match (first round, semi-final game, or end of a two-game final), the standard tiebreaker is used. However, if two or more contestants tie for the highest score at the end of the first game of a two-game final, no tiebreaker is played.\n\nIf none of the contestants in a quarter-final or semi-final game end with a positive score, no contestant automatically qualifies from that game, and an additional wild card contestant advances instead.<ref name=\"Teen Tournament Semifinal\">{{Cite episode|title=Teen Tournament Semi-final Game 2 (Tori Amos vs. Joe Vertnik vs. Kelton Ellis)|series=Jeopardy!|network=Syndicated|date=February 7, 2013}}</ref> This occurred in the quarter-finals of the 1991 Seniors Tournament and the semi-finals of the 2013 Teen Tournament.<ref name=\"Teen Tournament Semifinal\"/>\n\nIn the finals, contestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with a $0 or negative score on either day do not play Final Jeopardy! that day. Their score for that leg is recorded as $0.\n\n==Conception and development==\nIn a 1964 [[Associated Press]] profile released shortly before the original ''Jeopardy!'' series premiered, [[Merv Griffin]] offered the following account of how he created the quiz show:\n{{quote|My wife Julann just came up with the idea one day when we were in a plane bringing us back to [[New York City]] from [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]]. I was mulling over game show ideas, when she noted that there had not been a successful 'question and answer' game on the air since the [[1950s quiz show scandals|quiz show scandals]]. Why not do a switch, and give the answers to the contestant and let them come up with the question? She fired a couple of answers to me: \"5,280\"{{emdash}}and the question of course was 'How many feet in a mile?'. Another was '79 Wistful Vista'; that was [[Fibber McGee and Molly|Fibber and Mollie McGee's]] address.

In 1963, the band gained national prominence with a string of top-ten singles reflecting a [[southern California]] [[youth culture]] of [[surfing]], cars, and romance, dubbed the \"[[California Sound]]\". From 1965, they abandoned beachgoing themes for more personal lyrics and ambitious orchestrations. In 1966, the ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' album and \"[[Good Vibrations]]\" single raised the group's prestige as rock innovators and established the band as symbols of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|nascent counterculture era]]. After [[Collapse of Smile|scrapping]] the album ''[[Smile (Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'' in 1967, Brian's contributions diminished due to his mental health issues. The group's commercial momentum faltered, and despite efforts to maintain an [[experimental music|experimental]] sound, they were dismissed by [[Music journalism#20th century rock criticism|early rock critics]] as the archetypal \"pop music cop-outs\".\n\nCarl took over as the band's musical leader until the late 1970s, during which they rebounded with successful worldwide concert tours. Personal struggles, creative disagreements, and the overshadowing success of the band's [[greatest hits album]]s precipitated their transition into an [[oldies]] act. Dennis drowned in 1983 and Brian soon became estranged from the group. Between the 1990s and 2000s, the members filed numerous lawsuits over royalties, defamation, [[Love v. Wilson|songwriting credits]], and use of the band's name. Following Carl's death from lung cancer in 1998, the group and its corporation ([[Brother Records|Brother Records Inc.]]) granted Love legal rights to [[The Beach Boys (touring band)|tour as \"the Beach Boys\"]]. {{As of|2020}}, Brian and Jardine do not perform with Love's Beach Boys, but remain official members of the band.\n\nThe Beach Boys are one of the most critically acclaimed, commercially successful, and influential bands of all time.<ref name=\"Vogue2015\">{{cite magazine|last1=Seymour|first1=Corey|title=Love & Mercy Does Justice to the Brilliance of Brian Wilson|magazine=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|date=June 5, 2015|url=http://www.vogue.com/13266664/love-and-mercy-brian-wilson/}}</ref> They were one of the earliest self-contained rock bands and one of the few US bands who maintained their success before, during, and after the 1964 [[British Invasion]].

All of these elements combined to create a split fanbase corresponding to two distinct musical markets. One group is the conservative audience who enjoys the band's early singles as a wholesome representation of American popular culture from before the political and social movements brought on in the mid 1960s.

In 1963, the band gained national prominence with a string of top-ten singles reflecting a [[southern California]] [[youth culture]] of [[surfing]], cars, and romance, dubbed the \"[[California Sound]]\". From 1965, they abandoned beachgoing themes for more personal lyrics and ambitious orchestrations. In 1966, the ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' album and \"[[Good Vibrations]]\" single raised the group's prestige as rock innovators and established the band as symbols of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|nascent counterculture era]]. After [[Collapse of Smile|scrapping]] the album ''[[Smile (Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'' in 1967, Brian's contributions diminished due to his mental health issues. The group's commercial momentum faltered, and despite efforts to maintain an [[experimental music|experimental]] sound, they were dismissed by [[Music journalism#20th century rock criticism|early rock critics]] as the archetypal \"pop music cop-outs\".\n\nCarl took over as the band's musical leader until the late 1970s, during which they rebounded with successful worldwide concert tours. Personal struggles, creative disagreements, and the overshadowing success of the band's [[greatest hits album]]s precipitated their transition into an [[oldies]] act. Dennis drowned in 1983 and Brian soon became estranged from the group. Between the 1990s and 2000s, the members filed numerous lawsuits over royalties, defamation, [[Love v. Wilson|songwriting credits]], and use of the band's name. Following Carl's death from lung cancer in 1998, the group and its corporation ([[Brother Records|Brother Records Inc.]]) granted Love legal rights to [[The Beach Boys (touring band)|tour as \"the Beach Boys\"]]. {{As of|2020}}, Brian and Jardine do not perform with Love's Beach Boys, but remain official members of the band.\n\nThe Beach Boys are one of the most critically acclaimed, commercially successful, and influential bands of all time.<ref name=\"Vogue2015\">{{cite magazine|last1=Seymour|first1=Corey|title=Love & Mercy Does Justice to the Brilliance of Brian Wilson|magazine=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|date=June 5, 2015|url=http://www.vogue.com/13266664/love-and-mercy-brian-wilson/}}</ref> They were one of the earliest self-contained rock bands and one of the few US bands who maintained their success before, during, and after the 1964 [[British Invasion]].

They combined, as Jim Miller has put it, \"the instrumental sleekness of [[the Ventures]], the lyric sophistication of Chuck Berry, and the vocal expertise of some weird cross between [[the Lettermen]] and [[Frankie Lymon]] and [[the Teenagers]]\" with lyrics whose images, idioms, and concerns were drawn from the rarefied world of the middle-class white male southern California teenager. ... [But] it was the profound vocal virtuosity of the group, coupled with the obsessional drive and compositional ambitions of their leader, Brian Wilson, that promised their survival after the eventual breaking of fad fever. ... Comparison to other vocally oriented rock groups, such as [[the Association]], shows the Beach Boys' technique to be far superior, almost embarrassingly so. They were so confident of their ability, and of Brian's skill as a producer to enhance it, that they were unafraid of doing sophisticated, [[a cappella]] glee-club arrangements containing multiple [[suspension (music)|suspensions]], passing [[musical form|formations]], complex chords, and both [[chromatic]] and [[enharmonic]] [[modulation (music)|modulations]].{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=34}}}}\n\nThe Beach Boys began as a [[garage band]] playing 1950s style [[rock and roll]],{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=15}} reassembling styles of music such as surf to include [[vocal jazz]] [[jazz harmony|harmony]], which created their unique sound.{{sfn|Zager|2011|p=216}} In addition, they introduced their signature approach to common genres such as the [[pop ballad]] by applying harmonic or formal twists not native to rock and roll.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=35}} Among the distinct elements of the Beach Boys' style were the nasal quality of their singing voices, their use of a falsetto harmony over a driving, locomotive-like melody, and the sudden chiming in of the whole group on a key line.<ref name=\"nasal\">{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=Jonathan|title=The Influence of the Beatles on the Music of Rock & Roll|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kgoYAAAAMAAJ|publisher=Columbia College, Columbia University|date=1966|journal=King's Crown Essays}}</ref> Brian Wilson handled most stages of the group's recording process from the beginning, even though he was not properly credited on most of the early recordings.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=105}}{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=26}}\n\n[[File:1967 Rickenbacker 360-12 12 string electric guitar owned and photographed by Greg Field.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A [[Rickenbacker 360/12]] identical to the 12-string guitar used by Carl Wilson in the early to mid-1960s]]\n\nEarly on, Mike Love sang lead vocals in the rock-oriented songs, while Carl contributed guitar lines on the group's ballads.{{sfn|Miller|1992|p=194}} Jim Miller commented: \"On straight rockers they sang tight harmonies behind Love's lead  ... on ballads, Brian played his [[falsetto]] off against lush, [[jazz]]-tinged voicings, often using (for rock) unorthodox harmonic structures.\"{{sfn|Miller|1992|p=194}} Harrison adds that \"even the least distinguished of the Beach Boys' early uptempo rock 'n' roll songs show traces of structural complexity at some level; Brian was simply too curious and experimental to leave convention alone.\"{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=34}} Although Brian was often dubbed a perfectionist, he was an inexperienced musician, and his understanding of music was mostly self-taught.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|pp=105, 114}} At the lyric stage, he usually worked with Love,{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=73}} whose assertive persona provided youthful swagger that contrasted Brian's explorations in romanticism and sensitivity.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=108}} Luis Sanchez noted a pattern where Brian would spare surfing imagery when working with collaborators outside of his band's circle, in the examples \"[[Lonely Sea]]\" and \"[[In My Room]]\".{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=27}}\n\nBrian's bandmates resented the notion that he was the sole creative force in the group.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=110}} In a 1966 article that asked if \"the Beach Boys rely too much on sound genius Brian\", Carl said that although Brian was the most responsible for their music, every member of the group contributed ideas.{{sfn|Love|2016|pp=146\u2013147}} Mike Love wrote, \"As far as I was concerned, Brian ''was'' a genius, deserving of that recognition.

Their stability, their staying power, and their ability to attract new fans prove as much.\"{{sfn|Curtis|1987|p=101}} Cultural historian [[Kevin Starr]] explains that the group first connected with young Americans specifically for their lyrical interpretation of a mythologized landscape: \"Cars and the beach, surfing, the California Girl, all this fused in the alembic of youth: Here was a way of life, an iconography, already half-released into the chords and multiple tracks of a new sound.\"{{sfn|Starr|2009|p=373}} in [[Robert Christgau]]'s opinion, \"the Beach Boys were a touchstone for real rock and rollers, all of whom understood that the music had its most essential roots in an innocently hedonistic materialism.\"<ref name=\"Christgau1975\"/>\n\nThe group's \"California Sound\" grew to national prominence through the success of their 1963 album ''Surfin' U.S.A.'',{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=32}} which helped turn the surfing subculture into a mainstream youth-targeted advertising image widely exploited by the film, television, and food industry.{{sfn|May|2002|pp=114\u2013115}} The group's surf music was not entirely of their own invention, being preceded by artists such as Dick Dale.{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=13}} However, previous surf musicians did not project a world view as the Beach Boys did.{{sfn|Miller|1992|p=193}} The band's earlier surf music helped raise the profile of the state of California, creating its first major regional style with national significance, and establishing a musical identity for [[Southern California]], as opposed to [[Hollywood]].{{sfn|Curtis|1987|p=103}} California ultimately supplanted New York as the center of popular music thanks to the success of Brian's productions.{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=54\u201355}}\n\n[[File:Little Deuce Coupe.jpg|thumb|right|The 1932 Ford that appeared on the cover to the platinum certified album ''Little Deuce Coupe'']]\n\nA 1966 article discussing new trends in rock music writes that the Beach Boys popularized a type of drum beat heard in Jan and Dean's \"[[Surf City (song)|Surf City]]\", which sounds like a \"a locomotive getting up speed\", in addition to the method of \"suddenly stopping in between the chorus and verse\".<ref name=\"nasal\"/> [[Pete Townshend]] of the Who is credited with coining the term \"[[power pop]]\", which he defined as \"what we play\u2014what the [[Small Faces]] used to play, and the kind of pop the Beach Boys played in the days of 'Fun, Fun, Fun' which I preferred.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Altham |first=Keith |title=Lily Isn't Pornographic, Say Who |journal=[[NME]] |issue=20 May 1967}}</ref>\n\nThe California Sound gradually evolved to reflect a more musically ambitious and mature world view, becoming less to do with surfing and cars and more about social consciousness and political awareness.{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=61\u201362, 83}} Between 1964 and 1969, it fueled innovation and transition, inspiring artists to tackle largely unmentioned themes such as [[sexual freedom]], [[black pride]], [[drugs]], [[Opposition (politics)|oppositional politics]], other [[counterculture of the 1960s|countercultural]] motifs, and [[war]].{{sfn|Shuker|1994|p=35}} [[Sunshine pop|Soft pop]] (later known as \"sunshine pop\") derived in part from this movement.{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=69}} Sunshine pop producers widely imitated the orchestral style of ''Pet Sounds''; however, the Beach Boys themselves were rarely representative of the genre, which was rooted in  [[easy-listening]] and [[Jingle|advertising jingles]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/sunshine-pop-54224|title=Gateways to Geekery: Sunshine Pop|last1=Murray|first1=Noel|date=April 7, 2011|work=[[The A.V.

This divide was further solidified by the difference in sound between their albums and their stage performances.{{sfn|Lambert|2016|p= {{page needed|date=May 2018}}}}  When the band's studio recordings grew more complex, they were unable to effectively reproduce them in their live show.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=187}} Starting in 1966, band publicist Derek Taylor was instrumental in campaigning the idea of Brian Wilson as a \"genius\" to members of the burgeoning rock press, painting him as a mastermind who stays at home composing while the rest of the band tour. All of these elements combined to create a split fanbase corresponding to two distinct musical markets. One group is the conservative audience who enjoys the band's early singles as a wholesome representation of American popular culture from before the political and social movements brought on in the mid 1960s. The other group also appreciates the early songs for their energy and complexity, but not as much as the band's ambitious work that was created during the formative [[psychedelic era]].{{sfn|Lambert|2016|p={{page needed|date=May 2018}}}}\n\nInitially, rock music journalists valued the Beach Boys' early records over their experimental work.{{sfn|Lambert|2016|p=218}}{{refn|group=nb|For example, critics from ''Rolling Stone'' were wary of the group's changing music, with [[Ralph J. Gleason]] writing in January 1968: \"The Beach Boys, when they were a reflection of an actuality of American society (i.e., Southern California hot rod, surfing and beer-bust fraternity culture), made music that had vitality and interest. When they went past that, they were forced inexorably to go into electronics and this excursion, for them, is of limited scope, good as the vibrations were.\"{{sfn|Lambert|2016|p=218}}}} Real surfers were critical of the band for not being true adherents of the sport.

Although the quality of the equipment are likely inferior to the South Korean counterparts, the P'okp'ung-ho is believed to be a considerable threat at medium/short range engagements, although lacking when firing from long ranges at night.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Models==\n* '''Pokpung-Ho I''' - The initial variant.

Although the quality of the equipment are likely inferior to the South Korean counterparts, the P'okp'ung-ho is believed to be a considerable threat at medium/short range engagements, although lacking when firing from long ranges at night.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Models==\n* '''Pokpung-Ho I''' - The initial variant.

[[List of awards and nominations received by Fiona Apple|Her accolades]] include one [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Grammy Award]], and an additional seven Grammy Award nominations in various categories.\n\nThe daughter of actor [[Brandon Maggart]], Apple was born in [[New York City]] but was raised alternating between New York and her father's home in [[Los Angeles]]. Classically trained on piano as a child, she began composing her own songs when she was eight years old. Her debut album, ''[[Tidal (album)|Tidal]]'', containing songs written when she was 17, was released in 1996 and received a Grammy Award for Best Female Vocal Rock Performance for the single \"[[Criminal (Fiona Apple song)|Criminal]]\". She followed with ''[[When the Pawn...]]'' (1999), produced by [[Jon Brion]], which was also critically and commercially successful and was certified platinum.\n\nFor her third album, ''[[Extraordinary Machine]]'' (2005), Apple again collaborated with Brion, and began recording the album in 2002. However, Apple was reportedly unhappy with the production and opted not to release the record, leading fans to protest [[Epic Records]], erroneously believing that the label was withholding its release. The album was eventually re-produced without Brion and released in October 2005. The album was certified [[Gold album|gold]], and nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album]]. In 2012, she released her fourth studio album, ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'', which received critical praise and was followed by a tour of the United States and was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album]] in 2013. Apple's fifth studio album, ''[[Fetch the Bolt Cutters]]'', was released in 2020 to widespread acclaim.\n\nShe has sold over 10 million albums worldwide and has received numerous [[List of awards and nominations received by Fiona Apple|awards and nominations]], including a [[Grammy Award]], 2 [[MTV Video Music Awards]] and a [[Billboard Music Award]].\n\n==Life and career==\n===1977\u20131993: Early life===\nFiona Apple was born Fiona Apple McAfee-Maggart on September 13, 1977 in [[New York City]] to singer Diane McAfee and actor [[Brandon Maggart]], who met when both were cast in the Broadway musical ''[[Applause (musical)|Applause]]''.<ref name=lee>{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Dan P.|archive-url=http://archive.vn/VNey7|archive-date=February 9, 2013|url-status=live|url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/06/hiding-out-with-fiona-apple-musical-hermit.html|title=\u2018I Just Want to Feel Everything\u2019: Hiding Out With Fiona Apple, Musical Hermit|date=June 17, 2012|work=[[Vulture (website)|Vulture]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/05/arts/a-message-far-less-pretty-than-the-face.html | title=A Message Far Less Pretty Than the Face | last=Ehrlich | first=Dimitri | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 5, 1997}}</ref> Her father is from [[Tennessee]], and through him, Apple has [[Melungeon]] ancestry.<ref name=wtf /> Her maternal grandparents were dancer Millicent Green and [[big band]] vocalist Johnny McAfee.

Apple agreed, and Brion went to Apple's label, [[Epic Records]], with strict stipulations (including no deadline), which the label eventually agreed to. Recording sessions began in 2002, at [[Ocean Way studios]] in Nashville, Tennessee, but later moved to the [[Paramour Mansion]] in Los Angeles. Work on the album continued until 2003, and in May of that year it was submitted to Sony executives.

[[List of awards and nominations received by Fiona Apple|Her accolades]] include one [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Grammy Award]], and an additional seven Grammy Award nominations in various categories.\n\nThe daughter of actor [[Brandon Maggart]], Apple was born in [[New York City]] but was raised alternating between New York and her father's home in [[Los Angeles]]. Classically trained on piano as a child, she began composing her own songs when she was eight years old. Her debut album, ''[[Tidal (album)|Tidal]]'', containing songs written when she was 17, was released in 1996 and received a Grammy Award for Best Female Vocal Rock Performance for the single \"[[Criminal (Fiona Apple song)|Criminal]]\". She followed with ''[[When the Pawn...]]'' (1999), produced by [[Jon Brion]], which was also critically and commercially successful and was certified platinum.\n\nFor her third album, ''[[Extraordinary Machine]]'' (2005), Apple again collaborated with Brion, and began recording the album in 2002. However, Apple was reportedly unhappy with the production and opted not to release the record, leading fans to protest [[Epic Records]], erroneously believing that the label was withholding its release. The album was eventually re-produced without Brion and released in October 2005. The album was certified [[Gold album|gold]], and nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album]]. In 2012, she released her fourth studio album, ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'', which received critical praise and was followed by a tour of the United States and was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album]] in 2013. Apple's fifth studio album, ''[[Fetch the Bolt Cutters]]'', was released in 2020 to widespread acclaim.\n\nShe has sold over 10 million albums worldwide and has received numerous [[List of awards and nominations received by Fiona Apple|awards and nominations]], including a [[Grammy Award]], 2 [[MTV Video Music Awards]] and a [[Billboard Music Award]].\n\n==Life and career==\n===1977\u20131993: Early life===\nFiona Apple was born Fiona Apple McAfee-Maggart on September 13, 1977 in [[New York City]] to singer Diane McAfee and actor [[Brandon Maggart]], who met when both were cast in the Broadway musical ''[[Applause (musical)|Applause]]''.<ref name=lee>{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Dan P.|archive-url=http://archive.vn/VNey7|archive-date=February 9, 2013|url-status=live|url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/06/hiding-out-with-fiona-apple-musical-hermit.html|title=\u2018I Just Want to Feel Everything\u2019: Hiding Out With Fiona Apple, Musical Hermit|date=June 17, 2012|work=[[Vulture (website)|Vulture]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/05/arts/a-message-far-less-pretty-than-the-face.html | title=A Message Far Less Pretty Than the Face | last=Ehrlich | first=Dimitri | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 5, 1997}}</ref> Her father is from [[Tennessee]], and through him, Apple has [[Melungeon]] ancestry.<ref name=wtf /> Her maternal grandparents were dancer Millicent Green and [[big band]] vocalist Johnny McAfee.

However, international campaigns called for all camps to be dismantled, and for the people to return to their former villages.

With only a few hundred fighters remaining loyal to him, it was thought that he would be unable to evade capture for much longer.<ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\n===LRA neutralization and U.S. stand-down===\nIn April 2017, Ugandan and US military forces ended their hunt for Kony and his group, with a Ugandan spokesperson stating that \"the LRA no longer poses a threat to us as Uganda\".<ref name=\"Baddorf\"/> At that time, his force was estimated to have shrunk to around 100 soldiers.<ref name=\"Baddorf\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Uganda|Biography}}\n* [[International Criminal Court investigations]]\n* [[Lord's Resistance Army insurgency]]\n* [[List of fugitives from justice who disappeared]]\n* [[Child soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]\n* [http://middleeastinst.libsyn.com/child-soldiers-in-the-middle-east?fbclid=IwAR23lG06WtH794cMztuoTzcLTS5PkdOsw5YCJ0mpj-mllInSNdZNqfqBskI Podcast: Child soldiers in the Middle East and Africa]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist |group=sources |30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last=Briggs |first=Jimmie |author-link=Jimmie Briggs |title=The Innocents Lost: When Child Soldiers Go to War |url=https://archive.org/details/innocentslostwhe0000brig |url-access=registration |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |year=2005 |isbn=0-465-00798-8}}\n* {{cite book | last=Bussman | first=Jane | authorlink=Jane Bussmann | title=The Worst Date Ever: War Crimes, Hollywood Heart-Throbs and Other Abominations | publisher=Macmillan | year=2009 | isbn=978-0-230-73712-9}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv | last=Cline | first=Lawrence E. | authorlink= | title=The Lord's Resistance Army | publisher=ABC-CLIO | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-440-82855-3}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Joseph Kony}}\n* [http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/8/193.c2V0TGFuZz1FTiZMPUVO.html Hague Justice Portal: Joseph Kony]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120309200911/http://www.interpol.int/en/Wanted-Persons/(wanted_id)/2006-26320 Joseph Kony on Interpol's wanted list]\n* [http://jackson.yale.edu/event/screening-of-my-star-in-the-sky-and-qa-with-filmmakers Documentary called ''Lakalatwe'' on a child soldier that escaped the LRA]\n* [https://soflete.com/blogs/knowledge/mick-mulroy-interview An End to Child Soldiers]\n* [http://www.ethnosfilm.tv/en/kevinen/ ''Kevin'' - Documentary on LRA's aftermath in Northern Uganda]\n\n{{ICC indictees (NavBox)}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kony, Joseph}}\n[[Category:1961 births]]\n[[Category:Acholi people]]\n[[Category:Fugitives wanted by the International Criminal Court]]\n[[Category:Fugitives wanted on crimes against humanity charges]]\n[[Category:Fugitives wanted on war crimes charges]]\n[[Category:Individuals designated as terrorists by the United States government]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Lord's Resistance Army rebels]]\n[[Category:People from Gulu District]]\n", "text_old": "{{Pp-pc1|small=yes}}\n{{short description|Leader of the Lord's Resistance Army}}\n{{Citation style|date=October 2018}}\n{{EngvarB|date=December 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2012}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name               = Joseph Kony\n| image              = Joseph Kony 4.jpg\n| image_size         =\n| caption            =\n| birth_name         =\n| birth_date         = likely {{Birth year and age|1961}}<ref name=\"Britannica bio\" />\n| birth_place        = Odek, [[Uganda Protectorate]]<ref name=\"independent\"/>\n| residence          =\n| nationality        = Ugandan\n| other_names        =\n| education          =\n| known_for          = Leader of the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] (LRA)\n| home_town          =\n| height             = 180 cm (5 ft 11 in)<ref name=\"Interpol\">{{cite web | url=http://www.interpol.int/Wanted-Persons/(wanted_id)/2006-26320/ | title=Wanted Persons \u2013 Kony, Joseph | year=2006 | publisher=Interpol | accessdate=13 October 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428193406/http://www.interpol.int/Wanted-Persons/(wanted_id)/2006-26320 | archive-date=28 April 2012 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n| weight             = {{convert|180|lb|kg|order=flip}}\n| children           = 42 (as of 2006)<ref name=\"Debut\">{{cite news |url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2006-02-10-portrait-of-ugandas-rebel-prophet-painted-by-wives |title=Portrait of Uganda's rebel prophet, painted by wives |newspaper=[[Mail & Guardian]] |first=Beatrice |last=Debut |date=10 February 2006 |accessdate=7 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307090825/http://mg.co.za/article/2006-02-10-portrait-of-ugandas-rebel-prophet-painted-by-wives |archive-date=7 March 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n}}\n\n'''Joseph Rao Kony''' ({{IPA-all|ko\u0272|pronounced}};

With only a few hundred fighters remaining loyal to him, it was thought that he would be unable to evade capture for much longer.<ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\n===LRA neutralization and U.S. stand-down===\nIn April 2017, Ugandan and US military forces ended their hunt for Kony and his group, with a Ugandan spokesperson stating that \"the LRA no longer poses a threat to us as Uganda\".<ref name=\"Baddorf\"/> At that time, his force was estimated to have shrunk to around 100 soldiers.<ref name=\"Baddorf\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Uganda|Biography}}\n* [[International Criminal Court investigations]]\n* [[Lord's Resistance Army insurgency]]\n* [[List of fugitives from justice who disappeared]]\n* [[Child soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]\n* [http://middleeastinst.libsyn.com/child-soldiers-in-the-middle-east?fbclid=IwAR23lG06WtH794cMztuoTzcLTS5PkdOsw5YCJ0mpj-mllInSNdZNqfqBskI Podcast: Child soldiers in the Middle East and Africa]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist |group=sources |30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last=Briggs |first=Jimmie |author-link=Jimmie Briggs |title=The Innocents Lost: When Child Soldiers Go to War |url=https://archive.org/details/innocentslostwhe0000brig |url-access=registration |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |year=2005 |isbn=0-465-00798-8}}\n* {{cite book | last=Bussman | first=Jane | authorlink=Jane Bussmann | title=The Worst Date Ever: War Crimes, Hollywood Heart-Throbs and Other Abominations | publisher=Macmillan | year=2009 | isbn=978-0-230-73712-9}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv | last=Cline | first=Lawrence E. | authorlink= | title=The Lord's Resistance Army | publisher=ABC-CLIO | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-440-82855-3}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Joseph Kony}}\n* [http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/8/193.c2V0TGFuZz1FTiZMPUVO.html Hague Justice Portal: Joseph Kony]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120309200911/http://www.interpol.int/en/Wanted-Persons/(wanted_id)/2006-26320 Joseph Kony on Interpol's wanted list]\n* [http://jackson.yale.edu/event/screening-of-my-star-in-the-sky-and-qa-with-filmmakers Documentary called ''Lakalatwe'' on a child soldier that escaped the LRA]\n* [https://soflete.com/blogs/knowledge/mick-mulroy-interview An End to Child Soldiers]\n* [http://www.ethnosfilm.tv/en/kevinen/ ''Kevin'' - Documentary on LRA's aftermath in Northern Uganda]\n\n{{ICC indictees (NavBox)}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kony, Joseph}}\n[[Category:1961 births]]\n[[Category:Acholi people]]\n[[Category:Fugitives wanted by the International Criminal Court]]\n[[Category:Fugitives wanted on crimes against humanity charges]]\n[[Category:Fugitives wanted on war crimes charges]]\n[[Category:Individuals designated as terrorists by the United States government]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Lord's Resistance Army rebels]]\n[[Category:People from Gulu District]]\n", "name_user": "176.28.207.150", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Kony"}

In 1871 his family relocated to [[Chicago]] where Frederick studied under an artist named Sloan, possibly Junius R. Sloan (1827\u20131900), a landscape and portrait painter of the period. In 1882 Walpole left Chicago and journeyed by rail to Southern Oregon to acquire land for a homestead. One of his journals records that on arriving at [[Redding, California]] in the [[Sacramento Valley]] on 22 March, he found the stage fare of $36.00 to [[Jacksonville]] beyond his means. He accordingly freighted his luggage ahead and walked the 177 miles remaining. After combing the area, he settled on land near the present town of [[Trail, Oregon|Trail]] in the [[Crater Lake]] region.\n\nWalpole's known journals do not cover the period 1884 to 1899, but it is known that Walpole's family settled in [[Portland, Oregon]]. where, In 1886 Frederick found employment as illustrator at the Lewis & Dryden Printing Company. In 1891/2 he made the acquaintance of an English girl who was visiting in Oregon and duly married her in England in 1893. Their only child, Sidney, was born in 1894. In 1898 Walpole's wife was struck down by [[typhoid fever]] while in [[Washington, D.C.]] \n\nWalpole's work drew the attention of [[Frederick Vernon Coville]] (1867\u20131937) in 1896. Coville was a [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) botanist and herbarium curator, who at that time was in Oregon documenting plants found useful by the [[Klamath people|Klamath Indians]]. Encouraged by Coville, Walpole applied for the position of artist at USDA's Division of Botany, and was duly appointed on 19 September. His journals record his going on botanical field trips, drawing, botanising, and collecting specimens of plants which he readily identified by their Latin names. In Walpole's obituary it is noted that the Victorian polymath [[John Ruskin]] (1819\u20131900) was a favorite author of his and quite likely inspired and influenced him. <ref>https://www.huntbotanical.org/art/show.php?13</ref>\n\nWalpole's workplace as a botanical illustrator was initially in Washington, D.C., at the [[USDA]], and after November 1902 at the [[Arts and Industries Building|National Museum]] - he also went on field trips to the [[Northwestern United States|Northwest]].
