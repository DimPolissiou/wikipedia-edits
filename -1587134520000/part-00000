{"title_page": "1981 in country music", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Refimprove|date=May 2015}}\n{{no footnotes|date=May 2015}}\n}}\nThis is a list of notable events in country music that took place in the year 1981.\n\n{{YYYY music|1981}}\n{{Year nav topic5|1981|country music}}\n\n==Events==\n*March 14 \u2014 The final showing of ''Live From The Grand Ole Opry'' on the Public Broadcasting System (PBS) occurs on this night. The show actually went beyond the televised segment, but the show was ended with a clip of [[Marty Robbins]] singing \"[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]\" (a song he used to close out his Opry segment at midnight) from the year before. Because of cost over-runs and other technicalities, this was the final run for the annual show on PBS that featured the music of [[Tom T. Hall]], [[Del Reeves]], [[Hank Snow]], [[Roy Acuff]] and [[Minnie Pearl]], and many other performers.\n* October \u2014 ''The Weekly Country Music Countdown'', a three-hour weekly countdown program, debuts. The syndicated program, hosted by radio personality Chris Charles, features the top 30 country hits of the week as reported by ''[[Radio & Records]]'' magazine. The program is a success and the first country music-oriented countdown program to successfully rival the 8-year-old ''[[American Country Countdown]]'' show.\n\n===No dates===\n*''[[The Smithsonian Collection of Classic Country Music]]'', an eight-volume, 143-track collection, is released. The box set is considered one of the first important retrospectives of the genre and contains extensive liner notes, depicting the importance of each song or artist included. Songs included range from 1922's \"Sally Gooden\" to 1975's \"[[Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain]]\" by [[Willie Nelson]]. Specifically, each volume is titled as follows: \"1920's,\" \"1930's Southeast,\" \"1930's Southwest,\" \"1941\u20131953\" (two records), \"1953\u20131963,\" \"Bluegrass\" and \"1963\u20131975.\"\n** Also during the year, the [[Franklin Mint]], as part of its volume series of significant musical recordings, begins issuing a series of country music-focused two-record sets. \"The Greatest Country Music Recordings of All Time\" will eventually spawn 50 different album sets through 1986 (each new volume issued roughly every other month), with each two-album set focusing on a different era, performer or style, topic and so forth, and each volume will have extensive liner notes and vintage photographs.\n\n==Top hits of the year==\n{{See also|List of number-one country singles of 1981

The show actually went beyond the televised segment, but the show was ended with a clip of [[Marty Robbins]] singing \"[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]\" (a song he used to close out his Opry segment at midnight) from the year before. Because of cost over-runs and other technicalities, this was the final run for the annual show on PBS that featured the music of [[Tom T. Hall]], [[Del Reeves]], [[Hank Snow]], [[Roy Acuff]] and [[Minnie Pearl]], and many other performers.\n* October \u2014 ''The Weekly Country Music Countdown'', a three-hour weekly countdown program, debuts. The syndicated program, hosted by radio personality Chris Charles, features the top 30 country hits of the week as reported by ''[[Radio & Records]]'' magazine. The program is a success and the first country music-oriented countdown program to successfully rival the 8-year-old ''[[American Country Countdown]]'' show.\n\n===No dates===\n*''[[The Smithsonian Collection of Classic Country Music]]'', an eight-volume, 143-track collection, is released. The box set is considered one of the first important retrospectives of the genre and contains extensive liner notes, depicting the importance of each song or artist included. Songs included range from 1922's \"Sally Gooden\" to 1975's \"[[Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain]]\" by [[Willie Nelson]]. Specifically, each volume is titled as follows: \"1920's,\" \"1930's Southeast,\" \"1930's Southwest,\" \"1941\u20131953\" (two records), \"1953\u20131963,\" \"Bluegrass\" and \"1963\u20131975.\"\n** Also during the year, the [[Franklin Mint]], as part of its volume series of significant musical recordings, begins issuing a series of country music-focused two-record sets. \"The Greatest Country Music Recordings of All Time\" will eventually spawn 50 different album sets through 1986 (each new volume issued roughly every other month), with each two-album set focusing on a different era, performer or style, topic and so forth, and each volume will have extensive liner notes and vintage photographs.\n\n==Top hits of the year==\n{{See also|List of number-one country singles of 1981

From July 2017 to April 2018, the full-length M terminated at [[Broadway Junction (BMT Jamaica Line)|Broadway Junction]] in Brooklyn, instead of Metropolitan Avenue due to construction on the Myrtle Avenue Line; a limited number of M trains operated between 71st Avenue in Queens and [[Second Avenue station|Second Avenue]] in Manhattan.

Marcy Avenue was originally a local stop, but beginning on February 23, 1960 all trains stopped there. M was assigned to the service in the early 1960s, with a single letter because it was an express service.

It had been expecting a $160 million surplus in 1995, but due to reductions in state and Federal contributions, it was left with a deficit which could reach $172 million. The elimination of midday M service to Brooklyn was part of a larger plan to reduce spending in order to avert a fare increase, which Governor George Pataki and Mayor Rudy Giuliani had pressured the MTA to avoid. Only 4,200 riders used M service to Brooklyn during middays, with fewer than 20 passengers per car, or 80 passengers per train (the M used four-car trains during middays). Because of the low cost effectiveness of operating service to Brooklyn and because of the existence of alternate service on the N and R, it was decided to cut the service. This service cut saved $664,000 annually. Three alternative operating plans were considered: maintaining existing midday service, terminating midday service at Broad Street, and operating service as a shuttle like weekend and late night service. It was decided not to terminate service at Broad Street because it negated a large portion of the crew savings due to the need for personnel to relay trains at the Broad Street terminal, longer running times, and because it had the potential to delay J service, which already terminated there. The shuttle option was dismissed because it would inconvenience a far larger number of M riders.<ref>*{{Cite book|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/48006739687/in/album-72157708930708123/|title=NYC Transit Committee Agenda July 1995|date=July 21, 1994|publisher=New York City Transit|pages=D.294}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/48006650151/in/album-72157708930708123/|title=NYC Transit Committee Agenda July 1995|date=July 21, 1994|publisher=New York City Transit|pages=D.295}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/48006738382/in/album-72157708930708123/|title=NYC Transit Committee Agenda July 1995|date=July 21, 1994|publisher=New York City Transit|pages=D.296}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/48006648801/in/album-72157708930708123/|title=NYC Transit Committee Agenda July 1995|date=July 21, 1994|publisher=New York City Transit|pages=D.297}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/48006655998/in/album-72157708930708123/|title=NYC Transit Committee Agenda July 1995|date=July 21, 1994|publisher=New York City Transit|pages=D.299}}</ref>\n\n====1997\u20132010====\n\n{{Plain image with caption|NYCS-bull-trans-Md brown.svg|Brown M diamond bullet 2001-10.|75px}}\n\nFrom April 1997 to August 1997, during late nights and weekends, the M terminated at Essex Street due to reconstruction of Myrtle Avenue.<ref name=\"erictb.info\"/>\n[[File:R143 opto mikey.jpeg|thumb|left|A [[R143 (New York City Subway car)|R143]] M shuttle train at [[Myrtle Avenue station (BMT Jamaica Line)|Myrtle Avenue-Broadway]].]]\nFrom May 1 to September 1, 1999, the [[Williamsburg Bridge]] subway tracks were closed for reconstruction, splitting M service in two sections.

This, as well as all other proposals, were no longer considered after Albany lawmakers offered financial support to the MTA in May 2009. However, in late 2009, the MTA once again discovered that it was confronting another financial crisis; most of the same service cuts threatened just months earlier were revisited. One proposal included completely phasing out M service and using the {{NYCS|V}} as its replacement. Under this proposal, the V would no longer serve its southern terminus at [[Second Avenue (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|Second Avenue]]. Instead, after leaving [[Broadway\u2013Lafayette Street (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|Broadway\u2013Lafayette Street]], it would run along the Chrystie Street Connection, unused since the elimination of the K in 1976, and stop at the upper (BMT) level of [[Essex Street (BMT Nassau Street Line)|Essex Street]] in Manhattan before serving all M stations to Metropolitan Avenue in Queens.\n[[File:Marty Markowitz, Daniel Squadron, Michael Burke, Paul Nelson.jpg|left|thumb|Brooklyn politicians eulogize the death of the brown M]]\nThe MTA determined that this move, while still a service cut, would actually benefit M riders in northern Brooklyn; approximately 17,000 weekday riders use that route to reach its stations in Lower Manhattan, whereas 22,000 transfer to other routes to reach destinations in Midtown Manhattan. However, only about 10,000 riders in Southern Brooklyn use the M to access the Nassau Street Line.

It had been expecting a $160 million surplus in 1995, but due to reductions in state and Federal contributions, it was left with a deficit which could reach $172 million. The elimination of midday '''M''' service to Brooklyn was part of a larger plan to reduce spending in order to avert a fare increase, which Governor George Pataki and Mayor Rudy Giuliani had pressured the MTA to avoid. Only 4,200 riders used '''M''' service to Brooklyn during middays, with fewer than 20 passengers per car, or 80 passengers per train (the '''M''' used four-car trains during middays). Because of the low cost effectiveness of operating service to Brooklyn and because of the existence of alternate service on the '''N''' and '''R''', it was decided to cut the service. This service cut saved $664,000 annually. Three alternative operating plans were considered: maintaining existing midday service, terminating midday service at Broad Street, and operating service as a shuttle like weekend and late night service. It was decided not to terminate service at Broad Street because it negated a large portion of the crew savings due to the need for personnel to relay trains at the Broad Street terminal, longer running times, and because it had the potential to delay '''J''' service, which already terminated there. The shuttle option was dismissed because it would inconvenience a far larger number of '''M''' riders.<ref>*{{Cite book|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/48006739687/in/album-72157708930708123/|title=NYC Transit Committee Agenda July 1995|date=July 21, 1994|publisher=New York City Transit|pages=D.294}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/48006650151/in/album-72157708930708123/|title=NYC Transit Committee Agenda July 1995|date=July 21, 1994|publisher=New York City Transit|pages=D.295}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/48006738382/in/album-72157708930708123/|title=NYC Transit Committee Agenda July 1995|date=July 21, 1994|publisher=New York City Transit|pages=D.296}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/48006648801/in/album-72157708930708123/|title=NYC Transit Committee Agenda July 1995|date=July 21, 1994|publisher=New York City Transit|pages=D.297}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/48006655998/in/album-72157708930708123/|title=NYC Transit Committee Agenda July 1995|date=July 21, 1994|publisher=New York City Transit|pages=D.299}}</ref>\n\n====1997\u20132010====\n\n{{Plain image with caption|NYCS-bull-trans-Md brown.svg|Brown M diamond bullet 2001-10.|75px}}\n\nFrom April 1997 to August 1997, during late nights and weekends, the '''M''' terminated at Essex Street due to reconstruction of Myrtle Avenue.<ref name=\"erictb.info\"/>\n[[File:R143 opto mikey.jpeg|thumb|left|A [[R143 (New York City Subway car)|R143]] M shuttle train at [[Myrtle Avenue station (BMT Jamaica Line)|Myrtle Avenue-Broadway]].]]\nFrom May 1 to September 1, 1999, the [[Williamsburg Bridge]] subway tracks were closed for reconstruction, splitting '''M''' service in two sections.

This, as well as all other proposals, were no longer considered after Albany lawmakers offered financial support to the MTA in May 2009. However, in late 2009, the MTA once again discovered that it was confronting another financial crisis; most of the same service cuts threatened just months earlier were revisited. One proposal included completely phasing out '''M''' service and using the '''{{NYCS|V}}''' as its replacement. Under this proposal, the '''V''' would no longer serve its southern terminus at [[Second Avenue (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|Second Avenue]]. Instead, after leaving [[Broadway\u2013Lafayette Street (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|Broadway\u2013Lafayette Street]], it would run along the Chrystie Street Connection, unused since the elimination of the '''K''' in 1976, and stop at the upper (BMT) level of [[Essex Street (BMT Nassau Street Line)|Essex Street]] in Manhattan before serving all '''M''' stations to Metropolitan Avenue in Queens.\n[[File:Marty Markowitz, Daniel Squadron, Michael Burke, Paul Nelson.jpg|left|thumb|Brooklyn politicians eulogize the death of the brown '''M''']]\nThe MTA determined that this move, while still a service cut, would actually benefit '''M''' riders in northern Brooklyn; approximately 17,000 weekday riders use that route to reach its stations in Lower Manhattan, whereas 22,000 transfer to other routes to reach destinations in Midtown Manhattan. However, only about 10,000 riders in Southern Brooklyn use the '''M''' to access the Nassau Street Line. This merger opened up new travel options for northern Brooklyn and Queens in that it allowed direct and more convenient access to areas that were not previously served by those routes such as Midtown Manhattan, as before the service changes, '''M''' train passengers had to transfer at least once if heading to Midtown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mta.info/nyct/service/ServiceReduction/part1.htm |title=2010 NYC Transit Service Reductions |date=January 27, 2010 |publisher=[[MTA New York City Transit]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313123213/http://www.mta.info/nyct/service/ServiceReduction/part1.htm |archivedate=March 13, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nOn March 19, 2010, it was reported that the plan had been changed and that while the new combined route would still be used, it would carry the '''M''' train designation, recolored orange to designate the IND Sixth Avenue Line as its Manhattan trunk line, while discontinuing the '''V''' train.

The pseudonym was presumably taken from the title character of [[The Luck of Barry Lyndon|Thackeray's 1844 novel]].\n\nBorn in [[London]], he may be best remembered for his stage play ''[[The Man in Half Moon Street (play)|The Man in Half Moon Street]]'', which opened at London's New Theatre on 22 March 1939 and ran for 172 performances, starring [[Leslie Banks]], [[Malcolm Keen]] and [[Ann Todd]]<ref>''Blood on the Stage, 1925-1950: Milestone Plays of Crime, Mystery, and Detection: An Annotated Repertoire'' by Amnon Kabatchnik, 2009</ref>, as well as for three screenplays from the 1940s: ''[[The Lodger (1944 film)|The Lodger]]'' (1944), ''[[Hangover Square (film)|Hangover Square]]'' (1945) and ''[[The Man in Half Moon Street]]'' (1945). The last was remade by [[Hammer Films|Hammer Film Productions]] in 1959 as ''[[The Man Who Could Cheat Death]]''.\n\nLyndon began his writing career as a journalist, particularly about motor-racing, and short-story writer before becoming a playwright. His first play, ''[[The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse]]'', was made into an [[Edward G. Robinson]] film in 1939.  After that success, Lyndon moved to [[Los Angeles, California]], in 1941 to concentrate on writing for films full time.
