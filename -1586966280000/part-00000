When Quechua-dominant bilinguals have {{IPA|/e, o/}} in their phonemic inventory, they realize them as {{IPA|[{{IPAplink|\u026a}}, {{IPAplink|\u028a}}]}}, which are heard by outsiders as variants of {{IPA|/i, u/}}.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Cotton|Sharp|1988|p=182}}</ref> Both of those features are viewed as strongly non-standard by other speakers.\n\n===Allophones===\nPhonetic nasalization occurs for vowels occurring between nasal consonants or when preceding a syllable-final nasal, e.g. ''cinco'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u03b8\u0129\u014bko]}} ('five').<ref name=\"carrera256\"/>\n\nArguably, Eastern Andalusian and Murcian Spanish have ten phonemic vowels, with each of the above vowels paired by a lowered or fronted and lengthened version, e.g. ''la madre'' {{IPA|[la \u02c8ma\u00f0\u027ee]}} ('the mother') vs. ''las madres'' {{IPA|[l\u00e6\u031e\u02d0 \u02c8m\u00e6\u031e\u02d0\u00f0\u027e\u025b\u02d0]}} ('the mothers').<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Zamora Vicente|1967|p=?}}. The first {{IPA|/a/}} in ''madres'' also undergoes this fronting process as part of a vowel harmony system.

While many diphthongs are historically the result of a recategorization of vowel sequences (hiatus) as diphthongs, there is still lexical contrast between diphthongs and [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Chi\u021boran|Hualde|2007|p=45}}</ref>  There are also some lexical items that vary amongst speakers and dialects between hiatus and diphthong: words like ''bi\u00f3logo'' ('biologist') with a potential diphthong in the first syllable and words like ''di\u00e1logo'' with a stressed or pretonic sequence of {{IPA|/i/}} and a vowel vary between a diphthong and hiatus.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Chi\u021boran|Hualde|2007|p=46}}</ref>  {{Harvcoltxt|Chi\u021boran|Hualde|2007}} hypothesize that this is because vocalic sequences are longer in these positions.\n\nIn addition to [[synalepha]] across word boundaries, sequences of vowels in hiatus become diphthongs in fast speech; when this happens, one vowel becomes non-syllabic (unless they are the same vowel, in which case they fuse together) as in ''poeta'' {{IPA|[\u02c8po\u032feta]}} ('poet') and ''maestro'' {{IPA|[\u02c8mae\u032fst\u027eo]}} ('teacher').<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Mart\u00ednez Celdr\u00e1n|Fern\u00e1ndez Planas|Carrera Sabat\u00e9|2003|pp=256\u2013257}}</ref>  Similarly, the relatively rare diphthong {{IPA|/eu/}} may be reduced to {{IPA|[u]}} in certain unstressed contexts, as in ''Eufemia'', {{IPA|[u\u02c8femja]}}.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Cotton|Sharp|1988|p=18}}</ref>  In the case of verbs like ''aliviar'' ('relieve'), diphthongs result from the suffixation of normal verbal morphology onto a stem-final {{IPA|/j/}} (that is, ''aliviar'' would be |{{IPA|alibj}}| + |{{IPA|ar}}|).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Harris|1969|pp=99\u2013101}}.</ref>  This contrasts with verbs like ''ampliar'' ('to extend') which, by their verbal morphology, seem to have stems ending in {{IPA|/i/}}.<ref>See {{Harvcoltxt|Harris|1969|pp=147\u2013148}} for a more extensive list of verb stems ending in both high vowels, as well as their corresponding semivowels.</ref>  Spanish also possesses [[triphthong]]s like {{IPA|/wei/}} and, in dialects that use a second person plural conjugation, {{IPA|/jai/}}, {{IPA|/jei/}}, and {{IPA|/wai/}} (e.g. ''buey'', 'ox'; ''cambi\u00e1is'', 'you change'; ''cambi\u00e9is'', '(that) you may change'; and ''averigu\u00e1is'', 'you ascertain').<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Saporta|1956|p=290}}</ref>\n\nNon-syllabic {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} can be reduced to {{IPA|[\u029d]}}, {{IPA|[w\u031d]}}, as in ''beatitud'' {{IPA|[b\u029dati\u02c8tu\u00f0]}} ('beatitude') and ''poetisa'' {{IPA|[pw\u031de\u02c8tisa]}} ('poetess'), respectively; similarly, non-syllabic {{IPA|/a/}} can be completely elided, as in (e.g. ''ahorita'' {{IPA|[o\u02c8\u027eita]}} 'right away').  The frequency (though not the presence) of this phenomenon differs amongst dialects, with a number having it occur rarely and others exhibiting it always.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt| Bowen|Stockwell|1955|p=237}}</ref>\n\n==Prosody==\nSpanish is usually considered a [[Syllable-timed language#Syllable timing|syllable-timed language]].

(1973) by the ''Gram\u00e1tica de la Real Acedemia Espa\u00f1ola''</ref>\n\nPrimary stress occurs on the [[Ultima (linguistics)|penultima]] (the next-to-last syllable) 80% of the time. The other 20% of the time, stress falls on the ultima and antepenultima (third-to-last syllable).<ref name=\"Lle\u00f3\">{{Harvcoltxt|Lle\u00f3|2003|p=262}}</ref>\n\nNonverbs are generally [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed]] on the penultimate syllable for vowel-final words and on the final syllable of consonant-final words. Exceptions are marked orthographically (see below), whereas regular words are underlyingly phonologically marked with a stress feature [+stress].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Hochberg|1988|p=684}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to exceptions to these tendencies, particularly learned words from Greek and Latin that feature antepenultimate stress, there are numerous [[minimal pair]]s which contrast solely on stress such as ''s\u00e1bana'' ('sheet') and ''sabana'' ('savannah'), as well as ''l\u00edmite'' ('boundary'), ''limite'' ('[that] he/she limit')<!-- sic: \"limit\" is subjunctive here --> and ''limit\u00e9'' ('I limited').\n\nLexical stress may be marked orthographically with an [[acute accent]] (''\u00e1cido'', ''distinci\u00f3n'', etc.).  This is done according to the mandatory stress rules of [[Spanish orthography]], which are similar to the tendencies above (differing with words like ''distinci\u00f3n'') and are defined so as to unequivocally indicate where the stress lies in a given written word.  An acute accent may also be used to differentiate homophones, such as ''mi'' (my), and ''m\u00ed'' (me). In such cases, the accent is used on the homophone that normally receives greater stress when used in a sentence.\n\nLexical stress patterns are different between words carrying verbal and nominal inflection: in addition to the occurrence of verbal affixes with stress (something absent in nominal inflection), underlying stress also differs in that it falls on the last syllable of the inflectional stem in verbal words while those of nominal words may have ultimate or penultimate stress.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Garc\u00eda-Bellido|1997|pp=473\u2013474}}</ref>  In addition, amongst sequences of clitics suffixed to a verb, the rightmost clitic may receive secondary stress, e.g. ''b\u00fascalo'' {{IPA|/\u02c8buska\u02cclo/}} ('look for it').<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Garc\u00eda-Bellido|1997|p=486}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Navarro Tom\u00e1s|1917|pp=381\u2013382, 385}}</ref>\n\n==Alternations==\nA number of alternations exist in Spanish that reflect diachronic changes in the language and arguably reflect [[morphophonological]] processes rather than strictly phonological ones.

This allows for distinction between {{IPA|[p]}}, {{IPA|[t]}}, and {{IPA|[k]}}, along with their voiced counterparts, as well as distinction between {{IPA|[l]}} and the approximant {{IPA|[j]}}.\n* The third level includes fricatives and/or affricates.\n* The fourth level introduces liquids other than {{IPA|[l]}}, {{IPA|[\u0279]}} and {{IPA|[\u027e]}}.

While many diphthongs are historically the result of a recategorization of vowel sequences (hiatus) as diphthongs, there is still lexical contrast between diphthongs and [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Chi\u021boran|Hualde|2007|p=45}}</ref>  There are also some lexical items that vary amongst speakers and dialects between hiatus and diphthong: words like ''bi\u00f3logo'' ('biologist') with a potential diphthong in the first syllable and words like ''di\u00e1logo'' with a stressed or pretonic sequence of {{IPA|/i/}} and a vowel vary between a diphthong and hiatus.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Chi\u021boran|Hualde|2007|p=46}}</ref>  {{Harvcoltxt|Chi\u021boran|Hualde|2007}} hypothesize that this is because vocalic sequences are longer in these positions.\n\nIn addition to [[synalepha]] across word boundaries, sequences of vowels in hiatus become diphthongs in fast speech; when this happens, one vowel becomes non-syllabic (unless they are the same vowel, in which case they fuse together) as in ''poeta'' {{IPA|[\u02c8po\u032feta]}} ('poet') and ''maestro'' {{IPA|[\u02c8mae\u032fst\u027eo]}} ('teacher').<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Mart\u00ednez Celdr\u00e1n|Fern\u00e1ndez Planas|Carrera Sabat\u00e9|2003|pp=256\u2013257}}</ref>  Similarly, the relatively rare diphthong {{IPA|/eu/}} may be reduced to {{IPA|[u]}} in certain unstressed contexts, as in ''Eufemia'', {{IPA|[u\u02c8femja]}}.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Cotton|Sharp|1988|p=18}}</ref>  In the case of verbs like ''aliviar'' ('relieve'), diphthongs result from the suffixation of normal verbal morphology onto a stem-final {{IPA|/j/}} (that is, ''aliviar'' would be |{{IPA|alibj}}| + |{{IPA|ar}}|).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Harris|1969|pp=99\u2013101}}.</ref>  This contrasts with verbs like ''ampliar'' ('to extend') which, by their verbal morphology, seem to have stems ending in {{IPA|/i/}}.<ref>See {{Harvcoltxt|Harris|1969|pp=147\u2013148}} for a more extensive list of verb stems ending in both high vowels, as well as their corresponding semivowels.</ref>  Spanish also possesses [[triphthong]]s like {{IPA|/wei/}} and, in dialects that use a second person plural conjugation, {{IPA|/jai/}}, {{IPA|/jei/}}, and {{IPA|/wai/}} (e.g. ''buey'', 'ox'; ''cambi\u00e1is'', 'you change'; ''cambi\u00e9is'', '(that) you may change'; and ''averigu\u00e1is'', 'you ascertain').<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Saporta|1956|p=290}}</ref>\n\nNon-syllabic {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} can be reduced to {{IPA|[\u029d]}}, {{IPA|[w\u031d]}}, as in ''beatitud'' {{IPA|[b\u029dati\u02c8tu\u00f0]}} ('beatitude') and ''poetisa'' {{IPA|[pw\u031de\u02c8tisa]}} ('poetess'), respectively; similarly, non-syllabic {{IPA|/a/}} can be completely elided, as in (e.g. ''ahorita'' {{IPA|[o\u02c8\u027eita]}} 'right away').

(1973) by the ''Gram\u00e1tica de la Real Acedemia Espa\u00f1ola''</ref>\n\nPrimary stress occurs on the [[Ultima (linguistics)|penultima]] (the next-to-last syllable) 80% of the time. The other 20% of the time, stress falls on the ultima and antepenultima (third-to-last syllable).<ref name=\"Lle\u00f3\">{{Harvcoltxt|Lle\u00f3|2003|p=262}}</ref>\n\nNonverbs are generally [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed]] on the penultimate syllable for vowel-final words and on the final syllable of consonant-final words. Exceptions are marked orthographically (see below), whereas regular words are underlyingly phonologically marked with a stress feature [+stress].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Hochberg|1988|p=684}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to exceptions to these tendencies, particularly learned words from Greek and Latin that feature antepenultimate stress, there are numerous [[minimal pair]]s which contrast solely on stress such as ''s\u00e1bana'' ('sheet') and ''sabana'' ('savannah'), as well as ''l\u00edmite'' ('boundary'), ''limite'' ('[that] he/she limit')<!-- sic: \"limit\" is subjunctive here --> and ''limit\u00e9'' ('I limited').\n\nLexical stress may be marked orthographically with an [[acute accent]] (''\u00e1cido'', ''distinci\u00f3n'', etc.).  This is done according to the mandatory stress rules of [[Spanish orthography]], which are similar to the tendencies above (differing with words like ''distinci\u00f3n'') and are defined so as to unequivocally indicate where the stress lies in a given written word.  An acute accent may also be used to differentiate homophones, such as ''mi'' (my), and ''m\u00ed'' (me). In such cases, the accent is used on the homophone that normally receives greater stress when used in a sentence.\n\nLexical stress patterns are different between words carrying verbal and nominal inflection: in addition to the occurrence of verbal affixes with stress (something absent in nominal inflection), underlying stress also differs in that it falls on the last syllable of the inflectional stem in verbal words while those of nominal words may have ultimate or penultimate stress.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Garc\u00eda-Bellido|1997|pp=473\u2013474}}</ref>  In addition, amongst sequences of clitics suffixed to a verb, the rightmost clitic may receive secondary stress, e.g. ''b\u00fascalo'' {{IPA|/\u02c8buska\u02cclo/}} ('look for it').<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Garc\u00eda-Bellido|1997|p=486}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Navarro Tom\u00e1s|1917|pp=381\u2013382, 385}}</ref>\n\n==Alternations==\nA number of alternations exist in Spanish that reflect diachronic changes in the language and arguably reflect [[morphophonological]] processes rather than strictly phonological ones.

This includes a [[Labial consonant|labial]]/[[Coronal consonant|coronal]] place difference (for example, {{IPA|[b]}} vs {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[l]}} vs {{IPA|[\u03b2]}}).\n* The second level includes voicing distinction for oral stops and a [[Coronal consonant|coronal]]/[[Dorsal consonant|dorsal]] place difference. This allows for distinction between {{IPA|[p]}}, {{IPA|[t]}}, and {{IPA|[k]}}, along with their voiced counterparts, as well as distinction between {{IPA|[l]}} and the approximant {{IPA|[j]}}.\n* The third level includes fricatives and/or affricates.\n* The fourth level introduces liquids other than {{IPA|[l]}}, {{IPA|[\u0279]}} and {{IPA|[\u027e]}}. It also introduces {{IPA|[\u03b8]}}.\n* The fifth level introduces the trill {{IPA|[r]}}.\n\nThis hierarchy is based on production only, and is a representation of a child\u2019s capacity to produce a sound, whether that sound is the correct target in adult speech or not. Thus, it may contain some sounds that are not included in the adult phonology, but produced as a result of error.\n\nSpanish-speaking children will accurately produce most [[Segment (linguistics)|segments]] at a relatively early age. By around three-and-a-half years, they will no longer productively use phonological processes{{clarify|date=November 2019}} the majority of the time. Some common error patterns (found 10% or more of the time) are [[cluster reduction]], liquid simplification, and stopping. Less common patterns (evidenced less than 10% of the time) include [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatal fronting]], [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], and final [[Deletion (phonology)|consonant deletion]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Goldstein|Iglesias|1998|pp=5\u20136}}</ref>\n\nTypical phonological analyses of Spanish consider the consonants {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} the [[Underlying representation|underlying phonemes]] and their corresponding approximants {{IPA|[\u03b2]}}, {{IPA|[\u00f0]}}, and {{IPA|[\u0263]}} allophonic and derivable by [[phonological rule]]s.

This type of warfare is also called '''Alpine warfare''', after the [[Alps]] mountains. Mountain warfare is one of the most dangerous types of combat as it involves surviving not only combat with the enemy but also the extreme weather and dangerous terrain.<ref>https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1433154/india-train-updf-mountain-warfare</ref>\n\nMountain ranges are of strategic importance since they often act as a [[natural border]], and may also be the origin of a water source (e.g. [[Golan Heights]] \u2013 ''[[water conflict]]''). Attacking a prepared enemy position in mountain terrain requires a greater ratio of attacking soldiers to defending soldiers than a war conducted on level ground.<ref>It is generally accepted that the ratio required for the force launching an offensive to have a good chance of success is 3:1. In mountainous terrain, the required ratio is much more.</ref> Mountains at any time of year are dangerous \u2013 [[lightning]], strong gusts of wind, rock falls, [[avalanche]], snow pack, ice, extreme cold, [[glaciers]] with their [[crevasse]]s and the general uneven terrain and the slow pace of troop and material movement are all additional threats to combatants. Movement, reinforcements, and [[medical evacuation]] up and down steep slopes and areas where even [[pack animal]]s cannot reach involves an enormous exertion of energy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR700/RR718/RAND_RR718.pdf |title=Research report |publisher=www.rand.org |date= |accessdate=2020-01-26}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n{{see also|Hannibal's crossing of the Alps}}\nThe term mountain warfare is said to have come about in the [[Middle Ages]] after the monarchies of [[Europe]] found it difficult to fight the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss]] armies in the [[Alps]] because the Swiss were able to fight in smaller units and took vantage points against a huge unmaneuverable army. Similar styles of attack and defence were later employed by [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]], [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] and irregulars who hid in the mountains after an attack, making it challenging for an army of regulars to fight back. In Bonaparte's Italian campaign, and the [[Tyrolean Rebellion|1809 rebellion]] in [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]], mountain warfare played a large role.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/empires/napoleon/n_war/campaign/page_1.html|title=PBS - Napoleon: Napoleon at War|website=www.pbs.org}}</ref>\n\nAnother example of mountain warfare was the [[Crossing of the Andes]] carried out by the Argentinean [[Army of the Andes]] (Ej\u00e9rcito de los Andes) commanded by Gen [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] in 1817. One of the divisions surpassed 5000 m in height.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/cs/pdf/CS_Colombia.pdf |title=Data |publisher=www.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2020-01-26}}</ref>\n\n===Second Punic War===\nIn 218 BC (DXXXVI [[ab urbe condita|a.u.c.]]) the Carthaginian army commander Hannibal marched troops, cavalry and African elephants across the Alps in an effort to conquer Rome by approaching it from north of the Italian peninsula. The Roman government was complacent because the Alps were apparently a secure natural obstacle to would-be invaders. In December 218 BC the Carthaginian forces defeated Roman troops, in the north, with the use of elephants. Many elephants did not survive the cold weather and disease that was typical of the European climate. Hannibal's army fought Roman troops in Italy for 15 years but failed to conquer Rome. Carthage was ultimately defeated by Roman general Scipio Africanus at Zama in north Africa in 202 BC (DLII a.u.c.).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/apr/03/where-muck-hannibals-elephants-alps-italy-bill-mahaney-york-university-toronto|title=The truth about Hannibal's route across the Alps|first=Philip|last=Ball|date=April 3, 2016|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>\n\n===World War I===\n[[Image:Italian Front 1915-1917.jpg|right|thumb|Italian Front in 1915\u20131917: eleven [[Battles of the Isonzo]] and Asiago offensive.

The [[Austro-Hungarian]] defence repelled  [[Alpini|Italian]] attacks as they took advantage of the mostly mountainous terrain in the [[Julian Alps]] and the [[Dolomites]], where [[frostbite]] and avalanches proved deadlier than bullets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/most-treacherous-battle-world-war-i-italian-mountains-180959076/|title=The Most Treacherous Battle of World War I Took Place in the Italian Mountains|first=Brian Mockenhaupt, Stefen|last=Chow|website=Smithsonian Magazine}}</ref>  During the summer of 1918, the [[Battle of San Matteo]] took place on the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian front]]; this battle was fought at the highest elevation of any in the war. In December 1914, another [[Battle of Sarikamish|offensive]] was launched by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] supreme commander [[Enver Pasha]] with 95,000\u2013190,000 troops against the [[Russia]]ns in the [[Caucasus]].

However, during the opening stage of the war, there was military action on the bleak mountainous island of [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], when a British expedition sought to eject occupying Argentine forces. South Georgia is a [[periantarctic island]], and the conflict took place during the southern winter, so Alpine conditions prevailed almost down to sea level. The operation (codenamed [[Operation Paraquet]]) was unusual, in that it combined aspects of long-range [[amphibious warfare]], [[arctic warfare]] and mountain warfare. It involved several ships, [[special forces]] troops and [[helicopter]]s.<ref name=\"Rossiter\">\"''Sink the Belgrano''\", Mike Rossiter, 2007, Transworld, London, pp 189\u2013233</ref>\n\n===War in Afghanistan===\n\n[[Image:Afghan topo en.jpg|thumb|right|Afghanistan topography]]\n[[File:Bushmaster Afghanistan snow Jan 2010.jpg|thumb|right|Australians patrolling in the mountains of [[Oruzgan Province]]]]\n\nThroughout history but especially since 1979, many mountain warfare operations have taken place throughout [[Afghanistan]].

The area constitutes a major infiltration route into Afghanistan, and insurgents can enter these provinces from any number of places along the Pakistani border to gain access to a vast network of river valleys.

The primary goal of counterinsurgency is to secure the backing of the populace and thereby to legitimize the government rather than focus on militarily defeating the insurgents. Counterinsurgency doctrine has proved difficult to implement in Kunar and Nuristan. In the sparsely-populated mountain regions of Eastern Afghanistan, strategists have argued for holding the high ground\u2014a tenet of classical mountain warfare. The argument suggests that if the counterinsurgent does not deny the enemy the high ground, the insurgents will be able to attack at will. In the Kunar and Nuristan regions, US forces continue to pursue a hybrid style of counterinsurgency warfare, with its focus on [[winning hearts and minds]], and mountain warfare, whereby the US forces seize and hold the high ground.\n\n==Training==\n[[File:Royal Marines of 42 Commando trudge through deep snow during Exercise Himalayan Warrior MOD 45147580.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Marines]] training in the [[Himalayas]], 2007]]\n[[File:13i-1 (\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc\u6559\u80b2\u30fb\u51ac\u5b63\u5c71\u5730\u8a13\u7df4) R \u6559\u80b2\u8a13\u7df4\u7b49 258.jpg|thumb|[[Ranger Courses (Japan Ground Self-Defense Force)|\"Alpen Ranger\"]] training of the [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force]]]]\nThe expense of training mountain troops precludes them from being on the [[order of battle]] of most armies except those who reasonably expect to fight in such terrain.

This type of warfare is also called '''Alpine warfare''', after the [[Alps]] mountains. Mountain warfare is one of the most dangerous types of combat as it involves surviving not only combat with the enemy but also the extreme weather and dangerous terrain.<ref>https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1433154/india-train-updf-mountain-warfare</ref>\n\nMountain ranges are of strategic importance since they often act as a [[natural border]], and may also be the origin of a water source (e.g. [[Golan Heights]] \u2013 ''[[water conflict]]''). Attacking a prepared enemy position in mountain terrain requires a greater ratio of attacking soldiers to defending soldiers than a war conducted on level ground.<ref>It is generally accepted that the ratio required for the force launching an offensive to have a good chance of success is 3:1. In mountainous terrain, the required ratio is much more.</ref> Mountains at any time of year are dangerous \u2013 [[lightning]], strong gusts of wind, rock falls, [[avalanche]], snow pack, ice, extreme cold, [[glaciers]] with their [[crevasse]]s and the general uneven terrain and the slow pace of troop and material movement are all additional threats to combatants. Movement, reinforcements, and [[medical evacuation]] up and down steep slopes and areas where even [[pack animal]]s cannot reach involves an enormous exertion of energy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR700/RR718/RAND_RR718.pdf |title=Research report |publisher=www.rand.org |date= |accessdate=2020-01-26}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n{{see also|Hannibal's crossing of the Alps}}\nThe term mountain warfare is said to have come about in the [[Middle Ages]] after the monarchies of [[Europe]] found it difficult to fight the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss]] armies in the [[Alps]] because the Swiss were able to fight in smaller units and took vantage points against a huge unmaneuverable army. Similar styles of attack and defence were later employed by [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]], [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] and irregulars who hid in the mountains after an attack, making it challenging for an army of regulars to fight back. In Bonaparte's Italian campaign, and the [[Tyrolean Rebellion|1809 rebellion]] in [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]], mountain warfare played a large role.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/empires/napoleon/n_war/campaign/page_1.html|title=PBS - Napoleon: Napoleon at War|website=www.pbs.org}}</ref>\n\nAnother example of mountain warfare was the [[Crossing of the Andes]] carried out by the Argentinean [[Army of the Andes]] (Ej\u00e9rcito de los Andes) commanded by Gen [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] in 1817.

The Roman government was complacent because the Alps were apparently a secure natural obstacle to would-be invaders. In December 218 BC the Carthaginian forces defeated Roman troops, in the north, with the use of elephants. Many elephants did not survive the cold weather and disease that was typical of the European climate. Hannibal's army fought Roman troops in Italy for 15 years, but failed to conquer Rome. Carthage was ultimately defeated by Roman general Scipio Africanus at Zama in north Africa in 202 BC (DLII a.u.c.).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/apr/03/where-muck-hannibals-elephants-alps-italy-bill-mahaney-york-university-toronto|title=The truth about Hannibal's route across the Alps|first=Philip|last=Ball|date=April 3, 2016|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>\n\n===World War I===\n[[Image:Italian Front 1915-1917.jpg|right|thumb|Italian Front in 1915\u20131917: eleven [[Battles of the Isonzo]] and Asiago offensive.

Located at the corner of Duval and Greene street since 1937 (201 Duval Street, Key West, FL  33040).\n\n==HISTORY OF SLOPPY JOE\u2019S BAR, KEY WEST, FL==\n\nThe official beginning of what would become Sloppy Joe's Bar, the famous and infamous Key West saloon, was December 5, 1933--the day Prohibition was repealed. The bar was destined to go through two name changes and a sudden change of location before it would become Sloppy Joe's seen by millions of visitors to Florida's southernmost outpost.\n\nIn Key West, being a bastion of free thinkers even in the thirties, Prohibition was looked on as an amusing exercise dreamed up by the government, and Joe Russell was just one of the enterprising individuals who operated an illegal Speak Easy on Front Street. Even Ernest Hemingway, who made Key West his home at the time, slipped over to Russell's on occasion to buy illicit bottles of Scotch and the two struck up an enduring friendship.\n\nWhen the government's Great Experiment ended a dismal failure, Joe Russell moved his business to Greene Street and became a legitimate saloon-keeper-proprietor of the Blind Pig, a droll rundown building that Russell leased for three dollars a week.\n\nThe rowdy, come-as-you-are saloon, was renamed the Silver Slipper upon the addition of a dance floor; but that did not matter, it remained a place of shabby discomfort, good friends and gambling, fifteen-cent whiskey, and ten-cent shots of gin.\n\nIt was Hemingway, a favorite patron of Russell's bar from the start, who encouraged its name change to Sloppy Joe's. The new name was adopted from Jose Garcia Rios Havana Club selling liquor and iced seafood. Because the floor was always wet with melted ice, his patrons taunted Jose (Joe) with running a sloppy place... Sloppy Joe\u2019s \u2026and the name stuck.\n\nIn its early days in Key West, Sloppy Joe's boasted several trademark \"fixtures\" besides Hemingway. There was \"Big\" Skinner, the hearty Bartender who tipped the scales at 300 pounds and served Sloppy Joe's customers for more than two decades.  Big Skinner was captured by Erik Smith a WPA-era artist, along with Russell and Hemingway, in a famous mural that hangs in Sloppy Joe\u2019s today titled \u201cHemingway and Friends.\u201d\n\nCorner of Greene and Duval Street since 1937\nSloppy Joe's migrated across the street to its present location on May 5, 1937. The move was occasioned by a rent increase that Joe Russell refused to pay: from three dollars a week to a whopping four dollars. Luckily, the former Victoria Restaurant owned by Spanish emigrant Juan Farto was vacant. Located at the corner of Duval and Greene Streets, the building had been built in 1917 and incorporated beautiful Cuban tile work, busily whirring ceiling fans, and jalousie doors. Joe Russell paid $2,500 for it.\n\nIn true Key West fashion, the bar never actually closed during the transition--customers simply picked up their drinks and carried them, along with every piece of furniture in the place, down the block to 201 Duval Street. Service resumed with barely a blink. The new Sloppy Joe's boasted the longest bar in town.  Behind the bar, in the back room, were gambling and the requisite pool tables. Skinner had pride of place above his new long curved bar. The bat that Skinner used to control his patrons now hangs on the wall.\n\nNicknames \u201cSloppy Joe\u201d Russell and \u201cJosie Grunts\u201d\nJoe Russell was a Conch.  Born and raised in Key West.  Conch is the name given to Key West natives; a name that derived from that of the tough, tasty mollusk found in the surrounding waters.  Russell was a charter boat captain, rum runner, Hemingway's boat pilot, and the author's fishing companion for twelve years. In his company, Papa once caught an astonishing fifty-four Marlin in 115 days. Hemingway called him \"Josie Grunts\" and used him as the model for Freddy, the owner of Freddy's Bar and captain of the Queen Conch in To Have and Have Not. \n\nWhen Joe officially opened the bar, Hemingway and his \"Mob\" of cohorts were enthusiastic regular customers. In fact, the author once called himself a co-owner or silent partner in the enterprise. The \"Mob\" was comprised of some of the literary lights of the day as well as a variety of famous and infamous local residents: John Dos Pasos, Waldo Pierce, J.B. Sullivan, Hamilton Adams, Captain Eddie Saunders, Henry Strater. They wrangled, drank, and philosophized the days away, never knowing they were building a legend.\n\nWhen Hemingway left Key West in 1939, he left a number of personal effects stored in a house next to Sloppy Joe's. After the house was sold, the effects were moved into the back room behind the bar at Sloppy Joe's. They remained there until 1962, a year after Hemingway's death, when his widow (fourth wife Mary Welsh Hemingway) opened the room and took possession of them, finding uncashed royalty checks, unfinished manuscripts, sections of original manuscript of \u201cTo Have and Have Not,\u201d letters, and personal items.

Located at the corner of Duval and Greene street since 1937 (201 Duval Street, Key West, FL  33040).\n\n==HISTORY OF SLOPPY JOE\u2019S BAR, KEY WEST, FL==\n\nThe official beginning of what would become Sloppy Joe's Bar, the famous and infamous Key West saloon, was December 5, 1933--the day Prohibition was repealed. The bar was destined to go through two name changes and a sudden change of location before it would become Sloppy Joe's seen by millions of visitors to Florida's southernmost outpost.\n\nIn Key West, being a bastion of free thinkers even in the thirties, Prohibition was looked on as an amusing exercise dreamed up by the government, and Joe Russell was just one of the enterprising individuals who operated an illegal Speak Easy on Front Street. Even Ernest Hemingway, who made Key West his home at the time, slipped over to Russell's on occasion to buy illicit bottles of Scotch and the two struck up an enduring friendship.\n\nWhen the government's Great Experiment ended a dismal failure, Joe Russell moved his business to Greene Street and became a legitimate saloon-keeper-proprietor of the Blind Pig, a droll rundown building that Russell leased for three dollars a week.\n\nThe rowdy, come-as-you-are saloon, was renamed the Silver Slipper upon the addition of a dance floor; but that did not matter, it remained a place of shabby discomfort, good friends and gambling, fifteen-cent whiskey, and ten-cent shots of gin.\n\nIt was Hemingway, a favorite patron of Russell's bar from the start, who encouraged its name change to Sloppy Joe's. The new name was adopted from Jose Garcia Rios Havana Club selling liquor and iced seafood. Because the floor was always wet with melted ice, his patrons taunted Jose (Joe) with running a sloppy place... Sloppy Joe\u2019s \u2026and the name stuck.\n\nIn its early days in Key West, Sloppy Joe's boasted several trademark \"fixtures\" besides Hemingway. There was \"Big\" Skinner, the hearty Bartender who tipped the scales at 300 pounds and served Sloppy Joe's customers for more than two decades.  Big Skinner was captured by Erik Smith a WPA-era artist, along with Russell and Hemingway, in a famous mural that hangs in Sloppy Joe\u2019s today titled \u201cHemingway and Friends.\u201d\n\nCorner of Greene and Duval Street since 1937\nSloppy Joe's migrated across the street to its present location on May 5, 1937. The move was occasioned by a rent increase that Joe Russell refused to pay: from three dollars a week to a whopping four dollars. Luckily, the former Victoria Restaurant owned by Spanish emigrant Juan Farto was vacant. Located at the corner of Duval and Greene Streets, the building had been built in 1917 and incorporated beautiful Cuban tile work, busily whirring ceiling fans, and jalousie doors. Joe Russell paid $2,500 for it.\n\nIn true Key West fashion, the bar never actually closed during the transition--customers simply picked up their drinks and carried them, along with every piece of furniture in the place, down the block to 201 Duval Street. Service resumed with barely a blink. The new Sloppy Joe's boasted the longest bar in town.  Behind the bar, in the back room, were gambling and the requisite pool tables. Skinner had pride of place above his new long curved bar. The bat that Skinner used to control his patrons now hangs on the wall.\n\nNicknames \u201cSloppy Joe\u201d Russell and \u201cJosie Grunts\u201d\nJoe Russell was a Conch.  Born and raised in Key West.  Conch is the name given to Key West natives; a name that derived from that of the tough, tasty mollusk found in the surrounding waters.  Russell was a charter boat captain, rum runner, Hemingway's boat pilot, and the author's fishing companion for twelve years. In his company, Papa once caught an astonishing fifty-four Marlin in 115 days. Hemingway called him \"Josie Grunts\" and used him as the model for Freddy, the owner of Freddy's Bar and captain of the Queen Conch in To Have and Have Not. \n\nWhen Joe officially opened the bar, Hemingway and his \"Mob\" of cohorts were enthusiastic regular customers. In fact, the author once called himself a co-owner or silent partner in the enterprise. The \"Mob\" was comprised of some of the literary lights of the day as well as a variety of famous and infamous local residents: John Dos Pasos, Waldo Pierce, J.B. Sullivan, Hamilton Adams, Captain Eddie Saunders, Henry Strater. They wrangled, drank, and philosophized the days away, never knowing they were building a legend.\n\nWhen Hemingway left Key West in 1939, he left a number of personal effects stored in a house next to Sloppy Joe's. After the house was sold, the effects were moved into the back room behind the bar at Sloppy Joe's. They remained there until 1962, a year after Hemingway's death, when his widow (fourth wife Mary Welsh Hemingway) opened the room and took possession of them, finding uncashed royalty checks, unfinished manuscripts, sections of original manuscript of \u201cTo Have and Have Not,\u201d letters, and personal items. Some of the memorabilia was given to the then-owner of the bar, Stan Smith, to be displayed.  One of the items was the snow skis that hang in the bar today.\n\nJoe Russell died June 20,1941 of a heart attack, he was 53 years old.  At the time Russell and Ernest Hemingway had been fishing in Cuba for three weeks, Hemingway telephoned Joe Russell Jr. to tell him of his father\u2019s death.  He is buried in the Key West Cemetery.\n\nSloppy Joe's... Today\nSloppy Joe\u2019s was purchased September 8, 1978 by Sid Snelgrove and Jim Mayer and has been owned by the two families since that time.\n\nOver the years Sloppy Joe's, like rare Cuban rum, has gained a richness and flavor while essentially remaining unchanged. The ceiling fans still whisper busily, a little bit wobbly but carrying on. The jalousie doors open on a Duval Street busier than even Hemingway could imagine, yet still bearing the off-beat ambience that prompted him to brand Key West \"the St. Tropez of the Poor.\" The long curving bar wears the scars of generations of visitors and Hemingway aficionados, drawn by the legend and hoping some measure of magic will rub off on them - and it does.\n\nOpen 365 days a year, each day begins at 9:00 am (noon on Sundays).

He was Magister of the UK-based magical group Cultus Sabbati.<ref>Evans (2007), p. 212</ref>\n\n==Career==\nChumbley published several limited edition books through his private press Xoanon Publishing, and had many articles printed in occult magazines. Their subject was the doctrine and practice of a tradition of sorcery which he called '[[Sabbatic Craft]]', a term which, according to Chumbley, \"describes the way in which elements of witch-lore, [[Sabbath (witchcraft)|Sabbath]] mythology and imagery were being employed in the [[cunning folk|cunning-craft]] tradition into which I was originally inducted\".<ref name=\"CauldronInterview\">\"An Interview With Andrew D. Chumbley\", ''The Cauldron'' no. 103, February 2002.</ref> He claimed that this tradition was founded in two lineages of [[traditional witchcraft]], both pre-dating \"those modern revivalist forms of witchcraft, which have become generically nominalised as 'wicca'\".<ref name=\"Hekas\">Chumbley, Andrew, \"Hekas\", ''The Cauldron'' no. 74, November 1994.</ref> Chumbley's early articles were published in the [[chaos magic]] journal ''[[Chaos International]]''; later articles appeared in ''Starfire'', journal of the [[Ordo Templi Orientis (Typhonian)|Typhonian OTO]], and in the long-established British witchcraft journal ''The Cauldron''. [[Daniel A. Schulke]] succeeded him as Magister of Cultus Sabbati.\n\n==Personality==\nIn an obituary his close friend [[Michael Howard (Witch)|Michael Howard]], a well-known occult writer and publisher of ''The Cauldron'', described Chumbley as \"a man of the land, rural in both birth and character. He fitted totally within the traditional archetypal parameters of the English (and specifically Essex) [[cunning man]].\" Howard recalled Chumbley\u2019s kindness, generosity and sense of humour: \"To outsiders Andrew could sometimes appear to be aloof, intense and serious to the point of obsession... However, if he met kindred spirits of sincerity and honour, who shared his interests and serious intent, he would willingly go out of his way to offer them help and guidance on the Path... In fact he was a natural teacher and, like all good occult teachers, acted as a catalyst in the lives of his students.\"<ref name=\"Obituary\">Howard, M., 'Andrew D.

According to Schulke, \"Chumbley's magical work spanned many fields of sorcerous influence, including [[Sufism]], left-hand [[Tantra]] and Petro [[Haitian Vodou|Voodoo]]\".<ref name=\"WayWaymark\">Schulke, Daniel A. \"Way and Waymark\", ''The Cauldron'' no. 122, November 2006.</ref> Other influences included the artist-occultist [[Austin Osman Spare]]<ref>Evans (2007), p. 213: \"The 'sabbatic craft' mentioned is Andrew's version of a synthesis of witchcraft and the methods of Austin Osman Spare...\"</ref> and author-occultist [[Kenneth Grant]]. Chumbley was familiar with and respected Grant's work and was a member of Grant's [[Ordo Templi Orientis (Typhonian)|Ordo Templi Orientis]] from 1993 to 1999,<ref>Evans (2007), p. 339</ref> operating an affiliated magical lodge.<ref name=\"Openingthe Way\">Chumbley, Andrew, 'Opening the Way for the Daemons of the Void', ''Starfire'' Vol. II, No. 2, 1998.</ref> Spare's philosophy of the ''Kia'' almost certainly influenced the \"non-dual gnosis\" which is a key element in Chumbley's system, although the similar \"doctrine of the void\" (''Shunyavata''), a foundation concept of Tantrism, is also likely to have affected Chumbley's work through the ''[[Uttara Kaula]] Sampradaya'', of which he claimed to be an initiate.<ref name=\"kaula\">Chumbley, Andrew, 'The Golden Chain and the Lonely Road: a typological study of Initiatory Transmissions within the Sabbatic Tradition', ''The Cauldron'' no. 94, November 1999.</ref> In ''The Azo\u00ebtia'' Chumbley presents \"Will, Desire, Belief\" as a threefold unity operating in sorcery; this is ultimately derived from Spare's work, although the primary textual source is Grant.<ref name=\"Images\">Grant, Kenneth, ''Images & Oracles of Austin Osman Spare'', Muller 1975, Fulgur Limited 2005.</ref> The use of [[Sigil (magic)|sigil]]s and magical glyphs in Chumbley's work also suggests a derivation from Spare, though classical magical [[grimoire]]s such as the ''[[Key of Solomon]]'' and the ''[[The Lesser Key of Solomon|Go\u00ebtia]]'' provide an earlier precedent.\n\n''The Azo\u00ebtia'' and Chumbley's subsequent writings demonstrate his familiarity with a broad range of Western esoteric doctrines including [[Hermetic Qabalah|Qabalah]], [[Enochian Magic]], the magic of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] and the Thelemic school of [[Aleister Crowley]]. Another influence was the neo-[[Sufi]] author [[Idries Shah]], particularly his theories concerning possible connections between witchcraft and various near-eastern cults such as the [[Yezidi]], [[Mandaeans]], [[Sufis]] and [[Zoroastrians]].<ref name=\"Hekas\" /><ref>These connections are proposed in {{cite book |last=Daraul |first=Arkon |authorlink=Arkon Daraul |title=A History of Secret Societies |isbn=0-8065-0857-4 |year=1961 |publisher=Citadel Press}} [[Idries Shah]] quotes Daraul in ''The Sufis'' (1964), adding little, however 'Arkon Daraul' is widely thought to be one of the many pseudonyms of Shah.</ref> Chumbley addressed these themes, citing Shah's work, in his book ''Qutub: The Point'' (1995).\n\nRegarding his sources, drawn from both literature and direct contact with practitioners of other occult and religious traditions, Chumbley stated: \"In all contexts one may find pieces of magical lore and belief from many disparate times and places, but all are brought to function within the trans-historical arena of the sacred dimension, whether it be the magical circle of Witcherie or the Ninefold Plot of Sigaldry.\"<ref name=\"WhatIsTradCraft\"/> Schulke observed that \"Chumbley's grimoire ''Azo\u00ebtia'', though wholly a reification of traditional British witchcraft, makes use of [[Mesopotamian mythology|Sumerian]], [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian]], [[Yezidi]], [[Arabian mythology|Arabic]], and [[Aztec mythology|Aztec]] iconography, among others.\"<ref name=\"WayWaymark\"/>\n\n==Doctrine and method==\nChumbley's work promotes a doctrine of 'Transcendental Sorcery', founded on his belief that all forms of magic arise from a single source, which he termed the 'Magical Quintessence': \"Magick is the transmutability of the Quintessence of all nature ... Sorcery is the knowledge of the universal points of transmutation. Its Art is to cultivate the ability to manipulate these foci of power in accordance with Will, Desire and Belief.\"<ref name=\"CauldronInterview\"/>\n\nChumbley considered the practice of willed dreaming essential as a means of interacting directly and consciously with the spiritual dimensions he called 'the High Sabbat'; according to him \"Every word, deed and thought can empower, magnetise, and establish points of receptivity for a magical dream, likewise any of these means can do the opposite&mdash;fixating perception in a manner that is not receptive&mdash;that seals the soul in the body instead of enabling it to go forth at will.\"<ref name=\"CauldronInterview\"/> In conjunction with dreaming and trance experience Chumbley used [[automatic writing]] and [[automatic drawing|drawing]] to manifest the knowledge drawn from ritual magic; these procedures, in which the magician offers her or himself as a vehicle for the forces summoned instead of using another as [[Mediumship|medium]], is uncommon in the Western occult tradition - one modern exemplar being Austin Osman Spare. The results of Chumbley's practices can be seen in his drawings and sigillisations. Chumbley believed that the natural manifestation of magical [[gnosis]] and power occurs through creative activity: \"Dreaming and the mutual translation of dreamt ritual and ritual-as-dreamt form the basic rationale and context for our work. The active discourse between initiates and our spirit-patrons inspires and motivates this dreaming. This is demonstrably manifest in the magical artistry of individual initiates, whether through text, ritual performance, song, tapestry, craftsmanship, or image.\"<ref name=\"OccultArt\">Occult Art Gallery website, see link below.</ref>\n\n==Written and illustrated works==\n\n===''The Azo\u00ebtia''===\nChumbley's first book ''The Azo\u00ebtia'' was published privately by the author in 1992 as a softcover volume under the Xoanon imprint. The work received positive reviews from other contemporary practitioners including Jan Fries<ref name=\"FriesReview\">Review by Fries published in ''The Nuit-Isis Reader'', [[Mandrake of Oxford]], 1993.</ref> and [[Phil Hine]].<ref name=\"HineReview\">Review by Phil Hine published in ''Pagan News'', London, June 1992.</ref>\n\nDescribed as \"...a complete recension of Sabbatic theory and praxis, relating the Three Great Rites of Ingress, Congress, and Egress, together with a detailed exposition of the 22 Letters of the Sorcerer's Alphabet\",<ref name=\"OccultArt\"/> the book forms a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of Chumbley's system and is the core text for practitioners wishing to study and practice the Sabbatic path of magic. A tenth anniversary edition, revised to include further textual and illustrative material was issued by Xoanon Publishing on October 31, 2002, as ''Azo\u00ebtia (Sethos Edition)''. Part of the book's significance in modern occult literature lies in its conscious reinvention of the format of the \"grimoire\", or sorcerer's instruction book.\n\nGavin Semple hailed ''The Azo\u00ebtia'' as \"a very different type of book; a genuine Grimoire, likely the only one to be published in modern times; [...] ''The Azo\u00ebtia'' is a work of breathtaking power and passion, in whose pages magic is restored to its position as the Sacred Art, the Sabbatic Craft is revealed as a living and very vital tradition.\"<ref name=\"SempleAzoetia\">Semple, Gavin (1994) 'The Azo\u00ebtia - reviewed by Gavin Semple', ''Starfire'' Vol. I, No. 2, 1994, p. 194.</ref>\n\n===''Qutub: The Point''===\n''Qutub: The Point'' followed in 1995, published for Xoanon by Fulgur Limited, in which Chumbley combined illustrations and poetry with the intent of creating a telesmatic volume. The illustrations demonstrated that Chumbley's skills as a draughtsman were advancing quickly. The book was described as follows: \"This work treats of the Arcanum of the Opposer, a magical formula of the Crooked Path concerning the Powers of Self-overcoming. The book consists of an arcane poetic text in 72 verses, a detailed commentary in critical prose, and a substantial glossary of esoteric terms and names. The whole is illustrated throughout with [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] and sigillic depictions of the Opposer's composite mysteries.\"<ref name=\"Xoanon\"/> Issued in several different hard bindings as standard, deluxe and private editions, copies of ''Qutub'' included unique additions such as hand-drawn [[talisman]]s or [[Sigil (magic)|sigillised]] inscriptions.\n\nA second printing of ''Qutub'', in two editions, was issued by Xoanon in March 2009. The standard edition is limited to 700 hardbound copies. The deluxe hardbound, slipcased edition is limited to 72 copies.\n\nMichael Staley, a senior member of the Typhonian OTO and editor of Starfire Magazine, described the [[Kabbalah#Hermetic Qabalah|Qabalistic]] concept of the book as follows: \"Qutub is the Point.

Chumbley''' (15 September 1967 \u2013 15 September 2004) was an [[England|English]] practitioner and theorist of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], and a writer, poet and artist. He was Magister of the UK-based magical group Cultus Sabbati.<ref>Evans (2007), p. 212</ref>\n\n==Career==\nChumbley published several limited edition books through his private press Xoanon Publishing, and had many articles printed in occult magazines. Their subject was the doctrine and practice of a tradition of sorcery which he called '[[Sabbatic Craft]]', a term which, according to Chumbley, \"describes the way in which elements of witch-lore, [[Sabbath (witchcraft)|Sabbath]] mythology and imagery were being employed in the [[cunning folk|cunning-craft]] tradition into which I was originally inducted\".<ref name=\"CauldronInterview\">\"An Interview With Andrew D. Chumbley\", ''The Cauldron'' no. 103, February 2002.</ref> He claimed that this tradition was founded in two lineages of [[Traditional Witchcraft|traditional witchcraft]], both pre-dating \"those modern revivalist forms of witchcraft, which have become generically nominalised as 'wicca'\".<ref name=\"Hekas\">Chumbley, Andrew, \"Hekas\", ''The Cauldron'' no. 74, November 1994.</ref> Chumbley's early articles were published in the [[chaos magic]] journal ''[[Chaos International]]''; later articles appeared in ''Starfire'', journal of the [[Ordo Templi Orientis (Typhonian)|Typhonian OTO]], and in the long-established British witchcraft journal ''The Cauldron''. [[Daniel A. Schulke]] succeeded him as Magister of Cultus Sabbati.\n\n==Personality==\nIn an obituary his close friend [[Michael Howard (Witch)|Michael Howard]], a well-known occult writer and publisher of ''The Cauldron'', described Chumbley as \"a man of the land, rural in both birth and character. He fitted totally within the traditional archetypal parameters of the English (and specifically Essex) [[cunning man]].\" Howard recalled Chumbley\u2019s kindness, generosity and sense of humour: \"To outsiders Andrew could sometimes appear to be aloof, intense and serious to the point of obsession... However, if he met kindred spirits of sincerity and honour, who shared his interests and serious intent, he would willingly go out of his way to offer them help and guidance on the Path... In fact he was a natural teacher and, like all good occult teachers, acted as a catalyst in the lives of his students.\"<ref name=\"Obituary\">Howard, M., 'Andrew D. Chumbley', ''The Cauldron'' no. 114, November 2004.</ref>\n\n==Influences==\nAlthough Chumbley was mainly known for his involvement with English [[traditional witchcraft]],<ref name=\"Hutton\">Hutton, Ronald, ''The Triumph of The Moon'', Oxford University Press 2001.</ref> primarily that of [[East Anglia]],<ref name=\"WhatIsTradCraft\">Chumbley, Andrew, \"What is Traditional Craft?\", ''The Cauldron'' no. 81, August 1996.

According to Schulke, \"Chumbley's magical work spanned many fields of sorcerous influence, including [[Sufism]], left-hand [[Tantra]] and Petro [[Haitian Vodou|Voodoo]]\".<ref name=\"WayWaymark\">Schulke, Daniel A. \"Way and Waymark\", ''The Cauldron'' no. 122, November 2006.</ref> Other influences included the artist-occultist [[Austin Osman Spare]]<ref>Evans (2007), p. 213: \"The 'sabbatic craft' mentioned is Andrew's version of a synthesis of witchcraft and the methods of Austin Osman Spare...\"</ref> and author-occultist [[Kenneth Grant]]. Chumbley was familiar with and respected Grant's work and was a member of Grant's [[Ordo Templi Orientis (Typhonian)|Ordo Templi Orientis]] from 1993 to 1999,<ref>Evans (2007), p. 339</ref> operating an affiliated magical lodge.<ref name=\"Openingthe Way\">Chumbley, Andrew, 'Opening the Way for the Daemons of the Void', ''Starfire'' Vol. II, No. 2, 1998.</ref> Spare's philosophy of the ''Kia'' almost certainly influenced the \"non-dual gnosis\" which is a key element in Chumbley's system, although the similar \"doctrine of the void\" (''Shunyavata''), a foundation concept of Tantrism, is also likely to have affected Chumbley's work through the ''[[Uttara Kaula]] Sampradaya'', of which he claimed to be an initiate.<ref name=\"kaula\">Chumbley, Andrew, 'The Golden Chain and the Lonely Road: a typological study of Initiatory Transmissions within the Sabbatic Tradition', ''The Cauldron'' no. 94, November 1999.</ref> In ''The Azo\u00ebtia'' Chumbley presents \"Will, Desire, Belief\" as a threefold unity operating in sorcery; this is ultimately derived from Spare's work, although the primary textual source is Grant.<ref name=\"Images\">Grant, Kenneth, ''Images & Oracles of Austin Osman Spare'', Muller 1975, Fulgur Limited 2005.</ref> The use of [[Sigil (magic)|sigil]]s and magical glyphs in Chumbley's work also suggests a derivation from Spare, though classical magical [[grimoire]]s such as the ''[[Key of Solomon]]'' and the ''[[The Lesser Key of Solomon|Go\u00ebtia]]'' provide an earlier precedent.\n\n''The Azo\u00ebtia'' and Chumbley's subsequent writings demonstrate his familiarity with a broad range of Western esoteric doctrines including [[Hermetic Qabalah|Qabalah]], [[Enochian Magic]], the magic of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] and the Thelemic school of [[Aleister Crowley]]. Another influence was the neo-[[Sufi]] author [[Idries Shah]], particularly his theories concerning possible connections between witchcraft and various near-eastern cults such as the [[Yezidi]], [[Mandaeans]], [[Sufis]] and [[Zoroastrians]].<ref name=\"Hekas\" /><ref>These connections are proposed in {{cite book |last=Daraul |first=Arkon |authorlink=Arkon Daraul |title=A History of Secret Societies |isbn=0-8065-0857-4 |year=1961 |publisher=Citadel Press}} [[Idries Shah]] quotes Daraul in ''The Sufis'' (1964), adding little, however 'Arkon Daraul' is widely thought to be one of the many pseudonyms of Shah.</ref> Chumbley addressed these themes, citing Shah's work, in his book ''Qutub: The Point'' (1995).\n\nRegarding his sources, drawn from both literature and direct contact with practitioners of other occult and religious traditions, Chumbley stated: \"In all contexts one may find pieces of magical lore and belief from many disparate times and places, but all are brought to function within the trans-historical arena of the sacred dimension, whether it be the magical circle of Witcherie or the Ninefold Plot of Sigaldry.\"<ref name=\"WhatIsTradCraft\"/> Schulke observed that \"Chumbley's grimoire ''Azo\u00ebtia'', though wholly a reification of traditional British witchcraft, makes use of [[Mesopotamian mythology|Sumerian]], [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian]], [[Yezidi]], [[Arabian mythology|Arabic]], and [[Aztec mythology|Aztec]] iconography, among others.\"<ref name=\"WayWaymark\"/>\n\n==Doctrine and method==\nChumbley's work promotes a doctrine of 'Transcendental Sorcery', founded on his belief that all forms of magic arise from a single source, which he termed the 'Magical Quintessence': \"Magick is the transmutability of the Quintessence of all nature ... Sorcery is the knowledge of the universal points of transmutation. Its Art is to cultivate the ability to manipulate these foci of power in accordance with Will, Desire and Belief.\"<ref name=\"CauldronInterview\"/>\n\nChumbley considered the practice of willed dreaming essential as a means of interacting directly and consciously with the spiritual dimensions he called 'the High Sabbat'; according to him \"Every word, deed and thought can empower, magnetise, and establish points of receptivity for a magical dream, likewise any of these means can do the opposite&mdash;fixating perception in a manner that is not receptive&mdash;that seals the soul in the body instead of enabling it to go forth at will.\"<ref name=\"CauldronInterview\"/> In conjunction with dreaming and trance experience Chumbley used [[automatic writing]] and [[automatic drawing|drawing]] to manifest the knowledge drawn from ritual magic; these procedures, in which the magician offers her or himself as a vehicle for the forces summoned instead of using another as [[Mediumship|medium]], is uncommon in the Western occult tradition - one modern exemplar being Austin Osman Spare. The results of Chumbley's practices can be seen in his drawings and sigillisations. Chumbley believed that the natural manifestation of magical [[gnosis]] and power occurs through creative activity: \"Dreaming and the mutual translation of dreamt ritual and ritual-as-dreamt form the basic rationale and context for our work. The active discourse between initiates and our spirit-patrons inspires and motivates this dreaming. This is demonstrably manifest in the magical artistry of individual initiates, whether through text, ritual performance, song, tapestry, craftsmanship, or image.\"<ref name=\"OccultArt\">Occult Art Gallery website, see link below.</ref>\n\n==Written and illustrated works==\n\n===''The Azo\u00ebtia''===\nChumbley's first book ''The Azo\u00ebtia'' was published privately by the author in 1992 as a softcover volume under the Xoanon imprint. The work received positive reviews from other contemporary practitioners including Jan Fries<ref name=\"FriesReview\">Review by Fries published in ''The Nuit-Isis Reader'', [[Mandrake of Oxford]], 1993.</ref> and [[Phil Hine]].<ref name=\"HineReview\">Review by Phil Hine published in ''Pagan News'', London, June 1992.</ref>\n\nDescribed as \"...a complete recension of Sabbatic theory and praxis, relating the Three Great Rites of Ingress, Congress, and Egress, together with a detailed exposition of the 22 Letters of the Sorcerer's Alphabet\",<ref name=\"OccultArt\"/> the book forms a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of Chumbley's system and is the core text for practitioners wishing to study and practice the Sabbatic path of magic. A tenth anniversary edition, revised to include further textual and illustrative material was issued by Xoanon Publishing on October 31, 2002, as ''Azo\u00ebtia (Sethos Edition)''. Part of the book's significance in modern occult literature lies in its conscious reinvention of the format of the \"grimoire\", or sorcerer's instruction book.\n\nGavin Semple hailed ''The Azo\u00ebtia'' as \"a very different type of book; a genuine Grimoire, likely the only one to be published in modern times; [...] ''The Azo\u00ebtia'' is a work of breathtaking power and passion, in whose pages magic is restored to its position as the Sacred Art, the Sabbatic Craft is revealed as a living and very vital tradition.\"<ref name=\"SempleAzoetia\">Semple, Gavin (1994) 'The Azo\u00ebtia - reviewed by Gavin Semple', ''Starfire'' Vol. I, No. 2, 1994, p. 194.</ref>\n\n===''Qutub: The Point''===\n''Qutub: The Point'' followed in 1995, published for Xoanon by Fulgur Limited, in which Chumbley combined illustrations and poetry with the intent of creating a telesmatic volume. The illustrations demonstrated that Chumbley's skills as a draughtsman were advancing quickly. The book was described as follows: \"This work treats of the Arcanum of the Opposer, a magical formula of the Crooked Path concerning the Powers of Self-overcoming. The book consists of an arcane poetic text in 72 verses, a detailed commentary in critical prose, and a substantial glossary of esoteric terms and names. The whole is illustrated throughout with [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] and sigillic depictions of the Opposer's composite mysteries.\"<ref name=\"Xoanon\"/> Issued in several different hard bindings as standard, deluxe and private editions, copies of ''Qutub'' included unique additions such as hand-drawn [[talisman]]s or [[Sigil (magic)|sigillised]] inscriptions.\n\nA second printing of ''Qutub'', in two editions, was issued by Xoanon in March 2009. The standard edition is limited to 700 hardbound copies. The deluxe hardbound, slipcased edition is limited to 72 copies.\n\nMichael Staley, a senior member of the Typhonian OTO and editor of Starfire Magazine, described the [[Kabbalah#Hermetic Qabalah|Qabalistic]] concept of the book as follows: \"Qutub is the Point. Its root, QTB, enumerates as 111. We have immediately the essence of the matter, since 'The Point' suggests Kether and 111 suggests Aleph, the Fool, Atu 0, etc. 'The Point' is the deliciously-sharp point of insight into the reality beyond and underlying its expression in terms of duality.
