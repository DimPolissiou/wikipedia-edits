This was further reinforced by another long range [[Rhys Williams (rugby league)|Rhys Williams]] score early in the second half, the leading marksmen's fifth try of the campaign, but the away side were soon to extinguish any realistic aspirations of an unlikely comeback and the remainder of the contest saw the teams trade four tries, a [[Kieran Dixon]] brace in a season-best-to-date fourteen point personal haul unable to prevent a (26-38) defeat.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.skysports.com/rugby-league/london-vs-huddersfield/50416|title=Super League: Akuila Uate scores twice in Giants win |work=Sky Sports|date=31 March 2019|accessdate=1 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===April===\nOn the first evening of the month [[London Broncos]] were drawn away to play [[2019 RFL Championship|Betfred Championship]] club, [[Halifax R.L.F.C.]] in Round 5 of the [[2019 Challenge Cup|Coral Challenge Cup]], with the tie to be played on Thursday 11 April.\n\n[[London Broncos]] returned to [[Super League]] action on the month's first Friday, with a fixture away at high-flying [[Warrington Wolves]].

The away side were to edge ahead again early in the second half with an unconverted try, but a second [[Ryan Morgan]] effort and a sixth four-pointer of the season from [[Jay Pitts]], a goal scored by [[Kieran Dixon]] looked to have secured an unlikely home victory, only for [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] to hit back in the last minute to level the scores at (22-22) apiece through a [[Regan Grace]] try and a [[Danny Richardson (rugby league)|Danny Richardson]] conversion off the left-hand touchline.\n\n[[London Broncos]] were not to be denied however, and two minutes into extra-time a [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] error coming away from their own goal line afforded the Southerners excellent field position, and when the ball was funnelled back to [[Morgan Smith (rugby league)|Morgan Smith]] he managed to shovel the ball between the sticks for a memorable drop goal, to kick-start scenes of joyous celebrations for all connected with the London club on another unforgettable afternoon in West London.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/48516194|title=Lowly London stun runaway Super League Leaders St Helens|date=9 June 2019|accessdate=10 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nWith confidence high and passports at the ready [[London Broncos]] travelled next to face third placed [[Catalans Dragons]] the following Saturday evening, looking to register back to back [[Super League]] victories for the first time in 2019.\n[[Hull Kingston Rovers]] surprise home win over second-placed  [[Warrington Wolves]] earlier in the day had once again left the [[London Broncos|Broncos]] marooned at the bottom of the table, but this did nothing to deter the capital side from producing a spectacular display of attacking rugby to demolish the French outfit, a [[Rhys Williams (rugby league)|Rhys Williams]] double, taking his tally for the season to eleven, was added to by further scores from [[Kieran Dixon]], [[Elliot Kear]] and man of the match [[Jordan Abdull]], enough to see the visitors record an eye-catching (30-12) victory.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/48594573|title=Bottom side Broncos upset Catalans|date=15 June 2019|accessdate=21 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe triumph in the south of France lifted the [[London Broncos]] competition points tally to twelve and had drawn them  back level again with [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] and [[Leeds Rhinos]], ahead of a crucial [[Sky Sports]] televised fixture against the East Hull side at Ealing's [[Trailfinders Sports Ground]] five days later. [[London Broncos]] were to dominate the majority of the opening stanza and led 8-0 close to half time, a [[Morgan Smith (rugby league)|Morgan Smith]] try, his first for the club, sandwiched between two penalties from the ever reliable boot of [[Kieran Dixon]]. The visitors, under the tutelage of the recently appointed, [[Tony Smith (rugby league, born 1967)|Tony Smith]] needed a riposte, and  energised by a large travelling contingent, hit a purple patch either side of the interval, scoring three unanswered converted tries to leave the Broncos trailing by ten with little over half an hour left. Hull born [[London Broncos|Broncos]] playmaker,  [[Jordan Abdull]] remained determined to showcase his skills in front of a wider TV audience and kept the hosts in the contest, [[Alex Walker (rugby league)|Alex Walker]] soon reducing the deficit at the back end of a set which followed a game-changing 40/20 from the former, before the talented [[Jordan Abdull|stand-off]] himself was given a benefit of doubt four point score, following a close hand-on-ball first [[Rugby league match officials|video referee]] referral. [[Kieran Dixon]] added the extras to both scores to nudge the hosts back into a tenuous lead they were not to lose for a second time, a converted 75th minute [[Rob Butler (rugby league)|Rob Butler]] effort, his first for the club, eventually proving sufficient despite an even later [[Hull Kingston Rovers]]' six point score. The final whistle heralded a release of tension and sparked wild celebrations, similar to those of eleven days earlier following the [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] home victory, and a third consecutive win (26-24)  had hauled [[London Broncos]] from the foot of the [[Super League]] table for the first time in three months, ahead of a Sunday away trip to play-off chasing [[Castleford Tigers]] on the month's last day.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/48679162|title=Broncos beat Hull KR to move off bottom|date=20 June 2019|accessdate=21 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[London Broncos]] winning run came to an abrupt halt in [[West Yorkshire]], as a rampant [[Castleford Tigers]] registered forty points against the capital outfit for a second time in 2019,  tries from [[Kieran Dixon]], another stunning length of the field sprint, and a 12th of the campaign from leading marksmen, [[Rhys Williams (rugby league)|Rhys Williams]] providing little comfort as the [[London Broncos|Broncos]] fell to a disappointing (10-42)<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/48757801|title=Tigers send Broncos bottom with thrashing|date=30 June 2019|accessdate=1 July 2019}}</ref> reversal, a result which consigned them back to the bottom of the [[Super League]] table, albeit level on 14 competition points with [[Hull Kingston Rovers]], [[Huddersfield Giants]], and [[Leeds Rhinos]] with nine matches of the regular season remaining.\n\n===July===\nThe first Saturday of the month saw [[London Broncos]] play host to second placed [[Warrington Wolves]], and in front of another good crowd (2,357) it was the visitors who were to return to [[Cheshire]] with a resounding victory following an impressive six try first half display, a [[Matty Fozard]] second half effort ultimately proving to be of scant consolation as the [[London Broncos|Broncos]] slid to their sixth home reversal of the campaign (6-36).<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/48845617|title=Warrington win to send Broncos bottom|date=6 July 2019|accessdate=15 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[London Broncos]] were back in front of the [[Sky Sports]] TV cameras the following Thursday as they travelled north to the [[KCOM Stadium]], home of third in the table, [[Hull F.C.]].

This was further reinforced by another long range [[Rhys Williams (rugby league)|Rhys Williams]] score early in the second half, the leading marksmen's fifth try of the campaign, but the away side were soon to extinguish any realistic aspirations of an unlikely comeback and the remainder of the contest saw the teams trade four tries, a [[Kieran Dixon]] brace in a season-best-to-date fourteen point personal haul unable to prevent a (26-38) defeat.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.skysports.com/rugby-league/london-vs-huddersfield/50416|title=Super League: Akuila Uate scores twice in Giants win |work=Sky Sports|date=31 March 2019|accessdate=1 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===April===\nOn the first evening of the month [[London Broncos]] were drawn away to play [[2019 RFL Championship|Betfred Championship]] club, [[Halifax R.L.F.C.]] in Round 5 of the [[2019 Challenge Cup|Coral Challenge Cup]], with the tie to be played on Thursday 11 April.\n\n[[London Broncos]] returned to [[Super League]] action on the month's first Friday, with a fixture away at high-flying [[Warrington Wolves]].

The [[London Broncos|Broncos]] hinted at a comeback in the second forty, scoring first and last, through leading try-scorer [[Rhys Williams (rugby league)|Rhys Williams]] and [[Matty Fleming]], but the damage had long been irreparable as the Broncos were downed (10-30) to remain bottom of the [[Super League]] table ahead a trip to champions, [[Wigan Warriors]] in front of the [[Sky Sports]] cameras on the first Thursday in May.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/48021728|title=Salford win keeps London bottom|date=27 April 2019|accessdate=29 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===May===\nWith the season edging towards its mid-point [[London Broncos]] travelled to [[Wigan Warriors]], and in front of a national TV audience acquitted themselves admirably.

The away side were to edge ahead again early in the second half with an unconverted try, but a second [[Ryan Morgan]] effort and a sixth four-pointer of the season from [[Jay Pitts]], a goal scored by [[Kieran Dixon]] looked to have secured an unlikely home victory, only for [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] to hit back in the last minute to level the scores at (22-22) apiece through a [[Regan Grace]] try and a [[Danny Richardson (rugby league)|Danny Richardson]] conversion off the left-hand touchline.\n\n[[London Broncos]] were not to be denied however, and two minutes into extra-time a [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] error coming away from their own goal line afforded the Southerners excellent field position, and when the ball was funnelled back to [[Morgan Smith (rugby league)|Morgan Smith]] he managed to shovel the ball between the sticks for a memorable drop goal, to kick-start scenes of joyous celebrations for all connected with the London club on another unforgettable afternoon in West London.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/48516194|title=Lowly London stun runaway Super League Leaders St Helens|date=9 June 2019|accessdate=10 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nWith confidence high and passports at the ready [[London Broncos]] travelled next to face third placed [[Catalans Dragons]] the following Saturday evening, looking to register back to back [[Super League]] victories for the first time in 2019.\n[[Hull Kingston Rovers]] surprise home win over second-placed  [[Warrington Wolves]] earlier in the day had once again left the [[London Broncos|Broncos]] marooned at the bottom of the table, but this did nothing to deter the capital side from producing a spectacular display of attacking rugby to demolish the French outfit, a [[Rhys Williams (rugby league)|Rhys Williams]] double, taking his tally for the season to eleven, was added to by further scores from [[Kieran Dixon]], [[Elliot Kear]] and man of the match [[Jordan Abdull]], enough to see the visitors record an eye-catching (30-12) victory.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/48594573|title=Bottom side Broncos upset Catalans|date=15 June 2019|accessdate=21 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe triumph in the south of France lifted the [[London Broncos]] competition points tally to twelve and had drawn them  back level again with [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] and [[Leeds Rhinos]], ahead of a crucial [[Sky Sports]] televised fixture against the East Hull side at Ealing's [[Trailfinders Sports Ground]] five days later. [[London Broncos]] were to dominate the majority of the opening stanza and led 8-0 close to half time, a [[Morgan Smith (rugby league)|Morgan Smith]] try, his first for the club, sandwiched between two penalties from the ever reliable boot of [[Kieran Dixon]]. The visitors, under the tutelage of the recently appointed, [[Tony Smith (rugby league, born 1967)|Tony Smith]] needed a riposte, and  energised by a large travelling contingent, hit a purple patch either side of the interval, scoring three unanswered converted tries to leave the Broncos trailing by ten with little over half an hour left. Hull born [[London Broncos|Broncos]] playmaker,  [[Jordan Abdull]] remained determined to showcase his skills in front of a wider TV audience and kept the hosts in the contest, [[Alex Walker (rugby league)|Alex Walker]] soon reducing the deficit at the back end of a set which followed a game-changing 40/20 from the former, before the talented [[Jordan Abdull|stand-off]] himself was given a benefit of doubt four point score, following a close hand-on-ball first [[Rugby league match officials|video referee]] referral. [[Kieran Dixon]] added the extras to both scores to nudge the hosts back into a tenuous lead they were not to lose for a second time, a converted 75th minute [[Rob Butler (rugby league)|Rob Butler]] effort, his first for the club, eventually proving sufficient despite an even later [[Hull Kingston Rovers]]' six point score. The final whistle heralded a release of tension and sparked wild celebrations, similar to those of eleven days earlier following the [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] home victory, and a third consecutive win (26-24)  had hauled [[London Broncos]] from the foot of the [[Super League]] table for the first time in three months, ahead of a Sunday away trip to play-off chasing [[Castleford Tigers]] on the month's last day.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/48679162|title=Broncos beat Hull KR to move off bottom|date=20 June 2019|accessdate=21 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[London Broncos]] winning run came to an abrupt halt in [[West Yorkshire]], as a rampant [[Castleford Tigers]] registered forty points against the capital outfit for a second time in 2019,  tries from [[Kieran Dixon]], another stunning length of the field sprint, and a 12th of the campaign from leading marksmen, [[Rhys Williams (rugby league)|Rhys Williams]] providing little comfort as the [[London Broncos|Broncos]] fell to a disappointing (10-42)<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/48757801|title=Tigers send Broncos bottom with thrashing|date=30 June 2019|accessdate=1 July 2019}}</ref> reversal, a result which consigned them back to the bottom of the [[Super League]] table, albeit level on 14 competition points with [[Hull Kingston Rovers]], [[Huddersfield Giants]], and [[Leeds Rhinos]] with nine matches of the regular season remaining.\n\n===July===\nThe first Saturday of the month saw [[London Broncos]] play host to second placed [[Warrington Wolves]], and in front of another good crowd (2,357) it was the visitors who were to return to [[Cheshire]] with a resounding victory following an impressive six try first half display, a [[Matty Fozard]] second half effort ultimately proving to be of scant consolation as the [[London Broncos|Broncos]] slid to their sixth home reversal of the campaign (6-36).<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/48845617|title=Warrington win to send Broncos bottom|date=6 July 2019|accessdate=15 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[London Broncos]] were back in front of the [[Sky Sports]] TV cameras the following Thursday as they travelled north to the [[KCOM Stadium]], home of third in the table, [[Hull F.C.]].

To their credit, the Londoners battled gamely in the second half and were rewarded with three further four point scores through [[Matty Fleming]], [[Sadiq Adebiyi]] and [[Rob Butler (rugby league)|Rob Butler]], but the weekend was to end with [[London Broncos]] two points adrift of the field following [[Hull KR]]\u2019s dramatic (27-26) golden point victory over [[Castleford Tigers]] and [[Leeds Rhinos]] (44-0) away success at [[Huddersfield Giants]].\n\nThe following Saturday evening saw [[London Broncos]] return to the [[The Jungle (Wheldon Road)|Mend-A-Hose-Jungle]], home to [[Castleford Tigers]] and scene of a heavy Round 20 reversal at the end of June which had ended a season best three match winning streak.\n\nThe [[London Broncos|Broncos]] were to lose again, although this time the contest was much closer, and they led (6-4) at the break following recent [[Sydney Roosters]] signing, [[Brock Lamb]]'s first try for the club. A resolute defensive effort in the second stanza kept the capital outfit firmly in the game, although the hosts were eventually to score 16 unanswered points, leaving the visitors to return south down the [[M1 motorway|M1]] on the wrong end of a (6-20) score line.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/49249961|title=Castleford up to fifth with Broncos win|date=10 August 2019|accessdate=13 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[London Broncos]] were on their travels the following weekend too, returning to the [[south of France]] looking for a repeat of the stunning Round 18 victory over [[Catalans Dragons]] nine weeks previous.\n\n[[Kieran Dixon]] was standout in a terrific team performance as the [[London Broncos|Broncos]] registered a memorable away league double, racing the length of the field to add to an earlier penalty, and his impressive touchline conversion saw the capital outfit lead (8-0) inside the game's opening ten minutes, an advantage they would maintain until the interval. [[Catalans Dragons]] hinted at a comeback soon after the break, crossing for an unconverted try, but a sweeping move orchestrated on the [[London Broncos|Broncos]] left hand edge ended with [[Alex Walker (rugby league)|Alex Walker]] touching down under the sticks, the full-back's fifth try of the campaign, and with [[Kieran Dixon]] adding the extras and another penalty for home side indiscretion soon after, the contest was as good as over, confirmed when [[Brock Lamb]] slotted a long range drop goal, his first for the club.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/49332972|title=Broncos upset Catalans to boost survival hopes|date=17 August 2019|accessdate=19 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe (17-4) win would lift [[London Broncos]] back level on 18 points with [[Hull KR]], who lost a crucial four-pointer at home to relegation rivals, [[Wakefield Trinity]] and [[Huddersfield Giants]], losers at the [[John Smith's Stadium]] to [[Castleford Tigers]] with three matches of the regular season remaining.\n\nThe following weekend saw [[Warrington Wolves]] spring a [[Challenge Cup]] surprise with victory over much fancied [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]], and [[Sheffield Eagles]] emerge victorious over [[Widnes Vikings]] in an all [[Championship]] inaugural [[1895 Cup]] final.\n\n===September===\n\nThe fortnight interlude had given [[London Broncos]] plenty of time to re-energise following their exertions in the heat of the [[Perpignan|South of France]], as they prepared to play host to fellow strugglers, [[Leeds Rhinos]] in the final home fixture of the season.\n\nA sunlit first Sunday afternoon of the month, and a season best and [[Trailfinders Sports Ground]] rugby league record crowd of 3,051 embraced the players, although it would be the large contigent of travelling fans who ended much the happier, their team scoring three tries in each half to all but secure the [[Leeds Rhinos|Rhinos']] [[Super League]] status. The [[London Broncos|Broncos]] battled gamely as ever, and trailing (0-18) at the break briefly threatened another notable comeback early in the second half, a length of the field effort by speedster, [[Kieran Dixon]] following a trademark interception was followed quickly by a fifth try of the campaign by centre, [[Ryan Morgan]] to reduce the deficit to eight, but the West Yorkshiremen were not be denied as the Capital outfit ultimately ran out of steam to succumb to a (10-36) defeat.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/49484502|title=Leeds thump struggling Broncos|date=1 September 2019|accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe loss left the [[London Broncos]] two points adrift of the pack after [[Hull KR]] and [[Huddersfield Giants]] gained unlikely away wins at [[Catalans Dragons]] and [[Hull F.C.]] respectively, and due to a significant adverse points difference, having to realistically win their remaining two matches to secure their own top flight safety.\n\n[[London Broncos]] visited [[Hull KR]] the following Friday evening, the match brought forward from Sunday afternoon to accommodate [[Sky Sports]] TV coverage, and with their season on the line the team produced an outstanding performance to dramatically defeat their relegation threatened hosts. \n \nThe southerners began the match on the front foot and two quick-fire tries from [[Matty Gee]] and [[Brock Lamb]], the latter, whose sublime off the floor pass had set up the former's opener, were twelve points to the good inside the game's opening ten minutes. It was a lead they would hold onto until the interval, despite a converted home try midway through the half. [[Kieran Dixon]] had increased the advantage to (14-6) with a penalty just prior to the break, but any thoughts of a comfortable win were soon dispelled as [[London Broncos|Broncos]]\u2019 tenuous advantage was wiped out within eleven minutes of the restart as the [[Hull KR|Robins]] sought their own safety salvation. Trailing (14-16) and with time fast becoming their enemy, the normally reliable [[Kieran Dixon]] missed a kickable penalty albeit from distance, although ultimately it would not prove costly, as with less than three minutes left on the clock and camped under the backdrop of their own sticks, [[Danny Ward]]'s men exploded up field thanks to a penetrating run from Aussie, [[Ryan Morgan]], eventually dotting down on the left hand edge through erstwhile skipper, [[Jay Pitts]], on the sixth and last tackle of a set they had to score from to retain any chance of saving themselves from an immediate return to the championship.\n\n[[Kieran Dixon]] improved the score and [[London Broncos]] held on for a famous (20-16) victory,<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/49565358|title=Broncos beat Hull KR to extend relegation scrap|date=6 September 2019|accessdate=9 September 2019}}</ref> moving them onto 20 competition points, the same number as [[Hull KR]], [[Huddersfield Giants]], and [[Wakefield Trinity]] to whom they would travel a week later for the last game of a riveting season, the fixture brought forward from the Sunday afternoon to the Friday evening, to align with matches involving the others clubs embroiled in the relegation battle, and to accommodate another [[Sky Sports]] telecast.\n\n[[London Broncos]] emerged from the [[Mobile Rocket Stadium]] dressing rooms in the knowledge their fate remained very much in their own hands, and spurred on by an impressive travelling contingent of 250 supporters who had travelled the 184 miles up the [[M1 motorway]] on a clear blue sky Friday afternoon. Trailing to an early penalty the southern outfit defended resolutely to remain firmly in the contest, but crucially failed to take advantage of a couple of well worked first half opportunities, and as the balmy night wore on suspicion grew that the match might eventually prove to be a bridge too far for [[Danny Ward]]\u2019s battlers, a thought reaffirmed soon after 9.30pm as the hooter sounded to signal defeat (10-19),<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/49653887|title=Wakefield win to relegate London Broncos|date=13 September 2019|accessdate=17 September 2019}}</ref>

The railway is a federally designated [[National Historic Landmark]] and is also designated by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] as a [[List of Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks|Historic Civil Engineering Landmark]].\n\nThe route was originally opened in 1882 by the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|Denver & Rio Grande Railroad]] ([[Denver and Rio Grande Railroad|D&RG]]) to transport [[silver]] and [[gold]] ore mined from the [[San Juan Mountains]]. The line was an extension of the [[Denver and Rio Grande Railroad|D&RG]] {{Track gauge|3ft}} [[Narrow-gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] line from [[Antonito, Colorado]], to [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]]. The last train to operate into [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]] from the east was on December 6, 1968. The states of [[New Mexico]] and [[Colorado]] purchased 64 miles between Antonito and [[Chama, New Mexico]], in 1970 and operates today as the [[Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad|Cumbres & Toltec Scenic Railroad]]. Trackage between [[Chama, New Mexico|Chama]] and [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]] was removed by 1971.\n\nThe line from [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]] to [[Silverton, Colorado|Silverton]] has run continuously since 1881, although it is now a tourist and heritage line hauling passengers, and is one of the few places in the U.S. which has seen continuous use of [[steam locomotive]]s. In March 1981, the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|Denver & Rio Grande Western]] sold the line and the D&SNG was formed.<ref name=\"prn-mar91\">{{cite journal| last=Farewell| first=R.C.| date=March 1991| title=Narrow Gauge in a 'Grande Tradition: Riding the Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad| journal=[[Pacific RailNews]]| pages=36\u201341| publisher=[[Interurban Press]]}}</ref>\n\nSome rolling stock dates back to the 1880s. Trains operate from [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]] to the Cascade Wye in the winter months and Durango\u2013Silverton during the summer months. Durango depot was built in January 1882 and has been preserved in its original form.<ref name=\"prn-mar91\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:DurangoSilverton2.jpg|thumb|left|Train entering Silverton]]\n[[File:Painted Train first trip Silverton.JPG|thumb|Photo of the first trip of the \"Painted Train\".]]\n[[File:Arrival of Silver Vista Observation car 1947.JPG|thumb|The D&RG Silverton arrives pulling the glass-topped \"Silver Vista\" observation car in 1947.]]\n[[William Jackson Palmer]] (1836\u20131908) was a former Union General (serving in the [[American Civil War]]) who came to Colorado after managing the construction of the Kansas Pacific Railroad into Denver in 1870. Prior to the war, he had risen within the ranks of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] serving as secretary to the president. After arriving in Denver, he formulated a plan to build a {{Track gauge|3ft}} narrow-gauge railroad southward from Denver to El Paso, Texas<ref>Athearn, Robert G. \"Rebel of the Rockies\" Yale University Press 1962 pp. 10,15.</ref> (see [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad]]). In 1871, the Denver & Rio Grande Railway began to lay rails south from Denver. Palmer and his associates had agreed that the choice of {{Track gauge|3ft}} narrow gauge would be well suited to the mountainous country, and relatively less expensive construction costs would enhance the viability of the new railroad. The original north-south plans of the D&RG eventually expanded to include extensions throughout the booming mining country of central and southwestern Colorado.\n\nOn August 5, 1881 the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|Denver & Rio Grande Railway]] arrived in [[Durango, Colorado]]. The new town was founded by the D&RG in 1880, chiefly through the talents and organization of General Palmer's business partner, [[William Abraham Bell|Dr. William Bell]]. Construction to [[Silverton, Colorado]] began that fall. Only 11 months later, the D&RG reached Silverton on July 10, 1882. Trains hauling passengers and freight began immediately. The Denver & Rio Grande Railway soon re-emerged as the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad (1886) and ultimately began operating as the Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad (D&RGW) on July 31, 1921 after re-organization of the Colorado lines and Rio Grande Western of Utah.<ref>Athearn, Robert G. \"Rebel of the Rockies\" Yale University Press 1962. pp. 241\u2013243</ref> Eventually, the railroad became widely known as the \"Rio Grande\".\n\nThe Silverton branch, as it became known, struggled under D&RG ownership following the [[Panic of 1893]] and the end of free coinage of silver. Typical of many portions of the surviving narrow-gauge branches into the middle of the twentieth century, the line faced sagging revenue due to ever-declining mining ventures, highway trucking competition, and insignificant passenger revenue. Annual snowslides and several major floods on the branch would only continue to challenge the railroad's ability to survive.\n\n=== The Silverton ===\nAfter World War II, domestic tourism began to grow across the country, and the Silverton branch of the railroad would benefit. Bolstered by national exposure via [[Hollywood]] movies being filmed along the line in the late 1940s, the railroad created ''The Silverton'', a summer-only train service on June 24, 1947.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417000300/http://www.drgw.org:80/data/passenger/Passenger.htm|title=Passenger|date=2015-04-17|access-date=2018-05-06}}</ref> A short time later, the railroad adorned a locomotive and four coaches with a colorful yellow paint scheme and launched modest public promotion. With this effort, \"The Painted Train\" officially started a new era of tourism that continues to this day. Freight traffic, however, continued to decline and during the 1950s, ''The Silverton'' operated as a [[mixed train]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.drgw.net/gallery/v/PassengerTTs/PTTSystem1Jun1952/|title=D&RGW System Passenger Timetable - 1-Jun-1952|website=www.drgw.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-06}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1960s, a modernized D&RGW did not see the Silverton Branch as worthy to maintain and a petition was filed with governmental agencies to abandon the route. The [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] declined to grant the request due to the continued increase in tourist patronage. Following the ICC's ruling, the railroad reluctantly responded by investing in additional rolling stock, track maintenance, and improvements to the Durango depot. The railroad purchased some of the property around the depot, cleaned up the block extending north to Sixth Street, and facilitated the opening of gift shops and other tourist-friendly businesses. As ridership continued to grow, the D&RGW operated a second train to Silverton on certain days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rgmhs.org/data/advertising/Advertising.htm|title=Rio Grande Advertising|website=rgmhs.org|access-date=2018-05-06}}</ref>\n\n=== The 1970s ===\nSince 1971, the Silverton branch and nearby [[Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad]] were the only remnants of the Rio Grande's once extensive narrow-gauge system.<ref name=\"prn-mar91\" /> During the late 1970s, the D&RGW was actively trying to sell the Silverton branch, and in 1979, Charles Bradshaw, a Florida citrus grower, offered the railroad a legitimate opportunity to divest itself of the now isolated route. On October 5, 1980, ''The Silverton'' made its last run under D&RGW ownership and after operating a work train the following day, the railroad finally concluded its {{Track gauge|3ft}} narrow-gauge train operations,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.trainorders.com/discussion/read.php?10,3981393|title=Audio Portrait \u2013 The last Train on the Silverton Branch|work=Trainorders.com Discussion|access-date=2018-05-06}}</ref> bringing to a close an era that began 110 years earlier with its narrow-gauge railroad from Denver to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]].\n\n=== Present day ===\nIn June 2018, the railroad shut down for several weeks due to a wildfire, named the \"416 Fire\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/5822/|title=416 Fire Information - InciWeb the Incident Information System|website=inciweb.nwcg.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-11}}</ref> which was fought by two air tankers, six helicopters and some 400 firefighters on the ground.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://denver.cbslocal.com/2018/06/05/durango-wildfire-416-fire-train/|title=Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad Closed Due To 416 Fire|date=2018-06-05|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en}}</ref> An estimated {{Convert|54129|acres|ha}} of the San Juan National Forest were burned, with losses estimated at more than $31 million.

His plans were fulfilled with the March 25, 1981, acquisition of the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|D&RGW]]'s {{convert|45|mi|km|adj=on}} Silverton branch and all of its structures and rolling stock.<ref name=\"prn-mar91\" />\n\nThe improvements to the railroad in the 1980s would prove to be the most dramatic growth on the Silverton Branch since the earlier part of the century. Bolstered by the assistance of former Rio Grande operating managers and a relatively sizeable staff of new employees, Bradshaw's plans were set in motion immediately. Included in the sale were former D&RGW locomotives and rolling stock that had not seen service in Durango for many years. \"K-36\" and \"K-37\" class locomotives were eventually restored to operating condition and these larger class of engines operated to Silverton for the first time ever following bridge and right-of-way improvements to the line. 1880s vintage coaches were exquisitely restored and new coaches were added to the roster of rolling stock. For the first time in many years, doubleheaded trains (trains with two locomotives) and additional scheduled trains were employed to handle the continually growing passenger trade. The Durango yard facilities also saw dramatic improvements. An extension was added to the old roundhouse, a new car shop was built on the site of the original \"car barn\", and the depot saw extensive repair and internal modifications. The workforce grew with the railroad, and Durango's tourist image expanded as new businesses and revamping of the old railroad town continued to take shape. The original 1881 Durango [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] was completely destroyed by fire in the winter of 1989. All six operable locomotives had been inside at the time and were damaged, but not beyond repair. All locomotives were eventually restored to operating condition. A new roundhouse was constructed on the same site, opening in early 1990, and its facade made use of bricks salvaged from the original building.<ref name=\"prn-mar91\" />\n\nIn March 1997 Bradshaw sold the D&SNG to First American Railways, Inc., located in Hollywood, Florida. Then in July 1998 the railroad was sold again to American Heritage Railways. At the time, American Heritage Railways was headquartered in Coral Gables, Florida. Since then their headquarters have been moved to [[Durango, Colorado]]. The D&SNGRR has two museums, one each in [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]] and [[Silverton, Colorado|Silverton]].\n\n===Management===\n*[[Allen C.

There are three classes, [[Rio Grande class K-28|K-28]], [[Rio Grande class K-36|K-36]], and [[Rio Grande class K-37|K-37]], which are all based on wheel arrangement and pulling power of the locomotive.\n\nThe ''K'' represents the nickname [[2-8-2|\"Mikado\"]] that describes a locomotive with two non-powered, pivoting wheels in front of eight driving wheels, which are connected to driving rods powered by the engine's pistons, and finally two non-powered trailer wheels located under the cab. The name comes from the fact that the first significant use of the type was a series built by [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] for the Japanese Railways in 1887.\n\nThe numbers 28 and 36 designate the [[Tractive force|tractive effort]] (pulling force) of the locomotives in thousands of pounds. The tractive effort of K-28s is rated at {{convert|27500|lbf|kN|3|lk=on}}, and the tractive effort of a K-36 is a {{convert|36200|lbf|kN|3}}. The weight of a K-28 with a full tender is {{convert|254500|lb|kg|0}}, and a K-36 weighs {{convert|286600|lb|kg|0}} with a full tender.\n\n====470 series====\n{{Main|Rio Grande class K-28}}\n[[File:Durango & Silverton Rly 2-8-2 473 06.90R.jpg|thumb|right|D & S 2-8-2 K-28 locomotive No. 473 on arrival at Silverton with a train from Durango in June 1990]]\n[[File:Durango & Silverton Engine 476.jpg|thumb|Engine 476 in operation, 2000]]\nThe 470 series or {{whyte|2-8-2}} K-28 class locomotives were ten engines designed for freight service along the [[Denver and Rio Grande Railroad|D&RG]].<ref name=\"roster\" /> They were built by the [[Schenectady Locomotive Works]]<ref name=SLW /> of the [[American Locomotive Company]] ([[American Locomotive Company|ALCO]]) in [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1923. The K-28s have {{convert|28000|lbf|kN|3|abbr=on}}. of tractive effort, superheated, and the boilers are fed by two non-lifting injectors. Air brakes are 6-ET automatic and also feature a straight air secondary braking system for daily passenger trains. Due to their smaller size these engines are often used on the Durango & Silverton for shorter trains, usually the first or last on the schedule, and often for helper service or sectioned trains. Despite being smaller than the K-36 class locomotives, older, and less powerful, the engine crews tend to favor a trip on these engines because the design ALCO used was superior in balance and servicing. Firing can be tricky when the engine is working hard, as the clam&nbsp;shell-style [[Glossary of boiler terms#Firedoor|firedoors]] tend to pull into the backhead of the boiler due to the draft, and if any flues in the boiler are leaking, the loss of draft on the fire is much harder to work around than on the K-36 locomotives. Firing while the engine is working hard is done with a large \"heel\" pattern, generally with as little coal on the flue sheet as possible, and gradually sloping the fire bed towards the door sheet to the height or higher than the firedoors. This results in the draft being forced through the fire bed in the thinner areas towards the flue sheet, which usually is hindered by the lack of draft between the grates and the arch brick. New firemen sometimes have a hard time learning this, because the art of \"reading\" a fire takes time to learn, and the amount of time working on the K-28 class locomotives is far reduced compared to the railroads usual K-36 workhorses, which have a larger firebox and are more forgiving in technique.\n[[File:Denver and Rio Grande excursion at Hermosa 1963.JPG|thumb|Locomotives 473 and 478 at Hermosa on a D&RGW excursion in 1963.]]\nOut of the original ten only three 470s remain, and all are owned by the D&SNG. The other seven were requisitioned by the [[United States Army]] in 1942 to be used on the [[White Pass & Yukon Route]] in [[Alaska]] during [[World War II]]. They were later dismantled for scrap in 1946.\n\nLocomotives 473, 476, and 478 operated on many parts of the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|D&RGW]]. Engine 473 served frequently on the ''[[Chili Line]]'' that operated between Antonito, Colorado and Santa Fe, New Mexico. 473 served on the ''Chili Line'' until it was abandoned in 1941. 476 and 478 saw an extensive service on the ''[[San Juan Express|San Juan]]'' passenger train, which ran between Durango, Colorado and Alamosa, Colorado until 1951. 473, 476, and 478 operated on the Silverton Branch from the 1950s through 1980 and are still in service today.\n\nIn July 2015, the D&SNG and C&TS had announced that a proposed trade that proposed that the 478 should go to [[Chama, New Mexico|Chama]], and in exchange the D&SNG would get [[Rio Grande class K-36|K-36 class No. 483]], which had not seen operation in several years. For many months this was a highly debated subject between rail enthusiasts. People in favor of the swap stated that the 478 would help own a historic fleet in Chama, working alongside a K-27, K-36s and K-37s, as well as the fact that the 483 would see service again. Those that were against the trade argued that the 478 would just sit in Chama and rust away and argued that 483 could still be restored. In the end, it was decided between the commission in Chama to not go through with the swap. To this day, the swap proposal is still debated amongst railfans.\n\nSince the swap failed to go through, the D&SNG announced in June 2016 that they were going to restore 476 and place 478 in the museum.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n#473 is undergoing a firebox rebuild and conversion to [[Fuel oil|oil]] as of February 2020.\n#476 is operational.\n#478 is on display in the D&SNG Museum awaiting a rebuild in the distant future.<ref name=SLW />[[File:K-28 -473 at Cascade Canyon Wye.jpg|thumb|K-28 #473 awaits departure from Cascade Canyon in May 2016.]]\n\n====480 series====\n{{Main|Rio Grande class K-36}}\n[[File:D&SNG 482&480 2006.jpg|thumb|right|K-36 steam locomotives #482 & #480 in Silverton]]\n[[File:Colorado - Silverton 02.jpg|thumb|right|K-36 steam locomotive #481 getting ready for departure from Silverton]]\n[[File:Silverton K-36-Steam-locomotive-486 2012-10-25.JPG|thumb|right|K-36 steam locomotive #486 getting ready for departure from Silverton on October 25, 2012]]\nThe 480 series or K-36 class locomotives were ten engines designed for the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|D&RGW]].

The 480s were used for freight-hauling throughout the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|D&RGW]] {{Track gauge|3ft}} [[Narrow-gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] network. The \"36\" stands for {{convert|36200|lbf|kN|3|abbr=on}}. of [[Tractive force|tractive effort]]. These engines are outside frame Mikados, and all drive wheels have counterbalancing outside of the frame, resulting in the utilitarian look the engines are known for. The engines currently use 6-ET automatic air and the secondary straight air used on regular service equipment. The railroad runs 12-car passenger trains behind these engines; however more cars require the train to be doubleheaded. Despite popular belief that the railroad does not doublehead trains out of Durango because of smoke, the real reason is the weight restriction on the bridge at 15th Street, not allowing more than one K-36 at a time (K-28 class engines however are still doubleheaded from Durango). The engines were delivered with Master Mechanics design smokeboxes for draft, however at some point the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|D&RGW]] converted them to Andersson (cyclone) front ends. Water is fed to the boiler by two non-lifting injectors. The {{convert|40|sqft|m2|adj=on}} grate surface in the firebox is among the largest built for a [[Narrow-gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] locomotive, and is fed by hand firing. Firing is simpler on these engines compared to the [[Rio Grande class K-28|K-28]]s, however the larger surface area requires more fuel. A typical trip uses around {{convert|3|-|5|ST|LT t|2|lk=on}} on the way up to [[Silverton, Colorado|Silverton]], and another {{convert|1|-|2|ST|LT t|2}} on the return to [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]]. Ergonomically, the engines are less comfortable than the others as well, with the crew seats being further back from the backhead, and the engineer having to lean forward constantly to adjust the throttle and use the sanders. The running gear on the locomotives also tend to wear out faster than the [[American Locomotive Company|ALCO]] designed [[Rio Grande class K-28|K-28]]s, and the resulting pounding rough ride can take a toll on the engine crew.\n\nD&SNG owns four K-36s: Nos. 480, 481, 482, and 486, all of which are operational. The [[Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad]] owns engines 483, 484, 487, 488, and 489. Locomotive No. 485, unfortunately, fell into the turntable pit in [[Salida, Colorado]] in 1955. It was scrapped for parts thereafter, however, some accessories, running and valve gear was salvaged and used on other locomotives.\n\n====490 series====\n{{Main|Rio Grande class K-37}}\n[[File:engine 493.jpg|thumb|right|K-37 Steam locomotive #493 in Silverton Yard]]\nThe 490 series or K-37 class locomotives were part of a class of thirty standard gauge class 190 (later, class C-41) [[2-8-0]] engines built in 1902 for the [[Denver and Rio Grande Railroad|D&RG]] by [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]]. In 1928 and 1930 ten of the C-41s were rebuilt at the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|Rio Grande]]'s Burnham Shops in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] into {{Track gauge|3ft|lk=on}} [[Narrow-gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] {{whyte|2-8-2}}s. The D&SNG operated only one K-37. #497 was rebuilt in 1984 and operated for seven years. It is the only K-37 to go to Silverton under its own power. It was later determined that the [[Trailing wheel|trailing truck]] was having trouble negotiating the curves in the Animas Canyon. The D&SNG traded 497 to the C&TS for [[Rio Grande class K-36|K-36 class #482]]. This trade was mutually beneficial for both railroads as it gave the C&TS a fully operational locomotive, giving in exchange a locomotive that had never run, and likely would never operate under C&TS ownership. Numbers 493 and 498 are owned by the D&SNG, but are not operational. On May 4, 2016 K-37 #493 was hauled to Durango from Silverton by K-36 #481 to be transported to the Colorado Railroad Museum in Golden, Colorado, on a 10-year lease, where they would restore it to operational condition and run it for those 10 years and then return it to the D&SNGRR. However, plans were cancelled and #493 sat outside the Durango roundhouse with an uncertain future for sometime, until 2018 when she was put in the roundhouse for restoration. It is estimated it could take up to two years to finish the restoration. 493 is being restored to use oil vs. coal. This will allow it to operate when the coal fired engines cannot, since oil fired engines do not emit cinders. 493 ran under its own power for the first time on January 24, 2020. K-37 #498 rests in the Durango yard near the turntable without a tender and with no plans to restore it, given its deteriorated condition. #499 was included in the 1981 purchase from the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|D&RGW]] as well, and was stored in [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]] until 1999 when it was cosmetically restored and traded for [[Rio Grande class K-36|K-36 class #486]], which had been on display and out of operation at Royal Gorge since the early 1960s.\n[[File:K-37 -493 in Durango, Colorado.jpg|thumb|#493 in Durango after the May 4th, 2016 move from Silverton to Durango]]\n\n===Diesel engines===\nDiesels were first introduced to the Durango Yard in the 1960s with Diesel locomotive #50. Number 50 is now at the [[Colorado Railroad Museum]] in [[Golden, Colorado]]. The United States Transportation Corps. also had a six-axle narrow-gauge Diesel locomotive (#3000) for trial use in [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]] in the 1950s which saw limited use.\n\nThe D&SNG currently operates four Diesel engines. [[Narrow-gauge]] Diesel engines are just as rare as any other [[Narrow-gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] equipment. All of the Diesel engines of the D&SNG are of center cab style, where the cab straddles the center of the locomotive. Below are the Diesel engines currently used by the D&SNG:\n\n# Hotshot #1 is a 50-ton center cab engine built in 1957, was acquired from Arkansas Limestone Railroad. During the 2002 Missionary Ridge Fire, the D&SNG voluntarily shut down steam service. To help continue service, Hotshot pulled coaches out along the highline from Rockwood. Currently in service.\n# Big Al #7 is an 87-ton center cab engine built in 1975 and was originally Algoma Steel #7, from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. Big Al is named after the owner of the D&S, Allen C. Harper.\n# Diesel engine #9 was acquired in March 2006 and is a 92-ton center cab Diesel. Currently in service.\n# Diesel engine #11 was built by [[U.S. Steel]] with [[General Electric]] parts. It was acquired in March 2006 and is a 98-ton center cab Diesel. Currently in service.\n*RB-1 ([[railbus]]) was built in the winter of 1987\u20131988. It was originally numbered 1001 and was named Tamarron. It could seat 32 people, had its own baggage compartment and restroom, and had a {{convert|300|hp|kW|adj=on}} six-cylinder Caterpillar Diesel engine. This unit was intended for use on the Animas River Railway, and when that operation was shut down, it was found being used as a switcher in the Durango yard. Years later, it was put into revenue service during the 2002 Missionary Ridge Fire, but it is currently not being operated.\n* In April 2020 it was announced that four locomotives have been purchased from the White Pass railway<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://trn.trains.com/news/news-wire/2020/04/14-durango--silverton-buys-white-pass--yukon-diesels|title=Durango & Silverton buys White Pass & Yukon diesels {{!}} Trains Magazine|last=April 13|last2=2020|website=TrainsMag.com|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> in Alaska.  These will be delivered during 2020.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"175px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Durango K-36-Steam-locomotive-486 Diesel-engine-Big-Al-7 2012-10-25.JPG|K-36 steam locomotive #486 and Diesel engine \"Big Al\" #7 in Durango on October 25, 2012\nFile:Silverton Diesel-engine-11 2012-10-25.JPG|Diesel engine #11 in Silverton on October 25, 2012\n</gallery>\n\n==Operating practice and route description==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\n{{Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad}}\nThe railroad runs {{convert|45|mi|km}} from the Durango yard to Silverton, crossing the Animas River five times throughout the trip. Once trains reach Silverton and unload passengers, the train is turned on the [[wye (rail)|wye]], backs uptown to pick up returning passengers, and makes the trip back to Durango. One way scheduled trains take 3\u00bd hours to run the {{convert|45|mi|km}} each way, with a 2\u00bc hour layover in Silverton.\n\nA train departing [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]] generally takes about one hour between the crew arriving and the train departing. Brakemen inspect the train for cleanliness and required tools for the day, including a flagging kit and marker lamps for the rear of the train. The conductor will sign in his crew and obtain passenger lists and track reports to deliver to his crew. The engineer and fireman will inspect the locomotive and prepare it for the day's trip, making sure all machinery is lubricated and in proper condition, and no last-minute repairs are needed. The fireman will ensure proper coal and water is in the tender, and make sure lubricating oil is on supply and that automatic lubrication is working properly; he will also clean the cab and hose off the engine and tender of ash and dust.\n\nOnce the engine is ready, the locomotive will be pulled onto the mainline, and backed up, working the engine against the brakes to check braking capability, and also to clean the smokebox and cylinders of condensation, and work the cylinders to warm them up for lubrication. The head brakeman will hook the locomotive up to the train, and the car shop will then assist the crew by performing brake tests with the engineer.\n\nScheduled trains on the Durango & Silverton operate on authority by timetable, though on occasion may be annulled for special trains or other circumstances. A train leaving Durango will depart at {{convert|5|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} until the train is off the platform, then advance to {{convert|10|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} until leaving yard limits, where track speed is {{convert|15|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The 15th Street bridge is just east of the Durango yard limits, and maintenance-of-way crews also have a storage area here, where track patrolmen will inspect the train rolling by. The grade is fairly flat until 32nd Street, where a small hill will have the engine work a little until 36th Street. The train will then roll downgrade about {{convert|1/4|mi|km}} and use that to accelerate to {{convert|20|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, which is the track speed between 36th St. and Hermosa. Home Ranch is the first siding past Durango. A new wye has recently been built just east of here to turn trains for the Polar Express and other event trains. As the train runs through the valley, it is traveling on the longest tangent on the railroad, since most of the railroad meanders through the canyon following the river. Motorists can drive alongside the train through here and watch the engine work harder and harder as it starts to climb towards Hermosa. Passing Trimble Lane, the engine will start to pick up some work as the grade stiffens. A scheduled train takes 40 minutes to reach Hermosa from Durango.\n\nHermosa has a small maintenance-of-way yard and siding, as well as the first water tank to fill the engine's tender. Doubleheaded trains will often be put together here, with the helper running light to Hermosa ahead of the train, take on water, and then await the arrival of the train with the road engine spotting itself at the tank and taking on water. After a brake test, the train will then take on the 30 minute, 2.5% climb between Hermosa and Rockwood. As the train climbs away from the valley, passengers will notice the locomotives working hard to pull the train through the many curves that now define the railroad. An hour after leaving Durango the train passes under US Highway 550 and slows to {{convert|10|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} to traverse the \"mini-highline\", a rock shelf where the track follows the edge of a small cliff, and then picks up speed again through the meadow at Shalona. This is the last grade crossing the railroad encounters until Silverton. Slowing again after the crossing, the train winds around another rock face above Shalona Lake, with Rockwood being just around the next curve. Rockwood has a short wye and siding, and is also the first flagstop on the line. Being an hour and ten minutes by rail from Durango, some passengers lodging nearby opt to board the train here instead of driving all the way to town. The grade tops off for a while and the helper engine on doubleheaded trains will be cut off here and run ahead light to Tank Creek. As the train enters the narrow rock cut, it becomes the only ground transportation into the Animas Canyon. Passengers immediately notice the slow pace of the train as it winds onto the \"highline\", a famous section of the railroad where the train crawls along the face of high cliffs. The engine crew will usually blow down the engine on the bridge at [[Milestone|MP]] 471.2 to clean sediment from the boiler and the fireman will look back on his side of the train for a highball from the rear brakeman, indicating the rear of the train has cleared the bridge and the engineer can pick up speed to {{convert|15|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, the track speed the rest of the way to Silverton. The roadbed closely follows the Animas River from now on, and the grade fluctuates quite a bit between here and Cascade Canyon. Tacoma is the next flagstop and the railroad has another siding here. At MP 474.5 is the Tank Creek water tank, and engines will stop here for water. The fireman will top off the tender, taking about {{convert|4000|usgal|impgal l|0}}, while the engineer oils around the engine and inspects machinery and bearings. On doubleheaded trains, the helper locomotive will then rejoin the train and perform another brake test.\n\nFrom Tank Creek, trains only travel about {{convert|1|mi|km}} before reaching Tall Timber Resort. Another mile and the train is traveling on a very narrow rock wall before rounding the curve and climbing into Cascade. Cascade is two hours and {{convert|26|mi|km}} by rail from Durango, and in the winter trains are turned here on the wye due to avalanche chutes further up the railroad. After crossing the Animas a third time, the railroad curves to the east and heads towards Needleton. The grade through here tends to stairstep between short steep 3% grades and longer gradual 2-2.5% while winding through many reverse curves. Unlike the mainline that was constructed by the D&RG before arriving in Durango, the Silverton branch was laid without compensated curves, and the trains can really drag into some of the reverse curves against the engine. A {{convert|10|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} speed restriction covers a sharp curve above a rock face at MP 481.5.\n\nNeedleton flag stop is roughly {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} from the Needleton siding, and another {{convert|1/4|mi|km}} beyond that to the Needleton water tank. Trains stopping at Needleton flag stop are for backpackers usually hiking up to the Chicago Basin, as well as occasional homesteaders who have cabins in the forest. Locomotives have a hard time starting the trains from a stop here as well as leaving from the tank stop, indicated by the layer of sand on the tracks and the frequency of the valves centering up, forcing the engineer to back the locomotive up a foot or so before trying to start forward again. On the westbound trains, the tender only needs about {{convert|1000|usgal|impgal l|0}} to be topped off before proceeding to Silverton, however, the steepest grade lies ahead. The track out of Needleton is around 2.5%, with a little ease around MP 486, but then quickly steepens again, topping off 4% at MP 488. From MP 488 to Elk Park the fireman finally gets a break on the wider, sweeping curves and flatter grade.\n\nElk Park is the last siding, wye, and flagstop before Silverton. Not as popular as Needleton for hikers, Elk Park is where the railroad crosses the Colorado Trail and it often serves as a hunting camp in season. Also past Elk Park, the railroad is among some of the highest concentration of avalanche chutes in the state. The Snowshed Slide once had a snowshed, until burning and leaving behind remnants of what once gave the slide its name. The grade has one decent pull approaching Snowshed, but afterwards is pretty easy the rest of the way to Silverton, and also has longer, sweeping, slightly elevated curves which allow for smooth running. The engineer will blow a warning whistle approaching the sharp curve at Cataract, the narrowest section of the entire canyon, before opening up to the valley that holds Silverton.\n\nThe railroad crosses the Animas one last time before entering yard limits. The train slows to {{convert|10|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and blows a long station call on the whistle before passing the depot. After the train arrives, passengers deboard the train and the crew backs the train down to the wye for servicing. An ashpit was recently constructed for use and to aid in heavier repairs if needed, which do happen on occasion. After shoving the train uptown for boarding passengers, the engineer will oil and inspect the engine once again and the crew will perform another brake test for the return trip to Durango.\n\nTrains will almost always use straight air unless conditions or equipment don't allow. The engineer won't need to use steam for power to move the train until just east of Tacoma, and after climbing to Rockwood, can drift again all the way to Trimble Lane in the valley near Durango. Trains coming from Silverton will top off with water again at Needleton on the return, and Cascade trains won't need water for the return.\n\nAfter arrival in Durango, steam locomotives are cut from the trains for immediate servicing, which can make the shop crew pretty busy in the summer with four or five locomotives being tended. Servicing includes coaling up the tender, adding wood pellets for fuel for overnight stoking, refilling the sand supply, cleaning or dropping the fire depending on the schedule for the locomotive, and then spotting the engine in the roundhouse to apply grease, shoot bearings, refill oilers, and replenish water. Running {{convert|90|mi|km|adj=on}} trips each day in the summer with the heavy trains will also cause damage to the running gear and require heavier repairs at times, which the roundhouse crew is capable of performing.\n\nThe railroad uses a couple of small Diesel switching locomotives for work trains and everyday yard switching to allow the steam locomotives to enter the shop areas sooner. The use of wood pellets for overnight fuel, as well as Diesel switchers are a result of constant complaints from local citizens regarding the [[fly ash]] from the coal-fired engines. Though the railroad has been present in the town since its founding, the D&SNG has tried its best to appease the locals.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"175px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Durango K-36-Steam-locomotive-486 2012-10-25.JPG|K-36 Steam locomotive #486 getting ready for departure from Durango on October 25, 2012\nFile:Durango-Silverton Colors 2012-10-25.JPG|Beautiful colors on the way to Silverton on October 25, 2012\nFile:Durango-Silverton Highline 2012-10-25.JPG|On the Highline above the Animas Canyon on October 25, 2012\nFile:Durango-Silverton Animas-River 2012-10-25.JPG|Along the Animas River to Silverton on October 25, 2012\nFile:Durango-Silverton Approaching-Silverton 2012-10-25.JPG|Approaching Silverton on October 25, 2012\n</gallery>\n\n==D&SNG rolling stock==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\nThe Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad operates over 50 pieces of rolling stock. Some of the cars are the oldest passenger cars in existence.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===Concession cars===\n[[File:Silverton Concession-car-126 2012-10-25.JPG|thumb|right|Concession car #126 in Silverton, October 2012]]\nLike most of the coaches on the D&SNG, the concession cars are good examples of how coaches were renumbered and rebuilt several times by the D&RGW.\n*Concession car 64 was originally mail-baggage 64 built in 1889. In 1983 it was purchased from the Black Hills Central Railroad. 64 returned to service in 1984 as a concession car.\n*Concession car 126 was originally baggage car 27. It was renumbered 126 in 1886. It was converted to a coach-snack bar by the D&RGW in 1963 then reconverted in 1979 to a coach. It was reconverted to a full concession car by the D&SNG in 1982.\n*Concession car 212 was originally coach 20 built in 1879. In 1887 it was rebuilt into a combination coach-baggage car and numbered 215. In 1942, 215 had been sold to a Mexican railway. Then the D&RGW realized that it was larger than another combination car 212. The numbers of the car were switched and the smaller car was sent to [[Mexico]]. In 1964 converted to a coach-snack bar by the D&RGW, then to a 48-passenger coach in 1979. In 1982 it was converted to a snack bar car by the D&SNG. Then, in 1986, it was converted to a full concession car.\n*Concession car 566 was originally mail car 14 built in 1882. Around 1888 it was rebuilt into excursion car 566. In July 1904 it was renumbered 0566. Then it was switched to work service in 1914. It was rebuilt to its original appearance as a postal car by the D&SNG. It was then given its old excursion car number of 566 and is now used as a concession car.\n\n===Coaches===\n[[File:Silverton Bitter-Root-Mine-213 2012-10-25.JPG|thumb|right|Bitter Root Mine 213 in Silverton, October 2012]]\nThe D&SNG operates one combination car 213 named Bitter Root Mine, it was previously named Home Ranch and was built in 1983 by the D&SNG. It has a hydraulic lift for passengers in wheelchairs.\n\nThe D&SNG operates several other coaches:\n\n#257 Shenandoah, built in 1880\n#270 Pinkerton, built in 1880\n#291 King Mine, built in 1881\n#311 McPhee, built in 1881\n#319 Needleton, built in 1882\n#323 Animas City, built in 1887\n#327 Durango, built in 1887\n#330 Cascade, built in 1963\n#331 Trimble, built in 1963\n#332 La Plata, built in 1964\n#333 Tacoma, built in 1964\n#334 Hermosa, built in 1964\n#335 Elk Park, built in 1964\n#336 Rockwood, built in 1964\n#337 Fort Lewis, built in 1964\n#503 Crazy Woman Creek,  Acquired in 2019. 503 was originally a flat car built in the 1940s, then converted for use as a coach in 1982 by the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"175px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Silverton Animas-City-323 2012-10-25.JPG|Animas City 323 in Silverton, October 2012\nFile:Silverton Durango-327 2012-10-25.JPG|Durango 327 in Silverton, October 2012\nFile:Silverton Cascade-330 2012-10-25.JPG|Cascade 330 in Silverton, October 2012\nFile:Silverton La-Plata-332 2012-10-25.JPG|La Plata 332 in Silverton, October 2012\n</gallery>\n\n====Cinco Animas B-2====\n[[File:Silverton Cinco-Animas-B-2 2012-10-25.JPG|thumb|right|Cinco Animas B-2 in Silverton, October 2012]]\nBuilt in 1883, the Cinco Animas was originally an immigrant sleeper. Immigrant sleepers had very few amenities and had little consideration for passenger comfort. The original Cinco Animas could seat up to thirty passengers. It was turned into a business car in 1913. In 1963 it was purchased by the Cinco Animas Corporation, where it received its present name. Then, in 1982, the Cinco Animas was sold to the D&S. It runs daily throughout the summer.\n\n====Nomad B-3====\nBuilt in 1878, the Nomad was originally named Fairplay. In 1886, it was rebuilt as Business Car N. It is reportedly the favorite car of D&RG president William Jackson Palmer. The Fairplay has hosted Presidents William H Taft, Ulysses S Grant and Theodore Roosevelt. While being owned by several parties between 1951\u20131982 the Fairplay was renamed the Nomad. It was acquired by the D&S in 1982. Today it is the oldest private railroad coach still in service in the United States. It runs daily throughout the summer.\n\n====General Palmer B-7====\nThe General Palmer was built in 1880 as a business car for the D&RG. In later years it fell into disrepair. It was restored in 2001 at a cost of $250,000 by the D&S. Its modern amenities include internet service and a twenty-inch flat paneled television. The General Palmer is exclusively used by owner [[Allen Harper]], his family and guests.\n\n====San Juan 312====\nBuilt by the D&RG in 1887, it had clerestory roof and bullnose ends. It was finished in ash and seated forty-six. It was rebuilt in 1937 at the Alamosa shops. Vestuable ends, train-line steam heat, electric lights, and deluxe [[Heywood-Wakefield Company|Heywood-Wakefield]] reclining coach seats for 24 passenger were installed. The D&S named coach 312 the Silverton. In the winter of 2007\u20132008 it was rebuilt with overstuffed seating for in a wide three across arrangement and had its name changed to San Juan. It runs during the summer time.\n\n====Alamosa 350====\n[[File:Silverton Alamosa-350 2012-10-25.JPG|thumb|right|Alamosa 350 in Silverton, October 2012]]\nBuilt in 1880, it was originally named the Hildago as Horton chair car number 25. It was changed to car 403 in 1885. It was then rebuilt into an office living car for members of the Valuation Survey in 1919. Valuation Survey was inventorying the entire railroad property after it was returned to the D&RGW after World War 1. In 1924 it was converted into a parlor-smoker car. After a rebuild in 1937 it became a parlor-buffet car named Alamosa. The car had a closed vestibule, with steam heat, electric lights and seats for fourteen passengers. In 1957 it was converted for coach service. It was renumbered 350 in 1959. In 1981 it was purchased by the D&S and converted to a parlor car and seats twenty-five people. There was another car with the same name that was destroyed in a derailment on the [[Rio Grande Southern Railroad]]. It runs daily throughout the summer.\n\n====Prospector 630====\nWas built in 1984 as a coach and was named Hunt. In 2009 it became a family upscale coach. The Prospector features comfortable table and chair style seating. The ceiling of the Prospector features an enlarged route map, making it easy for passengers to follow the train's progress along the route.\n\n====Tall Timber Legend 631 & Tall Timber Legacy 632====\n631 was built in 1985 and named the North Star. 632 was built in 1986 and named Teft. Both cars were built as general passenger cars to help with the increase in passengers. In 2009 the cars were converted with overstuffed seats. They are used mainly to take passengers to Tall Timber to go zip lining.\n\n===Open observation gondolas===\n[[File:Silverton Open-observation-car-415 2012-10-25.JPG|thumb|right|Open observation car #415 in Silverton, October 2012]]\nOpen observation [[Gondola (rail)|gondolas]] 400\u2013402 were built in 1963, equipped with passenger car [[Bogie|trucks]], [[steel]] [[roof]]s, [[tile]] [[floor]]s and [[tram]]way seats. Gondolas 403\u2013405 were built for the 1967 season on The Silverton. Between 1982 and 1985 the D&SNG built Open Observation cars 411 and 412. Open Observation cars 406\u2013409 and 413\u2013416 were built between 1982 and 1986\n* Cars 400\u2013405 and 411\u2013412 are former standard gauge [[boxcar]]s, built in 1916\n* Cars 406\u2013409 and 413\u2013416 are former standard gauge [[stock car (rail)|stock cars]], built in 1937\n\n====Silver Vista 313====\nThe original Silver Vista was built in 1947 by the D&RGW. It was a popular glass-topped observation car and the only one of its kind. The original Silver Vista was destroyed by a fire in Alamosa in 1953. Because of its popularity, there has been speculation that the D&RGW destroyed it on purpose to drive revenue down so they could abandon the line from Silverton to Antonito. The recreation of the Silver Vista was built in 2006. It runs daily throughout the summer.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"175px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Silver Vista observation car Denver and Rio Grande.JPG|The original D&RG Silver Vista car\nFile:Silver Vista observation car Denver and Rio grande 1951.JPG|Side view of the car in 1951\nFile:Silver Vista on the Silverton 1951.JPG|The observation car on the Silverton route in 1951\n</gallery>\n\n====Rio Grande 410====\nBuilt in the winter of 1987\u20131988, the Rio Grande was originally railbus trailer 1002 and was painted red. It was used with the Animas Canyon Railway Diesel-powered rail-bus. It was stored from 1992 to 1997, until it was rebuilt as an open observation car 313. It was given number 313, because it resembled the Silver Vista. After the Silver Vista was built in 2006, it became open observation car 410. In the winter of 2006\u20132007 it was again rebuilt into an open air observation car with comfortable and large overstuffed seats for a more expansive view. It runs daily during the summer.\n\n===Cabooses===\n[[File:Silverton Caboose-0540 2012-10-25.JPG|thumb|right|Caboose #0540 in Silverton Yard]]\nCaboose #0505 was built in 1886 and is stocked with provisions to provide shelter and food.\n\nCaboose #0540 was built in 1881 and is a mini-warehouse, carrying the most common tools and supplies. It is used by Maintenance of Way.\n\n====Caboose 0500====\nIs {{convert|17|ft|m}} long, and was built in 1886. It was originally known as D&RG #1. In 1950 it was sold to [[Robert W. Richardson|Bob Richardson]], then again in 1987 to a business in Cripple Creek. In 1993 it was acquired by the D&S and was restored to its original condition. It is available for charter and can hold up to eight people.\n\n===Rail camp car 3681===\nRail camp car 3681 is an ex-D&RGW boxcar. It was rebuilt by the D&S in 1984 with a kitchen, a bathroom and beds. It is pulled to Cascade Canyon Wye for elegant camping. It can hold a group of up to eight people.\n\n=== Coaches not in service ===\n*Mail baggage car 66 was built in 1887. For some years it was the base of operations for the Animas River Railway in Rockwood, Colorado. Car 66 served as the office, ticket window, and waiting room for the railway. It was then moved to Hermosa, Colorado, as the maintenance of way office.\n*Mail baggage car 119 was built in 1882 and is currently not in service.\n*Coach #460 is the only {{Track gauge|3ft|lk=on}} [[narrow-gauge]] tourist sleeper remaining from a group built in 1886 for the D&RG. In the early 1900s it was assigned to work service and was used on a D&RGW wrecking train as late as 1957. Then it was sold to the [[Black Hills Central Railroad]] in [[South Dakota]]. Then in 1983 the D&SNG purchased coach 460. It has yet to be restored.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"175px\" perrow=\"5\">\nSilverton Maintenance-of-way-train 2012-10-25.JPG|Maintenance of way train in Silverton on October 25, 2012\nSilverton Maintenance-crane 2012-10-25.JPG|Maintenance crane in Silverton on October 25, 2012\nSilverton Speeder-9002 2012-10-25.JPG|Speeder #9002 in Silverton on October 25, 2012\n</gallery>\n\n== Museums ==\nThe D&SNG operates two museums, the D&SNG Museum<ref>[http://www.durangotrain.com/ Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad and Museum] Official site and Museums.</ref> and the Silverton Freight Yard Museum. They both feature historic locomotives and railway equipment used on the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|D&RGW]] line.\n\n===D&SNG Museum===\nOpened in 1998, the D&SNG Museum is a tribute to railroading nationally and southwest Colorado. The museum is located in the Durango roundhouse. Half the roundhouse is used for the steam engines and the other half is for the museum. The museum features memorabilia from the D&RGW and other railroads. It also features many artifacts from the Durango and Silverton areas. There is an HO train layout in the museum. It depicts a narrow-gauge railroad similar to the D&RGW. There is also a movie coach that was used in the filming of [[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]], where the railroad's informational and educational films are featured.\n\n====Class 70 engine no. 42====\nOn display in the Durango and Silverton RR Museum, engine 42 was one of 6 class-70 2-8-0 locomotives built by Baldwin in 1887 for the D&RG. The engine weighs 35 tons and pulls with 17,100&nbsp;lbs of tractive effort. It was originally numbered 420. In November 1916 the engine was sold to the [[Rio Grande Southern]] and was used till the RGS was dismantled in 1952. Engine 42 and a caboose running from Grady, located east of Mancos, Colorado, to Durango was the last train movement on the RGS. In 1953 the engine was sold to the Narrow Gauge Motel in Alamosa. In 1958 the 42 was sold to Magic Mountain Amusement Park in [[Golden, Colorado]], where it was converted to burn fuel oil and operated for a short time. In 1969 it was put on display in [[Monument, Colorado]] in front of a bank. In 1971 engine 42 returned to Golden as a restaurant display at Heritage Square. Finally, in 1983 it was purchased and brought to Durango. It has never been restored to operating condition. It is on display in the museum.\n\n====Baggage car no. 127====\nOriginally flat car 6630, it was rebuilt in 1968 as a baggage car for the film [[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} No. 127 was the third concession car built by the D&SNG. It saw limited service and acted as a backup concession car.

The new company Animas River Railway was incorporated by the D&SNG, in order to preserve the integrity of its own claim of \"100% coal-fired steam locomotives\". The railbus hauled hikers and fishermen into the canyon from Rockwood. Operations for the Animas River Railway were run out of Rockwood. Former mail baggage car 66 was used as the ticket window, office and waiting room for the railway.\n\nBuilt in 1987\u201388 winter, motorcar 1001 was named Tamarron. It could seat 32 people and had a 300-horsepower six-cylinder caterpillar engine. It also had a baggage compartment and restroom. The trailer 1002 could seat 48 in longitudinal seats.\n\n;1988 schedule\nThe first railbus trip left at 7:30&nbsp;a.m. on May 7 for Elk Park. There were 12:30&nbsp;p.m. and 6:00&nbsp;p.m. trips to Cascade Canyon. The season for the Animas River Railway was supposed to last from May 7 through October 30, but lasted until September 4 due to mechanical problems.\n\n;1989 schedule\nThe railbus was repaired and began operations on May 6, 1989. A 12:01&nbsp;p.m. trip for Cascade Canyon ran until October 29. From May 27 through September 15 Elk Park trips ran at 7:30&nbsp;a.m. and 3:30&nbsp;p.m.\n\n;1990 schedule\nThe schedule for the Animas River Railway remained the same. The last excursion of the Animas River Railway was on September 23 from Rockwood to Cascade. Patronage never met expectations and has not operated since.\n\n;2002 schedule\nDuring the 2002 Missionary Ridge Fire, the D&SNG voluntarily shut down steam service.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} To help continue service, motorcar 1001 now RB-1 and trailer 1002 now 313 took people out to Elk Park from Silverton.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n==Visiting equipment==\nJust as narrow-gauge equipment and parts are rare, narrow-gauge railroads are rare these days too. When narrow-gauge pieces of equipment come back to life there are very few places in the United States where they can run. Many of these pieces run during the railroad's annual Railfest held every August. Below are some pieces of {{Track gauge|3ft|lk=on}} [[narrow-gauge]] equipment that visit the D&SNG railroad.\n\n===D&RGW No. 315===\n{{Main|D&RGW 315}}\nD&RGW No. 315 is a C-18 locomotive, built in 1895 by [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]]. It originally was owned by the [[Florence and Cripple Creek Railroad]] as No. 3. It was then bought by D&RG and became No. 424 and after the railroad was reorganized into D&RGW in 1924 it became No. 315. Around 1941, 315 made its way to Durango and became a yard switcher. It worked around Durango until 1949. To save it from being scrapped, it was leased by the City of Durango as a display. When the D&RGW abandoned the line to Durango, 315 was donated to the Chamber of Commerce in 1968. In 1986 it was put on display at Santa Rita Park. Ownership of 315 was changed from the Chamber of Commerce to the City of Durango. It was restored to operating condition in 2007 by the Durango Railroad Historical Society, which operates the locomotive occasionally on both the Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad and the Cumbres & Toltec Scenic Railroad.\n\n===E&P No. 4===\n{{Main|Eureka Locomotive}}\nEureka and Palisade No. 4 is a Class 8/18 C [[4-4-0]] locomotive, built in 1875 by [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]]. It originally was owned by the Eureka and Palisade Railroad, and was later sold to the Sierra Nevada Wood and Lumber Company. In 1938, it was sold to [[Warner Bros.]] and was used in many films. Eventually, the engine went to the Old Vegas amusement park in Henderson, Nevada, where it became badly damaged by a fire. Finally, it was bought by Dan Markoff and restored to operating condition. Dan privately owns the engine, and on occasion brings it to various railroads to operate, including the D&SNG.\n\n===Casey Jones===\nThe Casey Jones railbus was built in 1915 out of a [[Model T]] and is a predecessor of the [[Galloping Goose (railcar)|Galloping Goose]]. It was originally designed to be an ambulance servicing the Sunnyside Mine in [[Eureka, Colorado]]. It was often used by mine officials to commute to Silverton. It has room for 11 passengers. The Casey Jones is owned by the San Juan Historical Society.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.silvertonhistoricsociety.org | title = San Juan Historical Society}}</ref> In the summer months it is on a siding near the Silverton Depot and in the winter it is on display at the D&SNG Museum in Durango.\n\n===Galloping Goose No. 5===\nGalloping Goose No. 5 went into service on June 8, 1933 and was built by the [[Rio Grande Southern]] railroad. It was built with a 1928 Pierce-Arrow limousine body and running gear. It was rebuilt in 1946/47, using a World War II surplus GMC gasoline truck engine and a Wayne Corporation school bus body. In 1950, the freight/mail compartment was converted to carry 20 additional passengers for sightseeing trips. After RGS was scrapped in 1953, Galloping Goose No. 5 came to rest in Dolores, Colorado. Galloping Goose No. 5 was completely restored to operating condition in 1998 by the Galloping Goose Historical Society<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gallopinggoose5.com/index.html | title = Galloping Goose Historical Society}}</ref> in Dolores, Colorado. It visits the D&SNG and Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad.\n\n===Southern Pacific No. 18===\nSP No. 18 is a narrow-gauge 4-6-0 locomotive built in 1911 by [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]]. It arrived to Durango on lease from the Eastern California Museum in November 2018 and it stayed until October 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=November 5, 2018|title=SP No. 18 arrives in Durango|url=http://trn.trains.com/news/news-wire/2018/11/05-sp-18-arrives-in-durango|work=[[Trains (magazine)|Trains]]|accessdate=July 1, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622220744/http://trn.trains.com/news/news-wire/2018/11/05-sp-18-arrives-in-durango|archivedate=June 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==In popular media==\nThe train is the subject of the song ''The Silverton'', by [[C.

The railway is a federally designated [[National Historic Landmark]] and is also designated by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] as a [[List of Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks|Historic Civil Engineering Landmark]].\n\nThe route was originally opened in 1882 by the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|Denver & Rio Grande Railroad]] ([[Denver and Rio Grande Railroad|D&RG]]) to transport [[silver]] and [[gold]] ore mined from the [[San Juan Mountains]]. The line was an extension of the [[Denver and Rio Grande Railroad|D&RG]] {{Track gauge|3ft}} [[Narrow-gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] line from [[Antonito, Colorado]], to [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]]. The last train to operate into [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]] from the east was on December 6, 1968. The states of [[New Mexico]] and [[Colorado]] purchased 64 miles between Antonito and [[Chama, New Mexico]], in 1970 and operates today as the [[Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad|Cumbres & Toltec Scenic Railroad]]. Trackage between [[Chama, New Mexico|Chama]] and [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]] was removed by 1971.\n\nThe line from [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]] to [[Silverton, Colorado|Silverton]] has run continuously since 1881, although it is now a tourist and heritage line hauling passengers, and is one of the few places in the U.S. which has seen continuous use of [[steam locomotive]]s. In March 1981, the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|Denver & Rio Grande Western]] sold the line and the D&SNG was formed.<ref name=\"prn-mar91\">{{cite journal| last=Farewell| first=R.C.| date=March 1991| title=Narrow Gauge in a 'Grande Tradition: Riding the Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad| journal=[[Pacific RailNews]]| pages=36\u201341| publisher=[[Interurban Press]]}}</ref>\n\nSome rolling stock dates back to the 1880s. Trains operate from [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]] to the Cascade Wye in the winter months and Durango\u2013Silverton during the summer months.

Prior to the war, he had risen within the ranks of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] serving as secretary to the president. After arriving in Denver, he formulated a plan to build a {{Track gauge|3ft}} narrow-gauge railroad southward from Denver to El Paso, Texas<ref>Athearn, Robert G. \"Rebel of the Rockies\" Yale University Press 1962 pp. 10,15.</ref> (see [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad]]). In 1871, the Denver & Rio Grande Railway began to lay rails south from Denver. Palmer and his associates had agreed that the choice of {{Track gauge|3ft}} narrow gauge would be well suited to the mountainous country, and relatively less expensive construction costs would enhance the viability of the new railroad. The original north-south plans of the D&RG eventually expanded to include extensions throughout the booming mining country of central and southwestern Colorado.\n\nOn August 5, 1881 the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|Denver & Rio Grande Railway]] arrived in [[Durango, Colorado]]. The new town was founded by the D&RG in 1880, chiefly through the talents and organization of General Palmer's business partner, [[William Abraham Bell|Dr. William Bell]]. Construction to [[Silverton, Colorado]] began that fall. Only 11 months later, the D&RG reached Silverton on July 10, 1882. Trains hauling passengers and freight began immediately. The Denver & Rio Grande Railway soon re-emerged as the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad (1886) and ultimately began operating as the Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad (D&RGW) on July 31, 1921 after re-organization of the Colorado lines and Rio Grande Western of Utah.<ref>Athearn, Robert G. \"Rebel of the Rockies\" Yale University Press 1962. pp. 241\u2013243</ref> Eventually, the railroad became widely known as the \"Rio Grande\".\n\nThe Silverton branch, as it became known, struggled under D&RG ownership following the [[Panic of 1893]] and the end of free coinage of silver. Typical of many portions of the surviving narrow-gauge branches into the middle of the twentieth century, the line faced sagging revenue due to ever-declining mining ventures, highway trucking competition, and insignificant passenger revenue. Annual snowslides and several major floods on the branch would only continue to challenge the railroad's ability to survive.\n\n=== The Silverton ===\nAfter World War II, domestic tourism began to grow across the country, and the Silverton branch of the railroad would benefit. Bolstered by national exposure via [[Hollywood]] movies being filmed along the line in the late 1940s, the railroad created ''The Silverton'', a summer-only train service on June 24, 1947.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417000300/http://www.drgw.org:80/data/passenger/Passenger.htm|title=Passenger|date=2015-04-17|access-date=2018-05-06}}</ref> A short time later, the railroad adorned a locomotive and four coaches with a colorful yellow paint scheme and launched modest public promotion. With this effort, \"The Painted Train\" officially started a new era of tourism that continues to this day. Freight traffic, however, continued to decline and during the 1950s, ''The Silverton'' operated as a [[mixed train]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.drgw.net/gallery/v/PassengerTTs/PTTSystem1Jun1952/|title=D&RGW System Passenger Timetable - 1-Jun-1952|website=www.drgw.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-06}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1960s, a modernized D&RGW did not see the Silverton Branch as worthy to maintain and a petition was filed with governmental agencies to abandon the route. The [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] declined to grant the request due to the continued increase in tourist patronage. Following the ICC's ruling, the railroad reluctantly responded by investing in additional rolling stock, track maintenance, and improvements to the Durango depot. The railroad purchased some of the property around the depot, cleaned up the block extending north to Sixth Street, and facilitated the opening of gift shops and other tourist-friendly businesses. As ridership continued to grow, the D&RGW operated a second train to Silverton on certain days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rgmhs.org/data/advertising/Advertising.htm|title=Rio Grande Advertising|website=rgmhs.org|access-date=2018-05-06}}</ref>\n\n=== The 1970s ===\nSince 1971, the Silverton branch and nearby [[Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad]] were the only remnants of the Rio Grande's once extensive narrow-gauge system.<ref name=\"prn-mar91\" /> During the late 1970s, the D&RGW was actively trying to sell the Silverton branch, and in 1979, Charles Bradshaw, a Florida citrus grower, offered the railroad a legitimate opportunity to divest itself of the now isolated route.

His plans were fulfilled with the March 25, 1981, acquisition of the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|D&RGW]]'s {{convert|45|mi|km|adj=on}} Silverton branch and all of its structures and rolling stock.<ref name=\"prn-mar91\" />\n\nThe improvements to the railroad in the 1980s would prove to be the most dramatic growth on the Silverton Branch since the earlier part of the century. Bolstered by the assistance of former Rio Grande operating managers and a relatively sizeable staff of new employees, Bradshaw's plans were set in motion immediately. Included in the sale were former D&RGW locomotives and rolling stock that had not seen service in Durango for many years. \"K-36\" and \"K-37\" class locomotives were eventually restored to operating condition and these larger class of engines operated to Silverton for the first time ever following bridge and right-of-way improvements to the line. 1880s vintage coaches were exquisitely restored and new coaches were added to the roster of rolling stock. For the first time in many years, doubleheaded trains (trains with two locomotives) and additional scheduled trains were employed to handle the continually growing passenger trade. The Durango yard facilities also saw dramatic improvements. An extension was added to the old roundhouse, a new car shop was built on the site of the original \"car barn\", and the depot saw extensive repair and internal modifications. The workforce grew with the railroad, and Durango's tourist image expanded as new businesses and revamping of the old railroad town continued to take shape. The original 1881 Durango [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] was completely destroyed by fire in the winter of 1989. All six operable locomotives had been inside at the time and were damaged, but not beyond repair. All locomotives were eventually restored to operating condition. A new roundhouse was constructed on the same site, opening in early 1990, and its facade made use of bricks salvaged from the original building.<ref name=\"prn-mar91\" />\n\nIn March 1997 Bradshaw sold the D&SNG to First American Railways, Inc., located in Hollywood, Florida. Then in July 1998 the railroad was sold again to American Heritage Railways. At the time, American Heritage Railways was headquartered in Coral Gables, Florida. Since then their headquarters have been moved to [[Durango, Colorado]]. The D&SNGRR has two museums, one each in [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]] and [[Silverton, Colorado|Silverton]].\n\n===Management===\n*[[Allen C.

There are three classes, [[Rio Grande class K-28|K-28]], [[Rio Grande class K-36|K-36]], and [[Rio Grande class K-37|K-37]], which are all based on wheel arrangement and pulling power of the locomotive.\n\nThe ''K'' represents the nickname [[2-8-2|\"Mikado\"]] that describes a locomotive with two non-powered, pivoting wheels in front of eight driving wheels, which are connected to driving rods powered by the engine's pistons, and finally two non-powered trailer wheels located under the cab. The name comes from the fact that the first significant use of the type was a series built by [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] for the Japanese Railways in 1887.\n\nThe numbers 28 and 36 designate the [[Tractive force|tractive effort]] (pulling force) of the locomotives in thousands of pounds. The tractive effort of K-28s is rated at {{convert|27500|lbf|kN|3|lk=on}}, and the tractive effort of a K-36 is a {{convert|36200|lbf|kN|3}}. The weight of a K-28 with a full tender is {{convert|254500|lb|kg|0}}, and a K-36 weighs {{convert|286600|lb|kg|0}} with a full tender.\n\n====470 series====\n{{Main|Rio Grande class K-28}}\n[[File:Durango & Silverton Rly 2-8-2 473 06.90R.jpg|thumb|right|D & S 2-8-2 K-28 locomotive No. 473 on arrival at Silverton with a train from Durango in June 1990]]\n[[File:Durango & Silverton Engine 476.jpg|thumb|Engine 476 in operation, 2000]]\nThe 470 series or {{whyte|2-8-2}} K-28 class locomotives were ten engines designed for freight service along the [[Denver and Rio Grande Railroad|D&RG]].<ref name=\"roster\" /> They were built by the [[Schenectady Locomotive Works]]<ref name=SLW /> of the [[American Locomotive Company]] ([[American Locomotive Company|ALCO]]) in [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1923. The K-28s have {{convert|28000|lbf|kN|3|abbr=on}}. of tractive effort, superheated, and the boilers are fed by two non-lifting injectors. Air brakes are 6-ET automatic and also feature a straight air secondary braking system for daily passenger trains. Due to their smaller size these engines are often used on the Durango & Silverton for shorter trains, usually the first or last on the schedule, and often for helper service or sectioned trains. Despite being smaller than the K-36 class locomotives, older, and less powerful, the engine crews tend to favor a trip on these engines because the design ALCO used was superior in balance and servicing. Firing can be tricky when the engine is working hard, as the clam&nbsp;shell-style [[Glossary of boiler terms#Firedoor|firedoors]] tend to pull into the backhead of the boiler due to the draft, and if any flues in the boiler are leaking, the loss of draft on the fire is much harder to work around than on the K-36 locomotives. Firing while the engine is working hard is done with a large \"heel\" pattern, generally with as little coal on the flue sheet as possible, and gradually sloping the fire bed towards the door sheet to the height or higher than the firedoors. This results in the draft being forced through the fire bed in the thinner areas towards the flue sheet, which usually is hindered by the lack of draft between the grates and the arch brick. New firemen sometimes have a hard time learning this, because the art of \"reading\" a fire takes time to learn, and the amount of time working on the K-28 class locomotives is far reduced compared to the railroads usual K-36 workhorses, which have a larger firebox and are more forgiving in technique.\n[[File:Denver and Rio Grande excursion at Hermosa 1963.JPG|thumb|Locomotives 473 and 478 at Hermosa on a D&RGW excursion in 1963.]]\nOut of the original ten only three 470s remain, and all are owned by the D&SNG. The other seven were requisitioned by the [[United States Army]] in 1942 to be used on the [[White Pass & Yukon Route]] in [[Alaska]] during [[World War II]]. They were later dismantled for scrap in 1946.\n\nLocomotives 473, 476, and 478 operated on many parts of the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|D&RGW]]. Engine 473 served frequently on the ''[[Chili Line]]'' that operated between Antonito, Colorado and Santa Fe, New Mexico. 473 served on the ''Chili Line'' until it was abandoned in 1941. 476 and 478 saw an extensive service on the ''[[San Juan Express|San Juan]]'' passenger train, which ran between Durango, Colorado and Alamosa, Colorado until 1951. 473, 476, and 478 operated on the Silverton Branch from the 1950s through 1980 and are still in service today.\n\nIn July 2015, the D&SNG and C&TS had announced that a proposed trade that proposed that the 478 should go to [[Chama, New Mexico|Chama]], and in exchange the D&SNG would get [[Rio Grande class K-36|K-36 class No. 483]], which had not seen operation in several years. For many months this was a highly debated subject between rail enthusiasts. People in favor of the swap stated that the 478 would help own a historic fleet in Chama, working alongside a K-27, K-36s and K-37s, as well as the fact that the 483 would see service again. Those that were against the trade argued that the 478 would just sit in Chama and rust away and argued that 483 could still be restored. In the end, it was decided between the commission in Chama to not go through with the swap. To this day, the swap proposal is still debated amongst railfans.\n\nSince the swap failed to go through, the D&SNG announced in June 2016 that they were going to restore 476 and place 478 in the museum.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n#473 is undergoing a firebox rebuild and conversion to [[Fuel oil|oil]] as of February 2020.\n#476 is operational.\n#478 is on display in the D&SNG Museum awaiting a rebuild in the distant future.<ref name=SLW />[[File:K-28 -473 at Cascade Canyon Wye.jpg|thumb|K-28 #473 awaits departure from Cascade Canyon in May 2016.]]\n\n====480 series====\n{{Main|Rio Grande class K-36}}\n[[File:D&SNG 482&480 2006.jpg|thumb|right|K-36 steam locomotives #482 & #480 in Silverton]]\n[[File:Colorado - Silverton 02.jpg|thumb|right|K-36 steam locomotive #481 getting ready for departure from Silverton]]\n[[File:Silverton K-36-Steam-locomotive-486 2012-10-25.JPG|thumb|right|K-36 steam locomotive #486 getting ready for departure from Silverton on October 25, 2012]]\nThe 480 series or K-36 class locomotives were ten engines designed for the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|D&RGW]]. They were built by the [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] in 1925. The 480s were the last ten [[Narrow-gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] locomotives constructed for the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|D&RGW]]. The 480s were used for freight-hauling throughout the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|D&RGW]] {{Track gauge|3ft}} [[Narrow-gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] network. The \"36\" stands for {{convert|36200|lbf|kN|3|abbr=on}}. of [[Tractive force|tractive effort]]. These engines are outside frame Mikados, and all drive wheels have counterbalancing outside of the frame, resulting in the utilitarian look the engines are known for. The engines currently use 6-ET automatic air and the secondary straight air used on regular service equipment. The railroad runs 12-car passenger trains behind these engines; however more cars require the train to be doubleheaded. Despite popular belief that the railroad does not doublehead trains out of Durango because of smoke, the real reason is the weight restriction on the bridge at 15th Street, not allowing more than one K-36 at a time (K-28 class engines however are still doubleheaded from Durango). The engines were delivered with Master Mechanics design smokeboxes for draft, however at some point the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|D&RGW]] converted them to Andersson (cyclone) front ends. Water is fed to the boiler by two non-lifting injectors. The {{convert|40|sqft|m2|adj=on}} grate surface in the firebox is among the largest built for a [[Narrow-gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] locomotive, and is fed by hand firing. Firing is simpler on these engines compared to the [[Rio Grande class K-28|K-28]]s, however the larger surface area requires more fuel. A typical trip uses around {{convert|3|-|5|ST|LT t|2|lk=on}} on the way up to [[Silverton, Colorado|Silverton]], and another {{convert|1|-|2|ST|LT t|2}} on the return to [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]]. Ergonomically, the engines are less comfortable than the others as well, with the crew seats being further back from the backhead, and the engineer having to lean forward constantly to adjust the throttle and use the sanders. The running gear on the locomotives also tend to wear out faster than the [[American Locomotive Company|ALCO]] designed [[Rio Grande class K-28|K-28]]s, and the resulting pounding rough ride can take a toll on the engine crew.\n\nD&SNG owns four K-36s: Nos. 480, 481, 482, and 486, all of which are operational. The [[Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad]] owns engines 483, 484, 487, 488, and 489. Locomotive No. 485, unfortunately, fell into the turntable pit in [[Salida, Colorado]] in 1955. It was scrapped for parts thereafter, however, some accessories, running and valve gear was salvaged and used on other locomotives.\n\n====490 series====\n{{Main|Rio Grande class K-37}}\n[[File:engine 493.jpg|thumb|right|K-37 Steam locomotive #493 in Silverton Yard]]\nThe 490 series or K-37 class locomotives were part of a class of thirty standard gauge class 190 (later, class C-41) [[2-8-0]] engines built in 1902 for the [[Denver and Rio Grande Railroad|D&RG]] by [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]]. In 1928 and 1930 ten of the C-41s were rebuilt at the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|Rio Grande]]'s Burnham Shops in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] into {{Track gauge|3ft|lk=on}} [[Narrow-gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] {{whyte|2-8-2}}s. The D&SNG operated only one K-37. #497 was rebuilt in 1984 and operated for seven years. It is the only K-37 to go to Silverton under its own power. It was later determined that the [[Trailing wheel|trailing truck]] was having trouble negotiating the curves in the Animas Canyon. The D&SNG traded 497 to the C&TS for [[Rio Grande class K-36|K-36 class #482]]. This trade was mutually beneficial for both railroads as it gave the C&TS a fully operational locomotive, giving in exchange a locomotive that had never run, and likely would never operate under C&TS ownership. Numbers 493 and 498 are owned by the D&SNG, but are not operational. On May 4, 2016 K-37 #493 was hauled to Durango from Silverton by K-36 #481 to be transported to the Colorado Railroad Museum in Golden, Colorado, on a 10-year lease, where they would restore it to operational condition and run it for those 10 years and then return it to the D&SNGRR. However, plans were cancelled and #493 sat outside the Durango roundhouse with an uncertain future for sometime, until 2018 when she was put in the roundhouse for restoration. It is estimated it could take up to two years to finish the restoration. 493 is being restored to use oil vs. coal. This will allow it to operate when the coal fired engines cannot, since oil fired engines do not emit cinders. 493 ran under its own power for the first time on January 24, 2020. K-37 #498 rests in the Durango yard near the turntable without a tender and with no plans to restore it, given its deteriorated condition. #499 was included in the 1981 purchase from the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|D&RGW]] as well, and was stored in [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]] until 1999 when it was cosmetically restored and traded for [[Rio Grande class K-36|K-36 class #486]], which had been on display and out of operation at Royal Gorge since the early 1960s.\n[[File:K-37 -493 in Durango, Colorado.jpg|thumb|#493 in Durango after the May 4th, 2016 move from Silverton to Durango]]\n\n===Diesel engines===\nDiesels were first introduced to the Durango Yard in the 1960s with Diesel locomotive #50. Number 50 is now at the [[Colorado Railroad Museum]] in [[Golden, Colorado]]. The United States Transportation Corps. also had a six-axle narrow-gauge Diesel locomotive (#3000) for trial use in [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]] in the 1950s which saw limited use.\n\nThe D&SNG currently operates four Diesel engines. [[Narrow-gauge]] Diesel engines are just as rare as any other [[Narrow-gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] equipment. All of the Diesel engines of the D&SNG are of center cab style, where the cab straddles the center of the locomotive. Below are the Diesel engines currently used by the D&SNG:\n\n# Hotshot #1 is a 50-ton center cab engine built in 1957, was acquired from Arkansas Limestone Railroad. During the 2002 Missionary Ridge Fire, the D&SNG voluntarily shut down steam service. To help continue service, Hotshot pulled coaches out along the highline from Rockwood. Currently in service.\n# Big Al #7 is an 87-ton center cab engine built in 1975 and was originally Algoma Steel #7, from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. Big Al is named after the owner of the D&S, Allen C. Harper.\n# Diesel engine #9 was acquired in March 2006 and is a 92-ton center cab Diesel. Currently in service.\n# Diesel engine #11 was built by [[U.S. Steel]] with [[General Electric]] parts. It was acquired in March 2006 and is a 98-ton center cab Diesel. Currently in service.\n*RB-1 ([[railbus]]) was built in the winter of 1987\u20131988. It was originally numbered 1001 and was named Tamarron. It could seat 32 people, had its own baggage compartment and restroom, and had a {{convert|300|hp|kW|adj=on}} six-cylinder Caterpillar Diesel engine. This unit was intended for use on the Animas River Railway, and when that operation was shut down, it was found being used as a switcher in the Durango yard. Years later, it was put into revenue service during the 2002 Missionary Ridge Fire, but it is currently not being operated.\n* In April 2020 it was announced that four locomotives have been purchased from the White Pass railway in Alaska.  These will be delivered during 2020.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"175px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Durango K-36-Steam-locomotive-486 Diesel-engine-Big-Al-7 2012-10-25.JPG|K-36 steam locomotive #486 and Diesel engine \"Big Al\" #7 in Durango on October 25, 2012\nFile:Silverton Diesel-engine-11 2012-10-25.JPG|Diesel engine #11 in Silverton on October 25, 2012\n</gallery>\n\n==Operating practice and route description==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\n{{Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad}}\nThe railroad runs {{convert|45|mi|km}} from the Durango yard to Silverton, crossing the Animas River five times throughout the trip. Once trains reach Silverton and unload passengers, the train is turned on the [[wye (rail)|wye]], backs uptown to pick up returning passengers, and makes the trip back to Durango. One way scheduled trains take 3\u00bd hours to run the {{convert|45|mi|km}} each way, with a 2\u00bc hour layover in Silverton.\n\nA train departing [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]] generally takes about one hour between the crew arriving and the train departing. Brakemen inspect the train for cleanliness and required tools for the day, including a flagging kit and marker lamps for the rear of the train. The conductor will sign in his crew and obtain passenger lists and track reports to deliver to his crew. The engineer and fireman will inspect the locomotive and prepare it for the day's trip, making sure all machinery is lubricated and in proper condition, and no last-minute repairs are needed. The fireman will ensure proper coal and water is in the tender, and make sure lubricating oil is on supply and that automatic lubrication is working properly; he will also clean the cab and hose off the engine and tender of ash and dust.\n\nOnce the engine is ready, the locomotive will be pulled onto the mainline, and backed up, working the engine against the brakes to check braking capability, and also to clean the smokebox and cylinders of condensation, and work the cylinders to warm them up for lubrication. The head brakeman will hook the locomotive up to the train, and the car shop will then assist the crew by performing brake tests with the engineer.\n\nScheduled trains on the Durango & Silverton operate on authority by timetable, though on occasion may be annulled for special trains or other circumstances. A train leaving Durango will depart at {{convert|5|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} until the train is off the platform, then advance to {{convert|10|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} until leaving yard limits, where track speed is {{convert|15|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The 15th Street bridge is just east of the Durango yard limits, and maintenance-of-way crews also have a storage area here, where track patrolmen will inspect the train rolling by. The grade is fairly flat until 32nd Street, where a small hill will have the engine work a little until 36th Street. The train will then roll downgrade about {{convert|1/4|mi|km}} and use that to accelerate to {{convert|20|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, which is the track speed between 36th St. and Hermosa. Home Ranch is the first siding past Durango. A new wye has recently been built just east of here to turn trains for the Polar Express and other event trains. As the train runs through the valley, it is traveling on the longest tangent on the railroad, since most of the railroad meanders through the canyon following the river. Motorists can drive alongside the train through here and watch the engine work harder and harder as it starts to climb towards Hermosa. Passing Trimble Lane, the engine will start to pick up some work as the grade stiffens. A scheduled train takes 40 minutes to reach Hermosa from Durango.\n\nHermosa has a small maintenance-of-way yard and siding, as well as the first water tank to fill the engine's tender. Doubleheaded trains will often be put together here, with the helper running light to Hermosa ahead of the train, take on water, and then await the arrival of the train with the road engine spotting itself at the tank and taking on water. After a brake test, the train will then take on the 30 minute, 2.5% climb between Hermosa and Rockwood. As the train climbs away from the valley, passengers will notice the locomotives working hard to pull the train through the many curves that now define the railroad. An hour after leaving Durango the train passes under US Highway 550 and slows to {{convert|10|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} to traverse the \"mini-highline\", a rock shelf where the track follows the edge of a small cliff, and then picks up speed again through the meadow at Shalona. This is the last grade crossing the railroad encounters until Silverton. Slowing again after the crossing, the train winds around another rock face above Shalona Lake, with Rockwood being just around the next curve. Rockwood has a short wye and siding, and is also the first flagstop on the line. Being an hour and ten minutes by rail from Durango, some passengers lodging nearby opt to board the train here instead of driving all the way to town. The grade tops off for a while and the helper engine on doubleheaded trains will be cut off here and run ahead light to Tank Creek. As the train enters the narrow rock cut, it becomes the only ground transportation into the Animas Canyon. Passengers immediately notice the slow pace of the train as it winds onto the \"highline\", a famous section of the railroad where the train crawls along the face of high cliffs. The engine crew will usually blow down the engine on the bridge at [[Milestone|MP]] 471.2 to clean sediment from the boiler and the fireman will look back on his side of the train for a highball from the rear brakeman, indicating the rear of the train has cleared the bridge and the engineer can pick up speed to {{convert|15|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, the track speed the rest of the way to Silverton. The roadbed closely follows the Animas River from now on, and the grade fluctuates quite a bit between here and Cascade Canyon. Tacoma is the next flagstop and the railroad has another siding here. At MP 474.5 is the Tank Creek water tank, and engines will stop here for water. The fireman will top off the tender, taking about {{convert|4000|usgal|impgal l|0}}, while the engineer oils around the engine and inspects machinery and bearings. On doubleheaded trains, the helper locomotive will then rejoin the train and perform another brake test.\n\nFrom Tank Creek, trains only travel about {{convert|1|mi|km}} before reaching Tall Timber Resort. Another mile and the train is traveling on a very narrow rock wall before rounding the curve and climbing into Cascade. Cascade is two hours and {{convert|26|mi|km}} by rail from Durango, and in the winter trains are turned here on the wye due to avalanche chutes further up the railroad. After crossing the Animas a third time, the railroad curves to the east and heads towards Needleton. The grade through here tends to stairstep between short steep 3% grades and longer gradual 2-2.5% while winding through many reverse curves. Unlike the mainline that was constructed by the D&RG before arriving in Durango, the Silverton branch was laid without compensated curves, and the trains can really drag into some of the reverse curves against the engine. A {{convert|10|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} speed restriction covers a sharp curve above a rock face at MP 481.5.\n\nNeedleton flag stop is roughly {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} from the Needleton siding, and another {{convert|1/4|mi|km}} beyond that to the Needleton water tank. Trains stopping at Needleton flag stop are for backpackers usually hiking up to the Chicago Basin, as well as occasional homesteaders who have cabins in the forest. Locomotives have a hard time starting the trains from a stop here as well as leaving from the tank stop, indicated by the layer of sand on the tracks and the frequency of the valves centering up, forcing the engineer to back the locomotive up a foot or so before trying to start forward again. On the westbound trains, the tender only needs about {{convert|1000|usgal|impgal l|0}} to be topped off before proceeding to Silverton, however, the steepest grade lies ahead. The track out of Needleton is around 2.5%, with a little ease around MP 486, but then quickly steepens again, topping off 4% at MP 488. From MP 488 to Elk Park the fireman finally gets a break on the wider, sweeping curves and flatter grade.\n\nElk Park is the last siding, wye, and flagstop before Silverton. Not as popular as Needleton for hikers, Elk Park is where the railroad crosses the Colorado Trail and it often serves as a hunting camp in season. Also past Elk Park, the railroad is among some of the highest concentration of avalanche chutes in the state. The Snowshed Slide once had a snowshed, until burning and leaving behind remnants of what once gave the slide its name. The grade has one decent pull approaching Snowshed, but afterwards is pretty easy the rest of the way to Silverton, and also has longer, sweeping, slightly elevated curves which allow for smooth running. The engineer will blow a warning whistle approaching the sharp curve at Cataract, the narrowest section of the entire canyon, before opening up to the valley that holds Silverton.\n\nThe railroad crosses the Animas one last time before entering yard limits. The train slows to {{convert|10|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and blows a long station call on the whistle before passing the depot. After the train arrives, passengers deboard the train and the crew backs the train down to the wye for servicing. An ashpit was recently constructed for use and to aid in heavier repairs if needed, which do happen on occasion. After shoving the train uptown for boarding passengers, the engineer will oil and inspect the engine once again and the crew will perform another brake test for the return trip to Durango.\n\nTrains will almost always use straight air unless conditions or equipment don't allow. The engineer won't need to use steam for power to move the train until just east of Tacoma, and after climbing to Rockwood, can drift again all the way to Trimble Lane in the valley near Durango. Trains coming from Silverton will top off with water again at Needleton on the return, and Cascade trains won't need water for the return.\n\nAfter arrival in Durango, steam locomotives are cut from the trains for immediate servicing, which can make the shop crew pretty busy in the summer with four or five locomotives being tended. Servicing includes coaling up the tender, adding wood pellets for fuel for overnight stoking, refilling the sand supply, cleaning or dropping the fire depending on the schedule for the locomotive, and then spotting the engine in the roundhouse to apply grease, shoot bearings, refill oilers, and replenish water. Running {{convert|90|mi|km|adj=on}} trips each day in the summer with the heavy trains will also cause damage to the running gear and require heavier repairs at times, which the roundhouse crew is capable of performing.\n\nThe railroad uses a couple of small Diesel switching locomotives for work trains and everyday yard switching to allow the steam locomotives to enter the shop areas sooner. The use of wood pellets for overnight fuel, as well as Diesel switchers are a result of constant complaints from local citizens regarding the [[fly ash]] from the coal-fired engines. Though the railroad has been present in the town since its founding, the D&SNG has tried its best to appease the locals.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"175px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Durango K-36-Steam-locomotive-486 2012-10-25.JPG|K-36 Steam locomotive #486 getting ready for departure from Durango on October 25, 2012\nFile:Durango-Silverton Colors 2012-10-25.JPG|Beautiful colors on the way to Silverton on October 25, 2012\nFile:Durango-Silverton Highline 2012-10-25.JPG|On the Highline above the Animas Canyon on October 25, 2012\nFile:Durango-Silverton Animas-River 2012-10-25.JPG|Along the Animas River to Silverton on October 25, 2012\nFile:Durango-Silverton Approaching-Silverton 2012-10-25.JPG|Approaching Silverton on October 25, 2012\n</gallery>\n\n==D&SNG rolling stock==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\nThe Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad operates over 50 pieces of rolling stock. Some of the cars are the oldest passenger cars in existence.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===Concession cars===\n[[File:Silverton Concession-car-126 2012-10-25.JPG|thumb|right|Concession car #126 in Silverton, October 2012]]\nLike most of the coaches on the D&SNG, the concession cars are good examples of how coaches were renumbered and rebuilt several times by the D&RGW.\n*Concession car 64 was originally mail-baggage 64 built in 1889. In 1983 it was purchased from the Black Hills Central Railroad. 64 returned to service in 1984 as a concession car.\n*Concession car 126 was originally baggage car 27. It was renumbered 126 in 1886. It was converted to a coach-snack bar by the D&RGW in 1963 then reconverted in 1979 to a coach. It was reconverted to a full concession car by the D&SNG in 1982.\n*Concession car 212 was originally coach 20 built in 1879. In 1887 it was rebuilt into a combination coach-baggage car and numbered 215. In 1942, 215 had been sold to a Mexican railway. Then the D&RGW realized that it was larger than another combination car 212. The numbers of the car were switched and the smaller car was sent to [[Mexico]]. In 1964 converted to a coach-snack bar by the D&RGW, then to a 48-passenger coach in 1979. In 1982 it was converted to a snack bar car by the D&SNG. Then, in 1986, it was converted to a full concession car.\n*Concession car 566 was originally mail car 14 built in 1882. Around 1888 it was rebuilt into excursion car 566. In July 1904 it was renumbered 0566. Then it was switched to work service in 1914. It was rebuilt to its original appearance as a postal car by the D&SNG. It was then given its old excursion car number of 566 and is now used as a concession car.\n\n===Coaches===\n[[File:Silverton Bitter-Root-Mine-213 2012-10-25.JPG|thumb|right|Bitter Root Mine 213 in Silverton, October 2012]]\nThe D&SNG operates one combination car 213 named Bitter Root Mine, it was previously named Home Ranch and was built in 1983 by the D&SNG. It has a hydraulic lift for passengers in wheelchairs.\n\nThe D&SNG operates several other coaches:\n\n#257 Shenandoah, built in 1880\n#270 Pinkerton, built in 1880\n#291 King Mine, built in 1881\n#311 McPhee, built in 1881\n#319 Needleton, built in 1882\n#323 Animas City, built in 1887\n#327 Durango, built in 1887\n#330 Cascade, built in 1963\n#331 Trimble, built in 1963\n#332 La Plata, built in 1964\n#333 Tacoma, built in 1964\n#334 Hermosa, built in 1964\n#335 Elk Park, built in 1964\n#336 Rockwood, built in 1964\n#337 Fort Lewis, built in 1964\n#503 Crazy Woman Creek,  Acquired in 2019. 503 was originally a flat car built in the 1940s, then converted for use as a coach in 1982 by the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"175px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Silverton Animas-City-323 2012-10-25.JPG|Animas City 323 in Silverton, October 2012\nFile:Silverton Durango-327 2012-10-25.JPG|Durango 327 in Silverton, October 2012\nFile:Silverton Cascade-330 2012-10-25.JPG|Cascade 330 in Silverton, October 2012\nFile:Silverton La-Plata-332 2012-10-25.JPG|La Plata 332 in Silverton, October 2012\n</gallery>\n\n====Cinco Animas B-2====\n[[File:Silverton Cinco-Animas-B-2 2012-10-25.JPG|thumb|right|Cinco Animas B-2 in Silverton, October 2012]]\nBuilt in 1883, the Cinco Animas was originally an immigrant sleeper. Immigrant sleepers had very few amenities and had little consideration for passenger comfort. The original Cinco Animas could seat up to thirty passengers. It was turned into a business car in 1913. In 1963 it was purchased by the Cinco Animas Corporation, where it received its present name. Then, in 1982, the Cinco Animas was sold to the D&S. It runs daily throughout the summer.\n\n====Nomad B-3====\nBuilt in 1878, the Nomad was originally named Fairplay. In 1886, it was rebuilt as Business Car N. It is reportedly the favorite car of D&RG president William Jackson Palmer. The Fairplay has hosted Presidents William H Taft, Ulysses S Grant and Theodore Roosevelt. While being owned by several parties between 1951\u20131982 the Fairplay was renamed the Nomad. It was acquired by the D&S in 1982. Today it is the oldest private railroad coach still in service in the United States. It runs daily throughout the summer.\n\n====General Palmer B-7====\nThe General Palmer was built in 1880 as a business car for the D&RG. In later years it fell into disrepair. It was restored in 2001 at a cost of $250,000 by the D&S. Its modern amenities include internet service and a twenty-inch flat paneled television. The General Palmer is exclusively used by owner [[Allen Harper]], his family and guests.\n\n====San Juan 312====\nBuilt by the D&RG in 1887, it had clerestory roof and bullnose ends. It was finished in ash and seated forty-six. It was rebuilt in 1937 at the Alamosa shops. Vestuable ends, train-line steam heat, electric lights, and deluxe [[Heywood-Wakefield Company|Heywood-Wakefield]] reclining coach seats for 24 passenger were installed. The D&S named coach 312 the Silverton. In the winter of 2007\u20132008 it was rebuilt with overstuffed seating for in a wide three across arrangement and had its name changed to San Juan. It runs during the summer time.\n\n====Alamosa 350====\n[[File:Silverton Alamosa-350 2012-10-25.JPG|thumb|right|Alamosa 350 in Silverton, October 2012]]\nBuilt in 1880, it was originally named the Hildago as Horton chair car number 25. It was changed to car 403 in 1885. It was then rebuilt into an office living car for members of the Valuation Survey in 1919. Valuation Survey was inventorying the entire railroad property after it was returned to the D&RGW after World War 1. In 1924 it was converted into a parlor-smoker car. After a rebuild in 1937 it became a parlor-buffet car named Alamosa. The car had a closed vestibule, with steam heat, electric lights and seats for fourteen passengers. In 1957 it was converted for coach service. It was renumbered 350 in 1959. In 1981 it was purchased by the D&S and converted to a parlor car and seats twenty-five people. There was another car with the same name that was destroyed in a derailment on the [[Rio Grande Southern Railroad]]. It runs daily throughout the summer.\n\n====Prospector 630====\nWas built in 1984 as a coach and was named Hunt. In 2009 it became a family upscale coach. The Prospector features comfortable table and chair style seating. The ceiling of the Prospector features an enlarged route map, making it easy for passengers to follow the train's progress along the route.\n\n====Tall Timber Legend 631 & Tall Timber Legacy 632====\n631 was built in 1985 and named the North Star. 632 was built in 1986 and named Teft. Both cars were built as general passenger cars to help with the increase in passengers. In 2009 the cars were converted with overstuffed seats. They are used mainly to take passengers to Tall Timber to go zip lining.\n\n===Open observation gondolas===\n[[File:Silverton Open-observation-car-415 2012-10-25.JPG|thumb|right|Open observation car #415 in Silverton, October 2012]]\nOpen observation [[Gondola (rail)|gondolas]] 400\u2013402 were built in 1963, equipped with passenger car [[Bogie|trucks]], [[steel]] [[roof]]s, [[tile]] [[floor]]s and [[tram]]way seats. Gondolas 403\u2013405 were built for the 1967 season on The Silverton. Between 1982 and 1985 the D&SNG built Open Observation cars 411 and 412. Open Observation cars 406\u2013409 and 413\u2013416 were built between 1982 and 1986\n* Cars 400\u2013405 and 411\u2013412 are former standard gauge [[boxcar]]s, built in 1916\n* Cars 406\u2013409 and 413\u2013416 are former standard gauge [[stock car (rail)|stock cars]], built in 1937\n\n====Silver Vista 313====\nThe original Silver Vista was built in 1947 by the D&RGW. It was a popular glass-topped observation car and the only one of its kind. The original Silver Vista was destroyed by a fire in Alamosa in 1953. Because of its popularity, there has been speculation that the D&RGW destroyed it on purpose to drive revenue down so they could abandon the line from Silverton to Antonito. The recreation of the Silver Vista was built in 2006. It runs daily throughout the summer.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"175px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Silver Vista observation car Denver and Rio Grande.JPG|The original D&RG Silver Vista car\nFile:Silver Vista observation car Denver and Rio grande 1951.JPG|Side view of the car in 1951\nFile:Silver Vista on the Silverton 1951.JPG|The observation car on the Silverton route in 1951\n</gallery>\n\n====Rio Grande 410====\nBuilt in the winter of 1987\u20131988, the Rio Grande was originally railbus trailer 1002 and was painted red. It was used with the Animas Canyon Railway Diesel-powered rail-bus. It was stored from 1992 to 1997, until it was rebuilt as an open observation car 313. It was given number 313, because it resembled the Silver Vista. After the Silver Vista was built in 2006, it became open observation car 410. In the winter of 2006\u20132007 it was again rebuilt into an open air observation car with comfortable and large overstuffed seats for a more expansive view. It runs daily during the summer.\n\n===Cabooses===\n[[File:Silverton Caboose-0540 2012-10-25.JPG|thumb|right|Caboose #0540 in Silverton Yard]]\nCaboose #0505 was built in 1886 and is stocked with provisions to provide shelter and food.\n\nCaboose #0540 was built in 1881 and is a mini-warehouse, carrying the most common tools and supplies. It is used by Maintenance of Way.\n\n====Caboose 0500====\nIs {{convert|17|ft|m}} long, and was built in 1886. It was originally known as D&RG #1. In 1950 it was sold to [[Robert W.

It is available for charter and can hold up to eight people.\n\n===Rail camp car 3681===\nRail camp car 3681 is an ex-D&RGW boxcar. It was rebuilt by the D&S in 1984 with a kitchen, a bathroom and beds. It is pulled to Cascade Canyon Wye for elegant camping. It can hold a group of up to eight people.\n\n=== Coaches not in service ===\n*Mail baggage car 66 was built in 1887. For some years it was the base of operations for the Animas River Railway in Rockwood, Colorado. Car 66 served as the office, ticket window, and waiting room for the railway. It was then moved to Hermosa, Colorado, as the maintenance of way office.\n*Mail baggage car 119 was built in 1882 and is currently not in service.\n*Coach #460 is the only {{Track gauge|3ft|lk=on}} [[narrow-gauge]] tourist sleeper remaining from a group built in 1886 for the D&RG. In the early 1900s it was assigned to work service and was used on a D&RGW wrecking train as late as 1957. Then it was sold to the [[Black Hills Central Railroad]] in [[South Dakota]]. Then in 1983 the D&SNG purchased coach 460. It has yet to be restored.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"175px\" perrow=\"5\">\nSilverton Maintenance-of-way-train 2012-10-25.JPG|Maintenance of way train in Silverton on October 25, 2012\nSilverton Maintenance-crane 2012-10-25.JPG|Maintenance crane in Silverton on October 25, 2012\nSilverton Speeder-9002 2012-10-25.JPG|Speeder #9002 in Silverton on October 25, 2012\n</gallery>\n\n== Museums ==\nThe D&SNG operates two museums, the D&SNG Museum<ref>[http://www.durangotrain.com/ Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad and Museum] Official site and Museums.</ref> and the Silverton Freight Yard Museum. They both feature historic locomotives and railway equipment used on the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|D&RGW]] line.\n\n===D&SNG Museum===\nOpened in 1998, the D&SNG Museum is a tribute to railroading nationally and southwest Colorado. The museum is located in the Durango roundhouse. Half the roundhouse is used for the steam engines and the other half is for the museum. The museum features memorabilia from the D&RGW and other railroads. It also features many artifacts from the Durango and Silverton areas. There is an HO train layout in the museum. It depicts a narrow-gauge railroad similar to the D&RGW. There is also a movie coach that was used in the filming of [[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]], where the railroad's informational and educational films are featured.\n\n====Class 70 engine no. 42====\nOn display in the Durango and Silverton RR Museum, engine 42 was one of 6 class-70 2-8-0 locomotives built by Baldwin in 1887 for the D&RG. The engine weighs 35 tons and pulls with 17,100&nbsp;lbs of tractive effort. It was originally numbered 420. In November 1916 the engine was sold to the [[Rio Grande Southern]] and was used till the RGS was dismantled in 1952. Engine 42 and a caboose running from Grady, located east of Mancos, Colorado, to Durango was the last train movement on the RGS. In 1953 the engine was sold to the Narrow Gauge Motel in Alamosa. In 1958 the 42 was sold to Magic Mountain Amusement Park in [[Golden, Colorado]], where it was converted to burn fuel oil and operated for a short time. In 1969 it was put on display in [[Monument, Colorado]] in front of a bank. In 1971 engine 42 returned to Golden as a restaurant display at Heritage Square. Finally, in 1983 it was purchased and brought to Durango. It has never been restored to operating condition. It is on display in the museum.\n\n====Baggage car no. 127====\nOriginally flat car 6630, it was rebuilt in 1968 as a baggage car for the film [[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} No. 127 was the third concession car built by the D&SNG.

The new company Animas River Railway was incorporated by the D&SNG, in order to preserve the integrity of its own claim of \"100% coal-fired steam locomotives\". The railbus hauled hikers and fishermen into the canyon from Rockwood. Operations for the Animas River Railway were run out of Rockwood. Former mail baggage car 66 was used as the ticket window, office and waiting room for the railway.\n\nBuilt in 1987\u201388 winter, motorcar 1001 was named Tamarron. It could seat 32 people and had a 300-horsepower six-cylinder caterpillar engine. It also had a baggage compartment and restroom. The trailer 1002 could seat 48 in longitudinal seats.\n\n;1988 schedule\nThe first railbus trip left at 7:30&nbsp;a.m. on May 7 for Elk Park. There were 12:30&nbsp;p.m. and 6:00&nbsp;p.m. trips to Cascade Canyon. The season for the Animas River Railway was supposed to last from May 7 through October 30, but lasted until September 4 due to mechanical problems.\n\n;1989 schedule\nThe railbus was repaired and began operations on May 6, 1989. A 12:01&nbsp;p.m. trip for Cascade Canyon ran until October 29. From May 27 through September 15 Elk Park trips ran at 7:30&nbsp;a.m. and 3:30&nbsp;p.m.\n\n;1990 schedule\nThe schedule for the Animas River Railway remained the same. The last excursion of the Animas River Railway was on September 23 from Rockwood to Cascade. Patronage never met expectations and has not operated since.\n\n;2002 schedule\nDuring the 2002 Missionary Ridge Fire, the D&SNG voluntarily shut down steam service.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} To help continue service, motorcar 1001 now RB-1 and trailer 1002 now 313 took people out to Elk Park from Silverton.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n==Visiting equipment==\nJust as narrow-gauge equipment and parts are rare, narrow-gauge railroads are rare these days too. When narrow-gauge pieces of equipment come back to life there are very few places in the United States where they can run. Many of these pieces run during the railroad's annual Railfest held every August. Below are some pieces of {{Track gauge|3ft|lk=on}} [[narrow-gauge]] equipment that visit the D&SNG railroad.\n\n===D&RGW No. 315===\n{{Main|D&RGW 315}}\nD&RGW No. 315 is a C-18 locomotive, built in 1895 by [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]]. It originally was owned by the [[Florence and Cripple Creek Railroad]] as No. 3. It was then bought by D&RG and became No. 424 and after the railroad was reorganized into D&RGW in 1924 it became No. 315. Around 1941, 315 made its way to Durango and became a yard switcher. It worked around Durango until 1949. To save it from being scrapped, it was leased by the City of Durango as a display. When the D&RGW abandoned the line to Durango, 315 was donated to the Chamber of Commerce in 1968. In 1986 it was put on display at Santa Rita Park. Ownership of 315 was changed from the Chamber of Commerce to the City of Durango. It was restored to operating condition in 2007 by the Durango Railroad Historical Society, which operates the locomotive occasionally on both the Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad and the Cumbres & Toltec Scenic Railroad.\n\n===E&P No. 4===\n{{Main|Eureka Locomotive}}\nEureka and Palisade No. 4 is a Class 8/18 C [[4-4-0]] locomotive, built in 1875 by [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]]. It originally was owned by the Eureka and Palisade Railroad, and was later sold to the Sierra Nevada Wood and Lumber Company. In 1938, it was sold to [[Warner Bros.]] and was used in many films. Eventually, the engine went to the Old Vegas amusement park in Henderson, Nevada, where it became badly damaged by a fire. Finally, it was bought by Dan Markoff and restored to operating condition. Dan privately owns the engine, and on occasion brings it to various railroads to operate, including the D&SNG.\n\n===Casey Jones===\nThe Casey Jones railbus was built in 1915 out of a [[Model T]] and is a predecessor of the [[Galloping Goose (railcar)|Galloping Goose]]. It was originally designed to be an ambulance servicing the Sunnyside Mine in [[Eureka, Colorado]]. It was often used by mine officials to commute to Silverton. It has room for 11 passengers. The Casey Jones is owned by the San Juan Historical Society.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.silvertonhistoricsociety.org | title = San Juan Historical Society}}</ref> In the summer months it is on a siding near the Silverton Depot and in the winter it is on display at the D&SNG Museum in Durango.\n\n===Galloping Goose No. 5===\nGalloping Goose No. 5 went into service on June 8, 1933 and was built by the [[Rio Grande Southern]] railroad. It was built with a 1928 Pierce-Arrow limousine body and running gear. It was rebuilt in 1946/47, using a World War II surplus GMC gasoline truck engine and a Wayne Corporation school bus body. In 1950, the freight/mail compartment was converted to carry 20 additional passengers for sightseeing trips. After RGS was scrapped in 1953, Galloping Goose No. 5 came to rest in Dolores, Colorado.

{"title_page": "Resistance during World War II", "text_new": "{{WWII timeline}}\n\n'''Resistance movements during World War II''' occurred in every occupied country by a variety of means, ranging from non-cooperation to propaganda to hiding crashed pilots and even to outright warfare and the recapturing of towns. In many countries, resistance movements were sometimes also referred to as '''The Underground'''.\n\nAmong the most notable [[resistance movement]]s were the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish Resistance]], including the [[Polish Home Army]], [[Le\u015bni]], and the whole [[Polish Underground State]]; [[Yugoslav Partisans]], the [[Soviet partisans]],{{Ref label|a|a|none}} the [[Italian resistance movement|Italian ''Resistenza'']] led mainly by the [[Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale|Italian CLN]]; the [[French Resistance]],  the [[Belgian Resistance]], the [[Norwegian resistance movement|Norwegian Resistance]], the [[Danish resistance movement|Danish Resistance]], the [[Greek Resistance]], the [[Czech resistance]], the [[Albanian resistance]], the [[Dutch resistance|Dutch Resistance]] especially the \"LO\" (national hiding organisation) and the [[Political repression|politically persecuted]] [[German resistance to Nazism|opposition in Germany]] itself (there were 16 main resistance groups and at least 27 failed [[List of assassination attempts on Adolf Hitler|attempts to assassinate Hitler]] with many more planned): in short, across [[German-occupied Europe]].\n\nMany countries had resistance movements dedicated to fighting or undermining the [[Axis Powers|Axis invaders]], and [[Nazi Germany]] itself also had an [[Widerstand|anti-Nazi movement]]. Although Britain was not occupied during the war, the British made complex preparations for a British resistance movement.  The main  organisation was created by the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS, aka [[MI6]]) and is now known as Section VII.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Fighting Nazi Occupation: British Resistance 1939-1945|last = Atkin|first = Malcolm|publisher = Pen and Sword|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-47383-377-7|location = Barnsley|pages = Chapter 11}}</ref>  In addition there was a short-term secret commando force  called the [[Auxiliary Units]].<ref name=\"coleshillhouse.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.coleshillhouse.com/|title=British Resistance Archive \u2013 Churchill's Auxiliary Units \u2013 A comprehensive online resource.|website=www.coleshillhouse.com}}</ref>  Various organizations were also formed to establish foreign resistance cells or support existing resistance movements, like the British [[Special Operations Executive]] and the American [[Office of Strategic Services]] (the forerunner of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]).\n\nThere were also resistance movements fighting against the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] invaders. In [[Italian East Africa]], after the Italian forces were defeated during the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]], some Italians participated in a [[Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia|guerrilla war against the British]] (1941\u20131943). The German Nazi resistance movement (\"[[Werwolf]]\") never amounted to much. The \"[[Forest Brothers]]\" of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] included many fighters who operated against the [[Occupation of Baltic States|Soviet occupation of the Baltic States]] into the 1960s. During or after the war, similar anti-Soviet resistance rose up in places like [[Romania]], [[Poland]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Chechnya]].\n\nWhile historians and governments of some European countries have attempted to portray resistance to Nazi occupation as widespread among their populations,<ref>Rosbottom, Ronald C. (2014), ''When Paris Went Dark,'' New York: Little, Brown and Company, pp. 198-199</ref> only a small minority of people participated in organized resistance, estimated at one to three percent of the population of countries in western Europe. In eastern Europe where Nazi rule was more oppressive, a larger percentage of people were in organized resistance movements, for example, an estimated 10-15 percent of the Polish population. Passive resistance by non-cooperation with the occupiers was much more common.<ref>Wieviorka, Olivier and Tebinka, Jacek, \"Resisters: From Everyday Life to Counter-state,\"  in ''Surviving Hitler and Mussolini'' (2006), eds: Robert Gildea, Olvier Wieviorka, and Anette Warring, Oxford: Berg, p. 153</ref>\n\n== Organization ==\nAfter the first shock following the [[Blitzkrieg]], people slowly started to get organized, both locally and on a larger scale, especially when [[Jews]] and other groups were starting to be deported and used for the ''[[Arbeitseinsatz]]'' ([[forced labor]] for the Germans). Organization was dangerous, so much resistance was done by individuals. The possibilities depended much on the terrain; where there were large tracts of uninhabited land, especially hills and forests, resistance could more easily get organised undetected. This favoured in particular the [[Soviet partisans]] in [[Eastern Europe]]. In the much more densely populated [[Netherlands]], the [[Biesbosch]] wilderness could be used to go into hiding. In [[northern Italy]], both the [[Alps]] and the [[Apennines]] offered shelter to partisan brigades, though many groups operated directly inside the major cities.\n\nThere were many different types of groups, ranging in activity from [[humanitarian aid]] to armed resistance, and sometimes cooperating to a varying degree. Resistance usually arose spontaneously, but was encouraged and helped mainly from London and Moscow.\n\n==Size==\n<!--a graph could be made combining the table from Yugoslav_Partisans#Composition and https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:AK-Soviet_partisans_numbers.JPG-->\nThe five largest resistance movements in Europe were the Dutch, the French, the Polish, the Soviet, and the Yugoslav; overall their size can be seen as comparable, particularly in the years 1941-1944.\n\nA number of sources note that the Polish [[Home Army]] was the largest resistance movement in Nazi-occupied Europe.

His first bomb detonated in front of the Ministry of aeronautics, and the second detonated in front of police headquarters. Both buildings were damaged and many Germans were injured.\n\nOn the 28th of October 1939 (anniversary of the establishing of Czechoslovakia in 1918) large demonstrations against Nazi occupation took place in Prague. Approximately 100 000 Czechs were concerned. Demonstrators crowded the streets in the city. German police had to disperse the demonstrators and began shooting in the evening. The first victim was baker V\u00e1clav Sedl\u00e1\u010dek, who was shot dead. The second victim was student Jan Opletal, who was seriously injured. He later died on the 11th of November. Another 15 people were badly injured and hundreds of people sustained minor injuries. Approximately 400 people were arrested.\n\nIn March 1940, a [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] unit of the first [[guerilla warfare|guerilla]] organization of the Second World War in Europe, led by Major [[Henryk Dobrza\u0144ski]] (Hubal) completely destroyed a [[battalion]] of German infantry in a skirmish near the Polish village of [[Huciska]]. A few days later in an ambush near the village of [[Sza\u0142asy]] it inflicted heavy casualties upon another German unit. As time progressed, resistance forces grew in size and number. To counter this threat, the German authorities formed a special 1,000 man-strong anti-partisan unit of combined [[SS]]-''Wehrmacht'' forces, including a [[Panzer]] group. Although Dobrza\u0144ski's unit never exceeded 300 men, the Germans fielded at least 8,000 men in the area to secure it.<ref>*Marek Szymanski: ''Oddzial majora Hubala'', Warszawa 1999, {{ISBN|978-83-912237-0-3}}</ref><ref>*[[Aleksandra Ziolkowska-Boehm]]: ''Polish Hero Roman Rodziewicz Fate of a Hubal Soldier in Auschwitz, Buchenwald and Postwar England, Lexington Books, 2013, {{ISBN|978-0-7391-8535-3}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, [[Witold Pilecki]],  [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance]], presented to his superiors a plan to enter Germany's [[Auschwitz|Auschwitz concentration camp]], gather intelligence on the camp from the inside, and organize inmate resistance.<ref>Jozef Garlinski, Fighting Auschwitz: the Resistance Movement in the Concentration Camp, Fawcett, 1975, {{ISBN|978-0-449-22599-8}}, reprinted by Time Life Education, 1993. {{ISBN|978-0-8094-8925-1}}</ref> The [[Home Army]] approved this plan, provided him with a false identity card, and on 19 September 1940, he deliberately went out during a street roundup in Warsaw-[[\u0142apanka]], and was caught by the Germans along with other civilians and sent to Auschwitz.

It was the first Polish uprising and the first anti-Soviet uprising of World War II. Anti-Soviet Poles, most of them teenagers from local high schools, stormed the local [[Red Army]] barracks and a prison, in order to release Polish soldiers kept there.\n\n1940 was the year of establishing [[Warsaw Ghetto]] and infamous death camp [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] by the German Nazis in occupied Poland.\nAmong the many activities of Polish resistance and Polish people one was helping endangered Jews. Polish citizens have the world's highest count of individuals who have been recognized as [[Righteous Among the Nations]] by [[Yad Vashem]] as non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews from extermination during the [[Holocaust]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/righteous/statistics|title=Names of Righteous by Country|website=www.yadvashem.org}}</ref>\n\nOne of the events that helped the growth of the French Resistance was the targeting of the French Jews, Communists, Gypsies, homosexuals, Catholics, and others, forcing many into hiding. This in turn gave the French Resistance new people to incorporate into their political structures.\n\nThe 'Special Operations Executive' [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[World War II]] organisation. Following [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] approval, it was officially formed by [[Minister of Economic Warfare]] [[Hugh Dalton]] on 22 July 1940, to develop a spirit of resistance in the occupied countries and to prepare a [[fifth column]] of resistance fighters to engage in open opposition to the occupiers at such time that the United Kingdom was able to return to the continent.{{sfn|Foot|2004|p=14}} To aid in the transport of agents and the supply of the resistance fighters, a [[Royal Air Force Special Duty Service]] was developed. Whereas the [[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS]] was primarily involved in [[espionage]], the SOE and the resistance fighters were geared toward [[reconnaissance]] of German defenses and [[sabotage]]. In England the SOE was also involved in the formation of the [[Auxiliary Units]], a top secret [[stay-behind]] resistance organisation which would have been activated in the event of a [[Operation Sealion|German invasion of Britain]]. The SOE operated in all countries or former countries occupied by or attacked by the Axis forces, except where demarcation lines were agreed with Britain's principal allies (the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]]).\n\nAfter the war, the organisation was officially dissolved on 15 January 1946.\n\n=== 1941 ===\nIn February 1941, the [[Communist Party of the Netherlands|Dutch Communist Party]] organized a general strike in [[Amsterdam]] and surrounding cities, known as the [[February strike]], in protest against [[Antisemitism|anti-Jewish]] measures by the Nazi occupying force and violence by fascist street fighters against Jews. Several hundreds of thousands of people participated in the strike. The strike was put down by the Nazis and some participants were executed.\n\nIn April 1941, the [[Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation]] was established in the [[Province of Ljubljana]].

Organized as a military mini-state it existed throughout the autumn of 1941 in the western part of Serbia. The Republic was established by the Partisan resistance movement and its administrative center was in the town of U\u017eice.

The main Partisan force escaped into [[Serbia]].\n\nOn 19 April 1943, three members of the [[Belgian resistance]] movement were able to stop the [[Twentieth convoy]], which was the 20th prisoner transport in [[Belgium]] organised by the Germans during [[World War II]]. The exceptional action by members of the Belgian resistance occurred to free [[Jews|Jewish]] and [[Romani people|Romani]] (\"Gypsy\") civilians who were being transported by train from the Dossin army base located in [[Mechelen transit camp|Mechelen]], [[Belgium]] to the concentration camp [[Auschwitz]]. The 20th train convoy transported 1,631 Jews (men, women and children). Some of the prisoners were able to escape and marked this particular kind of liberation action by the Belgian resistance movement as unique in the European history of the [[Holocaust]].\n\nIn October 1943, [[Rescue of the Danish Jews|the rescue of the Danish Jews]] meant that nearly all of the Danish Jews were saved from KZ camps by the [[Danish resistance movement|Danish resistance]]. This action is considered one of the bravest and most significant displays of public defiance against the Nazis. However, the action was largely due to the personal intervention of German diplomat [[Georg Ferdinand Duckwitz]], who both leaked news of the intended round up of the Jews to both the Danish opposition and Jewish groups and negotiated with the Swedes to ensure Danish Jews would be accepted in Sweden.\n\nThe [[Battle of Sutjeska]] from 15 May-16 June 1943 was a joint attack of the Axis forces that once again attempted to destroy the main Yugoslav Partisan force, near the [[Sutjeska (river)|Sutjeska]] river in southeastern Bosnia. The Axis rallied 127,000 troops for the offensive, including German, [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Italian]], [[Independent State of Croatia|NDH]], [[Bulgaria]]n and [[Cossack]] units, as well as over 300 airplanes (under German operational command), against 18,000 soldiers of the primary Yugoslav Partisans operational group organised in 16 brigades. Facing almost exclusively German troops in the final encirclement, the Yugoslav Partisans finally succeeded in breaking out across the Sutjeska river through the lines of the German ''118th J\u00e4ger Division,'' ''104th J\u00e4ger Division'' and ''369th (Croatian) Infantry Division'' in the northwestern direction, towards eastern Bosnia. Three brigades and the central hospital with over 2,000 wounded remained surrounded and, following Hitler's instructions, German commander-in-chief General [[Alexander L\u00f6hr]] ordered and carried out their annihilation, including the wounded and unarmed medical personnel. In addition, Partisan troops suffered from a severe lack of food and medical supplies, and many were struck down by [[typhoid]]. However, the failure of the offensive marked a turning point for [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] during World War II.\n\n'''[[Operation Heads]]''' started\u2014an action of serial [[assassinations]] of the Nazi personnel sentenced to death by the [[Special Courts]] for crimes against Polish citizens in [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupied Poland]]. The Resistance fighters of Polish [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]]'s unit [[Batalion Parasol|Agat]] kill [[Franz B\u00fcrkl]] during [[Operation B\u00fcrkl]] in 1943, and [[Franz Kutschera]] during [[Operation Kutschera]] in 1944. Both men were high-ranking Nazi German [[SS]] and secret police officers responsible for the murder and brutal interrogation of thousands of Polish Jews and Polish resistance fighters and supporters.\n\nThe [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] lasted from 19 April-16 May, and cost the Nazi forces 17 dead and 93 wounded.\n\nOn 30 September the [[Nazi Germany|German]] forces occupying the [[Italy|Italian]] city of [[Naples]] were forced out by the townsfolk and the [[Italian Resistance]] before the [[Allied invasion of Italy#Further Allied advances|arrival of the first Allied forces]] in the city on 1 October.

The operation was led by Major [[Patrick Leigh Fermor]], together with Captain [[W. Stanley Moss]], Greek [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] agents and [[Cretan resistance|Cretan resistance fighters]]. However, M\u00fcller left the island before the plan could be carried out. Undeterred, Fermor decided to abduct [[Heinrich Kreipe|General Heinrich Kreipe]] instead.\n\nOn the night of 26 April, General Kreipe left his headquarters in [[Archanes]] and headed without escort to his well-guarded residence, \"Villa Ariadni\", approximately {{convert|50|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}25&nbsp;km outside [[Heraklion]]. Major Fermor and Captain Moss, dressed as German military policemen, waited for him {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} before his residence. They asked the driver to stop and asked for their papers. As soon as the car stopped, Fermor quickly opened Kreipe's door, rushed in and threatened him with his guns while Moss took the driver's seat. After driving some distance the British left the car, with suitable decoy material being planted that suggesting an escape off the island had been made by [[submarine]], and with the General began a cross-country march. Hunted by German patrols, the group moved across the mountains to reach the southern side of the island, where a British [[Motor Launch]] (''ML 842'', commanded by Brian Coleman)  was to pick them up. Eventually, on 14 May 1944, they were picked up (from Peristeres beach near Rhodakino) and transferred to Egypt.\n\nIn April\u2013May 1944, the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] launched the daring airborne [[Raid on Drvar]] aimed at capturing Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]], the commander-in-chief of the [[Yugoslav Partisans]], as well as disrupting their leadership and command structure. The Partisan headquarters were in the hills near [[Drvar]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] at the time. The representatives of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s [[Randolph Churchill]] and [[Evelyn Waugh]], were also present. Elite German SS parachute commando units fought their way to Tito's [[cave]] headquarters and exchanged heavy gunfire resulting in numerous casualties on both sides.<ref>pp. 343-376, Eyre</ref> [[Chetniks]] under [[Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]] also flocked to the firefight in their own attempt to capture Tito. By the time German forces had penetrated to the cave, however, Tito had already fled the scene. He had a train waiting for him that took him to the town of [[Jajce]]. It would appear that Tito and his staff were well prepared for emergencies. The commandos were only able to retrieve Tito\u2019s marshal's uniform, which was later displayed in [[Vienna]]. After fierce fighting in and around the village cemetery, the Germans were able to link up with mountain troops. By that time, Tito, his British guests and [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] survivors were f\u00eated aboard the [[Royal Navy]] [[destroyer]] {{HMS|Blackmore||6}} and her captain Lt. Carson, RN.\n\nAn intricate series of resistance operations were launched in France prior to, and during, [[Operation Overlord]].\nOn June 5, 1944, the [[BBC]] broadcast a group of unusual sentences, which the Germans knew were code words\u2014possibly for the invasion of Normandy. The BBC would regularly transmit hundreds of personal messages, of which only a few were really significant. A few days before D-Day, the commanding officers of the Resistance heard the first line of [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine's]] poem, \"[[Chanson d'automne]]\", ''\"Les sanglots longs des violons de l'automne\"'' (''Long sobs of autumn violins'') which meant that the \"day\" was imminent. When the second line ''\"Blessent mon c\u0153ur d'une langueur monotone\"'' (''wound my heart with a monotonous langour'') was heard, the Resistance knew that the invasion would take place within the next 48 hours. They then knew it was time to go about their respective pre-assigned missions. All over France resistance groups had been coordinated, and various groups throughout the country increased their sabotage. Communications were cut, trains derailed, roads, water towers and ammunition depots destroyed and German garrisons were attacked. Some relayed info about German defensive positions on the beaches of Normandy to American and British commanders by radio, just prior to 6 June. Victory did not come easily; in June and July, in the [[Vercors plateau]] a newly reinforced maquis group fought more than 10,000 German soldiers (no Waffen-SS) under General Karl Pflaum and was defeated, with 840 casualties (639 fighters and 201 civilians).

The confusion often stems from the fact that as war progressed, some resistance movements grew larger \u2013 and other diminished. In particular, Polish and Soviet territories were mostly freed from Nazi German control in the years 1944-1945, eliminating the need for their respective (anti-Nazi) partisan forces (in Poland, [[cursed soldiers]] continued to fight against the Soviets). Fighting in Yugoslavia, however, with Yugoslavian partisans fighting German units, [[Yugoslavia in World War II#Partisan General Offensive|continued till the end of the war]]. The numbers for each of those three movements can be roughly estimated as approaching 100,000 in 1941, and 200,000 in 1942, with Polish and Soviet partisan numbers peaking around 1944 at 350,000-400,000, and Yugoslavian, growing till the very end till they reached the 800,000.<ref name=\"Vuk\u0161i\u01072003\"/><ref name=\"Vuk\u0161i\u01072003\"/><ref name=ac/>\n\nSeveral sources note that Polish [[Armia Krajowa]] was the largest resistance movement in [[German-occupied Europe|Nazi-occupied Europe]].

In many countries, resistance movements were sometimes also referred to as '''The Underground'''.\n\nAmong the most notable [[resistance movement]]s were the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish Resistance]], including the [[Polish Home Army]], [[Le\u015bni]], and the whole [[Polish Underground State]]; [[Yugoslav Partisans]], the [[Soviet partisans]],{{Ref label|a|a|none}} the [[Italian resistance movement|Italian ''Resistenza'']] led mainly by the [[Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale|Italian CLN]]; the [[French Resistance]],  the [[Belgian Resistance]], the [[Norwegian resistance movement|Norwegian Resistance]], the [[Danish resistance movement|Danish Resistance]], the [[Greek Resistance]], the [[Czech resistance]], the [[Albanian resistance]], the [[Dutch resistance|Dutch Resistance]] especially the \"LO\" (national hiding organisation) and the [[Political repression|politically persecuted]] [[German resistance to Nazism|opposition in Germany]] itself (there were 16 main resistance groups and at least 27 failed [[List of assassination attempts on Adolf Hitler|attempts to assassinate Hitler]] with many more planned): in short, across [[German-occupied Europe]].\n\nMany countries had resistance movements dedicated to fighting or undermining the [[Axis Powers|Axis invaders]], and [[Nazi Germany]] itself also had an [[Widerstand|anti-Nazi movement]]. Although Britain was not occupied during the war, the British made complex preparations for a British resistance movement.  The main  organisation was created by the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS, aka [[MI6]]) and is now known as Section VII.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Fighting Nazi Occupation: British Resistance 1939-1945|last = Atkin|first = Malcolm|publisher = Pen and Sword|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-47383-377-7|location = Barnsley|pages = Chapter 11}}</ref>  In addition there was a short-term secret commando force  called the [[Auxiliary Units]].<ref name=\"coleshillhouse.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.coleshillhouse.com/|title=British Resistance Archive \u2013 Churchill's Auxiliary Units \u2013 A comprehensive online resource.|website=www.coleshillhouse.com}}</ref>  Various organizations were also formed to establish foreign resistance cells or support existing resistance movements, like the British [[Special Operations Executive]] and the American [[Office of Strategic Services]] (the forerunner of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]).\n\nThere were also resistance movements fighting against the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] invaders. In [[Italian East Africa]], after the Italian forces were defeated during the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]], some Italians participated in a [[Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia|guerrilla war against the British]] (1941\u20131943). The German Nazi resistance movement (\"[[Werwolf]]\") never amounted to much. The \"[[Forest Brothers]]\" of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] included many fighters who operated against the [[Occupation of Baltic States|Soviet occupation of the Baltic States]] into the 1960s. During or after the war, similar anti-Soviet resistance rose up in places like [[Romania]], [[Poland]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Chechnya]].\n\nWhile historians and governments of some European countries have attempted to portray resistance to Nazi occupation as widespread among their populations,<ref>Rosbottom, Ronald C. (2014), ''When Paris Went Dark,'' New York: Little, Brown and Company, pp. 198-199</ref> only a small minority of people participated in organized resistance, estimated at one to three percent of the population of countries in western Europe. In eastern Europe where Nazi rule was more oppressive, a larger percentage of people were in organized resistance movements, for example, an estimated 10-15 percent of the Polish population. Passive resistance by non-cooperation with the occupiers was much more common.<ref>Wieviorka, Olivier and Tebinka, Jacek, \"Resisters: From Everyday Life to Counter-state,\"  in ''Surviving Hitler and Mussolini'' (2006), eds: Robert Gildea, Olvier Wieviorka, and Anette Warring, Oxford: Berg, p. 153</ref>\n\n== Organization ==\nAfter the first shock following the [[Blitzkrieg]], people slowly started to get organized, both locally and on a larger scale, especially when [[Jews]] and other groups were starting to be deported and used for the ''[[Arbeitseinsatz]]'' ([[forced labor]] for the Germans). Organization was dangerous, so much resistance was done by individuals. The possibilities depended much on the terrain; where there were large tracts of uninhabited land, especially hills and forests, resistance could more easily get organised undetected. This favoured in particular the [[Soviet partisans]] in [[Eastern Europe]]. In the much more densely populated [[Netherlands]], the [[Biesbosch]] wilderness could be used to go into hiding. In [[northern Italy]], both the [[Alps]] and the [[Apennines]] offered shelter to partisan brigades, though many groups operated directly inside the major cities.\n\nThere were many different types of groups, ranging in activity from [[humanitarian aid]] to armed resistance, and sometimes cooperating to a varying degree. Resistance usually arose spontaneously, but was encouraged and helped mainly from London and Moscow.\n\n==Size==\n<!--a graph could be made combining the table from Yugoslav_Partisans#Composition and https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:AK-Soviet_partisans_numbers.JPG-->\nThe five largest resistance movements in Europe were the Dutch, the French, the Polish, the Soviet, and the Yugoslav; overall their size can be seen as comparable, particularly in the years 1941-1944.\n\nA number of sources note that the Polish [[Home Army]] was the largest resistance movement in Nazi-occupied Europe.

Following [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] approval, it was officially formed by [[Minister of Economic Warfare]] [[Hugh Dalton]] on 22 July 1940, to develop a spirit of resistance in the occupied countries and to prepare a [[fifth column]] of resistance fighters to engage in open opposition to the occupiers at such time that the United Kingdom was able to return to the continent.{{sfn|Foot|2004|p=14}} To aid in the transport of agents and the supply of the resistance fighters, a [[Royal Air Force Special Duty Service]] was developed. Whereas the [[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS]] was primarily involved in [[espionage]], the SOE and the resistance fighters were geared toward [[reconnaissance]] of German defenses and [[sabotage]]. In England the SOE was also involved in the formation of the [[Auxiliary Units]], a top secret [[stay-behind]] resistance organisation which would have been activated in the event of a [[Operation Sealion|German invasion of Britain]]. The SOE operated in all countries or former countries occupied by or attacked by the Axis forces, except where demarcation lines were agreed with Britain's principal allies (the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]]).\n\nAfter the war, the organisation was officially dissolved on 15 January 1946.\n\n=== 1941 ===\nIn February 1941, the [[Communist Party of the Netherlands|Dutch Communist Party]] organized a general strike in [[Amsterdam]] and surrounding cities, known as the [[February strike]], in protest against [[Antisemitism|anti-Jewish]] measures by the Nazi occupying force and violence by fascist street fighters against Jews.

It was the first organized armed uprising in then occupied Europe, and involved 32,000 people. Most of Montenegro was quickly liberated, except major cities where Italian forces were well fortified. On 12 August \u2014 after a major Italian offensive involving 5 divisions and 30,000 soldiers \u2014 the uprising collapsed as units were disintegrating; poor leadership occurred as well as collaboration.

The main Partisan force escaped into [[Serbia]].\n\nOn 19 April 1943, three members of the [[Belgian resistance]] movement were able to stop the [[Twentieth convoy]], which was the 20th prisoner transport in [[Belgium]] organised by the Germans during [[World War II]]. The exceptional action by members of the Belgian resistance occurred to free [[Jews|Jewish]] and [[Romani people|Romani]] (\"Gypsy\") civilians who were being transported by train from the Dossin army base located in [[Mechelen transit camp|Mechelen]], [[Belgium]] to the concentration camp [[Auschwitz]]. The 20th train convoy transported 1,631 Jews (men, women and children). Some of the prisoners were able to escape and marked this particular kind of liberation action by the Belgian resistance movement as unique in the European history of the [[Holocaust]].\n\nIn October 1943, [[Rescue of the Danish Jews|the rescue of the Danish Jews]] meant that nearly all of the Danish Jews were saved from KZ camps by the [[Danish resistance movement|Danish resistance]]. This action is considered one of the bravest and most significant displays of public defiance against the Nazis. However, the action was largely due to the personal intervention of German diplomat [[Georg Ferdinand Duckwitz]], who both leaked news of the intended round up of the Jews to both the Danish opposition and Jewish groups and negotiated with the Swedes to ensure Danish Jews would be accepted in Sweden.\n\nThe [[Battle of Sutjeska]] from 15 May-16 June 1943 was a joint attack of the Axis forces that once again attempted to destroy the main Yugoslav Partisan force, near the [[Sutjeska (river)|Sutjeska]] river in southeastern Bosnia. The Axis rallied 127,000 troops for the offensive, including German, [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Italian]], [[Independent State of Croatia|NDH]], [[Bulgaria]]n and [[Cossack]] units, as well as over 300 airplanes (under German operational command), against 18,000 soldiers of the primary Yugoslav Partisans operational group organised in 16 brigades. Facing almost exclusively German troops in the final encirclement, the Yugoslav Partisans finally succeeded in breaking out across the Sutjeska river through the lines of the German ''118th J\u00e4ger Division,'' ''104th J\u00e4ger Division'' and ''369th (Croatian) Infantry Division'' in the northwestern direction, towards eastern Bosnia. Three brigades and the central hospital with over 2,000 wounded remained surrounded and, following Hitler's instructions, German commander-in-chief General [[Alexander L\u00f6hr]] ordered and carried out their annihilation, including the wounded and unarmed medical personnel. In addition, Partisan troops suffered from a severe lack of food and medical supplies, and many were struck down by [[typhoid]]. However, the failure of the offensive marked a turning point for [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] during World War II.\n\n'''[[Operation Heads]]''' started\u2014an action of serial [[assassinations]] of the Nazi personnel sentenced to death by the [[Special Courts]] for crimes against Polish citizens in [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupied Poland]].

Both men were high-ranking Nazi German [[SS]] and secret police officers responsible for the murder and brutal interrogation of thousands of Polish Jews and Polish resistance fighters and supporters.\n\nThe [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] lasted from 19 April-16 May, and cost the Nazi forces 17 dead and 93 wounded.\n\nOn 30 September the [[Nazi Germany|German]] forces occupying the [[Italy|Italian]] city of [[Naples]] were forced out by the townsfolk and the [[Italian Resistance]] before the [[Allied invasion of Italy#Further Allied advances|arrival of the first Allied forces]] in the city on 1 October.

The operation was led by Major [[Patrick Leigh Fermor]], together with Captain [[W. Stanley Moss]], Greek [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] agents and [[Cretan resistance|Cretan resistance fighters]]. However, M\u00fcller left the island before the plan could be carried out. Undeterred, Fermor decided to abduct [[Heinrich Kreipe|General Heinrich Kreipe]] instead.\n\nOn the night of 26 April, General Kreipe left his headquarters in [[Archanes]] and headed without escort to his well-guarded residence, \"Villa Ariadni\", approximately {{convert|50|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}25&nbsp;km outside [[Heraklion]]. Major Fermor and Captain Moss, dressed as German military policemen, waited for him {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} before his residence. They asked the driver to stop and asked for their papers. As soon as the car stopped, Fermor quickly opened Kreipe's door, rushed in and threatened him with his guns while Moss took the driver's seat. After driving some distance the British left the car, with suitable decoy material being planted that suggesting an escape off the island had been made by [[submarine]], and with the General began a cross-country march. Hunted by German patrols, the group moved across the mountains to reach the southern side of the island, where a British [[Motor Launch]] (''ML 842'', commanded by Brian Coleman)  was to pick them up. Eventually, on 14 May 1944, they were picked up (from Peristeres beach near Rhodakino) and transferred to Egypt.\n\nIn April\u2013May 1944, the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] launched the daring airborne [[Raid on Drvar]] aimed at capturing Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]], the commander-in-chief of the [[Yugoslav Partisans]], as well as disrupting their leadership and command structure. The Partisan headquarters were in the hills near [[Drvar]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] at the time. The representatives of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s [[Randolph Churchill]] and [[Evelyn Waugh]], were also present. Elite German SS parachute commando units fought their way to Tito's [[cave]] headquarters and exchanged heavy gunfire resulting in numerous casualties on both sides.<ref>pp. 343-376, Eyre</ref> [[Chetniks]] under [[Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]] also flocked to the firefight in their own attempt to capture Tito. By the time German forces had penetrated to the cave, however, Tito had already fled the scene. He had a train waiting for him that took him to the town of [[Jajce]]. It would appear that Tito and his staff were well prepared for emergencies. The commandos were only able to retrieve Tito\u2019s marshal's uniform, which was later displayed in [[Vienna]]. After fierce fighting in and around the village cemetery, the Germans were able to link up with mountain troops. By that time, Tito, his British guests and [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] survivors were f\u00eated aboard the [[Royal Navy]] [[destroyer]] {{HMS|Blackmore||6}} and her captain Lt. Carson, RN.\n\nAn intricate series of resistance operations were launched in France prior to, and during, [[Operation Overlord]].\nOn June 5, 1944, the [[BBC]] broadcast a group of unusual sentences, which the Germans knew were code words\u2014possibly for the invasion of Normandy. The BBC would regularly transmit hundreds of personal messages, of which only a few were really significant. A few days before D-Day, the commanding officers of the Resistance heard the first line of [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine's]] poem, \"[[Chanson d'automne]]\", ''\"Les sanglots longs des violons de l'automne\"'' (''Long sobs of autumn violins'') which meant that the \"day\" was imminent. When the second line ''\"Blessent mon c\u0153ur d'une langueur monotone\"'' (''wound my heart with a monotonous langour'') was heard, the Resistance knew that the invasion would take place within the next 48 hours. They then knew it was time to go about their respective pre-assigned missions. All over France resistance groups had been coordinated, and various groups throughout the country increased their sabotage. Communications were cut, trains derailed, roads, water towers and ammunition depots destroyed and German garrisons were attacked. Some relayed info about German defensive positions on the beaches of Normandy to American and British commanders by radio, just prior to 6 June. Victory did not come easily; in June and July, in the [[Vercors plateau]] a newly reinforced maquis group fought more than 10,000 German soldiers (no Waffen-SS) under General Karl Pflaum and was defeated, with 840 casualties (639 fighters and 201 civilians). Following the [[Tulle Murders]], Major Otto Diekmann's Waffen-SS company wiped out the village of [[Oradour-sur-Glane]] on 10 June. The resistance also assisted the later Allied invasion in the south of France ([[Operation Dragoon]]).\nThey started insurrections in cities such as [[Liberation of Paris|Paris]] when allied forces came close.\n\n[[Operation Halyard]], which took place between August and December 1944,<ref name=\"Pe\u0161i\u01072004\">{{cite book|author=Miodrag D.

The series of raids on the plant was later dubbed by the British [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] as the most successful act of sabotage in all of World War II, and was used as a basis for the US war movie ''[[The Heroes of Telemark]]''.\n\nAs an initiation of their uprising, [[Slovak National Uprising|Slovakian rebels]] entered Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica on the morning of 30 August 1944, the second day of the rebellion, and made it their headquarters. By 10 September, the insurgents gained control of large areas of central and eastern Slovakia. That included two captured airfields, and as a result of the two-week-old insurgency, the Soviet Air Force were able to begin flying in equipment to Slovakian and Soviet partisans.\n\n== Resistance

The confusion often stems from the fact that as war progressed, some resistance movements grew larger \u2013 and other diminished. In particular, Polish and Soviet territories were mostly freed from Nazi German control in the years 1944-1945, eliminating the need for their respective (anti-Nazi) partisan forces (in Poland, [[cursed soldiers]] continued to fight against the Soviets). Fighting in Yugoslavia, however, with Yugoslavian partisans fighting German units, [[Yugoslavia in World War II#Partisan General Offensive|continued till the end of the war]]. The numbers for each of those three movements can be roughly estimated as approaching 100,000 in 1941, and 200,000 in 1942, with Polish and Soviet partisan numbers peaking around 1944 at 350,000-400,000, and Yugoslavian, growing till the very end till they reached the 800,000.<ref name=\"Vuk\u0161i\u01072003\"/><ref name=\"Vuk\u0161i\u01072003\"/><ref name=ac/>\n\nSeveral sources note that Polish [[Armia Krajowa]] was the largest resistance movement in [[German-occupied Europe|Nazi-occupied Europe]]. For example, [[Norman Davies]] wrote \"Armia Krajowa (Home Army), the AK, which could fairly claim to be the largest of European resistance\";<ref>[[Norman Davies]], ''God's Playground: A History of Poland'', Columbia University\nPress, 2005, {{ISBN|0-231-12819-3}}, [https://archive.org/details/godsplaygroundhi00norm_0/page/344 <!-- quote=\"Armia Krajowa\" largest. --> Google Print p.344]</ref> [[Gregor Dallas]] wrote \"Home Army (Armia Krajowa or AK) in late 1943 numbered around 400,000, making it the largest resistance organization in Europe\";<ref name=\"Google Print, p.79\"/> [[Mark Wyman]] wrote \"Armia Krajowa was considered the largest underground resistance unit in wartime Europe\".<ref>Mark Wyman, ''DPs: Europe's Displaced Persons, 1945-1951'', Cornell University Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-8014-8542-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lHNw7MnsmlYC&pg=PA34&dq=%22Armia+Krajowa%22+largest&lr=&as_brr=3&ei=NzzMR_mOIJGSzQSb7cSwCQ&sig=kv3oN5z3YgAgcT8Vgy4aIFRHknE Google Print, p.34]</ref> Certainly, Polish resistance was the largest resistance till German [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] and [[invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941.\n\nAfter that point, the numbers of [[Soviet partisans]] and [[Yugoslav partisans]] begun growing rapidly. The numbers of [[Soviet partisans]] quickly caught up and were very similar to that of the Polish resistance (a graph is also available [[:File:AK-Soviet partisans numbers.JPG|here]]).<ref name=\"Vuk\u0161i\u01072003\"/><ref>See for example: Leonid D.

Around 1920, it began increasingly to be referred to as the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), a title that it has continued to use to the present day and which was enshrined in statute in the Intelligence Services Act 1994. During the Second World War, the name MI6 was used as a flag of convenience, the name by which it is frequently known in popular culture since.<ref name=\"sisweb\" />\n\nIn the immediate post-war years under [[Mansfield Smith-Cumming|Sir Mansfield George Smith-Cumming]] and throughout most of the 1920s, SIS was focused on Communism, in particular, Russian Bolshevism.

In July 2005, the British and Polish governments jointly produced a two-volume study of bilateral intelligence cooperation in the War, which revealed information that had until then been officially secret. The ''Report of the Anglo-Polish Historical Committee'' was written by leading historians and experts who had been granted unprecedented access to British intelligence archives, and concluded that 48 percent of all reports received by British secret services from continental Europe in 1939\u201345 had come from Polish sources.<ref name=\"google1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EJ5vIyDBpLcC&pg=PA234 |title=The Eagle Unbowed: Poland and the Poles in the Second World War |first=Halik |last=Kochanski |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-0674068148|pages=234-235}}</ref> This was facilitated by the fact that occupied Poland had a tradition of insurgency organizations passed down through generations, with networks in emigre Polish communities in Germany and France. A major part of Polish resistance activity was clandestine and involved cellular intelligence networks; while Nazi Germany used Poles as forced labourers across the continent, putting them in a unique position to spy on the enemy. Liaison was undertaken by SIS officer [[Wilfred Dunderdale]], and reports included advanced warning of the [[Afrikakorps]]' departure for Libya, awareness of the readiness of Vichy French units to fight against the Allies or switch sides in [[Operation Torch]], and advance warning both of [[Operation Barbarossa]] and [[Operation Edelweiss]], the German Caucasus campaign. [[Armia Krajowa and V-1 and V-2|Polish-sourced reporting on German secret weapons]] began in 1941, and [[Operation Most III|Operation Wildhorn]] enabled a British special operations flight to airlift a [[V-2 Rocket]] that had been captured by the Polish resistance. Polish secret agent [[Jan Karski]] delivered the British the first Allied intelligence on the [[Holocaust]]. Via a female Polish agent, the British also had a channel to the anti-Nazi chief of the [[Abwehr]], Admiral [[Wilhelm Canaris]].<ref name=\"google1\"/>\n\nThe most significant failure of the service during the war was known as the [[Venlo incident]], named for the Dutch town where much of the operation took place. Agents of the German army secret service, the ''[[Abwehr]]'', and the counter-espionage section of the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD), posed as high-ranking officers involved in a plot to depose [[Hitler]]. In a series of meetings between SIS agents and the 'conspirators', [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] plans to abduct the SIS team were shelved due to the presence of Dutch police. On the night of 8\u20139 November 1939, a meeting took place without police presence.

In the mid-1990s these were consolidated into a new post of Controller, Global and Functional.<ref>Davies (2004), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TTW2h5GHlWkC&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=Controller,+Global+and+Functional+mi6&source=bl&ots=vzKfe_R9rL&sig=T0y1Zqyx8plT752vCpx6t3kRdI8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj6u6Pvz-beAhWrBcAKHWIxBf0Q6AEwCnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Controller%2C%20Global%20and%20Functional%20mi6&f=false p. 354]</ref>\n\nDuring the transition, then-C Sir [[Colin McColl]] embraced a new, albeit limited, policy of openness towards the press and public, with 'public affairs' falling into the brief of Director, Counter-Intelligence and Security (renamed Director, Security and Public Affairs). McColl's policies were part and parcel with a wider 'open government initiative' developed from 1993 by the government of [[John Major]]. As part of this, SIS operations, and those of the national signals intelligence agency, [[GCHQ]], were placed on a statutory footing through the 1994 [[Intelligence Services Act 1994|Intelligence Services Act]]. Although the Act provided procedures for authorisations and warrants, this essentially enshrined mechanisms that had been in place at least since 1953 (for authorisations) and 1985 (under the [[Interception of Communications Act 1985|Interception of Communications Act]], for warrants). Under this Act, since 1994, SIS and GCHQ activities have been subject to scrutiny by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament's]] [[Intelligence and Security Committee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/13/pdfs/ukpga_19940013_en.pdf|title=Intelligence Services Act 1994|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring the mid-1990s the British intelligence community was subjected to a comprehensive costing review by the government. As part of broader defence cut-backs SIS had its resources cut back twenty-five percent across the board and senior management was reduced by forty percent. As a consequence of these cuts, the Requirements division (formerly the Circulating Sections of the 1921 Arrangement) were deprived of any representation on the board of directors. At the same time, the Middle East and Africa controllerates were pared back and amalgamated. According to the findings of Lord Butler of Brockwell's ''Review of Weapons of Mass Destruction'', the reduction of operational capabilities in the Middle East and of the Requirements division's ability to challenge the quality of the information the Middle East Controllerate was providing weakened the [[Joint Intelligence Committee (United Kingdom)|Joint Intelligence Committee]]'s estimates of [[Iraq]]'s non-conventional weapons programmes. These weaknesses were major contributors to the UK's erroneous assessments of Iraq's 'weapons of mass destruction' prior to the 2003 invasion of that country.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Politics/documents/2004/07/14/butler.pdf|title=Review of Intelligence on weapons of mass destruction|publisher=Committee led by Lord Butler|accessdate=1 July 2012|location=London}}</ref>\n\nOn one occasion in 1998, MI6 believed it might be able to obtain 'actionable intelligence' which could help the CIA capture [[Osama Bin Laden]], the leader of [[Al Qaeda]]. But given that this might result in his being transferred or rendered to the United States, MI6 decided it had to ask for ministerial approval before passing the intelligence on (in case he faced the death penalty or mistreatment). This was approved by a minister 'provided the CIA gave assurances regarding humane treatment'. In the end, not enough intelligence came through to make it worthwhile going ahead.<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.313</ref>\n\nIn 2001, it became clear that working with [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] and his [[Northern Alliance|forces]] was the best option for going after Bin Laden; the priority for MI6 was developing intelligence coverage. The first real sources were being established, although no one penetrated the upper tier of the Al Qaeda leadership itself. As the year progressed, plans were drawn up and slowly worked their way up to the [[White House]] on 4 September 2001-which involved increasing dramatically support for Massoud. MI6 were involved in these plans.<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.313-314</ref>\n\n===War on Terror===\nDuring the [[Global War on Terror]], SIS accepted information from the CIA that was obtained through [[torture]], including the [[extraordinary rendition by the United States|extraordinary rendition]] programme.

In January 2002, they began interviewing prisoners held by the Americans. On 10 January 2002, an MI6 officer conducted his first interview of a detainee held by the Americans. He reported back to London that there were aspects of the way the detainee had been handled by the US military before the interview that did not appear consistent with the [[Geneva Conventions]]. Two days after the interview, he was sent instructions, copied to all MI5 and MI6 officers in Afghanistan, about how to deal with concerns over mistreatment, referring to signs of abuse: \"Given that they are not within our custody or control, the law does not require you to intervene to protect this.\" It went on to say that the Americans had to understand that the UK did not condone such mistreatment and that a complaint should be made to a senior US official if there was any coercion by the US in conjunction with an MI6 interview.<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.339</ref>\n\nIn the run-up to the [[invasion of Iraq in 2003]], it is alleged, although not confirmed, that some SIS members conducted [[Operation Mass Appeal]] which was a campaign to plant stories about Iraq's WMDs in the media.

In the months after the invasion, they also began gathering political intelligence; predicting what would happen in post-Baathist Iraq. MI6 personnel in the country never exceeded 50; in early 2004, apart from supporting [[Task Force 88 (anti-terrorist unit)#Task Force Black/Knight|Task Force Black]] in hunting down former senior Ba'athist party members, MI6 also made an effort to target \"transnational terrorism\"/jihadist networks that led to the SAS carrying out Operation Aston in February 2004: They conducted a raid on a house in Baghdad that was part of a \"jihadist pipeline\" that ran from Iran to Iraq that US and UK intelligence agencies were tracking suspects on \u2013 the raid captured members of [[Lashkar-e-Taiba|Pakistan based terrorist group]].<ref name=\"urban\">Urban, Mark, ''Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq '', St. Martin's Griffin, 2012 {{ISBN|1250006961}} {{ISBN|978-1250006967}}, pp.10\u201311, p.13, p.15, p.18\u201319, p.50-55, p.56-57, p.67-68, p.95-96, p.101, p.249</ref>\n\nShortly before the [[Second Battle of Fallujah]], MI6 personnel visited [[Joint Special Operations Command|JSOC]]s TSF (Temporary Screening Facility) at [[Balad Air Base]] to question a suspected insurgent. Afterwards they raised concerns about the poor detention conditions there. As a result the British government informed JSOC in Iraq that prisoners captured by British special forces would only be turned over to JSOC if there was an undertaking not to send them to Balad. In Spring 2005, the SAS detachment operating in Basra and southern Iraq, known as Operation Hathor, escorted MI6 case officers into Basra so they could meet their sources and handlers. MI6 provided information that enabled the detachment to carry out surveillance operations. MI6 were also involved in resolving the [[Basra prison incident]]; the SIS played a central role in the British withdrawal from Basra in 2007.<ref name=\"urban\"/>\n\nIn Afghanistan, MI6 worked closely with the military, delivering tactical information and working in small cells alongside Special Forces, surveillance teams, and GCHQ to track individuals from the Taliban and Al Qaeda.<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.399-400</ref>\n\nThe first MI6 knew of the US carrying out the [[Death of Osama bin Laden#Operation Neptune Spear|mission that killed Osama Bin Laden]] on 2 May 2011 was after it happened, when its chief called his American counterpart for an explanation.<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.351</ref> In July 2011 it was reported that SIS had closed several of its stations, particularly in Iraq, where it had several outposts in the south of the country in the region of Basra.

A third individual was branded a British spy in the Balkans and left the office of the High Representative in Bosnia, whilst a further two British intelligence officers working in [[Zagreb]], remained in place despite their cover being blown in the local press. The exposure of the agents across the three capitals has markedly undermined the British intelligence operations in the area, including SIS efforts to capture The Hague's most wanted men, which riled many local intelligence agencies in the Balkans, some of which are suspected of continuing ties to alleged war criminals. They were riled due to MI6 operating \"not so much a spy network as a network of influence within Balkan security services and the media,\" said the director of the International Crisis Group in Serbia and Bosnia, which caused some of them to be \"upset\". In Serbia, the SIS station chief was forced to leave his post in August 2004 after a campaign against him led by country's DB intelligence agency, where his work investigating the [[Assassination of Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107|2003 assassination]] of the reformist prime minister [[Zoran Djindjic]] won him few friends.<ref name=\"MI6 spies exposed by Balkan rivals\"/>\n\nOn 15 November 2006, SIS allowed an interview with current operations officers for the first time.

It was tasked by the [[Director Special Forces]] to support MI6's operations (akin to the CIA's [[Special Activities Center|SAC]] \u2013 a covert paramilitary unit for SIS). It was not a formal squadron within the establishment of any individual UK Special Forces unit, but at the disposal of both the Director Special Forces and the SIS; previously, SIS relied primarily on contractor personnel. The Squadron carried out missions that required 'maximum discretion' in places that were 'off the radar or considered dangerous'; the Squadron's members often operated in plain clothes, with the full range of national support, such as false identities at its disposal. In early March 2011, during the Libyan Civil War, a covert operation in Libya involving E Squadron went wrong: The aim of the mission was to cement SIS's contacts with the rebels by flying in two SIS agents in a [[Chinook]] helicopter to meet a Libyan Intermediary in a town near Benghazi, who had promised to fix them up a meeting with the [[National Transitional Council|NTC]]. A team consisting of six E Squadron members (all from the SAS) and two SIS officers were flown into Libya by an RAF Special Forces Flight Chinook; the Squadron's members were carrying bags containing arms, ammunition, explosives, computers, maps and passports from at least four nationalities. Despite technical backup, the team landed in Libya without any prior agreement with the rebel leadership, and the plan failed as soon as the team landed. The locals became suspicious they were foreign mercenaries or spies and the team was detained by rebel forces and taken to a military base in Benghazi. They were then hauled before a senior rebel leader; the team told him that they were in the country to determine the rebels' needs and to offer assistance, but the discovery of British troops on the ground enraged the rebels who were fearful that Gaddafi would use such evidence to destroy the credibility of the NTC. Negotiations between senior rebel leaders and British officials in London finally led to their release and they were allowed to board [[HMS Cumberland (F85)|HMS Cumberland]].<ref>Stuart, Mark Muller, ''Storm in the Desert: Britain's Intervention in Libya and the Arab Spring'', Birlinn Ltd, 2017, {{ISBN|1780274521}}, {{ISBN|978-1780274522}}</ref><ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.296, p.314</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16624401|title=SAS on ground during Libya crisis|work=BBC News|date=19 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 November 2011 SIS warned the national transitional council in Benghazi after discovering details of planned strikes, said foreign secretary [[William Hague]].

'They worked to identify key political figures, develop contacts with the emerging opposition and provide political and military intelligence. 'Most importantly, they saved lives,' he said.

At the same time, MI5 was seeking alternative accommodation and co-location of the two services was studied. In the end this proposal was abandoned due to the lack of buildings of adequate size (existing or proposed) and the security considerations of providing a single target for attacks. In December 1987, Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s government approved the purchase of the new building for SIS.<ref name=nao>[http://www.nao.org.uk/system_pages/idoc.ashx?docid=0509718d-1528-499b-9d87-a2ced5f41a45&version=-1 ''Thames House and Vauxhall Cross''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607011836/http://www.nao.org.uk/system_pages/idoc.ashx?docid=0509718d-1528-499b-9d87-a2ced5f41a45&version=-1 |date=7 June 2011 }}, Report by the Comptroller and Auditor General, 18 February 2000.</ref>\n\nThe building design was reviewed to incorporate the necessary protection for the UK's foreign intelligence gathering agency. This includes overall increased security, extensive computer suites, technical areas, bomb blast protection, emergency back-up systems and protection against electronic eavesdropping. While the details and cost of construction have been released, about ten years after the original [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] (NAO) report was written, some of the service's special requirements remain classified. The NAO report ''Thames House and Vauxhall Cross'' has certain details omitted, describing in detail the cost and problems of certain modifications, but not what these are.<ref name=nao/> Rob Humphrey's ''London: The Rough Guide'' suggests one of these omitted modifications is [[Tunnels underneath the River Thames|a tunnel beneath the Thames]] to [[Whitehall]]. The NAO put the final cost at \u00a3135.05 million for site purchase and the basic building, or \u00a3152.6 million including the service's special requirements.<ref name=nao/>\n\nThe setting of the SIS offices was featured in the [[James Bond filmography|James Bond films]] ''[[GoldenEye]]'', ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'', ''[[Die Another Day]]'', ''[[Skyfall]]'' and ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]''. SIS allowed filming of the building itself for the first time in ''The World is Not Enough'' for the pre-credits sequence, where a bomb hidden in a briefcase full of money is detonated inside the building. A ''Daily Telegraph'' article said that the British government opposed the filming, but this was denied by a [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] spokesperson. In ''Skyfall'' the building is once again attacked by an explosion, this time by a cyber attack turning on a gas line and igniting the fumes, after which SIS operations are moved to a secret underground facility.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bond is backed... by the government|work=The Guardian|date=27 April 1999|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/Column/0,4541,45454,00.html|accessdate=29 December 2007|location=London}}</ref> In ''Spectre'', the evil head of crime organisation [[SPECTRE]], [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]], traps [[00 Agent|Agent 007]] [[James Bond]] alongside the film's [[Bond girl]] Dr. Madeleine Swann inside the remains of the building.

The bureau was split into naval and army sections which, over time, specialised in foreign espionage and internal counter-espionage activities, respectively. This specialisation was because the Admiralty wanted to know the maritime strength of the [[Imperial German Navy]]. This specialisation was formalised before 1914.

In July 2005, the British and Polish governments jointly produced a two-tome study of bilateral intelligence cooperation in the War, which revealed information that had until then been officially secret. The ''Report of the Anglo-Polish Historical Committee'' was written by leading historians and experts who had been granted unprecedented access to British intelligence archives, and concluded that 48 percent of all reports received by British secret services from continental Europe in 1939\u201345 had come from Polish sources.<ref name=\"google1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EJ5vIyDBpLcC&pg=PA234 |title=The Eagle Unbowed: Poland and the Poles in the Second World War |first=Halik |last=Kochanski |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-0674068148|pages=234-235}}</ref> This was facilitated by the fact that occupied Poland had a tradition of insurgency organizations passed down through generations, with networks in emigre Polish communities in Germany and France; a major part of Polish resistance activity was clandestine and involved cellular intelligence networks; while Nazi Germany used Poles as forced labourers across the continent, putting them in a unique position to spy on the enemy.

[[Armia Krajowa and V-1 and V-2|Polish-sourced reporting on German secret weapons]] began in 1941, and [[Operation Most III|Operation Wildhorn]] enabled a British special operations flight to airlift a [[V-2 Rocket]] that had been captured by the Polish resistance.

The Soviet Bloc ceased to swallow the lion's share of operational priorities, although the stability and intentions of a weakened but still nuclear-capable Federal Russia constituted a significant concern. Instead, functional rather than geographical intelligence requirements came to the fore such as [[counter-proliferation]] (via the agency's Production and Targeting, Counter-Proliferation Section) which had been a sphere of activity since the discovery of Pakistani physics students studying nuclear-weapons related subjects in 1974; counter-terrorism (via two joint sections run in collaboration with the Security Service, one for [[Irish republicanism]] and one for international terrorism); counter-narcotics and serious crime (originally set up under the [[Western Hemisphere]] controllerate in 1989); and a 'global issues' section looking at matters such as the environment and other public welfare issues. In the mid-1990s these were consolidated into a new post of Controller, Global and Functional.<ref>Davies (2004), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TTW2h5GHlWkC&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=Controller,+Global+and+Functional+mi6&source=bl&ots=vzKfe_R9rL&sig=T0y1Zqyx8plT752vCpx6t3kRdI8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj6u6Pvz-beAhWrBcAKHWIxBf0Q6AEwCnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Controller%2C%20Global%20and%20Functional%20mi6&f=false p. 354]</ref>\n\nDuring the transition, then-C Sir [[Colin McColl]] embraced a new, albeit limited, policy of openness towards the press and public, with 'public affairs' falling into the brief of Director, Counter-Intelligence and Security (renamed Director, Security and Public Affairs). McColl's policies were part and parcel with a wider 'open government initiative' developed from 1993 by the government of [[John Major]]. As part of this, SIS operations, and those of the national signals intelligence agency, [[GCHQ]], were placed on a statutory footing through the 1994 [[Intelligence Services Act 1994|Intelligence Services Act]]. Although the Act provided procedures for authorisations and warrants, this essentially enshrined mechanisms that had been in place at least since 1953 (for authorisations) and 1985 (under the [[Interception of Communications Act 1985|Interception of Communications Act]], for warrants). Under this Act, since 1994, SIS and GCHQ activities have been subject to scrutiny by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament's]] [[Intelligence and Security Committee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/13/pdfs/ukpga_19940013_en.pdf|title=Intelligence Services Act 1994|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring the mid-1990s the British intelligence community was subjected to a comprehensive costing review by the government. As part of broader defence cut-backs SIS had its resources cut back twenty-five percent across the board and senior management was reduced by forty percent. As a consequence of these cuts, the Requirements division (formerly the Circulating Sections of the 1921 Arrangement) were deprived of any representation on the board of directors. At the same time, the Middle East and Africa controllerates were pared back and amalgamated. According to the findings of Lord Butler of Brockwell's ''Review of Weapons of Mass Destruction'', the reduction of operational capabilities in the Middle East and of the Requirements division's ability to challenge the quality of the information the Middle East Controllerate was providing weakened the [[Joint Intelligence Committee (United Kingdom)|Joint Intelligence Committee]]'s estimates of [[Iraq]]'s non-conventional weapons programmes. These weaknesses were major contributors to the UK's erroneous assessments of Iraq's 'weapons of mass destruction' prior to the 2003 invasion of that country.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Politics/documents/2004/07/14/butler.pdf|title=Review of Intelligence on weapons of mass destruction|publisher=Committee led by Lord Butler|accessdate=1 July 2012|location=London}}</ref>\n\nOn one occasion in 1998, MI6 believed it might be able to obtain 'actionable intelligence' which could help the CIA capture [[Osama Bin Laden]], the leader of [[Al Qaeda]]. But given that this might result in his being transferred or rendered to the United States, MI6 decided it had to ask for ministerial approval before passing the intelligence on (in case he faced the death penalty or mistreatment). This was approved by a minister 'provided the CIA gave assurances regarding humane treatment'. In the end, not enough intelligence came through to make it worthwhile going ahead.<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.313</ref>\n\nIn 2001, it became clear that working with [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] and his [[Northern Alliance|forces]] was the best option for going after Bin Laden; the priority for MI6 was developing intelligence coverage. The first real sources were being established, although no one penetrated the upper tier of the Al Qaeda leadership itself. As the year progressed, plans were drawn up and slowly worked their way up to the [[White House]] on 4 September 2001-which involved increasing dramatically support for Massoud.

He reported back to London that there were aspects of the way the detainee had been handled by the US military before the interview that did not appear consistent with the [[Geneva Conventions]]. Two days after the interview, he was sent instructions, copied to all MI5 and MI6 officers in Afghanistan, about how to deal with concerns over mistreatment, referring to signs of abuse: \"Given that they are not within our custody or control, the law does not require you to intervene to protect this.\" It went on to say that the Americans had to understand that the UK did not condone such mistreatment and that a complaint should be made to a senior US official if there was any coercion by the US in conjunction with an MI6 interview.<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.339</ref>\n\nIn the run-up to the [[invasion of Iraq in 2003]], it is alleged, although not confirmed, that some SIS members conducted [[Operation Mass Appeal]] which was a campaign to plant stories about Iraq's WMDs in the media.

In the months after the invasion, they also began gathering political intelligence; predicting what would happen in post-Baathist Iraq. MI6 personnel in the country never exceeded 50; in early 2004, apart from supporting [[Task Force 88 (anti-terrorist unit)#Task Force Black/Knight|Task Force Black]] in hunting down former senior Ba'athist party members, MI6 also made an effort to target \"transnational terrorism\"/jihadist networks that led to the SAS carrying out Operation Aston in February 2004: They conducted a raid on a house in Baghdad that was part of a \"jihadist pipeline\" that ran from Iran to Iraq that US and UK intelligence agencies were tracking suspects on \u2013 the raid captured members of [[Lashkar-e-Taiba|Pakistan based terrorist group]].<ref name=\"urban\">Urban, Mark, ''Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq '', St. Martin's Griffin, 2012 {{ISBN|1250006961}} {{ISBN|978-1250006967}}, pp.10\u201311, p.13, p.15, p.18\u201319, p.50-55, p.56-57, p.67-68, p.95-96, p.101, p.249</ref>\n\nShortly before the [[Second Battle of Fallujah]], MI6 personnel visited [[Joint Special Operations Command|JSOC]]s TSF (Temporary Screening Facility) at [[Balad Air Base]] to question a suspected insurgent. Afterwards they raised concerns about the poor detention conditions there. As a result the British government informed JSOC in Iraq that prisoners captured by British special forces would only be turned over to JSOC if there was an undertaking not to send them to Balad. In Spring 2005, the SAS detachment operating in Basra and southern Iraq, known as Operation Hathor, escorted MI6 case officers into Basra so they could meet their sources and handlers. MI6 provided information that enabled the detachment to carry out surveillance operations. MI6 were also involved in resolving the [[Basra prison incident]]; the SIS played a central role in the British withdrawal from Basra in 2007.<ref name=\"urban\"/>\n\nIn Afghanistan, MI6 worked closely with the military, delivering tactical information and working in small cells alongside Special Forces, surveillance teams, and GCHQ to track individuals from the Taliban and Al Qaeda.<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.399-400</ref>\n\nThe first MI6 knew of the US carrying out the [[Death of Osama bin Laden#Operation Neptune Spear|mission that killed Osama Bin Laden]] on 2 May 2011 was after it happened, when its chief called his American counterpart for an explanation.<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.351</ref> In July 2011 it was reported that SIS had closed several of its stations, particularly in Iraq, where it had several outposts in the south of the country in the region of Basra.

A third individual was branded a British spy in the Balkans and left the office of the High Representative in Bosnia, whilst a further two British intelligence officers working in [[Zagreb]], remained in place despite their cover being blown in the local press. The exposure of the agents across the three capitals has markedly undermined the British intelligence operations in the area, including SIS efforts to capture The Hague's most wanted men, which riled many local intelligence agencies in the Balkans, some of which are suspected of continuing ties to alleged war criminals. They were riled due to MI6 operating \"not so much a spy network as a network of influence within Balkan security services and the media,\" said the director of the International Crisis Group in Serbia and Bosnia, which caused some of them to be \"upset\". In Serbia, the SIS station chief was forced to leave his post in August 2004 after a campaign against him led by country's DB intelligence agency, where his work investigating the [[Assassination of Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107|2003 assassination]] of the reformist prime minister [[Zoran Djindjic]] won him few friends.<ref name=\"MI6 spies exposed by Balkan rivals\"/>\n\nOn 15 November 2006, SIS allowed an interview with current operations officers for the first time.

It was tasked by the [[Director Special Forces]] to support MI6's operations (akin to the CIA's [[Special Activities Center|SAC]] \u2013 a covert paramilitary unit for SIS). It was not a formal squadron within the establishment of any individual UK Special Forces unit, but at the disposal of both the Director Special Forces and the SIS; previously, SIS relied primarily on contractor personnel. The Squadron carried out missions that required 'maximum discretion' in places that were 'off the radar or considered dangerous'; the Squadron's members often operated in plain clothes, with the full range of national support, such as false identities at its disposal. In early March 2011, during the Libyan Civil War, a covert operation in Libya involving E Squadron went wrong: The aim of the mission was to cement SIS's contacts with the rebels by flying in two SIS agents in a [[Chinook]] helicopter to meet a Libyan Intermediary in a town near Benghazi, who had promised to fix them up a meeting with the [[National Transitional Council|NTC]]. A team consisting of six E Squadron members (all from the SAS) and two SIS officers were flown into Libya by an RAF Special Forces Flight Chinook; the Squadron's members were carrying bags containing arms, ammunition, explosives, computers, maps and passports from at least four nationalities. Despite technical backup, the team landed in Libya without any prior agreement with the rebel leadership, and the plan failed as soon as the team landed. The locals became suspicious they were foreign mercenaries or spies and the team was detained by rebel forces and taken to a military base in Benghazi. They were then hauled before a senior rebel leader; the team told him that they were in the country to determine the rebels' needs and to offer assistance, but the discovery of British troops on the ground enraged the rebels who were fearful that Gaddafi would use such evidence to destroy the credibility of the NTC.

In a rare speech on the intelligence agencies, he praised the key role played by SIS and GCHQ in bringing Gaddafi's 42-year dictatorship to an end, describing them as 'vital assets' with a 'fundamental and indispensable role' in keeping the nation safe. 'They worked to identify key political figures, develop contacts with the emerging opposition and provide political and military intelligence. 'Most importantly, they saved lives,' he said. The speech follows criticism that SIS had been too close to the Libyan regime and was involved in the extraordinary rendition of anti-Gaddafi activists. Mr Hague also defended controversial proposals for secrecy in civil courts in cases involving intelligence material.<ref name=\"Radnedge\"/>\n\nThe ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' reported in November 2011 that SIS helped capture [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]]. The top-secret mission, dubbed Operation X to disguise its purpose, used modern electronic intelligence (ELINT) technologies to bug him along with his friends and family. Gaddafi had been hiding out in the desert for a month but the breakthrough came when he made two phone calls, one after the other, to say he was safe. It allowed the joint British and French bugging operation to pinpoint his location. SIS agents using the \u00a325&nbsp;million top-secret equipment closed in on him before calling in the Libyan snatch squad to apprehend him.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sherwood |first=Deborah |url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/view/221616/Gaddafi-s-son-snared-by-MI6/ |title=Gaddafi's son snared by MI6 |work=Daily Star |date=20 November 2011 |accessdate=28 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2013 [[Channel Four]] News reported on evidence of SIS spying on opponents of the Gaddafi regime and handing the information to the regime in Libya.

At the same time, MI5 was seeking alternative accommodation and co-location of the two services was studied.

Splitting H<sub>2</sub> into 2H\u2022, for example, requires a \u0394''H''{{px1}}\u00b0 of +435 k[[Joule per mole|J'''\u00b7'''mol{{smallsup|-1}}]], while splitting Cl<sub>2</sub> into two Cl\u2022 requires a \u0394''H''{{px1}}\u00b0 of +243 kJ'''\u00b7'''mol{{smallsup|-1}}.  For weak bonds, homolysis can be induced thermally.  Strong bonds require high energy photons or even flames to induce homolysis.\n\n===Diradicals===\n[[Diradical]]s are molecules containing two radical centers. [[Dioxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) is the premier example of a stable diradical. [[Singlet oxygen]], the lowest-energy non-radical state of dioxygen, is less stable than the diradical due to [[Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity]]. The relative stability of the oxygen diradical is primarily due to the [[Quantum chemistry|spin-forbidden]] nature of the triplet-singlet transition required for it to grab electrons, i.e., \"'''oxidize\".''' The diradical state of oxygen also results in its paramagnetic character, which is demonstrated by its attraction to an external magnet.<ref>However, [[paramagnetism]] does not necessarily imply radical character.</ref> Diradicals can also occur in [[Transition metal oxo complex|metal-oxo complexes]], lending themselves for studies of [[spin forbidden reactions]] in [[transition metal]] chemistry.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Linde|first1=C.|last2=\u00c5kermark|first2=B.|last3=Norrby|first3=P.-O.|last4=Svensson|first4=M.|date=1999|title=Timing is Critical: Effect of Spin Changes on the Diastereoselectivity in Mn(Salen)-Catalyzed Epoxidation|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=121|issue=21|pages=5083\u201384|doi=10.1021/ja9809915}}</ref> [[Carbene]]s in their triplet state can be viewed as diradicals centred on the same atom, while these are usually highly reactive [[persistent carbene]]s are known, with N-heterocyclic carbenes being the most common example.\n\nTriplet [[carbene]]s and [[nitrene]]s are diradicals.  Their chemical properties are distinct from the properties of their singlet analogues.\n\n==Occurrence of radicals==\n===Combustion===\n[[File:Spectrum of blue flame.png|thumb|right|350px|Spectrum of the blue flame from a [[butane]] torch showing excited molecular radical band emission and [[Swan bands]]]]\n{{main|Combustion#Reaction mechanism}}\nA familiar radical reaction is [[combustion]]. The [[oxygen]] molecule is a stable [[diradical]], best represented by \u00b7O-O\u00b7. Because [[Spin (physics)|spins]] of the electrons are parallel, this molecule is stable.  While the [[ground state]] of oxygen is this unreactive spin-unpaired ([[Triplet oxygen|triplet]]) diradical, an extremely reactive spin-paired ([[Singlet oxygen|singlet]]) state is available. For combustion to occur, the [[energy barrier]] between these must be overcome. This barrier can be overcome by heat, requiring high temperatures.  The triplet-singlet transition is also \"[[Forbidden mechanism|forbidden]]\".  This presents an additional barrier to the reaction.  It also means molecular oxygen is relatively unreactive at room temperature except in the presence of a catalytic heavy atom such as iron or copper.\n\nCombustion consists of various radical chain reactions that the singlet radical can initiate. The [[flammability]] of a given material strongly depends on the concentration of radicals that must be obtained before initiation and propagation reactions dominate leading to [[combustion]] of the material. Once the combustible material has been consumed, termination reactions again dominate and the flame dies out.  As indicated,  promotion of propagation or termination reactions alters flammability.  For example, because lead itself deactivates radicals in the gasoline-air mixture, [[tetraethyl lead]] was once commonly added to gasoline. This prevents the combustion from initiating in an uncontrolled manner or in unburnt residues ([[engine knocking]]) or premature ignition ([[preignition]]).\n\nWhen a hydrocarbon is burned, a large number of different oxygen radicals are involved. Initially, [[hydroperoxyl|hydroperoxyl radical]] (HOO\u00b7) are formed. These then react further to give [[organic hydroperoxide]]s that break up into [[hydroxyl radical]]s (HO\u00b7).\n\n===Polymerization===\nMany [[polymerization]] reactions are initiated by radicals. Polymerization involves an initial radical adding to non-radical (usually an alkene) to give new radicals.  This process is the basis of the [[radical chain reaction]]. The art of polymerization entails the method by which the initiating radical is introduced.  For example, [[methyl methacrylate]] (MMA) can be polymerized to produce [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)]] (PMMA - Plexiglas or Perspex) via a repeating series of [[Free-radical addition|radical addition]] steps:  \n:[[image:PMMA-Wachstum.svg|800px|center|thumb|Radical intermediates in the formation of polymethacrylate (plexiglas or perspex).]]\n\nNewer radical polymerization methods are known as [[living polymerization|living radical polymerization]].  Variants include reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer ([[RAFT (chemistry)|RAFT]]) and atom transfer radical polymerization ([[ATRP (chemistry)|ATRP]]).\n\nBeing a prevalent radical, O<sub>2</sub> reacts with many organic compounds to generate radicals together with the [[hydroperoxide]] radical. [[Drying oil]]s and alkyd paints harden due to radical crosslinking initiated by oxygen from the atmosphere.\n\n===Atmospheric radicals===\n{{See also|Oxygen cycle|Ozone-oxygen cycle}}\nThe most common radical in the lower atmosphere is molecular dioxygen. [[Photodissociation]] of source molecules produces other radicals. In the lower atmosphere, important radical are produced by the photodissociation of [[nitrogen dioxide]] to an oxygen atom and [[nitric oxide]] (see {{EquationNote|eq. 1. 1}} below), which plays a key role in [[Photochemical smog|smog]] formation\u2014and the photodissociation of ozone to give the excited oxygen atom O(1D) (see {{EquationNote|eq. 1. 2}} below). The net and return reactions are also shown ({{EquationNote|eq. 1. 3}} and {{EquationNote|eq. 1. 4}}, respectively).\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>NO2 ->[h \\nu] NO + O</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 1. 1}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>O + O2 -> O3</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 1. 2}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>NO2 + O2 ->[h \\nu] NO + O3</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 1. 3}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>NO + O3 -> NO2 + O2</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 1. 4}}}}\nIn the upper atmosphere, the photodissociation of normally unreactive [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFCs) by solar [[ultraviolet radiation]] is an important source of radicals (see eq. 1 below). These reactions give the [[chlorine]] radical, Cl\u2022, which catalyzes the conversion of [[ozone]] to O<sub>2</sub>, thus facilitating [[ozone depletion]] ({{EquationNote|eq. 2. 2}}\u2013{{EquationNote|eq. 2. 4}} below).\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>CFCS ->[h \\nu] Cl.</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 1}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>Cl. + O3 -> ClO. + O2</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 2}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>O3 ->[h \\nu] O + O2</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 3}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>O + ClO. -> Cl. + O2</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 4}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>2O3 ->[h \\nu] 3O2</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 5}}}}\nSuch reactions cause the depletion of the [[ozone layer]], especially since the chlorine radical is free to engage in another reaction chain; consequently, the use of chlorofluorocarbons as [[refrigerant]]s has been restricted.\n\n===In biology===\n{{See also|Dioxygen in biological reactions}}\n[[File:DeoxyadenosylRadical.png|thumb|Structure of the [[deoxyadenosyl radical]], a common biosynthetic intermediate.<ref>{{cite journal|authors=Broderick, J.B.; Duffus, B.R.; Duschene, K.S.; Shepard, E.M. |title=Radical S-Adenosylmethionine Enzymes|journal=Chemical Reviews|year=2014|volume=114|issue=8|pages=4229\u2013317|doi= 10.1021/cr4004709|pmid=24476342|pmc=4002137}}</ref>]]\n[[Image:Lignin structure.svg|thumb|400px|An approximate structure of lignin, which constitutes about 30% of plant matter.

Similarly, the process of mito[[hormesis]] suggests that repeated exposure to radicals may extend life span.\n\nBecause radicals are necessary for life, the body has a number of mechanisms to minimize radical-induced damage and to repair damage that occurs, such as the [[enzyme]]s [[superoxide dismutase]], [[catalase]], [[glutathione peroxidase]] and [[glutathione reductase]]. In addition, [[antioxidant]]s play a key role in these defense mechanisms. These are often the three vitamins, [[vitamin A]], [[vitamin C]] and [[vitamin E]] and [[polyphenol antioxidant]]s. Furthermore, there is good evidence indicating that [[bilirubin]] and [[uric acid]] can act as antioxidants to help neutralize certain radicals. Bilirubin comes from the breakdown of [[red blood cell]]s' contents, while uric acid is a breakdown product of [[purine]]s. Too much bilirubin, though, can lead to [[jaundice]], which could eventually damage the central nervous system, while too much uric acid causes [[gout]].<ref>An overview of the role of radicals in biology and of the use of electron spin resonance in their detection may be found in {{cite book|author=Rhodes C.J.|title=Toxicology of the Human Environment \u2013 the critical role of free radicals|publisher=Taylor and Francis|place= London|year= 2000|isbn= 978-0-7484-0916-7}}</ref>\n\n===Reactive oxygen species===\n[[Reactive oxygen species]] or ROS are species such as [[superoxide]], [[hydrogen peroxide]], and [[hydroxyl radical]], commonly associated with cell damage.

The qualifier \"free\" was then needed to specify the unbound case.  Following recent nomenclature revisions, a part of a larger molecule is now called a [[functional group]] or [[substituent]], and \"radical\" now implies \"free\".  However, the old nomenclature may still appear in some books.\n\nThe term radical was already in use when the now obsolete [[radical theory]] was developed. [[Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau]] introduced the phrase \"radical\" in 1785 and the phrase was employed by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] in 1789 in his [[Trait\u00e9 \u00c9l\u00e9mentaire de Chimie]]. A radical was then identified as the root base of certain acids (the Latin word \"radix\" meaning \"root\"). Historically, the term ''radical'' in [[radical theory]] was also used for bound parts of the molecule, especially when they remain unchanged in reactions. These are now called [[functional group]]s. For example, [[methanol|methyl alcohol]] was described as consisting of a methyl \"radical\" and a hydroxyl \"radical\". Neither are radicals in the modern chemical sense, as they are permanently bound to each other, and have no unpaired, reactive electrons; however, they can be observed as radicals in [[mass spectrometry]] when broken apart by irradiation with energetic electrons.\n\nIn a modern context the first [[organic compound|organic]] (carbon\u2013containing) radical identified was [[triphenylmethyl radical]], (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>C\u2022.  This species was discovered by [[Moses Gomberg]] in 1900. In 1933 [[Morris S. Kharasch]] and [[Frank R. Mayo|Frank Mayo]] proposed that free radicals were responsible for [[anti-Markovnikov addition]] of [[hydrogen bromide]] to [[allyl bromide]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja01333a041 | volume=55 | title=The Peroxide Effect in the Addition of Reagents to Unsaturated Compounds.

However, in fields including [[spectroscopy]], [[chemical reaction]], and [[astrochemistry]], the definition is slightly different. [[Gerhard Herzberg]], who won the Nobel prize for his research into the electron structure and geometry of radicals, suggested a looser definition of free radicals: \"any transient (chemically unstable) species (atom, molecule, or ion)\".<ref>G. Herzberg (1971), \"The spectra and structures of simple free radicals\", {{ISBN|0-486-65821-X}}.</ref> The main point of his suggestion is that there are many chemically unstable molecules that have zero spin, such as C<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub> and so on. This definition is more convenient for discussions of transient chemical processes and astrochemistry; therefore researchers in these fields prefer to use this loose definition.<ref>[http://www.free-radicals-symposium-05.ch/index2.html 28th International Symposium on Free Radicals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716014949/http://www.free-radicals-symposium-05.ch/index2.html |date=2007-07-16 }}.</ref>\n\n==Diagnostics==\nRadicals typically exhibit [[paramagnetism]].

This property reflects a weakened bond to hydrogen, usually O-H but sometimes N-H or C-H.  This behavior is important because these H<sup>.</sup> donors serve as antioxidants in biology and in commerce.  Illustrative is [[tocopherol|\u03b1-tocopherol]] ([[vitamin E]]). The tocopherol radical itself is insufficiently stable for isolation, but the parent molecule is a highly effective H-atom donor. The C-H bond is weakened in triphenylmethyl (trityl) derivatives.  \n[[image:2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl.svg|thumb|right 220 px|[[TEMPO|2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl]] is an example of a robust organic radical.]]\n\n===Stability of inorganic radicals===\nThe inorganic compound [[nitric oxide]] (NO) is a stable radical.

The homolytic [[Bond dissociation energy|bond dissociation energies]], usually abbreviated as \"\u0394''H''{{px1}}\u00b0\" are a measure of bond strength. Splitting H<sub>2</sub> into 2H\u2022, for example, requires a \u0394''H''{{px1}}\u00b0 of +435 k[[Joule per mole|J'''\u00b7'''mol{{smallsup|-1}}]], while splitting Cl<sub>2</sub> into two Cl\u2022 requires a \u0394''H''{{px1}}\u00b0 of +243 kJ'''\u00b7'''mol{{smallsup|-1}}.  For weak bonds, homolysis can be induced thermally.  Strong bonds require high energy photons or even flames to induce homolysis.\n\n===Diradicals===\n[[Diradical]]s are molecules containing two radical centers. [[Dioxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) is the premier example of a stable diradical. [[Singlet oxygen]], the lowest-energy non-radical state of dioxygen, is less stable than the diradical due to [[Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity]]. The relative stability of the oxygen diradical is primarily due to the [[Quantum chemistry|spin-forbidden]] nature of the triplet-singlet transition required for it to grab electrons, i.e., \"'''oxidize\".''' The diradical state of oxygen also results in its paramagnetic character, which is demonstrated by its attraction to an external magnet.<ref>However, [[paramagnetism]] does not necessarily imply radical character.</ref> Diradicals can also occur in [[Transition metal oxo complex|metal-oxo complexes]], lending themselves for studies of [[spin forbidden reactions]] in [[transition metal]] chemistry.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Linde|first1=C.|last2=\u00c5kermark|first2=B.|last3=Norrby|first3=P.-O.|last4=Svensson|first4=M.|date=1999|title=Timing is Critical: Effect of Spin Changes on the Diastereoselectivity in Mn(Salen)-Catalyzed Epoxidation|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=121|issue=21|pages=5083\u201384|doi=10.1021/ja9809915}}</ref> [[Carbene]]s in their triplet state can be viewed as diradicals centred on the same atom, while these are usually highly reactive [[persistent carbene]]s are known, with N-heterocyclic carbenes being the most common example.\n\nTriplet [[carbene]]s and [[nitrene]]s are diradicals.  Their chemical properties are distinct from the properties of their singlet analogues.\n\n==Occurrence of radicals==\n===Combustion===\n[[File:Spectrum of blue flame.png|thumb|right|350px|Spectrum of the blue flame from a [[butane]] torch showing excited molecular radical band emission and [[Swan bands]]]]\n{{main|Combustion#Reaction mechanism}}\nA familiar radical reaction is [[combustion]]. The [[oxygen]] molecule is a stable [[diradical]], best represented by \u00b7O-O\u00b7. Because [[Spin (physics)|spins]] of the electrons are parallel, this molecule is stable.  While the [[ground state]] of oxygen is this unreactive spin-unpaired ([[Triplet oxygen|triplet]]) diradical, an extremely reactive spin-paired ([[Singlet oxygen|singlet]]) state is available. For combustion to occur, the [[energy barrier]] between these must be overcome. This barrier can be overcome by heat, requiring high temperatures.  The triplet-singlet transition is also \"[[Forbidden mechanism|forbidden]]\".  This presents an additional barrier to the reaction.  It also means molecular oxygen is relatively unreactive at room temperature except in the presence of a catalytic heavy atom such as iron or copper.\n\nCombustion consists of various radical chain reactions that the singlet radical can initiate. The [[flammability]] of a given material strongly depends on the concentration of radicals that must be obtained before initiation and propagation reactions dominate leading to [[combustion]] of the material. Once the combustible material has been consumed, termination reactions again dominate and the flame dies out.  As indicated,  promotion of propagation or termination reactions alters flammability.  For example, because lead itself deactivates radicals in the gasoline-air mixture, [[tetraethyl lead]] was once commonly added to gasoline. This prevents the combustion from initiating in an uncontrolled manner or in unburnt residues ([[engine knocking]]) or premature ignition ([[preignition]]).\n\nWhen a hydrocarbon is burned, a large number of different oxygen radicals are involved. Initially, [[hydroperoxyl|hydroperoxyl radical]] (HOO\u00b7) are formed. These then react further to give [[organic hydroperoxide]]s that break up into [[hydroxyl radical]]s (HO\u00b7).\n\n===Polymerization===\nMany [[polymerization]] reactions are initiated by radicals. Polymerization involves an initial radical adding to non-radical (usually an alkene) to give new radicals.  This process is the basis of the [[radical chain reaction]]. The art of polymerization entails the method by which the initiating radical is introduced.  For example, [[methyl methacrylate]] (MMA) can be polymerized to produce [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)]] (PMMA - Plexiglas or Perspex) via a repeating series of [[Free-radical addition|radical addition]] steps:  \n:[[image:PMMA-Wachstum.svg|800px|center|thumb|Radical intermediates in the formation of polymethacrylate (plexiglas or perspex).]]\n\nNewer radical polymerization methods are known as [[living polymerization|living radical polymerization]].  Variants include reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer ([[RAFT (chemistry)|RAFT]]) and atom transfer radical polymerization ([[ATRP (chemistry)|ATRP]]).\n\nBeing a prevalent radical, O<sub>2</sub> reacts with many organic compounds to generate radicals together with the [[hydroperoxide]] radical. [[Drying oil]]s and alkyd paints harden due to radical crosslinking initiated by oxygen from the atmosphere.\n\n===Atmospheric radicals===\n{{See also|Oxygen cycle|Ozone-oxygen cycle}}\nThe most common radical in the lower atmosphere is molecular dioxygen. [[Photodissociation]] of source molecules produces other radicals. In the lower atmosphere, important radical are produced by the photodissociation of [[nitrogen dioxide]] to an oxygen atom and [[nitric oxide]] (see {{EquationNote|eq. 1. 1}} below), which plays a key role in [[Photochemical smog|smog]] formation\u2014and the photodissociation of ozone to give the excited oxygen atom O(1D) (see {{EquationNote|eq. 1. 2}} below). The net and return reactions are also shown ({{EquationNote|eq. 1. 3}} and {{EquationNote|eq. 1. 4}}, respectively).\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>NO2 ->[h \\nu] NO + O</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 1. 1}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>O + O2 -> O3</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 1. 2}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>NO2 + O2 ->[h \\nu] NO + O3</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 1. 3}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>NO + O3 -> NO2 + O2</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 1. 4}}}}\nIn the upper atmosphere, the photodissociation of normally unreactive [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFCs) by solar [[ultraviolet radiation]] is an important source of radicals (see eq. 1 below). These reactions give the [[chlorine]] radical, Cl\u2022, which catalyzes the conversion of [[ozone]] to O<sub>2</sub>, thus facilitating [[ozone depletion]] ({{EquationNote|eq. 2. 2}}\u2013{{EquationNote|eq. 2. 4}} below).\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>CFCS ->[h \\nu] Cl.</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 1}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>Cl. + O3 -> ClO. + O2</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 2}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>O3 ->[h \\nu] O + O2</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 3}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>O + ClO. -> Cl. + O2</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 4}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>2O3 ->[h \\nu] 3O2</chem>|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 5}}}}\nSuch reactions cause the depletion of the [[ozone layer]], especially since the chlorine radical is free to engage in another reaction chain; consequently, the use of chlorofluorocarbons as [[refrigerant]]s has been restricted.\n\n===In biology===\n{{See also|Dioxygen in biological reactions}}\n[[File:DeoxyadenosylRadical.png|thumb|Structure of the [[deoxyadenosyl radical]], a common biosynthetic intermediate.<ref>{{cite journal|authors=Broderick, J.B.; Duffus, B.R.; Duschene, K.S.; Shepard, E.M. |title=Radical S-Adenosylmethionine Enzymes|journal=Chemical Reviews|year=2014|volume=114|issue=8|pages=4229\u2013317|doi= 10.1021/cr4004709|pmid=24476342|pmc=4002137}}</ref>]]\n[[Image:Lignin structure.svg|thumb|400px|An approximate structure of lignin, which constitutes about 30% of plant matter.

Similarly, the process of mito[[hormesis]] suggests that repeated exposure to radicals may extend life span.\n\nBecause radicals are necessary for life, the body has a number of mechanisms to minimize radical-induced damage and to repair damage that occurs, such as the [[enzyme]]s [[superoxide dismutase]], [[catalase]], [[glutathione peroxidase]] and [[glutathione reductase]]. In addition, [[antioxidant]]s play a key role in these defense mechanisms. These are often the three vitamins, [[vitamin A]], [[vitamin C]] and [[vitamin E]] and [[polyphenol antioxidant]]s. Furthermore, there is good evidence indicating that [[bilirubin]] and [[uric acid]] can act as antioxidants to help neutralize certain radicals. Bilirubin comes from the breakdown of [[red blood cell]]s' contents, while uric acid is a breakdown product of [[purine]]s. Too much bilirubin, though, can lead to [[jaundice]], which could eventually damage the central nervous system, while too much uric acid causes [[gout]].<ref>An overview of the role of radicals in biology and of the use of electron spin resonance in their detection may be found in {{cite book|author=Rhodes C.J.|title=Toxicology of the Human Environment \u2013 the critical role of free radicals|publisher=Taylor and Francis|place= London|year= 2000|isbn= 978-0-7484-0916-7}}</ref>\n\n===Reactive oxygen species===\n[[Reactive oxygen species]] or ROS are species such as [[superoxide]], [[hydrogen peroxide]], and [[hydroxyl radical]], commonly associated with cell damage.

The qualifier \"free\" was then needed to specify the unbound case.  Following recent nomenclature revisions, a part of a larger molecule is now called a [[functional group]] or [[substituent]], and \"radical\" now implies \"free\".  However, the old nomenclature may still appear in some books.\n\nThe term radical was already in use when the now obsolete [[radical theory]] was developed. [[Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau]] introduced the phrase \"radical\" in 1785 and the phrase was employed by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] in 1789 in his [[Trait\u00e9 \u00c9l\u00e9mentaire de Chimie]]. A radical was then identified as the root base of certain acids (the Latin word \"radix\" meaning \"root\"). Historically, the term ''radical'' in [[radical theory]] was also used for bound parts of the molecule, especially when they remain unchanged in reactions. These are now called [[functional group]]s. For example, [[methanol|methyl alcohol]] was described as consisting of a methyl \"radical\" and a hydroxyl \"radical\". Neither are radicals in the modern chemical sense, as they are permanently bound to each other, and have no unpaired, reactive electrons; however, they can be observed as radicals in [[mass spectrometry]] when broken apart by irradiation with energetic electrons.\n\nIn a modern context the first [[organic compound|organic]] (carbon\u2013containing) radical identified was [[triphenylmethyl radical]], (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>C\u2022.  This species was discovered by [[Moses Gomberg]] in 1900. In 1933 [[Morris S. Kharasch]] and [[Frank R. Mayo|Frank Mayo]] proposed that free radicals were responsible for [[anti-Markovnikov addition]] of [[hydrogen bromide]] to [[allyl bromide]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja01333a041 | volume=55 | title=The Peroxide Effect in the Addition of Reagents to Unsaturated Compounds.

However, in fields including [[spectroscopy]], [[chemical reaction]], and [[astrochemistry]], the definition is slightly different. [[Gerhard Herzberg]], who won the Nobel prize for his research into the electron structure and geometry of radicals, suggested a looser definition of free radicals: \"any transient (chemically unstable) species (atom, molecule, or ion)\".<ref>G. Herzberg (1971), \"The spectra and structures of simple free radicals\", {{ISBN|0-486-65821-X}}.</ref> The main point of his suggestion is that there are many chemically unstable molecules that have zero spin, such as C<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub> and so on. This definition is more convenient for discussions of transient chemical processes and astrochemistry; therefore researchers in these fields prefer to use this loose definition.<ref>[http://www.free-radicals-symposium-05.ch/index2.html 28th International Symposium on Free Radicals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716014949/http://www.free-radicals-symposium-05.ch/index2.html |date=2007-07-16 }}.</ref>\n\n==Diagnostics==\nRadicals typically exhibit [[paramagnetism]].

Firstly, there must be sufficient quantity of virus available to initiate infection. Cells at the site of infection must be accessible, in that they possess host factors that the virus can exploit for entry into the cell, and the host anti-viral defense systems must be ineffective or absent.<ref name =\"raca\"/><ref name=\"refMM\"/>\n\n===Implantation at point of entry===\nThe virus must implant at the entry portal of the body. Implantation is the earliest stage of pathogenesis. Implantation frequency is at its greatest where viruses directly contact living cells. Viruses usually implant on cells of respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin and genital tissues.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> Some viruses are capable of implanting in a fetus through infected germ cells at the time of [[fertilization]]. Implantation can also occur later in the pregnancy via the placenta, and also at birth.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Local replication and spread=== \nFollowing implantation, the virus hijacks the host cell machinery to undergo viral amplification. Here, the virus must modulate the host innate immune response to prevent its elimination by the body while facilitating its replication. Replicated virus from the initially infected cell then disperse to infect neighbouring susceptible cells, possibly with spread to different cell types like leukocytes. This results in a [[localized disease|localised infection]], in which the virus mainly spreads and infects adjacent cells to the site of entry.<ref name=\"refMM\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\">{{cite book |title=Molecular Pathology and the Dynamics of Disease |last=Mitchell |first=Maika G.  |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/C2016-0-04893-3 |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |isbn=978-0-12-814610-1|date=2010-04-16 }}</ref>  Otherwise, the virus can be released into extracellular fluids.\nExamples of localised infections include: common cold ([[rhinovirus]]), flu ([[Human parainfluenza viruses|parainfluenza]]), gastrointestinal infections ([[rotavirus]]) or skin infections ([[Human papillomavirus infection|papillomavirus]]).<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Dissemination and secondary replication=== \nIn other cases, the virus can cause [[systemic disease]] through a disseminated infection spread throughout the body. The predominant mode of viral dissemination occurs through the blood or [[lymphatic system]], some of which include viruses responsible for chickenpox ([[varicella zoster virus]]), smallpox ([[smallpox|variola]]), HIV ([[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]). A minority of viruses can disseminate via the nervous system.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/> Notably, the [[poliovirus]] can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, where it initially replicates in its site of entry, the small intestine and spread to regional [[lymph node]]s. Then, the virus disseminates via the bloodstream into different organs in the body (e.g. liver, spleen), followed by a secondary round of replication and dissemination into the central nervous system to damage [[motor neuron]]s.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> \n\n===Shedding and secondary transmission=== \nFinally, the viruses spread to sites where [[Viral shedding|shedding]] into the environment can occur. The [[respiratory]], [[alimentary]] and [[urogenital]] tracts and the blood are the most frequent sites of shedding in the form of bodily fluids, aerosols, skin, excrement. The virus would then go on to be transmitted to another person, and establish the infection cycle all over again.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" /><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\n\n==Factors affecting pathogenesis== \nThere are a few main overarching factors affecting viral diseases:\n*Virus tropism\n*Virus factors\n*Host factors\n\n===Molecular basis of virus tropism===\n'''Virus tropism''' refers to the virus\u2019 preferential site of replication in discrete cell types within an organ. In most cases, tropism is determined by the ability of the [[viral protein|viral surface proteins]] to fuse or bind to surface receptors of specific target cells to establish infection.  Thus, the binding specificity of viral surface proteins dictates tropism as well as the destruction of particular cell populations, and is therefore a major determinant of virus pathogenesis.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\nHowever, [[co-receptor]]s are sometimes required in addition to the binding of cellular receptors on host cells to viral proteins in order to establish infection. For instance, HIV-1 requires target cells to express co-receptors [[CCR5]] or [[CXCR4]], on top of the [[CD4]] receptor for productive viral attachment.<ref name=\"HIV\">  {{Cite journal | author=Shen, H., Yin, J., Leng, F. | title=HIV coreceptor tropism determination and mutational pattern identification | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume=6 | year=2016 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21280 }}  </ref> Interestingly, HIV-1 can undergo a [[HIV tropism|tropism switch]], where the virus [[Envelope glycoprotein GP120|glycoprotein gp120]] initially uses CCR5 (mainly on macrophages) as the primary co-receptor for entering the host cell. Subsequently, HIV-1 switches to bind to CXCR4 (mainly on [[T cell]]s) as the infection progresses, in doing so transitions the viral pathogenicity to a different stage.<ref name=\"HIV\"/><ref name =\"robbins\" />\n \nApart from cellular receptors, viral tropism can also governed by other intracellular factors, such as tissue-specific [[transcription factors]]. An example would be the [[JC polyomavirus]], in which its tropism is limited to [[glial cells]] since its [[enhancer]] is only active in glial cells,<ref name=\"baron\"/> and JC viral gene expression requires host transcription factors expressed exclusively in glial cells.<ref name =\"robbins\"> {{cite book |title =Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease |edition=9 |editor1=Kumar, Vinay |editor2=Abbas, Abul K. |editor3=Aster, Jon C. |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780323313094|date =2014 }} </ref>\n\nThe accessibility of host tissues and organs to the virus also regulates tropism. Accessibility is affected by physical barriers<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>, such as in enteroviruses, which replicate in the intestine since they are able to withstand bile, digestive enzymes and acidic environments.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n\n===Virus factors===\nViral genetics encoding viral factors will determine the degree of viral pathogenesis. This can be measured as [[virulence]], which can be used to compare the quantitative degree of pathology between related viruses. In other words, different virus strains possessing different virus factors can lead to different degrees of virulence, which in turn can be exploited to study the differences in pathogenesis of viral variants with different virulence.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\"/><ref name=gonzalez> {{Cite journal | author=Fuentes-Gonz\u00e1lez AM, Contreras-Paredes A, Manzo-Merino J, Lizano M | title=The modulation of apoptosis by oncogenic viruses | journal=[[Virology Journal]] | volume=10 | year=2013 | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-10-182 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>\n\nVirus factors are largely influenced by viral genetics, which is the virulence determinant of structural or non-structural proteins and [[non-coding DNA|non-coding sequences]]. For a virus to successfully infect and cause disease in the host, it has to encode specific virus factors in its genome to overcome the preventive effects of physical barriers, and modulate host inhibition of virus replication.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"principlesvirology\"/> In the case of poliovirus, all vaccine strains found in the oral [[polio vaccine]] contain [[attenuated vaccine|attenuating]] point mutations in the [[five prime untranslated region| 5' untranslated region]] (5' UTR). Conversely, the virulent strain responsible for causing smallpox does not contain these 5\u2019 UTR point mutations and thus display greater viral pathogenicity in hosts.<ref name=\"Nathanson\" /><ref name=\"utr\"> {{Cite journal | author=Guti\u00e9rrez AL | title=Attenuating Mutations in the Poliovirus 5\" Untranslated Region Alter Its Interaction with Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein | journal=[[Journal of Virology]] | volume=71 | year=1997 | pages=3826\u20133833 | url=https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/71/5/3826.full.pdf }}  </ref>\n\nVirus factors encoded in the genome often control the tropism, routes of virus entry, shedding and transmission. In polioviruses, the attenuating point mutations are thought to induce a replication and [[translation]] defect to reduce the virus\u2019 ability of cross-linking to host cells and replicate within the nervous system.<ref name=\"utr\"/>\n\nViruses have also developed a variety of [[immunomodulation]] mechanisms to subvert the host immune response. This tend to feature virus-encoded decoy receptors that target [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s produced as part of the host immune response, or homologues of host cytokines.<ref name=\"veterinary virology\"/><ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Felix, J., Savvides, S. | title=Mechanisms of immunomodulation by mammalian and viral decoy receptors: insights from structures | journal=[[Nature Reviews Immunology]] | volume=17 | year=2017 | pages=112-129 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/nri.2016.134 }}  </ref> As such, viruses capable of manipulating the host cell response to infection as an immune evasion strategy exhibit greater pathogenicity.\n\n===Host factors=== \nViral pathogenesis is also largely dependent on host factors. Several viral infections have displayed a variety of effects, ranging from [[asymptomatic]] to symptomatic or even critical infection, solely based of differing host factors alone.

The incubation period refers to the time taken for the onset of disease after first contact with the virus. The incubation period typically varies with the distance traversed by the virus to the target organ. Viruses that travel a short distance to reach their target organ have a short incubation period of one to three days. On the other hand, with generalized infections, the incubation period is longer, ranging from months to years, because of how long it takes the virus to move throughout the body and reach the target organs. Surprisingly, generalised infections by [[togaviruses]] have a short incubation period due to the direct entry of the virus into target cells through insect bites.<ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\n\nThere are several other factors that affect the incubation period. The mechanisms behind long incubation periods, months or years for example, are not completely understood yet.\n\n==Evolution of virulence==\nAs with all parasites, [[natural selection]] favours the survival of low-virulence virus strains.<ref name=\"baron\"/> Many relatively avirulent viruses in their natural host show increased virulence upon transfer to a new host species. When an [[emergent virus|emerging virus]] first invades a new host species, the hosts have little or no immunity against the virus and often suffer high [[Mortality rate|mortality]].  Hosts that survive do so because they possess a set of advantageous genes that are favourable to the [[selection pressure]], that prevents the host from dying due to infection of the novel pathogen.  These survivors then reproduce and pass on the favourable genes to their offspring while hosts that do not possess those genes are slowly eradicated by [[natural selection]], resulting in lower mortality rates in future generations.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\nOver time, a decrease in virulence in the predominant strain is usually observed. This is because there is usually little advantage for a pathogen to kill the host before dispersal to new hosts, so viruses may evolve naturally to become less virulent to prolong survival in infected hosts to boost transmission. Likewise, the host will evolve to develop genetic resistance against the virus over time.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Benjamin M Bolker, Dharmini Shah | title=Transient virulence of emerging pathogens | journal=[[Journal of the Royal Society Interface]] | volume=7 | year=2010 | pages=811\u2013822 | DOI=10.1098/rsif.2009.0384}}  </ref>\n\nA paradigm of the evolution of virulence in emerging virus is the case of [[myxomatosis]] in rabbits.

Firstly, there must be sufficient quantity of virus available to initiate infection. Cells at the site of infection must be accessible, in that they possess host factors that the virus can exploit for entry into the cell, and the host anti-viral defense systems must be ineffective or absent.<ref name =\"raca\"/><ref name=\"refMM\"/>\n\n===Implantation at point of entry===\nThe virus must implant at the entry portal of the body. Implantation is the earliest stage of pathogenesis. Implantation frequency is at its greatest where viruses directly contact living cells. Viruses usually implant on cells of respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin and genital tissues.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> Some viruses are capable of implanting in a fetus through infected germ cells at the time of [[fertilization]]. Implantation can also occur later in the pregnancy via the placenta, and also at birth.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Local replication and spread=== \nFollowing implantation, the virus hijacks the host cell machinery to undergo viral amplification. Here, the virus must modulate the host innate immune response to prevent its elimination by the body while facilitating its replication. Replicated virus from the initially infected cell then disperse to infect neighbouring susceptible cells, possibly with spread to different cell types like leukocytes. This results in a [[localized disease|localised infection]], in which the virus mainly spreads and infects adjacent cells to the site of entry.<ref name=\"refMM\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\">{{cite book |title=Molecular Pathology and the Dynamics of Disease |last=Mitchell |first=Maika G.  |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/C2016-0-04893-3 |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |isbn=978-0-12-814610-1|date=2010-04-16 }}</ref>  Otherwise, the virus can be released into extracellular fluids.\nExamples of localised infections include: common cold ([[rhinovirus]]), flu ([[Human parainfluenza viruses|parainfluenza]]), gastrointestinal infections ([[rotavirus]]) or skin infections ([[Human papillomavirus infection|papillomavirus]]).<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Dissemination and secondary replication=== \nIn other cases, the virus can cause [[systemic disease]] through a disseminated infection spread throughout the body. The predominant mode of viral dissemination occurs through the blood or [[lymphatic system]], some of which include viruses responsible for chickenpox ([[varicella zoster virus]]), smallpox ([[smallpox|variola]]), HIV ([[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]). A minority of viruses can disseminate via the nervous system.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/> Notably, the [[poliovirus]] can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, where it initially replicates in its site of entry, the small intestine and spread to regional [[lymph node]]s. Then, the virus disseminates via the bloodstream into different organs in the body (e.g. liver, spleen), followed by a secondary round of replication and dissemination into the central nervous system to damage [[motor neuron]]s.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> \n\n===Shedding and secondary transmission=== \nFinally, the viruses spread to sites where [[Viral shedding|shedding]] into the environment can occur. The [[respiratory]], [[alimentary]] and [[urogenital]] tracts and the blood are the most frequent sites of shedding in the form of bodily fluids, aerosols, skin, excrement. The virus would then go on to be transmitted to another person, and establish the infection cycle all over again.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" /><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\n\n==Factors affecting pathogenesis== \nThere are a few main overarching factors affecting viral diseases:\n*Virus tropism\n*Virus factors\n*Host factors\n\n===Molecular basis of virus tropism===\n'''Virus tropism''' refers to the virus\u2019 preferential site of replication in discrete cell types within an organ. In most cases, tropism is determined by the ability of the [[viral protein|viral surface proteins]] to fuse or bind to surface receptors of specific target cells to establish infection.  Thus, the binding specificity of viral surface proteins dictates tropism as well as the destruction of particular cell populations, and is therefore a major determinant of virus pathogenesis.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\nHowever, [[co-receptor]]s are sometimes required in addition to the binding of cellular receptors on host cells to viral proteins in order to establish infection. For instance, HIV-1 requires target cells to express co-receptors [[CCR5]] or [[CXCR4]], on top of the [[CD4]] receptor for productive viral attachment.<ref name=\"HIV\">  {{Cite journal | author=Shen, H., Yin, J., Leng, F. | title=HIV coreceptor tropism determination and mutational pattern identification | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume=6 | year=2016 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21280 }}  </ref> Interestingly, HIV-1 can undergo a [[HIV tropism|tropism switch]], where the virus [[Envelope glycoprotein GP120|glycoprotein gp120]] initially uses CCR5 (mainly on macrophages) as the primary co-receptor for entering the host cell. Subsequently, HIV-1 switches to bind to CXCR4 (mainly on [[T cell]]s) as the infection progresses, in doing so transitions the viral pathogenicity to a different stage.<ref name=\"HIV\"/><ref name =\"robbins\" />\n \nApart from cellular receptors, viral tropism can also governed by other intracellular factors, such as tissue-specific [[transcription factors]]. An example would be the [[JC polyomavirus]], in which its tropism is limited to [[glial cells]] since its [[enhancer]] is only active in glial cells,<ref name=\"baron\"/> and JC viral gene expression requires host transcription factors expressed exclusively in glial cells.<ref name =\"robbins\"> {{cite book |title =Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease |edition=9 |editor1=Kumar, Vinay |editor2=Abbas, Abul K. |editor3=Aster, Jon C. |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780323313094|date =2014 }} </ref>\n\nThe accessibility of host tissues and organs to the virus also regulates tropism. Accessibility is affected by physical barriers<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>, such as in enteroviruses, which replicate in the intestine since they are able to withstand bile, digestive enzymes and acidic environments.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n\n===Virus factors===\nViral genetics encoding viral factors will determine the degree of viral pathogenesis. This can be measured as [[virulence]], which can be used to compare the quantitative degree of pathology between related viruses. In other words, different virus strains possessing different virus factors can lead to different degrees of virulence, which in turn can be exploited to study the differences in pathogenesis of viral variants with different virulence.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\"/><ref name=gonzalez> {{Cite journal | author=Fuentes-Gonz\u00e1lez AM, Contreras-Paredes A, Manzo-Merino J, Lizano M | title=The modulation of apoptosis by oncogenic viruses | journal=[[Virology Journal]] | volume=10 | year=2013 | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-10-182 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>\n\nVirus factors are largely influenced by viral genetics, which is the virulence determinant of structural or non-structural proteins and [[non-coding DNA|non-coding sequences]].

In polioviruses, the attenuating point mutations are thought to induce a replication and [[translation]] defect to reduce the virus\u2019 ability of cross-linking to host cells and replicate within the nervous system.<ref name=\"utr\"/>\n\nViruses have also developed a variety of [[immunomodulation]] mechanisms to subvert the host immune response. This tend to feature virus-encoded decoy receptors that target [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s produced as part of the host immune response, or homologues of host cytokines.<ref name=\"veterinary virology\"/><ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Felix, J., Savvides, S. | title=Mechanisms of immunomodulation by mammalian and viral decoy receptors: insights from structures | journal=[[Nature Reviews Immunology]] | volume=17 | year=2017 | pages=112-129 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/nri.2016.134 }}  </ref> As such, viruses capable of manipulating the host cell response to infection as an immune evasion strategy exhibit greater pathogenicity.\n\n===Host factors=== \nViral pathogenesis is also largely dependent on host factors. Several viral infections have displayed a variety of effects, ranging from [[asymptomatic]] to symptomatic or even critical infection, solely based of differing host factors alone.

The incubation period refers to the time taken for the onset of disease after first contact with the virus. The incubation period typically varies with the distance traversed by the virus to the target organ. Viruses that travel a short distance to reach their target organ have a short incubation period of one to three days. On the other hand, with generalized infections, the incubation period is longer, ranging from months to years, because of how long it takes the virus to move throughout the body and reach the target organs. Surprisingly, generalised infections by [[togaviruses]] have a short incubation period due to the direct entry of the virus into target cells through insect bites.<ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\n\nThere are several other factors that affect the incubation period. The mechanisms behind long incubation periods, months or years for example, are not completely understood yet.\n\n==Evolution of virulence==\nAs with all parasites, [[natural selection]] favours the survival of low-virulence virus strains.<ref name=\"baron\"/> Many relatively avirulent viruses in their natural host show increased virulence upon transfer to a new host species. When an [[emergent virus|emerging virus]] first invades a new host species, the hosts have little or no immunity against the virus and often suffer high [[Mortality rate|mortality]].  Hosts that survive do so because they possess a set of advantageous genes that are favourable to the [[selection pressure]], that prevents the host from dying due to infection of the novel pathogen.  These survivors then reproduce and pass on the favourable genes to their offspring while hosts that do not possess those genes are slowly eradicated by [[natural selection]], resulting in lower mortality rates in future generations.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\nOver time, a decrease in virulence in the predominant strain is usually observed. This is because there is usually little advantage for a pathogen to kill the host before dispersal to new hosts, so viruses may evolve naturally to become less virulent to prolong survival in infected hosts to boost transmission. Likewise, the host will evolve to develop genetic resistance against the virus over time.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Benjamin M Bolker, Dharmini Shah | title=Transient virulence of emerging pathogens | journal=[[Journal of the Royal Society Interface]] | volume=7 | year=2010 | pages=811\u2013822 | DOI=10.1098/rsif.2009.0384}}  </ref>\n\nA paradigm of the evolution of virulence in emerging virus is the case of [[myxomatosis]] in rabbits.

Significantly, severely attenuated strains of the myxoma virus were detected in merely 2 years of its release, and genetic resistance in rabbits emerged within seven years.<ref name=\"Kerr2012\">  {{Cite journal | author=Peter J Kerr | title=Myxomatosis in Australia and Europe: A model for emerging infectious diseases | journal=[[Antiviral Research]] | volume=93 | year=2012 | pages=387-415 | url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.01.009 }}  </ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Virology]]\n*[[Glossary of virology]]\n*[[Pathogen]]\n*[[Pathogenesis]]\n*[[List of human diseases associated with infectious pathogens]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Virology]]\n", "name_user": "Isabellelyy", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_pathogenesis"}

Prior to his professional football career he attended Sacred Heart College, which is one of the most prolific schools in Australia in terms of producing Australian Rules footballers. His [[All Australian]] brother, [[Chad Cornes]], also attended Sacred Heart College and played for Glenelg in the SANFL. They are the sons of South Australian football identity [[Graham Cornes]], and stepsons of 2007 Federal Labor candidate [[Nicole Cornes]]. They have three younger half-sisters paternally.\n\n==AFL career==\nIn 2001 and 2002, Cornes played in Port Adelaide's two pre-season competition winning teams.\n\nThen in 2004, the team made the step up, and Cornes was in the team that won the 2004 AFL premiership, Port Adelaide's first in the AFL. 2004, Cornes' fourth season in the competition, saw him cement his position in the midfield, averaging 20 disposals a game.\n\nCornes continued his good form into 2005 becoming [[All Australian]], and in 2006 played his 100th game for the club in round 7, and topped the AFL Dreamteam competition, despite his team Port Adelaide having a bad year. \n\nIn 2007, Cornes won [[All Australian]] selection for the second time in a team otherwise dominated by Geelong players. He was also the leading possession winner in the AFL, received the most Brownlow votes for the year for Port Adelaide, and won their best and fairest, the [[John Cahill Medal]], ahead of brother [[Chad Cornes|Chad]].\n\nIn 2010, Cornes took out his third John Cahill Medal and confirmed his reputation as the club's most consistent player through a new attacking role that went beyond his previous role of merely tagging the opposition's best players. His 36-possession, 2-goal game against the Western Bulldogs in Round 16 of that year was a highlight, in addition to a 38-possession effort against West Coast late in the year. Instrumental in the Power's late season fortunes, he was well-deserving of his third best and fairest merit and highlighted his durability as a mainstay of the Port Adelaide engine room.\n\nIn 2011, Cornes had a difficult season by his standards as he adjusted to a new role which took him further away from his traditional tagging duties. Before 2011, Cornes had not missed a single game since 2003. But round 4, 2011 saw his streak of 174 consecutive games come to an end when he was omitted from the side.<ref>[http://www.finalsiren.com/PlayerStats.asp?PlayerID=1184]</ref> Playing more on the wing and across halfback, he was sent back to Glenelg in the SANFL with a view to adapting better to the coaching panel's new expectations. He still managed to play 17 games out of a possible 23, despite spending time back at the SANFL Tigers, and was serviceable in his ball-winning ability.\n\nCornes made an impressive return to form in 2012, playing every game, and playing an exceptional season as a setup midfielder. He won his fourth John Cahill Medal on the back of his season and polled again in the Brownlow Medal votes. He once again topped the disposals count for the season. Cornes received high praise for returning to his acclaimed tagging football with top performances on midfield heavyweights [[Brent Harvey]] (North Melbourne) and [[Gary Ablett, Jr.|Gary Ablett]] (Gold Coast).\n\nCornes reached his 250th game in Round 5 of 2013, where Port Adelaide came from 41-points down to win 12.12 (84) to 10.19 (79) at AAMI Stadium against the West Coast Eagles, taking the Power to a 5\u20130 start to the season. Shortly after, Cornes passed Warren Tredrea's record of 258 games to become the man who has played the most games for Port Adelaide in the AFL, in a match where Port thrashed Greater Western Sydney at Skoda Stadium, 19.11 (125) to 6.14 (50). Cornes has played a vital role under Ken Hinkley in reinventing Port Adelaide and getting the team back into finals in 2013, and helping the Power to their best ever start to an AFL season in 2014, starting 10\u20131, before eventually losing the 2014 preliminary final to Hawthorn, the eventual premiers, by three points.\n\nCornes' 2015 season was short. He played the first two games of the season before being rested in round three. He then played a further three games to take his career tally to 298 before announcing that the round 8 game against [[Richmond Tigers|Richmond]] would be his 300th and last to join the [[South Australian Metropolitan Fire Service]].<ref name=retire>{{cite news|url=http://www.portadelaidefc.com.au/news/2015-05-14/kane-cornes-retires|title=Kane Cornes to retire after becoming Power's first 300-gamer|first=Matthew|last=Agius|date=14 May 2015|website=portadelaide.com.au|publisher=[[Bigpond]]|accessdate=14 May 2015}}</ref> He finished his Port Adelaide career having played a total of 300 games, winning 4 best and fairest, two All Australian guernseys and a premiership.\n\n== Media career ==\nCornes took up a full time media career in 2016 after leaving the South Australia Metropolitan Fire Service, where he had been trying to do both, with appearances on [[The Sunday Footy Show (AFL)|The Sunday Footy Show]] and [[1116 SEN]], as well as writing for [[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser.]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sen.com.au/news/kane-cornes/|title=Kane Cornes news from SEN 1116|website=www.sen.com.au|language=en|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/sport/afl/expert-opinion/kane-cornes|title=AFL Opinion {{!}} The Advertiser|language=en|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref> He is known for his critical and divisive views including an on-going feud with [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide Crows]] player [[Taylor Walker (footballer)|Taylor Walker]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-2019-adelaides-taylor-walker-clips-kane-cornes-over-fireman-career-in-latest-instalment-of-feud/news-story/595a3bf79845f839a1ae7eec7cd9580e|title=AFL 2019: Taylor Walker v Kane Cornes feud, fireman career joke, history of feud between Adelaide captain, Power champion|date=2019-06-21|website=Fox Sports|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nOn 31 December 2004, Kane married long-time girlfriend, who he met at Sacred Heart College, Lucy.
