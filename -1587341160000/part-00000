'''meter''') refers to the regularly recurring patterns and accents such as [[bar (music)|bars]] and [[Beat (music)|beats]]. Unlike rhythm, metric onsets are not necessarily sounded, but are nevertheless expected by the listener.\n\nA variety of systems exist throughout the world for organising and playing metrical music, such as the Indian system of ''[[Tala (music)|tala]]'' and similar systems in [[Rhythm in Arabian music|Arabian]] and [[Rhythm in Sub-Saharan Africa|African music]].\n\nWestern music inherited the concept of metre from poetry ({{harvnb|Scholes|1977}}; {{harvnb|Latham|2002b}}) where it denotes: the number of lines in a [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]; the number of syllables in each line; and the arrangement of those syllables as long or short, accented or unaccented ({{harvnb|Scholes|1977}}; {{harvnb|Latham|2002b}}). The first coherent system of rhythmic notation in modern Western music was based on [[rhythmic mode]]s derived from the [[Foot (prosody)|basic types]] of [[Meter (poetry)|metrical]] unit in the [[quantitative meter]] of [[Classics|classical]] [[ancient Greek poetry|ancient Greek]] and [[Latin poetry]] {{harv|Hoppin|1978|loc=221}}.\n\nLater music for [[Renaissance dance|dances]] such as the [[pavane]] and [[galliard]] consisted of [[musical phrase]]s to accompany a [[Dance move|fixed sequence]] of [[Basic (dance move)|basic steps]] with a defined tempo and [[time signature]]. The English word \"measure\", originally an exact or just amount of time, came to denote either a poetic rhythm, a bar of music, or else an entire melodic verse or dance {{harv|Merriam-Webster|2015}} involving sequences of notes, words, or movements that may last four, eight or sixteen bars.\n\nMeter is related to and distinguished from pulse, rhythm (grouping), and beats: \n{{Quote|Meter is the measurement of the number of pulses between more or less regularly recurring accents.<!--3--> Therefore, in order for meter to exist, some of the pulses in a series must be accented\u2014marked for consciousness\u2014relative to others.<!--4--> When pulses are thus counted within a metric context, they are referred to as ''beats''. {{harv|Cooper and Meyer|1960|p=3}}}}\n\n==Metric structure==\n<!--[[Subdivision (meter)]], [[Subdivision (music)]], [[Division level]], [[Metric hierarchy]], and [[multiple level]] redirect directly here-->\n\nThe term ''metre'' is not very precisely defined ({{harvnb|Scholes|1977}}). [[Stewart Macpherson|Stewart MacPherson]] preferred to speak of \"time\" and \"rhythmic shape\" ({{harvtxt|MacPherson|1930|loc=3}}), while [[Imogen Holst]] preferred \"measured rhythm\" ({{harvtxt|Holst|1963|loc=17}}). However, Justin London has written a book about musical metre, which \"involves our initial perception as well as subsequent anticipation of a series of beats that we abstract from the rhythm surface of the music as it unfolds in time\" ({{harvnb|London|2004|loc=4}}). This \"perception\" and \"abstraction\" of rhythmic bar is the foundation of human instinctive musical participation, as when we divide a series of identical clock-ticks into \"tick\u2013tock\u2013tick\u2013tock\" ({{harvnb|Scholes|1977}}). \"Rhythms of recurrence\" arise from the interaction of two levels of motion, the faster providing the pulse and the slower organizing the beats into repetitive groups ({{harvnb|Yeston|1976|loc=50&ndash;52}}). In his book ''The Rhythms of Tonal Music'', Joel Lester notes that, \"[o]nce a metric hierarchy has been established, we, as listeners, will maintain that organization as long as minimal evidence is present\" ({{harvnb|Lester|1986|loc=77}}).\n\n[[File:Metric levels.svg|thumb|350px|left|Metric levels: beat level shown in middle with division levels above and multiple levels below.]]\n\"''Meter'' may be defined as a regular, recurring pattern of strong and weak beats. This recurring pattern of durations is identified at the beginning of a composition by a meter signature (time signature). ... Although meter is generally indicated by time signatures, it is important to realize that meter is not simply a matter of notation\" {{harv|Benward and Saker|2003|loc=9}}. A definition of musical metre requires the possibility of identifying a repeating pattern of accented pulses \u2013 a \"pulse-group\" \u2014 which corresponds to the [[foot (poetry)|foot]] in poetry. Frequently a pulse-group can be identified by taking the accented beat as the first pulse in the group and counting the pulses until the next accent ({{harvnb|MacPherson|1930|loc=5}}; {{harvnb|Scholes|1977}}). Frequently metres can be broken down into a pattern of duples and triples ({{harvnb|MacPherson|1930|loc=5}}; {{harvnb|Scholes|1977}}).\n\nThe level of musical organisation implied by musical metre includes the most elementary levels of [[form (music)|musical form]] ({{harvnb|MacPherson|1930|loc=3}}).\n\nMetrical rhythm, measured rhythm, and free rhythm are general classes of rhythm and may be distinguished in all aspects of temporality ({{harvnb|Cooper|1973|loc=30}}): \n* '''Metrical rhythm''', by far the most common class in Western music, is where each time value is a multiple or fraction of a fixed unit (beat, see paragraph below), and normal [[Accent (music)|accents]] reoccur regularly, providing systematic grouping ([[Bar (music)|bars]], [[divisive rhythm]]).\n* '''Measured rhythm''' is where each time value is a multiple or fraction of a specified time unit but there are not regularly recurring accents ([[additive rhythm]]).\n* [[Free time (music)|'''Free rhythm''']] is where there is neither.\nSome music, including [[chant]], has freer rhythm, like the rhythm of prose compared to that of verse ({{harvnb|Scholes|1977}}). Some music, such as some graphically scored works since the 1950s and non-European music such as [[Honkyoku]] repertoire for [[shakuhachi]], may be considered '''ametric''' ({{harvnb|Karpinski|2000|loc=19}}). The music term ''senza misura'' is Italian for \"without metre\", meaning to play without a beat, using [[time]] to bar how long it will take to play the bar ({{harvnb|Forney and Machlis|2007|loc={{Page needed|date=December 2009}}}}).\n\n'''Metric structure''' includes metre, [[tempo]], and all [[rhythm]]ic aspects that produce temporal regularity or structure, against which the foreground details or [[Duration (music)|durational pattern]]s of any piece of music are projected ({{harvnb|Wittlich|1975|loc=chapt. 3}}). '''Metric levels''' may be distinguished: the [[beat level]] is the metric level at which pulses are heard as the basic time unit of the piece. Faster levels are '''division levels''', and slower levels are '''multiple levels''' ({{harvnb|Wittlich|1975|loc=chapt. 3}}). A [[rhythmic unit]] is a durational pattern which occupies a period of time equivalent to a pulse or pulses on an underlying metric level.\n\n==Frequently encountered types of metre==\n{{anchor|Frequently encountered types of meter}}\n\n===Metres classified by the number of beats per measure===\n{{anchor|Meters classified by the number of beats per measure}}\n\n====Duple and quadruple metre====\n{{anchor|Duple and quadruple meter}}\nIn [[duple metre]], each [[bar (music)|measure]] is divided into two [[beat (music)|beats]], or a multiple thereof ([[Quadruple meter|quadruple metre]]).\n\nFor example, in the time signature {{music|time|2|4}}, each bar contains two (2) [[Quarter note|quarter-note]] (4) beats. In the time signature {{music|time|6|8}}, each bar contains two [[Dotted quarter note|dotted-quarter-note]] beats.\n:{|\n\n|<score vorbis=\"1\" override_midi=\"Simple duple drum pattern.mid\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    \\new Staff <<\n       \\new voice \\relative c' {\n           \\clef percussion\n           \\numericTimeSignature\n           \\time 2/4\n           \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 100\n           \\stemDown \\repeat volta 2 { g4 d' }\n       }\n       \\new voice \\relative c'' {\n           \\override NoteHead.style = #'cross\n           \\stemUp \\repeat volta 2 { a8 a a a }\n       }\n   >></score>\n|<score vorbis=\"1\" override_midi=\"Compound duple drum pattern.mid\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   \\new Staff <<\n       \\new voice \\relative c' {\n           \\clef percussion\n           \\numericTimeSignature\n           \\time 6/8\n           \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4. = 80\n           \\stemDown \\repeat volta 2 { g4. d' }\n       }\n       \\new voice \\relative c'' {\n           \\override NoteHead.style = #'cross\n           \\stemUp \\repeat volta 2 { a8 a a a a a }\n       }\n   >></score>\n|}\n\nCorresponding quadruple metres are {{music|time|4|4}}, which has four quarter-note beats per measure, and {{music|time|12|8}}, which has four dotted-quarter-note beats per bar.\n\n:{|\n|<score vorbis=\"1\" override_midi=\"Characteristic rock drum pattern.mid\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    \\new Staff <<\n       \\new voice \\relative c' {\n           \\clef percussion\n           \\numericTimeSignature\n           \\time 4/4\n           \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 100\n           \\stemDown \\repeat volta 2 { g4 d' g, d' }\n       }\n       \\new voice \\relative c'' {\n           \\override NoteHead.style = #'cross\n           \\stemUp \\repeat volta 2 { a8 a a a a a a a }\n       }\n   >></score>\n|<score vorbis=\"1\" override_midi=\"Compound quadruple drum pattern.mid\" lang=\"lilypond\">    \\new Staff <<\n       \\new voice \\relative c' {\n           \\clef percussion\n           \\numericTimeSignature\n           \\time 12/8\n           \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4. = 80\n           \\stemDown \\repeat volta 2 { g4. d' g, d' }\n       }\n       \\new voice \\relative c'' {\n           \\override NoteHead.style = #'cross\n           \\stemUp \\repeat volta 2 { a8 a a a a a a a a a a a }\n       }\n   >></score>\n|}\n\n====Triple metre====\n{{anchor|Triple meter}}\n[[Triple metre]] is a metre in which each bar is divided into three beats, or a multiple thereof.

Higher meters which ''are'' divisible by 2 or 3 are considered equivalent to groupings of tuple or triple meter measures, thus, {{music|time|6|4}}, for example, is rarely used because it is considered equivalent to two measures of {{music|time|3|4}}. See: [[hypermetre]] and [[additive rhythm and divisive rhythm]].\n\nHigher metres are used more commonly in analysis, if not performance, of [[cross-rhythm]]s, as lowest number possible which may be used to count a [[polyrhythm]] is the [[lowest common denominator]] (LCD) of the two or more metric divisions. For example, much African music is recorded in Western notation as being in {{music|time|12|8}}, the LCD of 4 and 3.\n\n===Metres classified by the subdivisions of a beat===\n{{anchor|Meters classified by the subdivisions of a beat}}\nSimple metre and compound metre are distinguished by the way the beats are subdivided.\n====Simple metre====<!--[[Simple meter]] redirects here-->\n{{anchor|Simple meter}}\nSimple metre (or simple time) is a metre in which each beat of the bar divides naturally into two (as opposed to three) equal parts. The top number in the time signature will be 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.\n\nFor example, in the time signature {{music|time|3|4}}, each bar contains three quarter-note beats, and each of those beats divides into two [[eighth note]]s, making it a simple metre. More specifically, it is a simple ''triple'' metre because there are three beats in each measure; simple duple (two beats) or simple quadruple (four) are also common metres.\n\n:{|\n|<score vorbis=\"1\" override_midi=\"Simple duple drum pattern.mid\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    \\new Staff <<\n       \\new voice \\relative c' {\n           \\clef percussion\n           \\numericTimeSignature\n           \\time 2/4\n           \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 100\n           \\stemDown \\repeat volta 2 { g4 d' }\n       }\n       \\new voice \\relative c'' {\n           \\override NoteHead.style = #'cross\n           \\stemUp \\repeat volta 2 { a8 a a a }\n       }\n   >></score>\n|<score vorbis=\"1\" override_midi=\"Simple triple drum pattern.mid\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    \\new Staff <<\n       \\new voice \\relative c' {\n           \\clef percussion\n           \\numericTimeSignature\n           \\time 3/4\n           \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 100\n           \\stemDown \\repeat volta 2 { g4 d' d }\n       }\n       \\new voice \\relative c'' {\n           \\override NoteHead.style = #'cross\n           \\stemUp \\repeat volta 2 { a8[ a] a[ a] a[ a] }\n       }\n   >></score>\n|<score vorbis=\"1\" override_midi=\"Characteristic rock drum pattern.mid\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    \\new Staff <<\n       \\new voice \\relative c' {\n           \\clef percussion\n           \\numericTimeSignature\n           \\time 4/4\n           \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 100\n           \\stemDown \\repeat volta 2 { g4 d' g, d' }\n       }\n       \\new voice \\relative c'' {\n           \\override NoteHead.style = #'cross\n           \\stemUp \\repeat volta 2 { a8 a a a a a a a }\n       }\n   >></score>\n|}\n\n====Compound metre==== <!-- Compound_meter page links directly to here -->\n{{anchor|Compound meter}}\nCompound metre (or compound time), is a metre in which each beat of the bar divides naturally into three equal parts. That is, each [[beat (music)|beat]] contains a triple pulse ({{harvnb|Latham|2002a}}). The top number in the time signature will be 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24, etc.\n\nCompound metres are written with a time signature that shows the number of ''divisions'' of beats in each bar as opposed to the number of beats. For example, compound duple (two beats, each divided into three) is written as a time signature with a numerator of six, for example, {{music|time|6|8}}. Contrast this with the time signature {{music|time|3|4}}, which also assigns six eighth notes to each measure, but by convention connotes a simple triple time: 3 quarter-note beats.\n\nExamples of compound metre include {{music|time|6|8}} (compound duple metre), {{music|time|9|8}} (compound triple metre), and {{music|time|12|8}} (compound quadruple metre).\n\n::{|\n|<score vorbis=\"1\" override_midi=\"Compound duple drum pattern.mid\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   \\new Staff <<\n       \\new voice \\relative c' {\n           \\clef percussion\n           \\numericTimeSignature\n           \\time 6/8\n           \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4. = 80\n           \\stemDown \\repeat volta 2 { g4. d' }\n       }\n       \\new voice \\relative c'' {\n           \\override NoteHead.style = #'cross\n           \\stemUp \\repeat volta 2 { a8 a a a a a }\n       }\n   >></score>\n|<score vorbis=\"1\" override_midi=\"Compound triple drum pattern.mid\" lang=\"lilypond\">    \\new Staff <<\n       \\new voice \\relative c' {\n           \\clef percussion\n           \\numericTimeSignature\n           \\time 9/8\n           \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4. = 80\n           \\stemDown \\repeat volta 2 { g4. d' d }\n       }\n       \\new voice \\relative c'' {\n           \\override NoteHead.style = #'cross\n           \\stemUp \\repeat volta 2 { a8 a a a a a a a a }\n       }\n   >></score>\n|<score vorbis=\"1\" override_midi=\"Compound quadruple drum pattern.mid\" lang=\"lilypond\">    \\new Staff <<\n       \\new voice \\relative c' {\n           \\clef percussion\n           \\numericTimeSignature\n           \\time 12/8\n           \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4. = 80\n           \\stemDown \\repeat volta 2 { g4. d' g, d' }\n       }\n       \\new voice \\relative c'' {\n           \\override NoteHead.style = #'cross\n           \\stemUp \\repeat volta 2 { a8 a a a a a a a a a a a }\n       }\n   >></score>\n|}\n\nAlthough {{music|time|3|4}} and {{music|time|6|8}} are not to be confused, they use bars of the same length, so it is easy to \"slip\" between them just by shifting the location of the accents. This interpretational switch has been exploited, for example, by [[Leonard Bernstein]], in the song \"[[America (Leonard Bernstein song)|America]]\":\n[[File:Alternating time signatures2.gif|center|thumb|340x340px|\"I like to be in A-mer-i-ca\" from ''West Side Story'' {{audio|Alternating time signatures2.mid|Play}}.]]\n\nCompound metre divided into three parts could theoretically be transcribed into musically equivalent simple metre using [[tuplet|triplets]]. Likewise, simple metre can be shown in compound through duples. In practice, however, this is rarely done because it disrupts [[Beat pattern|conducting patterns]] when the [[tempo]] changes.  When conducting in {{music|time|6|8}}, conductors typically provide two beats per bar; however, all six beats may be performed when the tempo is very slow.\n\nCompound time is associated with \"lilting\" and dancelike qualities. Folk dances often use compound time. Many [[Baroque dance]]s are often in compound time: some [[gigue]]s, the [[courante]], and sometimes the [[passepied]] and the [[siciliana]].\n\n==Metre in song==\n{{anchor|Meter in song}}\n[[File:3Chinesen.png|thumb|left|400x400px|A German children's song shows a common fourfold multiplication of rhythmic phrases into a complete verse and melody. {{audio|3Chinesen.mid|Play}}]]\n\nThe concept of metre in music derives in large part from the [[meter (poetry)|poetic metre]] of [[song]] and includes not only the basic rhythm of the foot, pulse-group or '''figure''' used but also the [[rhythm]]ic or [[Form (music)|formal]] arrangement of such figures into musical phrases (lines, couplets) and of such phrases into melodies, passages or sections (stanzas, verses) to give what {{harvtxt|Holst|1963|loc=18}} calls \"the time pattern of any song\" (''See also:'' [[Musical form#Levels of organization|Form of a musical passage]]).\n\nTraditional and popular songs may draw heavily upon a limited range of metres, leading to interchangeability of melodies. Early [[hymnal]]s commonly did not include musical notation but simply texts that could be sung to any tune known by the singers that had a matching metre. For example, [[The Blind Boys of Alabama]] rendered the [[hymn]] \"[[Amazing Grace]]\" to the setting of [[The Animals]]' version of the [[folk song]] \"[[The House of the Rising Sun]]\". This is possible because the texts share a popular basic four-line ([[quatrain]]) [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]-form called ''[[ballad]] metre'' or, in hymnals, [[Meter (hymn)|''common metre'']], the four lines having a syllable-count of 8\u20136\u20138\u20136 (Hymns Ancient and Modern Revised), the rhyme-scheme usually following suit: ABAB. There is generally a pause in the melody in a [[cadence (music)|cadence]] at the end of the shorter lines so that the underlying musical metre is 8\u20138\u20138\u20138 beats, the cadences dividing this musically into two symmetrical \"normal\" phrases of four bars each ({{harvnb|MacPherson|1930|loc=14}}).\n\nIn some regional music, for example [[Music of Southeastern Europe|Balkan music]] (like [[Bulgarian dances|Bulgarian music]], and the Macedonian [[Leventikos|{{serif|'''3+2+2+3+2'''}}]] metre), a wealth of irregular or compound metres are used. Other terms for this are \"additive metre\" ({{harvnb|London|2001|loc=\u00a7I.8}}) and \"imperfect time\" ({{harvnb|Read|1964|loc=147{{Failed verification|date=August 2013}}<!--Read is evidently the intended source, but his use of \"imperfect time\" does not correspond exactly to this description of additive (or aksak) metres, nor does he mention music of the Balkans at all.-->}}).\n\n==Metre in dance music==\n{{anchor|Meter in dance music}}\n[[File:Waltz rhythms.PNG|right|thumb|400px|Typical figures of the waltz rhythm {{harv|Scruton|1997}}]]\n[[File:Gavotte rhythm.png|right|thumb|300x300px]]\n{{listen\n | header = From ''[[Terpsichore (1612)|Terpsichore]]'' <br/>([[Michael Praetorius]], 1612):\n | filename    = Dances from Terpsichore - 6.

Such figures may then be \"amalgamated\" to create a series of movements that may synchronise to an entire musical section or piece. This can be thought of as an equivalent of [[prosody (poetry)|prosody]] (see also: [[prosody (music)]]).\n\n==Metre in classical music==\n{{anchor|Meter in classical music}}\nIn music of the [[common practice period]] (about 1600&ndash;1900), there are four different families of time signature in common use:\n*'''[[Metre (music)#Simple metre|Simple]] [[Duple meter|duple]]''': two or four beats to a bar, each divided by two, the top number being \"2\" or \"4\" ({{music|time|2|4}}, {{music|time|2|8}}, {{music|time|2|2}} ... {{music|time|4|4}}, {{music|time|4|8}}, {{music|time|4|2}} ...). When there are four beats to a bar, it is alternatively referred to as \"quadruple\" time.\n*'''Simple [[triple metre|triple]]''': three beats to a bar, each divided by two, the top number being \"3\" ({{music|time|3|4}}, {{music|time|3|8}}, {{music|time|3|2}} ...)\n*'''[[Metre (music)#Compound metre|Compound]] duple''': two beats to a bar, each divided by three, the top number being \"6\" ({{music|time|6|8}}, {{music|time|6|16}}, {{music|time|6|4}} ...)\n*'''Compound triple''': three beats to a bar, each divided by three, the top number being \"9\" ({{music|time|9|8}}, {{music|time|9|16}}, {{music|time|9|4}})\n\nIf the beat is divided into two the metre is ''simple'', if divided into three it is ''compound''. If each bar is divided into two it is ''duple'' and if into three it is ''triple''. Some people also label quadruple, while some consider it as two duples. Any other division is considered additively, as a bar of five beats may be broken into duple+triple (12123) or triple+duple (12312) depending on accent. However, in some music, especially at faster tempos, it may be treated as one unit of five.\n\n===Changing metre===\n{{anchor|Changing meter}}\nIn [[20th-century classical music|20th-century concert music]], it became more common to switch metre\u2014the end of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (shown below) is an example. This practice is sometimes called ''[[Mixed meter|mixed metres]]''.\n\n:<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\"> { \\new PianoStaff << \\new Staff \\relative c'' { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"violin\" \\clef treble \\tempo 8 = 126 \\override DynamicLineSpanner.staff-padding = #4 \\time 3/16 r16 <d c a fis d>-! r16\\fermata | \\time 2/16 r <d c a fis d>-! \\time 3/16 r <d c a fis d>8-! | r16 <d c a fis d>8-! | \\time 2/8 <d c a fis>16-! <e c bes g>->-![ <cis b aes f>-! <c a fis ees>-!] } \\new Staff \\relative c { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"violin\" \\clef bass \\time 3/16 d,16-! <bes'' ees,>^\\f-! r\\fermata | \\time 2/16 <d,, d,>-! <bes'' ees,>-! | \\time 3/16 d16-! <ees cis>8-! | r16 <ees cis>8-! | \\time 2/8 d16^\\sf-! <ees cis>-!->[ <d c>-! <d c>-!] } >> } </score>\n\nA [[metric modulation]] is a [[modulation (music)|modulation]] from one metric unit or metre to another.\n\nThe use of [[asymmetrical rhythm]]s \u2013 sometimes called ''[[aksak]]'' rhythm (the Turkish word for \"limping\") \u2013 also became more common in the 20th century: such metres include quintuple as well as more complex [[additive meter|additive metres]] along the lines of {{serif|'''2+2+3'''}} time, where each [[bar (music)|bar]] has two 2-beat units and a 3-beat unit with a stress at the beginning of each unit. Similar metres are often used in [[Bulgarian dances|Bulgarian folk dances]] and [[Indian classical music]].\n\n==Hypermetre==\n<!--[[Hypermeter]] redirects directly here.-->\n{{anchor|Hypermeter}}\n[[File:Hypermeter.png|thumb|375px|Hypermetre: four-beat measure, four-bar hypermeasure, and four-hyperbar verses. Hyperbeats in red.]]\n[[File:Waldstein.PNG|thumb|375px|Opening of the third movement of Beethoven's [[Piano Sonata No. 21 (Beethoven)|Waldstein sonata]]. The melodic lines in bars 1\u20134 and 5\u20138 are (almost) identical, and both form hypermetric spans. The two hyperbeats are the low Cs, in the first and fifth bars of the example. {{audio|Waldstein.mid|Play}}]]\n\n'''Hypermetre''' is large-scale metre (as opposed to smaller-scale metre). [[Bar (music)#Hypermeasure|Hypermeasures]] consist of [[hyperbeat]]s ({{harvnb|Stein|2005|loc=329}}). \"Hypermeter is meter, with all its inherent characteristics, at the level where bars act as beats\" {{harv|Neal|2000|loc=115}}. For example, the four-bar hypermeasures are the prototypical structure for [[country music]], in and against which country songs work {{harv|Neal|2000|loc=115}}. In some styles, two- and four-bar hypermetres are common.\n\nThe term was coined, together with \"hypermeasures\", by [[Edward T. Cone|Edward T.]] {{harvtxt|Cone|1968}}, who regarded it as applying to a relatively small scale, conceiving of a still larger kind of gestural \"rhythm\" imparting a sense of \"an extended upbeat followed by its downbeat\" {{harv|Berry and Van Solkema|2013|loc=\u00a75(vi)}}. {{harvtxt|London|2012|loc=25}} contends that in terms of multiple and simultaneous levels of metrical \"entrainment\" (evenly spaced temporal events \"that we internalize and come to expect\", p.&nbsp;9), there is no in-principle distinction between metre and hypermetre; instead, they are the same phenomenon occurring at different levels.\n\n{{harvtxt|Lee|1985}}{{vn|date=August 2013}} and Middleton have described musical metre in terms of [[deep structure]], using [[generative grammar|generative]] concepts to show how different metres ({{music|time|4|4}}, {{music|time|3|4}}, etc.) generate many different surface rhythms. For example, the first phrase of [[The Beatles]]' \"[[A Hard Day's Night (song)|A Hard Day's Night]]\", excluding the [[syncopation]] on \"night\", may be generated from its metre of {{music|time|4|4}}\n{{harv|Middleton|1990|loc=211}}:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" width=\"33%\" |{{music|time|4|4}}\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" width=\"33%\"  |{{music|time|4|4}}\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" width=\"34%\"  |{{music|time|4|4}}\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|time|2|4}}\n|colspan=4 align=\"center\"|{{music|time|2|4}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|time|2|4}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|time|2|4}}\n| align=\"center\" width=\"17%\" |{{music|time|2|4}}\n| align=\"center\" width=\"17%\" |{{music|time|2|4}}\n|-\n|\n|colspan=2 align=\"center\"|{{music|time|1|4}}\n|colspan=2 align=\"center\"|{{music|time|1|4}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|time|1|8}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|time|1|8}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|time|1|8}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|time|1|8}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|halfrest}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|eighthrest}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|eighthnote}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|eighthnote}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|eighthnote}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|halfnote}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|halfnote}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|halfnote}}\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\" |It's\n| align=\"center\" |been\n| align=\"center\" |a\n| align=\"center\" |hard\n| align=\"center\" |day's\n| align=\"center\" |night...\n|\n|}\nThe syncopation may then be added, moving \"night\" forward one eighth note, and the first phrase is generated ({{audio|A Hard Day's Night opening phrase.mid|Play}}).\n\n==Polymetre==\n{{anchor|Polymeter}}\n{{see also|Polyrhythm}}\n\nWith '''polymetre''', the bar sizes differ, but the beat remains constant. Since the beat is the same, the various metres eventually agree. (Four bars of {{music|time|7|4}} = seven bars of {{music|time|4|4}}). An example is the second moment, titled \"Scherzo polimetrico\", of [[Edmund Rubbra]]'s Second String Quartet (1951), in which a constant triplet texture holds together overlapping bars of {{music|time|9|8}}, {{music|time|12|8}}, and {{music|time|21|8}}, and barlines rarely coincide in all four instruments {{harv|Rubbra|1953|loc=41}}.\n\nWith [[polyrhythm]], the number of beats varies within a fixed bar length. For example, in a 4:3 polyrhythm, one part plays {{music|time|4|4}} while the other plays {{music|time|3|4}}, but the {{music|time|3|4}} beats are stretched so that three beats of {{music|time|3|4}} are played in the same time as four beats of {{music|time|4|4}}.\n\nMore generally, sometimes rhythms are combined in a way that is neither tactus nor bar preserving\u2014the beat differs and the bar size also differs. See [[Polytempo|Polytempi]].\n\nResearch into the perception of polymetre shows that listeners often either extract a composite pattern that is fitted to a metric framework, or focus on one rhythmic stream while treating others as \"noise\". This is consistent with the [[Gestalt psychology]] tenet that \"the [[figure-ground (perception)|figure\u2013ground]] dichotomy is fundamental to all perception\" ({{harvnb|Boring|1942|loc=253}};{{vn|date=August 2013}} {{harvnb|London|2004|loc=49\u201350}}). In the music, the two metres will meet each other after a specific number of beats. For example, a {{music|time|3|4}} metre and {{music|time|4|4}} metre will meet after 12 beats.\n\n<!--This paragraph is in danger of becoming a trivia list. There are hundreds, possibly thousands of popular-music bands who have used polyrhythm. Please think twice before adding more.-->In \"Toads of the Short Forest\" (from the album ''[[Weasels Ripped My Flesh]]''), composer [[Frank Zappa]] explains: \"At this very moment on stage we have drummer A playing in {{music|time|7|8}}, drummer B playing in {{music|time|3|4}}, the bass playing in {{music|time|3|4}}, the organ playing in {{music|time|5|8}}, the tambourine playing in {{music|time|3|4}},{{Clarify|date=June 2015}}<!--How can this be describing a common beat with different-length bars? surely the players in {{music|time|7|8}} and {{music|time|5|8}} metres must be using a different counting unit from the ones in {{music|time|3|4}}.--> and the alto sax blowing his nose\" {{harv|Mothers of Invention|1970}}. \"Touch And Go\", a [[The Cars discography|hit single]] by [[The Cars]], has polymetric verses, with the drums and bass playing in {{music|time|5|4}}, while the guitar, synthesizer, and vocals are in {{music|time|4|4}} (the choruses are entirely in {{music|time|4|4}}) {{harv|Cars|1981|loc=15}}. [[Magma (band)|Magma]] uses extensively {{music|time|7|8}} on {{music|time|2|4}} (e.g. [[M\u00ebkan\u00efk D\u00ebstrukt\u00ef\u1e81 K\u00f6mmand\u00f6h]]) and some other combinations. [[King Crimson]]'s albums of the eighties have several songs that use polymetre of various combinations.\n\nPolymetres are a defining characteristic of the [[djent]] subgenre of metal, first pioneered by The Swedish metal band [[Meshuggah]] frequent use of polymetres, with unconventionally timed rhythm figures cycling over a {{music|time|4|4}} base ({{harvnb|Pieslak|2007}}).\n\n===Examples===\n'''Polymetres\u2014video'''\n{|\n| [[File:Polymeter-5c4.ogv|thumb|none|133px|Beat-preserving polymetre {{music|time|5|4}} with {{music|time|4|4}}]]\n| [[File:Polymeter-5c3.ogv|thumb|none|133px|Beat-preserving polymetre {{music|time|5|4}} with {{music|time|3|4}}]]\n| [[File:Polymeter-3c4.theora.ogv|thumb|none|133px|Measure-preserving polyrhythm {{music|time|3|4}} with {{music|time|4|4}}]]\n|-\n| [[File:Polymeter-2o4c3o8.ogv|thumb|none|133px|Beat-preserving polymetre {{music|time|2|4}} with {{music|time|3|8}}]]\n| [[File:Polymeter-4o4c5o8.ogv|thumb|none|133px|Beat-preserving polymetre {{music|time|4|4}} with {{music|time|5|8}}]]\n| [[File:Polymeter-4o4c7o8.ogv|thumb|none|133px|Beat-preserving polymetre {{music|time|4|4}} with {{music|time|7|8}}]]\n|-\n|[[File:Polyrhythm3c2.theora.ogv|thumb|none|133px|Measure-preserving polyrhythm 2:3]]\n| [[File:Polyrhythm4c3.theora.ogv|thumb|none|133px|Measure-preserving polyrhythm 4:3]]\n| [[File:Polyrhythm-5 o 4 with 4 o 4 simultaneously.ogv|thumb|none|133px|Measure-preserving polyrhythm 5:4]]\n|}\n'''Various metres\u2014video'''\n{|\n| [[File:Video of 6o8 at 90 bpm.ogv|thumb|none|133px|{{music|time|6|8}} at tempo of 90&nbsp;bpm]]\n| [[File:Video for 9o8 at 90 bpm.ogv|thumb|none|133px|{{music|time|9|8}} at tempo of 90&nbsp;bpm]]\n| [[File:Video for 12o8 at 90 bpm.ogv|thumb|none|133px|{{music|time|12|8}} at tempo of 90&nbsp;bpm]]\n|-\n| [[File:Video for 2o4 at 60 bpm.ogv|thumb|none|133px|{{music|time|2|4}} at a tempo of 60&nbsp;bpm]]\n| [[File:Video for 3o4 at 60 bpm.ogv|thumb|none|133px|{{music|time|3|4}} at a tempo of 60&nbsp;bpm]]\n| [[File:Video for 4o4 at 60 bpm.ogv|thumb|none|133px|{{music|time|4|4}} at a tempo of 60&nbsp;bpm]]\n|}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Metre (hymn)]]\n* [[Metre (poetry)]]\n* [[Triple metre]]\n* [[Duple and quadruple metre]]\n* [[Sextuple metre]]\n* [[Composite rhythm]]\n* [[Counting (music)]]\n* [[Hymns and hymn tunes]]\n* [[Hymn tune]]\n* [[List of musical works in unusual time signatures]]\n* [[Tala (music)|Tala]]\n* [[Tuplet]]\n* [[Rhythm in Arabian music|Wazn]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Commons category|Rhythm and meter}}\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Anon.|1999}}|reference=Anon.

'''meter''') refers to the regularly recurring patterns and accents such as [[bar (music)|bars]] and [[Beat (music)|beats]]. Unlike rhythm, metric onsets are not necessarily sounded, but are nevertheless expected by the listener.\n\nA variety of systems exist throughout the world for organising and playing metrical music, such as the Indian system of ''[[Tala (music)|tala]]'' and similar systems in [[Rhythm in Arabian music|Arabian]] and [[Rhythm in Sub-Saharan Africa|African music]].\n\nWestern music inherited the concept of metre from poetry ({{harvnb|Scholes|1977}}; {{harvnb|Latham|2002b}}) where it denotes: the number of lines in a [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]; the number of syllables in each line; and the arrangement of those syllables as long or short, accented or unaccented ({{harvnb|Scholes|1977}}; {{harvnb|Latham|2002b}}). The first coherent system of rhythmic notation in modern Western music was based on [[rhythmic mode]]s derived from the [[Foot (prosody)|basic types]] of [[Meter (poetry)|metrical]] unit in the [[quantitative meter]] of [[Classics|classical]] [[ancient Greek poetry|ancient Greek]] and [[Latin poetry]] {{harv|Hoppin|1978|loc=221}}.\n\nLater music for [[Renaissance dance|dances]] such as the [[pavane]] and [[galliard]] consisted of [[musical phrase]]s to accompany a [[Dance move|fixed sequence]] of [[Basic (dance move)|basic steps]] with a defined tempo and [[time signature]]. The English word \"measure\", originally an exact or just amount of time, came to denote either a poetic rhythm, a bar of music, or else an entire melodic verse or dance {{harv|Merriam-Webster|2015}} involving sequences of notes, words, or movements that may last four, eight or sixteen bars.\n\nMeter is related to and distinguished from pulse, rhythm (grouping), and beats: \n{{Quote|Meter is the measurement of the number of pulses between more or less regularly recurring accents.<!--3--> Therefore, in order for meter to exist, some of the pulses in a series must be accented\u2014marked for consciousness\u2014relative to others.<!--4--> When pulses are thus counted within a metric context, they are referred to as ''beats''.{{harv|Cooper and Meyer|1960|p=3}}}}\n\n==Metric structure==\n<!--[[Subdivision (meter)]], [[Subdivision (music)]], [[Division level]], [[Metric hierarchy]], and [[multiple level]] redirect directly here-->\n\nThe term ''metre'' is not very precisely defined ({{harvnb|Scholes|1977}}). [[Stewart Macpherson|Stewart MacPherson]] preferred to speak of \"time\" and \"rhythmic shape\" ({{harvtxt|MacPherson|1930|loc=3}}), while [[Imogen Holst]] preferred \"measured rhythm\" ({{harvtxt|Holst|1963|loc=17}}). However, Justin London has written a book about musical metre, which \"involves our initial perception as well as subsequent anticipation of a series of beats that we abstract from the rhythm surface of the music as it unfolds in time\" ({{harvnb|London|2004|loc=4}}). This \"perception\" and \"abstraction\" of rhythmic bar is the foundation of human instinctive musical participation, as when we divide a series of identical clock-ticks into \"tick\u2013tock\u2013tick\u2013tock\" ({{harvnb|Scholes|1977}}). \"Rhythms of recurrence\" arise from the interaction of two levels of motion, the faster providing the pulse and the slower organizing the beats into repetitive groups ({{harvnb|Yeston|1976|loc=50&ndash;52}}). In his book ''The Rhythms of Tonal Music'', Joel Lester notes that, \"[o]nce a metric hierarchy has been established, we, as listeners, will maintain that organization as long as minimal evidence is present\" ({{harvnb|Lester|1986|loc=77}}).\n\n[[File:Metric levels.svg|thumb|350px|left|Metric levels: beat level shown in middle with division levels above and multiple levels below.]]\n\"''Meter'' may be defined as a regular, recurring pattern of strong and weak beats. This recurring pattern of durations is identified at the beginning of a composition by a meter signature (time signature). ... Although meter is generally indicated by time signatures, it is important to realize that meter is not simply a matter of notation\" {{harv|Benward and Saker|2003|loc=9}}. A definition of musical metre requires the possibility of identifying a repeating pattern of accented pulses \u2013 a \"pulse-group\" \u2014 which corresponds to the [[foot (poetry)|foot]] in poetry. Frequently a pulse-group can be identified by taking the accented beat as the first pulse in the group and counting the pulses until the next accent ({{harvnb|MacPherson|1930|loc=5}}; {{harvnb|Scholes|1977}}). Frequently metres can be broken down into a pattern of duples and triples ({{harvnb|MacPherson|1930|loc=5}}; {{harvnb|Scholes|1977}}).\n\nThe level of musical organisation implied by musical metre includes the most elementary levels of [[form (music)|musical form]] ({{harvnb|MacPherson|1930|loc=3}}).\n\nMetrical rhythm, measured rhythm, and free rhythm are general classes of rhythm and may be distinguished in all aspects of temporality ({{harvnb|Cooper|1973|loc=30}}): \n* '''Metrical rhythm''', by far the most common class in Western music, is where each time value is a multiple or fraction of a fixed unit (beat, see paragraph below), and normal [[Accent (music)|accents]] reoccur regularly, providing systematic grouping ([[Bar (music)|bars]], [[divisive rhythm]]).\n* '''Measured rhythm''' is where each time value is a multiple or fraction of a specified time unit but there are not regularly recurring accents ([[additive rhythm]]).\n* [[Free time (music)|'''Free rhythm''']] is where there is neither.\nSome music, including [[chant]], has freer rhythm, like the rhythm of prose compared to that of verse ({{harvnb|Scholes|1977}}). Some music, such as some graphically scored works since the 1950s and non-European music such as [[Honkyoku]] repertoire for [[shakuhachi]], may be considered '''ametric''' ({{harvnb|Karpinski|2000|loc=19}}). The music term ''senza misura'' is Italian for \"without metre\", meaning to play without a beat, using [[time]] to bar how long it will take to play the bar ({{harvnb|Forney and Machlis|2007|loc={{Page needed|date=December 2009}}}}).\n\n'''Metric structure''' includes metre, [[tempo]], and all [[rhythm]]ic aspects that produce temporal regularity or structure, against which the foreground details or [[Duration (music)|durational pattern]]s of any piece of music are projected ({{harvnb|Wittlich|1975|loc=chapt. 3}}). '''Metric levels''' may be distinguished: the [[beat level]] is the metric level at which pulses are heard as the basic time unit of the piece. Faster levels are '''division levels''', and slower levels are '''multiple levels''' ({{harvnb|Wittlich|1975|loc=chapt. 3}}). A [[rhythmic unit]] is a durational pattern which occupies a period of time equivalent to a pulse or pulses on an underlying metric level.\n\n==Frequently encountered types of metre==\n{{anchor|Frequently encountered types of meter}}\n\n===Metres classified by the number of beats per measure===\n{{anchor|Meters classified by the number of beats per measure}}\n\n====Duple and quadruple metre====\n{{anchor|Duple and quadruple meter}}\nIn [[duple metre]], each [[bar (music)|measure]] is divided into two [[beat (music)|beats]], or a multiple thereof ([[Quadruple meter|quadruple metre]]).\n\nFor example, in the time signature {{music|time|2|4}}, each bar contains two (2) [[Quarter note|quarter-note]] (4) beats.

Higher meters which ''are'' divisible by 2 or 3 are considered equivalent to groupings of tuple or triple meter measures, thus, {{music|time|6|4}}, for example, is rarely used because it is considered equivalent to two measures of {{music|time|3|4}}. See: [[hypermetre]] and [[additive rhythm and divisive rhythm]].\n\nHigher metres are used more commonly in analysis, if not performance, of [[cross-rhythm]]s, as lowest number possible which may be used to count a [[polyrhythm]] is the [[lowest common denominator]] (LCD) of the two or more metric divisions. For example, much African music is recorded in Western notation as being in {{music|time|12|8}}, the LCD of 4 and 3.\n\n===Metres classified by the subdivisions of a beat===\n{{anchor|Meters classified by the subdivisions of a beat}}\nSimple metre and compound metre are distinguished by the way the beats are subdivided.\n====Simple metre====<!--[[Simple meter]] redirects here-->\n{{anchor|Simple meter}}\nSimple metre (or simple time) is a metre in which each beat of the bar divides naturally into two (as opposed to three) equal parts.

More specifically, it is a simple ''triple'' metre because there are three beats in each measure; simple duple (two beats) or simple quadruple (four) are also common metres.\n\n:{|\n|<score vorbis=\"1\" override_midi=\"Simple duple drum pattern.mid\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    \\new Staff <<\n       \\new voice \\relative c' {\n           \\clef percussion\n           \\numericTimeSignature\n           \\time 2/4\n           \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 100\n           \\stemDown \\repeat volta 2 { g4 d' }\n       }\n       \\new voice \\relative c'' {\n           \\override NoteHead.style = #'cross\n           \\stemUp \\repeat volta 2 { a8 a a a }\n       }\n   >></score>\n|<score vorbis=\"1\" override_midi=\"Simple triple drum pattern.mid\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    \\new Staff <<\n       \\new voice \\relative c' {\n           \\clef percussion\n           \\numericTimeSignature\n           \\time 3/4\n           \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 100\n           \\stemDown \\repeat volta 2 { g4 d' d }\n       }\n       \\new voice \\relative c'' {\n           \\override NoteHead.style = #'cross\n           \\stemUp \\repeat volta 2 { a8[ a] a[ a] a[ a] }\n       }\n   >></score>\n|<score vorbis=\"1\" override_midi=\"Characteristic rock drum pattern.mid\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    \\new Staff <<\n       \\new voice \\relative c' {\n           \\clef percussion\n           \\numericTimeSignature\n           \\time 4/4\n           \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 100\n           \\stemDown \\repeat volta 2 { g4 d' g, d' }\n       }\n       \\new voice \\relative c'' {\n           \\override NoteHead.style = #'cross\n           \\stemUp \\repeat volta 2 { a8 a a a a a a a }\n       }\n   >></score>\n|}\n\n====Compound metre==== <!-- Compound_meter page links directly to here -->\n{{anchor|Compound meter}}\nCompound metre (or compound time), is a metre in which each beat of the bar divides naturally into three equal parts.

The top number in the time signature will be 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24, etc.\n\nCompound metres are written with a time signature that shows the number of ''divisions'' of beats in each bar as opposed to the number of beats. For example, compound duple (two beats, each divided into three) is written as a time signature with a numerator of six, for example, {{music|time|6|8}}. Contrast this with the time signature {{music|time|3|4}}, which also assigns six eighth notes to each measure, but by convention connotes a simple triple time: 3 quarter-note beats.\n\nExamples of compound metre include {{music|time|6|8}} (compound duple metre), {{music|time|9|8}} (compound triple metre), and {{music|time|12|8}} (compound quadruple metre).\n\n::{|\n|<score vorbis=\"1\" override_midi=\"Compound duple drum pattern.mid\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   \\new Staff <<\n       \\new voice \\relative c' {\n           \\clef percussion\n           \\numericTimeSignature\n           \\time 6/8\n           \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4. = 80\n           \\stemDown \\repeat volta 2 { g4. d' }\n       }\n       \\new voice \\relative c'' {\n           \\override NoteHead.style = #'cross\n           \\stemUp \\repeat volta 2 { a8 a a a a a }\n       }\n   >></score>\n|<score vorbis=\"1\" override_midi=\"Compound triple drum pattern.mid\" lang=\"lilypond\">    \\new Staff <<\n       \\new voice \\relative c' {\n           \\clef percussion\n           \\numericTimeSignature\n           \\time 9/8\n           \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4. = 80\n           \\stemDown \\repeat volta 2 { g4. d' d }\n       }\n       \\new voice \\relative c'' {\n           \\override NoteHead.style = #'cross\n           \\stemUp \\repeat volta 2 { a8 a a a a a a a a }\n       }\n   >></score>\n|<score vorbis=\"1\" override_midi=\"Compound quadruple drum pattern.mid\" lang=\"lilypond\">    \\new Staff <<\n       \\new voice \\relative c' {\n           \\clef percussion\n           \\numericTimeSignature\n           \\time 12/8\n           \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4. = 80\n           \\stemDown \\repeat volta 2 { g4. d' g, d' }\n       }\n       \\new voice \\relative c'' {\n           \\override NoteHead.style = #'cross\n           \\stemUp \\repeat volta 2 { a8 a a a a a a a a a a a }\n       }\n   >></score>\n|}\n\nAlthough {{music|time|3|4}} and {{music|time|6|8}} are not to be confused, they use bars of the same length, so it is easy to \"slip\" between them just by shifting the location of the accents. This interpretational switch has been exploited, for example, by [[Leonard Bernstein]], in the song \"[[America (Leonard Bernstein song)|America]]\":\n[[File:Alternating time signatures2.gif|center|thumb|340x340px|\"I like to be in A-mer-i-ca\" from ''West Side Story'' {{audio|Alternating time signatures2.mid|Play}}.]]\n\nCompound metre divided into three parts could theoretically be transcribed into musically equivalent simple metre using [[tuplet|triplets]]. Likewise, simple metre can be shown in compound through duples. In practice, however, this is rarely done because it disrupts [[Beat pattern|conducting patterns]] when the [[tempo]] changes.  When conducting in {{music|time|6|8}}, conductors typically provide two beats per bar; however, all six beats may be performed when the tempo is very slow.\n\nCompound time is associated with \"lilting\" and dancelike qualities. Folk dances often use compound time. Many [[Baroque dance]]s are often in compound time: some [[gigue]]s, the [[courante]], and sometimes the [[passepied]] and the [[siciliana]].\n\n==Metre in song==\n{{anchor|Meter in song}}\n[[File:3Chinesen.png|thumb|left|400x400px|A German children's song shows a common fourfold multiplication of rhythmic phrases into a complete verse and melody. {{audio|3Chinesen.mid|Play}}]]\n\nThe concept of metre in music derives in large part from the [[meter (poetry)|poetic metre]] of [[song]] and includes not only the basic rhythm of the foot, pulse-group or '''figure''' used but also the [[rhythm]]ic or [[Form (music)|formal]] arrangement of such figures into musical phrases (lines, couplets) and of such phrases into melodies, passages or sections (stanzas, verses) to give what {{harvtxt|Holst|1963|loc=18}} calls \"the time pattern of any song\" (''See also:'' [[Musical form#Levels of organization|Form of a musical passage]]).\n\nTraditional and popular songs may draw heavily upon a limited range of metres, leading to interchangeability of melodies. Early [[hymnal]]s commonly did not include musical notation but simply texts that could be sung to any tune known by the singers that had a matching metre. For example, [[The Blind Boys of Alabama]] rendered the [[hymn]] \"[[Amazing Grace]]\" to the setting of [[The Animals]]' version of the [[folk song]] \"[[The House of the Rising Sun]]\". This is possible because the texts share a popular basic four-line ([[quatrain]]) [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]-form called ''[[ballad]] metre'' or, in hymnals, [[Meter (hymn)|''common metre'']], the four lines having a syllable-count of 8\u20136\u20138\u20136 (Hymns Ancient and Modern Revised), the rhyme-scheme usually following suit: ABAB. There is generally a pause in the melody in a [[cadence (music)|cadence]] at the end of the shorter lines so that the underlying musical metre is 8\u20138\u20138\u20138 beats, the cadences dividing this musically into two symmetrical \"normal\" phrases of four bars each ({{harvnb|MacPherson|1930|loc=14}}).\n\nIn some regional music, for example [[Music of Southeastern Europe|Balkan music]] (like [[Bulgarian dances|Bulgarian music]], and the Macedonian [[Leventikos|{{serif|'''3+2+2+3+2'''}}]] metre), a wealth of irregular or compound metres are used. Other terms for this are \"additive metre\" ({{harvnb|London|2001|loc=\u00a7I.8}}) and \"imperfect time\" ({{harvnb|Read|1964|loc=147{{Failed verification|date=August 2013}}<!--Read is evidently the intended source, but his use of \"imperfect time\" does not correspond exactly to this description of additive (or aksak) metres, nor does he mention music of the Balkans at all.-->}}).\n\n==Metre in dance music==\n{{anchor|Meter in dance music}}\n[[File:Waltz rhythms.PNG|right|thumb|400px|Typical figures of the waltz rhythm {{harv|Scruton|1997}}]]\n[[File:Gavotte rhythm.png|right|thumb|300x300px]]\n{{listen\n | header = From ''[[Terpsichore (1612)|Terpsichore]]'' <br/>([[Michael Praetorius]], 1612):\n | filename    = Dances from Terpsichore - 6.

Such figures may then be \"amalgamated\" to create a series of movements that may synchronise to an entire musical section or piece. This can be thought of as an equivalent of [[prosody (poetry)|prosody]] (see also: [[prosody (music)]]).\n\n==Metre in classical music==\n{{anchor|Meter in classical music}}\nIn music of the [[common practice period]] (about 1600&ndash;1900), there are four different families of time signature in common use:\n*'''[[Metre (music)#Simple metre|Simple]] [[Duple meter|duple]]''': two or four beats to a bar, each divided by two, the top number being \"2\" or \"4\" ({{music|time|2|4}}, {{music|time|2|8}}, {{music|time|2|2}} ... {{music|time|4|4}}, {{music|time|4|8}}, {{music|time|4|2}} ...). When there are four beats to a bar, it is alternatively referred to as \"quadruple\" time.\n*'''Simple [[triple metre|triple]]''': three beats to a bar, each divided by two, the top number being \"3\" ({{music|time|3|4}}, {{music|time|3|8}}, {{music|time|3|2}} ...)\n*'''[[Metre (music)#Compound metre|Compound]] duple''': two beats to a bar, each divided by three, the top number being \"6\" ({{music|time|6|8}}, {{music|time|6|16}}, {{music|time|6|4}} ...)\n*'''Compound triple''': three beats to a bar, each divided by three, the top number being \"9\" ({{music|time|9|8}}, {{music|time|9|16}}, {{music|time|9|4}})\n\nIf the beat is divided into two the metre is ''simple'', if divided into three it is ''compound''. If each bar is divided into two it is ''duple'' and if into three it is ''triple''. Some people also label quadruple, while some consider it as two duples. Any other division is considered additively, as a bar of five beats may be broken into duple+triple (12123) or triple+duple (12312) depending on accent. However, in some music, especially at faster tempos, it may be treated as one unit of five.\n\n===Changing metre===\n{{anchor|Changing meter}}\nIn [[20th-century classical music|20th-century concert music]], it became more common to switch metre\u2014the end of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (shown below) is an example.

[[Bar (music)#Hypermeasure|Hypermeasures]] consist of [[hyperbeat]]s ({{harvnb|Stein|2005|loc=329}}). \"Hypermeter is meter, with all its inherent characteristics, at the level where bars act as beats\" {{harv|Neal|2000|loc=115}}. For example, the four-bar hypermeasures are the prototypical structure for [[country music]], in and against which country songs work {{harv|Neal|2000|loc=115}}. In some styles, two- and four-bar hypermetres are common.\n\nThe term was coined, together with \"hypermeasures\", by [[Edward T. Cone|Edward T.]] {{harvtxt|Cone|1968}}, who regarded it as applying to a relatively small scale, conceiving of a still larger kind of gestural \"rhythm\" imparting a sense of \"an extended upbeat followed by its downbeat\" {{harv|Berry and Van Solkema|2013|loc=\u00a75(vi)}}. {{harvtxt|London|2012|loc=25}} contends that in terms of multiple and simultaneous levels of metrical \"entrainment\" (evenly spaced temporal events \"that we internalize and come to expect\", p.&nbsp;9), there is no in-principle distinction between metre and hypermetre; instead, they are the same phenomenon occurring at different levels.\n\n{{harvtxt|Lee|1985}}{{vn|date=August 2013}} and Middleton have described musical metre in terms of [[deep structure]], using [[generative grammar|generative]] concepts to show how different metres ({{music|time|4|4}}, {{music|time|3|4}}, etc.) generate many different surface rhythms. For example, the first phrase of [[The Beatles]]' \"[[A Hard Day's Night (song)|A Hard Day's Night]]\", excluding the [[syncopation]] on \"night\", may be generated from its metre of {{music|time|4|4}}\n{{harv|Middleton|1990|loc=211}}:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" width=\"33%\" |{{music|time|4|4}}\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" width=\"33%\"  |{{music|time|4|4}}\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" width=\"34%\"  |{{music|time|4|4}}\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|time|2|4}}\n|colspan=4 align=\"center\"|{{music|time|2|4}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|time|2|4}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|time|2|4}}\n| align=\"center\" width=\"17%\" |{{music|time|2|4}}\n| align=\"center\" width=\"17%\" |{{music|time|2|4}}\n|-\n|\n|colspan=2 align=\"center\"|{{music|time|1|4}}\n|colspan=2 align=\"center\"|{{music|time|1|4}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|time|1|8}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|time|1|8}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|time|1|8}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|time|1|8}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|halfrest}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|eighthrest}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|eighthnote}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|eighthnote}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|eighthnote}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|halfnote}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|halfnote}}\n| align=\"center\" |{{music|halfnote}}\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\" |It's\n| align=\"center\" |been\n| align=\"center\" |a\n| align=\"center\" |hard\n| align=\"center\" |day's\n| align=\"center\" |night...\n|\n|}\nThe syncopation may then be added, moving \"night\" forward one eighth note, and the first phrase is generated ({{audio|A Hard Day's Night opening phrase.mid|Play}}).\n\n==Polymetre==\n{{anchor|Polymeter}}\n{{see also|Polyrhythm}}\n\nWith '''polymetre''', the bar sizes differ, but the beat remains constant. Since the beat is the same, the various metres eventually agree. (Four bars of {{music|time|7|4}} = seven bars of {{music|time|4|4}}). An example is the second moment, titled \"Scherzo polimetrico\", of [[Edmund Rubbra]]'s Second String Quartet (1951), in which a constant triplet texture holds together overlapping bars of {{music|time|9|8}}, {{music|time|12|8}}, and {{music|time|21|8}}, and barlines rarely coincide in all four instruments {{harv|Rubbra|1953|loc=41}}.\n\nWith [[polyrhythm]], the number of beats varies within a fixed bar length. For example, in a 4:3 polyrhythm, one part plays {{music|time|4|4}} while the other plays {{music|time|3|4}}, but the {{music|time|3|4}} beats are stretched so that three beats of {{music|time|3|4}} are played in the same time as four beats of {{music|time|4|4}}.\n\nMore generally, sometimes rhythms are combined in a way that is neither tactus nor bar preserving\u2014the beat differs and the bar size also differs. See [[Polytempo|Polytempi]].\n\nResearch into the perception of polymetre shows that listeners often either extract a composite pattern that is fitted to a metric framework, or focus on one rhythmic stream while treating others as \"noise\". This is consistent with the [[Gestalt psychology]] tenet that \"the [[figure-ground (perception)|figure\u2013ground]] dichotomy is fundamental to all perception\" ({{harvnb|Boring|1942|loc=253}};{{vn|date=August 2013}} {{harvnb|London|2004|loc=49\u201350}}). In the music, the two metres will meet each other after a specific number of beats. For example, a {{music|time|3|4}} metre and {{music|time|4|4}} metre will meet after 12 beats.\n\n<!--This paragraph is in danger of becoming a trivia list. There are hundreds, possibly thousands of popular-music bands who have used polyrhythm. Please think twice before adding more.-->In \"Toads of the Short Forest\" (from the album ''[[Weasels Ripped My Flesh]]''), composer [[Frank Zappa]] explains: \"At this very moment on stage we have drummer A playing in {{music|time|7|8}}, drummer B playing in {{music|time|3|4}}, the bass playing in {{music|time|3|4}}, the organ playing in {{music|time|5|8}}, the tambourine playing in {{music|time|3|4}},{{Clarify|date=June 2015}}<!--How can this be describing a common beat with different-length bars? surely the players in {{music|time|7|8}} and {{music|time|5|8}} metres must be using a different counting unit from the ones in {{music|time|3|4}}.--> and the alto sax blowing his nose\" {{harv|Mothers of Invention|1970}}. \"Touch And Go\", a [[The Cars discography|hit single]] by [[The Cars]], has polymetric verses, with the drums and bass playing in {{music|time|5|4}}, while the guitar, synthesizer, and vocals are in {{music|time|4|4}} (the choruses are entirely in {{music|time|4|4}}) {{harv|Cars|1981|loc=15}}. [[Magma (band)|Magma]] uses extensively {{music|time|7|8}} on {{music|time|2|4}} (e.g. [[M\u00ebkan\u00efk D\u00ebstrukt\u00ef\u1e81 K\u00f6mmand\u00f6h]]) and some other combinations. [[King Crimson]]'s albums of the eighties have several songs that use polymetre of various combinations.\n\nPolymetres are a defining characteristic of the [[djent]] subgenre of metal, first pioneered by The Swedish metal band [[Meshuggah]] frequent use of polymetres, with unconventionally timed rhythm figures cycling over a {{music|time|4|4}} base ({{harvnb|Pieslak|2007}}).\n\n===Examples===\n'''Polymetres\u2014video'''\n{|\n| [[File:Polymeter-5c4.ogv|thumb|none|133px|Beat-preserving polymetre {{music|time|5|4}} with {{music|time|4|4}}]]\n| [[File:Polymeter-5c3.ogv|thumb|none|133px|Beat-preserving polymetre {{music|time|5|4}} with {{music|time|3|4}}]]\n| [[File:Polymeter-3c4.theora.ogv|thumb|none|133px|Measure-preserving polyrhythm {{music|time|3|4}} with {{music|time|4|4}}]]\n|-\n| [[File:Polymeter-2o4c3o8.ogv|thumb|none|133px|Beat-preserving polymetre {{music|time|2|4}} with {{music|time|3|8}}]]\n| [[File:Polymeter-4o4c5o8.ogv|thumb|none|133px|Beat-preserving polymetre {{music|time|4|4}} with {{music|time|5|8}}]]\n| [[File:Polymeter-4o4c7o8.ogv|thumb|none|133px|Beat-preserving polymetre {{music|time|4|4}} with {{music|time|7|8}}]]\n|-\n|[[File:Polyrhythm3c2.theora.ogv|thumb|none|133px|Measure-preserving polyrhythm 2:3]]\n| [[File:Polyrhythm4c3.theora.ogv|thumb|none|133px|Measure-preserving polyrhythm 4:3]]\n| [[File:Polyrhythm-5 o 4 with 4 o 4 simultaneously.ogv|thumb|none|133px|Measure-preserving polyrhythm 5:4]]\n|}\n'''Various metres\u2014video'''\n{|\n| [[File:Video of 6o8 at 90 bpm.ogv|thumb|none|133px|{{music|time|6|8}} at tempo of 90&nbsp;bpm]]\n| [[File:Video for 9o8 at 90 bpm.ogv|thumb|none|133px|{{music|time|9|8}} at tempo of 90&nbsp;bpm]]\n| [[File:Video for 12o8 at 90 bpm.ogv|thumb|none|133px|{{music|time|12|8}} at tempo of 90&nbsp;bpm]]\n|-\n| [[File:Video for 2o4 at 60 bpm.ogv|thumb|none|133px|{{music|time|2|4}} at a tempo of 60&nbsp;bpm]]\n| [[File:Video for 3o4 at 60 bpm.ogv|thumb|none|133px|{{music|time|3|4}} at a tempo of 60&nbsp;bpm]]\n| [[File:Video for 4o4 at 60 bpm.ogv|thumb|none|133px|{{music|time|4|4}} at a tempo of 60&nbsp;bpm]]\n|}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Metre (hymn)]]\n* [[Metre (poetry)]]\n* [[Triple metre]]\n* [[Duple and quadruple metre]]\n* [[Sextuple metre]]\n* [[Composite rhythm]]\n* [[Counting (music)]]\n* [[Hymns and hymn tunes]]\n* [[Hymn tune]]\n* [[List of musical works in unusual time signatures]]\n* [[Tala (music)|Tala]]\n* [[Tuplet]]\n* [[Rhythm in Arabian music|Wazn]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Commons category|Rhythm and meter}}\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Anon.|1999}}|reference=Anon.

On October 20, 1975, five days before the start of the 1975\u201376 regular season, the ABA folded the Baltimore Claws.\n\n==Regular season==\n\nThe Claws folded prior to the start of the regular season.\n\n===Roster===\n\n* [[George Carter (basketball)|George Carter]]\n* [[Mel Daniels]]\n* [[Scott English (basketball)|Scott English]]\n* [[Joe Hamilton (basketball)|Joe Hamilton]]\n* [[Stew Johnson]]\n* [[Bob Rhodes]]\n* [[Dave Robisch]]\n* [[Skip Rozenski]]\n* [[Paul Ruffner]]\n* [[Ron Styles]]\n* [[Claude Terry]]\n* [[Tim VanBlommesteyn]]\n* [[Chuck Williams (basketball)|Chuck Williams]]\n* [[Skip Wise]]\n\nThe above would have been the Baltimore Claws' regular season roster had the team continued into regular season play.\n\n===Season standings===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ '''1975-76 ABA Final Standings'''\n!

Some 1.7 million workers went out, especially in transport and heavy industry. The government was prepared and enlisted middle class volunteers to maintain essential services.  There was little violence and the TUC gave up in defeat. Though nine days in, the TUC leadership knew 'the government could hold out longer than the workers', it was perceived at the time as a 'brilliant failure'. According to a leading [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] researcher, Walter Milne-Bailey, 'There has never been a more amazing display of labour solidarity and the effect of such a demonstration must inevitably be deep and enduring. Workers have learnt a new sense of their oneness and their power.'<ref>W Milne-Bailey, ''A Nation on Strike'' (1926) Unpublished typescript, TUC Library, London Metropolitan University</ref> In the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]], the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] won more seats than any other party in Parliament for the first time in its history.\n\n==Causes==\n[[File:The Subsidised Mineowner.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Subsidised Mineowner\u2014Poor Beggar!'' from ''Trade Union Unity Magazine'' (1925)]]\n* The [[First World War]]: The heavy domestic use of coal in the war meant that rich seams were depleted.

Coupled with the prospect of longer [[working time|working hours]], the industry was thrown into disarray.\n* Miners' pay had been lowered from \u00a36.00 to \u00a33.90 over seven years.\n\n[[File:Special Committee of the General Council of the Trades Union Congress.jpg|thumb|right|Special Committee of the General Council of the Trades Union Congress at Downing Street, ready to discuss the mining crisis with Baldwin]]\nMine owners announced that their intention was to reduce miners' wages. The [[Miners Federation of Great Britain]] rejected the terms: \"Not a penny off the pay, not a minute on the day.\" The [[Trades Union Congress]] responded to the news by promising to support the miners in their dispute. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative government]], under [[Stanley Baldwin]], decided to intervene by declaring that a nine-month subsidy would be provided to maintain the miners' wages and that a [[Royal Commission]], under the chairmanship of [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Sir Herbert Samuel]], would look into the problems of the mining industry and consider its impact on other industries, families and organisations dependent on coal supplies industry.\n\nThe [[Samuel Commission]] published a report on 10 March 1926 recommending that national agreements, the [[nationalisation]] of royalties and sweeping reorganisation and improvement should be considered for the mining industry.<ref>Robertson, D.

'A Narrative of the General Strike of 1926' ''The Economic Journal '' Vol. 36, no. 143 (September 1926) p.376</ref> It also recommended a reduction by 13.5% of miners' wages, along with the withdrawal of the government subsidy.<ref>Griffiths, D.

During the next two days, frantic efforts were made to reach an agreement between the government and the mining industry representatives. However, they failed, mainly because<ref>Keith Laybourn (1993). The General Strike of 1926. Manchester UP. p. 43</ref> of an eleventh-hour decision by printers of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' to refuse to print an editorial (\"For King and Country\") condemning the general strike. They objected to the following passage: \"A general strike is not an industrial dispute. It is a revolutionary move which can only succeed by destroying the government and subverting the rights and liberties of the people\".\n[[File:Genral Strike 1926.jpg|thumb|left|Troops on guard at a bus station; each bus had a police escort during the strike]]\nBaldwin was now concerned about the TUC and printers' action interfering with the freedom of the press.\n\nKing [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] tried to stabilise the situation and create balance saying, \"Try living on their wages before you judge them.\"<ref>David Sinclair, ''Two Georges: The Making of the Modern Monarchy.'' London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1988. p. 105.</ref>\n\nThe TUC feared that an all-out general strike would bring revolutionary elements to the fore and limited the participants to [[National Union of Railwaymen|railwaymen]], [[National Transport Workers' Federation|transport workers]], [[Printer (publisher)|printer]]s, [[Transport and General Workers' Union|dockers]], [[ironworker]]s and [[steelworker]]s, as they were regarded as pivotal in the dispute.\n\nThe government had been preparing for the strike over the nine months in which it had provided a subsidy by creating organisations such as the [[Organisation for the Maintenance of Supplies]], and it did whatever it could to keep the country moving. It rallied support by emphasizing the revolutionary nature of the strikers. The armed forces and volunteer workers helped maintain basic services. It used the [[Emergency Powers Act 1920]] to maintain essential supplies.\n\nOn 4 May 1926, the number of strikers was about 1.5\u20131.75 million. There were strikers \"[[Land's End to John o' Groats|from John o' Groats to Land's End]]\". The reaction to the strike call was immediate and overwhelming and surprised both the government and the TUC; the latter not being in control of the strike. On this first day, there were no major initiatives and no dramatic events except for the nation's transport being at a standstill.\n\n{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|salign=right|quote=\u201cConstitutional Government is being attacked. Let all good citizens whose livelihood and labour have thus been put in peril bear with fortitude and patience the hardships with which they have been so suddenly confronted.

The laws of England are the people's birthright. The laws are in your keeping. You have made Parliament their guardian. The General Strike is a challenge to Parliament and is the road to anarchy and ruin.\u201d|source=[[Stanley Baldwin]], 6 May 1926, ''[[British Gazette]]''}}\nOn 5 May 1926, both sides gave their views. Churchill (at that time [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]) commented as editor of the government newspaper ''[[British Gazette]]'': \"I do not agree that the TUC have as much right as the Government to publish their side of the case and to exhort their followers to continue action. It is a very much more difficult task to feed the nation than it is to wreck it\". Baldwin wrote, \"The general strike is a challenge to the parliament and is the road to [[anarchy]]\". The ''[[British Worker]]'', the TUC's newspaper, wrote: \"We are not making war on the people. We are anxious that the ordinary members of the public shall not be penalized for the unpatriotic conduct of the mine owners and the government\".\n\nIn the meantime, the government put in place a \"[[militia]]\" of [[special constable]]s called the Organisation for the Maintenance of Supplies (OMS) of volunteers to maintain order in the street. A special constable said: \"It was not difficult to understand the strikers' attitude toward us. After a few days I found my sympathy with them rather than with the employers. For one thing, I had never realized the appalling poverty which existed. If I had been aware of all the facts, I should not have joined up as a special constable\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nottinghamshireexminer.com/Nottinghamshire-NUM-Area-History |title=Nottinghamshire NUM Area History |publisher=Nottinghamshireexminer.com |accessdate=2010-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714201312/http://www.nottinghamshireexminer.com/Nottinghamshire-NUM-Area-History |archive-date=14 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It was decided that [[fascists]] would not be allowed to enlist in the OMS without first giving up their political beliefs, as the government feared a right-wing backlash so the fascists formed the so-called \"Q Division\" under [[Rotha Lintorn-Orman]] to combat the strikers.\n\nOn 6 May 1926, there was a change of atmosphere. The government newspaper, ''[[British Gazette]]'', suggested that means of transport began to improve with volunteers and [[strikebreakers]], stating on the front page that there were '200 buses on the streets'.<ref>'Why Walk to Work?' ''British Worker'' Issue 2 (6 May 1926), p.1</ref> They were, however, figures of propaganda, as there were in fact only 86 buses running.<ref>Symons, J. ''The General Strike'' (London: Cresset Press, 1957) pg. 158</ref>\n\nOn 7 May 1926, the TUC met with Samuel and worked out a set of proposals designed to end the dispute. The Miners' Federation rejected the proposals. The ''British Worker'' was increasingly difficult to operate, as Churchill had requisitioned the bulk of the supply of the paper's newsprint so it reduced its size from eight pages to four.<ref>'The British Worker and Paper Supplies,' ''The Times'' (8 May 1926), pg.4</ref> In the meantime, the government took action to protect the men who decided to return to work.\n\nOn 8 May 1926, there was a dramatic moment on the London Docks. Lorries were protected by the army. They broke the picket line and transported food to Hyde Park. That showed that the government was in greater control of the situation. It was also a measure of Baldwin's rationalism, in place of Churchill's more reactionary stance. Churchill had wanted, in a move that could have proved unnecessarily antagonistic to the strikers, to arm the soldiers. Baldwin, however, had insisted otherwise. In Plymouth, tram services are restarted, with some vehicles attacked and windows smashed. However, also in Plymouth, a football match, attended by thousands, occurs between a team of policemen and strikers, with the strikers winning 2\u20130.<ref>[https://warwick.ac.uk/services/library/mrc/explorefurther/digital/gs/timeline/day_5/ General Strike Day 5: Saturday 8 May 1926], University of Warwick, The Library</ref>\n\nOn 11 May 1926, the ''[[Flying Scotsman (train)|Flying Scotsman]]'' was derailed by strikers near [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Patrick|first=Renshaw|title=Nine days in May: the general strike|year=1975|publisher=Taylor & Francis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oJMOAAAAQAAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=RA3-PA5#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9780413332608}}</ref> The ''British Worker'', alarmed at the fears of the General Council of the TUC that there was to be a mass drift back to work, claimed: \"The number of strikers has not diminished; it is increasing.

Mr [[John Meir Astbury|Justice Astbury]] granted the injunction by ruling that no trade dispute could exist between the TUC and \"the government of the nation\"<ref>Lee S. J. 1996 Aspects of British Political History 1914\u20131995 p 90]</ref> and that except for the strike in the coal industry, the general strike was not protected by [[Trade Disputes Act 1906]]. In addition, he ruled that the strike in the plaintiff union had been called in contravention of its own rules.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/789636 \"The Legality of the General Strike in England,\" A.

Goodhart ''The Yale Law Journal'', Vol. 36, No. 4 (February 1927), pp. 464\u2013485 Published by: The Yale Law Journal Company, Inc.]</ref> As a result, the unions involved became liable, by common law, for incitement to breach of contract and faced potential [[sequestration (law)|sequestration]] of their assets by employers.\n\nOn 12 May 1926, the TUC General Council visited [[10 Downing Street]] to announce its decision to call off the strike if the proposals worked out by the Samuel Commission were respected and the government offered a guarantee there would be no victimization of strikers. The government stated that it had \"no power to compel employers to take back every man who had been on strike\". However, the TUC agreed to end the dispute without such an agreement.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe miners maintained resistance for a few months before being forced, by their own economic needs, to return to the mines. By the end of November, most miners were back at work. However, many remained unemployed for many years. Those still employed were forced to accept longer hours, lower wages and district wage agreements. The strikers felt that they had achieved nothing.\n\nThe effect on British coal mines was profound. By the late 1930s, employment in mining had fallen by more than a third from its pre-strike peak of 1.2 million miners, but productivity had rebounded from under 200 tons produced per miner, to over 300 tons by the outbreak of the [[Second World War]].<ref>Mathias, ''The First Industrial Nation,'' pg. 449.</ref>\n\nThe split in the miners that resulted from [[George Alfred Spencer|Spencerism]] and the agreement of the Nottinghamshire miners to return to work, against the policy of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain divided the coal miners as a national bargaining force until the establishment of the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]].\n\nThe [[Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927]] banned [[sympathy strikes]] and mass [[picketing (protest)|picketing]], and created a system whereby trade union members had to 'opt-in' to paying the political levy to the Labour Party.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Oxford AQA history A level and AS component 2.

The TUC and the trade union movement remained intact and did not change their basic policies. Keith Laybourn says that historians mostly agree that \"In no significant way could the General Strike be considered a turning point or watershed in British industrial history.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Keith Laybourn|title=The General Strike of 1926|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VEu8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA103|year=1993|publisher=Manchester UP|page=103|isbn=9780719038655}}</ref>  It was the only general strike in British history, as union leaders such as [[Ernest Bevin]], who had coordinated the strike, considered it a mistake.

There was little violence and the TUC gave up in defeat. Though nine days in, the TUC leadership knew 'the government could hold out longer than the workers', it was perceived at the time as a 'brilliant failure'. According to a leading [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] researcher, Walter Milne-Bailey, 'There has never been a more amazing display of labour solidarity and the effect of such a demonstration must inevitably be deep and enduring.

During the next two days, frantic efforts were made to reach an agreement between the government and the mining industry representatives. However, they failed, mainly because<ref>Keith Laybourn (1993). The General Strike of 1926. Manchester UP. p. 43</ref> of an eleventh-hour decision by printers of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' to refuse to print an editorial (\"For King and Country\") condemning the general strike. They objected to the following passage: \"A general strike is not an industrial dispute. It is a revolutionary move which can only succeed by destroying the government and subverting the rights and liberties of the people\".\n[[File:Genral Strike 1926.jpg|thumb|left|Troops on guard at a bus station; each bus had a police escort during the strike]]\nBaldwin was now concerned about the TUC and printers' action interfering with the freedom of the press.\n\nKing [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] tried to stabilise the situation and create balance saying, \"Try living on their wages before you judge them.\"<ref>David Sinclair, ''Two Georges: The Making of the Modern Monarchy.'' London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1988. p. 105.</ref>\n\nThe TUC feared that an all-out general strike would bring revolutionary elements to the fore and limited the participants to [[National Union of Railwaymen|railwaymen]], [[National Transport Workers' Federation|transport workers]], [[Printer (publisher)|printer]]s, [[Transport and General Workers' Union|dockers]], [[ironworker]]s and [[steelworker]]s, as they were regarded as pivotal in the dispute.\n\nThe government had been preparing for the strike over the nine months in which it had provided a subsidy by creating organisations such as the [[Organisation for the Maintenance of Supplies]], and it did whatever it could to keep the country moving. It rallied support by emphasizing the revolutionary nature of the strikers. The armed forces and volunteer workers helped maintain basic services. It used the [[Emergency Powers Act 1920]] to maintain essential supplies.\n\nOn 4 May 1926, the number of strikers was about 1.5\u20131.75 million. There were strikers \"[[Land's End to John o' Groats|from John o' Groats to Land's End]]\". The reaction to the strike call was immediate and overwhelming and surprised both the government and the TUC; the latter not being in control of the strike. On this first day, there were no major initiatives and no dramatic events except for the nation's transport being at a standstill.\n\n{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|salign=right|quote=\u201cConstitutional Government is being attacked.

The laws of England are the people's birthright. The laws are in your keeping. You have made Parliament their guardian. The General Strike is a challenge to Parliament and is the road to anarchy and ruin.\u201d|source=[[Stanley Baldwin]], 6 May 1926, ''[[British Gazette]]''}}\nOn 5 May 1926, both sides gave their views. Churchill (at that time [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]) commented as editor of the government newspaper ''[[British Gazette]]'': \"I do not agree that the TUC have as much right as the Government to publish their side of the case and to exhort their followers to continue action. It is a very much more difficult task to feed the nation than it is to wreck it\". Baldwin wrote, \"The general strike is a challenge to the parliament and is the road to [[anarchy]]\". The ''[[British Worker]]'', the TUC's newspaper, wrote: \"We are not making war on the people. We are anxious that the ordinary members of the public shall not be penalized for the unpatriotic conduct of the mine owners and the government\".\n\nIn the meantime, the government put in place a \"[[militia]]\" of [[special constable]]s called the Organisation for the Maintenance of Supplies (OMS) of volunteers to maintain order in the street. A special constable said: \"It was not difficult to understand the strikers' attitude toward us. After a few days I found my sympathy with them rather than with the employers. For one thing, I had never realized the appalling poverty which existed. If I had been aware of all the facts, I should not have joined up as a special constable\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nottinghamshireexminer.com/Nottinghamshire-NUM-Area-History |title=Nottinghamshire NUM Area History |publisher=Nottinghamshireexminer.com |accessdate=2010-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714201312/http://www.nottinghamshireexminer.com/Nottinghamshire-NUM-Area-History |archive-date=14 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It was decided that [[fascists]] would not be allowed to enlist in the OMS without first giving up their political beliefs, as the government feared a right-wing backlash so the fascists formed the so-called \"Q Division\" under [[Rotha Lintorn-Orman]] to combat the strikers.\n\nOn 6 May 1926, there was a change of atmosphere. The government newspaper, ''[[British Gazette]]'', suggested that means of transport began to improve with volunteers and [[strikebreakers]], stating on the front page that there were '200 buses on the streets'.<ref>'Why Walk to Work?' ''British Worker'' Issue 2 (6 May 1926), p.1</ref> They were, however, figures of propaganda, as there were in fact only 86 buses running.<ref>Symons, J. ''The General Strike'' (London: Cresset Press, 1957) pg. 158</ref>\n\nOn 7 May 1926, the TUC met with Samuel and worked out a set of proposals designed to end the dispute. The Miners' Federation rejected the proposals. The ''British Worker'' was increasingly difficult to operate, as Churchill had requisitioned the bulk of the supply of the paper's newsprint so it reduced its size from eight pages to four.<ref>'The British Worker and Paper Supplies,' ''The Times'' (8 May 1926), pg.4</ref> In the meantime, the government took action to protect the men who decided to return to work.\n\nOn 8 May 1926, there was a dramatic moment on the London Docks. Lorries were protected by the army. They broke the picket line and transported food to Hyde Park. That showed that the government was in greater control of the situation. It was also a measure of Baldwin's rationalism, in place of Churchill's more reactionary stance. Churchill had wanted, in a move that could have proved unnecessarily antagonistic to the strikers, to arm the soldiers. Baldwin, however, had insisted otherwise. In Plymouth, tram services are restarted, with some vehicles attacked and windows smashed. However, also in Plymouth, a football match, attended by thousands, occurs between a team of policemen and strikers, with the strikers winning 2-0.<ref>[https://warwick.ac.uk/services/library/mrc/explorefurther/digital/gs/timeline/day_5/ General Strike Day 5: Saturday 8 May 1926], University of Warwick, The Library</ref>\n\nOn 11 May 1926, the ''[[Flying Scotsman (train)|Flying Scotsman]]'' was derailed by strikers near [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Patrick|first=Renshaw|title=Nine days in May: the general strike|year=1975|publisher=Taylor & Francis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oJMOAAAAQAAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=RA3-PA5#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9780413332608}}</ref> The ''British Worker'', alarmed at the fears of the General Council of the TUC that there was to be a mass drift back to work, claimed: \"The number of strikers has not diminished; it is increasing.

In addition, he ruled that the strike in the plaintiff union had been called in contravention of its own rules.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/789636 \"The Legality of the General Strike in England,\" A.

The government stated that it had \"no power to compel employers to take back every man who had been on strike\". However, the TUC agreed to end the dispute without such an agreement.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe miners maintained resistance for a few months before being forced, by their own economic needs, to return to the mines. By the end of November, most miners were back at work. However, many remained unemployed for many years. Those still employed were forced to accept longer hours, lower wages and district wage agreements. The strikers felt that they had achieved nothing.\n\nThe effect on British coal mines was profound. By the late 1930s, employment in mining had fallen by more than a third from its pre-strike peak of 1.2 million miners, but productivity had rebounded from under 200 tons produced per miner, to over 300 tons by the outbreak of the [[Second World War]].<ref>Mathias, ''The First Industrial Nation,'' pg. 449.</ref>\n\nThe split in the miners that resulted from [[George Alfred Spencer|Spencerism]] and the agreement of the Nottinghamshire miners to return to work, against the policy of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain divided the coal miners as a national bargaining force until the establishment of the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]].\n\nThe [[Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927]] banned [[sympathy strikes]] and mass [[picketing (protest)|picketing]], and created a system whereby trade union members had to 'opt-in' to paying the political levy to the Labour Party.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Oxford AQA history A level and AS component 2.

The companies were mostly from [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] but also [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]] and [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]].  The First Massachusetts was the first of the Massachusetts regiments recruited for a term of three-years.\n\nOn June 1 the regiment assembled at Camp Ellsworth on the banks of [[Fresh Pond (Cambridge, Massachusetts)|Fresh Pond]] in [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]]. Twelve days later it was transferred to Camp Cameron in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|North Cambridge]].\n\nLeaving Massachusetts June 15, on the 17th it reached Washington<ref name=\"Dyer\" />. Assigned to Richardson's Brigade of Tyler's Division<ref name=\"OoB\" />. , it remained in camp near Washington until the advance to Bull Run where it participated in the battle at Blackburn's Ford, July 18, three days before the main battle of Bull Run.\n\nIn August it became a part of the famous Hooker Brigade. During the fall it was encamped for some time at Bladensburg, did duty on the Potomac above Washington, built Fort Lincoln, moved to Budd's Ferry, and was variously engaged until spring when it became a part of Grover's Brigade, Hooker's Division, Heintzelman's (3d) Corps, and was transferred to the Peninsula.\n\nOn April 6 it was in action before Yorktown, and on May 5 it suffered heavily at Williamsburg. It was encamped in the White Oak Swamp region until June 25 when it was engaged with loss at Fair Oaks. During the Seven Days battles it lost heavily at Glendale, June 30, its major, Charles P. Chandler being killed. After the battle of Malvern Hill it retired to Harrison's Landing where it remained until August when it was ordered back to the defenses of Washington.\n\nJoining Gen. Pope's army near Warrenton Jc., as a part of Grover's Brigade, Hooker's Division, it was in action at Bristoe Station, Aug. 27, and again near Groveton (Manassas), Aug. 29, where it assaulted the celebrated railroad embankment and suffered severe loss. After the campaign was ended the regiment remained in or near the defenses of Washington until the last of October. About this time Gen. Carr succeeded Gen. Grover in command of the brigade. After Fredericksburg, where the regiment suffered slight loss, it went into winter quarters at Acquia Creek on the Potomac\n\nAs a part of Carr's Brigade, Berry's Division, Sickles' (3d) Corps, it lost heavily at Chancellorsville, May 3, 1863, and still more heavily at Gettysburg, July 2, while defending the line of the Emmittsburg road. At Wapping Heights, July 23, in New York City during the late summer and fall, at Kelly's Ford, Nov. 7, and during the Mine Run campaign in the latter part of November the regiment performed valuable service with few casualties.

Robert Cowdin, who became colonel of the 1st Inf. when its organization was completed. .  The companies were mostly from [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] but also [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]] and [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]].  The First Massachusetts was the first of the Massachusetts regiments recruited for a term of three-years.\n\nOn June 1 the regiment assembled at Camp Ellsworth on the banks of [[Fresh Pond (Cambridge, Massachusetts)|Fresh Pond]] in [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]]. Twelve days later it was transferred to Camp Cameron in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|North Cambridge]].\n\nLeaving Massachusetts June 15, on the 17th it reached Washington<ref name=\"Dyer\" />. Assigned to Richardson's Brigade of Tyler's Division<ref name=\"OoB\" />. , it remained in camp near Washington until the advance to Bull Run where it participated in the battle at Blackburn's Ford, July 18, three days before the main battle of Bull Run.\n\nIn August it became a part of the famous Hooker Brigade. During the fall it was encamped for some time at Bladensburg, did duty on the Potomac above Washington, built Fort Lincoln, moved to Budd's Ferry, and was variously engaged until spring when it became a part of Grover's Brigade, Hooker's Division, Heintzelman's (3d) Corps, and was transferred to the Peninsula.\n\nOn April 6 it was in action before Yorktown, and on May 5 it suffered heavily at Williamsburg. It was encamped in the White Oak Swamp region until June 25 when it was engaged with loss at Fair Oaks. During the Seven Days battles it lost heavily at Glendale, June 30, its major, Charles P. Chandler being killed. After the battle of Malvern Hill it retired to Harrison's Landing where it remained until August when it was ordered back to the defenses of Washington.\n\nJoining Gen. Pope's army near Warrenton Jc., as a part of Grover's Brigade, Hooker's Division, it was in action at Bristoe Station, Aug. 27, and again near Groveton (Manassas), Aug. 29, where it assaulted the celebrated railroad embankment and suffered severe loss. After the campaign was ended the regiment remained in or near the defenses of Washington until the last of October. About this time Gen. Carr succeeded Gen. Grover in command of the brigade. After Fredericksburg, where the regiment suffered slight loss, it went into winter quarters at Acquia Creek on the Potomac\n\nAs a part of Carr's Brigade, Berry's Division, Sickles' (3d) Corps, it lost heavily at Chancellorsville, May 3, 1863, and still more heavily at Gettysburg, July 2, while defending the line of the Emmittsburg road. At Wapping Heights, July 23, in New York City during the late summer and fall, at Kelly's Ford, Nov. 7, and during the Mine Run campaign in the latter part of November the regiment performed valuable service with few casualties. The following winter was spent in camp near Brandy Station.\n\nWhen the 3d Corps was broken up in the early spring of 1864 the 1st Regt. became a part of McAllister's Brigade, Mott's Division, Hancock's (2d) Corps.

Coppola cited the 1966 film ''[[Blowup]]'' as a key influence. However, since the film was released to theaters just a few months before [[Richard Nixon]] resigned as President, he felt that audiences interpreted the film to be a reaction to the [[Watergate scandal]]. \n''The Conversation'' has won critical acclaim <ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f92ODOjfukM 'The Conversation'|Critics' Picks|The New York Times on YouTube]</ref> and multiple accolades, including the [[Palme d'Or|Grand Prix du Festival International du Film]], the highest honor at the [[1974 Cannes Film Festival]]. It was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]] in 1974 and lost [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] to ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', another Francis Ford Coppola film. In 1995, it was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\nHarry Caul ([[Gene Hackman]]) is a [[surveillance]] expert who runs his own company in [[San Francisco]]. He is obsessed with his own privacy; his apartment is almost bare behind its triple-locked door and burglar alarm, he uses [[Payphone|pay phones]] to make calls, claims to have no home telephone, and his office is enclosed in wire mesh in a corner of a much larger warehouse. He has no friends, his mistress Amy knows nothing about him, and his one hobby is playing along to [[jazz]] records on a [[tenor saxophone]] in the privacy of his apartment.\n\nCaul insists that he is not responsible for the actual content of the conversations he records or the use to which his clients put his surveillance activities. However, he is racked by guilt over a past wiretap job which resulted in the murder of three people. This sense of guilt is amplified by his devout [[Catholicism]]. \n\nCaul, his colleague Stan and some freelance associates have taken on the task of bugging the conversation of a couple as they walk through crowded [[Union Square, San Francisco|Union Square]] in San Francisco, surrounded by a cacophony of background noise. Amid the small-talk, the couple discuss fears that they are being watched, and mention a discreet meeting at a hotel room in a few days. The challenging task of recording this conversation is accomplished by multiple surveillance operatives located in different positions around the square. After Caul has merged and filtered the different tapes, the final result is a sound recording in which the words themselves are clear, but their meaning remains ambiguous.\n\nWhen the client is not in his office, Caul refuses to leave the tape with the client's assistant. The assistant warns him not to get involved, telling him that the tapes are \"dangerous\". Caul feels increasingly uneasy about what may happen to the couple once the client hears the tape. He plays the tape again and again, gradually refining the recording. Using a [[Filter (signal processing)|filter]], he reveals a key phrase hidden under the sound of a street musician: \"He'd ''kill'' us if he got the chance.\"\n\nCaul avoids handing in the tape to the aide of the man who commissioned the surveillance. Afterward, he finds himself under increasing pressure from the client's aide and is himself followed, tricked, and bugged. The tape of the conversation is eventually stolen from him in a moment when his guard is down. He goes to the client (\"the Director\", played by [[Robert Duvall]]) to find he has received the tapes, and learns that the woman in the recording is the client's wife, apparently having an affair with the other man in the tapes. \n\nCaul books a hotel room next to one mentioned in the recording of the conversation. He uses equipment to overhear the client in a heated argument with his wife. When he goes to the balcony to watch the events through the windows out of curiosity, he sees what he believes to be the wife being murdered and retreats in shock.\n\nCaul later attempts to confront the client, but the client is absent. While departing, Caul catches sight of the wife, alive and unharmed, in a limo. He learns that his client was killed in an \"accident,\" and discovers the truth: the couple were talking about killing the woman's husband, and the murder Caul witnessed was actually that of his client and not the wife. It is revealed to the viewer that the man in the recording actually said, \"He'd kill ''us'' if he got the chance.\"\n\nCaul gets a phone call from his client's assistant, who tells him not to look any further into the matter, and says, \"We'll be listening to you.\" Caul goes on a frantic search for a listening device, tearing up his apartment, to no avail. He sits amid the wreckage, playing the only thing in his apartment left intact: his saxophone.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Gene Hackman]] as Harry Caul\n*[[John Cazale]] as Stan\n*[[Allen Garfield]] as William P. \"Bernie\" Moran\n*[[Cindy Williams]] as Ann\n*[[Frederic Forrest]] as Mark\n*[[Harrison Ford]] as Martin Stett\n*[[Michael Higgins (actor)|Michael Higgins]] as Paul\n*[[Elizabeth MacRae]] as Meredith\n*[[Teri Garr]] as Amy Fredericks\n*Mark Wheeler as Receptionist\n*[[Shields and Yarnell|Robert Shields]] as The Mime\n*Phoebe Alexander as Lurleen\n*[[Robert Duvall]] as The Director<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2002/02/26/the_conversation_1974_review.shtml |title=The Conversation (1974) |last=Hilditch |first=Nick |date=27 February 2002 |accessdate=11 June 2017 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production==\nCoppola has cited [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s ''[[Blowup]]'' (1966) as a key influence on his conceptualization of the film's themes, such as surveillance versus participation, and perception versus reality. \"Francis had seen [it] a year or two before, and had the idea to fuse the concept of ''Blowup'' with the world of audio surveillance.\"{{sfn|Ondaatje|2002|p=152}}\n\nOn the [[DVD]] commentary, Coppola says he was shocked to learn that the film utilized the very same surveillance and wire-tapping equipment that members of the [[Nixon Administration]] used to spy on political opponents prior to the [[Watergate scandal]]. Coppola has said this is the reason the film gained part of the recognition it has received, but that this is entirely coincidental. Not only was the script for ''The Conversation'' completed in the mid-1960s (before the Nixon Administration came to power) but the spying equipment used in the film was discovered through research and the use of technical advisers and not, as many believed, by revelatory newspaper stories about the Watergate break-in. Coppola also noted that filming of ''The Conversation'' had been completed several months before the most revelatory Watergate stories broke in the press. Since the film was released to theaters just a few months before [[Richard Nixon]] resigned as President, Coppola felt that audiences interpreted the film to be a reaction to both the Watergate scandal and its fall-out.\n\nThe original cinematographer of ''The Conversation'' was [[Haskell Wexler]]. Severe creative and personal differences with Coppola led to Wexler's firing shortly after production began and Coppola replaced him with [[Bill Butler (cinematographer)|Bill Butler]]. Wexler's footage on ''The Conversation'' was completely reshot, except for the technically complex surveillance scene in Union Square.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/71469/The-Conversation/articles.html |title=The Conversation (1974) |last=Stafford |first=Jeff |date= |accessdate=11 June 2017 |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]}}</ref> This would be the first of two Oscar-nominated films where Wexler would be fired and replaced by Butler, the second being ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' (1975), where Wexler had similar problems with [[Milo\u0161 Forman]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Townsend |first=Sylvia |title=Haskell Wexler and the Making of \u2018One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\u2019 |date=19 December 2014 |url=http://worldcinemaparadise.com/2014/12/19/haskell-wexler-and-the-making-of-one-flew-over-the-cuckoos-nest/ |accessdate=2 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Walter Murch]] served as the supervising editor and sound designer. Murch had more or less a free hand during the editing process, since Coppola was already working on ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' at the time.{{sfn|Ondaatje|2002|p=157}} Coppola noted in the DVD commentary that Hackman had a very difficult time adapting to the Harry Caul character because it was so much unlike himself. Coppola says that Hackman was at the time an outgoing and approachable person who preferred casual clothes, whereas Caul was meant to be a socially awkward loner who wore a rain coat and out-of-style glasses. Coppola said that Hackman's efforts to tap into the character made the actor moody and irritable on-set but otherwise Coppola got along well with his leading man. Coppola also notes on the commentary that Hackman considers this one of his favorite performances.\n\n''The Conversation'' features a piano score composed and performed by [[David Shire]].

Coppola cited the 1966 film ''[[Blowup]]'' as a key influence. However, since the film was released to theaters just a few months before [[Richard Nixon]] resigned as President, he felt that audiences interpreted the film to be a reaction to the [[Watergate scandal]]. \n''The Conversation'' has won critical acclaim <ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f92ODOjfukM 'The Conversation'|Critics' Picks|The New York Times on YouTube]</ref> and multiple accolades, including the [[Palme d'Or|Grand Prix du Festival International du Film]], the highest honor at the [[1974 Cannes Film Festival]]. It was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]] in 1974 and lost [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] to ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', another Francis Ford Coppola film. In 1995, it was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\nHarry Caul ([[Gene Hackman]]) is a [[surveillance]] expert who runs his own company in [[San Francisco]]. He is obsessed with his own privacy; his apartment is almost bare behind its triple-locked door and burglar alarm, he uses [[Payphone|pay phones]] to make calls, claims to have no home telephone, and his office is enclosed in wire mesh in a corner of a much larger warehouse. He has no friends, his mistress Amy knows nothing about him, and his one hobby is playing along to [[jazz]] records on a [[tenor saxophone]] in the privacy of his apartment.\n\nCaul insists that he is not responsible for the actual content of the conversations he records or the use to which his clients put his surveillance activities. However, he is racked by guilt over a past wiretap job which resulted in the murder of three people. This sense of guilt is amplified by his devout [[Catholicism]]. \n\nCaul, his colleague Stan and some freelance associates have taken on the task of bugging the conversation of a couple as they walk through crowded [[Union Square, San Francisco|Union Square]] in San Francisco, surrounded by a cacophony of background noise. Amid the small-talk, the couple discuss fears that they are being watched, and mention a discreet meeting at a hotel room in a few days. The challenging task of recording this conversation is accomplished by multiple surveillance operatives located in different positions around the square. After Caul has merged and filtered the different tapes, the final result is a sound recording in which the words themselves are clear, but their meaning remains ambiguous.\n\nWhen the client is not in his office, Caul refuses to leave the tape with the client's assistant. The assistant warns him not to get involved, telling him that the tapes are \"dangerous\". Caul feels increasingly uneasy about what may happen to the couple once the client hears the tape. He plays the tape again and again, gradually refining the recording. Using a [[Filter (signal processing)|filter]], he reveals a key phrase hidden under the sound of a street musician: \"He'd ''kill'' us if he got the chance.\"\n\nCaul avoids handing in the tape to the aide of the man who commissioned the surveillance. Afterward, he finds himself under increasing pressure from the client's aide and is himself followed, tricked, and bugged. The tape of the conversation is eventually stolen from him in a moment when his guard is down. He goes to the client (\"the Director\", played by [[Robert Duvall]]) to find he has received the tapes, and learns that the woman in the recording is the client's wife, apparently having an affair with the other man in the tapes. \n\nCaul books a hotel room next to one mentioned in the recording of the conversation. He uses equipment to overhear the client in a heated argument with his wife. When he goes to the balcony to watch the events through the windows out of curiosity, he sees what he believes to be the wife being murdered and retreats in shock.\n\nCaul later attempts to confront the client, but the client is absent. While departing, Caul catches sight of the wife, alive and unharmed, in a limo. He learns that his client was killed in an \"accident,\" and discovers the truth: the couple were talking about killing the woman's husband, and the murder Caul witnessed was actually that of his client and not the wife. It is revealed to the viewer that the man in the recording actually said, \"He'd kill ''us'' if he got the chance.\"\n\nCaul gets a phone call from his client's assistant, who tells him not to look any further into the matter, and says, \"We'll be listening to you.\" Caul goes on a frantic search for a listening device, tearing up his apartment, to no avail. He sits amid the wreckage, playing the only thing in his apartment left intact: his saxophone.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Gene Hackman]] as Harry Caul\n*[[John Cazale]] as Stan\n*[[Allen Garfield]] as William P. \"Bernie\" Moran\n*[[Cindy Williams]] as Ann\n*[[Frederic Forrest]] as Mark\n*[[Harrison Ford]] as Martin Stett\n*[[Michael Higgins (actor)|Michael Higgins]] as Paul\n*[[Elizabeth MacRae]] as Meredith\n*[[Teri Garr]] as Amy Fredericks\n*Mark Wheeler as Receptionist\n*[[Shields and Yarnell|Robert Shields]] as The Mime\n*Phoebe Alexander as Lurleen\n*[[Robert Duvall]] as The Director<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2002/02/26/the_conversation_1974_review.shtml |title=The Conversation (1974) |last=Hilditch |first=Nick |date=27 February 2002 |accessdate=11 June 2017 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production==\nCoppola has cited [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s ''[[Blowup]]'' (1966) as a key influence on his conceptualization of the film's themes, such as surveillance versus participation, and perception versus reality. \"Francis had seen [it] a year or two before, and had the idea to fuse the concept of ''Blowup'' with the world of audio surveillance.\"{{sfn|Ondaatje|2002|p=152}}\n\nOn the [[DVD]] commentary, Coppola says he was shocked to learn that the film utilized the very same surveillance and wire-tapping equipment that members of the [[Nixon Administration]] used to spy on political opponents prior to the [[Watergate scandal]]. Coppola has said this is the reason the film gained part of the recognition it has received, but that this is entirely coincidental. Not only was the script for ''The Conversation'' completed in the mid-1960s (before the Nixon Administration came to power) but the spying equipment used in the film was discovered through research and the use of technical advisers and not, as many believed, by revelatory newspaper stories about the Watergate break-in. Coppola also noted that filming of ''The Conversation'' had been completed several months before the most revelatory Watergate stories broke in the press. Since the film was released to theaters just a few months before [[Richard Nixon]] resigned as President, Coppola felt that audiences interpreted the film to be a reaction to both the Watergate scandal and its fall-out.\n\nThe original cinematographer of ''The Conversation'' was [[Haskell Wexler]]. Severe creative and personal differences with Coppola led to Wexler's firing shortly after production began and Coppola replaced him with [[Bill Butler (cinematographer)|Bill Butler]]. Wexler's footage on ''The Conversation'' was completely reshot, except for the technically complex surveillance scene in Union Square.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/71469/The-Conversation/articles.html |title=The Conversation (1974) |last=Stafford |first=Jeff |date= |accessdate=11 June 2017 |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]}}</ref> This would be the first of two Oscar-nominated films where Wexler would be fired and replaced by Butler, the second being ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' (1975), where Wexler had similar problems with [[Milo\u0161 Forman]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Townsend |first=Sylvia |title=Haskell Wexler and the Making of \u2018One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\u2019 |date=19 December 2014 |url=http://worldcinemaparadise.com/2014/12/19/haskell-wexler-and-the-making-of-one-flew-over-the-cuckoos-nest/ |accessdate=2 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Walter Murch]] served as the supervising editor and sound designer. Murch had more or less a free hand during the editing process, since Coppola was already working on ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' at the time.{{sfn|Ondaatje|2002|p=157}} Coppola noted in the DVD commentary that Hackman had a very difficult time adapting to the Harry Caul character because it was so much unlike himself. Coppola says that Hackman was at the time an outgoing and approachable person who preferred casual clothes, whereas Caul was meant to be a socially awkward loner who wore a rain coat and out-of-style glasses. Coppola said that Hackman's efforts to tap into the character made the actor moody and irritable on-set but otherwise Coppola got along well with his leading man. Coppola also notes on the commentary that Hackman considers this one of his favorite performances.\n\n''The Conversation'' features a piano score composed and performed by [[David Shire]]. The score was created before the film was shot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soundtrack.net/soundtracks/database/?id=2939 |title=discussion of soundtrack |accessdate=22 May 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020115151208/http://www.soundtrack.net/soundtracks/database/?id=2939 |archivedate=15 January 2002}}</ref> On some cues, Shire used [[musique concr\u00e8te]] techniques, taking the taped sounds of the piano and distorting them in different ways to create alternative tonalities to round out the score.

{"title_page": "Curragh incident", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n\nThe '''Curragh incident''' of 20 March 1914, generally known as the '''Curragh mutiny''', occurred in the [[Curragh]], [[County Kildare]], Ireland. The [[Curragh Camp]] was then the main base for the [[British Army]] in Ireland, which at the time still formed part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. Ireland was about to receive a measure of [[devolved government]], which included [[Ulster]].  The incident is important in 20th-century Irish history.  It is also notable in being one of the few occasions since the [[English Civil War]] in which elements of the British military openly intervened in politics.  It is widely thought of as a mutiny, though no orders actually given were disobeyed.\n\nWith [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Irish Home Rule]] due to become law in 1914, the British Cabinet contemplated some kind of military action against the [[Ulster Volunteers]] who threatened to rebel against it. Many officers, especially those with Irish Protestant connections, of whom the most prominent was [[Hubert Gough]], threatened to resign or accept dismissal rather than obey, privately encouraged from London by senior officers including [[Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet|Henry Wilson]].\n\nAlthough the Cabinet issued a document claiming that the issue had been a misunderstanding, the [[Secretary of State for War]] [[J. E. B. Seely, 1st Baron Mottistone|J. E. B. Seely]] and the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff|Chief of the General Staff]] (CIGS, professional head of the Army) [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Field Marshall Sir John French]] were forced to resign after amending it to promise that the British Army would not be used against the [[Ulster loyalist]]s.\n\nThe event contributed both to unionist confidence, and to the growing Irish separatist movement, convincing Irish nationalists that they could not expect support from the British army in Ireland. In turn, this increased renewed nationalist support for paramilitary forces. The Home Rule Bill was passed but postponed, and the growing fear of civil war in Ireland led on to the British government considering some form of partition of Ireland instead, which eventually took place.\n\n==Background==\nIn early 1912, the Liberal British government of [[H. H. Asquith]] had introduced the [[Third Home Rule Bill]] for [[Ireland]], which proposed the creation of an autonomous Irish Parliament in [[Dublin]]. [[Unionism (Ireland)|Unionists]] had objected to being under the jurisdiction of the proposed Dublin Parliament, and [[Ulster Unionist]]s founded the [[Ulster Volunteers]] (UVF) paramilitary group in 1912, aided by a number of senior retired British officers, to fight if necessary against the British government and/or against a future Irish Home Rule government as proposed by the bill.\n\nIn September 1913, the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (CIGS), [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|John French]], had expressed his concerns to the government and to [[George V of the United Kingdom|the King]] (who had also asked Asquith for his views) that the [[British Army]], if ordered to act against the UVF, might split, with some serving officers even siding with the Ulster Unionists, given that many shared the same view of preserving and defending a [[Protestant]] [[British Empire]] and believed Home Rule for mainly Catholic Ireland would threaten it.<ref>Holmes 2004, p. 168.</ref> Major-General [[Henry Hughes Wilson]], Director of Military Operations, was in regular contact with Opposition leaders (including [[Bonar Law]]) and with retired officers who supported the Volunteers.<ref name=\"Holmes 2004, p169\">Holmes 2004, p. 169.</ref><ref>[[A. T. Q. Stewart]] (1967), ''The Ulster Crisis''. London: Faber & Faber. passim.</ref>\n\n==Paget's orders==\nTo deal with the threat of violence from the UVF should the Home Rule Bill be passed in the British Parliament, [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff|Chief of the General Staff]] (CIGS) [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Field Marshall Sir John French]] and [[Secretary of State for War]] [[J. E. B. Seely, 1st Baron Mottistone|J. E. B. Seely]] summoned [[Arthur Henry Fitzroy Paget|General Sir Arthur Paget]], [[Commander-in-Chief, Ireland|Commander-in-Chief in Ireland]], for talks at the War Office in October 1913. Paget's letter (19 October) suggests that he wanted \"partial mobilisation\" while Seely wrote to the Prime Minister (24 October) about the potential use of General [[Nevil Macready]], who had experience of crowd control during the [[Tonypandy riots]] in 1910, and had been consulted by Birrell about the use of troops in the Belfast riots of 1912. In October 1913, Seely sent Macready to report on the police in [[Belfast]] and Dublin.<ref name=\"Holmes 2004, p169\"/>\n\nIntelligence reported that the UVF (now 100,000 strong) might be about to seize the ammunition at [[Carrickfergus Castle]]. Political negotiations were deadlocked as [[John Redmond]]'s [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] was only willing to offer Ulster an opt-out from Home Rule for up to six years (i.e., until after the next general election), whereas the Ulster Unionists, led by [[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Edward Carson]], wanted a permanent opt-out. Asquith set up a five-man Cabinet Committee, chaired by Crewe{{clarify|post-text=(see [[Talk:Curragh_incident%23Crewe,_who?|talk]])|date=December 2018}} (who soon fell ill), and consisting of [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|John Simon]], [[Augustine Birrell]] ([[Chief Secretary for Ireland]]), Seely, and [[Winston Churchill]] ([[First Lord of the Admiralty]]). Churchill, who spoke at Bradford (14 March) to say that there were \"worse things than bloodshed, even on an extended scale\" and \"Let us go forward together and put these grave matters to the proof\", and Seely appear to have been courting some kind of confrontation with the UVF.<ref>Holmes 2004, p. 173.</ref>\n\nPaget was ordered to prepare to deploy troops to prevent \"evil-disposed persons\" seizing weapons, and summoned to London for further instructions. Seely obtained French's compliance by repeatedly assuring him of the accuracy of intelligence that the UVF might march on Dublin. The plan was to occupy government buildings, to repel any assaults by the UVF and to guard the armouries at [[Omagh]], [[Enniskillen]], [[Armagh]], [[Dundalk]] and [[Carrickfergus]] to prevent thefts of weapons. Six different contingencies were discussed, including armed resistance to the troops as they moved to protect the arms depots. Seely also promised Paget reinforcements \"... to the last man ...\" to uphold the law in Ireland. In the event of a railway strike, or other obstacle, Churchill offered transport of forces by the [[Royal Navy]].<ref>Holmes 2004, pp. 173\u2013176.</ref>\n\nThe politicians later claimed that at the meeting when Paget arrived in London, they merely gave verbal amplification to orders which he had already received from the [[War Office]], but Asquith later admitted that this was untrue; at the meeting Paget was also told to send troops to [[Newry]] (an old, empty barracks with no stores) and Dundalk, both in [[Irish nationalist]] areas and so unlikely to be seized by the UVF, but of strategic importance in any move to bring Ulster under military control. It was later suggested (a claim believed by Sir James Fergusson, [[Charles Fergusson]]'s son) that the move to deploy troops may have been a \"plot\" by Churchill and Seely to goad the loyalists into a rebellion which would then be put down, although this view is not universally held.<ref>Holmes 2004, pp. 174\u2013175, 193.</ref>\n\nOn the evening of 18 March, Paget wired Major-General [[Lovick Friend]] that the troop movements were to be completed by dawn on Sunday 31 March. Paget was summoned to another meeting on 19 March at which Seely declared that the government was pressing ahead with Home Rule and had no intention of allowing civil war to break out, suggesting that the UVF were to be crushed if they attempted to start one. [[Prince Louis of Battenberg]] ([[First Sea Lord]]) was also at the meeting, as that day the 3rd Battle Squadron was ordered to steam to [[Lamlash]] on the [[Firth of Clyde]]. The following night Churchill told French that his ships would have Belfast in flames in 24 hours, while other vessels were ready to help deploy troops to Ulster (in case of a strike by loyalist railwaymen). That evening, after Carson had stormed out of a Commons debate and departed for Ulster, where he was expected to declare a provisional government, Asquith, Seely, Churchill, Birrell, Field Marshal French, and General Paget had an emergency meeting at [[10 Downing Street]] where Asquith insisted that extra infantry be sent to defend the artillery at Dundalk, which French wanted to withdraw. Seely claimed that a unionist coup was imminent in Ulster, although no trace of his intelligence survives.<ref>Holmes 2004, pp. 176\u2013178.</ref>\n\n==Resignations==\nPaget travelled to Dublin that night in a state of high excitement, having been given no written orders (it is unclear whether or not this was because the politicians were reluctant to put anything in writing).<ref name=\"Holmes 2004, p178-9\">Holmes 2004, pp. 178\u2013179.</ref>\n\nThe next morning (Friday 20 March), Paget addressed Generals [[Stuart Peter Rolt|Rolt]], [[Gerald Cuthbert|Cuthbert]], [[Hubert Gough|Gough]],<ref name=\"Gou\">[[Robert Kee|Kee, Robert]]. ''The Green Flag'', Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1972, p. 488. {{ISBN|0-297-17987-X}}.</ref> and [[Sir Charles Fergusson, 7th Baronet|Fergusson]] (GOC 5th Infantry Division), and three staff officers, at his Parkgate Street H.Q. in [[Dublin]]. Three different accounts exist (written by Paget, by Fergusson, and by Gough in his memoirs ''Soldiering On''), but it is clear that Paget exacerbated the situation. By Gough's account, he said that \"active operations were to commence against Ulster\". Paget then claimed that he had obtained \"concessions\" from Seely, namely that officers who lived in Ulster would be permitted to \"disappear\" for the duration, and that other officers who refused to serve against Ulster would be dismissed rather than being permitted to resign. French, Paget, and Adjutant-General [[Spencer Ewart]] had indeed (on 19 March) agreed to exclude officers with \"direct family connections\" to Ulster, and to dismiss other officers who refused to participate. Paget told Gough, who queried whether \"disappear\" meant absence with or without leave, and who had a family connection to Ulster but did not live there, that he could expect no mercy from \"[[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|his old friend at the War Office]]\" (John French). In effectively offering his officers an ultimatum, Paget was acting foolishly, as the majority might simply have obeyed if simply ordered north.{{who says|date=December 2018}} Paget ended the meeting by ordering his officers to speak to their subordinates and then report back. Fergusson collared Gough and one of the infantry brigadiers, and warned that the Army must hold together at all costs, and that he himself would obey orders. Gough said that he would not, and went off to speak to the officers of the 5th Lancers (one of the regiments under his command) and also sent a telegram to his brother Johnnie, Haig's Chief of Staff at Aldershot. Gough did not attend the second meeting in the afternoon, at which Paget confirmed that the purpose of the move was to overawe Ulster rather than fight.<ref name=\"Holmes 2004, p178-9\"/> No provision was made for enlisted men who had conscientious objections.<ref>Jeffery 2006, p. 120.</ref> The deployment orders were headed \"'Duty as ordered \u2013 Active Operations in Ulster\", and Gough later suggested that \"active operations\" sounded as if it were much more than a cautionary protective deployment.\n\nGough offered the officers under his command at nearby Marlborough Barracks (now [[McKee Barracks]]) the choice of resignation rather than fighting against the Ulster Volunteers. The ultimatum was passed on to the rest of Gough's [[3rd Cavalry Brigade (United Kingdom)#3rd Cavalry Brigade|3rd Cavalry Brigade]] 25 miles away at the [[Curragh Camp]].\n\nOn the evening of 20 March, Paget sent a telegram to the [[War Office]] in London announcing that almost all the officers of 5th Lancers intended to resign and the same was probably true of 16th Lancers. Seely replied, on behalf of the Army Council, telling Paget to suspend any senior officer who had offered to resign, and ordering Gough and two of his three colonels (the attitude of the third was unclear) to report to the War Office. A second telegram just before midnight confirmed that 57 officers preferred to accept dismissal (it was actually 61 including Gough<ref>Holmes 2004, p. 386.</ref>):\n\n{{Quote| {{Allcaps|Officer Commanding 5th Lancers states that all officers, except two and one doubtful, are resigning their commissions today. I much fear same conditions in the 16th Lancers. Fear men will refuse to move. Regret to report Brigadier-General Gough and fifty-seven officers 3rd Cavalry Brigade prefer to accept dismissal if ordered North.}} }}\n\nAt the date of the incident, 70 officers were serving with the 3rd Cavalry Brigade.<ref>page 557, Volume 31, ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'', Twelfth Edition</ref>  The officers were not technically guilty of [[mutiny]], as they had resigned before refusing to carry out a direct order. As all were in Gough's brigade, and as they were informed of his reservations about Seely's orders, he was portrayed as central to the whole incident.\n\n[[Philip Chetwode, 1st Baron Chetwode|Chetwode]] was nominated to take Gough\u2019s place if necessary.<ref>Jeffery 2006, pp. 121, 124.</ref> Up to 100 other officers of Irish Command threatened to resign.<ref>Jeffery 2006, p. 122.</ref>\n\n==Results==\n[[Sir Charles Fergusson, 7th Baronet|General Sir Charles Fergusson]], then commanding the 5th division in Ireland, toured units on the morning of Saturday 21 March to ensure their future compliance with government policy. One of his officers said later that\n<blockquote>\nHe [Fergusson] reminded us that although we must naturally hold private political views, officially we should not be on the side of any one political party. It was our duty to obey orders, to go wherever we were sent and to comply with instructions of any political party that happened to be in power. There was no sloppy sentiment; it was good stuff straight from the shoulder and just what we wanted.<ref>http://www.curragh.info/articles/mutiny.htm</ref>\n</blockquote>\nPaget did the same, but his speech was described as \"absolutely unconvincing and inconclusive.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} However, Paget was able to conduct the precautionary moves planned on 18 and 19 March.<ref>Holmes 2004, pp. 179\u2013180.</ref>\n\nThe elderly Field Marshal [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Roberts]], who had recently exchanged \"epithets\" with French on the telephone over what he saw as French's collaboration with the government's \"dastardly\" plans, learned that Paget, in talking of \"active operations\" and in giving officers a chance to discuss hypothetical orders and threaten to resign, had been acting without authority and left a note for Hubert Gough to this effect. The King wrote to Asquith requesting that he be consulted before any further steps were taken.<ref>Holmes 2004, pp. 181\u2013183.</ref>\n\nGough, summoned to the War Office, confirmed (Sunday 22 March) that he would have obeyed a direct order to move against Ulster.

The [[Curragh Camp]] was then the main base for the [[British Army]] in Ireland, which at the time still formed part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. Ireland was about to receive a measure of [[devolved government]], which included [[Ulster]].  The incident is important in 20th-century Irish history.  It is also notable in being one of the few occasions since the [[English Civil War]] in which elements of the British military openly intervened in politics.  It is widely thought of as a mutiny, though no orders actually given were disobeyed.\n\nWith [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Irish Home Rule]] due to become law in 1914, the British Cabinet contemplated some kind of military action against the [[Ulster Volunteers]] who threatened to rebel against it. Many officers, especially those with Irish Protestant connections, of whom the most prominent was [[Hubert Gough]], threatened to resign or accept dismissal rather than obey, privately encouraged from London by senior officers including [[Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet|Henry Wilson]].\n\nAlthough the Cabinet issued a document claiming that the issue had been a misunderstanding, the [[Secretary of State for War]] [[J. E. B. Seely, 1st Baron Mottistone|J. E. B. Seely]] and the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff|Chief of the General Staff]] (CIGS, professional head of the Army) [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Field Marshall Sir John French]] were forced to resign after amending it to promise that the British Army would not be used against the [[Ulster loyalist]]s.\n\nThe event contributed both to unionist confidence, and to the growing Irish separatist movement, convincing Irish nationalists that they could not expect support from the British army in Ireland. In turn, this increased renewed nationalist support for paramilitary forces. The Home Rule Bill was passed but postponed, and the growing fear of civil war in Ireland led on to the British government considering some form of partition of Ireland instead, which eventually took place.\n\n==Background==\nIn early 1912, the Liberal British government of [[H. H. Asquith]] had introduced the [[Third Home Rule Bill]] for [[Ireland]], which proposed the creation of an autonomous Irish Parliament in [[Dublin]]. [[Unionism (Ireland)|Unionists]] had objected to being under the jurisdiction of the proposed Dublin Parliament, and [[Ulster Unionist]]s founded the [[Ulster Volunteers]] (UVF) paramilitary group in 1912, aided by a number of senior retired British officers, to fight if necessary against the British government and/or against a future Irish Home Rule government as proposed by the bill.\n\nIn September 1913, the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (CIGS), [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|John French]], had expressed his concerns to the government and to [[George V of the United Kingdom|the King]] (who had also asked Asquith for his views) that the [[British Army]], if ordered to act against the UVF, might split, with some serving officers even siding with the Ulster Unionists, given that many shared the same view of preserving and defending a [[Protestant]] [[British Empire]] and believed Home Rule for mainly Catholic Ireland would threaten it.<ref>Holmes 2004, p. 168.</ref> Major-General [[Henry Hughes Wilson]], Director of Military Operations, was in regular contact with Opposition leaders (including [[Bonar Law]]) and with retired officers who supported the Volunteers.<ref name=\"Holmes 2004, p169\">Holmes 2004, p. 169.</ref><ref>[[A. T. Q. Stewart]] (1967), ''The Ulster Crisis''. London: Faber & Faber. passim.</ref>\n\n==Paget's orders==\nTo deal with the threat of violence from the UVF should the Home Rule Bill be passed in the British Parliament, [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff|Chief of the General Staff]] (CIGS) [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Field Marshall Sir John French]] and [[Secretary of State for War]] [[J. E. B. Seely, 1st Baron Mottistone|J. E. B. Seely]] summoned [[Arthur Henry Fitzroy Paget|General Sir Arthur Paget]], [[Commander-in-Chief, Ireland|Commander-in-Chief in Ireland]], for talks at the War Office in October 1913. Paget's letter (19 October) suggests that he wanted \"partial mobilisation\" while Seely wrote to the Prime Minister (24 October) about the potential use of General [[Nevil Macready]], who had experience of crowd control during the [[Tonypandy Riots]] in 1910, and had been consulted by Birrell about the use of troops in the Belfast riots of 1912. In October 1913, Seely sent Macready to report on the police in [[Belfast]] and Dublin.<ref name=\"Holmes 2004, p169\"/>\n\nIntelligence reported that the UVF (now 100,000 strong) might be about to seize the ammunition at [[Carrickfergus Castle]]. Political negotiations were deadlocked as [[John Redmond]]'s [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] was only willing to offer Ulster an opt-out from Home Rule for up to six years (i.e., until after the next general election), whereas the Ulster Unionists, led by [[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Edward Carson]], wanted a permanent opt-out. Asquith set up a five-man Cabinet Committee, chaired by Crewe{{clarify|post-text=(see [[Talk:Curragh_incident%23Crewe,_who?|talk]])|date=December 2018}} (who soon fell ill), and consisting of [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|John Simon]], [[Augustine Birrell]] ([[Chief Secretary for Ireland]]), Seely, and [[Winston Churchill]] ([[First Lord of the Admiralty]]). Churchill, who spoke at Bradford (14 March) to say that there were \"worse things than bloodshed, even on an extended scale\" and \"Let us go forward together and put these grave matters to the proof\", and Seely appear to have been courting some kind of confrontation with the UVF.<ref>Holmes 2004, p. 173.</ref>\n\nPaget was ordered to prepare to deploy troops to prevent \"evil-disposed persons\" seizing weapons, and summoned to London for further instructions. Seely obtained French's compliance by repeatedly assuring him of the accuracy of intelligence that the UVF might march on Dublin. The plan was to occupy government buildings, to repel any assaults by the UVF and to guard the armouries at [[Omagh]], [[Enniskillen]], [[Armagh]], [[Dundalk]] and [[Carrickfergus]] to prevent thefts of weapons. Six different contingencies were discussed, including armed resistance to the troops as they moved to protect the arms depots. Seely also promised Paget reinforcements \"... to the last man ...\" to uphold the law in Ireland. In the event of a railway strike, or other obstacle, Churchill offered transport of forces by the [[Royal Navy]].<ref>Holmes 2004, pp. 173\u2013176.</ref>\n\nThe politicians later claimed that at the meeting when Paget arrived in London, they merely gave verbal amplification to orders which he had already received from the [[War Office]], but Asquith later admitted that this was untrue; at the meeting Paget was also told to send troops to [[Newry]] (an old, empty barracks with no stores) and Dundalk, both in [[Irish nationalist]] areas and so unlikely to be seized by the UVF, but of strategic importance in any move to bring Ulster under military control. It was later suggested (a claim believed by Sir James Fergusson, [[Charles Fergusson]]'s son) that the move to deploy troops may have been a \"plot\" by Churchill and Seely to goad the loyalists into a rebellion which would then be put down, although this view is not universally held.<ref>Holmes 2004, pp. 174\u2013175, 193.</ref>\n\nOn the evening of 18 March, Paget wired Major-General [[Lovick Friend]] that the troop movements were to be completed by dawn on Sunday 31 March. Paget was summoned to another meeting on 19 March at which Seely declared that the government was pressing ahead with Home Rule and had no intention of allowing civil war to break out, suggesting that the UVF were to be crushed if they attempted to start one. [[Prince Louis of Battenberg]] ([[First Sea Lord]]) was also at the meeting, as that day the 3rd Battle Squadron was ordered to steam to [[Lamlash]] on the [[Firth of Clyde]]. The following night Churchill told French that his ships would have Belfast in flames in 24 hours, while other vessels were ready to help deploy troops to Ulster (in case of a strike by loyalist railwaymen). That evening, after Carson had stormed out of a Commons debate and departed for Ulster, where he was expected to declare a provisional government, Asquith, Seely, Churchill, Birrell, Field Marshal French, and General Paget had an emergency meeting at [[10 Downing Street]] where Asquith insisted that extra infantry be sent to defend the artillery at Dundalk, which French wanted to withdraw. Seely claimed that a unionist coup was imminent in Ulster, although no trace of his intelligence survives.<ref>Holmes 2004, pp. 176\u2013178.</ref>\n\n==Resignations==\nPaget travelled to Dublin that night in a state of high excitement, having been given no written orders (it is unclear whether or not this was because the politicians were reluctant to put anything in writing).<ref name=\"Holmes 2004, p178-9\">Holmes 2004, pp. 178\u2013179.</ref>\n\nThe next morning (Friday 20 March), Paget addressed Generals [[Stuart Peter Rolt|Rolt]], [[Gerald Cuthbert|Cuthbert]], [[Hubert Gough|Gough]],<ref name=\"Gou\">[[Robert Kee|Kee, Robert]]. ''The Green Flag'', Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1972, p. 488. {{ISBN|0-297-17987-X}}.</ref> and [[Sir Charles Fergusson, 7th Baronet|Fergusson]] (GOC 5th Infantry Division), and three staff officers, at his Parkgate Street H.Q. in [[Dublin]]. Three different accounts exist (written by Paget, by Fergusson, and by Gough in his memoirs ''Soldiering On''), but it is clear that Paget exacerbated the situation. By Gough's account, he said that \"active operations were to commence against Ulster\". Paget then claimed that he had obtained \"concessions\" from Seely, namely that officers who lived in Ulster would be permitted to \"disappear\" for the duration, and that other officers who refused to serve against Ulster would be dismissed rather than being permitted to resign. French, Paget, and Adjutant-General [[Spencer Ewart]] had indeed (on 19 March) agreed to exclude officers with \"direct family connections\" to Ulster, and to dismiss other officers who refused to participate. Paget told Gough, who queried whether \"disappear\" meant absence with or without leave, and who had a family connection to Ulster but did not live there, that he could expect no mercy from \"[[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|his old friend at the War Office]]\" (John French). In effectively offering his officers an ultimatum, Paget was acting foolishly, as the majority might simply have obeyed if simply ordered north.{{who says|date=December 2018}} Paget ended the meeting by ordering his officers to speak to their subordinates and then report back. Fergusson collared Gough and one of the infantry brigadiers, and warned that the Army must hold together at all costs, and that he himself would obey orders. Gough said that he would not, and went off to speak to the officers of the 5th Lancers (one of the regiments under his command) and also sent a telegram to his brother Johnnie, Haig's Chief of Staff at Aldershot. Gough did not attend the second meeting in the afternoon, at which Paget confirmed that the purpose of the move was to overawe Ulster rather than fight.<ref name=\"Holmes 2004, p178-9\"/> No provision was made for enlisted men who had conscientious objections.<ref>Jeffery 2006, p. 120.</ref> The deployment orders were headed \"'Duty as ordered \u2013 Active Operations in Ulster\", and Gough later suggested that \"active operations\" sounded as if it were much more than a cautionary protective deployment.\n\nGough offered the officers under his command at nearby Marlborough Barracks (now [[McKee Barracks]]) the choice of resignation rather than fighting against the Ulster Volunteers. The ultimatum was passed on to the rest of Gough's [[3rd Cavalry Brigade (United Kingdom)#3rd Cavalry Brigade|3rd Cavalry Brigade]] 25 miles away at the [[Curragh Camp]].\n\nOn the evening of 20 March, Paget sent a telegram to the [[War Office]] in London announcing that almost all the officers of 5th Lancers intended to resign and the same was probably true of 16th Lancers. Seely replied, on behalf of the Army Council, telling Paget to suspend any senior officer who had offered to resign, and ordering Gough and two of his three colonels (the attitude of the third was unclear) to report to the War Office. A second telegram just before midnight confirmed that 57 officers preferred to accept dismissal (it was actually 61 including Gough<ref>Holmes 2004, p. 386.</ref>):\n\n{{Quote| {{Allcaps|Officer Commanding 5th Lancers states that all officers, except two and one doubtful, are resigning their commissions today. I much fear same conditions in the 16th Lancers. Fear men will refuse to move. Regret to report Brigadier-General Gough and fifty-seven officers 3rd Cavalry Brigade prefer to accept dismissal if ordered North.}} }}\n\nAt the date of the incident, 70 officers were serving with the 3rd Cavalry Brigade.<ref>page 557, Volume 31, ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'', Twelfth Edition</ref>  The officers were not technically guilty of [[mutiny]], as they had resigned before refusing to carry out a direct order. As all were in Gough's brigade, and as they were informed of his reservations about Seely's orders, he was portrayed as central to the whole incident.\n\n[[Philip Chetwode, 1st Baron Chetwode|Chetwode]] was nominated to take Gough\u2019s place if necessary.<ref>Jeffery 2006, pp. 121, 124.</ref> Up to 100 other officers of Irish Command threatened to resign.<ref>Jeffery 2006, p. 122.</ref>\n\n==Results==\n[[Sir Charles Fergusson, 7th Baronet|General Sir Charles Fergusson]], then commanding the 5th division in Ireland, toured units on the morning of Saturday 21 March to ensure their future compliance with government policy. One of his officers said later that\n<blockquote>\nHe [Fergusson] reminded us that although we must naturally hold private political views, officially we should not be on the side of any one political party. It was our duty to obey orders, to go wherever we were sent and to comply with instructions of any political party that happened to be in power. There was no sloppy sentiment; it was good stuff straight from the shoulder and just what we wanted.<ref>http://www.curragh.info/articles/mutiny.htm</ref>\n</blockquote>\nPaget did the same, but his speech was described as \"absolutely unconvincing and inconclusive.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} However, Paget was able to conduct the precautionary moves planned on 18 and 19 March.<ref>Holmes 2004, pp. 179\u2013180.</ref>\n\nThe elderly Field Marshal [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Roberts]], who had recently exchanged \"epithets\" with French on the telephone over what he saw as French's collaboration with the government's \"dastardly\" plans, learned that Paget, in talking of \"active operations\" and in giving officers a chance to discuss hypothetical orders and threaten to resign, had been acting without authority and left a note for Hubert Gough to this effect. The King wrote to Asquith requesting that he be consulted before any further steps were taken.<ref>Holmes 2004, pp. 181\u2013183.</ref>\n\nGough, summoned to the War Office, confirmed (Sunday 22 March) that he would have obeyed a direct order to move against Ulster. When he saw the King that evening, French, advised by Haldane (Lord Chancellor) that Paget should not have asked officers about \"hypothetical contingencies,\" also threatened to resign if Gough were not reinstated. Paget was ordered to report to London, Macready was sent out to Belfast (but without official announcement) while Asquith informed the King that Paget had indeed exceeded his instructions, that only safeguarding of ammunition stores had been intended, that the naval deployment had been cancelled, and that there would be no further troop movement without consulting the King.<ref>Holmes 2004, pp. 183\u2013184.</ref>\n\n[[Herbert Henry Asquith|Asquith]]'s [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government backed down, claiming an \"honest misunderstanding.\" At French's suggestion Seely obtained a document from the Cabinet, stating that the Army Council were satisfied that the incident had been a misunderstanding, and that it was \"the duty of all soldiers to obey lawful commands.\" Seely added two paragraphs, stating that the Government had the right to use \"forces of the Crown\" in Ireland or elsewhere, but had no intention of using force \"to crush opposition to the Home Rule Bill.\" It is unclear whether this\u2014amending a Cabinet document without Cabinet approval\u2014was an honest blunder on Seely's part or whether he was encouraged to do so and then made a scapegoat.<ref>Holmes 2004, pp. 184\u2013188.</ref> Gough insisted on adding a further paragraph clarifying that the Army would not be used to enforce Home Rule ''on Ulster'', to which French concurred in writing.<ref>Holmes 2004, pp. 188\u2013189.</ref> Wilson, Roberts and French had been leaking information to the press throughout the Incident.
