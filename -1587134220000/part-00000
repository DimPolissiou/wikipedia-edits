The {{convert|496.00|mi|adj=on}} mainline is a [[toll road]] that extends from the [[New York City]] line at [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]] to the [[New York\u2013Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]] at [[Ripley, New York|Ripley]] by way of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]].

The first section of the Thruway, between [[Utica, New York|Utica]] and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], opened on June 24, 1954. The remainder of the mainline and many of its spurs connecting to highways in other states and Canadian provinces were built in the 1950s. In 1957, much of the Thruway system was included as portions of [[Interstate 87 (New York)|Interstate&nbsp;87]] (I-87), [[Interstate 90 in New York|I-90]], and [[Interstate 95 in New York|I-95]]. Other segments became part of [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] and [[Interstate 287|I-287]] shortly afterward. Today, the system comprises six highways: the New York\u2013Ripley mainline, the Berkshire Connector, the Garden State Parkway Connector, the [[New England Thruway]] (I-95), the [[Interstate 190 (New York)|Niagara Thruway]] (I-190), and the [[Interstate 287#Cross-Westchester Expressway|Cross-Westchester Expressway]] (I-287). The portion of [[Interstate 84 in New York|I-84 in New York]] was maintained by the Thruway Authority from 1991 to 2010, but was never part of the Thruway system and is currently maintained by the [[New York State Department of Transportation]] (NYSDOT).\n\nThe Thruway utilizes a combination of closed ([[Ticket system|ticket-based]]), and all-electronic ([[open road tolling|open road]]) tolling. Tickets are used on the Thruway mainline between [[Harriman, New York|Harriman]] and [[Williamsville, New York|Williamsville]] and from [[Lackawanna, New York|Lackawanna]] to the Pennsylvania state line. The Berkshire Connector also utilizes a ticket-based tolling system. The New England Thruway, the Niagara Thruway and the portion of the mainline south/east of Harriman use all-electronic tolling, with tolls paid using either [[E-ZPass]] or Tolls-By-Mail. The last two components\u2014the Garden State Parkway Connector and the Cross-Westchester Expressway\u2014and the section of the mainline in and around Buffalo are toll-free. A proposed transition to [[Open road tolling|cashless tolls]] would eliminate all toll booths and their operators by 2020.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.syracuse.com/politics/index.ssf/2018/01/gov_proposes_eliminating_toll_booths_from_new_york_state_thruway_by_2020.html |title = Gov.

Not far to the north is exit&nbsp;8, a [[semi-directional T interchange]] with I-287 (the Cross-Westchester Expressway). I-287 joins the Thruway here, following I-87 west across the [[Hudson River]] into [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]] on the [[Tappan Zee Bridge (2017\u2013present)|Tappan Zee Bridge]]. I-87 and I-287 remain [[concurrency (road)|overlapped]] for {{convert|15|mi}} through the densely populated southern portion of Rockland County, meeting the [[Palisades Interstate Parkway]] (exit 13) and the [[Garden State Parkway Connector]], the latter of which provides access to the [[Garden State Parkway]] (exit 14A) in New Jersey. The Thruway continues generally westward to [[Suffern, New York|Suffern]], where I-87 and I-287 split at a large semi-directional T interchange (exit&nbsp;15) near the [[New Jersey]] border. At this point, I-287 heads south into New Jersey while I-87 and the Thruway turn northward into the valley of the [[Ramapo River]].

Here, the Thruway connects to the cities of Rome and [[Oneida, New York|Oneida]] and serves the [[Turning Stone Resort & Casino]] via NY&nbsp;365.

As the highway approaches exit&nbsp;34A ([[Interstate 481|I-481]]) outside of [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], the surroundings become more developed. The level of development rises sharply west of I-481 as the Thruway enters [[Salina, New York|Salina]], a northern suburb of Syracuse.

The Cross-Westchester Expressway, part of I-287, begins at I-87 exit&nbsp;8 in [[Elmsford, New York|Elmsford]], where I-287 splits from the Thruway mainline, and travels east across [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] to I-95, with connections to both the New England Thruway and the Connecticut Turnpike at exit&nbsp;12 in [[Rye, New York|Rye]]. The Niagara Thruway comprises the first {{convert|21.24|mi|2}} of [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] from I-90 in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] to [[New York State Route 384|NY&nbsp;384]] in [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]].<ref name=\"mileage\" />\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins and construction===\nA toll [[superhighway]] connecting the major cities of the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] that would become part of a larger nationwide highway network was proposed as early as 1949. The following year, the [[New York State Legislature]] passed the Thruway Authority Act creating the [[New York State Thruway Authority]] (NYSTA), an independent [[Government-owned corporation|public corporation]], which would build and manage the Thruway. The project was to be financed through [[toll revenue bond]]s and self-liquidating by receipt of tolls, rents, concessions, and other income. The act also stipulated NYSTA adopt a hybrid system of tolls, with barrier tolls collected in urban areas, and long-distance tickets issued in rural areas.<ref name=\"nycr-nyst\">{{cite web |url = http://www.nycroads.com/roads/thruway/ |title = New York State Thruway |last = Anderson |first = Steve |work = NYCRoads |access-date = April 21, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe first section of the Thruway, between [[Utica, New York|Utica]] and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], opened on June 24, 1954.<ref name=\"opening\">{{cite news |title = Across The Map |last = Dales |first = Douglas |date = June 20, 1954 |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |pages = XX21 }}</ref> Other sections of the {{convert|426|mi|0|adj=on}} mainline between [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[the Bronx]] were completed and opened throughout 1954 and 1955.

The total cost was $600&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|600000000|1956|r=0}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}), financed by the sale of $972 million in bonds (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|972000000|1956|r=0}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}).<ref name=\"nycr-nyst\" />{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}} At the time, it was the longest toll road in the world.

These include the Berkshire Connector (May 26, 1959), which connects to the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]], the [[New England Thruway]] (October 31, 1958) and [[Interstate 287|Cross Westchester Expressway]] (December 1, 1960), which both connect to the [[Connecticut Turnpike]], and the [[Niagara Thruway]] (July 30, 1959), which connects to Canada\u2019s [[Queen Elizabeth Way]] via a border crossing near [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]].<ref name=\"nycr-nyst\" /> The Thruway also directly connects to New Jersey\u2019s tolled [[Garden State Parkway]], which eventually connects to the [[New Jersey Turnpike]], which is part of a toll road system linking [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]] that also uses tolled highways in [[Pennsylvania Turnpike|Pennsylvania]], [[Ohio Turnpike|Ohio]], and [[Indiana Toll Road|Indiana]].\n\nOn August 14, 1957, the segment of the mainline between the Pennsylvania border and the [[Adirondack Northway]] in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] became part of [[Interstate 90 in New York|I-90]] while the portions from the Northway south to [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]] and from [[Elmsford, New York|Elmsford]] south to the [[New York City]] line were included in [[Interstate 87 (New York)|I-87]]. Between Elmsford and Newburgh, I-87 followed I-287, what is now I-684, and I-84. Upon its completion, the Berkshire Connector east of [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US 9]] also became part of I-90, creating a gap in the I-90 designation around Albany until the completion of the {{convert|20|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} Albany-Schodack Freeway in the early 1970s, which is not part of the Thruway system.

The first section of the Thruway, between [[Utica, New York|Utica]] and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], opened on June 24, 1954. The remainder of the mainline and many of its spurs connecting to highways in other states and [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]] were built in the 1950s. In 1957, much of the Thruway system was included as portions of [[Interstate 87 (New York)|Interstate&nbsp;87]] (I-87), [[Interstate 90 in New York|I-90]], and [[Interstate 95 in New York|I-95]]. Other segments became part of [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] and [[Interstate 287|I-287]] shortly afterward. Today, the system comprises six highways: the New York\u2013Ripley mainline, the Berkshire Connector, the Garden State Parkway Connector, the [[New England Thruway]] (I-95), the [[Interstate 190 (New York)|Niagara Thruway]] (I-190), and the [[Interstate 287#Cross-Westchester Expressway|Cross-Westchester Expressway]] (I-287). The portion of [[Interstate 84 in New York|I-84 in New York]] was maintained by the Thruway Authority from 1991 to 2010, but was never part of the Thruway system and is currently maintained by the [[New York State Department of Transportation]] (NYSDOT).\n\nThe Thruway utilizes a combination of closed ([[Ticket system|ticket-based]]), and all-electronic ([[open road tolling|open road]]) tolling. Tickets are used on the Thruway mainline between [[Harriman, New York|Harriman]] and [[Williamsville, New York|Williamsville]] and from [[Lackawanna, New York|Lackawanna]] to the Pennsylvania state line. The Berkshire Connector also utilizes a ticket-based tolling system. The New England Thruway, the Niagara Thruway and the portion of the mainline south/east of Harriman use all-electronic tolling, with tolls paid using either [[E-ZPass]] or Tolls-By-Mail. The last two components\u2014the Garden State Parkway Connector and the Cross-Westchester Expressway\u2014and the section of the mainline in and around Buffalo are toll-free. A proposed transition to [[Open road tolling|cashless tolls]] would eliminate all toll booths and their operators by 2020.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.syracuse.com/politics/index.ssf/2018/01/gov_proposes_eliminating_toll_booths_from_new_york_state_thruway_by_2020.html |title = Gov.

I-87 and I-287 remain [[concurrency (road)|overlapped]] for {{convert|15|mi}} through the densely populated southern portion of Rockland County, meeting the [[Palisades Interstate Parkway]] (exit 13) and the [[Garden State Parkway Connector]], the latter of which provides access to the [[Garden State Parkway]] (exit 14A) in New Jersey. The Thruway continues generally westward to [[Suffern, New York|Suffern]], where I-87 and I-287 split at a large semi-directional T interchange (exit&nbsp;15) near the [[New Jersey]] border.

At this point, the Thruway turns southward, passing through the immediate eastern suburbs of Buffalo. As it heads south, it meets the [[Kensington Expressway]] ([[New York State Route 33|NY&nbsp;33]]) at exit&nbsp;51 and Walden Avenue at exit&nbsp;52, both [[cloverleaf interchange]]s. At exit&nbsp;52, it passes to the west of the [[Walden Galleria]], a shopping mall situated at the nearby junction of Walden Avenue and [[New York State Route 277|NY&nbsp;277]]. Two exits later in southern [[Cheektowaga, New York|Cheektowaga]], I-90 meets [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]], a spur route leading to downtown Buffalo and [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]], at exit&nbsp;53.<ref name=\"yahoo-main\" />\n\nSouth of the city, the Thruway meets the [[Aurora Expressway]] ([[New York State Route 400|NY&nbsp;400]]) and the [[Southern Expressway (New York)|Southern Expressway]] ([[U.S. Route 219 in New York|US&nbsp;219]]) at exits&nbsp;54 and&nbsp;55, respectively, in [[West Seneca, New York|West Seneca]]. Just southwest of exit&nbsp;55, I-90 and the Thruway pass through the [[Lackawanna, New York|Lackawanna]] toll barrier, which serves as the northeast end of the minor closed ticket system. Once again a toll road, the Thruway heads southwestward, roughly paralleling the shoreline of [[Lake Erie]] to [[Blasdell, New York|Blasdell]], where it connects to [[New York State Route 179|NY&nbsp;179]] (the Milestrip Expressway). Farther southwestward, the Thruway is joined by [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US&nbsp;20]], which follows a parallel routing to that of the Thruway to the [[New York\u2013Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]].<ref name=\"yahoo-main\" />\n\nAs the route passes from Erie County to [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]], the last on its routing, it cuts through the northwestern portion of the [[Cattaraugus Indian Reservation]], situated on [[Cattaraugus Creek]].

The New England Thruway (NET) is a {{convert|15.01|mi|2|adj=on}} section of [[Interstate 95 in New York|Interstate 95]] under the operation and maintenance of the New York State Thruway Authority. It begins at the [[Pelham Parkway]] interchange (exit&nbsp;8) in the [[Co-op City, Bronx|Co-op City]] section of the [[The Bronx|Bronx]] and continues northeastward into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] to the [[Connecticut]] state line, where it connects to the [[Connecticut Turnpike]]. The Cross-Westchester Expressway, part of I-287, begins at I-87 exit&nbsp;8 in [[Elmsford, New York|Elmsford]], where I-287 splits from the Thruway mainline, and travels east across [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] to I-95, with connections to both the New England Thruway and the Connecticut Turnpike at exit&nbsp;12 in [[Rye, New York|Rye]]. The Niagara Thruway comprises the first {{convert|21.24|mi|2}} of [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] from I-90 in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] to [[New York State Route 384|NY&nbsp;384]] in [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]].<ref name=\"mileage\" />\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins and construction===\nA toll [[superhighway]] connecting the major cities of the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] that would become part of a larger nationwide highway network was proposed as early as 1949. The following year, the [[New York State Legislature]] passed the Thruway Authority Act creating the [[New York State Thruway Authority]] (NYSTA), an independent [[Government-owned corporation|public corporation]], which would build and manage the Thruway. The project was to be financed through [[toll revenue bond]]s and self-liquidating by receipt of tolls, rents, concessions, and other income. The act also stipulated NYSTA adopt a hybrid system of tolls, with barrier tolls collected in urban areas, and long-distance tickets issued in rural areas.<ref name=\"nycr-nyst\">{{cite web |url = http://www.nycroads.com/roads/thruway/ |title = New York State Thruway |last = Anderson |first = Steve |work = NYCRoads |access-date = April 21, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe first section of the Thruway, between [[Utica, New York|Utica]] and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], opened on June 24, 1954.<ref name=\"opening\">{{cite news |title = Across The Map |last = Dales |first = Douglas |date = June 20, 1954 |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |pages = XX21 }}</ref> Other sections of the {{convert|426|mi|0|adj=on}} mainline between [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[the Bronx]] were completed and opened throughout 1954 and 1955.

The total cost was $600&nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|600000000|1956|r=0}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}), financed by the sale of $972 million in bonds (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|972000000|1956|r=0}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}).<ref name=\"nycr-nyst\" />{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}} At the time, it was the longest toll road in the world.

These include the Berkshire Connector (May 26, 1959), which connects to the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]], the [[New England Thruway]] (October 31, 1958) and [[Interstate 287|Cross Westchester Expressway]] (December 1, 1960), which both connect to the [[Connecticut Turnpike]], and the [[Niagara Thruway]] (July 30, 1959), which connects to Canada\u2019s [[Queen Elizabeth Way]] via a border crossing near [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]].<ref name=\"nycr-nyst\" /> The Thruway also directly connects to New Jersey\u2019s tolled [[Garden State Parkway]], which eventually connects to the [[New Jersey Turnpike]], which is part of a toll road system linking [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]] that also uses tolled highways in [[Pennsylvania Turnpike|Pennsylvania]], [[Ohio Turnpike|Ohio]], and [[Indiana Toll Road|Indiana]].\n\nOn August 14, 1957, the segment of the mainline between the Pennsylvania border and the [[Adirondack Northway]] in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] became part of [[Interstate 90 in New York|I-90]] while the portions from the Northway south to [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]] and from [[Elmsford, New York|Elmsford]] south to the [[New York City]] line were included in [[Interstate 87 (New York)|I-87]]. Between Elmsford and Newburgh, I-87 followed I-287, what is now I-684, and I-84. Upon its completion, the Berkshire Connector east of [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US 9]] also became part of I-90, creating a gap in the I-90 designation around Albany until the completion of the {{convert|20|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} Albany-Schodack Freeway in the early 1970s, which is not part of the Thruway system.

Similarly, traffic heading north on I-87 and exiting at exit&nbsp;16 are charged a fixed-rate toll electronically at the Harriman toll plaza. Traffic entering the Thruway from NY&nbsp;17 east are charged a toll electronically at the Harriman plaza and, if traveling north, collect a ticket at the Woodbury barrier.<ref name=\"thru-hist4\" /> (However, this latter situation is less likely to occur because traffic on 17 eastbound is most likely headed south towards New York City, because of 17's south-east gradient beyond Binghamton.) The ticket is identical to that given for exit&nbsp;15 with the exception that the toll for exit&nbsp;16 is subtracted from all of the prices.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.thruway.ny.gov/tolls/calc/trip.cgi?class=1&Entry=m15a&Exit=m19x&is_mc_mh=non_mh_mc |author = New York State Thruway Authority |title = Toll and Distance Calculator: From Exit 15A to Exit 19 |publisher = New York State Thruway Authority |access-date = November 18, 2010 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721061220/http://www.thruway.ny.gov/tolls/calc/trip.cgi?class=1&Entry=m15a&Exit=m19x&is_mc_mh=non_mh_mc |archive-date = July 21, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.thruway.ny.gov/tolls/calc/trip.cgi?class=1&Entry=m16x&Exit=m19x&is_mc_mh=non_mh_mc |author = New York State Thruway Authority |title = Toll and Distance Calculator: From Exit 16 to Exit 19 |publisher = New York State Thruway Authority |access-date = November 18, 2010 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721061227/http://www.thruway.ny.gov/tolls/calc/trip.cgi?class=1&Entry=m16x&Exit=m19x&is_mc_mh=non_mh_mc |archive-date = July 21, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Thruway toll barrier at Williamsville NY.jpg|thumb|left|Approaching the Williamsville toll barrier on I-90&nbsp;/ Thruway westbound]]\nThe other components of the system that are tolled have far fewer tolls.

When he was 16 his father was executed (1397) and his lands and titles forfeited. Fitzalan was a royal ward of King Richard's half-brother [[John Holland, 1st Duke of Exeter]], along with a large part of the [[Arundel]] estates.  Holland greatly mistreated him, a matter Fitzalan would cruelly repay many years later.\n\n==Escape, exile, return and restoration==\nEventually Fitzalan escaped from his guardian and joined his uncle [[Thomas Arundel]], the deposed [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], in exile. The two eventually joined with another exile, the King's cousin [[Henry Bolingbroke]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Arundel, Earls of|volume=2|page=706}}</ref>\n\nFitzalan followed Henry in his return to England in July 1399, and in the following events which led to the deposition of King Richard II and Henry's crowning as King Henry IV.  He functioned as butler at the coronation, and shortly afterward the new King restored him to his titles and estates.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> These included two notable Earldoms; those of [[Earl of Arundel]] and [[Earl of Surrey]], and large estates in the [[Welsh Marches]].\n\n==The Epiphany Rising==\nEarly the next year a group of Barons who had been close to the deposed King Richard II revolted&mdash;known as the [[Epiphany Rising]]&mdash;amongst them Fitzalan's former guardian John Holland.  The latter was captured by followers of Fitzalan's aunt Joan, Countess of [[Hereford]], and at Fitzalan's behest was soon executed (some claim he was tortured first).\n\n==The rebellion of Owain Glyndwr in Wales==\nThe next few years Fitzalan was much occupied by events in the Welsh marches, where he had to help deal with the revolt of [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]] which ran in full from 1400 to maybe 1412 but gained a great deal of early momentum until 1405. After the [[Battle of Shrewsbury]] in 1403 he was appointed to defend the Marches from further attacks along its full length and then focused on defeating Glyndwr in the northern March adjacent to North Wales.\n\n==Revolt in the North==\nIn 1405 there was a revolt in the north of England, led by the [[Archbishop of York]], [[Richard Scrope (cleric)|Richard le Scrope]], and the [[Earl of Norfolk]], [[Thomas de Mowbray, 4th Earl of Norfolk|Thomas de Mowbray]]. Fitzalan was the head of the Commission which condemned the pair to death. This apparently led to a falling out between Fitzalan and his uncle, Archbishop Thomas Arundel, who objected to the execution of a fellow prelate.\n\n==Portuguese alliance and marriages==\nKing Henry's sister, [[Philippa of Lancaster]], had married King [[John I of Portugal]], and to further cement the alliance between England and Portugal, Fitzalan married [[Beatrice of Portugal (1386-1447)|Beatrice]], the illegitimate daughter of King John. The wedding took place in [[London]] on 26 November 1405, with King Henry IV in attendance.\n\n==Welsh conflicts and alliance with Burgundy==\nIn the following years Fitzalan again had to help suppress revolts in [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches]].  Politically, Fitzalan allied himself with the King's half-brothers the Beauforts, and when [[Thomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter]], was appointed Chancellor in 1410, Fitzalan became one of the King's principal councillors. Beaufort favored an alliance with [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], and Fitzalan was one of the leaders of those sent to help fight the rival [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnac]] faction in France. Sometime in this period Fitzalan was made a [[Knight of the Garter]].\n\nHenry IV fell seriously ill in 1411, but was determined to forge an alliance with John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy.  The King announced his intention that a fleet would be sailing to Calais, and issued instructions to ambassadors to go to Burgundy's offer of a military aid against Orleans.  But two days before the fleet was due to sail, the king changed his mind, and on 21 September 1411 declared Parliament would meet in November.  Instead Arundel set sail with a private fleet and a mercenary force hired by the Burgundians from the Prince of Wales.  Arundel found himself in a difficult dilemma: the king wanted an Armagnac alliance, but the prince preferred to deal with Burgundy.  A double-dealing policy commenced negotiating with the duke of Berry while continuing to reinforce Burgundy.  But the old king recovered at the November Parliament, and the prince's Regency council was dismissed.  On 9 November, Arundel led 1000 [[longbowmen|archers]] to aid the Burgundians to victory before the bridge at the [[Battle of St Cloud]], near Paris.  Some of Arundel's men fought in the ranks of Duke's bodyguard.<ref>{{harvnb|Wylie|Waugh|1914\u20131929|pp=188, 195}}; {{harvnb|Mortimer|2009|p=15}}.</ref>\n\nThe Peace of Chartres signed by Henry IV in 1409 was broken.  His policy of pro-Valois Armagnac diplomacy was enshrined in the [[Treaty of Bourges]].  But no sooner had it been signed on 20 May, the friends of the Burgundian elites declared it illegal, because it was.  John the Fearless raised a royal army forcing Berry to surrender Bourges in the name of Charles VI on 15 July. The very next day the peace was renewed by the French nobility in a promissory letter to Henry IV signed by the dukes of Berry, Orleans, Bourbon and Burgundy.  On 10 August 1412, the peace was again threatened by Thomas, Duke of Clarence who extorted an humiliating ransom from the Armagnacs after he had landed at St Vaast-le-Hogue.  The King favoured Clarence over his older brother, so the Beauforts lost influence, and Arundel retired to his estates.  Clarence was instructed to proceed to Gascony to await; the next spring King Henry IV died.\n\n== Great friend and soldier of Henry V ==\nArundel was with Henry at Westminster for Christmas 1414.  One of the king's close friends he displayed the cardinal virtues of loyalty to the Lancastrian monarchy, as well as enjoying the honour of personal comradeship.  Some lords remained loyal to Richard II and threatened rebellion throughout the north.  There were those on the Welsh Marches, such as the Chamberlain of Chester who had deserted to Owain Glendower.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=29}}}\n\nThe new King [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] restored the Earl of Arundel to a place of influence, immediately appointing him Lord Treasurer, as well as constable of [[Dover Castle]] and [[Warden of the Cinque Ports]].  On 19 March 1415 The Lord Warden was ordered to summon and array seamen for a forthcoming fleet operations: 57 ships from the Cinque Ports in 40 days were expected to assemble.  No ship more than 20 tuns was permitted to leave port.  All requisitioned vessels were to be taken to Southampton by 8 May.  On St George's Day at Windsor Arundel was made a Knight of the Garter with precedence.  He was among 16 of the 25 knights preparing for war that summer.  The following day 24 April, the king rewarded his friend with an additional \u00a3300 on top of a modest salary as Lord Treasurer of \u00a3100 per annum.  Arundel's experience deploying massed ranks of longbowmen was vital to Henry's strategy to succeed; as many as 2000 had been used at St Cloud.\n\nBut the invasion date was put back to 1 July, at the end of April.  On 15 June a service was held at St Paul's; Arundel could not have known he would not return in triumph, so he lingered at least until 24 June.  Meanwhile, he was despatched on an expedition \"into parts of Wales\" to raise more archers to add complement to existing units.  The royal household paid him \u00a318 12s expenses, but the coffers being bare, Arundel's troops did not receive all their wages.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=586-7}}\n\nOn 27 May 1415, Arundel and Thomas Beaufort had been put in charge of provisioning Calais and the army in Normandy.<ref>''Calendar of Pipe Rolls'', pp. 336, 338.</ref> This included a scheme devised by the Keeper of the Privy Seal to extort money out of Italian merchants in London that raised nearly \u00a32000.  As they were about to leave (8 August) Southampton by ship, King Henry replaced Arundel with a new Treasurer, [[Sir John Rothenhale]];  Arundel was on the campaign to fight.  He wrote a will signing over his estates to trustees for his wife, Beatrice, Countess Arundel and the children for which he gained the King's consent.<ref>''Calendar of Pipe Rolls'', p.396; {{harvnb|Taylor|Roskell|1975|pp=33-5}}; {{harvnb|Mortimer|2009|p=206}}</ref>\n\n''Noblesse oblige'' was one of Arundel's personal chivalric codes.  When it was revealed the earl of March was inveigled into the Southampton Plot, Arundel and Lord Scrope provided the bulk of 10,000 marks fine imposed by Henry for this illegal marriage to Anne Stafford.  Arundel's astute business dealings saved March and the King at the Michaelmas Council, which was in uproar.  Bishop Richard Countenay of Norwich had died, the duke of Clarence was ill, but Arundel remained the King's \"great friend\".  The Southampton plotters attempted to implicate Arundel, but as their testimony unravelled it became clear Sir Thomas Gray was speaking spiteful lies, and the young earl was held to be without blame.<ref>Pugh, pp.169-170{{explain|date=December 2018|reason=Pugh not mentioned in sources}}; {{harvnb|Mortimer|2009|pp=552, 590}}.</ref>\n\nArundel was one of the initial commanders of Henry V's 1415 French campaign, he sailed with a minimum one hundred men-at-arms, and three hundred archers.  Of his own retinue two men-at-arms and thirteen archers died at the [[siege of Harfleur]].  At least fourteen men-at-arms and sixty-eight archers were sick, and sent home on the Feast of St Wenceslas (29 Sept); Arundel was among them with five men-at-arms to help him.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|Roskell|1975|p=61}}; {{harvnb|Curry|2006|pp=122-3}}; {{harvnb|Mortimer|2009|p=560}}.</ref>  The Council advised the king against a proposed march to Calais; but Arundel had to return to Sussex on 10 October 1415.  He was nursed by a faithful retainer's wife, Elizabeth Ryman.  In his will made on 10 October, he asked to be buried in the church of the Holy Trinity, Arundel.  He left 200 marks for a funeral, and required a statue be erected over his father's grave.  He had pledged a vow to pray to St John of Bridlington when he was a servant of Prince Hal; and now at Mary Gate, Arundel a chapel was to be built dedicated to the Virgin.  Arundel wanted all the wages arrears to be paid by his heirs that were owed to soldiery.<ref>{{harvnb|Rawcliffe|1999|p=182}}; {{harvnb|Nicolas|1826|p=186|ref=bank}}; {{harvnb|Mortimer|2009|pp=395-7}}.</ref>\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|title=Ancestors of Thomas FitzAlan, 5th Earl of Arundel\n\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

When he was 16 his father was executed (1397) and his lands and titles forfeited. Fitzalan was a royal ward of King Richard's half-brother [[John Holland, 1st Duke of Exeter]], along with a large part of the [[Arundel]] estates.  Holland greatly mistreated him, a matter Fitzalan would cruelly repay many years later.\n\n==Escape, exile, return and restoration==\nEventually Fitzalan escaped from his guardian and joined his uncle [[Thomas Arundel]], the deposed [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], in exile. The two eventually joined with another exile, the King's cousin [[Henry Bolingbroke]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Arundel, Earls of|volume=2|page=706}}</ref>\n\nFitzalan followed Henry in his return to England in July 1399, and in the following events which led to the deposition of King Richard II and Henry's crowning as King Henry IV.  He functioned as butler at the coronation, and shortly afterward the new King restored him to his titles and estates.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> These included two notable Earldoms; those of [[Earl of Arundel]] and [[Earl of Surrey]], and large estates in the [[Welsh Marches]].\n\n==The Epiphany Rising==\nEarly the next year a group of Barons who had been close to the deposed King Richard II revolted&mdash;known as the [[Epiphany Rising]]&mdash;amongst them Fitzalan's former guardian John Holland.  The latter was captured by followers of Fitzalan's aunt Joan, Countess of [[Hereford]], and at Fitzalan's behest was soon executed (some claim he was tortured first).\n\n==The rebellion of Owain Glyndwr in Wales==\nThe next few years Fitzalan was much occupied by events in the Welsh marches, where he had to help deal with the revolt of [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]] which ran in full from 1400 to maybe 1412 but gained a great deal of early momentum until 1405. After the [[Battle of Shrewsbury]] in 1403 he was appointed to defend the Marches from further attacks along its full length and then focused on defeating Glyndwr in the northern March adjacent to North Wales.\n\n==Revolt in the North==\nIn 1405 there was a revolt in the north of England, led by the [[Archbishop of York]], [[Richard Scrope (cleric)|Richard le Scrope]], and the [[Earl of Norfolk]], [[Thomas de Mowbray, 4th Earl of Norfolk|Thomas de Mowbray]]. Fitzalan was the head of the Commission which condemned the pair to death. This apparently led to a falling out between Fitzalan and his uncle, Archbishop Thomas Arundel, who objected to the execution of a fellow prelate.\n\n==Portuguese alliance and marriages==\nKing Henry's sister, [[Philippa of Lancaster]], had married King [[John I of Portugal]], and to further cement the alliance between England and Portugal, Fitzalan married [[Beatrice of Portugal (1386-1447)|Beatrice]], the illegitimate daughter of King John. The wedding took place in [[London]] on 26 November 1405, with King Henry IV in attendance.\n\n==Welsh conflicts and alliance with Burgundy==\nIn the following years Fitzalan again had to help suppress revolts in [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches]].  Politically, Fitzalan allied himself with the King's half-brothers the Beauforts, and when [[Thomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter]] was appointed Chancellor in 1410, Fitzalan became one of the King's principal councillors. Beaufort favored an alliance with [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], and Fitzalan was one of the leaders of those sent to help fight the rival [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnac]] faction in France. Sometime in this period Fitzalan was made a [[Knight of the Garter]].\n\nHenry IV fell seriously ill in 1411, but was determined to forge an alliance with John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy.  The King announced his intention that a fleet would be sailing to Calais, and issued instructions to ambassadors to go to Burgundy's offer of a military aid against Orleans.  But two days before the fleet was due to sail, the king changed his mind, and on 21 September 1411 declared Parliament would meet in November.  Instead Arundel set sail with a private fleet and a mercenary force hired by the Burgundians from the Prince of Wales.  Arundel found himself in a difficult dilemma: the king wanted an Armagnac alliance, but the prince preferred to deal with Burgundy.  A double-dealing policy commenced negotiating with the duke of Berry while continuing to reinforce Burgundy.  But the old king recovered at the November Parliament, and the prince's Regency council was dismissed.  On 9 November, Arundel led 1000 [[longbowmen|archers]] to aid the Burgundians to victory before the bridge at the [[Battle of St Cloud]], near Paris.  Some of Arundel's men fought in the ranks of Duke's bodyguard.<ref>{{harvnb|Wylie|Waugh|1914\u20131929|pp=188, 195}}; {{harvnb|Mortimer|2009|p=15}}.</ref>\n\nThe Peace of Chartres signed by Henry IV in 1409 was broken.  His policy of pro-Valois Armagnac diplomacy was enshrined in the [[Treaty of Bourges]].  But no sooner had it been signed on 20 May, the friends of the Burgundian elites declared it illegal, because it was.  John the Fearless raised a royal army forcing Berry to surrender Bourges in the name of Charles VI on 15 July. The very next day the peace was renewed by the French nobility in a promissory letter to Henry IV signed by the dukes of Berry, Orleans, Bourbon and Burgundy.  On 10 August 1412, the peace was again threatened by Thomas, Duke of Clarence who extorted an humiliating ransom from the Armagnacs after he had landed at St Vaast-le-Hogue.  The King favoured Clarence over his older brother, so the Beauforts lost influence, and Arundel retired to his estates.  Clarence was instructed to proceed to Gascony to await; the next spring King Henry IV died.\n\n== Great friend and soldier of Henry V ==\nArundel was with Henry at Westminster for Christmas 1414.  One of the king's close friends he displayed the cardinal virtues of loyalty to the Lancastrian monarchy, as well as enjoying the honour of personal comradeship.  Some lords remained loyal to Richard II and threatened rebellion throughout the north.  There were those on the Welsh Marches, such as the Chamberlain of Chester who had deserted to Owain Glendower.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=29}}}\n\nThe new King [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] restored the Earl of Arundel to a place of influence, immediately appointing him Lord Treasurer, as well as constable of [[Dover Castle]] and [[Warden of the Cinque Ports]].  On 19 March 1415 The Lord Warden was ordered to summon and array seamen for a forthcoming fleet operations: 57 ships from the Cinque Ports in 40 days were expected to assemble.  No ship more than 20 tuns was permitted to leave port.  All requisitioned vessels were to be taken to Southampton by 8 May.  On St George's Day at Windsor Arundel was made a Knight of the Garter with precedence.  He was among 16 of the 25 knights preparing for war that summer.  The following day 24 April, the king rewarded his friend with an additional \u00a3300 on top of a modest salary as Lord Treasurer of \u00a3100 per annum.  Arundel's experience deploying massed ranks of longbowmen was vital to Henry's strategy to succeed; as many as 2000 had been used at St Cloud.\n\nBut the invasion date was put back to 1 July, at the end of April.  On 15 June a service was held at St Paul's; Arundel could not have known he would not return in triumph, so he lingered at least until 24 June.  Meanwhile, he was despatched on an expedition \"into parts of Wales\" to raise more archers to add complement to existing units.  The royal household paid him \u00a318 12s expenses, but the coffers being bare, Arundel's troops did not receive all their wages.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=586-7}}\n\nOn 27 May 1415, Arundel and Thomas Beaufort had been put in charge of provisioning Calais and the army in Normandy.<ref>''Calendar of Pipe Rolls'', pp. 336, 338.</ref> This included a scheme devised by the Keeper of the Privy Seal to extort money out of Italian merchants in London that raised nearly \u00a32000.  As they were about to leave (8 August) Southampton by ship, King Henry replaced Arundel with a new Treasurer, [[Sir John Rothenhale]];  Arundel was on the campaign to fight.  He wrote a will signing over his estates to trustees for his wife, Beatrice, Countess Arundel and the children for which he gained the King's consent.<ref>''Calendar of Pipe Rolls'', p.396; {{harvnb|Taylor|Roskell|1975|pp=33-5}}; {{harvnb|Mortimer|2009|p=206}}</ref>\n\n''Noblesse oblige'' was one of Arundel's personal chivalric codes.  When it was revealed the earl of March was inveigled into the Southampton Plot, Arundel and Lord Scrope provided the bulk of 10,000 marks fine imposed by Henry for this illegal marriage to Anne Stafford.  Arundel's astute business dealings saved March and the King at the Michaelmas Council, which was in uproar.  Bishop Richard Countenay of Norwich had died, the duke of Clarence was ill, but Arundel remained the King's \"great friend\".  The Southampton plotters attempted to implicate Arundel, but as their testimony unravelled it became clear Sir Thomas Gray was speaking spiteful lies, and the young earl was held to be without blame.<ref>Pugh, pp.169-170{{explain|date=December 2018|reason=Pugh not mentioned in sources}}; {{harvnb|Mortimer|2009|pp=552, 590}}.</ref>\n\nArundel was one of the initial commanders of Henry V's 1415 French campaign, he sailed with a minimum one hundred men-at-arms, and three hundred archers.  Of his own retinue two men-at-arms and thirteen archers died at the [[siege of Harfleur]].  At least fourteen men-at-arms and sixty-eight archers were sick, and sent home on the Feast of St Wenceslas (29 Sept); Arundel was among them with five men-at-arms to help him.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|Roskell|1975|p=61}}; {{harvnb|Curry|2006|pp=122-3}}; {{harvnb|Mortimer|2009|p=560}}.</ref>  The Council advised the king against a proposed march to Calais; but Arundel had to return to Sussex on 10 October 1415.  He was nursed by a faithful retainer's wife, Elizabeth Ryman.  In his will made on 10 October, he asked to be buried in the church of the Holy Trinity, Arundel.  He left 200 marks for a funeral, and required a statue be erected over his father's grave.  He had pledged a vow to pray to St John of Bridlington when he was a servant of Prince Hal; and now at Mary Gate, Arundel a chapel was to be built dedicated to the Virgin.  Arundel wanted all the wages arrears to be paid by his heirs that were owed to soldiery.<ref>{{harvnb|Rawcliffe|1999|p=182}}; {{harvnb|Nicolas|1826|p=186|ref=bank}}; {{harvnb|Mortimer|2009|pp=395-7}}.</ref>\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|title=Ancestors of Thomas FitzAlan, 5th Earl of Arundel\n\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

Paul had signed a lease in London's [[White City Place]] for a space for the Paul Institute.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.propertyweek.com/news/paul-institute-finds-home-at-white-city-place/5093537.article|title=Paul Institute finds home at White City Place|work=Property Week|access-date=2017-11-22}}</ref> Later that month, Paul Institute released two new singles; \"Mystery\", by Fabiana Palladino, with production credits to Jai Paul, and \"Evil\", by Ruthven, with production credits to A.K.

K. Paul on guitar, production, writing and mixing.\n\n===2019\u2013present: Return from hiatus and release of leaked material===\nIn 2019, the leak was made official and digitally available as ''[[Leak 04-13 (Bait Ones)]]'' to his website and streaming services.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jai-paul.com/|title=Jai-Paul.com|access-date=2019-06-04}}</ref> The download included a long letter by Paul where he writes about how the music probably got leaked; 'I don't really know. I believe these particular versions of tracks may have come from a burned CD that got misplaced - a fair amount of people would have had access to my music in various forms between 2010 and 2013.'\n.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/jai-paul-returns-with-2-new-songs-listen/|title=Jai Paul Returns With 2 New Songs, Officially Drops 2013 Leaked Album|website=pitchfork.com|access-date=2019-06-04}}</ref> In the same letter, Paul also addresses the speculation about leaking the music himself: 'I was also frustrated by how all this was being framed online, leading to the widespread belief that I had decided to leak my own music, despite my record label and I saying otherwise. It didn't fit at all with anything I had done previously in style or attitude, and especially not in presentation.'\n\nHe also released two new singles, \"He\" and \"Do You Love Her Now\", as a double [[b-side]] to the ''Bait Ones'' album. This marked Paul's return from a hiatus of more than seven years after the release of his last single, \"Jasmine\".<ref name=\"p4knew2019\" /> Paul provided miscellaneous production to the [[Childish Gambino]]'s track \"[[Time (Childish Gambino song)|Time]]\" featuring [[Ariana Grande]] on the album ''[[3.15.20]]'', released in March 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/81088/Childish-Gambino-03.15.20/|title=Review: Childish Gambino - 03.15.20|website=[[Sputnikmusic]]|date=March 30, 2020|author=Rowan5215|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Relationship with media and industry==\nMusic media has speculated about Paul's background, motivation and intent as he has remained out of the public eye, and his professional music career has not followed convention thus far. English publication ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]'' noted Paul's distinctiveness early on, saying in 2011 \"Hype is a fascinating commodity.
