Some pretribulationists believe that those who choose to follow [[God in Christianity|God]] will be [[rapture]]d before the tribulation, and thus escape it.{{cn|date=June 2018}} On the other hand, some [[Posttribulation rapture|posttribulationists]] (Christians who believe the rapture is synonymous with the resurrection that takes place after the Tribulation) believe Christians must endure the Tribulation as a test of their faith.{{cn|date=June 2018}}\n\nAccording to [[Dispensationalism|dispensationalists]] who hold the futurist view, the Tribulation is thought to occur before the Second Coming of Jesus and during the [[End time|End Times]]. In this view, the Tribulation will last seven prophetic Hebrew years (lasting 360 days each) in all but the Great Tribulation will be the second half of the Tribulation period (see [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Matthew#Chapter 24|Matt 24:15]] and [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Matthew#Chapter 24|Matt 24:21]] showing the Great Tribulation is after the [[Abomination of Desolation]], which marks the midpoint of the Tribulation).\n\nIn this view, this seven-year period is considered to be the final week of Daniel's [[Prophecy of Seventy Weeks]], found in Daniel chapter 9. It is theorized that each week represents seven years, with the timetable beginning from [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes]]' order to rebuild the [[Second Temple]] in Jerusalem. After seven weeks and 62 weeks, the prophecy says that the [[messiah]] will be \"cut off\", which is taken to correspond to the death of [[Christ]]. This is seen as creating a break of indeterminate length in the timeline, with one week remaining to be fulfilled.\n\n(Spirit showed 1st edit ever! Praise God,there is not a week missing, its the 1st week of creation)\n\nThe time period for these beliefs is also based on other passages: in the Book of Daniel, \"[[time, times, and half a time]]\", interpreted as \"three and a half years,\" and the Book of Revelation, \"a thousand two hundred and threescore days\" and \"forty and two months\" (the prophetic month averaging 30 days, hence 1260/30 = 42 months or 3.5 years). The 1290 days of {{bibleref|Daniel|12:11}}, (rather than the 1260 days of {{bibleref|Revelation|11:3}}), is thought to be the result of either a simple [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary]] leap month adjustment, or due to further calculations related to the prophecy, or due to an intermediate stage of time that is to prepare the world for the beginning of the [[Millennialism|millennial reign]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Tim F. LaHaye|author2=Thomas Ice|title=Charting the End Times: A Visual Guide to Understanding Bible Prophecy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ESz8LZW5d-gC|year=2001|pp=66-67|publisher=Harvest House Publishers|isbn=978-0-7369-0138-3}}</ref>\n\n====Events====\nAmong Futurists there are differing views about what will happen to Christians during the Tribulation:\n* Pretribulationists believe that all righteous Christians (dead and alive) will be taken bodily up to [[Heaven]] (called the rapture) before the Tribulation begins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%20Thessalonians%204.13-18|title=1 Thessalonians 4:13\u201318 (ESV) - \"But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep, that you may not grieve as others do who ...\" - Biblia.com|work=Biblia|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref> According to this belief, every true Christian that has ever existed throughout the course of the entire Christian era will be instantaneously transformed into a perfect resurrected body, and will thus escape the trials of the Tribulation. Those who become Christians after the rapture will live through (or perish during) the Tribulation. After the Tribulation, Christ will return to establish his Millennial Kingdom.\n* Prewrath Tribulationists believe the rapture will occur during the Tribulation, halfway through or after, but before the [[seven bowls]] of the [[Divine retribution|wrath of God]].\n* [[Midtribulationism|Midtribulationists]] believe that the rapture will occur halfway through the Tribulation, but before the worst part of it occurs. The seven-year period is divided into halves\u2014the \"beginning of sorrows\" and the \"Great Tribulation\".\n* [[Post Tribulation Rapture|Posttribulationists]] believe that Christians will not be taken up into Heaven for eternity, but will be received or gathered in the air by Christ, to descend together to establish the [[Kingdom of God]] on earth at the end of the Tribulation.\n\nIn pretribulationism and midtribulationism, the rapture and the Second Coming of Christ are separate events, while in post-tribulationism the two events are identical or simultaneous. Another feature of the pre- and mid-tribulation beliefs is the idea that after the rapture, Christ will return for a third time (when also counting the first coming) to set up his kingdom on the earth.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nThe [[Catholic Church]] teaches that there will be a \"final Passover\" or last \"purgatory\" before the final [[parousia]] (Second Coming), in which the church will \"pass through a final fire that will shake the faith of many\". Generally neither the Catholic Church, nor the various [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and [[Anglican communion|Anglican]] communions and older Protestant denominations, use the term \"rapture\", and tend towards [[amillennialism]]. In this view, the millennium is regarded as the initial period of Christ's reign (manifested in the life of the church) that began with the Pentecost and will lead up to the messiah's eventual return, with the final outcome being a single and permanent event at the end of present time.<ref name=\"Catholic Catechism (tribulation)\">{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|date=1994|publisher=Doubleday (Image Books)|isbn=0-385-47967-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/catechismofcatho00cath/page/193 193\u2013194]|edition=First|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/catechismofcatho00cath/page/193}} Cannons #675-677</ref><ref name=\"Switzer (Cath. escat.)\">{{cite web|last1=Switzer|first1=John|title=Do Catholics believe in the Rapture?|url=http://www.uscatholic.org/articles/201407/do-catholics-believe-rapture-29196|website=US Catholic|accessdate=September 10, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Preble\">{{cite web|last1=Preble|first1=Peter-Michael, Fr.|title=Judgement Day: and Orthodox Perspective|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/fr-petermichael-preble/judgement-day-may-21st-an_b_863995.html|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=September 10, 2016|date=July 19, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Anglcian (eschat.)\">{{cite web|author1=Fr.

It occurred entirely in the past, around 70 AD when the armed forces of the [[Roman Empire]] destroyed Jerusalem and its temple.\n\nA preterist discussion of the Tribulation has its focus on the Gospels, in particular the prophetic passages in Matthew 24, Mark 13 and Luke 21, rather than on the [[Apocalypse]] or Book of Revelation. (Preterists apply much of the symbolism in the Revelation to Rome, the [[Caesar (title)|C\u00e6sars]], and their persecution of Christians, rather than to the Tribulation upon the Jews.)\n\nJesus' warning in {{bibleref|Matthew|24:34}} that \"this generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled\" is tied back to his similar warning to the [[Scribes]] and the [[Pharisees]] that their judgment would \"come upon this generation\" ({{bibleref|Matthew|23:36}}), that is, during the first century rather than at a future time long after the Scribes and Pharisees had died. The destruction in 70 AD occurred within a 40-year generation from the time when Jesus gave that discourse.\n\nThe judgment on the Jewish nation was executed by the Roman legions, \"the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet\" ({{bibleref|Matthew|24:15}}).\n\nSince Matthew 24 begins with Jesus visiting the [[Jerusalem]] Temple and pronouncing that \"there shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down\" (vs. 3), preterists see nothing in Scripture to indicate that another Jewish temple will ever be built.  The prophecies were all fulfilled on the then-existing temple that Jesus spoke about and that was subsequently destroyed within that generation.\n\n===Historicism===\nThe [[Historicism (Christianity)|Historicist]] view applies Tribulation to the period known as \"persecution of the saints\" (Daniel 7, Revelation 13). This is believed to have begun with the period after the \"falling away\" when papal Rome came to power for 1260 years from 538 to 1798 (using the [[Day-year principle]]). They believe that the Tribulation is not a future event, but it intensifies right at the end to a time such as never before.<ref>Benware, Paul N.

Some pretribulationists believe that those who choose to follow [[God in Christianity|God]] will be [[rapture]]d before the tribulation, and thus escape it.{{cn|date=June 2018}} On the other hand, some [[Posttribulation rapture|posttribulationists]] (Christians who believe the rapture is synonymous with the resurrection that takes place after the Tribulation) believe Christians must endure the Tribulation as a test of their faith.{{cn|date=June 2018}}\n\nAccording to [[Dispensationalism|dispensationalists]] who hold the futurist view, the Tribulation is thought to occur before the Second Coming of Jesus and during the [[End time|End Times]]. In this view, the Tribulation will last seven prophetic Hebrew years (lasting 360 days each) in all but the Great Tribulation will be the second half of the Tribulation period (see [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Matthew#Chapter 24|Matt 24:15]] and [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Matthew#Chapter 24|Matt 24:21]] showing the Great Tribulation is after the [[Abomination of Desolation]], which marks the midpoint of the Tribulation).\n\nIn this view, this seven-year period is considered to be the final week of Daniel's [[Prophecy of Seventy Weeks]], found in Daniel chapter 9. It is theorized that each week represents seven years, with the timetable beginning from [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes]]' order to rebuild the [[Second Temple]] in Jerusalem. After seven weeks and 62 weeks, the prophecy says that the [[messiah]] will be \"cut off\", which is taken to correspond to the death of [[Christ]]. This is seen as creating a break of indeterminate length in the timeline, with one week remaining to be fulfilled.\n\nThe time period for these beliefs is also based on other passages: in the Book of Daniel, \"[[time, times, and half a time]]\", interpreted as \"three and a half years,\" and the Book of Revelation, \"a thousand two hundred and threescore days\" and \"forty and two months\" (the prophetic month averaging 30 days, hence 1260/30 = 42 months or 3.5 years). The 1290 days of {{bibleref|Daniel|12:11}}, (rather than the 1260 days of {{bibleref|Revelation|11:3}}), is thought to be the result of either a simple [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary]] leap month adjustment, or due to further calculations related to the prophecy, or due to an intermediate stage of time that is to prepare the world for the beginning of the [[Millennialism|millennial reign]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Tim F.

Those who become Christians after the rapture will live through (or perish during) the Tribulation. After the Tribulation, Christ will return to establish his Millennial Kingdom.\n* Prewrath Tribulationists believe the rapture will occur during the Tribulation, halfway through or after, but before the [[seven bowls]] of the [[Divine retribution|wrath of God]].\n* [[Midtribulationism|Midtribulationists]] believe that the rapture will occur halfway through the Tribulation, but before the worst part of it occurs. The seven-year period is divided into halves\u2014the \"beginning of sorrows\" and the \"Great Tribulation\".\n* [[Post Tribulation Rapture|Posttribulationists]] believe that Christians will not be taken up into Heaven for eternity, but will be received or gathered in the air by Christ, to descend together to establish the [[Kingdom of God]] on earth at the end of the Tribulation.\n\nIn pretribulationism and midtribulationism, the rapture and the Second Coming of Christ are separate events, while in post-tribulationism the two events are identical or simultaneous. Another feature of the pre- and mid-tribulation beliefs is the idea that after the rapture, Christ will return for a third time (when also counting the first coming) to set up his kingdom on the earth.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nThe [[Catholic Church]] teaches that there will be a \"final Passover\" or last \"purgatory\" before the final [[parousia]] (Second Coming), in which the church will \"pass through a final fire that will shake the faith of many\". Generally neither the Catholic Church, nor the various [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and [[Anglican communion|Anglican]] communions and older Protestant denominations, use the term \"rapture\", and tend towards [[amillennialism]].

Champion Luger, manager Race and bodyguard Hughes formed a heel faction, inflicting beatdowns to Luger's challengers and with Hughes and Race interfering in Luger's title matches.  This ultimately resulted in Hughes being banned from ringside for Luger's high profile title defences against [[Ron Simmons]] at [[Halloween Havoc 1991]] and [[Rick Steiner]] at [[Clash of the Champions XVII]].  Still managed by Race, in early 1992 he also teamed frequently with [[Big Van Vader]], [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]] and [[Vinnie Vegas]].\n\nIn summer 1992, near the end of his WCW run, he turned face and became Big Cat again, teaming with [[Junkyard Dog]] to feud with [[The Insiders (professional wrestling)|The Vegas Connection]].\n\n===World Wrestling Federation (1993)===\nAfter a short stint in the [[United States Wrestling Association]], Hughes briefly joined the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]], as part of the [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] between [[The Undertaker]] and [[Harvey Wippleman]].

This was revealed to be a set up however as [[Ken Shamrock]] attacked and both attacked Shamrock with \"Gracie\" revealing himself to be Mr. Hughes his new  bodyguard (as Curtis Hughes).  Hughes was notably smaller in this run having lost a significant amount of weight.  He aligned himself with Jericho and Howard Finkel (who was Jericho's lackey at the time) however Jericho turned on him during a [[tag team]] match and Hughes lost Finkel in a poker game to the APA.

In 2014, Kaltrina Neziri was supposed to compete for Miss Earth but her visa was denied and was not able to compete. The organizer decided that she would compete for the following year, instead.

They are inhabitants of Cameroon's West and Northwest Regions. They are part of the [[Semi-Bantu]] (or Grassfields Bantu) [[ethnic group]].  The Bamileke are regrouped under several groups, each under the guidance of a [[Tribal chief|chief]] or [[Fon (Cameroon)|fon]]. They speak a number of related languages from the [[Bantoid languages|Bantoid]] branch of the [[Niger\u2013Congo language family]]. These languages are closely related, however, and some classifications identify a [[Bamileke languages|Bamileke]] [[dialect continuum]] with seventeen or more dialects. The Bamileke people are known for their very striking and often intricately beaded masquerades, including the impressive elephant mask.\n\n==Organization==\nThe Bamileke are organized under several chiefdom (or fondom). Of these, the fondoms of [[Bafang]], [[Bafoussam]], [[Bandjoun]], [[Baham, Cameroon|Baham]], [[Bangangt\u00e9]], [[Bawaju]], [[Dschang]], and [[Mbouda]] are the most prominent. The Bamileke also share much history and culture with the neighbouring fondoms of the [[Northwest Region, Cameroon|Northwest region]] and notably the [[Lebialem]] region of the [[Southwest Region, Cameroon|Southwest region]], but the groups have been divided since their territories were split between the French and English in [[Scramble for Africa|colonial times]].\n\n==Languages==\n{{main|Bamileke languages}}\nFollowing Ethnologue classification, we can identify 11 different languages or dialects:\n\nVariants of [[Ghomala']] are spoken in most of the [[Mifi]], [[Koung-Khi]], [[Hauts-Plateaux]] [[Departments of Cameroon|department]]s, the eastern [[Menoua]], and portions of [[Bamboutos]], by 260,00 people (1982, SIL). The main fondoms are [[Baham, Cameroon|Baham]], [[Bafoussam]], [[Bamendjou]], [[Bandjoun]].\n\nTowards southwest is spoken [[Fe'fe' language|Fe'fe']] in the [[Haut-Nkam|Upper Nkam division]]. The main towns include [[Bafang]], [[Baku]], and [[K\u00e9kem]].\n\n[[Nda'nda']] occupy the western third of the [[Nd\u00e9]] division. The major settlement is at [[Bazou]].\n\n[[Yemba language|Yemba]] is spoken by 300,000 or more people in 1992. Their lands span most of the [[Menoua]] division to the west of the Bandjoun, with their capital at [[Dschang]]. [[Fokou\u00e9]] is another major settlement.\n\n[[Medumba]] is spoken in most of the Nd\u00e9 division, by 210,000 people in 1991, with major settlements at [[Bangangt\u00e9]] and [[Tonga]].\n\n[[Mengaka]], [[Ngiemboon]], [[Ngomba language|Ngomba]] and [[Ngombale]] are spoken in [[Mbouda]].\n\n'''Kwa''' is spoken between the Nd\u00e9 and the Littoral region, '''[[Ngwe language|Ngwe]]''' around Fontem in the Southwest region, and [[Mmuock language|Mmuock (language)]] by the [[Mmuock]] people in the Lebialem division of the Southwest region.\n\nBamileke belongs to the Mbam-Nkam group of Grassfields languages, whose attachment to the Bantu division is still disputed. While some consider it a Bantu or semi-Bantu language, others prefer to include Bamileke in the [[Niger-Congo]] group.<ref name=\"Bamileke Language\">{{cite web |title=Cameroon: Treatment of members of the Bamileke tribe by the authorities, and the language spoken and written by this tribe |url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/3f7d4d7134.html |website=Refworld |publisher=Canada: Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada |accessdate=10 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:V\u00e9g\u00e9tation Bamougong.jpg|left|thumb|Bamileke Grassland|alt=]]\n<!---Main source: ''\u201cHistoire et anthropologie du peuple bamil\u00e9k\u00e9\u201d'' (Paris: l\u2019Harmattan, 2016, 338p.), by Dieudonn\u00e9 Toukam.ISBN 978-2-296-11827-0--->\nThe Bamileke, whose origins trace to Egypt,{{citation needed}} migrated to what is now northern Cameroon between the 11th and 14th centuries. In the 17th century they migrated further south and west to avoid being forced to convert to Islam. Today, a majority of peoples within this people cluster are Christians. The Bamileke are the native people of three regions of Cameroon, namely West, North-West and South-West. Though greater part of this people are from the West region, it is estimated that almost half of Bamileke are from the English speaking regions, the majority of which are from the North-West region (there are 123 Bamileke groupings in this region, against 6 in the South-West and 106 in the Western region). The Grassfields area therefore encompasses the West and North-West and small part of the South-West region of Cameroon. Apart from the Bamileke, there are other tribes that are historically more or less linked to the Bamileke, whether by blood or through certain cultural intercourse  (Dieudonn\u00e9 Toukam, \u201cHistoire et anthropologie du peuple bamil\u00e9k\u00e9\u201d, 2016), as well as recently settled foreigners (Fulani, Haoussa, Igbo, etc.)\n\nThe Bamileke speak a semi-Bantu language and are related to [[Bantu peoples]].  Historically, the [[Bamum people|Bamun]] and the Bamileke were united. The founder of the Bamun group ([[Nchare]]) was the younger brother of the founder of Bafoussam. Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9 are a group comprising many tribes. In this group, there are several superficial cultural disparities, including Dschang, Bafang, [[Baga people|Bagangt\u00e9]], Mbouda and Bafoussam.\n\nDuring the mid-17th century, the Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9 people's forefathers left the North to avoid being forced to convert to Islam. They migrated as far south as Foumban. Conquerors came all the way to Foumban to try to impose Islam on them. A war began, pushing some people to leave while others remained, submitting to Islam. This marks the division between the Bamun and Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9 people.\n\nBantu refers to a large, complex linguistic grouping of peoples in Africa. The Cameroon-Bamileke Bantu people cluster encompasses multiple Bantu ethnic groups primarily found in Cameroon, the largest of which is the Bamileke. [[File:Funeral rite in Mmuock Leteh.jpg|thumb|A funeral rite performed in Mmuock Leteh, Southwest Region|alt=]]\nIn the 17th century they migrated further south and west to avoid being forced to convert to Islam. Another reason for migration was to resist enslavement during the [[Atlantic Slave Trade]]. Today, a majority of peoples within this people cluster are Christians.\n\n===German administration===\n[[Germany]] gained control of \"Kamerun\" in 1884. <!-- The Bamileke quickly adapted to the new realities of [[colonialism]] by establishing themselves as enterprising traders and partners with the new rulers. The Germans urged or forced large numbers of Bamileke settlers to move south to work the coastal [[plantation]]s they had planted there. This is wrong. At that time, the German was only at the coast of \"Cameroon\" -->\n\nThe [[Germany|Germans]] first applied the term \"Bamileke\" to the people as administrative shorthand for the people of the region. <!-- It was during German (and later [[France|French]]) colonial rule that the Bamileke first began to regard themselves as a single, albeit fragmented, people. This is not true-->\n\n===French administration and post-independence===\nThe Bamileke are very dynamic and have a great sense of entrepreneurship. Thus, they can be found in almost all regions of Cameroon and in the world, mainly as business owners.\n\nIn 1955, the colonial French power banned the [[Union des Populations du Cameroun]] (UPC) political party, which was claiming the independence of Cameroon. Following that, the French started an offensive against UPC militants. Much of fighting occurred in the West region, region of the Bamileke. Some tens of thousands of people died in the UPC conflict with French and Cameroonian troops.<ref>The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Africa (1981)</ref><ref>\"WHPSI\": The World Handbook of Political and Social Indicators by Charles Lewis Taylor</ref><ref>Johnson, Willard R. 1970.

Houses of family members are often grouped together, often surrounded by small fields. Men typically clear the fields, but it is largely women who work them. Most work is done with tools such as machetes and hoes. Staple crops include [[Taro|cocoyam]]s, [[peanut|groundnut]]s and [[maize]].\n\nBamileke settlement are organized as chiefdoms. The chief, or ''fon'' or ''fong'' is considered as the spiritual, political, judicial and military leader. The Chief is also considered as the 'Father' of the chiefdom. He thus has great respect from the population. The successor of the 'Father' is chosen among his children. The successor's identity is typically kept secret until the fon's death.\n\nThe fon has typically 9 ministers and several other advisers and councils. The ministers are in charge of the crowning of the new fon.\nThe council of ministers, also known as the Council of Notables is called ''Kamveu''. In addition, a \"queen mother\" or ''mafo'' was an important figure for some fons in the past. Below the fon and his advisers lie a number of ward heads, each responsible for a particular portion of the village. Some Bamileke groups also recognise sub-chiefs, or ''fonte''.\n\n===Economic activities===\nTraditional homes are constructed by first erecting a [[raffia]]-pole frame into four square walls. Builders then stuff the resulting holes with grass and cover the whole building with mud. The thatched roof is typically shaped into a tall cone. Nowadays, however, this type of construction is mostly reserved for barns, storage buildings, and gathering places for various traditional [[secret society|secret societies]]. Instead, modern Bamileke homes are made of bricks of either sun-dried mud or of concrete. Roofs are of metal sheeting.[[File:Fun\u00e9railles-Bamougong.jpg|thumb|Performers enacting a ''zing'', a funeral dance, at Bamougong with elephant mask|alt=Elephant Mask]]\n\n===Religious beliefs===\nDuring the colonial period, parts of the Bamileke adopted [[Christianity]]. Some of them practice [[Islam]] toward the border with the [[Adamawa Region, Cameroon|Adamawa]] Tikar and the Bamun. The Bamileke have worn elephant mask for dance ceremonies or funerals.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n== Royal Tradition and the Arts ==\nMasquerades are an integral part of Bamileke culture and expression. They are donned at special events such as funerals, important palace festivals and other royal ceremonies. The masks are performed by men and aim to support and enforce royal authority.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The visual arts of Africa : gender, power, and life cycle rituals|last=Perani|first=Judith|date=1998|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-442328-3|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|pages=215|oclc=605230100}}</ref>\n\nThe power of a Bamileke king, called a Fon, is often represented by the elephant, buffalo and leopard. Oral traditions proclaim that the Fon may transform into either an elephant or leopard whenever he chooses. An elephant mask, called a ''mbap mteng''is a mask with protruding circular ears, a human like face, decorative panels on the front and back that hang down to the knee and are covered overall in beautiful geometric beadwork including lots of triangle imagery.

It is an art form that is highly personal in that no two pieces are alike and are often used in dazzling colors that catch the eye. They may be an indication of status based on what kinds of beads are used. Beadwork utilized all over on wooden sculptures is a technique that is unique only to the Cameroon grasslands.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|title=African Beaded Art: Power and Adornment|last=Pemberton III|first=John|publisher=Smith College Museum of Art|year=2008|isbn=978-0-87391-058-3|location=Northampton, Massachusetts|pages=5\u20137}}</ref>\n\nBefore they were colonized, popular beads were obtained from Sub-Saharan countries like Nigeria and were made of shells, nuts, wood, seeds, ceramic, ivory, animal bone and metal. Colonization and trade routes with other countries in Europe and the Middle East introduced brightly colored glass beads as well as pearls, coral and rare stones like emeralds. These came at a price, however. There were often agreements with these other countries to exchange these precious luxury commodities for slaves, gold, oil, ivory and some types of fine woods.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n===Succession and kinship patterns===\n[[File:TamTam.jpg|thumb|Bamileke [[Drums in communication|tamtam]]|alt=|left]]\nThe Bamileke trace ancestry, [[inheritance]] and succession through the male line, and children belong to the fondom of their father. After a man's death, all of his possessions typically go to a single, male heir. [[Polygamy]] (more specifically, [[polygyny]]) is practiced, and some important individuals may have literally hundreds of wives. Marriages typically involve a [[bride price]] to be paid to the bride's family.\n\nIt is argued that the Bamileke inheritance customs contributed to their success in the modern world:\n\n\"Succession and inheritance rules are determined by the principle of [[patrilineal]] descent. According to custom, the eldest son is the probable heir, but a father may choose any one of his sons to succeed him. An heir takes his dead father's name and inherits any titles held by the latter, including the right to membership in any societies to which he belonged. And, until the mid-1960s, when the law governing polygamy was changed, the heir also inherited his father's wives--a considerable economic responsibility. The rights in land held by the deceased were conferred upon the heir subject to the approval of the chief, and, in the event of financial inheritance, the heir was not obliged to share this with other family members. The ramifications of this are significant. First, dispossessed family members were not automatically entitled to live off the wealth of the heir. Siblings who did not share in the inheritance were, therefore, strongly encouraged to make it on their own through individual initiative and by assuming responsibility for earning their livelihood. Second, this practice of individual responsibility in contrast to a system of strong family obligations prevented a drain on individual financial resources. Rather than spend all of the inheritance maintaining unproductive family members, the heir could, in the contemporary period, utilize his resources in more financially productive ways such as for savings and investment. [...] Finally, the system of inheritance, along with the large-scale migration resulting from population density and land pressures, is one of the internal incentives that accounts for Bamileke success in the nontraditional world\".<ref>A.I.D. Evaluation Special Study No. 15  THE PRIVATE SECTOR: - Individual Initiative, And Economic Growth In An African Plural Society The Bamileke Of Cameroon http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pnaal016.pdf</ref>\n\n[[Donald L. Horowitz]] also attributes the economic success of the Bamileke to their inheritance customs, arguing that it encouraged younger sons to seek their own living abroad. He wrote in ''Ethnic groups in conflict'': \"Primogeniture among the Bamileke and matrilineal inheritance among the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] of Indonesia have contributed powerfully to the propensity of males from both groups to migrate out of their home region in search of opportunity\".<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/ethnicgroupsinco00horo | url-access=registration | page=[https://archive.org/details/ethnicgroupsinco00horo/page/155 155] |title = Ethnic Groups in Conflict| publisher=University of California Press |isbn = 9780520053854|last1 = Horowitz|first1 = Donald L.|last2 = Donald|first2 = Horowitz L.|last3 = Horowitz|first3 = Professor Donald L.|year = 1985}}</ref>\n\n==Notable Individuals==\nThe Bamileke people have enormously contributed to the development of Cameroon and the word in general.

They are inhabitants of Cameroon's West and Northwest Regions. They are part of the [[Semi-Bantu]] (or Grassfields Bantu) [[ethnic group]].  The Bamileke are regrouped under several groups, each under the guidance of a [[Tribal chief|chief]] or [[Fon (Cameroon)|fon]]. They speak a number of related languages from the [[Bantoid languages|Bantoid]] branch of the [[Niger\u2013Congo language family]]. These languages are closely related, however, and some classifications identify a [[Bamileke languages|Bamileke]] [[dialect continuum]] with seventeen or more dialects. The Bamileke people are known for their very striking and often intricately beaded masquerades, including the impressive elephant mask.\n\n==Organization==\nThe Bamileke are organized under several chiefdom (or fondom). Of these, the fondoms of [[Bafang]], [[Bafoussam]], [[Bandjoun]], [[Baham, Cameroon|Baham]], [[Bangangt\u00e9]], [[Bawaju]], [[Dschang]], and [[Mbouda]] are the most prominent. The Bamileke also share much history and culture with the neighbouring fondoms of the [[Northwest Region, Cameroon|Northwest region]] and notably the [[Lebialem]] region of the [[Southwest Region, Cameroon|Southwest region]], but the groups have been divided since their territories were split between the French and English in [[Scramble for Africa|colonial times]].\n\n==Languages==\n{{main|Bamileke languages}}\nFollowing Ethnologue classification, we can identify 11 different languages or dialects:\n\nVariants of [[Ghomala']] are spoken in most of the [[Mifi]], [[Koung-Khi]], [[Hauts-Plateaux]] [[Departments of Cameroon|department]]s, the eastern [[Menoua]], and portions of [[Bamboutos]], by 260,00 people (1982, SIL). The main fondoms are [[Baham, Cameroon|Baham]], [[Bafoussam]], [[Bamendjou]], [[Bandjoun]].\n\nTowards southwest is spoken [[Fe'fe' language|Fe'fe']] in the [[Haut-Nkam|Upper Nkam division]]. The main towns include [[Bafang]], [[Baku]], and [[K\u00e9kem]].\n\n[[Nda'nda']] occupy the western third of the [[Nd\u00e9]] division. The major settlement is at [[Bazou]].\n\n[[Yemba language|Yemba]] is spoken by 300,000 or more people in 1992. Their lands span most of the [[Menoua]] division to the west of the Bandjoun, with their capital at [[Dschang]]. [[Fokou\u00e9]] is another major settlement.\n\n[[Medumba]] is spoken in most of the Nd\u00e9 division, by 210,000 people in 1991, with major settlements at [[Bangangt\u00e9]] and [[Tonga]].\n\n[[Mengaka]], [[Ngiemboon]], [[Ngomba language|Ngomba]] and [[Ngombale]] are spoken in [[Mbouda]].\n\n'''Kwa''' is spoken between the Nd\u00e9 and the Littoral region, '''[[Ngwe language|Ngwe]]''' around Fontem in the Southwest region, and [[Mmuock language|Mmuock (language)]] by the [[Mmuock]] people in the Lebialem division of the Southwest region.\n\nBamileke belongs to the Mbam-Nkam group of Grassfields languages, whose attachment to the Bantu division is still disputed. While some consider it a Bantu or semi-Bantu language, others prefer to include Bamileke in the [[Niger-Congo]] group.<ref name=\"Bamileke Language\">{{cite web |title=Cameroon: Treatment of members of the Bamileke tribe by the authorities, and the language spoken and written by this tribe |url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/3f7d4d7134.html |website=Refworld |publisher=Canada: Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada |accessdate=10 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:V\u00e9g\u00e9tation Bamougong.jpg|left|thumb|Bamileke Grassland|alt=]]\n<!---Main source: ''\u201cHistoire et anthropologie du peuple bamil\u00e9k\u00e9\u201d'' (Paris: l\u2019Harmattan, 2016, 338p.), by Dieudonn\u00e9 Toukam.ISBN 978-2-296-11827-0--->\nThe Bamileke, whose origins trace to Egypt, migrated to what is now northern Cameroon between the 11th and 14th centuries. In the 17th century they migrated further south and west to avoid being forced to convert to Islam. Today, a majority of peoples within this people cluster are Christians. The Bamileke are the native people of three regions of Cameroon, namely West, North-West and South-West. Though greater part of this people are from the West region, it is estimated that almost half of Bamileke are from the English speaking regions, the majority of which are from the North-West region (there are 123 Bamileke groupings in this region, against 6 in the South-West and 106 in the Western region). The Grassfields area therefore encompasses the West and North-West and small part of the South-West region of Cameroon. Apart from the Bamileke, there are other tribes that are historically more or less linked to the Bamileke, whether by blood or through certain cultural intercourse  (Dieudonn\u00e9 Toukam, \u201cHistoire et anthropologie du peuple bamil\u00e9k\u00e9\u201d, 2016), as well as recently settled foreigners (Fulani, Haoussa, Igbo, etc.)\n\nThe Bamileke speak a semi-Bantu language and are related to [[Bantu peoples]].  Historically, the [[Bamum people|Bamun]] and the Bamileke were united. The founder of the Bamun group ([[Nchare]]) was the younger brother of the founder of Bafoussam. Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9 are a group comprising many tribes. In this group, there are several superficial cultural disparities, including Dschang, Bafang, [[Baga people|Bagangt\u00e9]], Mbouda and Bafoussam.\n\nDuring the mid-17th century, the Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9 people's forefathers left the North to avoid being forced to convert to Islam. They migrated as far south as Foumban. Conquerors came all the way to Foumban to try to impose Islam on them. A war began, pushing some people to leave while others remained, submitting to Islam. This marks the division between the Bamun and Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9 people.\n\nBantu refers to a large, complex linguistic grouping of peoples in Africa. The Cameroon-Bamileke Bantu people cluster encompasses multiple Bantu ethnic groups primarily found in Cameroon, the largest of which is the Bamileke. [[File:Funeral rite in Mmuock Leteh.jpg|thumb|A funeral rite performed in Mmuock Leteh, Southwest Region|alt=]]\nIn the 17th century they migrated further south and west to avoid being forced to convert to Islam. Another reason for migration was to resist enslavement during the [[Atlantic Slave Trade]]. Today, a majority of peoples within this people cluster are Christians.\n\n===German administration===\n[[Germany]] gained control of \"Kamerun\" in 1884. <!-- The Bamileke quickly adapted to the new realities of [[colonialism]] by establishing themselves as enterprising traders and partners with the new rulers. The Germans urged or forced large numbers of Bamileke settlers to move south to work the coastal [[plantation]]s they had planted there. This is wrong. At that time, the German was only at the coast of \"Cameroon\" -->\n\nThe [[Germany|Germans]] first applied the term \"Bamileke\" to the people as administrative shorthand for the people of the region. <!-- It was during German (and later [[France|French]]) colonial rule that the Bamileke first began to regard themselves as a single, albeit fragmented, people. This is not true-->\n\n===French administration and post-independence===\nThe Bamileke are very dynamic and have a great sense of entrepreneurship. Thus, they can be found in almost all regions of Cameroon and in the world, mainly as business owners.\n\nIn 1955, the colonial French power banned the [[Union des Populations du Cameroun]] (UPC) political party, which was claiming the independence of Cameroon. Following that, the French started an offensive against UPC militants. Much of fighting occurred in the West region, region of the Bamileke. Some tens of thousands of people died in the UPC conflict with French and Cameroonian troops.<ref>The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Africa (1981)</ref><ref>\"WHPSI\": The World Handbook of Political and Social Indicators by Charles Lewis Taylor</ref><ref>Johnson, Willard R. 1970.

Princeton: Princeton University Press.</ref>\n\n==Lifestyle and settlement patterns==\n\n===Political structure and agriculture===\n[[Image:Statue d'un chef coutumier \u00e0 Bana.jpg|thumb|Statue of a chief at [[Bana, Cameroon|Bana]]]]\nThe Bamileke's settlements follow a well-organized and structured pattern. Houses of family members are often grouped together, often surrounded by small fields. Men typically clear the fields, but it is largely women who work them. Most work is done with tools such as machetes and hoes. Staple crops include [[Taro|cocoyam]]s, [[peanut|groundnut]]s and [[maize]].\n\nBamileke settlement are organized as chiefdoms. The chief, or ''fon'' or ''fong'' is considered as the spiritual, political, judicial and military leader. The Chief is also considered as the 'Father' of the chiefdom. He thus has great respect from the population. The successor of the 'Father' is chosen among his children. The successor's identity is typically kept secret until the fon's death.\n\nThe fon has typically 9 ministers and several other advisers and councils. The ministers are in charge of the crowning of the new fon.\nThe council of ministers, also known as the Council of Notables is called ''Kamveu''. In addition, a \"queen mother\" or ''mafo'' was an important figure for some fons in the past. Below the fon and his advisers lie a number of ward heads, each responsible for a particular portion of the village. Some Bamileke groups also recognise sub-chiefs, or ''fonte''.\n\n===Economic activities===\nTraditional homes are constructed by first erecting a [[raffia]]-pole frame into four square walls. Builders then stuff the resulting holes with grass and cover the whole building with mud. The thatched roof is typically shaped into a tall cone. Nowadays, however, this type of construction is mostly reserved for barns, storage buildings, and gathering places for various traditional [[secret society|secret societies]]. Instead, modern Bamileke homes are made of bricks of either sun-dried mud or of concrete. Roofs are of metal sheeting.[[File:Fun\u00e9railles-Bamougong.jpg|thumb|Performers enacting a ''zing'', a funeral dance, at Bamougong with elephant mask|alt=Elephant Mask]]\n\n===Religious beliefs===\nDuring the colonial period, parts of the Bamileke adopted [[Christianity]]. Some of them practice [[Islam]] toward the border with the [[Adamawa Region, Cameroon|Adamawa]] Tikar and the Bamun. The Bamileke have worn elephant mask for dance ceremonies or funerals.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n== Royal Tradition and the Arts ==\nMasquerades are an integral part of Bamileke culture and expression. They are donned at special events such as funerals, important palace festivals and other royal ceremonies. The masks are performed by men and aim to support and enforce royal authority.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The visual arts of Africa : gender, power, and life cycle rituals|last=Perani|first=Judith|date=1998|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-442328-3|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|pages=215|oclc=605230100}}</ref>\n\nThe power of a Bamileke king, called a Fon, is often represented by the elephant, buffalo and leopard. Oral traditions proclaim that the Fon may transform into either an elephant or leopard whenever he chooses. An elephant mask, called a ''mbap mteng''is a mask with protruding circular ears, a human like face, decorative panels on the front and back that hang down to the knee and are covered overall in beautiful geometric beadwork including lots of triangle imagery. Isosceles triangles are prevalent as they are the known symbol of the leopard.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=African Beaded Art: Power and Adornment|last=Pemberton III|first=John|publisher=Smith College Museum of Art|year=2008|isbn=978-0-87391-058-3|location=Northampton, Massachusetts|pages=116\u2013117}}</ref> Beadwork, shells, bronze and other precious embellishments on masks elevate the mask's status.<ref name=\":1\" /> On occasion, a Fon may permit members of the community to perform an elephant mask along with a leopard skin, indicating a statement of wealth, status and power being associated with this masquerade.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBuffalo masks are also very popular and present at most functions throughout Grassland societies, including the Bamileke.

It is an art form that is highly personal in that no two pieces are alike and are often used in dazzling colors that catch the eye. They may be an indication of status based on what kinds of beads are used. Beadwork utilized all over on wooden sculptures is a technique that is unique only to the Cameroon grasslands.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|title=African Beaded Art: Power and Adornment|last=Pemberton III|first=John|publisher=Smith College Museum of Art|year=2008|isbn=978-0-87391-058-3|location=Northampton, Massachusetts|pages=5\u20137}}</ref>\n\nBefore they were colonized, popular beads were obtained from Sub-Saharan countries like Nigeria and were made of shells, nuts, wood, seeds, ceramic, ivory, animal bone and metal. Colonization and trade routes with other countries in Europe and the Middle East introduced brightly colored glass beads as well as pearls, coral and rare stones like emeralds. These came at a price, however. There were often agreements with these other countries to exchange these precious luxury commodities for slaves, gold, oil, ivory and some types of fine woods.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n===Succession and kinship patterns===\n[[File:TamTam.jpg|thumb|Bamileke [[Drums in communication|tamtam]]|alt=|left]]\nThe Bamileke trace ancestry, [[inheritance]] and succession through the male line, and children belong to the fondom of their father. After a man's death, all of his possessions typically go to a single, male heir. [[Polygamy]] (more specifically, [[polygyny]]) is practiced, and some important individuals may have literally hundreds of wives. Marriages typically involve a [[bride price]] to be paid to the bride's family.\n\nIt is argued that the Bamileke inheritance customs contributed to their success in the modern world:\n\n\"Succession and inheritance rules are determined by the principle of [[patrilineal]] descent. According to custom, the eldest son is the probable heir, but a father may choose any one of his sons to succeed him. An heir takes his dead father's name and inherits any titles held by the latter, including the right to membership in any societies to which he belonged. And, until the mid-1960s, when the law governing polygamy was changed, the heir also inherited his father's wives--a considerable economic responsibility. The rights in land held by the deceased were conferred upon the heir subject to the approval of the chief, and, in the event of financial inheritance, the heir was not obliged to share this with other family members. The ramifications of this are significant. First, dispossessed family members were not automatically entitled to live off the wealth of the heir. Siblings who did not share in the inheritance were, therefore, strongly encouraged to make it on their own through individual initiative and by assuming responsibility for earning their livelihood. Second, this practice of individual responsibility in contrast to a system of strong family obligations prevented a drain on individual financial resources. Rather than spend all of the inheritance maintaining unproductive family members, the heir could, in the contemporary period, utilize his resources in more financially productive ways such as for savings and investment. [...] Finally, the system of inheritance, along with the large-scale migration resulting from population density and land pressures, is one of the internal incentives that accounts for Bamileke success in the nontraditional world\".<ref>A.I.D. Evaluation Special Study No. 15  THE PRIVATE SECTOR: - Individual Initiative, And Economic Growth In An African Plural Society The Bamileke Of Cameroon http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pnaal016.pdf</ref>\n\n[[Donald L. Horowitz]] also attributes the economic success of the Bamileke to their inheritance customs, arguing that it encouraged younger sons to seek their own living abroad. He wrote in ''Ethnic groups in conflict'': \"Primogeniture among the Bamileke and matrilineal inheritance among the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] of Indonesia have contributed powerfully to the propensity of males from both groups to migrate out of their home region in search of opportunity\".<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/ethnicgroupsinco00horo | url-access=registration | page=[https://archive.org/details/ethnicgroupsinco00horo/page/155 155] |title = Ethnic Groups in Conflict| publisher=University of California Press |isbn = 9780520053854|last1 = Horowitz|first1 = Donald L.|last2 = Donald|first2 = Horowitz L.|last3 = Horowitz|first3 = Professor Donald L.|year = 1985}}</ref>\n\n==Notable Individuals==\nThe Bamileke people have enormously contributed to the development of Cameroon and the word in general.

The station is owned by the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]], as part of a [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] with Pensacola-licensed [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WEAR-TV]] (channel 3); Sinclair also operates Mobile-licensed [[NBC]] affiliate [[WPMI-TV]] (channel 15) and Pensacola-licensed [[independent station (North America)|independent station]] [[WJTC]] (channel 44) under a [[local marketing agreement]] (LMA) with owner [[Deerfield Media]].\n\nWFGX and WEAR share studios\u2014which also house [[master control]] and some internal operations for WPMI and WJTC\u2014on Mobile Highway ([[U.S. Route 90 in Florida|US 90]]) in [[Unincorporated area#United States|unincorporated]] [[Escambia County, Florida]] (with a Pensacola [[United States Postal Service|mailing]] address); WFGX and WEAR also share transmitter facilities in unincorporated [[Baldwin County, Alabama]] (east of Rosinton). On [[cable television|cable]], WFGX is available on [[Mediacom]] channel 7, [[Xfinity|Comcast Xfinity]] channel 19, and [[Cox Communications|Cox]] channel 20.\n\n==History==\nThe station signed on the air on [[1987 in television|April 7, 1987]] as an [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]]; it was the second independent station on the Florida side of the market, after Pensacola-based WJTC.\n\nIn 1995, WFGX's original local owners entered into a [[local marketing agreement]] (LMA) with [[Heritage Media]], then-owner of WEAR. This enabled WFGX to become the area's [[The WB|WB]] affiliate on September 29, 1996. The station's former [[analog television|analog]] signal on UHF channel 35 was very weak (509,000 [[watt]]s), resulting in marginal (at best) reception outside [[Okaloosa County, Florida|Okaloosa County]]. It was barely viewable even in Pensacola, and could not be seen at all over the air on the Alabama side of the market. Despite the shortfall in coverage, WFGX has long identified as \"Pensacola/Fort Walton Beach,\" which is unusual since the city of license is normally listed first when a station references another city in its legal on-air identification. It had to rely on cable carriage in order to reach the entire market.\n\nSinclair Broadcast Group took over WFGX's operations after Heritage sold its television division to Sinclair in 1997. When the stronger WBPG (channel 55, now [[WFNA (TV)|WFNA]]) signed on from [[Gulf Shores, Alabama]] on September 2, 2001, it replaced WFGX as the area's WB affiliate. WFGX then became an independent station, airing [[home shopping]] programming from [[Jewelry Television]], syndicated shows and [[infomercial]]s. Sinclair purchased WFGX outright in 2004.\n\nOn February 22, 2006, [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] announced that it would launch a new network called [[MyNetworkTV]], which would be operated by [[Fox Television Stations]] and its syndication division [[Twentieth Television]].<ref>{{cite news|title=News Corp. to launch new mini-network for UPN stations|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-02-22-fox-my-network_x.htm|accessdate=January 21, 2013|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=February 22, 2006}}</ref><ref>[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/102922-News_Corp_Unveils_My_Network_TV.php News Corp.

However, it was still practically unviewable on the Alabama side of the market. In July 2010, WFGX's digital transmitter was moved from [[Gulf Breeze, Florida]] to WEAR's tower east of Rosinton. With the same power output at the new location, it is now able to offer a signal comparable to those of the other full-powered stations in the market. Within two months, the station began offering a [[high-definition television|high definition]] signal over-the-air for the first time.\n\nWFGX runs some programming from Sinclair's [[Stadium (sports network)|Stadium]] network, mainly local sporting events that are part of the network's national schedule (it otherwise airs on WPMI-DT3).\n\n==Digital channels==\nThe station's digital signal is [[multiplex (TV)|multiplexed]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
