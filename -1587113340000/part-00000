And under the tutelage of key members helming certain responsibilities, the Brigade grew and spread out rapidly.\n\nThe Highlander Brigade host football-related events in the city. To ensure that the football culture remains proactive in the city, the brigade plans to indulge in more fan activities in the future as well.\n\nEven after a lackluster fourth season for the club, the Highlander Brigade could be seen cheering them on with the red-white-black flags and banners thumping down the beats in a raging winter cold under the lights. Therefore, they were received fondly by the club and the players.\n\nHighlander Brigade remains an excited bunch of people in a football crazy region and along with the other fan clubs of the country, they form a pivotal part of the umbrella of football culture as fans in India.\n=== Fan park ===\n \nNorthEast United organises its fan park in Sarusajai Stadium.

A major object is the one showing Sage Asita's visit to baby [[Gautama Buddha|Siddharta]] and the [[Bharhut]] railings that depicts the story related to the [[Relics associated with Buddha]] by the sage Drona.

Most prominent among the objects is the ''[[Standing Buddha]]'', made in Grey [[schist]] stone in Gandhara School of Arts and it belongs to the 2nd century CE. This period was the first time when Buddha was shown in physical form. The Mathura school of arts had primary themes of Buddhism, [[Jainism]] and [[Brahmanism]] while the Gandhara Arts were primarily of Buddhist themes.

S. Agarwala, Moti Chandra, Rai Krishnadas, Karl Khandalavala and their personal relationships with private collectors. Funding for mass collecting was granted by Parliament from 1947 but this first acquisition period is marked by lack of descriptive detail, quantifiable data, parameters surrounding the criteria of selection. O. C. Gangoly (1881-1974) sold a group from his collection of paintings to the National Museum in whose foundation he states he played a role. He further avers that he encouraged other fellow collectors to bequeath their collections to the National Museum but was not always successful.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=In pursuit of the past : collecting old art in modern India, circa 1875-1950|last=Pal, Pratapaditya|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=9789383243099|location=Mumbai|pages=50\u201353, 135|oclc=927320600}}</ref>  Collections of Burjor N. Treasurywalla (d. 1947) also resides in the National Museum, about which Gangoly says almost nothing except that it was large and important.

S. Agarwala was instrumental in securing extensive private collection of Ajit Ghose of Calcutta, Dickinson collection, Gulab Chand collection, Modi's collection and Medd's collection.\n\nIn recent years, according to a Standing Committee on Transport, Culture and Tourism query, the number of collections added to the National Museum was a total of 2269 objects during the period of 1994-2010. Out of this 1360 objects were purchased and remaining 906 objects were acquired through gifts etc. This small number was attributed to the Art Acquisition Committee of the National Museum being defunct since 1997.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ignca.gov.in/Asi_data/81453.pdf|title=One Hundred Sixty Seventh Report on the Functioning of National Museum|last=|first=|date=|website=www.google.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-03}}</ref>\n\n==Auditorium==\nBeside the galleries, the museum also has an auditorium with a seating capacity of 250 people. A brief film introducing the museum and its collections is screened in the auditorium regularly. Film shows on art, history and heritage are also screened.\n\n== Digitization of Museum Collections ==\n\nThe National Museum has started a special project to digitize its collection of objects in order to make it available for visitors to see online. This process involves digitization and storage of museum collections in a collection management system named \u2018JATAN\u2019. JATAN is a virtual museum builder software, that enables creation of digital collection management system for Indian museums and is deployed in several national museums across India. It\u2019s objective is to make a digital imprint of all the objects preserved in museums and help researchers, curators and other people interested in the field which has been designed and developed by [[Centre for Development of Smart Computing]] (C-DAC) Pune.\n\nThe digital imprints (of preserved objects and monuments) created using the JATAN software are integrated in the national digital repository and portal for making them accessible to the public. The National portal and digital repository for museums of India provides an integrated access to theme based collections and artefacts (in terms of sculptures, paintings, manuscripts, weapons, coins and numerous other categories of artefacts) irrespective of the physical and geographical locations of museums. Centre for Development of Smart Computing has also developed \u201cDarshak\u201d, a mobile-based application aimed at improving the museum visit experience among the differently-abled. It allows real-time museum visitors gather all details about objects or artefacts simply by scanning a QR code placed near the object.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.drishtiias.com/printpdf/jatan-virtual-museum-software|title=JATAN: Virtual Museum Software|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=23 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== National Museum Collections on the Google Art Project ===\nNational Museum has volunteered objects from its collection on the Google Art Project which is a non- commercial initiative of Google through the [[Google Arts & Culture|Google Cultural Institute]].

Various objects on display are a palanquin from the [[Santhal people|Santhal]] community, scroll paintings from West Bengal, textiles such as [[Phulkari|Phulkaris]] from [[Punjab]] and bronze sculptures from [[Bastar district|Bastar]], besides terracotta works and basketry. The gallery is a rich representation of art from various parts of India.<ref>[http://www.vancouverdesi.com/lifestyle/new-gallery-at-national-museum/713520/ New gallery at National Museum | Vancouverdesi.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.newstrackindia.com/newsdetails/2014/02/06/244--New-gallery-at-National-Museum-.html New gallery at National Museum<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n== Anubhav ==\nThe National Museum, in collaboration with UNESCO, National Platform for the Rights of the Disabled (NPRD) and Saksham, launched a new permanent gallery for Persons with Disabilities in the year 2015 which features tactile replicas of 22 objects from the collections of the Museum as well as an audio guide, ramps and descriptive labels in Braille; the gallery encourages visitors to 'touch' and feel the objects on display. 'Anubhav: A Tactile Experience' ensures a conducive space and exposure to the objects for the differently-abled. The Gallery was conceived and developed by Rige Shiba, Assistant Curator under the overall guidance of Dr. Vijay Kumar Mathir, Curator with assistance from Vasundhra Sangwan. The Replicas exhibited in the space have been made by the National Museum Modeling department headed by Hemant Tomar and his colleagues and the gallery has been designed by Amardeep Labana,<ref name=\":6\" />with a special emphasis on dimensions. For instance, one can have a sensory experience of a mid-19th century coin from the Awadh region which has been recreated in 23-inch diameter and 2-inch thickness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/at-national-museum-exhibition-for-those-who-cant-see/|title=At National Museum, exhibition for those who can't see|date=2015-12-26|website=The Indian Express|language=en-IN|access-date=2019-10-28}}</ref>\n\n== Governance ==\nOn the basis of nature of grants and exercise of control, the National Museum comes within the purview of Central Government of India.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Modern museum : organisation and practice in India|last=Baxi, Smita J. Dwivedi, Vinod P.|date=1973|publisher=Abhinav|oclc=471579325}}</ref> It was initially looked after by the Director General of Archaeology until 1957, when the Ministry of Education, Government of India, declared it a separate institution and placed it under its own direct control, following this shift the museum began to significantly increase both its staff and its collections using funds from the Art Purchase Committee.<ref name=\":0\" /> At present, the National Museum is under the administrative control of the Ministry of Culture, Government of India.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalmuseumindia.gov.in/about-history.asp?lk=ab1|title=National Museum|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=23 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Donors ==\nThe first wave of collecting for the National Museum started in 1948 and which lasted around 1952, drawing heavily on scholars like V. S. Agarwala, Moti Chandra, Rai Krishnadas, Karl Khandalavala and their personal relationships with private collectors. Funding for mass collecting was granted by Parliament from 1947 but this first acquisition period is marked by lack of descriptive detail, quantifiable data, parameters surrounding the criteria of selection. O. C. Gangoly (1881-1974) sold a group from his collection of paintings to the National Museum in whose foundation he states he played a role. He further avers that he encouraged other fellow collectors to bequeath their collections to the National Museum but was not always successful.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=In pursuit of the past : collecting old art in modern India, circa 1875-1950|last=Pal, Pratapaditya|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=9789383243099|location=Mumbai|pages=50\u201353, 135|oclc=927320600}}</ref>  Collections of Burjor N. Treasurywalla (d. 1947) also resides in the National Museum, about which Gangoly says almost nothing except that it was large and important. He does emphasize how he was involved in the purchasing of the collection itself except that it was likely that Khandalavala, a relative of Treasurywallla, played a greater role.<ref name=\":4\" /> V. S. Agarwala was instrumental in securing extensive private collection of Ajit Ghose of Calcutta, Dickinson collection, Gulab Chand collection, Modi's collection and Medd's collection.\n\nIn recent years, according to a Standing Committee on Transport, Culture and Tourism query, the number of collections added to the National Museum was a total of 2269 objects during the period of 1994-2010. Out of this 1360 objects were purchased and remaining 906 objects were acquired through gifts etc. This small number was attributed to the Art Acquisition Committee of the National Museum being defunct since 1997.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ignca.gov.in/Asi_data/81453.pdf|title=One Hundred Sixty Seventh Report on the Functioning of National Museum|last=|first=|date=|website=www.google.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-03}}</ref>\n\n==Auditorium==\nBeside the galleries, the museum also has an auditorium with a seating capacity of 250 people. A brief film introducing the museum and its collections is screened in the auditorium regularly. Film shows on art, history and heritage are also screened.\n\n== Digitization of Museum Collections ==\n\nThe National Museum has started a special project to digitize its collection of objects in order to make it available for visitors to see online. This process involves digitization and storage of museum collections in a collection management system named \u2018JATAN\u2019. JATAN is a virtual museum builder software, that enables creation of digital collection management system for Indian museums and is deployed in several national museums across India. It\u2019s objective is to make a digital imprint of all the objects preserved in museums and help researchers, curators and other people interested in the field which has been designed and developed by [[Centre for Development of Smart Computing]] (C-DAC) Pune.\n\nThe digital imprints (of preserved objects and monuments) created using the JATAN software are integrated in the national digital repository and portal for making them accessible to the public. The National portal and digital repository for museums of India provides an integrated access to theme based collections and artefacts (in terms of sculptures, paintings, manuscripts, weapons, coins and numerous other categories of artefacts) irrespective of the physical and geographical locations of museums. Centre for Development of Smart Computing has also developed \u201cDarshak\u201d, a mobile-based application aimed at improving the museum visit experience among the differently-abled. It allows real-time museum visitors gather all details about objects or artefacts simply by scanning a QR code placed near the object.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.drishtiias.com/printpdf/jatan-virtual-museum-software|title=JATAN: Virtual Museum Software|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=23 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== National Museum Collections on the Google Art Project ===\nNational Museum has volunteered objects from its collection on the Google Art Project which is a non- commercial initiative of Google through the [[Google Arts & Culture|Google Cultural Institute]]. More than hundred objects have been photographed and their descriptions are available on the Google Art Project website under the name of National Museum, New Delhi which has given a high reach to online visitors for the collection. The Google page of National Museum will be populated further by adding other pertinent collections from National Museum on it.<ref name=\":6\">National Museum- Bulletin No.11</ref>\n\n== Controversy ==\nIn 2010, in the first study of its kind, UNESCO presented a report<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/exhibit-a-shame/266776|title=Exhibit 'A': Shame|last=Gahilote|first=Prarthna|date=|work=|access-date=23 October 2019}}</ref> which rated the National Museum along with other seven museums, as badly maintained, poorly lit and having incorrect signs.
