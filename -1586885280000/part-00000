The incidents (the cross-burning and the arrest) were discussed in the meeting. Student leaders called for the withdrawal of student support of the bus company and for students to seek participation in the boycott throughout the community. Reverend Steele, a member of the Tallahassee Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance (IMA) and leader in the NAACP, organized a mass meeting that night. In the meeting, the Inter-Civic Council (ICC) was born from the joining of the NAACP, IMA, and Tallahassee Civic League. The ICC was formed in response to community fear that a NAACP-led protest would be met with state repression. Its leaders held weekly meetings and the Council was highly active in Civil Rights-related activism. The NAACP became involved well after the boycott had been started, when leaders sent a lawyer to defend drivers of boycotters (carpool drivers) who were arrested for driving unlicensed \"for hire\" vehicles.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThree months into the boycott, the demand for the employment of black bus drivers was met. For months after ''Browder v. Gayle'', the government upheld ''de facto'' segregation, with the instantiation of an ordinance mandating assigned seats on buses. That led to arrests of blacks who did not sit in the seats assigned to them. Efforts persisted in resisting bus segregation and enforcement of the ordinance became less strict, when blacks again rode the buses.\n\nIn 1959, members of the Tallahassee [[Congress of Racial Equality]] tested the success of the boycott by riding the newly-integrated buses; they found that the integration was successful.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSociologist Lewis Killian points out that organizational and community leaders did not gather until after the initiation of the boycott, which highlights the spontaneity of the student-initiated boycott. Furthermore, the boycott was initiated during a time in which Tallahassee's civil rights-related organizational activity was markedly low and the black community in Tallahassee was unprepared for a protest as large as the boycott.\n\nThe creation of the ICC provides an example of the emergence of new norms and structures. Although it is widely believed that the centers of Civil Rights Movement activity were organizational and structural bodies such as the black church and the NAACP, a new normative structure emerged in the Tallahassee Bus Boycott.\n\nThe boycott presents an overlooked departure from the circumstances of the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]], which was planned and precipitated by active individuals and organizations; in addition, the Tallahassee boycott, at least in its initial stages, was separate from and did not model the latter.\n\nKillian finds the formation of the ICC and the spontaneous and irregular nature of the boycott's initiation commensurate with traditional [[collective behavior]] theory, which includes such superficially irrational elements as spontaneity.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=Social Psychology|last=Rohall|first=David E.|last2=Milkie|first2=Melissa A.|last3=Lucas|first3=Jeffrey W.|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=298-299|chapter=11.

Ortega and other party insiders found common ground with the radicals, who still promoted anti-imperialism and class conflict to achieve social change.<ref name=\"FSLNPostCollapse\" />\n\nPossible explanations for his loss include that the Nicaraguan people were disenchanted with the Ortega government as well as the fact that already in November 1989, the White House had announced that the economic embargo against Nicaragua would continue unless [[Violeta Chamorro]] won.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130117074255/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1222025.html \"Bush Vows to End Embargo if Chamorro Wins\"], ''The Washington Post,'' November 9, 1989</ref> Also, there had been reports of intimidation from the side of the contras,<ref>{{cite report|publisher=Human Rights Watch|title=Human Rights Watch World Report 1989|chapter=Nicaragua|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1989/WR89/index.htm|date=1990|access-date=9 March 2016|chapter-url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1989/WR89/Nicaragu.htm|quote=The policy of keeping the contras alive ... also has placed in jeopardy the holding of elections by encouraging contra attacks on the electoral process.

The effort failed to unite the party, and intense debates over the internal governance of the FSLN continued. The pragmatists, led by the former vice president [[Sergio Ram\u00edrez|Sergio Ramirez]], formed the basis of a \"renovating\" faction, and supported collaboration with other political forces to preserve the rule of law in Nicaragua.

In these elections, a key issue was the allegation of corruption. In Ortega's last days as president, through a series of legislative acts known as \"The [[Pi\u00f1ata]]\", estates that had been seized by the Sandinista government (some valued at millions and even billions of US dollars) became the private property of various FSLN officials, including Ortega himself.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Shirley Christian |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/08/world/managua-journal-victor-s-lament-to-the-losers-belong-the-spoils.html |title=Managua Journal; Victor's Lament: To the Losers Belong the Spoils \u2013 New York Times |location=Nicaragua |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= 1991-06-08|accessdate=2014-08-18|newspaper=The New York Times }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1996 campaign, Ortega faced the Liberal Alliance (Alianza Liberal), headed by [[Arnoldo Alem\u00e1n|Arnoldo Aleman Lacayo]], a former mayor of Managua.

The controversial alliance of Nicaragua's two major parties is aimed at distributing power between the PLC and FSLN, and preventing other parties from rising. After sealing the agreement in January 2000, the two parties controlled the three key institutions of the state: the Comptroller General of the Republic, the [[Supreme Court of Justice (Nicaragua)|Supreme Court]], and the Supreme Electoral Council.<ref name=\"FSLNAdaptation\"/> ''\"El Pacto,\"'' as it is known in Nicaragua, is said to have personally benefited former presidents Ortega and Alem\u00e1n greatly, while constraining then-president Bola\u00f1os.

Once the main collective leadership body of the party, with nine members, the DN no longer met routinely, and only three historic members remained. Instead, the body just supported decisions already made by the secretary-general.

Ortega abandoned the revolutionary tone of the past, and infused his campaign with religious imagery. In speeches, he gave thanks to \u201cGod and the Revolution\u201d for the post-1990 democracy, and claimed a Sandinista victory would enable the Nicaraguan people to \u201cpass through the sea and reach the Promised Land.\u201d{{sfn|Baltodano|2012|pp=76-7}}  The U.S. opposed Ortega's candidacy from the beginning.

The split in the Constitutionalist Liberal Party helped allow the FSLN to become the largest party in Congress; however, the Sandinista vote had a minuscule split between the FSLN and MRS, and that the liberal party combined is larger than the Frente Faction. In 2010, several liberal congressmen raised accusations about the FSLN presumably attempting to buy votes to pass constitutional reforms that would allow Ortega to run for office for the 6th time since 1984.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.laprensa.com.ni/2010/06/15/politica/27852|title=Ofertas de \"ca\u00f1onazos\" en US$500 mil|last=Uriarte|first=Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9|date=15 June 2010|work=La Prensa|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019083239/http://www.laprensa.com.ni/2010/06/15/politica/27852|archive-date=19 October 2013|language=Spanish|trans-title=Offers of canonization for US$500 million}}</ref>\n\n==Second presidency (2007\u2013present)==\n{{Main|2011 Nicaraguan general election||Nicaraguan general election, 2016}}\n{{Infobox President styles\n| image    = [[File:Coat of arms of Nicaragua.svg|75px]]\n| name     = Daniel Ortega\n| dipstyle = ''Daniel Ortega, Presidente de la Rep\u00fablica de Nicaragua'' Daniel Ortega, President of the Republic of Nicaragua\n| offstyle = ''Presidente Ortega'' President Ortega\n| altstyle = ''Se\u00f1or Presidente'' Mister President\n}}\nSoon after his inauguration, Ortega paid an official visit to Iran and met [[Iranian President]] [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]].

The seven parties participating in the elections represented a broad spectrum of political ideologies.\" The general counsel of New York's [[Human Rights Commission]] described the election as \"free, fair and hotly contested.\" A study by the US [[Latin American Studies Association]] (LASA) concluded that the FSLN (Sandinista Front) \"did little more to take advantage of its incumbency than incumbent parties everywhere (including the U.S.) routinely do.\" However some people described the election as \"rigged\". According to a detailed study, since the 1984 election was for posts subordinate to the Sandinista Directorate, the elections were no more subject to approval by vote than the Central Committee of the Communist Party is in countries of the East Bloc.<ref>Martin Kriele, \u201cPower and Human Rights in Nicaragua,\u201d German Comments, April 1986, pp. 56\u20137, 63\u20137, a chapter excerpted from his Nicaragua: Das blutende Herz Amerikas (Piper, 1986).

Chamorro was supported by the US and a 14-party anti-Sandinista alliance known as the [[National Opposition Union]] (Uni\u00f3n Nacional Oppositora, UNO), an alliance that ranged from conservatives and liberals to communists.

In Ortega's concession speech the following day he vowed to keep \"ruling from below\" a reference to the power that the FSLN still wielded in various sectors. He also stressed his belief that the Sandinistas had the goal of bringing \"dignity\" to Latin America, and not necessarily to hold on to government posts. In 1991, Ortega claimed elections were \u201can instrument to reaffirm\u201d the FSLN's \u201cpolitical and ideological positions,\u201d and also \u201cconfront capitalism.\u201d{{sfn|Baltodano|2012|p=70}} However, the electoral loss led to pronounced divisions in the FSLN. Some members adopted more pragmatic positions, and sought to transform the FSLN into a modern social democratic party engaged in national reconciliation and class cooperation. Ortega and other party insiders found common ground with the radicals, who still promoted anti-imperialism and class conflict to achieve social change.<ref name=\"FSLNPostCollapse\" />\n\nPossible explanations for his loss include that the Nicaraguan people were disenchanted with the Ortega government as well as the fact that already in November 1989, the White House had announced that the economic embargo against Nicaragua would continue unless [[Violeta Chamorro]] won.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130117074255/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1222025.html \"Bush Vows to End Embargo if Chamorro Wins\"], ''The Washington Post,'' November 9, 1989</ref> Also, there had been reports of intimidation from the side of the contras,<ref>{{cite report|publisher=Human Rights Watch|title=Human Rights Watch World Report 1989|chapter=Nicaragua|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1989/WR89/index.htm|date=1990|access-date=9 March 2016|chapter-url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1989/WR89/Nicaragu.htm|quote=The policy of keeping the contras alive ... also has placed in jeopardy the holding of elections by encouraging contra attacks on the electoral process.

In these elections, a key issue was the allegation of corruption. In Ortega's last days as president, through a series of legislative acts known as \"The [[Pi\u00f1ata]]\", estates that had been seized by the Sandinista government (some valued at millions and even billions of US dollars) became the private property of various FSLN officials, including Ortega himself.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Shirley Christian |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/08/world/managua-journal-victor-s-lament-to-the-losers-belong-the-spoils.html |title=Managua Journal; Victor's Lament: To the Losers Belong the Spoils \u2013 New York Times |location=Nicaragua |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= 1991-06-08|accessdate=2014-08-18|newspaper=The New York Times }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1996 campaign, Ortega faced the Liberal Alliance (Alianza Liberal), headed by [[Arnoldo Alem\u00e1n|Arnoldo Aleman Lacayo]], a former mayor of Managua.

The controversial alliance of Nicaragua's two major parties is aimed at distributing power between the PLC and FSLN, and preventing other parties from rising. After sealing the agreement in January 2000, the two parties controlled the three key institutions of the state: the Comptroller General of the Republic, the [[Supreme Court of Justice (Nicaragua)|Supreme Court]], and the Supreme Electoral Council.<ref name=\"FSLNAdaptation\"/> ''\"El Pacto,\"'' as it is known in Nicaragua, is said to have personally benefited former presidents Ortega and Alem\u00e1n greatly, while constraining then-president Bola\u00f1os.

Once the main collective leadership body of the party, with nine members, the DN no longer met routinely, and only three historic members remained.

In 2015, the Bloc rebounded to take three more ridings, while the Liberals regained Saint-Maurice\u2014Champlain.\n\n==2015 \u2013 42nd General Election==\n{{Canadian federal election, 2015/qc-c}}\n\n==2011 \u2013 41st General Election==\n{{Canadian federal election, 2011/qc-c}}\n\n==2008 \u2013 40th General Election==\n{{Canadian federal election, 2008/qc-c}}\n\n==2006 \u2013 39th General Election==\n{{Canadian federal election, 2006/qc-c}}\n\n==2004 \u2013 38th General Election==\n{{Canadian federal election, 2004/qc-c}}\n=== Maps ===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n#Berthier-Maskinong\u00e9\n#Joliette\n#Lotbini\u00e8re-Chutes-de-la-Chaudi\u00e8re\n#Montcalm\n#Portneuf\n#Repentigny\n#Richelieu\n#Saint-Maurice-Champlain\n#Trois-Rivi\u00e8res\n{{col-break}}\n<gallery widths=185 heights=185>\nImage:cq04.PNG|Key map\nImage:cqbq.PNG|Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois\nImage:cqcpc.PNG|Conservative Party of Canada\nImage:cqgpc.PNG|Green Party of Canada\nImage:cqlpc.PNG|Liberal Party of Canada\nImage:cqndp.PNG|New Democratic Party\n</gallery>\n{{col-end}}\n\n==2000 \u2013 37th General Election==\n{{Canadian federal election, 2000/qc-c}}\n\n== 1997 \u2013 36th General Election ==\n{{Canadian politics/candlist header|province=CA|BQ|Liberal|PC|NDP|Other}}\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:whitesmoke\" |[[B\u00e9cancour\u2014Nicolet\u2014Saurel|Richelieu]]\n|{{Canadian party colour|CA|BQ|background}}|\n|[[Louis Plamondon]]<br>26,421\n|\n|Jocelyn Paul<br>13,941\n|\n|Yves Schelling<br>6,827\n|\n|Sylvain Pelletier<br>1,028\n|\n|\n|{{Canadian party colour|CA|BQ|background}}|\n|[[Louis Plamondon]]\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:whitesmoke\" |[[Berthier&#8212;Montcalm]]\n|{{Canadian party colour|CA|BQ|background}}|\n|[[Michel Bellehumeur]]<br>32,707\n|\n|Lise Perreault<br>15,073\n|\n|R\u00e9al Naud<br>13,338\n|\n|Jean-Pierre de Billy<br>1,009\n|\n|\n|{{Canadian party colour|CA|BQ|background}}|\n|[[Michel Bellehumeur]]\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:whitesmoke\" |[[Champlain (electoral district)|Champlain]]\n|{{Canadian party colour|CA|BQ|background}}|\n|[[R\u00e9jean Lefebvre]]<br>20,687\n|\n|Pierre Lesieur<br>12,915\n|\n|Yves St-Amant<br>12,784\n|\n|Petra Genest<br>632\n|\n|\n|{{Canadian party colour|CA|BQ|background}}|\n|[[R\u00e9jean Lefebvre]]\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:whitesmoke\" |[[Joliette (electoral district)|Joliette]]\n|{{Canadian party colour|CA|BQ|background}}|\n|[[Ren\u00e9 Laurin]]<br>22,605\n|\n|Denise Cloutier Bergeron<br>7,452\n|\n|Anie Perrault<br>17,417\n|\n|Jacques Trudeau<br>502\n|\n|Gilles Roy (NL)<br> 594\n|{{Canadian party colour|CA|BQ|background}}|\n|[[Ren\u00e9 Laurin]]\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:whitesmoke\" |[[Lotbini\u00e8re\u2014L'\u00c9rable]]\n|{{Canadian party colour|CA|BQ|background}}|\n|[[Odina Desrochers]]<br>13,069\n|\n|Pierre Savoie<br>10,062\n|\n|Gaston Beaudet<br>9,690\n|\n|Dominique Vaillancourt<br>445\n|\n|[[Jean Landry (Canadian politician)|Jean Landry]] (Ind) <br>1,988\n|{{Canadian party colour|CA|BQ|background}}|\n|[[Jean Landry (Canadian politician)|Jean Landry]]\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:whitesmoke\" |[[Portneuf (electoral district)|Portneuf]]\n\n|{{Canadian party colour|CA|BQ|background}}|\n|[[Pierre de Savoye]]<br>18,615\n|\n|Raynald Samson<br>12,674\n|\n|Raymond McBain<br>10,587\n|\n|Majella Desmeules<br>1,112\n|\n|\n|{{Canadian party colour|CA|BQ|background}}|\n|[[Pierre de Savoye]]\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:whitesmoke\" |[[Repentigny (electoral district)|Repentigny]]\n|{{Canadian party colour|CA|BQ|background}}|\n|[[Beno\u00eet Sauvageau]]<br>33,283\n|\n|Robert Tranchemontagne<br>12,495\n|\n|Michel Carignan<br>12,436\n|\n|Normand Caplette<br>916\n|\n|\n|&nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=2 |''new district''\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:whitesmoke\" |[[Saint-Maurice (electoral district)|Saint-Maurice]]\n|\n|Yves Duhaime<br>20,664\n|{{Canadian party colour|CA|Liberal|background}}|\n|'''[[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]]'''<br>22,266\n|\n|Denis Vincent<br>3,657\n|\n|Eric H\u00e9bert<br>489\n|\n|\n|{{Canadian party colour|CA|Liberal|background}}|\n|'''Jean Chr\u00e9tien'''\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:whitesmoke\" |[[Trois-Rivi\u00e8res (electoral district)|Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]]\n|{{Canadian party colour|CA|BQ|background}}|\n|[[Yves Rocheleau]]<br>21,267\n|\n|Jean-Guy Doucet<br>15,692\n|\n|Michel Charland<br>12,102\n|\n|Dorothy H\u00e9naut<br>528\n|\n|Roger P\u00e9rigny (NL)<br> 503\n|{{Canadian party colour|CA|BQ|background}}|\n|Yves Rocheleau\n|}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n{{Canada macroriding}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Canadian Federal Election Results In Central Quebec}}\n[[Category:Canadian federal election results in Quebec]]\n", "name_user": "Amrcmln", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e1997 \u2013 36th General Election", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_federal_election_results_in_Central_Quebec"}

Every edge is related to itself, and an edge ''e'' is related to another edge ''f'' if and only if ''f'' is related in the same way to ''e''. Less obviously, this is a [[transitive relation]]: if there exists a simple cycle containing edges ''e'' and ''f'', and another simple cycle containing edges ''f'' and ''g'', then one can combine these two cycles to find a simple cycle through ''e'' and ''g''. Therefore, this is an [[equivalence relation]], and it can be used to partition the edges into equivalence classes, subsets of edges with the property that two edges are related to each other if and only if they belong to the same equivalence class. The subgraphs formed by the edges in each equivalence class are the biconnected components of the given graph. Thus, the biconnected components partition the edges of the graph; however, they may share vertices with each other.<ref>{{harvtxt|Tarjan|Vishkin|1985}} credit the definition of this equivalence relation to {{harvtxt|Harary|1969}}; however, Harary does not appear to describe it in explicit terms.</ref>\n\n===Block graph===\nThe '''block graph''' of a given graph ''G'' is the [[intersection graph]] of its blocks. Thus, it has one vertex for each block of ''G'', and an edge between two vertices whenever the corresponding two blocks share a vertex.\nA graph ''H'' is the block graph of another graph ''G'' exactly when all the blocks of ''H'' are complete subgraphs. The graphs ''H'' with this property are known as the [[block graph]]s.<ref>{{citation|first=Frank|last=Harary|authorlink=Frank Harary|title=Graph Theory|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1969|page=29}}.</ref>\n\n===Block-cut tree===\nA '''cutpoint''', '''cut vertex''', or '''articulation point''' of a graph ''G'' is a vertex that is shared by two or more blocks. The structure of the blocks and cutpoints of a connected graph can be described by a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]] called the '''block-cut tree''' or '''BC-tree'''. This tree has a vertex for each block and for each articulation point of the given graph. There is an edge in the block-cut tree for each pair of a block and an articulation point that belongs to that block.<ref>{{harvtxt|Harary|1969}}, p.&nbsp;36.</ref>\n[[File:Block-cut tree2.svg|800px|thumb|none|A graph, and its block-cut tree.<br/>The blocks are: b<sub>1</sub>=[1,2], b<sub>2</sub>=[2,3,4], b<sub>3</sub>=[2,5,6,7], b<sub>4</sub>=[7,8,9,10,11], b<sub>5</sub>=[8,12,13,14,15], b<sub>6</sub>=[10,16] and b<sub>7</sub>=[10,17,18];<br/>cutpoints are: c<sub>1</sub>=2, c<sub>2</sub>=7, c<sub>3</sub>=8 and c<sub>4</sub>=10.]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Triconnected component]]\n*[[Bridge (graph theory)]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references/>\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite journal\n | author = Eugene C.

Less obviously, this is a [[transitive relation]]: if there exists a simple cycle containing edges ''e'' and ''f'', and another simple cycle containing edges ''f'' and ''g'', then one can combine these two cycles to find a simple cycle through ''e'' and ''g''. Therefore, this is an [[equivalence relation]], and it can be used to partition the edges into equivalence classes, subsets of edges with the property that two edges are related to each other if and only if they belong to the same equivalence class. The subgraphs formed by the edges in each equivalence class are the biconnected components of the given graph. Thus, the biconnected components partition the edges of the graph; however, they may share vertices with each other.<ref>{{harvtxt|Tarjan|Vishkin|1985}} credit the definition of this equivalence relation to {{harvtxt|Harary|1969}}; however, Harary does not appear to describe it in explicit terms.</ref>\n\n===Block graph===\nThe '''block graph''' of a given graph ''G'' is the [[intersection graph]] of its blocks. Thus, it has one vertex for each block of ''G'', and an edge between two vertices whenever the corresponding two blocks share a vertex.\nA graph ''H'' is the block graph of another graph ''G'' exactly when all the blocks of ''H'' are complete subgraphs. The graphs ''H'' with this property are known as the [[block graph]]s.<ref>{{citation|first=Frank|last=Harary|authorlink=Frank Harary|title=Graph Theory|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1969|page=29}}.</ref>\n\n===Block-cut tree===\nA '''cutpoint''', '''cut vertex''', or '''articulation point''' of a graph ''G'' is a vertex that is shared by two or more blocks. The structure of the blocks and cutpoints of a connected graph can be described by a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]] called the '''block-cut tree''' or '''BC-tree'''. This tree has a vertex for each block and for each articulation point of the given graph. There is an edge in the block-cut tree for each pair of a block and an articulation point that belongs to that block.<ref>{{harvtxt|Harary|1969}}, p.&nbsp;36.</ref>\n[[File:Block-cut tree2.svg|800px|thumb|none|A graph, and its block-cut tree.<br/>The blocks are: b<sub>1</sub>=[1,2], b<sub>2</sub>=[2,3,4], b<sub>3</sub>=[2,5,6,7], b<sub>4</sub>=[7,8,9,10,11], b<sub>5</sub>=[8,12,13,14,15], b<sub>6</sub>=[10,16] and b<sub>7</sub>=[10,17,18];<br/>cutpoints are: c<sub>1</sub>=2, c<sub>2</sub>=7, c<sub>3</sub>=8 and c<sub>4</sub>=10.]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Triconnected component]]\n*[[Bridge (graph theory)]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references/>\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite journal\n | author = Eugene C.

The G&S Project [[WP:G&S]] uses this term for all of their works.--> The most famous of these include ''[[H.M.S.

These [[Savoy opera]]s are still frequently performed in the English-speaking world and beyond.<ref>Bradley, Chapter 1 and ''passim''.</ref>\n\nGilbert's creative output included over 75 plays and [[libretto|libretti]], and numerous short stories, poems and lyrics, both comic and serious. After brief careers as a government clerk and a lawyer, Gilbert began to focus, in the 1860s, on writing light verse, including his ''[[Bab Ballads]]'', short stories, theatre reviews and illustrations, often for ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'' magazine. He also began to write [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] and his first comic plays, developing a unique absurdist, inverted style that would later be known as his \"topsy-turvy\" style. He also developed a [[realism (arts)|realistic]] method of stage direction and a reputation as a strict theatre director. In the 1870s, Gilbert wrote 40 plays and libretti, including his [[German Reed Entertainments]], several blank-verse \"fairy comedies\", some serious plays, and his first five collaborations with Sullivan: ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'', ''[[Trial by Jury]]'', ''[[The Sorcerer]]'', ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' and ''The Pirates of Penzance''. In the 1880s, Gilbert focused on the Savoy operas, including ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'', ''[[Iolanthe]]'', ''The Mikado'', ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' and ''[[The Gondoliers]]''.\n\nIn 1890, after this long and profitable creative partnership, Gilbert quarrelled with Sullivan and Carte concerning expenses at the Savoy Theatre; the dispute is referred to as the \"carpet quarrel\". Gilbert won the ensuing lawsuit, but the argument caused hurt feelings among the partnership. Although Gilbert and Sullivan were persuaded to collaborate on two last operas, they were not as successful as the previous ones. In later years, Gilbert wrote several plays, and a few operas with other collaborators. He retired, with his wife Lucy, and their ward, [[Nancy McIntosh]], to a country estate, [[Grim's Dyke]]. He was [[Knight bachelor|knight]]ed in 1907. Gilbert died of a heart attack while attempting to rescue a young woman to whom he was giving a swimming lesson in the lake at his home.\n\nGilbert's plays inspired other dramatists, including [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]],<ref>Feingold, Michael, [http://www.villagevoice.com/arts/engaging-the-past-7140486 \"Engaging the Past\"], ''The Village Voice'', 4 May 2004</ref> and his comic operas with Sullivan inspired the later development of American [[musical theatre]], especially influencing Broadway librettists and lyricists. According to ''[[The Cambridge History of English and American Literature]]'', Gilbert's \"lyrical facility and his mastery of metre raised the poetical quality of comic opera to a position that it had never reached before and has not reached since\".<ref name=CambridgeHistory>[http://www.bartelby.net/223/0815.html ''The Cambridge History of English and American Literature''], Volume XIII, Chapter VIII, Section 15 (1907\u201321)</ref>\n\n__TOC__ <!--These two lines prevent the layout from breaking if the ToC is closed -->\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Early life and career==\n\n===Beginnings===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|style=\"text-align: left;\" |''\"No sooner had the learned judge pronounced this sentence than the poor soul stooped down, and taking off a heavy boot, flung it at my head, as a reward for my eloquence on her behalf; accompanying the assault with a torrent of invective against my abilities as a counsel, and my line of defence.\"''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left;\" |\u2014 '''''My Maiden Brief'''''<ref name=MMB>Gilbert, W.

Together, these plays and their successors such as ''[[The Wicked World]]'' (1873), ''[[Sweethearts (play)|Sweethearts]]'' (1874), and ''[[Broken Hearts]]'' (1875), did for Gilbert on the dramatic stage what the German Reed entertainments had done for him on the musical stage: they established that his capabilities extended far beyond burlesque, won him artistic credentials, and demonstrated that he was a writer of wide range, as comfortable with human drama as with farcical humour. The success of these plays, especially ''Pygmalion and Galatea'', gave Gilbert a prestige that would be crucial to his later collaboration with as respected a musician as Sullivan.<ref name=Wren>Wren, p. 13.</ref>\n\nDuring this period, Gilbert also pushed the boundaries of how far satire could go in the theatre. He collaborated with [[Gilbert Arthur \u00e0 Beckett]] on ''[[The Happy Land]]'' (1873), a political satire (in part, a parody of his own ''The Wicked World''), which was briefly banned because of its unflattering caricatures of [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] and his ministers.<ref>Rees, Terence. \"''The Happy Land'': its true and remarkable history\" in ''W.

''Thespis'' outran five of its nine competitors for the 1871 holiday season, and its run was extended beyond the length of a normal run at the Gaiety,<ref>Walters, Michael.  \"Thespis: a reply\",  ''W. S. Gilbert Society Journal'', Vol. 4, part 3, Issue 29.  Summer 2011.</ref> However, nothing more came of it at that point, and Gilbert and Sullivan went their separate ways. Gilbert worked again with Clay on ''[[Happy Arcadia]]'' (1872), and with [[Alfred Cellier]] on ''[[Topsyturveydom]]'' (1874), as well as writing several farces, operetta libretti, [[extravaganza]]s, fairy comedies, adaptations from novels, translations from the French, and the dramas described above. Also in 1874, he published his last contribution for ''Fun'' magazine (''\"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern\"''), after a gap of three years, then resigned due to disapproval of the new owner's other publishing interests.<ref>Jones, John Bush, \"W. S. Gilbert's Contributions to Fun, 1865\u20131874\", published in the ''Bulletin of the New York Public Library'', vol 73 (April 1969), pp. 253\u201366</ref>\n\n[[File:Thespis - Illustrated London News Jan 6 1872.png|thumb|left|Illustration of ''Thespis'' in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', 6 January 1872]]\nIt would be nearly four years after ''Thespis'' was produced before the two men worked together again. In 1868, Gilbert had published a short comic sketch in ''Fun'' magazine titled \"Trial by Jury: An Operetta\". In 1873, Gilbert was asked by the theatrical manager, [[Carl Rosa]], to write a work for his planned 1874 season. Gilbert expanded ''Trial'' into a one-act libretto. However, Rosa's wife [[Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa]], a childhood friend of Gilbert's, died after an illness in 1874 and Rosa dropped the project.<ref>Stedman, p. 121</ref> Later in 1874 Gilbert offered the libretto to [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], but Carte could not use the piece at that time. By early 1875, Carte was managing the [[Royalty Theatre]], and he needed a short opera to play as an afterpiece to [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]]'s ''[[La P\u00e9richole]]''. He contacted Gilbert, asked about the piece, and suggested Sullivan to set the work. Sullivan was enthusiastic, and ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' was composed in a matter of weeks. The little piece was a runaway hit, outlasting the run of ''La P\u00e9richole'' and being revived at another theatre.<ref>Walbrook, H. M. (1922), [http://gsarchive.net/books/walbrook/chap3.html ''Gilbert and Sullivan Opera, a History and Comment'' (Chapter 3)].</ref>{{refn|Richard Traubner quotes Sullivan's recollection of Gilbert reading the libretto of ''Trial by Jury'' to him: \"As soon as he had come to the last word he closed up the manuscript violently, apparently unconscious of the fact that he had achieved his purpose so far as I was concerned, in as much as I was screaming with laughter the whole time.\"<ref>Traubner, Richard.

Gilbert's burlesque comedy, Engaged.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Engaged (play)|Engaged]]'' (1877), is still produced.]]\nGilbert continued his quest to gain respect in and respectability for his profession. One thing that may have been holding dramatists back from respectability was that plays were not published in a form suitable for a \"gentleman's library\", as, at the time, they were generally cheaply and unattractively published for the use of actors rather than the home reader. To help rectify this, at least for himself, Gilbert arranged in late 1875 for publishers Chatto and Windus to print a volume of his plays in a format designed to appeal to the general reader, with an attractive binding and clear type, containing Gilbert's most respectable plays, including his most serious works, but mischievously capped off with ''Trial by Jury''.<ref>Gilbert (1875), ''passim''</ref>\n\nAfter the success of ''Trial by Jury'', there were discussions towards reviving ''Thespis'', but Gilbert and Sullivan were not able to agree on terms with Carte and his backers. The score to ''Thespis'' was never published, and most of the music is now lost. It took some time for Carte to gather funds for another Gilbert and Sullivan opera, and in this gap Gilbert produced several works including ''[[Tom Cobb]]'' (1875), ''[[Eyes and No Eyes]]'' (1875, his last German Reed Entertainment), and ''[[Princess Toto]]'' (1876), his last and most ambitious work with Clay, a three-act comic opera with full orchestra, as opposed to the shorter works for much reduced accompaniment that came before. Gilbert also wrote two serious works during this time, ''[[Broken Hearts]]'' (1875) and ''[[Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith]]'' (1876).<ref name=PlayList/>\n\nAlso during this period, Gilbert wrote, ''[[Engaged (play)|Engaged]]'' (1877), which inspired [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]''. ''Engaged'' is a parody of romantic drama written in the \"topsy-turvy\" satiric style of many of Gilbert's Bab Ballads and the [[Savoy Opera]]s\u2014with one character pledging his love, in the most poetic and romantic language, to every single woman in the play. The story portrays some \"innocent\" Scottish rustics making a living by throwing trains off the lines and then charging the passengers for services and, in parallel, romance being gladly thrown over in favour of monetary gain. A ''[[New York Times]]'' reviewer wrote in 1879, \"Mr Gilbert, in his best work, has always shown a tendency to present improbabilities from a probable point of view, and in one sense, therefore, he can lay claim to originality; fortunately this merit in his case is supported by a really poetic imagination. In [''Engaged''] the author gives full swing to his humor, and the result, although exceedingly ephemeral, is a very amusing combination of characters \u2013 or caricatures \u2013 and mock-heroic incidents.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1879/02/18/archives/dramtic-and-musical-park-theatre.html \"Dramatic and Musical\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 18 February 1879, p. 5 {{subscription}}</ref> ''Engaged'' is still performed today, by both professional and amateur companies.<ref>Corry, John.

After both ''Princess Ida'' and ''Ruddigore'', which were less successful than the seven other operas from ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' to ''The Gondoliers'', Sullivan asked to leave the partnership, saying that he found Gilbert's plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically satisfying to him. While the two artists worked out their differences, Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of their earlier works. On each occasion, after a few months' pause, Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan's objections, and the partnership continued successfully.<ref name=Carpet/>\n\nIn April 1890, during the run of ''The Gondoliers'', however, Gilbert challenged Carte over the expenses of the production.

Gilbert confronted Carte, who refused to reconsider the accounts.

Gilbert contended that Carte had at best made a series of serious blunders in the accounts, and at worst deliberately attempted to swindle the others. It is not easy to settle the rights and wrongs of the issue at this distance, but it does seem fairly clear that there was something very wrong with the accounts at this time. Gilbert wrote to Sullivan on 28 May 1891, a year after the end of the \"Quarrel\", that Carte had admitted \"an unintentional overcharge of nearly \u00a31,000 in the electric lighting accounts alone.\"<ref name=Carpet/>\n\nGilbert brought suit, and after ''The Gondoliers'' closed in 1891, he withdrew the performance rights to his libretti, vowing to write no more operas for the Savoy.<ref name=vowed>Shepherd, Marc.

The G&S Project [[WP:G&S]] uses this term for all of their works.--> The most famous of these include ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' and one of the most frequently performed works in the history of musical theatre, ''[[The Mikado]]''.<ref>Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/gilbert3.htm ''G&S Story: Part III''], accessed 13 October 2006; and Powell, Jim. [http://www.libertystory.net/LSARTSGILBERT.htm ''William S. Gilbert's Wicked Wit for Liberty''] accessed 13 October 2006.</ref> The popularity of these works was supported for over a century by year-round performances of them, in Britain and abroad, by the repertory company that Gilbert, Sullivan and their producer [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] founded, the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]]. These [[Savoy opera]]s are still frequently performed in the English-speaking world and beyond.<ref>Bradley, Chapter 1 and ''passim''.</ref>\n\nGilbert's creative output included over 75 plays and [[libretto|libretti]], and numerous short stories, poems and lyrics, both comic and serious. After brief careers as a government clerk and a lawyer, Gilbert began to focus, in the 1860s, on writing light verse, including his ''[[Bab Ballads]]'', short stories, theatre reviews and illustrations, often for ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'' magazine. He also began to write [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] and his first comic plays, developing a unique absurdist, inverted style that would later be known as his \"topsy-turvy\" style. He also developed a [[realism (arts)|realistic]] method of stage direction and a reputation as a strict theatre director. In the 1870s, Gilbert wrote 40 plays and libretti, including his [[German Reed Entertainments]], several blank-verse \"fairy comedies\", some serious plays, and his first five collaborations with Sullivan: ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'', ''[[Trial by Jury]]'', ''[[The Sorcerer]]'', ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' and ''The Pirates of Penzance''. In the 1880s, Gilbert focused on the Savoy operas, including ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'', ''[[Iolanthe]]'', ''The Mikado'', ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' and ''[[The Gondoliers]]''.\n\nIn 1890, after this long and profitable creative partnership, Gilbert quarrelled with Sullivan and Carte concerning expenses at the Savoy Theatre; the dispute is referred to as the \"carpet quarrel\". Gilbert won the ensuing lawsuit, but the argument caused hurt feelings among the partnership. Although Gilbert and Sullivan were persuaded to collaborate on two last operas, they were not as successful as the previous ones. In later years, Gilbert wrote several plays, and a few operas with other collaborators. He retired, with his wife Lucy, and their ward, [[Nancy McIntosh]], to a country estate, [[Grim's Dyke]]. He was [[Knight bachelor|knight]]ed in 1907. Gilbert died of a heart attack while attempting to rescue a young woman to whom he was giving a swimming lesson in the lake at his home.\n\nGilbert's plays inspired other dramatists, including [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]],<ref>Feingold, Michael, [http://www.villagevoice.com/arts/engaging-the-past-7140486 \"Engaging the Past\"], ''The Village Voice'', 4 May 2004</ref> and his comic operas with Sullivan inspired the later development of American [[musical theatre]], especially influencing Broadway librettists and lyricists. According to ''[[The Cambridge History of English and American Literature]]'', Gilbert's \"lyrical facility and his mastery of metre raised the poetical quality of comic opera to a position that it had never reached before and has not reached since\".<ref name=CambridgeHistory>[http://www.bartelby.net/223/0815.html ''The Cambridge History of English and American Literature''], Volume XIII, Chapter VIII, Section 15 (1907\u201321)</ref>\n\n__TOC__ <!--These two lines prevent the layout from breaking if the ToC is closed -->\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Early life and career==\n\n===Beginnings===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|style=\"text-align: left;\" |''\"No sooner had the learned judge pronounced this sentence than the poor soul stooped down, and taking off a heavy boot, flung it at my head, as a reward for my eloquence on her behalf; accompanying the assault with a torrent of invective against my abilities as a counsel, and my line of defence.\"''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left;\" |\u2014 '''''My Maiden Brief'''''<ref name=MMB>Gilbert, W.

He then attended [[King's College London]], graduating in 1856. He intended to take the examinations for a commission in the [[Royal Artillery]], but with the end of the [[Crimean War]], fewer recruits were needed, and the only commission available to Gilbert would have been in a [[line regiment]].

In the 1860s he also contributed to [[Tom Hood]]'s Christmas annuals, to ''Saturday Night'', the ''Comic News'' and the ''Savage Club Papers''.

Written and rushed to the stage in 10 days, ''[[Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack]]'', a [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] of [[Gaetano Donizetti]]'s ''[[L'elisir d'amore]]'', proved extremely popular.

Together, these plays and their successors such as ''[[The Wicked World]]'' (1873), ''[[Sweethearts (play)|Sweethearts]]'' (1874), and ''[[Broken Hearts]]'' (1875), did for Gilbert on the dramatic stage what the German Reed entertainments had done for him on the musical stage: they established that his capabilities extended far beyond burlesque, won him artistic credentials, and demonstrated that he was a writer of wide range, as comfortable with human drama as with farcical humour. The success of these plays, especially ''Pygmalion and Galatea'', gave Gilbert a prestige that would be crucial to his later collaboration with as respected a musician as Sullivan.<ref name=Wren>Wren, p. 13.</ref>\n\nDuring this period, Gilbert also pushed the boundaries of how far satire could go in the theatre. He collaborated with [[Gilbert Arthur \u00e0 Beckett]] on ''[[The Happy Land]]'' (1873), a political satire (in part, a parody of his own ''The Wicked World''), which was briefly banned because of its unflattering caricatures of [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] and his ministers.<ref>Rees, Terence. \"''The Happy Land'': its true and remarkable history\" in ''W.

Gilbert worked again with Clay on ''[[Happy Arcadia]]'' (1872), and with [[Alfred Cellier]] on ''[[Topsyturveydom]]'' (1874), as well as writing several farces, operetta libretti, [[extravaganza]]s, fairy comedies, adaptations from novels, translations from the French, and the dramas described above. Also in 1874, he published his last contribution for ''Fun'' magazine (''\"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern\"''), after a gap of three years, then resigned due to disapproval of the new owner's other publishing interests.<ref>Jones, John Bush, \"W. S.

In 1868, Gilbert had published a short comic sketch in ''Fun'' magazine titled \"Trial by Jury: An Operetta\". In 1873, Gilbert was asked by the theatrical manager, [[Carl Rosa]], to write a work for his planned 1874 season. Gilbert expanded ''Trial'' into a one-act libretto. However, Rosa's wife [[Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa]], a childhood friend of Gilbert's, died after an illness in 1874 and Rosa dropped the project.<ref>Stedman, p. 121</ref> Later in 1874 Gilbert offered the libretto to [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], but Carte could not use the piece at that time. By early 1875, Carte was managing the [[Royalty Theatre]], and he needed a short opera to play as an afterpiece to [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]]'s ''[[La P\u00e9richole]]''. He contacted Gilbert, asked about the piece, and suggested Sullivan to set the work. Sullivan was enthusiastic, and ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' was composed in a matter of weeks. The little piece was a runaway hit, outlasting the run of ''La P\u00e9richole'' and being revived at another theatre.<ref>Walbrook, H. M.

Gilbert's burlesque comedy, Engaged.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Engaged (play)|Engaged]]'' (1877), is still produced.]]\nGilbert continued his quest to gain respect in and respectability for his profession. One thing that may have been holding dramatists back from respectability was that plays were not published in a form suitable for a \"gentleman's library\", as, at the time, they were generally cheaply and unattractively published for the use of actors rather than the home reader. To help rectify this, at least for himself, Gilbert arranged in late 1875 for publishers Chatto and Windus to print a volume of his plays in a format designed to appeal to the general reader, with an attractive binding and clear type, containing Gilbert's most respectable plays, including his most serious works, but mischievously capped off with ''Trial by Jury''.<ref>Gilbert (1875), ''passim''</ref>\n\nAfter the success of ''Trial by Jury'', there were discussions towards reviving ''Thespis'', but Gilbert and Sullivan were not able to agree on terms with Carte and his backers. The score to ''Thespis'' was never published, and most of the music is now lost. It took some time for Carte to gather funds for another Gilbert and Sullivan opera, and in this gap Gilbert produced several works including ''[[Tom Cobb]]'' (1875), ''[[Eyes and No Eyes]]'' (1875, his last German Reed Entertainment), and ''[[Princess Toto]]'' (1876), his last and most ambitious work with Clay, a three-act comic opera with full orchestra, as opposed to the shorter works for much reduced accompaniment that came before. Gilbert also wrote two serious works during this time, ''[[Broken Hearts]]'' (1875) and ''[[Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith]]'' (1876).<ref name=PlayList/>\n\nAlso during this period, Gilbert wrote, ''[[Engaged (play)|Engaged]]'' (1877), which inspired [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]''. ''Engaged'' is a parody of romantic drama written in the \"topsy-turvy\" satiric style of many of Gilbert's Bab Ballads and the [[Savoy Opera]]s\u2014with one character pledging his love, in the most poetic and romantic language, to every single woman in the play. The story portrays some \"innocent\" Scottish rustics making a living by throwing trains off the lines and then charging the passengers for services and, in parallel, romance being gladly thrown over in favour of monetary gain. A ''[[New York Times]]'' reviewer wrote in 1879, \"Mr Gilbert, in his best work, has always shown a tendency to present improbabilities from a probable point of view, and in one sense, therefore, he can lay claim to originality; fortunately this merit in his case is supported by a really poetic imagination. In [''Engaged''] the author gives full swing to his humor, and the result, although exceedingly ephemeral, is a very amusing combination of characters \u2013 or caricatures \u2013 and mock-heroic incidents.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1879/02/18/archives/dramtic-and-musical-park-theatre.html \"Dramatic and Musical\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 18 February 1879, p. 5 {{subscription}}</ref> ''Engaged'' is still performed today, by both professional and amateur companies.<ref>Corry, John.

The successful comic operas with Sullivan continued to appear every year or two, several of them being among the longest-running productions up to that point in the history of the musical stage.<ref name=beauty>[http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-frames.html?http&&&www.stagebeauty.net/th-longr.html List of longest running London shows through 1920].</ref>{{refn|''Pinafore'', ''Patience'' and ''The Mikado'' each held the position of second longest-running musical theatre production in history for a time (after adjusting Pinafore's initial run down to 571 performances), and ''The Gondoliers'' was not far behind.<ref name=beauty/>|group= n}} After ''Pinafore'' came ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' (1879), ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' (1881), ''[[Iolanthe]]'' (1882), ''[[Princess Ida]]'' (1884, based on Gilbert's earlier farce, ''[[The Princess (play)|The Princess]]''), ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1885), ''[[Ruddigore]]'' (1887), ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' (1888) and ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1889). Gilbert not only directed and oversaw all aspects of production for these works, but he actually ''designed'' the costumes himself for ''Patience'', ''Iolanthe'', ''Princess Ida'', and ''Ruddigore''.<ref>[http://gsarchive.net/whowaswho/G/GilbertWS.htm  Profile of W.

Gilbert arranged the original epic poem by [[Henry Hart Milman]] into a libretto suitable for the music, and it contains some original work. During this period, also, Gilbert occasionally wrote plays to be performed elsewhere\u2013both serious dramas (for example ''[[The Ne'er-Do-Weel]]'', 1878; and [[Gretchen (play)|Gretchen]], 1879) and humorous works (for example ''[[Foggerty's Fairy]]'', 1881). However, he no longer needed to turn out multiple plays each year, as he had done before. Indeed, during the more than nine years that separated ''The Pirates of Penzance'' and ''The Gondoliers'', he wrote just three plays outside of the partnership with Sullivan.<ref name=PlayList/> Only one of these works, ''Comedy and Tragedy'', proved successful.<ref>''Foggerty's Fairy'': Crowther, Andrew.

Gilbert trained for Harlequin's stylised dancing with his friend [[John D'Auban]], who had arranged the dances for some of his plays and would choreograph most of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.<ref name=Timesobit>\"Mr. D'Auban's 'Startrap' Jumps\".

Gilbert was often confrontational and notoriously thin-skinned, though prone to acts of extraordinary kindness, while Sullivan eschewed conflict.<ref name=Carpet>Crowther, Andrew, [http://www.gilbertandsullivanarchive.org/articles/html/quarrel.html \"The Carpet Quarrel Explained\"], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 28 June 1997, accessed 22 July 2016</ref> Gilbert imbued his libretti with \"topsy-turvy\" situations in which the social order was turned upside down. After a time, these subjects were often at odds with Sullivan's desire for realism and emotional content.<ref>See, e.g. Ainger, p. 288, or Wolfson, p. 3</ref> In addition, Gilbert's political satire often poked fun at those in the circles of privilege, while Sullivan was eager to socialise among the wealthy and titled people who would become his friends and patrons.<ref>See, e.g. Jacobs (1992); Crowther (2011); and Bond, Jessie.

After both ''Princess Ida'' and ''Ruddigore'', which were less successful than the seven other operas from ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' to ''The Gondoliers'', Sullivan asked to leave the partnership, saying that he found Gilbert's plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically satisfying to him. While the two artists worked out their differences, Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of their earlier works. On each occasion, after a few months' pause, Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan's objections, and the partnership continued successfully.<ref name=Carpet/>\n\nIn April 1890, during the run of ''The Gondoliers'', however, Gilbert challenged Carte over the expenses of the production. Among other items to which Gilbert objected, Carte had charged the cost of a new carpet for the Savoy Theatre lobby to the partnership.<ref name=Ford>\nFord, Tom.

''Limelight Magazine'', Haymarket Media Ltd., 8 June 2011\n</ref> Gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to Carte alone. Gilbert confronted Carte, who refused to reconsider the accounts. Gilbert stormed out and wrote to Sullivan that \"I left him with the remark that it was a mistake to kick down the ladder by which he had risen\".<ref name=Carpet/> [[Helen Carte]] wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte \"in a way that I should not have thought you would have used to an offending menial.\"<ref>Stedman, p. 270</ref> As the scholar Andrew Crowther has commented:\n\n:After all, the carpet was only one of a number of disputed items, and the real issue lay not in the mere money value of these things, but in whether Carte could be trusted with the financial affairs of Gilbert and Sullivan. Gilbert contended that Carte had at best made a series of serious blunders in the accounts, and at worst deliberately attempted to swindle the others. It is not easy to settle the rights and wrongs of the issue at this distance, but it does seem fairly clear that there was something very wrong with the accounts at this time. Gilbert wrote to Sullivan on 28 May 1891, a year after the end of the \"Quarrel\", that Carte had admitted \"an unintentional overcharge of nearly \u00a31,000 in the electric lighting accounts alone.\"<ref name=Carpet/>\n\nGilbert brought suit, and after ''The Gondoliers'' closed in 1891, he withdrew the performance rights to his libretti, vowing to write no more operas for the Savoy.<ref name=vowed>Shepherd, Marc.

Pop later recalled, \"very few people recognized the quality of the Stooges' songwriting, it was really meticulous. And to his credit, the only person I'd ever known of in print to notice it, among my peers of professional musicians, was Bowie. He noticed it right off.\"<ref name=\"Liner notes\">''Raw Power'' 1997 CD liner notes.</ref> Having signed on as a solo artist to [[Columbia Records]], Pop relocated to London, where he was to write and record an album with [[James Williamson (musician)|James Williamson]], who served as the Stooges' second guitarist from late 1970 until the band's initial dissolution in July 1971. When they failed to find a suitable English rhythm section, Pop suggested that former Stooges [[Ron Asheton]] and [[Scott Asheton]] fly over and participate in the recording sessions,<ref>''[[Gimme Danger]]'' documentary</ref> leading to the band's reformation under the new name of \"Iggy and the Stooges\". Although he was the band's founding guitarist, the elder Asheton reluctantly agreed to switch to [[electric bass]].\n\n== Recording ==\nInitial demo sessions were held at [[RG Jones Sound Engineering|RG Jones Studios]] in Wimbledon with sound engineer Gerry Kitchingham<ref>Richard Buskin: A-ha 'Take On Me' Classic Tracks. In: [[Sound on Sound]] magazine March 2011</ref> and at [[Olympic Studios]] in Barnes with sound engineer [[Keith Harwood]], with most of the songs rejected by the band's management. Pop said that Columbia executives insisted on two [[Ballad (music)|ballads]], one for each side of the album: \"Gimme Danger\" and \"I Need Somebody\". The album itself was recorded at CBS Studios in [[London]] with staff engineer Mike Ross-Trevor from September 10 to October 6, 1972. Pop produced and mixed the album by himself; unfortunately, his botched first attempt mixed most of the instruments into one stereo channel and the vocals into the other, with little regard for balance or tone quality. [[Tony DeFries]], the head of Bowie's management company MainMan, informed Pop that the album would be remixed by Bowie. Pop agreed to this, claiming that \"the other choice was I wasn't going to get my album out. I think DeFries told me that CBS refused to release it like that, I don't know\",<ref name=\"Liner notes\"/> but insisted that his own mix for \"[[Search and Destroy (The Stooges song)|Search and Destroy]]\" be retained. Due to budgetary constraints, Bowie remixed the other seven songs in a single day at [[Los Angeles]]' [[United Western Recorders|Western Sound Recorders]] in October 1972. Pop said of the production:\n\n{{quote|To the best of my recollection it was done in a day. I don't think it was two days. On a very, very old board, I mean this board was old! An Elvis type of board, old-tech, low-tech, in a poorly lit, cheap old studio with very little time. To David's credit, he listened with his ear to each thing and talked it out with me, I gave him what I thought it should have, he put that in its perspective, added some touches. He's always liked the most recent technology, so there was something called a Time Cube you could feed a signal into -- it looked like a bong, a big plastic tube with a couple of bends in it -- and when the sound came out the other end, it sort of shot at you like an echo effect. He used that on the guitar in \"Gimme Danger\", a beautiful guitar echo overload that's absolutely beautiful; and on the drums in \"Your Pretty Face Is Going To Hell\". His concept was, \"You're so primitive, your drummer should sound like he's [[log drum|beating a log]]!\" It's not a bad job that he did...I'm very proud of the eccentric, odd little record that came out.<ref name=\"Liner notes\"/>}}\n\nBowie later recalled:\n\n{{quote|...the most absurd situation I encountered when I was recording was the first time I worked with Iggy Pop. He wanted me to mix ''Raw Power'', so he brought the 24-track tape in, and he put it up. He had the band on one track, lead guitar on another and him on a third. Out of 24 tracks there were just three tracks that were used. He said 'see what you can do with this'. I said, 'Jim, there's nothing to mix'. So we just pushed the vocal up and down a lot. On at least four or five songs that was the situation, including \"Search and Destroy.\" That's got such a peculiar sound because all we did was occasionally bring the lead guitar up and take it out.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=International Musician |title=TIN MACHINE: BOWIE & GABRELS |url=http://www.bowiewonderworld.com/press/press90.htm#IM |author=Tony Horkins |date=December 1991 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}</ref>}}\n\n=== Alternate mixes ===\n[[File:Iggy & the Stooges - Rough Power.jpg|right|150px|thumb|''Rough Power'', a collection of Pop's original mixes for ''Raw Power'', was released by [[Bomp Records]] in 1993.]]\n\nLow-fidelity copies of Pop's original mixes circulated among fans for years. In 1993, a selection of these original mixes was released by [[Bomp Records]] as ''Rough Power''. Fans and critics generally agreed that the original mixes were interesting, but not necessarily superior to Bowie's efforts. Of the ''Rough Power'' release, Pop has remarked that \"what David and I came up with at these sessions was better than that.\"<ref name=\"Liner notes\"/>\n\nIn 1996, Columbia Records \"invited\" Pop to remix the entire album for re-release on CD. Pop said in the liner notes that had he declined, the studio would have remixed it without his blessing. Pop cited longtime encouragement from fans and peers, the existence of ''Rough Power'', his distaste for how the original 1989 CD release of ''Raw Power'' sounded, and the fact that Columbia would release the new mix on its subsidiary [[Legacy Recordings]] as factors that led him to go through with the new mix, which was undertaken at New York's [[Sony Music Studios]] in 1996. The remixed edition was released on April 22, 1997. In the album's accompanying liner notes, Pop states the following:\n\n{{quote|In retrospect, I think the little touches Bowie put on the mix helped and I think some of the things MainMan did helped, and more than anything else, what the whole experience did was to get me out of Detroit and onto a world stage. And also I learned a helluva lot being over there in England and I started thinking differently. It led to a very ambitious piece of work, and that's fine. But the fact was that neither Bowie's mix nor my previous mix could do justice to the power of the band or even to the legibility of the vocal&nbsp;... I feel that now I have the {{sic|wherewithall}}, the position, and the expertise at my disposal to give this thing its due sonically, and I didn't have that before. So it's kind of like I'm finishing that off. I don't think you can beat David's mix, it's very creative. But this is just a simple, straight band mix of a powerful band. I feel like there's a closure on it and that's a nice thing.<ref name=\"Liner notes\"/>}}\n\nOn the other hand, some fans \u2013 among them guitarist [[Robert Quine]] \u2013 felt that the new remix was as unfaithful to the material as the original 1973 mix, and further criticized the audible distortion in the new mix.<ref>{{cite web |work=[[Perfect Sound Forever (magazine)|Perfect Sound Forever]] |url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/quine.html |title=Robert Quine |author=Jason Gross |date=November 1997 |accessdate=February 9, 2012}}</ref> In the reissued CD's liner notes, however, Pop points out that one of his intentions in doing the new mix was to keep audio levels in the red (which would deliberately cause such distortion) while at the same time making the music more \"powerful and listenable\". This new version is arguably the \"[[loudness war|loudest album ever]]\", reaching RMS of -4&nbsp;dB, rare even by today's standards.<ref>http://chicagomasteringservice.com/loudness.html</ref>\n\nJames Williamson and Ron Asheton have both stated that they prefer Bowie's original mix of the album over Pop's remixed version.

Then Iggy, on his mix, he left a bunch of guitar stuff on there that probably shouldn't have been left in, and just odds and ends.

The album departed from the \"groove-ridden, feel-based songs\" of the band's first two records in favor of more anthemic [[hard rock]], while featuring guitar and songwriting contributions by [[James Williamson (musician)|James Williamson]].<ref name=\"Callwood\">{{cite book|last=Callwood|first=Brett|authorlink=Brett Callwood|chapter=4: Raw Power|title=The Stooges: Head On|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2011|isbn=0814337104}}</ref> Though not initially commercially successful, ''Raw Power'' gained a [[cult following]] in the years following its release, and, like its predecessor ''[[Fun House (The Stooges album)|Fun House]]'' (1970), is considered an influential forerunner of [[punk rock]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/stooges |title=The Stooges Biography |publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] |accessdate=October 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nAfter their first two albums ''[[The Stooges (album)|The Stooges]]'' (1969) and ''[[Fun House (The Stooges album)|Fun House]]'' (1970) were released to little commercial success, the Stooges were in disarray: the band had officially broken up, bassist [[Dave Alexander (musician)|Dave Alexander]] was fighting [[alcoholism]], and singer [[Iggy Pop]]'s [[heroin]] addiction was escalating prior to the intervention of [[David Bowie]]. Pop later recalled, \"very few people recognized the quality of the Stooges' songwriting, it was really meticulous. And to his credit, the only person I'd ever known of in print to notice it, among my peers of professional musicians, was Bowie. He noticed it right off.\"<ref name=\"Liner notes\">''Raw Power'' 1997 CD liner notes.</ref> Having signed on as a solo artist to [[Columbia Records]], Pop relocated to London, where he was to write and record an album with [[James Williamson (musician)|James Williamson]], who served as the Stooges' second guitarist from late 1970 until the band's initial dissolution in July 1971. When they failed to find a suitable English rhythm section, Pop suggested that former Stooges [[Ron Asheton]] and [[Scott Asheton]] fly over and participate in the recording sessions,<ref>''[[Gimme Danger]]'' documentary</ref> leading to the band's reformation under the new name of \"Iggy and the Stooges\". Although he was the band's founding guitarist, the elder Asheton reluctantly agreed to switch to [[electric bass]].\n\n== Recording ==\nInitial demo sessions were held at [[RG Jones Sound Engineering|RG Jones Studios]] in Wimbledon with sound engineer Gerry Kitchingham<ref>Richard Buskin: A-ha 'Take On Me' Classic Tracks. In: [[Sound on Sound]] magazine March 2011</ref> and at [[Olympic Studios]] in Barnes with sound engineer [[Keith Harwood]], with most of the songs rejected by the band's management. Pop said that Columbia executives insisted on two [[Ballad (music)|ballads]], one for each side of the album: \"Gimme Danger\" and \"I Need Somebody\". The album itself was recorded at CBS Studios in [[London]] with staff engineer Mike Ross-Trevor from September 10 to October 6, 1972. Pop produced and mixed the album by himself; unfortunately, his botched first attempt mixed most of the instruments into one stereo channel and the vocals into the other, with little regard for balance or tone quality. [[Tony DeFries]], the head of Bowie's management company MainMan, informed Pop that the album would be remixed by Bowie. Pop agreed to this, claiming that \"the other choice was I wasn't going to get my album out. I think DeFries told me that CBS refused to release it like that, I don't know\",<ref name=\"Liner notes\"/> but insisted that his own mix for \"[[Search and Destroy (The Stooges song)|Search and Destroy]]\" be retained. Due to budgetary constraints, Bowie remixed the other seven songs in a single day at [[Los Angeles]]' [[United Western Recorders|Western Sound Recorders]] in October 1972. Pop said of the production:\n\n{{quote|To the best of my recollection it was done in a day. I don't think it was two days. On a very, very old board, I mean this board was old! An Elvis type of board, old-tech, low-tech, in a poorly lit, cheap old studio with very little time. To David's credit, he listened with his ear to each thing and talked it out with me, I gave him what I thought it should have, he put that in its perspective, added some touches. He's always liked the most recent technology, so there was something called a Time Cube you could feed a signal into -- it looked like a bong, a big plastic tube with a couple of bends in it -- and when the sound came out the other end, it sort of shot at you like an echo effect. He used that on the guitar in \"Gimme Danger\", a beautiful guitar echo overload that's absolutely beautiful; and on the drums in \"Your Pretty Face Is Going To Hell\". His concept was, \"You're so primitive, your drummer should sound like he's [[log drum|beating a log]]!\" It's not a bad job that he did...I'm very proud of the eccentric, odd little record that came out.<ref name=\"Liner notes\"/>}}\n\nBowie later recalled:\n\n{{quote|...the most absurd situation I encountered when I was recording was the first time I worked with Iggy Pop. He wanted me to mix ''Raw Power'', so he brought the 24-track tape in, and he put it up. He had the band on one track, lead guitar on another and him on a third. Out of 24 tracks there were just three tracks that were used. He said 'see what you can do with this'. I said, 'Jim, there's nothing to mix'. So we just pushed the vocal up and down a lot. On at least four or five songs that was the situation, including \"Search and Destroy.\" That's got such a peculiar sound because all we did was occasionally bring the lead guitar up and take it out.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=International Musician |title=TIN MACHINE: BOWIE & GABRELS |url=http://www.bowiewonderworld.com/press/press90.htm#IM |author=Tony Horkins |date=December 1991 |accessdate=9 February 2012}}</ref>}}\n\n=== Alternate mixes ===\n[[File:Iggy & the Stooges - Rough Power.jpg|right|150px|thumb|''Rough Power'', a collection of Pop's original mixes for ''Raw Power'', was released by [[Bomp Records]] in 1993.]]\n\nLow-fidelity copies of Pop's original mixes circulated among fans for years. In 1993, a selection of these original mixes was released by [[Bomp Records]] as ''Rough Power''. Fans and critics generally agreed that the original mixes were interesting, but not necessarily superior to Bowie's efforts. Of the ''Rough Power'' release, Pop has remarked that \"what David and I came up with at these sessions was better than that.\"<ref name=\"Liner notes\"/>\n\nIn 1996, Columbia Records \"invited\" Pop to remix the entire album for re-release on CD. Pop said in the liner notes that had he declined, the studio would have remixed it without his blessing. Pop cited longtime encouragement from fans and peers, the existence of ''Rough Power'', his distaste for how the original 1989 CD release of ''Raw Power'' sounded, and the fact that Columbia would release the new mix on its subsidiary [[Legacy Recordings]] as factors that led him to go through with the new mix, which was undertaken at New York's [[Sony Music Studios]] in 1996. The remixed edition was released on April 22, 1997. In the album's accompanying liner notes, Pop states the following:\n\n{{quote|In retrospect, I think the little touches Bowie put on the mix helped and I think some of the things MainMan did helped, and more than anything else, what the whole experience did was to get me out of Detroit and onto a world stage. And also I learned a helluva lot being over there in England and I started thinking differently. It led to a very ambitious piece of work, and that's fine. But the fact was that neither Bowie's mix nor my previous mix could do justice to the power of the band or even to the legibility of the vocal&nbsp;... I feel that now I have the {{sic|wherewithall}}, the position, and the expertise at my disposal to give this thing its due sonically, and I didn't have that before. So it's kind of like I'm finishing that off. I don't think you can beat David's mix, it's very creative. But this is just a simple, straight band mix of a powerful band. I feel like there's a closure on it and that's a nice thing.<ref name=\"Liner notes\"/>}}\n\nOn the other hand, some fans \u2013 among them guitarist [[Robert Quine]] \u2013 felt that the new remix was as unfaithful to the material as the original 1973 mix, and further criticized the audible distortion in the new mix.<ref>{{cite web |work=[[Perfect Sound Forever (magazine)|Perfect Sound Forever]] |url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/quine.html |title=Robert Quine |author=Jason Gross |date=November 1997 |accessdate=February 9, 2012}}</ref> In the reissued CD's liner notes, however, Pop points out that one of his intentions in doing the new mix was to keep audio levels in the red (which would deliberately cause such distortion) while at the same time making the music more \"powerful and listenable\". This new version is arguably the \"[[loudness war|loudest album ever]]\", reaching RMS of -4&nbsp;dB, rare even by today's standards.<ref>http://chicagomasteringservice.com/loudness.html</ref>\n\nJames Williamson and Ron Asheton have both stated that they prefer Bowie's original mix of the album over Pop's remixed version. Williamson stated:\n\n{{quote|I personally think [the remixed ''Raw Power''] sucked. I gotta tell ya that I like the IDEA of what [Iggy] tried to do, and I talked to him about it, and there's a lot of factors involved, but at the time, none of us liked Bowie's mix, but given everything, Iggy, when he went in to mix it, he found out that the guy who had recorded it originally had not gotten a lot of level on certain things, like the bass and drums, especially the bass, so he didn't have a lot to work with. Then Iggy, on his mix, he left a bunch of guitar stuff on there that probably shouldn't have been left in, and just odds and ends. Bowie's not my favorite guy, but I have to say that overall, I think he did a pretty good job.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.i94bar.com/ints/james1.html |title=James Williamson talks: Raw Power 30 years on |author=Ken Shimamoto |work=i94bar.com |accessdate=February 9, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051228203950/http://www.i94bar.com/ints/james1.html |archivedate=December 28, 2005 }}</ref>}}\n\nAsheton stated:\n\n{{quote|[[Don Fleming (musician)|Don Fleming]] goes, \"You know what?

Then I called Fleming and I'm going, \"Gee, Don, I just listened to Iggy's mix of ''Raw Power.'' Man, I sure loved that old David Bowie mix. Was it ever great.\"\n\nBasically, all that Iggy did was take all the smoothness and all the effects off James [Williamson]'s guitar, so his leads sound really abrupt and stilty and almost clumsy, and he just put back every single grunt, groan, and word he ever said on the whole fuckin' soundtrack. He just totally restored everything that was cut out of him in the first mix, and I thought, Damn, I really did like the old mix better.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.i94bar.com/interviews/calling-from-the-fun-house-stooges-guitarist-ron-asheton/all-pages |title=RON ASHETON: CALLING FROM THE FUNHOUSE |author=Ken Shimamoto |work=i94bar.com |accessdate=February 9, 2012}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 2002, Bowie said that his original mix of ''Raw Power'' is \"the version I still prefer over the later remix \u2013 it has more wound-up ferocity and chaos and, in my humble opinion, is a hallmark roots sound for what was later to become [[punk rock|punk]].\"<ref>{{cite book |author=[[David Bowie]] |title=Moonage Daydream |publisher=Hardie Grant Books |year=2005 |page=61}}</ref>\n\nPop and Bowie's mixes were both remastered in 2012 for a [[Record Store Day]] double LP by Kevin Gray and Mark Wilder, respectively; this remastering was free of [[clipping (audio)|clipping]].\n\n== Marketing and sales ==\n''Raw Power'' was released on February 7, 1973<ref name=releasedate /> under the moniker of \"Iggy and the Stooges\", in contrast to the band's first two albums, which were credited to \"the Stooges\".

It includes routes that were defined by the [[California State Legislature]] but never built, as well as routes that have been entirely relinquished to local governments. It does not include the few routes that were relinquished before 1964 or the larger number of sign routes that were renumbered in or before 1964.\n\nEach state highway in California is maintained by the [[California Department of Transportation]] (Caltrans) and is assigned a ''Route'' (officially ''State Highway Route''<ref>{{cite book |chapter= [[wikisource:California Streets and Highways Code/Section 230-233|Section 231]] |title= California Streets and Highways Code |via= [[Wikisource]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author= [[California Department of Transportation]] |url= http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/transprog/stip/2004%20ITIP/other.htm |title= Other State Highway Routes |location= Sacramento |publisher= California Department of Transportation}}</ref>) number in the [[wikisource:California Streets and Highways Code/Section 301-635|Streets and Highways Code (Sections 300-635)]]. Under the code, the state assigns a unique ''Route X'' to each highway, and does not differentiate between state, US, or Interstate highways.\n\n==List==\n* [[List of U.S. Routes in California|U.S. Routes]] and [[List of Interstate Highways in California|Interstate Highways]] that traverse California are also defined in the California Streets and Highways code as state routes. This list does not include these state routes as they are listed separately.\n* A few cases exist, such as [[California State Route 110|SR 110]], where a defined California State Route partially overlaps with a federally defined Interstate Highway, while the remaining portion is signed as a state highway. This table only addresses the portion signed as a California State Route in these cases.\n* Lengths for each state route were initially measured as they existed during the [[1964 state highway renumbering (California)|1964 state highway renumbering]] (or during the year the route was established, if after 1964), and do not necessarily reflect the current mileage.\n* The years listed reflect when the route was affected by legislative action, this is not necessarily the same year as the actual construction or signing changes to the route. Most notably, [[California State Route 275|SR 275]] was deleted from the Streets and Highways Code in 1996, but remained partially maintained until it was added back in 2010; and [[California State Route 42|SR 42]] was signed as such for over 30 years after it was renumbered [[Interstate 105 (California)|105]].\n* [[Concurrency (road)|Concurrences]] are not explicitly codified in the Streets and Highways Code; such highway segments are listed on only one of the corresponding legislative route numbers. For example, the [[Interstate 80 in California|I-80]]/[[Interstate 580 (California)|I-580]] concurrency, known as the [[Eastshore Freeway]], is only listed under Route 80 in the highway code while the definition of Route 580 is broken into non-contiguous segments. When a highway is broken into such segments, the total length recorded by Caltrans only reflects those non-contiguous segments and does not include those overlaps that would be required to make the route continuous.\n* Some highways are not contiguous as the state has relinquished control of small sections to local governments. The stated length of the highway may or may not reflect the portions under local control.\n\n{{routelist top|length_ref=<ref name=trucklist>{{Caltrans trucklist}}</ref><ref group=lower-alpha>Lengths

It includes routes that were defined by the [[California State Legislature]] but never built, as well as routes that have been entirely relinquished to local governments. It does not include the few routes that were relinquished before 1964 or the larger number of sign routes that were renumbered in or before 1964.\n\nEach state highway in California is maintained by the [[California Department of Transportation]] (Caltrans) and is assigned a ''Route'' (officially ''State Highway Route''<ref>{{cite book |chapter= [[wikisource:California Streets and Highways Code/Section 230-233|Section 231]] |title= California Streets and Highways Code |via= [[Wikisource]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author= [[California Department of Transportation]] |url= http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/transprog/stip/2004%20ITIP/other.htm |title= Other State Highway Routes |location= Sacramento |publisher= California Department of Transportation}}</ref>) number in the [[wikisource:California Streets and Highways Code/Section 301-635|Streets and Highways Code (Sections 300-635)]]. Under the code, the state assigns a unique ''Route X'' to each highway, and does not differentiate between state, US, or Interstate highways.\n\n==List==\n* [[List of U.S. Routes in California|U.S. Routes]] and [[List of Interstate Highways in California|Interstate Highways]] that traverse California are also defined in the California Streets and Highways code as state routes. This list does not include these state routes as they are listed separately.\n* A few cases exist, such as [[California State Route 110|SR 110]], where a defined California State Route partially overlaps with a federally defined Interstate Highway, while the remaining portion is signed as a state highway. This table only addresses the portion signed as a California State Route in these cases.\n* Lengths for each state route were initially measured as they existed during the [[1964 state highway renumbering (California)|1964 state highway renumbering]] (or during the year the route was established, if after 1964), and do not necessarily reflect the current mileage.\n* The years listed reflect when the route was affected by legislative action, this is not necessarily the same year as the actual construction or signing changes to the route. Most notably, [[California State Route 275|SR 275]] was deleted from the Streets and Highways Code in 1996, but remained partially maintained until it was added back in 2010; and [[California State Route 42|SR 42]] was signed as such for over 30 years after it was renumbered [[Interstate 105 (California)|105]].\n* [[Concurrency (road)|Concurrences]] are not explicitly codified in the Streets and Highways Code; such highway segments are listed on only one of the corresponding legislative route numbers. For example, the [[Interstate 80 in California|I-80]]/[[Interstate 580 (California)|I-580]] concurrency, known as the [[Eastshore Freeway]], is only listed under Route 80 in the highway code while the definition of Route 580 is broken into non-contiguous segments. When a highway is broken into such segments, the total length recorded by Caltrans only reflects those non-contiguous segments and does not include those overlaps that would be required to make the route continuous.\n* Some highways are not contiguous as the state has relinquished control of small sections to local governments. The stated length of the highway may or may not reflect the portions under local control.\n\n{{routelist top|length_ref=<ref name=trucklist>{{Caltrans trucklist}}</ref><ref group=lower-alpha>Lengths
