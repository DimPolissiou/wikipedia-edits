It also retained the old versioning format (for example, Android 7.1 is LineageOS 14.1). \n\nPrior to the official launch of LineageOS, many developers from [[XDA Developers|XDA]] had already developed unofficial versions of LineageOS from the source code.\n\n* On 22 January 2017, the first 14.1 and 13.0 official builds started to be made available, following the official announcement in a blog post.<ref name=\"build-prep\" />\n* On 11 February 2018, the 13.0 builds were stopped,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://review.lineageos.org/#/c/206008/|title=Gerrit Code Review|website=review.lineageos.org|access-date=2018-02-13}}</ref> while the source code remains available and security fixes are still accepted on Gerrit.\n* On 26 February 2018, the first 15.1 official builds started to be available on certain devices, following official announcement in a blog post.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lineageos.org/Changelog-16/|title=Changelog 16 - Smart Styles, Treble is trouble and Omfg Oreo|last=LineageOS|website=www.lineageos.org|access-date=2018-02-25}}</ref> The 14.1 versions of Lineage OS were to remain in active development, but without feature advancements.\n* On 24 February 2019, the 14.1 builds were stopped and 15.1 builds moved to a weekly cadence<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://review.lineageos.org/c/LineageOS/hudson/+/242408|title=Prepare for 16.0|website=review.lineageos.org|access-date=2019-08-27}}</ref>\n* On 1 March 2019, the first 16.0 official builds started to be available, following official announcement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lineageos.org/Changelog-22/|title=Changelog 22 - Pushing Pie, Bracing Builds and Careful Calculator|last=LineageOS|website=lineageos.org|language=en|access-date=2019-08-27}}</ref> The 15.1 branch remains in active development, but without feature advancements.\n* On 28 February 2020, the 15.1 builds were stopped in preparation for the 17.1 release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/LineageOS/hudson/commit/4838aba0b3e9a71f0e7e07f9901c6ed81ea6fd80|title=RIP Oreo|website=github.com|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n* On 1 April 2020, the first 17.1 builds started to be available, following official announcement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lineageos.org/Changelog-24/|title=Changelog 24|last=LineageOS|website=lineageos.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> The 16.0 builds are moved to a weekly cadence while the branch remains in active development, but without feature advancements.\n\nAll the released builds are signed with LineageOS' private keys.<ref name=\"build-prep\">{{cite web|url=http://lineageos.org/Update-and-Build-Prep/|title=Update & Build Prep|last=OS|first=Lineage|website=Lineageos.org|access-date=2017-01-21}}</ref>\n\nBuilds were released on a weekly basis until 12 November 2018, when the release cycle for devices has changed: the latest LineageOS branch is built daily, with devices receiving a \"nightly\" OTA update, while devices on the older branch are were moved to a weekly release cycle.<ref name=\"Release Cycle\">{{cite web|url=https://lineageos.org/Changelog-21/|title=Changelog 21 - Nightlies Now, Improved Infrastructure and Precious Pie}}</ref>\n\n==Community==\nLineageOS allows the community to get involved with the development in various ways. [[Gerrit (software)|Gerrit]] is used for the code review process of both the operating system and the infrastructure.\n\nThe wiki, containing information regarding installation, support, and development of LineageOS, is also open to contributions through Gerrit. Other Lineage platforms include Crowdin for managing translations, [[GitLab|Gitlab Issues]] for bug tracking, and a stats page, which displays the number of active installations from users which opt-in to report this statistic. There is also an official [[Reddit|subreddit]], r/lineageos, and two [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC channels]] hosted on [[Freenode]] (''#lineageos'' and ''#lineageos-dev'').\n\nThe XDA Developers forums have been used by members of the Lineage community since the first inception of the software, many devices are left unsupported by official releases so community members develop their own Unofficial-ROMs that allow older phones to use Lineage. These unofficial releases are often bundled with software intended to aid the user's experience that would otherwise be unseen in an official release. They also come with known bugs and security issues that may not be seen in official releases.\n\nDuring August 2017 the LineageOS team held a Summer Survey<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lineageos.org/Summer-Survey/|title=Summer Survey|last=LineageOS|website=Lineageos.org|access-date=2017-10-25}}</ref> in which they asked users for feedback to improve the development of the operating system. The results were published<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lineageos.org/Summer-Survey-Results/|title=Summer Survey - Results|last=LineageOS|website=Lineageos.org|access-date=2017-10-25}}</ref> in October and, according to the team, they used the gathered data to improve the upcoming LineageOS 15 release. The second Summer Survey was conducted in August 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lineageos.org/Summer-Survey-2/|title=Summer Survey 2 - Attack of the feedbacks|last=LineageOS|website=lineageos.org|access-date=2018-09-09}}</ref>\n\nAs a response to one of the main suggestions received during their first public survey, LineageOS launched a section on their blog titled \"LineageOS Engineering Blog\" where Lineage maintainers and developers can contribute articles discussing advanced technical information pertaining to Android development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lineageos.org/Trust-me/|title=Trust me, I'm an engineer|date=12 June 2018|website=LineageOS|accessdate=9 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nLineageOS is also known for posting a \"regularly irregular review\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lineageos.org/Changelog-13/|title=Changelog 13 - Wonderful Webviews, Pedantic Permissions and Disappearing Dates|last=LineageOS|website=Lineageos.org|access-date=2017-10-25}}</ref> on its blog in which the active development of the work is discussed.\n\n==Version history==\n{{See also|Android version history|CyanogenMod#History and development}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+\n|-\n!

Some of these features are:\n\n==== Customization features ====\n\n* Button customization \u2013 Set custom location for buttons on the navigation bar, or enable on-screen buttons for devices with hardware buttons.\n* Custom Quick-Setting tiles \u2013 Quick Setting Tiles such as \"Caffeine\" preventing the device from sleeping, enabling/disabling Heads Up notifications, \"Ambient Display\" and \"ADB over network\" are present to easily toggle frequently accessed settings.\n* LiveDisplay \u2013 Adjust color temperature for the time of day.\n* Lock screen customization \u2013 The lock screen allows all sorts of customizations, including media cover art, a music visualizer, and double-tap to sleep.\n* Styles \u2013 Set a global dark or light theme mode and customize accent colors. This functionality can also be managed automatically by the system based on wallpaper or time of day (in line with LiveDisplay).\n* System Profiles \u2013 Enable or disable common settings based on the selected profile (For example, a \"Home\" profile and a \"Work\" profile). The profile can be selected either manually or through the use of a \"trigger\", such as upon connecting to a specific WiFi access point, connecting to a Bluetooth device, or tapping an [[Near-field communication|NFC]] tag.\n*Custom pattern sizes \u2013 In addition to Android's 3x3 pattern size, a 4x4, 5x5 or 6x6 size can be used.\n\n==== Security & privacy features ====\n\n* PIN scramble \u2013 For users securing their device with a [[Personal identification number|PIN]], the layout can be scrambled each time the device locks to make it difficult for people to figure out your lock by looking over your shoulder.\n* Privacy guard \u2013 Allow the user to fine-tune what permissions are granted to each application. For some permissions, it's possible to set a manual approval each time the permission is requested. It's also possible to find out how often apps use a specific permission. This feature was removed in the 17.1 branch in favor of an equivalent \"permission controller\" based on an hidden AOSP feature.\n* Protected Apps \u2013 Hide specific apps behind a secure lock. This works hand-in-hand with Trebuchet; the app's icon is removed from the launcher, and \"secure folders\" can be created to easily access these applications. A pattern is used to lock these apps.\n* Some \"sensitive numbers\", such as abuse support numbers, are not included in the call log for privacy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lineageos.org/Changelog-10/|title=Changelog 10 - Sensitive numbers and our CVE Tracker|last=LineageOS|website=lineageos.org}}</ref>\n* Trust - helps to keep the device secure and protects privacy.\n\n==== Developers & power user features ====\n\n* LineageSDK \u2013 a set of APIs for app developers to integrate their apps with LineageOS specific features such as System Profiles, Styles and Weather.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lineageos.org/Introducing-the-LineageSDK/|title=Introducing the LineageSDK|last=LineageOS|website=lineageos.org|language=en|access-date=2019-08-27}}</ref>\n*Lineage Recovery - an AOSP-based recovery for devices with an A/B type system.\n* (Optional) Root \u2013 Permit apps to function with [[Superuser|root access]] to perform advanced tasks. This requires flashing from Recovery either LineageOS's root add-on or a third-party implementation such as Magisk or SuperSU.\n* Telephone call recorder, not available in all countries, due to legal restrictions.\n* Weather providers \u2013 Display the weather in widgets or apps using a weather provider. This functionality is not included by default; a weather provider must be downloaded from the LineageOS Downloads website. App developers can create both providers and consumers of weather data.\n\n==Trust interface==\nAs LineageOS evolved through development, the Trust interface was introduced for all the LineageOS 15.1 builds released since 12 June 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lineageos.org/Trust-me/|title=Trust me, I'm an engineer|last=LineageOS|website=lineageos.org}}</ref> The interface can be found on supported devices under Security and Privacy tab under the Settings option, and enables the user to \"get an overview of the status of core security features and explanations on how to act to make sure the device is secure and the data is private\".\n\nAdditionally, while carrying out any action on the device, the trust icon is displayed, notifying the user that the action is safe.\n\n==Supported devices==\nThe number of devices supported by LineageOS increases with time, being 105 for v15.1 and v16 {{As of|2019|8|25|lc=y|df=US}}.<ref name=\"hudson build targets\"/><ref name=\"devices\">{{cite web|url= http://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/ |title= Devices |website= LineageOS Wiki |access-date= 2019-11-23 }}</ref> Official builds on currently supported development branches are labeled as either \"nightly\", \"weekly\", or \"monthly\".

[[Gerrit (software)|Gerrit]] is used for the code review process of both the operating system and the infrastructure.\n\nThe wiki, containing information regarding installation, support, and development of LineageOS, is also open to contributions through Gerrit. Other Lineage platforms include Crowdin for managing translations, [[GitLab|Gitlab Issues]] for bug tracking, and a stats page, which displays the number of active installations from users which opt-in to report this statistic. There is also an official [[Reddit|subreddit]], r/lineageos, and two [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC channels]] hosted on [[Freenode]] (''#lineageos'' and ''#lineageos-dev'').\n\nThe XDA Developers forums have been used by members of the Lineage community since the first inception of the software, many devices are left unsupported by official releases so community members develop their own Unofficial-ROMs that allow older phones to use Lineage. These unofficial releases are often bundled with software intended to aid the user's experience that would otherwise be unseen in an official release. They also come with known bugs and security issues that may not be seen in official releases.\n\nDuring August 2017 the LineageOS team held a Summer Survey<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lineageos.org/Summer-Survey/|title=Summer Survey|last=LineageOS|website=Lineageos.org|access-date=2017-10-25}}</ref> in which they asked users for feedback to improve the development of the operating system.

Some of these features are:\n\n==== Customization features ====\n\n* Button customization \u2013 Set custom location for buttons on the navigation bar, or enable on-screen buttons for devices with hardware buttons.\n* Custom Quick-Setting tiles \u2013 Quick Setting Tiles such as \"Caffeine\" preventing the device from sleeping, enabling/disabling Heads Up notifications, \"Ambient Display\" and \"ADB over network\" are present to easily toggle frequently accessed settings.\n* LiveDisplay \u2013 Adjust color temperature for the time of day.\n* Lock screen customization \u2013 The lock screen allows all sorts of customizations, including media cover art, a music visualizer, and double-tap to sleep.\n* Styles \u2013 Set a global dark or light theme mode and customize accent colors. This functionality can also be managed automatically by the system based on wallpaper or time of day (in line with LiveDisplay).\n* System Profiles \u2013 Enable or disable common settings based on the selected profile (For example, a \"Home\" profile and a \"Work\" profile). The profile can be selected either manually or through the use of a \"trigger\", such as upon connecting to a specific WiFi access point, connecting to a Bluetooth device, or tapping an [[Near-field communication|NFC]] tag.\n*Custom pattern sizes \u2013 In addition to Android's 3x3 pattern size, a 4x4, 5x5 or 6x6 size can be used.\n\n==== Security & privacy features ====\n\n* PIN scramble \u2013 For users securing their device with a [[Personal identification number|PIN]], the layout can be scrambled each time the device locks to make it difficult for people to figure out your lock by looking over your shoulder.\n* Privacy guard \u2013 Allow the user to fine-tune what permissions are granted to each application. For some permissions, it's possible to set a manual approval each time the permission is requested. It's also possible to find out how often apps use a specific permission. This feature was removed in the 17.1 branch in favor of an equivalent \"permission controller\" based on an hidden AOSP feature.\n* Protected Apps \u2013 Hide specific apps behind a secure lock. This works hand-in-hand with Trebuchet; the app's icon is removed from the launcher, and \"secure folders\" can be created to easily access these applications. A pattern is used to lock these apps.\n* Some \"sensitive numbers\", such as abuse support numbers, are not included in the call log for privacy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lineageos.org/Changelog-10/|title=Changelog 10 - Sensitive numbers and our CVE Tracker|last=LineageOS|website=lineageos.org}}</ref>\n* Trust - helps to keep the device secure and protects privacy.\n\n==== Developers & power user features ====\n\n* LineageSDK \u2013 a set of APIs for app developers to integrate their apps with LineageOS specific features such as System Profiles, Styles and Weather.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lineageos.org/Introducing-the-LineageSDK/|title=Introducing the LineageSDK|last=LineageOS|website=lineageos.org|language=en|access-date=2019-08-27}}</ref>\n*Lineage Recovery - an AOSP-based recovery for devices with an A/B type system.\n* (Optional) Root \u2013 Permit apps to function with [[Superuser|root access]] to perform advanced tasks. This requires flashing from Recovery either LineageOS's root add-on or a third-party implementation such as Magisk.\n* Telephone call recorder, not available in all countries, due to legal restrictions.\n* Weather providers \u2013 Display the weather in widgets or apps using a weather provider. This functionality is not included by default; a weather provider must be downloaded from the LineageOS Downloads website. App developers can create both providers and consumers of weather data.\n\n==Trust interface==\nAs LineageOS evolved through development, the Trust interface was introduced for all the LineageOS 15.1 builds released since 12 June 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lineageos.org/Trust-me/|title=Trust me, I'm an engineer|last=LineageOS|website=lineageos.org}}</ref> The interface can be found on supported devices under Security and Privacy tab under the Settings option, and enables the user to \"get an overview of the status of core security features and explanations on how to act to make sure the device is secure and the data is private\".\n\nAdditionally, while carrying out any action on the device, the trust icon is displayed, notifying the user that the action is safe.\n\n==Supported devices==\nThe number of devices supported by LineageOS increases with time, being 105 for v15.1 and v16 {{As of|2019|8|25|lc=y|df=US}}.<ref name=\"hudson build targets\"/><ref name=\"devices\">{{cite web|url= http://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/ |title= Devices |website= LineageOS Wiki |access-date= 2019-11-23 }}</ref> Official builds on currently supported development branches are labeled as either \"nightly\", \"weekly\", or \"monthly\". For the first two months of the project, parallel experimental builds were also produced, allowing in-place upgrades from previous CyanogenMod installations and easing migration to LineageOS.<ref name=\"devices\"/><ref name=\":3\">{{cite web|url=https://download.lineageos.org|title=LineageOS Downloads|access-date=24 January 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126175103/https://download.lineageos.org/|archivedate=26 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://lineageos.org/Update-and-Build-Prep/|title=Update & Build Prep|date=20 January 2017|newspaper=LineageOS|access-date=24 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{cite news |last=Rigg |first=Jamie |date=24 January 2017 |title=The first builds of CyanogenMod successor LineageOS are out |url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/01/24/cyanogenmod-lineageos/ |work=[[Engadget]] |accessdate=24 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Criticism and reception  ==\n===2018 April Fools' prank ===\nLineageOS was criticized for a deceptive [[April Fools' Day|April Fool's]] prank included with some April 2018 builds.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/04/05/dont-freak-lineageos-bad-late-april-fools-joke-latest-builds/|title=Don't freak out: LineageOS has a very bad and very late April Fools' joke in latest builds|date=2018-04-05|work=Android Police|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first week of April 2018 LineageOS released new builds with the \"LOSGenuine\" prank that informed unaware users of the software possibly being counterfeit via a persistent notification (which could not be disabled unless the user ran the following command in a root shell):\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"shell\">\nsetprop persist.lineage.nofool true \n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nWhen the notification was tapped, the software claimed that the device was \"uncertified\" and needed to mine \"LOSCoins\", which were a virtual currency and could not actually be spent. Affected builds also had a preinstalled \"Wallet\" app that showed the current balance of LOSCoins.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nMany users mistook the prank for actual [[malware]], and others reportedly found it to be in \"poor taste\". It was especially criticized for being too \"late\" for an April Fool's joke, since many users didn't receive the update until days later, making the jest less obvious. On 10 April 2018, LineageOS team director ''ciwrl'' issued an official apology for the deceptive prank.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lineageos.org/An-April-Apology/|title=An April Apology|last=LineageOS|website=lineageos.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/04/10/lineageos-apologises-late-bad-taste-april-fools-joke/|title=LineageOS apologizes for late and 'bad taste' April Fools' joke|date=2018-04-10|work=Android Police|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Forks==\n[[Replicant (operating system)|Replicant]] is a completely free software variant of LineageOS, with all kernel blobs and non-free drivers removed.\n\nAs a response to the refusal for several reasons of support for signature spoofing in official builds,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://review.lineageos.org/#/c/195284/|title=Gerrit Code Review|website=review.lineageos.org|access-date=2018-02-13}}</ref> a LineageOS fork with [[microG]]<ref name=\"microG\">\"[https://microg.org ''microG''] provides a free version of the set of APIs equivalent to Google\u2019s proprietary core libraries and applications.\"</ref> services included, known as \"LineageOS for microG\", was created.

Mountains to the north, northwest and west shield the city and northern China's agricultural heartland from the encroaching desert steppes. The northwestern part of the municipality, especially [[Yanqing County]] and [[Huairou District]], are dominated by the [[Jundu Mountains]], while the western part is framed by ''Xishan'' or the [[Western Hills]]. The [[Great Wall of China]] across the northern part of Beijing Municipality was built on the rugged topography to defend against nomadic incursions from the steppes. [[Mount Ling (Beijing)|Mount Dongling]], in the Western Hills and on the border with [[Hebei]], is the municipality's highest point, with an altitude of {{convert|2303|m}}.\n\nMajor rivers flowing through the municipality, including the [[Chaobai River|Chaobai]], [[Yongding River|Yongding]], [[Juma River (China)|Juma]], are all tributaries in the [[Hai River]] system, and flow in a southeasterly direction. The Miyun Reservoir, on the upper reaches of the Chaobai River, is the largest reservoir within the municipality. Beijing is also the northern terminus of the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] to [[Hangzhou]], which was built over 1,400 years ago as a transportation route, and the [[South\u2013North Water Transfer Project]], constructed in the past decade to bring water from the [[Yangtze River]] basin.\n\nThe urban area of Beijing, on the plains in the south-central of the municipality with elevation of {{convert|40|to(-)|60|m|ft|abbr=off}}, occupies a relatively small but expanding portion of the municipality's area. The city spreads out in concentric [[Ring Roads of Beijing|ring roads]].  The [[Second Ring Road (Beijing)|Second Ring Road]] traces the [[Beijing city wall|old city walls]] and the [[Sixth Ring Road]] connects satellite towns in the surrounding suburbs. [[Tian'anmen]] and [[Tian'anmen Square]] are at the center of Beijing, directly to the south of the [[Forbidden City]], the former residence of the emperors of China. To the west of Tian'anmen is [[Zhongnanhai]], the residence of China's current leaders. [[Chang'an Avenue]], which cuts between Tiananmen and the Square, forms the city's main east\u2013west axis.\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n{{wide image|The Forbidden City - View from Coal Hill.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|A panorama of the [[Forbidden City]], viewed from the [[Jingshan Park]]}}\n\n{{Wide image|File:Beijing skyline from northeast 4th ring road.jpg|800px|The skyline of eastern Beijing, including [[Beijing CBD]], [[Chaoyang Park]], and East [[5th Ring Road]] at dusk}}\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{See also|List of tallest buildings in Beijing}}\nThree styles of architecture are predominant in urban Beijing. First, there is the traditional architecture of imperial China, perhaps best exemplified by the massive [[Tian'anmen]] (Gate of Heavenly Peace), which remains the People's Republic of China's trademark edifice, the [[Forbidden City]], the [[Imperial Ancestral Temple]] and the [[Temple of Heaven]]. Next, there is what is sometimes referred to as the \"Sino-Sov\" style, with structures tending to be boxy and sometimes poorly constructed, which were built between the 1950s and the 1970s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Business Buide to Beijing and North-East China |edition=2006\u20132007 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=M2TvFN9DmqkC&pg=PA108&dq=%22sino-sov%22+%2Barchitecture |page=108 |isbn=978-988-98673-3-1 |year=2006 |publisher=China Briefing Media |location=Hong Kong |accessdate=22 July 2009}}</ref> Finally, there are much more modern architectural forms, most noticeably in the area of the [[Beijing CBD]] in east Beijing such as the new [[CCTV Headquarters]], in addition to buildings in other locations around the city such as the [[Beijing National Stadium]] and [[National Centre for the Performing Arts (China)|National Center for the Performing Arts]].\n\nSince 2007, buildings in Beijing have received the [[CTBUH Skyscraper Award]] for best overall tall building twice, for the [[Linked Hybrid]] building in 2009 and the [[CCTV Headquarters]] in 2013. The CTBUH Skyscraper award for best tall overall building is given to only one building around the world every year.\n\nIn the early 21st century, Beijing has witnessed tremendous growth of new building constructions, exhibiting various modern styles from international designers, most pronounced in the CBD region. A mixture of both 1950s design and [[neofuturistic]] style of architecture can be seen at the [[798 Art Zone]], which mixes the old with the new. Beijing's current completed tallest building is the 330-meter [[China World Trade Center Tower III]], but will be surpassed by the 528-meter [[China Zun]] in 2018 when it is completed. Both buildings are in the [[Beijing CBD]].\n\n[[File:Doujiao Hutong.jpg|thumb|The sign of Doujiao [[Hutong]], one of the many traditional alleyways in the inner city]]\nBeijing is famous for its ''[[siheyuan]]s'', a type of residence where a common courtyard is shared by the surrounding buildings. Among the more grand examples are the [[Prince Gong Mansion]] and [[Former Residence of Soong Ching-ling (Beijing)|Residence of Soong Ching-ling]]. These courtyards are usually connected by alleys called ''[[hutong]]s''. The ''hutongs'' are generally straight and run east to west so that doorways face north and south for good [[Feng Shui]].

Ten conventional rail lines radiate from the city to: [[Beijing-Shanghai Railway|Shanghai (Jinghu Line)]], [[Beijing\u2013Guangzhou Railway|Guangzhou (Jingguang Line)]], [[Beijing\u2013Kowloon Railway|Kowloon (Jingjiu Line)]], [[Beijing-Harbin Railway|Harbin (Jingha Line)]], [[Beijing-Baotou Railway|Baotou (Jingbao Line)]], [[Beijing-Qinhuangdao Railway|Qinhuangdao (Jingqin Line)]], [[Beijing\u2013Chengde Railway|Chengde (Jingcheng Line)]], [[Beijing\u2013Tongliao Railway|Tongliao, Inner Mongolia (Jingtong Line)]], [[Beijing\u2013Yuanping Railway|Yuanping, Shanxi (Jingyuan Line)]] and [[Fengtai\u2013Shacheng Railway|Shacheng, Hebei (Fengsha Line)]]. In addition, the [[Datong\u2013Qinhuangdao Railway]] passes through the municipality to the north of the city.\n\nBeijing also has three [[high-speed rail]] lines: the [[Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway]], which opened in 2008; the [[Beijing-Shanghai High-Speed Railway]], which opened in 2011; and the [[Beijing\u2013Guangzhou\u2013Shenzhen\u2013Hong Kong High-Speed Railway|Beijing\u2013Guangzhou High-Speed Railway]], which opened in 2012.\n\nThe city's main railway stations are the [[Beijing railway station]], which opened in 1959; the [[Beijing West railway station]], which opened in 1996; and the [[Beijing South railway station]], which was rebuilt into the city's high-speed railway station in 2008. {{as of|2010|July|1}}, Beijing railway station had 173 trains arriving daily, Beijing West had 232 trains and Beijing South had 163. The [[Beijing North railway station]], first built in 1909 and expanded in 2009, had 22 trains.\n\nSmaller stations in the city including [[Beijing East railway station]] handle mainly commuter passenger traffic. The [[Fengtai railway station]] has been closed for renovation. In outlying suburbs and counties of Beijing, there are over 40 railway stations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oklx.com/cn/train/province/1753ac4e025e.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060330191134/http://www.oklx.com/cn/train/province/1753ac4e025e.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 March 2006 |script-title=zh:\u5317\u4eac\u5e02\u706b\u8f66\u7ad9\u5927\u5168 |website=oklx.com |accessdate=8 August 2011 }}</ref>\n\nFrom Beijing, [[Passenger rail transport in China|direct passenger train service]] is available to most large cities in China. International train service is available to [[Mongolia]], Russia, [[Vietnam]] and [[North Korea]]. Passenger trains in China are numbered according to their [[railroad direction|direction]] in relation to Beijing.\n\n=== Roads and expressways ===\n{{further|Expressways of Beijing|China National Highways of Beijing}}\nBeijing is connected by road links to all parts of China as part of the National Trunk Road Network. Nine [[expressways of China]] serve Beijing, as do eleven [[China National Highway]]s. Beijing's urban transport is dependent upon the five \"[[Ring Roads of Beijing|ring roads]]\" that concentrically surround the city, with the [[Forbidden City]] area marked as the geographical center for the ring roads. The ring roads appear more rectangular than ring-shaped. There is no official \"1st Ring Road\". The [[2nd Ring Road]] is located in the inner city. Ring roads tend to resemble [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]] progressively as they extend outwards, with the [[5th Ring Road|5th]] and [[6th Ring Road]]s being full-standard national expressways, linked to other roads only by interchanges. Expressways to other regions of China are generally accessible from the [[3rd Ring Road (Beijing)|3rd Ring Road]] outward. A final outer orbital, the [[G95 Capital Area Loop Expressway|Capital Area Loop Expressway (G95)]], was fully opened in 2018 and will extend into neighboring [[Tianjin]] and [[Hebei]].\n\nWithin the urban core, city streets generally follow the checkerboard pattern of the ancient capital. Many of Beijing's boulevards and streets with \"inner\" and \"outer\" are still named in relation to gates in the city wall, though most gates no longer stand. Traffic jams are a major concern. Even outside of rush hour, several roads still remain clogged with traffic.\n\nBeijing's urban design layout further exacerbates transportation problems.<ref>\n{{cite news |title=Beijingers spend lives on road as traffic congestion worsens |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-10/06/content_269518.htm |work=China Daily |publisher=Xinhua News Agency |date=6 October 2003 |accessdate=22 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724004854/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-10/06/content_269518.htm |archive-date=24 July 2009 |url-status=live  }}\n</ref> The authorities have introduced several bus lanes, which only public buses can use during rush hour.

Although the rise of motor traffic has created a great deal of congestion and bicycle use has declined, bicycles are still an important form of local transportation. Large numbers of cyclists can be seen on most roads in the city, and most of the main roads have dedicated [[bicycle lanes]]. Beijing is relatively flat, which makes cycling convenient.

Mountains to the north, northwest and west shield the city and northern China's agricultural heartland from the encroaching desert steppes. The northwestern part of the municipality, especially [[Yanqing County]] and [[Huairou District]], are dominated by the [[Jundu Mountains]], while the western part is framed by ''Xishan'' or the [[Western Hills]]. The [[Great Wall of China]] across the northern part of Beijing Municipality was built on the rugged topography to defend against nomadic incursions from the steppes. [[Mount Ling (Beijing)|Mount Dongling]], in the Western Hills and on the border with [[Hebei]], is the municipality's highest point, with an altitude of {{convert|2303|m}}.\n\nMajor rivers flowing through the municipality, including the [[Chaobai River|Chaobai]], [[Yongding River|Yongding]], [[Juma River (China)|Juma]], are all tributaries in the [[Hai River]] system, and flow in a southeasterly direction. The Miyun Reservoir, on the upper reaches of the Chaobai River, is the largest reservoir within the municipality. Beijing is also the northern terminus of the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] to [[Hangzhou]], which was built over 1,400 years ago as a transportation route, and the [[South\u2013North Water Transfer Project]], constructed in the past decade to bring water from the [[Yangtze River]] basin.\n\nThe urban area of Beijing, on the plains in the south-central of the municipality with elevation of {{convert|40|to(-)|60|m|ft|abbr=off}}, occupies a relatively small but expanding portion of the municipality's area. The city spreads out in concentric [[Ring Roads of Beijing|ring roads]].  The [[Second Ring Road (Beijing)|Second Ring Road]] traces the [[Beijing city wall|old city walls]] and the [[Sixth Ring Road]] connects satellite towns in the surrounding suburbs. [[Tian'anmen]] and [[Tian'anmen Square]] are at the center of Beijing, directly to the south of the [[Forbidden City]], the former residence of the emperors of China. To the west of Tian'anmen is [[Zhongnanhai]], the residence of China's current leaders. [[Chang'an Avenue]], which cuts between Tiananmen and the Square, forms the city's main east\u2013west axis.\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n{{wide image|The Forbidden City - View from Coal Hill.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|A panorama of the [[Forbidden City]], viewed from the [[Jingshan Park]]}}\n\n{{Wide image|File:Beijing skyline from northeast 4th ring road.jpg|800px|The skyline of eastern Beijing, including [[Beijing CBD]], [[Chaoyang Park]], and East [[5th Ring Road]] at dusk}}\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{See also|List of tallest buildings in Beijing}}\nThree styles of architecture are predominant in urban Beijing. First, there is the traditional architecture of imperial China, perhaps best exemplified by the massive [[Tian'anmen]] (Gate of Heavenly Peace), which remains the People's Republic of China's trademark edifice, the [[Forbidden City]], the [[Imperial Ancestral Temple]] and the [[Temple of Heaven]]. Next, there is what is sometimes referred to as the \"Sino-Sov\" style, with structures tending to be boxy and sometimes poorly constructed, which were built between the 1950s and the 1970s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Business Buide to Beijing and North-East China |edition=2006\u20132007 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=M2TvFN9DmqkC&pg=PA108&dq=%22sino-sov%22+%2Barchitecture |page=108 |isbn=978-988-98673-3-1 |year=2006 |publisher=China Briefing Media |location=Hong Kong |accessdate=22 July 2009}}</ref> Finally, there are much more modern architectural forms, most noticeably in the area of the [[Beijing CBD]] in east Beijing such as the new [[CCTV Headquarters]], in addition to buildings in other locations around the city such as the [[Beijing National Stadium]] and [[National Centre for the Performing Arts (China)|National Center for the Performing Arts]].\n\nSince 2007, buildings in Beijing have received the [[CTBUH Skyscraper Award]] for best overall tall building twice, for the [[Linked Hybrid]] building in 2009 and the [[CCTV Headquarters]] in 2013. The CTBUH Skyscraper award for best tall overall building is given to only one building around the world every year.\n\nIn the early 21st century, Beijing has witnessed tremendous growth of new building constructions, exhibiting various modern styles from international designers, most pronounced in the CBD region. A mixture of both 1950s design and [[neofuturistic]] style of architecture can be seen at the [[798 Art Zone]], which mixes the old with the new. Beijing's current completed tallest building is the 330-meter [[China World Trade Center Tower III]], but will be surpassed by the 528-meter [[China Zun]] in 2018 when it is completed. Both buildings are in the [[Beijing CBD]].\n\n[[File:Doujiao Hutong.jpg|thumb|The sign of Doujiao [[Hutong]], one of the many traditional alleyways in the inner city]]\nBeijing is famous for its ''[[siheyuan]]s'', a type of residence where a common courtyard is shared by the surrounding buildings. Among the more grand examples are the [[Prince Gong Mansion]] and [[Former Residence of Soong Ching-ling (Beijing)|Residence of Soong Ching-ling]]. These courtyards are usually connected by alleys called ''[[hutong]]s''. The ''hutongs'' are generally straight and run east to west so that doorways face north and south for good [[Feng Shui]].

Ten conventional rail lines radiate from the city to: [[Beijing-Shanghai Railway|Shanghai (Jinghu Line)]], [[Beijing\u2013Guangzhou Railway|Guangzhou (Jingguang Line)]], [[Beijing\u2013Kowloon Railway|Kowloon (Jingjiu Line)]], [[Beijing-Harbin Railway|Harbin (Jingha Line)]], [[Beijing-Baotou Railway|Baotou (Jingbao Line)]], [[Beijing-Qinhuangdao Railway|Qinhuangdao (Jingqin Line)]], [[Beijing\u2013Chengde Railway|Chengde (Jingcheng Line)]], [[Beijing\u2013Tongliao Railway|Tongliao, Inner Mongolia (Jingtong Line)]], [[Beijing\u2013Yuanping Railway|Yuanping, Shanxi (Jingyuan Line)]] and [[Fengtai\u2013Shacheng Railway|Shacheng, Hebei (Fengsha Line)]]. In addition, the [[Datong\u2013Qinhuangdao Railway]] passes through the municipality to the north of the city.\n\nBeijing also has three [[high-speed rail]] lines: the [[Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway]], which opened in 2008; the [[Beijing-Shanghai High-Speed Railway]], which opened in 2011; and the [[Beijing\u2013Guangzhou\u2013Shenzhen\u2013Hong Kong High-Speed Railway|Beijing\u2013Guangzhou High-Speed Railway]], which opened in 2012.\n\nThe city's main railway stations are the [[Beijing railway station]], which opened in 1959; the [[Beijing West railway station]], which opened in 1996; and the [[Beijing South railway station]], which was rebuilt into the city's high-speed railway station in 2008. {{as of|2010|July|1}}, Beijing railway station had 173 trains arriving daily, Beijing West had 232 trains and Beijing South had 163. The [[Beijing North railway station]], first built in 1909 and expanded in 2009, had 22 trains.\n\nSmaller stations in the city including [[Beijing East railway station]] handle mainly commuter passenger traffic. The [[Fengtai railway station]] has been closed for renovation. In outlying suburbs and counties of Beijing, there are over 40 railway stations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oklx.com/cn/train/province/1753ac4e025e.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060330191134/http://www.oklx.com/cn/train/province/1753ac4e025e.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 March 2006 |script-title=zh:\u5317\u4eac\u5e02\u706b\u8f66\u7ad9\u5927\u5168 |website=oklx.com |accessdate=8 August 2011 }}</ref>\n\nFrom Beijing, [[Passenger rail transport in China|direct passenger train service]] is available to most large cities in China. International train service is available to [[Mongolia]], Russia, [[Vietnam]] and [[North Korea]]. Passenger trains in China are numbered according to their [[railroad direction|direction]] in relation to Beijing.\n\n=== Roads and expressways ===\n{{further|Expressways of Beijing|China National Highways of Beijing}}\nBeijing is connected by road links to all parts of China as part of the National Trunk Road Network. Nine [[expressways of China]] serve Beijing, as do eleven [[China National Highway]]s. Beijing's urban transport is dependent upon the five \"[[Ring Roads of Beijing|ring roads]]\" that concentrically surround the city, with the [[Forbidden City]] area marked as the geographical center for the ring roads. The ring roads appear more rectangular than ring-shaped. There is no official \"1st Ring Road\". The [[2nd Ring Road]] is located in the inner city. Ring roads tend to resemble [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]] progressively as they extend outwards, with the [[5th Ring Road|5th]] and [[6th Ring Road]]s being full-standard national expressways, linked to other roads only by interchanges. Expressways to other regions of China are generally accessible from the [[3rd Ring Road (Beijing)|3rd Ring Road]] outward. A final outer orbital, the [[G95 Capital Area Loop Expressway|Capital Area Loop Expressway (G95)]], was fully opened in 2018 and will extend into neighboring [[Tianjin]] and [[Hebei]].\n\nWithin the urban core, city streets generally follow the checkerboard pattern of the ancient capital. Many of Beijing's boulevards and streets with \"inner\" and \"outer\" are still named in relation to gates in the city wall, though most gates no longer stand. Traffic jams are a major concern. Even outside of rush hour, several roads still remain clogged with traffic.\n\nBeijing's urban design layout further exacerbates transportation problems.<ref>\n{{cite news |title=Beijingers spend lives on road as traffic congestion worsens |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-10/06/content_269518.htm |work=China Daily |publisher=Xinhua News Agency |date=6 October 2003 |accessdate=22 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724004854/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-10/06/content_269518.htm |archive-date=24 July 2009 |url-status=live  }}\n</ref> The authorities have introduced several bus lanes, which only public buses can use during rush hour.

Although the rise of motor traffic has created a great deal of congestion and bicycle use has declined, bicycles are still an important form of local transportation. Large numbers of cyclists can be seen on most roads in the city, and most of the main roads have dedicated [[bicycle lanes]]. Beijing is relatively flat, which makes cycling convenient.

The first church, a monastery dedicated to Saint Bartholomew, was built during the time of [[Trpimir I]] in the 9th century in Kapitul (south-east from Knin Castle, where the later bishopric was located).<ref>https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/140670</ref><ref>http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?id=62489</ref> It was later expanded or rebuilt by a certain Duke of Croatia, probably Svetoslav, during the reign of king [[Stephen Dr\u017eislav of Croatia]] in the 10th century.<ref>Nikola Jak\u0161i\u0107, [https://www.academia.edu/22968166/Knin-_hrvatska_srednjovjekovna_prijestolnica_Split_1995 Knin- hrvatska srednjovjekovna prijestolnica, Split 1995] pp. 7</ref>\n\nKnin is first mentioned in the 10th-century work ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' as the centre of the Knin county ([[\u017eupanija]]), and as one of the populated towns in [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|Croatia]]. Around 1040, at the behest of the Croatian kings, a seat of the royal bishop was established in the nearby royal village of Biskupija (Kosovo), in the church of Saint Mary. The first \"bishop of the Croats\" is named ''Marko Giudice'', and he and his successors were attached to the royal court as preachers and king's \"special bishops\" until 1102.<ref>''[[Illyricum sacrum]]'', IV (Venice, 1775)</ref>{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=23}}\n\nIn the second half of the 11th century, Knin became a more permanent royal residence of king [[Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia|Demetrius Zvonimir]] around 1080.

At that point, it came into possession of the Hungarian [[Arpad dynasty]], and since then, it ceased to be a permanent royal residence but remained as a political and administrative center of the kingdom.

Due to the extinction of the local ruling dynasty, the Croatian bishop moved his see to Knin itself, after which he started calling himself the Bishop of Knin.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=28}} This precipitated the construction of a new cathedral, which was initiated in 1203 by the son of the Duke of Knin, Dobroslav in Kapitul.\n\nThe city was visited by Queen [[Maria Laskarina]], the daughter of the [[Byzantine Emperor]] and wife of king Bela IV, together with her retinue of nobles and a great number of soldiers in 1261 in order to introduce her son to the Croatian nobility and to negotiate their oath in recognizing him as the designated duke (herceg).{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=32}} In 1264, the first case of judicial function in the city was mentioned and during this time, Knin was the seat of both the Croatian ban, and the duke, who acted as a semi-independent ruler with close connection to the king and whose chancellor had been the bishop of Knin.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=33}} Between 1270 and 1272, the new cathedral was consecrated on the orders of the Knin bishop Nicholas.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1949}}<ref>Nikola Jak\u0161i\u0107, [https://www.academia.edu/22968166/Knin-_hrvatska_srednjovjekovna_prijestolnica_Split_1995 Knin- hrvatska srednjovjekovna prijestolnica, Split 1995] pp. 19</ref> The cathedral is described as being \"magnificent\" and \"solemn\" by subsequent documents.

According to the 19th century Franciscan friar and historian [[Donato Fabianich]], the monastery of [[St. Catharines|Saint Catherine]] was founded around this time by the Knin dignitaries and nobility which were first settled there by Mladen \u0160ubi\u0107.<ref>Donato Fabianich, Storia dei fratri minori dai primordi della joro istituzione in Dal\u00b7 mazia e Bossina, fino ai giorni nostri, I, Zadar 1863, pp. 94.</ref> Their rule over Knin came to an end at the [[Battle of Bliska]] in 1322, after which the Angevin king [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles Robert]] arrived in the city and imprisoned the former lord [[Mladen II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir]].{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=35}} Upon the departure of the king to Hungary, the noble [[Ivan Nelipi\u0107]] quickly seized Knin, and from there expelled the king's men from Croatia. Thus, these territories ''de facto'' continued to remain outside the monarchy, and the [[Nelipi\u0107 noble family]] made Knin their permanent seat and ruled their territories as \"Princes of Knin\".\n\nAfter successfully warring against their enemies, the Dalmatian cities and nobility under [[George II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir|Juraj II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir]] (who was imprisoned in the castle's dungeons), as well as the royal forces commanded by the [[Ban of Slavonia|Slavonian ban]] ''Mikac Prodani\u0107'',<ref>Miha Madijev, cap. XXIII.{{full citation needed|date=December 2016}}</ref> their rule came to an end when [[Louis I of Hungary]] personally led an army to re-establish royal power over Knin in 1345. During this time it became known that the castle consisted of two major parts, administered by two castellans and which was populated by houses and baths, a palace with a main hall used previously by the Nelipi\u0107's to sign an alliance with the [[Republic of Venice]] and to enforce customs on imports to the city.

There the noble Ivan Nelipi\u0107 (son of Vladislava) had reaffirmed his rights to the estates and lands in [[Cetina]] during his stay in the city.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|pp=52\u201353}}{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|pp=55\u201356}}\n[[File:StefatonKnin.png|thumb|right|250px|Stone slab of Knin Fortress depicting [[Stephaton]] thought to have originated from the Church of St. Stephen in the Knin's burg, 11th century]]\nUsing the dynastic instability in the neighboring lands, the city came into the hands of the Bosnian king [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko I]] during the year of 1388. The previous bishop had likely been expelled, where the [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] Mihailo took his place, and was also given the office of the king's chancellor. These actions provoked a retaliation of king [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], whose armies besieged Knin in September 1390. The city, along with other territories were returned to Sigismund in 1393. Upon his return from the disastrous [[battle of Nicopolis]] in 1396, the king spent a month in Knin to consolidate his holdings and state affairs of Dalmatia and Croatia, issuing various decrees together with his ban [[Nicholas II Garai|Nikola Gorjanski]].{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=60}} In 1401, the city was besieged by the Bosnian king [[Stephen Ostoja]], who encamped in the adjacent Knin field (Kninsko polje), and remained there until the following year. The newly crowned king [[Ladislaus of Naples]] attained support from the castellan of Knin and issued his first decree there in 1403.\n\nBecause of frequent harassment, the citizens of Knin had to pay tribute to the duke [[Hrvoje Vuk\u010di\u0107 Hrvatini\u0107]], and for a short while, the city seemed to have been directly under his rule. The presence of [[Franciscans]] is for the first time mentioned in the 15th century, which were located in the old Saint Mary's church and monastery in the city. Apart from them, other religious buildings are mentioned such as the church of the [[Holy Spirit]].<ref name=\"academia.edu\"/>\n\nIts strategic position played an important role in many wars and power changes \u2013 the Republic of Venice often reflected on its importance as a key castle and the main entrance to Dalmatia, which it attempted to obtain during the 15th century.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=64}} During these years both the city, the ban and his dignitaries played a crucial role in the struggle for dominance over the coastal cities with Venice. In 1430 Knin and the Church of St. Bartolomeo in Kapitul were the centre of the \"Union and Brotherhood of the Croats\" ({{lang-la|unio et fraternitas Croatorum}}), a congregation of [[Croatian nobility|Croatian nobles]] formed by 12 [[counties of Croatia]] in order to \"preserve the fame and old customs of the Croatian Kingdom\".<ref>Mladen An\u010di\u0107: \"Desetlje\u0107e od 1091. do 1102. u zrcalu vrela\" (Summary: The decade between 1091 and 1102 according to the sources), Povijesni prilozi 17/1998, p. 253</ref><ref>Damir Karbi\u0107: Hrvatski plemi\u0107ki rod i obi\u010dajno pravo, p. 109-111</ref>\n\nIt was in 1420 that the Nelipi\u0107 noble family again regained their former role in Croatia with the emergence of [[Ivani\u0161 Nelipi\u0107]], which again distanced these territories from the crown. These possessions were later acquired after Ivani\u0161's death in 1435 by [[Ivan Frankopan|An\u017e]] of the [[House of Frankopan]] through the marriage with the Nelipi\u0107 nobles. Knin and the surrounding possessions were restored to the crown upon An\u017e's death in 1437.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=68}} In 1454 an attempt between the Bosnian king and the Venetians was made to acquire the city, which was referenced as \"capital and foremost place of Croatia\" in their letters.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=72}}\n\nDuring the reign of king [[Matthias Corvinus]], the bishops of Knin were selected as the king's principal orators abroad in collecting the help needed against the invading [[Ottoman Empire]]. The bishop was thus first secretly involved at the [[pope]] to solicit financial aid for Matthias' military campaign. The city's distant surroundings quickly became a target for Ottoman raids. As the raids were becoming more frequent, one of them reached Knin, where a Franciscan monastery has been recorded to have been destroyed in 1469.\n\nIn 1493, the first direct attempt of siege by the Ottomans was undertaken, which was followed by ban [[John Corvinus]] and his deputies invading and pillaging the Ottoman territories from the city. The Republic of Venice started to financially support the city's defences in fear for its possessions in Dalmatia. In 1501, three Ottoman spies were caught and imprisoned by the vice-ban. They were sent by the [[Sanjak of Bosnia|Sanjak-bey of Bosnia]], and had infiltrated Knin posing as friars that were on their way to sell [[vestment]]s to the market. They were to investigate the situation in the Zadar surrounding.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=82}}\n\n[[File:KninPagano1525.png|thumb|right|280px|Knin castle, settlement and Kapitul around 1525, after Ottoman conquest from the map of Dalmatia from [[Matteo Pagano]]]]\nThe last major conflict around Knin before the truce was in September 1502 when 2,000 Ottoman cavalrymen looted the area.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=84}} On 20 August 1503 King [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislaus II]] concluded a 7-year peace treaty with Sultan [[Bayezid II]]. The armistice was generally respected by all sides,<ref>[[Ive Ma\u017euran]]: Povijest Hrvatske od 15. stolje\u0107a do 18. stolje\u0107a, p. 44-45</ref> during which Knin's defensive positions were strengthened in 1504. A period of severe famine started in 1505 that affected entire Dalmatia. In 1510 the plague halved Knin's population.\n\nIn 1510 around 1,000 Ottoman [[Ak\u0131nc\u0131]] raided the countryside of Knin. There had been word that viceban of Croatia was captured on that occasion.

Next year in February the Ottomans laid siege on Knin with 10,000 men from the Sanjak of Bosnia, but were unable to take the city and lost 500 troops. Knin's burg and outskirts were burned on this occasion.<ref>Vjekoslav Klai\u0107: Povijest Hrvata od najstarijih vremena do svr\u0161etka XIX. stolje\u0107a, Knjiga \u010detvrta, Zagreb, 1988, p. 302</ref>{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=88}} These clashes left Knin devastated and there was no news about the city for five years. Local population was decimated by war, hunger, plague and migration to safer places, and its economy was hindered by the seizure of crops and livestock. Due to Knin's strategic value, King [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] responded to requests from captains of Knin, Skradin and Ostrovica and promised reinforcements of 1,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalrymen. However, it is unlikely that these forces arrived to the endangered towns.\n\nOn May 29, 1522, [[Siege of Knin|after the final siege]] of the Knin castle, it fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]],{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=89}} and Croats left the town in large numbers.

After the [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Peace of Pressburg]] in 1805, the French Empire gained the city and incorporated it into the [[Illyrian Provinces]] in 1809. By 1813, the Austrians regained control over the town. By the end of the 19th century, as a part of the [[Habsburg]] domain of Dalmatia, Knin grew steadily, becoming an important commercial as well as road and railway center. In 1867, Knin became a part of [[Dalmatia]] \u2013 a territorial entity within [[Cisleithania]]. After the [[First World War]] Knin became a part of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] in 1918, which subsequently became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] ([[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] after 1929).\n\n===Modern===\n====World War II====\nIn [[World War II in Yugoslavia|World War II]], Knin was in the so-called [[Independent State of Croatia#Zones of influence|second Italian occupation zone]], administered by civilian authorities of collaborationist [[Independent State of Croatia]] led by fascist Ustasa regime, but with heavy [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Italian]] military presence. Italians also relied heavily on local ethnic Serb militias ([[Chetniks]]) to maintain order and surpress [[Yugoslav Partisans|partisan resistance]]. Chetniks and Ustasa officers collaborated as antifascist resistance intensified. Ustasa regime declared Knin [[Counties of the Independent State of Croatia|county seat]]. After [[Italian surrender]] in September 1943, German forces became the main factor in the region. As the war progressed and partisan forces liberated most of Dalmatia, with Germans pulling out and retreating northwards, Axis and partisan forces became pitted on Knin in a [[Battle of Knin|major battle]] in early December 1944. The [[8th Dalmatian Corps]] sought to destroy [[Nazi Germany|German]], [[Usta\u0161e]] and [[Chetniks|Chetnik]] formations in North [[Dalmatia]] and the city of Knin. With around 50 thousand troops involved and more than 7 thousand casulties on both sides, it was a decisive partisan victory. Knin was liberated on December 9th.\n\n====Socialist Yugoslavia====\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nBetween 1945 and 1990, Knin saw rapid industrialization and modernization, becoming a centre of a wider region.

As a consequence, ethnic/religious composition of town changed as well.

NK Dinara's colours were black and white until 2005 when the club changed its colours to red, white and blue. NK Dinara plays in the 4th division in Croatia ([[1. \u017dupanijska liga \u0160ibensko-kninska]]). The logo of NK Dinara is red, white, and blue (in that order) with the letter \"D\" in the middle of the logo.\n\nKnin has a sports association which was formed in 1998. [[Basketball]] is also popular in Knin. The Croatian National basketball team has played a match in Knin. They played against [[Israel]] in 1999 where Croatia won the match 78:68. Other sports played in Knin are [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[team handball|handball]], [[volleyball]], [[kickboxing]], [[karate]], [[tennis]]  and [[taekwondo]].\n\n==Transport==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\n[[File:Station Knin.JPG|thumb|right|Knin railway station building]]\nThe most important intercity roadway in Knin is the Croatian [[D1 (Croatia)|state route D1]]. The route makes for easy access of Knin from the major coastal city of [[Split (city)|Split]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} The section of D1 from Knin to [[A1 (Croatia)|A1]] highway will be upgraded to the expressway level in following years (with [[B1 (Croatia)|B1]] expressway).\n\nKnin is also an important railway junction as the railroads from the rest of Dalmatia and its cities of [[Zadar]], [[Split (city)|Split]] and [[\u0160ibenik railway station|\u0160ibenik]] pass through Knin, going north to the capital city of Croatia, [[Zagreb]], via [[M604 railway (Croatia)|M604 railway]]. There are four lines meeting in Knin station: to [[Perkovi\u0107, Croatia|Perkovi\u0107]] (and then to Split or [[\u0160ibenik railway station|\u0160ibenik]]), to Zadar, to [[Ogulin]] (and onwards to [[Karlovac]], Zagreb) and to [[Martin Brod]] (and [[Biha\u0107]], Sisak, Zagreb). Only the former three lines offer passenger transport. The latter route, Knin-Biha\u0107-Zagreb, passes through Bosnian territory, crossing the border many times, thus it is not used for passenger transport since the beginning of the war in 1991. However, it is the shortest route between Knin and Zagreb, and as such was electrified in 1984 (the [[overhead line|catenary]] being subsequently destroyed by war operations in the early 1990s). [[Railway electrification system|Electrification]] had started from [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] inland towards the coast and had only reached Knin, so today the Knin station sidings are equipped with overhead catenary, but lines leaving the town are not.\n[[File:\u017deljezni\u010dki-kolodvor-postaja-Knin-05082016-02-roberta-f.jpg|thumb|right|Knin railway station's platforms, notice the lack of catenary wires, and the presence of the poles only]]\n\n==Towns and villages in the municipality==\n\n*[[Golubi\u0107, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Golubi\u0107]]\n*Knin\n*[[Kninsko Polje]]\n*[[Kova\u010di\u0107, Croatia|Kova\u010di\u0107]]\n*[[Ljuba\u010d, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Ljuba\u010d]]\n*[[O\u0107estovo]]\n*[[Plavno, Croatia|Plavno]]\n*[[Pola\u010da, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Pola\u010da]]\n*[[Potkonje]]\n*[[Radljevac]]\n*[[Strmica, Croatia|Strmica]]\n*[[Vrpolje, Knin|Vrpolje]]\n*[[\u017dagrovi\u0107]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Croatia}}\n* [[Church of Saint Anthony, Knin]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite web|ref={{harvid|ICJ|3 February 2015}}|title=Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v.

Around 1040, at the behest of the Croatian kings, a seat of the royal bishop was established in the nearby royal village of Biskupija (Kosovo), in the church of Saint Mary.

According to the 19th century Franciscan friar and historian [[Donato Fabianich]], the monastery of [[St. Catharines|Saint Catherine]] was founded around this time by the Knin dignitaries and nobility which were first settled there by Mladen \u0160ubi\u0107.<ref>Donato Fabianich, Storia dei fratri minori dai primordi della joro istituzione in Dal\u00b7 mazia e Bossina, fino ai giorni nostri, I, Zadar 1863, pp. 94.</ref> Their rule over Knin came to an end at the [[Battle of Bliska]] in 1322, after which the Angevin king [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles Robert]] arrived in the city and imprisoned the former lord [[Mladen II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir]].{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=35}} Upon the departure of the king to Hungary, the noble [[Ivan Nelipi\u0107]] quickly seized Knin, and from there expelled the king's men from Croatia.

The previous bishop had likely been expelled, where the [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] Mihailo took his place, and was also given the office of the king's chancellor. These actions provoked a retaliation of king [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], whose armies besieged Knin in September 1390. The city, along with other territories were returned to Sigismund in 1393. Upon his return from the disastrous [[battle of Nicopolis]] in 1396, the king spent a month in Knin to consolidate his holdings and state affairs of Dalmatia and Croatia, issuing various decrees together with his ban [[Nicholas II Garai|Nikola Gorjanski]].{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=60}} In 1401, the city was besieged by the Bosnian king [[Stephen Ostoja]], who encamped in the adjacent Knin field (Kninsko polje), and remained there until the following year. The newly crowned king [[Ladislaus of Naples]] attained support from the castellan of Knin and issued his first decree there in 1403.\n\nBecause of frequent harassment, the citizens of Knin had to pay tribute to the duke [[Hrvoje Vuk\u010di\u0107 Hrvatini\u0107]], and for a short while, the city seemed to have been directly under his rule. The presence of [[Franciscans]] is for the first time mentioned in the 15th century, which were located in the old Saint Mary's church and monastery in the city. Apart from them, other religious buildings are mentioned such as the church of the [[Holy Spirit]].<ref name=\"academia.edu\"/>\n\nIts strategic position played an important role in many wars and power changes \u2013 the Republic of Venice often reflected on its importance as a key castle and the main entrance to Dalmatia, which it attempted to obtain during the 15th century.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=64}} During these years both the city, the ban and his dignitaries played a crucial role in the struggle for dominance over the coastal cities with Venice. In 1430 Knin and the Church of St. Bartolomeo in Kapitul were the centre of the \"Union and Brotherhood of the Croats\" ({{lang-la|unio et fraternitas Croatorum}}), a congregation of [[Croatian nobility|Croatian nobles]] formed by 12 [[counties of Croatia]] in order to \"preserve the fame and old customs of the Croatian Kingdom\".<ref>Mladen An\u010di\u0107: \"Desetlje\u0107e od 1091. do 1102. u zrcalu vrela\" (Summary: The decade between 1091 and 1102 according to the sources), Povijesni prilozi 17/1998, p. 253</ref><ref>Damir Karbi\u0107: Hrvatski plemi\u0107ki rod i obi\u010dajno pravo, p. 109-111</ref>\n\nIt was in 1420 that the Nelipi\u0107 noble family again regained their former role in Croatia with the emergence of [[Ivani\u0161 Nelipi\u0107]], which again distanced these territories from the crown. These possessions were later acquired after Ivani\u0161's death in 1435 by [[Ivan Frankopan|An\u017e]] of the [[House of Frankopan]] through the marriage with the Nelipi\u0107 nobles. Knin and the surrounding possessions were restored to the crown upon An\u017e's death in 1437.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=68}} In 1454 an attempt between the Bosnian king and the Venetians was made to acquire the city, which was referenced as \"capital and foremost place of Croatia\" in their letters.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=72}}\n\nDuring the reign of king [[Matthias Corvinus]], the bishops of Knin were selected as the king's principal orators abroad in collecting the help needed against the invading [[Ottoman Empire]]. The bishop was thus first secretly involved at the [[pope]] to solicit financial aid for Matthias' military campaign. The city's distant surroundings quickly became a target for Ottoman raids. As the raids were becoming more frequent, one of them reached Knin, where a Franciscan monastery has been recorded to have been destroyed in 1469.\n\nIn 1493, the first direct attempt of siege by the Ottomans was undertaken, which was followed by ban [[John Corvinus]] and his deputies invading and pillaging the Ottoman territories from the city. The Republic of Venice started to financially support the city's defences in fear for its possessions in Dalmatia. In 1501, three Ottoman spies were caught and imprisoned by the vice-ban. They were sent by the [[Sanjak of Bosnia|Sanjak-bey of Bosnia]], and had infiltrated Knin posing as friars that were on their way to sell [[vestment]]s to the market. They were to investigate the situation in the Zadar surrounding.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=82}}\n\n[[File:KninPagano1525.png|thumb|right|280px|Knin castle, settlement and Kapitul around 1525, after Ottoman conquest from the map of Dalmatia from [[Matteo Pagano]]]]\nThe last major conflict around Knin before the truce was in September 1502 when 2,000 Ottoman cavalrymen looted the area.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=84}} On 20 August 1503 King [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislaus II]] concluded a 7-year peace treaty with Sultan [[Bayezid II]].

A period of severe famine started in 1505 that affected entire Dalmatia. In 1510 the plague halved Knin's population.\n\nIn 1510 around 1,000 Ottoman [[Ak\u0131nc\u0131]] raided the countryside of Knin. There had been word that viceban of Croatia was captured on that occasion. Baltazar Ba\u0107an ({{lang-hu|Boldizs\u00e1r Batthy\u00e1ny}}), viceban of Slavonia, together with forces from the Zagreb Bishopry, managed to lift the siege of Knin in January 1513. Next year in February the Ottomans laid siege on Knin with 10,000 men from the Sanjak of Bosnia, but were unable to take the city and lost 500 troops. Knin's burg and outskirts were burned on this occasion.<ref>Vjekoslav Klai\u0107: Povijest Hrvata od najstarijih vremena do svr\u0161etka XIX. stolje\u0107a, Knjiga \u010detvrta, Zagreb, 1988, p. 302</ref>{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=88}} These clashes left Knin devastated and there was no news about the city for five years. Local population was decimated by war, hunger, plague and migration to safer places, and its economy was hindered by the seizure of crops and livestock. Due to Knin's strategic value, King [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] responded to requests from captains of Knin, Skradin and Ostrovica and promised reinforcements of 1,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalrymen. However, it is unlikely that these forces arrived to the endangered towns.\n\nOn May 29, 1522, [[Siege of Knin|after the final siege]] of the Knin castle, it fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]],{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=89}} and Croats left the town in large numbers.

After the [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Peace of Pressburg]] in 1805, the French Empire gained the city and incorporated it into the [[Illyrian Provinces]] in 1809. By 1813, the Austrians regained control over the town. By the end of the 19th century, as a part of the [[Habsburg]] domain of Dalmatia, Knin grew steadily, becoming an important commercial as well as road and railway center. In 1867, Knin became a part of [[Dalmatia]] \u2013 a territorial entity within [[Cisleithania]]. After the [[First World War]] Knin became a part of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] in 1918, which subsequently became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] ([[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] after 1929).\n\n===Modern===\n====World War II====\nIn [[World War II in Yugoslavia|World War II]], Knin was in the so-called [[Independent State of Croatia#Zones of influence|second Italian occupation zone]], administered by civilian authorities of collaborationist [[Independent State of Croatia]] led by fascist Ustasa regime, but with heavy [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Italian]] military presence. Italians also relied heavily on local ethnic Serb militias ([[Chetniks]]) to maintain order and surpress [[Yugoslav Partisans|partisan resistance]]. Chetniks and Ustasa officers collaborated as antifascist resistance intensified. Ustasa regime declared Knin [[Counties of the Independent State of Croatia|county seat]]. After [[Italian surrender]] in September 1943, German forces became the main factor in the region. As the war progressed and partisan forces liberated most of Dalmatia, with Germans pulling out and retreating northwards, Axis and partisan forces became pitted on Knin in a [[Battle of Knin|major battle]] in early December 1944. The [[8th Dalmatian Corps]] sought to destroy [[Nazi Germany|German]], [[Usta\u0161e]] and [[Chetniks|Chetnik]] formations in North [[Dalmatia]] and the city of Knin.

The January average temperature is about 4&nbsp;\u00b0C and in August is about 24&nbsp;\u00b0C\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Knin (1971\u20132000, extremes 1949\u20132017)\n|width = auto\n|metric first = Y\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high C = 20.5\n|Feb record high C = 22.3\n|Mar record high C = 27.6\n|Apr record high C = 29.2\n|May record high C = 34.2\n|Jun record high C = 39.3\n|Jul record high C = 40.9\n|Aug record high C = 42.3\n|Sep record high C = 37.4\n|Oct record high C = 31.6\n|Nov record high C = 27.6\n|Dec record high C = 21.6\n|year record high C = 42.3\n| Jan high C = 8.9\n| Feb high C = 10.4\n| Mar high C = 14.1\n| Apr high C = 17.4\n| May high C = 23.0\n| Jun high C = 26.6\n| Jul high C = 30.1\n| Aug high C = 30.3\n| Sep high C = 25.4\n| Oct high C = 19.9\n| Nov high C = 13.7\n| Dec high C = 9.9\n|year high C = 19.1\n|Jan mean C = 4.0\n|Feb mean C = 5.1\n|Mar mean C = 8.2\n|Apr mean C = 11.5\n|May mean C = 16.6\n|Jun mean C = 20.1\n|Jul mean C = 23.0\n|Aug mean C = 22.5\n|Sep mean C = 18.0\n|Oct mean C = 13.3\n|Nov mean C = 8.2\n|Dec mean C = 5.0\n|year mean C = 13.0\n| Jan low C = -0.2\n| Feb low C = 0.7\n| Mar low C = 3.3\n| Apr low C = 6.5\n| May low C = 10.6\n| Jun low C = 13.8\n| Jul low C = 16.2\n| Aug low C = 16.0\n| Sep low C = 12.2\n| Oct low C = 8.3\n| Nov low C = 3.8\n| Dec low C = 0.9\n|year low C = 7.7\n|Jan record low C = -18.3\n|Feb record low C = -18.4\n|Mar record low C = -14.0\n|Apr record low C = -4.1\n|May record low C = -0.4\n|Jun record low C = 4.3\n|Jul record low C = 8.1\n|Aug record low C = 6.8\n|Sep record low C = 1.0\n|Oct record low C = -3.3\n|Nov record low C = -8.5\n|Dec record low C = -15.4\n|year record low C = -18.4\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 75.9\n|Feb precipitation mm = 69.8\n|Mar precipitation mm = 74.7\n|Apr precipitation mm = 92.0\n|May precipitation mm = 90.5\n|Jun precipitation mm = 81.1\n|Jul precipitation mm = 43.7\n|Aug precipitation mm = 61.7\n|Sep precipitation mm = 108.1\n|Oct precipitation mm = 114.3\n|Nov precipitation mm = 112.3\n|Dec precipitation mm = 101.7\n|year precipitation mm = 1025.8\n|unit precipitation days = 0.1 mm\n| Jan precipitation days = 10.7\n| Feb precipitation days = 9.2\n| Mar precipitation days = 9.6\n| Apr precipitation days = 11.8\n| May precipitation days = 11.4\n| Jun precipitation days = 10.8\n| Jul precipitation days = 6.4\n| Aug precipitation days = 7.1\n| Sep precipitation days = 8.8\n| Oct precipitation days = 10.5\n| Nov precipitation days = 11.0\n| Dec precipitation days = 11.0\n|year precipitation days = 118.4\n|unit snow days = 1.0 cm\n|Jan snow days = 1.3\n|Feb snow days = 1.2\n|Mar snow days = 0.2\n|Apr snow days = 0.0\n|May snow days = 0.0\n|Jun snow days = 0.0\n|Jul snow days = 0.0\n|Aug snow days = 0.0\n|Sep snow days = 0.0\n|Oct snow days = 0.0\n|Nov snow days = 0.3\n|Dec snow days = 0.5\n|year snow days = 3.5\n|Jan humidity = 69.0\n|Feb humidity = 63.5\n|Mar humidity = 62.2\n|Apr humidity = 63.1\n|May humidity = 63.6\n|Jun humidity = 62.1\n|Jul humidity = 56.1\n|Aug humidity = 58.3\n|Sep humidity = 65.8\n|Oct humidity = 69.2\n|Nov humidity = 70.1\n|Dec humidity = 70.3\n|year humidity = 64.4\n|Jan sun = 120.9\n|Feb sun = 146.9\n|Mar sun = 182.9\n|Apr sun = 189.0\n|May sun = 244.9\n|Jun sun = 270.0\n|Jul sun = 325.5\n|Aug sun = 297.6\n|Sep sun = 234.0\n|Oct sun = 182.9\n|Nov sun = 123.0\n|Dec sun = 108.5\n|year sun =\n| source 1 = [[Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service]]<ref name= DHMZ >{{cite web\n| url = http://klima.hr/k1/k1_2/knin.pdf\n| title = Knin Climate Normals\n| accessdate = 3 December 2015\n| publisher = Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service}}</ref><ref name=monthlyvalues>{{cite web\n| url = http://klima.hr/klima.php?id=k1&param=srednjak&Grad=knin\n| title = Mjese\u010dne vrijednosti za Knin u razdoblju 1949\u22122014\n| language = Croatian\n| accessdate = 3 December 2015\n| publisher = Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service}}</ref>\n|date=August 2014}}\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Knin population.png|thumb|Knin population 1857-2018]]\n[[File:Knin i Dinara.jpg|thumb|right|View of Knin and the [[Dinara]] mountain]]\n[[File:Kninska crkva u izgradnji.JPG|thumb|Our Lady of the Great Croatian Baptismal Vow church]]\n[[File:Arhitektura Bizanta u Kninu.JPG|thumb|Serbian Orthodox church in Knin]]\n\n[[Croatian Bureau of Statistics]] estimated the population of Knin municipality on December 31, 2018 to stand at 11,590.<ref>[https://www.dzs.hr/Hrv_Eng/Pokazatelji/Gradovi%20u%20statistici.xlsx Gradovi u statistici], Croatian Bureau of Statistics, published on 31/10/2019</ref> This represents a steep decline: just seven years earlier, in the [[2011 Census of Croatia|2011 census]], Knin municipality had a population of 15,388, while Knin (town) had a population of 10,493.<ref name=\"census2011\"/> In the 2001 census, the population of Knin was 15,190 (whole municipality) with 11,128 in town proper.

NK Dinara's colours were black and white until 2005 when the club changed its colours to red, white and blue. NK Dinara plays in the 4th division in Croatia ([[1. \u017dupanijska liga \u0160ibensko-kninska]]). The logo of NK Dinara is red, white, and blue (in that order) with the letter \"D\" in the middle of the logo.\n\nKnin has a sports association which was formed in 1998. [[Basketball]] is also popular in Knin. The Croatian National basketball team has played a match in Knin. They played against [[Israel]] in 1999 where Croatia won the match 78:68. Other sports played in Knin are [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[team handball|handball]], [[volleyball]], [[kickboxing]], [[karate]], [[tennis]]  and [[taekwondo]].\n\n==Transport==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\n[[File:Station Knin.JPG|thumb|right|Knin railway station building]]\nThe most important intercity roadway in Knin is the Croatian [[D1 (Croatia)|state route D1]]. The route makes for easy access of Knin from the major coastal city of [[Split (city)|Split]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} The section of D1 from Knin to [[A1 (Croatia)|A1]] highway will be upgraded to the expressway level in following years (with [[B1 (Croatia)|B1]] expressway).\n\nKnin is also an important railway junction as the railroads from the rest of Dalmatia and its cities of [[Zadar]], [[Split (city)|Split]] and [[\u0160ibenik railway station|\u0160ibenik]] pass through Knin, going north to the capital city of Croatia, [[Zagreb]], via [[M604 railway (Croatia)|M604 railway]]. There are four lines meeting in Knin station: to [[Perkovi\u0107, Croatia|Perkovi\u0107]] (and then to Split or [[\u0160ibenik railway station|\u0160ibenik]]), to Zadar, to [[Ogulin]] (and onwards to [[Karlovac]], Zagreb) and to [[Martin Brod]] (and [[Biha\u0107]], Sisak, Zagreb). Only the former three lines offer passenger transport. The latter route, Knin-Biha\u0107-Zagreb, passes through Bosnian territory, crossing the border many times, thus it is not used for passenger transport since the beginning of the war in 1991.

The school had maintained its own campus, faculty, and degree program since 1869, and it has become more ecumenical beginning in the mid-19th century. Since the 1970s, it has been affiliated with the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] [[Berkeley Divinity School]] and has housed the [[Yale Institute of Sacred Music|Institute of Sacred Music]], which offers separate degree programs. In July 2017, a two-year process of formal affiliation was completed, with the addition of [[Andover Newton Seminary at Yale Divinity School|Andover Newton Seminary]] joining the school.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Divinity College at Yale before 1870, Memories of Yale life and men, 1854-1899 (1903).jpg|thumb|200px|The Divinity College dormitory on the [[Old Campus (Yale University)|Old Campus]], completed in 1836]]\nTheological education was the earliest academic purpose of Yale University. When [[Yale College]] was founded in 1701, it was as a college of religious training for [[Congregationalist]] ministers in [[Connecticut Colony]], designated in its charter as a school \"wherein Youth may be instructed in the Arts & Sciences who through the blessing of Almighty God may be fitted for Publick employment both in Church & Civil State.\"  A professorship of divinity was established in 1746. In 1817, the occupant of the divinity chair, [[Eleazar Thompson Fitch]], supported a student request to endow a theological curriculum, and five years later a separate {{nowrap|'''Yale Theological Seminary'''}}<ref>{{citation |title=History of Higher Education Annual: 1997 |p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=vgQaGJt9OTQC&pg=PA94 94] }}.</ref> was founded by the [[Yale Corporation]].<ref name=\"Catalogue\">{{cite book |title=A General Catalogue of the Divinity School of Yale College: A Brief Biographical Record of Its Members in The First Half Century of Its Existence as A Distinct Department |url=https://archive.org/details/generalcatalogue00yalerich |publisher=Tuttle, Morehouse, & Taylor |year=1873 |location=New Haven}}</ref> In the same motion, [[Second Great Awakening]] theologian [[Nathaniel William Taylor]] was appointed to become the first Dwight Professor of Didactic Theology.<ref name=\"YUL\">{{cite web |title=Yale Divinity School Milestones, 1822-2012 |publisher=Yale University Library |date=23 October 2012 |url=http://divinity-adhoc.library.yale.edu/Exhibits/YDSMilestones.htm |accessdate=16 November 2015}}</ref> Taylor was considered the \"central figure\" in the school's founding, and he was joined in 1826 by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs, Sr.]], a scholar of sacred languages and lexicographer [[Chauncey A.

While Berkeley retains its [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] connection, its students are admitted by and fully enrolled as members of Yale Divinity School. [[The Jonathan Edwards Center at Yale University]], a division of the Divinity School, maintains a large collection of primary source materials about [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]], a 1720 Yale alumnus. The Yale Institute of Sacred Music (ISM) is jointly-affiliated with the Divinity School and School of Music. It offers programs in choral conducting, organ performance, voice, and church music studies, and in liturgical studies and religion and the arts.\n\nIn May 2016, [[Andover Newton Theological School]] president [[Martin Copenhaver]] announced that Andover Newton would begin a process of formal affiliation with the Divinity School over the next two years. In the 2016\u201317 academic year, a cohort of faculty relocated to New Haven teaching students and launching pilot initiatives focused on congregational ministry education, while Andover Newton continued to operate in Massachusetts over the next two years. In July 2017, a formal affiliation was signed, resulting in smaller Andover Newton functioning as a unit within Yale Divinity School, similar to its arrangement with Berkeley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://divinity.yale.edu/news/yds-and-andover-newton-sign-historic-agreement|title=YDS and Andover Newton sign historic agreement|date=July 20, 2017|website=Yale Divinity School}}</ref>\n\n== Leadership ==\n[[Gregory E.

The school had maintained its own campus, faculty, and degree program since 1869, and it has become more ecumenical beginning in the mid-19th century. Since the 1970s, it has been affiliated with the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] [[Berkeley Divinity School]] and has housed the [[Yale Institute of Sacred Music|Institute of Sacred Music]], which offers separate degree programs. In July 2017, a two-year process of formal affiliation was completed, with the addition of [[Andover Newton Seminary at Yale Divinity School|Andover Newton Seminary]] joining the school.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Divinity College at Yale before 1870, Memories of Yale life and men, 1854-1899 (1903).jpg|thumb|200px|The Divinity College dormitory on the [[Old Campus (Yale University)|Old Campus]], completed in 1836]]\nTheological education was the earliest academic purpose of Yale University. When [[Yale College]] was founded in 1701, it was as a college of religious training for [[Congregationalist]] ministers in [[Connecticut Colony]], designated in its charter as a school \"wherein Youth may be instructed in the Arts & Sciences who through the blessing of Almighty God may be fitted for Publick employment both in Church & Civil State.\"  A professorship of divinity was established in 1746. In 1817, the occupant of the divinity chair, [[Eleazar Thompson Fitch]], supported a student request to endow a theological curriculum, and five years later a separate {{nowrap|'''Yale Theological Seminary'''}}<ref>{{citation |title=History of Higher Education Annual: 1997 |p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=vgQaGJt9OTQC&pg=PA94 94] }}.</ref> was founded by the [[Yale Corporation]].<ref name=\"Catalogue\">{{cite book |title=A General Catalogue of the Divinity School of Yale College: A Brief Biographical Record of Its Members in The First Half Century of Its Existence as A Distinct Department |url=https://archive.org/details/generalcatalogue00yalerich |publisher=Tuttle, Morehouse, & Taylor |year=1873 |location=New Haven}}</ref> In the same motion, [[Second Great Awakening]] theologian [[Nathaniel William Taylor]] was appointed to become the first Dwight Professor of Didactic Theology.<ref name=\"YUL\">{{cite web |title=Yale Divinity School Milestones, 1822-2012 |publisher=Yale University Library |date=23 October 2012 |url=http://divinity-adhoc.library.yale.edu/Exhibits/YDSMilestones.htm |accessdate=16 November 2015}}</ref> Taylor was considered the \"central figure\" in the school's founding, and he was joined in 1826 by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs, Sr.]], a scholar of sacred languages and lexicographer [[Chauncey A.

While Berkeley retains its [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] connection, its students are admitted by and fully enrolled as members of Yale Divinity School. [[The Jonathan Edwards Center at Yale University]], a division of the Divinity School, maintains a large collection of primary source materials about [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]], a 1720 Yale alumnus. The Yale Institute of Sacred Music (ISM) is jointly-affiliated with the Divinity School and School of Music. It offers programs in choral conducting, organ performance, voice, and church music studies, and in liturgical studies and religion and the arts.\n\nIn May 2016, [[Andover Newton Theological School]] president [[Martin Copenhaver]] announced that Andover Newton would begin a process of formal affiliation with the Divinity School over the next two years. In the 2016\u201317 academic year, a cohort of faculty relocated to New Haven teaching students and launching pilot initiatives focused on congregational ministry education, while Andover Newton continued to operate in Massachusetts over the next two years. In July 2017, a formal affiliation was signed, resulting in smaller Andover Newton functioning as a unit within Yale Divinity School, similar to its arrangement with Berkeley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://divinity.yale.edu/news/yds-and-andover-newton-sign-historic-agreement|title=YDS and Andover Newton sign historic agreement|date=July 20, 2017|website=Yale Divinity School}}</ref>\n\n== Leadership ==\n[[Gregory E.
