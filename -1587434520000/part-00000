As a result, they support a variety of environmental programs which are part of the Sierra Club, the most prominent recipient of the foundation\u2019s grants. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.https://www.sierraclubfoundation.org/about-scf/our-values/mission |title=Mission: The Sierra Club Foundation}}</ref> \n\nEstablished in 1960, the Sierra Club Foundation originally focused more on political involvement with the intent to protect lands and natural resources through legislative activity, but with advisement from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the organization became the separate fiscal sponsor of the Sierra Club in 1966 in order to assure tax-deductibility to its donors. Some environmental victories that the Sierra Club Foundation has supported included successfully persuading the Carter administration in 1977 to support a gas pipeline route in Alaska that avoided the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as well as their 2015 advocacy which convinced the Obama administration to increase U.S. leadership at the Paris Climate Summit. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sierraclubfoundation.org/about-scf/our-values/history |title=History: The Sierra Club Foundation}}</ref>\n\nToday, the Sierra Club Foundation works with individual and institutional donors to increase financial support for many non-profit programs with the goal of maximizing support for their environmental campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sierraclubfoundation.org/about-scf |title=About the Sierra Club Foundation}}</ref>\n\n\n{{Portal|Environment|Ecology|Earth_sciences|Energy}}\n*[[Sustainability]]\n*[[Biodiversity]]\n*[[Global warming]]\n*[[Ecology]]\n*[[Ecosystem]]\n*[[Earth Science]]\n*[[Natural environment]]\n*[[Nature]]\n*[[Conservation Movement]]\n*[[Conservation ethic]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://sierraclubfoundation.org/ The Sierra Club Foundation] - Official website\n*[http://www.sierraclub.org/ The Sierra Club] - Official website\n\n[[Category:Sierra Club]]\n[[Category:Conservation and environmental foundations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1960]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Non-profit organisation in the USA}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{notability|Companies|date=January 2013}}\n{{more citations needed|date=June 2016}}\n}}\n{{Infobox organization\n|name           = Sierra Club Foundation\n|image          = tscflogo.jpg\n|size           = 100px\n|motto          = Explore, enjoy and protect the planet\n|formation      = 1960\n|headquarters   = [[San Francisco]], [[California|CA]],  [[United States|USA]]\n|leader_title   = Executive Director\n|leader_name    = Peter Martin\n|website        = {{URL|http://www.tscf.org}}\n}}\n\n'''The Sierra Club Foundation''' is an American environmental nonprofit.

This can be done through the use of the [[soundtrack]], [[camera]] angles, heavy [[shadows]], and surprising [[plot twist]]s. [[Alfred Hitchcock]] used all of these techniques, but would sometimes allow the audience in on a pending [[threat]] then draw out the moment for dramatic effect.\n\nThis genre has ranged from early mystery tales, fictional or literary detective stories, to classic Hitchcockian suspense-[[thriller film|thrillers]] to classic private detective films. A related film subgenre is [[spy films]].<ref>[http://www.filmsite.org/mysteryfilms.html Detective-Mystery Films]</ref>\n\n==Definition and characteristics==\n[[File:Jeremy Brett.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jeremy Brett]] as Sherlock Holmes from the [[Granada TV]] television series (1984-1994).]]\nMystery films mainly focus on solving a [[crime]] or a [[puzzle]]. The mystery generally revolves around a [[murder]] which must then be solved by [[policemen]], private [[detectives]], or amateur sleuths. The viewer is presented with a series of likely [[suspect]]s, some of whom are \"[[red herring]]s,\" \u2013persons who have the motive to commit the crime but did not actually do it\u2013, and attempts to solve the puzzle along with the investigator. At times the viewer is presented with information not available to the main character. The central character usually explores the unsolved crime, unmasks the perpetrator, and puts an end to the effects of the villainy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allrovi.com/movies/genre/mystery-d651 |title=Mystery Movies and Films |accessdate=2012-01-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117062845/http://www.allrovi.com/movies/genre/mystery-d651 |archivedate=2012-01-17 }}</ref>\n\nThe successful mystery film adheres to one of two story types, known as Open and Closed. The Closed (or [[whodunit]]) mystery conceals the identity of the perpetrator until late in the story, adding an element of [[suspense]] during the apprehension of the [[suspect]], as the audience is never quite sure who it is. The Open mystery, in contrast, reveals the identity of the perpetrator at the top of the story, showcasing the \"[[perfect crime]]\" which the audience then watches the [[protagonist]] unravel, usually at the very end of the story, akin to the unveiling scenes in the Closed style.\n\nMystery novels have proven to be a good medium for translation into film. The [[Detective|sleuth]] often forms a strong leading character, and the plots can include elements of drama, suspense, character development, uncertainty, and surprise twists. The locales of the mystery tale are often of a mundane variety, requiring little in the way of expensive special effects. Successful mystery writers can produce a series of books based on the same sleuth character, providing rich material for sequels.\n\nUntil at least the [[1980s in film|1980s]], women in mystery films have often served a dual role, providing a relationship with the [[detective]] and frequently playing the part of woman-in-peril. The women in these films are often resourceful individuals, being self-reliant, determined and as often duplicitous. They can provide the triggers for the events that follow or serve as an element of suspense as helpless victims.\n\n==History==\n\n===Literary influences===\n[[File:A Study in Scarlet from Beeton's Christmas Annual 1887.jpg|thumb|upright|The first appearance of Holmes, 1887]]\nThe earliest mystery films reach back to the [[silent film|silent era]]. The first detective film is often cited as ''[[Sherlock Holmes Baffled]]'', a very short [[Mutoscope]] reel created between 1900 and 1903 by [[Arthur Marvin]]. It is the [[Adaptations of Sherlock Holmes#Film|earliest-known film]] to feature the character of detective [[Sherlock Holmes]], albeit in a barely recognisable form.<ref>[http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/h/holmes.htm International Hero.co.uk], URL accessed January 28, 2010</ref><ref name=Tuska>Jon Tuska, ''The detective in Hollywood'' (Doubleday, 1978), p.1</ref><ref name=Harmon>[[Jim Harmon]], ''Radio Mystery and Adventure and Its Appearances in Film, Television and Other Media'' (McFarland, 2003), p.176</ref>\n\nIn France, the popular [[Nick Carter (literary character)|Nick Carter]] detective novels inspired the first [[film serial]], ''[[Nick Carter, le roi des d\u00e9tectives]]'' (1908). This six-episode series was followed with ''Nouveaux aventures de Nick Carter'' in 1909. [[Louis Feuillade]] created the highly popular [[Fant\u00f4mas]] (1913\u201314) serial based on the best-selling serial novel about a super-criminal pursued by a stubborn inspector Juve. [[Dujardin]] wears a mask and costume similar to Fantomas' in an apparent tribute in ''[[The Artist (film)|The Artist]]'', a nostalgic 2011 film about silent cinema. Later detective serials by Feuillade include ''[[Les vampires|The Vampires]]'' (1915), ''[[Judex (1916 film)|Judex]]'' (1916), ''[[Tih Minh]]'' (1918), and ''[[Barrabas (film)|Barrabas]]'' (1919). Feuillade's films, which combined realism, poetic imagery, and pure fantasy, influenced the American ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|The Perils of Pauline]]'' (1914), directors such as [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]], and [[Surrealism|Surrealists]] such as [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]].\n\nThe earliest true mystery films include ''The Gold Bug'' (1910), also from France, and ''The Murders in the Rue Morgue'' (1914). Both are derived from stories by [[Edgar Allan Poe]], which is appropriate as Poe is often credited with creating modern [[detective fiction]] as well as the first private detective character, [[C. Auguste Dupin]]. [[Universal Pictures]] renamed him Pierre Dupin in ''[[Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932 film)|Murders in the Rue Morgue]]'' (1932), an atmospheric horror-mystery starring [[Bela Lugosi]]. The film was remade twice more in 1953 and 1971. Poe's second Dupin story, ''[[The Mystery of Marie Rog\u00eat]]'', was filmed in 1942. More recently, ''[[The Raven (2012 film)|The Raven]]'' (2012) presented a fictionalized account of the last days of Poe's life. Here, the author pursues a mysterious serial killer whose murders are directly inspired by his stories.\n\n[[Charles Dickens]]' unfinished novel ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]'' (1870) was completed by another author and eventually adapted to the screen. Two films, now believed lost, were made in 1909 and 1914. Universal produced ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood (1935 film)|The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]'' (1935). The story was remade again in 1993. Universal, known mostly for its long list of classic horror films, also created perhaps the first [[supernatural]] horror-whodunit hybrid with ''[[Night Monster]]'' (1942).\n\nAmerican author [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]] (1876\u20131958), is credited with inventing the \"[[Had I but known|Had-I-But-Known]]\" school of mystery writing (as well as the phrase, \"The butler did it\"). Her 1920 \"old dark house\" novel (and play) ''The Bat'' was filmed as ''[[The Bat (1926 film)|The Bat]]'' (1926), as ''[[The Bat Whispers]]'' (1930), and a third time a remake, ''[[The Bat (1959 film)|The Bat]]'' (1959), starring [[Vincent Price]]. Another movie based on a play, ''[[The Cat and the Canary (1927 film)|The Cat and the Canary]]'' (1927), pioneered the \"comedy-mystery\" genre. Remade several times, including a version with [[Bob Hope]] released in 1939.\n\nUndoubtedly the most famous of the amateur detectives to appear on the silver screen is the archetypal [[Sherlock Holmes]]. Since 1903 Holmes has been portrayed by a multitude of actors in over 200 films. Perhaps the earliest detective comedy is [[Buster Keaton]]'s ''[[Sherlock Jr.]]'' (1924). Until recently, the only American-made series starred [[Basil Rathbone]] and [[Nigel Bruce]] as Holmes and Dr. Watson. Together they made 14 films between 1939 and 1946. The first two, at [[20th Century Fox]], were period piece mysteries set in the late-[[Victorian era]] of the original stories. By the third film, ''[[Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror]]'' (1942), now taken up by [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]], Holmes was updated to the present day. Several films dealt with World War II and thwarting Nazi spies.\n\nThe crime novelist [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] (1893\u20131957) created the archetypal British aristocratic sleuth [[Lord Peter Wimsey]] in 1923. Peter Haddon first played Wimsey in ''[[The Silent Passenger]]'' (1935), written by Sayers specifically for the screen. This was followed by ''[[Busman's Honeymoon (film)|Busman's Honeymoon]]'' (1940), also released as ''Haunted Honeymoon'', with [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]] as Wimsey. Later, Montgomery would also play [[Raymond Chandler]]'s detective [[Philip Marlowe]] in ''[[The Lady in the Lake]]'' (1947).\n\nDoubleday's [[The Crime Club]] imprint published a variety of mystery novels that also inspired a radio show. Universal Pictures struck a deal to produce a series of 11 Crime Club mystery films released from 1937 to 1939. These include ''The Westlake Case'' (1937) and ''Mystery of the White Room'' (1939).\n\nOther literary sleuths who were brought to the screen include [[Charlie Chan]], [[Ellery Queen]], [[Nancy Drew]], [[Nero Wolfe]], and [[Agatha Christie]]'s [[Miss Marple]] and [[Hercule Poirot]]. To date, 32 films and dozens of television adaptations have been made based\n\n===Classic period: the 1930s===\n\nA few silent [[Charlie Chan]] films, now lost, were produced in the 1920s. Starting in 1929, the B-picture unit at [[Fox Film Corporation]] (later part of [[20th Century Fox]]) began a series of 28 commercially successful Charlie Chan films. ([[Monogram Pictures]] continued the series from 1944 to 1949 with 17 more entries.) The success of the Chan films led Fox to hire <!-- Lorre's original nationality is a contentious point. -->exiled actor [[Peter Lorre]] to play Japanese sleuth [[Mr. Moto]] in 8 films from 1937 to 1939. Monogram responded by creating their own gentlemanly Oriental detective, Mr. Wong, adapted from a Hugh Wiley story. Beginning with ''[[Mr. Wong, Detective]]'', [[Boris Karloff]] played Wong in 5 of 6 films produced from 1938 to 1941.\n\nOver at [[Warner Brothers]] studios, the [[Perry Mason]] novels by [[Erle Stanley Gardner]] were faithfully adapted into a series of six films from 1934 to 1937. Most of these placed the crusading attorney in a standard murder mystery whodunit story. Warner Bros. also created the [[Torchy Blane]] films which were notable for featuring one of the few female sleuths in a series. Starting with ''Smart Blonde'', [[Glenda Farrell]] played the brassy, mystery-solving news reporter in 8 of 9 films made between 1936 and 1939. Another novel film is ''[[When Were You Born]]'' (1938) with Chinese actress [[Anna May Wong]] as an astrologer who helps solve a murder using her star-gazing talents.\n\n[[RKO Pictures|RKO]] purchased the rights to a [[Hildegarde Withers]] story by [[Stuart Palmer]] and launched a six-film series starting with ''[[The Penguin Pool Murder]]'' (1932). [[Edna May Oliver]] played Withers, a schoolteacher with a yen for sleuthing who becomes involved with a police inspector. The last film was released in 1937.\n\nThe [[Philo Vance]] detective novels by [[S. S. Van Dine]] inspired 15 feature films released from 1929 to 1947. ''[[The Canary Murder Case (film)|The Canary Murder Case]]'' (1929), starring [[William Powell]] as Vance, has been called the first modern detective film. Initially made as a silent movie, it was converted into a talkie halfway through production. (Co-star [[Louise Brooks]] was blacklisted by [[Paramount Pictures]] after famously refusing to return to Hollywood to dub her dialog.) Powell played the suave New York detective in the first three films. A pre-Sherlock Holmes [[Basil Rathbone]] played Vance in the 4th movie. Powell returned once more for the fifth feature, the highly regarded ''[[The Kennel Murder Case (film)|The Kennel Murder Case]]'' (1933) produced by Warner Brothers.\n\nPowell then landed his signature role playing the equally debonair [[Nick and Nora Charles|Nick Charles]] opposite [[Myrna Loy]] as his carefree wife \"Nora\" in the ''Thin Man'' series. Six films in all were produced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] from 1934 to 1947. Based on ''[[The Thin Man]]'' novel by [[Dashiell Hammett]], these were witty, sophisticated romps that combined elements of the [[screwball comedy film]] within a complex murder mystery plot. In the middle of this series, RKO hired Powell and [[Jean Arthur]] for ''[[The Ex-Mrs. Bradford]]'' (1936), a breezy comedy-mystery that successfully replicated MGM's ''Thin Man'' formula. Warner Brothers responded with a similar comedy, ''[[Footsteps in the Dark]]'' (1941), with [[Errol Flynn]] playing a married stockbroker who leads a double life as a mystery writer/sleuth.\n\nMany of the films of this period, including the ''Thin Man'' series, concluded with an explanatory [[detective d\u00e9nouement]] that quickly became a cinematic (and literary) cliche. With the suspects gathered together, the detective would dramatically announce that \"The killer is in this very room!\" before going over the various clues that revealed the identity of the murderer.\n\nThere were also a great many low-budget \"old dark house\" mysteries based on a standard formula (a dark and stormy night, the reading of a will, secret passageways, a series of bizarre murders, etc.) that were plot- rather than star-driven. Some typical examples are ''[[The Cat Creeps]]'' (1930), a remake of ''[[The Cat and the Canary (1927 film)|The Cat and the Canary]]'', ''[[The Monster Walks]]'' (1932), ''[[Night of Terror]]'' (1933) with [[Bela Lugosi]], and ''[[One Frightened Night]]'' (1935).\n\nThe 1930s was the era of the elegant [[gentleman detective]] who solved drawing-room whodunit murders using his wits rather than his fists. Most were well-to-do amateur sleuths who solved crimes for their own amusement, carried no weapons, and often had quirky or eccentric personality traits. This type of crime-fighter fell out of fashion in the 1940s as a new breed of tough, [[hardboiled]] professional private detectives based on the novels of Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, and an ensuing slew of imitators were adapted to film.\n\n===The 1940s\u20131950s===\n[[File:LonelyPlaceTrailer.jpg|thumb|190px|''[[In a Lonely Place]]'' (1950), independently produced by [[Humphrey Bogart]]. A cynical, psychological portrait of Hollywood.]]\nWith the onset of [[World War II]], crime films and melodramas in particular suddenly took on a dark mood of cynicism and despair that had not existed in the optimistic 1930s. Eventually, this cycle of films (which cuts across several genres) would be called [[film noir]] by French film critics. Pessimistic, unheroic stories about greed, lust, and cruelty became central to the mystery genre. Grim, violent films featuring cynical, trenchcoat-wearing private detectives who were almost as ruthless as the criminals they pursued became the industry standard. The wealthy, aristocratic sleuth of the previous decade was replaced by the rough-edged, working-class gumshoe. [[Humphrey Bogart]] became the definitive cinema shamus as [[Sam Spade]] in Hammett's ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941) and as [[Philip Marlowe]] in Chandler's ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]'' (1946). [[Dick Powell]] also made an indelible impression as Marlowe in the classic ''[[Murder, My Sweet]]'' (1944), adapted from Chandler's ''[[Farewell, My Lovely]]''. ''[[The Falcon Takes Over]]'' (1942), starring [[George Sanders]], was also based on the same novel.\n\n''[[Lady in the Lake]]'' (1947), from the Raymond Chandler novel, starred [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]], who also directed. This film was filmed entirely from Marlowe's viewpoint. The audience sees only what he does. Montgomery only appears on camera a few times, once in a mirror reflection. Another Chandler novel ''[[The High Window]]'' was made into the film ''[[The Brasher Doubloon]]'' (also 1947) starring [[George Montgomery (actor)|George Montgomery]]. This was essentially a remake of ''[[Time to Kill (1942 film)|Time to Kill]]'' (1942), a Michael Shayne adventure starring [[Lloyd Nolan]]. Chandler also wrote an original screenplay for ''[[The Blue Dahlia]]'' (1946) starring [[Alan Ladd]]. ''[[The Glass Key (1942 film)|The Glass Key]]'' (1942), also starring Ladd, was the second film adaptation of Hammett's novel.\n\nAnother standout film of this period is ''[[Out of the Past]]'' (1947) starring [[Robert Mitchum]], who would go on to play Philip Marlowe three decades later. [[Otto Preminger]]'s ''[[Laura (1944 film)|Laura]]'' (1944) is also a classic murder mystery featuring [[Dana Andrews]] as a lone-wolf police detective.\n\n[[Pulp novel]] detective Nick Carter returned in a trilogy of films released by MGM starring [[Walter Pidgeon]]: ''[[Nick Carter, Master Detective (film)|Nick Carter, Master Detective]]'' (1939), ''[[Sky Murder]]'' (1940), and ''[[Phantom Raiders]]'' (1940). Columbia produced a serial, ''[[Chick Carter, Detective]]'' (1946). The lead character was changed to Nick Carter's son as the studio could not afford the rights to produce a Nick Carter serial. The whodunit novels of [[Baynard Kendrick]] about blind private detective Mac Maclain were made into two films starring [[Edward Arnold (actor)|Edward Arnold]], ''[[Eyes in the Night]]'' (1942) and ''The Hidden Eye'' (1945).\n\nThe popular radio show ''[[The Whistler]]'' was turned into a series of 8 mystery films from 1944 to 1948. [[Richard Dix (actor)|Richard Dix]] would introduce the stories and alternate between playing a hero, a villain, or a victim of circumstance. In ''[[Mysterious Intruder]]'' (1946), he was a private eye. It was one of the few series to gain acceptance with the public and critics alike. Another radio drama, [[I Love a Mystery]] (1939\u20131944), about a private detective agency, inspired three films starring [[Jim Bannon]]. [[I Love a Mystery (film)|''I Love A Mystery'']] (1945), ''[[The Devil's Mask]]'' and ''[[The Unknown (1946 film)|The Unknown]]'' (both 1946) combined offbeat murder mystery stories with atmospheric horror elements.\n\n[[Chester Morris]] played [[Boston Blackie]], a former jewel thief turned detective, in fourteen films from 1941 to 1949. Produced by [[Columbia Pictures]], many were mysteries laced with comic relief such as ''[[Meet Boston Blackie]]'' (1941), ''[[Boston Blackie Booked on Suspicion]]'' (1945), ''[[The Phantom Thief]]'' (1945), and ''[[Boston Blackie's Chinese Venture]]'' (1949). Columbia also turned the [[Crime Doctor (character)|Crime Doctor]] radio show into a series of mystery films starring [[Warner Baxter]]. Most of them followed the standard whodunit formula. Ten features were produced beginning with ''[[Crime Doctor (film)|Crime Doctor]]'' in 1943 and ending with ''[[Crime Doctor's Diary]]'' (1949).\n\nAnother popular series featured [[George Sanders]] as the suave [[The Falcon (literary character)|Falcon]]. Sixteen films were made from 1941 to 1949. Sanders decided to leave the series during the fourth entry, ''[[The Falcon's Brother]]''. His character was killed off and replaced by Sanders' real-life brother, [[Tom Conway]]. Comedian [[Red Skelton]] played inept radio detective \"The Fox\" in a trio of comedies, ''[[Whistling in the Dark (1941 film)|Whistling in the Dark]]'' (1941), ''[[Whistling in Dixie]]'' (1942), and ''[[Whistling in Brooklyn]]'' (1943).\n\n[[Brett Halliday]]'s \"[[Michael Shayne]]\" detective novels were made into a series of 12 B-movies between 1940 and 1947 (starring [[Lloyd Nolan]] and later [[Hugh Beaumont]]). [[Mickey Spillane]]'s equally rugged [[Mike Hammer]] character was adapted to film with ''[[I, the Jury]]'' (1953), ''[[My Gun is Quick]]'' (1957), and the influential ''[[Kiss Me Deadly]]'' (1955). Spillane even played Hammer once in the 1963 film ''[[The Girl Hunters]]''.\n\nWith ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] created an early psychological mystery thriller. This film, along with ''[[Fear in the Night (1947 film)|Fear in the Night]]'' (1947), explores the effects of [[amnesia]], [[hypnosis]], and [[psychoanalysis]]. Both films also feature surreal dream sequences which are essential to the plot.\n\n====Provisional detectives====\nA frequently used variation on the theme involved an average person who is suddenly forced to turn ad hoc detective in order to solve the murder of a friend or clear their own name. Prime examples include [[Jack Oakie]] in ''[[Super-Sleuth]]'' (1937), [[Ella Raines]] in ''[[Phantom Lady (film)|Phantom Lady]]'' (1944), [[Lucille Ball]] in both ''[[The Dark Corner]]'' (1946) and ''[[Lured]]'' (1947), Alan Ladd in the aforementioned ''The Blue Dahlia'' as well as ''[[Calcutta (1947 film)|Calcutta]]'' (1947), [[George Raft]] in ''[[Johnny Angel]]'' (1945), [[June Vincent]] and [[Dan Duryea]] in ''[[Black Angel (1946 film)|Black Angel]]'' (1946), Humphrey Bogart in ''[[Dead Reckoning (1947 film)|Dead Reckoning]]'' (1947), and Dick Powell in ''[[Cry Danger]]'' (1951).\n\nPerhaps the last word in this subgenre is ''[[D.O.A. (1950 film)|D.O.A.]]'' (1950), where a man dying from a slow-acting poison has to solve his own murder in the hours he has left. This film was remade in 1969 as ''[[Color Me Dead]]'' and again as ''[[D.O.A. (1988 film)|D.O.A.]]'' in 1988.\n\nAlso among this group, the issue of racism as motive for murder is central to ''[[Crossfire (film)|Crossfire]]'' (1947), ''[[Bad Day at Black Rock]]'' (1954), and ''[[A Soldier's Story]]'' (1984).\n\n====''Ten Little Indians''====\nAgatha Christie's novel ''[[Ten Little Indians (novel)|Ten Little Indians]]'' (1939, originally ''Ten Little Niggers'', later changed again to ''And Then There Were None'') presented the concept of a mysterious killer preying on a group of strangers trapped at an isolated location (in this case, Indian Island). This was made into ''[[And Then There Were None (1945 film)|And Then There Were None]]'' (1945), directed by the French exile [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]]. Three more film versions, all titled ''Ten Little Indians'', were released in 1965, 1974, and 1989 along with the 1987 Russian film ''[[Desyat Negrityat]]''.\n\nThis premise has been used countless times, especially in \"old dark house\" genre horror films. A few examples include ''[[Five Dolls for an August Moon]]'' (1970) directed by [[Mario Bava]], ''[[Identity (film)|Identity]]'' (2003), ''Mindhunters'' (2004), made-for-television films (''[[Dead Man's Island]]'', 1996), a miniseries (''[[Harper's Island]]'', 2009), and episodic television such as ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' (\"The Superlative Seven\"), ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'' (\"The Night of The Tottering Tontine\") both from 1967, and ''[[Remington Steele]]'' (\"Steele Trap\") in 1982.\n\n===Revival and revisionist era: 1960s\u20131970s===\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw a [[neo-noir]] resurgence of the hardboiled detective film (and gritty police drama), based on the classic films of the past. These fall into three basic categories: modern updates of old films and novels, atmospheric [[period piece]] films set in the 1930s and 1940s, and new, contemporary detective stories that pay homage to the past.\n\n====Classics made contemporary====\nVeteran private eye Philip Marlowe returned as a modern-day sleuth in ''[[Marlowe (film)|Marlowe]]'' (1969) played by [[James Garner]] (based on Chandler's ''The Little Sister''), and in [[Robert Altman]]'s revisionist ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973) played by [[Elliott Gould]]. [[Robert Mitchum]] played Marlowe in the remake of ''[[The Big Sleep (1978 film)|The Big Sleep]]'' (1978) set in contemporary London. [[Paul Newman]] portrays a modernized [[Lew Archer]] (changed to Harper) in ''[[Harper (film)|Harper]]'' (1966) and ''[[The Drowning Pool]]'' (1976), based on [[Ross Macdonald]]'s 1949\u201350 novels.\n\n[[Craig Stevens (actor)|Craig Stevens]] reprised his role as suave private eye Peter Gunn in ''[[Gunn (film)|Gunn]]'' (1967), a sixties-mod update of his atmospheric, film noir ''[[Peter Gunn]]'' TV series (1958\u201361). Bulldog Drummond returned as a contemporary sleuth in ''[[Deadlier Than the Male]]'' (1967) and ''[[Some Girls Do]]'' (1969). Both films were produced in the extravagant style of a [[James Bond]] espionage yarn. The remake of ''[[I, the Jury]]'' (1982) brought back Mike Hammer (revived again in the 1984\u201387 television series, ''[[Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer (1984 TV series)|Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer]]''). ''[[Kiss Kiss Bang Bang]]'' (2005) is a modernized adaptation of [[Brett Halliday]]'s 1941 [[Michael Shayne]] novel ''Bodies Are Where You Find Them''.\n\nThe old-fashioned whodunit formula from the 1930s was given a fresh update in ''[[The List of Adrian Messenger]]'' (1963), ''[[Sleuth (1972 film)|Sleuth]]'' (1972), ''[[The Last of Sheila]]'' (1973), and the comedy ''[[Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?]]'' (1978).\n\nThe early films of [[Brian De Palma]] include the slasher comedy ''[[Murder a la Mod]]'' (1968), the Hitchcock-inspired ''[[Sisters (1973 film)|Sisters]]'' (1973), and ''[[Obsession (1976 film)|Obsession]]'' (1976), a remake of Hitchcock's 1958 classic ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''. The influence of Hitchcock emerged in several French thrillers, especially ''[[The Champagne Murders]]'' (1967) directed by [[Claude Chabrol]] and ''[[The Bride Wore Black]]'' (1968) by [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]].\n\n====Period films====\nThe many period films set in the 1930s and 1940s are led by [[Roman Polanski]]'s classic ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'' (1974) starring [[Jack Nicholson]] and its belated sequel, ''[[The Two Jakes]]'' (1990), which Nicholson also directed. Robert Mitchum played Marlowe for the first time in ''[[Farewell, My Lovely]]'' (1975), perhaps the most faithful adaptation of this often-filmed book. The obscure ''Chandler'' (1972) is set in the 1940s but has nothing to do with Raymond Chandler's writings. The television film ''Goodnight, My Love'' (1972) with [[Richard Boone]] and two short-lived TV series, ''[[Banyon]]'' (1972\u201373) and ''[[City of Angels (1976 series)|City of Angels]]'' (1976) were also set in the 1930s and pay tribute to the Sam Spade/Philip Marlowe model. And the television film ''Who Is the Black Dahlia?'' (1975) recreates the true unsolved murder case from 1947.\n\nAgatha Christie's elegant ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1974) and ''[[Death on the Nile (1978 film)|Death on the Nile]]'' (1978) were colorful, lavish productions rich in 1930s period detail. Earlier, a series of lighthearted Miss Marple mysteries were loosely adapted from Christie's novels. [[Margaret Rutherford]] starred in ''[[Murder, She Said]]'' (1961), ''[[Murder Most Foul (film)|Murder Most Foul]]'' (1964), ''[[Murder Ahoy!]]'' (1965), and did a humorous cameo appearance as Marple in the [[Hercule Poirot]] mystery ''[[The Alphabet Murders]]'' (1965).\n\nThe evergreen Sherlock Holmes was given a revisionist treatment in [[Billy Wilder]]'s ''[[The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes]]'' (1970). In ''[[The Seven Percent Solution]]'' (1976), Dr. [[Sigmund Freud]] himself cures Holmes of his drug addiction. And two films, ''[[A Study in Terror]]'' (1965) and ''[[Murder by Decree]]'' (1979), which includes scenes of lurid gore, put Holmes in pursuit of the mysterious real-life serial murderer [[Jack the Ripper]]. The definitive and most faithful adaptation of the original stories was done by the British TV series [[Sherlock Holmes (1984 TV series)|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]] starring [[Jeremy Brett]] as Holmes and [[David Burke (British actor)|David Burke]] as Watson, in 41 episodes which ran from 1984\u20131994.\n\nLater Holmes films are often inventions that have little or nothing to do with the original Arthur Conan Doyle stories, such as ''[[Young Sherlock Holmes]]'' (1985), produced by [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[Amblin Entertainment]], which puts the teenage sleuth in an action-adventure story replete with computer-generated special effects. The reinvention of Holmes has continued as evidenced by the revamped, big-budget Warner Bros. series directed by [[Guy Ritchie]]. In ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' (2009) and ''[[Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows]]'' (2011), the cerebral detective (played by [[Robert Downey, Jr.]]) is transformed into an athletic (and romantic) action hero in a [[steampunk]] fantasy version of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] England.\n\n====The New Wave====\nThe New Wave of modern detective films may well begin with [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s offbeat ''[[Alphaville (film)|Alphaville]]'' (1965) with its traditional, raincoat-and-fedora private eye placed in a futuristic, science fiction-based story. The film is part homage, part parody of the detective genre. Godard followed this with ''[[Made in U.S.A. (1966 film)|Made in U.S.A.]]'' (1966), an ironic, unconventional murder mystery of sorts that lightly references the [[Howard Hawks]] classic ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]''.\n\n[[Frank Sinatra]] is a cynical, Bogart-like gumshoe in ''[[Tony Rome]]'' (1967) and its sequel ''[[Lady in Cement]]'' (1968) \u2014 and a tough police investigator in ''[[The Detective (1968 film)|The Detective]]'' (1968). [[John D. MacDonald]] wrote 21 [[Travis McGee]] novels, but only one, ''[[Darker than Amber (film)|Darker than Amber]]'' (1970) was filmed. [[George Peppard]] is a traditional private detective in ''[[P.J. (film)|P.J.]]'' (1968). [[Kirk Douglas]] is an ex-cop turned private sleuth/body guard in the more light-hearted ''[[A Lovely Way to Die]]'' (1968). [[Robert Culp]] and [[Bill Cosby]] are hard-luck private eyes in the downbeat and violent ''[[Hickey & Boggs]]'' (1972). [[Burt Reynolds]] plays a tongue-in-cheek ''[[Shamus (film)|Shamus]]'' (1973), and [[Burt Lancaster]] is a retired cop turned sleuth in ''[[The Midnight Man (1974 film)|The Midnight Man]]'' (1974). Two of the finest examples star [[Gene Hackman]] in ''[[The Conversation]]'' (1974) and ''[[Night Moves (1975 film)|Night Moves]]'' (1975).\n\nThe [[blaxploitation]] B-movie industry adopted the standard private detective format for several action-mysteries such as ''[[Trouble Man (film)|Trouble Man]]'' (1972), ''[[Black Eye]]'' (1974), ''[[Sheba, Baby]]'' (1975) starring [[Pam Grier]], and ''[[Velvet Smooth]]'' (1976).\n\n''[[Brick (film)|Brick]]'' (2005), written and directed by [[Rian Johnson]], is a unique homage bordering on parody which brings the terse, slang-filled dialog of Raymond Chandler to a modern-day California high school where a teenage sleuth investigates a murder connected to a drug ring.\n\nNoteworthy '''police detective dramas''' of the period include The French film ''[[The Sleeping Car Murders]]'' (1965), ''[[In the Heat of the Night (film)|In the Heat of the Night]]'' (winner of five [[Academy Awards]], including Best Picture in 1967), ''[[Bullitt]]'', ''[[Madigan]]'' (both 1968), ''[[Klute]]'' (1971), ''[[Electra Glide in Blue]]'' (1973), and two non-mysteries: ''[[Dirty Harry]]'', and ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (both 1971). ''[[The Parallax View]]'' (1974) is the first murder mystery structured around political assassinations and high-level conspiracies in America.\n\n====Memory loss mysteries====\n\nUsing [[amnesia]] as a central plot device in mysteries began in 1936 with ''[[Two in the Dark]]'' (remade as ''[[Two O'Clock Courage]]'', 1945),\nfollowed by ''[[Crossroads (1942 film)|Crossroads]]'' (1942) starring [[William Powell]], ''[[Crime Doctor (film)|Crime Doctor]]'' (1943), ''[[The Power of the Whistler]]'' (1945), and ''[[Somewhere in the Night (film)|Somewhere in the Night]]'' (1946).\n\nIn the 1960s amnesia stories had a resurgence in the mystery-thriller genre. Here the protagonist loses his pre-existing memories after some mental or physical trauma and embarks on a quest to recover his identity. At the same time he finds himself at the center of a mysterious conspiracy involving murder, espionage, or both. Films in this category include ''[[Mirage (1965 film)|Mirage]]'' with [[Gregory Peck]], ''[[The Third Day]]'' starring [[George Peppard]], the British film ''[[Hysteria (1965 film)|Hysteria]]'' from [[Hammer Films]] (all from 1965), ''[[Mister Buddwing]]'' (1966) with [[James Garner]], and ''[[Jigsaw (1968 film)|Jigsaw]]'' (1968), a remake of ''Mirage''.\n\nConcurrently, the hero-gets-amnesia story became a frequently used television cliche (see [[TV Tropes]]). There were two series, the western ''[[A Man Called Shenandoah]]'' (1965\u20131966), and the contemporary drama ''[[Coronet Blue]]'' (filmed 1965, broadcast 1967), both about a man with no memories. Numerous crime-dramas, adventure shows, and comedies featured episodes in which the lead character has temporary amnesia. These include ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'', ''[[The Munsters]]'' (both 1965),''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' (1966), ''[[Get Smart]]'' (1967), ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'', ''[[The Big Valley]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' (all from 1968), ''[[It Takes a Thief (1968 TV series)|It Takes a Thief]]'' (1969), ''[[The Mod Squad]]'' (1971), ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' (1972), ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' (1973), and ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' (1978). By the end of the 1970s, this now shop-worn plot device became dormant once again until resurfacing in a spate of mystery thrillers in the 1990s (see the ''Psychological thriller'' section below).\n\n====Italian Giallo thrillers====\nIn Italy, a new type of controversial horror-based thriller called the [[Giallo]] film (which began in the 1960s) became a popular and influential genre by the early 1970s. Films in this category range from police procedurals to gothic horror. The stories tend to center around a series of grisly murder sequences with shocking ''[[grand guignol]]'' style gore, sometimes mixed with sadistic eroticism (the victims often being beautiful women). The villains are usually mysterious, psychopathic [[serial killer]]s (often wearing masks or disguises) who are eventually hunted down by the police and/or an average person turned sleuth. The first important film in this genre is ''[[Blood and Black Lace]]'' (1964) directed by [[Mario Bava]].\n\nSome examples that follow a standard murder mystery format include ''[[Five Dolls for an August Moon]]'' (1970) by Mario Bava, three by director [[Dario Argento]]: ''[[The Cat o' Nine Tails]]'', ''[[Four Flies on Grey Velvet]]'' (both 1971), and ''[[Deep Red]]'' (1975) \u2013 as well as ''[[A Lizard in a Woman's Skin]]'' (1971), ''[[The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh]]'' (1971), ''[[Black Belly of the Tarantula]]'' (1971), ''[[Who Saw Her Die?]]'' (1972), ''[[What Have You Done to Solange?]]'' (1972), ''[[Casa d'appuntamento]]'' (aka ''The French Sex Murders'', 1972), and ''[[The Red Queen Kills Seven Times]]'' (1972).\n\nThe Giallo style has had an enduring influence on horror films in general as well as the subgenre [[slasher film|slasher]] and [[splatter film]]s that would soon follow. Early examples of this influence can be seen in the British ''[[Circus of Fear]]'' (1966), based on a [[Edgar Wallace]] novel, ''[[Berserk!]]'' (1967), and the American mystery-thrillers ''[[No Way to Treat a Lady (film)|No Way to Treat a Lady]]'' (1968), ''[[Klute]]'' (1971), ''[[Pretty Maids All in a Row]]'' (1971), based on an Italian novel, ''[[Eyes of Laura Mars]]'' (1978), and Hitchcock's ''[[Frenzy]]'' (1972).\n\n====From ''Blowup'' to ''Blow Out''====\nOne mystery film stands out in a category by itself. [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s provocative ''[[Blowup]]'' (1966) is a unique anti-whodunit symbolizing the aimless hedonism of the 1960s. A [[swinging London]] photographer uncovers clues to a murder, but solving the crime is rendered irrelevant in a society where no one really cares. This contrasts sharply with the ending of ''The Maltese Falcon'' where Sam Spade solves the murder of his partner, Miles Archer. He sacrifices the woman he's fallen for, not because he was fond of Archer (he wasn't), but because it's the right thing to do.\n\nIn 1981, [[Brian De Palma]] remade this as ''[[Blow Out]]'', turning it into a more traditional political thriller. In the DVD audio commentary for ''The Conversation'', director [[Francis Ford Coppola]] revealed that ''Blowup'' was a major source of inspiration for that film.\n\n''[[Electra Glide in Blue]]'' (1973) is another rare example of a murder-mystery plot used as a vehicle for a story concerning greater issues. In this case, disillusionment and the death of dreams and idealism in a world full of immorality.\n\n===The 1980s to the present===\nSince the mid-1970s, only a handful of films with private detectives have been produced. These include ''[[I, the Jury (1982 film)|I, the Jury]]'', ''[[Angel Heart]]'', ''Hollywood Harry'', ''[[The Two Jakes]]'', ''[[Devil in a Blue Dress (film)|Devil in a Blue Dress]]'', ''[[Pure Luck]]'', ''[[Under Suspicion (2000 film)|Under Suspicion]]'', ''[[Twilight (1998 film)|Twilight]]'' with [[Paul Newman]], and [[Ben Affleck]]'s ''[[Gone Baby Gone]]''.\n\nRaymond Chandler's original Philip Marlowe short stories from the '30s (which he later expanded into novels) were adapted by the [[HBO]] cable network into eleven one-hour episodes for cable television. The series, ''Philip Marlowe: Private Eye'' (1983\u20131986), starred [[Powers Boothe]] as the hard-bitten detective.\n\nFilms with female detectives have not fared well. [[Kathleen Turner]] as private eye ''[[V.I. Warshawski]]'' (1991), was to be the start of a new franchise based on the book series by [[Sara Paretsky]], but the film was a box-office failure. Plans to turn the ''[[Honey West (TV series)|Honey West]]'' novels into a film have been in and out of development for over a decade with no film in sight.\n\nSince 1980, ten films based on the ever-popular novels of Agatha Christie have been released. Two with eccentric sleuth Hercule Poirot, ''[[Evil Under the Sun]]'' (1982), ''[[Appointment with Death]]'' (1988), and one with Miss Marple ''[[The Mirror Crack'd]]'' (1980). Christie herself became the subject of a mystery film in 1979's ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' starring [[Vanessa Redgrave]]. The film was a fictional speculation on her famous 11-day disappearance in 1926.\n\n====Military mysteries and police procedurals====\nComplex murder mysteries related to military men began with ''[[Crossfire (film)|Crossfire]]'' (1947). More recent examples include ''[[A Soldier's Story]]'' (1984), ''[[No Way Out (1987 film)|No Way Out]]'' (1987), ''[[The Presidio]]'' (1988), ''[[A Few Good Men (film)|A Few Good Men]]'' (1992), ''[[Courage Under Fire]]'' (1996), ''[[The General's Daughter (film)|The General's Daughter]]'' (1999), and ''[[Basic (film)|Basic]]'' (2003).\n\nThe [[police procedural]] film, often with a surprise twist ending, has also remained a vital format with ''[[Cruising (film)|Cruising]]'' (1980), ''[[Gorky Park (film)|Gorky Park]]'' (1983), ''[[Tightrope (film)|Tightrope]]'' (1984), ''[[The Dead Pool]]'' (1988), ''[[Mississippi Burning]]'' (1988), ''[[Mortal Thoughts]]'' (1991), ''[[Rising Sun (film)|Rising Sun]]'' (1993), ''[[Striking Distance]]'' (1993), ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' (1995), ''[[Lone Star (1996 film)|Lone Star]]'' (1996), ''[[Under Suspicion (2000 film)|Under Suspicion]]'' (2000), ''[[Blood Work (film)|Blood Work]]'' (2002), ''[[Mystic River (film)|Mystic River]]'' (2003), ''[[Mindhunters]]''<ref>http://www.allmovie.com/work/mindhunters-285906</ref> (2004), ''[[In the Valley of Elah]]'' (2007), and ''[[Righteous Kill]]'' (2008).\n\nThe [[political thriller]] involving murder, cover-ups, and high-level conspiracies is represented by such films as ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (1991), ''[[Murder at 1600]]'' (1997), ''[[Enemy of the State (film)|Enemy of the State]]'' (1998), ''[[State of Play (film)|State of Play]]'' (2009), and ''[[Madras Cafe]]'' (2013).\n\n====Horror and thriller====\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, many horror films and thrillers started to blend mystery and suspense into stories centered around clever, sociopathic serial killers or various mysterious supernatural occurrences. The [[Hannibal Lecter]] novels by [[Thomas Harris]] have inspired four films, ''[[Manhunter (film)|Manhunter]]'' (1986), the Academy Award-winning ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991), ''[[Hannibal (2001 film)|Hannibal]]'' (2001), and ''[[Red Dragon (2002 film)|Red Dragon]]'' (2002).\n\nOther films in which this blend occurs include ''[[When the Bough Breaks (1993 film)|When the Bough Breaks]]'' (1994), ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' (1995), ''[[Kiss the Girls (1997 film)|Kiss the Girls]]'' (1997), adapted from the [[James Patterson]] novel, ''[[The Bone Collector]]'' (1999), ''[[Mercy (2000 film)|Mercy]]'' (2000), ''[[Along Came a Spider (film)|Along Came a Spider]]'' (2001), also by Patterson, ''[[Insomnia (2002 film)|Insomnia]]'' (2002), and ''[[Taking Lives (film)|Taking Lives]]'' (2004).\n\nThe 2007 film ''[[Zodiac (film)|Zodiac]]'' is an account of the real hunt for a serial killer in the San Francisco area in the late-1960s and early 1970s. Contemporary real-life serial killings have been portrayed in ''[[The Alphabet Killer]]'', ''[[In the Light of the Moon|Ed Gein]]'', ''[[Gacy (film)|Gacy]]'', ''[[Ted Bundy (film)|Ted Bundy]]'' and ''[[Dahmer (film)|Dahmer]]''. The French period-piece film ''[[Brotherhood of the Wolf]]'' (2001) examines a series of killings that took place in France in the 18th century.\n\nIn many modern day mystery films, everyday characters (such as fathers, mothers, teens, business people, etc.) are dragged into a dangerous conflict or a mysterious situation, either by [[Destiny|fate]] or their own curiosity. Common elements in these stories include searching for a [[missing person]] (a friend or family member) as in ''[[Flightplan]]'' (2005) with [[Jodie Foster]], while being surrounded by [[red herring]]s, espionage, criminal or political conspiracies, and friends/relatives with a secret past or a double life.\n\nSuch films include the horror mysteries [[Scream (franchise)|''Scream'' and its sequels]] (1996\u20132011), [[Saw (franchise)|the ''Saw'' franchise]] (2004\u20132010), ''[[The Orphanage (2007 film)|The Orphanage]]'' (2006), ''[[What Lies Beneath]]'' (2000), ''[[Cry Wolf (2005 film)|Cry Wolf]]'' (2005), ''[[Devil (2010 film)|Devil]]'' (2010), ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'' (2002) and the mystery thrillers ''[[Secret Window]]'' (2004), ''[[The Machinist]]'' (2004), ''[[The Forgotten (2004 film)|The Forgotten]]'' (2005), ''[[The Number 23]]'' (2006),<ref>http://www.allmovie.com/work/the-number-23-336722</ref> and ''[[Identity (film)|Identity]]'' (2003).\n\nThe [[retrograde amnesia]] plot also resurfaced in a new wave of mysteries where discovering the lead character's true identity and/or history forms the core of the story. Main examples include: ''[[The Morning After (1986 film)|The Morning After]]'' (1986), ''[[Shattered (1991 film)|Shattered]]'' (1991), ''[[The Long Kiss Goodnight]]'' (1996), ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'' (2000),<ref>http://www.allmovie.com/work/memento-220920</ref> the [[Bourne (film series)|''Bourne'' film series]] (2002\u20132012), and ''[[Shutter Island (film)|Shutter Island]]'' (2010). [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s highly stylized ''[[Dead Again]]'' (1991) pays homage to Hitchcock and [[Orson Welles]] in a complex story of amnesia, hypnosis, and reincarnation. There are also science fiction thrillers such as ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990), [[Total Recall (2012 film)|remade]] in 2012, and ''[[Paycheck (film)|Paycheck]]'' (2003) which center around technology-induced memory loss.\n\n====Revisionist period piece films====\nPeriod-piece L.A. police detective stories set in the 1940s and 1950s returned \u2014 with a harder edge and occasional parallels to contemporary issues \u2014 in ''[[Mulholland Falls]]'' (1996), and ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'' (1997) which was nominated for nine [[Academy Awards]] and won two. Both ''[[True Confessions (film)|True Confessions]]'' (1981) and De Palma's ''[[The Black Dahlia (film)|The Black Dahlia]]'' (2006) are based on an actual unsolved Hollywood murder case from 1947. ''[[Hollywoodland]]'' (2006) explores the mysterious 1959 death of actor [[George Reeves]], who is portrayed by [[Ben Affleck]].\n\nRaymond Chandler's final unfinished novel, ''[[Poodle Springs]]'', from 1958, was completed by another author and made into an HBO cable film in 1998. Set in 1963, it stars [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]] as Philip Marlowe.\n\nAmong the few nostalgia-based comedy-mysteries are the board game-inspired ''[[Clue (film)|Clue]]'' (1985), set in 1954, and ''[[Radioland Murders]]'' (1994), which recreates the era of old-time radio programs and pays homage to 1930s screwball comedies. [[Larry Blamire]]'s ''[[Dark and Stormy Night (film)|Dark and Stormy Night]]'' (2009), set in 1930, spoofs the cliched characters and plot elements of vintage \"old dark house\" murder mysteries.\n\n''[[Devil in a Blue Dress (film)|Devil in a Blue Dress]]'' (1995), set in Los Angeles c. 1948, features an African-American private eye. The film captures the atmosphere of the hard-boiled detective stories of the past as well as the racial climate of the times.\n\nComing full circle, [[Robert Altman]]'s nostalgic ''[[Gosford Park]]'' (2001), set in an English mansion in 1932, is an original story that revives the old-fashioned murder mystery format.\n\n==Notable mystery films==\nIn 2008, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked the top 10 mystery films of all time:\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"width:40%\"\n|-\n!width=5%| #\n!width=85%| Film\n!width=10%| Year\n|-\n| 1\n| ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''\n| [[1958 in film|1958]]\n|-\n| 2\n| ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]''\n| [[1974 in film|1974]]\n|-\n| 3\n| ''[[Rear Window]]''\n| [[1954 in film|1954]]\n|-\n| 4\n| ''[[Laura (1944 film)|Laura]]''\n| [[1944 in film|1944]]\n|-\n| 5\n| ''[[The Third Man]]''\n| [[1949 in film|1949]]\n|-\n| 6\n| ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]''\n| [[1941 in film|1941]]\n|-\n| 7\n| ''[[North by Northwest]]''\n| [[1959 in film|1959]]\n|-\n| 8\n| ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]''\n| [[1986 in film|1986]]\n|-\n| 9\n| ''[[Dial M for Murder]]''\n| [[1954 in film|1954]]\n|-\n| 10\n| ''[[The Usual Suspects]]''\n| [[1995 in film|1995]]\n|}\n\n==Genre blends: horror, fantasy, science fiction, historical==\nBy the 1970s and 1980s, detective and mystery stories began to appear in other genres, sometimes as the framing device for a horror, fantasy or science fiction film or placed in an earlier, nontraditional time period.\n* ''[[Hec Ramsey]]'', a 1972\u201374 television series starred [[Richard Boone]] as a Sherlock Holmes-type detective in the Old West at the turn of the 20th century.\n* The science fiction films ''[[Soylent Green]]'' (1973), ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' (1981), ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' (2002), and ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'' (2004) all involve futuristic police detectives solving a murder that leads to a larger conspiracy.\n* ''[[Escape to Witch Mountain (1975 film)|Escape to Witch Mountain]]'' (1975), ''[[Return from Witch Mountain]]'' (1978) and ''[[Race to Witch Mountain]]'' (2009), created by [[Alexander Key]] and produced by [[The Walt Disney Company]] are about two children from another world searching for their origins.\n* ''[[The Reincarnation of Peter Proud]]'' (1975), [[supernatural]] detective story about a man who solves his own murder from a previous life.\n* ''[[Eyes of Laura Mars]]'' (1978) is a [[Giallo]]-inspired murder mystery thriller that involves the paranormal.\n* ''[[Looker]]'' (1981), a science fiction murder mystery film involving futuristic computer technology.\n* ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982), a neo-noir science fiction classic set in the future. This comes closest to capturing the spirit of Raymond Chandler's Marlowe with [[Harrison Ford]]'s sardonic, voice-over narration.\n* ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' (1986), from the [[Umberto Eco]] novel, features a 13th-century Sherlock Holmsian monk. The medieval era [[Cadfael (TV series)|Cadfael]] series of television mysteries also took the form of historical fiction.\n* ''[[Angel Heart]]'' (1987), set in 1948, begins as a retro detective yarn but soon becomes a supernatural horror shocker. ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me]]'' (1992), and the cult TV series of which this is a prequel, also blends murder-mystery forensic work with supernatural horror.\n* ''[[Alien Nation (film)|Alien Nation]]'' (1988), a murder-mystery police procedural in a science fiction setting. A race of stranded aliens must co-exist with humans on Earth in the near future. The story uses aliens to explore the issues of [[xenophobia]], [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], and [[racism]].\n* ''[[Faceless (film)|Faceless]]'' (1988) is a gory [[Jess Franco]] private-eye horror-mystery.\n* ''[[Cast a Deadly Spell]]'' (1991) is a cable film with gumshoe Harry P. Lovecraft (a reference to horror/fantasy author [[H. P. Lovecraft]]) set in a fantasy version of 1948 Los Angeles where sorcery and voodoo abound. This was followed by ''[[Witch Hunt (1994 film)|Witch Hunt]]'' in 1994, a mock fantasy/mystery set in 1953. Private eye Lovecraft ([[Dennis Hopper]]) uncovers witchcraft and murder in Hollywood.\n* ''[[Lord of Illusions]]'' (1995), [[Clive Barker]] story of supernatural horror with New York P.I. Harry D'Amour, who has an affinity for the occult.\n* ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]'' (1999), set in 1799, this features a constable who uses Holmsian scientific methods and forensic science to solve a series of murders in this horror-fantasy film from [[Tim Burton]].\n* The [[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter films]] (2001\u20132011) are [[fantasy films|fantasy]] stories that contain many mysteries concerning the main characters, especially in the first three entries: ''[[Harry Potter and The Philosopher's Stone (film)|The Philosopher's Stone]]'' (2001), ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|The Chamber of Secrets]]'' (2002) and ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|The Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' (2004).\n* [[The Ring (2002 film)|''The Ring'']] (2002) is a horror mystery in which a reporter named Rachel Keller investigates the origins of a cursed videotape which threatens to take her life.\n* ''[[The Reckoning (2003 film)|The Reckoning]]'' (2003), a murder-mystery set in medieval England.\n* ''[[Someone Behind You]]'' (2007), is a South Korean supernatural thriller/murder mystery based on a comic book.\n* ''[[Yesterday Was a Lie]]'' (2008), [[neo-noir]] black-and-white detective mystery combines science fantasy and film noir.\n* ''[[The Wisdom Tree]]'' (2013), is an [[independent film]] that blends science fiction with mystery and mysticism, art and music.\n\n==Parodies and homages==\n* ''[[Who Done It? (1942 film)|Who Done It?]]'' (1942), an [[Abbott and Costello]] comedy, is one of the first film spoofs of the genre.\n* ''[[Lady on a Train]]'' (1945) is a murder mystery comedy starring [[Deanna Durbin]] that also satirizes film noir.\n* In ''[[My Favorite Brunette]]'' (1947), [[Bob Hope]] is a cowardly baby photographer who is mistaken for a private detective (played by Alan Ladd in a brief cameo). Later that year, [[The Bowery Boys]] released ''Hard Boiled Mahoney'' with the same mistaken-identity plot.\n* ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man]]'' (1951), A&C are detectives out to save a man framed by mobsters.\n* ''Private Eyes'' (1953), The Bowery Boys open up a detective agency after Sach develops the ability to read minds.\n* [[Grindhouse]] [[sexploitation]] filmmakers also spoofed the genre. ''Nature's Playmates'' (1962) is one of [[Exploitation film|exploitation]] producer [[Herschell Gordon Lewis|H.G. Lewis]]' many \"nudie-cutie\" flicks. A beautiful female private eye tours Florida [[nudist camp]]s in search of a missing man with a distinctive tattoo. ''[[Surftide 77]]'' (1962) parodied TV detective series ''[[Surfside 6]]'' (1960\u20131962). ''Take It Out In Trade'' (1970) is [[Ed Wood]]'s softcore porn take on the Philip Marlowe films. ''[[Cry Uncle!]]'' (1971) is another sex comedy inspired by vintage private eye films. ''Ginger'' (1971), ''The Abductors'' (1972), and ''Girls Are for Loving'' (1973) are softcore sexploitation comedies featuring [[Cheri Caffaro]] as tough private-eye Ginger. England also produced the sex comedy ''[[Adventures of a Private Eye]]'' (1977).\n* ''[[The Pink Panther (1963 film)|The Pink Panther]]'' (1964) is the first in a series of comedies featuring [[Peter Sellers]] as the bumbling [[Inspector Clouseau]].\n* ''[[They Might Be Giants (film)|They Might be Giants]]'' (1971) stars [[George C.

It focuses on the efforts of the [[detective]], [[private investigator]] or amateur [[Detective |sleuth]] to solve the mysterious circumstances of an issue by means of clues, investigation, and clever deduction.\n\nThe plot often centers on the deductive ability, prowess, confidence, or diligence of the detective as they attempt to unravel the crime or situation by piecing together clues and circumstances, seeking [[evidence]], interrogating witnesses, and tracking down a criminal.\n\nSuspense is often maintained as an important [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] element. This can be done through the use of the [[soundtrack]], [[camera]] angles, heavy [[shadows]], and surprising [[plot twist]]s. [[Alfred Hitchcock]] used all of these techniques, but would sometimes allow the audience in on a pending [[threat]] then draw out the moment for dramatic effect.\n\nThis genre has ranged from early mystery tales, fictional or literary detective stories, to classic Hitchcockian suspense-[[thriller film|thrillers]] to classic private detective films. A related film subgenre is [[spy films]].<ref>[http://www.filmsite.org/mysteryfilms.html Detective-Mystery Films]</ref>\n\n==Definition and characteristics==\n[[File:Jeremy Brett.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jeremy Brett]] as Sherlock Holmes from the [[Granada TV]] television series (1984-1994).]]\nMystery films mainly focus on solving a [[crime]] or a [[puzzle]]. The mystery generally revolves around a [[murder]] which must then be solved by [[policemen]], private [[detectives]], or amateur sleuths. The viewer is presented with a series of likely [[suspect]]s, some of whom are \"[[red herring]]s,\" \u2013persons who have the motive to commit the crime but did not actually do it\u2013, and attempts to solve the puzzle along with the investigator. At times the viewer is presented with information not available to the main character. The central character usually explores the unsolved crime, unmasks the perpetrator, and puts an end to the effects of the villainy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allrovi.com/movies/genre/mystery-d651 |title=Mystery Movies and Films |accessdate=2012-01-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117062845/http://www.allrovi.com/movies/genre/mystery-d651 |archivedate=2012-01-17 }}</ref>\n\nThe successful mystery film adheres to one of two story types, known as Open and Closed. The Closed (or [[whodunit]]) mystery conceals the identity of the perpetrator until late in the story, adding an element of [[suspense]] during the apprehension of the [[suspect]], as the audience is never quite sure who it is. The Open mystery, in contrast, reveals the identity of the perpetrator at the top of the story, showcasing the \"[[perfect crime]]\" which the audience then watches the [[protagonist]] unravel, usually at the very end of the story, akin to the unveiling scenes in the Closed style.\n\nMystery novels have proven to be a good medium for translation into film. The [[Detective|sleuth]] often forms a strong leading character, and the plots can include elements of drama, suspense, character development, uncertainty, and surprise twists. The locales of the mystery tale are often of a mundane variety, requiring little in the way of expensive special effects. Successful mystery writers can produce a series of books based on the same sleuth character, providing rich material for sequels.\n\nUntil at least the [[1980s in film|1980s]], women in mystery films have often served a dual role, providing a relationship with the [[detective]] and frequently playing the part of woman-in-peril. The women in these films are often resourceful individuals, being self-reliant, determined and as often duplicitous. They can provide the triggers for the events that follow or serve as an element of suspense as helpless victims.\n\n==History==\n\n===Literary influences===\n[[File:A Study in Scarlet from Beeton's Christmas Annual 1887.jpg|thumb|upright|The first appearance of Holmes, 1887]]\nThe earliest mystery films reach back to the [[silent film|silent era]]. The first detective film is often cited as ''[[Sherlock Holmes Baffled]]'', a very short [[Mutoscope]] reel created between 1900 and 1903 by [[Arthur Marvin]]. It is the [[Adaptations of Sherlock Holmes#Film|earliest-known film]] to feature the character of detective [[Sherlock Holmes]], albeit in a barely recognisable form.<ref>[http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/h/holmes.htm International Hero.co.uk], URL accessed January 28, 2010</ref><ref name=Tuska>Jon Tuska, ''The detective in Hollywood'' (Doubleday, 1978), p.1</ref><ref name=Harmon>[[Jim Harmon]], ''Radio Mystery and Adventure and Its Appearances in Film, Television and Other Media'' (McFarland, 2003), p.176</ref>\n\nIn France, the popular [[Nick Carter (literary character)|Nick Carter]] detective novels inspired the first [[film serial]], ''[[Nick Carter, le roi des d\u00e9tectives]]'' (1908). This six-episode series was followed with ''Nouveaux aventures de Nick Carter'' in 1909. [[Louis Feuillade]] created the highly popular [[Fant\u00f4mas]] (1913\u201314) serial based on the best-selling serial novel about a super-criminal pursued by a stubborn inspector Juve. [[Dujardin]] wears a mask and costume similar to Fantomas' in an apparent tribute in ''[[The Artist (film)|The Artist]]'', a nostalgic 2011 film about silent cinema. Later detective serials by Feuillade include ''[[Les vampires|The Vampires]]'' (1915), ''[[Judex (1916 film)|Judex]]'' (1916), ''[[Tih Minh]]'' (1918), and ''[[Barrabas (film)|Barrabas]]'' (1919). Feuillade's films, which combined realism, poetic imagery, and pure fantasy, influenced the American ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|The Perils of Pauline]]'' (1914), directors such as [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]], and [[Surrealism|Surrealists]] such as [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]].\n\nThe earliest true mystery films include ''The Gold Bug'' (1910), also from France, and ''The Murders in the Rue Morgue'' (1914). Both are derived from stories by [[Edgar Allan Poe]], which is appropriate as Poe is often credited with creating modern [[detective fiction]] as well as the first private detective character, [[C. Auguste Dupin]]. [[Universal Pictures]] renamed him Pierre Dupin in ''[[Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932 film)|Murders in the Rue Morgue]]'' (1932), an atmospheric horror-mystery starring [[Bela Lugosi]]. The film was remade twice more in 1953 and 1971. Poe's second Dupin story, ''[[The Mystery of Marie Rog\u00eat]]'', was filmed in 1942. More recently, ''[[The Raven (2012 film)|The Raven]]'' (2012) presented a fictionalized account of the last days of Poe's life. Here, the author pursues a mysterious serial killer whose murders are directly inspired by his stories.\n\n[[Charles Dickens]]' unfinished novel ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]'' (1870) was completed by another author and eventually adapted to the screen. Two films, now believed lost, were made in 1909 and 1914. Universal produced ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood (1935 film)|The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]'' (1935). The story was remade again in 1993. Universal, known mostly for its long list of classic horror films, also created perhaps the first [[supernatural]] horror-whodunit hybrid with ''[[Night Monster]]'' (1942).\n\nAmerican author [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]] (1876\u20131958), is credited with inventing the \"[[Had I but known|Had-I-But-Known]]\" school of mystery writing (as well as the phrase, \"The butler did it\"). Her 1920 \"old dark house\" novel (and play) ''The Bat'' was filmed as ''[[The Bat (1926 film)|The Bat]]'' (1926), as ''[[The Bat Whispers]]'' (1930), and a third time a remake, ''[[The Bat (1959 film)|The Bat]]'' (1959), starring [[Vincent Price]]. Another movie based on a play, ''[[The Cat and the Canary (1927 film)|The Cat and the Canary]]'' (1927), pioneered the \"comedy-mystery\" genre. Remade several times, including a version with [[Bob Hope]] released in 1939.\n\nUndoubtedly the most famous of the amateur detectives to appear on the silver screen is the archetypal [[Sherlock Holmes]]. Since 1903 Holmes has been portrayed by a multitude of actors in over 200 films. Perhaps the earliest detective comedy is [[Buster Keaton]]'s ''[[Sherlock Jr.]]'' (1924). Until recently, the only American-made series starred [[Basil Rathbone]] and [[Nigel Bruce]] as Holmes and Dr. Watson. Together they made 14 films between 1939 and 1946. The first two, at [[20th Century Fox]], were period piece mysteries set in the late-[[Victorian era]] of the original stories. By the third film, ''[[Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror]]'' (1942), now taken up by [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]], Holmes was updated to the present day. Several films dealt with World War II and thwarting Nazi spies.\n\nThe crime novelist [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] (1893\u20131957) created the archetypal British aristocratic sleuth [[Lord Peter Wimsey]] in 1923. Peter Haddon first played Wimsey in ''[[The Silent Passenger]]'' (1935), written by Sayers specifically for the screen. This was followed by ''[[Busman's Honeymoon (film)|Busman's Honeymoon]]'' (1940), also released as ''Haunted Honeymoon'', with [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]] as Wimsey. Later, Montgomery would also play [[Raymond Chandler]]'s detective [[Philip Marlowe]] in ''[[The Lady in the Lake]]'' (1947).\n\nDoubleday's [[The Crime Club]] imprint published a variety of mystery novels that also inspired a radio show. Universal Pictures struck a deal to produce a series of 11 Crime Club mystery films released from 1937 to 1939. These include ''The Westlake Case'' (1937) and ''Mystery of the White Room'' (1939).\n\nOther literary sleuths who were brought to the screen include [[Charlie Chan]], [[Ellery Queen]], [[Nancy Drew]], [[Nero Wolfe]], and [[Agatha Christie]]'s [[Miss Marple]] and [[Hercule Poirot]]. To date, 32 films and dozens of television adaptations have been made based\n\n===Classic period: the 1930s===\n\nA few silent [[Charlie Chan]] films, now lost, were produced in the 1920s. Starting in 1929, the B-picture unit at [[Fox Film Corporation]] (later part of [[20th Century Fox]]) began a series of 28 commercially successful Charlie Chan films. ([[Monogram Pictures]] continued the series from 1944 to 1949 with 17 more entries.) The success of the Chan films led Fox to hire <!-- Lorre's original nationality is a contentious point. -->exiled actor [[Peter Lorre]] to play Japanese sleuth [[Mr. Moto]] in 8 films from 1937 to 1939. Monogram responded by creating their own gentlemanly Oriental detective, Mr. Wong, adapted from a Hugh Wiley story. Beginning with ''[[Mr. Wong, Detective]]'', [[Boris Karloff]] played Wong in 5 of 6 films produced from 1938 to 1941.\n\nOver at [[Warner Brothers]] studios, the [[Perry Mason]] novels by [[Erle Stanley Gardner]] were faithfully adapted into a series of six films from 1934 to 1937. Most of these placed the crusading attorney in a standard murder mystery whodunit story. Warner Bros. also created the [[Torchy Blane]] films which were notable for featuring one of the few female sleuths in a series. Starting with ''Smart Blonde'', [[Glenda Farrell]] played the brassy, mystery-solving news reporter in 8 of 9 films made between 1936 and 1939. Another novel film is ''[[When Were You Born]]'' (1938) with Chinese actress [[Anna May Wong]] as an astrologer who helps solve a murder using her star-gazing talents.\n\n[[RKO Pictures|RKO]] purchased the rights to a [[Hildegarde Withers]] story by [[Stuart Palmer]] and launched a six-film series starting with ''[[The Penguin Pool Murder]]'' (1932). [[Edna May Oliver]] played Withers, a schoolteacher with a yen for sleuthing who becomes involved with a police inspector. The last film was released in 1937.\n\nThe [[Philo Vance]] detective novels by [[S. S. Van Dine]] inspired 15 feature films released from 1929 to 1947. ''[[The Canary Murder Case (film)|The Canary Murder Case]]'' (1929), starring [[William Powell]] as Vance, has been called the first modern detective film. Initially made as a silent movie, it was converted into a talkie halfway through production. (Co-star [[Louise Brooks]] was blacklisted by [[Paramount Pictures]] after famously refusing to return to Hollywood to dub her dialog.) Powell played the suave New York detective in the first three films. A pre-Sherlock Holmes [[Basil Rathbone]] played Vance in the 4th movie. Powell returned once more for the fifth feature, the highly regarded ''[[The Kennel Murder Case (film)|The Kennel Murder Case]]'' (1933) produced by Warner Brothers.\n\nPowell then landed his signature role playing the equally debonair [[Nick and Nora Charles|Nick Charles]] opposite [[Myrna Loy]] as his carefree wife \"Nora\" in the ''Thin Man'' series. Six films in all were produced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] from 1934 to 1947. Based on ''[[The Thin Man]]'' novel by [[Dashiell Hammett]], these were witty, sophisticated romps that combined elements of the [[screwball comedy film]] within a complex murder mystery plot. In the middle of this series, RKO hired Powell and [[Jean Arthur]] for ''[[The Ex-Mrs. Bradford]]'' (1936), a breezy comedy-mystery that successfully replicated MGM's ''Thin Man'' formula. Warner Brothers responded with a similar comedy, ''[[Footsteps in the Dark]]'' (1941), with [[Errol Flynn]] playing a married stockbroker who leads a double life as a mystery writer/sleuth.\n\nMany of the films of this period, including the ''Thin Man'' series, concluded with an explanatory [[detective d\u00e9nouement]] that quickly became a cinematic (and literary) cliche. With the suspects gathered together, the detective would dramatically announce that \"The killer is in this very room!\" before going over the various clues that revealed the identity of the murderer.\n\nThere were also a great many low-budget \"old dark house\" mysteries based on a standard formula (a dark and stormy night, the reading of a will, secret passageways, a series of bizarre murders, etc.) that were plot- rather than star-driven. Some typical examples are ''[[The Cat Creeps]]'' (1930), a remake of ''[[The Cat and the Canary (1927 film)|The Cat and the Canary]]'', ''[[The Monster Walks]]'' (1932), ''[[Night of Terror]]'' (1933) with [[Bela Lugosi]], and ''[[One Frightened Night]]'' (1935).\n\nThe 1930s was the era of the elegant [[gentleman detective]] who solved drawing-room whodunit murders using his wits rather than his fists. Most were well-to-do amateur sleuths who solved crimes for their own amusement, carried no weapons, and often had quirky or eccentric personality traits. This type of crime-fighter fell out of fashion in the 1940s as a new breed of tough, [[hardboiled]] professional private detectives based on the novels of Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, and an ensuing slew of imitators were adapted to film.\n\n===The 1940s\u20131950s===\n[[File:LonelyPlaceTrailer.jpg|thumb|190px|''[[In a Lonely Place]]'' (1950), independently produced by [[Humphrey Bogart]]. A cynical, psychological portrait of Hollywood.]]\nWith the onset of [[World War II]], crime films and melodramas in particular suddenly took on a dark mood of cynicism and despair that had not existed in the optimistic 1930s. Eventually, this cycle of films (which cuts across several genres) would be called [[film noir]] by French film critics. Pessimistic, unheroic stories about greed, lust, and cruelty became central to the mystery genre. Grim, violent films featuring cynical, trenchcoat-wearing private detectives who were almost as ruthless as the criminals they pursued became the industry standard. The wealthy, aristocratic sleuth of the previous decade was replaced by the rough-edged, working-class gumshoe. [[Humphrey Bogart]] became the definitive cinema shamus as [[Sam Spade]] in Hammett's ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941) and as [[Philip Marlowe]] in Chandler's ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]'' (1946). [[Dick Powell]] also made an indelible impression as Marlowe in the classic ''[[Murder, My Sweet]]'' (1944), adapted from Chandler's ''[[Farewell, My Lovely]]''. ''[[The Falcon Takes Over]]'' (1942), starring [[George Sanders]], was also based on the same novel.\n\n''[[Lady in the Lake]]'' (1947), from the Raymond Chandler novel, starred [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]], who also directed. This film was filmed entirely from Marlowe's viewpoint. The audience sees only what he does. Montgomery only appears on camera a few times, once in a mirror reflection. Another Chandler novel ''[[The High Window]]'' was made into the film ''[[The Brasher Doubloon]]'' (also 1947) starring [[George Montgomery (actor)|George Montgomery]]. This was essentially a remake of ''[[Time to Kill (1942 film)|Time to Kill]]'' (1942), a Michael Shayne adventure starring [[Lloyd Nolan]]. Chandler also wrote an original screenplay for ''[[The Blue Dahlia]]'' (1946) starring [[Alan Ladd]]. ''[[The Glass Key (1942 film)|The Glass Key]]'' (1942), also starring Ladd, was the second film adaptation of Hammett's novel.\n\nAnother standout film of this period is ''[[Out of the Past]]'' (1947) starring [[Robert Mitchum]], who would go on to play Philip Marlowe three decades later. [[Otto Preminger]]'s ''[[Laura (1944 film)|Laura]]'' (1944) is also a classic murder mystery featuring [[Dana Andrews]] as a lone-wolf police detective.\n\n[[Pulp novel]] detective Nick Carter returned in a trilogy of films released by MGM starring [[Walter Pidgeon]]: ''[[Nick Carter, Master Detective (film)|Nick Carter, Master Detective]]'' (1939), ''[[Sky Murder]]'' (1940), and ''[[Phantom Raiders]]'' (1940). Columbia produced a serial, ''[[Chick Carter, Detective]]'' (1946). The lead character was changed to Nick Carter's son as the studio could not afford the rights to produce a Nick Carter serial. The whodunit novels of [[Baynard Kendrick]] about blind private detective Mac Maclain were made into two films starring [[Edward Arnold (actor)|Edward Arnold]], ''[[Eyes in the Night]]'' (1942) and ''The Hidden Eye'' (1945).\n\nThe popular radio show ''[[The Whistler]]'' was turned into a series of 8 mystery films from 1944 to 1948. [[Richard Dix (actor)|Richard Dix]] would introduce the stories and alternate between playing a hero, a villain, or a victim of circumstance. In ''[[Mysterious Intruder]]'' (1946), he was a private eye. It was one of the few series to gain acceptance with the public and critics alike. Another radio drama, [[I Love a Mystery]] (1939\u20131944), about a private detective agency, inspired three films starring [[Jim Bannon]]. [[I Love a Mystery (film)|''I Love A Mystery'']] (1945), ''[[The Devil's Mask]]'' and ''[[The Unknown (1946 film)|The Unknown]]'' (both 1946) combined offbeat murder mystery stories with atmospheric horror elements.\n\n[[Chester Morris]] played [[Boston Blackie]], a former jewel thief turned detective, in fourteen films from 1941 to 1949. Produced by [[Columbia Pictures]], many were mysteries laced with comic relief such as ''[[Meet Boston Blackie]]'' (1941), ''[[Boston Blackie Booked on Suspicion]]'' (1945), ''[[The Phantom Thief]]'' (1945), and ''[[Boston Blackie's Chinese Venture]]'' (1949). Columbia also turned the [[Crime Doctor (character)|Crime Doctor]] radio show into a series of mystery films starring [[Warner Baxter]]. Most of them followed the standard whodunit formula. Ten features were produced beginning with ''[[Crime Doctor (film)|Crime Doctor]]'' in 1943 and ending with ''[[Crime Doctor's Diary]]'' (1949).\n\nAnother popular series featured [[George Sanders]] as the suave [[The Falcon (literary character)|Falcon]]. Sixteen films were made from 1941 to 1949. Sanders decided to leave the series during the fourth entry, ''[[The Falcon's Brother]]''. His character was killed off and replaced by Sanders' real-life brother, [[Tom Conway]]. Comedian [[Red Skelton]] played inept radio detective \"The Fox\" in a trio of comedies, ''[[Whistling in the Dark (1941 film)|Whistling in the Dark]]'' (1941), ''[[Whistling in Dixie]]'' (1942), and ''[[Whistling in Brooklyn]]'' (1943).\n\n[[Brett Halliday]]'s \"[[Michael Shayne]]\" detective novels were made into a series of 12 B-movies between 1940 and 1947 (starring [[Lloyd Nolan]] and later [[Hugh Beaumont]]). [[Mickey Spillane]]'s equally rugged [[Mike Hammer]] character was adapted to film with ''[[I, the Jury]]'' (1953), ''[[My Gun is Quick]]'' (1957), and the influential ''[[Kiss Me Deadly]]'' (1955). Spillane even played Hammer once in the 1963 film ''[[The Girl Hunters]]''.\n\nWith ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] created an early psychological mystery thriller. This film, along with ''[[Fear in the Night (1947 film)|Fear in the Night]]'' (1947), explores the effects of [[amnesia]], [[hypnosis]], and [[psychoanalysis]]. Both films also feature surreal dream sequences which are essential to the plot.\n\n====Provisional detectives====\nA frequently used variation on the theme involved an average person who is suddenly forced to turn ad hoc detective in order to solve the murder of a friend or clear their own name. Prime examples include [[Jack Oakie]] in ''[[Super-Sleuth]]'' (1937), [[Ella Raines]] in ''[[Phantom Lady (film)|Phantom Lady]]'' (1944), [[Lucille Ball]] in both ''[[The Dark Corner]]'' (1946) and ''[[Lured]]'' (1947), Alan Ladd in the aforementioned ''The Blue Dahlia'' as well as ''[[Calcutta (1947 film)|Calcutta]]'' (1947), [[George Raft]] in ''[[Johnny Angel]]'' (1945), [[June Vincent]] and [[Dan Duryea]] in ''[[Black Angel (1946 film)|Black Angel]]'' (1946), Humphrey Bogart in ''[[Dead Reckoning (1947 film)|Dead Reckoning]]'' (1947), and Dick Powell in ''[[Cry Danger]]'' (1951).\n\nPerhaps the last word in this subgenre is ''[[D.O.A. (1950 film)|D.O.A.]]'' (1950), where a man dying from a slow-acting poison has to solve his own murder in the hours he has left. This film was remade in 1969 as ''[[Color Me Dead]]'' and again as ''[[D.O.A. (1988 film)|D.O.A.]]'' in 1988.\n\nAlso among this group, the issue of racism as motive for murder is central to ''[[Crossfire (film)|Crossfire]]'' (1947), ''[[Bad Day at Black Rock]]'' (1954), and ''[[A Soldier's Story]]'' (1984).\n\n====''Ten Little Indians''====\nAgatha Christie's novel ''[[Ten Little Indians (novel)|Ten Little Indians]]'' (1939, originally ''Ten Little Niggers'', later changed again to ''And Then There Were None'') presented the concept of a mysterious killer preying on a group of strangers trapped at an isolated location (in this case, Indian Island). This was made into ''[[And Then There Were None (1945 film)|And Then There Were None]]'' (1945), directed by the French exile [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]]. Three more film versions, all titled ''Ten Little Indians'', were released in 1965, 1974, and 1989 along with the 1987 Russian film ''[[Desyat Negrityat]]''.\n\nThis premise has been used countless times, especially in \"old dark house\" genre horror films. A few examples include ''[[Five Dolls for an August Moon]]'' (1970) directed by [[Mario Bava]], ''[[Identity (film)|Identity]]'' (2003), ''Mindhunters'' (2004), made-for-television films (''[[Dead Man's Island]]'', 1996), a miniseries (''[[Harper's Island]]'', 2009), and episodic television such as ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' (\"The Superlative Seven\"), ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'' (\"The Night of The Tottering Tontine\") both from 1967, and ''[[Remington Steele]]'' (\"Steele Trap\") in 1982.\n\n===Revival and revisionist era: 1960s\u20131970s===\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw a [[neo-noir]] resurgence of the hardboiled detective film (and gritty police drama), based on the classic films of the past. These fall into three basic categories: modern updates of old films and novels, atmospheric [[period piece]] films set in the 1930s and 1940s, and new, contemporary detective stories that pay homage to the past.\n\n====Classics made contemporary====\nVeteran private eye Philip Marlowe returned as a modern-day sleuth in ''[[Marlowe (film)|Marlowe]]'' (1969) played by [[James Garner]] (based on Chandler's ''The Little Sister''), and in [[Robert Altman]]'s revisionist ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973) played by [[Elliott Gould]]. [[Robert Mitchum]] played Marlowe in the remake of ''[[The Big Sleep (1978 film)|The Big Sleep]]'' (1978) set in contemporary London. [[Paul Newman]] portrays a modernized [[Lew Archer]] (changed to Harper) in ''[[Harper (film)|Harper]]'' (1966) and ''[[The Drowning Pool]]'' (1976), based on [[Ross Macdonald]]'s 1949\u201350 novels.\n\n[[Craig Stevens (actor)|Craig Stevens]] reprised his role as suave private eye Peter Gunn in ''[[Gunn (film)|Gunn]]'' (1967), a sixties-mod update of his atmospheric, film noir ''[[Peter Gunn]]'' TV series (1958\u201361). Bulldog Drummond returned as a contemporary sleuth in ''[[Deadlier Than the Male]]'' (1967) and ''[[Some Girls Do]]'' (1969). Both films were produced in the extravagant style of a [[James Bond]] espionage yarn. The remake of ''[[I, the Jury]]'' (1982) brought back Mike Hammer (revived again in the 1984\u201387 television series, ''[[Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer (1984 TV series)|Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer]]''). ''[[Kiss Kiss Bang Bang]]'' (2005) is a modernized adaptation of [[Brett Halliday]]'s 1941 [[Michael Shayne]] novel ''Bodies Are Where You Find Them''.\n\nThe old-fashioned whodunit formula from the 1930s was given a fresh update in ''[[The List of Adrian Messenger]]'' (1963), ''[[Sleuth (1972 film)|Sleuth]]'' (1972), ''[[The Last of Sheila]]'' (1973), and the comedy ''[[Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?]]'' (1978).\n\nThe early films of [[Brian De Palma]] include the slasher comedy ''[[Murder a la Mod]]'' (1968), the Hitchcock-inspired ''[[Sisters (1973 film)|Sisters]]'' (1973), and ''[[Obsession (1976 film)|Obsession]]'' (1976), a remake of Hitchcock's 1958 classic ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''. The influence of Hitchcock emerged in several French thrillers, especially ''[[The Champagne Murders]]'' (1967) directed by [[Claude Chabrol]] and ''[[The Bride Wore Black]]'' (1968) by [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]].\n\n====Period films====\nThe many period films set in the 1930s and 1940s are led by [[Roman Polanski]]'s classic ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'' (1974) starring [[Jack Nicholson]] and its belated sequel, ''[[The Two Jakes]]'' (1990), which Nicholson also directed. Robert Mitchum played Marlowe for the first time in ''[[Farewell, My Lovely]]'' (1975), perhaps the most faithful adaptation of this often-filmed book. The obscure ''Chandler'' (1972) is set in the 1940s but has nothing to do with Raymond Chandler's writings. The television film ''Goodnight, My Love'' (1972) with [[Richard Boone]] and two short-lived TV series, ''[[Banyon]]'' (1972\u201373) and ''[[City of Angels (1976 series)|City of Angels]]'' (1976) were also set in the 1930s and pay tribute to the Sam Spade/Philip Marlowe model. And the television film ''Who Is the Black Dahlia?'' (1975) recreates the true unsolved murder case from 1947.\n\nAgatha Christie's elegant ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1974) and ''[[Death on the Nile (1978 film)|Death on the Nile]]'' (1978) were colorful, lavish productions rich in 1930s period detail. Earlier, a series of lighthearted Miss Marple mysteries were loosely adapted from Christie's novels. [[Margaret Rutherford]] starred in ''[[Murder, She Said]]'' (1961), ''[[Murder Most Foul]]'' (1964), ''[[Murder Ahoy!]]'' (1965), and did a humorous cameo appearance as Marple in the [[Hercule Poirot]] mystery ''[[The Alphabet Murders]]'' (1965).\n\nThe evergreen Sherlock Holmes was given a revisionist treatment in [[Billy Wilder]]'s ''[[The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes]]'' (1970). In ''[[The Seven Percent Solution]]'' (1976), Dr. [[Sigmund Freud]] himself cures Holmes of his drug addiction. And two films, ''[[A Study in Terror]]'' (1965) and ''[[Murder by Decree]]'' (1979), which includes scenes of lurid gore, put Holmes in pursuit of the mysterious real-life serial murderer [[Jack the Ripper]]. The definitive and most faithful adaptation of the original stories was done by the British TV series [[Sherlock Holmes (1984 TV series)|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]] starring [[Jeremy Brett]] as Holmes and [[David Burke (British actor)|David Burke]] as Watson, in 41 episodes which ran from 1984\u20131994.\n\nLater Holmes films are often inventions that have little or nothing to do with the original Arthur Conan Doyle stories, such as ''[[Young Sherlock Holmes]]'' (1985), produced by [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[Amblin Entertainment]], which puts the teenage sleuth in an action-adventure story replete with computer-generated special effects. The reinvention of Holmes has continued as evidenced by the revamped, big-budget Warner Bros. series directed by [[Guy Ritchie]]. In ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' (2009) and ''[[Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows]]'' (2011), the cerebral detective (played by [[Robert Downey, Jr.]]) is transformed into an athletic (and romantic) action hero in a [[steampunk]] fantasy version of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] England.\n\n====The New Wave====\nThe New Wave of modern detective films may well begin with [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s offbeat ''[[Alphaville (film)|Alphaville]]'' (1965) with its traditional, raincoat-and-fedora private eye placed in a futuristic, science fiction-based story. The film is part homage, part parody of the detective genre. Godard followed this with ''[[Made in U.S.A. (1966 film)|Made in U.S.A.]]'' (1966), an ironic, unconventional murder mystery of sorts that lightly references the [[Howard Hawks]] classic ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]''.\n\n[[Frank Sinatra]] is a cynical, Bogart-like gumshoe in ''[[Tony Rome]]'' (1967) and its sequel ''[[Lady in Cement]]'' (1968) \u2014 and a tough police investigator in ''[[The Detective (1968 film)|The Detective]]'' (1968). [[John D. MacDonald]] wrote 21 [[Travis McGee]] novels, but only one, ''[[Darker than Amber (film)|Darker than Amber]]'' (1970) was filmed. [[George Peppard]] is a traditional private detective in ''[[P.J. (film)|P.J.]]'' (1968). [[Kirk Douglas]] is an ex-cop turned private sleuth/body guard in the more light-hearted ''[[A Lovely Way to Die]]'' (1968). [[Robert Culp]] and [[Bill Cosby]] are hard-luck private eyes in the downbeat and violent ''[[Hickey & Boggs]]'' (1972). [[Burt Reynolds]] plays a tongue-in-cheek ''[[Shamus (film)|Shamus]]'' (1973), and [[Burt Lancaster]] is a retired cop turned sleuth in ''[[The Midnight Man (1974 film)|The Midnight Man]]'' (1974). Two of the finest examples star [[Gene Hackman]] in ''[[The Conversation]]'' (1974) and ''[[Night Moves (1975 film)|Night Moves]]'' (1975).\n\nThe [[blaxploitation]] B-movie industry adopted the standard private detective format for several action-mysteries such as ''[[Trouble Man (film)|Trouble Man]]'' (1972), ''[[Black Eye]]'' (1974), ''[[Sheba, Baby]]'' (1975) starring [[Pam Grier]], and ''[[Velvet Smooth]]'' (1976).\n\n''[[Brick (film)|Brick]]'' (2005), written and directed by [[Rian Johnson]], is a unique homage bordering on parody which brings the terse, slang-filled dialog of Raymond Chandler to a modern-day California high school where a teenage sleuth investigates a murder connected to a drug ring.\n\nNoteworthy '''police detective dramas''' of the period include The French film ''[[The Sleeping Car Murders]]'' (1965), ''[[In the Heat of the Night (film)|In the Heat of the Night]]'' (winner of five [[Academy Awards]], including Best Picture in 1967), ''[[Bullitt]]'', ''[[Madigan]]'' (both 1968), ''[[Klute]]'' (1971), ''[[Electra Glide in Blue]]'' (1973), and two non-mysteries: ''[[Dirty Harry]]'', and ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (both 1971). ''[[The Parallax View]]'' (1974) is the first murder mystery structured around political assassinations and high-level conspiracies in America.\n\n====Memory loss mysteries====\n\nUsing [[amnesia]] as a central plot device in mysteries began in 1936 with ''[[Two in the Dark]]'' (remade as ''[[Two O'Clock Courage]]'', 1945),\nfollowed by ''[[Crossroads (1942 film)|Crossroads]]'' (1942) starring [[William Powell]], ''[[Crime Doctor (film)|Crime Doctor]]'' (1943), ''[[The Power of the Whistler]]'' (1945), and ''[[Somewhere in the Night (film)|Somewhere in the Night]]'' (1946).\n\nIn the 1960s amnesia stories had a resurgence in the mystery-thriller genre. Here the protagonist loses his pre-existing memories after some mental or physical trauma and embarks on a quest to recover his identity. At the same time he finds himself at the center of a mysterious conspiracy involving murder, espionage, or both. Films in this category include ''[[Mirage (1965 film)|Mirage]]'' with [[Gregory Peck]], ''[[The Third Day]]'' starring [[George Peppard]], the British film ''[[Hysteria (1965 film)|Hysteria]]'' from [[Hammer Films]] (all from 1965), ''[[Mister Buddwing]]'' (1966) with [[James Garner]], and ''[[Jigsaw (1968 film)|Jigsaw]]'' (1968), a remake of ''Mirage''.\n\nConcurrently, the hero-gets-amnesia story became a frequently used television cliche (see [[TV Tropes]]). There were two series, the western ''[[A Man Called Shenandoah]]'' (1965\u20131966), and the contemporary drama ''[[Coronet Blue]]'' (filmed 1965, broadcast 1967), both about a man with no memories. Numerous crime-dramas, adventure shows, and comedies featured episodes in which the lead character has temporary amnesia. These include ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'', ''[[The Munsters]]'' (both 1965),''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' (1966), ''[[Get Smart]]'' (1967), ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'', ''[[The Big Valley]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' (all from 1968), ''[[It Takes a Thief (1968 TV series)|It Takes a Thief]]'' (1969), ''[[The Mod Squad]]'' (1971), ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' (1972), ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' (1973), and ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' (1978). By the end of the 1970s, this now shop-worn plot device became dormant once again until resurfacing in a spate of mystery thrillers in the 1990s (see the ''Psychological thriller'' section below).\n\n====Italian Giallo thrillers====\nIn Italy, a new type of controversial horror-based thriller called the [[Giallo]] film (which began in the 1960s) became a popular and influential genre by the early 1970s. Films in this category range from police procedurals to gothic horror. The stories tend to center around a series of grisly murder sequences with shocking ''[[grand guignol]]'' style gore, sometimes mixed with sadistic eroticism (the victims often being beautiful women). The villains are usually mysterious, psychopathic [[serial killer]]s (often wearing masks or disguises) who are eventually hunted down by the police and/or an average person turned sleuth. The first important film in this genre is ''[[Blood and Black Lace]]'' (1964) directed by [[Mario Bava]].\n\nSome examples that follow a standard murder mystery format include ''[[Five Dolls for an August Moon]]'' (1970) by Mario Bava, three by director [[Dario Argento]]: ''[[The Cat o' Nine Tails]]'', ''[[Four Flies on Grey Velvet]]'' (both 1971), and ''[[Deep Red]]'' (1975) \u2013 as well as ''[[A Lizard in a Woman's Skin]]'' (1971), ''[[The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh]]'' (1971), ''[[Black Belly of the Tarantula]]'' (1971), ''[[Who Saw Her Die?]]'' (1972), ''[[What Have You Done to Solange?]]'' (1972), ''[[Casa d'appuntamento]]'' (aka ''The French Sex Murders'', 1972), and ''[[The Red Queen Kills Seven Times]]'' (1972).\n\nThe Giallo style has had an enduring influence on horror films in general as well as the subgenre [[slasher film|slasher]] and [[splatter film]]s that would soon follow. Early examples of this influence can be seen in the British ''[[Circus of Fear]]'' (1966), based on a [[Edgar Wallace]] novel, ''[[Berserk!]]'' (1967), and the American mystery-thrillers ''[[No Way to Treat a Lady (film)|No Way to Treat a Lady]]'' (1968), ''[[Klute]]'' (1971), ''[[Pretty Maids All in a Row]]'' (1971), based on an Italian novel, ''[[Eyes of Laura Mars]]'' (1978), and Hitchcock's ''[[Frenzy]]'' (1972).\n\n====From ''Blowup'' to ''Blow Out''====\nOne mystery film stands out in a category by itself. [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s provocative ''[[Blowup]]'' (1966) is a unique anti-whodunit symbolizing the aimless hedonism of the 1960s. A [[swinging London]] photographer uncovers clues to a murder, but solving the crime is rendered irrelevant in a society where no one really cares. This contrasts sharply with the ending of ''The Maltese Falcon'' where Sam Spade solves the murder of his partner, Miles Archer. He sacrifices the woman he's fallen for, not because he was fond of Archer (he wasn't), but because it's the right thing to do.\n\nIn 1981, [[Brian De Palma]] remade this as ''[[Blow Out]]'', turning it into a more traditional political thriller. In the DVD audio commentary for ''The Conversation'', director [[Francis Ford Coppola]] revealed that ''Blowup'' was a major source of inspiration for that film.\n\n''[[Electra Glide in Blue]]'' (1973) is another rare example of a murder-mystery plot used as a vehicle for a story concerning greater issues. In this case, disillusionment and the death of dreams and idealism in a world full of immorality.\n\n===The 1980s to the present===\nSince the mid-1970s, only a handful of films with private detectives have been produced. These include ''[[I, the Jury (1982 film)|I, the Jury]]'', ''[[Angel Heart]]'', ''Hollywood Harry'', ''[[The Two Jakes]]'', ''[[Devil in a Blue Dress (film)|Devil in a Blue Dress]]'', ''[[Pure Luck]]'', ''[[Under Suspicion (2000 film)|Under Suspicion]]'', ''[[Twilight (1998 film)|Twilight]]'' with [[Paul Newman]], and [[Ben Affleck]]'s ''[[Gone Baby Gone]]''.\n\nRaymond Chandler's original Philip Marlowe short stories from the '30s (which he later expanded into novels) were adapted by the [[HBO]] cable network into eleven one-hour episodes for cable television. The series, ''Philip Marlowe: Private Eye'' (1983\u20131986), starred [[Powers Boothe]] as the hard-bitten detective.\n\nFilms with female detectives have not fared well. [[Kathleen Turner]] as private eye ''[[V.I. Warshawski]]'' (1991), was to be the start of a new franchise based on the book series by [[Sara Paretsky]], but the film was a box-office failure. Plans to turn the ''[[Honey West (TV series)|Honey West]]'' novels into a film have been in and out of development for over a decade with no film in sight.\n\nSince 1980, ten films based on the ever-popular novels of Agatha Christie have been released. Two with eccentric sleuth Hercule Poirot, ''[[Evil Under the Sun]]'' (1982), ''[[Appointment with Death]]'' (1988), and one with Miss Marple ''[[The Mirror Crack'd]]'' (1980). Christie herself became the subject of a mystery film in 1979's ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' starring [[Vanessa Redgrave]]. The film was a fictional speculation on her famous 11-day disappearance in 1926.\n\n====Military mysteries and police procedurals====\nComplex murder mysteries related to military men began with ''[[Crossfire (film)|Crossfire]]'' (1947). More recent examples include ''[[A Soldier's Story]]'' (1984), ''[[No Way Out (1987 film)|No Way Out]]'' (1987), ''[[The Presidio]]'' (1988), ''[[A Few Good Men (film)|A Few Good Men]]'' (1992), ''[[Courage Under Fire]]'' (1996), ''[[The General's Daughter (film)|The General's Daughter]]'' (1999), and ''[[Basic (film)|Basic]]'' (2003).\n\nThe [[police procedural]] film, often with a surprise twist ending, has also remained a vital format with ''[[Cruising (film)|Cruising]]'' (1980), ''[[Gorky Park (film)|Gorky Park]]'' (1983), ''[[Tightrope (film)|Tightrope]]'' (1984), ''[[The Dead Pool]]'' (1988), ''[[Mississippi Burning]]'' (1988), ''[[Mortal Thoughts]]'' (1991), ''[[Rising Sun (film)|Rising Sun]]'' (1993), ''[[Striking Distance]]'' (1993), ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' (1995), ''[[Lone Star (1996 film)|Lone Star]]'' (1996), ''[[Under Suspicion (2000 film)|Under Suspicion]]'' (2000), ''[[Blood Work (film)|Blood Work]]'' (2002), ''[[Mystic River (film)|Mystic River]]'' (2003), ''[[Mindhunters]]''<ref>http://www.allmovie.com/work/mindhunters-285906</ref> (2004), ''[[In the Valley of Elah]]'' (2007), and ''[[Righteous Kill]]'' (2008).\n\nThe [[political thriller]] involving murder, cover-ups, and high-level conspiracies is represented by such films as ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (1991), ''[[Murder at 1600]]'' (1997), ''[[Enemy of the State (film)|Enemy of the State]]'' (1998), ''[[State of Play (film)|State of Play]]'' (2009), and ''[[Madras Cafe]]'' (2013).\n\n====Horror and thriller====\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, many horror films and thrillers started to blend mystery and suspense into stories centered around clever, sociopathic serial killers or various mysterious supernatural occurrences. The [[Hannibal Lecter]] novels by [[Thomas Harris]] have inspired four films, ''[[Manhunter (film)|Manhunter]]'' (1986), the Academy Award-winning ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991), ''[[Hannibal (2001 film)|Hannibal]]'' (2001), and ''[[Red Dragon (2002 film)|Red Dragon]]'' (2002).\n\nOther films in which this blend occurs include ''[[When the Bough Breaks (1993 film)|When the Bough Breaks]]'' (1994), ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' (1995), ''[[Kiss the Girls (1997 film)|Kiss the Girls]]'' (1997), adapted from the [[James Patterson]] novel, ''[[The Bone Collector]]'' (1999), ''[[Mercy (2000 film)|Mercy]]'' (2000), ''[[Along Came a Spider (film)|Along Came a Spider]]'' (2001), also by Patterson, ''[[Insomnia (2002 film)|Insomnia]]'' (2002), and ''[[Taking Lives (film)|Taking Lives]]'' (2004).\n\nThe 2007 film ''[[Zodiac (film)|Zodiac]]'' is an account of the real hunt for a serial killer in the San Francisco area in the late-1960s and early 1970s. Contemporary real-life serial killings have been portrayed in ''[[The Alphabet Killer]]'', ''[[In the Light of the Moon|Ed Gein]]'', ''[[Gacy (film)|Gacy]]'', ''[[Ted Bundy (film)|Ted Bundy]]'' and ''[[Dahmer (film)|Dahmer]]''. The French period-piece film ''[[Brotherhood of the Wolf]]'' (2001) examines a series of killings that took place in France in the 18th century.\n\nIn many modern day mystery films, everyday characters (such as fathers, mothers, teens, business people, etc.) are dragged into a dangerous conflict or a mysterious situation, either by [[Destiny|fate]] or their own curiosity. Common elements in these stories include searching for a [[missing person]] (a friend or family member) as in ''[[Flightplan]]'' (2005) with [[Jodie Foster]], while being surrounded by [[red herring]]s, espionage, criminal or political conspiracies, and friends/relatives with a secret past or a double life.\n\nSuch films include the horror mysteries [[Scream (franchise)|''Scream'' and its sequels]] (1996\u20132011), [[Saw (franchise)|the ''Saw'' franchise]] (2004\u20132010), ''[[The Orphanage (2007 film)|The Orphanage]]'' (2006), ''[[What Lies Beneath]]'' (2000), ''[[Cry Wolf (2005 film)|Cry Wolf]]'' (2005), ''[[Devil (2010 film)|Devil]]'' (2010), ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'' (2002) and the mystery thrillers ''[[Secret Window]]'' (2004), ''[[The Machinist]]'' (2004), ''[[The Forgotten (2004 film)|The Forgotten]]'' (2005), ''[[The Number 23]]'' (2006),<ref>http://www.allmovie.com/work/the-number-23-336722</ref> and ''[[Identity (film)|Identity]]'' (2003).\n\nThe [[retrograde amnesia]] plot also resurfaced in a new wave of mysteries where discovering the lead character's true identity and/or history forms the core of the story. Main examples include: ''[[The Morning After (1986 film)|The Morning After]]'' (1986), ''[[Shattered (1991 film)|Shattered]]'' (1991), ''[[The Long Kiss Goodnight]]'' (1996), ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'' (2000),<ref>http://www.allmovie.com/work/memento-220920</ref> the [[Bourne (film series)|''Bourne'' film series]] (2002\u20132012), and ''[[Shutter Island (film)|Shutter Island]]'' (2010). [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s highly stylized ''[[Dead Again]]'' (1991) pays homage to Hitchcock and [[Orson Welles]] in a complex story of amnesia, hypnosis, and reincarnation. There are also science fiction thrillers such as ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990), [[Total Recall (2012 film)|remade]] in 2012, and ''[[Paycheck (film)|Paycheck]]'' (2003) which center around technology-induced memory loss.\n\n====Revisionist period piece films====\nPeriod-piece L.A. police detective stories set in the 1940s and 1950s returned \u2014 with a harder edge and occasional parallels to contemporary issues \u2014 in ''[[Mulholland Falls]]'' (1996), and ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'' (1997) which was nominated for nine [[Academy Awards]] and won two.
