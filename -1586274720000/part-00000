{"title_page": "C*-algebra", "text_new": "{{Use American English|date=January 2019}}{{Short description|Topological complex vector space\n}}\n{{refimprove|date=February 2013}}\n'''C<sup>\u2217</sup>-algebras''' <!-- \"C*\" is almost fine, but some fonts render the star like \u2217, i.e., not superscirpt, nor small. -->(pronounced \"C-star\") are subjects of research in [[functional analysis]], a branch of [[mathematics]].  A C*-algebra is a [[Banach algebra]] together with an involution satisfying the properties of the [[Hermitian_adjoint|adjoint]]. A particular case is that of a [[complex number|complex]] [[algebra over a field|algebra]] ''A'' of [[continuous linear operator]]s on a [[complex number|complex]] [[Hilbert space]] with two additional properties:\n\n* ''A'' is a topologically [[closed set]] in the [[norm topology]] of operators.\n* ''A'' is closed under the operation of taking [[adjoint of an operator|adjoint]]s of operators.\n\nAnother important class of non-Hilbert C*-algebra include the algebra of continuous functions <math>C_0(X)</math>.\n\nC*-algebras were first considered primarily for their use in [[quantum mechanics]] to [[model (abstract)|model]] algebras of physical [[observable]]s.  This line of research began with [[Werner Heisenberg]]'s [[matrix mechanics]] and in a more mathematically developed form with [[Pascual Jordan]] around 1933.  Subsequently, [[John von Neumann]] attempted to establish a general framework for these algebras which culminated in a series of papers on rings of operators.  These papers considered a special class of C*-algebras which are now known as [[von Neumann algebra]]s.\n\nAround 1943, the work of [[Israel Gelfand]] and [[Mark Naimark]] yielded an abstract characterisation of C*-algebras making no reference to operators on a Hilbert space.\n\nC*-algebras are now an important tool in the theory of [[unitary representation]]s of [[locally compact group]]s, and are also used in algebraic formulations of quantum mechanics. Another active area of research is the program to obtain classification, or to determine the extent of which classification is possible, for separable simple [[nuclear C*-algebra]]s.\n\n== Abstract characterization ==\n\nWe begin with the abstract characterization of C*-algebras given in the 1943 paper by Gelfand and Naimark.\n\nA C*-algebra, ''A'', is a [[Banach algebra]] over the field of [[complex number]]s, together with a [[Map (mathematics)|map]] <math display=\"inline\"> x \\mapsto x^* </math> for <math display=\"inline\"> x\\in A</math>     with the following properties:\n\n* It is an [[Semigroup with involution|involution]], for every ''x'' in ''A'':\n::<math> x^{**} = (x^*)^* =  x </math>\n\n* For all ''x'', ''y'' in ''A'':\n::<math> (x + y)^* = x^* + y^* </math>\n::<math> (x y)^* = y^* x^*</math>\n\n* For every complex number \u03bb in '''C''' and every ''x'' in ''A'':\n::<math> (\\lambda x)^* = \\overline{\\lambda} x^* .</math>\n\n* For all ''x'' in ''A'':\n::<math>  \\|x^* x \\| = \\|x\\|\\|x^*\\|.</math>\n\n'''Remark.''' The first three identities say that ''A'' is a [[*-algebra]]. The last identity is called the '''C* identity''' and is equivalent to:\n\n<math>\\|xx^*\\| = \\|x\\|^2,</math>\n\nwhich is sometimes called the B*-identity. For history behind the names C*- and B*-algebras, see the [[#Some_history:_B.2A-algebras_and_C.2A-algebras|history]] section below.\n\nThe C*-identity is a very strong requirement. For instance, together with the [[spectral radius|spectral radius formula]], it implies that the C*-norm is uniquely determined by the algebraic structure:\n\n::<math> \\|x\\|^2 = \\|x^* x\\| = \\sup\\{|\\lambda| : x^* x - \\lambda \\,1 \\text{ is not invertible} \\}.</math>\n\nA [[bounded linear map]], ''\u03c0'' : ''A'' \u2192 ''B'', between C*-algebras ''A'' and ''B'' is called a '''*-homomorphism''' if\n\n* For ''x'' and ''y'' in ''A''\n\n::<math> \\pi(x y) = \\pi(x) \\pi(y) \\,</math>\n\n* For ''x'' in ''A''\n\n::<math> \\pi(x^*) = \\pi(x)^* \\,</math>\n\nIn the case of C*-algebras, any *-homomorphism ''\u03c0'' between C*-algebras is [[Contraction (operator theory)|contractive]], i.e. bounded with norm \u2264 1. Furthermore, an injective *-homomorphism between C*-algebras is [[isometry|isometric]]. These are consequences of the C*-identity.\n\nA bijective *-homomorphism ''\u03c0'' is called a '''C*-isomorphism''', in which case ''A'' and ''B'' are said to be '''isomorphic'''.\n\n== Some history: B*-algebras and C*-algebras ==\nThe term B*-algebra was introduced by C. E. Rickart in 1946 to describe [[Banach *-algebra]]s that satisfy the condition:\n\n* <math>\\lVert x x^* \\rVert = \\lVert x \\rVert ^2</math> for all ''x'' in the given B*-algebra. (B*-condition)\n\nThis condition automatically implies that the *-involution is isometric, that is, <math>\\lVert x \\rVert = \\lVert x^* \\rVert </math>. Hence, <math>\\lVert xx^*\\rVert = \\lVert x \\rVert \\lVert x^*\\rVert</math>, and therefore, a B*-algebra is also a C*-algebra. Conversely, the C*-condition implies the B*-condition. This is nontrivial, and can be proved without using the condition <math>\\lVert x \\rVert = \\lVert x^* \\rVert</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Doran|Belfi|1986|pp=5\u20136}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6jNbsnJVjMoC&pg=PA5 Google Books].</ref> For these reasons, the term B*-algebra is rarely used in current terminology, and has been replaced by the term 'C*-algebra'.\n\nThe term C*-algebra was introduced by [[Irving Segal|I. E. Segal]] in 1947 to describe norm-closed subalgebras of ''B''(''H''), namely, the space of bounded operators on some Hilbert space ''H''. 'C' stood for 'closed'.<ref>{{harvnb|Doran|Belfi|1986|p=6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6jNbsnJVjMoC&pg=PA6 Google Books].</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Segal|1947}}</ref> In his paper Segal defines a C*-algebra as a \"uniformly closed, self-adjoint algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space\".<ref>{{harvnb|Segal|1947|p=75}}</ref>\n\n== Structure of C*-algebras ==\n\nC*-algebras have a large number of properties that are technically convenient. Some of these properties can be established by using the [[continuous functional calculus]] or by reduction to commutative  C*-algebras.  In the latter case, we can use the fact that the structure of these is completely determined by the [[Gelfand isomorphism]].\n\n=== Self-adjoint elements ===\n\nSelf-adjoint elements are those of the form ''x''=''x''*. The set of elements of a C*-algebra ''A'' of the form ''x*x'' forms a closed [[convex cone]].  This cone is identical to the elements of the form ''xx*''. Elements of this cone are called ''non-negative'' (or sometimes ''positive'', even though this terminology conflicts with its use for elements of '''R'''.)\n\nThe set of self-adjoint elements of a C*-algebra ''A'' naturally has the structure of a [[partial order|partially ordered]] [[vector space]]; the ordering is usually denoted \u2265. In this ordering, a self-adjoint element ''x'' of ''A'' satisfies ''x'' \u2265 0 if and only if the [[Spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] of ''x''  is non-negative,{{clarify|Under the Gelfand representation?|date=August 2014}} if and only if ''x'' = ''s*s'' for some ''s''. Two self-adjoint elements ''x'' and ''y'' of ''A'' satisfy ''x'' \u2265 ''y'' if ''x''\u2212''y'' \u2265 0.\n\nThis partially ordered subspace allows the definition of a [[positive linear functional]] on a C*-algebra, which in turn is used to define the [[State (functional analysis)|states]] of a C*-algebra, which in turn can be used to construct the [[spectrum of a C*-algebra]] using the [[GNS construction]].\n\n=== Quotients and approximate identities ===\n\nAny C*-algebra ''A'' has an [[approximate identity]].  In fact, there is a directed family {''e''<sub>\u03bb</sub>}<sub>\u03bb\u2208I</sub> of self-adjoint elements of ''A'' such that\n\n:: <math> x e_\\lambda \\rightarrow x </math>\n:: <math> 0 \\leq e_\\lambda \\leq e_\\mu \\leq 1\\quad \\mbox{ whenever } \\lambda \\leq \\mu. </math>\n\n: In case ''A'' is separable, ''A'' has a sequential approximate identity. More generally, ''A'' will have a sequential approximate identity if and only if ''A'' contains a '''[[Hereditary C*-subalgebra|strictly positive element]]''', i.e. a positive element ''h'' such that ''hAh'' is dense in ''A''.\n\nUsing approximate identities, one can show that the algebraic [[quotient]] of a C*-algebra by a closed proper two-sided [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]], with the natural norm, is a C*-algebra.\n\nSimilarly, a closed two-sided ideal of a C*-algebra is itself a C*-algebra.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Finite-dimensional C*-algebras ===\nThe algebra M(''n'', '''C''') of ''n'' \u00d7 ''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] over '''C''' becomes a C*-algebra if we consider matrices as operators on the Euclidean space, '''C'''<sup>''n''</sup>, and  use the [[operator norm]] ||&middot;|| on matrices. The involution is given by the [[conjugate transpose]].  More generally, one can consider finite [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]]s of matrix algebras. In fact, all C*-algebras that are finite dimensional as vector spaces are of this form, up to isomorphism. The self-adjoint requirement means finite-dimensional C*-algebras are [[Semisimple algebra|semisimple]], from which fact one can deduce the following theorem of [[Artin\u2013Wedderburn theorem|Artin\u2013Wedderburn]] type:\n\n<blockquote>'''Theorem.'''  A finite-dimensional C*-algebra, ''A'', is [[Canonical form|canonically]] isomorphic to a finite direct sum\n:<math> A = \\bigoplus_{e \\in \\min A } A e</math>\nwhere min ''A'' is the set of minimal nonzero self-adjoint central projections of ''A''.</blockquote>\n\nEach C*-algebra, ''Ae'', is isomorphic (in a noncanonical way) to the full matrix algebra M(dim(''e''), '''C'''). The finite family indexed on min ''A'' given by {dim(''e'')}<sub>''e''</sub> is called the ''dimension vector'' of ''A''.  This vector uniquely determines the isomorphism class of a finite-dimensional C*-algebra. In the language of [[operator K-theory|K-theory]], this vector is the [[ordered group|positive cone]] of the ''K''<sub>0</sub> group of ''A''.\n\nA '''\u2020-algebra''' (or, more explicitly, a ''\u2020-closed algebra'') is the name occasionally used in [[physics]]<ref>John A. Holbrook, David W. Kribs, and Raymond Laflamme. \"Noiseless Subsystems and the Structure of the Commutant in Quantum Error Correction.\" ''Quantum Information Processing''. Volume 2, Number 5, pp. 381&ndash;419.  Oct 2003.</ref> for a finite-dimensional C*-algebra.  The [[dagger (typography)|dagger]], \u2020, is used in the name because physicists typically use the symbol to denote a [[Hermitian adjoint]], and are often not worried about the subtleties associated with an infinite number of dimensions.  (Mathematicians usually use the asterisk, *, to denote the Hermitian adjoint.) \u2020-algebras feature prominently in [[quantum mechanics]], and especially [[quantum information science]].\n\nAn immediate generalization of finite dimensional C*-algebras are the [[approximately finite dimensional C*-algebra]]s.\n\n=== C*-algebras of operators ===\nThe prototypical example of a C*-algebra is the algebra ''B(H)'' of bounded (equivalently continuous) [[linear operator]]s defined on a complex [[Hilbert space]] ''H''; here ''x*'' denotes the [[adjoint operator]] of the operator ''x'' : ''H'' \u2192 ''H''. In fact, every C*-algebra, ''A'', is *-isomorphic to a norm-closed adjoint closed subalgebra of ''B''(''H'') for a suitable Hilbert space, ''H''; this is the content of the [[Gelfand\u2013Naimark theorem]].\n\n=== C*-algebras of compact operators ===\nLet ''H'' be a [[separable space|separable]] infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. The algebra ''K''(''H'') of [[Compact operator on Hilbert space|compact operator]]s on ''H'' is a [[norm closed]] subalgebra of ''B''(''H''). It is also closed under involution; hence it is a  C*-algebra.\n\nConcrete C*-algebras of compact operators admit a characterization similar to Wedderburn's theorem for finite dimensional C*-algebras:\n\n<blockquote>'''Theorem.'''

A C*-algebra is a [[Banach algebra]] together with an involution satisfying the properties of the [[Hermitian_adjoint|adjoint]]. A particular case is that of a [[complex number|complex]] [[algebra over a field|algebra]] ''A'' of [[continuous linear operator]]s on a [[complex number|complex]] [[Hilbert space]] with two additional properties:\n\n* ''A'' is a topologically [[closed set]] in the [[norm topology]] of operators.\n* ''A'' is closed under the operation of taking [[adjoint of an operator|adjoint]]s of operators.\n\nAnother important class of non-Hilbert C*-algebra include the algebra of continuous functions <math>C_0(X)</math>.\n\nC*-algebras were first considered primarily for their use in [[quantum mechanics]] to [[model (abstract)|model]] algebras of physical [[observable]]s.  This line of research began with [[Werner Heisenberg]]'s [[matrix mechanics]] and in a more mathematically developed form with [[Pascual Jordan]] around 1933.  Subsequently, [[John von Neumann]] attempted to establish a general framework for these algebras which culminated in a series of papers on rings of operators.  These papers considered a special class of C*-algebras which are now known as [[von Neumann algebra]]s.\n\nAround 1943, the work of [[Israel Gelfand]] and [[Mark Naimark]] yielded an abstract characterisation of C*-algebras making no reference to operators on a Hilbert space.\n\nC*-algebras are now an important tool in the theory of [[unitary representation]]s of [[locally compact group]]s, and are also used in algebraic formulations of quantum mechanics. Another active area of research is the program to obtain classification, or to determine the extent of which classification is possible, for separable simple [[nuclear C*-algebra]]s.\n\n== Abstract characterization ==\n\nWe begin with the abstract characterization of C*-algebras given in the 1943 paper by Gelfand and Naimark.\n\nA C*-algebra, ''A'', is a [[Banach algebra]] over the field of [[complex number]]s, together with a [[Map (mathematics)|map]] <math display=\"inline\"> x \\mapsto x^* </math> for <math display=\"inline\"> x\\in A</math>     with the following properties:\n\n* It is an [[Semigroup with involution|involution]], for every ''x'' in ''A'':\n::<math> x^{**} = (x^*)^* =  x </math>\n\n* For all ''x'', ''y'' in ''A'':\n::<math> (x + y)^* = x^* + y^* </math>\n::<math> (x y)^* = y^* x^*</math>\n\n* For every complex number \u03bb in '''C''' and every ''x'' in ''A'':\n::<math> (\\lambda x)^* = \\overline{\\lambda} x^* .</math>\n\n* For all ''x'' in ''A'':\n::<math>  \\|x^* x \\| = \\|x\\|\\|x^*\\|.</math>\n\n'''Remark.''' The first three identities say that ''A'' is a [[*-algebra]]. The last identity is called the '''C* identity''' and is equivalent to:\n\n<math>\\|xx^*\\| = \\|x\\|^2,</math>\n\nwhich is sometimes called the B*-identity. For history behind the names C*- and B*-algebras, see the [[#Some_history:_B.2A-algebras_and_C.2A-algebras|history]] section below.\n\nThe C*-identity is a very strong requirement. For instance, together with the [[spectral radius|spectral radius formula]], it implies that the C*-norm is uniquely determined by the algebraic structure:\n\n::<math> \\|x\\|^2 = \\|x^* x\\| = \\sup\\{|\\lambda| : x^* x - \\lambda \\,1 \\text{ is not invertible} \\}.</math>\n\nA [[bounded linear map]], ''\u03c0'' : ''A'' \u2192 ''B'', between C*-algebras ''A'' and ''B'' is called a '''*-homomorphism''' if\n\n* For ''x'' and ''y'' in ''A''\n\n::<math> \\pi(x y) = \\pi(x) \\pi(y) \\,</math>\n\n* For ''x'' in ''A''\n\n::<math> \\pi(x^*) = \\pi(x)^* \\,</math>\n\nIn the case of C*-algebras, any *-homomorphism ''\u03c0'' between C*-algebras is [[Contraction (operator theory)|contractive]], i.e. bounded with norm \u2264 1. Furthermore, an injective *-homomorphism between C*-algebras is [[isometry|isometric]]. These are consequences of the C*-identity.\n\nA bijective *-homomorphism ''\u03c0'' is called a '''C*-isomorphism''', in which case ''A'' and ''B'' are said to be '''isomorphic'''.\n\n== Some history: B*-algebras and C*-algebras ==\nThe term B*-algebra was introduced by C. E. Rickart in 1946 to describe [[Banach *-algebra]]s that satisfy the condition:\n\n* <math>\\lVert x x^* \\rVert = \\lVert x \\rVert ^2</math> for all ''x'' in the given B*-algebra. (B*-condition)\n\nThis condition automatically implies that the *-involution is isometric, that is, <math>\\lVert x \\rVert = \\lVert x^* \\rVert </math>. Hence, <math>\\lVert xx^*\\rVert = \\lVert x \\rVert \\lVert x^*\\rVert</math>, and therefore, a B*-algebra is also a C*-algebra. Conversely, the C*-condition implies the B*-condition. This is nontrivial, and can be proved without using the condition <math>\\lVert x \\rVert = \\lVert x^* \\rVert</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Doran|Belfi|1986|pp=5\u20136}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6jNbsnJVjMoC&pg=PA5 Google Books].</ref> For these reasons, the term B*-algebra is rarely used in current terminology, and has been replaced by the term 'C*-algebra'.\n\nThe term C*-algebra was introduced by [[Irving Segal|I. E. Segal]] in 1947 to describe norm-closed subalgebras of ''B''(''H''), namely, the space of bounded operators on some Hilbert space ''H''. 'C' stood for 'closed'.<ref>{{harvnb|Doran|Belfi|1986|p=6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6jNbsnJVjMoC&pg=PA6 Google Books].</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Segal|1947}}</ref> In his paper Segal defines a C*-algebra as a \"uniformly closed, self-adjoint algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space\".<ref>{{harvnb|Segal|1947|p=75}}</ref>\n\n== Structure of C*-algebras ==\n\nC*-algebras have a large number of properties that are technically convenient. Some of these properties can be established by using the [[continuous functional calculus]] or by reduction to commutative  C*-algebras.  In the latter case, we can use the fact that the structure of these is completely determined by the [[Gelfand isomorphism]].\n\n=== Self-adjoint elements ===\n\nSelf-adjoint elements are those of the form ''x''=''x''*. The set of elements of a C*-algebra ''A'' of the form ''x*x'' forms a closed [[convex cone]].  This cone is identical to the elements of the form ''xx*''. Elements of this cone are called ''non-negative'' (or sometimes ''positive'', even though this terminology conflicts with its use for elements of '''R'''.)\n\nThe set of self-adjoint elements of a C*-algebra ''A'' naturally has the structure of a [[partial order|partially ordered]] [[vector space]]; the ordering is usually denoted \u2265. In this ordering, a self-adjoint element ''x'' of ''A'' satisfies ''x'' \u2265 0 if and only if the [[Spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] of ''x''  is non-negative,{{clarify|Under the Gelfand representation?|date=August 2014}} if and only if ''x'' = ''s*s'' for some ''s''. Two self-adjoint elements ''x'' and ''y'' of ''A'' satisfy ''x'' \u2265 ''y'' if ''x''\u2212''y'' \u2265 0.\n\nThis partially ordered subspace allows the definition of a [[positive linear functional]] on a C*-algebra, which in turn is used to define the [[State (functional analysis)|states]] of a C*-algebra, which in turn can be used to construct the [[spectrum of a C*-algebra]] using the [[GNS construction]].\n\n=== Quotients and approximate identities ===\n\nAny C*-algebra ''A'' has an [[approximate identity]].  In fact, there is a directed family {''e''<sub>\u03bb</sub>}<sub>\u03bb\u2208I</sub> of self-adjoint elements of ''A'' such that\n\n:: <math> x e_\\lambda \\rightarrow x </math>\n:: <math> 0 \\leq e_\\lambda \\leq e_\\mu \\leq 1\\quad \\mbox{ whenever } \\lambda \\leq \\mu. </math>\n\n: In case ''A'' is separable, ''A'' has a sequential approximate identity. More generally, ''A'' will have a sequential approximate identity if and only if ''A'' contains a '''[[Hereditary C*-subalgebra|strictly positive element]]''', i.e. a positive element ''h'' such that ''hAh'' is dense in ''A''.\n\nUsing approximate identities, one can show that the algebraic [[quotient]] of a C*-algebra by a closed proper two-sided [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]], with the natural norm, is a C*-algebra.\n\nSimilarly, a closed two-sided ideal of a C*-algebra is itself a C*-algebra.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Finite-dimensional C*-algebras ===\nThe algebra M(''n'', '''C''') of ''n'' \u00d7 ''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] over '''C''' becomes a C*-algebra if we consider matrices as operators on the Euclidean space, '''C'''<sup>''n''</sup>, and  use the [[operator norm]] ||&middot;|| on matrices. The involution is given by the [[conjugate transpose]].  More generally, one can consider finite [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]]s of matrix algebras. In fact, all C*-algebras that are finite dimensional as vector spaces are of this form, up to isomorphism. The self-adjoint requirement means finite-dimensional C*-algebras are [[Semisimple algebra|semisimple]], from which fact one can deduce the following theorem of [[Artin\u2013Wedderburn theorem|Artin\u2013Wedderburn]] type:\n\n<blockquote>'''Theorem.'''  A finite-dimensional C*-algebra, ''A'', is [[Canonical form|canonically]] isomorphic to a finite direct sum\n:<math> A = \\bigoplus_{e \\in \\min A } A e</math>\nwhere min ''A'' is the set of minimal nonzero self-adjoint central projections of ''A''.</blockquote>\n\nEach C*-algebra, ''Ae'', is isomorphic (in a noncanonical way) to the full matrix algebra M(dim(''e''), '''C'''). The finite family indexed on min ''A'' given by {dim(''e'')}<sub>''e''</sub> is called the ''dimension vector'' of ''A''.  This vector uniquely determines the isomorphism class of a finite-dimensional C*-algebra. In the language of [[operator K-theory|K-theory]], this vector is the [[ordered group|positive cone]] of the ''K''<sub>0</sub> group of ''A''.\n\nA '''\u2020-algebra''' (or, more explicitly, a ''\u2020-closed algebra'') is the name occasionally used in [[physics]]<ref>John A. Holbrook, David W. Kribs, and Raymond Laflamme. \"Noiseless Subsystems and the Structure of the Commutant in Quantum Error Correction.\" ''Quantum Information Processing''. Volume 2, Number 5, pp. 381&ndash;419.  Oct 2003.</ref> for a finite-dimensional C*-algebra.  The [[dagger (typography)|dagger]], \u2020, is used in the name because physicists typically use the symbol to denote a [[Hermitian adjoint]], and are often not worried about the subtleties associated with an infinite number of dimensions.  (Mathematicians usually use the asterisk, *, to denote the Hermitian adjoint.) \u2020-algebras feature prominently in [[quantum mechanics]], and especially [[quantum information science]].\n\nAn immediate generalization of finite dimensional C*-algebras are the [[approximately finite dimensional C*-algebra]]s.\n\n=== C*-algebras of operators ===\nThe prototypical example of a C*-algebra is the algebra ''B(H)'' of bounded (equivalently continuous) [[linear operator]]s defined on a complex [[Hilbert space]] ''H''; here ''x*'' denotes the [[adjoint operator]] of the operator ''x'' : ''H'' \u2192 ''H''. In fact, every C*-algebra, ''A'', is *-isomorphic to a norm-closed adjoint closed subalgebra of ''B''(''H'') for a suitable Hilbert space, ''H''; this is the content of the [[Gelfand\u2013Naimark theorem]].\n\n=== C*-algebras of compact operators ===\nLet ''H'' be a [[separable space|separable]] infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. The algebra ''K''(''H'') of [[Compact operator on Hilbert space|compact operator]]s on ''H'' is a [[norm closed]] subalgebra of ''B''(''H''). It is also closed under involution; hence it is a  C*-algebra.\n\nConcrete C*-algebras of compact operators admit a characterization similar to Wedderburn's theorem for finite dimensional C*-algebras:\n\n<blockquote>'''Theorem.''' If ''A'' is a C*-subalgebra of ''K''(''H''), then there exists Hilbert spaces {''H<sub>i</sub>''}<sub>''i''\u2208''I''</sub> such that\n:<math> A \\cong \\bigoplus_{i \\in I } K(H_i),</math>\nwhere the (C*-)direct sum consists of elements (''T<sub>i</sub>'') of the Cartesian product \u03a0 ''K''(''H<sub>i</sub>'') with ||''T<sub>i</sub>''|| \u2192 0.</blockquote>\n\nThough ''K''(''H'')  does not have an identity element, a sequential [[approximate identity]] for ''K''(''H'') can be developed. To be specific, ''H'' is isomorphic to the space  of square summable sequences ''l''<sup>2</sup>; we may assume that ''H'' = ''l''<sup>2</sup>.  For each natural number ''n'' let ''H<sub>n</sub>'' be the subspace of sequences of ''l''<sup>2</sup> which vanish for indices ''k'' \u2264 ''n'' and let ''e<sub>n</sub>'' be the orthogonal projection onto ''H<sub>n</sub>''. The sequence {''e<sub>n</sub>''}<sub>''n''</sub> is an approximate identity for ''K''(''H'').\n\n''K''(''H'') is a two-sided closed ideal of ''B''(''H''). For separable Hilbert spaces, it is the unique ideal. The [[quotient]] of ''B''(''H'') by ''K''(''H'') is the [[Calkin algebra]].\n\n=== Commutative C*-algebras ===\nLet ''X'' be a [[locally compact]] Hausdorff space.  The space <math>C_0(X)</math> of complex-valued continuous functions on ''X'' that ''vanish at infinity'' (defined in the article on [[locally compact|local compactness]]) form a commutative C*-algebra <math>C_0(X)</math> under pointwise multiplication and addition.

Any such sequence of functions <math>\\{f_K\\}</math> is an approximate identity.\n\nThe [[Gelfand representation]] states that every commutative C*-algebra is *-isomorphic to the algebra <math>C_0(X)</math>, where <math>X</math> is the space of [[Character (mathematics)|characters]] equipped with the [[Weak topology|weak* topology]]. Furthermore, if <math>C_0(X)</math> is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to <math>C_0(Y)</math> as C*-algebras, it follows that <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math> are [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]]. This characterization is one of the motivations for the [[noncommutative topology]] and [[noncommutative geometry]] programs.\n\n=== C*-enveloping algebra ===\nGiven a Banach *-algebra ''A'' with an [[approximate identity]], there is a unique (up to C*-isomorphism) C*-algebra '''E'''(''A'') and *-morphism \u03c0 from ''A'' into '''E'''(''A'') which is [[universal morphism|universal]], that is, every other continuous *-morphism {{nowrap|\u03c0\u2009'\u2009: ''A'' \u2192 ''B''}} factors uniquely through \u03c0.  The algebra '''E'''(''A'') is called the '''C*-enveloping algebra''' of the Banach *-algebra ''A''.\n\nOf particular importance is the C*-algebra of a [[locally compact group]] ''G''.  This is defined as the enveloping C*-algebra of the [[group algebra]] of ''G''.

The team consists mostly of reformed [[supervillain]]s.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe Thunderbolts first appeared in ''[[Hulk|The Incredible Hulk]]'' #449 (January [[1997 in comics|1997]]) and were created by [[Kurt Busiek]] and [[Mark Bagley]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=380}}</ref>\n\nThe Thunderbolts were first presented as a group of superheroes like the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], both to readers and to the [[Marvel Universe]], who became heroes to help protect the world when the Avengers were declared dead after the events of the 1996 \"[[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]\" crossover. However the final page of the first issue of their comic book revealed that the Thunderbolts were the [[Masters of Evil]] in disguise, a surprise twist carefully guarded by Marvel.\n\nThemes of redemption and the nature of heroism are often featured in Thunderbolts comics. In subsequent storylines, the group rejects their leader [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]] and attempts to become heroes in their own right, eventually under the leadership of the Avenger [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]]. The book has also garnered critical praise for its use of secondary characters from other Marvel Comics and its use of continuity-themed storytelling.\n\nThe Thunderbolts was an original concept created for Marvel Comics by [[Kurt Busiek]] and [[Mark Bagley]]. Most of the characters used in the final concept were reimagined versions of existing Marvel characters, with additional original characters for the series developed by Busiek and designed by Bagley. The pair also created the new heroic identities for the Masters of Evil. Busiek recalled:\n\n<blockquote>The actual origin of ''Thunderbolts'' came when I used to live in New Jersey and drive to New England to visit my parents. To keep myself awake, I'd give myself books to write, and work out about two to three years of continuity. One trip, I assigned myself ''Avengers'', and came up with the plan that the Masters of Evil would ultimately conquer them by posing as new heroes and slowly replacing them. At the time, I thought it was a neat idea, and filed it away.<ref>{{cite news | last = Brady | first= Matthew | date = August 1997 | title = Delivery Room | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 72 | pages = 56\u201360}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile Busiek's original reluctance was because he deemed readers would not have liked replacing the established characters and then having the new ones being villains - \"Doing that with one character, like what [[Marv Wolfman]] did with [[Terra (comics)|Terra]], made a great sting, but doing it on a team-wide scale wouldn't work.\" - seeing a world devoid of many heroes following \"Onslaught\" made him revive the concept.<ref>[https://www.newsarama.com/4381-kurt-busiek-creating-characters-for-someone-else-s-sandbox.html Kurt Busiek: Creating Characters for Someone Else's Sandbox]</ref> The Thunderbolts first appeared as a team in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #449 (January [[1997 in comics|1997]]), written by [[Peter David]] and illustrated by [[Mike Deodato]]. Originally intended to be a similar team known as the \"Echelon,\" the synchronization of the plans led to the Thunderbolts being used instead as a \"teaser\" for their own series. No mention was made of the connection between the Thunderbolts and the Masters of Evil in this appearance, save perhaps for the Hulk almost recognizing Meteorite's voice (having fought [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] before). The team also appeared in a one-shot called ''Tales of the Marvel Universe''. The twist would not be revealed until the first issue of their own series.\n\nSoon after the publication of ''The Incredible Hulk'' #449, the team's own series premiered. The first issue, [[cover date]]d April 1997, was played largely as a straight superhero story, until the revelation of the Thunderbolts' true nature on the last page of the comic. This is considered one of the most well-conceived [[plot twist]]s in the history of [[American comic book]]s, with ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine readers voting it \"Comics' Greatest Moment of 1997\" and later, in 1999, placing it at #11 on a list of \"The 25 Greatest Comic Moments Ever\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Marvel managed to keep the secret of the Thunderbolts' true villainous identities tightly under wraps before the book launched. When word got out, the first issue sold out so quickly that Marvel not only offered a second printing, but also did a \"mini-[[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]\" collecting the first two issues.<ref>Thunderbolts: First Strikes (48 pages, softcover, December 1997, 978-0-7851-0577-0)\n</ref> Fabian Nicieza replaced Busiek in issue #34. Patrick Zircher, after a couple of fill-ins, replaced Bagley in issue #51.\n\nDespite critical acclaim, the book was reformatted with ''Thunderbolts'' #76 (March 2003), removing the entire cast and creative team and replacing it with a brand new set of characters, along with a new writer, [[John Arcudi]].<ref name=newsarama1203>{{Cite web | url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=1203 | title=Arcudi and Lis Talk Thunderbolts | work=[[Newsarama]] | date=December 11, 2002 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The move was done in part due to Marvel Editor-in-Chief [[Joe Quesada]]'s desire to emulate the success he had with ''[[X-Force]]'', which was reformatted with a new cast of characters and status quo that was successful in sales and popularity. However, the new direction for the series\u2014an underground fighting circuit that employed predominantly newly created super-villain characters\u2014was a commercial failure{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} and canceled after six issues.\n\nIn [[2004 in comics|2004]], Marvel Comics launched a [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] titled ''Avengers/Thunderbolts'', which continued one year after the events of issue #75.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The limited series ran for the same number of issues as the reformatted Thunderbolts arc.\n\nSoon after the completion of ''Avengers/Thunderbolts'', Marvel Comics launched a second series featuring the characters with ''New Thunderbolts'' #1 (January 2005). The storyline continued the events from ''Avengers/Thunderbolts'' as well as the fall-out of \"[[Avengers Disassembled]]\" and returned to the original series concept, though with a roster that lacked many fan favorites (such as Baron Zemo, Moonstone, and [[Fixer (comics)|Techno]]). With the combination of the eighty-one issues of the first series and the first eighteen issues of ''New Thunderbolts'', the series reverted to its original numbering with ''Thunderbolts'' #100.\n\n''Thunderbolts'' #110 saw another change to the direction of the series, with writer [[Warren Ellis]] introducing a new team of Thunderbolts,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=86724 | title=Updated - Confirmed: Ellis & Deodata On Thunderbolts | work=Newsarama | date=June 10, 2006 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061030154603/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=86724 | archivedate=October 30, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=8264 | title=Ellis Gets Thunderstruck: Brevoort Talks \"Thunderbolts\" | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=October 6, 2006}}</ref> villains working for the government, tasked with capturing unregistered superheroes.

Art by Mark Bagley.|thumb]]\n\n===Baron Helmut Zemo's Thunderbolts===\n[[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]] summoned several of his former allies from the prior incarnations of the [[Masters of Evil]] during a rescue attempt of [[Erik Josten|Goliath]] (the former bodyguard to Baron Heinrich Zemo). The summoned members included [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]], [[Fixer (comics)#Paul Norbert Ebersol|Fixer]], [[Karla Sofen|Moonstone]] and [[Songbird (comics)|Screaming Mimi]]. Zemo took the accidental gathering as an omen, and decided to reform the Masters of Evil and attack the Avengers.<ref name=\"Tbolts97\">''Thunderbolts '97 Annual''</ref> Before they could strike, the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], the [[X-Men]], and the [[Fantastic Four]] were apparently killed by the villain [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]].<ref>Onslaught: Marvel Universe</ref>\n\nThe death of the Avengers, X-Men, and Fantastic Four created an opportunity for Zemo and the Masters of Evil. Zemo realized that the world needed superpowered champions, and that his team could fill that need. By posing as superheroes, the Masters of Evil could gain the public trust and build a position of power that rivaled the status of the Avengers. Once they had gained the public's faith, Zemo believed they could gain access to all the secrets of the Avengers and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] once they were in ultimate power. Zemo then planned to sell the secrets they found to the criminal underworld.<ref name=\"Tbolts97\"/>\n\nThe villains adopted new heroic costumes and codenames. Baron Zemo became the patriotic American [[Citizen V#Baron Helmut Zemo|Citizen V]], patterned after a [[World War II|WWII]] hero his father killed. Former [[Human Torch (Johnny Storm)|Human Torch]] and [[Spider-Man]] foe Beetle became MACH-1, using a new high-tech suit designed by Fixer. Fixer became the gadget-wielding Techno. Long time Avengers enemy Goliath became the powerhouse Atlas. Screaming Mimi became Songbird, her damaged abilities aided by technology Zemo had adapted from ex-Master Klaw. Moonstone was secretly freed from the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]] and added to the team by Zemo, who extracted a promise of loyalty from her. She was to be Zemo's personal enforcer against any betrayal committed by the others. She took the alias Meteorite. Calling themselves the Thunderbolts, the six new 'heroes' were ready for action.<ref>''Thunderbolts Annual 1997 (vol.1)</ref>\n\nThe team found tremendous success as superheroic champions. The public began to think of the Thunderbolts as heroes. After several adventures, some of the villains began to think of themselves the same way. [[Dallas Riordan]], an aide to the Mayor of New York, befriended the new heroes.<ref>''Thunderbolts #6 (vol.1)</ref>\n\n[[Jolt (comics)|Jolt]], an [[Asian American]] teenage girl whose entire family was killed by Onslaught and was experimented on by [[Arnim Zola]], soon joined the team after she came to the Baxter Building seeking the help of the FF. Jolt, however, was not a supervillain, with the young girl honestly believing that her new friends were heroes (Zemo used the opportunity to create the team's new history). Soon after the addition of Jolt, Techno's neck was broken in battle with the Elements of Doom. Techno then seemingly transferred his mind into an [[android (robot)|android]] body built from his tech-pack.<ref>''Thunderbolts #8 (vol.1)</ref>\n\nJust as Zemo's plans were about to come to fruition, everything unravelled. To the astonishment of the entire world, the [[Fantastic Four]] and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] returned. Faced with the return of the lost heroes, Zemo revealed the true nature of the Thunderbolts to the world. Ostensibly, he did this to ensure the loyalty of the team by ruining their chances of becoming heroes.<ref>''Thunderbolts #10 (vol.1)</ref>\n\nThe Thunderbolts (minus the android Techno) turned on Zemo for his betrayal. In the ensuing battle, Zemo and Techno used a [[mind control]] device to turn the Avengers and Fantastic Four against the remaining Thunderbolts, who, with the help of the size-changing Atlas- as well as [[Iron Man]], who had designed his armour to make himself more resistant to mind control- ultimately rallied and freed the other heroes. Together, they defeated Zemo and Techno. Unbeknownst to his teammates, Atlas helped the wounded Zemo escape, while Techno fled under his own power.<ref>Thunderbolts #12</ref>\n\nAmidst this chaos, Meteorite decided to return to her old identity. She altered her costume and changed her codename back to Moonstone. After a brief stop-over in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]], the team learned that Moonstone had no intention of reforming and becoming a superhero. She told them she only turned against Zemo out of self-preservation.<ref>''Thunderbolts #13 (vol.1)</ref>\n\nUpon their return to Earth, the team set up shop in Colorado and pondered their next move.<ref>''Thunderbolts #15 (vol.1)</ref>\n\n====Marvel's Most Wanted====\nNow fugitives, new members soon joined the Thunderbolts. These members included the former Avenger [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]], and later a young [[African American]] hero named [[Charcoal (comics)|Charcoal]] who had previously fought the team, having been created by a \"Create a character\" contest in ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] Magazine''. Hawkeye convinced his new teammates they would be pardoned if MACH-1, who had murdered someone as the Beetle (as the only member of the team who had ever actually ''killed'' anyone), turned himself in to authorities. The team considered joining the mysterious [[Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)|Crimson Cowl]]'s new Masters of Evil instead. Ultimately, the Thunderbolts followed Hawkeye's advice. MACH-1 turned himself in and pleaded guilty to murder. Even with MACH-1's surrender, the U.S. Government refused to pardon the group.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nThe Thunderbolts then defeated the Crimson Cowl's Masters of Evil and took over their headquarters. After unmasking the Crimson Cowl, the team discovered that she was their old friend Dallas Riordan. In truth, Riordan was not the Crimson Cowl. The real Crimson Cowl was Justine Hammer. Riordan had been framed by Hammer to take the fall for the Cowl's crimes. While Riordan was not the Crimson Cowl, she did have her own secret identity. Riordan was actually the new Citizen V, leader of the secret [[V-Battalion]]. Riordan decided to keep her secret to avoid exposure of the group. She was sent to jail for the Crimson Cowl's crimes, but was later rescued by the V-Battalion.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\n====Changes====\nWhile exploring their new headquarters, the Thunderbolts discovered [[Ogre (Marvel Comics)|Ogre]]. Ogre was a former member of the villainous Factor Three, the original owners of the base. Factor Three made Ogre the new base caretaker after they disbanded. This also left him with custody of [[Humus Sapien]], a dangerous mutant teenager that Factor Three had kidnapped and placed in suspended animation.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nOgre was accepted as a member of the Thunderbolts. Soon after, Techno attacked him, placed him in stasis, and assumed his identity. At the same time, MACH-1 was freed from prison in exchange for stealing some top secret weapons technology from evil industrialist [[Justin Hammer]]. MACH-1 returned to the Thunderbolts after gaining his freedom thanks to Hawkeye making a deal with the Commission that had released him that he would continue officially serving his sentence while returning to the team. Upon his return, Techno upgraded MACH-1's armor, and used another device to change his features so that others wouldn't realize he was the same person as the original identity. MACH-1 was now MACH-2.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nDuring this time, the Thunderbolts joined forces with the Avengers against the latest plan of [[Count Nefaria]], as he intended to detonate an ionic bomb, which will transform millions of people into an ionic state which he can then control, perceiving it as the best way to guarantee that he receives the respect that he feels he deserves. The two teams are drawn into this plan when Nefaria uses his new control of ionic energy to take control of the heroes [[Wonder Man]] and [[Erik Josten|Atlas]], intending to use them to kill the Avengers. Despite his power, he is stopped by the combined efforts of the Avengers, the Thunderbolts, and [[Madame Masque]], Masque using a weapon she had developed to disrupt Nefaria's own ionic energy so that the heroes can defeat him.<ref>''Avengers'' #32 - 34 (vol. 2, Sept. - Nov. 2000) and ''Thunderbolts'' #42 - 43 (Sept. - Oct 2000)</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Moonstone found herself going through changes. She fell in love with Hawkeye. Soon after, she learned that the spirit of the Kree Moonstone that powered her tried to make her a more honest person. This conflicted with her naturally amoral personality, and slowly made her insane.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nThe Thunderbolts faced many more challenges. [[Henry Peter Gyrich|Henry Gyrich]] sought to destroy the team and Hawkeye. Gyrich changed a brainwashed [[Jack Monroe (comics)|Jack Monroe]] into the new [[Scourge of the Underworld|Scourge]]. The Scourge then attempted to assassinate the Thunderbolts one by one. First he killed Jolt. He then traveled to [[South America]] and apparently killed Baron Zemo. After this, Scourge broke into the Thunderbolts headquarters and destroyed the robotic Techno. He then killed Atlas by allowing the giant to implode into a storm of ionic energy.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\n====The Redeemers====\nAll four characters apparently killed by Scourge had survived in some form: the robotic Techno had recovered Jolt's body and used her electrical powers to resurrect her from the dead, even while he \"died\", imbuing her with the knowledge that Hawkeye had failed to get the team pardoned in the process. The Thunderbolts were upset with Hawkeye, but, on unmasking Monroe, decided that confronting Gyrich was more important.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #49 (April 2001)</ref>\n\nWhile all this happened, [[Valerie Cooper|Val Cooper]] had gathered her own army of heroes she named the [[Redeemers (comics)|Redeemers]]. This team included a new Citizen V, Atlas' brother [[Smuggler (comics)|Smuggler]], and Fixer, who had only copied his mind into his tech-pack as a contingency. The original Norbert P. Ebersol survived his injuries and recovered in secret while the robotic Techno continued on as a Thunderbolt in his place.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} [[Leila Davis]], the wife of the Ringer, used an updated version of the Beetle armour.\n\nThe Redeemers helped the Thunderbolts battle Gyrich, who had acquired experimental nanite technology. Gyrich wanted to use the nanites to kill off all heroes and villains on Earth. Gyrich's scheme was foiled. It was soon revealed that he had been infected with nanites, and had been secretly manipulated by [[Baron Strucker]] of the terrorist group [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]]. Hawkeye tried to use this information as blackmail to get the Thunderbolts pardoned. Gyrich countered that he would tell the public himself about HYDRA's scheme. Ultimately, Gyrich agreed to stay quiet and give the Thunderbolts their pardon. In return, Hawkeye turned himself in for aiding the fugitive heroes. Hawkeye went to prison and the team disbanded.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #50 (May 2001)</ref>\n\nEventually, all the others murdered by Jack Monroe returned from the dead. Baron Zemo's mind had been transferred into the comatose body of the man whose role as Citizen V he had usurped in the first place.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nLater, after a teleportation accident, Zemo's mind was transferred into Techno's mechanical \"Tech-Pack\", which had also cybernetically replaced the broken segment of Techno's real body's spine. Atlas was later raised from the dead after a merger with Riordan, who had been crippled in battle with the Crimson Cowl.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nJolt and Charcoal, the only Thunderbolts without criminal records, were assimilated into the Redeemers under the leadership of Captain America and the Zemo-possessed Citizen V. The Redeemers were promptly slaughtered by the Thunderbolts' deadliest foe, the powerful supervillain [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]] with Citizen V, Fixer (who ran away), and Jolt (who re-formed her electric form) as the only survivors of the massacre, although Smuggler and Screamer have since resurfaced.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\n====Rebirth and endings====\nThe Thunderbolts reformed to defeat Graviton. During the fight, several of the team members present (Fixer, Jolt, Moonstone, Jenkins as MACH-3 and the merged Atlas/Dallas Riordan, along with Zemo's mind \u2014 accidentally transferred into Fixer's tech-pack by the teleportation) were transported to [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]], the same parallel Earth the Avengers and Fantastic Four were sent to after their final battle with Onslaught.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} The Thunderbolts met Counter-Earth versions of Heinrich Zemo, Helmut Zemo and [[Nefarius|the first Moonstone]], the last of which was known as [[Phantom Eagle]].{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nUnder duress \u2014 Zemo being able to disable his ability to walk at will \u2014 Fixer transferred Zemo's mind from \"Tech-Pack\" into the body of Zemo's counterpart. Zemo then killed the Counter-Earth version of his father.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} Soon after, the Thunderbolts stopped the Nazi Germany of Counter-Earth from taking control of all of Counter-Earth's computers.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} Zemo convinced the team to remain and help rebuild Counter-Earth. The team reluctantly agreed and based themselves in the mobile Counter-Earth [[Attilan]]. Then, Moonstone stole the mentally unstable Phantom Eagle's moonstone for herself, boosting her powers to godlike levels.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nBack on [[Earth-616]], many things happened. Hawkeye escaped from prison alongside several supervillains just as S.H.I.E.L.D. contacted him with an offer to be freed from prison. Industrialist Justin Hammer died. His daughter Justine (the Crimson Cowl) discovered her father had exposed every supervillain he ever employed to a poison that enslaved their minds. This included members of the Crimson Cowl's Masters of Evil. However, the villain [[Plantman]] had helped create the poison and was the only one who could activate it.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nWith the telepathic terrorist [[Mentallo]] serving as a middleman, Hawkeye tried to help Plantman in order to give him to Crimson Cowl. During the escape, Hawkeye watched helplessly as Plantman murdered a prison guard. Before Crimson Cowl could kill Hawkeye or take Plantman, they were rescued by Songbird.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nHawkeye and Songbird then formed a second group of Thunderbolts. He explained to the Crimson Cowl's Masters of Evil that if the Crimson Cowl was not stopped, they would all become her slaves. Plantman, using the codename Blackheath, was their first new member. Most of the members of Crimson Cowl's Masters of Evil also joined, including: [[Cardinal (comics)|Cardinal]] (now Harrier); [[Skein (comics)|Gypsy Moth]] (now Skein); [[Man-Killer]] (now Amazon); and [[Cyclone (Marvel Comics)|Cyclone]], who did not change his codename.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nThese new Thunderbolts were eventually captured by the Crimson Cowl (who was helped by Cyclone). Crimson Cowl vivisected Plantman. Soon after, Plantman mutated into a plant creature that neutralized the mind-control poison. The group was then sent to the V-Battalion's base. The Counter-Earth group returned to Earth at the V-Battalion base through a rift in space. The new and old teammates were reunited. Jolt stayed on Counter-Earth and joined the [[Young Allies (Marvel Comics)#Heroes Reborn|Young Allies]]. Closing the rift between Earth and Counter-Earth destroyed the V-Battalion's base.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nIn the aftermath, Atlas and Dallas were split into separate bodies, with Dallas retaining the remainder of Atlas' ionic power, allowing her to walk again with enhanced agility and strength. Zemo convinced Hawkeye that he wanted to reform and help the world instead of ruling it. Hawkeye, Amazon and Skein left the team. MACH-3 and Harrier returned to prison. Zemo then revealed to the team that he had lied to Hawkeye and that he still wanted to conquer the world, only to save it from itself. The ''Thunderbolts'' comic then shifted focus for six issues.\n\n====Avengers/Thunderbolts: The Best Intentions====\nIn 2004, the six issue ''Avengers/Thunderbolts'' limited series was launched, picking up a year after the events of ''Thunderbolts'' #75. Zemo led the Thunderbolts (now including Dallas Riordan, under the codename Vantage) in an attempt to drain the powers of all superhumans on Earth, using Moonstone. They fought the Avengers, including former Thunderbolt Hawkeye. The Avenger [[Iron Man]] infiltrated the Thunderbolts disguised as [[Cobalt Man]]. Eventually, all the power absorbed by Moonstone caused her to snap. Jolt returned from Counter-Earth to help stop Moonstone. Finally, Iron Man convinced Hawkeye to lobotomize Moonstone to save the planet.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nZemo vowed revenge against the Thunderbolts and the Avengers for putting Moonstone into a coma. Jolt returned to Counter-Earth. A depowered Blackheath returned to prison. The Fixer fled. Vantage retired to a government job. Songbird was offered reserve membership in the Avengers but turned it down. MACH-3 was paroled from prison and decided to form a new team of Thunderbolts.<ref>''Avengers/Thunderbolts'' #6 (2004)</ref>\n\n===The New Thunderbolts===\nMarvel subsequently launched ''New Thunderbolts'' #1. MACH-3 (now called MACH-IV), Atlas and Songbird were now a part of the new Thunderbolts. The team's new recruits included [[Genis-Vell|Photon]], [[Speed Demon (Marvel Comics)|Speed Demon]], [[Joystick (comics)|Joystick]], [[Blizzard (comics)|Blizzard]] II and the [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]]. The new team has battled [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantean]] superhuman terrorist group the Fathom Five and Baron Strucker's HYDRA organization, which funded the team's return.<ref>{{Cite comic|title=New Thunderbolts|issue=#1-6|date=2005}}</ref>\n\nIn \"Purple Reign\", [[Andreas von Strucker|Swordsman]], along with his master, the [[Purple Man]], plotted to enslave New York City by drugging the water supply with the Purple Man's pheromones, which allowed him to control his victims.<ref>{{Cite comic|title=New Thunderbolts|issue=#10|date=September 2005}}</ref> While the Thunderbolts eventually defeated the Purple Man, before they could interrogate him he was teleported away by his boss, Baron Zemo, who tortured him by inducing [[rigor mortis]] in his body and sent him back to prison where his powers would be nullified.<ref>{{Cite comic|title=New Thunderbolts|issue=#12|date=November 2005}}</ref>\n\nLater, [[Hank Pym]] and [[Carol Danvers|Warbird]] offered to pardon the members of the Thunderbolts (who still had outstanding legal problems), if the Thunderbolts would attack and humiliate the New Avengers in public. However, it was later revealed that Pym and Warbird had been blackmailed into doing so.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nOnly [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] survived unscathed from the Thunderbolts' sneak attack, beating Joystick senseless. The rest of the team was beaten back before the Thunderbolts left. Songbird told Captain America that the Thunderbolts could beat the New Avengers senseless anytime they wished. In the end, it was revealed that Baron Zemo spearheaded the attack. He did this to humiliate Captain America but also to see how far the Thunderbolts would go for the chance at being pardoned.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nMeanwhile, new threats were rising as Fixer resurfaced and recruited both MACH-IV and Blizzard to work with him on a top secret project, which was also run by Zemo. Meanwhile, Speed Demon was confronted by the new female [[Doctor Spectrum#Alice Nugent|Doctor Spectrum]], who was out to reform the [[Squadron Sinister]] and take over the world. In the end, Speed Demon quit the Thunderbolts to join Dr. Spectrum while [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)#Nighthawk|Nighthawk]], the former [[Defenders (comics)|Defender]] and member of the original Squadron Sinister, was offered membership on the Thunderbolts by Songbird.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\n====Right of Power====\nSoon after Nighthawk joined the team, the Thunderbolts discovered that Photon's awareness of all space and time brought with it a vision of the destruction of the universe at his hands. As they tried to come to terms with this, they were attacked a Moonstone puppeteered by Zemo to kill Genis-Vell. When the initial strike failed, the remainder of Zemo's team revealed themselves to the Thunderbolts. Zemo explained that he had used the Moonstones to accelerate Genis' return from death, and in the process made the mistake of siphoning energy from the beginning and end of time itself, caused by inexperience with his Moonstones, creating a link between Genis and the universe that threatened to end existence. Unable to find a way to save both Genis and the universe, he concluded that the only solution was Genis's death.\n\nUnwilling to accept this Songbird led the team in combat against Zemo's group. To prevent the other Thunderbolts from intervening, Zemo revealed that Atlas' brother Smuggler had survived Graviton's massacre of the Redeemers, trapped in the [[Darkforce]] dimension. Using the prospect of his release to make Atlas stop the other Thunderbolts interfering, Zemo bested Genis in battle and, apologizing for both his mistake and the necessary solution, sliced Genis' body into pieces and scattered them through both time and the Darkforce dimension to prevent Genis returning from the dead a third time. He then fully released Smuggler. In the aftermath, Zemo&mdash;his face apparently fully healed from Moonstone's attack&mdash;and Songbird became allies and lovers.<ref>{{Cite comic|title= Thunderbolts|issue=#100|date=May 2006}}</ref>\n\n====Civil War: Hero Hunters====\n{{Main|Civil War (comics)}}\nThe new Thunderbolts engaged and defeated [[Quicksand (comics)|Quicksand]] in a battle in Denver during the early days of the superhero [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]. After this, they were summoned to Washington where they met with Iron Man, [[Mister Fantastic]], and [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]]. The three heroes, all supporting the [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]], informed Zemo that they wanted the Thunderbolts to hunt down supervillains and recruit them to the Pro-Registration cause, which would be their chance at redemption. Unknown to Iron Man, the Thunderbolts had been doing this in secret for three weeks.<ref>{{Cite comic|title=Thunderbolts|issue=#103|date=August 2006}}</ref>\n\nZemo's \"Thunderbolt Army\" grew rapidly, the team vastly expanding. It now included dozens of other supervillains, including most notably [[Doctor Octopus]], the [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]], and [[Ox (comics)|Ox]]. The new team dispersed to battle super-villains, capture them and offer them a choice: join the Thunderbolts or go to prison. Of course, they all chose to join the Thunderbolts. Baron Zemo convinced Captain America not to stop him from battling the Grandmaster, while Nighthawk was revealed as being a spy for the Squadron Sinister inside Captain America's Secret Avengers. Zemo then informed Songbird that in the coming battle, he knew that she would betray him, which she had been planning to do all along, in revenge for his killing of Photon, and he would sacrifice himself to save the world.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nZemo then saved the Wellspring of Power from the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]], who planned to use it for his own ends. Believing that all of his visions were subject to the flow of time, and that nothing was set in stone, Zemo defeated the Grandmaster, and boasted to his teammates that the power was now all his and theirs. He insisted that he would use it to help the world, despite the consequences for doing so. Songbird, who had temporarily lost her powers during the final battle, was told by Zemo, \"now is when your betrayal would have come.\" The vision of her betrayal turned out to be somewhat correct after all, though. Although she could not use her super-sound, Songbird used a simple opera note to crack the moonstones, sending Zemo into a whirlwind of cosmic time/space. In his final words before he was completely sucked into the vacuum, he screamed out that he would never have hurt a world he worked so hard to save.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nSome of the Army of Thunderbolts, consisting of [[Mac Gargan|Venom]], [[Lady Deathstrike]], [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]], [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], [[Jester (Marvel Comics)|Jester]], [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)#Steven Levins|Jack O'Lantern]] join Songbird assembled as the Pro-Registration side's task force to hunt down Anti-Registration heroes at the end of ''Civil War'' #4, but never officially saw any real combat. The Jester and Jack O'Lantern were later killed by the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Civil War'' #5 (November 2006)</ref> The two were sent to hunt down and capture Spider-Man when he attempted to leave Iron Man's Pro-Registration army.{{Issue|date=July 2010}}\n\nBullseye, Taskmaster, and Lady Deathstrike were part of the final battle of Civil War fighting alongside the Pro-Registration side, with Taskmaster wounding Mr. Fantastic when he sought to kill [[Invisible Woman]] (a member of the Anti-Registration forces). At the end of the fight, Taskmaster, Bullseye, and Deathstrike were sent to the [[Negative Zone]] prison; but Bullseye escaped{{Issue|date=April 2009}} before he could be sent, and Taskmaster was freed by [[Deadpool]] en route to the portal. Deathstrike was either released or somehow escaped on her own. She would go on to battle the [[X-Men]] during the events of \"[[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah CompleX]]\", a story arc in the X-Men related books.{{Issue|date=July 2010}}\n\nAfter the events surrounding the Wellspring, the current team disbanded. MACH-IV and the Fixer were offered jobs from the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]]. Blizzard was released from jail and left the team. Atlas was de-ionized after his encounter with the Wellspring but left catatonic and trapped in his enlarged state while Smuggler, his suit destroyed, took care of him. Joystick was imprisoned for her traitorous actions during the Wellspring debacle and Speed Demon ran away to avoid arrest. Only Songbird, Moonstone, Swordsman and the Radioactive Man, remained on the team.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #109 (February 2007)</ref>\n\n====Zemo: Born Better====\nIn the events of ''Thunderbolts: Zemo - Born Better'' mini-series, Baron Zemo found himself lost in time and in Europe, forced to witness the lives and deaths of the previous generations of \"Baron Zemos\", while being violently thrust forward in time at random points of his adventures. The journey forward in time was a prolonged \"moment of clarity\" experience for Zemo, who saw his family's true history and not the rose-colored version his father and grandfather had taught him. When he ultimately returned to the present day, Zemo discovered that a distant cousin had been responsible for his return to the present, though at a horrific cost of causing Zemo to jump forward from era to era every time his cousin murdered a family member who shared the same blood as Helmut. When Helmut discovered that his cousin rescued Zemo just so he could kill his infamous relative, Helmut refused to resist, a move that caused his cousin to attempt to take his own life before Zemo convinced him to put down his gun and stop the cycle of violence.\n\n===Norman Osborn's Thunderbolts===\n''Thunderbolts'' #110 featured a new creative team (writer [[Warren Ellis]] and artist [[Mike Deodato]]) and a new roster and direction for the team. The team was formed under the control of Norman Osborn, and the majority of the roster was made up of villains wishing to redeem themselves.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=95109 | title=Better Know a Thunderbolt: Green Goblin | work=Newsarama | date=December 21, 2006 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206203540/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=95109 | archivedate=February 6, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=95756 | title=Better Know a Thunderbolt: Moonstone | work=Newsarama | date=December 29, 2006 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127132239/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=95756 | archivedate=January 27, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=92433 | title=Better Know a Thunderbolt: Bullseye | work=Newsarama | date=November 28, 2006 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070126163051/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=92433 | archivedate=January 26, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=96554 | title=Better Know a Thunderbolt: Penance | work=Newsarama | date=January 6, 2007 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211055537/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=96554 | archivedate=February 11, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=93344 | title=Better Know a Thunderbolt: Songbird | work=Newsarama | date=December 6, 2006 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208235836/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=93344 | archivedate=December 8, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=92839 | title=Better Know a Thunderbolt: Venom | work=Newsarama | date=December 1, 2006 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128134053/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=92839 | archivedate=January 28, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe new Thunderbolts roster was as follows:\n* [[Norman Osborn]] (Leader)\n* [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] (Field leader)\n* [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]]\n* [[Robbie Baldwin|Penance]]\n* [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]]\n* [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]]\n* [[Fenris (comics)|Swordsman]]\n* [[Mac Gargan|Venom]]\n\nAfter the Marvel Comics ''Civil War'' event, the new Thunderbolts were tasked with tracking down and arresting individuals avoiding the Superhuman Registration Act. Despite the new line-up, many of the themes of the original series continued; in particular, Songbird's decision to cripple Bullseye in retaliation for the villain crippling the super-hero [[Jack Flag]], Norman Osborn's own struggle for redemption as he claimed, and the growing friendship between Songbird and Radioactive Man. Moonstone was made team leader, a move that proved to be disastrous and ultimately led to Songbird resuming control over the team and expanding the group's missions to involve regular super-hero missions besides hunting down unregistered super-heroes.\n\nDue to lengthy delays towards the end of Ellis's run, several one-shot specials<ref name=newsarama145526 /> and a ''Penance'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]]<ref name=cbr11376>{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=11376 | title=Reflections #221: Paul Jenkins, Part 2 | work=Comic Book Resources | date=September 9, 2007}}</ref> were launched to fill in the gap. The ''Penance'' limited series saw the hero formerly known as Speedball carrying out a complex scheme hatched to gain revenge against Nitro, the man who murdered his teammates the New Warriors, which put him at odds with his new teammates on the Thunderbolts. Several specials advanced other plotlines, such as the mysterious death of Songbird's mother<ref>''Thunderbolts: Breaking Point'' (January 2008)</ref> and Swordsman betraying the Thunderbolts by allying himself with [[Arnim Zola]] to resurrect his sister, after realizing that Osborn would not use his cloning technology to resurrect Andrea.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nFollowing the events of \"Caged Angels\", the various Thunderbolt specials (written by [[Christos Gage]]), and the Penance limited series, and guest appearances in ''[[Moon Knight]]''{{Issue|date=April 2010}} and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'',{{Issue|date=April 2010}} the group is thrust into the events of \"[[Secret Invasion]]\", when Thunderbolt Mountain is attacked by the [[Skrull]] [[Khn'nr]], also known as Skrull sleeper agent [[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]], just as Arnim Zola drops off the newly resurrected (via cloning technology) Andrea Strucker.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nBarely surviving the fight due to Khn'ner's inability to deal with the implanted memories inside of him belonging to Mar-Vell, the group went onto the offensive against the Skrull armada as they invaded Washington DC.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} During the fight, Andrea is teamed with her brother Swordsman, Moonstone and Bullseye under the fear that she is a Skrull spy sent to infiltrate the group. However, when Moonstone betrays Swordsman in order to join forces with the Skrulls in order to bait Andrea into revealing herself to be a Skrull, she is shocked to realize that she is a clone, culminating in Bullseye murdering her in order to save Moonstone.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} With Norman's help, Moonstone blames the Skrulls for Andrea's murder. After the Thunderbolts defeat the Skrull armada attacking Washington, D.C., as well as two Super-Skrulls, Norman begins to play up his and his team's role to the media, making them appear to be the force that is saving the Earth from Tony Stark's bungling. The Thunderbolts then journey to New York where they reluctantly aid Earth's heroes in their battle against the Skrulls.<ref name=tb122125>''Thunderbolts'' #122-125 (September \u2013 December 2008)</ref>\n\n===H.A.M.M.E.R.'s Thunderbolts===\nAfter Songbird gets mad at Osborn for leaving her to deal with a dangerous Skrull who nearly killed her, Norman Osborn and Moonstone come to the agreement to get rid of Songbird and the other Thunderbolts whose morals do not match their own.<ref name=tb125>''Thunderbolts'' #125 (December 2008)</ref> Their plan comes into effect while Norman is in Washington during the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, preparing to assume control over S.H.I.E.L.D.

No longer wearing a costume and now stuck in a wheelchair, [[U.S. Agent (comics)|U.S. Agent]] is appointed the new warden of the Raft.\n\nDuring their first training session, Luke Cage is attacked by Baron Helmut Zemo, who declares that he will take leadership of the Thunderbolts.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #144 (July 2010)</ref> He tells the Thunderbolts that they can serve him if they can escape from the Raft. Though Crossbones is more than willing to oblige, the rest are suspicious. As it turns out, it was a setup to test the team and the Raft's security measures. They are then deployed to deal with a group of [[Trolls (Marvel Comics)|Asgardian trolls]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #145 (August 2010)</ref>\n\nAfter killing two of the trolls and capturing the third (who turned out to be a girl named [[Troll (Marvel Comics)|Gunna]] who was raised by trolls), the group is reprimanded by Cage for the death of the two trolls. The Thunderbolts are sent out to search for a group of missing S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, who turn out to be mutated by the [[Terrigen Mist]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #146 (September 2010)</ref>\n\nAfter slaying the mutated S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and sealing off the cave, the Thunderbolts return to the Raft for a check-up. The check-up reveals that Crossbones has not been mutated by the Terrigen Mist and that MACH-V will be out for weeks. The facility is soon visited by the staff and students of [[Avengers Academy]]. After getting Thunderbolts introduced to the students, the prison's power grid suddenly shut down due to an [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]], allowing the Raft's inmates to escape. Together with Warden Walker (U.S. Agent) and the staff of Avengers Academy, the Thunderbolts manage to detain all escaped prisoners. Some of Hank Pym's students attempted to get to Norman Osborn, so Luke Cage reprimands them.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #147 (October 2010)</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]'' storyline, the Thunderbolts are assigned with rescuing a young boy who is held prisoner by the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]], and bringing down their stronghold.

Juggernaut is left at the Raft while the alpha and beta team went on to a mission in Iraq, as zombies emerge from the area. In that moment, a Worthy hammer falls inside the prison and is taken immediately by Juggernaut (who feels also the calling of Cytorak). The hammer ends up transforming Kuurth: Breaker of Stone who ends up destroying the Raft, which led to most of its inmates escaping.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #158</ref> The alpha and beta teams are called back to the raft to capture and control inmates, and work to clear the rubble. During the process, Centurius manages to find the controls for the beta team's nanites and disable them. The beta team decides to wait for a better time to escape, as they reason that more heroes may be on the way to help the raft. Meanwhile, Moonstone restores order to the partially collapsed women's' wing of the prison, as Ghost helps the warden avert a crisis in a section of the prison where a malfunctioning failsafe is suffocating inmates. Crossbones, an ex-member of the Thunderbolts, with the help of another inmate, escapes the raft in the chaos.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #159</ref> After order is restored, the alpha team, including Songbird and Mach V, is sent to subdue Juggernaut/Kuurth, with the beta team and Fixer held in reserve. To the team's surprise, Man-Thing becomes uncontrollable, and teleports away before they fight Juggernaut. Satana explains that he has reached the \"next stage\" of his evolution, but before she can finish explaining, Juggernaut arrives. The team tries to free Juggernaut from the hammer's influence, but fail and he escapes.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #160</ref>\n\n====Thunderbolts Throughout Time====\nUpon being sent back in time to the World War II era, the Thunderbolts members end up passing themselves off as the American Thunderbolts when they end up helping the World War II era's versions of Captain America and Namor.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #163</ref> As Centurius adapts the name of Doc Century for this time period, the American Thunderbolts continue their fight with the Nazis and the [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]] androids that were created by Baron Heinrich Zemo.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #164</ref>\n\nFrom then on the book focuses on the team in the present (Luke Cage, MACH-V, Songbird, Ghost) versus the Underbolts team in the past (Centurius, Satana, Troll, Boomerang, Moonstone, Fixer). Eventually, jumping around in time, the team encounter themselves as the original Thunderbolts (1997) and ends with the renaming of the title into ''Dark Avengers''<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #175</ref> although the storyline carries through.\n\n===Red Hulk's Thunderbolts===\nA new team composed of [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]], [[Deadpool]], [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]], and [[Punisher]] debuted as a part of [[Marvel NOW!]] major relaunch.

Madman confronts them and Leader promises to unlock his intellect to his brother, but after whispering one secret word his brother drops dead\u2014his brain not being able to handle all of the information.\n\nThe team then follows leads for the supplies of the gamma radiation technology to Kabul to discover Elektra's brother [[Elektra (comics)#Family and early life|Orestez Natchios]] is creating an army of [[Crimson Dynamo]]s powered by gamma radiation.<ref>Thunderbolts Volume 2 issue 7</ref> Elektra runs off with her brother and claims to have killed him, but Punisher realizes she was lying and kills him himself. During this fiasco, the Red Leader secretly gains access to the internet and downloads his intellect off the internet despite his body not being able to physically contain it (he suffers from profuse nose bleeds).<ref>Thunderbolts Volume 2 issue 12</ref>\n\nThe Team decides that they can't do only missions for Red Hulk, as none truly trust him, so a system of give and take missions is developed, in which the team does a mission for General Ross, then a mission for a random member. The first random name pulled for a member is Punisher, who chooses a mission to take out a crime family in New York.<ref>Thunderbolts Volume 2 issue 13</ref> The story arc takes place during the crossover event [[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]. It turns out the Leader purposefully tricked the team into letting him pick the next mission, since he had no skin in the game, so he can escape. He wasn't expecting an alien invasion. While trying to escape the team's submarine, Red Leader begins to get his brain siphoned by [[Black Order (comics)|Supergiant of Thanos' Black Order]], but is saved by Red Hulk. He reluctantly releases Mercy and is forced by Red Hulk to trick her into destroying the Black Order's flag ship. Afterwards, Red Leader starts having visions of how to kill every member of the Team, but determines that something is wrong with his plan, there was an unseen variable that stopped him from succeeding. That variable presents itself mainly in the form of Abigail Mercy, who joined Ross's Thunderbolts team as a condition for her release.<ref>Thunderbolts Volume 2 issue 19</ref>\n\n[[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]] joins the team in order to stop Mercy, who is getting too powerful to control, but inadvertently drags the team to hell. Leader negotiates a contract with [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] to put him back in power of the Underworld by overthrowing the current leader of hell, [[Strong Guy]], who gave up his soul to save his love. Strong Guy throws the fight, so the Thunderbolts escape and Mercy is dragged to hell.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 2 #20</ref>\n\nDeadpool's name gets pulled next for a mission and he wants to kidnap actor [[Ryan Reynolds]], but Venom asks to be given the mission, as he is leaving the team. He wants to let the symbiote take over and have the team fight it, which they do, to reassure him that if he would lose control of the symbiote, there would be someone that could stop him.<ref>Thunderbolts Volume 2 issue 23</ref>\n\nThe team then travels to a haunted swamp in [[Honduras]] to find an ancient artifact. Leader is the only one who can translate the ancient language. During the boat ride, Leader whispers something cryptic from an ancient language and Johnny Blaze loses his powers and is killed by a tentacled monster. Leader then betrays the team by promising their river guide to help ambush the team, but then doubles crosses him and alerts the team, who them quickly dispose of the ambushers. Leader then tricks the team into entering the secret temple via bobby trapped entrance. Ross survives and finds the power of the temple, an infant [[Celestial (comics)|celestial head]]. Leader attempts to drink the Celestial's blood, but this causes his brain to explode. One of Ross' former squadmates, Mancuso, is waiting for him and powered by the Celestial. Mancuso warns him that if Ross continues his selfish ways he will be forced to use his cosmic powers to kill him. Ross realizes that he pushes his team too hard and constantly endangers them, so Mansuco teleports them back to before the briefing. Ross decides not to travel to Honduras.<ref>Thunderbolts Volume 2 issue 26</ref>\n\nMuch later, the team tracked down [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Doctor Faustus]]. The [[Punisher]] wanted to kill him for murdering all the children in a high school. Red Hulk stopped him and wanted to recruit Faustus, but the Punisher does not like the idea and quits the team. While going to the refrigerator at his safe house, the Punisher found a bomb with a note saying, \"You don't quit on us. You're fired.\"<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 2 #27</ref> Angered, the Punisher believes Red Hulk set the bomb and began hunting down his former teammates. He snipers Leader and Faustus. He decapitates Deadpool, who is not angry and actually flattered that Frank found him a threat. He steals magic regalia from [[Elsa Bloodstone|Bloodstone]] and depowers Ghost Rider, but Johnny Blaze is actually glad to be freed of the demon.<ref>''Thunderbolts Vol. 2 #28</ref> Punisher can't bring himself to kill Elektra, but does confess that he killed her brother. She then admits she knew he would kill her brother. Punisher then uses a customized [[Hulkbusters|Hulkbuster armor]] with a special gun that depowers Red Hulk temporarily. During a gruesome hand-to-hand combat between Ross and Castle, Hawkeye and his new team of Avengers arrest both of them. It is later revealed that Red Leader was alive and set the bomb knowing the Punisher will come after each member of the Thunderbolts and set a Life Model Decoy to fool the other Thunderbolts.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 2 #31</ref> The Avengers and Thunderbolts return to Kata Jaya and arrest Leader who is their new dictator. Ross then decides to disband the team.\n\nThe annual takes place before the team disbands and follow the team as they work up with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.#W.A.N.D.|W.A.N.D.]], S.H.I.E.L.D.'s paranormal research department, in order to take down an out of control Doctor Strange.<ref>Thunderbolts Annual Vol 2 #1</ref>\n\n===Winter Soldier's Thunderbolts===\nIt has been announced that a new team led by the Winter Soldier will form following the events of the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline. Besides [[Bucky Barnes|Winter Soldier]], the membership consists of [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]], [[Erik Josten|Atlas]], [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]], [[Abner Jenkins|MACH-X]], and [[Cosmic Cube|Kobik]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-announces-winter-soldier-led-thunderbolts-from-zub-malin/|title=Marvel Announces Winter Soldier-led \"Thunderbolts\" From Zub &amp; Malin|date=22 January 2016|website=CBR}}</ref> Winter Soldier, Kobik, and MACH-X helped Fixer, Atlas, and Moonstone evade S.H.I.E.L.D. In exchange, they agree to form the Thunderbolts with the mission to make sure that S.H.I.E.L.D. never uses the Kobik Project again.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 3 #1</ref>\n\nOver the course of this 12-issue run, Bucky's Thunderbolts team clashes with the All-New Inhumans, Squadron Supreme, mysterious alien invaders and others. They also frequently test the limits of Kobik's terrifying, reality-bending cosmic powers. The girl is the one who magically manifests the team's arctic headquarters and even resolves Fixer's time travel-loop conundrum that has lingered since the \"Thunderbolts Throughout Time\" storyline.\n\nFollowing the '''Civil War II''' event, the team reunites with Songbird as they rescue Bucky from an altered, secretly fascist Captain America. She remains with the team, briefly reuniting her romance with Abe Jenkins (MACH-X). In the lead up to the '''Secret Empire''' event, Zemo attacks the Thunderbolts' base with the latest incarnation of the Masters of Evil. As that confrontation begins to unfold, Jolt is transported back from Counter Earth just in time to save Atlas from arctic exposure. \n\nLater, Zemo makes a nefarious offer the original Thunderbolts members: give in to their darker natures and join the new rise of Hydra... or die. Abe and Melissa reject the offer, but Fixer, Moonstone, and Atlas ultimately leave the ruins of the HQ with Zemo's Masters of Evil. In the aftermath of the destruction, Songbird scours the snowy horizon for Abe, who is presumed dead, while Ghost\u2014who has been spying on the Thunderbolts for some time\u2014rescues a pocket-sized Jolt, who has shrunk due to her power exertion during the battle with the Masters of Evil.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 3 #10</ref>\n\n===Punisher: War on the Streets===\nAfter losing custody of Frank Castle in his fledgling country of Bagalia, Baron Zemo flees to New York City. There, he approaches the current mayor, Kingpin, in hopes of joining forces and finally taking on revenge on the Punisher. Fearing a public relations disaster, Kingpin reluctantly agrees\u2014and is promptly dismayed when Zemo reveals a new team of Thunderbolts at a mayoral press conference.\n\nLed by Zemo\u2014once again disguised as Citizen V\u2014this Thunderbolts team includes Fixer, Ghost, Moonstone, Radioactive Man, and an armored/disguised Jigsaw, who had just previously helped Zemo battle Punisher back in Bagalia. Kingpin and Citizen V announce to a cheering crowd that the Thunderbolts will work with newly-arrived U.N. forces (who are, in fact, Zemo's disguised Hydra soldiers) and a covert team of NYPD officers to rid the city of Punisher.<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 12 #13</ref>\n\nZemo and his team are able to surprise Frank Castle once, but are thwarted by Black Widow.<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 12 #14</ref> Moonstone and Kingpin ultimately goad an over-confident Zemo into confronting Punisher again and \"Citizen V\" musters a rousing speech to rally spooked Hydra agents. The Thunderbolts then clash with Castle again\u2014but discover that the vigilante has reluctantly partnered with a team of other street-level operatives, including Black Widow, Moon Knight, [[Rachel Cole-Alves]], and even Frank's old Thunderbolts teammate, Ghost Rider. The battle is fierce and even though Frank shoots down Fixer (or possibly a robotic copy) and corners \"Citizen V,\" Jigsaw intervenes... and the Thunderbolts escape with Rachel as a hostage. As they flee, Zemo challenges Frank to come retrieve her... alone.<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 12 #15</ref>\n\n==Members==\n{{Main|List of Thunderbolts members}}\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===''Contest of Champions''===\nThe 2015 ''[[Marvel: Contest of Champions#Contest of Champions (2015)|Contest of Champions]]'' comic series features a universe where Iron Man and the Pro-Registration won Civil War with everything going in Tony's favor for five years. The Thunderbolts in this universe are members of Captain America's Anti-Registration team who buy time off their sentence with suicide missions from the government, similar to DC's [[Suicide Squad]]. This version of the team is led by [[Steve Rogers (comics)|Steve Rogers]] and is composed of [[Spider-Man]], [[Invisible Woman]], [[Goliath (Bill Foster)|Goliath]], and [[the Punisher]]. When President Stark and his Mighty Avengers are kidnapped by Maestro and sent to Battleworld, the government sends the Thunderbolts to retrieve them. After a fight breaks out between them, the Mighty Avengers, and the Renegade Champions, Tony kills Steve and reveals that he used the Reality Gem to rig the war in his favor. Tony and the Punisher are killed by Maestro shortly afterward. The surviving Mighty Avengers and Thunderbolts stay behind on Battleworld after the fight and dub themselves the Civil Warriors.\n\n===\"Fightbolts\"===\nFrom ''Thunderbolts'' #76-81, the Thunderbolts were no longer featured. The focus of the comic shifted to Daniel Axum, a former supervillain known as the Battler. Axum joined an underground fighting circuit that employed other supervillains, including the [[Armadillo (comics)|Armadillo]]. Axum, along with fellow combatant Man-Killer, turned on his criminal manager Rey Trueno, and refused to return to the supervillain lifestyle. Despite continuing the title and numbering, this incarnation had no connection to the better-known team listed above, and the title was cancelled six issues into this direction.\n\n===Marvel Zombies===\nIn ''[[Marvel Zombies|Marvel Zombies: Dead Days]]'', zombified Thunderbolts appear, rampaging across New York. The undead Thunderbolts are killed by the combined forces of Nova, Thor, and the Fantastic Four.\n\n===MC2===\nWhile the majority of the Thunderbolts have yet to appear in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] Universe, Jolt appeared as an Avenger before the current team assembled in ''[[A-Next]]'' #1.\n\n''[[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]]''<!--issue needed--> introduces a government team for reformed villains, similar to the Thunderbolts, consisting of:\n* '''[[Big Man (Marvel Comics characters)|Big Man]]''' (son of [[Hank Pym]] and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]).

The plot of the prequel comic revolves around an older Hawkeye hunting down the former Thunderbolts to avenge his fallen comrades.\n\n===''Marvel Rising''===\nIn ''[[Marvel Rising]]'', the Thunderbolts are a rock band featuring versions of [[Songbird (comics)|Screaming Mimi]], [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]], [[Jolt (comics)|Jolt]] and [[Atlas]]\n\n==Slogan==\n:''Justice, like lightning, ever should appear to few men's ruin, but to all men's fear.''\n\nThe series' slogan, \"Justice, Like Lightning...\" was attributed to a poem by [[Thomas Randolph (poet)|Thomas Randolph]] in ''Thunderbolts'' #1. However, upon further investigation, Kurt Busiek could not find any evidence that this phrase had actually appeared in Thomas Randolph's writings. Busiek himself had originally taken the slogan from the [[Roy Thomas]]-penned issues of ''[[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]]'', where the quote was similarly attributed to Randolph.<ref name=\"Poem\">{{Cite web | url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showpost.php?p=3951495&postcount=313 | title=Kurt Busiek's summary of the poem's history | work=Newsarama | date=June 28, 2007 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref>\n\nThe quote is frequently attributed to [[Joseph Swetnam]], but this was not Swetnam himself, but rather a character based on him in the 1620 play ''[[Swetnam the Woman-Hater|Swetnam the Woman-Hater Arraigned by Women]]'', which was written by an unknown author.

The group is a young hero team established by [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]], and consists of [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak & Dagger]] and [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] with the Green Goblin as a silent benefactor. Seen in the episode \"New Warriors\", the group's mission was to raid the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Helicarrier|Tri-Carrier]] to spring the Goblin out of S.H.I.E.L.D. custody where they and [[Sinister Six|some supervillains]] end up fighting [[Spider-Man]]'s [[New Warriors]]. Following the resulting battles, Cloak & Dagger defected to Spider-Man's side and Taskmaster is apprehended while Vulture and the Goblin escape.\n* The original version of Thunderbolts appear in ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers: Ultron Revolution]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvlistings.zap2it.com/|title=TV Listings- Find Local TV Listings and Watch Full Episodes - Zap2it.com|date=1 September 2017|website=Zap2It}}</ref> The team consists of the group's original lineup from the comics; [[Helmut Zemo]] (Citizen V), [[Abner Jenkins|MACH-IV]], [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]], [[Erik Josten|Atlas]], [[Karla Sofen|Meteorite]] and [[Fixer (comics)#Paul Norbert Ebersol|Techno]]. Introduced in \"The Thunderbolts\", this superhero team has been doing some heroics with Gabby Talbott (voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]) as their publicist. The Thunderbolts are first seen when they help the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] take down [[Growing Man]]. The press ends up giving the Thunderbolts the credit. [[Iron Man]] and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] later tracked them to their headquarters and had a brief altercation until [[Justin Hammer]]'s bomb nearly wiped them out. When it came to Hammer's three possible bunkers, each member of both teams went to a location and fought the [[Mandroid]]s. It was through one location that Iron Man and Citizen V found Gabby's connections with Hammer. At the latest bunker, the Avengers and the Thunderbolts fought the Mega-Mandroid equipped with forcefield abilities. Thanks to Meteorite phasing through, the Mega-Mandroid was defeated and Hammer is handed over to authorities. Citizen V took the opportunity to fire Gabby as Iron Man is believed to think that the Thunderbolts are good guys after all. In the episode \"Thunderbolts Revealed\", the Thunderbolts help the Avengers defeat [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Ulysses Klaue]] even when a device secretly planted on Klaue and the Vibranium contains merged them together. Suspicious of the Thunderbolts, [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] finds out that the group were the [[Masters of Evil]] disguised thanks to an Inversion Stabilizer. Luckily, the Avengers show up, resulting a fight between the two groups. After being saved from death by [[Captain America]] during the fight and seeing what it's like be a hero, Songbird convinces the rest of the team to turn on Zemo. The Avengers and Thunderbolts together expose Zemo as Citizen V, leading to Zemo fighting both groups. While they might not have seen the last of Zemo, Hawkeye advises to the other members that they should turn themselves in and that they will be official heroes when they get out.\n*It was announced that a Thunderbolts TV series or movie is in early development by Marvel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mcucosmic.com/2019/11/07/early-development-on-thunderbolts-has-begun/|title=Early Development on \u2018Thunderbolts\u2019 Has Begun|date=November 7, 2019|website=MCU Cosmic|author=Jeremy Conrad|accessdate=November 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Video games===\n* Most of the post-Civil War Thunderbolts appear in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]''.

The team consists mostly of reformed [[supervillain]]s.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe Thunderbolts first appeared in ''[[Hulk|The Incredible Hulk]]'' #449 (January [[1997 in comics|1997]]) and were created by [[Kurt Busiek]] and [[Mark Bagley]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=380}}</ref>\n\nThe Thunderbolts were first presented as a group of superheroes like the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], both to readers and to the [[Marvel Universe]], who became heroes to help protect the world when the Avengers were declared dead after the events of the 1996 \"[[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]\" crossover. However the final page of the first issue of their comic book revealed that the Thunderbolts were the [[Masters of Evil]] in disguise, a surprise twist carefully guarded by Marvel.\n\nThemes of redemption and the nature of heroism are often featured in Thunderbolts comics. In subsequent storylines, the group rejects their leader [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]] and attempts to become heroes in their own right, eventually under the leadership of the Avenger [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]]. The book has also garnered critical praise for its use of secondary characters from other Marvel Comics and its use of continuity-themed storytelling.\n\nThe Thunderbolts was an original concept created for Marvel Comics by [[Kurt Busiek]] and [[Mark Bagley]]. Most of the characters used in the final concept were reimagined versions of existing Marvel characters, with additional original characters for the series developed by Busiek and designed by Bagley. The pair also created the new heroic identities for the Masters of Evil. Busiek recalled:\n\n<blockquote>The actual origin of ''Thunderbolts'' came when I used to live in New Jersey and drive to New England to visit my parents. To keep myself awake, I'd give myself books to write, and work out about two to three years of continuity. One trip, I assigned myself ''Avengers'', and came up with the plan that the Masters of Evil would ultimately conquer them by posing as new heroes and slowly replacing them. At the time, I thought it was a neat idea, and filed it away.<ref>{{cite news | last = Brady | first= Matthew | date = August 1997 | title = Delivery Room | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 72 | pages = 56\u201360}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile Busiek's original reluctance was because he deemed readers would not have liked replacing the established characters and then having the new ones being villains - \"Doing that with one character, like what [[Marv Wolfman]] did with [[Terra (comics)|Terra]], made a great sting, but doing it on a team-wide scale wouldn't work.\" - seeing a world devoid of many heroes following \"Onslaught\" made him revive the concept.<ref>[https://www.newsarama.com/4381-kurt-busiek-creating-characters-for-someone-else-s-sandbox.html Kurt Busiek: Creating Characters for Someone Else's Sandbox]</ref> The Thunderbolts first appeared as a team in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #449 (January [[1997 in comics|1997]]), written by [[Peter David]] and illustrated by [[Mike Deodato]]. Originally intended to be a similar team known as the \"Echelon,\" the synchronization of the plans led to the Thunderbolts being used instead as a \"teaser\" for their own series. No mention was made of the connection between the Thunderbolts and the Masters of Evil in this appearance, save perhaps for the Hulk almost recognizing Meteorite's voice (having fought [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] before). The team also appeared in a one-shot called ''Tales of the Marvel Universe''. The twist would not be revealed until the first issue of their own series.\n\nSoon after the publication of ''The Incredible Hulk'' #449, the team's own series premiered. The first issue, [[cover date]]d April 1997, was played largely as a straight superhero story, until the revelation of the Thunderbolts' true nature on the last page of the comic. This is considered one of the most well-conceived [[plot twist]]s in the history of [[American comic book]]s, with ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine readers voting it \"Comics' Greatest Moment of 1997\" and later, in 1999, placing it at #11 on a list of \"The 25 Greatest Comic Moments Ever\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Marvel managed to keep the secret of the Thunderbolts' true villainous identities tightly under wraps before the book launched. When word got out, the first issue sold out so quickly that Marvel not only offered a second printing, but also did a \"mini-[[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]\" collecting the first two issues.<ref>Thunderbolts: First Strikes (48 pages, softcover, December 1997, 978-0-7851-0577-0)\n</ref> Fabian Nicieza replaced Busiek in issue #34. Patrick Zircher, after a couple of fill-ins, replaced Bagley in issue #51.\n\nDespite critical acclaim, the book was reformatted with ''Thunderbolts'' #76 (March 2003), removing the entire cast and creative team and replacing it with a brand new set of characters, along with a new writer, [[John Arcudi]].<ref name=newsarama1203>{{Cite web | url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=1203 | title=Arcudi and Lis Talk Thunderbolts | work=[[Newsarama]] | date=December 11, 2002 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The move was done in part due to Marvel Editor-in-Chief [[Joe Quesada]]'s desire to emulate the success he had with ''[[X-Force]]'', which was reformatted with a new cast of characters and status quo that was successful in sales and popularity. However, the new direction for the series\u2014an underground fighting circuit that employed predominantly newly created super-villain characters\u2014was a commercial failure{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} and canceled after six issues.\n\nIn [[2004 in comics|2004]], Marvel Comics launched a [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] titled ''Avengers/Thunderbolts'', which continued one year after the events of issue #75.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The limited series ran for the same number of issues as the reformatted Thunderbolts arc.\n\nSoon after the completion of ''Avengers/Thunderbolts'', Marvel Comics launched a second series featuring the characters with ''New Thunderbolts'' #1 (January 2005). The storyline continued the events from ''Avengers/Thunderbolts'' as well as the fall-out of \"[[Avengers Disassembled]]\" and returned to the original series concept, though with a roster that lacked many fan favorites (such as Baron Zemo, Moonstone, and [[Fixer (comics)|Techno]]). With the combination of the eighty-one issues of the first series and the first eighteen issues of ''New Thunderbolts'', the series reverted to its original numbering with ''Thunderbolts'' #100.\n\n''Thunderbolts'' #110 saw another change to the direction of the series, with writer [[Warren Ellis]] introducing a new team of Thunderbolts,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=86724 | title=Updated - Confirmed: Ellis & Deodata On Thunderbolts | work=Newsarama | date=June 10, 2006 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061030154603/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=86724 | archivedate=October 30, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=8264 | title=Ellis Gets Thunderstruck: Brevoort Talks \"Thunderbolts\" | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=October 6, 2006}}</ref> villains working for the government, tasked with capturing unregistered superheroes.

The summoned members included [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]], [[Fixer (comics)#Paul Norbert Ebersol|Fixer]], [[Karla Sofen|Moonstone]] and [[Songbird (comics)|Screaming Mimi]]. Zemo took the accidental gathering as an omen, and decided to reform the Masters of Evil and attack the Avengers.<ref name=\"Tbolts97\">''Thunderbolts '97 Annual''</ref> Before they could strike, the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], the [[X-Men]], and the [[Fantastic Four]] were apparently killed by the villain [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]].<ref>Onslaught: Marvel Universe</ref>\n\nThe death of the Avengers, X-Men, and Fantastic Four created an opportunity for Zemo and the Masters of Evil. Zemo realized that the world needed superpowered champions, and that his team could fill that need. By posing as superheroes, the Masters of Evil could gain the public trust and build a position of power that rivaled the status of the Avengers. Once they had gained the public's faith, Zemo believed they could gain access to all the secrets of the Avengers and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] once they were in ultimate power. Zemo then planned to sell the secrets they found to the criminal underworld.<ref name=\"Tbolts97\"/>\n\nThe villains adopted new heroic costumes and codenames. Baron Zemo became the patriotic American [[Citizen V#Baron Helmut Zemo|Citizen V]], patterned after a [[World War II|WWII]] hero his father killed. Former [[Human Torch (Johnny Storm)|Human Torch]] and [[Spider-Man]] foe Beetle became MACH-1, using a new high-tech suit designed by Fixer. Fixer became the gadget-wielding Techno. Long time Avengers enemy Goliath became the powerhouse Atlas. Screaming Mimi became Songbird, her damaged abilities aided by technology Zemo had adapted from ex-Master Klaw. Moonstone was secretly freed from the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]] and added to the team by Zemo, who extracted a promise of loyalty from her. She was to be Zemo's personal enforcer against any betrayal committed by the others. She took the alias Meteorite. Calling themselves the Thunderbolts, the six new 'heroes' were ready for action.<ref>''Thunderbolts Annual 1997 (vol.1)</ref>\n\nThe team found tremendous success as superheroic champions. The public began to think of the Thunderbolts as heroes. After several adventures, some of the villains began to think of themselves the same way. [[Dallas Riordan]], an aide to the Mayor of New York, befriended the new heroes.<ref>''Thunderbolts #6 (vol.1)</ref>\n\n[[Jolt (comics)|Jolt]], an [[Asian American]] teenage girl whose entire family was killed by Onslaught and was experimented on by [[Arnim Zola]], soon joined the team after she came to the Baxter Building seeking the help of the FF. Jolt, however, was not a supervillain, with the young girl honestly believing that her new friends were heroes (Zemo used the opportunity to create the team's new history). Soon after the addition of Jolt, Techno's neck was broken in battle with the Elements of Doom. Techno then seemingly transferred his mind into an [[android (robot)|android]] body built from his tech-pack.<ref>''Thunderbolts #8 (vol.1)</ref>\n\nJust as Zemo's plans were about to come to fruition, everything unravelled. To the astonishment of the entire world, the [[Fantastic Four]] and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] returned. Faced with the return of the lost heroes, Zemo revealed the true nature of the Thunderbolts to the world. Ostensibly, he did this to ensure the loyalty of the team by ruining their chances of becoming heroes.<ref>''Thunderbolts #10 (vol.1)</ref>\n\nThe Thunderbolts (minus the android Techno) turned on Zemo for his betrayal. In the ensuing battle, Zemo and Techno used a [[mind control]] device to turn the Avengers and Fantastic Four against the remaining Thunderbolts, who, with the help of the size-changing Atlas- as well as [[Iron Man]], who had designed his armour to make himself more resistant to mind control- ultimately rallied and freed the other heroes. Together, they defeated Zemo and Techno. Unbeknownst to his teammates, Atlas helped the wounded Zemo escape, while Techno fled under his own power.<ref>Thunderbolts #12</ref>\n\nAmidst this chaos, Meteorite decided to return to her old identity. She altered her costume and changed her codename back to Moonstone. After a brief stop-over in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]], the team learned that Moonstone had no intention of reforming and becoming a superhero. She told them she only turned against Zemo out of self-preservation.<ref>''Thunderbolts #13 (vol.1)</ref>\n\nUpon their return to Earth, the team set up shop in Colorado and pondered their next move.<ref>''Thunderbolts #15 (vol.1)</ref>\n\n====Marvel's Most Wanted====\nNow fugitives, new members soon joined the Thunderbolts. These members included the former Avenger [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]], and later a young [[African American]] hero named [[Charcoal (comics)|Charcoal]] who had previously fought the team, having been created by a \"Create a character\" contest in ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] Magazine''. Hawkeye convinced his new teammates they would be pardoned if MACH-1, who had murdered someone as the Beetle (as the only member of the team who had ever actually ''killed'' anyone), turned himself in to authorities. The team considered joining the mysterious [[Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)|Crimson Cowl]]'s new Masters of Evil instead. Ultimately, the Thunderbolts followed Hawkeye's advice. MACH-1 turned himself in and pleaded guilty to murder. Even with MACH-1's surrender, the U.S. Government refused to pardon the group.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nThe Thunderbolts then defeated the Crimson Cowl's Masters of Evil and took over their headquarters. After unmasking the Crimson Cowl, the team discovered that she was their old friend Dallas Riordan. In truth, Riordan was not the Crimson Cowl. The real Crimson Cowl was Justine Hammer. Riordan had been framed by Hammer to take the fall for the Cowl's crimes. While Riordan was not the Crimson Cowl, she did have her own secret identity. Riordan was actually the new Citizen V, leader of the secret [[V-Battalion]]. Riordan decided to keep her secret to avoid exposure of the group. She was sent to jail for the Crimson Cowl's crimes, but was later rescued by the V-Battalion.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\n====Changes====\nWhile exploring their new headquarters, the Thunderbolts discovered [[Ogre (Marvel Comics)|Ogre]]. Ogre was a former member of the villainous Factor Three, the original owners of the base. Factor Three made Ogre the new base caretaker after they disbanded. This also left him with custody of [[Humus Sapien]], a dangerous mutant teenager that Factor Three had kidnapped and placed in suspended animation.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nOgre was accepted as a member of the Thunderbolts. Soon after, Techno attacked him, placed him in stasis, and assumed his identity. At the same time, MACH-1 was freed from prison in exchange for stealing some top secret weapons technology from evil industrialist [[Justin Hammer]]. MACH-1 returned to the Thunderbolts after gaining his freedom thanks to Hawkeye making a deal with the Commission that had released him that he would continue officially serving his sentence while returning to the team. Upon his return, Techno upgraded MACH-1's armor, and used another device to change his features so that others wouldn't realize he was the same person as the original identity. MACH-1 was now MACH-2.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nDuring this time, the Thunderbolts joined forces with the Avengers against the latest plan of [[Count Nefaria]], as he intended to detonate an ionic bomb, which will transform millions of people into an ionic state which he can then control, perceiving it as the best way to guarantee that he receives the respect that he feels he deserves. The two teams are drawn into this plan when Nefaria uses his new control of ionic energy to take control of the heroes [[Wonder Man]] and [[Erik Josten|Atlas]], intending to use them to kill the Avengers. Despite his power, he is stopped by the combined efforts of the Avengers, the Thunderbolts, and [[Madame Masque]], Masque using a weapon she had developed to disrupt Nefaria's own ionic energy so that the heroes can defeat him.<ref>''Avengers'' #32 - 34 (vol. 2, Sept. - Nov. 2000) and ''Thunderbolts'' #42 - 43 (Sept. - Oct 2000)</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Moonstone found herself going through changes. She fell in love with Hawkeye. Soon after, she learned that the spirit of the Kree Moonstone that powered her tried to make her a more honest person. This conflicted with her naturally amoral personality, and slowly made her insane.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nThe Thunderbolts faced many more challenges. [[Henry Peter Gyrich|Henry Gyrich]] sought to destroy the team and Hawkeye. Gyrich changed a brainwashed [[Jack Monroe (comics)|Jack Monroe]] into the new [[Scourge of the Underworld|Scourge]]. The Scourge then attempted to assassinate the Thunderbolts one by one. First he killed Jolt. He then traveled to [[South America]] and apparently killed Baron Zemo. After this, Scourge broke into the Thunderbolts headquarters and destroyed the robotic Techno. He then killed Atlas by allowing the giant to implode into a storm of ionic energy.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\n====The Redeemers====\nAll four characters apparently killed by Scourge had survived in some form: the robotic Techno had recovered Jolt's body and used her electrical powers to resurrect her from the dead, even while he \"died\", imbuing her with the knowledge that Hawkeye had failed to get the team pardoned in the process. The Thunderbolts were upset with Hawkeye, but, on unmasking Monroe, decided that confronting Gyrich was more important.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #49 (April 2001)</ref>\n\nWhile all this happened, [[Valerie Cooper|Val Cooper]] had gathered her own army of heroes she named the [[Redeemers (comics)|Redeemers]]. This team included a new Citizen V, Atlas' brother [[Smuggler (comics)|Smuggler]], and Fixer, who had only copied his mind into his tech-pack as a contingency. The original Norbert P. Ebersol survived his injuries and recovered in secret while the robotic Techno continued on as a Thunderbolt in his place.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} [[Leila Davis]], the wife of the Ringer, used an updated version of the Beetle armour.\n\nThe Redeemers helped the Thunderbolts battle Gyrich, who had acquired experimental nanite technology. Gyrich wanted to use the nanites to kill off all heroes and villains on Earth. Gyrich's scheme was foiled. It was soon revealed that he had been infected with nanites, and had been secretly manipulated by [[Baron Strucker]] of the terrorist group [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]]. Hawkeye tried to use this information as blackmail to get the Thunderbolts pardoned. Gyrich countered that he would tell the public himself about HYDRA's scheme. Ultimately, Gyrich agreed to stay quiet and give the Thunderbolts their pardon. In return, Hawkeye turned himself in for aiding the fugitive heroes. Hawkeye went to prison and the team disbanded.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #50 (May 2001)</ref>\n\nEventually, all the others murdered by Jack Monroe returned from the dead. Baron Zemo's mind had been transferred into the comatose body of the man whose role as Citizen V he had usurped in the first place.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nLater, after a teleportation accident, Zemo's mind was transferred into Techno's mechanical \"Tech-Pack\", which had also cybernetically replaced the broken segment of Techno's real body's spine. Atlas was later raised from the dead after a merger with Riordan, who had been crippled in battle with the Crimson Cowl.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nJolt and Charcoal, the only Thunderbolts without criminal records, were assimilated into the Redeemers under the leadership of Captain America and the Zemo-possessed Citizen V. The Redeemers were promptly slaughtered by the Thunderbolts' deadliest foe, the powerful supervillain [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]] with Citizen V, Fixer (who ran away), and Jolt (who re-formed her electric form) as the only survivors of the massacre, although Smuggler and Screamer have since resurfaced.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\n====Rebirth and endings====\nThe Thunderbolts reformed to defeat Graviton. During the fight, several of the team members present (Fixer, Jolt, Moonstone, Jenkins as MACH-3 and the merged Atlas/Dallas Riordan, along with Zemo's mind \u2014 accidentally transferred into Fixer's tech-pack by the teleportation) were transported to [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]], the same parallel Earth the Avengers and Fantastic Four were sent to after their final battle with Onslaught.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} The Thunderbolts met Counter-Earth versions of Heinrich Zemo, Helmut Zemo and [[Nefarius|the first Moonstone]], the last of which was known as [[Phantom Eagle]].{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nUnder duress \u2014 Zemo being able to disable his ability to walk at will \u2014 Fixer transferred Zemo's mind from \"Tech-Pack\" into the body of Zemo's counterpart. Zemo then killed the Counter-Earth version of his father.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} Soon after, the Thunderbolts stopped the Nazi Germany of Counter-Earth from taking control of all of Counter-Earth's computers.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} Zemo convinced the team to remain and help rebuild Counter-Earth. The team reluctantly agreed and based themselves in the mobile Counter-Earth [[Attilan]]. Then, Moonstone stole the mentally unstable Phantom Eagle's moonstone for herself, boosting her powers to godlike levels.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nBack on [[Earth-616]], many things happened. Hawkeye escaped from prison alongside several supervillains just as S.H.I.E.L.D. contacted him with an offer to be freed from prison. Industrialist Justin Hammer died. His daughter Justine (the Crimson Cowl) discovered her father had exposed every supervillain he ever employed to a poison that enslaved their minds. This included members of the Crimson Cowl's Masters of Evil. However, the villain [[Plantman]] had helped create the poison and was the only one who could activate it.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nWith the telepathic terrorist [[Mentallo]] serving as a middleman, Hawkeye tried to help Plantman in order to give him to Crimson Cowl. During the escape, Hawkeye watched helplessly as Plantman murdered a prison guard. Before Crimson Cowl could kill Hawkeye or take Plantman, they were rescued by Songbird.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nHawkeye and Songbird then formed a second group of Thunderbolts. He explained to the Crimson Cowl's Masters of Evil that if the Crimson Cowl was not stopped, they would all become her slaves. Plantman, using the codename Blackheath, was their first new member. Most of the members of Crimson Cowl's Masters of Evil also joined, including: [[Cardinal (comics)|Cardinal]] (now Harrier); [[Skein (comics)|Gypsy Moth]] (now Skein); [[Man-Killer]] (now Amazon); and [[Cyclone (Marvel Comics)|Cyclone]], who did not change his codename.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nThese new Thunderbolts were eventually captured by the Crimson Cowl (who was helped by Cyclone). Crimson Cowl vivisected Plantman. Soon after, Plantman mutated into a plant creature that neutralized the mind-control poison. The group was then sent to the V-Battalion's base. The Counter-Earth group returned to Earth at the V-Battalion base through a rift in space. The new and old teammates were reunited. Jolt stayed on Counter-Earth and joined the [[Young Allies (Marvel Comics)#Heroes Reborn|Young Allies]]. Closing the rift between Earth and Counter-Earth destroyed the V-Battalion's base.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nIn the aftermath, Atlas and Dallas were split into separate bodies, with Dallas retaining the remainder of Atlas' ionic power, allowing her to walk again with enhanced agility and strength. Zemo convinced Hawkeye that he wanted to reform and help the world instead of ruling it. Hawkeye, Amazon and Skein left the team. MACH-3 and Harrier returned to prison. Zemo then revealed to the team that he had lied to Hawkeye and that he still wanted to conquer the world, only to save it from itself. The ''Thunderbolts'' comic then shifted focus for six issues.\n\n====Avengers/Thunderbolts: The Best Intentions====\nIn 2004, the six issue ''Avengers/Thunderbolts'' limited series was launched, picking up a year after the events of ''Thunderbolts'' #75. Zemo led the Thunderbolts (now including Dallas Riordan, under the codename Vantage) in an attempt to drain the powers of all superhumans on Earth, using Moonstone. They fought the Avengers, including former Thunderbolt Hawkeye. The Avenger [[Iron Man]] infiltrated the Thunderbolts disguised as [[Cobalt Man]]. Eventually, all the power absorbed by Moonstone caused her to snap. Jolt returned from Counter-Earth to help stop Moonstone. Finally, Iron Man convinced Hawkeye to lobotomize Moonstone to save the planet.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nZemo vowed revenge against the Thunderbolts and the Avengers for putting Moonstone into a coma. Jolt returned to Counter-Earth. A depowered Blackheath returned to prison. The Fixer fled. Vantage retired to a government job. Songbird was offered reserve membership in the Avengers but turned it down. MACH-3 was paroled from prison and decided to form a new team of Thunderbolts.<ref>''Avengers/Thunderbolts'' #6 (2004)</ref>\n\n===The New Thunderbolts===\nMarvel subsequently launched ''New Thunderbolts'' #1. MACH-3 (now called MACH-IV), Atlas and Songbird were now a part of the new Thunderbolts. The team's new recruits included [[Genis-Vell|Photon]], [[Speed Demon (Marvel Comics)|Speed Demon]], [[Joystick (comics)|Joystick]], [[Blizzard (comics)|Blizzard]] II and the [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]]. The new team has battled [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantean]] superhuman terrorist group the Fathom Five and Baron Strucker's HYDRA organization, which funded the team's return.<ref>{{Cite comic|title=New Thunderbolts|issue=#1-6|date=2005}}</ref>\n\nIn \"Purple Reign\", [[Andreas von Strucker|Swordsman]], along with his master, the [[Purple Man]], plotted to enslave New York City by drugging the water supply with the Purple Man's pheromones, which allowed him to control his victims.<ref>{{Cite comic|title=New Thunderbolts|issue=#10|date=September 2005}}</ref> While the Thunderbolts eventually defeated the Purple Man, before they could interrogate him he was teleported away by his boss, Baron Zemo, who tortured him by inducing [[rigor mortis]] in his body and sent him back to prison where his powers would be nullified.<ref>{{Cite comic|title=New Thunderbolts|issue=#12|date=November 2005}}</ref>\n\nLater, [[Hank Pym]] and [[Carol Danvers|Warbird]] offered to pardon the members of the Thunderbolts (who still had outstanding legal problems), if the Thunderbolts would attack and humiliate the New Avengers in public. However, it was later revealed that Pym and Warbird had been blackmailed into doing so.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nOnly [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] survived unscathed from the Thunderbolts' sneak attack, beating Joystick senseless. The rest of the team was beaten back before the Thunderbolts left. Songbird told Captain America that the Thunderbolts could beat the New Avengers senseless anytime they wished. In the end, it was revealed that Baron Zemo spearheaded the attack. He did this to humiliate Captain America but also to see how far the Thunderbolts would go for the chance at being pardoned.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nMeanwhile, new threats were rising as Fixer resurfaced and recruited both MACH-IV and Blizzard to work with him on a top secret project, which was also run by Zemo. Meanwhile, Speed Demon was confronted by the new female [[Doctor Spectrum#Alice Nugent|Doctor Spectrum]], who was out to reform the [[Squadron Sinister]] and take over the world. In the end, Speed Demon quit the Thunderbolts to join Dr. Spectrum while [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)#Nighthawk|Nighthawk]], the former [[Defenders (comics)|Defender]] and member of the original Squadron Sinister, was offered membership on the Thunderbolts by Songbird.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\n====Right of Power====\nSoon after Nighthawk joined the team, the Thunderbolts discovered that Photon's awareness of all space and time brought with it a vision of the destruction of the universe at his hands. As they tried to come to terms with this, they were attacked a Moonstone puppeteered by Zemo to kill Genis-Vell. When the initial strike failed, the remainder of Zemo's team revealed themselves to the Thunderbolts. Zemo explained that he had used the Moonstones to accelerate Genis' return from death, and in the process made the mistake of siphoning energy from the beginning and end of time itself, caused by inexperience with his Moonstones, creating a link between Genis and the universe that threatened to end existence. Unable to find a way to save both Genis and the universe, he concluded that the only solution was Genis's death.\n\nUnwilling to accept this Songbird led the team in combat against Zemo's group. To prevent the other Thunderbolts from intervening, Zemo revealed that Atlas' brother Smuggler had survived Graviton's massacre of the Redeemers, trapped in the [[Darkforce]] dimension. Using the prospect of his release to make Atlas stop the other Thunderbolts interfering, Zemo bested Genis in battle and, apologizing for both his mistake and the necessary solution, sliced Genis' body into pieces and scattered them through both time and the Darkforce dimension to prevent Genis returning from the dead a third time. He then fully released Smuggler. In the aftermath, Zemo&mdash;his face apparently fully healed from Moonstone's attack&mdash;and Songbird became allies and lovers.<ref>{{Cite comic|title= Thunderbolts|issue=#100|date=May 2006}}</ref>\n\n====Civil War: Hero Hunters====\n{{Main|Civil War (comics)}}\nThe new Thunderbolts engaged and defeated [[Quicksand (comics)|Quicksand]] in a battle in Denver during the early days of the superhero [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]. After this, they were summoned to Washington where they met with Iron Man, [[Mister Fantastic]], and [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]]. The three heroes, all supporting the [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]], informed Zemo that they wanted the Thunderbolts to hunt down supervillains and recruit them to the Pro-Registration cause, which would be their chance at redemption. Unknown to Iron Man, the Thunderbolts had been doing this in secret for three weeks.<ref>{{Cite comic|title=Thunderbolts|issue=#103|date=August 2006}}</ref>\n\nZemo's \"Thunderbolt Army\" grew rapidly, the team vastly expanding. It now included dozens of other supervillains, including most notably [[Doctor Octopus]], the [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]], and [[Ox (comics)|Ox]]. The new team dispersed to battle super-villains, capture them and offer them a choice: join the Thunderbolts or go to prison. Of course, they all chose to join the Thunderbolts. Baron Zemo convinced Captain America not to stop him from battling the Grandmaster, while Nighthawk was revealed as being a spy for the Squadron Sinister inside Captain America's Secret Avengers. Zemo then informed Songbird that in the coming battle, he knew that she would betray him, which she had been planning to do all along, in revenge for his killing of Photon, and he would sacrifice himself to save the world.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nZemo then saved the Wellspring of Power from the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]], who planned to use it for his own ends. Believing that all of his visions were subject to the flow of time, and that nothing was set in stone, Zemo defeated the Grandmaster, and boasted to his teammates that the power was now all his and theirs. He insisted that he would use it to help the world, despite the consequences for doing so. Songbird, who had temporarily lost her powers during the final battle, was told by Zemo, \"now is when your betrayal would have come.\" The vision of her betrayal turned out to be somewhat correct after all, though. Although she could not use her super-sound, Songbird used a simple opera note to crack the moonstones, sending Zemo into a whirlwind of cosmic time/space. In his final words before he was completely sucked into the vacuum, he screamed out that he would never have hurt a world he worked so hard to save.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nSome of the Army of Thunderbolts, consisting of [[Mac Gargan|Venom]], [[Lady Deathstrike]], [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]], [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], [[Jester (Marvel Comics)|Jester]], [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)#Steven Levins|Jack O'Lantern]] join Songbird assembled as the Pro-Registration side's task force to hunt down Anti-Registration heroes at the end of ''Civil War'' #4, but never officially saw any real combat. The Jester and Jack O'Lantern were later killed by the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Civil War'' #5 (November 2006)</ref> The two were sent to hunt down and capture Spider-Man when he attempted to leave Iron Man's Pro-Registration army.{{Issue|date=July 2010}}\n\nBullseye, Taskmaster, and Lady Deathstrike were part of the final battle of Civil War fighting alongside the Pro-Registration side, with Taskmaster wounding Mr. Fantastic when he sought to kill [[Invisible Woman]] (a member of the Anti-Registration forces). At the end of the fight, Taskmaster, Bullseye, and Deathstrike were sent to the [[Negative Zone]] prison; but Bullseye escaped{{Issue|date=April 2009}} before he could be sent, and Taskmaster was freed by [[Deadpool]] en route to the portal. Deathstrike was either released or somehow escaped on her own. She would go on to battle the [[X-Men]] during the events of \"[[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah CompleX]]\", a story arc in the X-Men related books.{{Issue|date=July 2010}}\n\nAfter the events surrounding the Wellspring, the current team disbanded. MACH-IV and the Fixer were offered jobs from the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]]. Blizzard was released from jail and left the team. Atlas was de-ionized after his encounter with the Wellspring but left catatonic and trapped in his enlarged state while Smuggler, his suit destroyed, took care of him. Joystick was imprisoned for her traitorous actions during the Wellspring debacle and Speed Demon ran away to avoid arrest. Only Songbird, Moonstone, Swordsman and the Radioactive Man, remained on the team.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #109 (February 2007)</ref>\n\n====Zemo: Born Better====\nIn the events of ''Thunderbolts: Zemo - Born Better'' mini-series, Baron Zemo found himself lost in time and in Europe, forced to witness the lives and deaths of the previous generations of \"Baron Zemos\", while being violently thrust forward in time at random points of his adventures. The journey forward in time was a prolonged \"moment of clarity\" experience for Zemo, who saw his family's true history and not the rose-colored version his father and grandfather had taught him. When he ultimately returned to the present day, Zemo discovered that a distant cousin had been responsible for his return to the present, though at a horrific cost of causing Zemo to jump forward from era to era every time his cousin murdered a family member who shared the same blood as Helmut. When Helmut discovered that his cousin rescued Zemo just so he could kill his infamous relative, Helmut refused to resist, a move that caused his cousin to attempt to take his own life before Zemo convinced him to put down his gun and stop the cycle of violence.\n\n===Norman Osborn's Thunderbolts===\n''Thunderbolts'' #110 featured a new creative team (writer [[Warren Ellis]] and artist [[Mike Deodato]]) and a new roster and direction for the team. The team was formed under the control of Norman Osborn, and the majority of the roster was made up of villains wishing to redeem themselves.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=95109 | title=Better Know a Thunderbolt: Green Goblin | work=Newsarama | date=December 21, 2006 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206203540/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=95109 | archivedate=February 6, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=95756 | title=Better Know a Thunderbolt: Moonstone | work=Newsarama | date=December 29, 2006 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127132239/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=95756 | archivedate=January 27, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=92433 | title=Better Know a Thunderbolt: Bullseye | work=Newsarama | date=November 28, 2006 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070126163051/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=92433 | archivedate=January 26, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=96554 | title=Better Know a Thunderbolt: Penance | work=Newsarama | date=January 6, 2007 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211055537/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=96554 | archivedate=February 11, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=93344 | title=Better Know a Thunderbolt: Songbird | work=Newsarama | date=December 6, 2006 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208235836/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=93344 | archivedate=December 8, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=92839 | title=Better Know a Thunderbolt: Venom | work=Newsarama | date=December 1, 2006 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128134053/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=92839 | archivedate=January 28, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe new Thunderbolts roster was as follows:\n* [[Norman Osborn]] (Leader)\n* [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] (Field leader)\n* [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]]\n* [[Robbie Baldwin|Penance]]\n* [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]]\n* [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]]\n* [[Fenris (comics)|Swordsman]]\n* [[Mac Gargan|Venom]]\n\nAfter the Marvel Comics ''Civil War'' event, the new Thunderbolts were tasked with tracking down and arresting individuals avoiding the Superhuman Registration Act. Despite the new line-up, many of the themes of the original series continued; in particular, Songbird's decision to cripple Bullseye in retaliation for the villain crippling the super-hero [[Jack Flag]], Norman Osborn's own struggle for redemption as he claimed, and the growing friendship between Songbird and Radioactive Man. Moonstone was made team leader, a move that proved to be disastrous and ultimately led to Songbird resuming control over the team and expanding the group's missions to involve regular super-hero missions besides hunting down unregistered super-heroes.\n\nDue to lengthy delays towards the end of Ellis's run, several one-shot specials<ref name=newsarama145526 /> and a ''Penance'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]]<ref name=cbr11376>{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=11376 | title=Reflections #221: Paul Jenkins, Part 2 | work=Comic Book Resources | date=September 9, 2007}}</ref> were launched to fill in the gap. The ''Penance'' limited series saw the hero formerly known as Speedball carrying out a complex scheme hatched to gain revenge against Nitro, the man who murdered his teammates the New Warriors, which put him at odds with his new teammates on the Thunderbolts. Several specials advanced other plotlines, such as the mysterious death of Songbird's mother<ref>''Thunderbolts: Breaking Point'' (January 2008)</ref> and Swordsman betraying the Thunderbolts by allying himself with [[Arnim Zola]] to resurrect his sister, after realizing that Osborn would not use his cloning technology to resurrect Andrea.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nFollowing the events of \"Caged Angels\", the various Thunderbolt specials (written by [[Christos Gage]]), and the Penance limited series, and guest appearances in ''[[Moon Knight]]''{{Issue|date=April 2010}} and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'',{{Issue|date=April 2010}} the group is thrust into the events of \"[[Secret Invasion]]\", when Thunderbolt Mountain is attacked by the [[Skrull]] [[Khn'nr]], also known as Skrull sleeper agent [[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]], just as Arnim Zola drops off the newly resurrected (via cloning technology) Andrea Strucker.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nBarely surviving the fight due to Khn'ner's inability to deal with the implanted memories inside of him belonging to Mar-Vell, the group went onto the offensive against the Skrull armada as they invaded Washington DC.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} During the fight, Andrea is teamed with her brother Swordsman, Moonstone and Bullseye under the fear that she is a Skrull spy sent to infiltrate the group. However, when Moonstone betrays Swordsman in order to join forces with the Skrulls in order to bait Andrea into revealing herself to be a Skrull, she is shocked to realize that she is a clone, culminating in Bullseye murdering her in order to save Moonstone.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} With Norman's help, Moonstone blames the Skrulls for Andrea's murder. After the Thunderbolts defeat the Skrull armada attacking Washington, D.C., as well as two Super-Skrulls, Norman begins to play up his and his team's role to the media, making them appear to be the force that is saving the Earth from Tony Stark's bungling. The Thunderbolts then journey to New York where they reluctantly aid Earth's heroes in their battle against the Skrulls.<ref name=tb122125>''Thunderbolts'' #122-125 (September \u2013 December 2008)</ref>\n\n===H.A.M.M.E.R.'s Thunderbolts===\nAfter Songbird gets mad at Osborn for leaving her to deal with a dangerous Skrull who nearly killed her, Norman Osborn and Moonstone come to the agreement to get rid of Songbird and the other Thunderbolts whose morals do not match their own.<ref name=tb125>''Thunderbolts'' #125 (December 2008)</ref> Their plan comes into effect while Norman is in Washington during the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, preparing to assume control over S.H.I.E.L.D.

Though Crossbones is more than willing to oblige, the rest are suspicious. As it turns out, it was a setup to test the team and the Raft's security measures. They are then deployed to deal with a group of [[Trolls (Marvel Comics)|Asgardian trolls]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #145 (August 2010)</ref>\n\nAfter killing two of the trolls and capturing the third (who turned out to be a girl named [[Troll (Marvel Comics)|Gunna]] who was raised by trolls), the group is reprimanded by Cage for the death of the two trolls.

After getting Thunderbolts introduced to the students, the prison's power grid suddenly shut down due to an [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]], allowing the Raft's inmates to escape. Together with Warden Walker (U.S. Agent) and the staff of Avengers Academy, the Thunderbolts manage to detain all escaped prisoners.

Juggernaut is left at the Raft while the alpha and beta team went on to a mission in Iraq, as zombies emerge from the area. In that moment, a Worthy hammer falls inside the prison and is taken immediately by Juggernaut (who feels also the calling of Cytorak). The hammer ends up transforming Kuurth: Breaker of Stone who ends up destroying the Raft, which led to most of its inmates escaping.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #158</ref> The alpha and beta teams are called back to the raft to capture and control inmates, and work to clear the rubble. During the process, Centurius manages to find the controls for the beta team's nanites and disable them. The beta team decides to wait for a better time to escape, as they reason that more heroes may be on the way to help the raft. Meanwhile, Moonstone restores order to the partially collapsed women's' wing of the prison, as Ghost helps the warden avert a crisis in a section of the prison where a malfunctioning failsafe is suffocating inmates. Crossbones, an ex-member of the Thunderbolts, with the help of another inmate, escapes the raft in the chaos.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #159</ref> After order is restored, the alpha team, including Songbird and Mach V, is sent to subdue Juggernaut/Kuurth, with the beta team and Fixer held in reserve. To the team's surprise, Man-Thing becomes uncontrollable, and teleports away before they fight Juggernaut.

Eventually, jumping around in time, the team encounter themselves as the original Thunderbolts (1997) and ends with the renaming of the title into ''Dark Avengers''<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #175</ref> although the storyline carries through.\n\n===Red Hulk's Thunderbolts===\nA new team composed of [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]], [[Deadpool]], [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]], and [[Punisher]] debuted as a part of [[Marvel NOW!]] major relaunch. Written by Daniel Way with drawings by Steve Dillon. This incarnation is not a government-sponsored team.<ref name=\"newsarama.com\"/>\n\nRed Hulk assembles his incarnation of the Thunderbolts to be a strike team that is close to \"Code Red.\" He has gathered Deadpool, Elektra, Punisher, and Agent Venom because \"their conditions cannot be cured.\" Red Hulk has his Thunderbolts do things that are similar to [[X-Force]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 2 #1</ref> Red Hulk has obtained Samuel Sterns' body and hooks it up to a machine that emits Red Gamma Radiation onto Samuel Sterns.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 2 #2</ref> Deadpool later finds [[Leader (comics)|Samuel Sterns']] as a Red Leader with no apparent powers as he expresses his view that the Punisher won't be pleased. Punisher finds Red Leader's body and shoots him between the eyes disrupting whatever plans Red Hulk has for Red Leader.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 2 #3</ref>\n\nRed Hulk brings the Thunderbolts along to deal with gamma technology on the island of Kata Jaya where the technology was supplied by [[Madman (Marvel Comics)|Madman]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 2 #4</ref> During the fight against Madman, Red Hulk took the Leader to a pipe line that feeds Gamma energy to Madman's lab. Red Hulk then absorbed the energy himself and then forced fed it to the Leader, bringing him back to life.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 2 #5</ref> Red Leader is revived, but doesn't possess his prior intellect. They do get into the Madman's bunker to find out that The Leader hid his intellect on the internet. Madman confronts them and Leader promises to unlock his intellect to his brother, but after whispering one secret word his brother drops dead\u2014his brain not being able to handle all of the information.\n\nThe team then follows leads for the supplies of the gamma radiation technology to Kabul to discover Elektra's brother [[Elektra (comics)#Family and early life|Orestez Natchios]] is creating an army of [[Crimson Dynamo]]s powered by gamma radiation.<ref>Thunderbolts Volume 2 issue 7</ref> Elektra runs off with her brother and claims to have killed him, but Punisher realizes she was lying and kills him himself. During this fiasco, the Red Leader secretly gains access to the internet and downloads his intellect off the internet despite his body not being able to physically contain it (he suffers from profuse nose bleeds).<ref>Thunderbolts Volume 2 issue 12</ref>\n\nThe Team decides that they can't do only missions for Red Hulk, as none truly trust him, so a system of give and take missions is developed, in which the team does a mission for General Ross, then a mission for a random member. The first random name pulled for a member is Punisher, who chooses a mission to take out a crime family in New York.<ref>Thunderbolts Volume 2 issue 13</ref> The story arc takes place during the crossover event [[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]. It turns out the Leader purposefully tricked the team into letting him pick the next mission, since he had no skin in the game, so he can escape. He wasn't expecting an alien invasion. While trying to escape the team's submarine, Red Leader begins to get his brain siphoned by [[Black Order (comics)|Supergiant of Thanos' Black Order]], but is saved by Red Hulk. He reluctantly releases Mercy and is forced by Red Hulk to trick her into destroying the Black Order's flag ship. Afterwards, Red Leader starts having visions of how to kill every member of the Team, but determines that something is wrong with his plan, there was an unseen variable that stopped him from succeeding. That variable presents itself mainly in the form of Abigail Mercy, who joined Ross's Thunderbolts team as a condition for her release.<ref>Thunderbolts Volume 2 issue 19</ref>\n\n[[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]] joins the team in order to stop Mercy, who is getting too powerful to control, but inadvertently drags the team to hell. Leader negotiates a contract with [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] to put him back in power of the Underworld by overthrowing the current leader of hell, [[Strong Guy]], who gave up his soul to save his love.

He wants to let the symbiote take over and have the team fight it, which they do, to reassure him that if he would lose control of the symbiote, there would be someone that could stop him.<ref>Thunderbolts Volume 2 issue 23</ref>\n\nThe team then travels to a haunted swamp in [[Honduras]] to find an ancient artifact. Leader is the only one who can translate the ancient language. During the boat ride, Leader whispers something cryptic from an ancient language and Johnny Blaze loses his powers and is killed by a tentacled monster. Leader then betrays the team by promising their river guide to help ambush the team, but then doubles crosses him and alerts the team, who them quickly dispose of the ambushers. Leader then tricks the team into entering the secret temple via bobby trapped entrance. Ross survives and finds the power of the temple, an infant [[Celestial (comics)|celestial head]]. Leader attempts to drink the Celestial's blood, but this causes his brain to explode. One of Ross' former squadmates, Mancuso, is waiting for him and powered by the Celestial. Mancuso warns him that if Ross continues his selfish ways he will be forced to use his cosmic powers to kill him. Ross realizes that he pushes his team too hard and constantly endangers them, so Mansuco teleports them back to before the briefing. Ross decides not to travel to Honduras.<ref>Thunderbolts Volume 2 issue 26</ref>\n\nMuch later, the team tracked down [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Doctor Faustus]]. The [[Punisher]] wanted to kill him for murdering all the children in a high school. Red Hulk stopped him and wanted to recruit Faustus, but the Punisher does not like the idea and quits the team. While going to the refrigerator at his safe house, the Punisher found a bomb with a note saying, \"You don't quit on us. You're fired.\"<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 2 #27</ref> Angered, the Punisher believes Red Hulk set the bomb and began hunting down his former teammates. He snipers Leader and Faustus. He decapitates Deadpool, who is not angry and actually flattered that Frank found him a threat. He steals magic regalia from [[Elsa Bloodstone|Bloodstone]] and depowers Ghost Rider, but Johnny Blaze is actually glad to be freed of the demon.<ref>''Thunderbolts Vol. 2 #28</ref> Punisher can't bring himself to kill Elektra, but does confess that he killed her brother. She then admits she knew he would kill her brother. Punisher then uses a customized [[Hulkbusters|Hulkbuster armor]] with a special gun that depowers Red Hulk temporarily. During a gruesome hand-to-hand combat between Ross and Castle, Hawkeye and his new team of Avengers arrest both of them. It is later revealed that Red Leader was alive and set the bomb knowing the Punisher will come after each member of the Thunderbolts and set a Life Model Decoy to fool the other Thunderbolts.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 2 #31</ref> The Avengers and Thunderbolts return to Kata Jaya and arrest Leader who is their new dictator. Ross then decides to disband the team.\n\nThe annual takes place before the team disbands and follow the team as they work up with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.#W.A.N.D.|W.A.N.D.]], S.H.I.E.L.D.'s paranormal research department, in order to take down an out of control Doctor Strange.<ref>Thunderbolts Annual Vol 2 #1</ref>\n\n===Winter Soldier's Thunderbolts===\nIt has been announced that a new team led by the Winter Soldier will form following the events of the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline.

In exchange, they agree to form the Thunderbolts with the mission to make sure that S.H.I.E.L.D. never uses the Kobik Project again.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 3 #1</ref>\n\nOver the course of this 12-issue run, Bucky's Thunderbolts team clashes with the All-New Inhumans, Squadron Supreme, mysterious alien invaders and others. They also frequently test the limits of Kobik's terrifying, reality-bending cosmic powers. The girl is the one who magically manifests the team's arctic headquarters and even resolves Fixer's time travel-loop conundrum that has lingered since the \"Thunderbolts Throughout Time\" storyline.\n\nFollowing the '''Civil War II''' event, the team reunites with Songbird as they rescue Bucky from an altered, secretly fascist Captain America. She remains with the team, briefly reuniting her romance with Abe Jenkins (MACH-X). In the lead up to the '''Secret Empire''' event, Zemo attacks the Thunderbolts' base with the latest incarnation of the Masters of Evil. As that confrontation begins to unfold, Jolt is transported back from Counter Earth just in time to save Atlas from arctic exposure. \n\nLater, Zemo makes a nefarious offer the original Thunderbolts members: give in to their darker natures and join the new rise of Hydra... or die. Abe and Melissa reject the offer, but Fixer, Moonstone, and Atlas ultimately leave the ruins of the HQ with Zemo's Masters of Evil. In the aftermath of the destruction, Songbird scours the snowy horizon for Abe, who is presumed dead, while Ghost\u2014who has been spying on the Thunderbolts for some time\u2014rescues a pocket-sized Jolt, who has shrunk due to her power exertion during the battle with the Masters of Evil.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 3 #10</ref>\n\n===Punisher: War on the Streets===\nAfter losing custody of Frank Castle in his fledgling country of Bagalia, Baron Zemo flees to New York City. There, he approaches the current mayor, Kingpin, in hopes of joining forces and finally taking on revenge on the Punisher. Fearing a public relations disaster, Kingpin reluctantly agrees\u2014and is promptly dismayed when Zemo reveals a new team of Thunderbolts at a mayoral press conference.\n\nLed by Zemo\u2014once again disguised as Citizen V\u2014this Thunderbolts team includes Fixer, Ghost, Moonstone, Radioactive Man, and an armored/disguised Jigsaw, who had just previously helped Zemo battle Punisher back in Bagalia. Kingpin and Citizen V announce to a cheering crowd that the Thunderbolts will work with newly-arrived U.N. forces (who are, in fact, Zemo's disguised Hydra soldiers) and a covert team of NYPD officers to rid the city of Punisher.<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 12 #13</ref>\n\nZemo and his team are able to surprise Frank Castle once, but are thwarted by Black Widow.<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 12 #14</ref> Moonstone and Kingpin ultimately goad an over-confident Zemo into confronting Punisher again and \"Citizen V\" musters a rousing speech to rally spooked Hydra agents. The Thunderbolts then clash with Castle again\u2014but discover that the vigilante has reluctantly partnered with a team of other street-level operatives, including Black Widow, Moon Knight, [[Rachel Cole-Alves]], and even Frank's old Thunderbolts teammate, Ghost Rider. The battle is fierce and even though Frank shoots down Fixer (or possibly a robotic copy) and corners \"Citizen V,\" Jigsaw intervenes... and the Thunderbolts escape with Rachel as a hostage. As they flee, Zemo challenges Frank to come retrieve her... alone.<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 12 #15</ref>\n\n==Members==\n{{Main|List of Thunderbolts members}}\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===''Contest of Champions''===\nThe 2015 ''[[Marvel: Contest of Champions#Contest of Champions (2015)|Contest of Champions]]'' comic series features a universe where Iron Man and the Pro-Registration won Civil War with everything going in Tony's favor for five years.

Axum joined an underground fighting circuit that employed other supervillains, including the [[Armadillo (comics)|Armadillo]]. Axum, along with fellow combatant Man-Killer, turned on his criminal manager Rey Trueno, and refused to return to the supervillain lifestyle.

Introduced in \"The Thunderbolts\", this superhero team has been doing some heroics with Gabby Talbott (voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]) as their publicist. The Thunderbolts are first seen when they help the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] take down [[Growing Man]]. The press ends up giving the Thunderbolts the credit. [[Iron Man]] and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] later tracked them to their headquarters and had a brief altercation until [[Justin Hammer]]'s bomb nearly wiped them out. When it came to Hammer's three possible bunkers, each member of both teams went to a location and fought the [[Mandroid]]s. It was through one location that Iron Man and Citizen V found Gabby's connections with Hammer. At the latest bunker, the Avengers and the Thunderbolts fought the Mega-Mandroid equipped with forcefield abilities. Thanks to Meteorite phasing through, the Mega-Mandroid was defeated and Hammer is handed over to authorities. Citizen V took the opportunity to fire Gabby as Iron Man is believed to think that the Thunderbolts are good guys after all. In the episode \"Thunderbolts Revealed\", the Thunderbolts help the Avengers defeat [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Ulysses Klaue]] even when a device secretly planted on Klaue and the Vibranium contains merged them together. Suspicious of the Thunderbolts, [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] finds out that the group were the [[Masters of Evil]] disguised thanks to an Inversion Stabilizer. Luckily, the Avengers show up, resulting a fight between the two groups. After being saved from death by [[Captain America]] during the fight and seeing what it's like be a hero, Songbird convinces the rest of the team to turn on Zemo. The Avengers and Thunderbolts together expose Zemo as Citizen V, leading to Zemo fighting both groups. While they might not have seen the last of Zemo, Hawkeye advises to the other members that they should turn themselves in and that they will be official heroes when they get out.\n*It was announced that a Thunderbolts TV series or movie is in early development by Marvel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mcucosmic.com/2019/11/07/early-development-on-thunderbolts-has-begun/|title=Early Development on \u2018Thunderbolts\u2019 Has Begun|date=November 7, 2019|website=MCU Cosmic|author=Jeremy Conrad|accessdate=November 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Video games===\n* Most of the post-Civil War Thunderbolts appear in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]''.
