ASUTECH which was established through Law No. 7 of 30 July 1980 by the Government of the old Anambra operated as a multi-campus university, with campuses in Abakiliki, Enugu, Awka and Nnewi.\nIn 1991, following the split of the old Anambra State into Anambra and Enugu States, the Awka and Nnewi campuses of the former ASUTECH were constituted into Nnamdi Azikiwe University by the Anambra State Edict No.5 26 November 1991. Nnamdi Azikiwe University was taken over by the Federal Government by Decree No. 34 on 15 July 1992.\nIn 1991, after the former Anambra State was split into Anambra and Enugu States, the Awka and Nnewi campuses of the former Anambra State University of Technology (ASUTECH) were combined into Nnamdi Azikiwe University, which was later taken over by Federal government. The university is named after [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]], the first president of Nigeria. The Awka Campus became Nnamdi Azikiwe University.

Only the \"Administrateurs agr\u00e9\u00e9s\" registered on the Ordre board are permitted to use the title of \"Administrateur Agr\u00e9\u00e9\" (Adm.A.) or \"Certified Management Consultant\" (cmc) if they hold a valid license to this end. The OAAQ also administers the title of \"Financial Planner\" (Pl.Fin.) for its members who are the bearer, under an agreement between the OAAQ and the AMF (Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers).\n\n== Mission ==\n\nBased on [[Professional Code of Quebec]], the primary mission of OAAQ is to protect the public by regulating the professional practice of their members. The \"Ordre des Administrateurs agr\u00e9\u00e9s du Qu\u00e9bec\" promotes innovation and achievement of a higher level of competence for professionals in the administration so that they contribute proactively and dynamically to the development of companies and organizations.\n\n== Fundamental principles and functions of Good Management ==\n\nThe professional practice models of Adm.A. are articulated around the fundamental principles and functions of good management. Good management is generally perceived as management as a \"good father\" or as a \"reasonable and prudent person\", and is enriched by principles that take into account the current tools and contexts of the administration.\n\nThe six fundamental principles of the sound management of the \"Ordre des administrateurs agr\u00e9\u00e9s du Qu\u00e9bec\" are the basis of the profession of certified administrator:<ref>[http://www.adma.qc.ca/Ordre/Valeurs.aspx?sc_lang=en-CA Official site of the \"Ordre des administrateurs agr\u00e9\u00e9s du Qu\u00e9bec\" (Chartered Administrators Order of Quebec)]</ref>\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n1.'''Transparency''': An Adm.A. must keep his client informed of all the actions he takes in the context of managing the client file. He must disclose his professional status, partnership, professional or business relationship and method of remuneration for sums awarded, received or receivable from a third party in connection with a mandate executed with a client, including salaries, bonuses, fees, contingency fees, commissions, referral fees, fee-for-service, exchange of services and other benefits;\n\n2.'''Continuity''': An Adm.A. must ensure that interventions or actions taken are documented at all times so that another contact person can ensure the succession of Adm.A. practicing in GPP in the event of absence or incapacity, in particular vacation, sickness, and even death of the Adm.A. assigned to the file;\n\n3.'''Efficiency''': An Adm.A. must ensure that the resources (human, financial, material and organizational) are minimized and that the agreed outcomes are maximized, respecting the client's comfort zone, and managing their personal and family affairs. It must ensure the quality, accuracy and relevance of all its interventions on the file, reports, recommendations and those of other stakeholders under its authority;\n\n4.'''Fairness''': An Adm.A. must adequately address all needs and objectives by reconciling them, prioritizing them and applying a management approach based on the overall or segmented professional practice process;\n\n5.'''Equity''': An Adm.A. must ensure an adequate quality and quantity of services in return for the benefits derived from the business relationship with the customer. This service must meet or exceed generally accepted industry standards.\n}}\n'''Competencies linked to the administration'''\n\nIn addition, an Adm.A. professional practice is based on sound management, which is divided into five competencies linked to the administration:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n# '''Plan''': consists of prospecting about the mission, vision, values, culture, strategies, issues, environment, objectives and risks, and establishing an appropriate plan at both strategic and tactical levels;\n# '''Coordinate/organize''': involves mobilizing the client's business, resources and assets within a process (team, service, policy, strategy, etc.) to facilitate the achievement of objectives;\n# '''Lead''': involves establishing actions and relationships and synchronizing business, resources and client wealth to achieve goals and optimize assets and value creation;\n# '''Control''': is to ensure proper functioning and retrospect on results and administrative activities;\n# '''Advise''': consists of helping to improve a client's administrative and business practices as well as individual and organizational performance.<ref>\"Charte des comp\u00e9tences de l'administrateur agree\" (English: Charter of competencies of chartered administrator), published in 2014 by the OAAQ.</ref>\nNote: The first four administrative competencies correspond to the basic administrative functions (functions) taught in all university faculties of administration sciences.\n}}\n\n== Major areas of activities: Managerial and patrimonial ==\n\nThe \"Ordre des administrateurs agr\u00e9\u00e9s du Qu\u00e9bec\" (the Order of the ADMA) is a group of managers or advisors from all walks of life. Adm.A. members are distinguished in various areas of management, ethics and governance. These professionals work in a multitude of fields of professional activities which are grouped in the following two spheres:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* '''Managerial''': Adm.A. working within small, medium or large organizations. They include corporate presidents, general managers, managers and expert advisers in the fields of finance, management, managerial financial planning, human resources, administration of education, [[real estate]], franchising and partnership, health, information technology, [[public administration]], and more. The generally accepted professional practice model of \"[[Certified Management Consultant]]\"<ref>[http://www.cmc-canada.ca/home Web site CMC Canada]</ref> (cmc) is part of the managerial field.\n* '''Patrimonial''': Adm.A. engaged in the administration of the property of others held by individuals, businesses or trusts. This sphere of professional practice includes in particular the roles of advisory services, management of the property of others (eg, [[mandatary]], [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]], [[trustee]], [[tutor]], receiver, condominium administrator...) and support roles such as asset monitoring, patrimonial audit, patrimonial mediation/arbitration... The generally accepted professional practice model of \"[[Financial Planner]]s\" (Pl.fin.) is part of the patrimonial domain. The book \"Gestion de patrimoine priv\u00e9 - Guide des meilleures pratiques\" (translation: Private Wealth Management - Guide to Best Practices), published in 2008 by the publisher CCH, in partnership with the OAAQ, describes the best practices in patrimonial administration and provides convenience tools to professionals.\n}}\nThe multidisciplinary nature of the \"Administrateurs agr\u00e9\u00e9s\" confers on the \"Ordre des Administrateurs agrees\" a real center of expertise for management issues, which increasingly complex. The Adm.A. members are gathered to share their knowledge and experiences, to find solutions to management issues and problems, to put forward some lines of thought. This synergy helps to advance the profession through innovation and to development.\n\nThe Adm.A. contribute objectively and competently to the progress and leadership of the administrative sciences.\n\n==Title \"Financial Planner\" (Pl.Fin.)==\n\nSince 1991, the OAAQ is regulating the designation \"Financial Planner\" (F.P.) worn by its members who graduated from the [[Institut qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de planification financi\u00e8re]] (English: Institute of Financial Planning of Quebec) (IQPF) which provides the basic training leading to the title.\n\nUnder the aegis of the OAAQ, the P.F. (Pl.Fin.) membership reached about 650 members in 2002-2003. Until December 2002, the OAAQ administered in [[Quebec]] the title of \"RFP-Registered Financial Planner\" to which the Adm.A. Pl.Fin. could qualify; this title was issued by the \"Canadian Association of Financial Planners\" (CAFP), which merged with CAIFA (Canadian Association of insurance and Financial Advisor) in 2003 to become Advocis.\n\nIn 2004, following extensive studies and consultations, the OAAQ repositioned the generally accepted practice model of Adm.A. Pl.Fin. to the patrimonial administration. This expanded practice model covers the roles of administering the property of others and supporting roles related to patrimonial administration.\n\nThe \"Financial Planning Competency Charter\" was designed in 1998 by the OAAQ and was updated in 2001. This charter describes the professional skills required to practice as a \"[[Financial Planner]]\" within the OAAQ. In 2004, the OAAQ launched the first edition of the book \"Guide des meilleures pratiques en gestion de patrimoine priv\u00e9\" (translation: \"Guide to Best Practices in Private Wealth Management\"). In June 2008, publisher CCH, in partnership with the OAAQ, published the second edition of the book entitled \"Gestion de patrimoine priv\u00e9 - Guide des meilleures pratiques\" (translation: \"Private Wealth Management - Best Practice Guide\") (741 pages).\n\n==Title \"Certified Management Consultant\" (CMC)==\n\nSince 1994, the Order of ADMA has applied to supervise, develop and promote the profession of [[Certified Management Consultant]] (CMC) in [[Quebec]]. By February 2014, this designation was recognized in 50 countries. This designation is administered by CMC Canada<ref>[http://www.cmc-canada.ca/home CMC Canada website (ICMCI)]</ref> and internationally by the \"International Council of Management Consulting Institutes\".\n\nThe CMC title is the only recognized management title in the world. This designation aims at high standards of professional management skills, in particular through advanced training and by instructing the professional on the various aspects of the managerial administration.\n\nIn Quebec, at first instance, the holders of the CMC title apply the OAAQ code of ethics. In addition, the CMC-Canada uniform Canada-wide code of ethics is respected by all CMAs. in Canada; it contains provisions relating to integrity, objectivity, transparency, competence, conflicts of interest, invoicing, quality of services, etc. CMC-Canada has also developed a Common Knowledge and Competency Charter (CBK) that includes all the knowledge and skills required to practice the profession of management consultant. This charter is explained in the book \"Management Consulting: An Introduction to the Methodologies, Tools and Techniques of the Profession\", which is offered free to new members C.M.C. CMC-Canada is planning soon to release more elaborate volumes covering six functional areas (financial management, human resources management, information technology management, marketing management, operations management and strategic management).\n\nThe \"Canadian Charter of Competencies\" covers nine areas:\n1. Appreciate the company's situation, challenges and opportunities;\n2. Assist clients in developing strategies for improvement;\n3. Help clients implement a recommendation;\n4. Carry out an advisory mission;\n5. Demonstrate interpersonal skills;\n6. Demonstrate personal skills;\n7. Demonstrate ethical behavior;\n8. Demonstrates functional competence;\n9. Demonstrate a global vision of management.\n\n== Administration of the condominium ==\nMany members Adm.A. have developed special expertise to practice their professional practice in this condominium management which constitutes a collective heritage. This domain integrates the patrimonial administration of the collective heritage and the managerial management of the operations of the co-ownership. The OAAQ is particularly involved in the supervision of this field of activities through information, training and instrumentation. The OAAQ is a partner of McGill University for the certificate program in co-ownership: [http://www.lacopropriete.info/DATA/DOCUMENT/SECTION/66~v~certificat-de-professionnement-professionnel-en-Gestion-de-copropriete.pdf Certificate of professional development in condominium management].\n\nA website on condominium management was launched on June 16, 2015. Under the auspices of the [[Chambre des notaires du Qu\u00e9bec]] (Chamber of Notaries of Quebec), at the request of the \"Quebec Department of Justice\", this site is a follow-up to one of the recommendations contained in the \"Report of the Advisory Committee on Co-ownership (2013)\" on the large-scale dissemination of quality information on condominium law.\n\nThis portal on co-ownership brings together the expertise of self-regulatory organizations (notably the \"Ordre des administrateurs agr\u00e9\u00e9s du Qu\u00e9bec\") whose members play a significant role in this field. This site provides useful information for developers, unions, buyers and sellers.\n\n[Http://www.lacopropriete.info/ Co-ownership information site developed in partnership with the OAAQ]\n\n== History ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\nThis \"Corporation des administrateurs professionnels\" (in English: Corporation of professionals administrators), comes from the ''Association des L.S.C. de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Laval'' (Association of L.S.C. Of Laval University), which had set up a committee in 1953 to study the question of the professional status of management graduates. The primary purpose of establishing a professional association was to gain recognition equivalent to that of members of the accounting profession; around 1945, the latter being considered as the only true legitimate professionals in the business world.\n\nThis new corporation was dedicated to the defense of the interests of its members and to the promotion of the profession of administrator.\n\n'''From ''professional corporation'' to ''Professional Order'''''\n\nIn 1994, amendments to the [[Professional Code of Quebec]] and the measures adopted by the [[Office des professions du Qu\u00e9bec]] changed the orientation of the organization that became the ''Ordre des administrateurs agr\u00e9\u00e9s du Qu\u00e9bec'' (OAAQ). The mission of the OAAQ is redefined and therefore includes a component to defend the interests of the public. The ''Order of ADMA'' now requires its members to contract professional liability insurance when they deal directly with the public.\n\n'''Highlights''':\n* '''1954 '''- The Corporation of Professional Administrators was incorporated on August 30, 1954 and the first bylaws were enacted.

Only the \"Administrateurs agr\u00e9\u00e9s\" registered on the Ordre board are permitted to use the title of \"Administrateur Agr\u00e9\u00e9\" (Adm.A.) or \"Certified Management Consultant\" (cmc) if they hold a valid license to this end. The OAAQ also administers the title of \"Financial Planner\" (Pl.Fin.) for its members who are the bearer, under an agreement between the OAAQ and the AMF (Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers).\n\n== Mission ==\n\nBased on [[Professional Code of Quebec]], the primary mission of OAAQ is to protect the public by regulating the professional practice of their members. The \"Ordre des Administrateurs agr\u00e9\u00e9s du Qu\u00e9bec\" promotes innovation and achievement of a higher level of competence for professionals in the administration so that they contribute proactively and dynamically to the development of companies and organizations.\n\n== Fundamental principles and functions of Good Management ==\n\nThe professional practice models of Adm.A. are articulated around the fundamental principles and functions of good management. Good management is generally perceived as management as a \"good father\" or as a \"reasonable and prudent person\", and is enriched by principles that take into account the current tools and contexts of the administration.\n\nThe six fundamental principles of the sound management of the \"Ordre des administrateurs agr\u00e9\u00e9s du Qu\u00e9bec\" are the basis of the profession of certified administrator:<ref>[http://www.adma.qc.ca/Ordre/Valeurs.aspx?sc_lang=en-CA Official site of the \"Ordre des administrateurs agr\u00e9\u00e9s du Qu\u00e9bec\" (Chartered Administrators Order of Quebec)]</ref>\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n1.'''Transparency''': An Adm.A. must keep his client informed of all the actions he takes in the context of managing the client file. He must disclose his professional status, partnership, professional or business relationship and method of remuneration for sums awarded, received or receivable from a third party in connection with a mandate executed with a client, including salaries, bonuses, fees, contingency fees, commissions, referral fees, fee-for-service, exchange of services and other benefits;\n\n2.'''Continuity''': An Adm.A. must ensure that interventions or actions taken are documented at all times so that another contact person can ensure the succession of Adm.A. practicing in GPP in the event of absence or incapacity, in particular vacation, sickness, and even death of the Adm.A. assigned to the file;\n\n3.'''Efficiency''': An Adm.A. must ensure that the resources (human, financial, material and organizational) are minimized and that the agreed outcomes are maximized, respecting the client's comfort zone, and managing their personal and family affairs. It must ensure the quality, accuracy and relevance of all its interventions on the file, reports, recommendations and those of other stakeholders under its authority;\n\n4.'''Fairness''': An Adm.A. must adequately address all needs and objectives by reconciling them, prioritizing them and applying a management approach based on the overall or segmented professional practice process;\n\n5.'''Equity''': An Adm.A. must ensure an adequate quality and quantity of services in return for the benefits derived from the business relationship with the customer. This service must meet or exceed generally accepted industry standards.\n}}\n'''Competencies linked to the administration'''\n\nIn addition, an Adm.A. professional practice is based on sound management, which is divided into five competencies linked to the administration:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n# '''Plan''': consists of prospecting about the mission, vision, values, culture, strategies, issues, environment, objectives and risks, and establishing an appropriate plan at both strategic and tactical levels;\n# '''Coordinate/organize''': involves mobilizing the client's business, resources and assets within a process (team, service, policy, strategy, etc.) to facilitate the achievement of objectives;\n# '''Lead''': involves establishing actions and relationships and synchronizing business, resources and client wealth to achieve goals and optimize assets and value creation;\n# '''Control''': is to ensure proper functioning and retrospect on results and administrative activities;\n# '''Advise''': consists of helping to improve a client's administrative and business practices as well as individual and organizational performance.<ref>\"Charte des comp\u00e9tences de l'administrateur agree\" (English: Charter of competencies of chartered administrator), published in 2014 by the OAAQ.</ref>\nNote: The first four administrative competencies correspond to the basic administrative functions (functions) taught in all university faculties of administration sciences.\n}}\n\n== Major areas of activities: Managerial and patrimonial ==\n\nThe \"Ordre des administrateurs agr\u00e9\u00e9s du Qu\u00e9bec\" (the Order of the ADMA) is a group of managers or advisors from all walks of life. Adm.A. members are distinguished in various areas of management, ethics and governance. These professionals work in a multitude of fields of professional activities which are grouped in the following two spheres:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* '''Managerial''': Adm.A. working within small, medium or large organizations. They include corporate presidents, general managers, managers and expert advisers in the fields of finance, management, managerial financial planning, human resources, administration of education, [[real estate]], franchising and partnership, health, information technology, [[public administration]], and more. The generally accepted professional practice model of \"[[Certified Management Consultant]]\"<ref>[http://www.cmc-canada.ca/home Web site CMC Canada]</ref> (cmc) is part of the managerial field.\n* '''Patrimonial''': Adm.A. engaged in the administration of the property of others held by individuals, businesses or trusts. This sphere of professional practice includes in particular the roles of advisory services, management of the property of others (eg, [[mandatary]], [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]], [[trustee]], [[tutor]], receiver, condominium administrator...) and support roles such as asset monitoring, patrimonial audit, patrimonial mediation/arbitration... The generally accepted professional practice model of \"[[Financial Planner]]s\" (Pl.fin.) is part of the patrimonial domain. The book \"Gestion de patrimoine priv\u00e9 - Guide des meilleures pratiques\" (translation: Private Wealth Management - Guide to Best Practices), published in 2008 by the publisher CCH, in partnership with the OAAQ, describes the best practices in patrimonial administration and provides convenience tools to professionals.\n}}\nThe multidisciplinary nature of the \"Administrateurs agr\u00e9\u00e9s\" confers on the \"Ordre des Administrateurs agrees\" a real center of expertise for management issues, which increasingly complex. The Adm.A. members are gathered to share their knowledge and experiences, to find solutions to management issues and problems, to put forward some lines of thought. This synergy helps to advance the profession through innovation and to development.\n\nThe Adm.A. contribute objectively and competently to the progress and leadership of the administrative sciences.\n\n==Title \"Financial Planner\" (Pl.Fin.)==\n\nSince 1991, the OAAQ is regulating the designation \"Financial Planner\" (F.P.) worn by its members who graduated from the [[Institut qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de planification financi\u00e8re]] (English: Institute of Financial Planning of Quebec) (IQPF) which provides the basic training leading to the title.\n\nUnder the aegis of the OAAQ, the P.F. (Pl.Fin.) membership reached about 650 members in 2002-2003. Until December 2002, the OAAQ administered in [[Quebec]] the title of \"RFP-Registered Financial Planner\" to which the Adm.A. Pl.Fin. could qualify; this title was issued by the \"Canadian Association of Financial Planners\" (CAFP), which merged with CAIFA (Canadian Association of insurance and Financial Advisor) in 2003 to become Advocis.\n\nIn 2004, following extensive studies and consultations, the OAAQ repositioned the generally accepted practice model of Adm.A. Pl.Fin. to the patrimonial administration. This expanded practice model covers the roles of administering the property of others and supporting roles related to patrimonial administration.\n\nThe \"Financial Planning Competency Charter\" was designed in 1998 by the OAAQ and was updated in 2001. This charter describes the professional skills required to practice as a \"[[Financial Planner]]\" within the OAAQ. In 2004, the OAAQ launched the first edition of the book \"Guide des meilleures pratiques en gestion de patrimoine priv\u00e9\" (translation: \"Guide to Best Practices in Private Wealth Management\"). In June 2008, publisher CCH, in partnership with the OAAQ, published the second edition of the book entitled \"Gestion de patrimoine priv\u00e9 - Guide des meilleures pratiques\" (translation: \"Private Wealth Management - Best Practice Guide\") (741 pages).\n\n==Title \"Certified Management Consultant\" (CMC)==\n\nSince 1994, the Order of ADMA has applied to supervise, develop and promote the profession of [[Certified Management Consultant]] (CMC) in [[Quebec]]. By February 2014, this designation was recognized in 50 countries. This designation is administered by CMC Canada<ref>[http://www.cmc-canada.ca/home CMC Canada website (ICMCI)]</ref> and internationally by the \"International Council of Management Consulting Institutes\".\n\nThe CMC title is the only recognized management title in the world. This designation aims at high standards of professional management skills, in particular through advanced training and by instructing the professional on the various aspects of the managerial administration.\n\nIn Quebec, at first instance, the holders of the CMC title apply the OAAQ code of ethics. In addition, the CMC-Canada uniform Canada-wide code of ethics is respected by all CMAs. in Canada; it contains provisions relating to integrity, objectivity, transparency, competence, conflicts of interest, invoicing, quality of services, etc. CMC-Canada has also developed a Common Knowledge and Competency Charter (CBK) that includes all the knowledge and skills required to practice the profession of management consultant. This charter is explained in the book \"Management Consulting: An Introduction to the Methodologies, Tools and Techniques of the Profession\", which is offered free to new members C.M.C. CMC-Canada is planning soon to release more elaborate volumes covering six functional areas (financial management, human resources management, information technology management, marketing management, operations management and strategic management).\n\nThe \"Canadian Charter of Competencies\" covers nine areas:\n1. Appreciate the company's situation, challenges and opportunities;\n2. Assist clients in developing strategies for improvement;\n3. Help clients implement a recommendation;\n4. Carry out an advisory mission;\n5. Demonstrate interpersonal skills;\n6. Demonstrate personal skills;\n7. Demonstrate ethical behavior;\n8. Demonstrates functional competence;\n9. Demonstrate a global vision of management.\n\n== Administration of the condominium ==\nMany members Adm.A. have developed special expertise to practice their professional practice in this condominium management which constitutes a collective heritage. This domain integrates the patrimonial administration of the collective heritage and the managerial management of the operations of the co-ownership. The OAAQ is particularly involved in the supervision of this field of activities through information, training and instrumentation. The OAAQ is a partner of McGill University for the certificate program in co-ownership: [http://www.lacopropriete.info/DATA/DOCUMENT/SECTION/66~v~certificat-de-professionnement-professionnel-en-Gestion-de-copropriete.pdf Certificate of professional development in condominium management].\n\nA website on condominium management was launched on June 16, 2015. Under the auspices of the [[Chambre des notaires du Qu\u00e9bec]] (Chamber of Notaries of Quebec), at the request of the \"Quebec Department of Justice\", this site is a follow-up to one of the recommendations contained in the \"Report of the Advisory Committee on Co-ownership (2013)\" on the large-scale dissemination of quality information on condominium law.\n\nThis portal on co-ownership brings together the expertise of self-regulatory organizations (notably the \"Ordre des administrateurs agr\u00e9\u00e9s du Qu\u00e9bec\") whose members play a significant role in this field. This site provides useful information for developers, unions, buyers and sellers.\n\n[Http://www.lacopropriete.info/ Co-ownership information site developed in partnership with the OAAQ]\n\n== History ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\nThis \"Corporation des administrateurs professionnels\" (in English: Corporation of professionals administrators), comes from the ''Association des L.S.C. de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Laval'' (Association of L.S.C. Of Laval University), which had set up a committee in 1953 to study the question of the professional status of management graduates. The primary purpose of establishing a professional association was to gain recognition equivalent to that of members of the accounting profession; around 1945, the latter being considered as the only true legitimate professionals in the business world.\n\nThis new corporation was dedicated to the defense of the interests of its members and to the promotion of the profession of administrator.\n\n'''From ''professional corporation'' to ''Professional Order'''''\n\nIn 1994, amendments to the [[Professional Code of Quebec]] and the measures adopted by the [[Office des professions du Qu\u00e9bec]] changed the orientation of the organization that became the ''Ordre des administrateurs agr\u00e9\u00e9s du Qu\u00e9bec'' (OAAQ).

The pioneer settlement had an economy based on the development of lumber, farming, and port industries. In 1892, [[Joseph Eloi Broussard]] opened the first commercially successful rice mill in Texas, stimulating development of rice farming in the area; he also started an irrigation company (since 1933 established as the [[Lower Neches Valley Authority]]) to support rice culture. Rice became an important commodity crop in Texas and is now cultivated in 23 counties.<ref name=\"Handbook\">{{cite web  | title = Broussard, Joseph Eloi  | work = The Handbook of Texas Online  | url = https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbrbh | accessdate = 2015-03-14 }}</ref>\n\nA big change occurred in 1901 with the [[Spindletop]] gusher, which demonstrated that a huge oil field lay underneath and adjacent to the city. With Spindletop, several energy companies developed in Beaumont, and some remain. The area rapidly developed as one of the country's major petro-chemical refining areas. Along with [[Port Arthur, Texas|Port Arthur]] and [[Orange, Texas|Orange]], Beaumont forms the [[Golden Triangle (Texas)|Golden Triangle]], a major industrial area on the Texas [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]].\n\nBeaumont is home to [[Lamar University]], a national [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education|Carnegie]] Doctoral Research university with 14,966 students, including undergraduates and postgraduates. Over the years, several corporations have been based in this city, including [[Gulf States Utilities]], which had its headquarters in Beaumont until its takeover by [[Entergy Corporation]] in 1993.

Later, other businesses were formed, especially in railroad construction and operation, new building construction, lumber sales, and communications. The Port of Beaumont became a successful regional shipping center.  Beaumont was a small center for cattle raisers and farmers in its early years. With an active riverport by the 1880s, it became an important lumber and rice-milling town. The city exported rice as a commodity crop.  Beaumont's lumber boom, which reached its peak in the late 19th century, was stimulated by the rebuilding and expansion of the railroads in the state and region after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web |author1=Robert S.

The first Jewish man in the city was from Louisiana, others migrated from the South, and were joined by immigrants. They worked as merchants and in a variety of jobs in the growing city and ranching area. In 1895 Jews formed their first congregation.<ref>[http://www.isjl.org/history/archive/tx/beaumont.html \"Beaumont, Texas\"], ''Encyclopedia of Southern Jewish Communities''</ref> By the early 20th century, the city was served by the Southern Pacific; Kansas City Southern, Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe; and Missouri Pacific railroad systems.<ref>Robert L.

Spindletop became the first major [[oil field]] and one of the largest in American history. With the discovery of oil at Spindletop, Beaumont's population more than tripled in two months from 9,000 in January 1901 to 30,000 in March 1901. Oil is, and has always been, a major export of the city, and a major contributor to the national GDP.\n\n[[Captain W. C. Tyrrell|William Casper Tyrrell]], nicknamed \"Captain W.C.\", was a leading businessman and oil tycoon in the city in the early 20th century, developing businesses during the [[Texas Oil Boom]]. An entrepreneur from Pennsylvania and Iowa, he arrived after the gusher at [[Spindletop]], and invested in development of a commercial port in the city, and an irrigation system to support the local rice industry, as well as residential and retail development of suburban property. He was also a philanthropist. He purchased and donated First Baptist Church, whose congregation had moved to a new facility, to use as the city's first public library, now known as the [[Tyrrell Historical Library]].<ref>Carolyn Davis Smith, \"Captain William Casper Tyrrell: Philanthropist Extraordinaire and the Legacy of Philanthropy in Beaumont,\" ''Texas Gulf Historical and Biographical Record'' 2002 38: 5\u201318</ref>\n\nWhen the city became a major center for defense shipbuilding during [[World War II]], tens of thousands of rural Texans migrated there for the new high-paying jobs. The Roosevelt administration ordered the defense industry to be integrated, and many Southern whites were working closely with blacks for the first time. Housing was scarce in the crowded city, and racial tensions increased. In June 1943 after workers at the Pennsylvania shipyard in Beaumont learned that a white woman had accused a black man of raping her, nearly 2,000 went to the jail where a suspect was being held, attracting more men along the way and reaching a total of 4,000.<ref>{{cite web | author = James S.

The wartime social disruption was similar to [[List of ethnic riots#War and interwar period: 1914\u20131945|war time riots]] which had occurred in other parts of the country during and following [[World War I]].\n\nDuring the war years, airmen cadets from the Royal Air Force, flying from their training base at Terrell, Texas, routinely flew to Beaumont on training flights. The community served as a stand-in for the British for Paris, France, which was the same distance from London, England as Beaumont is from Terrell.<ref>[[AT6 Monument]]</ref>\n\nIn the postwar years, Beaumont's port continued in importance. As was typical with other cities, post-war highway construction led to the development of new suburbs and dispersal of the population in search of new housing. Recently, there has been some renewal in Downtown Beaumont and in other areas of the city.\n\nIn 1996, the Jefferson County courts, located in Beaumont, became the first court in the nation to implement electronic filing and service of court documents. This eliminated the need for law firms to print and mail reams of documents.\n\nIn 2005 and 2008, Beaumont and surrounding areas suffered extensive damage from [[Hurricane Rita]] and [[Hurricane Ike]], respectively. Mandatory evacuations were issued in advance of both storms.\n\nIn August 2017, Beaumont and surrounding areas experienced severe flooding as a result of [[Hurricane Harvey]]. Due to the flooding, Memorial Hermann Baptist Hospital evacuated all of its highest level of acuity patients with the help of National Guard helicopters. In addition, many Beaumont residents had to be rescued by both boats and helicopters as a result of the floodwaters. {{as of|2019|March}}, many residents in the area are still attempting to recover from the hurricane.\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|222.3|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|214.5|km2|order=flip}} are land and {{convert|7.9|km2|order=flip}}, or 3.53%, are water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\" />\n\nBeaumont lies on Texas' coastal plain, about {{convert|30|mi|km}} inland from the [[Gulf of Mexico]], {{convert|85|mi}} east of [[Houston]], and just south of the dense pine forests of [[East Texas]]. The city is bordered on the east by the [[Neches River]] and to the north by [[Pine Island Bayou]]. Before being settled, the area was crisscrossed by numerous small streams. Most of these streams have since been filled in or converted for drainage purposes. The island directly across from Riverfront Park is called Trinity Island. There are also three other islands in the Neches River around the [[Downtown Beaumont|downtown]] area/port: Harbor, Smith and Clark. Beaumont is relatively flat compared to other Texas cites at being 16&nbsp;ft. above sea level. South of Beaumont, Port Arthur is only 7&nbsp;ft. above sea level.\n\n===Towns and communities===\nSeveral towns and communities have been absorbed into the city of Beaumont. These include: Amelia, established in 1885 and incorporated into Beaumont in 1956; Elizabeth, the depot of Amelia that was established around 1903 or after and annexed into Beaumont in 1957; Elwood, established sometimes in the late 1800s, changed to Voth in 1902, and annexed into Beaumont in 1957; Guffey, post office was established in 1901 and closed in 1925 but is part of Beaumont now; Santa Anna, became part of Beaumont when it was founded; Tevis Bluff, became part of Beaumont when it was founded in 1835.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Republic of Texas Land Grants'', \"Jefferson County Towns and Communities\"|url=https://www.co.jefferson.tx.us/historical_commission/files/History/Jefferson_County_History_2015-12-03.pdf|publisher=Texas historical Commission||page= 68|accessdate=2019-12-14}}</ref>\n   \n=== Climate ===\n{{Main|Climate of Beaumont, Texas}}\n\nThe city of Beaumont is within the [[humid subtropical]] climate regime,<ref>Thomas J.

[[Hurricane Rita]] in 2005 and [[Hurricane Ike]] in 2008 both caused significant damage. Both [[Hurricane Harvey]] in 2017 and [[Tropical Storm Imelda]] in 2019 caused historic flooding throughout the city.\n\nOn August 18, 2009, a tornado hit the west side of Beaumont, causing damage to cars and several local businesses.

With Spindletop, several energy companies developed in Beaumont, and some remain. The area rapidly developed as one of the country's major petro-chemical refining areas. Along with [[Port Arthur, Texas|Port Arthur]] and [[Orange, Texas|Orange]], Beaumont forms the [[Golden Triangle (Texas)|Golden Triangle]], a major industrial area on the Texas [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]].\n\nBeaumont is home to [[Lamar University]], a national [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education|Carnegie]] Doctoral Research university with 14,966 students, including undergraduates and postgraduates.

Later, other businesses were formed, especially in railroad construction and operation, new building construction, lumber sales, and communications. The Port of Beaumont became a successful regional shipping center.  Beaumont was a small center for cattle raisers and farmers in its early years. With an active riverport by the 1880s, it became an important lumber and rice-milling town. The city exported rice as a commodity crop.  Beaumont's lumber boom, which reached its peak in the late 19th century, was stimulated by the rebuilding and expansion of the railroads in the state and region after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web |author1=Robert S.

The first Jewish man in the city was from Louisiana, others migrated from the South, and were joined by immigrants. They worked as merchants and in a variety of jobs in the growing city and ranching area. In 1895 Jews formed their first congregation.<ref>[http://www.isjl.org/history/archive/tx/beaumont.html \"Beaumont, Texas\"], ''Encyclopedia of Southern Jewish Communities''</ref> By the early 20th century, the city was served by the Southern Pacific; Kansas City Southern, Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe; and Missouri Pacific railroad systems.<ref>Robert L.

Spindletop became the first major [[oil field]] and one of the largest in American history. With the discovery of oil at Spindletop, Beaumont's population more than tripled in two months from 9,000 in January 1901 to 30,000 in March 1901. Oil is, and has always been, a major export of the city, and a major contributor to the national GDP.\n\n[[Captain W. C. Tyrrell|William Casper Tyrrell]], nicknamed \"Captain W.C.\", was a leading businessman and oil tycoon in the city in the early 20th century, developing businesses during the [[Texas Oil Boom]]. An entrepreneur from Pennsylvania and Iowa, he arrived after the gusher at [[Spindletop]], and invested in development of a commercial port in the city, and an irrigation system to support the local rice industry, as well as residential and retail development of suburban property. He was also a philanthropist. He purchased and donated First Baptist Church, whose congregation had moved to a new facility, to use as the city's first public library, now known as the [[Tyrrell Historical Library]].<ref>Carolyn Davis Smith, \"Captain William Casper Tyrrell: Philanthropist Extraordinaire and the Legacy of Philanthropy in Beaumont,\" ''Texas Gulf Historical and Biographical Record'' 2002 38: 5\u201318</ref>\n\nWhen the city became a major center for defense shipbuilding during [[World War II]], tens of thousands of rural Texans migrated there for the new high-paying jobs. The Roosevelt administration ordered the defense industry to be integrated, and many Southern whites were working closely with blacks for the first time. Housing was scarce in the crowded city, and racial tensions increased. In June 1943 after workers at the Pennsylvania shipyard in Beaumont learned that a white woman had accused a black man of raping her, nearly 2,000 went to the jail where a suspect was being held, attracting more men along the way and reaching a total of 4,000.<ref>{{cite web | author = James S.

The wartime social disruption was similar to [[List of ethnic riots#War and interwar period: 1914\u20131945|war time riots]] which had occurred in other parts of the country during and following [[World War I]].\n\nDuring the war years, airmen cadets from the Royal Air Force, flying from their training base at Terrell, Texas, routinely flew to Beaumont on training flights. The community served as a stand-in for the British for Paris, France, which was the same distance from London, England as Beaumont is from Terrell.<ref>[[AT6 Monument]]</ref>\n\nIn the postwar years, Beaumont's port continued in importance. As was typical with other cities, post-war highway construction led to the development of new suburbs and dispersal of the population in search of new housing. Recently, there has been some renewal in Downtown Beaumont and in other areas of the city.\n\nIn 1996, the Jefferson County courts, located in Beaumont, became the first court in the nation to implement electronic filing and service of court documents. This eliminated the need for law firms to print and mail reams of documents.\n\nIn 2005 and 2008, Beaumont and surrounding areas suffered extensive damage from [[Hurricane Rita]] and [[Hurricane Ike]], respectively. Mandatory evacuations were issued in advance of both storms.\n\nIn August 2017, Beaumont and surrounding areas experienced severe flooding as a result of [[Hurricane Harvey]]. Due to the flooding, Memorial Hermann Baptist Hospital evacuated all of its highest level of acuity patients with the help of National Guard helicopters. In addition, many Beaumont residents had to be rescued by both boats and helicopters as a result of the floodwaters. {{as of|2019|March}}, many residents in the area are still attempting to recover from the hurricane.\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|222.3|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|214.5|km2|order=flip}} are land and {{convert|7.9|km2|order=flip}}, or 3.53%, are water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\" />\n\nBeaumont lies on Texas' coastal plain, about {{convert|30|mi|km}} inland from the [[Gulf of Mexico]], {{convert|85|mi}} east of [[Houston]], and just south of the dense pine forests of [[East Texas]]. The city is bordered on the east by the [[Neches River]] and to the north by [[Pine Island Bayou]]. Before being settled, the area was crisscrossed by numerous small streams. Most of these streams have since been filled in or converted for drainage purposes. The island directly across from Riverfront Park is called Trinity Island. There are also three other islands in the Neches River around the [[Downtown Beaumont|downtown]] area/port: Harbor, Smith and Clark. Beaumont is relatively flat compared to other Texas cites at being 16&nbsp;ft. above sea level. South of Beaumont, Port Arthur is only 7&nbsp;ft. above sea level.\n\n===Towns and communities===\nSeveral towns and communities have been absorbed into the city of Beaumont. These include: Amelia, established in 1885 and incorporated into Beaumont in 1956; Elizabeth, the depot of Amelia that was established around 1903 or after and annexed into Beaumont in 1957; Elwood, established sometimes in the late 1800s, changed to Voth in 1902, and annexed into Beaumont in 1957; Guffey, post office was established in 1901 and closed in 1925 but is part of Beaumont now; Santa Anna, became part of Beaumont when it was founded; Tevis Bluff, became part of Beaumont when it was founded in 1835.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Republic of Texas Land Grants'', \"Jefferson County Towns and Communities\"|url=https://www.co.jefferson.tx.us/historical_commission/files/History/Jefferson_County_History_2015-12-03.pdf|publisher=Texas historical Commission||page= 68|accessdate=2019-12-14}}</ref>\n   \n=== Climate ===\n{{Main|Climate of Beaumont, Texas}}\n\nThe city of Beaumont is within the [[humid subtropical]] climate regime,<ref>Thomas J.

The city has two distinct seasons, a [[wet season]] from April to October and a [[dry season]] from November to March. Hurricanes also pose a threat to the region. [[Hurricane Rita]] in 2005 and [[Hurricane Ike]] in 2008 both caused significant damage. Both [[Hurricane Harvey]] in 2017 and [[Tropical Storm Imelda]] in 2019 caused historic flooding throughout the city.\n\nOn August 18, 2009, a tornado hit the west side of Beaumont, causing damage to cars and several local businesses.

The title refers to the Brazilian city of [[Rio de Janeiro]],<ref name=\"Variety\" /> where the film is set. The film features the voices of [[Jesse Eisenberg]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Leslie Mann]], [[Rodrigo Santoro]], [[Jemaine Clement]], [[George Lopez]], [[Tracy Morgan]] and [[Jamie Foxx]]. It tells the story of Blu (Eisenberg), a domesticated male [[Spix's macaw]] who is taken to Rio de Janeiro to mate with a free-spirited female Spix's macaw, Jewel (Hathaway). The two eventually fall in love, and together they have to escape from being smuggled by Nigel (Clement), a [[cockatoo]]. The theme song, \"Telling the World,\" was performed by [[Taio Cruz]].\n\nSaldanha developed his first story concept of ''Rio'' in 1995, in which a penguin is washed up in Rio. Saldanha learned of the production of the films ''[[Happy Feet]]'' (2006) and ''[[Surf's Up (film)|Surf's Up]]'' (2007), and changed the concept to involve macaws and their environments in Rio. He proposed his idea to [[Chris Wedge]] in 2006, and the project was set up at [[Blue Sky Studios|Blue Sky]]. The main voice actors were approached in 2009. During production, the crew visited Rio de Janeiro and also consulted with an expert on macaws at the [[Bronx Zoo]] to study their movements.\n\n''Rio'' premiered on March 22, 2011 in [[Lagoa, Rio de Janeiro]], followed by its general release on April 15, 2011 by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film received moderately positive reviews from film critics, who praised the visuals, voice acting and music. The film was also a box office success, grossing over $143 million in the United States and $484 million worldwide. The film was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for the song \"Real in Rio\", but lost to the other nominee, \"[[Man or Muppet]]\" from ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nominees for the 84th Academy Awards |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/84/nominees.html |work=Oscars.org |accessdate=February 1, 2012 |date=January 24, 2012}}</ref> A sequel, ''[[Rio 2]]'', was released on April 11, 2014.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- NOTICE: PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES IN FILM ARTICLES SHOULD BE KEPT BETWEEN 400-700 WORDS. -->\nIn [[Brazil]], various exotic birds are smuggled out of the country. In [[Moose Lake, Minnesota]], a crate with a male [[Spix's macaw]] hatchling falls out of a truck and is found by a little girl named Linda Gunderson, who names him Blu. Over the next 15 years,<ref name=\"TeleRhap\" /> Linda comes to own a bookstore. Highly tame and unable to fly because he is scared to, Blu is ridiculed frequently by the [[Canada goose|Canada geese]] that come by outside of Linda's bookstore.\n\nOne day, [[ornithology|ornithologist]] T\u00falio Monteiro invites Blu and Linda to [[Rio de Janeiro]] because Blu, who is the last known male of his species, needs to mate with the last known female macaw. Linda initially refuses, but later accepts and they fly to Rio. At T\u00falio's [[aviary]], Blu meets Jewel, a fiercely independent [[Spix's macaw]] female longing to flee back to the wilderness. The macaws are captured by Fernando, an orphaned boy, and a [[sulphur-crested cockatoo]] named Nigel, both of whom work for a group of smugglers led by Marcel, who wants to leave the country as soon as possible to secure a black market deal regarding Blu and Jewel.\n\nWhile Fernando has second thoughts about his actions, Nigel tells the macaws that he desires to exact revenge on \"pretty birds\" after his role on a television show had been replaced by a parakeet. However, because of Blu's familiarity with cages, they flee into the jungle. Fernando meets Linda and T\u00falio and helps them find the birds, while Blu and Jewel meet Rafael, a [[toco toucan]], who offers to take them to his [[bulldog]] friend, Luiz, to remove their leg chain.\n\nHe attempts to teach Blu how to fly, before they meet up with a [[red-crested cardinal]] named Pedro and his [[yellow canary]] friend Nico. Meanwhile, Nigel coerces a horde of thieving [[marmoset]]s led by Mauro to capture Blu and Jewel. Pedro and Nico then take the macaws to a Rio-style dance party, where they dance together and begin to fall in love, but encounter the marmosets in the process. The birds fight them off while the five escape on a [[tram]].\n\nFernando takes Linda and T\u00falio to the smugglers' hideout, where they discover the birds have already been moved out. Marcel explains that he will use the [[Rio Carnival]] parade to smuggle the birds to the airport, as the other streets have been blocked off for the festivities. Meanwhile, Blu and the others meet Luiz, who releases the chain holding Blu and Jewel. After the two get into a heated argument, they decide to go their separate ways.\n\nPedro and Nico then witness Nigel capturing Jewel. When Blu and Rafael learn of it, they rush to the carnival to rescue her. Meanwhile, Linda and T\u00falio have spotted the smugglers' parade float and organize a rescue attempt for the birds. As Linda and T\u00falio pose as dancers in [[Spix's macaw]] costumes, Nigel captures Blu and the group. Linda and T\u00falio are unable to stop the smugglers in time and Marcel's group takes off in a [[Short SC.7 Skyvan]].\n\nDuring the flight, Blu breaks out his cage using a fire extinguisher and releases the other captive birds. However, Nigel attacks the macaws, injuring Jewel's wing in the process. Blu sends Nigel flying into the plane's engine using the fire extinguisher, causing the plane to fall. The smugglers flee the plane. Unable to fly, Jewel falls out of the plane's open cargo hatch towards the ocean. Jumping out of the plane to rescue her, Blu finally discovers that he is able to fly as he and Jewel kiss, and he carries her to Linda and T\u00falio for help.\n\nLater, they adopt Fernando and live in the jungle to help protect the jungle from smugglers. Blu and Jewel eventually raise three chicks named Bia, Carla, and Tiago together, and celebrate with Rafael, Nico, Pedro, Linda, Luiz, and T\u00falio. Meanwhile, Nigel survives the plane crash but is ridiculed for his loss of feathers by Mauro, and the smugglers are sent to prison.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as Tyler Blu Gunderson, AKA: Blu, a male [[Spix's macaw]]<ref>{{cite news |title=The Real \"Rio\": True Story of a Spix's Macaw |url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/02/15/1065030/-The-Real-Rio-True-Story-of-a-Spix-s-Macaw |accessdate=May 20, 2012 |newspaper=Daily Kos |date=February 15, 2012}}</ref> who was born in Rio de Janeiro but raised in [[Moose Lake, Minnesota]], after he was smuggled.\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Jewel, a female Spix's macaw from The Amazon Jungle, but was taken into Rio de Janeiro.\n* [[George Lopez]] as Rafael, a romantic [[toco toucan]] fond of Carnival.\n* [[Jamie Foxx]] as Nico, a [[yellow canary]] who loves to [[samba]], and whose bottlecap hat functions as a tambourine.\n* [[Will.i.am]] as Pedro, a [[red-crested cardinal]] who is Nico's best friend.\n* [[Tracy Morgan]] as Luiz, a [[bulldog]] who is Rafael's friend and a [[chainsaw]] expert who has a medical condition of drooling.\n* [[Jemaine Clement]] as Nigel, a sadistic [[sulphur-crested cockatoo]] who used to be a TV star, but was replaced by a Parakeet, causing him to have a  strong hatred for \"pretty birds.\"\n* [[Leslie Mann]] as Linda Gunderson, a girl who discovered Blu after he was taken from Rio de Janeiro to Moose Lake and adopted him for 15 years.\n* [[Rodrigo Santoro]] as Dr. T\u00falio Monteiro, a Brazilian ornithologist.

The title refers to the Brazilian city of [[Rio de Janeiro]],<ref name=\"Variety\" /> where the film is set. The film features the voices of [[Jesse Eisenberg]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Leslie Mann]], [[Rodrigo Santoro]], [[Jemaine Clement]], [[George Lopez]], [[Tracy Morgan]] and [[Jamie Foxx]]. It tells the story of Blu (Eisenberg), a domesticated male [[Spix's macaw]] who is taken to Rio de Janeiro to mate with a free-spirited female Spix's macaw, Jewel (Hathaway). The two eventually fall in love, and together they have to escape from being smuggled by Nigel (Clement), a [[cockatoo]]. The theme song, \"Telling the World,\" was performed by [[Taio Cruz]].\n\nSaldanha developed his first story concept of ''Rio'' in 1995, in which a penguin is washed up in Rio. Saldanha learned of the production of the films ''[[Happy Feet]]'' (2006) and ''[[Surf's Up (film)|Surf's Up]]'' (2007), and changed the concept to involve macaws and their environments in Rio. He proposed his idea to [[Chris Wedge]] in 2006, and the project was set up at [[Blue Sky Studios|Blue Sky]]. The main voice actors were approached in 2009. During production, the crew visited Rio de Janeiro and also consulted with an expert on macaws at the [[Bronx Zoo]] to study their movements.\n\n''Rio'' premiered on March 22, 2011 in [[Lagoa, Rio de Janeiro]], followed by its general release on April 15, 2011 by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film received moderately positive reviews from film critics, who praised the visuals, voice acting and music. The film was also a box office success, grossing over $143 million in the United States and $484 million worldwide. The film was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for the song \"Real in Rio\", but lost to the other nominee, \"[[Man or Muppet]]\" from ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nominees for the 84th Academy Awards |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/84/nominees.html |work=Oscars.org |accessdate=February 1, 2012 |date=January 24, 2012}}</ref> A sequel, ''[[Rio 2]]'', was released on April 11, 2014.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- NOTICE: PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES IN FILM ARTICLES SHOULD BE KEPT BETWEEN 400-700 WORDS. -->\nIn [[Brazil]], various exotic birds are smuggled out of the country. In [[Moose Lake, Minnesota]], a crate with a male [[Spix's macaw]] hatchling falls out of a truck and is found by a little girl named Linda Gunderson, who names him Blu. Over the next 15 years,<ref name=\"TeleRhap\" /> Linda comes to own a bookstore. Highly tame and unable to fly because he is scared to, Blu is ridiculed frequently by the [[Canada goose|Canada geese]] that come by outside of Linda's bookstore.\n\nOne day, [[ornithology|ornithologist]] T\u00falio Monteiro invites Blu and Linda to [[Rio de Janeiro]] because Blu, who is the last known male of his species, needs to mate with the last known female macaw. Linda initially refuses, but later accepts and they fly to Rio. At T\u00falio's [[aviary]], Blu meets Jewel, a fiercely independent [[Spix's macaw]] female longing to flee back to the wilderness. The macaws are captured by Fernando, an orphaned boy, and a [[sulphur-crested cockatoo]] named Nigel, both of whom work for a group of smugglers led by Marcel, who wants to leave the country as soon as possible to secure a black market deal regarding Blu and Jewel.\n\nWhile Fernando has second thoughts about his actions, Nigel tells the macaws that he desires to exact revenge on \"pretty birds\" after his role on a television show had been replaced by a parakeet. However, because of Blu's familiarity with cages, they flee into the jungle. Fernando meets Linda and T\u00falio and helps them find the birds, while Blu and Jewel meet Rafael, a [[toco toucan]], who offers to take them to his [[bulldog]] friend, Luiz, to remove their leg chain.\n\nHe attempts to teach Blu how to fly, before they meet up with a [[red-crested cardinal]] named Pedro and his [[yellow canary]] friend Nico. Meanwhile, Nigel coerces a horde of thieving [[marmoset]]s led by Mauro to capture Blu and Jewel. Pedro and Nico then take the macaws to a Rio-style dance party, where they dance together and begin to fall in love, but encounter the marmosets in the process. The birds fight them off while the five escape on a [[tram]].\n\nFernando takes Linda and T\u00falio to the smugglers' hideout, where they discover the birds have already been moved out. Marcel explains that he will use the [[Rio Carnival]] parade to smuggle the birds to the airport, as the other streets have been blocked off for the festivities. Meanwhile, Blu and the others meet Luiz, who releases the chain holding Blu and Jewel. After the two get into a heated argument, they decide to go their separate ways.\n\nPedro and Nico then witness Nigel capturing Jewel. When Blu and Rafael learn of it, they rush to the carnival to rescue her. Meanwhile, Linda and T\u00falio have spotted the smugglers' parade float and organize a rescue attempt for the birds. As Linda and T\u00falio pose as dancers in [[Spix's macaw]] costumes, Nigel captures Blu and the group. Linda and T\u00falio are unable to stop the smugglers in time and Marcel's group takes off in a [[Short SC.7 Skyvan]].\n\nDuring the flight, Blu breaks out his cage using a fire extinguisher and releases the other captive birds. However, Nigel attacks the macaws, injuring Jewel's wing in the process. Blu sends Nigel flying into the plane's engine using the fire extinguisher, causing the plane to fall. The smugglers flee the plane. Unable to fly, Jewel falls out of the plane's open cargo hatch towards the ocean. Jumping out of the plane to rescue her, Blu finally discovers that he is able to fly as he and Jewel kiss, and he carries her to Linda and T\u00falio for help.\n\nLater, they adopt Fernando and live in the jungle to help protect the jungle from smugglers. Blu and Jewel eventually raise three chicks named Bia, Carla, and Tiago together, and celebrate with Rafael, Nico, Pedro, Linda, Luiz, and T\u00falio. Meanwhile, Nigel survives the plane crash but is ridiculed for his loss of feathers by Mauro, and the smugglers are sent to prison.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Jesse Eisenberg]] as Tyler Blu Gunderson, AKA: Blu, a male [[Spix's macaw]]<ref>{{cite news |title=The Real \"Rio\": True Story of a Spix's Macaw |url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/02/15/1065030/-The-Real-Rio-True-Story-of-a-Spix-s-Macaw |accessdate=May 20, 2012 |newspaper=Daily Kos |date=February 15, 2012}}</ref> who was born in Rio de Janeiro but raised in [[Moose Lake, Minnesota]], after he was smuggled.\n* [[Anne Hathaway]] as Jewel, a female Spix's macaw from The Amazon Jungle, but was taken into Rio de Janeiro.\n* [[Will.i.am]] as Pedro, a [[red-crested cardinal]] who is Nico's best friend.\n* [[Jamie Foxx]] as Nico, a [[yellow canary]] who loves to [[samba]], and whose bottlecap hat functions as a tambourine.\n* [[George Lopez]] as Rafael, a romantic [[toco toucan]] fond of Carnival.\n* [[Tracy Morgan]] as Luiz, a [[bulldog]] who is Rafael's friend and a [[chainsaw]] expert who has a medical condition of drooling.\n* [[Jemaine Clement]] as Nigel, a sadistic [[sulphur-crested cockatoo]] who used to be a TV star, but was replaced by a Parakeet, causing him to have a  strong hatred for \"pretty birds.\"\n* [[Rodrigo Santoro]] as Dr. T\u00falio Monteiro, a Brazilian ornithologist.
