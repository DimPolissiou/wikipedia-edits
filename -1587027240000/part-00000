An exception to this inbound travel lockdown would be granted to Aruba residents. A travel advisory would also be instituted for residents, advising against outbound travel at this time.

In a mobile computing system, the network availability is expected to be maintained at a high level with the minimal amount of lag/downtime without being affected by the mobility of the connected nodes.\n*Interactivity: The nodes belonging to a mobile computing system are connected with one another to communicate and collaborate through active transactions of data.\n*Individuality: A portable device or a mobile node connected to a mobile network often denote an individual; a mobile computing system should be able to adopt the technology to cater the individual needs and also to obtain contextual information of each node.\n\n==Devices==\nSome of the most common forms of mobile computing devices are as given below:\n\n* Portable computers, compact, lightweight units including a full character set keyboard and primarily intended as [[computer terminal|host]]s for software that may be parameterized, such as [[laptop]]s/[[desktop computer|desktops]], [[smartphones]]/[[tablet computer|tablets]], etc.\n\n* [[Smart card]]s that can run multiple applications but are typically used for payment, travel and secure area access.\n\n* [[Mobile phone]]s, telephony devices which can [[telephone call|call]] from a distance through cellular networking technology.\n\n* [[Wearable computer]]s, mostly limited to functional keys and primarily intended as incorporation of [[software agent]]s, such as bracelets, key-less implants, etc.\n\n[[File:Apple Watch-.jpg|thumb|330x330px|The wearable computer, [[Apple Watch]], released in 2015]]\n\nThese classes are expected to endure and to complement each other, none replacing another completely.\n\nOther types of mobile computers have been introduced since the 1990s, including the:\n* [[Portable computer]] (discontinued)\n* [[Personal digital assistant]]/[[Enterprise digital assistant]] (discontinued)\n* [[Ultra-Mobile PC]] (discontinued)\n* [[Laptop]]\n* [[Smartphone]] and [[tablet computer]]\n* [[Wearable computer]]\n* [[E-reader]]\n* [[Carputer]]\n\n==Limitations==\n* Expandability and [[Find and replace|Replace]]ability: In contrast to the common traditional [[motherboard]]-based PC the [[System on a chip|SoC]] architecture in which they are embedded makes impossible these features.\n* Lack of a [[BIOS]]: As most smart devices lack a proper [[BIOS]], their [[bootloading]] capabilities are limited as they can only boot into the single [[operative system]] with which it came, in contrast with the PC BIOS model.\n* Range and bandwidth: Mobile Internet access is generally slower than direct cable connections, using technologies such as [[GPRS]] and [[EDGE]], and more recently [[HSDPA]], [[HSUPA]], [[3G]] and [[4G]] networks and also the proposed [[5G]] network. These networks are usually available within range of commercial cell phone towers. High speed network wireless LANs are inexpensive but have very limited range.\n* Security standards: When working mobile, one is dependent on public networks, requiring careful use of [[virtual private network|VPN]]. Security is a major concern while concerning the mobile computing standards on the fleet. One can easily attack the VPN through a huge number of networks interconnected through the line.\n* Power consumption: When a power outlet or portable generator is not available, mobile computers must rely entirely on battery power. Combined with the compact size of many mobile devices, this often means unusually expensive batteries must be used to obtain the necessary battery life.\n* Transmission interferences: Weather, terrain, and the range from the nearest signal point can all interfere with signal reception. Reception in tunnels, some buildings, and rural areas is often poor.\n* Potential health hazards: People who use mobile devices while driving are often distracted from driving and are thus assumed more likely to be involved in traffic accidents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.distraction.gov/stats-and-facts/|title=U Drive.

Questions concerning [[mobile phone radiation and health]] have been raised. \n* Human interface with device: Screens and keyboards tend to be small, which may make them hard to use. Alternate input methods such as speech or [[handwriting recognition]] require training.\n\n==In-vehicle computing and fleet computing==\n[[File:MOBIDIC cutaway.jpg|left|thumb|[[MOBIDIC]] mobile computer of 1959]]\nMany commercial and government field forces deploy a rugged portable computer with their fleet of vehicles. This requires the units to be anchored to the vehicle for driver safety, device security, and [[ergonomics]]. [[Rugged computer]]s are rated for severe vibration associated with large service vehicles and off-road driving and the harsh environmental conditions of constant professional use such as in [[emergency medical services]], fire, and public safety.\n\n[[Image:Compaq portable.jpg|thumb|The [[Compaq Portable]] - circa 1982 pre-[[laptop]]]]\n\nOther elements affecting function in vehicle:\n* [[Operating temperature]]: A vehicle cabin can often experience temperature swings from {{convert|-30|-|60|C|abbr=on}}. Computers typically must be able to withstand these temperatures while operating. Typical fan-based cooling has stated limits of {{convert|35|-|38|C|abbr=on}} of ambient temperature, and temperatures below freezing require localized heaters to bring components up to operating temperature (based on independent studies by the SRI Group and by Panasonic R&D).\n* Vibration can decrease the life expectancy of computer components, notably rotational storage such as [[Hard disk drive|HDDs]].\n* Visibility of standard screens becomes an issue in bright sunlight.\n* Touchscreen users easily interact with the units in the field without removing gloves.\n* High-temperature battery settings: Lithium ion batteries are sensitive to high temperature conditions for charging. A computer designed for the mobile environment should be designed with a high-temperature charging function that limits the charge to 85% or less of capacity.\n* External antenna connections go through the typical metal cabins of vehicles which would block wireless reception, and take advantage of much more capable external communication and navigation equipment.\n\n==Security issues involved in mobile==\n{{main article|Mobile security}}\n[[Mobile security]] has become increasingly important in mobile computing. It is of particular concern as it relates to the [[information security|security]] of personal information now stored on the [[smartphone]]. Mobile applications might copy user data from these devices to a remote server without the users\u2019 permission and often without the users\u2019 consent.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-05/apple-iphones-could-have-been-hacked-for-years-%E2%80%93-heres-what-to/11481206 |title=Apple iPhones could have been hacked for years \u2014 here's what to do about it |last=Sikos |first=Leslie F. |last2=Haskell-Dowland |first2=Paul|date=5 Sep 2019 | publisher=ABC News}}</ref> The user profiles automatically created in the cloud for smartphone users raise [[privacy]] concerns on all major platforms, in terms of, including, but not limited to, location tracking<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/google-sued-over-keeping-location-data-amid-privacy-concerns/ | title=Google sued over tracking user location amid privacy concerns | first=Laura | last=Hautala | date=20 August 2018 | publisher=CNET}}</ref> and personal data collection,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cpomagazine.com/data-privacy/pre-installed-apps-on-android-represent-a-threat-to-user-privacy-and-security/ | title=Pre-Installed Apps on Android Represent a Threat to User Privacy and Security | first =Nicole | last=Lindsey | publisher=CPO Magazine | date=10 April 2019 }}</ref> regardless of user settings on the device.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/13/google-location-tracking-android-iphone-mobile | title=Google records your location even when you tell it not to | publisher=The Guardian | date=14 August 2018 }}</ref>\n\nMore and more users and businesses use smartphones as a means of planning and organizing their work and private life. Within companies, these technologies are causing profound changes in the organization of [[information systems]] and therefore they have become the source of new risks. Indeed, smartphones collect and compile an increasing amount of sensitive information to which access must be controlled to protect the [[information privacy|privacy]] of the user and the [[intellectual property]] of the company.\n\nAll smartphones are preferred targets of attacks. These attacks exploit weaknesses related to smartphones that can come from means of wireless telecommunication like [[WiFi|WiFi networks]] and [[GSM]]. There are also attacks that exploit software vulnerabilities from both the web browser and operating system. Finally, there are forms of [[malware|malicious software]] that rely on the weak knowledge of average users.\n\nDifferent security counter-measures are being developed and applied to smartphones, from security in different layers of software to the dissemination of information to end users. There are good practices to be observed at all levels, from design to use, through the development of [[operating system]]s, software layers, and downloadable apps.\n\n==Portable computing devices==\n{{main article|Mobile device|Portable computer}}\nSeveral categories of portable computing devices can run on batteries but are not usually classified as laptops: portable computers, [[PDA]]s, ultra mobile PCs (UMPCs), tablets and smartphones.\n\n* A [[portable computer]] (discontinued) is a general-purpose computer that can be easily moved from place to place, but cannot be used while in transit, usually because it requires some \"setting-up\" and an AC power source. The most famous example is the [[Osborne 1]]. Portable computers are also called a \"transportable\" or a \"luggable\" PC.\n* A [[personal digital assistant]] (PDA) (discontinued) is a small, usually pocket-sized, computer with limited functionality. It is intended to supplement and to synchronize with a desktop computer, giving access to contacts, address book, notes, e-mail and other features.[[Image:PalmTX.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Palm TX]] PDA]]\n* An [[ultra mobile PC]] (discontinued) is a full-featured, PDA-sized computer running a general-purpose operating system.\n* [[tablet computer|Tablets]]/[[smartphone|phones]]: a slate tablet is shaped like a paper notebook. Smartphones are the same devices as tablets, however the only difference with smartphones is that they are much smaller and pocketable. Instead of a physical keyboard, these devices have a [[touchscreen]] including a combination of a [[virtual keyboard]], but can also link to a physical keyboard via wireless [[Bluetooth]] or USB. These devices include features other computer systems would not be able to incorporate, such as built-in cameras, because of their portability - although some laptops possess camera integration, and desktops and laptops can connect to a [[webcam]] by way of USB.\n* A [[carputer]] is installed in an automobile. It operates as a wireless computer, sound system, GPS, and DVD player. It also contains word processing software and is bluetooth compatible.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/tag/carputer/|title=Carputer Articles on Engadget|publisher=AOL|work=Engadget|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref>\n* A Pentop (discontinued) is a computing device the size and shape of a pen. It functions as a writing utensil, MP3 player, language translator, digital storage device, and calculator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geardiary.com/2007/10/07/the-fly-fusion-pentop-computer-review/|title=Gear Diary \u00bb The FLY Fusion Pentop Computer Review|date=7 October 2007|publisher=|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref>\n* An application-specific computer is one that is tailored to a particular application. For example, [[Ferranti]] introduced a handheld application-specific mobile computer (the [[Ferranti MRT|MRT-100]]) in the form of a [[clipboard]] for conducting [[opinion polls]].<ref>G Rowley, K Barker and V Callaghan \u201c''The Questronic Project and the Ferranti MRT 100 A Boon For Survey Research''\u201d, The Professional Geographer, Volume 37, Issue 4, pages 459\u2013463, November 1985</ref>\n\nBoundaries that separate these categories are blurry at times. For example, the [[OQO]] UMPC is also a PDA-sized tablet PC; the [[EMate 300|Apple eMate]] had the clamshell form factor of a laptop, but ran PDA software. The [[HP Omnibook]] line of laptops included some devices small more enough to be called ultra mobile PCs. The hardware of the [[Nokia 770]] internet tablet is essentially the same as that of a PDA such as the [[Sharp Zaurus|Zaurus]] 6000; the only reason it's not called a PDA is that it does not have [[Personal information manager|PIM]] software. On the other hand, both the 770 and the Zaurus can run some desktop Linux software, usually with modifications.\n\n==Mobile data communication==\n[[Wireless]] data connections used in mobile computing take three general forms so.<ref name=\"Ositech\">[http://www.ositech.com/downloads/123dwnlod_1.html \"Wireless Data Communications for Beginners\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713084232/http://www.ositech.com/downloads/123dwnlod_1.html |date=2011-07-13 }}, ''Ositech''<!--accessed July 12, 2011--></ref> [[Cellular network|Cellular]] data service uses technologies [[GSM]], [[Code division multiple access|CDMA]] or [[General Packet Radio Service|GPRS]], [[3G]] networks such as [[W-CDMA]], [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]] or [[CDMA2000]].<ref>Lachu Aravamudhan, Stefano Faccin, Risto Mononen, Basavaraj Patil, Yousuf Saifullah, Sarvesh Sharma, Srinivas Sreemanthula.

In a mobile computing system, the network availability is expected to be maintained at a high level with the minimal amount of lag/downtime without being affected by the mobility of the connected nodes.\n*Interactivity: The nodes belonging to a mobile computing system are connected with one another to communicate and collaborate through active transactions of data.\n*Individuality: A portable device or a mobile node connected to a mobile network often denote an individual; a mobile computing system should be able to adopt the technology to cater the individual needs and also to obtain contextual information of each node.\n\n==Devices==\nSome of the most common forms of mobile computing devices are as given below:\n\n* Portable computers, compact, lightweight units including a full character set keyboard and primarily intended as [[computer terminal|host]]s for software that may be parameterized, such as [[laptop]]s/[[desktop computer|desktops]], [[smartphones]]/[[tablet computer|tablets]], etc.\n\n* [[Smart card]]s that can run multiple applications but are typically used for payment, travel and secure area access.\n\n* [[Mobile phone]]s, telephony devices which can [[telephone call|call]] from a distance through cellular networking technology.\n\n* [[Wearable computer]]s, mostly limited to functional keys and primarily intended as incorporation of [[software agent]]s, such as bracelets, key-less implants, etc.\n\n[[File:Apple Watch-.jpg|thumb|330x330px|The wearable computer, [[Apple Watch]], released in 2015]]\n\nThese classes are expected to endure and to complement each other, none replacing another completely.\n\nOther types of mobile computers have been introduced since the 1990s, including the:\n* [[Portable computer]] (discontinued)\n* [[Personal digital assistant]]/[[Enterprise digital assistant]] (discontinued)\n* [[Ultra-Mobile PC]] (discontinued)\n* [[Laptop]]\n* [[Smartphone]] and [[tablet computer]]\n* [[Wearable computer]]\n* [[E-reader]]\n* [[Carputer]]\n\n==Limitations==\n* Expandability and [[Find and replace|Replace]]ability: In contrast to the common traditional [[motherboard]]-based PC the [[System on a chip|SoC]] architecture in which they are embedded makes impossible these features.\n* Lack of a [[BIOS]]: As most smart devices lack a proper [[BIOS]], their [[bootloading]] capabilities are limited as they can only boot into the single [[operative system]] with which it came, in contrast with the PC BIOS model.\n* Range and bandwidth: Mobile Internet access is generally slower than direct cable connections, using technologies such as [[GPRS]] and [[EDGE]], and more recently [[HSDPA]], [[HSUPA]], [[3G]] and [[4G]] networks and also the proposed [[5G]] network. These networks are usually available within range of commercial cell phone towers. High speed network wireless LANs are inexpensive but have very limited range.\n* Security standards: When working mobile, one is dependent on public networks, requiring careful use of [[virtual private network|VPN]]. Security is a major concern while concerning the mobile computing standards on the fleet. One can easily attack the VPN through a huge number of networks interconnected through the line.\n* Power consumption: When a power outlet or portable generator is not available, mobile computers must rely entirely on battery power. Combined with the compact size of many mobile devices, this often means unusually expensive batteries must be used to obtain the necessary battery life.\n* Transmission interferences: Weather, terrain, and the range from the nearest signal point can all interfere with signal reception. Reception in tunnels, some buildings, and rural areas is often poor.\n* Potential health hazards: People who use mobile devices while driving are often distracted from driving and are thus assumed more likely to be involved in traffic accidents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.distraction.gov/stats-and-facts/|title=U Drive. U Text. U Pay.|last=andrew.currin.ctr@dot.gov|date=8 September 2016|website=NHTSA|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref> (While this may seem obvious, there is considerable discussion about whether banning mobile device use while driving reduces accidents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://handsfreeinfo.com/study-handheld-cell-bans-have-no-effect|title=Hands Free Cell Phones No Safer, Insurance Study Claims|publisher=|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30686_3-10444717-266.html|title=Study: Distractions, not phones, cause car crashes|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref>) Cell phones may interfere with sensitive medical devices. Questions concerning [[mobile phone radiation and health]] have been raised. \n* Human interface with device: Screens and keyboards tend to be small, which may make them hard to use. Alternate input methods such as speech or [[handwriting recognition]] require training.\n\n==In-vehicle computing and fleet computing==\n[[File:MOBIDIC cutaway.jpg|left|thumb|[[MOBIDIC]] mobile computer of 1959]]\nMany commercial and government field forces deploy a rugged portable computer with their fleet of vehicles. This requires the units to be anchored to the vehicle for driver safety, device security, and [[ergonomics]]. [[Rugged computer]]s are rated for severe vibration associated with large service vehicles and off-road driving and the harsh environmental conditions of constant professional use such as in [[emergency medical services]], fire, and public safety.\n\n[[Image:Compaq portable.jpg|thumb|The [[Compaq Portable]] - circa 1982 pre-[[laptop]]]]\n\nOther elements affecting function in vehicle:\n* [[Operating temperature]]: A vehicle cabin can often experience temperature swings from {{convert|-30|-|60|C|abbr=on}}. Computers typically must be able to withstand these temperatures while operating. Typical fan-based cooling has stated limits of {{convert|35|-|38|C|abbr=on}} of ambient temperature, and temperatures below freezing require localized heaters to bring components up to operating temperature (based on independent studies by the SRI Group and by Panasonic R&D).\n* Vibration can decrease the life expectancy of computer components, notably rotational storage such as [[Hard disk drive|HDDs]].\n* Visibility of standard screens becomes an issue in bright sunlight.\n* Touchscreen users easily interact with the units in the field without removing gloves.\n* High-temperature battery settings: Lithium ion batteries are sensitive to high temperature conditions for charging. A computer designed for the mobile environment should be designed with a high-temperature charging function that limits the charge to 85% or less of capacity.\n* External antenna connections go through the typical metal cabins of vehicles which would block wireless reception, and take advantage of much more capable external communication and navigation equipment.\n\n==Security issues involved in mobile==\n{{main article|Mobile security}}\n[[Mobile security]] has become increasingly important in mobile computing. It is of particular concern as it relates to the [[information security|security]] of personal information now stored on the [[smartphone]]. Mobile applications might copy user data from these devices to a remote server without the users\u2019 permission and often without the users\u2019 consent.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-05/apple-iphones-could-have-been-hacked-for-years-%E2%80%93-heres-what-to/11481206 |title=Apple iPhones could have been hacked for years \u2014 here's what to do about it |last=Sikos |first=Leslie F. |last2=Haskell-Dowland |first2=Paul|date=5 Sep 2019 | publisher=ABC News}}</ref> The user profiles automatically created in the cloud for smartphone users raise [[privacy]] concerns on all major platforms, in terms of, including, but not limited to, location tracking<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/google-sued-over-keeping-location-data-amid-privacy-concerns/ | title=Google sued over tracking user location amid privacy concerns | first=Laura | last=Hautala | date=20 August 2018 | publisher=CNET}}</ref> and personal data collection,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cpomagazine.com/data-privacy/pre-installed-apps-on-android-represent-a-threat-to-user-privacy-and-security/ | title=Pre-Installed Apps on Android Represent a Threat to User Privacy and Security | first =Nicole | last=Lindsey | publisher=CPO Magazine | date=10 April 2019 }}</ref> regardless of user settings on the device.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/13/google-location-tracking-android-iphone-mobile | title=Google records your location even when you tell it not to | publisher=The Guardian | date=14 August 2018 }}</ref>\n\nMore and more users and businesses use smartphones as a means of planning and organizing their work and private life. Within companies, these technologies are causing profound changes in the organization of [[information systems]] and therefore they have become the source of new risks. Indeed, smartphones collect and compile an increasing amount of sensitive information to which access must be controlled to protect the [[information privacy|privacy]] of the user and the [[intellectual property]] of the company.\n\nAll smartphones are preferred targets of attacks. These attacks exploit weaknesses related to smartphones that can come from means of wireless telecommunication like [[WiFi|WiFi networks]] and [[GSM]]. There are also attacks that exploit software vulnerabilities from both the web browser and operating system. Finally, there are forms of [[malware|malicious software]] that rely on the weak knowledge of average users.\n\nDifferent security counter-measures are being developed and applied to smartphones, from security in different layers of software to the dissemination of information to end users. There are good practices to be observed at all levels, from design to use, through the development of [[operating system]]s, software layers, and downloadable apps.\n\n==Portable computing devices==\n{{main article|Mobile device|Portable computer}}\nSeveral categories of portable computing devices can run on batteries but are not usually classified as laptops: portable computers, [[PDA]]s, ultra mobile PCs (UMPCs), tablets and smartphones.\n\n* A [[portable computer]] (discontinued) is a general-purpose computer that can be easily moved from place to place, but cannot be used while in transit, usually because it requires some \"setting-up\" and an AC power source. The most famous example is the [[Osborne 1]]. Portable computers are also called a \"transportable\" or a \"luggable\" PC.\n* A [[personal digital assistant]] (PDA) (discontinued) is a small, usually pocket-sized, computer with limited functionality. It is intended to supplement and to synchronize with a desktop computer, giving access to contacts, address book, notes, e-mail and other features.[[Image:PalmTX.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Palm TX]] PDA]]\n* An [[ultra mobile PC]] (discontinued) is a full-featured, PDA-sized computer running a general-purpose operating system.\n* [[tablet computer|Tablets]]/[[smartphone|phones]]: a slate tablet is shaped like a paper notebook. Smartphones are the same devices as tablets, however the only difference with smartphones is that they are much smaller and pocketable. Instead of a physical keyboard, these devices have a [[touchscreen]] including a combination of a [[virtual keyboard]], but can also link to a physical keyboard via wireless [[Bluetooth]] or USB. These devices include features other computer systems would not be able to incorporate, such as built-in cameras, because of their portability - although some laptops possess camera integration, and desktops and laptops can connect to a [[webcam]] by way of USB.\n* A [[carputer]] is installed in an automobile. It operates as a wireless computer, sound system, GPS, and DVD player. It also contains word processing software and is bluetooth compatible.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/tag/carputer/|title=Carputer Articles on Engadget|publisher=AOL|work=Engadget|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref>\n* A Pentop (discontinued) is a computing device the size and shape of a pen. It functions as a writing utensil, MP3 player, language translator, digital storage device, and calculator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geardiary.com/2007/10/07/the-fly-fusion-pentop-computer-review/|title=Gear Diary \u00bb The FLY Fusion Pentop Computer Review|date=7 October 2007|publisher=|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref>\n* An application-specific computer is one that is tailored to a particular application. For example, [[Ferranti]] introduced a handheld application-specific mobile computer (the [[Ferranti MRT|MRT-100]]) in the form of a [[clipboard]] for conducting [[opinion polls]].<ref>G Rowley, K Barker and V Callaghan \u201c''The Questronic Project and the Ferranti MRT 100 A Boon For Survey Research''\u201d, The Professional Geographer, Volume 37, Issue 4, pages 459\u2013463, November 1985</ref>\n\nBoundaries that separate these categories are blurry at times. For example, the [[OQO]] UMPC is also a PDA-sized tablet PC; the [[EMate 300|Apple eMate]] had the clamshell form factor of a laptop, but ran PDA software. The [[HP Omnibook]] line of laptops included some devices small more enough to be called ultra mobile PCs. The hardware of the [[Nokia 770]] internet tablet is essentially the same as that of a PDA such as the [[Sharp Zaurus|Zaurus]] 6000; the only reason it's not called a PDA is that it does not have [[Personal information manager|PIM]] software. On the other hand, both the 770 and the Zaurus can run some desktop Linux software, usually with modifications.\n\n==Mobile data communication==\n[[Wireless]] data connections used in mobile computing take three general forms so.<ref name=\"Ositech\">[http://www.ositech.com/downloads/123dwnlod_1.html \"Wireless Data Communications for Beginners\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713084232/http://www.ositech.com/downloads/123dwnlod_1.html |date=2011-07-13 }}, ''Ositech''<!--accessed July 12, 2011--></ref> [[Cellular network|Cellular]] data service uses technologies [[GSM]], [[Code division multiple access|CDMA]] or [[General Packet Radio Service|GPRS]], [[3G]] networks such as [[W-CDMA]], [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]] or [[CDMA2000]].<ref>Lachu Aravamudhan, Stefano Faccin, Risto Mononen, Basavaraj Patil, Yousuf Saifullah, Sarvesh Sharma, Srinivas Sreemanthula.

Kennedy played as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for Arsenal, and then played as a left-sided [[midfielder]] for Liverpool. He scored 148 goals in 581 league and cup appearances in a 15-year career in the [[English Football League]] and also won 17 caps for [[England national football team|England]] between 1976 and 1980, scoring three international goals.\n\nKennedy turned professional for Arsenal in November 1968. He made his first team debut ten months later, and went on to win the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] in 1970, the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] and [[FA Cup]] Double in 1970\u201371, and then play on the losing side in the [[1972 FA Cup Final]]. His form then declined, and he was sold to Liverpool for a club record \u00a3200,000 fee in July 1974, at the same time that [[Bill Shankly]] resigned as manager. He initially struggled at the club, but after manager [[Bob Paisley]] converted him to a left-sided midfielder he went on to help Liverpool to become the dominant club of English football from 1975 to 1982. During his time at the club Liverpool won the First Division five times (1975\u201376, 1976\u201377, 1978\u201379, 1979\u201380, and 1981\u201382), the [[FA Community Shield|FA Charity Shield]] four times (1976, 1977, 1979 and 1980), the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] three times, (1977, 1978, and 1981), and the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] (1976), [[UEFA Super Cup]] (1977), and [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] (1981). He also picked up runners-up medals in the FA Cup (1977), UEFA Super Cup (1978), League Cup (1981), and [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|World Club Championship]] (1981) and won the ''[[Match of the Day]]'''s [[BBC Goal of the Season|Goal of the Season]] award in 1977\u201378.\n\nHe was a strong player with an excellent first touch, intelligence, and all round ability. This allowed him to transition from a forward to a midfielder during his time at Liverpool. Despite his trophy successes with Arsenal and Liverpool, after winning six caps for the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-23]] side he was unable to translate his club form into a good international career, and was used as a stand-in for [[Trevor Brooking]] before he retired from international football in frustration in March 1981. His only international tournament appearance was at [[UEFA Euro 1980|Euro 1980]]. Bob Paisley described him as \"one of Liverpool's greatest players and probably the most underrated\".\n\nKennedy joined [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] for a \u00a3160,000 fee in January 1982 and added a [[Welsh Cup]] winners medal to his collection four months later. However the effects of [[Parkinson's disease]] began to reduce his effectiveness on the pitch, and he dropped into the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] with [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]] in November 1983. During the 1984\u201385 season he spent a brief time as player-manager of [[Cyprus]] club [[Pezoporikos Larnaca FC|Pezoporikos]] and later played for [[Northern Football League|Northern League]] club [[Ashington A.F.C.|Ashington]]. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in November 1984. His life after football was tough, as he had to deal with the effects of Parkinson's, the loss of his business, and the breakdown of his 15-year marriage. He remained reliant on charity to fund his medical expenses, and was forced to sell his medal collection and caps in 1993.\n\n==Club career==\nRay Kennedy was born on 28 July 1951 in [[Seaton Delaval]], a former [[pit village]] in [[Northumberland]], to Martin and Veronica Kennedy, a coal miner and housewife respectively.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=10}}</ref> He was the eldest of four children: Trevor, Michael, and Janet.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=26}}</ref> He was spotted playing schoolboy football by a scout at [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]], and began training at [[Vale Park]] after manager [[Stanley Matthews]] came to the Kennedy home to persuade him to sign schoolboy forms at the club.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=33}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Kennedy File|url=http://www.lfchistory.net/images/newspapers/magazines/various/raykennedy-diary.jpg|website=lfchistory.net|accessdate=30 May 2016}}</ref> However at the age of sixteen Matthews felt Kennedy was \"too slow to be a footballer\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Sherwin|first=Phil|title=The Port Vale Miscellany|publisher=The History Press|location=Brimscombe Port|year=2010|pages=16|isbn=978-0-7524-5777-2}}</ref> Kennedy was considered to be too big and clumsy to be a professional, and groundskeeper Dennis Dawson claimed that he was the only man at the club to see any potential in the youngster.<ref name=\"Tale\">{{cite book|last=Kent|first=Jeff|title=Port Vale Tales: A Collection Of Stories, Anecdotes And Memories|publisher=Witan Books|date=December 1991|pages=98|isbn=978-0-9508981-6-2}}</ref> Dawson also told how Kennedy was released by the club after he was told: \"You will never make a pro as long as you have got a hole in your arse!\".<ref name=\"Tale\" /> Kennedy returned to his native north-east in March 1967 and started working in a sweet factory whilst playing as an amateur for New Hartley Juniors, where he built a successful attacking partnership with former England schoolboy international Ian Watts.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=44}}</ref> The pair scored 142 goals between them, and helped the club to win the East Northumberland Junior League, the Northumberland FA Junior Cup, the East Northumberland Junior League Cup, the North East Youth Challenge Cup, the East Northumberland Junior League Charlton Trophy, the Tynemouth Junior League Challenge Cup and the Magpie Trophy.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=45}}</ref>\n\n===Arsenal===\nKennedy was spotted by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] playing for New Hartley Juniors, and though the scouts had initially gone to the game to watch his striker partner Watts, Kennedy had impressed enough to win an apprentice contract with Arsenal in May 1968.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=46}}</ref> He then signed professional forms with the club in November 1968.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=53}}</ref> He had a difficult task though to win a first team place, as manager [[Bertie Mee]] used only 15 players throughout the entire [[1968\u201369 Arsenal F.C. season|1968\u201369]] season, during which time Kennedy made 20 appearances for the [[Arsenal F.C.

Kennedy played as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for Arsenal, and then played as a left-sided [[midfielder]] for Liverpool. He scored 148 goals in 581 league and cup appearances in a 15-year career in the [[English Football League]] and also won 17 caps for [[England national football team|England]] between 1976 and 1980, scoring three international goals.\n\nKennedy turned professional for Arsenal in November 1968. He made his first team debut ten months later, and went on to win the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] in 1970, the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] and [[FA Cup]] Double in 1970\u201371, and then play on the losing side in the [[1972 FA Cup Final]]. His form then declined, and he was sold to Liverpool for a club record \u00a3200,000 fee in July 1974, at the same time that [[Bill Shankly]] resigned as manager. He initially struggled at the club, but after manager [[Bob Paisley]] converted him to a left-sided midfielder he went on to help Liverpool to become the dominant club of English football from 1975 to 1982. During his time at the club Liverpool won the First Division five times (1975\u201376, 1976\u201377, 1978\u201379, 1979\u201380, and 1981\u201382), the [[FA Community Shield|FA Charity Shield]] four times (1976, 1977, 1979 and 1980), the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] three times, (1977, 1978, and 1981), and the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] (1976), [[UEFA Super Cup]] (1977), and [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] (1981). He also picked up runners-up medals in the FA Cup (1977), UEFA Super Cup (1978), League Cup (1981), and [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|World Club Championship]] (1981) and won the ''[[Match of the Day]]'''s [[BBC Goal of the Season|Goal of the Season]] award in 1977\u201378.\n\nHe was a strong player with an excellent first touch, intelligence, and all round ability. This allowed him to transition from a forward to a midfielder during his time at Liverpool. Despite his trophy successes with Arsenal and Liverpool, after winning six caps for the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-23]] side he was unable to translate his club form into a good international career, and was used as a stand-in for [[Trevor Brooking]] before he retired from international football in frustration in March 1981. His only international tournament appearance was at [[UEFA Euro 1980|Euro 1980]]. Bob Paisley described him as \"one of Liverpool's greatest players and probably the most underrated\".\n\nKennedy joined [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] for a \u00a3160,000 fee in January 1982 and added a [[Welsh Cup]] winners medal to his collection four months later. However the effects of [[Parkinson's disease]] began to reduce his effectiveness on the pitch, and he dropped into the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] with [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]] in November 1983. During the 1984\u201385 season he spent a brief time as player-manager of [[Cyprus]] club [[Pezoporikos Larnaca FC|Pezoporikos]] and later played for [[Northern Football League|Northern League]] club [[Ashington A.F.C.|Ashington]]. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in November 1984. His life after football was tough, as he had to deal with the effects of Parkinson's, the loss of his business, and the breakdown of his 15-year marriage. He remained reliant on charity to fund his medical expenses, and was forced to sell his medal collection and caps in 1993.\n\n==Club career==\nRay Kennedy was born on 28 July 1951 in [[Seaton Delaval]], a former [[pit village]] in [[Northumberland]], to Martin and Veronica Kennedy, a coal miner and housewife respectively.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=10}}</ref> He was the eldest of four children: Trevor, Michael, and Janet.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=26}}</ref> He was spotted playing schoolboy football by a scout at [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]], and began training at [[Vale Park]] after manager [[Stanley Matthews]] came to the Kennedy home to persuade him to sign schoolboy forms at the club.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=33}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Kennedy File|url=http://www.lfchistory.net/images/newspapers/magazines/various/raykennedy-diary.jpg|website=lfchistory.net|accessdate=30 May 2016}}</ref> However at the age of sixteen Matthews felt Kennedy was \"too slow to be a footballer\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Sherwin|first=Phil|title=The Port Vale Miscellany|publisher=The History Press|location=Brimscombe Port|year=2010|pages=16|isbn=978-0-7524-5777-2}}</ref> Kennedy was considered to be too big and clumsy to be a professional, and groundskeeper Dennis Dawson claimed that he was the only man at the club to see any potential in the youngster.<ref name=\"Tale\">{{cite book|last=Kent|first=Jeff|title=Port Vale Tales: A Collection Of Stories, Anecdotes And Memories|publisher=Witan Books|date=December 1991|pages=98|isbn=978-0-9508981-6-2}}</ref> Dawson also told how Kennedy was released by the club after he was told: \"You will never make a pro as long as you have got a hole in your arse!\".<ref name=\"Tale\" /> Kennedy returned to his native north-east in March 1967 and started working in a sweet factory whilst playing as an amateur for New Hartley Juniors, where he built a successful attacking partnership with former England schoolboy international Ian Watts.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=44}}</ref> The pair scored 142 goals between them, and helped the club to win the East Northumberland Junior League, the Northumberland FA Junior Cup, the East Northumberland Junior League Cup, the North East Youth Challenge Cup, the East Northumberland Junior League Charlton Trophy, the Tynemouth Junior League Challenge Cup and the Magpie Trophy.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=45}}</ref>\n\n===Arsenal===\nKennedy was spotted by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] playing for New Hartley Juniors, and though the scouts had initially gone to the game to watch his striker partner Watts, Kennedy had impressed enough to win an apprentice contract with Arsenal in May 1968.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=46}}</ref> He then signed professional forms with the club in November 1968.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=53}}</ref> He had a difficult task though to win a first team place, as manager [[Bertie Mee]] used only 15 players throughout the entire [[1968\u201369 Arsenal F.C. season|1968\u201369]] season, during which time Kennedy made 20 appearances for the [[Arsenal F.C.

The emergent cultures that arose from the migration of original Han settlers from the Yellow River is sometimes regarded as the starting point of the East Asian world. Nowadays, its population is around 2\u20132.5 billion (see [[Demographics of the world]]).\n\nThe Japanese historian Nishijima Sadao ({{Interlanguage link multi|\u897f\u5d8b\u5b9a\u751f|ja}}, 1919\u20131998), professor emeritus at the [[University of Tokyo]], originally coined the term \u6771\u4e9c\u6587\u5316\u570f (later borrowed into Chinese, see Etymology).

From China it proliferated to Korea and Japan, especially during the Tang dynasty (see Kukai). It could have also re-spread from China south to Vietnam.

During the [[Tang dynasty]], [[Buddhism]] from [[Buddhism in Nepal|Nepal]] also became a prominent philosophical and religious discipline. Neo-Confucianism has its origins in the [[Tang dynasty]]; the Confucianist scholar [[Han Yu]] is seen as a forebear of the Neo-Confucianists of the Song dynasty.<ref name=\"huang\">''Essentials of Neo-Confucianism: Eight Major Philosophers of the Song and Ming Periods'' by Huang, Siu-chi. {{Harvnb|Huang|1999|p=5}}.</ref> The Song dynasty philosopher [[Zhou Dunyi]] is seen as the first true \"pioneer\" of Neo-Confucianism, using Daoist metaphysics as a framework for his ethical philosophy.<ref name=\"chan\">''A Sourcebook of Chinese Philosophy'' by Chan, Wing-tsit. {{Harvnb|Chan|2002|p=460}}.</ref>\n\nElsewhere in East Asia, [[Japanese philosophy]] began to develop as indigenous [[Shinto]] beliefs fused with [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]] and other schools of [[Chinese philosophy]]. Similar to Japan, in [[Korean philosophy]] elements of [[Korean Shamanism|Shamanism]] were integrated into the [[Korean Confucianism|Neo-Confucianism]] imported from China. In Vietnam, neo-Confucianism was developed into Vietnamese own Tam gi\u00e1o as well, along with indigenous Vietnamese beliefs and [[Mahayana Buddhism]].\n\n==== Other religions ====\nThough not commonly identified with that of East Asia, the following religions have been influential in its history:\n\n# [[Hinduism]], see [[Hinduism in Vietnam]], [[Hinduism in China]]\n# Islam, see Xinjiang, [[Islam in China|Muslims in China]], [[Islam in Hong Kong]], [[Islam in Japan]], [[Islam in Korea]], [[Islam in Vietnam]].\n# Christianity, one of the most popular religions in Hong Kong, Korea etc.\n\n=== Language ===\n\n==== Historical linguistics ====\nVarious languages are thought to have originated in East Asia and have various degrees of influence on each other.

Historically, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam have used Chinese characters. Today, they are mainly used in China, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore albeit in different forms.\n\nMainland China and Singapore use [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified characters]], whereas Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau use [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional]].\n\nJapan still uses [[kanji]] but has also invented [[kana]], believed to be inspired by the abugida scripts of southern Asia.\n\nKorea used to write in [[hanja]] but has invented an alphabetic system called [[hangul]] (also inspired by Chinese and [[\u02bcPhags-pa script|phags-pa]] during the Mongol Empire) that is nowadays the majority script. However hanja is a required subject in South Korea. Names are also written in hanja. Hanja is also studied and used in academia, newspapers, and law; areas where a lot of scholarly terms and [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean loanwords]] are used and necessary to distinguish between otherwise ambiguous homonyms.\n[[File:FlowRoot3824.svg|thumb|388.991x388.991px|Development of kana from Chinese characters]]\n[[File:Map-Chinese Characters.png|thumb|Country where Han character is/was used]]\nVietnam used to write in [[History of writing in Vietnam|ch\u1eef H\u00e1n]] or [[Classical Chinese]].

Since French colonization, they have switched to using a modified version of the Latin alphabet called [[Vietnamese alphabet|ch\u1eef Qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef]]. However, Chinese characters still hold a special place in the cultures as their history and literature have been greatly influenced by Chinese characters. In Vietnam (and North Korea), hanzi can be seen in temples, cemeteries, and monuments today, as well as serving as decorative motifs in art and design. And there are movements to restore H\u00e1n N\u00f4m in Vietnam. (Also see [[History of writing in Vietnam]].)\n\nZhuang are similar to the Vietnamese in that they used to write in Sawgun (Chinese characters) and have invented many of their own characters called [[Sawndip]] (Immature characters or native characters). Sawndip is still used informally and in traditional settings, but in 1957, the People's Republic of China introduced an alphabetical script for the language, which is what it officially promotes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Multilingualism in China : the politics of writing reforms for minority languages, 1949-2002|last=Zhou, Minglang, 1954-|date=24 October 2012|isbn=9783110924596|location=Berlin|oclc=868954061}}</ref>\n\n=== Literature ===\n{{Main|Adoption of Chinese literary culture}}\n\nEast Asian literary culture was based on the use of [[Literary Chinese]], which became the medium of scholarship and government across the region.

Although Vietnam, Korea and Japan each developed writing systems for their own languages, these were limited to popular literature. Chinese remained the medium of formal writing until it was displaced by vernacular writing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.{{sfnp|Kornicki|2011|pp=66\u201367}} Though they did not use Chinese for spoken communication, each country had its own tradition of reading texts aloud, the so-called [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations]], which provide clues to the pronunciation of [[Middle Chinese]]. Chinese words with these pronunciations were also borrowed extensively into the local vernaculars, and today comprise over half their vocabularies.{{sfnp|Miyake|2004|pp=98\u201399}}\n\nBooks in Literary Chinese were widely distributed. By the 7th century and possibly earlier, [[woodblock printing]] had been developed in China. At first, it was used only to copy the Buddhist scriptures, but later secular works were also printed. By the 13th century, metal [[movable type]] was used by government printers in Korea, but seems to have not been extensively used in China, Vietnam, or Japan.

Reischauer]] also grouped China, Korea, and Japan together into a cultural sphere that he called the ''Sinic world''. These countries are centralized states that share a Confucian ethical philosophy. Reischauer states that this culture originated in Northern China, and compared the relationship between Northern China and East Asia to that of Greco-Roman civilization and Europe. The elites of East Asia were tied together through a common written language based on Chinese characters, much in the way that [[Latin]] had functioned in Europe.<ref name=\"Reischauer\" />\n\nThe American political scientist [[Samuel P. Huntington]] considered the Sinic world as one of many civilizations in his book ''[[The Clash of Civilizations]]''. He notes that \"all scholars recognize the existence of either a single distinct Chinese civilization dating back to at least 1500 B.C. and perhaps a thousand years earlier, or of two Chinese civilizations one succeeding the other in the early centuries of the Christian epoch.\"<ref>''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order.''

It is thought to have spread from India (perhaps Northeast India) via the Silk Road through Pakistan, Xinjiang, east as well as through SEA, Vietnam, then north through Guangzhou and Fujian. From China it proliferated to Korea and Japan, especially during the Tang dynasty (see Kukai). It could have also re-spread from China south to Vietnam.

During the [[Tang dynasty]], [[Buddhism]] from [[Buddhism in Nepal|Nepal]] also became a prominent philosophical and religious discipline. Neo-Confucianism has its origins in the [[Tang dynasty]]; the Confucianist scholar [[Han Yu]] is seen as a forebear of the Neo-Confucianists of the Song dynasty.<ref name=\"huang\">''Essentials of Neo-Confucianism: Eight Major Philosophers of the Song and Ming Periods'' by Huang, Siu-chi. {{Harvnb|Huang|1999|p=5}}.</ref> The Song dynasty philosopher [[Zhou Dunyi]] is seen as the first true \"pioneer\" of Neo-Confucianism, using Daoist metaphysics as a framework for his ethical philosophy.<ref name=\"chan\">''A Sourcebook of Chinese Philosophy'' by Chan, Wing-tsit. {{Harvnb|Chan|2002|p=460}}.</ref>\n\nElsewhere in East Asia, [[Japanese philosophy]] began to develop as indigenous [[Shinto]] beliefs fused with [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]] and other schools of [[Chinese philosophy]]. Similar to Japan, in [[Korean philosophy]] elements of [[Korean Shamanism|Shamanism]] were integrated into the [[Korean Confucianism|Neo-Confucianism]] imported from China. In Vietnam, neo-Confucianism was developed into Vietnamese own Tam gi\u00e1o as well, along with indigenous Vietnamese beliefs and [[Mahayana Buddhism]].\n\n==== Other religions ====\nThough not commonly identified with that of East Asia, the following religions have been influential in its history:\n\n# [[Hinduism]], see [[Hinduism in Vietnam]], [[Hinduism in China]]\n# Islam, see Xinjiang, [[Islam in China|Muslims in China]], [[Islam in Hong Kong]], [[Islam in Japan]], [[Islam in Korea]], [[Islam in Vietnam]].\n# Christianity, one of the most popular religions in Hong Kong, Korea etc.\n\n=== Language ===\n\n==== Historical linguistics ====\nVarious languages are thought to have originated in East Asia and have various degrees of influence on each other.

Historically, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam have used Chinese characters. Today, they are mainly used in China, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore albeit in different forms.\n\nMainland China and Singapore use [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified characters]], whereas Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau use [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional]].\n\nJapan still uses [[kanji]] but has also invented [[kana]], believed to be inspired by the abugida scripts of southern Asia.\n\nKorea used to write in [[hanja]] but has invented an alphabetic system called [[hangul]] (also inspired by Chinese and [[\u02bcPhags-pa script|phags-pa]] during the Mongol Empire) that is nowadays the majority script. However hanja is a required subject in South Korea. Names are also written in hanja. Hanja is also studied and used in academia, newspapers, and law; areas where a lot of scholarly terms and [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean loanwords]] are used and necessary to distinguish between otherwise ambiguous homonyms.\n[[File:FlowRoot3824.svg|thumb|388.991x388.991px|Development of kana from Chinese characters]]\n[[File:Map-Chinese Characters.png|thumb|Country where Han character is/was used]]\nVietnam used to write in [[History of writing in Vietnam|ch\u1eef H\u00e1n]] or [[Classical Chinese]].

Since French colonization, they have switched to using a modified version of the Latin alphabet called [[Vietnamese alphabet|ch\u1eef Qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef]]. However, Chinese characters still hold a special place in the cultures as their history and literature have been greatly influenced by Chinese characters. In Vietnam (and North Korea), hanzi can be seen in temples, cemeteries, and monuments today, as well as serving as decorative motifs in art and design. And there are movements to restore H\u00e1n N\u00f4m in Vietnam. (Also see [[History of writing in Vietnam]].)\n\nZhuang are similar to the Vietnamese in that they used to write in Sawgun (Chinese characters) and have invented many of their own characters called [[Sawndip]] (Immature characters or native characters). Sawndip is still used informally and in traditional settings, but in 1957, the People's Republic of China introduced an alphabetical script for the language, which is what it officially promotes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Multilingualism in China : the politics of writing reforms for minority languages, 1949-2002|last=Zhou, Minglang, 1954-|date=24 October 2012|isbn=9783110924596|location=Berlin|oclc=868954061}}</ref>\n\n=== Literature ===\n{{Main|Adoption of Chinese literary culture}}\n\nEast Asian literary culture was based on the use of [[Literary Chinese]], which became the medium of scholarship and government across the region.

Although Vietnam, Korea and Japan each developed writing systems for their own languages, these were limited to popular literature. Chinese remained the medium of formal writing until it was displaced by vernacular writing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.{{sfnp|Kornicki|2011|pp=66\u201367}} Though they did not use Chinese for spoken communication, each country had its own tradition of reading texts aloud, the so-called [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations]], which provide clues to the pronunciation of [[Middle Chinese]]. Chinese words with these pronunciations were also borrowed extensively into the local vernaculars, and today comprise over half their vocabularies.{{sfnp|Miyake|2004|pp=98\u201399}}\n\nBooks in Literary Chinese were widely distributed. By the 7th century and possibly earlier, [[woodblock printing]] had been developed in China. At first, it was used only to copy the Buddhist scriptures, but later secular works were also printed. By the 13th century, metal [[movable type]] was used by government printers in Korea, but seems to have not been extensively used in China, Vietnam, or Japan.

Reischauer]] also grouped China, Korea, and Japan together into a cultural sphere that he called the ''Sinic world''. These countries are centralized states that share a Confucian ethical philosophy. Reischauer states that this culture originated in Northern China, and compared the relationship between Northern China and East Asia to that of Greco-Roman civilization and Europe. The elites of East Asia were tied together through a common written language based on Chinese characters, much in the way that [[Latin]] had functioned in Europe.<ref name=\"Reischauer\" />\n\nThe American political scientist [[Samuel P. Huntington]] considered the Sinic world as one of many civilizations in his book ''[[The Clash of Civilizations]]''. He notes that \"all scholars recognize the existence of either a single distinct Chinese civilization dating back to at least 1500 B.C. and perhaps a thousand years earlier, or of two Chinese civilizations one succeeding the other in the early centuries of the Christian epoch.\"<ref>''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order.''

The first 10 locomotives were imported from [[Adtranz|ABB]] in [[Switzerland]] in 1995. They are supposed to be a variant of the Swiss [[SBB-CFF-FFS Re 460|Lok 2000]] (Design concept) and German [[DB Class 120]] (mechanical chassis).\n\nOne of the notable features of WAP-5 is [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]]. Other notable features of this loco are the provision of taps from the main loco transformer for [[hotel load]], pantry loads, flexible gear coupling, wheel-mounted [[disc brakes]], and a potential for speed enhancement to {{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}}. Braking systems include {{convert|160|kN|lbf|abbr=on}} regenerative brakes, loco disc brakes, automatic train air brakes, and a charged spring [[Parking brake#Railroad hand brakes|parking brake]].\n\nOn 3 July 2014, a WAP-5 set an Indian speed record by hauling a train from Delhi to Agra within 90 minutes at a speed of {{convert|160|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite news |title=200 km in 90 mins: Delhi-Agra high speed train sets new speed record |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-07-03/news/51057656_1_speed-record-fastest-train-passenger-train |accessdate=10 July 2014 |publisher=[[The Economic Times]] |date=3 July  2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Gatimaan Express]] and [[Bhopal Shatabdi]] trains hauled by WAP-5 locomotives travel at {{convert|160|km/h|abbr=on}} and {{convert|150|km/h|abbr=on}} respectively in the [[New Delhi]] - [[Agra Cantt]] section.\n\n==Sheds holding WAP-5==\nAs of now, 3 Electric Locomotive Sheds home these locomotives which are as follows: -\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Thus the '''Amul''' livery came into existence. The livery has the sides of locomotive painted in Amul livery. All the recent locomotives are being painted in this livery as part of contract.\n* WAP-5 locomotives homed at Ghaziabad loco shed have large '''P-5''' decals on their body sides.\n* New WAP-5 Livery Of '''Fortune Edible Oils''' Is Released by '''Vadodra(BRC)''' Electic Loco Shed With Loco Number-30081 .\n\n==Technical Specifications==\nSpecifications are as follows:<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco2e.html#loco| title=Indian railway fan club }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|+Technical Specifications\n! colspan=2 | '''General Information'''\n|-\n|Gauge\n|Broad gauge {{convert|1676|mm|ftin|abbr=on|frac=8}}\n|-\n|Line voltage\n|25000 V\n|-\n|Type of current\n|Alternating Current (AC)\n|-\n|Axle load\n|{{convert|19.5|t}} \n|-\n|UIC classification\n|[[Bo-Bo]]\n|-\n|Length over head-stocks\n|{{convert|16880|mm|ftin|abbr=on|frac=8}}\n|-\n|Length over buffers\n|{{convert|18162|mm|ftin|abbr=on|frac=8}}\n|-\n|Bogie wheel base \n|{{convert|2800|mm|ftin|abbr=on|frac=8}}\n|-\n|Wheel base\n|{{convert|13000|mm|ftin|abbr=on|frac=8}}\n|-\n|Body width\n|{{convert|3142|mm|ftin|abbr=on|frac=8}}\n|-\n|Cab length\n|{{convert|2434|mm|ftin|abbr=on|frac=8}}\n|-\n|Pantograph locked down height\n|{{convert|4237|mm|ftin|abbr=on|frac=8}}\n|-\n| Bogie center distance\n| {{convert|10200|mm|ftin|abbr=on|frac=8}}\n|-\n| Height over pantograph\n| {{convert|4237|mm|ftin|abbr=on|frac=8}}\n|-\n| Body width\n| {{convert|3142|mm|ftin|abbr=on|frac=8}}\n|-\n| Coupling\n| [[Railway coupling|Central Buffer Couplers]] (CBC)\n|-\n| Surface\n| corrugated or plain\n|-\n! colspan=2|'''Traction motors'''\n|-\n|Type\n|6FXA 7059 3-phase asynchronous motors, {{convert|1563|hp|kW|abbr=on|order=flip}}, 2180 V, 370 A continuous, 396 A for 1 hr, 540 A max, 1585 rpm continuous, 3174 rpm max, Weight 1990&nbsp;kg.

They are supposed to be a variant of the Swiss [[SBB-CFF-FFS Re 460|Lok 2000]] (Design concept) and German [[DB Class 120]] (mechanical chassis).\n\nOne of the notable features of WAP-5 is [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]]. Other notable features of this loco are the provision of taps from the main loco transformer for [[hotel load]], pantry loads, flexible gear coupling, wheel-mounted [[disc brakes]], and a potential for speed enhancement to {{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}}. Braking systems include {{convert|160|kN|lbf|abbr=on}} regenerative brakes, loco disc brakes, automatic train air brakes, and a charged spring [[Parking brake#Railroad hand brakes|parking brake]].\n\nOn 3 July 2014, a WAP-5 set an Indian speed record by hauling a train from Delhi to Agra within 90 minutes at a speed of {{convert|160|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite news |title=200 km in 90 mins: Delhi-Agra high speed train sets new speed record |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-07-03/news/51057656_1_speed-record-fastest-train-passenger-train |accessdate=10 July 2014 |publisher=[[The Economic Times]] |date=3 July  2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Gatimaan Express]] and [[Bhopal Shatabdi]] trains hauled by WAP-5 locomotives travel at {{convert|160|km/h|abbr=on}} and {{convert|150|km/h|abbr=on}} respectively in the [[New Delhi]] - [[Agra Cantt]] section.\n\n==Sheds holding WAP-5==\nAs of now, 3 Electric Locomotive Sheds home these locomotives which are as follows: -\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The control software was also modified accordingly.\n\nAnother locomotive (no. 30164) was rolled out with aerodynamic cab profile.\n\n==Head on Generation==\nA WAP-5 locomotive (loco no. 30140) with '''head-on generation''' (HOG) was rolled by CLW in June 2018. In this locomotive, the hotel load converter has been accommodated in the same cubicle of traction converter.\n\nMore locomotives of this type will be rolled out in future.\n\n==Up-gradation to 6000HP==\nIn March 2018, CLW rolled out a WAP-5 locomotive (no. 30136) with an enhanced power output of about 4500&nbsp;kW (above 6000 HP).

Thus the '''Amul''' livery came into existence. The livery has the sides of locomotive painted in Amul livery. All the recent locomotives are being painted in this livery as part of contract.\n* WAP-5 locomotives homed at Ghaziabad loco shed have large '''P-5''' decals on their body sides.\n* New WAP-5 Livery Of '''Fortune Edible Oils''' Is Released by '''Vadodra(BRC)''' Electic Loco Shed With Loco Number-30081 .\n\n==Technical Specifications==\nSpecifications are as follows:<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco2e.html#loco| title=Indian railway fan club }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|+Technical Specifications\n! colspan=2 | '''General Information'''\n|-\n|Gauge\n|Broad gauge {{convert|1676|mm|ftin|abbr=on|frac=8}}\n|-\n|Line voltage\n|25000 V\n|-\n|Type of current\n|Alternating Current (AC)\n|-\n|Axle load\n|{{convert|19.5|t}} \n|-\n|UIC classification\n|[[Bo-Bo]]\n|-\n|Length over head-stocks\n|{{convert|16880|mm|ftin|abbr=on|frac=8}}\n|-\n|Length over buffers\n|{{convert|18162|mm|ftin|abbr=on|frac=8}}\n|-\n|Bogie wheel base \n|{{convert|2800|mm|ftin|abbr=on|frac=8}}\n|-\n|Wheel base\n|{{convert|13000|mm|ftin|abbr=on|frac=8}}\n|-\n|Body width\n|{{convert|3142|mm|ftin|abbr=on|frac=8}}\n|-\n|Cab length\n|{{convert|2434|mm|ftin|abbr=on|frac=8}}\n|-\n|Pantograph locked down height\n|{{convert|4237|mm|ftin|abbr=on|frac=8}}\n|-\n| Bogie center distance\n| {{convert|10200|mm|ftin|abbr=on|frac=8}}\n|-\n| Height over pantograph\n| {{convert|4237|mm|ftin|abbr=on|frac=8}}\n|-\n| Body width\n| {{convert|3142|mm|ftin|abbr=on|frac=8}}\n|-\n| Coupling\n| [[Railway coupling|Central Buffer Couplers]] (CBC)\n|-\n| Surface\n| corrugated or plain\n|-\n! colspan=2|'''Traction motors'''\n|-\n|Type\n|6FXA 7059 3-phase asynchronous motors, {{convert|1563|hp|kW|abbr=on|order=flip}}, 2180 V, 370 A continuous, 396 A for 1 hr, 540 A max, 1585 rpm continuous, 3174 rpm max, Weight 1990&nbsp;kg.
