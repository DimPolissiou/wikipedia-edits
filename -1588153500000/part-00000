Since ''z''<sub>0</sub> is a local maximum for this function also, it follows from the [[maximum principle]] that |''f''(''z'')| is constant. Then, using the [[Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations]] we show that ''{{prime|f}}''(''z'') = 0, and thus that ''f''(''z'') is constant as well.

The group have also recorded traditional ballad-style songs with piano accompaniment.\n\nA common motif in many of the group's songs is the use of the onomatopoeic [[gitaigo]] phrase \"pyon pyon\", to suggest the hopping sound that rabbits make. Their songs are also notable for including humorous dialogue between Bucho and the female members, usually with Bucho giving orders to the girls in the style of a military commander or the girls answering back at Bucho or making fun of him.

In {{Nihongo|'''Feelings of the Rabbit'''|\u3046\u3055\u304e\u306e\u304d\u3082\u3061}} this theme is discussed in detail and the accompanying music video includes scenes where a [[UFO]] arrives on earth and starts attacking cities while the group look on in disbelief. The success (or otherwise) of this invasion is dependent on whether humans can put aside their differences to work together to fend off the alien threat. The \"alien threat\" concept can also be read as a wry commentary on the notoriously competitive J-pop idol scene,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/aug/21/popandrock3 |website=The Guardian |title=Japan's bizarre music industry: J-Pop's dream factory |date=2005-08-21 |access-date=2019-03-02}}</ref> humorously referred to in earlier interviews with Bucho as the {{Nihongo|\"idol warring states era\"|\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u6226\u56fd\u6642\u4ee3}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tablo.jp/culture/idol/news003496.html |website=TABLO |title=2018\u5e74\u4e0a\u534a\u671f\u306b\u89e3\u6563\u3057\u305f\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u7dcf\u307e\u3068\u3081\u3000\u300e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u6226\u56fd\u6642\u4ee3\u300f\u306f\u672c\u5f53\u306b\u7d42\u308f\u3063\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f\u306e\u304b |date=2018-07-02 |access-date=2019-03-02 |language=Japanese}}</ref> In order for the group to survive and realise their dream of success, they must compete against the vast promotional budgets of the major talent agencies and record labels.

The group have also recorded traditional ballad-style songs with piano accompaniment.\n\nA common motif in many of the group's songs is the use of the onomatopoeic [[gitaigo]] phrase \"pyon pyon\", to suggest the hopping sound that rabbits make. Their songs are also notable for including humorous dialogue between Bucho and the female members, usually with Bucho giving orders to the girls in the style of a military commander or the girls answering back at Bucho or making fun of him.

In {{Nihongo|'''Feelings of the Rabbit'''|\u3046\u3055\u304e\u306e\u304d\u3082\u3061}} this theme is discussed in detail and the accompanying music video includes scenes where a [[UFO]] arrives on earth and starts attacking cities while the group look on in disbelief. The success (or otherwise) of this invasion is dependent on whether humans can put aside their differences to work together to fend off the alien threat. The \"alien threat\" concept can also be read as a wry commentary on the notoriously competitive J-pop idol scene,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/aug/21/popandrock3 |website=The Guardian |title=Japan's bizarre music industry: J-Pop's dream factory |date=2005-08-21 |access-date=2019-03-02}}</ref> humorously referred to in earlier interviews with Bucho as the {{Nihongo|\"idol warring states era\"|\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u6226\u56fd\u6642\u4ee3}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tablo.jp/culture/idol/news003496.html |website=TABLO |title=2018\u5e74\u4e0a\u534a\u671f\u306b\u89e3\u6563\u3057\u305f\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u7dcf\u307e\u3068\u3081\u3000\u300e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u6226\u56fd\u6642\u4ee3\u300f\u306f\u672c\u5f53\u306b\u7d42\u308f\u3063\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f\u306e\u304b |date=2018-07-02 |access-date=2019-03-02 |language=Japanese}}</ref> In order for the group to survive and realise their dream of success, they must compete against the vast promotional budgets of the major talent agencies and record labels.
