{"title_page": "Pac-Man", "text_new": "{{kner and Garcia]]. The ''Pac-Man'' video game franchise remains one of the highest-grossing and best-selling game series of all time, generating more than $14 billion in revenue ({{as of|2016|lc=yes}}) and $43 million in sales combined. The character of Pac-Man is the mascot and flagship icon of [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]] and has the highest brand awareness of any video game character in North America.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Pac-man.png|thumb|left|In-game screenshot. The four ghosts are at box in the center of the screen; Pac-Man is situated underneath them. To the bottom is the player's life count and the level icon (represented by a cherry), to the top is the player's score.]]\n''Pac-Man'' is a [[maze video game|maze chase]] video game. The player controls [[Pac-Man (character)|the titular character]] through an enclosed maze; the objective of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding four colored ghosts \u2014 Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan), and Clyde (orange) \u2014 that pursue him. When all of the dots are eaten, the player advances to the next level. If Pac-Man makes contact with a ghost, he will lose a life; the game ends when all lives are lost. Each of the four ghosts have their own unique, distinct [[artificial intelligence]] (A.I.), or \"personalities\"; Blinky gives direct chase to Pac-Man, Pinky and Inky try to position themselves in front of Pac-Man, usually by cornering him, and Clyde will switch between chasing Pac-Man and fleeing from him.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |title=News Headlines |publisher=Cnbc.com |date=March 3, 2011 |accessdate=May 22, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015061417/http://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |archivedate=October 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |title=Five Things You Never Knew About Pac-Man |last=CNBC.com |first=Chris Morris{{!}}Special to |date=2011-03-03 |website=www.cnbc.com |access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |title=Five Things You Never Knew About Pac-Man |last=CNBC.com |first=Chris Morris{{!}}Special to |date=2011-03-03 |website=www.cnbc.com |access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref>\n\nPlaced at the four corners of the maze are large flashing \"energizers\", or \"power pellets\". Eating these will cause the ghosts to turn blue with a dizzied expression and reverse direction. Pac-Man can eat blue ghosts for bonus points; when eaten, their eyes make their way back to the center box in the maze. Eating multiple blue ghosts in succession increases their point value. Blue-colored ghosts will flash white when they are about to turn back into their normal, lethal form. Eating a certain number of dots in a level will cause a bonus item, usually in the form of a fruit, to appear underneath the regeneration box, which can be eaten for bonus points.\n\nThe game increases in difficulty as the player progresses; the ghosts become faster and the power pellets decrease in length, to the point where the ghosts will no longer turn blue and edible. To the sides of the maze are two large \"warp tunnels\", which allow Pac-Man and the ghosts to travel to the opposite side of the screen. Ghosts become slower when entering and exiting these tunnels. Levels are indicated by the fruit icon at the bottom of the screen. In-between levels are short cutscenes featuring Pac-Man and Blinky in humorous, comical situations. The game becomes unplayable at the 256th level due to an [[integer overflow]] that affects the game's memory, rendering this level unbeatable.<ref>{{cite book |title=Cult Fiction |last1=Dwyer |first1=James |last2=Dwyer |first2=Brendan |publisher=Paused Books |year=2014 |isbn=9780992988401 |page=14}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\nAfter acquiring the struggling Japanese division of [[Atari]] in 1976, video game developer [[Namco]] had begun producing their own video games in-house, as opposed to simply licensing them from other developers and distributing them in Japan.<ref name=\"nytimes nakamura\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/business/pac-man-masaya-nakamura-dead.html?_r=0 |title=Masaya Nakamura, Whose Company Created Pac-Man, Dies at 91 |first=Jonathan |last=Sobel |date=January 30, 2017 |accessdate=January 30, 2017 |work=[[New York Times]]}}</ref><ref name=\"Ultimate History\"/> Company president [[Masaya Nakamura (businessman)|Masaya Nakamura]] created a small video game development group within the company and ordered them to study several [[NEC]]-produced microcomputers to potentially create new games with.<ref name=\"AAN\">{{cite book |author1=Microcomputer BASIC Editorial Department |title=All About Namco |date=December 1986 |publisher=Dempa Shimbun |isbn=978-4885541070 |language=Japanese}}</ref><ref name=\"Supercade\">{{cite book |title=Supercade |last=Burnham |first=Van |year=2001 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-262-02492-6 |page=181}}</ref> One of the first people assigned to this division was a young 24-year-old employee named [[Toru Iwatani]].<ref name=\"Programmers At Work\"/> He created Namco's first video game ''[[Gee Bee (video game)|Gee Bee]]'' in 1978, which while unsuccessful helped the company gain a stronger foothold in the quickly-growing video game industry.<ref name=\"4Gamer\">{{cite web |last1=Kurokawa |first1=Fumio |title=\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u8a9e\u308a\u90e8\u305f\u3061 \u7b2c4\u90e8\uff1a\u77f3\u6751\u7e41\u4e00\u6c0f\u304c\u8a9e\u308b\u30ca\u30e0\u30b3\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u5275\u696d\u8005\u30fb\u4e2d\u6751\u96c5\u54c9\u6c0f\u306e\u9b45\u529b |url=https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20180313040/ |language=Japanese |website=[[4Gamer]] |publisher=Aetas |accessdate=2 August 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190801205701/https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20180313040/ |archivedate=1 August 2019 |date=17 March 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Akagi\">{{cite book|last=Masumi|first= Akagi |title=It Started With Pong |publisher=Amusement News Agency |year=2005 |page=183-184}}</ref> He also assisted in the production of two sequels, ''[[Bomb Bee]]'' and ''[[Cutie Q]]'', both released in 1979.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bomb Bee - Videogame by Namco |url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7179 |website=[[Killer List of Videogames]] |publisher=The International Arcade Museum |accessdate=1 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802063946/http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7179 |archivedate=2 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Cutie Q - Videogame by Namco |url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7462 |website=[[Killer List of Videogames]] |publisher=The International Arcade Museum |accessdate=1 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016144809/https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7462 |archivedate=16 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Toru Iwatani, creator of Pac-Man, at GDC 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Creator [[Toru Iwatani]] at the 2011 [[Game Developers Conference]].]]\nThe Japanese video game industry had surged in popularity with games such as ''[[Space Invaders]]'' and ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]'', which lead to the market being flooded with similar titles from other manufacturers in an attempt to cash in on the success.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Interview\"/><ref name=\"Iwatani\">{{cite book|last=Iwatani |first=Toru |title=Introduction to Pac-Man's Game Science |publisher=[[Enterbrain]] |year=2005 |page=33}}</ref> Iwatani felt that arcade games only appealed to men for their crude graphics and violence,<ref name=\"Eurogamer Interview\"/> and that arcades in general were seen as seedy environments.<ref name=\"Time\"/> For his next project, Iwatani chose to create a non-violent, cheerful video game that appealed mostly to women,<ref>{{cite book| first=Chris | last=Kohler |year=2005|title=Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life|publisher=[[BradyGames]]|pages=51\u201352|isbn=0-7440-0424-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=auMTAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=July 16, 2019}}</ref> as he believed that attracting women and couples into arcades would potentially make them appear to be much-more family friendly in tone.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Interview\"/> Iwatani began thinking of things that women liked to do in their time;

The player controls [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]], who must eat all the dots inside an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts. Eating large flashing dots called power pellets causes the ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points.\n\nThe development of the game began in early 1979, directed by [[Toru Iwatani]] with a nine-man team. Iwatani wanted to create a game that could appeal to women as well as men, because most video games of the time have themes of war or sports. Although the inspiration for the Pac-Man character was, reportedly, the image of a pizza with a slice removed, Iwatani has said he also rounded out the Japanese symbol \"kuchi\", meaning \"mouth\". The in-game characters were made to be cute and colorful to appeal to younger players. The original Japanese title of ''Puckman'' was derived from the titular character's hockey-puck shape.\n\n''Pac-Man'' was a widespread critical and commercial success, and has an enduring commercial and cultural legacy. The game is important and influential, and it is commonly listed as one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]]. The success of the game led to several [[List of Pac-Man video games|sequels]], merchandise, and two television series, as well as a hit single by [[Buckner & Garcia|Buckner and Garcia]]. The ''Pac-Man'' video game franchise remains one of the highest-grossing and best-selling game series of all time, generating more than $14 billion in revenue ({{as of|2016|lc=yes}}) and $43 million in sales combined. The character of Pac-Man is the mascot and flagship icon of [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]] and has the highest brand awareness of any video game character in North America.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Pac-man.png|thumb|left|In-game screenshot. The four ghosts are at box in the center of the screen; Pac-Man is situated underneath them. To the bottom is the player's life count and the level icon (represented by a cherry), to the top is the player's score.]]\n''Pac-Man'' is a [[maze video game|maze chase]] video game. The player controls [[Pac-Man (character)|the titular character]] through an enclosed maze; the objective of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding four colored ghosts \u2014 Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan), and Clyde (orange) \u2014 that pursue him. When all of the dots are eaten, the player advances to the next level. If Pac-Man makes contact with a ghost, he will lose a life; the game ends when all lives are lost. Each of the four ghosts have their own unique, distinct [[artificial intelligence]] (A.I.), or \"personalities\"; Blinky gives direct chase to Pac-Man, Pinky and Inky try to position themselves in front of Pac-Man, usually by cornering him, and Clyde will switch between chasing Pac-Man and fleeing from him.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |title=News Headlines |publisher=Cnbc.com |date=March 3, 2011 |accessdate=May 22, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015061417/http://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |archivedate=October 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |title=Five Things You Never Knew About Pac-Man |last=CNBC.com |first=Chris Morris{{!}}Special to |date=2011-03-03 |website=www.cnbc.com |access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |title=Five Things You Never Knew About Pac-Man |last=CNBC.com |first=Chris Morris{{!}}Special to |date=2011-03-03 |website=www.cnbc.com |access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref>\n\nPlaced at the four corners of the maze are large flashing \"energizers\", or \"power pellets\". Eating these will cause the ghosts to turn blue with a dizzied expression and reverse direction. Pac-Man can eat blue ghosts for bonus points; when eaten, their eyes make their way back to the center box in the maze. Eating multiple blue ghosts in succession increases their point value. Blue-colored ghosts will flash white when they are about to turn back into their normal, lethal form. Eating a certain number of dots in a level will cause a bonus item, usually in the form of a fruit, to appear underneath the regeneration box, which can be eaten for bonus points.\n\nThe game increases in difficulty as the player progresses; the ghosts become faster and the power pellets decrease in length, to the point where the ghosts will no longer turn blue and edible. To the sides of the maze are two large \"warp tunnels\", which allow Pac-Man and the ghosts to travel to the opposite side of the screen. Ghosts become slower when entering and exiting these tunnels.

At the end of the previous season, Zadar had become champions of the [[Yugoslav First Basketball League|Yugoslav League]], and had the right to participate in the [[FIBA European Champions Cup]] (EuroLeague). Komazec made great performances, and led his team in the fourth place of the top 6 semifinal group stage. After six years in Zadar, where he became the absolute leader and scorer of his team, he made the big step in his career for the transcription of the [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]] (which was then the best in Europe) and [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]], of the head coach [[\u017deljko Pavli\u010devi\u0107]] and the Greek superstar [[Nikos Galis]]. There he found an old acquaintance from years of Zadar, [[Stojko Vrankovi\u0107]], who had just returned from the [[NBA]]. \n\nIn a year that began with ambitions to win the championship, for Panathinaikos and him also, won only the [[Greek Basketball Cup|1993 Greek Cup]], in a final against [[Aris B.C.|Sato Aris]]. Komazec, although he did some excellent performances, did not respond satisfactorily to Panathinaikos, who was preparing to make the fling at European level, and in the summer he was [[loan (sports)|loaned]] to [[Pallacanestro Varese|Cagiva Varese]], where he played the next two seasons (1993\u201394 in [[Serie A2 Basket|A2]] & 1994\u201395 [[Lega Basket Serie A|A1]]), and made impressive performances. \n\nThe impression that he made by his performance in Varese, caused [[Virtus Pallacanestro Bologna|Buckler Beer Bologna]], which was the dominant team of the [[Lega Basket Serie A|Italian League]] the previous years, to buy his contract from Panathinaikos, and close a deal with him for the next two years, in an effort to replace the large void left in the team by [[Predrag Danilovi\u0107|Sa\u0161a Danilovi\u0107]] leaving for the [[NBA]]'s [[Miami Heat]]. The Croatian star didn't succeed one more time to respond to the high demands of competitive sport at the top level, and he only led Virtus to the meager wins of the [[Italian Basketball Supercup|Italian Supercup]] in 1996, and the [[Italian Basketball Cup|Italian Cup]] in 1997. This failure brought him back again to Varese the next year (1997\u201398), where rediscovered his best self, and with a scoring recital, he led the Lombardy team to the playoffs semifinals in the Italian League, and on the course to a participation in the EuroLeague, for the first time 20 years. \n\nIn the summer of 1998, came the third and final chance for Komazec to make an important achievement in a great club of European basketball, as he agreed to play for [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]] of [[head coach]] [[Du\u0161an Ivkovi\u0107]]. Arijan began the season doing very well, and everything indicated that the experiment for the player and the club could end up in achieving something good at the end of the season, when the major club titles, both in Greece and in Europe were contested. But an injury put him off of the court for half a month, and he became substantially off in his playing form, throughout the remaining part of the season. His participation at the [[1999 FIBA EuroLeague Final Four]], in [[Munich]], was the only one in his short and essentially failed time at Olympiacos. \n\nIn the next season (1999\u201300), he returned to his roots, and he quite unexpectedly was joined in [[KK Zadar|Zadar]] by [[Dino Ra\u0111a]]. Together, the duo led the [[Dalmatia]]n club to the semifinals of the [[FIBA Saporta Cup]], where they lost to the Greek club [[AEK B.C.|AEK]]. \u03a4hey won the [[Kre\u0161imir \u0106osi\u0107 Cup|Croatian Cup]] in the same season, which marked the last success of his career.\n\nHe was briefly a part of the [[Memphis Grizzlies|Vancouver Grizzlies]] [[NBA]] team, during the 2000\u201301 season, but he only spent one month with the team, and he did not play in any official NBA games with them.\n\n==National team career==\nKomazec was a member of the senior [[Yugoslavia national basketball team|Yugoslavian national team]] (1990\u201392), and then the senior  [[Croatia national basketball team|Croatian national team]]. He was a part of the Croatian teams that won silver at the [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Summer Olympics]], and bronze at [[EuroBasket]] [[EuroBasket 1993|1993]] and [[EuroBasket 1995|1995]].\n\n== Personal life ==\nHis father is Milan Komazec, a former basketball player who won three [[Yugoslav First Basketball League|Yugoslav First League]] championships ([[1965 Yugoslav First Basketball League|1965]], [[1967 Yugoslav First Basketball League|1967]], and [[1967\u201368 Yugoslav First Basketball League|1968]]) with Zadar.

Marx and Engels probably derived the concept from [[Adam Smith]]'s reference to the \"productive powers of labour\" (see e.g. chapter 8 of ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''), although the German political economist [[Friedrich List]] also mentions the concept of \"productive powers\" in ''The National System of Political Economy'' (1841).\n\nAll those forces which are applied by people in the production process (body and brain, tools and techniques, materials, resources, quality of workers' cooperation, and equipment) are encompassed by this concept, including those management and engineering functions technically indispensable for production (as contrasted with social control functions). Human [[knowledge]] can also be a productive force.\n\nTogether with the social and technical [[relations of production]], the productive forces constitute a historically specific [[mode of production]].\n\n== Labor ==\n[[Karl Marx]] emphasized that with few exceptions means of labour are not a productive force unless they are actually operated, maintained and conserved by living human labour. Without applying living human labour, their physical condition and value would deteriorate, depreciate, or be destroyed (an example would be a [[ghost town]] or capital depreciation due to [[strike action]]).\n\nCapital itself, being one of the [[factors of production]], comes to be viewed in capitalist society as a productive force in its own right, independent from labour, a subject with \"a life of its own\". Indeed, Marx sees the essence of what he calls \"the capital relation\" as being summarised by the circumstance that \"capital buys labour\", i.e. the power of property ownership to command human energy and labour-time, and thus of inanimate \"things\" to exert an autonomous power over people. What disappears from view is that the power of capital depends in the last instance on human cooperation.\n\n{{Quotation|\"The production of life, both of one\u2019s own in labour and of fresh life in procreation... appears as a double relationship: on the one hand as a natural, on the other as a social relationship. By social we understand the co-operation of several individuals, no matter under what conditions, in what manner and to what end. It follows from this that a certain mode of production, or industrial stage, is always combined with a certain mode of co-operation, or social stage, and this mode of co-operation is itself a \u201cproductive force.\u201d<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm]</ref>}}\n\nThe productive power of cooperation comes to be viewed as the productive power of capital, because it is capital which forcibly organises people, rather than people organising capital. Marx regarded this as a supreme [[Reification (Marxism)|reification]].\n\nUnlike British classical economics, [[Marxian economics]] classifies financial capital as being an element of the relations of production, rather than the factors or forces of production (\"not a thing, but a social relation between persons, established by the instrumentality of things\").<ref>Marx, Karl. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch33.htm ''[[Das Kapital]]'', Vol. I, Ch. 33], courtesy of www.marxists.org.</ref>\n\n== Destructive forces ==\nMarx and Engels did not believe that human history featured a continuous growth of the productive forces. Rather, the development of the productive forces was characterised by social conflicts. Some productive forces destroyed other productive forces, sometimes productive techniques were lost or destroyed, and sometimes productive forces could be turned into destructive forces:\n\n{{Quotation|\"How little highly developed productive forces are safe from complete destruction, given even a relatively very extensive commerce, is proved by the Phoenicians, whose inventions were for the most part lost for a long time to come through the ousting of this nation from commerce, its conquest by Alexander and its consequent decline. Likewise, for instance, glass-painting in the Middle Ages. Only when commerce has become world commerce, and has as its basis large-scale industry, when all nations are drawn into the competitive struggle, is the permanence of the acquired productive forces assured. (...) Competition soon compelled every country that wished to retain its historical role to protect its manufactures {{sic}} by renewed customs regulations (the old duties were no longer any good against big industry) and soon after to introduce big industry under protective duties. Big industry universalised competition in spite of these protective measures (it is practical free trade; the protective duty is only a palliative, a measure of defence within free trade), established means of communication and the modern world market, subordinated trade to itself, transformed all capital into industrial capital, and thus produced the rapid circulation (development of the financial system) and the centralisation of capital. By universal competition it forced all individuals to strain their energy to the utmost. It destroyed as far as possible ideology, religion, morality, etc. and where it could not do this, made them into a palpable lie. It produced world history for the first time, insofar as it made all civilised nations and every individual member of them dependent for the satisfaction of their wants on the whole world, thus destroying the former natural exclusiveness of separate nations. It made natural science subservient to capital and took from the division of labour the last semblance of its natural character. It destroyed natural growth in general, as far as this is possible while labour exists, and resolved all natural relationships into money relationships. In the place of naturally grown towns it created the modern, large industrial cities which have sprung up overnight. Wherever it penetrated, it destroyed the crafts and all earlier stages of industry. It completed the victory of the commercial town over the countryside. [Its first premise] was the automatic system. [Its development] produced a mass of productive forces, for which private [property] became just as much a fetter as the guild had been for manufacture and the small, rural workshop for the developing craft. These productive forces received under the system of private property a one-sided development only, and became for the majority destructive forces; moreover, a great multitude of such forces could find no application at all within this system. (...) from the conception of history we have sketched we obtain these further conclusions: (1) In the development of productive forces there comes a stage when productive forces and means of intercourse are brought into being, which, under the existing relationships, only cause mischief, and are no longer forces of production but forces of destruction (machinery and money); and connected with this a class is called forth, which has to bear all the burdens of society without enjoying its advantages, which, ousted from society, is forced into the most decided antagonism to all other classes; a class which forms the majority of all members of society, and from which emanates the consciousness of the necessity of a fundamental revolution, the communist consciousness, which may, of course, arise among the other classes too through the contemplation of the situation of this class. (...) Both for the production on a mass scale of this communist consciousness, and for the success of the cause itself, the changing of men on a mass scale is, necessary, a change which can only take place in a practical movement, a revolution; this revolution is necessary, therefore, not only because the ruling class cannot be overthrown in any other way, but also because the class overthrowing it, can only in a revolution succeed in ridding itself of all the muck of ages, and become fitted to found society anew. (From ''[[The German Ideology]]''<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01d.htm#d1)]</ref>)}}\n\n== Marxist\u2013Leninist definition in the Soviet Union ==\nThe Institute of Economics of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R., textbook (1957, p xiv) says that \"[t]he productive forces reflect the ''relationship'' of people to the objects and forces of nature used for the production of material wealth.\" (italics added) While productive forces are a ''human'' activity, the concept of ''productive forces'' includes the concept that technology mediates the human-nature relationship. Productive forces do ''not'' include the [[subject of labor]] (the raw materials or materials from nature being worked on). Productive forces are not the same thing as the [[means of production]]. Marx identified three components of production: human labor, subject of labor, and means of labor (1967, p 174). Productive forces are the union of human labor and the means of labor; ''means of production'' are the union of the subject of labor and the means of labor. (Institute of Economics of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R., 1957, p xiii).\n\nOn the other hand, The Great Soviet Encyclopedia (1969-1978) states:\n{{Quotation| Society\u2019s principal productive forces are people\u2014the participants in social production, or the workers and the toiling masses in general (K. Marx and F. Engels, vol. 46, part 1, p. 403; V. I.

The material elements of the productive forces (the means of production and the means of consumption) are the product of human reason and labor. The means of production include the means of labor, which transmit human influence to nature, and the objects of labor, to which human labor is applied. The most important components of the means of labor are the instruments of labor (for example, tools, devices, and machines).\n (From ''Productive forces. \u2014 The Great Soviet Encyclopedia: in 30 volumes. \u2014 Moscow: \u00abSoviet Encyclopedia\u00bb, 1969-1978.''; English web-version of the article [http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Production+forces]; original version in Russian [http://slovari.yandex.ru/%D0%B1%D1%81%D1%8D%20%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8B/%D0%91%D0%A1%D0%AD/%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8B/])}}\n\nAccording to this, productive forces have such structure:\n* People (human labour power)\n* Means (the material elements of the productive forces)\n** Means of production\n*** Means of labour\n**** Instruments of labour\n*** Objects of labour (also known as Subject of labour)\n** Means of consumption\n\nMarxism in USSR served as core philosophical paradigm or platform, and had been developing as a science. So different views, hypotheses and approaches were widely discussed, tested and refined with time.\n\n== Determinism ==\n:''See article: [[Theory of productive forces]]''\n{{expand section|date=August 2017}}\n\n== Reification of technology ==\nOther interpretations, sometimes influenced by [[postmodernism]] and the concept of [[commodity fetishism]] have by contrast emphasized the [[reification (Marxism)|reification]] of the powers of technology, said to occur by the separation of technique from the producers, and by falsely imputing human powers to technology as autonomous force, the effect being a perspective of inevitable and unstoppable [[technological progress]] operating beyond any human control, and impervious to human choices.\n\nIn turn, this is said to have the effect of naturalising and legitimating social arrangements produced by people, by asserting that they are technically inevitable. The error here seems to be that [[social relations]] between people are confused and conflated with technical relations between people and things, and object relations between things; but this error is said to be a spontaneous result of the operation of a universal [[Market (economics)|market]] and the process of [[commercialization]].\n\n== Productivity ==\nMarx's concept of productive forces also has some relevance for discussions in economics about the meaning and measurement of [[productivity]].\n\nModern economics theorises productivity in terms of the marginal product of the [[factors of production]]. Marx theorises productivity within the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] in terms of the social and technical [[relations of production]], with the concept of the [[organic composition of capital]] and the [[value product]]. He suggests there is no completely neutral view of productivity possible; how productivity is defined depends on the values and interests people have. Thus, different [[social class]]es have different notions of productivity reflecting their own station in life, and giving rise to different notions of [[Unproductive labor|productive and unproductive labour]].\n\n== Critique of technology ==\nIn the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] or [[ecological]] critique of technology, technical progress boosting productivity often does not mean human progress at all. The design of production technologies may not be suited to human needs or human health, or technologies may be used in ways which do more harm than good. In that case, productive forces are transformed into destructive forces.\n\nSometimes this view leads to [[cultural pessimism]] or a theory of \"[[Small Is Beautiful|Small is beautiful]]\" as proposed by [[E. F. Schumacher]]. Ideas about [[alternative technology]] are also proposed. All of this suggests that the technologies we have, are only ''options'' which have been chosen from different technical possibilities existing at the time, and that the same technologies can be used for good or for ill, in different contexts.\n\nA technology may be chosen because it is profitable, and once adopted on a mass scale, it may be difficult to create alternatives to it, particularly because it becomes integrated with other technologies and a whole \"life style\" (e.g. petrol-fueled cars). Yet that may not mean that the technology is ultimately desirable for human life on earth.\n\nProductive force determinism is then criticised on the ground that whatever technologies are adopted, these are the result of human [[choices]] between technical alternatives, influenced by the human interests and stakes existing at the time. What may be presented as a pre-determined \"technical necessity\" may in reality have more to do with considerations of [[political power|political]], [[power (sociology)|sociological]], or [[economic power]].\n\nAdvocates of technological progress however argue that even if admittedly \"progress may have its price\", without technical innovation there would be no progress at all; the same people who criticize technology also depend on it for their everyday existence.\n\n== References ==\n* Karl Marx, [[The Poverty of Philosophy]]\n* Karl Marx, [[The German Ideology]]\n* Karl Marx, \"The Trinity Formula\", chapter 48 in [[Capital, Volume III|volume 3 of Marx's Capital]].\n* Josef V.

Marx and Engels probably derived the concept from [[Adam Smith]]'s reference to the \"productive powers of labour\" (see e.g. chapter 8 of ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''), although the German political economist [[Friedrich List]] also mentions the concept of \"productive powers\" in ''The National System of Political Economy'' (1841).\n\nAll those forces which are applied by people in the production process (body and brain, tools and techniques, materials, resources, quality of workers' cooperation, and equipment) are encompassed by this concept, including those management and engineering functions technically indispensable for production (as contrasted with social control functions). Human [[knowledge]] can also be a productive force.\n\nTogether with the social and technical [[relations of production]], the productive forces constitute a historically specific [[mode of production]].\n\n== Labor ==\n[[Karl Marx]] emphasized that with few exceptions means of labour are not a productive force unless they are actually operated, maintained and conserved by living human labour. Without applying living human labour, their physical condition and value would deteriorate, depreciate, or be destroyed (an example would be a [[ghost town]] or capital depreciation due to [[strike action]]).\n\nCapital itself, being one of the [[factors of production]], comes to be viewed in capitalist society as a productive force in its own right, independent from labour, a subject with \"a life of its own\". Indeed, Marx sees the essence of what he calls \"the capital relation\" as being summarised by the circumstance that \"capital buys labour\", i.e. the power of property ownership to command human energy and labour-time, and thus of inanimate \"things\" to exert an autonomous power over people. What disappears from view is that the power of capital depends in the last instance on human cooperation.\n\n{{Quotation|\"The production of life, both of one\u2019s own in labour and of fresh life in procreation... appears as a double relationship: on the one hand as a natural, on the other as a social relationship. By social we understand the co-operation of several individuals, no matter under what conditions, in what manner and to what end. It follows from this that a certain mode of production, or industrial stage, is always combined with a certain mode of co-operation, or social stage, and this mode of co-operation is itself a \u201cproductive force.\u201d<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm]</ref>}}\n\nThe productive power of cooperation comes to be viewed as the productive power of capital, because it is capital which forcibly organises people, rather than people organising capital. Marx regarded this as a supreme [[Reification (Marxism)|reification]].\n\nUnlike British classical economics, [[Marxian economics]] classifies financial capital as being an element of the relations of production, rather than the factors or forces of production (\"not a thing, but a social relation between persons, established by the instrumentality of things\").<ref>Marx, Karl. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch33.htm ''[[Das Kapital]]'', Vol. I, Ch. 33], courtesy of www.marxists.org.</ref>\n\n== Destructive forces ==\nMarx and Engels did not believe that human history featured a continuous growth of the productive forces. Rather, the development of the productive forces was characterised by social conflicts. Some productive forces destroyed other productive forces, sometimes productive techniques were lost or destroyed, and sometimes productive forces could be turned into destructive forces:\n\n{{Quotation|\"How little highly developed productive forces are safe from complete destruction, given even a relatively very extensive commerce, is proved by the Phoenicians, whose inventions were for the most part lost for a long time to come through the ousting of this nation from commerce, its conquest by Alexander and its consequent decline. Likewise, for instance, glass-painting in the Middle Ages. Only when commerce has become world commerce, and has as its basis large-scale industry, when all nations are drawn into the competitive struggle, is the permanence of the acquired productive forces assured. (...) Competition soon compelled every country that wished to retain its historical role to protect its manufactures {{sic}} by renewed customs regulations (the old duties were no longer any good against big industry) and soon after to introduce big industry under protective duties. Big industry universalised competition in spite of these protective measures (it is practical free trade; the protective duty is only a palliative, a measure of defence within free trade), established means of communication and the modern world market, subordinated trade to itself, transformed all capital into industrial capital, and thus produced the rapid circulation (development of the financial system) and the centralisation of capital. By universal competition it forced all individuals to strain their energy to the utmost. It destroyed as far as possible ideology, religion, morality, etc. and where it could not do this, made them into a palpable lie. It produced world history for the first time, insofar as it made all civilised nations and every individual member of them dependent for the satisfaction of their wants on the whole world, thus destroying the former natural exclusiveness of separate nations. It made natural science subservient to capital and took from the division of labour the last semblance of its natural character. It destroyed natural growth in general, as far as this is possible while labour exists, and resolved all natural relationships into money relationships. In the place of naturally grown towns it created the modern, large industrial cities which have sprung up overnight. Wherever it penetrated, it destroyed the crafts and all earlier stages of industry. It completed the victory of the commercial town over the countryside. [Its first premise] was the automatic system. [Its development] produced a mass of productive forces, for which private [property] became just as much a fetter as the guild had been for manufacture and the small, rural workshop for the developing craft. These productive forces received under the system of private property a one-sided development only, and became for the majority destructive forces; moreover, a great multitude of such forces could find no application at all within this system. (...) from the conception of history we have sketched we obtain these further conclusions: (1) In the development of productive forces there comes a stage when productive forces and means of intercourse are brought into being, which, under the existing relationships, only cause mischief, and are no longer forces of production but forces of destruction (machinery and money); and connected with this a class is called forth, which has to bear all the burdens of society without enjoying its advantages, which, ousted from society, is forced into the most decided antagonism to all other classes; a class which forms the majority of all members of society, and from which emanates the consciousness of the necessity of a fundamental revolution, the communist consciousness, which may, of course, arise among the other classes too through the contemplation of the situation of this class. (...) Both for the production on a mass scale of this communist consciousness, and for the success of the cause itself, the changing of men on a mass scale is, necessary, a change which can only take place in a practical movement, a revolution; this revolution is necessary, therefore, not only because the ruling class cannot be overthrown in any other way, but also because the class overthrowing it, can only in a revolution succeed in ridding itself of all the muck of ages, and become fitted to found society anew.

Productive forces do ''not'' include the [[subject of labor]] (the raw materials or materials from nature being worked on). Productive forces are not the same thing as the [[means of production]]. Marx identified three components of production: human labor, subject of labor, and means of labor (1967, p 174). Productive forces are the union of human labor and the means of labor; ''means of production'' are the union of the subject of labor and the means of labor.
